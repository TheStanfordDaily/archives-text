# African students focus on raising awareness

Awareness works both ways.
As members of the Stanford African Student
Association, Tahir Salie and Bertram Eyakuze have
worked hard organizing this week's Africa Week cel
ebration to create awareness of African culture and
history among the Stanford community.
But they also work hard to make Africans more
aware of the world around them.
"It is critical that our youth become increasingly
aware that they are part of the African continent,"
said graduate student Salie, a native of South Africa.
He said the country is "isolated" from the inter
national community and even the rest of African
continent. Because of this isolation, he added, people
in South Africa "think everyone else thinks the way
they do."
Salie, president of the 50-member student associ
ation, was born in Capetown, South Africa. After
completing a masters' program in international edu
cation this August, he will return to South Africa to
continue his job as Director of Human Resources for
the African National Congress.
As the director of the Careers Research and Infor
mation Center in South Africa before he came to
Stanford, Salie helped black youths deal with unem
ployment and find jobs that had been mostly taken
by the white minority.


Sophomore Bertram Eyakuze and graduate student Tahir Salle helped organize Africa Week to cele
brate their countries' cultures. Both students are native Africans who feel strong connections to their
homeland and hope to return there after they complete their studies at Stanford.
Of all African countries, apartheid is
legal only in South Africa.
Salie said that when he first started
the job in 1987, "Black Africans were
largely discriminated against by laws that
relegated them to unskilled and semi
skilled labor."
He is working to have South Africa
"re-enter the international community"
through education, he said, adding that
more training opportunities have to be
available to South African youth.
Most black South Africans who even
tually attend universities study humani
ties and social science fields, but the
country needs people more skilled in tech
nical, life science and medical areas, he
said.
Though the "deprivation of education"
needs to be corrected, particularly for
black South Africans, Salie said it will not
be "solved by importing Western" prac
tices.
Salie said he came to Stanford because
of its internationally renowned education
program. He added that he has already
seen a "fair level of awareness" in the
Stanford community, attributing it to the
number of South African students here
and to faculty members who "have been
in touch with South African educators."
Like Salie, Eyakuze is here because he
hopes to improve conditions in Africa.
Born in Tanzania, Eyakuze lived in
many parts of Africa because his father,
who worked for the United Nations,
moved frequently to supervise different

branches of the World Health Organiza
tion.
Eyakuze, a sophomore in civil engi
neering, has always attended schools with
many international students, but did not
belong to a racial minority until he came
to Stanford.
He said he has always felt fortunate
about his educational opportunities, par
ticularly about coming to the United
States to study, because "not many people
get out" of Africa.
His cousins, whom he said are equally
competent, "didn't get a chance." The
lack of financial resources and of
extracurricular opportunities that can
help a person get into colleges outside of
Africa were some of the factors that held
them back, he said.
Eyakuze said he had not heard of Stan
ford until an American woman came to
his school in Swaziland to recruit stu
dents. He applied to several schools,
including UC-Berkeley and Princeton,
but decided to come to Stanford because
of its moderate climate and reputation for
being "all-around."
Coming to Stanford was not as big a
"culture shock" as he thinks people
expect it to be, Eyazuke said.
"I didn't come from a rural commu
nity. I've been exposed to urban life," he
said, adding that Stanford was "just on a
bigger scale — more intense, more
impressive and cleaner."
But he said feelings of "being insignif
icant and not being an individual are
heightened here" because people in Africa

are "a lot closer and friendlier." He
admits that cultural views of closeness
and friendliness may differ.
He added that white African students
make the same adjustments when they
come to study in the United States.
Eyakuze said the isolation he some
times feels at Stanford is not because he
feels oppressed as a black person. Rather,
isolation comes from being a minority at
Stanford, while at home, he has always
been part of the majority.
Both students are committed to
returning to Africa to share their experi
ences.
"It is important to make a commit
ment to go back home and plow back your
knowledge, but not do it uncritically,"
said Salie.
Eyakuze warned that there is a ten
dency among some Africans who return
from traveling "to be above the general
populace." He also said many Africans
never go back home.
While some people live outside of the
country, where there are few government
limitations, in order to help Africa,
Eyakuze said the "best people feel com
pelled to leave" permanently for personal
reasons.
Since coming to America, Eyakuze said
his perceptions about black history here
have changed. Though he knew relations
between black and white people here
"weren't homogeneous," he said he didn't
pay attention to it while in Africa.
He said learning the history and
grievances of racism in this country has

been "a real eye-opener" and he wants to
take this lesson back home, though "most
people know about the slave thing."
"People have an extremely favorable
picture of the United States, but it is
important to show them that racial ten
sions exist even here," he said.
Most South Africans view America as
the "land of milk and honey where any
thing is possible," Salie said, adding that
these ideas are conveyed through movies.
Though Martin Luther King's fame
has reached their borders, he said there is
"not much information about the
African-American contribution to the
black struggle."
Having been here two years, Eyakuze
said he understands some frustrations of
the black community.
"They have to deal with living in a land
that is predominantly influenced by a cul
ture that is not theirs," Eyakuze said.
This "has an influence on the way you
see yourself," he added.
Going to Africa can help black stu
dents who want to discover more of their
identity, but Eyakuze said "it's more com
plicated than that."
"You can't just go back and find this
link," he said, adding that people must
have enough interest in their African
roots to gain something from visiting
Africa.
While Salie said he does not feel any
tension with the black community here as
a South African national, he identifies
with them as Africans rather than as
Americans.

Though black American values may
differ from his own, they "don't have
opposing views about where people of
color should be heading," Salie said. "It is
important for people who have gone
through a struggle to share it."
He said he agreed with the way Stan
ford dealt with the 1988 Otero incident —
when seven fraternity members appeared
in masks evoking images of the Ku Klux
Klan and held candles in a silent protest
— because it was "very upfront."
Salie stressed the importance of bring
ing racial tensions "into the open because
they shouldn't be allowed to simmer."
Overall, he said he is pleased with the
community's attempts to confront
racism, adding that he is sensitive to
black stereotypes he has experienced in
the United States.
America still has a "level of freedom
not attained in South Africa — and that is
the freedom to say what you want,
regardless of whether anyone is listening
to you," Salie said.
Salie lives with his wife and and two
children in Escondido Village and said he
likes the international exposure his chil
dren are receiving there.
Though he speaks English to his chil
dren now, he said he will make sure they
learn a native African language when
they return to South Africa this August
so they can communicate with the older
generation.
Eyazuke speaks Swahili and English
fluently. He said he can "get along" in
French.

color should be heading," Salie said. "It is
important for people who have gone
through a struggle to share it."
He said he agreed with the way Stan
ford dealt with the 1988 Otero incident —
when seven fraternity members appeared
in masks evoking images of the Ku Klux
Klan and held candles in a silent protest
— because it was "very upfront."
Salie stressed the importance of bring

they shouldn't be allowed to simmer."
Overall, he said he is pleased with the
community's attempts to confront
racism, adding that he is sensitive to
black stereotypes he has experienced in
the United States.
America still has a "level of freedom
not attained in South Africa — and that is
the freedom to say what you want,
regardless of whether anyone is listening
to you," Salie said.
Salie lives with his wife and and two
children in Escondido Village and said he
likes the international exposure his chil
dren are receiving there.
Though he speaks English to his chil
dren now, he said he will make sure they
learn a native African language when
they return to South Africa this August
so they can communicate with the older
generation.
Eyazuke speaks Swahili and English
fluently. He said he can "get along" in

Awareness works both ways.
As members of the Stanford African Student
Association, Tahir Salie and Bertram Eyakuze have
worked hard organizing this week's Africa Week cel
ebration to create awareness of African culture and
history among the Stanford community.
But they also work hard to make Africans more
aware of the world around them.
"It is critical that our youth become increasingly
aware that they are part of the African continent,"
said graduate student Salie, a native of South Africa.
He said the country is "isolated" from the inter
national community and even the rest of African
continent. Because of this isolation, he added, people
in South Africa "think everyone else thinks the way
they do."
Salie, president of the 50-member student associ
ation, was born in Capetown, South Africa. After
completing a masters' program in international edu
cation this August, he will return to South Africa to
continue his job as Director of Human Resources for
the African National Congress.
As the director of the Careers Research and Infor
mation Center in South Africa before he came to
Stanford, Salie helped black youths deal with unem
ployment and find jobs that had been mostly taken
by the white minority.


Sophomore Bertram Eyakuze and graduate student Tahir Salle helped organize Africa Week to cele
brate their countries' cultures. Both students are native Africans who feel strong connections to their
homeland and hope to return there after they complete their studies at Stanford.
Of all African countries, apartheid is
legal only in South Africa.
Salie said that when he first started
the job in 1987, "Black Africans were
largely discriminated against by laws that
relegated them to unskilled and semi
skilled labor."
He is working to have South Africa
"re-enter the international community"
through education, he said, adding that
more training opportunities have to be
available to South African youth.
Most black South Africans who even
tually attend universities study humani
ties and social science fields, but the
country needs people more skilled in tech
nical, life science and medical areas, he
said.
Though the "deprivation of education"
needs to be corrected, particularly for
black South Africans, Salie said it will not
be "solved by importing Western" prac
tices.
Salie said he came to Stanford because
of its internationally renowned education
program. He added that he has already
seen a "fair level of awareness" in the
Stanford community, attributing it to the
number of South African students here
and to faculty members who "have been
in touch with South African educators."
Like Salie, Eyakuze is here because he
hopes to improve conditions in Africa.
Born in Tanzania, Eyakuze lived in
many parts of Africa because his father,
who worked for the United Nations,
moved frequently to supervise different

branches of the World Health Organiza
tion.
Eyakuze, a sophomore in civil engi
neering, has always attended schools with
many international students, but did not
belong to a racial minority until he came
to Stanford.
He said he has always felt fortunate
about his educational opportunities, par
ticularly about coming to the United
States to study, because "not many people
get out" of Africa.
His cousins, whom he said are equally
competent, "didn't get a chance." The
lack of financial resources and of
extracurricular opportunities that can
help a person get into colleges outside of
Africa were some of the factors that held
them back, he said.
Eyakuze said he had not heard of Stan
ford until an American woman came to
his school in Swaziland to recruit stu
dents. He applied to several schools,
including UC-Berkeley and Princeton,
but decided to come to Stanford because
of its moderate climate and reputation for
being "all-around."
Coming to Stanford was not as big a
"culture shock" as he thinks people
expect it to be, Eyazuke said.
"I didn't come from a rural commu
nity. I've been exposed to urban life," he
said, adding that Stanford was "just on a
bigger scale — more intense, more
impressive and cleaner."
But he said feelings of "being insignif
icant and not being an individual are
heightened here" because people in Africa

are "a lot closer and friendlier." He
admits that cultural views of closeness
and friendliness may differ.
He added that white African students
make the same adjustments when they
come to study in the United States.
Eyakuze said the isolation he some
times feels at Stanford is not because he
feels oppressed as a black person. Rather,
isolation comes from being a minority at
Stanford, while at home, he has always
been part of the majority.
Both students are committed to
returning to Africa to share their experi
ences.
"It is important to make a commit
ment to go back home and plow back your
knowledge, but not do it uncritically,"
said Salie.
Eyakuze warned that there is a ten
dency among some Africans who return
from traveling "to be above the general
populace." He also said many Africans
never go back home.
While some people live outside of the
country, where there are few government
limitations, in order to help Africa,
Eyakuze said the "best people feel com
pelled to leave" permanently for personal
reasons.
Since coming to America, Eyakuze said
his perceptions about black history here
have changed. Though he knew relations
between black and white people here
"weren't homogeneous," he said he didn't
pay attention to it while in Africa.
He said learning the history and
grievances of racism in this country has

been "a real eye-opener" and he wants to
take this lesson back home, though "most
people know about the slave thing."
"People have an extremely favorable
picture of the United States, but it is
important to show them that racial ten
sions exist even here," he said.
Most South Africans view America as
the "land of milk and honey where any
thing is possible," Salie said, adding that
these ideas are conveyed through movies.
Though Martin Luther King's fame
has reached their borders, he said there is
"not much information about the
African-American contribution to the
black struggle."
Having been here two years, Eyakuze
said he understands some frustrations of
the black community.
"They have to deal with living in a land
that is predominantly influenced by a cul
ture that is not theirs," Eyakuze said.
This "has an influence on the way you
see yourself," he added.
Going to Africa can help black stu
dents who want to discover more of their
identity, but Eyakuze said "it's more com
plicated than that."
"You can't just go back and find this
link," he said, adding that people must
have enough interest in their African
roots to gain something from visiting
Africa.
While Salie said he does not feel any
tension with the black community here as
a South African national, he identifies
with them as Africans rather than as
Americans.

Though black American values may
differ from his own, they "don't have
opposing views about where people of
color should be heading," Salie said. "It is
important for people who have gone
through a struggle to share it."
He said he agreed with the way Stan
