Dow hits new high, breaks 3,000
NEW YORK (AP) — Predictions of a health
ier economy and a steady investor zeal for
stocks sent the Dow Jones industrial average
soaring yesterday to close at an all-time high.
The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks
closed at 3,004.46, up 17.58 points, breaking
the previous record of 2,999.75 on July 16 and
17, 1990.
Other indexes that track the wider market,
such as the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq
composite index, have closed in record terri
tory in recent weeks.
"Every other market has been making new
highs for close to two weeks," said Peter Van
denberg, market analyst for Lehman Brothers
Inc. "The Dow has been lagging the market for
quite awhile."
U.S. troops move into northern
Iraq to scout sites for camps
ISIKVEREN, Turkey (AP) - Bedraggled
Kurdish refugees yesterday cheered the arrival
of U.S. ground troops who began scouting sites
in northern Iraq for Western-supervised
camps. But hunger, disease and cold took an
ever-mounting toll of lives.
About 800,000 Kurds have fled to Turkey
and its border and nearly 1.5 million of Iraq's
4 million Kurds have sought safety in Iran and
along its frontier, according to the latest esti
mates.
They began fleeing Iraq after Saddam Hus
sein's forces moved to crush their uprising.
In the south, where Shiite Muslims also
rebelled against Saddam's rule, another
71,000 Shiite Iraqis fled to Iran and about
30,000 more are in a border zone in southern
Iraq.
Largest Soviet mine ends strike
MOSCOW (AP) — The nation's largest coal
mine resumed operations yesterday free from
Kremlin control — a small crack in a crippling
strike but a victory in the fight by republics to
gain control over Soviet industry and natural
wealth.
Meanwhile, workers in other industries
threatened to join miners who continued the 7-
week-old strike.
The strike was backed by a veteran dissi
dent who returned to Moscow this week after
more than 15 years in exile.
Vladimir Bukovsky urged protests and said
a general" walkout "is the only solution" to
force Kremlin reforms and to oust President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
