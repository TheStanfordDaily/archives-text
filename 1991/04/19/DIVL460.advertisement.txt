is a Visonic dome? It is an
electronic device, the size of a ten
nis ball, that utilizes ultrasonic en
ergy to clean and disinfect contact
lenses. The ultrasonic technology
has been widely used on a profes
sional level in cleaning medical in
struments, sensitive objects as well
as optics. For the first time, such
technology is made available for
home use.
does it work? Just plug the Visonic
Dome into an electrical outlet for
10 minutes. The ultrasonic energy
generates 30,000 to 40,000 vibra
tions per second, causing thou
sands of air bubbles in the cleaning
liquid to attach to contact lenses.
The implosive action of the bubbles
remove protein deposits, lipids,
and other contaminants. All types
of handfree one-step solutions can
be used with the Visonic Dome.
is it better? SIMPLE — One step,
handsfree, THOROUGH — com
plete protein deposit removal, EF
FICIENT — 10 minute duration,
auto shut ofF. SAFE — no risk of
damaging the contact lens. Both
the lack of time spent and the
flawed technique used by most
lens wearers often results in un
clean lenses and irritated eyes.
