Gorbachev seeks union treaty
with only nine of 15 republics
TOKYO (AP) — Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said yesterday night that he will try
to hammer out a new union treaty with just
nine of the 15 Soviet republics, giving up at
least temporarily on six independence-minded
republics.
Gorbachev, trying to get the Soviet Union's
basic unifying document written before the
country falls apart, said only the nine republics
that took part in a referendum on preserving
the union would participate in a conference
next Tuesday on the Union Treaty.
The six republics whose parliaments refused
to conduct the March 17 referendum are Mol
davia, the southern republics of Georgia and
Armenia, and the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
ANC rejects peace summit
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Presi
dent F.W. de Klerk yesterday invited political,
religious and academic leaders to a peace sum
mit on township violence, but the main black
opposition group rejected the idea.
The African National Congress also dis
missed de Klerk's proposal for an official com
mission to investigate political violence.
De Klerk acknowledged in a statement that
previous government steps to end unrest —
curfews, deploying extra police and soldiers,
and giving police broad powers to detain people
— had been inadequate.
He said the May 24-25 summit would "call
upon political and other leaders to assume co
responsibility" in ending the factional town
ship strife that has claimed 6,000 lives.
The ANC rejected the peace conference as
"propaganda" aimed at winning de Klerk sup
port when he visits Europe. It said the confer
ence would be "unnecessary and divisionary."
U.S. leaves behind powerful naval
armada to watch Saddam
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — As the
United States pulls out its combat troops, a
naval armada of 45 ships and 150 warplanes
remains in the Persian Gulf to enforce a U.N.
arms embargo on Iraq and keep an already bat
tered Saddam Hussein in line.
Some U.S. officers say the U.S. military activ
ity in the gulf will probably not extend much
beyond that, because Saddam's forces were seri
ously weakened by their defeat in the Gulf War.
