# Bush unveils plan for reforms in education
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush
unveiled his blueprint yesterday for "a rev
olution in American education," including a
voluntary nationwide exam system, aid
pegged to academic results and $550 mil
lion to start new schools from scratch.
"We must transform America's schools.
The days of the status quo are over," Bush
declared as he presented his "America
2000" education strategy to an East Room
audience of governors, business leaders and
educators.
"The time for all the reports and rank
ings, for all the studies and surveys about
what's wrong with our schools, is past,"
said Bush.
The plan, crafted by new Education Sec
retary Lamar Alexander in his first month
on the job, calls for relatively little new fed
eral spending. It relies instead upon states,
governors, teachers, parents, students and
communities to take steps to embrace the
rigorous new education goals that Bush and
the governors pronounced early last year.
It is "a national strategy, not a federal
program,'' according to a 34-page Educa
tion Department strategy manual.
Still, Bush said he will ask Congress for
$690 million, mostly for $1 million seed
grants to open a prototype "New American
School" in each of the 535 congressional
districts by 1996. He invited communities
to vie for the grants to create the non-tradi
tional new schools, some of which may be
operated by private businesses.
Democratic leaders of Congress said they
would work with Bush on the plan but also
accused him of waiting too long and of
obstructing their past school improvement
initiatives.

"We welcome his interest in education,
belated as it is," Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said.
Mitchell said Bush had failed to help
Democrats pass new education legislation
last fall, and he added, "All of us have seen
a large number of White House press con
ferences before. Too often, effort on behalf
of the issue ... stops when the cameras stop
rolling."
The new tests described in the Bush plan
will be non-compulsory, honors-type exams
in five core subjects — English, math, sci
ence, history and geography — for 4th, Bth
and 12th graders. Bush said he was deter
mined to have the first tests for 4th graders
ready by September 1993. He promised
presidential citations for top 12th-grade
scorers.
He already has enlisted business leaders
to raise at least $150 million to underwrite
the costs of designing the new schools,
which he said should "break the mold" and
throw out the rule book for existing
schools.
Bush also said he will press anew for giv
ing parents more choice in education,
including whether to send their child to a
public or private school.
"The definition of 'public school' should
be broadened to mean any school that
serves the public and is held accountable by
a public authority," the strategy stated.
The president also said he will ask
Congress for new funds to reward schools
that make progress toward the national
education goals.
He proposed "President Achievement
Scholarships" for low-income students with
superior records.
