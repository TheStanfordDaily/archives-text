# Refugee crisis creates opportunities for Iran

URUMIYEH, Iran (AP) - The
flood of Kurdish refugees is giving Iran
unprecedented opportunities to
improve its relations with the West
and resolve internal disputes, Western
diplomats and aid officials say.
Iran claims the crisis is costing its
government $10 million a day. It might
be worth every penny.
Tehran's treatment of the Kurds
has won high marks among Western
diplomats and politicians visiting this

northern city, the center of relief
efforts to help the refugees.
In the long run, Tehran could gain
influence among the Kurds, who have
long been a political headache. That, in
turn, could give Iran a stronger voice
in Middle East politics, diplomats said.
The 1.5 million refugees already in
Iran or approaching it is more than
double Turkey's load.
When refugees began trying to
enter Iran, they were not kept outside

the border in desperate conditions, as
has happened on the Turkish border.
Instead, Iran set up camps, donated
bread and did what it could to help,
Western aid officials said.
Hashemi Rafsanjani has been work
ing slowly to relax Iran's foreign policy
since he became president in 1989
after the death of Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Iran recently re-established rela
tions with Britain, Jordan and other

Arab states and improved ties with
France.
"For Rafsanjani and his people, the
crisis could be an important spring
board to further opening," said a high
ranking Western diplomat visiting
Urumiyeh. "This is what everybody
hopes."
Rafsanjani also has mellowed the
Islamic republic's hard line on reli
gious and ethnic minorities.
