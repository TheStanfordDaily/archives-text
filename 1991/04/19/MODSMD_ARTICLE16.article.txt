## We're not alone in it 
### 
AS THE INDIRECT-COST
controversy rages on, observ
ers would be wise to keep the
larger picture in mind.
Stanford is not alone in this
mess. The federal government is
investigating cost-recovery prac
tices at more than 30 universities,
and those that aren't being investi
gated are nervously checking their
books and finding expenses that
make them uncomfortable. This
month, Caltech, among others,
offered to pay back expenses it had
incorrectly charged the govern
ment.
And Stanford won't be the only
school to suffer. Harvard Medical
School's indirect-cost rate, for
example, may drop by as many as
20 percentage points.
All of which highlights one of the

fundamental ironies of the indi
rect-cost controversy: While indi
vidual schools are taking the heat,
the controversy is largely the result
of an arcane set of cost-recovery
rules that are incredibly difficult to
understand, let alone follow.
Unfortunately, the politics sur
rounding this controversy are like
ly to lead to an increased suspicion
of and a backlash against the
nation's universities, as well as a
new suspicion of the money spent
for federal research, the outcome of
which could be a decline in the pri
ority which the federal government
places on that research.
If so, the real loser in the indi
rect-cost controversy would be the
whole country, not just the nation's
colleges and universities.
