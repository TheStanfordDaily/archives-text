IF RECENT EVENTS ARE any
indication, Stanford University
is in dire need of a new distribu
tion requirement: accounting.
No one should be exempted from
this requirement — not students,
not resident fellows, not the
administration.
This week, residents of Haus
Mitteleuropa were made aware of
an accounting surprise anyone
would envy — their house has
accumulated a $26,000 bankroll.
Apparently, Haus Mitt has over
charged residents for years, accu
mulating a portfolio of profits that
embarrassed the house's residence
staff, who kept it secret from resi
dents.
Now aware of this windfall, resi
dents of Haus Mitt are dreaming of
pool tables, hot tubs and
microwave ovens. All of which is
harmless enough, except when one
considers that for years residents
of Haus Mitt were forced to pay
board bills the house didn't need.

Then there is the ASSU, whose
various student groups, which col
lect fee requests from students
each quarter, often fail to spend all
the money they receive. The extra
money goes into bank accounts
which are neither used to defray
the next year's expenses nor to off
set the amount which the ASSU
collects — the money just sits in
the ASSU's coffers.
Finally, there is the accounting
debacle to end all accounting deba
cles, the indirect-cost controversy.
A poorly organized system, in
which no one claims to have known
what he was doing, allowed well
intentioned University accoun
tants to enter expenses like depre
ciation on a yacht into research
cost pools which were billed to the
federal government.
Student groups often cry for a
"relevant curriculum." What could
be more relevant than a require
ment that taught everyone at Stan
ford how to balance a checkbook?
