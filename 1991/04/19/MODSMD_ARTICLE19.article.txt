# Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz
## Build a better senate 
### 
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS
election (not to mention the past
two years), we have noted an
absence of concrete answers to some
important questions regarding student
government at Stanford.
These questions should have been
answered by all the candidates for the
Council of Presidents or ASSU Senate —
whether in front of the student body or in
their own heads. The questions are not all
that complex: What has the ASSU done?
Why has it done so little? How can this be
changed?
After vast amounts of field research,
we have uncovered some unsettling
truths. When asked to list what new ser
vices the ASSU has provided in the past
year, the overwhelming answer was
u »
Instead of doing something for stu
dents, the ASSU has consistently chosen
to make declarations of sentiment on
whatever issues strike its collective fancy
This has generated unproductive bicker
ing, divided the senate into ideological
factions and annoyed the hell out of the
campus. We believe this is caused by the
ASSU's misunderstanding of its role on
campus. (We're the columnist guys; we've
gotta be pedantic.)
The ASSU is a deliberative body repre
senting enrolled Stanford students. It
should debate issues that affect Stanford
students as Stanford students and take
appropriate action. It should focus stu
dent resources to benefit the most stu
dents possible.
The ASSU should serve as a forum of
discussion for the various voices on cam
pus. In and of itself, it should not have a

"vision." It should instead be the agent
for the collective vision of its members.
The ASSU has thus far exceeded its man
date and warped its purpose.
Only representatives of an interest
group can make declarations for all of its
members; it exists to represent their
opinion. The Stanford student body is
rarely an interest group with a unified
position.
The ASSU should not represent the
opinion of a single group even if the group
is the majority; it is the representative of
all student interests. The views of every
one should be included in both the pro
cess and the product of debate.
When the ASSU takes a stand on an
issue, it grants validity to one argument
or group of students and disenfranchises
the other. A "pro-choice ASSU" tells any
one who is pro-life he or she is not in line
with the way "Stanford feels."
The declaration of sentiment ends all
meaningful debate. It forces those who
dissent not to justify their position, but to
justify the existence of their position. The
bills passed by the senate and the
speeches and letters written by the COP
present a position that says, "We repre
sent the only valid position. Anyone in
disagreement is either apathetic, insensi
tive, intolerant, uncaring or irrational."
It smacks of the problem that ethnic
minorities have faced in this country:
How do you have meaningful debate
about civil and human rights when your
opponents believe you to be something
less than human?
Stanford's diversity resides in opinions
that do not fit neatly into one of two cate
gories — Democrat or Republican, liberal

or conservative, People's Platform or Stu
dents Ist, oppressed or oppressor.
The dominance of these simplistic
dualisms in political or ideological debate
demeans our different backgrounds. It
limits our ability to reason and come to
rational, individual conclusions. It forces
us to sacrifice part of our beliefs to be part
of a group. It demeans an education that
has taught us to be analytic, not to judge
others from limited perspectives and to
learn through conversation and shared
experience.
We don't endorse visions, parties, ide
ologies or movements. We simply want an
ASSU that reflects and nurtures the
diversity and individuality of its student
body. We want a senate vote count that
reflects the nature of an issue and
changes based upon the merit of its argu
ments. We want a student body that,
when asked, can actually tell what the
ASSU has done for them.
In this election and in every election to
follow: We endorse INDIVIDUALS.

Andrew Katz and Kofi Bruce ran for sen
ate, serve on an ASSU committee, have
attended senate meetings, have friends in
each party and are hearings commission
ers. That should certainly constitute field
research.
