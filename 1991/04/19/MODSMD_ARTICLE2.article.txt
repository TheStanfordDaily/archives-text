# Students First leading:
## COP race headed for runoff 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Staff writers 
The "Students First" Council
of Presidents slate led the People's
Platform's "Stand and Deliver"
slate by about 14 percentage
points early this morning.
At 3:30 a.m., Students First
had about 42.6 percent of tallied
votes, compared to Stand and
Deliver's 28.5 percent. A runoff
election is expected between the
two slates within the next two
weeks. If Students First goes on to
win that runoff, it would end a
three-year reign by People's Plat
form COP slates.

Preliminary results count 91
percent of the total ballots cast,
according to hearings officer
Jason Moore.

against early this morning. John
Overdeck, who authored the bill
with senator Doug Bone, said he
was "very pleasantly surprised."
He added he believes the bill
will cancel out the Curry-Onaga
accountability amendment, which
was also passing by a large mar
gin. The accountability amend
ment requires student polls before

the ASSU can debate non-campus
issues.

senators and six non-voting sena

of 20 graduate and 20 undergrad
uate senators, half of whom may
vote.
Students First candidates won
eight voting seats and six non-vot
ing seats, and independent candi
dates won three voting positions.
