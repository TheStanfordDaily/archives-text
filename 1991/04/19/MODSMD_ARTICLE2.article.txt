# Students First leading:
## COP race headed for runoff 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Staff writers 
The "Students First" Council
of Presidents slate led the People's
Platform's "Stand and Deliver"
slate by about 14 percentage
points early this morning.
At 3:30 a.m., Students First
had about 42.6 percent of tallied
votes, compared to Stand and
Deliver's 28.5 percent. A runoff
election is expected between the
two slates within the next two
weeks. If Students First goes on to
win that runoff, it would end a
three-year reign by People's Plat
form COP slates.

Preliminary results count 91
percent of the total ballots cast,
according to hearings officer
Jason Moore.
Starting next year, the ASSU
will be limited to campus issues
with the passage of the Overdeck-
Bone constitutional amendment,
with 3,118 in favor to 1,499
against early this morning. John
Overdeck, who authored the bill
with senator Doug Bone, said he
was "very pleasantly surprised."
He added he believes the bill
will cancel out the Curry-Onaga
accountability amendment, which
was also passing by a large mar
gin. The accountability amend
ment requires student polls before

the ASSU can debate non-campus
issues.
For the first time in three
years, People's Platform seems to
have lost control of the senate.
The party had only nine voting
senators and six non-voting sena
tors. The ASSU Senate is made up
of 20 graduate and 20 undergrad
uate senators, half of whom may
vote.
Students First candidates won
eight voting seats and six non-vot
ing seats, and independent candi
dates won three voting positions.
Three Hammer and Coffin candi
dates and four independents were

elected to non-voting spots.
Freshman Jason Snyder, an
independent candidate for the
undergraduate senate, said he
was "really excited" about being
second in the ranking of senate
candidates. "The large numbers of
independent and Hammer and
Coffin votes makes a statement.
They show the annoyance some
people have with the party sys
tem," he said.
Junior John Louie, a member
of the Students First COP slate,
said he was "very pleased with the
way the results have come out.
With four slates, it seemed like a
runoff was expected."
Overdeck, another Students
First COP candidate, said, "It is
not a foregone conclusion that we
will win the runoff. We know that
[the People's Platform] can mobi
lize a certain number of voters
and we have to mobilize harder."
Stand and Deliver slate mem
ber Mike Curry, a sophomore, said
the results were hard to watch,
but the COP election "is definitely
not over." During the runoff, he
said his slate plans to "put forth

our full effort to talk to students
one on one."
Junior Nicole Johnson, also
from the Stand and Deliver slate,
agreed that a runoff seemed likely.
She said she was not surprised by
the results because she had no
preconceptions of how the election
would go. "I am just taking it as it
comes," she said.
Although the Hammer and
Coffin COP slate had received
only 22.8 percent, they remained
confident that they would be in
the runoff. "We have new planks
for our platform," said slate mem
ber Amy Arends. Hammer and
Coffin is sponsored by the Cha
parral, the campus humor maga
zine.
David Hyatt said he sees this
election as a "mtyor victory" for
humor slates. "Four Play," the
other humor slate, got 6.1 percent
of the votes.
The lateness of election results
left some candidates upset. Stu
dents First COP candidate Beth
Morgan, a sophomore, said she
would be flying home to Philadel
phia today and probably would
not know the final results. "It
sucks," she said.
But Curry said he was not sur
prised by the long wait. "This is
the second year in a row it has

been a late night at the ASSU," he
said.
Senior Michael Schreiber, a
Hammer and Coffin COP candi
date, was also not surprised. "We
understand that we cannot expect
it to be as fast as paper ballots,
with the added technology and
all," he said.
Elections commissioner Raul
Lopez said closing the poll sites
and organizing ballot information
on the computers caused a delay
in starting the compilation.
Moore, a junior, attributed the
problem to a new program based
on HyperCard and slow comput
ers. Graduate student Maurits
van der Veen, who wrote the pro
gram, said he would not comment
until all the votes were tallied.
Lopez said he would post the
final tallies in the ASSU office
information window. The senate
will hold a meeting Tuesday night
at which it is expected to validate
the results and set a date for the
runoff.
The runoff ballot will include
the special-fee request of Project
Motivation, which was
inadvertently left off yesterday's
ballot.

the special-fee request of Project
Motivation, which was
inadvertently left off yesterday's
ballot.
The winner of the Senior Class
Presidents race had not been
announced as of 3 a.m.
The "Students First" Council
of Presidents slate led the People's
Platform's "Stand and Deliver"
slate by about 14 percentage
points early this morning.
At 3:30 a.m., Students First
had about 42.6 percent of tallied
votes, compared to Stand and
Deliver's 28.5 percent. A runoff
election is expected between the
two slates within the next two
weeks. If Students First goes on to
win that runoff, it would end a
three-year reign by People's Plat
form COP slates.

Preliminary results count 91
percent of the total ballots cast,
according to hearings officer
Jason Moore.
Starting next year, the ASSU
will be limited to campus issues
with the passage of the Overdeck-
Bone constitutional amendment,
with 3,118 in favor to 1,499
against early this morning. John
Overdeck, who authored the bill
with senator Doug Bone, said he
was "very pleasantly surprised."
He added he believes the bill
will cancel out the Curry-Onaga
accountability amendment, which
was also passing by a large mar
gin. The accountability amend
ment requires student polls before

the ASSU can debate non-campus
issues.
For the first time in three
years, People's Platform seems to
have lost control of the senate.
The party had only nine voting
senators and six non-voting sena
tors. The ASSU Senate is made up
of 20 graduate and 20 undergrad
uate senators, half of whom may
vote.
Students First candidates won
eight voting seats and six non-vot
ing seats, and independent candi
dates won three voting positions.
Three Hammer and Coffin candi
dates and four independents were

elected to non-voting spots.
Freshman Jason Snyder, an
independent candidate for the
undergraduate senate, said he
was "really excited" about being
second in the ranking of senate
candidates. "The large numbers of
independent and Hammer and
Coffin votes makes a statement.
They show the annoyance some
people have with the party sys
tem," he said.
Junior John Louie, a member
of the Students First COP slate,
said he was "very pleased with the
way the results have come out.
With four slates, it seemed like a
runoff was expected."
Overdeck, another Students
First COP candidate, said, "It is
not a foregone conclusion that we
will win the runoff. We know that
[the People's Platform] can mobi
lize a certain number of voters
and we have to mobilize harder."
Stand and Deliver slate mem
ber Mike Curry, a sophomore, said
the results were hard to watch,
but the COP election "is definitely
not over." During the runoff, he
said his slate plans to "put forth

our full effort to talk to students
one on one."
Junior Nicole Johnson, also
from the Stand and Deliver slate,
agreed that a runoff seemed likely.
She said she was not surprised by
the results because she had no
preconceptions of how the election
would go. "I am just taking it as it
comes," she said.
Although the Hammer and
Coffin COP slate had received
only 22.8 percent, they remained
confident that they would be in
the runoff. "We have new planks
for our platform," said slate mem
ber Amy Arends. Hammer and
Coffin is sponsored by the Cha
parral, the campus humor maga
zine.
David Hyatt said he sees this
election as a "mtyor victory" for
humor slates. "Four Play," the
other humor slate, got 6.1 percent
of the votes.
The lateness of election results
left some candidates upset. Stu
dents First COP candidate Beth
Morgan, a sophomore, said she
would be flying home to Philadel
phia today and probably would
not know the final results. "It
sucks," she said.
But Curry said he was not sur
prised by the long wait. "This is
the second year in a row it has

been a late night at the ASSU," he
said.
Senior Michael Schreiber, a
Hammer and Coffin COP candi
date, was also not surprised. "We
understand that we cannot expect
it to be as fast as paper ballots,
with the added technology and
all," he said.
Elections commissioner Raul
Lopez said closing the poll sites
and organizing ballot information
on the computers caused a delay
in starting the compilation.
Moore, a junior, attributed the
problem to a new program based
on HyperCard and slow comput
ers. Graduate student Maurits
van der Veen, who wrote the pro
gram, said he would not comment
until all the votes were tallied.
Lopez said he would post the
final tallies in the ASSU office
information window. The senate
will hold a meeting Tuesday night
at which it is expected to validate
the results and set a date for the
runoff.
The runoff ballot will include
the special-fee request of Project
Motivation, which was
inadvertently left off yesterday's
ballot.
The winner of the Senior Class
Presidents race had not been
announced as of 3 a.m.
