## Dean not proving commitment to diversified faculty 
### 
IN THE APRIL 5 DAILY, there was
extensive and thorough coverage of
the Law School Day of Action spon
sored by the Coalition for a Diversified
Faculty. The article stated accurately the
main points in the affirmative action
proposal drafted by CDF.
Especially interesting, however, was
the comment attributed to Law School
Dean Paul Brest in relation to the CDF
plan. According to the article, Brest "said
he was unfamiliar with the coalition's
plan and declined to comment. He added
that the Law School faculty is currently
drafting an affirmative action plan which
will be submitted for comments to the
entire student body next week."
We can only believe Brest's response
is reflective of an unwillingness to take
the CDF proposals seriously. Further
more, his response is symptomatic of the

deeper problem of informality and lack
of accountability in the faculty hiring
process.
Brest was the first member of the fac
ulty to receive a copy of the CDF plan in
early March. Since that time, CDF has
held a series of meetings with Brest and
other members of the faculty to discuss
the proposals in the plan. CDF has also
had a formal meeting with the Law
School Appointment Committee, during
which we offered our plan and answered
questions regarding our philosophy,
goals and timetables.
At each of these meetings, Brest
refused to discuss with us the provisions
of the developing faculty plan. CDF was
assured, however, the time and effort we
had put into preparing our own plan was
greatly appreciated, and that both the
Appointments Committee and Brest

would give our proposals serious consid
eration.
Based on these assurances, CDF was
told to put aside any fears we had
regarding the faculty's commitment to
diversity. Yet after all of these meetings,
discussions and the formal submission of
the CDF plan, Brest declined to com
ment because he was "unfamiliar" with
the plan's proposals.
Brest's apparent oversight illustrates
one of the major weaknesses in the Law
School's approach to implementing affir
mative action. The faculty appointment
process as a whole is devoid of account
ability. The process is conducted behind
closed doors; no reason need be given for
the rejection or acceptance of candidates.
The CDF plan encourages greater
transparency and accountability in the
faculty appointment process. In any sin

cere effort to change a process which has
systematically excluded certain groups, it
is essential to examine the process itself
and make the actors who control the pro
cess accountable for their decisions.
CDF sees the formal institutionaliza
tion of student input, the establishment
of independent oversight mechanisms
and concrete goals and timetables, as the
best means of ensuring the faculty
abides by its affirmative action plan in
deeds and not just in words.
While we applaud the progress made
in the latest round of Law School faculty
appointments, we now have begun to
doubt seriously Brest's commitment to
discourse and substantial reform of an
exclusionary hiring process.
