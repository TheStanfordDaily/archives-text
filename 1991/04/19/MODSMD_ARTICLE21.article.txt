# Financial manager urges senators to learn accounting

IN RESPONSE TO LARRY
Augustin's letter concerning ASSU
finances, I have the following com
ments:
First, none of my statements in the
past were meant as personal attacks on
John Overdeck, nor were they politically
motivated. My statements have
attempted to shed light on the inaccura
cies that were presented as facts by
Overdeck in his statements about ASSU
finances.
When Overdeck makes statements
accusing the ASSU Business Office of
"sloppy bookkeeping" and "gross mis
management" of finances, I, as ASSU
financial manager, have every right and
am obligated to respond, not only in
defense, but for the preservation of the
integrity I think characterizes the man
ner in which the ASSU financial wing is
managed.

Augustin's, as well as Overdeck's,
statements expose a fundamental weak
ness in the relationship between the
ASSU Senate and the financial office:
The senate is charged with complete
financial oversight without having many
of the basic and necessary financial and
accounting skills that would allow it to
be most effective.
Augustin and Overdeck have been
unable to separate ASSU fees from the
greater operating budget of the ASSU. It
is true that the ASSU had revenues of
$134,284 last fiscal year, but this money
has absolutely nothing to do with ASSU
fees. The main ASSU income sources
include business project revenues and
interest income from investments.
Moreover, the only way this excess
money can be given directly back to stu
dents is by the action of the senate
Augustin's contention that Overdeck,

and presumably himself, understand the
ASSU finances is also contradicted by
their apparent misinterpretation of the
difference between capital reserves —
what accountants typically refer to as
shareholders' equity — and the reserve
accounts used specifically in the organi
zational funding process — which are
basically savings accounts for the special
fee system that show up as liabilities on
our balance sheet.
Augustin's statement that the 500
percent growth rate is a function of the
ASSU's overcharging students (presum
ably through student fees) is simply
incorrect. Because ASSU fees go entirely
to student organizations, the balances of
all of these student organizational
accounts show up as a huge liability on
our books, not as income!
This growth of ASSU reserves, con
trary to Augustin's statements, is indeed

designed to benefit students. However, it
won't benefit students by itself. The sen
ate must use its fiscal power to actualize
the potential benefits these assets repre
sent. Like Overdeck, Augustin has not
introduced one bill to tap the interest
income ($12,000 in this year's operating
budget) of these reserves for student use.
I find it absolutely inexcusable that
these senators accuse the ASSU of
hoarding financial resources from stu
dents when they have the power to
siphon off the interest income from
these resources for more productive
ends.
If ASSU financial resources have not
benefited students to the magnitude that
Overdeck and Augustin feel is appropri
ate, they simply have not been doing
their jobs as senators.
