# Büg submerges to seedy El Camino depths
## 
### John Ott Staff writer 
Before we plunge pell-mell into this
week's grab bag of brain teasers, I'd
like to grovel a bit.
You see, it's bad enough that I have
to stare dejectedly into the void 1 call
my post office box on a day-to-day
basis. So, when I am confronted with
an empty Bug questions box (which is
lovingly hand-crafted, 1 might add),
the towering tsunami of rejection that
washes over me is almost enough to
inspire me to end my life by swimming
out to the middle of "Lake" Lag and
eating whatever I find on the murky
bottom.
So, to make this easier for all of you,
I'm opening an electronic mail
account, despite my innate fear of com
puters that is second only to the terror
I experience every time I see, hear or
even think about Scott Baio.
Frankly I'm worried — I can only
hope this doesn't start me along the
Macintosh path of doom that will, in a
few years, cause me to lose sleep over
computer viruses, evaluate people by
their Tetris score and hang out in the
AlRport "just for kicks."
Dear Bug,
Why are live trees mysteriously dis
appearing from in front of the Hoover
House, beside a residence on Campus
Drive East and here and there among

the faculty residences?
Are there alien buzz-saw hands
roaming about campus?
I can only guess that the latter
question relates to that goofy Johnny
Depp "Scissorhands" film. Normally
any reference to someone who appears
in "Tiger Beat" on a regular basis is
immediate grounds for refusal to
answer a question, but, like I said,
there hasn't exactly been an overflow
ing cornucopia of mail lately.
Actually, it would be kind of crazy
(not to mention a possible XTV mini
series) if in University President Don
ald Kennedy's wine cellar lurked some
strange misshapen mutant who would
periodically sneak out at night to mow
down trees. Skeptic that I am, how
ever, I have a hunch that's not the
case. Maybe I just don't watch enough
"Doctor Who."
What I did find out from Herb Fong,
manager of grounds, is that many
trees on campus have suffered greatly
from the colder-than-normal weather
and our old friend, the drought.
Eucalyptus trees in particular have
been damaged by the elements to the
extent that they need to be cut down,
or else they might collapse on their
own and crush the skulls of a group of
visiting dignitaries.
Were action not taken, several tons
of rotting wood could plummet from
tremendous heights to smother help

less infants and flatten kindly old
grandmothers into a bloody paste.
Imagine the tranquil beauty of the
Stanford campus broken by the
anguished screams of the dying, and I
think you'll agree a few trees are a
small price to pay for safety.
Dear Bug,
How long has that motel on El
Camino Real (just after the Stanford
Shopping Center) had that sign that
welcomes "SRI"? Why hasn't it been
changed in at least four years?
— A couple of seniors
At last, the long-awaited chance to
ply my investigative skills outside the
Stanford campus proper. I was so
excited, I almost wet my pants.
And so, without further hesitation,

my two sidekicks and I hopped in the
Biigmobile and made for the Riviera
Motor Lodge, adventure coursing in
our veins. Sure enough, the incrimi
nating letters S-R-I hung mockingly
on the sign, along with the equally
mysterious H-B-O and P-O-O-L. What
could it all mean?
I knocked on the locked office door;
no one answered until a side door
opened a crack to reveal the proprietor
of this den of mystique. Cautiously 1
approached him, stating name and
purpose, but before I could begin to
question him in earnest he stopped me
cold:
"At this time of night? You've got to
be kidding," he told me as he closed the
door, clearly displeased by our choice of
time of visit. I checked my watch:
11:07 p.m. Yes sir, Palo Alto sure does
know how to shake it.
But still the question remained
unanswered. Was he hiding some
thing? What Pandora's box of truths
lay in wait? I pondered these questions
intensely as I headed back to my room.
Then, suddenly, a shot rang out and I
felt the darkness close in about me. . . .
TO BE CONTINUED

The Hug bets that his dad can kick the
Science Hugs' dads' asses any day.
