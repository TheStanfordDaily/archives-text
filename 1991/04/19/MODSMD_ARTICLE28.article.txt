# Juneau? Actually I don't, but Alaska round
## 
### 
It was just my luck. Being raised in
the Great White North for the 24
fake-II) years of my life has been
the greatest experience. Waking up
early to the sound of the dogs yelping,
ready to be hooked up to the sled to
take me to school; the sight of the pure
white snow blanketing the barren tun
dra; and the fresh smell of Folgers
wafting through the igloo.
Alaska's really not like that,
though. Most people like Taster's
Choice better.
And confidential to the moose
breaths who asked me when I first
came to California, Alaska is a state. I
happen to be a citizen who thought
call-waiting meant you had to wait
longer to get your calls. Special thanks
to Communication Services both for
clearing that up and giving me a good
understanding of what bad connec
tions sound like.
Granted, some things in Alaska are
beautifully different. Take schooling.
An integral part of elementary educa
tion is classes on Alaska survival. Two
of my favorites: "How to survive a
moose attack" and "Hypothermia:
warming up." Educationally speaking,
the best thing to do if someone has
hypothermia is to two-person-birth
day-suit-it in a dry sleeping bag. But
take note: The hypothermia-afflicted
boyfriend excuse may not fly with
warm-climate parents.
In school we learned that, if being
chased by a moose, you should slowly
back up while waving your hands and
making funny noises. Of course, what

you do in reality is this: Run away as
fast as you can, flap your arms like a
large-winged, mutant chicken who
thinks it can fly and scream any known
obscenity at the top of your lungs.
And as for moose, I seem to have
had more than my share chase me. I
really hope that it hasn't been a mat
ing season mix-up all these years.
The first time I got to use my moose
deterrent skills was the day a baby
moose appeared in my back yard. Con
vinced that its poor mother suffered
from a "Bambi" ending, I couldn't wait
to bring the fawn inside to show Mom.
I got all bundled up in my fluores
cent orange snowsuit, avocado moon
boots and brown hat — the wonderful
kind that covers everything but your
eyes, but is always deformed so only
your left cheek shows — and went out
side to rescue Bambi.
Music chimed and the world turned

Technicolor as I approached the crea
ture. Unfortunately, I didn't notice its
mother until I saw her. Everything
was fine until I removed my hat to get
a better look. Then the mom got all
scared and started moving toward me.
I was 12 years old and was into the
hair parted down the middle, full on
braces and '70s color wheel. Give me a
break, I'd watched "Grizzly Adams"
just the week before.
Luckily, just then, a male moose
came out of nowhere toward me with a
stray dog chasing after it. The best
part in when the dog became so excited
that it ended up biting me. (I really,
really, hope this isn't a mating thing.)
Rabies shots aren't that bad, but let
me tell you, Bambi-phobia sucks.
I slowly became better able to deal
with the free roaming buffalo of the
North as I grew up. Still, I can remem
ber running down my hill-of-a-drive
way in the school-morning winter
darkness afraid they were waiting to
chase me. Everything was fine until
the time it had iced all night, and I
ended up sliding into the side of the
waiting school bus at the bottom of my
driveway.
My bus driver was really practical,
and noticing that I was permanently
embedded in the side of the bus,
decided to kill two birds with one
stone. By leaving me there, he accom
plished both getting me to school and
teaching me to never be late again. My
face kind of hurt every time we
stopped and the little red flags flew out
from the side. My friends were really

great, though, and helped me pound
out the dents the next day.
Age 16 came, and 1 didn't have to
ride the school bus anymore. Now the
moose could chase me in a car! I
remember well the day the moose
began running toward me head-on
while I was driving to school. But I was
in the driver's seat this time. 1 began
to shout and frantically wave my arms.
Now that I think about it, my arms
were probably partially hidden by the
dashboard. I just wish I had thought
fast enough to roll down the window so
it could hear me.
I feel that over the years I've
matured. This holiday break, 1 finally
felt comfortable enough to walk in sub
zero temperatures in the dark. 1 know,
some may think I'm just asking for a
moose to chase me, but even when it
did happen, I was really able to handle
myself well. I stripped down naked, got
into my sleeping bag and started hud
dling the moose. Darn, I still get the
hypothermia and moose units con
fused.
I love Alaska. Maybe Alaska doesn't
always love me. 1 guess I can't think of
too many people who have seen eaglets
hatch in their back yard, moose frolic
free and threaten to kill you, and peo
ple refer to call-waiting by its original
name — "hold."
And just think, if the fully hypo
thetical, totally just surmising, possi
bly silly childhood spirit of Santa Claus
does come and visit homes during the
holiday season, my house is one of the
first he reaches.
