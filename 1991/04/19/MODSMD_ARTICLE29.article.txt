Eighty-five years ago yesterday would have been
an appropriate day for the lyrics of Carole King, "1
feel the earth move under my feet. ..."
Yes, it's true, the Earthquake of 1906 — the Great
Quake — hit Stanford, leaving the campus looking
similar to the path of the Tasmanian devil. "Begin
ning at about seven minutes past five this morning,
and lasting for twenty seconds, the greatest earth
quake of modern times shook the campus, " described
The Daily.
The devastation was complete, as these Daily
descriptions attest, "Memorial Church . . . practical
ly demolished . . . Library . . . utter loss . . . Memori
al Arch . . . terribly wrecked ..." Two people were
killed, and several injured.
A few days later, University President David dor
dan announced "all class work shall be suspended for
the rest of the college year," and would not resume
until next August. Geology majors were in luck,
though, as Prof. Branner announced a field trip the
next day to study the temblor.
In its final issue, The Daily urged students to
return to campus next year. "If this is done . . the
University will march on to the fulfillment of her
manifest destiny. Let us all be true and loyal . . . and
out of disaster raise a new and more glorious Stan
ford." (However much it may sound like one, this
quote was not made by University President Donald
Kennedy last week in a Dailv interview.)
