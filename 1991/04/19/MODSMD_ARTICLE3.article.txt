# Three groups appear to lose fee requests

### Howard Libit Staff writer 
MEChA, the ASSU lobby office
and XTV appeared to have failed
to receive their special-fee
requests early this morning, with
all of Wednesday's and most of
yesterday's results counted.
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, was losing by approxi
mately 110 votes at 3:30 a.m. Peo
ple's Platform senate candidate
Virginia Rosas, a MEChA mem
ber, said she would not yet give up
hope.
"I am hoping that the vote will
increase and we will be approved,"
said Rosas, a freshman. "It would
be really disappointing if we lost,
but the community would come
together and rally."
Rosas said social and cultural
events funded by MEChA will be
hurt. "We will definitely need a lot
of fund raising to maintain the
programs sponsored by MEChA,"
she said.
Sponsors of the ASSU lobby
office said they were also disap
pointed by the apparent failure of
their fee request, which was losing
by nearly 600 votes early this
morning.
"I think that students simply
didn't understand the purpose of
the lobby office," said People's
Platform Council of Presidents
slate member Jennifer Pearson, a
sponsor of the fee request. " 'Stu
dents First' did a good job of mis
leading the public on the goals of
the office," said Pearson, a junior.
Senior Naomi Onaga, another
sponsor of the lobby office, said,
"It is too bad that a lot of people
did not understand the purpose of
the lobby office. It will hinder the
efforts of people to work on finan
cial aid and we will have to mobi
lize the people to get support."
Pearson said she was unsure
how the lobby office might be
funded next year. "A lot depends
on the COP If 'Stand and Deliver',
wins, we would be committed to
work on the financial-aid issue
and create a financial-aid office
within the ASSU."
Opponents of the lobby office
said they were satisfied by the

result.
"Based upon the preliminary
numbers, I am glad that Stanford
students expressed reservations
on the lobby office," said Students
First graduate senate candidate
Douglas Bone, who filed an official
petition in opposition to the lobby
office.
"I still think that we should put
resources into fighting for finan
cial aid, but this lobby office was
not geared to focus only on finan
cial aid," Bone said.
XTV which ran live election
updates, was also trailing by
nearly 300 votes at 3:30 a.m. in its
bid for a fee request.
"I am now thinking about
other ways to get funding. We lost
two years ago and still managed to
survive," said XTV station man
ager Dave Holland. "People do not

realize how much work it takes to
produce quality video efforts. . . .
But I am not pessimistic about
our ability to continue next year."
Chaparral, the campus humor
magazine, which had failed to
receive a special-fee request every
year since 1981, was winning by
about 300 votes.
"I am phenomenally happy
with the results so far," said Cha
parral Editor in Chief Dave Hyatt,
also a Hammer and Coffin senate
candidate. "We win a fee request
once every 10 years, kind of like
Stanford basketball."
Organizations involved in close
races for special-fee requests last
night included the Black Student
Union, the Stanford Axe Commit
tee and KZSU radio. All three
groups were winning by fewer
than 300 votes.
