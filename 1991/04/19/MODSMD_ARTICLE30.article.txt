## Gymnasts finish fifth at NCAAs Top-seeded Cardinal falters at Penn State 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
"There was just nothing
there."
That was how Stanford
men's gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada summed up his team's
performance last night at the
NCAA championships.
As a result, the top-seeded
Cardinal finished fifth in the
meet and will not compete in
tonight's finals, in which the
top three teams, UCLA, Okla
homa and Penn State, will bat
tle for the national champi
onship.
After its NCAA Western
Regional victory over both the
Bruins and the Sooners, Stan
ford was the odds-on favorite to
win it all.
When it was learned that
freshman sensation Mark
Booth had broken his foot in
that meet, and consequently
would not see action in the
championships, it appeared
that the Cardinal might be
about even with Oklahoma and
UCLA.
But no one expected them to
finish fifth, four points off the
lead and three points behind
fourth-place Minnesota. Min
nesota?
Hamada speculated before
he talked to his team that the
loss of Booth may have been a
bigger loss than expected. "I
think psychologically not hav
ing Mark would make a big
impact. There was a lot of pres
sure on everyone to hit their
routines."
That pressure apparently
affected Stanford in the meet
from beginning to end. "1
didn't see any intensity at the
beginning, and 1 don't know
why," Hamada said. "We
started off wobblv on vault [the

Cardinal's first event], and it
just didn't get any better."
Even Stanford's best gym
nast, sophomore Ail-American
Jair Lynch, was off last night.
Lynch, who was leading the all
around competition at the
time, fell on pommel horse,
normally one of his best events,
and finished a disappointing
seventh. "[Jair's fall) was a big
disappointment, but you still
have to hit your routines no
matter what," Hamada said.
But at least Lynch will com
pete this weekend (individually
on the high bar, parallel bars
and in the all-around). The
same cannot be said of the Car
dinal team, which has only
itself to blame.
"Everyone was about 80
percent, and that's the reason
(that Stanford did not advance
to the finals]," said Hamada.
"They tried hard, but it just
wasn't there."
It had sure looked like it
would be there. According to
Hamada, training in the two
weeks since the regional had
been going very well, and the
Cardinal appeared to be peak
ing just in time for the champi
onships, as Hamada had
planned all season long.
Sure, one can blame the
injury to Booth, or the prob
lems that Tim Rvan had with
his calf, or the deafening Nit
tany Lion crowd, or even the
questionable scoring of the
home team (Penn State had
season bests in almost every
category last night).
Hamada, however, refused
to make excuses. "We just
didn't do our job."
Quite a disappointing state
ment about a team that had
the talent to bring home Stan
ford's first national champi
onship of the year.
