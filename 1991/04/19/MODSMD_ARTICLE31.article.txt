# Spikers meet No. 1 USC on ESPN
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
"lt's do or die." "Our backs are
against the wall." "We're fighting
for our lives."
You've heard all the cliches;
and they'll all be in force for the
Cardinal's men's volleyball
match-up with USC Saturday
night at 6:30 in Maples Pavilion.
The match, the final one of the

regular season, will be broadcast
nationally by ESPN.
Stanford will be playing for a
berth in the Western Intercolle
giate Volleyball Association post
season tournament. And in all
probability, this will be the sce
nario: win — and you're in; lose —
have a nice spring.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, their opponent in this all
important match is the top

ranked and defending national
champion USC Trojans. And
more unfortunate for the Cardi
nal is the fact that for these Tro
jans plays a man named Bryan
Ivie, a man who just might be the
most dominating player that
NCAA volleyball has ever seen.
Last year's NCAA Player of the
Year has led USC to a 24-1 overall
record, and a 15-0 mark in WIVA
play. (The Trojans clinched the
Wilson division title Wednesday
night with a four-game win over
second-ranked Long Beach State.)
Ivie set the WIVA single-season
record for kills in 1990, as he aver
aged 7.81 kills per game while
hitting for a .411 percentage. This
season the middle blocker is hit
ting for a .463 clip and is threaten
ing both his own kills record and
the single-season hitting percent
age mark of .470.
Last weekend in the UCSB
Clash of the Titans tournament,
Ivie led the Trojans to a 15-11, 15-
10, 11-15, 15-13 win over Stan
ford in the championship final,
and garnered Clash MVP honors.
In the title match he had six
blocks, 10 digs and 43 kills for an
awesome .613 hitting percentage.
His performance prompted
excessive adulation from Cardinal
coach Ruben Nieves, "Ivie is just a
phenomenal player. We've got to
do a better job of digging and con
taining him if we are to have a
chance at beating USC."
The Trojan show, however, is
not a one-man act. All of USC's
starting six are returnees from
last year's starting line-up, and
five of the six are seniors. The
lone non-senior? That would be
sophomore middle blocker Jason
Perkins, who, incidentally, just
happens to own the nation's best
hitting percentage at .504. Middle
blocker Kevin Shephard is second
nationally with a .480 clip.
This murderous trio is set to by
senior Dan Greenbaum, who
earned second team all-WIVA
honors last season and is cur
rently averaging .468 on kill
attempts himself. (That's right,
in case you were wondering, Ivie
is only the fourth leading hitter
on his team.)
The Trojans have knocked off
the Cardinal three times this sea

son. Besides the Clash final, USC
claimed a 15-5, 15-6, 15-10 league
win in Los Angeles in March, and
a 15-4, 15-3, 15-3 win in a Jan
uary tournament final.
If the fourth time proves to be
a charm for the Cardinal, they are
nearly assured one of the two
remaining berths in the WIVA
tournament. They would need
only for either llth-ranked Loy
ola Marymount to lose to third
ranked Cal State-Northridge Fri
day or ninth-ranked UC-Santa
Barbara to lose at home against
second-ranked Long Beach State
Saturday.
However, if the Cardinal loses,
it still qualifies with a Loyola loss
coupled with an unlikely UCSB
victory.
Basically, if UCSB, Loyola, and
Stanford all win or all lose, Stan
ford is eliminated and Loyola and
UCSB go to the tournament.

Sophomore Bob Hillman and his teammates will have to go all-out
tomorrow night if they want to upset No. 1 USC. Stanford beat the
Trojans In the final weekend of last season to clinch a spot in the
playoffs, and the Cardinal will probably have to do likewise this year
to extend its season.
