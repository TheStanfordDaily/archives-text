# Stanford baseball hosts UCLA in key three-game series
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Before anybody notices that is
the last-place team in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division and decides it's
not worth the effort to go to Sunken Dia
mond this weekend, consider two things
— 1) Today's game is on ESPN so you
cable folks do not have to leave home any
way, and more importantly, 2) Stanford
coach Mark Marquess is really worried
about these guys.
"(UCLA) can surprise you," said Mar
quess. "You look at their stats and you
wonder why they are losing."
The Bruins (18-22) are currently 5-13
in league play, well behind 11-4 Stanford.
The Cardinal (28-11) beat UCLA 11-7
over spring break at the Oscar Meyer
Baseball Classic due to a 20-hit effort, but
those who read the box score will notice
that the Bruins had 18 of their own.
Though the Bruins are at the bottom of
the Six—Pac barrel, they are third in the
league in hitting with a .323 batting aver

age, and are second in home runs, averag
ing 1.2 a game. UCLA is also the third
best pitching team in the league with a
5.29 ERA, and lead the league in stolen
bases with 86 steals in only 40 games.
"They have lots of ways to hurt you,"
said Marquess. "They present a lot of
problems for us."
Leading the way is left fielder Joel
Wolfe who leads the team with .365 aver
age, and is the top base thief in the Six-
Pac with 29 stolen bases in 37 attempts.
Unfortuanatly, the list does not end
there. Eight of the nine UCLA starters
are batting over .300, with designated hit
ter Ryan McGuire topping the list at .379.
If the game were all offense the Bruins
would probably not be 10 1/2 games out of
first place in the league, but sadly for the
Bruins, teams need more than batting to
win games. The boys from L.A. have not
had quite as much luck in the field, and
are actually the worst defensive team in
the league with the third-most errors
(88), and the fewest double plays (29).
Still, with the Cardinal being the only

team in a position to catch first-place
USC, every game is crucial, and Marquess
takes no chances in underestimating his
opponent. UCLA may have lost 22 games,

but 18 of those contests were decided by
two runs or less. The Bruins are not a bad
team.
"They probably have four or five guys
who are going to be high draft picks; they
are a very talented team," said the coach.
"They are just going through a phase
where they are not playing too well."
Hopefully for the Cardinal, the equiva
lent phase in their own season has come
and gone. After a bad five-game losing
streak in March, Stanford has come back
with a vengence, winning seven of its last
eight Six-Pac games and 11 of 14 overall.
Part of the reason has been the return of
the Cardinal bats.
Ryan Turner started the season out
slowly, but has been on fire of late, hitting
.421 with three home runs and 17 RBI in
his last 16 games. Dave McCarty has been
hot all year and is a candidate for national
Player of the Year honors, and is cur
rently riding a career-high 15-game hit
ting streak. For the season the third base
man is batting .416 with 14 home runs
and 39 RBI and is the owner of an impres

sive .805 slugging percentage.
One of the reasons that McCarty has
been able to have the season he is having
was the move of Jeffrey Hammonds from
lead-off hitter to the clean-up spot. The
move has made it awfully hard for oppos
ing pitchers to pitch around McCarty,
knowing they have Hammonds to face
next. The All-America did not play
against UCLA last time due to a pulled
hamstring, and is only now beginning to
get back into the form that made him
Freshman of the Year last season.
Hammonds is on a five-game hitting
streak and recently clubbed his 10th
homer. He is also the team's second lead
ing batter at .325, but since the injury he
has been slow returning to his high level
of play.
"Hammonds is not completly satisfied
with the way he has been playing, which
says a lot about the expectations placed
on him," said Marquess. "He is getting on
base more, but he hasn't gotten hot yet
Hopefully that will happen in this last
third of the season."

and 39 RBI and is the owner of an impres

sive .805 slugging percentage.
One of the reasons that McCarty has
been able to have the season he is having
was the move of Jeffrey Hammonds from
lead-off hitter to the clean-up spot. The
move has made it awfully hard for oppos
ing pitchers to pitch around McCarty,
knowing they have Hammonds to face
next. The All-America did not play
against UCLA last time due to a pulled
hamstring, and is only now beginning to
get back into the form that made him
Freshman of the Year last season.
Hammonds is on a five-game hitting
streak and recently clubbed his 10th
homer. He is also the team's second lead
ing batter at .325, but since the injury he
has been slow returning to his high level
of play.
"Hammonds is not completly satisfied
with the way he has been playing, which
says a lot about the expectations placed
on him," said Marquess. "He is getting on
base more, but he hasn't gotten hot yet
Hopefully that will happen in this last
third of the season."
