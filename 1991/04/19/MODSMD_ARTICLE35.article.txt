## Palmer finds success with an analytical approach to tennis

You're one of the best. All
everything as a juniors player.
Stellar in singles and doubles. The
consummate team competitor at
the collegiate level. The perfect
addition to the Cardinal stable of
precocious tennis stars.
What gives you the edge? What
separates you from the rest of the
oversized-head-tot'.ng crowd?
Natural talent?
It gives you the early advan
tage.
Hours of practice?
It keeps the product fine
tuned.
An analytical approach?
Yes. Stanford's Jared Palmer
has volleyed to the top of the colle
giate tennis world as much
through print-outs and videos as
forehands and overheads.
"He thinks a lot about tennis.
He's really a student of the
game," said Stanford asst. coach
John Whitlinger. "He's definitely
one of those guys who spends a lot
of time reviewing video tapes of
his matches, studying his shots,
checking the fine points of his
game visually."
"I've gotten into studying the
game here," Palmer said. "1 com
pare printouts from a Sony cat

cam camera trying to see what I'm
doing wrong and what I'm doing
right. It's helped with a lot of my
strokes."
The hours in the video room
have paid off Just a sophomore,
Palmer is playing at the No. 2 sin
gles position for the Cardinal, and
is half of Stanford's — and possi
bly the country's — best doubles
duo.
Last year he compiled a 26-7
singles record while competing
mostly at the No. 2 and 3 spots,
and lobbed his way into the NCAA
singles semifinals after helping
bring the Cardinal its third con
secutive national crown. He and
fellow super-frosh Jonathan
Stark also advanced to the dou
bles semis.
All this after two knee surg
eries — one in January and
another in April.
"The knee surgeries slowed
him down but he's just a tremen
dous, tremendous talent," Whit
linger said.
Two national semifinal berths
last May make it appear that
Palmer's gimpy knees did not
affect his performance too much.
They definitely have not slowed
the dark-haired, often-smiling
player this year.
Midway through the dual
match season, Palmer is 13-5 in

singles play, and is currently
ranked No. 17. He and Stark also
won the Pacific Coast Doubles
Tournament in February — in
their first matches together after
Stark's return from a stress frac
ture.
Not shabby in the least.
But Palmer isn't exactly satis
fied.
"It hasn't been great. I've come
up short in a few matches —
although I'm not really concerned
up to this point," Palmer
explained.
Palmer's preoccupation with
the mental angle of the game may
have actually been slowing him
down lately.
Once in a game a tennis player
is supposed to be on autopilot,
reacting to the shots zinging
across the net. But Palmer has

Sophomore Jared Palmer has always been one of the most talented players around, but his ability to
analyze his own, and his opponents', games has taken him all the way to the top. He has played No. 2
singles for the Cardinal all season and teams with Jonathan Stark to form perhaps the nation's best dou
bles tandem.
