# Martin leads golfers into big tourney

October, 1989.
That's when the Quake
interrupted the Stanford way
of life.
It's also the last time the
men's golf team captured the
U.S. Intercollegiate Golf Tour
nament held on the Stanford
Golf Course.
Early this morning, fresh
man Casey Martin teed off to
lead the Cardinal in the first
day of the three-day tourney
that, with 24 teams, is the
largest collegiate tournament
next to the NCAA champi
onships.
"There's a lot of depth in
this field," said coach Wally
Goodwin. "It's going to be a
whale of an event."
However, the 24th-ranked
Cardinal will have its share of
sand traps and water hazards
to avoid, confronting the likes
of No. 1 Arizona State, No. 2
North Carolina, No. 3 Arizona,
No. 4 Oklahoma State and No.
6 Florida, not to mention top
-10 teams USC, UCLA, and
Texas-El Paso — each of which
beat Stanford in last week's
Etonic Southwest Intercolle
giate Golf Tournament.
"We'd be thrilled to finish in
the top 10," said Goodwin.
The Cardinal is pinning its
hopes on the shoulders of a
young team with little colle
giate experience but a lot of
grit.
Making his debut at the No.
1 slot for the Cardinal, Martin
leads a cast composed of junior
Christian Cevaer, freshman
Notah Begay, sophomore Mike
Milliken and junior Chris

Doble.
"I've had my eye on this
tournament all year because
the field is so incredible," Mar
tin said. "It is a real privilege to
have this tournament on our
home course."
Ever modest and humble
spoken, no one would imagine
that he is anything other than
a fabulous golfer — which he
is.
But he is a golfer who has
overcome extreme physical
adversity to get to his current
position on the Cardinal golf
team.
Born without a deep veinous
system in his right leg, he has a
vascular deficiency that causes
his leg to swell exceedingly.
"Blood goes down my leg,
but it doesn't return to my
heart," said Martin.
His leg was even set in a cast
as a child, but now he sup
presses the swelling by wearing
a full-length nylon stocking.
"There's hardly any carti
lage in my right leg," he said. "I
have some internal bleeding
and it hurts a lot."
"I thought of having some
veins stripped, but a man lost
his leg during the same kind of
condition," said Martin. "So
it's just something I've dealt
with."
Martin dabbled around in
other sports as a youngster, but
he concentrated his energies on
golf and "it's paid off." A native
of Eugene, Ore., Martin won
the Oregon state title as a
junior in high school and was
runner-up by a stroke in his
senior campaign.
However, golf was not as
easy for him as the titles seem to
illustrate.
"When I was 14 or 15, there
was a real question of whether or
not I could continue playing,"
said Martin. "I don't know whyi
but my leg has gotten progres-t
sively better."
Just in time for Stanford, the
swelling in Martin's right leg has
subsided the most in recent mem
ory.
"At times, my leg hurts," said
Martin. "Sometimes I have to
take a cart, but normally I'll walk
because it's the only exercise that
I get."
"Casey doesn't feel comfort
able if we're walking and He
isn't," said the veteran Cevaer. "It
may hurt him, but he sticks it
out."
