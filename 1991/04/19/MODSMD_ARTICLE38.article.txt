# Willens staves off sophomore slump
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
One of sport's great bugaboos
is known simply as the Sopho
more Jinx. Those afflicted by this
curse experience sensational
rookie campaigns and find them
selves facing lofty expectations as
they enter their second season.
It is then that the Sophomore
Jinx, cruel master of the fates that
it is, takes these athletes and
sends them crashing back to real
ity.
Heather Willens seemed like a
perfect candidate. She was not
expected to start during her fresh
man season a year ago. Still, Wil
lens made the lineup and compiled
a superb record playing primarily
No. 6 singles.
The Jinx was poised to pounce
in 1991. The headlines were being
written at the Devil's Daily:
"Flash-in-the-pan frosh sensation
falls flat." But like her opponents,
the Jinx proved to be no match for
the Los Angeles native.
Willens not only failed to fail,
she has taken her game to a new
level and is now one of the top 20
players in the nation.
There is a little-talked-of dis
tinction between the so-called
blue chippers and the rest of col
lege tennis. Normally, most play
ers are placed in one group or the
other â€” and they stay there.
Meet Heather Willens, a player
whose talents are anything but
normal. After a summer of hard
work, she returned to school hav
ing crossed over into the elite.
For her own part, Willens
hasn't noticed much change. "1
don't really think that I made dra
matic improvement," she says.
"This year, when I came back 1
realized that I could play with
some of these girls."
"These girls" include the likes
of Georgia's Shannan McCarthy
and Arizona's Danielle Scott, both
of whom are ranked among the

top 12 in the latest Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate poll. McCarthy
and Scott were both defeated by
Willens at the Riviera All-Ameri
can Tournament this fall. In that
event, which served as a coming
out party for the new, improved
Willens, she entered as a wildcard
and exited as a semifinalist.
"She had a great run at Riv
iera," says Lele Forood, the assis
tant women's tennis coach. "It
solidified her position as a player
to be reckoned with in college ten
nis.
"In our mind, she had come
back to school and was a different
player. We changed our thoughts
on where she was going to play in
the lineup."
The result was that Willens
won the No. 4 spot in the lineup
during the challenge matches. At
one point, she even defeated San
dra Birch, the Cardinal's No. 1
player.
Forood offered a theory as to
why Willens was able to make the
jump: "She gained a lot of confi
dence by winning a lot of matches
in college." And she didn't win
them for just any school; she won
them for a dominant NCAA titlist.
"You realize that you factor
into winning championships
because your match is as impor
tant as any other match," Forood
says. "You start seeing people and
not being impressed by them."
Logic then dictates, as Forood
notes, "Not only can I win at six, I
can win at three or four."
And she has won at No. 4. Fif
teen times, in fact, against just
five losses. Four of the defeats

came on consecutive days at the
National Team Indoors at the
beginning of March. "That's hap
pened to me a couple times
before," says Willens of the losing
skein. "Sometimes, when I'm
really on a roll, I start to look
behind mo.

"1 think, 'I'm playing too well,
something has to go wrong,' " So
she lost her confidence and sev
eral matches as well. Since then,
Willens has returned to form and
rediscovered her enjoyment for

After a great freshman season, Heather Willens has continued to be
