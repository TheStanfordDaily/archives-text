# Fac Sen to consider faculty domestic-partners privileges
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A proposal was introduced in the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday to offer gay and les
bian partners of University employees the
same benefits currently accorded spouses
of faculty and staff.
The proposal, which is scheduled for
formal debate next month, urges the

administration to extend several benefits
to domestic partners of Stanford employ
ees, including:
• Reduced tuition for children attend
ing the University,
• Accident insurance,
• Dental and medical plans, and
• Use of University libraries and ath
letic facilities.
Proponents of the measure say it

would correct a blatant violation of the
University's policy of nondiscrimination
based on sexual orientation.
The proposal comes several months
after the University extended married
housing privileges to students with
domestic partners. The move was consid
ered a major victory by the gay commu
nity but was denounced as offensive by
dozens of students and alumni.

The extension of faculty and staff ben
efits would be much more expensive for
the University since it involves medical
and insurance plans. The senate voted
yesterday to send the proposal to a com
mittee for examination of these concerns.
Several faculty members charged that
the process set up to consider the pro
posal is unfair.
Under senate rules, resolutions passed

by the ASSU or petitions signed by more
than 50 faculty members may be placed
on the Faculty Senate's agenda for discus
sion.
The ASSU Senate approved a bill Feb.
21 calling for the University to provide
equal benefits to University employees in
long-term, same-gender relationships.
Subsequently, 71 faculty mem
bers signed a petition calling for
introduction of a similar bill in
the Faculty Senate.
But instead of allowing senate
members to discuss the bill yes
terday, the senate's steering com
mittee offered an alternate
motion that recommended send
ing the bill directly to committee
for a determination of potential
costs.
Senate chair Charles Kruger
then limited discussion of the
steering committee's motion to
20 minutes.
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee
said the prescribed procedure
amounted to "implicitly repudiat
ing" the proposal. History Prof.
Peter Stansky accused Kruger
and the steering committee of
"stonewalling" the issue.
The author of the bill, Prof.
Katherine O'Hanlan, said she had
hoped to receive "a vote of princi
ple" from the senate before costs
of implementation were analyzed.
Provost James Rosse said he
backed the steering committee's
motion. Because of the technical
legal concerns involved, he said,
faculty members should have as
much information as possible

before expressing an opinion.
The steering committee's
motion to send the bill to commit
tee passed on a divided voice vote.
In other senate business, Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Joseph
Goodman offered a preliminary
view of proposed changes in the
committee structure of the sen
ate. The changes, being consid
ered by an ad hoc senate commit
tee, could be implemented next
year.
Currently, the senate has
seven standing committees
responsible for oversight and pol
icy on academic matters. Under
the working proposal revealed by
Goodman, the seven committees
would be collapsed into three.
The proposal also calls for the
creation of a Long-Range Plan
ning and Policy Committee which
would provide a venue for faculty
members to consider longer-term
University policy issues.
After considering faculty feed
back, Goodman will present a
revised proposal at a future sen
ate meeting.
Earlier in yesterday's meeting,
Stansky objected to the impend
ing destruction of three row
houses damaged in the Earth
quake of 1989. The decision to
tear down Synergy, Phi Psi and
the Delta Tau Delta house
amounts to "an act of historical
vandalism," Stansky said.
