# Fac Sen to consider faculty domestic-partners privileges
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A proposal was introduced in the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday to offer gay and les
bian partners of University employees the
same benefits currently accorded spouses
of faculty and staff.
The proposal, which is scheduled for
formal debate next month, urges the

administration to extend several benefits
to domestic partners of Stanford employ
ees, including:
• Reduced tuition for children attend
ing the University,
• Accident insurance,
• Dental and medical plans, and
• Use of University libraries and ath
letic facilities.
Proponents of the measure say it

would correct a blatant violation of the
University's policy of nondiscrimination
based on sexual orientation.
The proposal comes several months
after the University extended married
housing privileges to students with
domestic partners. The move was consid
ered a major victory by the gay commu
nity but was denounced as offensive by
dozens of students and alumni.

The extension of faculty and staff ben
efits would be much more expensive for
the University since it involves medical
and insurance plans. The senate voted
yesterday to send the proposal to a com
mittee for examination of these concerns.
Several faculty members charged that
the process set up to consider the pro
posal is unfair.
Under senate rules, resolutions passed

by the ASSU or petitions signed by more
than 50 faculty members may be placed
on the Faculty Senate's agenda for discus
sion.
The ASSU Senate approved a bill Feb.
21 calling for the University to provide
equal benefits to University employees in
long-term, same-gender relationships.
