# Early start helps Hubbard be the best
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
When Michael Jordan says, "Better eat
your Wheaties," Alysia Hubbard is probably
on her second bowl. When Nike shouts, "Just
do it!" Hubbard already has it done.
While growing up the Stanford sprinter and
jumper could have been the Gatorade
spokesperson for all the experience she has
had in sports.
"I have an athletic family," Hubbard said,
understating things a bit. Her father played
baseball and football at Temple University,
coached both sports and ran a tennis program
in Philadelphia.
"I'm not a boy. I can't play baseball or foot
ball. My dad did gymnastics. I did gymnastics.
My dad did tennis. I did tennis. My dad skied.
I skied. My dad did track. I did track. So I did
all the other sports.
"I hung around baseball and football prac
tice. I showed more interest in athletics than
my older brother did," the senior said.
While in high school she dropped gymnas
tics and skiing to focus on tennis and track.
The choice to quit the slopes, however, was not
her own.
"My (track) coach said, 'Do you have a
scholarship, yet?' I said, 'No.' 'Then you're not
going skiing. Do you know how much each of
your legs are worth?'"
By that time track was becoming more and
more a part of Hubbard's life. She trained with
a local club team and traveled to national age
group meets, competing against top prep track
athletes in the country.
She didn't get this sort of competition from
her high school team. "My high school pro
gram stunk. I was the fastest from the 100 to
800 (meters)" she said.
Hubbard decided to train herself during
after-school practices, which meant planning
her workout and timing herself everyday.

"I think only somebody really self-moti
vated can do that," she said, "That's where I
get a lot of my determination from, my mental
toughness. When you have a coach there you
can leave everything in their hands."
Such a competitor naturally caught the
eyes of college scouts. Hubbard eventually
chose Stanford over Harvard and Virginia.
"When I came tto Stanford) on my recruit
ing trip I felt right at home," she said.
Because of that Hubbard didn't have the
typical adjustment problems of first-year stu
dents. "The freshman were whining, 'I'm
homesick.' I was having a ball.
"They called their moms nine or ten times a
day. My mom called me. 'Are you OK?' she
said. 'Yeah, fine,' I said."
Other things did change for Hubbard. She
was part of a track team that shared her talent
and determination. She became the nucleus of
the women's sprint and jump squad which
now includes juniors Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards.
"Basically [coach Brooks Johnsonl told me
to keep an eye on them. Their freshman year I
tried to help them avoid the pitfalls I might
have gone into. Now we're very supportive of
each other," Hubbard said.
"Alysia is a mother hen. If someone is hurt
she's the one to tell us," said asst. coach Betsy
Riccardi.
"I've always been like that, even in high
school. I was the one people came to when they
had problems. One of my friends said I was
like a hospital. People come in. I patch them up
and I send them on their way," Hubbard said.
Her caring attitude helps the sprint relay
team. Hubbard, Edwards, Gaines and sopho
more Rhonda Oliver make up the 4 by 100
squad.
"With a relay team it's important to be
close. You almost have to be like one person,"
she said.
Their closeness also increases the pressure

to run well in the relay. "If you mess up the
relay, you're messing up three other people. It
compounds the disappointment," Hubbard
said.
Although a good sprinter and triple jumper,
her favorite event is the long jump. "I always
said I came to college to play in the sand," she
said with a smile.
The technical aspects of the long jump
appeals to her. "You always have a tendency to
run, stop, then jump. It's a really hard con
cept, you have to run off the board. It's almost
unnatural.
"You might think you're going too fast but
you're not. You have to be flying when you hit
the board and you have to keep going instead
of 'Oh god, it's time to jump. Now let me pre
pare,' " Hubbard said.
She enjoys track for more than the opportu
nity to perfect her sport. "I don't know how
other students deal with their stress. That's
always been my release, go out and run myself
into submission," she said.
It also helps that teammates have some of
the same problems. All the athletes have to
deal with difficult classes, no extra time and
tough practices .
"When you go through some workouts and
you're dying, these are bonding experiences. It
gives you a lot in common, really helps to
strengthen relationships," Hubbard said.
Hubbard admits that track can sometimes
be an added stress, especially this year. Until
last week's 19-feet, 9-inch leap the All-Pacific
10 Conference performer has been well under
20 feet all season.
Despite this, she plans to enjoy competing
during the last few weeks of the season, know
ing the meets could be her last.
Regardless of what role sprinting and jump
ing will play in her future, athletics are in her
blood. She will likely be at high speed whether
on the track, the tennis court, or the ski slopes.

said. 'Yeah, fine,' I said."
Other things did change for Hubbard. She
was part of a track team that shared her talent
and determination. She became the nucleus of
the women's sprint and jump squad which
now includes juniors Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards.
"Basically [coach Brooks Johnsonl told me
to keep an eye on them. Their freshman year I
tried to help them avoid the pitfalls I might
have gone into. Now we're very supportive of
each other," Hubbard said.
"Alysia is a mother hen. If someone is hurt
she's the one to tell us," said asst. coach Betsy
Riccardi.
"I've always been like that, even in high
school. I was the one people came to when they
had problems. One of my friends said I was
like a hospital. People come in. I patch them up
and I send them on their way," Hubbard said.
Her caring attitude helps the sprint relay
team. Hubbard, Edwards, Gaines and sopho
more Rhonda Oliver make up the 4 by 100
squad.
"With a relay team it's important to be
close. You almost have to be like one person,"
she said.
Their closeness also increases the pressure

to run well in the relay. "If you mess up the
relay, you're messing up three other people. It
compounds the disappointment," Hubbard
said.
Although a good sprinter and triple jumper,
her favorite event is the long jump. "I always
said I came to college to play in the sand," she
said with a smile.
The technical aspects of the long jump
appeals to her. "You always have a tendency to
run, stop, then jump. It's a really hard con
cept, you have to run off the board. It's almost
unnatural.
"You might think you're going too fast but
you're not. You have to be flying when you hit
the board and you have to keep going instead
of 'Oh god, it's time to jump. Now let me pre
pare,' " Hubbard said.
She enjoys track for more than the opportu
nity to perfect her sport. "I don't know how
other students deal with their stress. That's
always been my release, go out and run myself
into submission," she said.
It also helps that teammates have some of
the same problems. All the athletes have to
deal with difficult classes, no extra time and
tough practices .
"When you go through some workouts and
you're dying, these are bonding experiences. It
gives you a lot in common, really helps to
strengthen relationships," Hubbard said.
Hubbard admits that track can sometimes
be an added stress, especially this year. Until
last week's 19-feet, 9-inch leap the All-Pacific
10 Conference performer has been well under
20 feet all season.
Despite this, she plans to enjoy competing
during the last few weeks of the season, know
ing the meets could be her last.
Regardless of what role sprinting and jump
ing will play in her future, athletics are in her
blood. She will likely be at high speed whether
on the track, the tennis court, or the ski slopes.

Every since she was a little kid, Alysia Hubbard has participated in a
wide variety of sports. Now, as a senior long jumper on the Cardinal
track and field team, Hubbard's favorite pastime has become play
ing In the sand.
When Michael Jordan says, "Better eat
your Wheaties," Alysia Hubbard is probably
on her second bowl. When Nike shouts, "Just
do it!" Hubbard already has it done.
While growing up the Stanford sprinter and
jumper could have been the Gatorade
spokesperson for all the experience she has
had in sports.
"I have an athletic family," Hubbard said,
understating things a bit. Her father played
baseball and football at Temple University,
coached both sports and ran a tennis program
in Philadelphia.
"I'm not a boy. I can't play baseball or foot
ball. My dad did gymnastics. I did gymnastics.
My dad did tennis. I did tennis. My dad skied.
I skied. My dad did track. I did track. So I did
all the other sports.
"I hung around baseball and football prac
tice. I showed more interest in athletics than
my older brother did," the senior said.
While in high school she dropped gymnas
tics and skiing to focus on tennis and track.
The choice to quit the slopes, however, was not
her own.
"My (track) coach said, 'Do you have a
scholarship, yet?' I said, 'No.' 'Then you're not
going skiing. Do you know how much each of
your legs are worth?'"
By that time track was becoming more and
more a part of Hubbard's life. She trained with
a local club team and traveled to national age
group meets, competing against top prep track
athletes in the country.
She didn't get this sort of competition from
her high school team. "My high school pro
gram stunk. I was the fastest from the 100 to
800 (meters)" she said.
Hubbard decided to train herself during
after-school practices, which meant planning
her workout and timing herself everyday.

"I think only somebody really self-moti
vated can do that," she said, "That's where I
get a lot of my determination from, my mental
toughness. When you have a coach there you
can leave everything in their hands."
Such a competitor naturally caught the
eyes of college scouts. Hubbard eventually
chose Stanford over Harvard and Virginia.
"When I came tto Stanford) on my recruit
ing trip I felt right at home," she said.
Because of that Hubbard didn't have the
typical adjustment problems of first-year stu
dents. "The freshman were whining, 'I'm
homesick.' I was having a ball.
"They called their moms nine or ten times a
day. My mom called me. 'Are you OK?' she
said. 'Yeah, fine,' I said."
Other things did change for Hubbard. She
