around the Inner Quad and
performances in front of
Memorial Church.
The event is meant to
heighten student involvement

Labor agreement
reached at Daily Cal
The debt-ridden Daily Cali
fornian, UC-Berkeley's news
paper, earlier this week called a
truce in a battle with its unions
that has dragged on for more
than a year.
On Monday, the indepen

dently operated newspaper and
the Bay Area Typographical
Union tentatively completed
contract negotiations that gave
additional benefits to the
union. Workers had been
threatening to strike unless
they were given a pay raise.
The demand for a raise ran
kled management at the Daily
Cal, which was $200,000 in
debt before the recession hit,
said Editor in Chief Cedric
Puleston.
Ad revenues, the paper's
primary source of income,
plummeted with the recession.
As a result, the the newspaper
couldn't reach an agreement
with its printer, Fricke-Parks
Press. Most of the debt is for
printing.
The newspaper receives no
financial backing from the uni
versity.
Puleston said union wages
had increased by 22 percent in
the past 18 months.
According to typesetter
Phyllis Dantzler, "The general
management fof the paperl was
hesitant to make an agree
ment."
