# From aborigine tribe to Stanford dorm
## World travels of Australian pro fro deposit her on the Farm 
### Komail Thaver 
After graduating from high
school in Perth, Australia, in
1987, Dee Bourbon spent time liv
ing with an aborigine tribe, travel
ing around Southeast Asia and
working with a corporate bank, in
a hotel and as a gourmet chef in
San Diego.
Now she has finally found a
home.
The 21-year-old Australian is a
prospective freshman staying in
Alondra this week.
"When I first came here, I was
98 percent decided on Stanford,"
says Bourbon, the other choices
being Harvard, Princeton and
Yale Universities. "Now," she says
with a twinkle in her eye, "it's
going to be 100 percent for Stan
ford."
"Besides, I went to a psychic in
San Diego and she told me that I
would be heading north for col
lege!" she adds.
But why would Bourbon want
to go to school in America? "Amer
ica's such a melting pot," she
replies in her crisp Australian-
Southern Californian accent.
"America's diversity, secular
ism and freedom fascinate me and
make school here very different

'I really have a lot to
learn and Stanford
seems to be the right
place.'

from that in Australia. I have
wanted to come here ever since I
was 11."
But there are other, more mys
tical reasons as well. As an
inducted member of an aborigine
tribe, her totem spirit was a dog,
"a sort of guiding spirit — the abo
rigines believe in discovering the
deeper essence of this world
through animal spirits," she says.
"One night in 1988, I had a
dream about American Indians
and wild dogs. It was as if some
thing was pulling me toward
America. The next morning I
bought a plane ticket to Los
Angeles and came right away."
She said she was shocked by
Los Angeles' size and poverty. "I
never expected any American city
to have any beggars. ... LA had so
many. I was very shocked. Aus
tralia is pretty strong on its wel
fare program despite our not hav
ing a lot of money."
She found San Diego cleaner

and a lot like Perth. She has been
working there for the last two
years. Bourbon said she eventu
ally decided, "I have to start col
lege," and went on to be accepted
by all the schools of her choice.
"Sometimes people look down
on you just because you don't
have a college degree.... I really
have a lot to learn and Stanford
seems to be the right place."
Like most other prospective
freshmen, she was also entranced
by the Farm's sunshine and

relaxed atmosphere. She com
pleted her Stanford application
before those for other schools.
"My Stanford application essay
was my first piece of creative writ
ing in four years," she says.
She has no regrets over her
experiences and adventures. "Had
I gone to college right after finish
ing high school, I would have been
a psychology major and would
have been graduating by now.
Now, I find environmental science
and international business more
interesting.
"This time has also given me
the opportunity to look around,
meet people and have fun."
Brt at times, Bourbon feels
homesick for Australia. "I cooked
a traditional Australian meal for a
friend of mine and I really missed
home as we ate it." Bourbon plans
to go back to visit her family
sometime next year.
She says she will use the last
few months left before school to
travel around the country with an
old Australian friend, "singing for
supper and seeing the Midwest."
And she already has plans for
when she arrives at Stanford.
Bourbon, who says she is an excel
lent cook, wants to start an inter
national kitchen here.
