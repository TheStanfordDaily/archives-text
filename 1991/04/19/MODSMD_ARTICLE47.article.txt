# Tainted beverages found
## Police investigate two incidents of contamination 
### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Residents of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity have found
tainted beverages in their house
on two occasions this week.
On Tuesday, a "nauseous,
nasty green substance" was dis
covered in a pot of coffee, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. Nobody drank the cof
fee, he added.
The next day, Niemeyer said,
resident assistant Jeff Iwasaki
drank a glass of grape juice from
the refrigerator in the fraternity's
kitchen and found it tasted as
though there was some sort of oily
substance in it.
Iwasaki, who was not available
for comment, spit out the juice,
Niemeyer said.
The police are currently inves
tigating the contents of the coffee
and the grape juice. Jason
Mosakowski, a resident of the
house, said the substance has
been analyzed and found to be
either a type of pesticide or lighter

'No one inside the
house would do such
a cruel thing, espe
cially since it could
affect themselves.'

fluid.
"It was turquoise green crys
talline . . . little green rocks," he
said.
Mosakowski said he believes
that the foreign substances were
introduced to the drinks by an
non-resident of the house. "No
one inside the house would do
such a cruel thing, especially since
it could affect themselves," he
said.
The fraternity members called
an emergency house meeting at 9
p.m. Wednesday evening to dis
cuss the incident. They are con
cerned that they will have to
tighten house security in the

future.
"It is nice to have an open
house, but we don't have an ideal
society here," said senior Van Per
rigo, a fraternity member. "We are
a little nervous, but we don't want
to freak out or anything," he said.
Director of the Row Jack Chin
said that certain commonplace
precautions will be taken to
increase security and that frater
nity residents "will be a little bit
more careful about food [and will]
pay attention to [the] place being
locked up."
He said he does not feel that
"anything more needs to be done,
[especially since the incident]
could be something that just hap
pened accidentally."
Malicious and dangerous inci
dents have occurred in the past at
the fraternity house, Mosakowski
said. "Once someone came in,
turned on all the gas and blew out
all the pilot lights in the kitchen,"
he said. The incident could have
resulted in a major explosion but
was discovered before any
harm could result.
