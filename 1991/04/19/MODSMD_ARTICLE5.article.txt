# Kennedy reassures senators on costs
## 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Staff writers 
The ASSU Senate heard spiels
from University President Donald
Kennedy and ASSU Financial
Manager Torrence Boone but
voted on few bills during last
night's meeting.
The indirect-cost controversy
dominated Kennedy's quarterly
visit to the senate.
Kennedy said that while nego
tiations over the new indirect-cost
rate will end soon, "the next
announcement will be the end of
the chapter, not the end of the
book," since further discussion
may change the final rate.
Responding to concerns that
financial problems will lead to
program cuts, Kennedy assured
senators that there will be "no
fast moves" and added that he
"would doubt seriously that one
would see a wholesale reduction of
majors."
In what Kennedy called the one
piece of good news he had to offer,
he said graduate tuition currently
funded by indirect costs of
research will not be adversely
affected.
Kennedy also said he does not
believe any contracts have been

lost due to the controversy.
"There is also no evidence that
government agencies are disfavor
ing Stanford," he said.
He stressed the importance of
maintaining Stanford's "good
name" outside campus. "This is a
national university and it needs
credibility everywhere," Kennedy
said. The University "is repre
senting itself as reform-minded
and it is."
Kennedy also responded to con
cerns about a University policy
that does not allow additional fra

ternity housing. "We are not
intending to add to housing with
selective residential policies," he
said.
After Kennedy spoke, the sen
ate spent more than 90 minutes in
open forum with community
members. Most of the time was
dedicated to discussion of a bill
that would end the ASSU's affilia
tion with the United States Stu
dent Association because of an
allegedly discriminatory affirma
tive-action policy.
No vote was taken on the bill.

Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, said the policy was not a
quota system but a way for the
association to ensure "inclusion."
In his financial manager's
report, Boone presented the
annual audit of the ASSU
finances, responding to many
complaints about the size of cer
tain accounts.
Boone called the $2.67 million
in assets "very, very good," saying
they justify the huge liabilities the
ASSU assumes in dealing with

student organizations.
He also said the special buffer
fund and program-board reserve
are "not slush funds" but are sav
ings accounts for the special-fee
system. Boone also promised to
decrease the size of these funds
next year.
The ASSU made more than
$100,000 this year from interest
off its endowment and from huge
gains realized from the one-time
sale of a special fund.
In other action last night, the
senate approved a request from

the Speaker's Bureau to sponsor a
talk by playwright Neil Simon.
Simon, who will receive $3,000,
will speak May 13 at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
A bill calling for the immediate
suspension and reappraisal of a
new Humanities and Sciences
graduate minority-fellowship pol
icy also passed by a divided vote.
Several graduate senators
charged that the new policy will
actually decrease the number of
minority students admitted to
graduate programs.
