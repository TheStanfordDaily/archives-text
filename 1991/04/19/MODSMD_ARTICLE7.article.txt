## Undeclared undergrads lured to 'Majors Event' 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
"You better get working on those electrical engi
neering classes quickly!" threatened a short, dark
haired man with thick glasses bearing a gEEk but
ton on his chest. "That'll keep you on a good,
straight path," he added from his post behind a pam
phlet-cluttered table.
"Right now I'm trying to get all the core classes
out of the way — the Physics 60 series, the honors
calculus series, all my DRs finished by the end of my
freshman year," responded a self-assured young
woman, plunging her hand into the basket of gEEk
pins.
Conversations like these were a common part of
yesterday's Majors Event, which transformed the
Inner Quad into a bustling marketplace of under
classmen in serious pursuit of a and even
some shoppers just out for a few bargains — compli
mentary buttons and free food.
Students and faculty from various departments
set up seductive booths from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. to
attract students and inform them about their pro
grams. Almost all of the tables offered pins, ranging
from the risque — "Let's get geophysical!" — to the
profound — "I think therefore I am a philosophy
m^jor."
Some booths' offerings could only be connected to
academic fields by wild stretches of the imagination.
Did the melted Hershey kisses on the chemistry
table perhaps demonstrate the reaction that takes
place when chocolate receives the
noontime rays of the sun?
Other tables, however, fea
tured fare that captured the fla
vor of the msyor. For example, the
anthropology table offered blue
corn tortilla chips. "This is the
Native American corn variety,
since we're in.erested in native
cultures," said Jean Wilson, the
anthropology student services
coordinator.
The Asian languages major
booth had a display of 12 glass
animals. In China, this is the year
of the sheep," said graduate stu
dent Katheryn Potterf. "I'm
really excited about it because I'm
a sheep," she bleated with pride.
While the table attracted a few
recruits, Japanese businesspeople
visiting the campus came in much
larger numbers, Potterf said.
"They stand [near] the table and
laugh. I think they're amused by
us," she added.
The Urban Studies Depart
ment bypassed the allure of food
and buttons altogether, instead
establishing on its table a Play
Doh city. Behind the table sat

senior Mario Sandler, molding
houses and inviting students to
"add a building."
Let out early from her Fresh
man English class, Jessica Schul
man joined the many freshmen at
the event."The pamphlets really
do it for me," she said. "That way
I don't have to bother talking to
all of the people from the depart
ments."
"Everyone here is trying to
bribe me. The gummy worms are
doing a good job!" she said, ges
turing at the biological sciences
table.
Freshman Tony Shen said that
since Stanford offers so many
majors, the event is an excellent
way to get a lot of information
quickly. "It's a neat way to get
people exposed," he said.
Coordinator Kathy Wright of
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter characterized the event as "a
warm and friendly entree into
more serious discussions." She
said the event is geared toward
freshmen, since "sophomores
really need to be thinking more
seriously. They should go to the
UAC to talk with the advisers,"
she added.
Graduate student Kathy Vitz
was among the participants who
didn't fall into Wright's scheme.

"I come here every year for the
food," she said between bites of
her cookie.
The 14 students visiting Stan
ford from the Soviet Union per
haps enjoyed the event more than
anybody. "These pins will make
great souvenirs for friends,"
exclaimed several of them.
Another appraised the event
with cynicism, "Do they really
think that people will choose
majors on the basis of who is giv
ing out the best candy?"
Deana Fabbro-Johnston, stu
dent services officer in human
biology, said she was disturbed by
the attitude of many prospective
freshmen at the event. "They
were all stressing over majors.
They should just be concentrating
on the important things in their
lives right now, like their high
schools' senior balls," she said.
By next year, a computer pro
gram that made its debut yester
day may render the Majors Event
itself obsolete. Beginning next
fall, the Undergraduate Advising
Center will feature
"Major Quest", a newly developed
computer program that will pro
vide students with access to infor
mation about majors, advising,
overseas studies and undergradu
ate research.

with cynicism, "Do they really
think that people will choose
majors on the basis of who is giv
ing out the best candy?"
Deana Fabbro-Johnston, stu
dent services officer in human
biology, said she was disturbed by
the attitude of many prospective
freshmen at the event. "They
were all stressing over majors.
They should just be concentrating
on the important things in their
lives right now, like their high
schools' senior balls," she said.
By next year, a computer pro
gram that made its debut yester
day may render the Majors Event
itself obsolete. Beginning next
fall, the Undergraduate Advising
Center will feature
"Major Quest", a newly developed
computer program that will pro
vide students with access to infor
mation about majors, advising,
overseas studies and undergradu
ate research.
