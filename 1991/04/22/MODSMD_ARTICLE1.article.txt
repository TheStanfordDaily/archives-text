# Lecturer placed on leave
## Reges to be investigated for violation of drug policy 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stuart Reges, an award-win
ning senior lecturer in computer
science, was placed on paid admin
istrative leave last week after
admitting in a series of letters
that he violates the University's
drug and alcohol policy to protest
governmental invasion of privacy.
University President Donald
Kennedy, after receiving a warn
ing from national drug czar Bob
Martinez, has called for an inves
tigation that is to begin today.
Reges, who called U.S. drug
education "indoctrination, not
education," admitted in "inten
tionally provocative" letters to
government officials that he car
ries illegal drugs in his backpack
in defiance of the University's
drug and alcohol policy. The 1989
Drug-Free Schools and Communi
ties Act stipulates that, in order to

receive federal funds, universities
must adopt policies prohibiting
drug use and distribution.
Instead of implementing the
"Controlled Substance and Alco
hol Policy" in October, Reges said,
Kennedy should have talked with
universities that had policies that
emphasized individual responsi
bility, and then, together, they
should have confronted the gov
ernment and refused to imple
ment new policies.
The Stanford policy states:
"The unlawful manufacture, dis
tribution, dispensation, posses
sion and/or use of controlled sub
stances or the unlawful posses
sion, use or distribution of alcohol
is prohibited on the Stanford cam
pus, in the workplace or as part of
any of the University's activities."
"Violation of this policy may
result in disciplinary sanctions up
to and including termination of
employment or expulsion of stu

dents," the statement notes.
While on leave, Reges is not
permitted to teach classes.
Reges, who won the Lloyd
Dinkelspiel Award for Outstanding
Service to Undergraduate Educa
tion in 1985 and a School of Engi
neering Distinguished Adviser
Award in 1986, said in an inter
view, "The University will have a
tough time in not firing me." But,
he added, "I'm more worried about
academic freedom than my job."
Reges said he has never taught
class or held office hours while
under the influence of drugs, but
noted that he has kept illegal
drugs in his backpack while on
campus and "will do so in the
future."
In addition to this admission,
two other actions have provoked
the wrath of government and Uni
versity officials.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran—Daily
Computer Science lecturer Stuart Reges, suspended pending an investigation of alleged violations of
the University drug and alcohol policy, talks to students at Cedro about his situation.
In a letter to the Office of
National Drug Control Policy,
which Martinez heads, he described
a chance meeting at a bus stop with
a Stanford undergraduate who
asked him whether he should try
MDA, an amphetamine-derived
hallucinogen.
According to Reges, the stu
dent said he had had positive
experiences with maryuana and
LSD. Reges said he told the stu
dent that he thought there were
no negative effects of MDA use
and recommended that he
experiment with the drug.
Another action, which Reges
admitted in an electronic-mail
message to University officials,
occurred two weeks ago when he
took a section of his Computer
Science 106 X class to dinner at
the Mac Arthur Park restaurant
after the students had won a con
test. He said most of the students
were over 21 and were ordering
drinks, but a few underage stu
dents also wanted to order drinks.
In a letter published today in
The Daily he wrote that "It
seemed silly to me that I should
check their IDs or scold them for
drinking underage, so I said that I
was not going to interfere in their
personal choices." Reges said the
event was paid for with unre
stricted funds — money he earned
from teaching courses on instruc
tional television.
The entire situation began
with a two-part letter to The Daily
on Nov. 8-9 in which Reges out
lined his reasons for disagreeing
with the drug and alcohol policies
the government and Stanford had
implemented. "I firmly believe
that government has no right to
interfere in any activity that takes
place in private between consent
ing adults," he wrote.
"Students must feel that the
privacy of dorm rooms on campus
will not be violated," he wrote,
adding that Stanford should not
limit what can be carried on one's
person while on campus or at
campus activities.
In the letter he admitted he
carried illegal drugs in his back
pack and advised students to defy
the alcohol and drug policy "and
to do so as openly as you are will
ing to do."
In a Nov. 21 Daily article,
Ronald Bucknam, the director of

Drug Prevention Programs in
Higher Education, a federal
agency, suggested that colleges
"recruit half the [resident assis
tants! to be there to make sure the
rules are followed, the other half
as counselors."
On Nov. 28 Reges wrote Buck
nam a letter in which he admitted
his drug use and his defiance of
the policies by carrying drugs with
him. "I don't believe that anyone
in the administration is serious
about enforcing the policy," he
wrote. He also described the bus
stop incident in which he gave
advice to the student.
Reges said he mailed similar
letters to President Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle and Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and received
no response.
On March 26, Reges wrote
another letter to Bucknam, who
had not responded to the first let
ter. Reges wrote that a University
drug counselor had called to tell
him that she thought what he was
doing was wrong and "to make
sure that I realized that what I'm
doing puts my job in jeopardy, and
I verified that I was aware of
that."
The counselor, Louise Miller,
director of the Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity program, could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Reges also wrote that he had
received positive student response
from dorm dinners, that he was
concerned about "the govern
ment's anti-drug propaganda
war" which has made freshmen
and sophomores "amazingly
afraid of trying any drugs," and
that he was continuing to violate
the Stanford policy "with
impunity."
After Martinez, the former gov
ernor of Florida, was sworn in as
the new director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy in
late March, Reges wrote a letter
informing Martinez of his actions;
he included the Daily letters and
the two letters to Bucknam.
"If your office gives you any
power to try to force me to change
my behavior, I suggest that you
apply it immediately, because
right at the moment you look
rather silly at Stanford to me and
the numerous students that I talk
to," Reges wrote.
Martinez, in an April 12 letter,
informed Kennedy of the corre
spondence between Reges and the
government offices. Martinez
wrote, "I am sure you agree that

American higher education has a
special obligation to help ensure
the safety and order of its cam
puses where drugs are at issue.
Martinez then reminded
Kennedy that the University's
receipt of federal funds is contin
gent upon its adherence to the
Drug-Free Schools and Communi
ties Act.
He added, "In all candor, I
would find it beyond comprehen
sion that a man who openly pro
fesses to have encouraged an
undergraduate to ingest MDA
could continue to enjoy faculty
privileges at a pace-setting insti
tution like Stanford University. . .
. I can think of no action more rad
ically at odds with the responsibil
ities an educator has to his stu
dents."
According to the Associated
Press, Martinez's aide said the
Office sent copies of Reges' letter
to the Justice Department for pos
sible prosecution.
Kennedy authorized an investi
gation after receiving Martinez's
letter. Ken Down, associate dean
for administration in the School of
Engineering, will lead the investi
gation along with Kathy Davis,
assistant dean of human
resources for the school. Down
said he discussed the situation
with the university's legal office.
In an April 19 letter to Reges,
Down said he was "seriously trou
bled by the conduct" described in
Reges' correspondence. Down
wrote that he believes Reges'
advice to the student "is conduct,
not protected speech," and that
such action would constitute pro
fessional misconduct.
Down, who admitted the situa
tion involving advice at the bus
stop is "fuzzy," said in an inter
view, however, that he doesn't
"think it's proper for a senior lec
turer to be giving that type of
advice to students."
Down placed Reges on adminis
trative leave pending completion
of the investigation. Down said he
and Davis will interview Reges
this morning, but he does not
know when the investigation will
be completed.
Although he cannot teach
classes, he will be on campus for
dorm discussions, he said.
Reges told a group of 60 people
last night in Cedro that he
believes "victimless crime is not a
crime" and that the "war on
drugs" is "frightening."
