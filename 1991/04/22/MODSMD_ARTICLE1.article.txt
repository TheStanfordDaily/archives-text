# Lecturer placed on leave
## Reges to be investigated for violation of drug policy 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stuart Reges, an award-win
ning senior lecturer in computer
science, was placed on paid admin
istrative leave last week after
admitting in a series of letters
that he violates the University's
drug and alcohol policy to protest
governmental invasion of privacy.
University President Donald
Kennedy, after receiving a warn
ing from national drug czar Bob
Martinez, has called for an inves
tigation that is to begin today.
Reges, who called U.S. drug
education "indoctrination, not
education," admitted in "inten
tionally provocative" letters to
government officials that he car
ries illegal drugs in his backpack
in defiance of the University's
drug and alcohol policy. The 1989
Drug-Free Schools and Communi
ties Act stipulates that, in order to

receive federal funds, universities
must adopt policies prohibiting
drug use and distribution.
Instead of implementing the
"Controlled Substance and Alco
hol Policy" in October, Reges said,
Kennedy should have talked with
universities that had policies that
emphasized individual responsi
bility, and then, together, they
should have confronted the gov
ernment and refused to imple
ment new policies.
The Stanford policy states:
"The unlawful manufacture, dis
tribution, dispensation, posses
sion and/or use of controlled sub
stances or the unlawful posses
sion, use or distribution of alcohol
is prohibited on the Stanford cam
pus, in the workplace or as part of
any of the University's activities."
"Violation of this policy may
result in disciplinary sanctions up
to and including termination of
employment or expulsion of stu

dents," the statement notes.
While on leave, Reges is not
permitted to teach classes.
Reges, who won the Lloyd
Dinkelspiel Award for Outstanding
Service to Undergraduate Educa
tion in 1985 and a School of Engi
neering Distinguished Adviser
Award in 1986, said in an inter
view, "The University will have a
tough time in not firing me." But,
he added, "I'm more worried about
academic freedom than my job."
Reges said he has never taught
class or held office hours while
under the influence of drugs, but
noted that he has kept illegal
drugs in his backpack while on
campus and "will do so in the
future."
In addition to this admission,
two other actions have provoked
the wrath of government and Uni
versity officials.
