# Centennial event celebrates culture
## 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
The University's 100 th Cen
tennial event was not a dull
party.
With more than 25 campus
cultural groups participating,
the Centennial Culture Fest
was much like a street fair, with
food booths and live stage per
formances entertaining hun
dreds Friday afternoon in the
Quad.
The event reached beyond
Stanford's four well-estab
lished minority communities
— the black, Latino, Asian-
American and Native Ameri
can student groups — into
national, religious and other
lesser-known campus groups.
The aim of the festival, said
Council of Presidents member
Goodwin Liu, was to bring
broad cultural diversity into
the mainstream and show how
such diversity can be enjoyed
rather than "handled." The
COP was a sponsor of the
event.
Among the many festival
booths was one set up by the
Undergraduate Chinese Amer
ican Association, which pro
vided free sushi and taught
students the basics of mah
jong, an ancient Chinese game
in which small blocks with var
ious symbols are played in a
way similar to that of the
Western card game gin rummy.
Nearby, MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group, and
the Asian American Student
Association played menus off
one another as aquas frescas
and pan dulce competed for
people's tastebuds with
chicken roast pork and veg
etable fried rice.
Next door, political differ
ences were put aside as the
Model Arab League provided
information about its program
beside Stanford Hillel, where
students sold falafel, pitas
filled with hummus and fried
chick peas.
Also represented was the

Disability Resource Center,
which displayed a board with
quotes from various disabled
students. "People never ask
how it feels to be an alien from
Mars. But the looks on some of
their faces clearly show they
think of me in exactly those
terms," one quote read.
Mark Breimhorst, a junior
and co-president of the Dis
abled Students Association,
said the group wanted to make
the community more aware of
the "disability culture" that
exists on campus and in the
United States.
The Hellenic Association at
Stanford sold tyropita, a Greek
dish of olive-stuffed grape
leaves.
Hammarsjkold House pro
vided home-cooked interna
tional foods, including baklava
and chow mein. Unlike most of
the other booths, the house's
dishes were student-prepared
and free of charge. "Everyone
in the house participated in one
way or another," said Ham
marsjkold resident assistant
Carl Im, a graduate student.
Haus Mittleleuropa, Okada,
Slavianskii Dom and the
French House were among the
other theme houses repre
sented at the festival.
Across the Quad, Ujamaa
House provided sweet potato
pie and peach cobbler — tradi
tonal African-American dishes
— while the Stanford African
Students Association sold gen
uine African masks and jew
elry.
Meanwhile, on stage, Stan
ford Hillel kicked off the fes
tivites with traditional Jewish
folkdancing and many mem
bers of the audience joined in.
The afternoon's student
performances also included a
medley rendition of School
house Rock favorites by Fleet
Street, African dancing and
drumming by the Kuumba
Dance Ensemble, a T'ai Chi
martial arts demonstration
and a feminist poetry reading
by junior Toni Long.
