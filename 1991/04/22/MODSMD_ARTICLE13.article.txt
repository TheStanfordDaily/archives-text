# Iraq calls helping Kurds a 'violation'
## 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) â€” Iraq's
state press yesterday bitterly
denounced the use of American troops
to protect Kurdish refugee camps
being built in northern Iraq.
"This provocative behavior is bla
tant interference in Iraq's domestic
affairs and a flagrant violation of inter
national law," wrote Al-Thawra, the
voice of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party
More than 400 U.S. Marines
entered northern Iraq on Saturday
and a U.S. convoy crossed into the
country yesterday to establish camps
for some of the millions of Kurds who
fled Saddam Hussein's troops follow
ing a failed uprising.
France, Britain, Italy and the
Netherlands have also decided to set
up camps in Iraq or say they are con
sidering it.
Military authorities near the Iraqi
border in Turkey reported no Iraqi
resistance, but the official Iraqi news
papers expressed bitterness.
AI-Thawra noted that Iraq itself has
signed an agreement with the United
Nations to channel aid to Kurdish
refugees and said the U.S. "camps were
established illegally."
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, whose country has been
swamped by refugees, took a guarded
line on the so-called safe havens.

"If it does not harm the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Iraq, it
could be considered positively," he told
a news conference Sunday in Tehran.
But he ruled out the establishment
of a similar zone along his country's
border, where hundreds of thousands
of Kurdish refugees are camped with
little food or shelter.
Meanwhile in Turkey, three weeks
after the Kurdish exodus from Iraq, an
international relief effort has suc
ceeded in feeding most of the refugees
camping in the Turkish mountains,
say relief officials and refugees.
But water shortages and medical
care remain serious problems for the
800,000 Kurds along the border.
"They have basic food. In that
sense, there was a turning point
reached last week," said Constantin
Sokoloff, a field officer for the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees.
Still, despite the international out
pouring of aid, scores of refugees are
dying each day on the border of pre
ventable diseases, relief workers and
government officials say.
"Sanitation really is the main
thing," said Dr. Sandra Allaire of
Canada, who is working with the
International Committee of the Red
Cross at Uzumlu, a camp of about
50,000 people in a mountain basin on
the border.
