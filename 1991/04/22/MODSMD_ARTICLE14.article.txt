### 
JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Sec
retary of State James Baker said yes
terday he's not putting pressure on
Israel to compromise its stand on
peace talks with the Arabs, but made it
clear there should be "an international
characteristic" to any negotiations.
While Baker waited to hear from
Jerusalem, he flew to Saudi Arabia to
discuss a sharply limited role for the
oil-rich kingdom in resolving the Arab-
Israeli dispute. Baker met Saturday
with Jordan's King Hussein and yes
terday with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
In the meantime, Baker's strategy'
seemed geared to placing the onus on

Israel to keep his peace mission from
disintegrating.
"We have no heard responses to the
suggestions that we made in my last
visit," Baker said.
He has refused to spell out the pro
posals he left Friday with Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign
Minister David Levy.
But Baker has said the Soviets
should co-sponsor the peace talks with
the United States and he's leaning
publicly in the "direction of Arab and
Furopean demands for an interna
tional conference."
Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Saturday his coun

try would be at the peace table what
ever the circumstances.
"We have no problem in attending
this conference to move toward achiev
ing a just peace in the area," Abdel-
Meguid said after Baker met with
Mubarak.
Saudi Arabia's role, meanwhile, is
shrinking despite expectations during
the Gulf war that it would be a major
and moderating influence on peace
talks.
Baker said that while the Saudis
would not be engaged in negotiations
with Israel, they would be in "working
groups" that deal with such issues as
the environment, economic coopera

tion and possibly efforts to limit
weapons shipments to the Middle
East.
Israel agreed nearly two weeks ago
to negotiate with the Arab states and
representatives of the 1.7 million
Palestinians who live on the West Bank
in Gaza. But Israel wants to restrict
the Soviets to a limited role, bar mem
bers of the Palestine Liberation Orga
nization and keep all outside powers
except the United States on the side
lines.
The Israeli cabinet took up those
issues yesterday, but delayed any deci
sions until later in the week.
