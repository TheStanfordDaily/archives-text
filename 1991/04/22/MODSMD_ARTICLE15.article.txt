# New rule could mean additional burdens for Medicare recipients
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A proposed
rule calling for cost-benefit analysis of
new types of medical care for the elderly
could put additional burdens on Medi
care recipients, critics said yesterday.
A federal health official, however,
said the regulation would not be used to
block the availability of new technolo
gies that provide "clear advances or ben
efits."
"Up until now, cost has had no con
sideration," said Gail Wilensky, head of
the Health Care Financing Administra
tion. "We are just trying to bring it into
the calculation."
Gordon Schatz, a lawyer who special
izes in health care issues, said, "I find it
a little paradoxical that a program
designed to protect senior citizens
against cost now may be stepping back
from its public obligations to protect
them just because something may be too
expensive."
Wilensky said cost would not be used
as the sole determinant, but would be
only one factor — along with the bene
fits, safety and effectiveness of the new

device or medicine.
The rule, which is awaiting adoption,
would require the federal government
for the first time to compare costs and
benefits of specific types of care in decid
ing whether to pay for them.
Schatz, who is familiar with the pro
posal, said the regulation is evidently a
response to budgetary restraints
brought on by the federal deficit.
Horace Deets, a top official of the
American Association of Retired Per
sons, said he wasn't familiar with the
rule but worried that it, like other pro
posals to deal with health costs, would
merely "shift the cost perhaps from the
government to individuals."
"I understand the deficit and the
economy, but what concerns me is that
we are not taking into account the bur
den it is putting on people in need of
health care," Deets said.
Wilensky said she had sent the pro
posal to Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan for his
approval.
"It is not yet the policy of the depart

ment because it has not been acted upon
by the secretary," she said.
Previous rules have called for consid
ering safety and effectiveness in deter
mining whether Medicare would pay for
new services and procedures such as
liver transplants and magnetic reso
nance imaging.
The new rule provides for also con
sidering whether those procedures
would be more or less cost-effective than
alternatives already approved.
Approximately 34 million elderly and
disabled people are enrolled in Medi
care. The overall cost of the program
tripled in the last decade, and is
expected to reach $104 billion this year.
"I think there is a need for cost con
sciousness," Schatz said. "On the other
hand, the Medicare program was
designed 25 years ago to try to make
sure that senior citizens will have access
to medical care regardless of the cost."
A preamble to the new rule says: "We
do not believe Medicare beneficiaries
would be disadvantaged," the Times
reported.
