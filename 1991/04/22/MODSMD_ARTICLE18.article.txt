## A 						job poorly done 
### 
This spring's general
election lived up to
the ASSU's tradition

PROBABLY THE BEST thing
that can be said about this
year's ASSU general election
is that at least there weren't any
votes lost.
One would think that after a
year's experience with computer
voting, the ASSU would be getting
better, not worse. But as the stu
dents, candidates and Daily
reporters who waited until 3:30
a.m. Friday for the votes to be tab
ulated can attest, things are doing
anything but improving.
The election staff didn't start
counting votes until 1:30 a.m. —
three-and-a-half hours after the
polls had closed. And, when they
finally did start tabulating, they
used a single Macintosh Classic, a
computer much too slow for the
task, while faster machines waited
idly in the ASSU offices.
Of course, there was no way of
telling how close the job was to
completion because nobody had
bothered to total up the number of
voters.
In addition, the last 300 votes
sat in ASSU Election Commis
sioner Raul Lopez's office this
weekend until a number of stu
dents offered to tabulate them
themselves. Lopez's lack of enthu
siasm for promptly fulfilling his job
is shameful.
While it is good that Lopez and
his staff took extra measures to
avoid last year's debacle, in which
hundreds of votes were lost and the
charges of tampering still remain,
the job could have been done with a
great deal more care and efficiency.
And this year's incompetence
was not limited to tabulation of the
votes.

Take the security of this year's
computer voting process. Several
students reported seeing the pass
word that voting site employees
used to access the voting comput
ers.
In order to defray the charges of
fraud which still surround last
year's election, the election staff
should have done more to protect
the integrity of the voting system.
And the long lines for voting at
the Terman Engineering Center
were symptomatic of the incompe
tence that characterized the han
dling of the election. Students had
to wait more than 20 minutes to
vote, a fact which probably discour
aged turnout.
Perhaps one of the worst signs of
disorganization, however, was the
ASSU election handbook. It was a
disgrace. Groups on the ballot
requesting special fees were not
included in the handbook; Project
Motivation, a volunteer student
organization seeking a fee request,
was left off the ballot entirely.
The handbook was extremely
cumbersome, poorly organized and
difficult to read. Those groups'
budgets that did appear in the
handbook were disorganized and
often difficult to understand.
By contrast, the Stanford Cha
parral's election handbook was
professional and well-done. Many
students reported using — and
enjoying — the Chappie's humor
ous guide to voting. Unfortunately,
that means that the "L-factor" and
"What Dean Jean thought of me"
was more accessible information
than ASSU senators' positions on
issues and the functions of campus
groups requesting special fees.
In total, the election came to
students at a cost of nearly
$20,000, or almost $4 for every
student who voted.
In order to avoid having its elec
tion process become a joke, the
ASSU must begin running its elec
tions with competent efficiency.
