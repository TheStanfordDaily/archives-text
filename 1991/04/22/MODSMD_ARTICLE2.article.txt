# New ASSU tally causes few changes
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
The revised vote tally for last week's
ASSU election shows few changes in results
but was not finished in time to allow a
runoff between Council of Presidents slates
to be held this week.
Election commissioner Raul Lopez said
yesterday that all computer votes and
about 300 paper ballots — which constitute
about 98 percent of the vote — have been
counted. He estimated that he will receive
80 to 100 more ballots from Stanford in
Washington and several overseas cam
puses.
According to hearings officer Jason
Moore, the ballots for students at Stanford
in Washington have not yet been sent to the
program. He said he does not know if the
ballots will count in the election results, or
even if they will be sent out at all.
If the results are certified by the ASSU
Senate before votes from Stanford in Wash
ington and the remaining overseas cam
puses are received, Lopez said those ballots

will not be counted. The senate is expected
to initially validate the election tomorrow
night. Final certification of the results can
not take place until two weeks after the val
idation.
The senate is also expected to set the
date for a runoff between the "Students
First" COP slate and its People's Platform
opponent, "Stand and Deliver."
The senior class presidents' slate "A New
Cent-Sation" defeated its write-in oppo
nent "Significant Other" by a margin of
511 to 66 in the computer vote. The senior
class presidents plan social events for
seniors and participate in the selection of
the Commencement speaker.
The counting of the paper ballots did not
change the results of any special-fee
requests. MEChA, the ASSU lobby office
and XTV failed to get 50 percent of the vote
and will not receive special fees.
Paper ballots were used by students who
did not want to vote by computer and those
who were still in line when the polls closed.
Because the paper ballots were
not counted within 48 hours of
the time the polls closed, the
ASSU Bylaws say the runoff must
be held within two weeks of the
election.
Because none of the four COP
slates received 50 percent of the
vote, a runoff must be held
between the top two.
The runoff would have been
held this week if ballot counting
had finished earlier.
Although the senate plans to
meet tomorrow night to validate
the election, Lopez said that
action might violate the ASSU
Bylaws. The bylaws require vali
dation to take place at a "regular"
meeting of the senate, and Lopez
said he believes Tuesday's meet
ing is a special one.
Moore said he is disappointed

the COP runoff will not happen
sooner. "Everyone involved
wishes this would be wrapped up
posthaste," he added.
Stand and Deliver slate mem
ber Mike Curry said he is not
upset by the delay, however. "I
want to go out and talk to people
and answer their questions," he
said. "Another week will allow me
to do this better."
But Students First COP
candidate John Overdeck said he
believes the runoff should occur
as soon as possible. Because Stand
and Deliver trailed Students First
by about 14 percentage points in
the election, Overdeck said he
believes the People's Platform
slate will probably use the extra
time to "change the issues" and
gain supporters.
He said he does not believe the
point of a runoff is to allow addi
tional campaigning. Overdeck
said he plans to introduce a bill for
a preferential voting system,
which would eliminate the need

for a runoff. The system, which
would take effect in future elec
tions, would let students rank
their COP choices. In the event no
slate won a majority, the rankings
would be used to determine the
winner.
Fewer people vote in runoffs,
and they cost several thousand
dollars, so they "seem inefficient,"
he said.
Lopez said the COP slate bud
gets will be expanded by $50 for
campaigning before the runoff,
but their flier limit will not be
enlarged.
Meanwhile, the addition of
votes from some overseas cam
puses and the paper ballots
allowed graduate student James
Brown to move up to become a
voting senator, passing Derek
Miyahara.
Miyahara will become a non
voting graduate senator unless
the addition of the last paper bal
lots changes the totals again.
Freshman Virginia Rosas was

displaced as a voting undergradu
ate senator by Raphe Beck but
remains only*three votes behind
him. "I am just waiting for the
final results," Rosas said.
"If I could make it to number
10, that would be wonderful," she
added. "But if I do not make vot
ing senator, then I will still have a
voice on the senate."
The Daily reported Friday that
Miyahara and Rosas would be vot
ing senators, based on earlier
results that did not include paper
ballots or overseas votes.
Eli Cates, a Hammer and Cof
fin candidate for the undergradu
ate senate, said he will give up his
seat as a non-voting senator
because he is graduating this year.
"I can 'not vote' just as well from
wherever," he said. "Didn't Bart
win last year? It is the same sort
of thing."
The preliminary tally shows
that 5,519 students voted, com
pared to nearly 6,000 last year.
