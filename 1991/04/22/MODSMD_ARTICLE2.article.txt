# New ASSU tally causes few changes

The revised vote tally for last week's
ASSU election shows few changes in results
but was not finished in time to allow a
runoff between Council of Presidents slates
to be held this week.
Election commissioner Raul Lopez said
yesterday that all computer votes and
about 300 paper ballots — which constitute
about 98 percent of the vote — have been
counted. He estimated that he will receive
80 to 100 more ballots from Stanford in
Washington and several overseas cam
puses.
According to hearings officer Jason
Moore, the ballots for students at Stanford
in Washington have not yet been sent to the
program. He said he does not know if the
ballots will count in the election results, or
even if they will be sent out at all.
If the results are certified by the ASSU
Senate before votes from Stanford in Wash
ington and the remaining overseas cam
puses are received, Lopez said those ballots

will not be counted. The senate is expected
to initially validate the election tomorrow
night. Final certification of the results can
not take place until two weeks after the val
idation.
The senate is also expected to set the
date for a runoff between the "Students
First" COP slate and its People's Platform
opponent, "Stand and Deliver."
The senior class presidents' slate "A New
Cent-Sation" defeated its write-in oppo
nent "Significant Other" by a margin of
511 to 66 in the computer vote. The senior
class presidents plan social events for
seniors and participate in the selection of
the Commencement speaker.
The counting of the paper ballots did not
change the results of any special-fee
requests. MEChA, the ASSU lobby office
and XTV failed to get 50 percent of the vote
and will not receive special fees.
Paper ballots were used by students who
did not want to vote by computer and those
who were still in line when the polls closed.
