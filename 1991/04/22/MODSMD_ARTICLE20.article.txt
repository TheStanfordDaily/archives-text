## The 						spring giveaway 
### 
EASY MONEY. Little to no work.
Large cash prizes. Over $1 million
given away in just one night.
No, it's not the California lottery, it's
an enormous cash giveaway with slightly
better odds of winning: the ASSU special
fees election.
In this giveaway, the participants
themselves are not among the winners. In
fact, they inevitably lose — much more
than the $1 that Lotto tickets cost — and
they can only retrieve their hard-earned
money through a quarterly refund pro
cess, if they don't miss the "advertised"
deadline.
Strangely enough, the real losers in
this lottery are the people who don't par
ticipate. They typically lose up to $100, as
well as their right to get their money
back.
That leaves us with the winners —
about 25 groups that win up to $125,000
each simply by submitting a budget to the
ASSU Senate, which typically approves it
without much scrutiny. The student body
looks at the name of the sponsor group,
decides if they like the group, and usually
votes "yes," despite virtual ignorance of
how the money will be spent.
The groups sponsor various activities
and student projects, most of them
worthwhile. However, many of the groups
make little or no attempt to involve the
student body that is paying for their
activities; several spend their funds
unwisely; many have abundant resources
to get their money elsewhere.
On this year's ballot, for example,
MEChA requested $33,126 even though
its active membership is reportedly fewer

than 20; SURE Escort Service requested
$55,698, most of which is typically used
for large coordinator salaries and escort
wages, when many people would willingly
volunteer for the service; and the Axe/Big
Game Bonfire Committee and Stanford
Band both have a potentially large finan
cial commitments from alumni.
Student groups tend to have a noncha
lant attitude toward asking fellow stu
dents to fund their programs, even when
there are wealthier sources willing to help
out. Organizers of the You Can Make a
Difference Conference, a praiseworthy
event, requested student money this year
just to avoid the hassle of fund raising,
which they have done successfully in the
past.
Despite the ease of the special fee pro
cess, student groups should make the
extra effort to find more stable sources of
funding elsewhere: alumni or community
donations, innovative fund-raising pro
jects, membership dues or event admis
sion fees. Many non-fee-requesting
groups successfully raise money for their
programs without burdening the entire
student body.
None of that matters when it comes to
special fee voting, though, since the stu
dent body finds it difficult to assemble
enough information to make an informed
opinion about the group's fee request.
The only available resource that
includes the appropriate information, the
ASSU election handbook, is so poorly
organized and downright unappealing
that no one uses it. And even that didn't
include four groups' budgets that
appeared on this year's ballot.

What does all this leave us with? Last
Thursday's approval of $1.23 million in
special and general fee requests —
amounting to approximately $100 in
ASSU fees per person next year.
There are two problems with the
system. The voters usually cannot sift
through the voluminous information
about each group, and they cannot make
line-item vetoes even if they object to the
group's spending but support their cause.
In light of the information problems,
the students' representatives (the senate
and Council of Presidents) should take a
more active role in the process — making
sure each group's money is properly spent
and that the money could not be obtained
elsewhere.
The students* for" their part,
avoid the common mentality of vqting for
a group's fee request, even though they
plan on taking the money back the
following year. When you vote "yes" on a
group's fee request, you are essentially
agreeing that you and one other person
who did not vote will pay up to $10 each
for that group's service.
Remember that when next year's elec
tions roll around.
