## People become PC because they are aware of injustice 
### 
AFTER READING Tim Marklein's
column about political correctness
in The Daily on April 15,1 was
prompted to analyze — or rather, to
"think critically about" — a few of the
things that political correctness means to
me.
Political correctness includes being
aware of issues involving the treatment
of women in our society and the preva
lent sexist attitudes that exist through
out the United States. Marklein men
tions the plight of "pro-life students who
avoid discussions about abortion because
their views are dismissed by their peers."
My experience has been that these views
have not been dismissed, but rather chal
lenged.
Marklein calls for "a diversity of view
points." Decisions are being made, on a
legislative level, which do not reflect a
diversity of opinions. Yet, at the same
time, so many people are, like Marklein,
lamenting the killing of independent
thought and speech on college campuses.
What is meant here by "indepen
dent?" The fact remains that there is a
group, the majority of whom are male,

which decides whether women have the
right to choose abortion.
Political correctness also means being
aware of the problems of racism in our
society. Marklein states that non-PC
believers' views are being "squashed."
But what about institutional racism and
sexism? Aren't some of the "legitimate
disagreements" being expressed vis-a-vis
this subtle mechanism?
Besides noting what may seem to be
the "various and widespread effects of
political correctness," I only wish that
Marklein had also pointed out the dis
criminatory nature of our society, which
encourages political correctness.
Marklein has touched upon a popular
buzzword in "political correctness," but
his article, which sets up a dialectic
between political correctness and non
political correctness, is vague and sim
plistic. It is perhaps not, as Marklein
suggests, a feeling of "moral superiority"
that fuels many who are PC, but a belief
in equality.
Perhaps I am being unfair and overly
critical of his article. After all, he is "a
senior in political science who has been

When you are being

forced to do much critical thinking at
Stanford and is still not politically cor
rect."
Is Marklein suggesting that being PC
is not a result of critical thinking? Maybe
it is also the result of how many people
of color, women, gays and lesbians are
forced by the reality of their lives, and
not a college education, to join the PC
ranks. When you are being bashed on
the streets or discriminated against for
employment opportunities, it is hard to
keep an open mind. Being PC, for me, is
not just a matter of the mind, but also of

the heart.
Marklein deems the "confrontational
activism" of the People's Platform and
students of color groups to be part of a
flawed formula and proposes "a better
equation." What happened to a variety of
viewpoints all being valid?
Marklein is contradicting himself by
not adhering to his somewhat vague eth
ical/moral relativist perspective. He
wants PC believers to realize "that there
are legitimate alternative opinions."
However, PC views are inherently reflec
tive of alternative opinions to American
mainstream sociopolitical thought.
Do the negative connotations that the
PC label has acquired make it easier to
dismiss the issues that the label
addresses? Who started this reactionary
PC name-calling anyway, and for what
purpose?
Of course, I'm asking too many ques
tions with my "stifling monologue" and
thinking too much about these issues . . .
for, as we all know, "Critical thinking
isn't PC."
