# Students will suffer if Reges is the victim of Stanford's drug policy
## 
### 
We are incredibly distressed by the
treatment of Computer Science Lecturer
Stuart Reges.
On Friday, April 19, Reges was placed
on administrative leave pending an
investigation by University officials. This
action was prompted by Reges' state
ment in a March 28 letter to Bob Mar
tinez, the director of the federal Office of

National Drug Control Policy. In his let
ter, Reges stated that he uses illegal
drugs.
Martinez has written a letter to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
demanding that Reges be fired and has
threatened to cut off federal funds for
the University if the administration does
not comply.
As Reges is currently teaching a com
puter science course, his dismissal will be
a mcyor disruption. Since there is no
indication that his admitted drug use
interferes with his work, Reges should be
allowed to continue to teach this class
while he is under investigation.
Furthermore, the federal govern-

ment's policy of threatening to withhold
funds from universities amounts to
blackmail. Martinez's letter is essentially
harassment. Reges has not been convict
ed of, or even charged with, any crime,
yet a penalty has been imposed upon
him.
We demand that Reges be immediate
ly reinstated to his teaching position. If
he is fired, we pledge never to contribute
to Stanford University. We further urge
all students and alumni to join us in
withholding support until Reges is rein
stated.
An empty statement of disapproval is
not enough. A university which is party
to such harassment is simply not worthy

of our support.
