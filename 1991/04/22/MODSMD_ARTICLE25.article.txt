## Stuart Reges Stanford's drug and alcohol policy: 'I won't toe the line' 
### 
ON FRIDAY, I WAS PLACED ON
administrative leave by Stanford
University, pending an investiga
tion. I write this article to explain the
events leading up to this action.
I have used drugs and I feel they have
been a positive influence in my life.
When the federal government forced
Stanford to adopt a new alcohol and drug
policy that apparently nobody at Stan
ford wanted, I felt that I could no longer
sit idly by.
I attended many of the discussions
about the new policy to see how it would
be translated into action. The impression
I got was that little would change. Stan
ford would continue internally to stress
its policy of respecting privacy as long as
individuals behave responsibly, but
would appease the government by pub
licly acknowledging a more stringent pol
icy.
Many people have said to me, "Why
can't you accept that? As long as Stan
ford does the right thing, what does it
matter what we say?" I understand this
point of view, but I personally have never
been able to live with hypocrisy. That is
why I wrote my article in The Daily last
November, advocating that people defy
the policy and insist on the right to make
personal choices, and sent copies of it to
various government officials.
In all, I have done four things that
some find objectionable.
First, I have violated etiquette — and
this is the criticism that nobody seems to
want to make public. I was angry that
the federal government coerced Stanford
into accepting a policy that it didn't

want, and that Stanford was too cow
ardly to object. I have vented that anger
in a series of letters to the government.
My letters have been intentionally
provocative and have purposely targeted
the most ignorant and objectionable offi
cials — for example, Vice President Dan
Quayle, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Ronald Buckham, who was quoted in
The Daily as saying that Stanford should
get more "rules-oriented" resident assis
tants to police the dorms.
This, I am told, is rude; it is not the
way to get things done. Thus, some peo
ple tell me, I have brought this catastro
phe on myself, and I agree with them to
a great extent. But this country should
not have reached the point where I, as a
university staff member, may not attack
the government and university officials
when I disagree with their policies.
Second, I have demanded that the
University respect my privacy. In partic
ular, I refuse to allow the University to
dictate what I will and won't carry in my
backpack while on campus. I have car
ried illegal drugs in my backpack since
the new policy was instituted, which is a
direct violation. Carrying drugs in my
backpack is not, in all honesty, essential
to my continued happiness. I did so to
draw attention to the larger issue of vio
lation of privacy.
Students are much more adversely
affected than I am because the same pol
icy that applies to my backpack also
applies to their dorm rooms. How can
students feel comfortable at Stanford if
they have no place that they can think of
as private and exempt from meddling

rules that limit victimless behavior?
There is also the question of escala
tion. If this violation of privacy is accept
able, why not require drug tests of enter
ing freshmen and random drug testing of
faculty and staff? This idea has been
seriously proposed by several proponents
of the war on drugs. The backpack may
seem trivial, but to me it symbolizes the
entire debate, which is why I chose it as
my "battleground."
My third offense came about rather
unexpectedly. I run a contest in Com
puter Science 106 X and take the winning
section to dinner at McArthur Park. I
use my unrestricted funds to pay for this
event — money that I earn when I teach
courses on instructional television. When
we went there two weeks ago, we
ordered drinks. Most students were
either over 21 or ordering non-alcoholic
drinks, but some underage students
ordered alcoholic drinks. It seemed silly
to me that I should check their driver's
licenses or scold them for drinking
underage, so I said that I was not going
to interfere in their personal choices.
The waiter did not ask anyone for identi
fication, and so a few students who were
over 18 but under 21 had a single before
dinner alcoholic beverage.
Will Stanford fire me for this? If so, I
think this sounds the death knell for
relaxed interaction between faculty and
students at social events like dinners and
wine-and-cheese get-togethers.
My fourth violation has drawn the
most attention from all sides, and it is
the one that I am most convinced is not
a violation of University policy. I bumped

into a student that I know while we were
both waiting to take the 7-F bus back
from the airport after Thanksgiving
break. Before the bus arrived he sheep
ishly said, "Can I ask you a personal
question?" When I said yes, he told me
that he wanted advice on whether or not
to experiment with the drug MDA. That
started a fascinating hour-long conversa
tion about drug use and what we
thought we could learn intellectually and
spiritually from our drug experiences.
The student had two major concerns
about MDA: addiction and loss of con
trol. In response to the former, I
informed him that MDA is not physically
addictive. In response to the latter, I told
him that loss of control is rare on MDA if
taken in moderate doses. In answer to
his question, then, I told him that his
two reasons for not doing the drug
sounded like bad reasons and that I per
sonally have had excellent experiences on
MDA. In essence, I recommended that he
try it.
I believe that anything I might have
said to this student in a private conver
sation constitutes protected free speech.
I was expressing my personal opinion,
and the student understood it as such.
The government is upset about this inci
dent because my opinion differs from its
own.
My suspension and the current inves
tigation of my actions were prompted by
a letter to President Kennedy from Bob
Martinez, the new national drug czar.
Martinez says,"In all candor, I would
find it beyond comprehension that a man
who openly professes to have encouraged

an undergraduate to ingest MDA could
continue to enjoy faculty privileges at a
pace-setting institution like Stanford
University. ... I can think of no action
more radically at odds with the responsi
bilities of an educator to his students."
This incident indicates that Stanford
has become a full partner in the govern
ment's war on drugs, including intrusive
invasion of privacy, punishment of the
offender and suppression of dissenting
opinions. How Stanford and other uni
versities can do this and still consider
themselves open environments that fos
ter reason and free inquiry, I do not
know.
Everyone at Stanford knows that
underage drinking here is rampant, that
drugs like marijuana are used by a num
ber of students, faculty and staff and
that the University knowingly chooses to
ignore such behavior. Thus, my guess is
that I am not the only offender of Stan
ford's drug and alcohol policy. But I
won't "toe the line." As a result, I expect
that in the end the University will fire
me for what I've said and base the action
on the two specific direct violations of
the policy: my backpack and the alcohol
incident.
I will continue to express my views as
long as the University and the govern
ment allow me to do so. Because I am on
paid leave, I have lots of time on my
hands, so if any dorms would like to
invite me over to discuss this topic, I'd
be glad to oblige.
