## Netters look like champs in routs of USC, UCLA 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Cardinal fans were murmuring
"Revenge," but it was a new-found confi
dence that had Stanford celebrating.
The men's tennis team solidly defeated
USC and UCLA this weekend — after los
ing to both two weeks ago — taking a big
step towards defending its national crown.
"It was great to win, but the important
thing is we have a lot more confidence in
the team," the victorious Alex O'Brien said.
"Everyone seems to be playing a lot better.
We seem to be getting on a roll right now."
One thousand not-so-demure supporters
helped the Cardinal bounce out of its
Pacific 10 Conference losing streak and
onto a steamroller Friday. The Cardinal
showed the swaggering Trojans who's the
boss on the Farm, needing only singles play
to rout previously undefeated-in-confer
ence USC 5-1.
Fifteen hundred raucous fans urged
Stanford on to a 6-1 humbling of the not-so
mighty Bruins Saturday to send the L.A.
tandem south with its tail between its legs.
Or at least with a little humility.
"The crowd really made a lot of differ
ence," said coach Dick Gould. "They were
really great, and were a tremendous help."
"The crowd doesn't help only me — it
helped discourage the other guy," O'Brien
added. "When you win a big point the crowd
goes crazy. The other guy starts thinking
'What am I up against?' "
Stanford and its fans discouraged "the
other guy" early Saturday, taking five of six

first sets against the Bruins and setting the
tone for the afternoon. As opposed to the
contest in Westwood, when the Cardinal
won only one singles match and where all
the breaks seemed to go UCLA's way, the
ball — and the match — were clearly in
Stanford's court.
The No. 3 ranked Cardinal dominated
early, fought off tough challenges, and
pulled out the tiebreakers.
The result was Stanford's 16th victory of
the year, its sixth in conference play, and
the re-establishment of the Stanford cham
pionship aura.
"There's definitely a little mystique
about it," Gould said. "We start playing bet
ter and putting everything together and
everyone says, 'My God, here comes Stan
ford.' "
The Bruins were definitely left wonder
ing what hit them when the courts cleared
Saturday.
Within two hours the match was all but
over. O'Brien dominated UCLA's Mark
Knowles at No. 1, 6-4, 6-4. The victory was
especially satisfying because Knowles had
taken O'Brien out in straight sets down


Jonanthan Stark and his teammates got the revenge they sought over the weekend. The Cardinal swept the Southern Cal
ifornia schools and re-established itself as a favorite to capture the NCAA crown.
south.
At No. 2, Jared Palmer not
only added to the team 'W' col
umn, but got a demon off his hack
as well. Palmer, who had dropped
matches to USC, Utah and Cal
during the previous week,
reasserted himself with a 6-4, 7-6
(7-4) thriller over Jason Netter.
Meanwhile Jonathan Stark
showed the collegiate tennis
world he is officially back from a
stress fracture by giving Fritz
Bissell nary a game at No. 3 sin
gles. Stark dissected Bissell —
who had beat him in three sets
two weeks ago — 6-0, 6-0.
Almost as quickly, Jason Yee
took apart Bill Barber at No. 5,
winning eight straight games en
route to a 7-5, 6-0 victory and a 4-
0 Stanford lead.

There's definitely a
little mystique about
it. We start playing
better... and every
one says, "My God,
here comes Stan
ford." '

Since the No. 4 and 6 singles
matches were going to three sets,
Gould and UCLA coach Glenn
Bassett decided to start the dou
bles competition, and Stark and
Palmer took to court No. 1
against Knowles and Bissell.
Their heroics turned out not to be
needed.
Vimal Patel gutted out a win at
No. 4 before the dynamic duo
downed their Bruin counterparts
6-1, 7-6 (7-4). Patel came bacx
from a first-set loss to overpower
Jason Sher 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 for
the individual, and team victory.
Michael Flanagan posted the
Cardinal's only loss of the day, a
6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 6-7 (6-8) heart
breaker to Robbie Wendell at No.
6.
"It was really nice to see every
one in a position to win," Gould
said. "We lost three of the top four
in L.A. but won them all this
time. Jared especially played a
very intelligent match."
Friday was only a preview of
things to come. After losing a
down-to-the-wire, 5-4 heart
breaker to the Trojans two weeks
previously, Stanford never let
them in the match on the first day
'of this weekend's competition.' "
USC posted the first victory of
the day — a 6-3, 6-0 Brian Mac-
Phie shellacking of Palmer at No.
2 — but that was to be the only
time the squad got on the board.
Stanford quickly took control
and bested the talented Trojans
with five straight-set singles vic
tories.
After going up 4-1, O'Brien
held onto the first set and pulled
out a 7-6 (7-3) squeaker. He then
dominated Byron Black 6-3 in the
second for the victory at No. 1 sin
gles. Stark followed suit, downing
Donny Isaak 6-4, 6-1 on court No.
3.
Patel pulled out a straight set
ter over Jonathan Leach at No. 4,
6-3, 7-6 (7-3), and Yee held onto
his breaks against David Ekerot
for a 6-4, 6-4 victory on the next
court over.
Flanagan kept the duel from
going to doubles by hanging
tough against Andras Lanyi.
After taking the first 6-4, Flana
gan was up 4-1 in stanza No. 2
when Lanyi battled back to tie
things up at five. Flanagan held
serve, then broke Lanyi for a 7-5
second set, and a 5-1 Stanford
rout.
"We need to make a statement
soon, and this was part of it,"
Gould said. "It was a good, solid
win."
NCAAs must be on the hori
zon.

Michael Flanagan posted the
Cardinal's only loss of the day, a
6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 6-7 (6-8) heart
breaker to Robbie Wendell at No.

"It was really nice to see every
one in a position to win," Gould
said. "We lost three of the top four
in L.A. but won them all this
time. Jared especially played a
very intelligent match."
Friday was only a preview of
things to come. After losing a
down-to-the-wire, 5-4 heart
breaker to the Trojans two weeks
previously, Stanford never let
them in the match on the first day
'of this weekend's competition.' "
USC posted the first victory of
the day — a 6-3, 6-0 Brian Mac-
Phie shellacking of Palmer at No.
2 — but that was to be the only
time the squad got on the board.
Stanford quickly took control
and bested the talented Trojans
with five straight-set singles vic
tories.
After going up 4-1, O'Brien
held onto the first set and pulled
out a 7-6 (7-3) squeaker. He then
dominated Byron Black 6-3 in the
second for the victory at No. 1 sin
gles. Stark followed suit, downing
Donny Isaak 6-4, 6-1 on court No.
3.
Patel pulled out a straight set
ter over Jonathan Leach at No. 4,
6-3, 7-6 (7-3), and Yee held onto
his breaks against David Ekerot
for a 6-4, 6-4 victory on the next
court over.
Flanagan kept the duel from
going to doubles by hanging
tough against Andras Lanyi.
After taking the first 6-4, Flana
gan was up 4-1 in stanza No. 2
when Lanyi battled back to tie
things up at five. Flanagan held
serve, then broke Lanyi for a 7-5
second set, and a 5-1 Stanford
rout.
"We need to make a statement
soon, and this was part of it,"
Gould said. "It was a good, solid
win."
NCAAs must be on the hori
zon.
Cardinal fans were murmuring
"Revenge," but it was a new-found confi
dence that had Stanford celebrating.
The men's tennis team solidly defeated
USC and UCLA this weekend — after los
ing to both two weeks ago — taking a big
step towards defending its national crown.
"It was great to win, but the important
thing is we have a lot more confidence in
the team," the victorious Alex O'Brien said.
"Everyone seems to be playing a lot better.
We seem to be getting on a roll right now."
One thousand not-so-demure supporters
helped the Cardinal bounce out of its
Pacific 10 Conference losing streak and
onto a steamroller Friday. The Cardinal
showed the swaggering Trojans who's the
boss on the Farm, needing only singles play
to rout previously undefeated-in-confer
ence USC 5-1.
Fifteen hundred raucous fans urged
Stanford on to a 6-1 humbling of the not-so
mighty Bruins Saturday to send the L.A.
tandem south with its tail between its legs.
Or at least with a little humility.
"The crowd really made a lot of differ
ence," said coach Dick Gould. "They were
really great, and were a tremendous help."
"The crowd doesn't help only me — it
helped discourage the other guy," O'Brien
added. "When you win a big point the crowd
goes crazy. The other guy starts thinking
'What am I up against?' "
Stanford and its fans discouraged "the
other guy" early Saturday, taking five of six

first sets against the Bruins and setting the
tone for the afternoon. As opposed to the
contest in Westwood, when the Cardinal
won only one singles match and where all
the breaks seemed to go UCLA's way, the
ball — and the match — were clearly in
Stanford's court.
The No. 3 ranked Cardinal dominated
early, fought off tough challenges, and
pulled out the tiebreakers.
The result was Stanford's 16th victory of
the year, its sixth in conference play, and
the re-establishment of the Stanford cham
pionship aura.
"There's definitely a little mystique
about it," Gould said. "We start playing bet
ter and putting everything together and
everyone says, 'My God, here comes Stan
ford.' "
The Bruins were definitely left wonder
ing what hit them when the courts cleared
Saturday.
Within two hours the match was all but
over. O'Brien dominated UCLA's Mark
Knowles at No. 1, 6-4, 6-4. The victory was
especially satisfying because Knowles had
taken O'Brien out in straight sets down


Jonanthan Stark and his teammates got the revenge they sought over the weekend. The Cardinal swept the Southern Cal
ifornia schools and re-established itself as a favorite to capture the NCAA crown.

At No. 2, Jared Palmer not
only added to the team 'W' col
umn, but got a demon off his hack
as well. Palmer, who had dropped
matches to USC, Utah and Cal
during the previous week,
reasserted himself with a 6-4, 7-6
(7-4) thriller over Jason Netter.
Meanwhile Jonathan Stark
showed the collegiate tennis
world he is officially back from a
stress fracture by giving Fritz
Bissell nary a game at No. 3 sin
gles. Stark dissected Bissell —
who had beat him in three sets
two weeks ago — 6-0, 6-0.
Almost as quickly, Jason Yee
took apart Bill Barber at No. 5,
winning eight straight games en
route to a 7-5, 6-0 victory and a 4-
0 Stanford lead.

There's definitely a
little mystique about
it. We start playing
better... and every
one says, "My God,
here comes Stan
ford." '

Since the No. 4 and 6 singles
matches were going to three sets,
Gould and UCLA coach Glenn
Bassett decided to start the dou
bles competition, and Stark and
Palmer took to court No. 1
against Knowles and Bissell.
Their heroics turned out not to be
needed.
Vimal Patel gutted out a win at
No. 4 before the dynamic duo
downed their Bruin counterparts
6-1, 7-6 (7-4). Patel came bacx
from a first-set loss to overpower
Jason Sher 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 for
