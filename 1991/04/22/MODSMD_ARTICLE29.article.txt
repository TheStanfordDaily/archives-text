# To err is human
## Cardinal's sins lead to first Sunken Diamond sweep since '89 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Third-ranked Stanford let its hope for a sec
ond consecutive Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division baseball championship literally
slip through its hands this weekend.
What was once a close race with league lead
ing USC has all but been conceded bv the Car

dinal after an error-prone series with the last
place Bruins of UCLA ended in a sweep the
wrong way. Stanford committed 10 errors over
the course of the weekend, allowing miscues to
dictate the first two games of the series and
effectively ending any chance to grab the Six-
Pac title.
"I don't know what our chances are math
matically, but we can't worry about that right

Cardinal drops three*game
series to Bruins

now," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
just want us to play better."
USC probably does not mind the Cardinal's
current level of play. Stanford's losses, coupled
with the Trojan's sweep of ASU, dropped the
Cardinal to 11-7 in league play, six games off
the pace. Any chance of Sunken Diamond
hosting one of the two NCAA Western Region
als will come down to either Stanford having a
—furious-finiah-or-USC faltering. But it should
have never come down to that.
Stanford entered the weekend as the eighth
best-fielding team in the NCAA, tops in the
Six-Pac, yet managed to keep the ball out of
their gloves often enough to hand UCLA a
broom for the three-game cleaning.
"We played real sloppily," said Marquess
describing game one's four-error, 6-4 loss in
words that ultimately became a blanket state
ment for the series. "We wasted a great pitch
ing performance and didn't play defense."
Both Friday's opener and Saturday's five
error performance were highlighted bv mis
takes, but game one was probably the hardest
to take. Up 3-0 after a two home run first
inning, the Cardinal committed three errors in
the top of the ninth to help give up four runs
and hand UCLA the victory.
"It's a letdown," said pitcher Scott Weiss.
"After the first three runs we figured we'd
coast the rest of the way and the snake came
up and bit us."
Weiss took the loss to go 5-3 on the season,
but neither he nor starter John Reid can be
blamed for the setback. Reid pitched a strong 7
1/3 innings, giving up eight hits and managing
to pitch his way out of every jam he faced until
the eighth inning when he was touched for two
earned runs.
Weiss came in for relief and was on the
mound for the the ninth inning debacle, but all
four runs he saw cross the plate were
unearned.
"[Reid and Weiss] did everything you could
expect of them," said Stanford pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "They definitly pitched well
enough to win."
Due to the errors, the Bruins sent 10 bat-

Chris Kemper ponders Stanford's lost weekend. A three-game UCLA sweep, largely the
result of 10 Cardinal errors, made it extremely unlikely the Cardinal will contend for the Slx-
Pac title this year.
