# To err is human
## Cardinal's sins lead to first Sunken Diamond sweep since '89 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Third-ranked Stanford let its hope for a sec
ond consecutive Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division baseball championship literally
slip through its hands this weekend.
What was once a close race with league lead
ing USC has all but been conceded bv the Car

dinal after an error-prone series with the last
place Bruins of UCLA ended in a sweep the
wrong way. Stanford committed 10 errors over
the course of the weekend, allowing miscues to
dictate the first two games of the series and
effectively ending any chance to grab the Six-
Pac title.
"I don't know what our chances are math
matically, but we can't worry about that right

now," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
just want us to play better."
USC probably does not mind the Cardinal's
current level of play. Stanford's losses, coupled
with the Trojan's sweep of ASU, dropped the
Cardinal to 11-7 in league play, six games off
the pace. Any chance of Sunken Diamond
hosting one of the two NCAA Western Region
als will come down to either Stanford having a
—furious-finiah-or-USC faltering. But it should
have never come down to that.
Stanford entered the weekend as the eighth
best-fielding team in the NCAA, tops in the
Six-Pac, yet managed to keep the ball out of
their gloves often enough to hand UCLA a
broom for the three-game cleaning.
"We played real sloppily," said Marquess
describing game one's four-error, 6-4 loss in
words that ultimately became a blanket state
ment for the series. "We wasted a great pitch
ing performance and didn't play defense."
Both Friday's opener and Saturday's five
error performance were highlighted bv mis
takes, but game one was probably the hardest
to take. Up 3-0 after a two home run first
inning, the Cardinal committed three errors in
the top of the ninth to help give up four runs
and hand UCLA the victory.
"It's a letdown," said pitcher Scott Weiss.
"After the first three runs we figured we'd
coast the rest of the way and the snake came
up and bit us."
Weiss took the loss to go 5-3 on the season,
but neither he nor starter John Reid can be
blamed for the setback. Reid pitched a strong 7
1/3 innings, giving up eight hits and managing
to pitch his way out of every jam he faced until
the eighth inning when he was touched for two
earned runs.
Weiss came in for relief and was on the
mound for the the ninth inning debacle, but all
four runs he saw cross the plate were
unearned.
"[Reid and Weiss] did everything you could
expect of them," said Stanford pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "They definitly pitched well
enough to win."
Due to the errors, the Bruins sent 10 bat-

ters to the plate in the ninth. The
inning started with two UCLA
singles that turned into runs
when Weiss fielded a Robert
Hinds grounder and tried to make
the force at third.
Mark Skeels couldn't make the
catch and the Bruins tied the
game at four. Hinds advanced to

it."
Instead of being down 5-4 with
two outs, the Cardinal found
itself with two men on and only
one away. Weiss got -Joe Wolf to fly
out, but then hit Chris Loham to
load the bases. Gary Hagy hit
what should have been an inning-

and hopefully we'll turn it
around."
With the prospect of being
swept at home for the first time
since 1989, the Cardinal did turn
it around yesterday by commit
ting only one meaningless error,
but like Friday found itself unable
to stop the Bruins in the top of
the ninth.
Stanford went ahead 4-3 in the
bottom of the eighth when Matt
Bokemeier scored on a fielder's
choice single by Hammonds, but
Hagy hit a home run to tie it up,
and Matt Schwanke brought
UCLA ahead to stay.
The 5-4 loss completed the
sweep and left Stanford players
feeling justifiably low. "It hurts, it
hurts a lot," said Hammonds,
who went hitless for the series.
"This is not a team that should be
swept, (but) we just have to shake
this off and look at torn morrow as
a whole new day."

Third-ranked Stanford let its hope for a sec
ond consecutive Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division baseball championship literally
slip through its hands this weekend.
What was once a close race with league lead
ing USC has all but been conceded bv the Car

dinal after an error-prone series with the last
place Bruins of UCLA ended in a sweep the
wrong way. Stanford committed 10 errors over
the course of the weekend, allowing miscues to
dictate the first two games of the series and
effectively ending any chance to grab the Six-
Pac title.
"I don't know what our chances are math
matically, but we can't worry about that right

Baseball

Cardinal drops three*game
series to Bruins

now," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
just want us to play better."
USC probably does not mind the Cardinal's
current level of play. Stanford's losses, coupled
with the Trojan's sweep of ASU, dropped the
Cardinal to 11-7 in league play, six games off
the pace. Any chance of Sunken Diamond
hosting one of the two NCAA Western Region
als will come down to either Stanford having a
—furious-finiah-or-USC faltering. But it should
have never come down to that.
Stanford entered the weekend as the eighth
best-fielding team in the NCAA, tops in the
Six-Pac, yet managed to keep the ball out of
their gloves often enough to hand UCLA a
broom for the three-game cleaning.
"We played real sloppily," said Marquess
describing game one's four-error, 6-4 loss in
words that ultimately became a blanket state
ment for the series. "We wasted a great pitch
ing performance and didn't play defense."
Both Friday's opener and Saturday's five
error performance were highlighted bv mis
takes, but game one was probably the hardest
to take. Up 3-0 after a two home run first
inning, the Cardinal committed three errors in
the top of the ninth to help give up four runs
and hand UCLA the victory.
"It's a letdown," said pitcher Scott Weiss.
"After the first three runs we figured we'd
coast the rest of the way and the snake came
up and bit us."
Weiss took the loss to go 5-3 on the season,
but neither he nor starter John Reid can be
blamed for the setback. Reid pitched a strong 7
1/3 innings, giving up eight hits and managing
to pitch his way out of every jam he faced until
the eighth inning when he was touched for two
earned runs.
Weiss came in for relief and was on the
mound for the the ninth inning debacle, but all
four runs he saw cross the plate were
unearned.
"[Reid and Weiss] did everything you could
expect of them," said Stanford pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "They definitly pitched well
enough to win."
Due to the errors, the Bruins sent 10 bat-

ters to the plate in the ninth. The
inning started with two UCLA
singles that turned into runs
when Weiss fielded a Robert
Hinds grounder and tried to make
the force at third.
Mark Skeels couldn't make the
catch and the Bruins tied the
game at four. Hinds advanced to

instead of the sure out.
"I talked to Roger later and he
said he was expecting me to go to

nitely trying to do to much with
it."
Instead of being down 5-4 with
two outs, the Cardinal found
itself with two men on and only
one away. Weiss got -Joe Wolf to fly
out, but then hit Chris Loham to
load the bases. Gary Hagy hit
what should have been an inning-

the course of the weekend, allowing miscues to
dictate the first two games of the series and
effectively ending any chance to grab the Six-
Pac title.
"I don't know what our chances are math
matically, but we can't worry about that right

Cardinal drops three*game
series to Bruins

now," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
just want us to play better."
USC probably does not mind the Cardinal's
current level of play. Stanford's losses, coupled
with the Trojan's sweep of ASU, dropped the
Cardinal to 11-7 in league play, six games off
the pace. Any chance of Sunken Diamond
hosting one of the two NCAA Western Region
als will come down to either Stanford having a
—furious-finiah-or-USC faltering. But it should
have never come down to that.
Stanford entered the weekend as the eighth
best-fielding team in the NCAA, tops in the
Six-Pac, yet managed to keep the ball out of
their gloves often enough to hand UCLA a
broom for the three-game cleaning.
"We played real sloppily," said Marquess
describing game one's four-error, 6-4 loss in
words that ultimately became a blanket state
ment for the series. "We wasted a great pitch
ing performance and didn't play defense."
Both Friday's opener and Saturday's five
error performance were highlighted bv mis
takes, but game one was probably the hardest
to take. Up 3-0 after a two home run first
inning, the Cardinal committed three errors in
the top of the ninth to help give up four runs
and hand UCLA the victory.
"It's a letdown," said pitcher Scott Weiss.
"After the first three runs we figured we'd
coast the rest of the way and the snake came
up and bit us."
Weiss took the loss to go 5-3 on the season,
but neither he nor starter John Reid can be
blamed for the setback. Reid pitched a strong 7
1/3 innings, giving up eight hits and managing
to pitch his way out of every jam he faced until
the eighth inning when he was touched for two
earned runs.
Weiss came in for relief and was on the
mound for the the ninth inning debacle, but all
four runs he saw cross the plate were
unearned.
"[Reid and Weiss] did everything you could
expect of them," said Stanford pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "They definitly pitched well
enough to win."
Due to the errors, the Bruins sent 10 bat-

ters to the plate in the ninth. The
inning started with two UCLA
singles that turned into runs
when Weiss fielded a Robert
Hinds grounder and tried to make
the force at third.
Mark Skeels couldn't make the
catch and the Bruins tied the
game at four. Hinds advanced to

it."
Instead of being down 5-4 with
two outs, the Cardinal found
itself with two men on and only
one away. Weiss got -Joe Wolf to fly
out, but then hit Chris Loham to
load the bases. Gary Hagy hit
what should have been an inning-

around."
With the prospect of being
swept at home for the first time
since 1989, the Cardinal did turn
it around yesterday by commit
ting only one meaningless error,
but like Friday found itself unable
to stop the Bruins in the top of
the ninth.
Stanford went ahead 4-3 in the
bottom of the eighth when Matt
Bokemeier scored on a fielder's
choice single by Hammonds, but
Hagy hit a home run to tie it up,
and Matt Schwanke brought
UCLA ahead to stay.
The 5-4 loss completed the
sweep and left Stanford players
feeling justifiably low. "It hurts, it
hurts a lot," said Hammonds,
who went hitless for the series.
"This is not a team that should be
swept, (but) we just have to shake
this off and look at torn morrow as
a whole new day."

Third-ranked Stanford let its hope for a sec

ern Division baseball championship literally
slip through its hands this weekend.
What was once a close race with league lead
