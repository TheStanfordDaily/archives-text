# Delays spark displeasure
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Increased security measures, too few com
puters and a slightly longer ballot were the
main culprits behind long lines at poll sites and
a significant delay in tabulating the votes in
last week's ASSU election.
Many candidates were particularly upset
about the time it took to count the votes. Only
91 percent of the vote was counted by 3:30 a.m.
Friday, more than five hours after the polls
had closed. Last year, 97 percent of the vote
was recorded by 2:15 a.m.
But ASSU elections commissioner Raul
Lopez said the delay was necessary to guaran
tee added security and reliability in the vote
tabulation.
Lopez and graduate student Maurits van
der Veen counted the votes from the election,
which took place Wednesday and
Thursday. Last year, four or five
people computed the vote and
read their results to one person,
who recorded the final vote total,
Lopez said.
"We decided the make the pro
cess of tabulating the vote more
reliable by reducing the number
of people involved," Lopez said.
"Maurits and I worked in parallel
to get a valid, consistent total."
Van der Veen, who wrote the
computer program for the elec
tion, said the actual tallying of the
votes did not take very long â€”
they started counting at 1:30 a.m.
and finished two hours later. The
problem was in collecting the vot
ing results, stored in floppy disks
in the computers at the poll sites,
he said.
"We were quite seriously short
of poll watchers and we did not
get all of the information off the
computers until 11:30 p.m.," van
der Veen said. "We then had to
organize the information before
counting the votes."
It took the elections commis
sion more time this year to gather
the computer disks because of
additional polls sites at various
dormitories, van der Veen said.
The elections commission was
also forced to use a Macintosh
Classic to tabulate the votes, a
"very slow" computer, van der
Veen said. Faster computers were
available at the ASSU but were

not used because Lopez had
already stored and organized the
votes on the Classic.
Problems caused by computers
were not limited to tallying the
vote. Long lines also plagued the
poll sites.
Students took more time vot
ing this year because the com
puter ballot included a section for
comments.
Another problem was the num
ber of computers available for use
at each poll site. Apple Computer
had promised to provide 25 com
puters for the election but only
gave the election commission 15,
four of which did not work, Lopez
said.
Many poll watchers also did
not show up for their designated
times, causing late openings and
long lines at many polls sites.
In addition, several candidates
questioned the security of the bal
lots.
Many poll watchers typed the
computer password in front of the
voter. If a voter saw the password,
he could use it to vote multiple
times within a particular polling
place.
But Lopez said the elections
commission would notice any
"computer ballot-stuffing"
because the number of voters
entered at the registration com
puter should equal the number of
votes recorded.
Those numbers had not yet
been confirmed yesterday but
Lopez said the number of com
puter ballots and paper ballots
match the number of voters regis
tered "very closely."
