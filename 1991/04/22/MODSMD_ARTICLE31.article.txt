## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
I d McCaffrey and Kevin Scott
are heading East. Stanford foot
ball's senior standouts were both
drafted in the early rounds Sun
day, md will be joining the ranks
of th ■ NFL. this summer.
All-America wide-receiver Mc-
Caffrey was taken by the Super
Bowl Champion Now York Giants
with the last pick of the third
round Talented cornerback Scott
a up shortly after, by
the Li troit Lions, with the eighth
pick in the fourth round.
"I'm really excited and happy,"
said Scott from his home in

Phoenix, Ariz. "It's very relieving,
a weight off my shoulders. I wait
ing] was very nerve wracking.
"I'm also surprised because I
never expected Detroit. The Lions
never worked out with me [at the
scouting combines], and a couple
of different teams had called and
shown an interest. When they
called and said, 'This is Detroit,' I
said, 'Are you going to pick me?' "
Even with the surprise element
tossed in, Scott is elated. He was
the only defensive back selected
by the Lions yesterday, and they
are weak at corner and need
immediate help.
Scott may be looking at start
ing as a rookie, just as former

bnckfield-mate Alan Grant did for
the Indianapolis Colts last year.
"It's a good situation in
Detroit. They need me. Their sec
ondary has been weak," Scott
said. "I'm not walking into a situ
ation where I have to wait two or
three years, or I have to be
groomed behind an All-Pro.
"I'm going to have an impact
right away."
Even though McCaffrey wasn't
selected until the end of the third
and a number of receivers were
chosen before him, the Giants
seem like an ideal team for the
powerful receiver.
Not only are they are coming
off a Super Bowl victory, they need

a consistent wideout to open up
their passing game. McCaffrey is
Mr. Consistency. The squad's
home base in East Rutherford,
N.J. is also fairly close to McCaf
frey's family in Allentown, Pa.
"I started getting a little ner
vous when it got to the third
round and didn't get a call, but it
was worth the wait," he said.
The '91 event has been one of
the more unique drafts. The
expected top pick, Raghib
"Rocket" Ismail, defected and
signed with the Toronto Arg
onauts of the CFL for a reported
$26 million over four years.
The top five picks were subse
quently defensive selections.
