# Women love L.A., clinch Pac-10 title
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
In just under two weeks, the
Stanford Cardinal will find out
if its last month and a half has
been good enough.
Stanford closed out the reg
ular season with a succesful
weekend road trip to Southern
California. The Cardinal
downed USC 5-1 and UCLA 7-
2 to push its season mark to 22-
1, 10-0 in Pacific 10 Southern
Division play. USC dropped to
7-17, while UCLA-is now 20-4.
The victory over the Bruins
gave Stanford sole possession
of the Pac-10 crown. The Car
dinal has won the league cham
pionship four years in a row.
Since losing to Florida 6-0
on March 3, the Cardinal has
now won 11 straight matches
and has only been forced to
doubles twice — on both occa
sions the opponent was UCLA.
There is no doubt the shell
shock of the team's lone defeat
since 1988 has worn off. But a
nagging question remains: Can
Stanford beat the Lady Gators,
a team they'll likely meet in the
NCAA finals?
While the weekend's result
provided no definitive answers,
it did provide some clues, both
positive and negative:
• The Cardinal swept all
three doubles matches from
UCLA, re-establishing Stan
ford doubles as some of the
best in the nation;
• Senior Sandra Birch again
hammered former arch-neme
sis Trisha I-aux, serving notice
that she is at the top of her
game; but
• UCLA won at fifth and
sixth singles, raising some
doubts about the bottom third
of Stanford's lineup.
The UCLA match offered six
straight-set singles matches,
with the Cardinal taking the
top four against the latest
Bruin lineup-out-of-a-hat.
Coach Bill Zaima, who contin
ues to juggle his order without
much apparent rhyme or rea
son, had Stella Sampras in the
top spot Saturday to face Birch.
When the teams met two week
ago here, Sampras played No. 5.
It should come as no sur
prise that Birch won handily, 6-
4, 6-2. At second singles, the
matchup was the same as in
early April — as was the result.
Junior Debbie Graham downed
Kim Po 6-3, 6-2. Mamie Ceniza,
who previously slotted in at
No. 4, met senior Teri
Whitlinger at No. 3 — and lost.
Whitlinger, who was coming off
just the sixth loss of her career
Saturday, scored a 6-3, 6-3 win.
Sophomore Heather Wil
lens, a loser to Ceniza in the
last UCLA-Stanford match,
thrashed Iwalani McCalla
(who, believe it or not, played
No. 1 on April 6) 6-3, 6-1.
Kirsten Dreyer (once upon a
time UCLA's No. 3) bested
freshman Laxmi Poruri 6-3, 7-
6 (7-4) at No. 5. Finally, Cam
mie Foley avenged a narrow
defeat to junior Kylie Johnson
by recording a 6-2, 6-2 victory.

Needing just one doubles vic
tory, the Cardinal got three.
Birch and Graham downed
Sampras and Po 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Poruri and Whitlinger finished
off McCalla and Ceniza in three
sets as well, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
Finally, Willens and Emma
Woodhouse drubbed Dreyer
and Allegra Milholland 6-4, 6-4.

While the victory was no
doubt satisfying, Stanford may
well need more from the bot
tom third of the lineup to win
its sixth straight national
crown. Stanford has played
UCLA, Georgia and Florida
(the other teams in the top
four) a total of five times. In
those matches, Johnson is only
1-4 while Poruri is just 2-3.
Stanford will likely meet
Georgia and Florida in the
NCAA semis and finals, respec
tively. In those matches, John
son is 0-3, but Poruri looks
much better at 2-1.
On the positive side, Poruri
has won both her tilts with
Georgia's Shawn McCarthy
and, after getting demolished
6-0, 6-2 by the Bulldog's Tonya
Bogdonas at Indoors, Johnson
narrowly dropped the rematch
4-6, 7-5, 6-4.
Of course, both were beaten
by their Florida foes — Jillian
Alexander took out Poruri and
Holly Danforth dropped John
son — in the great debacle of
March 3. But Poruri's defeat
was a 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-4 nail
biter that could have easily
gone the other way.
The Cardinal still remains
dominant in the top four places
of the lineup, although Birch,
Graham, Whitlinger and Wil
lens were all victims of the
Lady Gators. Should Stanford
take three of four against
Florida — a must — a win at
five or six would go a long way.
None of this mattered
against once-mighty USC Fri
day. With Graham taking the
day off, Whitlinger moved up to
No. 2 and was upset by
Stephanie London 2-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Stanford's star — who could be
the best collegian to never play
No. 1 singles in history — is
now 97-6 in dual matches on
her career.
Birch followed up her first
ever win of Trisha Laux two
weeks ago with a 6-0, 6-1
blitzkrieg of the hard-hitting
USC ace. Birch should be
ranked No. 2 in the next Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate poll and the
1989 NCAA champ has to be
considered one of the favorite
for the individual singles title
this year.
Card notes
Stanford is in action at the Pac
-10 Individual Championships next
weekend in Ojai, Calif. Last year,
Graham beat Birch for the first
time in capturing the conference
crown.
