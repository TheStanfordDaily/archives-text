# Ruggers great run ends with loss to Cal
## 
### Tony Loffredo Staff writer 
Stanford's ruggers came one game
away from realizing their dream of
reaching the Final Four this year as the
California Golden Bears proved to be
too strong for a young and battered
Stanford squad in the finals of the
Pacific Coast Rugby Championships.
The entire Northern California Rugby
League has reason to celebrate, though,
as the top three finishers were Cal,
Stanford and Santa Clara.
"The fact that we made it to the final
game is an achievement in itself," said
hooker Glenn Jones. "Being seeded last
meant that we had to beat the toughest
teams to make it here."
On Friday, Stanford pulled off the
upset of the tournament by upsetting
first seed and Southern California
champions, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
After Simon Fleming-Wood juked Cal
Poly's entire back line, he passed to J.J.
Lasley for the game's first try. The dom
inance of Stanford's forward pack was

evident as they drove over Cal Poly's
forwards for a try to build a lead of 15-6
at the half.
Cal Poly closed the gap to two points
in the second half, but with 18 minutes
to go, Kevin Mesher dove on freshman
Kevin Linker's pop-kick in the try zone
to put the game away. Fleming-Wood's
conversion sealed the victory as Stan
ford went on to win 21-16.
In the semifinals, Stanford avenged a
regular-season loss by defeating Santa
Clara in front of a capacity crowd. After
trailing 6-3 at halftime, Ed Stevens
scored from a 5-meter scrum and Flem
ing-Wood converted to take the lead 9-6
in the first five minutes of the second
half.
But defense won this game for the
Cardinal as hard hits by the likes of
John Hamilton, Chuck Robinson and
Mark Hanson highlighted numerous
defensive stands against a determined
Santa Clara.
Fleming-Wood's tackle in the last 10
minutes set up a final try by Mark May
field to make the score 13-6.

Stanford blew its load, a load of play
ers that is, against Santa Clara as three
players left the game due to injuries.
And Chuck Robinson, while he still fin
ished the game, didn't know where he
was or even who he was. Postgame X
rays also revealed that John Hamilton's
swollen, closed eye was hiding a broken
cheekbone. As coach Franck Boivert put
it, "We were decimated."
Tom Klein, chair of the Stanford
Rugby Alumni Foundation, perhaps put
it best in his speech after the final game.
"On any given Saturday, 15 players can
beat anybody. But to win a tournament
where you play three consecutive
games, you need 25 first-team caliber
players."
Stanford's starting 15, including
eight rookies, donned bow-ties before
the championship game, but Cal was
quick to thwart Stanford's pregame
enthusiasm as they took an early 10-
point lead. From there Cal never looked
back.

Stanford rugby came tantalizingly close over the weekend, losing to California in the finals of the Pacific Coast Rugby
Championships. The Cardinal pulled the upset of the tourney, upsetting top-seed Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Friday.
Coach Boivert said, "Cal was
definitely the best team here
today. But it's too bad that we
didn't play them with a fresh
team or I'm sure we would have
beaten them."
Not to take anything away
from Cal, but they are no doubt
grateful for the rule that students
are allowed to play as long as they
don't graduate. The six- or seven
year veteran (no one knows

exactly how long), Australian
born Bschelet brothers, along
with ex-football speedster Fas
Tagaloa took full advantage of
this rule and proved to be major
factors for Cal.
Stanford will lose many play
ers to graduation, and no doubt
will miss the likes of Fleming-
Wood, who tallied 16 points on
the weekend, and the reticent
leadership of Tai Ho Chen. But
solid play by numerous newcom
ers will keep Cal and the rest of
the league on their toes for years
to come.

The inspired effort of fresh
man Brian Brennan and sopho
more Jerry Lewis' bonecrushing
stick on Andre Bschelet left
friends of Stanford Rugby anx
ious for the future.
As Tom Klein said, "Building a
good rugby team doesn't take var
sity players. It takes heart and
guts ." While Stanford has not
beaten Cal on the rugby Field
since 1980, it seems freshman
Kevin Linker's promise will
someday be fulfilled. After the
game he said, "We'll deFinitely
beat Cal before I graduate."

beaten them."
Not to take anything away
from Cal, but they are no doubt
grateful for the rule that students
are allowed to play as long as they
don't graduate. The six- or seven
year veteran (no one knows

exactly how long), Australian
born Bschelet brothers, along
with ex-football speedster Fas
Tagaloa took full advantage of
this rule and proved to be major
factors for Cal.
Stanford will lose many play
ers to graduation, and no doubt
will miss the likes of Fleming-
Wood, who tallied 16 points on
the weekend, and the reticent
leadership of Tai Ho Chen. But
solid play by numerous newcom
ers will keep Cal and the rest of
the league on their toes for years
to come.

The inspired effort of fresh
man Brian Brennan and sopho
more Jerry Lewis' bonecrushing
stick on Andre Bschelet left
friends of Stanford Rugby anx
ious for the future.
As Tom Klein said, "Building a
good rugby team doesn't take var
sity players. It takes heart and
guts ." While Stanford has not
beaten Cal on the rugby Field
since 1980, it seems freshman
Kevin Linker's promise will
someday be fulfilled. After the
game he said, "We'll deFinitely
beat Cal before I graduate."
