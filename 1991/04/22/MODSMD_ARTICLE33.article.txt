# Ruggers great run ends with loss to Cal
## 
### Tony Loffredo Staff writer 
Stanford's ruggers came one game
away from realizing their dream of
reaching the Final Four this year as the
California Golden Bears proved to be
too strong for a young and battered
Stanford squad in the finals of the
Pacific Coast Rugby Championships.
The entire Northern California Rugby
League has reason to celebrate, though,
as the top three finishers were Cal,
Stanford and Santa Clara.
"The fact that we made it to the final
game is an achievement in itself," said
hooker Glenn Jones. "Being seeded last
meant that we had to beat the toughest
teams to make it here."
On Friday, Stanford pulled off the
upset of the tournament by upsetting
first seed and Southern California
champions, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
After Simon Fleming-Wood juked Cal
Poly's entire back line, he passed to J.J.
Lasley for the game's first try. The dom
inance of Stanford's forward pack was

evident as they drove over Cal Poly's
forwards for a try to build a lead of 15-6
at the half.
Cal Poly closed the gap to two points
in the second half, but with 18 minutes
to go, Kevin Mesher dove on freshman
Kevin Linker's pop-kick in the try zone
to put the game away. Fleming-Wood's
conversion sealed the victory as Stan
ford went on to win 21-16.
In the semifinals, Stanford avenged a
regular-season loss by defeating Santa
Clara in front of a capacity crowd. After
trailing 6-3 at halftime, Ed Stevens
scored from a 5-meter scrum and Flem
ing-Wood converted to take the lead 9-6
in the first five minutes of the second
half.
But defense won this game for the
Cardinal as hard hits by the likes of
John Hamilton, Chuck Robinson and
Mark Hanson highlighted numerous
defensive stands against a determined
Santa Clara.
Fleming-Wood's tackle in the last 10
minutes set up a final try by Mark May
field to make the score 13-6.

Stanford blew its load, a load of play
ers that is, against Santa Clara as three
players left the game due to injuries.
And Chuck Robinson, while he still fin
ished the game, didn't know where he
was or even who he was. Postgame X
rays also revealed that John Hamilton's
swollen, closed eye was hiding a broken
cheekbone. As coach Franck Boivert put
it, "We were decimated."
Tom Klein, chair of the Stanford
Rugby Alumni Foundation, perhaps put
it best in his speech after the final game.
"On any given Saturday, 15 players can
beat anybody. But to win a tournament
where you play three consecutive
games, you need 25 first-team caliber
players."
Stanford's starting 15, including
eight rookies, donned bow-ties before
the championship game, but Cal was
quick to thwart Stanford's pregame
enthusiasm as they took an early 10-
point lead. From there Cal never looked
back.
