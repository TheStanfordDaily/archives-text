# Mastalir qualifies for NCAA championships

For many Stanford students, spring
quarter means sun bathing on Wilbur
Field, playing volleyball at the Oval and
taking as few classes as possible.
For members of the track team, it means
shifting into high gear. The heart of the sea
son is here and it is time to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
No one knows that better than senior
distance runner Mark Mastalir. At the
Stanford Collegiate Open Saturday, he won
the 1,500 meters in 3:41.3.
That mark not only reserved him a spot
in the NCAA field but also in The Athletic
Congress Championships and U.S. Olympic
Trials.
The race started with Matt Guisto tak
ing the lead. He is a former NCAA 5,000
meters champion. His role was to set a blis
tering pace for Mastalir. With a three-lap
2:57 he accomplished the task and dropped
off to the side of the track.
This left Mastalir all alone in front with
a lap to go. No one challenged him as he
sprinted the final 100 meters with his
teammates screaming encouragement.
"[Coach Brooks Johnson] told me, 'You
gotta go out there and make other people
hurt. Try to make the pace so hard, exact
such a price, that they wouldn't want to go
with you,' " Mastalir said.
In the women's 800 Saturday, Cardinal
sophomore Susan Helfter barely missed the
provisional NCAA qualifying time.

"They call her Suzy One-Speed. She has
the pedal to the metal the whole time.
That's her style. That's the way she's going
to get success," said Betsy Riccardi, the
team's assistant coach.
Although Helfter won the race, she
nearly didn't finish it. While hugging the
inside lane going around a turn she stepped
on the curb and stumbled. She quickly
recovered with barely a break in stride.
"If you let it get to you it's going to throw
your rhythm off and you're going to fall
apart. But that's not how she is. It could
have given her a surge of adrenalin," Ric
cardi said.
Something gave her a burst of energy
because she continued her torrid pace after
the stumble and extended her lead over the
pack to 15 meters. She crossed the line with
a personal record of 2:08.6, second best in
the Pacific 10 Conference this year.
Several other Stanford athletes also had
noteworthy performances. Jamie Marek
took second in the pole vault and Pat Stow
ell finished third in the discus.
Marcus Hickerson won the long jump
while David Popejoy was runner-up in the
hammer throw.
Freshman Dana Weeks placed second to
Sheila Hudson in the triple jump. Hudson,
a Cal graduate, holds the American record
of 46 feet, V* inches in this event.
Jackie Edwards won the long jump. Deb
bie Malueg took top honors in both discus
and shot put. Rhonda Oliver placed first in
the 200 while Peggy Odita won the high
jump.
