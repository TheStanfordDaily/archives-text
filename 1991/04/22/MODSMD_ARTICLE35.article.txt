# Lynch 3rd in NCAA individuals
## Gymnast receives All-America honors for efforts 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Jair Lynch brought home All-America
honors from the NCAA gymnastics champi
onships for the second straight year, but he
would rather have a team national champi
onship.
In the Cardinal's disappointing fifth
place performance on Thursday night, not
even Lynch was immune from mistakes.
His fall from the pommel horse dropped
him from first to seventh in the all-around
preliminaries.
But on Saturday night, given another
chance, Lynch came roaring back to place
third in the all-around finals.
Lynch carried almost all of Stanford's
hopes for redemption on his shoulders in

Saturday night's individual event finals,
although Jeff Bender performed very well
and finished 17th in the all-around and
junior Tim Ryan competed on high bar.
Despite his gritty comeback in the all
around, Lynch missed opportunities to win
the high bar and parallel bars events. He
was seeded first and second respectively
going into these events, but finished sev
enth and tied for fifth.
Next year, Lynch and Ryan will lead the
Cardinal through the season and probably
to the NCAA championships again.
And maybe, if they can learn from this
past weekend, Lynch and his teammates
will get that team national championship
that they want so badly. Lynch warns other
teams that Stanford will be back â€” "This is
just the start."
