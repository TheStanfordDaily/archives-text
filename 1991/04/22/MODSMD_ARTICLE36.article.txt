## 
### Kevin Jeffery Staff writer 
The Cardinal's last hope to pull off the
biggest upset of the 1991 NCAA volleyball
season was dashed by a furious USC 10-3
run in the second game of Saturday's
match. Along with it went Stanford's bid
for the final berth in the Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association postseason
tournament.

The Trojans' dominating 15-11, 15-13,
15-5 victory in the regular-season finale at
Maples Pavilion, coupled with Long Beach
State's four-game win over UC-Santa Bar
bara, eliminated Stanford from tourna
ment play. The seventh and eighth WIVA
playoff berths went to Loyola Marymount
and Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal finished the season 8-13
overall and 5-11 in WIVA play, in a tie for
fourth in the Wilson division. UCSB and
Loyola also ended the year 5-11, but beat
out Stanford in the tiebreaker scenario to
qualify for the WIVA tournament.
The Trojans lifted their WIVA record to
a perfect 16-0, and finished 25-1 overall.
Wednesday USC will face DeGroot division
champion UCLA, who dealt them their only
loss, for an automatic berth in the NCAA
Final Four.
After a first game in which USC had an
answer to every Cardinal run, Stanford
jumped to a 10-5 lead in the second, and
looked like they were going to swing the
momentum of the match.
But at that point the Cardinal offense
stalled, and the Trojans raced to a 14-12
lead, taking advantage of four stuffs of
Stanford outside hitter Bob Hillman and a
couple of Cardinal mental errors.
Stanford staved off nine game points,
but in the process could only close within
14-13 as Trojan outside hitter Brian Ivie
was making sideouts at will. The 1990
NCAA Player of the Year had six kills on six

attempts in the sequence. Ivie eventually
scored the kill that gave USC a 15-13 game
two win and an insurmountable two
games-to-none lead.
"We had our chances in both of the first
two games, but USC just showed they were
the better team by tightening their belts
and not allowing us to score points when
the games got close," said Cardinal coach
Ruben Nieves.
"We made a couple of crucial mistakes
late, like letting a free ball drop for a point,
that you just can't have if you're going to
compete with a team like USC. Plus, we
made too many hitting errors when we
were swinging for points. It's good to be
aggressive, but we needed to put pressure
on them by keeping the ball in play," Nieves
added.
Hitting errors again plagued Stanford in
the third game, and they never got on track
after the Trojans gained an early 5-0 lead.
Ivie characteristically led the Trojan
arsenal, which hit .446 (42 points higher
than its nation-leading average), with 23
kills for a .417 hitting percentage. That per
formance was the result of the Cardinal's
best job of containing Ivie in their four
matches this season, but Stanford was hurt
this time by USC's other weapons.
Senior outside hitter Nick Becker
pounded 20 kills, and surprise starter Jen-
Kai Liu scored 19 kills and hit .464. Liu, the
MVP of the 1988 Final Four, was starting
his first match against the Cardinal this
season after recovering from a knee injury.
The Cardinal hit a feeble .293, the result
of numerous hitting errors and an excellent
blocking match by the Trojans, led by Ivie's
eight stuffs. Outside hitter Duncan Black
man had a great night offensively, scoring
21 kills for a .438 hitting clip. He also had
three aces and forced numerous bad Trojan
passes with his menacing jump serve.
The Cardinal found out after the match
that they wouldn't back into the playoffs as
Long Beach had downed the Gauchos.
"We shouldn't feel sorry for ourselves
about not making the (WIVA) tournament.
We had a lot of chances to earn that sixth
victory that would have put us in, we just
never came through. We got what we
deserved," said Nieves.
