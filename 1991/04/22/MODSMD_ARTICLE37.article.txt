# Golfers looking to rebound at Pac-10s

After taking a pounding at
the hands of its Pacific 10 Con
ference arch-rivals Arizona
State, Arizona and UCLA in
the«Lariv 3iin»fV*jl invite#
tional over a week ago, the
women's golf team has the
opportunity to atone for its
performance beginning today
in the Pac-10 Championships
in Eugene, Ore.
"We're not about to take a
back seat to anyone," said
coach Tim Baldwin. "We feel
like we can win the tourna
ment."
Although the Cardinal is
ranked sixth in the nation, the
women know that they need a
strong showing not only to
build momentum entering the
NCAA Championships, but to
secure their spot in the
national championships held at
Ohio State in the last week of
May.
"The top 15 teams are really
close," said Baldwin. "We need
to play extremely well to assure
ourselves of the NCAA tourna
ment."
The Cardinal cannot really
count any team out as a poten
tial threat to the Pac-10 title —
with the exception of Cal.
In the Lady Sun Devil Invi
tational in Tempe, Ariz., the
home team, Arizona State,
drilled Stanford by 38 strokes
en route to finishing second.
After their outrageous
showing, the Sun Devils
climbed up the rankings from

24 to 18. However, Arizona
State needs to be among the
top 17 teams in the nation to be
invited to the NCAA Champi
onships.
"We're looking for them to
put up a fight," said Baldwin of
Arizona-State.
Although the Cardinal can
not overlook the Sun Devils,
they know that their toughest
competition will come from the
likes of No. 2 Arizona and No. 3
UCLA. Arizona crushed Stan
ford by 32 strokes in the Lady
Sun Devil, while UCLA was
bettered by only a couple of
strokes.
"UCLA and Arizona are the
definite favorites," said junior
Stephanie Davis.
In last year's Pac-10 cham
pionships, UCLA put a twist to
the rankings with a surprise
victory over eventual NCAA
champion Arizona St.and —and
Arizona also turned the tables
over on its state rivals, taking
second by a stroke.
Baldwin is not looking for
one player in particular to
carry the load of the tourna
ment.
Despite a rocky tournament
in Arizona, junior Adele Moore,
ranked 18th in the NCAA, is
returning as the team's No. 1
golfer.
"Adele will rebound," said
Baldwin. "She's played so
much that she will be prepared
for this." Jodi Figley, the lone
Cardinal senior, will be making
her final appearance in the
Pac-10 Championships this
week.
