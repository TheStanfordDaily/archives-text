# Men's golf swings to 5th place
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
At least one of the top 20 men's
golf teams in the nation will have
to step aside this week — to make
room for the Cardinal.
The men's golf team stunned
the 24-team field in the three-day
U.S. Intercollegiate Golf Tourna
ment held this weekend on the
Stanford Golf Course, shooting
877 on the way to a fifth-place fin
ish.

Cardinal takes fifth
at U.S. Intercollegiate

Before the tournament, coach
Wally Goodwin said that he would
be "satisfied" with a top-10 finish
after a somewhat rusty appear
ance the week before in the Etonic
Southwest Intercollegiate Cham
pionships.
"But a top-six finish would be
great," he also added.
"We did fantastic with that
kind of field," said junior Chris
tian Cevaer. The Cardinal shot
299, 292 and 286 in the first, sec
ond and third days, respectively.
"Even though we played on our
home course, our improvement
over the three days really shows
me that something is cooking,"
said Goodwin.
Arizona, ranked third in the
NCAA, ran away with the tourney
as they shot a 54-hole course
record of 861, an average of 71.75
a golfer on the 71-par course. Sec
ond-ranked North Carolina fin
ished second, but only three
strokes ahead of the Cardinal and

two ahead of No. 4 Florida and
No. 5 Oklahoma State.
The 24th-ranked Cardinal
crushed the likes of Pacific 10
Conference nemeses USC, UCLA
and top-ranked Arizona State
because of the incredible final day
play of Casey Martin. Martin, a
freshman from Eugene, Ore., hit
six under par in what was one of
the best single-day performances
in Cardinal golf history.
After following a birdie on the
third hole with a par on the
fourth, Martin made a run of five
straight birdies on holes five
through 10. He shot par on all of
the remaining holes with the
exception of a birdie on hole 17.
"This is the most competitive
day I've ever had," said Martin.
As the veteran Cevaer said,
"The key to our showing was
Casey's 65." Martin finished the
tourney tied for 10th with an
overall total of 216, while Cevaer
bettered him by a stroke to finish
tied for sixth.
For Cevaer, a native of Cannes,
France, his 72 on the last day was
somewhat of a disappointment.
"Christian had another solid per
formance today," said Goodwin.
"But he was disappointed because
he was in a position to win the
tournament and nothing extraor
dinary happened today for him."
After two days, Cevaer was tied
for fourth individually and only
four strokes behind the leader.
But he "didn't convert on at least
10 birdie opportunities" yesterday
after shooting a competitive one
under on the front nine holes.
Every one of the Cardinal
golfers played in the tourney
because Stanford was the host

team. And the performances of
some of the golfers not among the
starting five were quite impres
sive.
Dave Rutkowski, a sophomore
from Traverse City, Minn., shot
217 for the tourney and finished
tied for 12th. Rutkowski, who has
been the Cardinal's fifth link for
much of the season, was only bet
tered by Cevaer and Martin on the
Stanford squad.
Sophomore Brad Lanning of
Sarasota, Fla. was not far off the
mark of Rutkowski as he shot 220
for the tourney and tied for 23rd
overall.
Notah Begay, a freshman from
Albuquerque, averaged 73.3 on
the weekend to finish a stroke
behind Lanning, while sophomore
Mike Milliken hit 226 overall.
Chris Doble, a junior from
Zionsville, Ind., made his first
NCAA appearance for the Cardi
nal at the No. 5 slot. Last week he
edged Rutkowski by a stroke to
qualify as the fifth golfer in the
tourney. In the first two days he
struggled, shooting an 80 the first
day and an 84 the second. But
yesterday he was among the top
four linksters with a 75 on the
day.
"His performance yesterday
shows me something about his
character," said Goodwin.
Although his starting five
golfers did not have the five best
scores on the team, Goodwin
looked upon his team's perfor
mance in a realistic light.
"That's the way it goes," said
Goodwin. "Golf is an elusive
sport. I was proud that nobody
pushed us around despite our
age."

tournament and nothing extraor
dinary happened today for him."
After two days, Cevaer was tied
for fourth individually and only
four strokes behind the leader.
But he "didn't convert on at least
10 birdie opportunities" yesterday
after shooting a competitive one
under on the front nine holes.
Every one of the Cardinal
golfers played in the tourney
because Stanford was the host

team. And the performances of
some of the golfers not among the
starting five were quite impres
sive.
Dave Rutkowski, a sophomore
from Traverse City, Minn., shot
217 for the tourney and finished
tied for 12th. Rutkowski, who has
been the Cardinal's fifth link for
much of the season, was only bet
tered by Cevaer and Martin on the
Stanford squad.
Sophomore Brad Lanning of
Sarasota, Fla. was not far off the
mark of Rutkowski as he shot 220
for the tourney and tied for 23rd
overall.
Notah Begay, a freshman from
Albuquerque, averaged 73.3 on
the weekend to finish a stroke
behind Lanning, while sophomore
Mike Milliken hit 226 overall.
Chris Doble, a junior from
Zionsville, Ind., made his first
NCAA appearance for the Cardi
nal at the No. 5 slot. Last week he
edged Rutkowski by a stroke to
qualify as the fifth golfer in the
tourney. In the first two days he
struggled, shooting an 80 the first
day and an 84 the second. But
yesterday he was among the top
four linksters with a 75 on the
day.
"His performance yesterday
shows me something about his
character," said Goodwin.
Although his starting five
golfers did not have the five best
scores on the team, Goodwin
looked upon his team's perfor
mance in a realistic light.
"That's the way it goes," said
Goodwin. "Golf is an elusive
sport. I was proud that nobody
pushed us around despite our
age."
