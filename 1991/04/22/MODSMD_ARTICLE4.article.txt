# ASSU amendments possibly contradict
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
The debate over what to
debate goes on even after two
amendments addressing the
scope of ASSU discussion were
passed in last week's election.
The amendment authors
disagree over whether consti
tutional amendments 1 and 4
conflict. While graduate sena
tors John Overdeck and Dou
glas Bone said they believe
both amendments can be added
to the constitution, undergrad
uate senators Mike Curry and
Naomi Onaga said their
amendment cancels out parts
of Overdeck and Bone's.
The Overdeck-Bone scope

amendment, CA-1, bars debate
of off-campus issues unless
"there is at least one Stanford
student who is affected by the
matter in a substantially differ
ent manner than would be the
case if he or she were not a Uni
versity student."
The Curry-Onaga account
ability amendment, CA-4,
requires the authors of bills on
state, national or international
issues to gather student opin
ion through polls and open
forums before submitting the
bill to the ASSU Senate.
Because about 80 percent of
the voters supported CA-4
compared to CA-l's approxi
mately 68 percent approval,
Curry said sections of his amend
ment override conflicting sections
of the Overdeck-Bone amend
ment.
But Bone said there is no con
flict. "They apply to slightly dif
ferent issues," he said. "The cru
cial thing here is while CA-1 pro
hibits things not directly affecting

Stanford students, there are
state, national and international
issues that directly affect Stan
ford students."
He added that off-campus
issues not prohibited by CA-1
would be covered by CA-4, and
opinions would have to be gath
ered on any bill dealing with
issues in this category.
Bone said the bylaws define a
"conflict" as a situation in which
sections of two amendments, if
both certified, could not be imple
mented.

"[The amendments] are not
mutually exclusive," he said.
Overdeck agreed that both
amendments are valid. CA-4 "is
an issue of accountability, and
ours is an issue of scope. They
change completely different sec
tions of the bylaws," he said.
Curry disagreed. "One allows
state and national issues, and the
other does not," he said. The
problem is that the ASSU does
not have a judicial branch to
interpret the constitution, Curry
said. "Ultimatelv, it will be the

senate that decides."
The senate will be able to con
sider the amendments before it
finally certifies the election
results, which should take place
two weeks after the election is
validated.
Onaga said interpretation of
the amendments is going to be
critical. "This is something that
needs to be discussed." She said
she thinks students may have
been confused by the amend
ments because they were "not
concrete enough."
