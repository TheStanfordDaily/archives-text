An early morning blaze swept through the Palo
Alto home of a University employee Saturday, forc
ing him to break through a second-floor window and
leap from his burning house, fire officials said.
Adrian Chan, 24, a project coordinator for the
Institute for International Studies and a 1988 Stan
ford graduate, jumped from a window of the two
story home he shared with six others at 1004 Emer
son St. shortly after a fire broke out around 3:30 am.
Chan was transported to the burn unit of the
Santa Clara Valley Hospital in San Jose, where yes
terday he was listed in "stable but critical condition",
a nurse said.
A hospital spokesperson said Chan sustained sec
ond and third degree burns on nearly 10 percent of
his body. The majority of the injuries occurred on his
arms and legs, she said.
Chan was placed on a respirator because of smoke
inhalation injuries. He is expected to be taken off the
respirator in a few days, a hospital spokesperson
said.
Hospital officials did not say whether Chan sus
tained additional injuries from jumping out the win
dow.

A preliminary investigation this weekend of the
fire's cause pointed to a faulty electrical heating unit
in a heat lamp used to warm a tank containing a pet
snake. Fire officials will continue their investigation
today.
Four other residents were on the ground floor of
the dwelling when the fire began. Three escaped
without serious injury, Palo Alto Battalion Chief Don
Shaw wrote in a report on the fire.
The fourth, who was not identified, reportedly
was treated for minor burns and blisters at a local
hospital and released. The two other residents were
away at the time of the fire.
Neighbors said they were awakened when a "loud
explosion" shook their homes on the 1000 block of
Emerson during the pre-dawn hours Saturday.
One neighbor, Donald Ellison, who lives across
the street from the house, was awakened by the
barking of his three cocker spaniels. The 60-year-old
resident said he looked out his window and saw
plumes of fire. He added that he later received a call
from police to evacuate his home.
"It looked like a blowtorch," Ellison said. "I never
saw such a fire. The flames were just shooting out."
More than 36 firefighters brought the blaze under
control at 5 a.m. Firefighters came from Menlo Park
and Los Altos in addition to Palo Alto.
