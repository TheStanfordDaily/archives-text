# Smaller Earth Day expected
## 
### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
One year after the well-publi
cized Earth Day 1990 festivities,
Earth Day 1991, celebrated today,
will be smaller — but will aim for
results just as ambitious as those
of last year's events.
At Stanford, those results have
included increased recycling levels
that began to shoot upward imme
diately after last year's Earth Day.
Today's on-campus events will
include several speakers, a rally in
White Plaza, information tables,
opportunities to sign up for a tree
planting project and a perfor
mance by the band Virginia Sigh,
said sophomore Phoebe Marritt of
Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford.
Speakers will include represen
tatives from the California Public
Interest Research Group, Citizens
for a Better Environment and the
Sierra Club. All of these groups
will also sponsor information
tables. In addition, Rain Forest
Action Network, Environmental
Defense Fund and Zero Popula
tion will also have tables.
Representatives at other
booths will provide opportunities
to sign petitions for Greenpeace
and write letters to members of
the government, Marritt said.
After last year's "huge festi
val," the focus of this year's Earth
Day will be "to make saving the
environment part of your every
day life," Marritt said. Another
goal is to "get people excited and
into the festivities of saving the
environment," she added.
Many of the organizations that
will be represented will also- be
trying to recruit students for sum
mer work, Marritt said.
Because last year's Earth Day
was the 20th anniversary of the
first Earth Day, it was "bound to
be a much bigger thing," Marritt
said.

Sophomore Tim Choy, also of
SEAS, said last year's Earth Day
was international and was meant
to "kick off the decade." He said
this year's is a chance to examine
oneself: "Was it just a big concert
for us, or have we changed our
selves?"
Last year, SEAS sponsored
Earth Week, which featured a dif
ferent environmental theme for
each day and culminated on Earth
Day. Members camped out in
White Plaza all week, using solar
cells to power light bulbs
Earth Week featured several

panels, dorm presentations and
exhibits, and Earth Day included
a sunrise ceremony, the Earth Day
Fun Run and a rally which began
at Frost Amphitheater and ended
in a San Francisco march along
with thousands of Northern Cali
fornia students.
Last year's efforts did make a
difference, at least at Stanford.
The Stanford Recycling Center
has experienced a marked
increase in volume of recycled
materials, which began last April
and has not dropped off, said
Heidi Clark, the center's public

education manager.
By last May, the recycling cen
ter was taking in 60 percent more
recyclable materials than the
monthly average for the 1989-
1990 school year, Clark said. The
lowest volume since then was in
September, when most students
are not on campus, and even then
the volume was 14 percent higher
than the 1989-1990 average.
For every other month, includ
ing the summer months, recycling
volumes have stayed at least 35
percent higher than the 1989-
1990 average, Clark noted.
