# Living in focus houses evokes mixed feelings
## 
### Sarah Truitt Staff writer 
When Glenn Voyles was
preparing to move into Robinson
House last fall, he and his draw
mates were less than enthusiastic
about the prospect of a year spent
in Stanford's gender issues focus
house.
"We were all scared to death
when we came in here, and we
thought we were just going to be
bashed apart by these evil Ama
zon women," he said.
It didn't take long, however, for
Voyles to realize that the house's
atmosphere is little different from
any other and that not everyone
has to subscribe to the focus. "It's
not really the case that people go
overboard. It's just like a normal
dorm, but it has a common unify
ing theme for everyone," he said.
Voyles is one of many residents
who, expecting the worst, have

found themselves sometimes
appreciative of, often apathetic
about, but rarely opposed to the
programming in Stanford's two
focus houses.
Most Sterling Quad residents
had no plans to live in a focus
house. In both Robinson and
Adams, the human biology focus
house, fewer than 10 percent of
the residents are majoring in the
focus subject. In addition, neither
house offers priorities for stu
dents interested in living there.
"We didn't care whether we got
into the focus houses or just a reg
ular house like Schiff," said
Adams resident Jim Gardner.
Adams became a focus house in
1986; Robinson, in 1989. Unlike
many theme houses, which
require residents to take classes
or participate in activities related
to the theme, focus houses offer
more relaxed programming and
discussions on the focus area.
New residents, nevertheless,
are often concerned when they
unexpectedly draw into a focus
house.
"In the beginning, there was a
little bit of resistance and confu
sion," said Michelle Kramer, an
Adams focus assistant. Residents
were concerned they might get
"human biology shoved down
their throats." However, she said,
they realized that this was not the
purpose of the focus houses.
Michelle Finkel, a Robinson
focus assistant, said, "A lot of peo
ple in the dorm who are friends
have confided in me that at first
they were really hesitant about
the focus, and they were really
worried about being attacked."
"We tried to take on this atti

tude that we were going to make
the environment nonjudgmen
tal."
The staff tries to accomplish
that by offering a wide range of
programming. At Robinson, pro
grams have included a talk on
body image, a discussion of alter
native families and a rap session
on the Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue. Adams hosts faculty recep
tions and dinners for residents
who are human biology majors
along with programs that detail
differences between human biol
ogy and biology.
Asked about her initial feelings
after drawing into Adams, resi
dent Holly Haskew, a sophomore,
said, "We thought there were
going to be a bunch of bookwormy
pre-meds, but it's not like that at
all."
Robinson resident Barbara
Metz added, "I think it's good to
have a focus in the house. It pro
vides continuity and some reason
to have programs."

Some residents also appreciate
the fact that the focus houses
sponsor programs not available in
many other dorms.
"I've been exposed to things
that I probably wouldn't have
been able to see otherwise," said
Adams resident Omar Siddiqui.
"The programs I have gone to
have been enlightening, and look
ing back on it, I wish I had gone to
more."
Focus assistants in both houses
admitted that some programs are
poorly attended.
"Living in the human biology
theme house has not been a nega
tive experience for me, but I'm not
active in it," said Caren Chen, an
Adams resident. She said she feels
guilty about not attending pro
grams but does not go because she
has other interests.
"[The focus] really makes little
difference to me, but one of the
nicest things about the [focus
assistants] is that they're not mil
itant about their theme," said

Robinson resident Kyle Lee.
Despite varying attendance at
house programs, though, the resi
dence staffs say the houses fulfill
their purpose.
Adams resident fellow Lorraine
Morgan described the human biol
ogy focus as "very beneficial for a
bridge between academics and
dorm life."
"We've tried to do something
for everyone," said Kramer. The
dorm has hosted speakers on such
topics as faith-healing and aging,
she said.
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, resi
dent fellow at Robinson, said she
moved to the house because the
focus "might create energy" and
cure any "apathy" that might
tend to characterize an upperclass
house.
"Even if a person's not inter
ested in the specific topic of the
focus house, it's valuable to have
programs available," said Finkel,
a Robinson focus assistant.

were concerned they might get
"human biology shoved down
their throats." However, she said,
they realized that this was not the
purpose of the focus houses.
Michelle Finkel, a Robinson
focus assistant, said, "A lot of peo
ple in the dorm who are friends
have confided in me that at first
they were really hesitant about
the focus, and they were really
worried about being attacked."
"We tried to take on this atti

tude that we were going to make
the environment nonjudgmen
tal."
The staff tries to accomplish
that by offering a wide range of
programming. At Robinson, pro
grams have included a talk on
body image, a discussion of alter
native families and a rap session
on the Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue. Adams hosts faculty recep
tions and dinners for residents
who are human biology majors
along with programs that detail
differences between human biol
ogy and biology.
Asked about her initial feelings
after drawing into Adams, resi
dent Holly Haskew, a sophomore,
said, "We thought there were
going to be a bunch of bookwormy
pre-meds, but it's not like that at
all."
Robinson resident Barbara
Metz added, "I think it's good to
have a focus in the house. It pro
vides continuity and some reason
to have programs."

Some residents also appreciate
the fact that the focus houses
sponsor programs not available in
many other dorms.
"I've been exposed to things
that I probably wouldn't have
been able to see otherwise," said
Adams resident Omar Siddiqui.
"The programs I have gone to
have been enlightening, and look
ing back on it, I wish I had gone to
more."
Focus assistants in both houses
admitted that some programs are
poorly attended.
"Living in the human biology
theme house has not been a nega
tive experience for me, but I'm not
active in it," said Caren Chen, an
Adams resident. She said she feels
guilty about not attending pro
grams but does not go because she
has other interests.
"[The focus] really makes little
difference to me, but one of the
nicest things about the [focus
assistants] is that they're not mil
itant about their theme," said

Robinson resident Kyle Lee.
Despite varying attendance at
house programs, though, the resi
dence staffs say the houses fulfill
their purpose.
Adams resident fellow Lorraine
Morgan described the human biol
ogy focus as "very beneficial for a
bridge between academics and
dorm life."
"We've tried to do something
for everyone," said Kramer. The
dorm has hosted speakers on such
topics as faith-healing and aging,
she said.
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, resi
dent fellow at Robinson, said she
moved to the house because the
focus "might create energy" and
cure any "apathy" that might
tend to characterize an upperclass
house.
"Even if a person's not inter
ested in the specific topic of the
focus house, it's valuable to have
programs available," said Finkel,
a Robinson focus assistant.
