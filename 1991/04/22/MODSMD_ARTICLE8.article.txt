# Graduate schools garner honors in survey of universities
## 
### Eden Quainton 
The results of U.S. News and World
Report's annual beauty contest for gradu
ate schools were published today in the
magazine's special issue on "America's Best
Graduate Schools."
While Stanford may not have won the
swimsuit competition, it can lay claim to
the pageant's crown.
Stanford was alone among the nation's
universities to place in the top ten for each
category of professional school surveyed,
ranking second among business and
engineering schools, fourth among law
schools and eighth among medical schools.
Stanford's Business and Law Schools
slipped slightly from their first- and third

place rankings in last year's survey, but the
School of Engineering maintained its sec
ond-place position and the School of
Medicine jumped from last year's twelfth
place showing.
Harvard University garnered the top
ranking for its business and medical
schools, while Yale LTniversity and MIT led
the nation's law schools and engineering
schools, respectively.
The survey ranked the schools by com
paring their reputations among academics
and professionals, their selectivity in
admitting students, their faculty resources
and their students' success in finding
employment after graduation.
Stanford faculty members expressed
both pleasure at the high rankings and

skepticism about the value and reliability
of the survey.
Law School Dean Paul Brest said, "It's
always nice to be at the top," but added
that "The survey isn't very good."
Stanford's success in encouraging stu
dents to explore public interest careers may
actually have worked against the Law
School in the survey, he said.
In the student placement category, in
which Stanford ranked 17th, the survey
emphasizes factors such as graduates'
starting salaries. Since public-interest
organizations pay recent graduates far less
than do large law firms, a school's success
in promoting public interest work may lead
to a lower overall ranking in the survey,
Brest said.

School of Engineering Dean James Gib
bons, while generally pleased with Stan
ford's ranking, took sharp exception to the
survey's "selectivity" category, in which
Stanford ranked 58th.
"I'm absolutely certain that the electri
cal engineering, mechanical engineering
and aeronautics students we get are as
good as exist," he said.
Stanford has attracted such a dispropor
tionate share of the nation's top fifty elec
trical engineering students during the last
few years, he said, that UC-Berkeley
recently initiated a new program called
"friends of the fifty" designed to woo some
of these students awav from Stanford.
Charles Bonini, associate dean
of the Graduate School of Busi
ness, also questioned the reliabil
ity of the selectivity statistics.
Stanford's business school
ranked second in selectivity, even
though it admits only one student
in ten, while Harvard's, which
admits one student in six, ranked
first.
Bonini added that the most
serious problem with the U.S.
News and World Report survey
and others like it is that they sub
merge real differences in philoso
phy, focus and opportunities at
various graduate schools.
