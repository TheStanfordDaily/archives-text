# Chappies won't be disqualified
## Slate wanted to prevent runoff; fee losers try to get on ballot

Just ask the Hammer and Coffin

themselves yesterday to prevent a runoff.
high-school students to continue'
on to college, was left off the orig
inal ballot. It will appear for the
first time on the runoff ballot.
Senate Chair Solina Kwan said
she will introduce separate bills at
tonight's ASSU Senate meeting to
put the special-fcc requests of
MEChA and XTV on the runoff
ballot. Both bills require two
thirds approval by the senate, said
Kwan, a junior.
The runoff will be held May 2-3
and will be on a paper ballot, said
elections commissioner Raul
Lopez, a graduate student.
Kwan said she supports a "sec
ond chance" for MEChA and XTV
because of irregularities in the
election procedure and the close
results of their vote.
XTV's budget did not appear in
the election handbook, possibly
hurting its chance of approval,
said station manager Dave Hol
land.
"There were extenuating cir
cumstances because, despite the
fact that we turned in our budget
on time, it was not included in the

election handbook," said Holland,
a senior. "Part of the reason why
the students did not approve us
the first time was our lack of visi
bility, which we will work to
change before the runoff elec
tion."
MEChA co-chair Maria Peters,
a sophomore, said the
Chicano/Latino student group's
special-fee request was hurt by
irregularities in both the election
handbook and The Daily's
endorsement process.
Peters said The Daily's edito
rial board never managed to con
tact members of MEChA to set-up
an endorsement interview, result
ing in a "No Recommendation" in
its list of special-fee endorse
ments.
But according to editor in chief
Janine DeFao, the opinions edi
tors called three times and left
messages for freshman Russell
Calleros, whose name was given
to them by Lopez as the contact
person for MEChA's request.
"I'm sorry this unfortunate
logistical situation occurred,"
DeFao said, "but we really tried to
get in touch with them."
No one from the group con
tacted The Daily before the
endorsements were published.

DeFao added that several
groups which received "No Rec
ommendation," including the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, the Concert Network and
the Stanford Volunteer Network,
won their fees. In addition, the
ASSU Lobby Office and XTV,
which were endorsed, were voted
down by the students.
The election handbook
included an incomplete statement
ofMEChA's actions, neglecting to
mention many of the community
activities sponsored by the organi
zation, Peters said.
The supporters of the ASSU
lobby office, which was soundly
rejected by the students, will
probably introduce a referendum
calling on the senate to allocate
funds to create a financial-aid
lobby office, according to senator
David Brown, a senior. The lobby
office, which was new to the ballot
this year, would have provided
students with a means to lobby
state and national legislators.
Senator Naomi Onaga said a
financial-aid lobby office is sup
ported by the students because
the referendum asking students if
they supported the ASSU taking
steps to work for financial aid
passed overwhelmingly. Minor

changes could be made in the
structure of the office and stu
dents might then approve the
office in the runoff election, said
Onaga, a senior.
Both Brown and Onaga cited
the 1989 election for precedent in
allowing an organization another
chance in a runoff election. In
that election, the Stanford Axe
Committee was rejected but sub
mitted a second budget accompa
nied by 1,500 signatures and was
placed on the ballot a second time.
Although 56 of the voters
approved the Axe Committee in
the runoff election, too few stu
dents voted in the runoff for them
to garner the necessary 15 per
cent approval from the entire stu
dent body.
But hearings officer Jason
Moore said that placing a jilted
organization on a runoff ballot
was an "invalid precedent" and
that senators should not consider
it when voting.
Supporters of the various spe
cial-fee requests have said they
will pack tonight's special senate
meeting to try to convince the
senate to give them another
chance. Senators are also
expected to validate the results of
last week's election tonight.

messages for freshman Russell

to them by Lopez as the contact

"I'm sorry this unfortunate
logistical situation occurred,"
DeFao said, "but we really tried to
get in touch with them."
No one from the group con
tacted The Daily before the
endorsements were published.

DeFao added that several
groups which received "No Rec
ommendation," including the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, the Concert Network and
the Stanford Volunteer Network,
won their fees. In addition, the
ASSU Lobby Office and XTV,
which were endorsed, were voted
down by the students.
The election handbook
included an incomplete statement
ofMEChA's actions, neglecting to
mention many of the community
activities sponsored by the organi
zation, Peters said.
The supporters of the ASSU
lobby office, which was soundly
rejected by the students, will
probably introduce a referendum
calling on the senate to allocate
funds to create a financial-aid
lobby office, according to senator
David Brown, a senior. The lobby
office, which was new to the ballot
this year, would have provided
students with a means to lobby
state and national legislators.
Senator Naomi Onaga said a
financial-aid lobby office is sup
ported by the students because
the referendum asking students if
they supported the ASSU taking
steps to work for financial aid
passed overwhelmingly. Minor

changes could be made in the
structure of the office and stu
dents might then approve the
office in the runoff election, said
Onaga, a senior.
Both Brown and Onaga cited
the 1989 election for precedent in
allowing an organization another
chance in a runoff election. In
that election, the Stanford Axe
Committee was rejected but sub
mitted a second budget accompa
nied by 1,500 signatures and was
placed on the ballot a second time.
Although 56 of the voters
approved the Axe Committee in
the runoff election, too few stu
dents voted in the runoff for them
to garner the necessary 15 per
cent approval from the entire stu
dent body.
But hearings officer Jason
Moore said that placing a jilted
organization on a runoff ballot
was an "invalid precedent" and
that senators should not consider
it when voting.
Supporters of the various spe
cial-fee requests have said they
will pack tonight's special senate
meeting to try to convince the
senate to give them another
chance. Senators are also
expected to validate the results of
last week's election tonight.
Getting disqualified from an ASSU
election is pretty difficult these days.
Just ask the Hammer and Coffin
Council of Presidents slate, which
tried — and failed — to get itself dis
qualified yesterday to prevent a
runoff.
"Click Here for Fee Refund" COP
slate member Michael Schreiber went
to the elections commission asking to
be disqualified because he and slate

member David Levin are graduating
seniors and should have been declared
ineligible before the election.
Hearings officer Jason Moore, a
junior, ruled that Schreiber and Levin
would have been able to serve as COP
for several weeks before they gradu
ated, making them eligible candidates.
If the Chaparral slate had been dis
qualified, their votes would not have
been counted. Students First would
have had a majority of the votes cast
and would have been declared the out
right winner, eliminating the need for

a runoff.
Schreiber said his action was an
attempt to prevent a runoff that he
feels is being abused by student orga
nizations who lost their special-fee
request in last week's election.
These student groups, which
include XTY MEChA and the ASSU
lobby office, are asking to be placed on
the runoff ballot.

themselves yesterday to prevent a runoff.
high-school students to continue'
on to college, was left off the orig
inal ballot. It will appear for the
first time on the runoff ballot.
Senate Chair Solina Kwan said
she will introduce separate bills at
tonight's ASSU Senate meeting to
put the special-fcc requests of
MEChA and XTV on the runoff
ballot. Both bills require two
thirds approval by the senate, said
Kwan, a junior.
The runoff will be held May 2-3
and will be on a paper ballot, said
elections commissioner Raul
Lopez, a graduate student.
Kwan said she supports a "sec
ond chance" for MEChA and XTV
because of irregularities in the
election procedure and the close
results of their vote.
XTV's budget did not appear in
the election handbook, possibly
hurting its chance of approval,
said station manager Dave Hol
land.
"There were extenuating cir
cumstances because, despite the
fact that we turned in our budget
on time, it was not included in the

election handbook," said Holland,
a senior. "Part of the reason why
the students did not approve us
the first time was our lack of visi
bility, which we will work to
change before the runoff elec
tion."
MEChA co-chair Maria Peters,
a sophomore, said the
Chicano/Latino student group's
special-fee request was hurt by
irregularities in both the election
handbook and The Daily's
endorsement process.
Peters said The Daily's edito
rial board never managed to con
tact members of MEChA to set-up
an endorsement interview, result
ing in a "No Recommendation" in
its list of special-fee endorse
ments.
But according to editor in chief
Janine DeFao, the opinions edi
