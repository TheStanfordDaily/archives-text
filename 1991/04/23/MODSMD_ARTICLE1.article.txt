# Chappies won't be disqualified
## Slate wanted to prevent runoff; fee losers try to get on ballot 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Getting disqualified from an ASSU
election is pretty difficult these days.
Just ask the Hammer and Coffin
Council of Presidents slate, which
tried — and failed — to get itself dis
qualified yesterday to prevent a
runoff.
"Click Here for Fee Refund" COP
slate member Michael Schreiber went
to the elections commission asking to
be disqualified because he and slate

member David Levin are graduating
seniors and should have been declared
ineligible before the election.
Hearings officer Jason Moore, a
junior, ruled that Schreiber and Levin
would have been able to serve as COP
for several weeks before they gradu
ated, making them eligible candidates.
If the Chaparral slate had been dis
qualified, their votes would not have
been counted. Students First would
have had a majority of the votes cast
and would have been declared the out
right winner, eliminating the need for

a runoff.
Schreiber said his action was an
attempt to prevent a runoff that he
feels is being abused by student orga
nizations who lost their special-fee
request in last week's election.
These student groups, which
include XTY MEChA and the ASSU
lobby office, are asking to be placed on
the runoff ballot.
