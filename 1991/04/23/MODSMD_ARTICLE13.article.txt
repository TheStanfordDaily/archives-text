SILOPI, Turkey (AP) — U.S. military forces who
worked yesterday to construct a model camp to
house Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq are being
watched but left alone by Iraqi police in the region,
officials said.
The U.S. soldiers, meanwhile, have received high
marks from relief groups and refugees in Kurdish
camps along the Turkish border.
"We were a bit worried they would take over at
one point," said Constantin Sokoloff, a field officer
for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees. "But they are very cooperative, very will
ing, and they have a lot of logistical support."

Dozens of U.S. troops have arrived the past few
days at the worst-off refugee camps, at Cukurca and
Uzumlu in Turkey. They will be bringing in medicine
and water by helicopter, distributing food and help
ing pipe spring water to the hundreds of thousands
of refugees at the squalid camps.
Two U.S. soldiers were injured in a land mine
explosion at the Uzumlu camp yesterday. The border
had been mined by Turkey and Iraq before the Gulf
war, and several refugees have been killed or maimed
by stepping on mines.
Relief workers said the arrival of the Americans
had reduced tensions among the refugees.

"They see it as a bit of a tangible sign that the
Americans are interested and are going to do some
thing," said Leah Thatcher, a public health specialist
with the New York-based International Rescue Com
mittee.
At Cukurca, a camp crowded with about 185,000
refugees, refugees seemed particularly pleased to see
U.S. Army Special Forces yesterday. A day earlier,
Turkish soldiers had fired at a crowd rioting over
food distribution, killing five and seriously injuring
three, according to medical workers.
Turkish officials said Sunday that one refugee
was killed and five injured.
The United States and allied countries have
promised several safe havens in northern Iraq to
house refugees now massed on the borders of Turkey
and Iran.
Said Hayri Kozakcioglu, governor of Turkey's
southeastern border region where several hundred
thousand Iraqi Kurds have massed: "Now we are
waiting for the Americans to finish setting up the
camp. When it is finished we shall know whether we
have to set up another one."
Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported the gov
ernor met earlier yesterday with U.S. Lt. Gen. John
Shalikashvili, commander of the military relief
effort.
Reporters who visited the camp being set up near
the northern Iraqi border town of Zakho said about
200 tents had been erected since Sunday and that
another 400 were being put up. They noted hun
dreds of Iraqi policemen carrying automatic weapons
and loitering around the camp area and the town.
But Lt. Cmdr. John Hopkins, a military
spokesperson, said the Iraqis had not interfered with
the construction teams.
Hopkins said the settlements in northern Iraq
will eventually house 20 to 25 tent communities of
about 1,000 people each.
Eventually, the broad valley near Zakho that is
under the protection of U.S. and allied forces could
house 100,000 refugees, according to Marine engi
neers who are taking part in the construction.
Local Kurds told U.S. officials that the police in
the region are members of Iraq's secret police, or sol
diers dressing up as police, according to Fred Cuney,
a U.S. State Department consultant helping to estab
lish the camps in northern Iraq.
"They are testing us," said Cuney, adding that
talks were underway between U.S. and Iraqi military
officials about the police. "They'll be out of there
pretty soon," he said.
