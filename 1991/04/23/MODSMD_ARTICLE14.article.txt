# Soviet Premier predicts uprising unless economy improves

MOSCOW (AP) - Prime Min
ister Valentin Pavlov warned yes
terday that a "social explosion"
could occur and millions of people
lose their jobs unless the country
agrees on an emergency program
to halt economic decline.
Pavlov said industrial produc
tion will plummet if debilitating
strikes continue, state contracts
are not met and the government
fails to adopt an economic plan.
Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev told reporters on Red
Square that he expected "serious
proposals" and criticism of the
program at a pivotal Communist
Party Central Committee meeting
tomorrow.
"Comrades have made com

ments like, 'Isn't it too much of a
turn toward liberalization of the
economy, toward capitalization?
And what will the consequences
be?'" he said after laying a wreath
at Vladimir Lenin's mausoleum
on the 121st anniversary of the
Soviet founder's birth.
Making matters worse, more
than 3,000 Siberian gold miners
held a one-day warning strike yes
terday in Magadan and Chukotka,
according to the Tass and Postfac
tum news services.
The gold miners expressed soli
darity with hundreds of thou
sands of striking coal miners, who
stopped work March 1 and are
demanding Gorbachev's resigna
tion and wage indexation to com

pensate for inflation.
Activists in Byelorussia have
called a republic-wide strike
tomorrow because their demand
for a special legislative session has
not been met. Following up on a
crippling strike April 10-11, the
Byelorussians are demanding
Gorbachev step down as well as
higher salaries.
Gorbachev has refused to
resign, instead urging strikers to
put aside personal grudges and
work together.
"Everyone understands it's
dangerous to play now. Now we
must rise above all these political
ambitions and sympathies," he
told reporters. "Now the father
land, state, country and condition

of the people" should be foremost.
There is no organized labor
movement in the Soviet Union
that is coordinating the various
strikes that have hit recently,
although individual strike com
mittees across the country have
made similar political and eco
nomic demands.
Pavlov described the dire state
of the economy in presenting the
latest attempts to cure it."The
situation in the country can only
be characterized as a general cri
sis."
He told the Supreme Soviet leg
islature "the number of unem
ployed may reach 18 million and a
social explosion could erupt before
the year is out" and that indus

trial output will drop 20 percent if
the program is not adopted.
First-quarter figures already
showed the Soviet equivalent of
the gross national product fell 8
percent and labor productivity 9
percent, compared with the same
period a year ago.
But Pavlov warned against a
rapid shift to a free-market sys
tem.
If the country decides to switch
quickly from a centrally planned
to a free-market economy, produc
tion and incomes will fall more
than 30 percent and 30 million
people will lose their jobs, Pavlov
said. He predicted "mass factory
shutdowns, wild price hikes and
the impoverishment of most peo

pie.
The most controversial point in
the plan is the sale of some state
owned businesses to private
groups or individuals. Two-thirds
of small businesses in the service
and consumer sectors would be
denationalized by the end of 1992.
He advised a third, gradual
course, which would include dena
tionalization, promotion of com
mercial credits, improvement of
the tax structure and encourage
ment of foreign investment to
avert collapse.
Many of the 15 Soviet republics
have balked at Gorbachev's eco
nomic reforms, saying they
encroach on their sovereignty and
are half-measures.
