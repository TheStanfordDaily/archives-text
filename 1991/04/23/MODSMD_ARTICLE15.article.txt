# Proposed reforms could change Kuwait, end human rights abuses

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The rulers of Kuwait
told Secretary of State James Baker yesterday they
were working on governmental reforms — including
elections — that he said could mark "a radical trans
forming" of the emirate.
In addition to promising elections next year, the
rulers said they would stop rounding up Palestinians
accused of being sympathetic to Iraq during the Per
sian Gulf war, in which Kuwait was pried from Iraq's
grip by U.S. and allied troops. The Kuwaiti govern
ment has been accused of serious human rights
abuses following its return to power.
Baker, who began his day in Saudi Arabia, flew
from Kuwait to Damascus to resume his drive for
Middle East peace talks with Syrian President Hafez
Assad.
In Jiddah, Baker gained the support of Saudi Ara
bia for a Mideast peace conference although the
Saudis confirmed they would not participate in nego
tiations with Israel.
He also had a 35-minute telephone conversation
with Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmert
nykh. Baker wants Moscow to cosponsor the peace
talks, provided the Soviets resume full diplomatic
relations with Israel after a 24-year lapse.
Baker's scheduled sessions with Assad and For
eign Minister Farouk Sharaa in Damascus loomed as
his most difficult challenge on the Arab side as he
worked to fashion a format and agenda for the
prospective peace talks. He was expected to return to

Israel today.
Kuwait is under martial law and its parliament
was dissolved in 1986. A few hours before Baker flew
there from Saudi Arabia, opponents of the ruling
Sabah family were barred from holding a protest
meeting, and last week Amnesty International said
human rights abuses, including torture and execu
tions, had swept Kuwait since it was liberated.
But Baker got an entirely different account on the
situation in the country, one of the richest in the
world, from the emir, Jabir al-Ahmed Sabah, and the
crown prince, Saad Abdullah al-Sabah.
Baker said the Bush administration would mea
sure its ability to support Kuwait in reconstruction
by its record on human rights.
Asked if he had taken up with Kuwait's rulers
their boycott of firms that do business with Israel,
Baker ended the airborne news conference.
"I'm not going to comment on that," he said.
In Kuwait, Baker got a close look at a legacy of the
Gulf war — more Jhan 500 burning oil wells that are
being subdued at a rate of about 20 a week.
Visiting near dusk, as the flames reached for the
skies, Baker stopped at the Ahmadi field's well No.
57, which a "Red" Adair firefighting crew from
Texas expects to have under control in a day or two.
Wearing a Texas Longhorns golf shirt and baggy
chino slacks, Baker watched the crew make prepara
tions to try to shear off the shattered wellhead with
explosives.
