# White House promises full accounting of Sununu's military-jet trips

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House yesterday promised
a full accounting of Chief of Staff
John Sununu's travels as it
sought to stem the political fallout
over his extensive personal use of
military jets.
Spokesperson Marlin Fitzwa
ter said President Bush discussed
the issue with Sununu yesterday
shortly after the chief of staff
returned — on an Air Force jet —
from a weekend in New Hamp
shire.
But "There's no evidence that
there's any ethical impropriety

here," said Fitzwater. He said data
consisting of "long lists and num
bers" would affirm that judgment.
Fitzwater said the records, to
be released within the next few
days, would back Sununu's con
tentions that he had reimbursed
the government for personal trips
aboard military planes.
Congressional Democrats have
seized on the issue and accused
Sununu, whose brash manners
have never won him many friends
on Capitol Hill, of misusing tax
dollars.
"It's probably legal. It may be

technically ethical. But most cer
tainly it is excessive," said Rep.
Bob Wise, I)-W.Va., chairman of
the House Government Opera
tions subcommittee on govern
ment information, justice and
agriculture.
Wise welcomed the White
House announcement that it
would open up its books. But, he
said, "that handles one question.
The other is whether Air Sununu
should be flying on the scale it
does.
"When John Sununu isn't
breaking up negotiations on the

civil rights bill, apparently he's
flying out to Vail to ski at the tax
payer's expense," said Rep. Vic
Fazio, D-Calif, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Cam
paign Committee.
The latest furor surrounding
the chief of staff arose with news
accounts over the weekend that
Sununu had taken more than 60
trips on Air Force jets — including
skiing vacations and visits to his
home state of New Hampshire.
"The president supports that
policy" that enabled Sununu to fly
aboard military planes even when

on private business, Fitzwater
said. "There should be no ques
tion about that."
At issue is a 1987 directive
signed by then-President Ronald
Reagan authorizing the White
House chief of staff and the
national security adviser to fly
aboard military jets at all times.
Former Senate Republican Leader
Howard Baker of Tennessee was
chief of staff at the time.
Administration officials say the
policy is intended to make sure
the top presidential aides are
never out of touch.

However, the memorandum
was not publicized by the White
House until now.
Fitzwater said Bush had
decided to make public all perti
nent travel documents for both
Sununu and national security
adviser Rrent Scowcroft. "I asked
the president this morning. He
said, 'release it all,'" Fitzwater
said.
The spokesperson insisted that
Sununu had reimbursed the gov
ernment for all personal trips
aboard official aircraft, following
well-established policy guidelines
