## Lecturer under fire 
### 
Controversial stance
forces University to
confront hypocrisy

IN A DARING AND controver
sial move, Computer Science
Lecturer Stuart Reges has sent
a letter to the federal Office of
National Drug Control Policy
detailing his flagrant disregard for
federal and University rules on
drugs and alcohol.
Reges' own fate is not difficult to
predict: With the government
watching over its shoulder, the
University will probably be forced
to fire him. Civil disobedience
always carries great risks, and
Reges is clearly willing to sacrifice
his job to make his statement. His
actions show great courage, and
also force Stanford students and
administrators to consider a num
ber of difficult questions.
The first question is the old
issue of free speech, with a disturb
ing new twist. Reges is certainly
not the only person on campus to
routinely break the University's
policy on drugs and alcohol, yet he
is likely to be the only one pun
ished because he is the only one
who openly admits his transgres
sions.
Particularly ominous is that the
University administration consid
ers a personal conversation
between Reges and a student to be
"conduct" rather than speech sim
ply because during the conversa
tion, Reges advised a student to
break University drug policy.
By this logic, a faculty member
who is asked a personal question
by a student is required to sup
press his or her honest opinion and
dutifully recite standard Univer
sity doctrine. This disastrous inter
pretation of "conduct" will
severely damage student/faculty

relationships, and create an unac
ceptable chilling effect.
But the larger issue that Reges
brings up is the hypocrisy of the
University's policy on drugs and
alcohol. The University adminis
tration knew of Reges' illegal
actions months ago, yet it did noth
ing substantial until Reges forced
its hand by notifying the federal
government. The obvious reason
for the delay is that the University
administration claims to adhere to
the strict federal regulations on
drugs and alcohol but does not
agree with them in principle nor
enforce them in practice.
Certainly this hypocrisy was
well known before the Reges
episode began. But Reges' actions
forced students and administrators
to think hard about its ramifica
tions.
Many professors sponsor wine
and cheese receptions for their stu
dents, or invite their advisees to a
dinner where wine is served, and
pay for these functions with Uni
versity funds. And a majority of
Stanford undergraduates break
the federally mandated University
alcohol policy on a regular basis.
If one of these students were to
follow Reges' example and describe
his or her infractions to the federal
government, it is conceivable that
the government could force Stan
ford to suspend or even expel the
student.
Since the vast majority of the
University's administrators, fac
ulty and students appear to dis
agree with the new federal policy,
Reges believes that the just
response is not to blatantly lie
about adherence, but instead to
stand up to the government and
openly fight.
Just like Reges, the University
must be willing to risk quite a bit to
stand up for a principle it believes
in. But Reges is demonstrating
that the cost of continuing the
hypocrisy might be equally high.
