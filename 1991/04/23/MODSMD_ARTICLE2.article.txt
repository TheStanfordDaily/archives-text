# Federal indirect-cost overhaul on horizon
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Prompted by "abuses" at Stanford and
other research universities, Office of Man
agement and Budget Director Richard Dar
man announced yesterday that his office
was considering broad reforms of federal
rules on indirect-cost recovery.
In the first of what is expected to be a
series of reform proposals, Darman offered
a laundry list of expense categories that he
feels should be explicitly identified as unal

Indirect costs are those University
expenses necessary for conducting research
but not attributable to an individual
research project.
The list of forbidden charges announced
by Darman includes entertainment costs,
country-club memberships, promotional
advertising and expenses related to housing
of university administrators. Federal inves
tigators have recently uncovered such

charges in the indirect-cost claims of Stan
ford, Caltech, Harvard Medical School and
other research universities.
"Recent information shows abuses in
reimbursements claimed by universities for
indirect costs supporting government
funded research," Darman said. "These
require additional guidelines to clarify pol
icy and stop the abuse."
Darman also noted that his office was
considering more comprehensive reforms,
including possible changes affecting how
much universities are allowed to charge for
administrative, facilities and equipment
expenses â€” some of the most costly compo
nents of indirect-cost recovery.
University President Donald Kennedy
responded positively to Darman's initiative.
"We applaud this effort to accomplish a cen
tral government policy for the support of
University research," he said in a prepared
statement.
Darman's announcement was appar
ently timed to coincide with a new round of
