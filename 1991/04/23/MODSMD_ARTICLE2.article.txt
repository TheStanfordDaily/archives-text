# Federal indirect-cost overhaul on horizon
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Prompted by "abuses" at Stanford and
other research universities, Office of Man
agement and Budget Director Richard Dar
man announced yesterday that his office
was considering broad reforms of federal
rules on indirect-cost recovery.
In the first of what is expected to be a
series of reform proposals, Darman offered
a laundry list of expense categories that he
feels should be explicitly identified as unal
lowable in Circular A-21, the rules that gov
ern how universities charge the govern
ment for indirect costs of research.
Indirect costs are those University
expenses necessary for conducting research
but not attributable to an individual
research project.
The list of forbidden charges announced
by Darman includes entertainment costs,
country-club memberships, promotional
advertising and expenses related to housing
of university administrators. Federal inves
tigators have recently uncovered such

charges in the indirect-cost claims of Stan
ford, Caltech, Harvard Medical School and
other research universities.
"Recent information shows abuses in
reimbursements claimed by universities for
indirect costs supporting government
funded research," Darman said. "These
require additional guidelines to clarify pol
icy and stop the abuse."
Darman also noted that his office was
considering more comprehensive reforms,
including possible changes affecting how
much universities are allowed to charge for
administrative, facilities and equipment
expenses — some of the most costly compo
nents of indirect-cost recovery.
University President Donald Kennedy
responded positively to Darman's initiative.
"We applaud this effort to accomplish a cen
tral government policy for the support of
University research," he said in a prepared
statement.
Darman's announcement was appar
ently timed to coincide with a new round of
congressional hearings on federal
indirect-cost policy. The House
Subcommittee on Science will
hold hearings today and Thurs
day to examine rising overhead
rates at research universities
nationwide.
Darman was tentatively sched
uled to testify today, but has can
celed due to a scheduling conflict.
Unlike the Energy and Com
merce Committee's Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, which held a fact-finding
hearing on Stanford's policies last

month, the Science Subcommit
tee is legislative in nature.
In the past, Kennedy has said
new indirect-cost legislation
would likely restrict universities'
cost recovery. In a tight federal
budget climate, such cuts are
"politically irresistible," he told
the ASSU Senate last week.
According to a statement
released by the subcommittee, the
purpose of its indirect-cost hear
ings is "to examine the problem,
to determine its causes and to
develop a basis for recommending
legislative and administrative
changes in how indirect-cost rates
are determined, what costs are
allowable, what level of account

ability should be required of uni
versities and what level of federal
oversight is necessary."
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, said
he expects the hearing to be
"quite broad, quite general and
quite interesting."
Horton said he was not sure if
the subcommittee would produce
new legislation. Instead, he said,
the subcommittee may determine
that necessary policy changes
may be best accomplished by
executive actions such as those
announced yesterday by Darman.
Horton is currently in Wash
ington and will attend the hear
ings.

No Stanford representatives
will testify, however.
Panelists expected to testify
include:
• David Packard, former presi
dent of Stanford's Board of
Trustees and chair of the board of
Hewlett-Packard. Packard
chaired a 1986 White House Sci
ence Council panel that made sev
eral recommendations for indi
rect-cost reform. Recently, he has
been critical of some of Stanford's
controversial indirect-cost
charges.
• Cornelius Pings, USC
provost and author of a 1988
Association of American Univer
sities report on indirect-cost

recovery.
• Rear Adm. William Miller,
the chief of naval research, and
Fred Newton, deputy director of
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency.
Both Miller and Newton testi
fied at last month's Stanford
hearing.
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stan
ford, is a member of the Science
Subcommittee. But Campbell, a
Stanford law professor, is
expected to keep a low profile on
the indirect-cost issue, according
to his press secretary, Greg Stohr.
"He's always felt this is some
thing that it's best he stay out of,"
Stohr said.
