Reges should be judged for teaching, not personal life

I AM WRITING TO RESPOND TO
the recent events surrounding Stuart
Reges' suspension from the Univer
sity. This is the second quarter in which
I have had Reges as a lecturer, and it is
not exaggeration to say that he is not
only the finest teacher I have had at
Stanford, but also the finest I have ever
had.
That the government should have any
say in his status as an educator, based on
criteria that have nothing to do with his
quality of teaching, is a gross misappro
priation of their power. Likewise, the
University is mistaken to let the govern
ment decide who can and who cannot
teach here; it should view the private
lives of both faculty and students alike to
be outside of its jurisdiction.
I know that many other students will
agree with me when I say that Reges is a
teacher of the highest order. His dedica
tion to his students, his material and his
own performance is evident in every lec
ture he gives. He has the rare ability to
make new and difficult subject material
incredibly easy to understand; his
explanatory style is so lucid and thor
ough that it is hardly ever necessary for
him to repeat anything. He has a finely

tuned sense of what steps the student
needs to go through to understand the
material.
Lectures are never boring — the prob
lems Reges poses to the students never
fail to provoke curiosity and demonstrate
the most fascinating aspects of the mate
rial he is covering. All in all, there is lit
tle room for him to improve his teaching;
if drugs did in some way affect his ability
to teach in a negative way, I couldn't
imagine how he could do better.
What Bob Martinez is proposing is
that Reges be fired, solely on the basis of
two letters he wrote to The Stanford
Daily last Nov. 8 and 9 in response to the
Stanford alcohol policy.
What Reges said in the letters was
certainly designed to be provocative, as
well as what he said in his letters to Mar
tinez and other members of the govern
ment, but his point has lost none of its
logic: He opposes the inherent hypocrisy
of Stanford's position on the new drug
and alcohol policy, and the government's
increasing presence in our private lives.
A person'B private life, as long as it does
nothing to interfere with others', is a
sphere that should remain wholly for
eign to the laws of the government. His

personal use of drugs, he claims, has
never infringed on his teaching ability,
nor has he ever given lectures or held
office hours while under the influence.
Given this to be true, there is abso
lutely no reason to either suspend or fire
Reges — his obligations to the Univer
sity as a lecturer have been entirely ful
filled. Whether he is to be prosecuted or
not is a matter only between him and the
government, not between him and the
University.
Regarding the advice he gave a stu
dent on drug use, it was a conversation
that took place in an entirely private set
ting. It was a conversation between two
people, not between a teacher and a stu
dent. It was conducted outside of the
office and the classroom, and is protected
under freedom of speech. Also, it was a
recommendation made on not unguarded
terms — pro and con were discussed at
length and an intelligent conclusion was
drawn based on the facts. Martinez' pro
pagandist arguments are only part of the
drug war hysteria that continues to
block intelligent, two-sided debate on the
issue and instills fear into people's lives.
Why didn't the University investigate
as soon as the articles were published?

Why is it that these events occurred only
after Martinez prodded the University to
take this action? Will the University
admit that it really doesn't want to fire
Reges, or will it knuckle under to the
government's demands (as it did with
the new alcohol policy)?
Is it that they have a real concern
over his ability to teach, or only because
his job is pitted against millions of dol
lars of funding?
There is something wrong vvith this
picture. It seems that the government,
by controlling Stanford's financial life
line, is also forcing the University to give
in to its demands on the way education
is practiced.
They've got us by the balls, and we
are powerless against this form of extor
tion.
I may be too idealistic to think that it
is wrong to compromise the quality of
undergraduate education at Stanford
over a matter of money, but I just want
to make it known that I would consider
it a great loss to the University if Reges
was removed from the faculty.
