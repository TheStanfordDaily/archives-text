# Criticizing families of soldiers shows academic snobbery

I DID NOT SEE THE ABC NEWS
report about the spouses of U.S. sol
diers who served in the Persian Gulf
that so irritated Tuesday's columnist
Maurits van der Veen. I am, however,
thankful that van der Veen has such
flawless moral character that he could
take it upon himself to point out the fool
ish spouses who lost a sense of solidarity
once their loved ones were safe.
To me, van der Veen's column repre
sented the supreme arrogance that

seems to grow from academic ivory tow
ers. Here he is, a snot-nosed college stu
dent, living in the lap of luxury, telling
men and women — who probably never
had the benefit of ultimate enlighten
ment that Stanford provides — that
their deep personal grief and sense of
community that grew out of their shared
hardship was foolish and misplaced.
Certainly were these spouses as per
fect as van der Veen must be to cast such
stones, they would still be grieving for all
the evils in this world. But right now I

imagine that they are spending most of
their time acting like real live human
beings, basking in the joy of their
reunions with those service members.
Idealism isn't inherently arrogant,
and I think it is the role of academic
communities to critique our society and
hold up lofty, even unattainable, goals
for us all. But to do so while attacking
the perfectly human behavior of these
spouses is ultimate snobbery.
Funny thing is, I agree with van der

Veen on one general point: The war was
too comfortable for our society.
But to attack the only people that
experienced real hardship on the home
front — the spouses of the service mem
bers — is absolutely ludicrous. Van der
Veen would do better to turn his pen
against the decadence in our own com
munity to which the indirect-cost inci
dents attest.
