## Copping out by pointing fingers 
### 
Last week's assu elections
were the first I have witnessed at
Stanford. What struck me most was
how acrimonious some of the debate was,
and how serious some of the candidates
were about relatively inconsequential
matters. For example, several students
commented that the ordering of the can
didates in the election software was obvi
ously biased towards the opposing party
(whichever that was).
In fact, at the request of the ASSU
Senate, each individual electronic ballot
was equipped with a randomization
option, to avoid having the same candi
dates consistently listed first. Thus, the
order in which candidates were listed
often varied from one machine to the
next, and those who complained were
attributing bias to random chance.
Seeing malicious intent behind every
unwelcome situation or action occurs
very frequently. It is curious how often
representatives of both the right and the
left are convinced that the University
administration is engaged in a concerted
effort to thwart their agendas.
The Stanford Review regales us each
week with articles whining about the per
ceived University thought police (i.e.,
anyone who disagrees with them in pub
lic), and about how difficult it is for a con
servative to survive here. Yet I meet quite
a few conservatives who don't show signs
of persecution. Nor is there any consis
tent, centralized attempt to silence the
Review (which, after all, gets funding
from the Publications Board).
By taking the attitude that they are
being victimized, Review writers can
blame their lack of involvement or con

structive criticism on the monolithic
administration and its purported political
bias, and avoid examining their own pos
sible shortcomings.
Political activists often are just as
guilty of such behavior, however. Many
universities today are engaged in cam
paigns to attract quality minority and
female faculty. Clearly, this is long over
due, and special efforts are necessary to
redress existing imbalances. More than a
few campus activists, however, view a
dearth of new employments as evidence
of ill will on the part of the university
administration, accepting only actual hir
ings as evidence that a real effort is being
made.
Unfortunately, the number of qualified
minority or female candidates is small to
begin with, and most are actively
recruited by several schools. Accusing the
university, as many activists do, of not
making enough of an effort when a candi
date chooses another school is not giving
much credit to that candidate's intelli
gence and ability to make personal
choices.
Finally, on a more personal note, I
have been taken to task over the column 1
wrote two weeks ago criticizing the poli
cies of the Israeli government. Many
blamed me for being blindly anti-Israel,
or, giving me the benefit of the doubt,
assumed 1 had not sufficiently studied
"the other side of the issue." Yet all I
argued was that Israeli government poli
cies are exacerbating the conflict and go
beyond what people concerned about
human rights and dignity should be will
ing to countenance, and nobody has yet
denied that "side of the issue."

In fact, many more examples could be
cited that indict the Israeli government
(just as many instances exist showing the
error of some Palestinian groups). Those
who deny that such facts are relevant or
blame me for raising them are the ones
who really should open their eyes to real
ity.
Clearly it is easier to accuse those who
do have different views of malice or intel
lectual dishonesty than to seriously con
sider the issues involved. Such accusa
tions represent taking the easy way out
intellectually.
It is always tempting to ignore unwel
come or uncomfortable facts and situa
tions, and I think most of us do so at
times. But it is never productive, and it
becomes pernicious when, as a form of
closing our eyes to reality, we start blam
ing our opponent.
If more people were a bit less eager to
say "tua culpa," there would be a lot less
acrimony in this world, and probably less
conflict as well.

Maurits van der Veen is sure that the
high cost of living in the Hay Area is a
sinister plot by the credit card companies
to drive him into debt. His column
appears every Tuesday.
