## Card puts it all together for two wins over Arizona 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
It only took four days, but the real Stan
ford baseball team finally showed up at
Sunken Diamond. In a fit of schizophrenia,
the Cardinal dropped the cloak of medi
ocrity it had worn over the weekend and
emerged yesterday with a look of domina
tion that braught home a double-header
victory over the visiting Arizona Wildcats.
Stanford harkened its fans back to last
year's College World Series team that used
dominating pitching and timley hitting to
have its way with opponents as they used
two complete-game efforts and five home
runs to beat the Wildcats 2-1 in the opener
and 6-1 in the nightcap.
After the sloppy, error-prone play in the
sweep by UCLA that the weekend pro
duced, Stanford's return to form is hard to
grasp, but the smiles of the Cardinal play
ers showed they would not mind spending
some time pondering the two-game effort.
"Everybody is really happy; we can't
beleive it," David McCarty said. "I said
(after Sunday's loss) that today would be a
turning point, and I think that we made a
really positive step here."
It still might take a minor miracle to
catch first-place USC in the race for the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
title, but if the Cardinal keeps playing like
it did yesterday, anything is possible.
McCarty was the only payer to shine during
the UCLA series with three homers in three
days, but his star got even brighter yester
day when he repeated the feat in one fewer
contest.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess had said
earlier in the season that McCarty was hit
ting well, but had yet to hit a streak. Well, if
the Texas native gets any hotter, Sunken

Diamond could see its first case of sponta
neous combustion. McCarty's 18th, 19th,
and 20th home runs increased his Six-Pac
lead in that category, and his six round-trip
pers in the past four days have increased
the junior's slugging percentage to .886.
For those who can not translate, this means
that McCarty gets a base practically every
time he steps up to the plate.
"I'm finally in a hot streak; right now
the ball looks like a beachball coming in
there," McCarty said. "The important
thing now is that I'm not swinging at bad
pitches. When you are in a groove, you wait
till the right one comes along."
In game one he did not have to wait long,
taking a fastball down the middle over the
centerfield fence in his first at-bat to give
Stanford a 1-0 lead. Roger Burnett copied
this solo effort in the next frame and it was
all the offensive the Cardinal would need.
The game was essentially a pitchers'
dual between starters Jason Hisey and
Willie Adams. Both pitchers came away
with complete games and the two long balls
were the only blot on Hisey's otherwise fine
four-hit, 10-strikeout losing effort.
"Hisey really pitched well,'' McCarty
said. "He only made two mistakes the
whole game — one to me and one to Roger. "
Adams avoided the long ball and came
away with his third complete game of the
season. The gangly freshman allowed five
hits on the day while striking out nine to
raise his record to 6-2. His only tough spot

Stanford shortstop Roger Burnett turns a double play during yesterday's doubleheader as San Jose native Billy Owens
gets punched out by the second-base umpire. Stanford's defense, highly suspect over the weekend, was perfect yester
day to back a pair of five-hitters by Willie Adams and Aaron Dorlarque.
