# A
						tale of two Evanses, and two different perceptions
## 
### 
A pair of Evans — one from Stanford,
one from Toledo — has been in the
sports news in the past few weeks.
One has been portrayed as an innocent
victim of NCAA rules; the other as a ruth
less manipulator who went to college only
to play sports.
Their names are Janet and Jerry.
One's a darling; one's supposedly a sym
bol of all that's wrong with college athlet
ics.
Make up your own mind which is
which.
Ms. Stanford. You've all heard about
this one, of course. Two weeks ago, Janet
Evans announced that she would not be
coming back to school next year in order
to train for the Olympics.
The reason? Evans blamed the NCAA
and its "20-hours-a-week" rule, which
she said would restrict her training time.
"I think the NCAA is going to have to get
its act together," she said. Texas swim
ming coach Mark Schubert piped in with
"Isn't it sad that someone who is as excel
lent a student as Janet Evans has to quit
college to pursue her dream? I think it
borders on criminal."
Actually, Mark, it doesn't, but what
you and Evans both said about the situa
tion borders on lying. And, at the very
least, what you've said is so laden with
guano that it's starting to smell.
Before anyone gets annoyed over what
I'm saying about Evans, let's get two
things straight:
(I)The 20-hours-per-week rule does
not, not, not (repeat, not) affect swimmers.
The rule has a huge loophole: Training
over the 20-hour limit is allowed on a vol
untary basis, and — for sports such as
swimming, water polo and gymnastics
that have a "danger" factor — coaches are
allowed to be present during the extra
training.
Yes, I know the "danger" factor sounds

kinda silly — How often do college swim
mers drown, anyway? — but it serves its
purpose: Olympic athletes can, if they so
desire, stay in school and train as much as
they want.
Evans could stay here and swim 24
hours a day and not violate any rules, and
she knows it. The NCAA rule is a conve
nient excuse for her leaving — everyone
who doesn't understand the rule swal
lows the argument, blames the NCAA
and thinks Evans is an innocent victim.
Come on.
So why is she leaving? That brings us
to our second point:
(2)Janet Evans came to Stanford, first,
foremost, and above all else, to swim.
Period. Her primary goal was to get bet
ter. That hasn't happened. Bye.
Yes, of course she loves a lot more
about Stanford than just swimming. And,
yes, she says she'll come back to get her
degree. However, none of those other
attractions are strong enough to keep her
here when swimming isn't going as well
as she'd like.
If this isn't true, then could someone
please tell me why Evans isn't at school
right now? The 20-hour rule hasn't gone
into effect yet, but Evans has already left
school and gone to Texas to train with
Schubert.
By the way, in case you don't want to
believe that Evans wasn't telling the
truth about why she's leaving, feel free to

check out the L.A. Times sports section
from last Saturday. From the top of page
two: "Although it was widely reported
that she was leaving school because of
stringent new NCAA regulations on prac
tice time, the coaching change appears to
have been the main reason."
The rest of the article shows how
Evans' 1991 times have been worse than
her 1990 times. It also quotes her com
plaining about Stanford coach Richard
Quick's handling of her training. Draw
your own conclusions.
I don't have any problem with what
she's doing, because it's not really any of
my (or anyone else's) business. My only
complaint is that Evans chose the NCAA
to play scapegoat when her real reasons
for leaving were that she was unhappy
with her swimming development.
I'm all for ripping on the NCAA, but
not when it's done just to hide something
about yourself that people probably won't
like.
Even if she wasn't (and, possibly, still
isn't) entirely honest about her rea
sons for leaving, no one is going to
say that Evans made a stupid decision.
She wants to do well in the Olympics and,
since that's a "noble" cause, no one is
going to get upset that she dropped out of
school to do it.
Why, then, is it wrong for an NFL
bound football player to do the same?
Mr. Toledo. Jerry Evans (no relation)
is a tight end who was featured in last
week's Sports Illustrated as the personifi
cation of the non-student/athlete. After
five years, he carries a 2.3 GPA at Toledo
and will still be one quarter short of a
degree after this spring.
Why is he in college? "To play foot
ball," he says. Fair enough. During winter
quarter, Jerry took one four-unit inde
pendent study class which required him

I'm all for ripping on the
NCAA, but not when its
done just to hide some
thing about yourself that
people probably won't
like.

to read a 272-page textbook called Geog
raphy of Soils. He got an incomplete.
How did he spend his time, then, if he
wasn't doing any work? He was busy find
ing an agent, getting into shape for post
season all-star games, staying in shape
for the scouting combines. Preparing
himself for his career.
The article follows Jerry through his
winter-quarter travels, all the while duly
noting that he wasn't paying much atten
tion to Geography of Soils. The point was
clear: A fake student-athlete had finally
turned into just an athlete. How terrible.
Before you all start feeling superior,
put yourself in Jerry's shoes. If your only
shot at doing the one thing you loved —
and getting paid a lot for it — rested on
how you performed over a period of a few
months, would you waste a single minute
of that time reading Geography of Soils?
Would you give a flying you-know-what
about schoolwork?
Not a chance in hell. And you know it.
There's a clear double-standard at
work here: A collegiate athlete who blows
off his schoolwork to concentrate on his
chosen career is acting like an idiot; a col
legiate dancer, or a musician, or an actor,
or a broadcaster, or a writer who does the
same is applauded for working toward a
career goal.
And even within athletes, there's
another double-standard: No one sees

anything wrong with Janet Evans (1) pos
sibly not doing as well in school in order
to spend massive amounts of time swim
ming, and (2) taking a year off from
school to train. But when Jerry Evans (1)
lets his grades suffer because of football,
and (2) blows off a geography course in
order to prepare for his chosen career,
he's singled out as being a symptom of a
widespread disease.
"The truth is, I came to college for one
reason, to become eligible to play foot
ball," Jerry says. We read this and think
about how horrible it is. Rut ask yourself
this:
Suppose Richard Quick (or Mark
Schubert, or another fantastic coach) had
been in charge of a club team instead of a
college program and, after the 1988
Olympics, told Janet Evans that she
would become a better swimmer in his
program than she would at college.
Does Janet go to school?
Oh, it's different because Jerry has
less of a chance of reaching his goal? That
might make sense — Jerry wasn't picked
until the eighth round of the NFL draft
yesterday — except there's no guarantee
that Janet's year off will pay off the way
she wants, either.
In the final analysis, both Janet and
Jerry are putting sports ahead of school.
Roth Janet and Jerry are taking risks. Is
putting school aside for football somehow
less noble than putting school aside for
swimming?
Roth Janet and Jerry are doing what
they love. If you cheer for one, you should
cheer for the other — and if you don't,
perhaps you should ask yourself how you
would act differently.

one ever asks Poli Sci Prof. John Manley
to resign.
