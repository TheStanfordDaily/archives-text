# Golfers in third at Pac-10s
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The first day of a tournament
is frequently not a great one for
the Cardinal women's golf team.
"We usually don't come out of
the blocks on the first day," said
coach Tim Baldwin.
But the Cardinal put a twist to
their norm yesterday in the open
ing day of the three-day Pacific 10
Conference Championships at the
Eugene Country Club in Eugene,
Oreg. stroking their way to a
strong third-place showing.
Hitting 306 on the day, Stan
ford trails second-ranked Arizona,
by only four strokes, and third
ranked UCLA, by only six. Ari
zona State trails the Cardinal by
two strokes at 308. And the fourth
Cardinal score in the count-four
scores format was an errant day
by Stephanie Davis' standards.
The Cardinal's top three
golfers — Adele Moore, Jodi
Figley and Audrey Wooding —
had a banner first day as the trio
combined for a 222.
Figley, the senior and heart of
the team, shot a 73 to finish the
day at plus-l.
"Jodi played great golf," said
Baldwin. "She made some good
birdies and she scrambled well. To
shoot a 73 on this course a whole
lot of things have to go right and
she did them."

Figley also finished in a tie for
second individually with Ari
zona's Mette Hageman and
UCLA's Lisa Kiggens, three
strokes behind overall leader
Annika Sorenstam of Arizona.
Sorenstam, a native of Sweden, is
the top-ranked amateur in
Europe.
"Sorenstam just played an awe
some round of golf," said Baldwin.
Moore, a junior who is ranked
18th in the nation, rebounded
from a below-average perfor
mance at the Lady Sun Devil
Tournament a week and a half ago
with a 74 yesterday.
"I went home last weekend to
concentrate on my game and to
get away from school," said
Moore.
Her fresh approach to her
game put her in a tie for fifth with
the Bruins' Debbie Koyama.
"Adele played with a lot of con
fidence today, and she trusted her
instincts," said Baldwin.
"I love the course because it's a
classic," Moore said. "It's narrow,
has lots of greens, and the length
is about average. It's challenging
because it forgives you and then
hits you."
The 20th-ranked Wooding
made a homecoming — kind of.
Playing in Eugene, Ore., near her
native Washington, Wooding
drilled a 75 and found herself in
sole possession of seventh after

one day of action.
The hitch came after the top
three. Davis, the No. 4 player for
the Cardinal, had a rough day
away from the Farm as she shot
an 84.
"She didn't hit the ball well,
she didn't putt well, she didn't do
anything well today," said Bald
win.
In addition, Stanford did not
receive a surprise performance
from junior Martha Richards like
it had in the final day of the Lady
Sun Devil Invitational when she
hit a 75.
Still adjusting to golf after a
prolonged basketball season,
Richards shot an 87.
"I have to make my putts," said
Richards. "I'm hitting the ball on
the green way too often and I
missed a lot of five- to six-foot
putts. Tomorrow my lag putting
will have to be better."
Baldwin said that the course is
not perfectly suited for Richards'
game, especially after such a long
absence from golf.
"This golf course is very nar
row," he said. "It's all tree-lined.
Martha is a long hitter, but she is
a little on the errant side, and her
game is still a little rough."
It is titillating to think what
the Cardinal can do today and
tomorrow if it plays up to its
potential.
