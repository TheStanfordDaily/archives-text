# Campus reacts strongly to suspension of Reges
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The University's decision Friday to place
Computer Science Senior Lecturer Stuart
Reges on administrative leave has created a
storm of protest among some of his stu
dents and colleagues.
Reges was placed on leave while the L'ni
versity investigates his claims that he
openly violates the University's drug and
alcohol policy to protest U.S. drug policy.
The investigation began yesterday.
The move came after University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy received a warning
from national Drug Czar Bob Martinez.
Kennedy said yesterday that he had no

comment on the situation.
The story has also been
noticed around the coun
try. It has been covered by
The New York Times, the
Los Angeles Times, The
Washington Post, USA
Today and NBC News.
Channel 2 ran a segment
about Reges last night on
the 10 p.m. newscast.

Campus response has been varied and
strong. Administrators in the Computer
Science Department have demanded that
Reges be allowed to teach his class while


Reges
under investigation. Various peti
tions in support of Reges have
been circulated, and almost a
dozen dormitories have invited
Reges to speak.
Government response has also
been powerful. The Washington
Post quoted an aide to Martinez
on Sunday as saying, "My impres
sion is that this hasn't exactly
been a secret at Stanford. This
guy has been shouting about his
involvement with drugs for six
months or more."
He added, "It's too bad that it
takes a half-year and a letter from
a White House official to remind
university administrators of their
legal responsibilities."
But Prof. Jeffrey Ullman,
Computer Science Department
chair, called the administrative
leave "an unwarranted action"
which is causing "unnecessary
chaos." Ullman taught Reges'
class, Computer Science 1098,
last quarter and will be giving lec
tures during Reges' leave, assisted

by notes from Reges.
Ullman said he has protested
to the School of Engineering, to
which the department belongs.
Assoc. Computer Science Prof.
Eric Roberts said, "There is an
emerging consensus [in the
department] that is angry Stuart
is being treated in this way." He
said Ken Down, associate dean for
administration in the School of
Engineering, violated procedure
by not consulting the department
before placing Reges on leave.
"Everyone in the Computer
Science Department heard by
reading the papers," Roberts said.
Down defended his decision not
to include the department in the
decision, saying, "This was a
dean's-ofTice-level decision to be
made." Down said that after
discussing the situation with the
University's Legal Office after 2
p.m. Friday, he informed Reges
and George Wheaton, the associ
ate department chair, that Reges
could not teach class during the
investigation.
Some students in the class
expressed dismay or booed and
hissed when told at the beginning
of class yesterday that Reges had

been placed on leave. Sophomore
David Manley said, "He's the best
professor I've had here," adding
that he thinks Reges is being bul
lied by the government.
"It seems like a back-handed
method, but I guess that [the Uni
versity's] right," he said.
Various petitions in support of
Reges are circulating around cam
pus. Senior Steve Swenson dis
tributed two in Reges' class yes
terday which call for Reges' rein
statement during the investiga
tion.
Freshman Greg Scown gath
ered 54 signatures on his peti
tions, which were distributed yes
terday during the Computer Sci
ence 107 class. Scown said that
tomorrow he will take the peti
tions to Kennedy, the Computer
Science Department and the
Engineering School.
Scown placed a copy of the peti
tion on an electronic bulletin
board known as "su.etc." He said
subscribers to the board have
been discussing the situation.
An anonymous flyer was
posted on a bulletin board outside
Tresidder AlRport yesterday and
Sunday which read, "Stop totali

tarian government. Defend free
dom of speech. Keep Stuart
Reges, the best teacher on cam
pus."
Swenson said, "If Stuart gets
fired, I will no longer attend this
university."
Other students have expressed
interest in the situation. Reges —
who in yesterday's letter to The
Daily invited dorms to discuss the
situation with him — said every
evening during the next two
weeks has been tentatively
booked by dorm discussions. Sun
day night he spoke to 60 people in
Cedro for almost four hours.
Chris Jones, a teaching assis
tant for Reges' class, said stu
dents' education "has been placed
on the back burner."
"I believe the University would
not have done this without the
letter from Bob Martinez. Now, it
feels it has to," he said. "That's
not the way the University should
be run."
Graduate student Andy Anag
nost, who took Reges' Computer
Science 106 X last quarter, said "I
totally don't agree with his opin
ions on drugs," but he defended
Reges' right to free speech.

Students in Reges' Computer
Science 106 X section — whom he
took to dinner last quarter after
they won a contest — were sur
prised that the University was
angry he had allowed a couple of
underage students to order alco
hol along with students of legal
drinking age.
Anagnost, who attended the
dinner, said that he thought there
was "absolutely no impropriety
whatsoever" and that Reges "just
looked the other way" while the
other students ordered the
drinks. "I don't think it was seri
ous," he said.
"I'm surprised it's such a big
deal," said freshman Alice Cheng,
who was also at the dinner.
"fßeges] didn't say 'Order a
drink.' Even the waiter didn't
ask." Cheng said she thought the
restaurant should have enforced
its own rules.
The last University faculty or
staff member to be involved in a
drug-related controversy was act
ing Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin. In her home on
June 24 she inhaled a vial of nine

year-old cocaine she found in a
closet.
Immediately afterward her
body reacted violently to the drug
and she was taken to Stanford
Hospital, where she was arrested
for being under the influence of
cocaine. She was convicted of a
misdemeanor — which was
dropped after the completion of a
drug diversion program — but
was never placed on any form of
leave.
Norm Robinson, in a July 25
statement, said that Conklin had
established an enviable record of
exceptional service to Stanford.
He told The Stanford Weekly that
job performance is what really
matters and "what people do with
their private lives is their own
business."
Comparing Conklin's case with
Reges', Robinson said he could
not see what the two had in com
mon. He said what Conklin did
was "on her own time, alone, off
campus and wholly private."
Robinson also said Reges' actions
appear to be a violation of Univer
sity policy, while Conklin did not
violate Stanford policy.
