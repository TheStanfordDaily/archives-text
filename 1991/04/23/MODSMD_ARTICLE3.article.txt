### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The University's decision Friday to place
Computer Science Senior Lecturer Stuart
Reges on administrative leave has created a
storm of protest among some of his stu
dents and colleagues.
Reges was placed on leave while the L'ni
versity investigates his claims that he
openly violates the University's drug and
alcohol policy to protest U.S. drug policy.
The investigation began yesterday.
The move came after University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy received a warning
from national Drug Czar Bob Martinez.
Kennedy said yesterday that he had no

comment on the situation.
The story has also been
noticed around the coun
try. It has been covered by
The New York Times, the
Los Angeles Times, The
Washington Post, USA
Today and NBC News.
Channel 2 ran a segment
about Reges last night on
the 10 p.m. newscast.

Campus response has been varied and
strong. Administrators in the Computer
Science Department have demanded that
Reges be allowed to teach his class while
