# Sailing team tops California to clinch North Series title
## 
### Deborah Claymon Staff writer 
A view across the Bay this
weekend showed Stanford
sailors prevailing in the choppy
waters from the Berkeley har
bor. The Stanford team joyously
recaptured this year's North
Series Championship from last
year's defeat by California, and
was the top qualifier in the
North Team Race Eliminations
for Pacific Coast Champi
onships.
Stanford commanded North
10 on Saturday, taking a strong
first and second in the 12-boat
fleet against competition from
UC-Santa Cruz and Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo in addition to
Cal and other teams. However,
Cal'B top pairing was missing
from this weekend's competi
tion.
Sophomore Brady Sih
returned to the series with
senior crew Matt Dunbar to
capture first in A division,
despite strange wind conditions
and rough, shallow water. Sih
and Dunbar's consistently

strong starts gave them an edge
over the remainder of the fleet
in the short five races of the
regatta.
Paired with Sih for the win
ning combination, seniors Dave
Dowd and Paula Gani confi
dently executed a victory in B
division. Dowd, who has spent
four years battling the North
Series competitors, tactically
overpowered the competition
and managed the gusty Bay
conditions with ease.
Equally impressive was
Stanford's pairing of seniors
Rick Rosen and Rebecca Bryson
in A, with sophomore Haley
King and junior Jen Yeh in B.
Closely behind Sih and Dowd
for second, the pair combined to
put a lot of Cardinal red at the
front of the fleet. King's perfor
mance bodes well for this week
end's women's Pacific Coast
Championships at Cal.
"Haley's performance at the
last two North Series unques
tionably shows her drive to oust
the West Coast competition this
weekend," said coach Blake
Middleton. Women's teams

from UC-Irvine, USC, UCLA
and Cal Poly will contend for
berths at Nationals, to be
hosted by Tulane in June.
Sunday's Team Race Elimi
nations pitted Stanford, Cali
fornia, Santa Cruz and Cal Poly
in a one-round series for the
three berths at the PCC's team
race in San Diego in two weeks.
Stanford excelled, winning all
three races, with Cal Poly fol
lowing 2-1, Cal 1-2, and Santa
Cruz 0-3.
"Team racing has always
been a Stanford strong point,"
says Rosen, who comprised part
of last year's team for Nationals,
which finished eighth. Stanford
has had a berth at Nationals in
team racing for the past five
consecutive seasons. Although
both days of racing were com
paratively smaller than many
regatta days for the Cardinal,
the team has carried this season
to its turning point. Both
women's and coed PCC's are
close at hand, and Stanford is
set to take control of the West
Coast.
