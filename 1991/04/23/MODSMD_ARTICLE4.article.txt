# Budget restraints delay sexual assault task force reforms
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Months after the Sexual Assault Task
Force submitted recommendations to the
University for addressing problems of
rape and other sexual misconduct on
campus, several of the proposals have not
yet been implemented.
Budget constraints have prevented the
University from implementing several of
the task force's proposals, including a
plan to hire a new sexual assault services
coordinator.
The delays have caused frustration
among many students.
"If something isn't done soon," said
senior Vivian Vice of the Rape Education
Project, "the University is going to be in
jeopardy of looking like it is only paying

lip service" to the task force recommenda
tions. Stanford lags behind other schools
such as UCLA, UC-Davis and UC-Hay
ward which already have such coordina
tors, she said.
In November the task force, composed
of students, administrators and police
with experience in sexual-assault mat
ters, submitted its report — the result of
18 months of study — to the administra
tion.
The recommendations included hold
ing a mandatory orientation program for
entering freshmen, changing the judicial
code to facilitate the investigation of sex
ual misconduct cases and hiring the coor
dinator.
An orientation program, weekend
workshops on self-defense, and a central
office for student groups dealing with sex

ual assault have been approved by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
will go into effect next year, according to
senior Susan Epstein, a student member
of the task force.
But because of budget constraints due
to recent cutbacks and the effects of the
indirect-cost controversy, administrators
say they cannot afford to hire the full
time coordinator. As a result, the Univer
sity is trying to spread out the coordina
tor's responsibilities among several
departments.
Epstein said, however, that this effort
is "not meeting the needs of survivors at
all."
Instead, the University has appointed
several committees to examine alterna
tive ways of achieving the task force
goals. One committee of eight counselors

from Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices is currently being trained to deal
with response efforts for victims of sexual
assault.
But Vice said the "focused effort "' of a
single coordinator who has enough time
to devote to the numerous issues that
arise out of sexual-assault cases is
needed.
Another committee is studying how to
better coordinate the education and pre
vention efforts of all campus groups
involved with sexual-misconduct matters.
The suggested changes to the judicial
code must be reviewed and approved by
the Committee of 15, which is responsible
for all amendments to the code. The com
mittee has had a preliminary meeting to
review the report, said Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole, a member of the com

mittee.
In addition, administrators are com
posing a comprehensive statement of
University policy on sexual misconduct to
be made by Kennedy early next year, act
ing Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son said.
Some students involved with the task
force, however, feel they are being
stonewalled by an administration that
does not consider sexual-assault preven
tion to be a University priority.
"The funding [for the sexual assault
services coordinator] could be prioritized
if people felt this issue was important
enough," said senior Michelle Finkel of
the Rape Education Project.
Finkel and others say the current
efforts by the University are
insufficient and will only serve to
make the reporting and recovery
process after a sexual assault
more complicated. For instance,
victims may need services that
counselors at CAPS can not pro
vide, such as help with housing
concerns, judicial issues or aca
demic problems.
The coordinator recommended
by the task force would have
authority in all these areas, and
having one visible figure for stu
dents to turn to would ease the
burden of victims, Finkel said.
But Robinson said the CAPS
group would be able to deal with
issues other than counseling and
that even though there are eight
counselors, students would only
need to deal with one person in
the group.
Pat Fabiano, director of the
Health Promotion Program at
Cowell Student Health Center
and a chair of the task force, said
that although "educational
efforts are outstanding," many
students do not know there are
services available to help them.
The administration does not
dispute the need for improved
sexual-assault response services.
"It's a very important issue, and
it has high priority," Robinson
said.
