Some bisexual students say
they often feel as if they are
caught between two worlds, expe
riencing misunderstanding and
discrimination from straight peo
ple as well as the gay community.
Hut both communities will get
a chance to learn more about
bisexuality during a two-week cel
ebration that includes the word
"bisexual" in its title for the first
time.
Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week has been expanded to Bisex
ual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Days (BGLAD), which runs this
week and next week.
Steve Pitts, a graduate student
on the BGLAD planning commit
tee, said that when it was time to
start planning the celebration a
few people "realized the name was

not really inclusive."
But at the first meeting to dis
cuss the awareness event, Pitts
said he was surprised to find the
proposed name change "hotly
debated" for an hour, during
which no consensus could be
reached.
The debate was "a reminder
that people are 'biphobic' even
within the gay and lesbian com
munity," Pitts added.
He said he believes that if the
bisexual community is to feel a
part of the event, it needs to be
included in the name. Bisexual

people feel marginalized, he
added. "People have been made to
feel uncomfortable coming out as
bisexual at (Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual) community center
events."
But some bisexual people say
they experience little or no dis
crimination.
One senior, "Tim," said he
prefers not to tell people who are
not friends about his bisexuality
because he does not want them to
have preconceived ideas. But
when friends who know him well
find out, they are very accepting
because they knew him before, he
said.
Bisexual people are considered
"fence sitters" because they can
go either way, Tim said. "Some
people think you are either
straight or gav, and there is no in
between."
While he said he has heard of
harsh comments directed at bisex
ual people, he believes Stanford
students are generally open
minded.
Tim added that he was glad to

hear about the name change and
events for bisexuals. "I think any
type of discussion is good," he
said.
Another undergraduate,
Shawn, also said he has not had
any negative reactions to his
bisexuality. People tend to be curi
ous and eager to understand, he
said, and some of those he tells
admit that they are also bisexual.
Shawn said he believes that
sexuality is a continuum, and
"individuals tend to have a
propensity toward one end or the
other." He believes the majority of
the population is in the bisexual
range, he added.
"Some people are more
attracted to personality and intel
lect than a certain sex," he said.
"They are attracted to people for
who they are."
Mike, a sophomore, also said
that people are usually open about
sexuality. "I have not seen any dis
crimination," he said. However, "A
lot of people think there are cate
gories everyone fits into. ... It
gets really annoying."
Mike said he tells people he is
gay but considers himself bisex
ual. Some gays say bisexual people
are "not being true to them
selves," he said. But "I know who
I am, so labels do not matter," he
added.
The use of "bisexual" along
with "gay" and "lesbian" is impor
tant because it shows people they
can be whomever they want to be,
Mike said.
He added that he feels "more
excluded from the heterosexual
world than the gay world."

But for some bisexual students,
being accepted by the gay and les
bian community can be even more
difficult than gaining acceptance
by straight people.
Senior Sairus Patel said he
started coming out as a bisexual to
his gay friends last summer and
instead of getting support was
met with mostly negative reac
tions. "People said bisexuality
does not exist," he said. "They
were saying I do not exist. It was
really alienating."
Patel said he suggested the
name change to BGLAD because
"All the organizations at Stanford
have had a very gay and lesbian
emphasis."
The objections to the change
angered him, he said. "Someone
said they did not think bisexuals
even belonged at the [community
center]. That is the same attitude
that prevented me from coming
out bisexual."
But he added that he thinks
people who have shown "bipho
bic" reactions have come around.
"People are starting to get used to
it, if not accept it,"he said.
Last year was the first time
GALA week included a bisexual
event, a panel discussion like the
one planned for May 1, "Bisexual
People Speak Out." Patel said he
had identified as gay for three
years when he attended the panel,
which acted as a "catalyst for my
coming out as bisexual."
Patel said he believes the idea
of "monosexuality" is a very
dichotomized, oppressive view.
"Just as gay and lesbian people
grow up in the straight closet, it is
the same for bisexual people," he
said.
There is also the same fear of
rejection and being different that
prevents bisexual people from

coming out. Bisexuality isn't men
tioned and there is a lack of role
models, Patel added.
He said some of his women
friends have told him that they
date men, but cannot tell their les
bian friends in their support
group about their bisexuality.
"People have to close a part of
themselves off," he said. "That
cannot be healthy."
Patel said he has realized that
many of the stereotypes the gay
community has of bisexual people
are the same that the straight
community has of gays. "They
think I am trying to recruit them
by coming out as bisexual to
them," he said.
He added that he uses some of
the tactics learned from his
involvement in Queerland, a vocal
gay-visibility group, to end dis
crimination against bisexual peo
ple. Education is important, but
"At some point you just have to be
in people's faces. I do not want to
explain myself all the time.
" 'Biphobia' exists. Hiding is
not the way to deal with it,"he
said. Besides working on BGLAD,
Patel has started a bulletin board
for bisexual people at the commu
nity center. He also said he plans
to work on a bisexual archives
project like the center's gay and
lesbian archives.
According to senior Leila Wice,
the change is more than just a
change in the name of the event.
"I think the organizers have made
an effort to plan programs" about
bisexual issues, she said. "And
whatever opinion people arrive at
through those discussions, I think
it is good that we are thinking
about them."
She said she does not agree
with the claim that adding the
label bisexual dilutes the gay

pride movement.
"For many of us, sexual orien
tation is not very clear-cut and I
think that honesty about that cre
ates room for more people to chal
lenge the assumption that every
one is, or at least ought to be,
straight," she said. "In addition to
the usual heterosexism, I hear
from both sides that bisexuality is
just a phase I will grow out of."
Within the gay community,
there is a lot of joking based on
stereotypes of bisexual women
and men as promiscuous, Wice
said. "Some lesbians claim to
avoid bisexual women because we
are 'traitors to the cause,' " she
added.
But she said she strongly
believes that " 'bi' women and
men who are willing to come out
have a lot to offer both the hetero
sexual and homosexual worlds we
live between."
Wice said she is aware of the
histories of the organizations
bisexual people are expecting to be
included in. "For instance, looking
at the new BGLAD calendars, I
have heard comments about how
hard women within the gay com
munity worked to get the word
'lesbian' up front in the first
place," she said. "And now it is like
there is one more subgroup that is
vying for acknowledgement."
She said being bisexual works
as "an advantage and a disadvan
tage" because it is "a combination
of feeling excluded from both
(communities) in some ways and
included in both."
A concern people have is that it
is easier for bisexual people to
pass as straight, Wice said. But
"for me, bisexuality does not
mean pretending you are straight
half the time," she added.
