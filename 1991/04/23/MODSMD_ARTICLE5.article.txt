Some bisexual students say
they often feel as if they are
caught between two worlds, expe
riencing misunderstanding and
discrimination from straight peo
ple as well as the gay community.
Hut both communities will get
a chance to learn more about
bisexuality during a two-week cel
ebration that includes the word
"bisexual" in its title for the first
time.
Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week has been expanded to Bisex
ual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Days (BGLAD), which runs this
week and next week.
Steve Pitts, a graduate student
on the BGLAD planning commit
tee, said that when it was time to
start planning the celebration a
few people "realized the name was

not really inclusive."
But at the first meeting to dis
cuss the awareness event, Pitts
said he was surprised to find the
proposed name change "hotly
debated" for an hour, during
which no consensus could be
reached.
The debate was "a reminder
that people are 'biphobic' even
within the gay and lesbian com
munity," Pitts added.
He said he believes that if the
bisexual community is to feel a
part of the event, it needs to be
included in the name. Bisexual

people feel marginalized, he
added. "People have been made to
feel uncomfortable coming out as
bisexual at (Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual) community center
events."
But some bisexual people say
they experience little or no dis
crimination.
One senior, "Tim," said he
prefers not to tell people who are
not friends about his bisexuality
because he does not want them to
have preconceived ideas. But
when friends who know him well
find out, they are very accepting
because they knew him before, he
said.
Bisexual people are considered
"fence sitters" because they can
go either way, Tim said. "Some
people think you are either
straight or gav, and there is no in
between."
While he said he has heard of
harsh comments directed at bisex
ual people, he believes Stanford
students are generally open
minded.
Tim added that he was glad to
