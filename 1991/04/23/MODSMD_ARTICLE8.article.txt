# Students 'leap' to help charity
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Residents of Trancos will
launch "Operation Lilypad" next
month, in a dual mission to break
the world record for leapfrogging
and raise money for Creative
Adventures Learning Center, an
after-school program in East Palo
Alto.
From May 16 to 25, 14 resi
dents of the all-freshman dorm
will- metamorphose into hyperac
tive frogs, leaping over one
another, encircling "Toad Track"
— known in lay terms as Wilbur
Field.
Brian Cook said he proposed
the event to his dormitory last
month because he thought it
would be a "great fund-raising
event"and provide an interesting
twist to the traditional walk-a
thon.
Cook explained that he got the
idea from his alma mater, Nor
wich High School in Vermont,
which broke the old world record
of 600 miles three years ago by
leaping 888.1 miles. The Trancos
leapers plan to rewrite a passage
in the "Guinness Book of World
Records" by covering 1,000 miles.
Struck by the novelty of the
event, Cook's dormmate Justin
Kitch immediately jumped at the

chance to help. "It's something
out of the ordinary and a fun way
to fund raise," he said. Kitch
added that he is "not concerned"
with breaking the old leapfrogging
record.
Sarah Birkeland, who is also
helping to organize the event,
agreed that fund raising is the pri
mary goal. "Sometimes I even for
get we will be breaking a world
record," she said.
The leapers are seeking dona
tions from dormitories and busi
nesses. They plan to set up a table
in White Plaza to encourage stu
dents to pledge a certain amount
of money for each mile they leap.
"Money is the key right now,"
said Cook. Funds will be needed to
set up lights for late-night leaping
and a small canopy for use as a
base on Wilbur Field, he added.
The 14 leapers have all begun a
training program, said Kitch.
Their coach, fellow resident and
jumper Mike Simmons, said he
encourages his teammates to run
several times a week. Although he
does have alternative leapers,
Simmons said he is confident
nobody will croak along the way.
"We're all in good shape. We'll do
well," he said.
The team is in no hurry, he
added. "We'll keep to a pace that's
a little over a brisk walking pace."

Cook explained there will be
three teams of four jumpers every
day. Each will perform two four
hour shifts, the leaping pair rotat
ing with the other two members of
their team every 15 minutes.
Kitch said that as a member of
the crew team, he is in "prime
condition" for the event. Nor is he
worried about the condition his
schoolwork will be in after he ded
icates so many hours to jumping
around a field. "Work shmirk!"
Kitch exclaimed.
Residents said enthusiasm for
the event is motivated mainly by
the desire to fund raise for the
Creative Adventure Learning
Center. The 20 students who have
worked there for the past six
months said they have become
very attached to the children from
East Palo Alto.
Since the schools of East Palo
Alto are understaffed, "The pro
gram really needed our help," said
Cook. The money raised by
"Operation Lilypad" will go
toward buying supplies and hiring
help for the after-school program.
After the leapers complete
1,000 miles, the Toad Track will be
transformed into a party field.
Students from East Palo Alto will
be invited to join Trancos resi
dents and event supporters in a
victory celebration.
