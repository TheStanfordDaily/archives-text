Biddle to speak in SWOPSI class
Paul Biddle, the federal regulator whose allega
tions of overcharging at Stanford sparked the cur
rent indirect-cost controversy, will address the
public tonight.
Biddle will be a guest speaker in a SWOPSI
course on "Military Research at Stanford: History
and Options." His lecture begins at 7 p.m. in room
403 of Sweet Hall.
Biddle said he will address Stanford's research
practices during the past decade and speak to
what the future of research at Stanford may look
like.
Sorority Rush attracts more women,
gives more bids than last year
The number of women who participated in
sorority Rush this year and were offered bids
increased over last year.
More than 160 women completed the week
long Rush process and joined sororities, said
senior Erin Scalley, president of the Intersorority
Council.
There was an increase in interest in sororities
this year, according to Allison Sandy, the sorority
adviser for the Office of Student Activities. Sandy
said 282 women initially registered this year, com
pared to 265 last year.
Not only was there an increase in the number of
women interested, but the number of bids
extended also increased. According to Sandy, 180
bids were offered this year, in contrast to the 138
bids extended last year.

Of the group who rushed, only two women did
not receive bids. Scalley said this occurred because
the women either did not fill out their bid cards
completely or did not attend the full sequence of
Rush events.
The sorority Rush quota was set this year at 29
bids per sorority. Three sororities, Delta Gamma,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Delta Delta went
over the quota, each with a pledge class of 31.
Because the total number of people in each of the
three sororities is less than 70, going over quota
does not violate ISC rules, Scalley said.
The other five sororities did not fill the quota
set last Sunday. Scalley said these five sororities
are allowed to extend informal bids until next
year's Rush.

Ehrlich wins service award
Stanford Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich has been
awarded a Distinguished Service citation from the
University of Kansas for his "contributions to
humanity."
Ehrlich, who has taught at Stanford for more
than 30 years, was one of the first biologists to
focus on environmental issues. His most famous
book, "The Population Bomb," focused on the dan
gers of the world's exploding population and the
human risks associated with extinction of species.
He has written more than 30 books, and he won
last year's Crafoord Prize in Population Biology,
given by the Royal Swedish Academy for achieve
ments not covered by Nobel Prizes.
