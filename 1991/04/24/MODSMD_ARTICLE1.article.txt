# Head of elections resigns
## XTV, MEChA put on runoff ballot 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Elections commissioner Raul
Lopez dropped a bomb at the
ASSU Senate meeting last night,
announcing his immediate resig
nation.
Lopez's announcement was a

stunning reaction
to a four-hour sen
ate meeting in
which the initially
defeated special
fee requests of
MEChA, XTV and
a redesigned ASSU
financial aid office
were placed on
the runofT ballot.

The office replaces the ASSU lobby
office.
Project Motivation, a program
that encourages Latino high
school students to attend college,
will also be placed on the runoff
ballot because it was inadver
tently left off the ballot during
last week's election.
In his statement to the senate,
Lopez said that the runoff will
have "no more democracy."
"I don't think that I can do an
effective job as elections commis
sioner if I don't believe in what
the senate has charged me to do,"
he added. Lopez, a graduate stu
dent, refused to comment any fur
ther on his resignation after the
meeting.
Associate elections commis
sioner Enda Hu will assume
Lopez's role in the runoff election.
"I will do the best I can with
the limited amount of time I have
before the runoff election," said
Hu, a sophomore. Hu said he will
meet with Lopez today to review
the current state of the elections
commission.
Hu refused to comment on the
second chance of the special-fee
requests because he did not attend
the senate meeting.


Lopez
Reaction from the two Council
of Presidents slates involved in
the runoff was mixed.
"It is irresponsible for [Lopez]
to step down from his position,"
said People's Platform COP candi
date Mae Lee, a junior. "He is
abdicating his duties as elections
commissioner."
But Students First COP slate
members had a very different
response.
"Raul did a good job," said Beth
Morgan, a sophomore. "It is very
unfortunate that he felt the need
to resign."
Hearings officer Jason Moore
said he will "think about the
larger ramifications of everything,
including the senate's and
[Lopez's] actions tonight." Moore,
a junior, said he would make a
decision today about his future as
hearings officer.
Before Lopez shocked the sen
ate, the Law School meeting room
was packed with more than 80
students who supported placing
the special-fee requests on the
runoff ballot.
Supporters of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student organization,
said they were concerned about
the effects losing a special-fee
request would have on their com
munity.
Anna Mata, co-chair of
MEChA, cited an incomplete
statement in the elections hand
book and "no recommendation"
from The Daily editorial board as
election irregularities meriting
placement on the runoff ballot.

But Lopez argued that mem
bers of MEChA submitted an
statement from a previous year
and never checked the preview
copy of the handbook.
After a bitter debate in which
several senators criticized an
attempt by the senate to "get the
students to vote correctly,"
MEChA received the two-thirds
vote necessary to be placed on the
runoff ballot.
XTV, whose budget was left out
of the handbook, faced a similar
debate and received less enthusi
astic support from the senate. But
in the end most senators agreed
that not putting XTV on the ballot
would be "hypocritical."
All of the special-fee requests
must be approved by 15 percent of
the student body as well as 50 per
cent of the students voting.
The senate also approved plac
ing a referendum on the ballot
asking students if they support
the creation of an ASSU financial
aid office.
Senator Naomi Onaga, a co
sponsor of the bill, said the finan
cial aid office should be on the
runoff ballot because students
overwhelmingly approved the ref
erendum in last week's election
asking if they support the ASSU
committing resources to fight for
financial aid.
Onaga, a senior, said the fed
eral government will be making
important decisions about finan
cial aid next fall and Stanford stu
dents need to be "connected to a
national office to work on the
issue."
In other action last night, the
senate validated the election and
officially set the runoff for May 2-3.
