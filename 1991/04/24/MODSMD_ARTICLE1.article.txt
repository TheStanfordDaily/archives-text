# Head of elections resigns
## XTV, MEChA put on runoff ballot 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Elections commissioner Raul
Lopez dropped a bomb at the
ASSU Senate meeting last night,
announcing his immediate resig
nation.
Lopez's announcement was a

stunning reaction
to a four-hour sen
ate meeting in
which the initially
defeated special
fee requests of
MEChA, XTV and
a redesigned ASSU
financial aid office
were placed on
the runofT ballot.

The office replaces the ASSU lobby
office.
Project Motivation, a program
that encourages Latino high
school students to attend college,
will also be placed on the runoff
ballot because it was inadver
tently left off the ballot during
last week's election.
In his statement to the senate,
Lopez said that the runoff will
have "no more democracy."
"I don't think that I can do an
effective job as elections commis
sioner if I don't believe in what
the senate has charged me to do,"
he added. Lopez, a graduate stu
dent, refused to comment any fur
ther on his resignation after the
meeting.
Associate elections commis
sioner Enda Hu will assume
Lopez's role in the runoff election.
"I will do the best I can with
the limited amount of time I have
before the runoff election," said
Hu, a sophomore. Hu said he will
meet with Lopez today to review
the current state of the elections
commission.
Hu refused to comment on the
second chance of the special-fee
requests because he did not attend
the senate meeting.
