Nigerians clash over religion
IxAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — Muslims and Chris
tians clashed in the northern Nigerian city of
Bauchi yesterday. Witnesses said at least 80
people were killed and a dozen churches set
ablaze.
The state's military governor, Lt. Col. Abu
Ali, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. In a radio
broadcast, he expressed sympathy for the fam
ilies of those who had lost their lives, but did
not say how many people were killed.
Witnesses reached by telephone from Lagos,
the capital, said bus terminals were filled with
thousands of Christians trying to flee the Mus
lim-dominated north for the mainly Christian
south.
The clash came as 3,000 athletes were in
Bauchi for the annual National Sports Festival.
They were trying to get out of the city, the wit
nesses said.
Muslims are believed to outnumber Chris
tians in this nation of more than 100 million
people, Africa's most populous country.
Earthquake killed at least 74
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) — Rescuers
searched the rubble of buildings and interna
tional aid began pouring in yesterday for vic
tims of a powerful earthquake that killed at
least 74 people, injured more than 800 and left
thousands homeless.
The Monday night tremor, which measured
7.4 on the Richter scale, was the deadliest in
Central America since 1986, when an earth
quake left 1,500 people dead in El Salvador.
Officials said there were at least 50 con
firmed deaths in Costa Rica and 24 more in
Panama's remote Atlantic province of Bocas del
Torro, which had not registered an earthquake
since 1916.
Bridges and roads throughout Costa Rica
were destroyed or damaged by the earthquake,
making it difficult to assess the extent of
deaths and damage. Neighboring Nicaragua
sent helicopters to fly over areas cut off bv
landslides and road damage.
Debt spurs debate in the Senate
WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal budget
the Senate began debating yesterday contains
an undebatable $210 billion item — third
largest amount in the bill — that buys no fed
eral services at all.
It's the ever-increasing interest on the
national debt and a figure that rarely comes up
when lawmakers debate spending priorities.
