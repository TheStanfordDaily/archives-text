# Gorbachev 'anti-crisis' program approved

### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet legis
lature yesterday passed President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program to
pull the country out of its economic
crisis through sharp budget cuts, pri
vatization and steps to introduce a
convertible currency.
Lawmakers, meeting in the Krem
lin, also recommended creation of a
committee of representatives of all 15
Soviet republics to coordinate the eco
nomic reforms that can now be imple
mented, the state news agency Tass
reported.
Gorbachev warned this month that
the nation was heading toward "eco
nomic collapse" and proposed the
package of "anti-crisis" measures to
avert a catastrophe.

Among the recommended measures
is a large reduction in government
spending to cut the budget deficit,
which is expected to balloon from
about $106 billion in 1990 to more
than $230 billion this year.
However, the economic reform pro
gram does not include a specific target
on how much the budget deficit should
be reduced.
The Gorbachev program also pro
posed to begin selling off some small
state enterprises. Under his plan, two
thirds of all small businesses in the
service and consumer sectors would be
in private hands by the end of 1992.
The program calls additionally for
faster steps to establish stock and
commodity exchanges and would make

the ruble a freely convertible interna
tional currency. The ruble exchange
rates are now artificially set by the
government.
Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov pre
sented the program to the legislature
Monday with the warning that if it was
not adopted and the current strikes
continued, industrial output and
national income would fall by 20 per
cent this year.
Answering questions yesterday,
Pavlov said the program's authors did
not try to make it comprehensive or
detailed. "It is impossible, for public
life is so complex ... that neither the
government nor a whole data process
ing center can tackle all the issues in
one program," Tass quoted him as say

ing.
The program also has a political
component.
Gorbachev suggested a nationwide
moratorium on all strikes, rallies and
political demonstrations. Lawmakers
are scheduled later in the week to con
sider a proposed amendment to labor
laws that would ban strikes.
A seven-week strike by an estimated
300,000 coal miners has demanded the
indexation of wages to compensate for
nationwide price increases that took
effect April 2.
Pavlov said the government had
prepared a presidential decree on
income indexation, according to Tass,
but no details were reported.
