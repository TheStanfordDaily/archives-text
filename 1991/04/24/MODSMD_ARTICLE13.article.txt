# Air Force selects $95-billion tactical fighter
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Pentagon yesterday
picked a team led by the Lockheed Corp. to receive a
$12.1 billion development contract for a fighter jet
that Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said "will
assure American air superiority well into the next
century."
Pratt & Whitney was awarded the initial contract
for engines for the 650 Advanced Tactical Fighter
planes, which the Air Force estimated would cost $95
billion by the time all of them are delivered, starting
in the year 2005. Already questions have been raised
in Congress about the necessity for the plane, and
whether the true cost will far exceed that estimate.
The General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Corp.,
making its re-entry into fighter production after
more than 50 years, are Lockheed's principal part
ners on the winning team. The big losers were the
Northrop Corp. and the McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
who had teamed up to offer an alternative design for
the stealthy, supersonic twin-engine jet. Unlike their
competition, both those companies have staked
much of their future on building military aircraft.
The ATF is designed to replace McDonnell Dou
glas' F-15, the star of the Persian Gulf War.
"The Air Force's F-15s are outstanding aircraft,
and they swept the skies in Desert Storm," Rice said.
"However, when the ATF is first deployed, the F-15s
will be over 25 years old . . . thus, the ATF will ensure
American air superiority well into the next century."
Robert Hale, an analyst for the Congressional
Budget Office, told the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee on Monday that the futuristic fighter planes
could end up costing as much as $135 million apiece,
compared with the Air Force's highest estimate of
$108 million.

Some critics have argued that the plane no longer
justifies the large expenditure because the Cold War
is over and the F-15 performed so woll in the Persian
Gulf.
"I don't know who is the adversary that requires
us to have this plane," Joshua Epstein, a specialist in

the defense budget and national security at the lib
eral Brookings Institution.
But the Air Force Association, in a report issued
in September, argued that "While unfashionable
these days to say so, there is still real cause for cau
tion concerning Soviet military power."
