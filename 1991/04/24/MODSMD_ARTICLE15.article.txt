## Try a little harder 
### 
Budgetary concerns are
valid, but University
must push for funding

CITING THE ONGOING
budgetary crisis, Stanford
administration officials con
tinue to delay implementation of
some key recommendations of last
quarter's Sexual Assault Task
Force, including the hiring of a
full-time Coordinator of Sexual
Assault Response Services.
Although the current budgetary
problems are severe, the Univer
sity must do more to ensure that a
full-time coordinator is hired as
soon as possible.
The administration has done
much in response to the task
force's report: Next year the Uni
versity will run a mandatory orien
tation program on sexual assault
issues, provide weekly workshops
on self-defense and set up a central
office for student groups that deal
with sexual assault. In addition,
University President Donald
Kennedy will focus on the Univer
sity's sexual assault policy in a
statement. The University
deserves credit for taking these
important and concrete steps.
But the administration claims it
is unable to follow more of the rec
ommendations due to its bud
getary problems. Even though the
money required ti> hire a full-time
coordinator may seem small com
pared to the University's huge
operating budget, the current
deficit is so great that many aca
demic programs are in danger of
being severely cut. Since the pri
mary goal of a University is to
instruct, administrators claim it is
not feasible to begin a new non
academic program while cutting
those that directly educate stu
dents.

The argument is defensible, and
the motives are admirable, but the
conclusion is unacceptable. A stag
gering number of students on cam
pus have been victims of sexual
assault: estimates range up to 33
percent of Stanford women and 15
percent of Stanford men. The
incredible trauma involved in such
an event must surely interfere
with a student's academic work,
not to mention his or her psycho
logical well-being.
Sexual assault is clearly a top
priority for students: The two top
vote-getting Council of Presidents
slates both made the hiring of a
sexual assault officer a central
issue of their platforms, and the
Rape Education Project received
the second-highest number of
votes of any fee request. University
administrators continue to stress
the high priority of combating sex
ual assault on campus. Rarely can
such unanimity of opinion be
found among students and
between students and administra
tors.
During times of budget cuts,
there is a tendency to keep all new
programs on hold if established
programs, particularly established
academic programs, are being cut.
But the magnitude of the problem
dictates that in this case such a
tendency must be resisted.
At the very least, the University
should look into alternative meth
ods of funding. Past students of
Stanford must have needed these
programs as much as current stu
dents do; thus, there must be many
alumni who would earmark extra
donations for such programs, if
they were given the opportunity.
But the University is instead
looking into "alternative ways of
achieving the task force goals," a
redundant search on the heels of
an 18-month study by a well-quali
fied task force. The administration
must try harder to hire a full-time
