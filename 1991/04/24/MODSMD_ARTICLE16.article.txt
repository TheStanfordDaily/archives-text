Kennedy addresses controversy surrounding lecturer

Having seen two days' worth
of commentary on the investiga
tion of Stuart Reges, I hope I may
be permitted to make a few points about
the issues it has raised.
First, it is now an investigation and
only that. If the investigation reveals
grounds for discipline, then action will
be taken by those to whom Mr. Reges
reports.
Second, we are talking about conduct
and not protected speech. While the dis
tinction is not always simple, it is not —
as The Daily editorial suggests — true
that words, or even "personal conversa
tion," necessarily constitute protected
speech. Criminal conspiracy, incitement
and other long-established crimes are
primarily verbal, but that does not pro
tect those who commit them from prose
cution and punishment.
The Daily editorial is badly confused
about the speech/conduct boundary, and
its attempt to establish a particular kind
of speech — personal conversations

between faculty members and students
— as wholly exempt from the burden of
exercising professional responsibility is
misguided. I doubt The Daily has consid
ered the implications of this position.
Were its view to prevail, a faculty
member who subjected a student to
repeated and unwanted sexual proposi
tions, for instance, could not be charged
with sexual harassment; after all, those
words would just be "personal conversa
tion." But I do not want to magnify the
difference between us: There is much to
be said for The Daily's underlying point
that constitutionally protected speech
should not be the basis of discipline
against a member of the University com
munity.
Third, the letter to Bob Martinez trig
gered the action not because of the iden
tity of the addressee, but because it
claimed explicit actions that appeared to
constitute professional misconduct. By
coincidence, I simultaneously learned of
Reges' claim, made to a Stanford vice
president, that he hosted, at University

expense, a class-connected dinner for
students at which he knowingly permit
ted unlawful consumption of alcohol. We
took action on the basis of specific
claims, not rhetorical ones.
Fourth, much has been made of the
issue of "hypocrisy," and it is alleged that
"the University administration" (The
Daily's favorite fictional monolith) does
not agree with the new regulations in
principle and does not enforce them in
practice. I think it is fair to say most of
us dislike the need for government inter
vention into the arrangements for com
munity life.
It is also true that we have previously
been perhaps too casual about the serv
ing of alcohol at campus events. But it is
our obligation, however we may feel
about it, to tighten up our practices and
comply. There just isn't any room for
hypocrisy.
Finally, let me repeat some of my own
views on the drug issue — with the
preface that these are old and often
stated; preceding both the new law and

the present investigation of Reges,
and unconnected to either. It seems to
me unconscionable for responsible per
sons on this campus to recommend the
use of illicit drugs.
As a one-time neurophysiologist, 1 am
astonished at the assertion that these
drugs — powerful agents with profound
effects on the central nervous function
— are ways to have fun without adverse
consequences. There is no basis what
ever for such claims; the evidence is all
in the other direction.
And as one who cares about the
health of our society, I am deeply trou
bled by the promotion of a trade that is
responsible for destroying lives in our
inner cities and for political assassina
tion and instability in the Third World.
Those privileged intellectuals who argue
in support of what is in fact an industry
based upon exploitation are, I think,
morally disoriented.
