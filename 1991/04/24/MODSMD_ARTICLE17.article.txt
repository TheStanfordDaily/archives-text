# If Reges goes, Computer Science Department will suffer
## 
### 
This letter concerns the
recent placement of Computer Sci
ence Senior Lecturer Stuart Reges
on administrative leave. As one of Reges'
students in Computer Science 1098, let
me say what an excellent lecturer and
teacher he is. It's obvious that he spends
a great deal of time preparing interesting
lectures and creating thorough and perti
nent homework assignments.
If Reges is not allowed to continue to
teach Computer Science 1098, not only
will the class be significantly disrupted,
but also I will feel robbed of an opportu
nity to learn from one of the best teach
ers in the Computer Science Depart
ment.

While the federal government seeks to
punish Reges for his use and advocacy of
drugs, Stanford as an educational insti
tution should recognize and protect
Reges' right to free speech and privacy.
Individuals at Stanford must be
allowed to act and speak freely so long as
they do not directly limit another's free
dom in so doing. Only by allowing this
individual freedom can an educational
institution maintain a marketplace of
ideas. Without this individual freedom,
education will be reduced to the accep
tance of the dogma of the majority with
out thought and true understanding of
the issues.
It would be hypocritical of Stanford to

fire Reges and yet keep such books in it's
libraries as Aldous Huxley's "The Doors
of Perception," which advocates the use
of LSD as a means of achieving mystical
experiences. Why should Huxley have
the right to describe his personal
thoughts on drugs when Reges does not?
And I'm sure there are many other
books in our libraries containing ideas
that the government would consider
dangerous to students. Likewise, there
must be other people at Stanford who
have ideas the government would con
sider dangerous. Stanford should strive
to save its students and teachers from
the smothering "protection" of the fed
eral government.
In sum, if Reges is fired, I will feel

Stanford is denying me a significant part
of my education. First, I will miss out on
the opportunity to learn from a truly
outstanding professor. And second, it will
become more difficult to find students
and teachers who are willing to express
different and important ideas which are
not commonly accepted.
If Stanford demonstrates such an
obvious disregard for the education of its
students, I will lose a great deal of
respect for my future alma mater, and
after graduation will be much less
inclined to help Stanford, financially or
otherwise.
