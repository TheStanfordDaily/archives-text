## Getting high on speech 
### 
Drugs don't usually make
me laugh. Stories about babies
born addicted to crack and
teenagers dying because of drug-related
violence or heart failure cast a pall that
makes humor unsavory, if not downright
offensive.
When I heard about Stuart Reges last
Saturday, however, it was hard to restrain
myself; the absurdity of his actions
seemed difficult to match. Let's just say
that bragging to the drug czar about the
use of hallucinogens didn't strike me as a
particularly bright idea.
And Reges' law-flouting folly went fur
ther: He made a point of revealing his vio
lations of University policy to University
officials, then had the gall to express his
displeasure at their decision to suspend
him. Logic didn't appear to be the man's
strong point; he certainly seemed to
deserve what he got.
My mirth over the situation started to
fade only with the gradual, grudging real
ization that Reges' actions were not only
logical, but also entirely justified.
His letter to The Daily on Monday illu
minated the method to his madness. In
the course of a flawed and disturbing, yet
ultimately convincing, argument, Reges
showed his verbal jousts with the govern
ment to be the result not of a death wish,
but of a rational, legitimate protest of the
invasion of privacy.
Reges is hardly an unstained hero,
wrongly beleaguered by evil government
fascists; drugs are dangerous, despite his
rhetoric. In his rush to proclaim the war
on drugs "frightening" and hypocritical,
he glosses over the harmful, often lethal

consequences of cocaine, heroin and alco
hol use all too quickly.
And he is simply deluding himself
when he says hallucinogens have no
adverse effects and that fear of such
effects is a "bad" reason not to experi
ment with LSD or MDA. The introduc
tion into the body of any foreign sub
stance powerful enough to warp percep
tions is dangerous, and his suggestions to
the contrary do a serious disservice; MDA
isn't Nutrasweet.
Even if drugs were physically innocu
ous, I'd hardly be one of Reges' admirers.
Drug use isn't the intellectual and spiri
tual virtue he makes it out to be; reliance
on hallucinogens for enlightenment
marks a significant failure of the human
spirit, an estrangement from our own
lives. A life mediated by chemicals just
doesn't seem worth living.
But a life without choices seems even
less palatable. I think drug use is stupid,
but I agree with Reges to this extent: He
should have every right to act stupidly in
the privacy of his own home. He should
even have free reign to advocate his brand
of stupidity because the only victims of
these actions are the stupid themselves.
Given his beliefs about the benefits of
drug use and the injustice of government
and University policies prohibiting it,
Reges has done the only ethically consis
tent thing. It's hard for me to admit it,
but he's an activist and a largely
admirable one. He has done everything in
his power to demand we be given control
over our own lives.
I'm no nihilist; a strong central gov
ernment is an indispensable element of

social order. We need police officers and
taxes and gun control laws, because it's a
wacky, wacky world out there, and some
one has to protect us from each other so
that we can continue to enjoy our free
doms.
But that's where it should stop. When
the government starts protecting us from
ourselves, the whole premise of our free
dom comes into question.
The government can hardly be
expected to change its drug policy when a
college lecturer writes to tell them it's
wrong, but the University, at least, can be
expected to stick to its policy. In keeping
with its ideal of the freedom of academic
exploration and expression, Stanford
originally chose to ignore Reges' declara
tions of drug use. Now, when money has
become a question, the clamps have come
down.
It's a sad day when someone with
Reges' intellectual capacity feels the need
to ingest a chemical to make his life more
interesting. But it's a far sadder and more
frightening one when we no longer have
the freedom to make that kind of mistake.
