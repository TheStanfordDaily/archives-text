## New pediatric intensive care unit will be large, modern facility 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
A painted window provides
imaginary sunlight for a patient
in the Pediatric Intensive Care
Unit (PICU) at Stanford Hospital.
Weary parents, medical equip
ment and boxes of supplies
obstruct the dimly lit hallways.
The staff seems to be the only
component of the unit that is not
10 years out of date.
Fortunately, this gloomy situa
tion will be remedied when the
new, expanded PICU opens in
early June at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital. In the
recently constructed hospital,
each PICU patient will have the
chance to bathe in sunlight,
thanks to huge windows in every
room.
The PICU is the only division
of the Department of Pediatrics
that will increase in size when the
Medical Center's pediatric ser
vices — which are currently
shared between Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford and Stanford Hos
pital — are consolidated under
one roof at the new hospital.
The PICU serves critically ill
patients ranging in age from one
day to 21 years.
"The field of pediatric intensive
care is a new phenomenon in pedi
atrics," says Dr. Lorry Frankel,
co-director of Stanford Hospital's
PICU. "Typically, the intensive
care aspects of pediatrics have
been in neonatology, that is, care
of the sick newborns and prema
ture infants."
Currently, the PICU consists of
10 beds — nine in crowded three

bed rooms and one in an isolation
room. In the new hospital, 20 beds
will be available to critically ill
children, and 16 of them will be
able to be used to isolate patients.
"The new unit will have double
the number of beds and an
increase of at least 250 percent in
terms of square footage," accord
ing to Frankel.
In addition to increasing in
size, the new unit will be equipped
with state-of-the-art equipment.
In the existing unit, the bedside
monitoring equipment is between
10 and 15 years old. Each monitor
can only record four vital signs:
heart rate, respiration, blood pres
sure and central venous pressure
(the pressure around the heart).
The new unit will be equipped
with Hewlett Packard "Merlin"
monitors, which are multichannel
oscilloscopes with multicolored
screens. The Merlin oscilloscopes
can monitor up to eight of a
patient's vital signs at once. In
addition to the four signs which
can be observed now, the new
equipment will allow staff to
check the pressures in the brain
and the pulmonary artery as well
as such cardiovascular parame
ters as oxygen saturation of the
blood and carbon dioxide secre
tion.
These new monitors can store
information for up to 24 hours,
after which time a patient's data
can be dumped into a computer
bank for permanent storage.
In addition to new equipment,
all services are centralized in the
new unit.
The new PICU is attached to
the hospital in such a way that the

operating room is only 100 feet
from the patients' rooms. The
PICU staff contributed to the
design and planning of the new
unit in order to make it as func
tional and as attractive as possi
ble. As a result of their recommen
dations, a satellite pharmacy and

a miniature radiology laboratory
will be located in the new PICU
section, and resident staffs sleep
ing quarters will be adjacent to
the patient rooms.
A parent lounge, with three
bedrooms and kitchen facilities,
will be available for parents who

have traveled a long way to be
with their ill children.
"Over 250 patients per year
come from over 30 miles away to
seek treatment at our unit," said
Frankel. "Families need a place to
stay."
The nursing staff of the unit

will also greatly increase in size.
The unit has been severely under
staffed in the past couple of years,
according to Frankel, but this
problem should be remedied in
the new unit.
"It should take about three to
six months (for the new unit] to be
operating at capacity or near
capacity level," said Frankel.
"This is a golden opportunity for
Stanford to further develop its
pediatric services. The new chil
dren's hospital will be one of a few
children's hospitals located on a
university campus, adjacent to
and affiliated with a medical
school."
Currently, about 40 percent of
the patients at Stanford Hospi
tal's PICU are surgical patients —
that is, they are in the unit
because they will undergo or have
just had major surgery. Since
Stanford has recently come to the
forefront in the areas of heart
transplant and major cardiac cor
rective surgery, a large number of
cardiac surgery patients stay in
the PICU.
The additional 60 percent of
the FICU's patients are called
"medical patients." They may
have cancer, cystic fibrosis, respi
ratory failure, organ failure,
severe diabetes or trauma due to
some accident. "Hopefully, it
will be easier to deliver quality
care in our new facility," said
Frankel. "The whole staff is very
excited about the move."
When asked if there is anything
he would change about the new
hospital, Frankel replied, "Just
one thing: I would have had them
put a window in my office."

A nurse tends to a premature infant in the Pediatric Infant Care Unit (PICU) at Stanford Hospital. The unit
is dim, crowded and outdated, but is being replaced with a new, expanded unit in the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital. The new PICU will have real windows in every room, as opposed to the painted win
dows in the old PICU.
