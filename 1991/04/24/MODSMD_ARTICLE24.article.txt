# Novice Bug explores firefly sexuality

And so begins the reign of a new Sci
ence Bug. Well, not really: It's the spirit
of the Bug that matters, and that will
never change. (How you see this spirit is
up to you; I prefer to see it as Carl
Sagan's image hovering over my Macin
tosh.) I'm just the latest conduit — a sci
entific Whoopi Goldberg — ready to
tune in to all great minds and bring wis
dom before the eyes of millions.
Entering the realm of tW Science
Bug Spirit is difficult and frightening.
The possibilities for humiliation are
endless; the pressure is intense. It's
worse than "American Gladiators." (But
not quite as bad as playing Banzai Run
with a lot of little kids watching you.
You know if you screw up and don't get
a high score they're all going to go home
and ponder mortality over a strong glass
of Yoo-hoo.)
On with the show . . .
Q,Why do fireflies' rear ends light
.up?
A. It's a bioluminescent thing. You
• wouldn't understand. Actually,
fireflies (also known as lightning bugs)
flash for many reasons, most of which
involve sex. (The rest involve an ongo
ing bridge game.)
Imagine the little blinking lights as
pick-up lines. Each species has its own
characteristic pattern of flashes. At
dusk, male fireflies fly a few feet above
the ground, waving their blinking buns
about, trying to attract babes. The
females sit in the grass, do their nails,
talk about the latest issue of Cosmopoli
tan and occasionally look up and laugh
at the guys. Firefly mating goes some

thing like this:
Male (Species 1): Come on baby, light
my fire.
Female (Species 3): I'd rather be
stuck in the grille of a Yugo.
Male (Species 2 — the Stanford sub
species): Are you going to study at Green
Library tonight?
Female sighs heavily, averts her
gaze.
Male (Species 3): You look like you
need a back rub.
Female swoons noticeably; the couple
retires discreetly under a blade of grass.
A combination of several aspects of
firefly biology presents quite a challenge
for the virile male firefly: The ratio of
males to females is something like 50-
to-1 (sort of like a fraternity party), sex

ually active fireflies live only one to four
weeks, and the mating period lasts only
10 to 15 minutes per day.(In order to
surmount these obstacles within the
human species, we have "Love Connec
tion.")
But males of the genus Photinus face
an additional challenge. Females of the
genus Photuris are carnivorous and
enjoy feasting on these poor little palpi
tating beetles, who are smaller than the
females and therefore don't cause indi
gestion just before bedtime. The Pho
turis females simply answer the Photi
nus pick-up line as if they were Photi
nus females, luring the male down to
the ground, where his hopes for a hot
night of bioluminescent love are quickly
shattered.
When this phenomenon was first
being researched, biologists were puz
zled. They couldn't figure out how
Photinus males could ever be fooled by
the fake replies, since Photuris lights
are much larger and greener than Phot
inus lights.
Scientists finally concluded that the
reason the males are so easily fooled is
because they're desperate. The males
need to place their bets, and the repro
ductive odds are stacked against them.
(Such sexual desperation is — of
course — found only in the firefly.)
So the next time you're out on a sum
mer night and you see the little blinking
lights hovering over the lawn, realize
that there's serious stuff going on: sex,
deceit and cannibalism. (Not unlike a
French film, really, and much cheaper to
watch.)
