# Med Center plans session to inform about Norplant
## 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
Women who are interested in learning
about Norplant — the first contraceptive
to hit the market since birth control pills
— will be able to do so at an educational
session to be held at the Medical Center
on Friday, May 3.
The session, which will take place in
Fairchild Auditorium at 7:30 p.m., is
being offered by Dr. Leßoy Heinrichs,
professor of gynecology and obstetrics.
Heinrichs is one of three faculty physi
cians at university-affiliated medical
clinics in Northern California trained to
administer Norplant.
In addition to Stanford Clinic, the
gynecology-obstetrics clinics at UC-San
Francisco and UC-Davis have physicians
who have been trained to administer the
new birth control method. The three
physicians were designated by Wyeth-
Ayerst, the company that manufactures
the drug, to lead future training sessions
for other medical professionals.
Heinrichs said that he plans to train a
physician at the Santa Clara Valley Med
ical Center, thereby adding a fourth
clinic that offers the contraceptive to the
region.
Norplant consists of six tiny, flexible
tubes that doctors insert under the skin
of a woman's upper arm during a 15-
minute office procedure. Insertion is
simple enough that only a local anes
thetic is used, and the drug serves as an
effective contraceptive for up to five
years after implantation.

After insertion, the tubes can be
removed at any time — after which the
contraceptive effects are reversed almost
immediately.
"Its effectiveness is equal to steriliza
tion but is completely and promptly
reversible," Heinrichs said.
Norplant works by slowly releasing
levonorgestrel — a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone used in birth con
trol pills — at a steady rate that main
tains blood hormone levels sufficient to
suppress ovulation. The levonorgestrel
also causes the mucus that lines the
cervix to thicken, trapping any sperm
that try to enter the cervical canal.
Norplant's main side effect is irregu
lar bleeding. Other side effects can
include headache, nausea, weight
changes, acne, mood changes, dizziness
and breast tenderness. The contracep
tive is not recommended for women with
acute liver disease, heart disease, breast
cancer or blood clots.
Unlike most oral contraceptives, how
ever, Norplant does not contain estro
gen. In large doses, estrogen has been
linked to an increased risk of gallstones
and blood clots, especially among women
who smoke.
Early studies found that Norplant is
slightly less effective during the fifth
year of use in women who weigh more
than 150 pounds.
Developed by the Population Council
in New York, and then tested overseas,
Norplant was approved by the Federal
Drug Administration just a few months
ago.
