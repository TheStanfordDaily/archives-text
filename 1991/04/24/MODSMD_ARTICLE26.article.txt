# System 7.0 software seems slightly slower
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
me pick up last week's discussion with
a few general observations about System 7.0.
Though you won't be able to buy a copy until
May 13, developers and other select persons
have had their hands on the new baby for
months. Be aware, these thoughts are based
on something called System 7.0b4 — a beta
version of the software. (Although the one
that will be for sale promises to be nearly
identical.)
First of all, I have to note that 7.0 seems to
be slow. I have tested it only on the Macintosh
Ilci and Ilsi — both fast machines — and I
find their performance hampered. Characters
seem to take an extra fraction of a second to
appear when typed; icons get cleaned up at a
snail's pace. I could be crazy, but it really feels
this way. The delay is particularly noticeable
when the display is set to use color.
The likely cause of the slowness is that 7.0
makes use of gray shading in drawing win
dows and icons — a new feature. The result
is a richer display, one more like that of the
NeXT computer. But Apple's gray-shaded
windows and scroll boxes seem a bit like
clunky add-ons. Whereas the integrated look
of the NeXT seems state of the art, Apple
may need to overhaul the Mac look complete
ly before gray scale catches on. The close
boxes and zoom boxes, for instance, look silly
as they currently appear in 7.0.
Anyway, things speed up a great deal
when you go back into monochrome mode,
but then you're stuck without color for any
applications. In all fairness, I must note that
the Ilci and Ilsi have built-in video circuits
that are less speed-efficient than most moni
tor interface cards. They might be particular-

ly susceptible to a perfor
mance hit. Most people with
SEs and SE/30s — which
can't display gray shades any
way — might notice less of a
performance hit.
Then again, they might
not. Another interesting fea
ture of 7.0 is that it includes
the code for what Apple used
to call Desktop Manager. The
wizards in Cupertino invent-

Ed Desktop Manager to address one of the
shortcomings of the Macintosh file system:
When you had thousands of files on a hard
disk, the Mac would choke.
Desktop Manager was shipped with
Apple Share — the venerable file-server soft
ware — and was often used by hacker types
who had big hard disks with lots of goodies.
Desktop Manager prevented the choking, to
be sure, but also slowed some things down,
including opening folders.
In 7.0, you don't need to open folders to
look at them, you simply click on a small
arrow positioned to the left of the folder. The
arrow turns 90 degrees clockwise and the
contents of the folder are displayed below it,
slightly indented in outline form.
Once again, though, I get a nagging feel
ing that it takes too long for the outline list to
appear. Now I realize that I should be factor
ing in the time I used to wait for the window
to open (and maybe subtract it completely for
an accurate computation), but it doesn't
seem quite right.
This points up an interesting problem. As
I work on nothing but fast Macs (the slowest
machine I use is the SE/30), I'm a little out of
touch with the older machines. Every once in
a while, though, I sit down at one of the few

SEs we have left around the
office and am boggled at how
slow it performs. Disk access,
screen redraw, etc. creep
along without the zip I'm
accustomed to.
Because of this, I've become
a performance snob. Nothing
less than a 68030 Mac will do
for me. Many of you probably
feel just the opposite. Sales of
the Classic, a low-cost SE

really, are off the charts. But you all must
wonder whether 7.0 is what you're looking
for. After upgrading your computer's memo
ry to at least two megabytes — and probably
four or five, you'll be ready to run 7.0.
But if your already tortoise-like machines
are slowed any further — bank on the fact
they will be — you may not want 7.0 at all.
System 7.0 gurus should note that we
haven't factored TrueType, which is guaran
teed to cost processing time, into the equa
tions yet.
These last two installments have no doubt
read like a diatribe against System 7.0 to
more than a few of you. So be it. After all the
hype and all the delays, someone needs to
play devil's advocate and ask the fundamen
tal questions.
There are a lot of things to like about Sys
tem 7.0 — and I will share those soon. My
brief acquaintance with it suggests that we'll
be friends for a long time. I await the official
release date with anticipation and excite
ment. By the way — it's only 19 days away.
