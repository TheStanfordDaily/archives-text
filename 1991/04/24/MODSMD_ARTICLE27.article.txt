## Golfers still in third at Pac-10s Conference title seems out of reach as tournament wraps up today 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Yesterday, at the Eugene (Ore.)
Country Club, the Cardinal
women's golf team patterned
itself after the bleak and overcast
sky that loomed overhead on the
second day of the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships.
Trailing front-runner UCLA by
six strokes after the first day of
competition, the Cardinal essen
tially dropped out of the lead pack
when it hit 312, 12 strokes more
than second place Arizona and 16
more than the tournament-lead
ing Bruins.
"We didn't have any individual
standouts," said Audrey Wooding.
"We needed at least one individual
to do well, and that didn't hap
pen.
On Monday, the Cardinal had
three players among the top seven
individuals. Jodi Figley was tied
for second and only three shots off
the lead while Adele Moore and
Audrey Wooding were four and
ftye strokes behind the leader,
respectively.
But yesterday the tables
turned on the Cardinal. Wooding

and Stephanie Davis shot 77 on
the par-72 course to lead Stan
ford. In contrast, UCLA's top four
golfers did not shoot anything
higher than a 75, while Arizona
was not far behind with no women
hitting above 76.
Entering the final day of play,
Arizona, at 602, is the only realis
tic challenger to upend UCLA,
which has shot 596.
"It's a long shot for us to catch
Arizona, not to mention UCLA,"
said Moore. "We'd all have to
make up four or five strokes a
player."
The Cardinal is pinning its
hopes on Moore, its No. I player,
who shot a 78 yesterday to drop
from fifth to sixth overall.
After starting out all right,
Moore double-bogeyed on the
sixth hole to go four over after par.
Then she got it going again but
missed a two-foot put on the 18th
hole.
Nonetheless, she feels really
confident about her swing. "I still
have a shot at Lisa Kiggens," said
Moore. Kiggens, the leading indi
vidual from UCLA, has an eight
shot lead over Moore, who is at
152.

It's a long shot for us
to catch Arizona, not
to mention UCLA.'
— Adele Moore

"I played with her on Monday
and she didn't play that well,"
said Moore.
Wooding, the 20th-ranked
golfer in the nation, is another
mainstay on whom Stanford is
counting. Although she shot a 77
yesterday — two strokes lower
than her performance on Monday,
Wooding climbed up from seventh
to a tie with Moore at sixth.
"Seventy-seven is a good score
especially considering that I
started poorly," said Wooding. She
bogeyed on the first three holes
and hit a double-bogey on the
sixth.
Everything went wrong for
Figley yesterday as she shot a
team-high 81. "My swing just
didn't feel right," she said.
Davis and Martha Richards
were the lone Cardinal players to
improve on their first-day perfor

mances. Both finished with scores
seven shots lower than they
recorded Monday and were among
the top four Cardinal scorers;
Davis drilled a team-best 77, and
Richards stroked an 80.
Despite the increased gap that
third-ranked UCLA and second
ranked Arizona created yesterday,
the No. 6 Cardinal is playing
directly in accordance with its
national ranking.
"We have a stronghold on third
place, which is our ranking,"
Moore said.
At 618 after 36 holes, Stanford
maintains a comfortable eight
stroke lead over its closest compe
tition from behind, 18th-ranked
Arizona State. "There really isn't
another team that deserves to be
third," said Wooding.
But don't rule the Cardinal out
of a second-place showing. "We're
all very competitive," Richards
said. "We need to got out and
shoot a good number tomorrow
and hope that they struggle a bit."
The Cardinal simply cannot
concern itself with anyone behind
or in front of them. "Our goal is to
go out and play the best we can,"
Moore said.
