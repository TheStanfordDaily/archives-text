# Pedals to the medal
## Cyclists successful weekend has them primed for league championships

Hundreds of cyclists race
across campus. Riders collide.
Piles of twisted steel litter the
road. Sound like the Quad on
Monday morning?
Yes, but it was also the scene as
hundreds of collegiate cyclists
converged in the Stanford area for
two days of bicycle racing. The
hometown Cardinal cycling team
rebounded from a third place in
Saturday's criterium to climb to
overall victory in Sunday's hilly
circuit race.
The Cardinal cyclists now sit
fourth in the 25-team strong
Western Collegiate CyclingCpn
ference, with league chfftfpi
onships two weeks away.
Stanford star Becky
glesworth anchored the Cardinal
surge in Sunday's circuit race,
held on the nearby campus of
Canada College. The course was
particularly brutal this year, with
riders completing up to 35 laps of
the 1.2 mile course. Each lap
included a brutal 200-foot vertical
climb.
Wiggles worth and four other
riders shattered the women's "A"
field with an early attack on the
climb. Twenty-three miles later,
Wigglesworth sprinted past a
breakaway companion to take sec
ond, on the heels of the solo win
ner.
"There weren't really any tac
tics involved on such a hard
course," said an exhausted Wig
glesworth. "It basically came
down to who was strongest on the
climb as the race wore on. I'm glad
I had enough left to sprint past
the two Davis women who were
with me."
Cardinal hopes were set on vic
tory as the men's "A" field gath
ered at the start line, thanks to a

tremendous lead built up by
Wigglesworth and her teammates.
In the men's "B" race, Ted
Compton won two mid-race hill
top sprints for points and powered
his way up the final climb to a
hard-fought fourth place finish.
Captain Andy Tucker also scored
in two of the sprints and held on
for ninth in the 25-lap race.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, how
ever, always a force in the top

men's division, lay in second over
all as the men's "A" race rolled off
down the hill.
Only a few laps later, the lead
ing field had been cut to nine rid
ers, with Stanford's Frank Scoscia
and Tim Bradford following the
wheel of the conference's top
point scorer, Santa Barbara's
Erich Cech. But three San Luis
Obispo riders had made the split
as well, and when Bradford fell off

the pace, the race's outcome grew
more tenuous.
Stanford's Brian Sterling
recovered from the torrid pace set
by Cech early on to pace himself
into ninth overall, two places
behind Scoscia. And thanks in
part to Cech, who won all four
hilltop sprints and kept Cal Poly
from adding those points to their
total, Stanford pulled out a gutsy
overall victory.
