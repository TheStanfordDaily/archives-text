# Birch, Graham top latest Volvo rankings
## O'Brien, Stark move up on men's side 
### 
Senior Sandra Birch and junior
Debbie Graham are ranked Nos. 1
and 2 in the latest Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate poll, released yes
terday. On the men's side, junior
Alex O'Brien now holds the No. 4
spot with teammate Jonathan
Stark one place behind.

Birch and Graham were third
and fourth in the last survey. For
mer No. 1 Nicole Arendt slipped to
third, and erstwhile No. 2 dropped
to fourth. Birch defeated Laux
twice in April, although the sec
ond win came after the poll was
conducted.
Stark was not listed on the pre
vious rankings because he was
recovering from a stress fracture
in his foot. O'Brien, meanwhile,
continued to play well atop Stan
ford's lineup, allowing his to jump
four spots from No. 8.
The men's team was ranked
fifth, but that does not take into
account its weekend victories over
No. 1 USC and No. 2 UCLA. The
women hold the No. 2 spot behind
Florida.

Freshman Laxmi Poruri is cur
rently 73rd in the rankings. In
order to make NCAA individual
singles, she will probably have to
crack the top 60.
Poruri has a golden opportuni
ty this Thursday at the Pacific 10
Conference championsips when
she meets seventh-ranked Lisa
Albano.
