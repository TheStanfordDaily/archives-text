# Dutch hackers hit Stanford
## Infiltration has occurred in computers across the country 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
A group of hackers from the
Netherlands has broken into sev
eral computer systems across the
United States, including three
Stanford computers.
When an investigation began
at Stanford, passwords on two of
the Stanford computers were
changed to shut the hackers out,
but the third computer, used for
physics research, was initially
kept open in order to trace the
group's identity.
That computer's password has
now been changed, and police say
the investigation may be at a dead
end.
The physics computer was
"small by Stanford standards,
said William Bauriedel, the infor
mation security officer for the
Stanford Data Center.
He and other officials declined
to give information about the
other two computers that were
accessed and about whether the
hacking did any damage to the

computers or to files.
None of the computers con
tains student grades or tran
scripts.
Bauriedel said the hacker did
not appear to be interested in
other people's research. He added
that he knew of two other univer
sities which had experienced simi
lar problems, but would not spec
ify which ones.
In addition to those at Stan
ford, computers at the Pentagon's
Pacific Fleet Command, the
Kennedy Space Center and the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory nuclear research facil
ity were penetrated.
Sunday editions of The New
York Times reported that three or
four Dutch hackers have been
breaking into U.S. computers over
the past six months. Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said
he thinks one member of the
group has been looking in Stan
ford's computer files since about
January.
With the changing of the pass
words, "We've effectively blocked

him out of our systems at this
time," Niemeyer said.
Bauriedel said his department
has a "very strong suspicion who
it is," but is not 100-percent sure.
Even so, Niemeyer said it will
be difficult to proceed further.
"We have an idea who it is, but
there's no way to actually trap
them on line."
Working with the FBI, the
Stanford Police obtained a search
warrant from the District Attor
ney's office to trap the lines, a pro
cess which indicates where calls
are coming from.
Niemeyer said the police trace
the hacker out of the country, but
"that's the end of it." The process
involves several phone calls and
several different tracing
machines, and the hacker gets oft
the line before the telephone com
pany and the police can find his
exact whereabouts.
Because the search warrant
has expired and the hacker is no
longer able to get into the Stan
ford systems, the police depart
ment has "basically inactivated
the case," Niemeyer said.
Although hacking is a state and
federal felony in the United
States, there is no law against
computer intrusion in the Nether
lands. However, the Justice Min
istry of the Netherlands said it
expects Parliament to pass a law
this year forbidding unauthorized
entry into computer systems, the
Associated Press reported.
Stephen Hansen, director of
Stanford's electrical engineering
computer facility, said people
probe into Stanford's computer
systems all the time.

The University decided to take
action on this hacker because he
was "very persistent and doing
things he shouldn't be doing,"
Bauriedel said. "It was over and
above just breaking into accounts
We felt it was our responsibility W
the rest of the computer commii'J
nity" to do something about it, he
explained.
Maarten Rook, the director of
economics and personnel at
Utrecht University in the Nether
lands, told the Associated Press
that hacking is encouraged. In
fact, the Delft University of Tech
nology offered a course in com
puter hacking several years ago.
"In our teaching system we try
to endorse exploration and make
our students enthusiastic about
it," Rook said.
