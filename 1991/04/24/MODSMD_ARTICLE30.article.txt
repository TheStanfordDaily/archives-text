# Rocket blasts off on flight to oblivion
## 
### 
So long. Farewell. See you
in four years. Maybe . . .
So The Rocket is gone,
leaving behind a trail of frus
trated general managers and
disbelieving kids, who will
never get to see their could
have-been idol gracing a
Wheaties box.
Raghib "Rocket" Ismail
duped his fans, made a genius
out of the Patriots and neatly
avoided the experts who said he
couldn't make it in the NFL —
by pulling the last minute
league-jump.
If it isn't the USFL it's the
CFL, luring top collegiate tal
ent with fat contracts and so
many promises.
The CFL? As in Canadian
Football League?
Isn't that the league for
Division I guys who don't quite
cut it (i.e. aren't drafted), Divi
sion II standouts and Canadi
ans who can't play hockey?
Why would any talented
player want to take part in the
wild wonders of football in
Canada?
Okay, so they offered young
Rocket, the junior "hardship"
player, a heck of a lot of money.
He did leave Notre Dame early
because he wanted to provide
for his family — or something
like that.
Eighteen million dollars —
plus incentives, plus a house in
Los Angeles plus a shopping
spree in Beverly Hills — should
be quite adequate to keep the
Ismail family going for some
time.
But it's not like he was
going to be starving in the
NFL. The Rocket was going to
be the No. 1 pick, and these
days the sky's the limit to what
No. Is can demand. The New
England Patriots had already
offered $1.7 million a year, and
he probably would have gotten
much more.
So what's the hitch? Why
give up the security of the NFL
— and possible stardom — for
a extra couple of million (what
do you do with even two mil
during a year?) anH Toronto?
Stage Fright?
Maybe, just maybe, The
Rocket — after all the hype,
hoopla and coverage — was
afraid he wouldn't make it, or
make it big, on the gridirons of
America.
He had a great college
career. Many amazing run
backs. Some great catches.
Helped Notre Dame — the
birthplace of football legends
— pull out a few of their unbe
lievable comebacks. Almost
gave the Fighting Irish one of
the greatest moments in col
lege football history at the
Orange Bowl this past Jan. 1
(but his last-second touchdown
was called back for clipping).
But despite all the heroics —
and teams knocking each other
out to get him — his greatness
is primarily as a returner. And
kick returns do not stardom
make.
At 5-foot-10, 175 pounds,
The Rocket is small for wide
receiver. He was not even one

of the top receivers in the draft.
Few pro scouts think he could
start at flanker in the NFL
next year.
He is a great returner — 15
touchdowns in three years for
the Irish. But NFL kickers are
a whole different ballgame
from their collegiate counter
parts. Most can get the ball out
of the end zone, or away from
breakaway threats like Ismail.
Plus, there are a many special
teamers who have the ability to

clobber The Rocket before he
zooms into their end zone.
Ismail left many to draw the
conclusion that, management
team preparing his advertising
future and all, he decided to
take the money and dash for
the less-scrutinizing confines
of America's northern neigh
bor.
Another Superhero down
the drain. So much for
Sports Illustrated's pre
diction of The Rocket as the
the next sports Megastar.
There go the Launch-pad
Cross Trainers, Rocket work
out clothes and Blast Off power
bars.
Might as well get rid of
Team Rocket — Ismail's 100-
person or so "advising and
strategy" group. No need for
the endorsement specialists,
accountants and litigators now.
Canada is just not the market
ing paradise.
In fact, after this week's
front page stories (more for the
fact that Ismail shattered the
CFL's team salary cap all by
himself then for his defection),
and a couple during the first
week of the season, Rocket's
publicity is officially over, gone,
dead. Definitely in the United
States, but also in Canada,
where hype is not the name of
the game like in the good ol'
U(television) S( television) of A.
You blew it Rocket. You
could have been the best thing
to hit the American market
since Air Jordans.
You were a household name
as a college junior, clean-cut,
well-mannered, personable and
studious. Promoters were
drooling.
Even if you didn't make it as
the next Jerry Rice, or even the
new Billy "White Shoes" John
son, the advertising money was
yours. You could have pulled a
Brian Bo'sworth and signed all
the deals before you flopped,
and just sat back and counted
the cash flow.
But it's all gone now.
Have fun in Canada.
We'll just be sitting back and
waiting for the real next
Michael Jordan to come along.

U(television) S( television) of A.
You blew it Rocket. You
could have been the best thing
to hit the American market
since Air Jordans.
You were a household name
as a college junior, clean-cut,
well-mannered, personable and
studious. Promoters were
drooling.
Even if you didn't make it as
the next Jerry Rice, or even the
new Billy "White Shoes" John

yours. You could have pulled a
Brian Bo'sworth and signed all

and just sat back and counted
the cash flow.
But it's all gone now.
Have fun in Canada.
We'll just be sitting back and
waiting for the real next
Michael Jordan to come along.

So long. Farewell. See you
in four years. Maybe . . .
So The Rocket is gone,
leaving behind a trail of frus
trated general managers and
disbelieving kids, who will
never get to see their could
have-been idol gracing a
Wheaties box.
Raghib "Rocket" Ismail
duped his fans, made a genius
out of the Patriots and neatly
avoided the experts who said he
couldn't make it in the NFL —
by pulling the last minute
league-jump.
If it isn't the USFL it's the
CFL, luring top collegiate tal
ent with fat contracts and so
many promises.
The CFL? As in Canadian
Football League?
Isn't that the league for
Division I guys who don't quite
cut it (i.e. aren't drafted), Divi
sion II standouts and Canadi
ans who can't play hockey?
Why would any talented
player want to take part in the
wild wonders of football in
Canada?
Okay, so they offered young
Rocket, the junior "hardship"
player, a heck of a lot of money.
He did leave Notre Dame early
because he wanted to provide
for his family — or something
like that.
Eighteen million dollars —
plus incentives, plus a house in
Los Angeles plus a shopping
spree in Beverly Hills — should
be quite adequate to keep the
Ismail family going for some
time.
But it's not like he was
going to be starving in the
NFL. The Rocket was going to
be the No. 1 pick, and these
days the sky's the limit to what
No. Is can demand. The New
England Patriots had already
offered $1.7 million a year, and
he probably would have gotten
much more.
So what's the hitch? Why
give up the security of the NFL
— and possible stardom — for
a extra couple of million (what
do you do with even two mil
during a year?) anH Toronto?
Stage Fright?
Maybe, just maybe, The
Rocket — after all the hype,
hoopla and coverage — was
afraid he wouldn't make it, or
make it big, on the gridirons of
America.
He had a great college
career. Many amazing run
backs. Some great catches.
Helped Notre Dame — the
birthplace of football legends
— pull out a few of their unbe
lievable comebacks. Almost
gave the Fighting Irish one of
the greatest moments in col
lege football history at the
Orange Bowl this past Jan. 1
(but his last-second touchdown
was called back for clipping).
But despite all the heroics —
and teams knocking each other
out to get him — his greatness
is primarily as a returner. And
kick returns do not stardom
make.
At 5-foot-10, 175 pounds,
The Rocket is small for wide
receiver. He was not even one

of the top receivers in the draft.
Few pro scouts think he could
start at flanker in the NFL
next year.
He is a great returner — 15
touchdowns in three years for
the Irish. But NFL kickers are
a whole different ballgame
from their collegiate counter
parts. Most can get the ball out
of the end zone, or away from
breakaway threats like Ismail.
Plus, there are a many special
teamers who have the ability to

clobber The Rocket before he
zooms into their end zone.
Ismail left many to draw the
conclusion that, management
team preparing his advertising
future and all, he decided to
take the money and dash for
the less-scrutinizing confines
of America's northern neigh
bor.
Another Superhero down
the drain. So much for
Sports Illustrated's pre
diction of The Rocket as the
the next sports Megastar.
There go the Launch-pad
Cross Trainers, Rocket work
out clothes and Blast Off power
bars.
Might as well get rid of
Team Rocket — Ismail's 100-
person or so "advising and
strategy" group. No need for
the endorsement specialists,
accountants and litigators now.
Canada is just not the market
ing paradise.
In fact, after this week's
front page stories (more for the
fact that Ismail shattered the
CFL's team salary cap all by
himself then for his defection),
and a couple during the first
week of the season, Rocket's
publicity is officially over, gone,
dead. Definitely in the United
States, but also in Canada,
where hype is not the name of
the game like in the good ol'
U(television) S( television) of A.
You blew it Rocket. You
could have been the best thing
to hit the American market
since Air Jordans.
You were a household name
as a college junior, clean-cut,
well-mannered, personable and
studious. Promoters were

new Billy "White Shoes" John
son, the advertising money was
yours. You could have pulled a
Brian Bo'sworth and signed all
the deals before you flopped,

the cash flow.
But it's all gone now.
Have fun in Canada.
