# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Late April means a lot of things to a lot of
people. For the score of athletes who play
tennis at Stanford, however, it means just
one things: NCAAs are approaching.
Both the men and women seem to have
cornered the market on national crowns. If
the men win this year it'll be four in a row;
the women seek an unbelievable six straight.
To get there, each squad needs its No. 1

singles player to lead the way. Over the past
weekend, Sandra Birch and Alex O'Brien
did just that. For their efforts, The Daily
names them Athletes of the Week.
Birch, a 5-foot-6 senior from Huntington
Bay, N.Y., and the women's team spent the
weekend in Los Angeles cleaning up on USC
and UCLA.
Friday, against the once-mighty-but-now
mediocre Trojans, Birch faced USC's only
remaining blue chipper: Trisha Laux. Once
upon a time, Birch couldn't beat the 5-2
rocket launcher; this time Laux didn't have a
prayer. Birch lost just one game.
She followed up that performance Satur
day when Stanford faced the Bruins. UCLA,
which has been juggling its lineup all season,
sent out Stella Sampras (older sister of U.S.
Open champ Pete) against Birch. Last time,
Bruin coach Bill Zaima tried Iwalani McCalla
and Birch shot her down.
The result against Sampras was no differ
ent as the Cardinal Ail-American brought
home a 6-4, 6-2 victory. But Stanford didn't
clinch the match in singles against UCLA.
So, with the doubles meaningful, Birch
teamed with Debbie Graham to knock off
Sampras and partner Kim Po 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.

O'Brien, a 6-1 junior from Amarillo,
Texas, wanted to help the Cardinal avenge
its dual defeats to the Trojans and Bruins,
suffered in early April. He played big — and
so did the rest of the team — as Stanford
thrashed both opponents on the weekend.
Facing USC's Byron Black at No. 1 Fri

day, O'Brien moved ahead 4-1 in the first set
before slipping slightly. He pulled out the
first set in a tiebreaker, though, and went on
to win the second by a score of 6-3. The Car
dinal took the match 5-1, handing USC its
first confernce loss of the season.
Saturday, O'Brien was again the man at
the top. UCLA's Mark Knowles succumbed
6-4, 6-4 as Stanford rolled once again, 6-1.
