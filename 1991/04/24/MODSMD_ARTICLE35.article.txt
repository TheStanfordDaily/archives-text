# Alcohol incident under investigation
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
University administrators and
the Intersorority Council are con
sidering action in response to the
brief hospitalization of a fresh
man Delta Delta Delta sorority
pledge after a bid-acceptance
party last Wednesday.
The woman was taken to Stan
ford Hospital early Thursday
morning because she had vomited
and passed out, according to
sorority members. Several Tri-
Delts were concerned that she
may have been drinking too heav
ily and took her to the hospital,
members said.
Although she did not have alco

hoi poisoning and required no
medical treatment, she slept the
remainder of the night in the hos
pital and returned to her dormi
tory the next morning. A Stanford
Hospital nurse said the Tri-Delts
responded appropriately by bring
ing the woman to the hospital.
"Regardless of any probation
or punishment that may result,
we place the health of our mem
bers ahead of any of those consid
erations," said sorority president
Heather Strom. "We would rather
have [negative publicity] than
have someone be hurt," she said.
Administrators in the Office of
Student Activities began an inves
tigation into the incident yester
day. Their analysis will consider

the University's new alcohol pol
icy, said sorority adviser Allison
Sandy.
"The University will look into
it as with any questionable inci
dent," Sandy said. "We have no
plans at all [to take] any disci
plinary action prior to an investi
gation."
In the past, administrators
have placed fraternities and
sororities on social probation or
suspension while alcohol-related
incidents were under investiga
tion.
ISC officers, including a repre
sentative from each campus soror
ity, will also meet today to discuss
the issue.
