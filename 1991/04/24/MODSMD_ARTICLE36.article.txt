CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -
MIT said yesterday it will repay
$731,000 to the federal govern
ment after an internal review
found it billed taxpayers for din
ner meetings, receptions and flow
ers for the president's house.
MIT said catering, food, alco
hol, chair rentals, gifts, a trip to
Barbados, the printing of official
programs and other expenses
were billed to the government in
the last five years.
The disclosure comes as federal
investigators zero in on the
expenses charged by universities
and colleges that receive U.S.
research grants.
In a prepared statement, MIT

said it had been conducting an
ongoing review of indirect costs
that were charged to the govern
ment.
University officials said MIT
would withdraw an average of
$146,000 per year in indirect
expenses for each year from 1986
to 1990.
Some of the money was used
for a $13,751 reception for the
MIT board of trustees, a trip to
Barbados that university officials
said was used to negotiate insur
ance contracts and $10,000 worth
of gifts and memorabilia.
MIT already repaid $27,317 in
taxpayer money it used to pay a
law firm that lobbied Congress.
