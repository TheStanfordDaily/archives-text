# Issues more important to Reges than computers
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
By openly violating Stanford's drug policy, Stuart
Reges thrust himself into the national spotlight.
But the computer science senior lecturer — who
was placed on paid administrative leave Friday pend
ing an investigation — is no stranger to taking risks.
A vocal proponent of personal freedom, Reges also
speaks out against U.S. military intervention and
what he sees as a growing atmosphere of anti-intel
lectualism at Stanford.
He acknowledges his views about the latter may
be shaped by his age. "I can't imagine a more fun
experience than reading books" such as the ones stu
dents reluctantly study in Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues, he said.
Reges, one of the most prominent gay faculty
members, said he maintains some involvement in
Stanford's gay community, even though he some
times has "friendly debates" with the more "politi
cal" members of the community.
"At least once a year I try to make clear in one of
my articles that I'm gay," he said. "It's important for
young gay people to have role models."
Discussing his drug experiences, Reges waxed
philosophic. "All experience is good. ... All experi
ence increases knowledge," he said. "My drug experi
ences have been some of the most important in my
spiritual and intellectual development."
He said Thoreau's question in "Walden" — "Why
do people lead mundane lives that have been lived
before?" — has influenced the decisions he has
made. "I feel I've hardly begun {to explore what life
has to offerl — there's so much to do," he said.
A northern Virginia native, Reges majored in
mathematics at Case Western Reserve University
and attended graduate school at Stanford in 1979 as
a National Science Foundation Fellow.
Reges revamped much of the Computer Science
Department after he started teaching as a graduate
student in 1980. In the process he became one of
Stanford's most popular instructors.
He was asked by the associate department chair
to become the introductory course coordinator, and

later he became the assistant chair of education for
the department.
In 1984, along with graduate student Michael
Chao, Reges created Computer Science 001 C, an
introductory computer course taught by resident
computer coordinators. Reges also redesigned Com
puter Science 105 A, an introductory course, and cre
ated the Computer Science 106 A and 1068 track.
In another innovation, Reges created Computer
Science 198, "Teaching of Computer Science," which

trains undergraduates to be section leaders in Com
puter Science 106. Previously, there were no discus
sion sections for computer science courses, and only
graduate students could become teaching assistants.
Students generally acknowledge that the work
load in Reges' classes can be heavy. In the Tau Beta
Pi engineering society's spring course guide, one stu
dent said Reges' CSIO6 class was "the hardest in

terms of workload, but one of the
best taught at Stanford."
In 1985, Reges' efforts were
recognized when he was awarded
the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Undergraduate
Education. The award noted
Reges' use of undergraduate TAs
and his efforts in integrating com
puters into dormitories.
The award also highlighted
"the steady stream of innovation
he has brought to teaching and to
computer use in classrooms and
advising" and"the valuable pri
vate time he steadily provides to
others, not only as a general advi
sor but as a counselor at the
Bridge."
The award was followed in
1986 by the School of Engineering
Distinguished Advisor Award for
his dedication to the University
and the school's advising pro
grams and "for his genuine con
cern for the academic and per
sonal lives of his advisees."
Graduate student Mehran
Sahami, one of Reges' advisees,
praised Reges' knowledge of the
field and said he is "very aware of
student needs."
In 1987, Reges created the

undergraduate computer science
major. "The strength of the
undergraduate program is in
large part due to Stuart," accord
ing to Assoc. Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts.
But Reges said his assistant
chair position was "highly
demanding," so he decided to
leave the University. Reges spent
five months with Next Inc., a com
puter company, and realized that
he did not belong in industry, he
said.
Before returning to the Uni
versity in 1988, Reges spent some
time "reading, relaxing and think
ing." He said he decided to return
as a full-time lecturer because he
"loves teaching" and did not want
to be required to spend any time
on research.
Many students interviewed
called Reges the best instructor
they ever had. Sophomore Peter
Edmonston said that Reges is
"charismatic and candid" and
that many students use his class
as a standard against which they
measure others.
Andy Anagnost, a graduate
student, said Reges' interest in
the students is rare at a research
university and noted that Reges'
informal teaching style relies
heavily on metaphors and analo
gies.

Senior Seung Choi, who was a
section leader for Reges' Com
puter Science 106 X class, praised
Reges' teaching style but said
Reges "plays up to smarter people
in the class and often neglects the
slower students."
Choi added that Reges' person
ality can be "cold from a distance"
but warms up in one-on-one inter
action.
Reges, whose piercing eyes rest
behind a friendly demeanor, said
even though he is good with com
puters he is not necessarily inter
ested in them. "I don't enjoy pro
gramming much," he said, noting
he is more interested by people,
history, literature and political
issues.
Reges' favorite author is little
known political essayist Lysander
Spooner, who Reges said shares
similar views on government and
personal freedom. Reges said he
also enjoys also some of the writ
ings of Jefferson and Nietzsche.
Reges said he's not sure what
the next two years hold in store,
but believes he did the right thing
by bringing important issues into
the spotlight. He therefore wel
comes the intense media scrutiny,
but noted he hopes "it will stay
focused on the real issues" of free
speech and personal liberty.

section leader for Reges' Com
puter Science 106 X class, praised
Reges' teaching style but said
Reges "plays up to smarter people
in the class and often neglects the
slower students."
Choi added that Reges' person
ality can be "cold from a distance"
but warms up in one-on-one inter
action.
Reges, whose piercing eyes rest
behind a friendly demeanor, said
even though he is good with com
puters he is not necessarily inter
ested in them. "I don't enjoy pro
gramming much," he said, noting
he is more interested by people,
history, literature and political
issues.
Reges' favorite author is little
known political essayist Lysander
Spooner, who Reges said shares
similar views on government and
personal freedom. Reges said he
also enjoys also some of the writ
ings of Jefferson and Nietzsche.
Reges said he's not sure what
the next two years hold in store,
but believes he did the right thing
by bringing important issues into
the spotlight. He therefore wel
comes the intense media scrutiny,
but noted he hopes "it will stay
focused on the real issues" of free
speech and personal liberty.
By openly violating Stanford's drug policy, Stuart
Reges thrust himself into the national spotlight.
But the computer science senior lecturer — who
was placed on paid administrative leave Friday pend
ing an investigation — is no stranger to taking risks.
A vocal proponent of personal freedom, Reges also
speaks out against U.S. military intervention and
what he sees as a growing atmosphere of anti-intel
lectualism at Stanford.
He acknowledges his views about the latter may
be shaped by his age. "I can't imagine a more fun
experience than reading books" such as the ones stu
dents reluctantly study in Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues, he said.
Reges, one of the most prominent gay faculty
members, said he maintains some involvement in
Stanford's gay community, even though he some
times has "friendly debates" with the more "politi
cal" members of the community.
"At least once a year I try to make clear in one of
my articles that I'm gay," he said. "It's important for
young gay people to have role models."
Discussing his drug experiences, Reges waxed
philosophic. "All experience is good. ... All experi
ence increases knowledge," he said. "My drug experi
ences have been some of the most important in my
spiritual and intellectual development."
He said Thoreau's question in "Walden" — "Why
do people lead mundane lives that have been lived
before?" — has influenced the decisions he has
made. "I feel I've hardly begun {to explore what life
has to offerl — there's so much to do," he said.
A northern Virginia native, Reges majored in
mathematics at Case Western Reserve University
and attended graduate school at Stanford in 1979 as
a National Science Foundation Fellow.
Reges revamped much of the Computer Science
Department after he started teaching as a graduate
student in 1980. In the process he became one of
Stanford's most popular instructors.
He was asked by the associate department chair
to become the introductory course coordinator, and

later he became the assistant chair of education for
the department.
In 1984, along with graduate student Michael
Chao, Reges created Computer Science 001 C, an
introductory computer course taught by resident
computer coordinators. Reges also redesigned Com
puter Science 105 A, an introductory course, and cre
ated the Computer Science 106 A and 1068 track.
In another innovation, Reges created Computer
Science 198, "Teaching of Computer Science," which

trains undergraduates to be section leaders in Com
puter Science 106. Previously, there were no discus
sion sections for computer science courses, and only
graduate students could become teaching assistants.
Students generally acknowledge that the work
load in Reges' classes can be heavy. In the Tau Beta
Pi engineering society's spring course guide, one stu
dent said Reges' CSIO6 class was "the hardest in

terms of workload, but one of the
best taught at Stanford."
In 1985, Reges' efforts were
recognized when he was awarded
the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award
for Outstanding Undergraduate
Education. The award noted
Reges' use of undergraduate TAs
and his efforts in integrating com
puters into dormitories.
The award also highlighted
"the steady stream of innovation
he has brought to teaching and to
computer use in classrooms and
advising" and"the valuable pri
vate time he steadily provides to
others, not only as a general advi
sor but as a counselor at the
Bridge."
The award was followed in
1986 by the School of Engineering
Distinguished Advisor Award for
his dedication to the University
and the school's advising pro
grams and "for his genuine con
cern for the academic and per
sonal lives of his advisees."
Graduate student Mehran
Sahami, one of Reges' advisees,
praised Reges' knowledge of the
field and said he is "very aware of
student needs."
In 1987, Reges created the

undergraduate computer science
major. "The strength of the
undergraduate program is in
large part due to Stuart," accord
ing to Assoc. Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts.
But Reges said his assistant
chair position was "highly
demanding," so he decided to
leave the University. Reges spent
five months with Next Inc., a com
puter company, and realized that
he did not belong in industry, he
said.
Before returning to the Uni
versity in 1988, Reges spent some
time "reading, relaxing and think
ing." He said he decided to return
as a full-time lecturer because he
"loves teaching" and did not want
to be required to spend any time
on research.
Many students interviewed
called Reges the best instructor
they ever had. Sophomore Peter
Edmonston said that Reges is
"charismatic and candid" and
that many students use his class
as a standard against which they
measure others.
Andy Anagnost, a graduate
student, said Reges' interest in
the students is rare at a research
university and noted that Reges'
informal teaching style relies
heavily on metaphors and analo
gies.
