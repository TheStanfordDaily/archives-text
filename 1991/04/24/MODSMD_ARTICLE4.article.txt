# Issues more important to Reges than computers

### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
By openly violating Stanford's drug policy, Stuart
Reges thrust himself into the national spotlight.
But the computer science senior lecturer — who
was placed on paid administrative leave Friday pend
ing an investigation — is no stranger to taking risks.
A vocal proponent of personal freedom, Reges also
speaks out against U.S. military intervention and
what he sees as a growing atmosphere of anti-intel
lectualism at Stanford.
He acknowledges his views about the latter may
be shaped by his age. "I can't imagine a more fun
experience than reading books" such as the ones stu
dents reluctantly study in Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues, he said.
Reges, one of the most prominent gay faculty
members, said he maintains some involvement in
Stanford's gay community, even though he some
times has "friendly debates" with the more "politi
cal" members of the community.
"At least once a year I try to make clear in one of
my articles that I'm gay," he said. "It's important for
young gay people to have role models."
Discussing his drug experiences, Reges waxed
philosophic. "All experience is good. ... All experi
ence increases knowledge," he said. "My drug experi
ences have been some of the most important in my
spiritual and intellectual development."
He said Thoreau's question in "Walden" — "Why
do people lead mundane lives that have been lived
before?" — has influenced the decisions he has
made. "I feel I've hardly begun {to explore what life
has to offerl — there's so much to do," he said.
A northern Virginia native, Reges majored in
mathematics at Case Western Reserve University
and attended graduate school at Stanford in 1979 as
a National Science Foundation Fellow.
Reges revamped much of the Computer Science
Department after he started teaching as a graduate
student in 1980. In the process he became one of
Stanford's most popular instructors.
He was asked by the associate department chair
to become the introductory course coordinator, and

later he became the assistant chair of education for
the department.
In 1984, along with graduate student Michael
Chao, Reges created Computer Science 001 C, an
introductory computer course taught by resident
computer coordinators. Reges also redesigned Com
puter Science 105 A, an introductory course, and cre
ated the Computer Science 106 A and 1068 track.
In another innovation, Reges created Computer
Science 198, "Teaching of Computer Science," which

trains undergraduates to be section leaders in Com
puter Science 106. Previously, there were no discus
sion sections for computer science courses, and only
graduate students could become teaching assistants.
Students generally acknowledge that the work
load in Reges' classes can be heavy. In the Tau Beta
Pi engineering society's spring course guide, one stu
dent said Reges' CSIO6 class was "the hardest in

Stuart Reges, placed on leave from lecturing in the Computer Science Department, fields phone calls
requesting Interviews and Information about his situation at Stanford. Reges will be featured on the
"CBS Evening News" tomorrow and will speak on an Austin, Texas radio show.
