# House subcommittee chair:
## Bad cost rules part of problem 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Outdated and "poorly defined"
federal rules are as much to blame
for the controversy over Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices as is
the University, Rep. Rick Boucher,
D-Va., indicated in a congressional
hearing yesterday.
Boucher is the chair of the
House Science Subcommittee,
which is holding hearings this
week to determine if new legisla
tion is needed on how universities
are reimbursed for indirect costs
of federally sponsored research.
Last month, Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices were the sub
ject of a grueling one-day hearing
in front of the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. The widely publi
cized proceedings, which focused
heavily on individual questionable
charges like flower arrangements,
antiques and receptions, caught
the attention of Boucher's sub
committee.
"There has been some abuse of
the system by universities,"
Boucher said in a telephone inter
view yesterday, "but the real prob
lem is larger and less obvious than
that."
Some of Boucher's harshest
criticism was directed at the
Office of Management and Bud
get, the administrative agency
responsible for formulating rules
on indirect costs.
"OMB's activities in regulating
the indirect cost recovery system
has been characterized by inatten
tion and are largely responsible
for the misinterpretation and con
fusion about what costs are prop
erly allowable," he said.
On Tuesday, OMB Director
Richard Darman proposed a laun
dry list of expense categories that
he feels should be made explicitly
unallowable in Circular A-21, the
rules governing cost-recovery at
educational institutions. Dar
man's suggestions include enter
tainment costs, country-club
memberships, promotional adver
tising and expenses related to
housing of university administra

tors.
But Boucher said he was not
satisfied with Darman's offering.
"It sort of gives you a blinding
glimpse of the obvious," Boucher
said.
According to Boucher, the pro
posed revisions incorporate into
A-21 a list of costs that should
have been included in 1985 when
Congress ruled such expenses
could not be placed in the over
head claims of commercial defense
contractors.
A statement issued by Darman
on Tuesday indicated that his
office was considering broader
reforms, including possible
changes affecting how much uni
versities are allowed to charge for
administrative, facilities and
equipment expenses — some of
the most costly components of
indirect-cost recovery.
A Darman aide confirmed
yesterday that more revisions
were on the horizon, but said no
time table had been set for their
release.
The New York Times reported
yesterday that the Bush Adminis
tration was considering imposing
an overall cap on indirect cost
rates — a move that would likely
cost Stanford millions of dollars in
recovery annually. The Darman
aide said she had no knowledge of
such a proposal.
Darman had been scheduled to
testify before the subcommittee
yesterday, but canceled late on
Monday.

Darman's absence, Boucher
said, "reflects the lack of priority
OMB has assigned to this matter.
I hope its absence does not reflect
an unwillingness to work with the
Congress to bring about reform."
If OMB's upcoming reform
proposals are adequate, Boucher
said, new legislation may not be
necessary. "Either way," he said,
"we'll accomplish our objective."
While many references were
made to the situation at Stanford
in yesterday's hearing, there were
no Stanford administrators on the
witness list. Larry Horton, associ
ate vice president for public
affairs, did attend, however.
Horton called the proceedings
"a model hearing."
"All the members seemed to be

genuinely interested in formulat
ing good research policy," Horton
said.
Stanford was on the receiving
end of a great deal of criticism,
however. Boucher's opening state
ment contained references to the
depreciation on the yacht Victoria
and administrative costs of the
Stanford Shopping Center, both of
which were incorrectly charged in
part to the government as indirect
costs of research.
And a representative of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency
repeated earlier accusations that
Stanford is not cooperating with
the agency's effort to audit the
University's past cost claims.
Boucher said he found that
charge disconcerting.
University officials have con

ceded that, in some cases, they are
taking longer than desirable to
respond to auditors' inquiries.
The delay, according to Stanford
administrators, is due to the enor
mous number of requests being
made by a few dozen auditors and
investigators.
The Boucher hearing will
resume Thursday with several
experts recommending indirect
cost policy reforms.
Among those testifying will be
David Packard, former president
of the Stanford Board of Trustees
and a large donor to the Univer
sity. In 1986 Packer chaired a
White House Science Panel that
recommended several systemic
reforms of indirect-cost policies
that were never followed up on.

posed revisions incorporate into
A-21 a list of costs that should
have been included in 1985 when
Congress ruled such expenses
could not be placed in the over
head claims of commercial defense
contractors.
A statement issued by Darman
on Tuesday indicated that his
office was considering broader
reforms, including possible
changes affecting how much uni
versities are allowed to charge for
administrative, facilities and
equipment expenses — some of
the most costly components of
indirect-cost recovery.
A Darman aide confirmed
yesterday that more revisions
were on the horizon, but said no
time table had been set for their
release.
The New York Times reported
yesterday that the Bush Adminis
tration was considering imposing
an overall cap on indirect cost
rates — a move that would likely
cost Stanford millions of dollars in
recovery annually. The Darman
aide said she had no knowledge of
such a proposal.
Darman had been scheduled to
testify before the subcommittee
yesterday, but canceled late on
Monday.

Darman's absence, Boucher
said, "reflects the lack of priority
OMB has assigned to this matter.
I hope its absence does not reflect
an unwillingness to work with the
Congress to bring about reform."
If OMB's upcoming reform
proposals are adequate, Boucher
said, new legislation may not be
necessary. "Either way," he said,
"we'll accomplish our objective."
While many references were
made to the situation at Stanford
in yesterday's hearing, there were
no Stanford administrators on the
witness list. Larry Horton, associ
ate vice president for public
affairs, did attend, however.
Horton called the proceedings
"a model hearing."
"All the members seemed to be

genuinely interested in formulat
ing good research policy," Horton
said.
Stanford was on the receiving
end of a great deal of criticism,
however. Boucher's opening state
ment contained references to the
depreciation on the yacht Victoria
and administrative costs of the
Stanford Shopping Center, both of
which were incorrectly charged in
part to the government as indirect
costs of research.
And a representative of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency
repeated earlier accusations that
Stanford is not cooperating with
the agency's effort to audit the
University's past cost claims.
Boucher said he found that
charge disconcerting.
University officials have con

ceded that, in some cases, they are
taking longer than desirable to
respond to auditors' inquiries.
The delay, according to Stanford
administrators, is due to the enor
mous number of requests being
made by a few dozen auditors and
investigators.
The Boucher hearing will
resume Thursday with several
experts recommending indirect
cost policy reforms.
Among those testifying will be
David Packard, former president
of the Stanford Board of Trustees
and a large donor to the Univer
sity. In 1986 Packer chaired a
White House Science Panel that
recommended several systemic
reforms of indirect-cost policies
that were never followed up on.
