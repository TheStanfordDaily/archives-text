# House subcommittee chair:
## Bad cost rules part of problem 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Outdated and "poorly defined"
federal rules are as much to blame
for the controversy over Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices as is
the University, Rep. Rick Boucher,
D-Va., indicated in a congressional
hearing yesterday.
Boucher is the chair of the
House Science Subcommittee,
which is holding hearings this
week to determine if new legisla
tion is needed on how universities
are reimbursed for indirect costs
of federally sponsored research.
Last month, Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices were the sub
ject of a grueling one-day hearing
in front of the House Subcommit
tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. The widely publi
cized proceedings, which focused
heavily on individual questionable
charges like flower arrangements,
antiques and receptions, caught
the attention of Boucher's sub
committee.
"There has been some abuse of
the system by universities,"
Boucher said in a telephone inter
view yesterday, "but the real prob
lem is larger and less obvious than
that."
Some of Boucher's harshest
criticism was directed at the
Office of Management and Bud
get, the administrative agency
responsible for formulating rules
on indirect costs.
"OMB's activities in regulating
the indirect cost recovery system
has been characterized by inatten
tion and are largely responsible
for the misinterpretation and con
fusion about what costs are prop
erly allowable," he said.
On Tuesday, OMB Director
Richard Darman proposed a laun
dry list of expense categories that
he feels should be made explicitly
unallowable in Circular A-21, the
rules governing cost-recovery at
educational institutions. Dar
man's suggestions include enter
tainment costs, country-club
memberships, promotional adver
tising and expenses related to
housing of university administra

tors.
But Boucher said he was not
satisfied with Darman's offering.
"It sort of gives you a blinding
glimpse of the obvious," Boucher
said.
According to Boucher, the pro
posed revisions incorporate into
A-21 a list of costs that should
have been included in 1985 when
Congress ruled such expenses
could not be placed in the over
head claims of commercial defense
contractors.
A statement issued by Darman
on Tuesday indicated that his
office was considering broader
reforms, including possible
changes affecting how much uni
versities are allowed to charge for
administrative, facilities and
equipment expenses â€” some of
the most costly components of
indirect-cost recovery.
