# Palo Alto will soon get XTV
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
XTV, the Stanford student television sta
tion, has announced that it will expand its
activities beyond campus and begin broadcasts
to Palo Alto audiences.
In an agreement completed last week with
the Mid-Peninsula Access Corporation, a pub
lic-access television station, XTV has agreed to
provide programming for a time slot on Satur
day from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Broadcasts will begin
on cable channel 6 May 4.
Dave Holland, XTV station manager,
expressed enthusiasm over the expansion pro
ject. "There's a lot of curiosity in Palo Alto
about what goes on I at Stanford 1," he said.
Holland, a senior, said the expansion gives
XTV and Stanford students a chance to tell
non-campus audiences about campus issues
and activities. He heralded the move as "a sig
nificant step to make [XTV] more available".
The agreement stipulates that XTV provide
two hours of preapproved programming for
broadcast per week. In addition to playing XTV
programming, the Mid-Peninsula Access Cor
poration will also teach an XTV video jockey to
run its equipment. Because of this added
responsibility, the video jockey will be paid —
the only paid VJ at the public-access station,
Holland said.
Program material will be aimed at trying to
inform audiences about campus issues. Hol
land said he expects the XTV program "Voice"
and programs concerning campus cultural
events to be among the areas covered by the
weekly broadcast. He expects CNN reporter
Peter Arnett's April 8 campus
speech to be broadcast.
Holland said XTV was
approached about doing the pro
gram in winter quarter.
Elliot Margolies, executive
director of the corporation, said
including programming like that
of XTV is a part of the mission of
public access television. "We want
everyone to feel like they can use
public access," he said, noting
that his organization is charged
with providing access to television
for four mid-Peninsula communi
ties, including Stanford.
XTV may be working more
closely with the public-access sta
tion in the future. Holland said

the station produces some pro
grams that XTV is interested in
broadcasting to its Stanford audi
ence, and negotiations are under
way to bring new programming to
campus.
In addition, the public-access
station has a studio that XTV
may be allowed to use in the
future, which is especially signifi
cant for XTV news programming,
Holland said.
The new arrangement will
make XTV available to 19,000
cable subscribers, Holland said.
He added that estimations he
received from Margolies sug
gested there would be about 1,000
viewers at any given time.
Because most people who
watch XTV do so in their resi
dence lounges, XTV's current
Stanford viewership is hard to
calculate, Holland said
