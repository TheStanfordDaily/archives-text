Cadet Thomas Berry, Stanford University
"I STARTED MY CLIMB
TO CAREER SUCCESS LAST SUMMER."
"The six weeks I spent at Fori Knox, KY, were the six toughest
weeks of my life â€” but also the most rewarding. If the Army does
more before 9:00 am than most people do all day, then I did more
in six weeks than most people did all summer. I made great
friendships, learned basic soldiering skills, and developed
discipline and confidence. I also earned a scholarship worth over
$24,000 in educational benefits."
