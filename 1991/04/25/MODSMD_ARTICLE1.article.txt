# Congressman blasts conduct in Reges case
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The controversy surrounding Stuart Reges
spread to Capitol Hill yesterday, where the chairman
of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse
and Control said the University deserved its warning
about the computer science senior lecturer.

Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said in
a statement released yesterday that
he supports national drug czar Bob
Martinez' position in the case. Mar
tinez sent a letter to University
President Donald Kennedy April 19
warning him that the University
could lose its federal funding if it
does not enforce its drug and alcohol
policy.
In his statement, Rangel said edu-

cators have a responsibility to set a tone about drug
abuse. "Educators carry an additional responsibility
since they are supposed to be role models for our
youngsters. Free speech is one thing, but speaking
freely about an illegal drug activity such as drug


Reges
abuse and drug possession should
not in any way be rewarded."
Rangel's statement also says,
"I think higher standards should
be placed on those who hold
themselves out to give advice to
people in their formative years."
Responding to Rangel's state
ment, Reges said, "I've never
asked to be rewarded."
He added that he is dismayed
the government would "try to
impose standards on educators
that they cannot advocate drug
use."
Reges, who claims to have vio
lated the University's drug policy
in protest of federal drug laws,
was placed on paid administrative
leave Friday. An investigation
into his claims is underway,
headed by Ken Down, associate
dean for administration at the
School of Engineering and Kathy

Davis, assistant dean of human
resources at the school.
In March, Reges wrote in a let
ter to Martinez that one of his
students asked him at a bus stop
if he should experiment with
MDA, an amphetamine-derived
drug. Reges told the student —
who said he had previously used
marijuana and LSD — that he
knew of no negative side effects of
the drug and recommended that
he try it.
Rangel also criticized the Uni
versity for not taking action
immediately after Reges made his
claims in two letters to The Daily
in November. Rangel wrote, "The
decision Stanford has made to
keep him on the payroll and the
other publicized problems they
have had with respect to federal
research funds do not really help
them with the Congress."
However, Vice President for
Public Affairs Bob Freelen said it
would have been irresponsible to
suspend Reges without pay before
an investigation was completed

and "without clear evidence of a
violation of the rules of the Uni
versity and of the government."
Down, who placed Reges on
leave, said he would not comment
on Rangel's statement since the
investigation is still underway. He
added that he does not know how
long the investigation will take.
Kennedy, in his first public
comment on the controversy,
wrote in a letter in yesterday's
Daily that "we are talking about
conduct, not free speech."
The controversy has received
national exposure. In addition to
coverage in the Los Angeles
Times, The New York Times, The
Washington Post and USA Today,
CNN started running a segment
Tuesday afternoon.
He said he has received a mes
sage from talk-show host Phil
Donahue and numerous calls
from radio talk shows. Reges said
he has approached the American
Civil Liberties Union but the
organization did not express
interest in representing him.
