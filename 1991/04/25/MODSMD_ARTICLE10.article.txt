Transfer students get surprise bill
Earlier this month, transfer students were
given a $200 bill for 1990 Orientation fees, caus
ing many to wonder why they weren't charged in
the fall.
According to Bill Georges, assistant director of
the Housing Center, the annual fee was advertised
well in advance.
The delay in assessing the fee arises from a
change in billing procedure. In the past, the fee
was either included in housing deposits or admis
sion acceptance charges.
This year, the procedure was changed to be
consistent with the billing procedure for fresh
men, who no longer have to pay housing deposits
when they enroll.
Georges said, "In principle, the change was
made. However, the people responsible for making
the changes in the computer systems were not
informed."
The mistake was not discovered until spring
break. The Registrar's Office was updating fees

for the upcoming year when it realized that the
transfer students had not been billed for Orienta
tion. Therefore, the Orientation fee was assessed
in spring quarter.
Georges said, "We regret that students were
billed so late in the academic year, but they were
indeed informed beforehand."

Pro fro arrested for drunkenness
A prospective freshman was arrested shortly
after midnight Sunday morning for being drunk
in public, according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
The teenager, whose identity was withheld,
was leaving the Exotic Erotic party at Alpha
Sigma in the Cowell Cluster when apprehended,
Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said the prospective freshman was
released into the custody of his or her mother
Sunday morning, shortly after the arrest.
