# Poison in tainted drinks identified

Laboratory tests have found
that paint thinner and plant fertil
izers were the substances found in
a pot of coffee and a container of
grape juice at the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house last week, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The grape juice was tainted by
a kerosene-based mineral spirit
believed to be paint thinner, said
Niemeyer.
Dr. David Torin, the staff
physician at Cowell Student
Health Services who analyzed the

substance, said if the substance
entered the lungs either through
inhaling or as the result of vomit
ing, there could be serious lung
damage.
"Otherwise, it takes quite a bit,
but can temporarily damage the
liver or kidneys," Torin said. It
would have taiken a few pints of
paint thinner to cause serious
damage, and since the grape juice
only contained a few ounces of
paint thinner, any damage would
have been minimal, he added.
In addition, a commercial plant
fertilizer was found in the tainted
coffee. The coffee was percolated
through the substance, and so
only contained an extract of it,

said Torin. He said he did not ana
lyze that substance and does not
know the severity of the effects of
ingestion.
The police are upgrading the
food-tampering case to a felony,
punishable by two to five years in
a state prison, Niemeyer said.
Police believe the case is probably
related to "some sort of revenge
motive," he said.
Niemeyer added that there are
currently no suspects. "I invite
anyone to give information,
anonymous or otherwise," he said.
The investigations number at the
Stanford Police Department is
725-5074.
