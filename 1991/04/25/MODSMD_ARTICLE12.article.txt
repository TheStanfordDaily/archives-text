# Can women crack 'glass ceiling?'
## 
### Melissa Hollatz 
"Men know how to treat us in the bedroom, but
not in the boardroom," Judy Rosener said in a forum
Tuesday night about the problems many women face
in breaking into top company positions.
The main speaker at the "Breaking The Glass
Ceiling" event at the Graduate School of Business,
Rosener defined the "glass ceiling" as "a metaphor
used to describe the fact that women don't seem to
be able to make it from middle- to upper-manage
ment positions as often or as fast as they ought to,
given their numbers."
Rosener is a professor at the Graduate School of
Management at UC-Irvine. She is the author of the
book "Workforce America! Managing Employee
Diversity as a Vital Resource" and a Harvard Busi
ness Review article entitled "Ways Women Lead."
The forum, which took place in Bishop Audito
rium, featured presentations by Rosener and two
other women speakers. About 140 people, predomi
nantly women, attended.
Rosener said, "Women are devalued just by the
fact that they are women ... by the fact that they're
different." Commenting on the difficulties women
face in the workplace, Rosener said the percentage of
women in upper-management positions has not
changed in the last decade.
She claimed one of the problems lies in the assim
ilation model followed by many companies, in which
people assume that to reach top positions they must
be like the people at the top, namely white males.
"Young men are socialized to be like this. Women
are socialized to be more dependent and less
assertive," she said. "Sex role expectations are such
that if you look at the assimilation model, women
can't make it."
Rosener also spoke about current academic
research into reasons for the inequality. Theories are
based on "blaming the victim," socialization prob
lems and many other "mini-theories."
She criticized "blaming the victim" theories,
which assume the assimilation model is valid and
claim that women must change to succeed. "If you

want to break the glass ceiling, act like a man,"
Rosener said. , , ■
Another idea holds that socialization is to blame
for the dilemma women face, a theory Rosener said
she supports. "Until our society changes and we look
differently at what it's like to be a male or a female,
there will be no change," she said.
Rosener advised women to search for positions in
non-traditional organizations. "If you want to
advance, go find an organization that offers diver
sity," she said. ,
The two other speakers — Su Schaffer, Stanford s
vice president for administrative resources, and
Linda Cyrog, vice president for business planning at
American President Companies — spoke about then
personal experiences in reaching top positions and
gave advice to women students at the Business
Schaffer spoke of the personal difficulties she
faced in her career as a vice president at United Air
lines. In searching for a resolution of the glass-ceil
ing problem, she stated, "You can't wish women
there; you can't legislate women there; you have to
want women there."
She said she believed progress was being made in
women's struggle for job equality, but that it was
slow
Cyrog gave advice to women searching for jobs.
"There are companies that you can go to and you can
develop a really successful career," she said. "We can
expect more women in top corporate positions as
more women receive the training.
She also recommended getting a broad range of
experience in many different jobs and building
strong working relationships, in addition to joining
non-traditional companies.
The event was co-sponsored by Women's Forum
West, a group of prominent Bay Area business
women, and Women in Management, a student orga
nization of the Business School.
After the presentations, the audience was invited
downstairs to the Arbuckle Lounge to discuss strate
gies for defeating the problem of the glass ceiling in
small groups led by Women's Forum West members.
