Bush promises to review travel
policy; supports Sununu
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
said yesterday he would review the White
House travel policy, suggesting Chief of Staff
John Sununu's extensive travel aboard govern
ment planes has left a "perception problem."
However, Bush said Sununu had his "full
confidence."
"I don't like this jumping all over Governor
Sununu when he has complied with the policy
and he's made full disclosure. What more can
you ask for?" Bush said in impromptu com
ments to reporters after a send-off for Djibouti
President Hassan Gouled Aptidon.
British secure Iraqi town,
order police to withdraw
ZAKHO, Iraq (AP) — British commandos
secured this northern town yesterday and Iraqi
police who had frightened residents began leav
ing it. In Baghdad, a Kurdish leader emerged
from talks with Saddam Hussein saying it was
safe for his people to return home.
Three companies of British Royal Marines
landed by helicopter and motored through the
streets of Zakho, pledging to protect inhabi
tants who had complained of intimidation by
the black-bereted Iraqi police.
Iraq must disclose weapons
material locations by Friday
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency has given Iraq
until Friday to inform it of the location of any
weapons-grade nuclear material, according to
agency documents.
A letter to Iraqi Foreign Minister Ahmed
Hussein from the lAEA says that Baghdad's
claim to not have any nuclear weapons is an
inadequate answer to the Security Council's
demand for a catalogue of its atomic inventory.
