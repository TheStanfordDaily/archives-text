# Kurds agree in principle to end revolt

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€” A Kurdish rebel leader
said yesterday that the guerrillas had reached an
agreement in principle with President Saddam Hus
sein to end their two-month revolt.
The leader, Jalal Talabani, said details of the
agreement had not been ironed out and further talks
would be held next week. Talabani was among a Kur
dish delegation that held talks with Saddam earlier
yesterday.
Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdis
tan, one of the Kurdish opposition groups,
said all Kurdish refugees on the border with Turkey
and Iran were being told to return to their homes in
northern Iraq.
News of the tentative agreement sent cheers
through a rebel base in the mountains near
Suleimaniya. A dozen Peshmergas, Kurdish rebel
fighters, sang and danced in the moonlight when
they heard the broadcast over foreign radio stations.
Others were dubious.
"He has made promises and signed so many
agreements in the past when he was weak. When he
became stronger, he betrayed his promises, and
cracked down on us.
"Without international guarantees, there will be
no solution, no implementation," said an older
fighter who declined to be identified.
Other rebels at the base told Associated Press cor
respondent Alex Efty they were happy because an
agreement would reunite them with their families.
Saddam and top Kurdish rebel leaders discussed
free elections for a national assembly, freedom of the
press and freedom to assemble, Talabani said. He
gave no further details of the talks, but said no
agreement had been signed and no guarantees ham
mered out.
"We have not reached a state of details on the
agreement. It was only in principle," Talabani said.
The talks, conceived of a week ago, were realized
after both sides failed militarily, he said.
"They failed in crushing us and we failed to bring
them down," Talabani said.
The hourlong talks were "frank and cordial," Tal
abani said, and Saddam was in a good mood.
"I did not find a weakness in him," Talabani said.
In 28 years of dealing with Baghdad, "I have
never seen . . . such a positive spirit, such a positive
climate," he said.

In Ankara, a senior Turkish Foreign Ministry offi
cial expressed doubt that the announcement was a
bona fide agreement.
"Saddam is fighting a struggle for survival. He
can be expected to seize on anything that will help
that," said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
A British Foreign Office spokesperson said: "We
have consistently supported calls for Kurdish auton
omy and have consistently called for political and
human rights for the Kurds. The immediate aim is
to return the Kurds to their homes in safety and any

thing that helps that we will support."
Talabani said the agreement would honor the
framework of a 1970 accord granting more auton
omy to the Kurds. The government never honored
that pact, he said. Saddam destroyed many Kurdish
villages in 1974 and again in 1988.
All eight Kurdish rebel groups in Iraq agreed to
meet with Saddam in an effort to reach a peaceful
settlement to fighting that has driven hundreds of
thousands of Kurds into refuge since the Persian
Gulf war ended in late February.
