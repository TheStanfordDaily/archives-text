# Gorbachev keeps position as party leader

### 
MOSCOW (AP) — President Mikhail Gor
bachev yesterday quashed an attempt by hard
line Communists to oust him as party leader,
claiming his departure would create an "explo
sive power vacuum" and lead to dictatorship.
Strengthened by a last-minute agreement
by leaders of nine Soviet republics to back his
economic "anti-crisis" plan, Gorbachev out
maneuvered his critics at a closed meeting of
the party's 410-member Central Committee.
In the process, he again demonstrated the
political skills that brought him from a minor
post in the provinces to the top of the party
and have allowed him to survive six years of
turbulent reforms.
The agreement with the republics was
reached late Tuesday after the republic's lead
ers were reportedly brought to Gorbachev's
dacha, or country home, in southwestern
Moscow.
Gorbachev's concessions to the reformist
leaders — including dropping an unpopular
tax and a possible cost-of-living wage index —
gave him the backing to thwart the hard-lin
ers.
Among those at the meeting was Gor
bachev's chief political rival, Russian Federa
tion President Boris Yeltsin, whose supporters
have staged recent rallies demanding Gor
bachev's ouster.
The hard-line regional party bosses and

other powerful Communists who gathered in
the Kremlin tried to force Gorbachev to give
an account of his handling of the embattled
party and crumbling economy. That would
have opened the way for stinging criticism and
a move to force Gorbachev to step down as
party leader.
In recent weeks, some hard-liners have
demanded separating Gorbachev's dual posts
of general secretary of the l p million-member
Communist Party and president of the coun
try.
Also, Gorbachev has faced resignation calls
from reformists.
The effort to make Gorbachev give an
account of his government was defeated by a
show of hands, with the overwhelming major
ity supporting Gorbachev, Central Committee
member and historian Roy Medvedev said in
an interview with The Associated Press.
The official news agency Tass said before
the meeting began that Gorbachev was "under
attack by the party apparatus, the so-called
conservative forces, which are seeking revenge
for the perestroika [reforms] that he started in
1985."
Because the Central Committee meeting
was closed, details of Gorbachev's maneuver
ing were unknown.
But his main thrusts were clear: He bran
dished the agreement with republic leaders as

evidence that he was taking resolute steps to
halt the country's economic collapse, and
painted a dire picture of the power struggle
that would occur if he stepped down.
"Let's soberly imagine what would happen
if these demands are fulfilled: The destruction
of the lawful state structure would inevitably
create an explosive power vacuum," Gor
bachev told the plenum, according to Tass.
"And no matter who were to come out on
top, in place of democratic institutions would
come arbitrary rule — to put it simply, a very
real dictatorship, and not the imaginary one
that some people see in the current constitu
tional regime," he said.
Gorbachev hailed the signing of a joint
statement by the leaders of nine Soviet
republics as "the start of a turning point" for
the nation.
There, he made several concessions to the
reformist leaders, offering to cancel an unpop
ular, new 5 percent sales tax on everyday goods
and to consider a nationwide wage indexation
program.
The republics that did not take part in the
agreement were the three Baltic states, as well
as Georgia, Armenia and Moldavia.
Gorbachev and the leaders, including
Yeltsin, urged workers "to end their economic
and political strikes and try to make up for lost
production as soon as possible."
