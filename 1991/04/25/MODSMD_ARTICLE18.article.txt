# Federal judge rejects Exxon criminal settlement

### 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -
A judge yesterday derailed a plea
bargain in the $1 billion settle
ment of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,
saying a $100 million criminal
fine was insufficient punishment
for the damage Exxon did to
Alaska's environment.
Under the plea agreement
negotiated by the state of Alaska,
the Justice Department and
Exxon, the company would have
paid $50 million to the state of
Alaska and $50 million to the fed
eral government.
A separate proposed settlement
of civil claims provides $900 mil
lion in restitution to clean up
Alaska shoreline. With rejection of
the fines, Exxon could withdraw

that agreement.
"The fines which were pro
posed to me were simply not ade
quate," U.S. District Judge H.
Russel Holland told a courtroom
packed with attorneys and
reporters.
He said he had considered fed
eral sentencing guidelines and
concluded that $100 million was
not enough to deter future spills.
"There is no question that the
Exxon Valdez oil spill was off the
chart," he said.
As part of the agreement,
Exxon had pleaded guilty to four
misdemeanor pollution charges
stemming from the March 24,
1989, oil spill â€” the nation's
largest. In exchange, felony

charges were to be dropped.
Exxon did not immediately
withdraw its guilty pleas following
yesterday's ruling. The judge gave
the company until May 24 to
decide.
The Justice Department said it
is ready to go to trial on the
charges if the pleas are with
drawn.
A Justice official in Washing
ton, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the department
would be willing to discuss with
Exxon during the next 30 days
whether a new agreement could
be reached. Any new agreement
would likely either increase the
criminal fine or shift some of the
civil payments to the criminal case

in hopes of satisfying the judge,
the official said.
The Exxon Valdez spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of North
Slope crude oil into Prince
William Sound and the Gulf of
Alaska after it ran aground on
Bligh Reef. Hundreds of thou
sands of birds and fish, and hun
dreds of seals and sea otters were
killed. Fishing and tourism were
interrupted, and the subsistence
lifestyle of Native Alaskan villages
was disrupted.
An Anchorage jury in March
1990 convicted Joseph Hazel
wood, the tanker's captain, of neg
ligent discharge of oil, a misde
meanor. He has appealed the con
viction.
