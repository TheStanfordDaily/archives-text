The ASSU Senate could
use some limits on
its scope and power

THE ASSU SENATE'S tom
foolery about how to inter
pret students' support for
two amendments to the ASSU
Constitution highlights a funda
mental flaw in the structure of the
student government.
It was hoped that this spring's
general election would give stu
dents the chance to decide what
off-campus issues the ASSU
should discuss and to what extent
it should be responsible to student
opinion.
Students overwhelmingly ap
proved Constitutional Amendment
4 (the Curry bill), which would
require the senate to measure stu
dent opinion before making resolu
tions on national and international
issues.
And students also approved
Constitutional Amendment 1 (the
Overdeck bill), which prohibits
senate discussion of off-campus
issues unless at least one Stanford
student is affected by the issue "in
a substantially different way than
would be the case if he or she were
not a university student."
Although the election indicates
support both for limiting the scope
of the ASSU and insuring its
accountability to students, a hand
ful of People's Platform senators
are interpreting the outcome by
saying that the fact that the Curry
bill passed by more votes nullifies
the Overdeck amendment.
The bills are perfectly capable of
being applied simultaneously —
and since students voted for both
bills, they should get them.
The senate will still be able to
pass resolutions on campus issues.
Because of CA-1, the senate will

not pass bills on issues that do not
affect at least one student because
he or she is a Stanford student;
when there are off-campus issues
that do affect students, the senate
must follow the guidelines of CA-4
and reasonably represent what
students think.
The attempt of senators to
manipulate the outcome of the
election is suspect, especially since
a procedure for this contingency
was not determined and made
known to voters prior to the elec
tion.
Had supporters of the Overdeck
bill known that the senate might
interpret their voting for their sec
ond-choice Curry bill as possibly
nullifying the Overdeck bill itself,
it is doubtful that the Curry bill
would have commanded so much
support.
The debate raises another issue.
Because the senate has sole
responsibility for deciding when it
has overstepped its bounds, both
bills may mean little in practice.
If next year's senators want to
discuss the latest developments in
the Soviet Union, they'll probably
claim that as Stanford students
and future leaders they have a spe
cial responsibility to assert them
selves and cannot stand idly by. It
will be interesting to see how far
the senate tries to stretch its juris
diction.
This unfortunate situation
highlights the need for an indepen
dent judiciary branch of the ASSU.
Such a body would bring enormous
benefits. The language of the
ASSU's bills, eternally elusive,
could be made more concrete by a
third party that is politically neu
tral. Bills could be struck down as
unconstitutional.
More important, the creation of
such a branch would enable checks
on the senate — which students
have clearly voted for and visibly
want.
