## Stuart Reges' suspension 'Reges has taken a courageous, if unpopular, stand' 
### 
AS A MEMBER OF THE Stanford
community, I wish to comment on
the situation arising out of the
statements by Stuart Reges regarding
University drug policy.
Clearly, drugs will not enhance the
learning experience. But it should not be
necessary to legislate against their use in
order to remove them from the academic
environment. Prohibition has failed in
the past and is no more likely to work
today.
We must educate people about the use
of drugs in a rational and scientific way:
That is the function of a university. Edu
cation must provide an environment in
which students can make decisions on
their own, based on information they are
able to obtain and evaluate themselves.
It should not be the University's func-

tion to police the private lives of the stu
dents and faculty.
The government's drug policies are
certainly in need of scrutiny. Physiologi
cally, there is no reason to defend certain
drugs (for example, caffeine, nicotine
and alcohol) and make their use accept
able while other substances (marijuana,
cocaine and heroin) are designated as
unacceptable.
The policies of the U.S. government
with regard to drug use are arbitrary,
fundamentalist, moralistic and intellec
tually indefensible. If society were con
cerned with public health, alcohol and
nicotine would certainly be illegal. The
current state of affairs is more related to
the economic issues attendant to the pro
duction and distribution of the sub
stances in question than to the intrinsic

merits of the drugs.
Because marijuana, cocaine and
heroin are predominantly used by lower
socioeconomic groups, they are easy tar
gets for conservative, political gadflies
who must garner public attention
through rabid invocations of moralistic
arguments that have no basis in fact.
The situation is complicated and will
not be resolved by politicians' ranting
and raving: Only rational investigation
and scientific debate can solve the prob
lems. Stanford is in a unique position to
provide a forum for these discussions
and should do so instead of blindly
echoing the dictum from Washington,
D.C,
I would like Reges to know that he is
not alone in his criticism of the national
so-called "policy" regarding drug use. I

resent the idea that Stanford must
knuckle under to pressure from the fed
eral government and make a policy
statement regarding drug use that
reflects a conservative political agenda
without a free and open discussion of
such vital issues. Stanford must not
simply be a mouthpiece for politicians
who attempt to mold public opinion by
choking off funding for opposing points
of view.
Remember, the same political disci
pline brought us the savings and loan
debacle and several wars: Can we afford
to accept their judgment uncritically?
Reges has taken a courageous, if
unpopular, stand and I wish to thank
him and offer my support.
