# Drug use ruins lives and is unbecoming in a Stanford teacher
## 
### 
I could not help but feel outraged
when I learned in Monday's Daily about
Stuart Reges and his irresponsible
behavior and attitude towards drug use.
Reges claims that drug use is a victim
less crime. Give me a break; the '60s are
over. Drugs do destroy lives. I know; I
can still remember when a member of
my family was killed by them.
Some people feel that it is immoral to
sponsor companies that kill dolphins, or
those that poison farm workers with pes
ticides. How can one justify sponsoring
drug lords who get rich at the expense of
the blood and lives of innocent people?
No victims? Tell that to Colombians who
have been terrorized and killed by those
"victimless crime"-substance providers.
How about gangs: Why do you think they
are in business?

What kind of hypocrites are we when
we say it is wrong for someone to sell
drugs, but it is OK for Stanford intellec
tuals to use them? Last quarter I worked
trying to teach teen-agers from East Palo
Alto that they can become useful mem
bers of society if they stay in school and
go to college. What do I tell those kids
now? They may get the message that in
college they can make a lot of money sell
ing dope to victimless criminals. After
all, people from Stanford are very smart,
aren't they?
I strongly feel that people like Reges
are a disgrace to this institution and
should not be allowed to teach and influ
ence students at Stanford. Are these the
kind of role models we need? Are these
the kind of people we need to help us
cope with our personal problems? Are
these the kind of people you'll trust your
life to during an emergency, an earth
quake?
It doesn't make a difference if some
one is a great teacher if his personal
agenda is contrary to the goals of this
institution. I don't think that any person

affiliated with Stanford should go around
"sharing" his "drugs-are-OK" views with
students. Many students are under a lot
of stress and have to work hard at coping
with academic demands. If your idea of
coping with life is by bailing out once in a
while, then we don't need you here; peo
ple come to Stanford to work hard, not to
get high.
