# University is selling its academic integrity for federal money
## 
### 
The chicken of government "aid" to
education is coming home to roost at
Stanford, and a very large and intimidat
ing bird it is turning out to be. First
there were the assorted indignities of the
indirect-cost "investigation," and now we
have the Stuart Reges affair.
Reges appears to be a star-caliber

teacher and an honest individual with
the courage to say what he believes. Now
he is suspended, and the big losers are
his students.
But an even bigger loser in the long
run may turn out to be Stanford itself,
for what the Reges affair points out is
that no money comes without strings
and Stanford has obviously sold its soul
to the federal devil for a handful of gold.
A once proud and independent private
institution of higher learning is now
groveling at the feet of our national drug
czar.
Reges believes that his private life is
his own and his activities and pleasures
outside of the hours Stanford contracts
for his services are no one else's busi
ness. He has been honest and outspoken;
his reward may be unemployment. Stan
ford has exhibited hypocrisy and craven
ness; it stands to be rewarded with fat
government contracts.
