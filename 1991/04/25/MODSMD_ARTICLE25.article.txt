## Latinos coming together 
### 
NOTHING BRINGS A community
together like a crisis. Assembled in
the Casa Zapata lounge on Mon
day night was a remarkably diverse con
gregation of Latino students — people
with widely conflicting views and person
alities who hadn't gathered together for a
political cause in several years.
All were concerned by the fact that
MEChA's special fee request was turned
down in the ASSU election, and all were
willing to set their differences aside to
save the biggest funding source for the
Latino community's events.
It is no secret that the Chicano and
Latino community at Stanford has had a
history characterized by erratic periods of
unity and disunity, constant bickering
about who is speaking for whom and what
we want to call ourselves.
At times the conflicts have erupted
into angry and emotional outbursts, and
sometimes they have been more subtle,
but they have always in some way
revolved around the issues of identity and
representation — how broadly defined
our community is and who we want rep
resenting us, whether we are Hispanic or
Latino, Mexican-American or Chicano.
I tend to see the conflicts as the grow
ing pains of a maturing community, a
community that suddenly finds itself the
fastest growing in the nation but is devoid
of any significant national political lead
ership.
The United States is just discovering
the tremendous political potential of the
Latino community, and Latinos are com
ing to terms with the fact that they must
try to make all the diverse groups of Lati

nos work as a cohesive whole: the conser
vative-leaning Cubans in Florida with the
more liberal Puerto Ricans in New York
and the Chicanos of the Southwest.
The conflicts that go on at Stanford
and other universities are miniature
reproductions of conflicts that are going
on in the national Latino community.
The Latino community at Stanford
consists of international students from
Latin America as well as students from
Texas and New Mexico, Los Angeles and
Chicago, first generation and fifth gener
ation Chicanos. All bring with them their
own conceptions of what it means to be
Latino, Chicano, Hispanic or whatever
they call themselves.
Some have argued that the conflicts at
Stanford are made even more severe by
competing Stanford egos, petty regional
ism and the tendency to divide the com
munity into camps on extreme ends of the
political spectrum. We often fail to recog
nize that the majority of the Latinos lie
far from either one of the imaginary
extremes but rather somewhere in the
middle — closer to each other than people
think.
When it comes down to it, all of us care
about the well-being of our community,
within Stanford and without. Ironically,
that is why we fight so much — if we
didn't care about it we would have
become apathetic and abandoned the
community long ago.
There are similarities that bridge most
of the gaps. Politically, there are broader
issues on which Latinos agree and work
together: protection of our cultural
rights, educational and political empow

erment. As a community we sponsor a
multitude of cultural celebrations as well
as educational events and speakers, most
of which are sponsored by the MEChA
special fee.
Unlike most of the other communities
of color, and partly because of our political
immaturity as a community, we have
often vented our anger at each other
through very public means.
But despite everything, we survive as a
community. And our annual fee contribu
tion is essential to the functioning of our
community, for the money goes to sustain
the events that the entire community
contributes to and participates in.
Some people, like Tim Marklein in his
Monday column, confuse the special fee
with the personalities most active in the
MEChA organization — the elusive 20
students to which Marklein refers. The
special fee does not contribute to partisan
politics; instead, it supports cultural and
educational events.
A very large percentage of Latino stu
dents and many others from the Stanford
community will be in attendance at the
annual Cinco de Mayo celebration next
month.
They may at times have little in com
mon but on an issue like this it is easy to
come together.
