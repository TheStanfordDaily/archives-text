## Stuart Reges' suspension Reges has misunderstood issues of privacy and professionalism 
### 
IN READING STUART REGES' self
defense, I am struck by how often he
invokes the concept of "privacy" —
and how little he seems to be aware of
the ethical complexities attached to this
concept. The distinction between "pub
lic" and "private" is indeed one of the
bases of liberal democracy. In our cul
ture, we generally believe that individu
als should be free to engage in activities
which are "private" in the sense of not
having an impact on a larger group. Yet
it is important to realize that there is
hardly any activity which is purely self
referential, which does not affect others.
For example, it would seem that while
individuals must conform to definite pro
fessional constraints when they are at
work (public activities), they should be
free to do as they like when they are at
home (private activities). But what if the
person is a doctor whose office is at
home? What if the person is the presi
dent of the United States whose home is
the center of government? What about
the doctor whose office is not at home

but who uses drugs which influence his
mind and body even after he steps out of
his home and enters the office? The use
of drugs, far from being a purely private
activity, thwarts the private/public dis
tinction as traditionally imagined.
These questions are relevant to the
lives of students because their dormitory
rooms are not only their private
dwellings but also their professional
habitat — the place where they do most
of their studying. I believe it would
encourage a lack of professionalism and
immorality (i.e., a tendency to interpret
every potentially professional situation
as a purely private one) for a university
to be totally unconcerned about the use
of drugs in students' rooms.
Reges states that "I have demanded
that the University respect my privacy.
In particular, I refuse to allow the Uni
versity to dictate what I will and won't
carry in my backpack while on campus."
It is hard to imagine a more private place
than Reges' backpack. Yet, here again,
the issue is not so simple. Reges wrote

letters to the president, vice president,
senators and others publicizing his back
pack and flaunting the fact that he car
ries drugs in it."I did so to draw atten
tion to the larger issue of violation of pri
vacy." The irony here is that Reges him
self has turned his private property into
a public symbol. We are forced to know
about his private affairs — not because
the University has searched his backpack
but because he has proclaimed what it
contains.
Because the distinction between pri
vate and public is often fuzzy, rulers will
often allow personal activities to go on
even if they technically violate a rule.
But when individuals publicize their
unlawful actions, when they criticize the
rulers for being tolerant, when they call
this tolerance "hypocrisy," as Reges did,
how can they expect to go unpunished?
Rulers may tolerate individual acts of
disobedience; they generally cannot tol
erate individuals who ritualistically
make disobedience public and thereby
urge everyone to disobey.

A final issue concerns speech. Reges
admits that he has advised students to
take drugs. He contends that he should
be free to say anything he wishes in "pri
vate conversation." My response to this,
first of all, is that the notion of "private
conversation" is inherently absurd. All
speech implies an interlocutor, a person
upon whom speech can have an impact.
No speech is, strictly speaking, private.
Moreover, Reges described his "private
conversation" in a letter to a public offi
cial, Bob Martinez, the head of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy. In this
way, he addressed his "private conversa
tion" to the entire nation, and in this
way his words damage not only the stu
dent he spoke to but the image of the
University as a whole.
But the most important point is this:
The relationship between student and
teacher is a professional one regardless
of whether the interaction occurs in the
classroom or on a bus. To an undergrad
uate, the opinion of a professor on moral
matters is rarely taken as a mere "per-

sonal opinion" — it appears as the view
of an expert, as authoritative. That is
why wise professors are so reluctant to
articulate their personal opinions on
moral issues and prefer to ask students
questions that will get them to perceive
all the implications of their own moral
inclinations. But Reges did not merely
discuss the pros and cons of drug use
with his student; he positively advised
the student to use drugs, writing to The
Daily that "I recommended that he try
it."
For those of us who make serious
efforts to be responsible in our conduct
with students, for those of us who realize
that even breaking the law is something
that can be done with varying degrees of
responsibility, Reges' self-defense is
insulting in its shallowness. If he suc
ceeds in gaining support from students
and administrators, it will be more than
insulting; it will be demoralizing.

vacy." The irony here is that Reges him
self has turned his private property into
a public symbol. We are forced to know
about his private affairs — not because
the University has searched his backpack
but because he has proclaimed what it
contains.
Because the distinction between pri
vate and public is often fuzzy, rulers will
often allow personal activities to go on
even if they technically violate a rule.
But when individuals publicize their
unlawful actions, when they criticize the
rulers for being tolerant, when they call
this tolerance "hypocrisy," as Reges did,
how can they expect to go unpunished?
Rulers may tolerate individual acts of
disobedience; they generally cannot tol
erate individuals who ritualistically
make disobedience public and thereby
urge everyone to disobey.

A final issue concerns speech. Reges
admits that he has advised students to
take drugs. He contends that he should
be free to say anything he wishes in "pri
vate conversation." My response to this,
first of all, is that the notion of "private
conversation" is inherently absurd. All
speech implies an interlocutor, a person
upon whom speech can have an impact.
No speech is, strictly speaking, private.
Moreover, Reges described his "private
conversation" in a letter to a public offi
cial, Bob Martinez, the head of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy. In this
way, he addressed his "private conversa
tion" to the entire nation, and in this
way his words damage not only the stu
dent he spoke to but the image of the
University as a whole.
But the most important point is this:
The relationship between student and
teacher is a professional one regardless
of whether the interaction occurs in the
classroom or on a bus. To an undergrad
uate, the opinion of a professor on moral
matters is rarely taken as a mere "per-

sonal opinion" — it appears as the view
of an expert, as authoritative. That is
why wise professors are so reluctant to
articulate their personal opinions on
moral issues and prefer to ask students
questions that will get them to perceive
all the implications of their own moral
inclinations. But Reges did not merely
discuss the pros and cons of drug use
with his student; he positively advised
the student to use drugs, writing to The
Daily that "I recommended that he try
it."
For those of us who make serious
efforts to be responsible in our conduct
with students, for those of us who realize
that even breaking the law is something
that can be done with varying degrees of
responsibility, Reges' self-defense is
insulting in its shallowness. If he suc
ceeds in gaining support from students
and administrators, it will be more than
insulting; it will be demoralizing.
