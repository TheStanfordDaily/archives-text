# Reges should be jailed and fired for criminal use of illegal drugs
## 
### 
I was amazed and appalled to learn
that a university that prides itself on
having one of the top five law schools in
the country can harbor on its faculty
someone with such casual contempt for
the law as Stuart Reges. When one strips
away all the bleating about his "private
life" and the federal government's coer
cion of Stanford's drug and alcohol poli
cy, there remain several conclusions to
be drawn from his situation.

First, regardless of what "we could
learn intellectually and spiritually from
our drug experiences," one must
acknowledge the fact that in the United
States today, the use of drugs such as
MDA is illegal. Thus, however much
Reges may style himself as a champion of
individual liberty, heightened awareness,
etc., he is at the core a common criminal,
and merits equal responsibility before
the law as any other criminal of his ilk.
Indeed, one could argue that his
responsibility is greater for the fact that
he violated the trust of his position as
teacher by advising a former student,
who obviously valued his opinion, to use
drugs. Although that may not make him
a "pusher" in a definitive legal sense, it

can certainly be viewed as the moral
equivalent thereof.
Whatever the results of the Universi
ty's investigation may be, if Reges is not
subjected to the legal as well as adminis
trative consequences of his actions, Stan
ford will have presented the world yet
another example of the supreme arro
gance of intellectual elitism. Perhaps
Reges' views on the deleterious effects of
drugs would change were he incarcerated
with some of his fellow members of the
festival of light, or made to perform com
munity service caring for infants born
addicted to crack.
