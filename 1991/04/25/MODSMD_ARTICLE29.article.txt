# Government aid leads to government control of college education
## 
### 
Back in the 19505, Robert Taft-style
Republicans and other political libertari
ans warned that federal aid to education
would mean federal control of education.
The indirect-cost controversy and the
federally mandated suspension of Com
puter Science Lecturer Stuart Reges are
precisely the sort of bitter fruits that one
could reasonably expect would flow from
the false cornucopia of government sub-

sidies.
