# Faculty benefits parity appears unlikely
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
Benefits parity for gay and lesbian fac
ulty and staff appears a distant reality as a
Faculty Senate committee considers the
costs of such a program.
A proposal introduced during last week's
senate meeting would offer partners of gay
and lesbian faculty and staff benefits equal
to those employee spouses currently
receive.
According to its author, Prof. Katherine
O'Hanlan, the bill is an attempt to bring
employee benefits in line with the Univer
sity's longstanding policy of nondiscrimina
tion based on sexual orientation.
"It is both inexplicable and inconsistent
for the University to exclude [those] who
are prevented by state law from getting the
marital status that would entitle them to
[benefits] coverage," Deborah Rhode, law
professor and a sponsor of the bill, said.
The current University nondiscrimina
tion policy states: "Stanford guarantees
equal opportunity for all employees . . .
regardless of race, color, creed, religion,
national origin, sexual orientation, age or
gender."
Provost James Rosse acknowledged that
there is an inconsistency in the University's
policy with regard to employee benefits but
said it would take a long time to be resolved
because of the complexity of the issues

involved.
Given the University's current budget
constraints, the issue is especially contro
versial because any extension of faculty and
staff benefits would involve significant
additional costs. The University Benefits
Committee was assigned to determine its
potential costs.
"As a University official I don't know
how we will pay for something like that,"
said Elizabeth Sloan, communication direc
tor for the Office of Development.
The benefits committee's report, to be
presented at a senate meeting on May 16,
may ultimately determine the outcome of
the bill.
The principal goals of the bill include
extending the following benefits to domes
tic partners: workers' compensation, dental
and medical insurance plans, accident
insurance, housing privileges, reduced
tuition for children attending the Univer
sity and access to University libraries and
athletic facilities.
Unlike the student domestic partners
policy, the proposed bill does not include
non-married heterosexual couples. "We felt
this was controversial enough, '' Rhode said.
The senate's steering committee pre
vented full discussion of the bill and instead
offered an alternate motion that recom
mended sending the bill directly to the ben-
eflts committee.
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee,
then a member of the senate, said
after the meeting that the pre
scribed procedure amounted to
"implicitly repudiating" the pro
posal. Lougee has since resigned
from the senate. She was not
available for comment.
O'Hanlan said the purpose of

the bill is to "ask the senate to say
'Yes, we're in favor of equal rights
for all employees regardless of
sexual orientation' and not 'We
might be in favor of equal treat
ment but it depends on the cost.'
Despite the negative reaction
of dozens of alumni to the domes
tic partners policy for students,
however, Sloan said the Develop
ment Office would support any
well-conceived policy that the
University passed.

She said that 50 to 60 alumni
expressed their dismay after the
implementation of the student
policy. Of these, 25 percent said
they would no longer give to the
University. None were known to
be substantial donors, she said.
The University has not yet
taken any action on the proposal.
"The matter is in the hands of the
benefits committee and their
report," Rosse said. The Board of
Trustees has ultimate authority
over the issue, he added.
