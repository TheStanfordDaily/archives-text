## Steady Solomon closes his tennis career in style 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
In the illustrious history of
Stanford men's tennis, there have
been few players as valuable to the
team as senior co-captain Glenn
Solomon.
For proof, you only need to set
your clock back one year to last
season's NCAA Championships in
Indian Wells, Calif. Playing at No.
5, Solomon was a perfect 4-0 in
singles, but that's only part of the
story. Two of those matches — in
the quarterfinals against Texas
and in the semifinals against USC
— lasted nearly four hours in 100-
plus degree heat.
Solomon collapsed after the
second, a 3-6, 7-6, 6-3 nailbiter
against USC's Martin Dionne.
Solomon saved two match points
in the second set of that match
and probably ran two marathons
in the process.
"Collapsing into (asst. coach
John) Whitlinger's arms after the
(Dionne) match was probably the
highlight of my life," Solomon
said. "It was one of those matches
where I had given my all and there
just wasn't anything left. It was a
great feeling."
"It was one of the greatest
efforts I have ever seen,"
Whitlinger said. "But wins like
that are not unusual for Glenn.
He has done it time and time
again for us."
Solomon has clinched more
than a few matches for the Cardi
nal in his four years here. Perhaps
the most memorable came against
UCLA's Billy Barber two years
ago when Solomon came back
from a 4-0 deficit in the third set
to win the match and lead the Car
dinal to victory against a highly
touted Bruin team.

"Glenn's a fighter. You hate to
play him because you know he's
going to do everything possible to
win. He's never going to die,"
coach Dick Gould said.
Solomon has never over
whelmed opponents with power.
His game is one of attrition: wear
down the other guy, run down
every ball, fight like hell until
your legs give — and then chase
after balls on your knees. That
game has caused opponents fits
and has allowed Solomon to notch
nearly 100 wins for the Cardinal
in singles play.
"Rarely has someone had such
a positive impact on our program
as Glenn," Gould said.
But Solomon's impact is not
confined to the tennis court. The
Roslyn Heights, N.Y. native, a
Rhodes Scholar finalist, has dedi
cated himself to community ser
vice in his four years at Stanford.
He was a co-director of the presti
gious "You Can Make A Difference
Conference" last January, and he
is presently serving as a co-direc
tor of Volunteers for Youth (the
Big Sibling/Little Sibling pro
gram).
"Being on a scholarship has
made me feel indebted to the
Stanford. Getting involved in the
community is one way that I can
give back," Solomon said.
"Glenn has a genuine concern
for others. How he has made time
to do all the things he has done, I
don't know, but it's a credit to
him," Gould said.
Besides community service,
Solomon has maintained over a
3.7 GPA and has been active as an
executive officer in his fraternity,
Alpha Epsilon Pi. After gradua
tion, Solomon will return to New
York to work for Goldman, Sachs
& Co.

'Glenn's a fighter. You
hate to play him
because you know
he's going to do
everything possible
to win. He's never
going to die.'

"(While at Stanford] I felt I had
to make the most of all the oppor
tunities that came my way. At
times, especially when the 'You
Can Make A Difference Confer
ence' was approaching, I probably
was as busy as is humanly possi
ble. But those were opportunities
that weren't going to come along
again," Solomon said.
Solomon has been the consum
mate team player, most notably
this year. For the first time in his
four years, Solomon has been sit
ting on the sideline during singles
play. But like the perfect leader,
Solomon has been at every match,
cheering his teammates from
courtside.
"I know [not playing] is proba
bly eating him up inside,"
Whitlinger said. "He wants to be

out there. He's a fighter. But to
show you how great of a team
player the guy is, he's out there
practicing as hard as he can and
cheering us on every match."
"I have one goal left in tennis:
to win a fourth consecutive NCAA
title. That's it," Solomon said.
"I'm going to do whatever it takes
to get that done, whether it be

from the sideline or from the
court."
Solomon will be playing today
in the open bracket of the Pacific
10 Championships in Ojai, Calif.
This may be the last chance that
Solomon has to prove that he
belongs back in the starting
lineup, and Solomon plans to
make the most of it.

"I feel that things have been
coming around recently. I'm really
excited about the tournament,"
Solomon said. "Technically, I'm
playing just as well as I did last
year, but I've lost a little confi
dence. Hopefully, I'm going to get
some of that back fthis week

Solomon says most of the credit
for the team's success belongs to
the coaches. "It's no coincidence
that we've won more team titles
(in the past two decades) than
anyone else. Stanford has the best
tennis program in the country.
Coach Gould and Whitlinger are
the two best coaches anywhere —

motivationally, technically and
organizationally. Guys from other
teams will tell you that," Solomon
said.
"I have all the confidence in the
world in the coaches," Solomon
added. "I think we're on the right
track now [for a fourth consecu
tive title.] Anyone who saw us last
weekend knows that. We abso
lutely thumped the two best
teams in the country, besides us. I
think we scared them a little bit.
Hopefully we can carry that same
sort of intensity into NCAAs."
