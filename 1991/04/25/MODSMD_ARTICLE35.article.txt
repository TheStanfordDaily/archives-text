# Golfers finish 3rd at league championships
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
In recurrent cycles the rain
drops soaked the greens. The
wind howled through the fair
ways. And yesterday the Cardinal
women's golf team left the
Eugene (Ore.) Country Club, site
of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, storm-weary and
battle-scarred.
Hoping that the poor weather
would help the Cardinal and hurt
fair weather teams like second
ranked Arizona and third-ranked
UCLA, Stanford watched its
chance to overtake Arizona in sec
ond place completely slip out of
reach.
Although Arizona only shot
314 — the Cardinal had lower
scores on both the first and second
days — the Stanford golfers bet
tered the Wildcats on the high-end
of the scoreboard with a 320 on
the final day. The Cardinal com
piled an overall three-day total of

938 to finish the tourney 22
strokes behind runner-up Ari
zona.
But the story of the day — and
the tournament — was UCI.A.
Led by the individual winner, Lisa
Kiggens, who finished at one over
par, the Bruins pulled away from
everyone as they beat Arizona by
24 strokes and the Cardinal by 44.
"Before the Pac-lOs, San Jose
State and Arizona were the two
premier teams," said Cardinal
coach Tim Baldwin. "But UCLA
played remarkably well, and I now
feel strongly that UCLA has
established itself up there with
San Jose State."
The Cardinal entered the final
day confident that it would finish
a strong third — at worst. But the
Stanford linksters ended up cling
ing to third as host Oregon made a
last-ditch run. The Ducks,
though, finished eight strokes
short of the Cardinal in a tie with
Arizona State at 946.
"Third place is OK because Ari
zona and UCLA are ranked ahead
of us," said Jodi Figley, who fin
ished the day with a team-high 78.
"But we could have played much
more respectably."
The Cardinal needed each of
the top four players to slice their
scores by at least four or five

strokes, but that was not to be.
Figley and Stephanie Davis
joined Moore for the lowest scores
on the day for Stanford. "Jodi and
Stephanie played fairly solid
today," said Baldwin.
Moore, ranked 18th in the
nation, finished in a three-way tie
for fourth and was selected to the
second All-Pac 10 Team along
with teammate Figley, who fin
ished two strokes behind in sev
enth.
"Adele had an excellent tourna
ment and she would have chal

lenged Kiggens for the title, but
she didn't putt well all three
days," said Baldwin.
But the blow to the team came
when Audrey Wooding shot 15
over par after challenging for the
individual title with scores of 75
and 77 in the first two days.
"Audrey ballooned," Baldwin said.
"It was very unanticipated."
And the Cardinal did not
receive a present from Martha
Richards, the No. 5 player, who
had shot a 75 on the final day two
weeks ago in the Lady Sun Devil

Invitational after a rocky first two
days. Richards shot an 86 yester
day.
"Even if Audrey had played
well, the best we could have done
would have been a strong third
place showing," said Baldwin.
The Cardinal now has an indi
cation of where it stands in the
trenches with Arizona and UCLA
entering the NCAA tournament.
"We know that we can beat them,"
said Figley. "It's just a matter of
putting it all together."
