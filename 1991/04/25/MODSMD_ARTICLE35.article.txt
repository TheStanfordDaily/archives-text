In recurrent cycles the rain
drops soaked the greens. The
wind howled through the fair
ways. And yesterday the Cardinal
women's golf team left the
Eugene (Ore.) Country Club, site
of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, storm-weary and
battle-scarred.
Hoping that the poor weather
would help the Cardinal and hurt
fair weather teams like second
ranked Arizona and third-ranked
UCLA, Stanford watched its
chance to overtake Arizona in sec
ond place completely slip out of
reach.
Although Arizona only shot
314 — the Cardinal had lower
scores on both the first and second
days — the Stanford golfers bet
tered the Wildcats on the high-end
of the scoreboard with a 320 on
the final day. The Cardinal com
piled an overall three-day total of

938 to finish the tourney 22
strokes behind runner-up Ari
zona.
But the story of the day — and
the tournament — was UCI.A.
Led by the individual winner, Lisa
Kiggens, who finished at one over
par, the Bruins pulled away from
everyone as they beat Arizona by
24 strokes and the Cardinal by 44.
"Before the Pac-lOs, San Jose
State and Arizona were the two
premier teams," said Cardinal
coach Tim Baldwin. "But UCLA
played remarkably well, and I now
feel strongly that UCLA has
established itself up there with
San Jose State."
The Cardinal entered the final
day confident that it would finish
a strong third — at worst. But the
Stanford linksters ended up cling
ing to third as host Oregon made a
last-ditch run. The Ducks,
though, finished eight strokes
short of the Cardinal in a tie with
