# Cardinal may be ready, but not armed

### 
It is somewhat ironic that pitching, long
the strength of the Stanford program,
could doom the Cardinal's NCAA base
ball title hopes in 1991.
That was the message over the weekend,
when — in case you missed it — Stanford
pitchers blew three leads (two in the ninth
inning) and all but assured that it will not
repeat as Pacific 10 Southern Division cham
pions. Stanford (30-14) was swept by for
merly last-place UCLA at Sunken Diamond,
the first visiting team to sweep there since
1989.
The Bruins' comebacks were aided by
uncharacteristically sloppy Stanford
defense, but that is something that will iron
itself out. What cannot be smoothed over is
the distinct impression that the 1991 pitch
ing staff is a mere shadow of the Cardinal
staffs of past seasons.
To be fair, we may never again see a
pitching staff of the quality and depth
that pitching coach Tom Dunton
boasted on last season's College World Series
team. That group was incredibly talented —
in fact, they were too good.
Stan Spencer (14-1, 2.73 ERA) and Mike

Mussina (14-5, 3.50) were so sparkling they
were both first-round pro draft picks, and
left the Farm for big money. With the two
juniors, Stanford had arguably the best one
two starting pitching combination in college
baseball. They had 18 complete games
between them, a remarkable statistic.
Consider then, what happens when you
add a supporting cast of Brian Sackinsky
(10-1, 5.09), John Reid (7-1, 3.03), and Jamie
Sepeda (3-0, 4.73). Plus a bullpen of Scott
Weiss (6-2, 3.54, 7 saves), Robbie Kamer
schen (2-0, 3.52, 1) and Aaron Dorlarque (2-
1, 3.58, 1).
Despite this arms corps, Stanford still
didn't win the NCAA Championship. It bog
gles the mind.

Cut to 1991. Spencer, Mussina and
Kamerschen are gone. Sackinsky, who was
projected as the Cardinal's top hurler, has
been injured and has posted a 6.50 ERA
without a decision. Dunton has a starting
rotation consisting of Reid (5-3, 5.02), a
senior, Sepeda (5-1, 2.91), a sophomore, and
Willie Adams (6-2, 4.06), a freshman.
Weiss has five saves out of the bullpen,
but blew two leads against UCLA and carries
a mediocre 5-4 record. Other hopefuls
haven't panned out.
It's not a staff to be ashamed of, but it
lacks the key to any successful baseball
team: consistency. Stanford could count on
Spencer or Mussina or both to shut down the
opposition every week last year. This year,
who knows?
The Cardinal opened the season like
gangbusters, racing out to a 16-3 record. But
in the tough Six-Pac, Stanford has waxed
and waned. Follow this list, if you can:
• Feb. 22-24, the Cardinal opens the con
ference by sweeping Arizona State;
• March 8-10, Stanford gets swept by
USC;
