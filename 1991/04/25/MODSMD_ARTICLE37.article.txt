# Women begin play at Pacific 10s
## Defending champ Graham stays home, will rest shoulder for NCAAs 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Last weekend, the Cardinal won the
Pacific 10 Conference women's tennis
crown and showed it was the top team in
the league — again.
Over the next four days, Stanford
will attempt to prove it also has the best
players in the Pac-10.
Again.
Fendick. Green. Birch. Graham. The
last four conference champs have worn
the Cardinal and White. One of them
will be back in Ojai, Calif, trying to win
the title she captured in 1989.
Senior Sandra Birch, whose phenom
enal tennis resume includes an NCAA
singles championship from two years
ago, enters this tournament as the No. 1
seed. For good measure, she is also the
top-ranked player in the nation accord
ing to the latest Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
poll.
The 32-player singles event begins
with two rounds today. In the opening
round this morning, Birch will face Alix
Creek of Arizona. Should she win, her
next foe will be either California's Cara
Abe (ranked 68th nationally) or UCLA's
Iwalani McCalla (27th).
Junior Debbie Graham, who follows
Birch in the rankings, will not make the
trip down south to attempt to defend
her 1990 title. All season long, Graham
has battled bursitis in her shoulder and
will rest the weekend. The logic behind
the layoff is that Graham's rocket serve,
a key weapon at NCAAs the past two
seasons, will more likely be available if
she sits out.
But the Cardinal will still have the
No. 2 seed at Pac-lOs in the form of
senior Teri Whitlinger, who is rated as
the eighth-best player in the country.

Whitlinger is slated to meet the Bruins'
crafty Cammie Foley. A win would set
her up to face the Wildcats' Danielle
Klurman or Arizona State's Kristi
Jonkosky.
Sophomore sensation Heather Wil
lens, who Volvo places 18th among colle
gians, is the last of the tourney's eight
seeded players and will square off
against Luann Klimchock of the Sun
Devils. The possible second-round oppo
nents for Willens are Arizona's Banni
Redhair (checking in at 54th) and Cal's
Tiffiny Silveria (96th).
Freshman Laxmi Poruri and junior
Kylie Johnson are also in the main draw.
For Poruri, who meets No. 6-ranked and
third-seeded Lisa Albano in the first
round, Pac-lOs provides a last chance at
the NCAA singles field. Currently
ranked 73rd nationally, Poruri will prob
ably need to beat Albano and win
another couple of matches.
Her second round possibilities are
UCLA veteran Mamie Ceniza (48th in
the nation) and ASU freshman Mered
ith Geiger (87th).
Johnson has the toughest first-round
opponent, in the form of the Bruins'
Kim Po, who the computer places 30th
in the land. An upset of the tourney's
fourth seed would put Johnson up
against Courtney Rose of USC or Lisa
Parks of Cal. Her second-rounder
would, thus, be a relatively easier ride —
should she get to it.
The remainder of the singles seeds
are Arizona's Danielle Scott (No. 10 in
Volvo, fifth seeded at Pac-lOs), the
Golden Bears' Emilie Viqueira (No. 13
and sixth) and UCLA's Stella Sampras
(No. 34 and seventh). Unseeded dark
horses include the Bruins' Kirsten
Dreyer (45th nationally) and ASU's
Krista Amend (32nd).

In the 16-team doubles draw, Stan
ford is represented by No. 2 seeds Poruri
and Whitlinger. The Cardinal tandem
will face Cal's Viqueira and Parks. Wil
lens and Emma freshman Woodhouse
will meet another Cal team, Abe and
Ellen Walliser.
The top-seeded duo is Sampras and
Po of UCLA. Sampras and wWlinger
have each won NCAA doubles crowns,
albeit with partners other than their
current ones.
An invitational tournament com
posed of players not in the main draw
will also be held. Woodhouse and sopho
more Mario Carruth will take part in
that. Carruth will also join Johnson for
doubles in the invitational draw.
Singles quarterfinals and two-rounds
of doubles will take place tomorrow.
Semifinals are Saturday and conference
champions are crowned Sunday.
Card notes
Three of the past four Phc-10 singles
champs won the NCAA crown in the same
year. Patty Fendick in '87, Birch in *89 and
Graham in '90. Una Green the '88 titlist,
reached the NCAA semis.
The Cardinal plays no competitive tennis
after this event until the NCAA Champi
onships, which begin May 8.

the layoff is that Graham's rocket serve,
a key weapon at NCAAs the past two
seasons, will more likely be available if
she sits out.
But the Cardinal will still have the
No. 2 seed at Pac-lOs in the form of
senior Teri Whitlinger, who is rated as
the eighth-best player in the country.

Whitlinger is slated to meet the Bruins'
crafty Cammie Foley. A win would set
her up to face the Wildcats' Danielle
Klurman or Arizona State's Kristi
Jonkosky.
Sophomore sensation Heather Wil
lens, who Volvo places 18th among colle
gians, is the last of the tourney's eight
seeded players and will square off
against Luann Klimchock of the Sun
Devils. The possible second-round oppo
nents for Willens are Arizona's Banni
Redhair (checking in at 54th) and Cal's
Tiffiny Silveria (96th).
Freshman Laxmi Poruri and junior
Kylie Johnson are also in the main draw.
For Poruri, who meets No. 6-ranked and
third-seeded Lisa Albano in the first
round, Pac-lOs provides a last chance at
the NCAA singles field. Currently
ranked 73rd nationally, Poruri will prob
ably need to beat Albano and win
another couple of matches.
Her second round possibilities are
UCLA veteran Mamie Ceniza (48th in
the nation) and ASU freshman Mered
ith Geiger (87th).
Johnson has the toughest first-round
opponent, in the form of the Bruins'
Kim Po, who the computer places 30th
in the land. An upset of the tourney's
fourth seed would put Johnson up
against Courtney Rose of USC or Lisa
Parks of Cal. Her second-rounder
would, thus, be a relatively easier ride —
should she get to it.
The remainder of the singles seeds
are Arizona's Danielle Scott (No. 10 in
Volvo, fifth seeded at Pac-lOs), the
Golden Bears' Emilie Viqueira (No. 13
and sixth) and UCLA's Stella Sampras
(No. 34 and seventh). Unseeded dark
horses include the Bruins' Kirsten
Dreyer (45th nationally) and ASU's
Krista Amend (32nd).

In the 16-team doubles draw, Stan
ford is represented by No. 2 seeds Poruri
and Whitlinger. The Cardinal tandem
will face Cal's Viqueira and Parks. Wil
lens and Emma freshman Woodhouse
will meet another Cal team, Abe and
Ellen Walliser.
The top-seeded duo is Sampras and
Po of UCLA. Sampras and wWlinger
have each won NCAA doubles crowns,
albeit with partners other than their
current ones.
An invitational tournament com
posed of players not in the main draw
will also be held. Woodhouse and sopho
more Mario Carruth will take part in
that. Carruth will also join Johnson for
doubles in the invitational draw.
Singles quarterfinals and two-rounds
of doubles will take place tomorrow.
Semifinals are Saturday and conference
champions are crowned Sunday.
