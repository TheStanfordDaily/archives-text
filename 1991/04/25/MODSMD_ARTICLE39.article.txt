Comparing the Evanses
shows questionable logic
I am dismayed at Cameron Macky's piece
(Daily, April 23), as an academic concerned
about the plight of the student-athlete, as
the mother of a student-athlete and, finally,
as one simply concerned about logic and
respect for truth in journalism.
As did the NCAA, Macky draws a false
equivalency between those collegiate sports
in which the universities choose to provide a
minor-league system gratis as the one and
only route to the lucrative professional
leagues (football, men's basketball), those in
which the university provides one of several
possible routes (baseball, golf) and those in
which there are no lucrative professional
leagues (swimming, track, gymnastics).
The major abuses of the academic system
occur almost exclusively in the first class, for
in the other classes no one needs to pretend
academic involvement to reach their sports
objectives.
Simple facts here:
• Janet Evans knowingly and deliberately

gave up the possibility of the major lucrative
rewards for her sport to come to Stanford.
Never again will she be the tiny sprite sensa
tion she was in 1988, no matter how well she
swims hereafter, and that's what advertise
ment contracts reward for female athletes.
• There was no need for matriculation in
order to be trained by Richard Quick; there
are non-Stanford swimmers currently being
trained by him. In short, matriculation at
Stanford represented only a disadvantage to
Janet with respect to her sport. Can you say
the same for Jerry Evans or any football or
basketball player?
• Janet satisfied Stanford's stringent aca
demic requirements for entry. While at Stan
ford, she carried a course load with content
comparable to non-athletes and her perfor
mance was credible compared to non-ath
letes. Can you say the same for Jerry Evans?
• Now Janet has chosen to stop out as
many other students, athletes or not, do.
Her return is not contingent on her perfor
mance in her sport. Can you say the same for
Jerry Evans?
Are her reasons for stopping out good and
valid? Are they for non-athletes who choose

to stop out? Were the reasons stated to the
press full and frank? Did she give reason and
perhaps choose to suppress others less flat
tering to herself or to associates? Does it
really matter? Does she have less right to
stop out than other non-athlete students?
Those who abuse the collegiate athletic
system have a vested interest in using other
non-abusing sports to shield their abuses.
The case of Jerry Evans well illustrates such
abuse; that of Janet Evans does not.
I have great admiration for the true stu
dent-athlete, who tries to achieve balance
between academic and sports participation,
as I do for those who try to achieve balance
between academic participation and that in
the arts or journalism or whatever.
To make any such efforts more difficult or
impossible, simply to protect abusers is, I
think, contemptible, whether done by the
NCAA or the press.
