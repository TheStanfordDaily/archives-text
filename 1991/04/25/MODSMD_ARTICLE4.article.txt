### Mara Mather Staff writer 
A Stanford student was arrested Sunday morning
after he allegedly broke into Meyer Library and then
tried to run away from Stanford Police officers.
Freshman Jon-Paul Villegas has been charged
with burglary and resisting arrest, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Villegas, 20, was ransacking the information
resources area behind the loan desk when police
arrived on the scene, said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. Villegas, a resident of Toyon Hall,
then "led them in a merry foot pursuit around cam
pus," Niemeyer added.
Police were responding to a silent alarm that Vil
legas allegedly set off at 4:23 a.m.
He was arrested and held in North County Jail.
Police are still waiting for results of blood-alcohol
level tests from the lab, Niemeyer said. Villegas was
released from jail on his own recognizance.
While an office had apparently been "rifled
through, with several drawers way out," nothing in
the library was stolen, said office coordinator Kathy
Fehrn.
According to Niemeyer, Villegas said he came in
because he was bored and a door was ajar.
Fehrn said he "must not have realized we had an
alarm system." Villegas "apparently was not in here
vfery long."
"There could have been an open door," said
Fehrn. "We are trying to repair the problem" as soon
as possible, she added.
Villegas, reached by phone in his dorm room,
declined to comment.
