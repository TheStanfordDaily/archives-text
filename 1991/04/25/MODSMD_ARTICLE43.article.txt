# Students to distribute Haas grant
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Stanford students have a lot to offer — brains,
time and creativity. Now, thanks to a grant from the
Peninsula Community Foundation, they also have
$10,000 to give.
The foundation donated the money this quarter
to the Haas Public Service Center with one stipula
tion: Students must decide which projects will
receive funds.
The foundation gave a similar grant to the Grad
uate School of Business last quarter to be distributed
by students in Professor James Thompson's "Topics
in Philanthropy" class.
The two grants mark the first time such funds
have been designated to be distributed solely by stu
dents in California.
The purpose of the grant is give student insight
about philanthropy and the process of giving money,
said William Somerville, who was executive director
of the foundation when the donation was made. He
is currently president of the Philanthropic Ventures
Foundation in Menlo Park and has served on the
Haas board of directors for four years.
"Philanthropy is a challenge," he said, "It is not
just throwing money out the window."
Organizational meetings were held at Haas last
week for students interested in being on the commit
tee that will distribute the money and for students
who wish to apply for funding from the grant. There
are currently seven students on the distribution
committee.
Any Stanford student may submit a project pro
posal for consideration for funding. "Anybody is eli
gible to apply, and we really want to reach a lot of
people," said senior Mary Kroener, a committee
member.
The criteria for funding was left entirely up to the
students on the committee, she said. The committee
decided that every proposal must be made by a Stan-

ford student, though the project may benefit any
student group or outside agency within the service
area of the Peninsula Community Foundation.
Requests can be for any amount up to $10,000.
Students on the distribution committee are also
eligible to submit proposals but would not take part
in the evaluation of their own projects.
Once the committee selects the recipients, the
money for the projects will be forwarded through the
foundation.
The deadline for submitting proposals to Haas is
May 6; applicants will make oral presentations to the
distribution committee May 9. Decisions will be
announced by May 16.
The distribution committee also will require
grant recipients to be evaluated six months into
their project, Kroener said. The committee will
invite representatives from the Peninsula Commu
nity Foundation to attend the evaluation, although
this is not a condition of the grant arrangement, she
added.
Kroener said the grant project is an excellent
opportunity for students to promote public service
and to learn from experts how to write and evaluate
grant proposals. "It is a way for students to be
involved really at every level of the process," she
added.
Praising the accomplishments in public service of
the Haas center and of Stanford students,
Somerville said, "I would like to see [the money] go
to programs that students feel are worthy of sup
port," he said.
The main purpose of the grant project, he added,
is to impress upon students that philanthropy is not
a "beggar-bestower" relationship, but an investment
in "good people with good ideas that will go far."
Haas will give workshops on how to write grant
proposals. Somerville will participate in several
workshops along with representatives of the David
and Lucille Packard Foundation, the Syntex Corpo
ration and Haas administrators.
