# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S AIRBORNE WEEKLY on a Wing and a Prayer Hang gliding lets you take to the skies 
### Scott McCormack 
a^<"- nee you have
M flown, you will
■ ■ walk the earth
W with your eyes
turned skyward,
for there you have been, and there you
long to return."
So said Leonardo Da Vinci about
his lifelong quest to conquer the skies
— a dream as old as mankind itself.
Da Vinci devoted years striving to
rise above terra firma, but never actu
ally realized his dream. He was a man
before his time.
Today, however, all the bold adven
turer needs to recreate an abbreviated
version of Icarus' and Daedalus' famed

flight is sunscreen, a trusted pair of sunglasses
and a free afternoon.
And an active credit card.
Every child dreams of spreading his or her
arms and soaring among the clouds. Hang glid
ing comes as close to achieving this as possible.
Try it once and chances are you'll be hooked.
The catch is that, as with most addictions,
money is the great obstacle to ecstasy.
Nevertheless, hang gliding is an amazingly
accessible sport. One day's lesson provides a brief
but rich intimation into the realm of winged
creatures.
Mere mention of the term "hang gliding"
often conjures up images of slightly less-than
sane individuals leaping off vast precipices only
to entrust their fate to the mercy of the winds. To
the consternation of some and the relief of oth
ers, however, this is simply not the case.
learning to hang glide is very similar to get
ting your pilot's license; it takes a lot of time and
a lot of money. Jumping off cliffs comes later —

much later.
The sheer exhilaration of experiencing flight
in its purest form, however, makes the invest
ment well worth the damage to your bank
account.
For the first-time glider, an introductory les
son with Mission Soaring Center, the oldest hang
gliding school in the Bay Area, begins with
ground school — little more than a front for
showing tantalizing videos aimed at luring in the
skeptic. The most notable one featured a man
who had trained a hawk to fly alongside the wing
of his glider. (Hawk is a common term used by
enthusiasts for the hang glider).
Upon graduating from ground school, the
class piles into their vehicles and reconvenes at
Scott's Creek, a beach located north of Santa
Cruz on U.S. Highway 1. From there the adven
ture begins.
Phase two of flight school takes place on level
ground. Students learn how to lift the glider and
most importantly how to balance it in the wind.

Students then learn
how to run with the
wind, while maintaining
posture — chest up,
stomach in, head held
high — and balance. "It
was a bit awkward at
first. You just have to
relax and let it come nat
urally," said sophomore
Chris Kane.
"Hang gliding is
very intuitive ... if it
feels right, you're
probably doing it
right," explained j

Roger Watson,
manager of Mission Soaring Center.
Once you have proven your dexteri
ty with the glider, you are ready for the

sand dune — roughly comparable to a bunny hill
at a ski resort. The hardest part of this final phase
of flight school is waiting your turn — the sand
dune is often jammed with beginning gliders
from various schools around the Bay Area. "The
crowds were kind of a pain," complained Kane.
Incidentally, Mission Soaring highly recom
mends hang gliding during the week.
The first flight begins with intense anticipa
tion. You attach your harness into the hanging
straps located just under the center of the two
wings, balance the glider onto your shoulders,
and start to run down the hill. After the first few
steps the wind gently lifts the glider from your
shoulders, taking you with it. Before you realize
what is happening, your legs are wildly dangling
below.

You are now flying.
To steer the hang glider you either
pull the control bar away from you to
gain altitude or towards you to
descend. To turn left you simply guide
the bar in that direction and vice versa.
"It wasn't difficult at all. The glider
needed very little manipulation," said
Kane.
The landing is almost painless; you
do very little other than keep the glid
er level. Gravity naturally pulls the
glider downward during the brief
flight. You just catch yourself with
your legs and start to run again.
There are some notable exceptions
to this however. Several unsuspecting
beginners found themselves catapulted
forward as their gliders nose-dived
into the sand.
Despite the apparent danger, hang

gliding is actually a safe sport, accord
ing to Watson. Mission Soaring has
been offering hang gliding lessons
since 1973 and has not had a single
serious injury; a broken arm is the
worst injury ever sustained, said
Watson.
Upon completion of the first flight,
the novice is congratulated with a pat
on the back, an incredible sense of
exhilaration and a "you're no longer
glued to the ground" from the instruc
tor.
"All I wanted to do was jump again.
It was such an incredible rush," said
Kane.

Mission Soaring Center is currently
offering a special introductory rate of
$60 per lesson. The Center is the largest
hang gliding school in the Bay Area and
instructs over 1,000 students every year.
It is located at 1116 Wrigley Way in
Milpitas, about a half-hour from
Stanford. Reservations can be made by
calling (408) 262-1055.

So said Leonardo Da Vinci about
his lifelong quest to conquer the skies
— a dream as old as mankind itself.
Da Vinci devoted years striving to
rise above terra firma, but never actu
ally realized his dream. He was a man
before his time.
Today, however, all the bold adven
turer needs to recreate an abbreviated
version of Icarus' and Daedalus' famed

flight is sunscreen, a trusted pair of sunglasses
and a free afternoon.
And an active credit card.
Every child dreams of spreading his or her
arms and soaring among the clouds. Hang glid
ing comes as close to achieving this as possible.
Try it once and chances are you'll be hooked.
The catch is that, as with most addictions,
money is the great obstacle to ecstasy.
Nevertheless, hang gliding is an amazingly
accessible sport. One day's lesson provides a brief
but rich intimation into the realm of winged
creatures.
Mere mention of the term "hang gliding"
often conjures up images of slightly less-than
sane individuals leaping off vast precipices only
to entrust their fate to the mercy of the winds. To
the consternation of some and the relief of oth
ers, however, this is simply not the case.
learning to hang glide is very similar to get
ting your pilot's license; it takes a lot of time and
a lot of money. Jumping off cliffs comes later —

much later.
The sheer exhilaration of experiencing flight
in its purest form, however, makes the invest
ment well worth the damage to your bank
account.
For the first-time glider, an introductory les
son with Mission Soaring Center, the oldest hang
gliding school in the Bay Area, begins with
ground school — little more than a front for
showing tantalizing videos aimed at luring in the
skeptic. The most notable one featured a man
who had trained a hawk to fly alongside the wing
of his glider. (Hawk is a common term used by
enthusiasts for the hang glider).
Upon graduating from ground school, the
class piles into their vehicles and reconvenes at
Scott's Creek, a beach located north of Santa
Cruz on U.S. Highway 1. From there the adven
ture begins.
Phase two of flight school takes place on level
ground. Students learn how to lift the glider and
most importantly how to balance it in the wind.

Students then learn
how to run with the
wind, while maintaining
posture — chest up,
stomach in, head held
high — and balance. "It
was a bit awkward at
first. You just have to
relax and let it come nat
urally," said sophomore
Chris Kane.
"Hang gliding is
very intuitive ... if it
feels right, you're
probably doing it
right," explained j

Roger Watson,
manager of Mission Soaring Center.
Once you have proven your dexteri
ty with the glider, you are ready for the

sand dune — roughly comparable to a bunny hill
at a ski resort. The hardest part of this final phase
of flight school is waiting your turn — the sand
dune is often jammed with beginning gliders
from various schools around the Bay Area. "The
crowds were kind of a pain," complained Kane.
Incidentally, Mission Soaring highly recom
mends hang gliding during the week.
The first flight begins with intense anticipa
tion. You attach your harness into the hanging
straps located just under the center of the two
wings, balance the glider onto your shoulders,
and start to run down the hill. After the first few
steps the wind gently lifts the glider from your
shoulders, taking you with it. Before you realize
what is happening, your legs are wildly dangling
below.

You are now flying.
To steer the hang glider you either
pull the control bar away from you to
gain altitude or towards you to
descend. To turn left you simply guide
the bar in that direction and vice versa.
"It wasn't difficult at all. The glider
needed very little manipulation," said
Kane.
The landing is almost painless; you
do very little other than keep the glid
er level. Gravity naturally pulls the
glider downward during the brief
flight. You just catch yourself with
your legs and start to run again.
There are some notable exceptions
to this however. Several unsuspecting
beginners found themselves catapulted
forward as their gliders nose-dived
into the sand.
