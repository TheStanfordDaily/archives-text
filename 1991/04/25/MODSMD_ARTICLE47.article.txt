# FROM THE EDITORS
## 
### 
It's time for a change. We're headed for the big time.
Up until now, this space has been reserved for quasi-humorous, enter
tainment picks of the week. How dry. How tame.
How passi.
But no more.
You see, we've got this new idea for "From the Editors," and we have a
feeling it could be big. Real big. Big enough to be picked up by the nation
al media.
Fame and fortune, here we come.
From now on, the new-and-improved "From the Editors" will abandon
the ordinary entertainment picks of the week and cover only drug picks of
the week.
What information could be more useful?
It's gonna be great. It'll be a scandal.
The New York Times will run our smiling faces on page 8 â€” at least!
What a plan.
And if all this talk of drugs has you thinking about altered states, con
sider attending "States of Mind," a screening of recent thesis films pro
duced by graduates from the Communication Department.
The films have nothing to do with certain members of the Stanford fac
ulty, which is probably a good thing, but they are definitely worth a look.
The first film in "States of Mind," "Twinsburg, OH; Some Kind of
Weird Twin Thing," by Sue Marcoux, was shot at a national twin conven
tion. Or, if you're feeling a bit homesick, "Family Outing to Jesusland," by
Robert Tullis, will also be presented. Tullis' film places a family's discus
sion of their interpersonal relationships in the setting of Idaho's diverse
landscapes. "Just School," the third film being screened, is by Nikki Drap
er and takes place in Jackson, Miss. This work explores the effects of racial
desegregation on three generations of high school students.
"Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century," a
national dance project showcasing the work of innovative black choreog
raphers, is going on now in the City. The festival was founded by a Stan
ford faculty member and runs through Sunday at Theater Artaud. (See
story, page 3.)
Dee-lightful, dee-lovely Dee-Lite plays at the Warfield tonight. Tickets
are $20, but definitely dee-sirable. (See calendar.)
And tomorrow, Swing Into Spring with the Stanford Jazz Program at
the Holiday Inn Grand Ballroom. The Stanford Jazz Band, Palo Alto Jazz
Band and vocal jazz ensemble BAYSIX are all scheduled to perform. (See
story, page 6.)
If the whole issue of fighting words and the Fundamental Standard at
Stanford has you a tad confused, you might want to head to the City on
Monday to attend a media debate titled Free Speech vs. Civil Rights on
Campus. (See calendar.)
And finally, if the decorative walls of Casa Zapata have piqued your
interest in the art of murals, head to Printer's, Inc. on Wednesday to hear
Timothy Drescher talk about his work compiling lists of San Francisco
and East Bay murals, including where they are located, making walking
tours possible.
Farewell.
And don't do anything we wouldn't do.
