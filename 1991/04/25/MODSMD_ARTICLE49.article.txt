Capoeira.
It's more exotic than Fiji.
It's more awe-inspiring than the
Grand Canyon.
It's weirder than "The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show."
But what is it?
Capoeira is a Brazilian fighting
dance that dates back to the 17th cen
tury. Originally developed by slaves as
a way to learn martial arts without the
slaveholders realizing it, Capoiera
today is an occasion for fighting, play
ing, music-making and spirituality to
come together.
In the dance, Capoeiristas, masters
of the Capoeira, dance, sing and pray
to the spirits while musicians and
dancing women circle them. The
energy level rises as one man chal
lenges another; calm dance moves
become dips, kicks and somersaults
and each move symbolizes something.
Danceßrazil, a nine-member
African-Brazilian dance group, will be
performing Capoeira as the finale of
their three-part program in Memorial
Auditorium on Tuesday, April 3. The
program will also include Candomble
and Samba, two other sizzling dances.
In Candomble, a woman fills the
atmosphere with burning incense
while others clean and purify the stage
with sacred doths. Drummers honor
the spirits before beginning the cere
mony, and the festivities commence.
Samba is a dance from the African
cane fields, and is surrounded by an air
of confrontation. Men lunge at one
another with sticks and machetes
while grass-skirted women cheer them
on. Samba, now used as a courting rit
ual, is the national dance of Brazil.

Danceßrazil will hold a
lecture/demonstration on Monday,
April 29 at 7:30 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. The company will also
conduct a dance class at Roble Dance
Studio on Tuesday, April 30, from 2:15
to 3:45 p.m. The class is open to all
community dancers.
