# Health insurance poses problem for student domestic partners
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
Despite the relatively smooth
implementation last fall of the
controversial domestic-partners
policy for students, several
important issues have yet to be
resolved.
Two primary concerns that
remain include equal access to
health insurance for domestic
partners and a full explanation
of the policy in all appropriate
University publications,
according to David Bradfute, a
graduate senator and officer of
Stanford's Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
The landmark domestic
partners policy, passed October
9, extends student-spouse ben
efits to lesbian and gay couples
as well as unmarried hetero
sexuals. Such couples receive
equal access to University

housing, facilities and health
care at Cowell Student Health
Center, like married couples.
Although health insurance
was not included in the original
plan, the University agreed to
work with its insurance broker
to develop a policy, said law stu
dent Julia Friedlander, who
was active in the development
of the policy.
However, the University's
current broker offered a plan
that was simply too "cost pro
hibitive," Meier said. "We are
trying to find an alternative
plan that is affordable," she
added.
Cowell is currently working
with Consumers' Union, a
health-insurance broker based
in Washington, D.C., to develop
such an insurance plan for
domestic partners, according to
Cowell Assoc. Director Jane
Meier.
The University is examining
Consumers' Union's financial
security, she said. If all goes well,
the health plan will be available
by next fall, she said. To be eligi
ble for coverage, both the student
and the domestic partner will
have to sign up for the plan.
Bradfute also expressed con
cern the University has not ade
quately updated its literature to
include the domestic partners pol
icy. "The University hasn't done a
whole lot in updating the litera
ture to reflect the fact that we

have this policy."
According to Bill Georges,
assistant director of the Housing
Center, the University has
included an explanation of the
policy in its graduate housing
booklet and the Student Informa
tion Bulletin. The Registrar's
Office is currently looking at all
other publications to see which
still need updating.
Since the policy's implementa
tion last October, only 10 couples
have registered with the Univer
sity as domestic partners. Of
these only one is a same-sex cou
ple.
This low figure can be
explained by the fact that fall
quarter had already begun when
the policy went into effect, said
Rodger Whitney, director of the

Housing Center. "These are not
representative samples. . . . Most
people had already settled for the
year" by the time the policy was
implemented, he said.
The deadline for graduate
housing applications is not until
May 15, so figures for next fall are
not yet available. However, pre
liminary estimates indicate a rise
in the number of domestic part
ners in the University housing
system, Whitney said.
The University does not
expect itself to be inundated with
requests and is confident that it
will be able to handle all appli
cants. "Supply exceeds demand"
for the one bedroom apartments
for couples, Director of Graduate
Residences Jean Kim said.
