# Health insurance poses problem for student domestic partners
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
Despite the relatively smooth
implementation last fall of the
controversial domestic-partners
policy for students, several
important issues have yet to be
resolved.
Two primary concerns that
remain include equal access to
health insurance for domestic
partners and a full explanation
of the policy in all appropriate
University publications,
according to David Bradfute, a
graduate senator and officer of
Stanford's Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
The landmark domestic
partners policy, passed October
9, extends student-spouse ben
efits to lesbian and gay couples
as well as unmarried hetero
sexuals. Such couples receive
equal access to University

housing, facilities and health
care at Cowell Student Health
Center, like married couples.
Although health insurance
was not included in the original
plan, the University agreed to
work with its insurance broker
to develop a policy, said law stu
dent Julia Friedlander, who
was active in the development
of the policy.
However, the University's
current broker offered a plan
that was simply too "cost pro
hibitive," Meier said. "We are
trying to find an alternative
plan that is affordable," she
added.
Cowell is currently working
with Consumers' Union, a
health-insurance broker based
in Washington, D.C., to develop
such an insurance plan for
domestic partners, according to
