Black Choreographers Moving
Toward the 21st Century will
be held at the Theater Artaud,
at 450 Florida Street, San Fran
cisco, from April 24 through
April 27. Tickets, available at
BASS Ticketmaster, are $16
and $18. For more information,

What do a black, Creole woman; a
10-ton, one-eyed crane; and the music
of Jimi Hendrix have in common? And
what do they have to do with Stanford?
All are components of this year's
Black Choreographers Moving Toward
the 21st Century Dance Festival, a pro
gram founded by a Stanford faculty
member.
Halifu Osumare, Stanford dance
faculty member and the former pro
gram coordinator of Stanford's Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts,
founded the annual festival, which
opened yesterday in San Francisco, in
1987, after two years of planning.
Now an ex-choreographer and
dancer, Osumare founded Black
Choreographers Moving because she
"found that a lot of [her] own work
and the work of her colleagues was not
given proper recognition and atten
tion.
"I found that to be the case for
many other black choreographers,

especially if they lived outside New
York.," she said. "I wanted to galvanize
public attention around black chore
ographers and their work.
"I wanted to showcase their work in
a festival format, both to introduce
their work to critics and the general
public. And also so the artists them
selves get a chance to look at each
other's work," said Osumare.
The festival is part of a national
dance project showcasing innovative
black American choreographers.
Most of the artists perform what
would be called "contemporary dance"
or "fusion dance," which borrows
techniques from a broad range of
dance, from classical ballets to African
dance and rhythms. According to
Osumare, "they do it all."
Included in this year's festival is
"The Hendrix Project," by Bebe Miller
and Company, featuring the music of
Jimi Hendrix. Miller describes the
work as "not about hope, not about
hype ... but about the raw, vivid
utterly necessary ideas and convictions
of people today."

And Joanna Haigood's untitled
piece about the complex and tenuous
relationship between people and
industrialization will use a 10-ton,
one-eyed crane.
"I've found that audiences respond
very positively to the performance.
These works challenge their concep
tion of what dance is; they focus on the
future and new ideas; they're not just a
rehash of what's been done before,"
said Osumare.
Other works to be performed this
year include David Rousseve's "Col
ored Children Flyin' By," which is the
third in a series of pieces that juxtapose
the life stories of an elderly, black, Cre
ole woman with stories and images of
the social realities of a modern
African-American.
"Ye Who Seeks Balance in the Midst
of Chaos Shall Rise to a Warrior's
Stance," a work by Nia Love-Pointer,
was inspired by the power of the Baka
people who inhabit the rain forest of
Cameroon.
Each year the artists are different.
"The choreographers are extremely

innovative," said Osumare.
The coordinators of the festival
"hear about artists through national
networks," and "invite people into the
festival based on what they've heard,"
according to Osumare. "There's no big
national application."
Artists attend from across the
country. This year only one Bay Area
artist will be performing in the San
Francisco festival.
