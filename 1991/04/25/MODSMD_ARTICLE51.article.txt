# Strife and soul-searching in South Africa
## 
### 
"Dark Sun" is playing at the
Stage Door Theater in San
Francisco. Tickets are $10-$29,
and are available from the
American Conservatory The
ater, call 749-2ACT.
You are trapped in a room from
which there is no escape.
In the corner opposite you is another
person — the only other inhabitant of
the room. The two of you do not speak
the same language. Above each of your
heads is a clock; in one of the clocks —
you don't know which — a time bomb is
set to go off in exactly one hour.
Each of you has a switch that could
disconnect the time bomb, but pulling
either switch could result in electrocu
tion. Trying to save the other person's
life could therefore kill you, or it could
save both of you. If neither of you does
anything, both of you are certain to die.
What do you choose to do?
This is the question posed to Simon
in "Dark Sun," a play about racial strife
in South Africa in 1988, a time that has
been called "one of the bleakest in the
country's recent history" by play
wright Lisette Lecat Ross.
Simon, a black man, has rescued
Lydia, a middle-class, white woman,
from the bombing and stoning of the
bus she was traveling on, and the two
are seeking refuge in Simon's small
home in Soweto. They are hiding
inside, away from the gunfire and riots
that are rocking the town, when Lydia
presents Simon with the above sce
nario.
"That's my choice?" says Simon, "I
can die or I can get killed?"
"Not can. Could," says Lydia.

"Depends on who the other person
is."
"A white male."
"Then we're both going to die."
The characters are two
very different human
beings caught in an
extremely desperate situa
tion.
"But you're not supposed to use
real people. It's an abstract problem."
Ross, herself born and raised in
South Africa, knows well the antago
nism between the races. Her insight
into South Africa's history and prob
lems brims with first-hand knowledge
and precisely tuned emotion.
Her writing is beautiful, compas
sionate and philosophical, and her
play works extraordinarily well
because her characters are two very
different human beings caught in an
extremely desperate situation. Her
characters occasionally speak in their
native language, adding an element of
reality to "Dark Sun."
And the authenticity of the play is
enhanced by outstanding acting. Seth
Sibanda, also a native of South Africa,
plays the gentle, soul-searching Simon.
Sibanda has a wonderfully expressive
range; his actions and reactions
resound with depth; his emotions are
personalized. Whether speaking of his
dead son Lucas' love of astronomy, or
intelligently contesting the South
African political system, his delivery is
powerful and moving.
Lynne Soffer, who assumed the role
of Lydia when the original actress
broke her leg a week before the open
ing, is also superb. She gives a near
perfect portrayal of a woman whose
ideas and beliefs have been shaped by a
powerful system that can't tolerate,
and tries to obliterate, all opposition.
Lydia's difficult realization that there is
a perspective other than her own leaves
her a changed woman, and Soffer
makes this journey believable.
Edward Hastings' clear direction
delineates the conftised violence that
abounds in South Africa. He and
everyone involved in "Dark Sun,"
deliver content and quality — with
guts.
And the bomb is still ticking...
