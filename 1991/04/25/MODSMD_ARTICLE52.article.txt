## Ain't no place like New Yawk 
### 
"Queens Logic," starring John
Malkovich, Joe Mantegna,
Kevin Bacon, Ken Olin, Chloe
Webb and Linda Fiorentino
Every good reporter tries her best
to be objective, to ignore all personal
feelings that might interfere with her
ability to write an unbiased story, or
even a review.
I am not a good reporter.
I decided I liked "Queens Logic" as
soon as I saw the advertisement for it,
and nothing could change my mind.
Not the poor reviews it received
from the San Jose Mercury, the San
Francisco Chronicle and The New
York Times. After all, I don't trust
newspapers.
Not the poor reviews it received
from my parents, my sister and my
aunt. After all, I don't trust relatives.
Not even the poor reviews it would
have received from me had I not
decided I was going to like it. After all,
I don't trust me.
As far as I was concerned, "Queens
Logic" couldn't be bad.
And I'll tell you why.
It's not because it reminded me of
"Diner," because I've never seen it. It's
not because it reminded me of "The
Big Chill," because I've never seen that
either. (Really, it's true; I grew up in a
closet.) And it's definitely not because
it reminded me of "The In-Laws,"
because the two are nothing alike.
It's because of two things.
One: John Malkovich. The man can
do no wrong. I don't care if he wears a
toupee or not, if he speaks with a
Queens accent or not, or if he plays a
homosexual or not — he's an acting
stud. That wit, that sarcasm, that cyni
cal attitude: I love him. Madly. More
than chocolate.
Well, almost.
Two: New York. I'm a New Yorker
(perhaps you guessed this), and
"Queens Logic" made me feel nostal
gic. Granted, I'm from the suburbs,
never had any friends who spoke with
"New Yawk" accents and couldn't find
Queens if I stalled near the "Welcome
to Queens" sign on the highway, but
that's not the point.
Seeing the Empire State Building,
the Chrysler Building and the Brook
lyn Bridge made me think about hang
ing out on the stoop with my buddies.
I never actually did this, but the movie
made me think about it.
"Queens Logic" has some plot

flaws, some character flaws and some
flaws in general, but I don't care.
There's no place like home.
