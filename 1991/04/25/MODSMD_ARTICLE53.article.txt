"La Femme Nikita," starring
Anne Parillaud
"La Femme Nikita" adds a new
twist to the James Bond genre of secret
agent films. Unlike Agent 007, whose
appeal is predominantly based on his
sexy and debonair style, Nikita capti
vates the audience with her over
whelming vivaciousness.
When the film opens, Nikita waits
in an almost comatose state as her
derelict friends rob a drug store to sup
ply her with another fix. They are dis
covered by the police, however, and
Nikita snaps out of her trance long
enough to shoot an officer.
After resisting both her arrest and
sentencing, Nikita is "recruited" by the
French government to join its secret
agent program. At this point, as well as
several others, the plot fails because it
is inexplicable.
Nikita's dire situation allows the
government to fake her death and
force her into the program. But it is
incomprehensible why the govern
ment would choose to employ a rebel
lious, drug-addicted teenager.
Yet, despite the plot's downfalls,
Nikita's character salvages the film.
Her zest for life makes the character
extremely likable. As a result, the audi
ence sympathizes with her plight as
she struggles to find happiness while
maintaining two secret identities.
Nikita's lack of inhibitions constantly
brings about humorous circumstances
as she beats up one man and then asks
the next to have sex with her.
The film has been called an action
flick for feminists. However, the femi
nist message is downplayed by the
female government agent who teaches
Nikita to look fragile and smile.
Nikita becomes transformed from
an awkward teenager into a beautiful
woman. But unlike James Bond, who
often relies on his sex appeal for infor
mation, Nikita does not use her beauty
to seduce men in her job as a secret
agent. The power of her role is that she
can adopt a masculine role without

assuming a masculine character. She
can bring home the bacon, fry it up in
a pan, but never lets you forget that she
is a woman.
This film is well-suited for people
who like action flicks in which the
main focus is not violence. The appeal
of Nikita's character creates tension
and excitement in the audience, and
the music and visual effects contribute
to this intensity.
However, the confusing plot and
the outrageousness of Nikita's charac
ter may lead others to find this film
ridiculous. And the translation fails to
capture the humor and tone present in
the original French.
