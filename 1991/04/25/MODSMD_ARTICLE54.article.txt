"Ju Dou," starring Gong Li and
Li Bao-Tian
"Ju Dou" is an erotically charged
tragedy from China that could easily
be a distant cousin of "The Postman
Always Rings Twice." It is a gorgeously
filmed melodrama that captivates its
audience more out of sheer artistic
beauty than it does out of dramatic
content. While parts of the story are
implausible and overly dramatic, the
film as a whole is haunting and pic

turesque.
Set in rural China in the 19205, the
film tells the story of Ju Dou, a beauti
ful young woman who is purchased by
a tyrannical dye-mill owner for the
sole purpose of procuring a son. The
old man is impotent, and he takes out
his frustrations on Ju Dou, brutally
beating her and blaming her for not
producing an heir.
Close to dying from pain and grief,
Ju Dou seduces the mill owner's shy
nephew and begins a passionate affair.
When she becomes pregnant with his
child, she tells her husband that the
baby is actually his. This sets the stage
for later complications, and the rest of
the film deals with the peculiar and
unjust workings of fate and the impas
sioned young couple's fight to stay
together in a repressive, puritanical
society.
Set almost entirely in the dye mill,
"Ju Dou" is awash in bright reds, yel
lows, oranges and blues. Using sun
light and the colorful cloths that
stream through the mill, director
Zhang Yi-Mou creates a mystical,
slightly surreal environment that can
be as menacing as it is lovely.
In one brilliant sequence, a love
scene is juxtaposed with the mill's
spinning blood-red machinations,
resulting in a highly erotic, stunning
image.
Unfortunately, artfully composed
shots alone do not make a great film.
"Ju Dou" suffers from the same far

fetched melodramatics that made
Kevin Costner's "Revenge" —
intended to be a drama — an all-out
laugh fest.

get any worse for the film's devoted

couple, they are plagued by an even
greater tragedy. However, rather than
flee their oppressive environment, Ju
Dou and her lover remain, facing per
secution by the entire town. There is
no reason for such stubbornness other
than to allow a more disastrous out
come for the lovers.
Nevertheless, with sparse dialogue
and little music, "Ju Dou" quietly tells

a richly textured tale of forbidden pas
sion and its dire consequences.
