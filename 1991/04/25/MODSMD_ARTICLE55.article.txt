"Object of Beauty," starring
John Malkovich and Andie
MacDowell
Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg has
created a monster.
"Object of Beauty" is thoroughly
unenjoyable. This film has absolutely
no redeeming qualities. Well, I take
that back. Andie MacDowell's hair
looks lovely. But, you'd be better off
just looking at her L'Oreal ads; they're
much less boring.
I feel much better now that I have
that off my chest.
Now for the details.
"Object of Beauty" is the story of
lake (John Malkovich) and Tina (the
hairdo queen mentioned above). The
film is supposed to be a romantic com
edy, as far as I can tell. The necessary
ingredients are there — standard het
erosexual couple, lack of dramatic
content, contrived plot manipulations
— but the genre is still questionable.
The film just isn't funny or romantic.
What are we left with then? I'll tell you.
We are presented with exceedingly
decadent, whiny, unlikable characters;
vapid dialogue; minimal story line;
and grating background music. (I
don't usually notice the music in
movies, but because the dialogue was
so boring, my ears wandered into this
treacherous territory.) Like I said, this
movie has no redeeming qualities.
Jake is a greedy, misogynous yuppie
who is living well beyond his means in
a plush London hotel. I'm not quite
sure exactly what he does for a living,
but he loses all of his money while on
the telephone conducting some
ambiguous business deal. He's left with
plenty of overcharged credit cards and
a stunning companion.
Tina is a materialistic, champagne
guzzling divorcee. Though she claims
that she loves Jake, it isn't clear that
she's capable of such an emotion. Not
to mention the fact that he's really not
worth loving in the first place.
These two unbearably annoying
characters come together in an equally
irritating relationship which doesn't
improve when they lose all of their
money. The traumatic event does
nothing to restore intelligence or dig
nity to this irksome couple.
This is a movie that isn't even wor
thy of rental. MacDowell's hair just
isn't worth the three bucks, let alone
the $6.50 you'll pay at the theater. But,
if you like John Malkovich, I hear
"Queen's Logic" is pretty good.
