If California were a woman, her
history would be fine fodder for a
Danielle Steele novel — an innocent
maiden, lush and promising, is raped,
abused and corrupted by men in
search of paradise.
California is no woman, though.
And, fortunately, Steele has left state
history alone.
The Golden State's transformation
from innocence to experience has been
chronicled, however, by the literary
heavyweights, including Bret Harte,
Mark Twain, Evelyn Waugh and Wal
lace Stegner.
Some of their California classics, as
well as works by a variety of other
noted writers, are included in an
anthology of California-centric fiction
called, unsurprisingly, "Great Califor
nia Stories."
The collection is organized chrono
logically, and begins appropriately
with a Miwok Indian story called
"Mouse Steals Fire." The "Mouse" tale
explains how the tribe got fire, and
why the various tribes speak different
languages.
Fragmentation, verbal and social,
works as a strong image throughout
this piece, and paves the way themati
cally for the breakdown of California's
natural innocence.
"The Vengeance of Padre Arroyo,"
by Gertrude Atherton, is the story of
two young lovers, Andreo and Pilar,
who arc forbidden to marry for a year.
The impatient pair runs away together,
gets caught, and is punished in a
delightfully surprising way.
Atherton's musical writing works
well to capture the peaceful, yet color
ful life of the Chicano Californios.
A double-header from Mark Twain
follows, including the classic "Cele
brated Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County." More in the theme of the col
lection as a whole, however, is "The
Outcasts of Poker Flat" by Twain's con
temporary Bret Harte.
Social outcasts — a gambler, a
thief, two hookers and a pair of lovers
— die, snow-bound in a forest. And it

is only after the outcasts are dead that
mainstream society can accept them.
As the image of California-as-
Promised-Land fades like an ember,
the gulch between outcasts and the
mainstream widens. Harte's misfits
become Wallace Stegner's urban poor
in "Pop Goes the Alley Cat."
Fiction has changed, though, in the
century between Harte and Stegner,
and so has California. There is no
more forest in which to banish the
undesirables. Rather, Stegner's two
main characters, Carol Vaughn and
Charlie Prescott, a social worker and a
photographer, set about to reincorno

rate the outcasts into the productive
mainstream.
Stegner combines gritty, vivid
images of squalor, sickness and starva
tion with moving dialogue to show
how two people bravely decide "not to
put limits on love — if love is what you
choose to live by."
The contrast of Stegner's California
with that of the Miwok legend is
painful. Somewhere along the time
line, simplicity and natural beauty was
lost. Yet, as the collection so
poignantly reveals, in the loss of inno
cence there is wisdom, somehow beau
tiful in its clarity.
