Sitting in a grassy park outside of
Reno, Nev., I noticed a group of
small girls clustered behind me, star
ing intently and whispering to one
another.
As I finished greasing my bicycle
chain, a small blonde figure emerged
from the group and approached me
with a determined stride, followed
timidly by her playmates.
"Are you a girl?" she asked accus
ingly.
"Yes," I replied, smiling with
amusement and no small amount of
confusion.
"Then why are you fixing a bike?"
she demanded.
Surrounded by five male friends,
1 was indeed the only woman fixing
my bicycle at the moment. Since I
was cycling cross-country with a
coed group, I had grown accus
tomed to both men and women
doing their own bike maintenance,
and thought little of its gender
implications.
But, to these young girls, it was
contradictory and confusing for a
'girl' to have grease-covered hands
and a tool box.
For the first, but certainly not the
last time, I became glaringly aware
of the fact that I was a woman.
Accustomed to the egalitarian rela
tions among my companions, I had
difficulty adjusting to the sexism
and gender expectations I encoun
tered in my travels.
And my travel experiences are
not unique.
Particularly when traveling
abroad, but also within the United
States itself, women may unknow
ingly violate cultural expectations,
ignorant even of which actions are
seen as inappropriate or indecent.
Cultural conflicts are more numer
ous, more complex and frequently
more threatening for women than
they are for men.
Counsel on cultural sex roles and
advice on handling such conflicts,
then, are much-needed resources for
the female traveler, and they are pro
vided in "Women Travel," an essen
tial guide book for women itching to
see the world. Anecdotes chronicling
women's experiences are combined
with both general and country
specific travel advice in the book,
which is geared toward the woman
exploring on her own or with a
child.

This unconventional work com
bines amateur travel writing with

the informative aspects of a guide
book. Details on safe transportation
and accommodations, as well as
women's resources, such as feminist
organizations and bookstores, are
provided for 70 countries, two
thirds of which are undeveloped
"Third World" nations.
Most of the women whose expe
riences fill the pages of "Women
Travel" are not professional writers;
they were abroad for different rea
sons. Some were immersing them
selves in a foreign culture, others
were furthering political causes.
Some were seeking employment and
permanently relocating, others were
merely taking a vacation.
And while the experiences of
some women, such as those strug
gling with immigration laws, may be
of questionable use to a transient
vacationer, other offerings are
invaluable, such as tactics for
deflecting unwanted sexual advances
and dealing with corrupt local offi
cials.
Unlike most generic guide books,
"Women Travel" addresses the little
discussed issue of racism encoun
tered by non-white women when
traveling outside (and within) the
West.
When traversing Australia, a
country that has oppressed, institu

tionalized and all but exterminated
black Aborigines, Valerie Mason
lohn, a London-based journalist,
found herself refused food service in
bus and train stations.
"Anyone who says only blond
hair, blue eyes and fair skin are a
hazard for female travelers is a
comedian," wrote Mason-John.
"Black women traveling in Western
attire in Islamic and black countries
are considered bizarre, while in
white countries we're regarded as a
novelty or exotic."
The fascinating adventures and
the exhilarating sense of empower
ment achieved by the contributors
to "Women Travel" will inspire you
to mark your map, pack your bags
and depart tomorrow. And they
provide the resources and encour
agement to reassure you in your
decision.
However, as the book warns, a
woman traveling alone is frequently
viewed as an oddity, even an outrage
in many countries. Anyone consid
ering such a solo venture should be
prepared to deflect the pity and sus
picion they are bound to evoke in
family-oriented cultures such as
those of Italy or Mexico, as well as
the traditional Moslem societies of
the Middle East.
