# Spring awakening for Stanford Jazz Program
## 
### Tracy Shinn 
The Stanford Jazz Program has
been given an offer it can't refuse:
Raise $10,000 by August 31, or it's all
over.
That's the ultimatum, the stark
reality facing the jazz program. No
money, no music.
The Stanford Committee for Jazz,
which created the University program
in 1983 and has funded it since then,
has taken on this challenge and is cur
rently working to raise the desperately
needed funds.
Its biggest push has been for the
second annual Swing into Spring Big
Band Dance and Concert, to be held
this Friday evening at the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn. All of the proceeds from
the big bash will benefit the jazz pro
gram.
Popular jazz artists Smith and Gail
Dobson, pianist and vocalist, will per
form with the Stanford Jazz Band, a
cappella acappella group BAYSIX and

the Palo Alto Jazz Band.
The Dobsons' performing careers
have included sold-out concerts at the
Kuumbwa lazz Center and the Mon
terey Jazz Festival, in addition to fre
quent performances at San Jose's
major jazz club, Garden City. Their

Ardith-Grace Ibanez — Daily
special benefit performance this Friday
insures a great night of dancing and
listening.
There will also be a complimentary
buffet, a no-host bar and musical door
prizes at the benefit, donated by ABcM
Records, Columbia Jazz and Polydor
Records.
The Stanford Jazz Program sup
ports the study and performance of
jazz at Stanford. It recognizes the
uniqueness of jazz as a truly American,
and particularly African-American, art

form which should not be missing
from any universities' course offerings.
The program offers courses in jazz
history and theory, supports the jazz
band and combos, and sponsors fac
ulty and student concerts. The Com
mittee for Jazz at Stanford has also
brought jazz greats like Stan Getz, Joe
Pass, Diane Schuur and The Manhat
tan TYansfer to Stanford for perfor
mances.
The Stanford Jazz Program pro
vides valuable resources to the campus
community, and the Stanford Com
mittee for Jazz is making every attempt
to save it. Unfortunately, one class,
Advanced Jazz Theory, already had to
be canceled this quarter.
Hopefully, fund-raisers like this
year's Swing Into Spring will be able to
save the rest of the program for the
future.

Tickets for Swing Into Spring are avail
able at the Tresidder Box Office, $35 for
general admission, $15 for students.
