# These comic books are worth more than a look
## 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
I was a deprived child.
Sure, I had my own room, lots of toys and tons of
clothing, but my life was still lacking something.
Comic books.
My mother wouldn't let me buy comic books —
any comic books. Not because they were too violent,
or because they objectified women, or because they
weren't based on reality. She wouldn't let me buy
comic books because she said I would finish them in
about five minutes and never read them again. And
she was probably right.
She said it would be a waste of time and money.
And she was probably right.
Why are mothers always right?
But the last laugh is mine, because, this weekend,
I'm going to "waste" my time and money on as many
comics as I can. And where am I going to do this? At
the fifth annual Wonder-Con, Northern California's

largest celebration of comic books and animation.
Wonder-Con returns to the Oakland Convention
Center on Friday, April 26 and continues through
Sunday, April 28. That's not a whole lot of time,
especially because there's a whole lot of stuff to do
and see.
For example, featured guests at Wonder-Con
include Kevin Eastman, co-creator of the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles; Tom DeFalco, editor in chief
of Marvel Comics; Jim Lee, artist extrordinaire of X-
Men; Julius Schwartz, editor of Superman; and many
more of the people who made your childhood (but
not mine) what it was.
In addition, admission to Wonder-Con gets you
exclusive peaks at "Rocketeer," Walt Disney Studio's
upcoming summer blockbuster. Dave Stevens, cre
ator of the comic book on which the movie is based
(he's also the co-executive producer of the film), will
show clips from "Rocketeer" and a slide show about
its production.
Wonder-Con will also be presenting sneak pre

views of other soon-to-be-released films such as
"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," starring the ever
popular Kevin Costner; "Terminator II," starring the
ever-strong Arnold Schwarzenegger; and "Beauty
and the Beast," starring the ever-so-colorful ani
mated characters of Disney, and featuring music by
Howard Ashmann, the man behind "The Little Mer
maid" soundtrack.
And, of course, there will be comics. Over 200
tables full of comics and other comic-related col
lectibles such as trading cards, animation cells,
movie posters, original comic book artwork — you
name it. If it has to do with comics, and it hasn't been
destroyed in a freak accident of nature, it will be at
Wonder-Con. And so will I.
So there, Mom.

Wonder-Con tickets purchased in advance cost $9 a
day, $20 for three days. Tickets purchased at the door
cost $10 a day,25 for three days. For more informa
tion, call 352-5841.
