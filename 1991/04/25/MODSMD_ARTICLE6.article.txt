# Hospital to lay off 57 employees
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
One year after eliminating more than 300 jobs,
Stanford Hospital announced Tuesday that it will
lay off another 57 employees as part of continuing
budget cutbacks.
Of the people being laid off, 10 are managers and
the other 47 are "support personnel" who occupy
mostly clerical positions, said hospital spokesperson
Spyros Andreopoulos. The personnel cuts will be
made by May.
Andreopoulos said the layoffs will not affect
nurses or other personnel who work directly with
patients.
"These are essentially very small changes. The
major layoffs occurred last year," Andreopoulos said,
when the hospital cut 384 jobs.
The 57 layoffs are among 160 positions that will
be eliminated between now and August. Employees
who are retiring or leaving the hospital will account
for the rest of the cuts, Andreopoulos said.
The recent layoffs are part of a continuing budget
re-evaluation process begun last year by Hospital
President Kenneth Bloem to make the hospital
"more competitive" with other area hospitals,
Andreopoulos said. Bloem was unavailable for com
ment yesterday afternoon.
The hospital cut $29 million from its budget last
year, and the budget will be reduced by an additional
$18 million between now and August, Andreopoulos
said. Revenue for the hospital this year is predicted
to be $326.8 million.
The $18 million reduction will actually be accom
plished by $16 million in cuts and $2 million in
increased revenue from new programs.
The cuts involve $11 million in savings from the
reduced number of staff positions and $5 million in
cutbacks in materials and services, Andreopoulos
said.
"Like all hospitals, [Stanford] found itself being
managed the old way and needed to examine its bud
get," Andreopoulos said. He would not speculate
when the hospital administration will complete the
budget cuts but said it is all part of a "continuing
process."
Malinda Mitchell, vice president for operations,
said the hospital will provide help to employees in
finding new jobs. Neither Mitchell nor Andreopoulos
said they heard any complaints about job assistance
from the support staff laid off last year.
Mitchell added that some employees losing their
current job will still work at the hospital. Many will
be hired to work in other departments that have
openings.
The hospital's costs to patients are higher than
both community and local teaching hospitals,
Andreopoulos said.
Reduced reimbursement from government agen
cies and private insurers to the hospital is a major
factor in forcing the budget cuts, Mitchell said.
In their negotiations with hos
pitals, including Stanford Hospi
tal, many insurance companies
have agreed to pay discounted
rates. In return, they have guar
anteed the hospitals business, off
setting some of the revenue drop.
Mitchell said she could not
speculate if more cuts will be nec
essary next year because it is dif
ficult to predict the amount of
money that will be paid by those
two sources.
"We try to anticipate what the
revenues will be and stop hiring
instead of laying off employees,
but it is somewhat unpre
dictable," Mitchell said.

The hospital is also working to
increase revenues by increasing
the volume of patients, Mitchell
said.
Some of the new programs
designed to bring in additional
patients include a new surgery
center, short-stay surgical units
and an expanded organ-trans
plant program, according to
Andreopoulos.
Mitchell said the two basic
budget goals for the hospital will
be to increase the volume of
patients and keep costs down,
possibly allowing "the creation of
jobs even with less reimburse
ment."
"We have started a quality
management process," Mitchell
said. "We want to work more effi
ciently and smarter and eliminate
redundancies across depart
ments."
