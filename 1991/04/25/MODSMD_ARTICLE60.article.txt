# Now everyone can read the writing on the wall
## Graffiti goes mainstream with exhibit 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
You say potato, I say potahto.
You say tomato, I say tomahto.
You say graffiti, I say art.
Art? Yes, art.
No longer is graffiti confined to
brick walls and trains; no longer is
it considered a crime. Now, those
one-name, phantom artists whose
work you viewed from your car on
the freeway have been brought
together for an exhibit.
And you can see it inside a
building.
The Mexican Museum in San
Francisco is featuring a collection
of large-scale paintings by graffiti
artists from Los Angeles and the
Bay Area. And though you may not
think you do, you may very well
know some of their names: Slick,
Hex, Mandoe, Duke and Skill.
The exhibit, titled "Burning
Desire: Art of the Spray Can," was
originally organized by United
Latinos for the Arts, Los Angeles
for presentation at Pico House
Galeria in 1989. Pico House pro
gram consultant and artist Eriberto
and gallery director Angelica Gon
zales conceived of the idea of a
"graffiti exhibit" while observing
artists painting on public walls.
The two thought the artists' tal
ent could be better used to address
serious issues, such as child abuse,
war and, somewhat ironically, pol
lution. They challenged the young
artists to put their energy to good
use, and the result was "Burning

Desire."
Gonzales says she and Eriberto
envisioned the exhibit as an oppor
tunity for graffiti artists to posi
tively channel their energies for the
benefit of the community.
"We hope that, by painting the
world we see and hear, we will
awaken people to come together for
positive changes," said Gonzales.
Mexican Museum curator Holly
Barnet-Sanchez seconds the opin
ion that "Burning Desire" can be
more than just a collection of pretty
pictures.
"It is hoped that 'Burning
Desire' will contribute to increasing
the public's awareness and under
standing of the complexities and
possibilities of [graffiti], as well as
to encourage these young artists to
continue to expand their bound
aries of self-representation," said
Barnet-Sanchez.
The Mexican Museum has
expanded the original 1989 exhibit
by inviting San lose artist Aladdin
to contribute new works, and by
adding new paintings by Duke. In
addition, the museum has planned
several programs to run in con
junction with the exhibit, including
a free demonstration by the artists
themselves.

"Burning Desire" will be on exhibit
at the Mexican Museum, located in
Building D of the Fort Mason Center
in San Francisco, from May 1
through July 28. Tickets are $2, $1
for students. For information, call
441-0445.
