# Romanian student envisions democratic rule
## 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld 
After the Romanian revolution of
December 1989, thousands of people
assembled every day in University
Square in Bucharest to hear people like
Marian Munteanu, a 28-year-old philol
ogy student, talk about democracy.
But by the next June, the democratic
movement had been crushed and
Munteanu was in jail.
Last night in Branner, before about
50 people, Munteanu recounted the days
of bitter disappointment and expressed
his hopes for the future.
"The majority of people in the street
[in December] were young people," he
said. "When the democratic process
started, the youths were still very
active." Their demands included a new
legislative system, a democratic consti
tution, government respect for human
rights, an independent television station
and rapid economic reforms.
"When the [Junel protests started,
the [newly electedl government didn't
act in a democratic way. It responded
with violence," Munteanu said.
He showed a videotape filmed last
June of peaceful demonstrators being
beaten, with their bodies lying in the
streets.
"It's an old man," he said, describing
a portion of the tape, "I never under
stood why they beat him."
Munteanu believes that even though
the ruling party, the National Salvation
Front, claims to be anti-communist, "It
uses communist tactics."
"Communism is not just an ideology.

It's a way ofleadinga country — specific
methods aimed at destroying the indi
vidual," he added.
Munteanu explained the Front's vic
tory in the May 1990 elections by its
total control of the only television sta
tion in the country. The station is the
main source of information for Romani
ans. "How can you have a fair election
when every day the television tells you
the Front is the only hope for Romania,"
Munteanu asked.
Munteanu led the Romanian Student
League until his violent arrest in June.
He was released from jail several months
later.
"The league tried to do something not
just for student life, but also to have a
role in society," he said. He described its
action as being political in a non-parti
san sense and said it seeks a balanced
society in which no single party should
rule. "We've already had [a one-party
system] for 45 years," he said.
Recent government polls show the
Romanian people are less and less satis
fied with their government. "If the offi
cial figure says 30 percent [would vote
for the Frontl, then it's probably 15,"
Munteanu said.
"What happened last year proved that
the youths are clearly decided to do
everything for the realization of a regime
as democratic as possible," Munteanu
said. This, he added, also means rebuild
ing the educational system of the coun
try. The students, in his view, must take
the initiative and act in place of an inef
fective Ministry of Education.
