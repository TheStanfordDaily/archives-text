# Navy slashes rate to 55½ percent
## Stanford slammed on indirect costs 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy delivered a punishing blow
to the University yesterday, terminating
more than 90 accounting agreements and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost rate to
55.5 percent.
The decision was announced after
negotiations between Stanford and Office
of Naval Research representatives broke
down without a settlement. The negotia
tions, which lasted several weeks, were
intended to resolve much of the contro
versy that has erupted over Stanford's
research costs.
"We regret this action," University
President Donald Kennedy said in a state
ment yesterday.
The two parties will review the rate
again before the books for this year are
finally closed, but such a review won't
take place for at least another year. By

that point, Stanford officials hope to have
developed new cost studies that will jus
tify higher recovery.
However, the timing of the process
ensures that the short-term economic
damage to the University will be
extremely severe.
University administrators declined to
offer specific figures on the impending
budgetary shortfall yesterday.
But calculations based on past figures
provided by the administration suggest
the short-term situation will be rather
bleak. Each one-point drop in the indi
rect-cost rate translates into a $1.25 mil
lion loss in revenue for the University as
a whole.
The University originally budgeted for
a rate of 78 percent for this year. Yester
day's decision means the University will
receive roughly $28 million less in indi
rect-cost recovery than it originally
planned.

Provost James Rosse is expected to
announce several budgetary actions to
the Faculty Senate on Thursday. Prior to
yesterday's move by the Navy, the Uni
versity had been expecting an operating
budget deficit in excess of $5.5 million
this year.
The slashed indirect-cost rate is
expected to add at least another $12 mil
lion to that figure. The rest of the hit will
be taken by the Medical School, which
keeps a portion of the cost recovery gener

ated by research conducted there.
"There's cause for serious concern,"
Rosse said in a brief interview last night,
"but it's not cause for alarm."
In recent weeks, administrators have
indicated that they may alleviate some of
the short-term pain by infusing the oper
ating budget with funds from the Univer
sity's $2 billion endowment.
In a prepared statement, University
President Donald Kennedy said he
believed Stanford would "certainly
weather the one- or two-year transition
that we predict."
He said the administration was "pre
pared to make the necessary financial
commitments to ensure that the Univer
sity's programs of instruction and
research do not sustain serious damage."
In December, Rear Adm. William
Miller, the chief of naval research, sent a
special negotiating team to Stanford to
address concerns that had been raised by

Paul Biddle, the Navy's representative
assigned to Stanford.
According to Biddle, Navy representa
tives at Stanford prior to his arrival in
October 1988 had agreed to accounting
procedures that were far too generous to
Stanford.
These accounting agreements, called
memoranda of understanding, allowed
Stanford to overcharge the government
by about $200 million for indirect
research costs during the 1980s, Biddle
claimed.
The Navy team and Stanford agreed in
December to review all 90 or so of the
agreements that had been signed during
the previous decade. While the review
took place, the agreements remained in
place.
But the two sides agreed that whatever
outcome was reached, it would be retroac-

tive to the beginning of the aca
demic year.
Yesterday the Navy terminated
all but one of the memoranda of
understanding, driving the rate
down to 55.5.
The only agreement that
remains intact — called "tuition
remission" — has to do with the
way Stanford accounts for the
tuition of graduate students
assisting with federal research.
Stanford will continue to
include a portion of graduate
researchers' tuition costs in the
faculty fringe-benefit rate, as has
been its long-standing practice.
Earlier in the negotiations, the
Navy apparently indicated the
University would have to account
for these tuition costs as a direct
charge of research projects — a
method that would be far more
costly to the University and limit
the number of graduate students
who would be able to engage in
research, according to administra
tors.
The Navy delayed its decision
•ii this issue because the subject
is currently under consideration
by the Office of Management and

Budget, the federal agency that
formulates the rules on indirect
cost recovery at educational insti
tutions.
Before breaking down yester
day, the negotiations had seen
repeated delays. The two parties
had originally been scheduled to
announce an agreement on April
1. That date was pushed back to
April 12 due to the hearing on
Stanford by the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations, chaired by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich. That hearing
required the presence of key Uni
versity and Office of Naval
Research officials.
The April 12 target date came
and went, with the parties agree
ing to extend talks for a week.
People familiar with the situation
say Stanford used the beginning

of the following week to consult
with members of the Board of
Trustees about whether to accept
a Navy offer.
Stanford public affairs officials
confirmed that James Gaither,
president of the board, was
involved in the negotiations in
Washington, D.C., at the begin
ning of this week.
Prior to yesterday's action by
the Navy, Stanford apparently
rejected a proposal that would
have set the rate at 60 percent,
retroactive to April 1. The provi
sional rate of 55 established yes
terday is retroactive to Sept. 1,
1990.
The plan Stanford rejected,
according to those familiar with
the situation, contained a clause
that would have forced the Uni
versity to give up its right to

appeal the Navy's termination of
the memoranda of understanding.
University officials declined to
comment yesterday on whether or
not they were considering appeal
ing the Navy's decision but indi
cated they maintained those
rights.
Administrators' next task will
be to develop new accounting
methods that will allow them to
recoup some of what was lost yes
terday. The Navy will have to
agree to these procedures before
they are put into place, however.
"It will take us some time to
install alternative procedures,"
William Massy, the University's
chief financial officer and head
negotiator, told reporters at a
press briefing. "It takes a certain
amount of calculation time and a
certain amount of time to repro
gram the computers, get all of this
done. These are very complicated
things."
Massy indicated the develop
ment of new procedures would be
piecemeal. The first "batch," he
said, should be completed within
60 days. Beginning late in the fall,
the two parties will begin negoti
ating the final rate for 1990-91.
By that time, Massy said, the Uni

versity should have most of its
new methodologies in place.
"In all honesty," he said, "we
probably won't have completed
that task. But we will have gone a
considerable distance."
By the time the rate for 1991-
92 is finalized, Massy said, the
University should be able to
recover an amount "closer to
what our true costs are."
But next year's rate will likely
see at least as many adjustments
as this year's, Massy said. Stan
ford must submit a proposal for
1991-92 in late summer. By the
time the final rate is determined,
many new agreements with Navy
will be reached, he said.
Massy said the parties had not
determined a schedule for exam
ining costs incurred during past
years — the period during which
Biddle alleges the University over
charged the government.
For now, the memoranda of
understanding remain applicable
to past years. The University has
obtained a legal opinion stating
that the agreements are valid,
binding contracts in past years.
Biddle doesn't believe that is the
case.

Massy said he didn't believe
yesterday's action was indicative
that the rate had been too high in
past years.
Nor does he think anyone at
Stanford should be blamed for the
current situation, he said. "I
think even the question of blame
is really inappropriate," he said.
"This institution met the stan
dards of the state-of-the-art of col
leges and universities — in fact we
were ahead of them. There's a
state of affairs here that's been a
surprise to everybody in higher
education. ... I don't think it is a
question of blame."
Massy said no Stanford
employees would lose their jobs as
a result of the indirect-cost situa
tion.
Congressional investigators
from Dingell's subcommittee said
they considered the Navy's deci
sion yesterday a victory for tax
payers.
"We're happy," one investiga
tor said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "We were always
interested in the government pay
ing its fair share."
Biddle was unavailable for
comment yesterday.

Yesterday the Navy terminated
all but one of the memoranda of
understanding, driving the rate
down to 55.5.
The only agreement that
remains intact — called "tuition
remission" — has to do with the
way Stanford accounts for the
tuition of graduate students
assisting with federal research.
Stanford will continue to
include a portion of graduate
researchers' tuition costs in the
faculty fringe-benefit rate, as has
been its long-standing practice.
Earlier in the negotiations, the
Navy apparently indicated the
University would have to account
for these tuition costs as a direct
charge of research projects — a
method that would be far more
costly to the University and limit
the number of graduate students
who would be able to engage in
research, according to administra
tors.
The Navy delayed its decision
•ii this issue because the subject
is currently under consideration
by the Office of Management and

Budget, the federal agency that
formulates the rules on indirect
cost recovery at educational insti
tutions.
Before breaking down yester
day, the negotiations had seen
repeated delays. The two parties
had originally been scheduled to
announce an agreement on April
1. That date was pushed back to
April 12 due to the hearing on
Stanford by the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations, chaired by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich. That hearing
required the presence of key Uni
versity and Office of Naval
Research officials.
The April 12 target date came
and went, with the parties agree
ing to extend talks for a week.
People familiar with the situation
say Stanford used the beginning

of the following week to consult
with members of the Board of
Trustees about whether to accept
a Navy offer.
Stanford public affairs officials
confirmed that James Gaither,
president of the board, was
involved in the negotiations in
Washington, D.C., at the begin
ning of this week.
Prior to yesterday's action by
the Navy, Stanford apparently
rejected a proposal that would
have set the rate at 60 percent,
retroactive to April 1. The provi
sional rate of 55 established yes
terday is retroactive to Sept. 1,
1990.
The plan Stanford rejected,
according to those familiar with
the situation, contained a clause
that would have forced the Uni
versity to give up its right to

appeal the Navy's termination of
the memoranda of understanding.
University officials declined to
comment yesterday on whether or
not they were considering appeal
ing the Navy's decision but indi
cated they maintained those
rights.
Administrators' next task will
be to develop new accounting
methods that will allow them to
recoup some of what was lost yes
terday. The Navy will have to
agree to these procedures before
they are put into place, however.
"It will take us some time to
install alternative procedures,"
William Massy, the University's
chief financial officer and head
negotiator, told reporters at a
press briefing. "It takes a certain
amount of calculation time and a
certain amount of time to repro
gram the computers, get all of this
done. These are very complicated
things."
Massy indicated the develop
ment of new procedures would be
piecemeal. The first "batch," he
said, should be completed within
60 days. Beginning late in the fall,
the two parties will begin negoti
ating the final rate for 1990-91.
By that time, Massy said, the Uni

versity should have most of its
new methodologies in place.
"In all honesty," he said, "we
probably won't have completed
that task. But we will have gone a
considerable distance."
By the time the rate for 1991-
92 is finalized, Massy said, the
University should be able to
recover an amount "closer to
what our true costs are."
But next year's rate will likely
see at least as many adjustments
as this year's, Massy said. Stan
ford must submit a proposal for
1991-92 in late summer. By the
time the final rate is determined,
many new agreements with Navy
will be reached, he said.
Massy said the parties had not
determined a schedule for exam
ining costs incurred during past
years — the period during which
Biddle alleges the University over
charged the government.
For now, the memoranda of
understanding remain applicable
to past years. The University has
obtained a legal opinion stating
that the agreements are valid,
binding contracts in past years.
Biddle doesn't believe that is the
case.

Massy said he didn't believe
yesterday's action was indicative
that the rate had been too high in
past years.
Nor does he think anyone at
Stanford should be blamed for the
current situation, he said. "I
think even the question of blame
is really inappropriate," he said.
"This institution met the stan
dards of the state-of-the-art of col
leges and universities — in fact we
were ahead of them. There's a
state of affairs here that's been a
surprise to everybody in higher
education. ... I don't think it is a
question of blame."
Massy said no Stanford
employees would lose their jobs as
a result of the indirect-cost situa
tion.
Congressional investigators
from Dingell's subcommittee said
they considered the Navy's deci
sion yesterday a victory for tax
payers.
"We're happy," one investiga
tor said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "We were always
interested in the government pay
ing its fair share."
Biddle was unavailable for
comment yesterday.

The Navy delivered a punishing blow
to the University yesterday, terminating
more than 90 accounting agreements and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost rate to
55.5 percent.
The decision was announced after
negotiations between Stanford and Office
of Naval Research representatives broke
down without a settlement. The negotia
tions, which lasted several weeks, were
intended to resolve much of the contro
versy that has erupted over Stanford's
research costs.
"We regret this action," University
President Donald Kennedy said in a state
ment yesterday.
The two parties will review the rate
again before the books for this year are
finally closed, but such a review won't
take place for at least another year. By

that point, Stanford officials hope to have
developed new cost studies that will jus
tify higher recovery.
However, the timing of the process
ensures that the short-term economic
damage to the University will be
extremely severe.
University administrators declined to
offer specific figures on the impending
budgetary shortfall yesterday.
But calculations based on past figures
provided by the administration suggest
the short-term situation will be rather
bleak. Each one-point drop in the indi
rect-cost rate translates into a $1.25 mil
lion loss in revenue for the University as
a whole.
The University originally budgeted for
a rate of 78 percent for this year. Yester
day's decision means the University will
receive roughly $28 million less in indi
rect-cost recovery than it originally
planned.

Provost James Rosse is expected to
announce several budgetary actions to
the Faculty Senate on Thursday. Prior to
yesterday's move by the Navy, the Uni
versity had been expecting an operating
budget deficit in excess of $5.5 million
this year.
The slashed indirect-cost rate is
expected to add at least another $12 mil
lion to that figure. The rest of the hit will
be taken by the Medical School, which
keeps a portion of the cost recovery gener

ated by research conducted there.
"There's cause for serious concern,"
Rosse said in a brief interview last night,
"but it's not cause for alarm."
In recent weeks, administrators have
indicated that they may alleviate some of
the short-term pain by infusing the oper
ating budget with funds from the Univer
sity's $2 billion endowment.
In a prepared statement, University
President Donald Kennedy said he
believed Stanford would "certainly
weather the one- or two-year transition
that we predict."
He said the administration was "pre
pared to make the necessary financial
commitments to ensure that the Univer
sity's programs of instruction and
research do not sustain serious damage."
In December, Rear Adm. William
Miller, the chief of naval research, sent a
special negotiating team to Stanford to
address concerns that had been raised by

Paul Biddle, the Navy's representative
assigned to Stanford.
According to Biddle, Navy representa
tives at Stanford prior to his arrival in
October 1988 had agreed to accounting
procedures that were far too generous to
Stanford.
These accounting agreements, called
memoranda of understanding, allowed
Stanford to overcharge the government
by about $200 million for indirect
research costs during the 1980s, Biddle
claimed.
The Navy team and Stanford agreed in
December to review all 90 or so of the
agreements that had been signed during
the previous decade. While the review
took place, the agreements remained in

ment of new procedures would be
piecemeal. The first "batch," he
said, should be completed within
60 days. Beginning late in the fall,
the two parties will begin negoti
ating the final rate for 1990-91.
By that time, Massy said, the Uni

versity should have most of its
new methodologies in place.
"In all honesty," he said, "we
probably won't have completed
that task. But we will have gone a
considerable distance."
By the time the rate for 1991-
92 is finalized, Massy said, the
University should be able to
recover an amount "closer to
what our true costs are."
But next year's rate will likely
see at least as many adjustments
as this year's, Massy said. Stan
ford must submit a proposal for
1991-92 in late summer. By the
time the final rate is determined,
many new agreements with Navy
will be reached, he said.
Massy said the parties had not
determined a schedule for exam
ining costs incurred during past
years — the period during which
Biddle alleges the University over
charged the government.
For now, the memoranda of
understanding remain applicable
to past years. The University has
obtained a legal opinion stating
that the agreements are valid,
binding contracts in past years.
Biddle doesn't believe that is the
case.

Massy said he didn't believe
yesterday's action was indicative
that the rate had been too high in
past years.
Nor does he think anyone at
Stanford should be blamed for the
current situation, he said. "I
think even the question of blame
is really inappropriate," he said.
"This institution met the stan
dards of the state-of-the-art of col
leges and universities — in fact we
were ahead of them. There's a
state of affairs here that's been a
surprise to everybody in higher
education. ... I don't think it is a
question of blame."
Massy said no Stanford
employees would lose their jobs as
a result of the indirect-cost situa
tion.
Congressional investigators
from Dingell's subcommittee said
they considered the Navy's deci
sion yesterday a victory for tax
payers.
"We're happy," one investiga
tor said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "We were always
interested in the government pay
ing its fair share."
Biddle was unavailable for
comment yesterday.


'It takes a certain amount of calcu
lation time and a certain amount of
time to reprogram the computers,
get all of this done.'
