# Navy slashes rate to 55½ percent
## Stanford slammed on indirect costs 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The Navy delivered a punishing blow
to the University yesterday, terminating
more than 90 accounting agreements and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost rate to
55.5 percent.
The decision was announced after
negotiations between Stanford and Office
of Naval Research representatives broke
down without a settlement. The negotia
tions, which lasted several weeks, were
intended to resolve much of the contro
versy that has erupted over Stanford's
research costs.
"We regret this action," University
President Donald Kennedy said in a state
ment yesterday.
The two parties will review the rate
again before the books for this year are
finally closed, but such a review won't
take place for at least another year. By

that point, Stanford officials hope to have
developed new cost studies that will jus
tify higher recovery.
However, the timing of the process
ensures that the short-term economic
damage to the University will be
extremely severe.
University administrators declined to
offer specific figures on the impending
budgetary shortfall yesterday.
But calculations based on past figures
provided by the administration suggest
the short-term situation will be rather
bleak. Each one-point drop in the indi
rect-cost rate translates into a $1.25 mil
lion loss in revenue for the University as
a whole.
The University originally budgeted for
a rate of 78 percent for this year. Yester
day's decision means the University will
receive roughly $28 million less in indi
rect-cost recovery than it originally
planned.

Provost James Rosse is expected to
announce several budgetary actions to
the Faculty Senate on Thursday. Prior to
yesterday's move by the Navy, the Uni
versity had been expecting an operating
budget deficit in excess of $5.5 million
this year.
The slashed indirect-cost rate is
expected to add at least another $12 mil
lion to that figure. The rest of the hit will
be taken by the Medical School, which
keeps a portion of the cost recovery gener

ated by research conducted there.
"There's cause for serious concern,"
Rosse said in a brief interview last night,
"but it's not cause for alarm."
In recent weeks, administrators have
indicated that they may alleviate some of
the short-term pain by infusing the oper
ating budget with funds from the Univer
sity's $2 billion endowment.
In a prepared statement, University
President Donald Kennedy said he
believed Stanford would "certainly
weather the one- or two-year transition
that we predict."
He said the administration was "pre
pared to make the necessary financial
commitments to ensure that the Univer
sity's programs of instruction and
research do not sustain serious damage."
In December, Rear Adm. William
Miller, the chief of naval research, sent a
special negotiating team to Stanford to
address concerns that had been raised by

Paul Biddle, the Navy's representative
assigned to Stanford.
According to Biddle, Navy representa
tives at Stanford prior to his arrival in
October 1988 had agreed to accounting
procedures that were far too generous to
Stanford.
These accounting agreements, called
memoranda of understanding, allowed
Stanford to overcharge the government
by about $200 million for indirect
research costs during the 1980s, Biddle
claimed.
The Navy team and Stanford agreed in
December to review all 90 or so of the
agreements that had been signed during
the previous decade. While the review
took place, the agreements remained in
place.
But the two sides agreed that whatever
outcome was reached, it would be retroac-


Stanford
will 'certainly
weather the ...
transition.'
