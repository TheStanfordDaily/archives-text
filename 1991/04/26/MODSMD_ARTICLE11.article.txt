# 'Oligarchy' of ASSU prompted Lopez's resignation
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Raul Lopez believes that the ASSU Sen
ate is violating the democratic processes he
cherishes so deeply.
Rather than participate in those actions,
he decided to pursue what he believed to be
his only available option — he resigned
Tuesday night from his position as elec
tions commissioner.
"There was a conflict of interest between
what the senate asked me to do and what I
believed was right," said Lopez, a graduate
student in engineering.
What the senate asked Lopez to do was
put MEChA and XTV special-fee requests
on the runoff ballot to give them a "second
chance" to receive student approval. The
senate also voted to place a referendum
about a redesigned ASSU financial-aid
office on the runoff ballot.
"The decision of the voters as a whole
was being thrown away because this small
group decided they were wrong," Lopez

said. "I realized how a small group of stu
dents was deciding for the larger group and
it was not a representative action.
"I don't think that this is a democracy. It
is an oligarchy," Lopez added.
Lopez said he thinks the ASSU might be
even worse than the old Communist
regimes that once ruled Eastern Europe.
"In Eastern Europe the government did
not claim to have democracy and people
there learned to live with it,"he said. "But
here they claim to run a democratic process
and do not, which is worse."
But senators and students who sup
ported the senate's decision said the action
was essential to preserve the democratic
process for the two special-fee requests.
For example, MEChA Co-chair Anna
Mata, a sophomore, argued during Tues
day's meeting that an incomplete state
ment in the election handbook and "no rec
ommendation" from The Daily editorial
board were election irregularities that
required giving the Chicano/Latino student
group another chance.

XTV station manger David Holland, a
senior, made a similar argument, saying the
television station's fee request should be
given another chance because its budget
was omitted from the election handbook.
Lopez bore much of the blame for the
errors in the election handbook during the
senate meeting, but he said others should
take responsibility for the mistakes.
"The main problem was that members of
the senate . . . were a pain in the neck when
we were putting the book together," Lopez
said. "They kept adding things late and
missing important deadlines, pushing us
back too close to the date of publication."
Lopez downplayed the significance of the
errors. "Any Stanford student should know
better than to vote only by what is in a pam
phlet. ... It really did not have that much
influence over the student body," he said.
The three organizations that failed to
receive student approval for their special
fee requests have only themselves to blame,
Lopez said.
"There is a much deeper reason why

these groups did not get their money —
they are not of interest to the student body
at large," Lopez said. "Each group should
communicate what it offers to the student
body during the year.
"This is a last effort by these organiza
tions to get a fee that they failed to obtain
throughout the year," he added.
Lopez said the current efforts of MEChA
and X'l'V are "lame excuses" that "rational
people would say were not important
enough to merit a new election." He added
that the ASSU financial-aid office should
not be on the ballot as a referendum
because a similar measure has already
failed to win a special-fee request.
But Lopez said he does not think the
senate's actions to override the vote of the
students and put the special-fee requests on
the ballot are out of the ordinary.
"The senate is influenced by small
groups. It does not have a tendency to
reflect what the student body at large
believes," he said. "Very few people know or
really care about the ASSU."
