Cholera threatens a quarter of
Latin America's population
GENEVA (AP) — Latin America's cholera
epidemic threatens about a quarter of the
region's population, or up to 120 million peo
ple, the head of the World Health Organization
said yesterday.
People living in poor conditions in urban
shantytowns and slums as well as in rural
areas are especially at risk, WHO director-gen
eral Hiroshi said.
Nakajima said the causes of the outbreak —
chiefly lack of safe water, clean food and sanita
tion — are only a symptom of Latin America's
economic crisis and its poverty and underdevel
opment.
More than 177,000 cholera cases have been
recorded in 1991, nearly as many as in all of
1971, the most recent peak year, WHO said.
Lithuanian buildings occupied
MOSCOW (AP) — Soviet troops used force
again in independence-seeking Lithuania, seiz
ing at least 12 buildings in eight cities, the
Lithuanian Parliament said yesterday.
The troops said they were carrying out
orders from Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri
Yazov to guard property that the ministry
claims belongs to it, the independent Elta news
agency reported.
Soldiers in paratroopers' uniforms broke
into buildings, including several technical
schools, a clothing factory, a hotel and a sports
complex in eight Lithuanian cities, the parlia
ment said.
Tension has been high in Lithuania since the
bloody January crackdown by Soviet troops in
the Baltics, which left at least 22 people dead.
U.S. offers aid to Vietnam
WASHINGTON (AP) - For the first time

Richard Solomon, the assistant secretary of
state for East Asia, said $1 million in aid is

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov. Pete Wilson is
asking for the biggest tax increase in Califor

includes a 1 1/4-cent sales tax increase — to
help erase a $12.6 billion budget shortage.
The sales tax proposal unveiled yesterday by
Wilson as part of a revised $55 billion state

It would increase the sales tax to 8 1/4 cents
per dollar in most urban areas of the state and
to 7 1/4 or 7 3/4 cents in most rural and subur
ban counties.
