# Senate approves $1.46 trillion 1992 budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
yesterday approved a $1.46 trillion
Democratic budget for 1992 that
ignores President Bush's plan to slash
Medicare, preserves his proposed
defense spending and boosts his
requests for education, transportation
and other health programs.
The measure was adopted on a voice
vote after three days of debate.
Bridled by a near-record $290 bil
lion deficit, the spending plan contains
no dramatic domestic initiatives.
Republicans put their stamp on the
measure with a provision making it all
but impossible for taxes to be raised to
pay for any new programs Congress
enacts later in the year.
The budget contains no tax
increases. But it also rejects Bush's
call for a reduction in the capital gains
tax rate, a proposal that lawmakers
have turned down two years in a row.
During the third day of debate on
the spending plan, liberal Democrats
launched several unsuccessful attacks
on the $295.3 billion it contained for
defense spending.
That amount matched what Bush
proposed for the military, and obeyed

the defense spending limit set in last
fall's deficit-reduction deal. But liber
als argued that with the Cold War over,
money should be shifted from the Pen
tagon to domestic programs — a trans
fer the deficit-reduction accord for
bids.
"We need to reorder our priorities,"
said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who pro
posed cutting the defense budget by $6
billion and using half the money to
reduce the deficit and the other half to
beef up social programs. "Times have
changed," he insisted.
Republicans countered that the
Soviet Union remains too unstable for
the United States to reduce military
expenditures any further.
Bradley's amendment was rejected
73-22. The Senate also defeated 70-25
a proposal by Sen. Paul Simon, D-111.,
to cut the the defense budget by the
same $6 billion — and use all the
money for deficit reduction. And it
voted 64-30 against a second Simon
amendment that would have reduced
military spending by $3 billion.
The budget is just what the name
implies — spending plan. Actual
spending still must be done through

appropriations bills. But adoption of
the budget forces appropriations com
mittees to observe its ceilings.
The Senate budget closely tracks a
Democratic-written spending
blueprint that the House approved
April 17. Both rejected Bush's plan to
cut the Medicare health insurance pro
gram for the elderly, payments to vet
erans and other benefit programs by
$46 billion over the next five years.
And both allow most domestic pro
grams to increase at roughly the rate
of inflation.
But as the House did, Senate
Democrats funneled several billion
dollars more than Bush wanted to pro
grams including the Head Start pro
gram for pre-schoolers, grants for col
lege students and aid to mass transit
systems.
To help pay for those increases,
Democrats were nearly $3 billion
stingier than Bush was to space, sci
ence and law enforcement programs.
Though the budget funds no large
new domestic programs, it leaves the
door open for Congress to expand
unemployment benefits and initiatives
for poor children, health care and

transportation.
Under last year's budget agree
ment, new initiatives cannot increase
the deficit. To stymie Congress from
raising taxes to finance new programs,
Republicans won language requiring
60 votes to do so — a feat that would
be extremely difficult for a Senate
where Democrats hold a 56-43 edge.
As a result, new programs would
have to be paid for by equal cuts in
other programs.
Once again, the Senate rejected
Bush's call for a cut in the capital gains
tax — the tax paid on profits resulting
from the sale of real estate and other
property and investments. Bush says
cutting the levy would encourage peo
ple to sell their holdings and boost fed
eral revenues, but Democrats say the
plan would cost the government
money and mainly save money for the
wealthy.
The House and Senate will have to
work out a compromise budget before
it can be enacted, but it does not
require Bush's signature. The spend
ing plan serves as a guide for the year's
fiscal legislation, but most of its details
are not binding.
