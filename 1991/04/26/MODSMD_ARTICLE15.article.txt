### 
LONDON (AP) - Polish Pres
ident Lech Walesa warned yester
day that Europe's stability could
be shattered by mass migration if
foreign investors do not help
rebuild former East Bloc coun
tries.
Walesa, the first Pole to be
accorded a full state visit in
Britain since after World War 11,
told a conference of young politi
cians that they must create equal
opportunities across the conti
nent.
"Europe is yours," Walesa said
to the British Atlantic Group of
Politicians. "We have fought hard
to give it to you. But we no longer
have the strength to fight on."
Returning to a theme that has
dominated his four-day visit,
Walesa said, "We must not allow
the Iron Curtain to be replaced by
a silver one."
"Security and affluence in the
West and instability and poverty
in the East will force people to
migrate. We must even out our
differences."
"Either the young generation
can convert Europe into a single
home ... or we will see major
migration which will cause insta
bility in Europe," he said.
Last year, Britain granted
tourist visas to more than 60,000
Poles, manv of whom the British

government believes worked in
Britain illegally. For that reason,
Britain has refused to drop a visa
requirement for Poles, despite
pressure from Warsaw.
At a lunch hosted by the gover
nor of the Bank of England,
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Walesa
sought to convince bankers that
investment in Poland would be of
mutual benefit.
Walesa will leave today with
out an agreement from the Lon
don Club of commercial banks to
reduce its $11 billion share of
Poland's foreign debt, which
totals about $48.5 billion.
The Paris Club of 17 creditor
countries agreed Monday to a 50
percent reduction of its $33 bil
lion portion of the debt.
The United States has
scratched 70 percent of Poland's
debt, France 60 percent, and Ger
many also is expected to agree to a
generous reduction. But, Walesa
said, "there are problems with
Britain."
Yesterday the president also
met with former prime minister
Margaret Thatcher and opposi
tion Labor Party leader Neil Kin
nock at Windsor Castle, where he
and his wife, Danuta, are guests
of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince
Philip.
