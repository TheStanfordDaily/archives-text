# Capital of Ethiopia threatened by rebels
## 
### 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Tigre
rebels seeking to topple the gov
ernment claimed yesterday to
have captured a town 65 miles
west of Ethiopia's capital, Addis
Ababa.
There was no immediate gov
ernment comment on the claim,
but Western diplomats in Addis
Ababa say the insurgents pose the
greatest threat ever to the Marxist
government of President Mengistu
Haile Mariam, who overthrew
Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.
The U.S. State Department
said yesterday it is ordering all
embassy dependents and non
essential personnel out of
Ethiopia because of the rebel
advances.
All private Americans are being
urged to leave the country as soon
as possible, department spokes
man Richard Boucher told re
porters in Washington.
There are about 600 Americans
in Ethiopia on private business or
working with aid organizations
trying to cope with a famine that
threatens at least 5 million people.
Forces of the Ethiopian Peo
ple's Revolutionary Democratic-
Front won the desert town of
Am bo on Wednesday, a spokesman
for the Front said.
Many foreign diplomats con
sider the control of Ambo critical.
The town is near one of the coun
try's main ammunition factories.
Fighting was continuing with
remaining government troops
who were dug in about 10 miles
north of the town on the main
road to the capital, Front
spokesman Asefa Mamo said in a
telephone interview from its Lon
don office.
He described the government
soldiers as elite forces that were
being reinforced by crack troops
from Asmara, in the country's
north and Dessye, to the east.
Mamo said rebels eventually
planned to march on the capital

but said that was the "final g0a1...
not the immediate goal."
The Tigreans have been fight
ing since 1975 seeking Mengistu's
ouster and greater autonomy for
their home province, Tigre.
Last month, many embassies,
including that of the United
States, advised their dependents
and non-essential staff to leave
the country on a voluntary basis
following dramatic rebel gains.
The Front is a combined force
of the Tigrean People's Liberation
Front and the much smaller
Ethiopian People's Democratic
Movement, another group of
fighters from the north-central
province of Tigre.
Since launching an offensive
Feb. 23, the insurgents have made
striking gains, winning control of
the northwestern provinces of
Gondar and Gojjam, both impor
tant grain-growing regions.
They also took significant por
tions of the western province of
Welega, home to Ambo, and por
tions of the central and eastern
provinces of Shewa and Welo.
Combined with territory held
by a separate insurgency, the
secessionist Eritrean People's Lib
eration Front, Ethiopian rebels
now control Ethiopia's northern
third.
The Eritreans reportedly have
been fighting alongside the Tigre
ans in some battles and have been
coordinating their separate
advances with the EPRDF offen
sive.
They currently threaten Assab,
the last port under government
control, according to diplomatic
sources in Addis Ababa.
The government has heavily
defended the port, which handles
about 70 percent of the nation's
foreign trade, has the nation's
sole fuel refinery and is key to the
delivery of relief food destined for
many famine victims.
