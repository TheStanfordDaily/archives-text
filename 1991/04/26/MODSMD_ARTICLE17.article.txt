# Soviets agree to join Gulf peace process

JERUSALEM (AP) — The Soviet Union
agreed yesterday to join the United States in
sponsoring peace talks between Israel and
the Arabs.
But the outlook for such a conference
remnined uncertain. After more than a week
of shuttle diplomacy, Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 has gained agreement
neither on the format for negotiations or on
which Palestinian Arabs would attend.
Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander A.
Bessmertnykh speaking at a news confer
ence in Kislovodsk, the Soviet retreat where
he and Baker had been meeting, said:
"We intend to act as sponsors of that con

ference, and the fact that there are two
major powers — great powers — that help in
getting that process under way would make
it possible for that process to move at a
faster pace,"
For his part, Baker said a Mideast peace
conference would not "be a successful
undertaking — in fact, it will not even take
place — unless the real parties to the conflict
have a true desire for peace."
It was not immediately clear whether the
arrangement was acceptable to Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minis
ter David Levy.
Baker flew from Kislovodsk, in the Cen

tral Caucasus, to Israel to get an answer Fri
day from Shamir and Levy on whether they
would also accept a role for the United
Nations and ease the restrictions they want
to place on who would speak for the Pales
tinians.
"My honest feeling remains that there is
a genuine desire on the part of the parties
for peace," Baker said before leaving for
Israel. "My honest feeling is that there is a
better chance now than has been the case for
quite some time in the past."
In Jerusalem, Yossi Ben-Aharon, a top
aide to Shamir, cautioned:
"Whoever expected some dramatic break
through will be disappointed. We all know
it's a complex, deeply rooted conflict, and
several flights from one capital to another
cannot resolve the problem."
Earlier this week, Baker expressed open
irritation at Israel for continuing to allow
new settlements in its occupied territories.
"We were very disappointed" at news of
the newest settlement, he commented, then
adding, "It is easier to obstruct peace than to
promote peace."
Before his discussions with Bessmert
nykh, Baker met with Syrian Foreign Minis
ter Farouk Sharaa, who said he was "not
optimistic at all" about the chances for a
peace conference.
During Baker's meeting with Bessmert
nykh, the Soviet news agency Tass
announced that the foreign minister would
go to Israel in May in what would be the
highest-level visit by a Soviet official since
Israel achieved statehood in 1948.
Asked about the report, Bessmertnykh
said, "I am planning to go to the Middle East
area, although 1 am not finally decided on
the itinerary of that trip."
The Soviets have established a consulate
in Israel but not restored full diplomatic
relations, which Moscow severed after Israel
defeated Egypt and Syria in the 1967 Six-
Dav War.
Bessmertnykh also declined to say
whether full relations would be restored, but
did say:
"The relationship has been progressing.
If the tendency toward the start of a settle
ment is getting closer, I don't think there
will be a problem."
