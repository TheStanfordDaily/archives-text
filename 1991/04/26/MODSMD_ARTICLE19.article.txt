When is a vote not a
vote? When you have
to vote all over again

A RUNOFF ELECTION should
be held, as its name suggests,
to decide between the two
most successful candidates in a
general election, when neither has
gained a majority of votes. A runoff
should not be an opportunity to re
vote on issues previously and fairly
decided.
Nothing should be on next
week's ASSU runoff ballot, then,
except the Council of Presidents
runoff and Project Motivation's fee
request, which was supposed to,
but did not, appear on the original
ballot. In contrast, MEChA's and
XTV's fee requests, and the refer
endum for an ASSU Financial Aid
Office, have no place on the runoff
ballot.
When the ASSU Senate decided
to allow MEChA and XTV a second
chance at their fee requests, it
threw democracy out the window.
In permitting the fate of two
groups' fee requests to be re
decided, the senate, in effect, said
the student body could not possibly
have meant to vote as it did in the
general election. Consequently, the
entire voting process is rendered
democratic in appearance only.
MEChA claims it was a victim of
unfair election "irregularities."
Among these, the group cited an
incomplete statement in the elec
tion handbook and the fact that
The Daily editorial board made no
recommendation on its fee request.
These are, MEChA claims, suffi
cient causes for its inclusion on the
runoff ballot. In both cases, how
ever, their logic is flawed.
The election handbook, indeed
the election process, was plagued
with omissions and oversights.

MEChA, however, was not the
biggest victim. At least three orga
nizations — STOP Safe Trans
portation Program, Club Sports
and SURE Escort Service — were
not in the election handbook at all.
And though these groups won
their fee requests, by MEChA's
logic, they should also be placed on
the runoff ballot. Underlying
MEChA's and XTV's claims is the
assumption that voters, properly
informed by the election guide,
might have voted differently. If this
is true, they might have voted dif
ferently on any organization which
was not properly represented in the
handbook; therefore, all the
neglected groups, not just the
unsuccessful ones, should be sub
ject to a second vote. Otherwise,
the system is biased toward organi
zations' always receiving their fee
requests.
The claim that the "No Recom
mendation" endorsement by The
Daily was an election "irregularity"
is ludicrous. The Daily is indepen
dent and is not an official arm of
the election process. Unable to
coordinate a meeting with
MEChA's fee request sponsor, The
Daily decided not to make any rec
ommendation, rather than make
an endorsement based on limited
information.
Only Project Motivation should
be added to the runoff ballot
because students had no chance to
vote for or against its fee request.
What's more, the same logic
which reserves the second ballot
for the actual COP runoff and the
one group whose fee request was
not given a fair shot also precludes
the placement on the ballot of the
referendum calling for an ASSU
Financial Aid Office. No, this is not
a fee request; it is, however, an
attempt to make up for the
untainted defeat of the ASSU
Lobby Office's fee request and as
such has no place on the runoff bal
lot.
