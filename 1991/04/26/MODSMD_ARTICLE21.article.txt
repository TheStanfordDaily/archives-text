STANFORD OCCUPIES A UNIQUE
(and sometimes undesirable) posi
tion among American universities.
We do not fit into any easily identifiable
category. We are not the party school, the
big state school, the athletic powerhouse,
the intellectual haven, the conservative
old-boy school or the liberal, neo-hippy,
artsy school.
Elite institutions scoff at Stanford,
believing that intellectualism is incom
patible with the fun and sun of California.
Less prestigious universities look at us
disdainfully, believing that we contami
nate normal hedonistic college life with
philosophic discourse and liberal educa
tion. Conservatives call us politically cor
rect. Liberals call us an elitist country
club.
Due to the lack of a predefined identity,
Stanford has to grapple with issues of
self-definition. Within the University
community, this has generated argu
ments concerning Stanford's mission and
academic responsibility. Student debates
on distribution requirements, multicul
turalism, political correctness, the Greek
system, etc. have had a foundation in this
lack of common vision and common pur
pose. Can we expect the ASSU to imple
ment anything concrete when we have
not agreed upon an ideological frame
work?
On an individual level, Stanford's
ambiguous identity has had a much dif
ferent effect. Many students have been
able to synthesize these seemingly oppos
ing views of the Stanford experience in
their own behavior. We see them all
around us — the electrical engineering
major who writes a Daily column, the ath

lete who sits on the ASSU Senate, the fra
ternity member who works for SURE
Escort Service or the SLE student with a
social life. For the purposes of this col
umn, however, we will focus on a particu
larly intriguing and amusing behavior
pattern — that of the Intellectual Punk.
Intellectual punk behavior is charac
terized by the philosophic analysis of
untraditional topics — bodily functions,
personal relations, pop culture, etc. It
emancipates the mind from the bonds of
classical scholasticism. It juxtaposes
resistance to traditional schooling and a
desire for education. It demonstrates an
understanding of the material while sati
rizing the entire discipline.
For instance, Intellectual Punks might
ask, "What would Hegel do if Marx were
sitting next to him and farted?"
A punk response might be, "It can be
inferred, after consideration of the con
cept of the dialectic, that Hegel would
emit a flatulation in response and opposi
tion to Marx's sphincter release. The two
odors would come into conflict, thus
yielding a new odor that we can term a
fart SYNTHESIS."
Perplexed by the question "Does a
doughnut hole exist?" Intellectual Punks
might participate in the following dis
course: "Is the hole matter or the absence
of matter? Does how we conceive of the
doughnut hole dictate its nature? Is the
hole the little ball sold by Dunkin'
Donuts, or is it the absence of doughnut
in the middle of the doughnut? If the for
mer is the true 'hole,' how does this rede
fine the notion of hole?"
The point is Intellectual Punks find a
way to synthesize two different mediums

of communication — the humorous and
the intellectual. They are either funny in
an intellectual manner or intellectual in a
funny manner. They don't necessarily
have to be one or the other.
Ivy League-type intellectuals may
term their behavior immature. Serious
partyers may call their behavior preten
tious. Intellectual Punks, however, know
they have found a valid medium of self
expression and don't care what others
think.
Like the Intellectual Punk, Stanford
straddles the line between dual identities.
Stanford is both a classical and liberal
educational institution, a party school
and an intellectual environment, an ath
letic power and an academic strength.
The Intellectual Punk merely shows
that Stanford does not need to adopt one
exclusive identity. Stanford's identity lies
in the walking of the line. Its indecision
about its identity is not a detriment
because it allows synthesis, debate and
the freedom to be different.
Amid all the noise and debate, what
makes the "Stanford Experience" com
mon is this indecision.
