## What is Reges after â€” a Barbiturate Theme House'? 
### 
AS A FIRST-YEAR GRADUATE
student at Stanford, I have tried
my best to understand the tradi
tions, philosophies and controversies
particular to the University. However, 1
must confess I am baffled by the current
debate concerning the actions of Stuart
Reges.
As Reges himself proudly declared in
his April 22 letter to The Daily, he has
carried illegal drugs in his backpack
while on campus, spent unrestricted
University funds buying alcohol for
underaged students and recommended
an undergraduate experiment with the
substance MDA. After challenging Stan
ford, as well as federal, officials to react
to his boasts, Reges now finds himself on
administrative leave pending an investi
gation. This fact is hardly surprising, yet
Reges defiantly seeks to rally support
from students and the local and national
media.
Still more puzzling is Reges' invoca-

tion of "academic freedom" to justify his
provocative actions. While the movement
to promote literature by and about
blacks, women and other marginalized
groups has indeed produced a broaden
ing of intellectual debate, I fail to see the
corresponding advancements Reges envi
sions for his own cause.
Does he suggest altering the Cultures,
Ideas and Values curriculum to include
drug-induced poetry from Coleridge to
the Grateful Dead? Or, since he pro
claims, "My drug experiences have been
some of the most important in my spiri
tual and intellectual development,"
should resident assistants lead their resi
dents from glue-sniffing through tequila
shots and on to peyote? Perhaps Reges
himself could serve as the resident fellow
for a new "Barbiturate Theme House."
While my queries may appear to be
merely snide sarcasm, the fact that
Reges has found a willing audience for

his evangelism suggests otherwise. His
shameless pandering for a public forum
in which to debate the "crisis" he created
has indeed been successful, as The Daily
noted Tuesday and Wednesday. With a
dozen dormitories' having accepted
Reges' offer to come and speak, a peti
tion circulating to protest his suspension
and air time having been granted to him
by a Texas radio show and even "CBS
Evening News," the inflammatory
actions of a champion of drug use have
been warped into the alleged persecution
of a fine teacher defending his right to
privacy.
Clearly, Reges' dedication to and gift
for teaching are laudable, and they have
been celebrated by the academic commu
nity as a whole. His openness about his
homosexuality is certainly his preroga
tive, and if his status as a role model
heartens gay students, then more power
to him.
But his unabashed attempts to pro-

mote himself as a crusader for civil liber
ties are contemptible. What are Reges'
1 goals in taking these actions? Seemingly,
to encourage others to ingest illegal and
dangerous drugs, to make a mockery of
the national trend toward more responsi
ble alcohol policies on college campuses
and to bring further disrepute to Stan
ford's beleaguered public image.
It is lamentable, though not alto
gether surprising, that undergraduates
are rallying to the side of this deluded
false messiah and that the media are
licking their chops at the sight of more
trouble at Stanford. However, it is a
tragedy that thoughtful reformers with
substantive issues to voice are being
drowned out by the cacophonous, carni
val atmosphere which currently domi
nates the campus.
Do not the students of Stanford
deserve better?
