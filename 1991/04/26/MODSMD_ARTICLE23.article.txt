# Senate abusing its power by giving groups second try
## 
### 
IN OUR YEARS HERE AT Stanford,
we have seen the ASSU run in and
out of controversy. However, we have
never seen anything as preposterous as
what occurred at the April 23 senate
meeting, when the senate allowed
MEChA and XTV on the runoff ballot.
Although MEChA and XTV have made
valuable contributions to the Stanford
community, the student body voted not
to grant them their fee requests this
year. Therefore, we completely support
Raul Lopez' resignation as elections
commissioner, and we demand that the
senate remove MEChA and XTV from
the runoff ballot.
MEChA and XTV have no place on
the ballot. The student body has already
spoken: A majority of the students did
not believe that MEChA should receive

funding. A democratic process led to the
decision that two organizations, for some
reason, did not deserve their fee request.
The senate, however, is ignoring that
vote and deciding that MEChA and XTV
deserve a second chance. What right has
the senate to invalidate a clear-cut,
unquestionable election result? Will the
senate hold yet another election should
MEChA lose again in the runoff?
MEChA claims that "irregularities"
cost them in the election. In response to
the argument that the election handbook
left out critical information, we believe
that MEChA, XTV and every other orga
nization on the ballot have the responsi
bility to confirm or correct their own sec
tions in the handbook. As we understand
it, MEChA and XTV had ample opportu
nity to make any clarifications or correc

tions before the handbook was pub
lished. Why did MEChA and XTV not try
to correct the errors before the election,
instead of after the results?
Second, the argument about the
Daily's "No Recommendation" has no
validity whatsoever. The Daily is a sepa
rate entity, and its opinions, while influ
ential, do not necessarily dictate student
voting patterns. In fact, other organiza
tions, such as the Stanford Volunteer
Network, received a "No Recommenda
tion" and still won at the polls. Is
MEChA really that dependent upon a
Daily endorsement? What if the Daily
had given MEChA a negative endorse
ment? Would MEChA still be on the
runoff ballot?
Council of Presidents member Good
win Liu said at Orientation last fall that

the ASSU was not a joke. The senate's
actions Tuesday night completely contra
diet that statement by mocking democ
racy and reducing the senate's own cred
ibility. Clearly, the senate is abusing its
power and we demand that it immedi
ately remove MEChA and XTV from the
runofT ballot.
