New policy threatens
unique experience of
Alpha Sigma life
We are writing in response to what we
feel is unwarranted, unreasonable,
bureaucratic indifference. As Stanford
students, we have heard a great deal
about the importance of building com
munity and residence-based learning.
Contrary to this purported emphasis
on community, we feel strongly that
Alpha Sigma, which has for many years
been home to a unique experiment in
coed living modeled after fraternities and
sororities, is being unduly stripped of its
identity.
In 1973, the Stanford chapter of
Alpha Sigma became a coed brotherhood
and sisterhood and in 1983 was kicked
out of the national organization when
our female house president attempted to
attend a national convention. Ever since
that time, Alpha Sig has struggled to
maintain an identity melding the best of
Greek organizations within a more inclu
sive environment. Quite simply, Alpha
Sig is a house like no other.
Alpha Sig's unique position — as a
house in the Draw attempting to pre
serve a unique identity — was greatly
hurt when returning residency was dis
continued. At that time, houses attempt

ing to preserve unique identities were
given the modest recourse of a few addi
tional exempt spots in the Draw, allow
ing for a guaranteed core of returning
residents responsible for communicating
house traditions.
Now the University is attempting to
strip Alpha Sig of two of its five previ
ously exempt spots, leaving us wonder
ing if any commitment to the preserva
tion of this unique experiment exists.
We fear that individuals within the
University have extrapolated from a pre
disposition against housed fraternities —
which we are not — and a few com
plaints — which dramatically decreased
this year and are normal within any
house — to reach the conclusion that
Alpha Sig should be phased out.
Just as in any large family, we have
experienced growing pains and struggled
to find the best lifestyle which incorpo
rates diversity while preserving commu
nity. Naturally we have had problems,
and we work as a group to solve them,
learning about each other and ourselves
along the way.
We urge the University to reconsider
its decision to remove our exempt spots,
both for ourselves — we love this house
very much — and for past and future
generations of "Siggies" who, like any
campus community, deserve respect and
consideration.

Democracy subverted
by senate's allowing
fee requests in runoff
Once again, the ASSU Senate has
overruled the democratic procedure of
the spring election, as an attempt to cor
rect the 'uninformed' vote of Stanford
students. Within a week of the student
body's rejection of the fee requests of
three groups, the senate voted to allow
two of them another chance and modi
fied the third into a new group.
MEChA, one of the groups to be put
on the runoff ballot, proposed that they
should be put there for two reasons: one,
because they support the Chicano/Latino
community; and two, because their entry
in the election handbook was incomplete
and The Daily did not recommend that
students vote for their fee request. As for
the first claim, MEChA informed the
students of this before the first election,
and it is a fact commonly known anyway.
We are being asked to reconsider what
the voters already declared in the first
election — that as a university, a major
ity of voters does not feel the services
provided merit the fee request.
As for the second issue, the election
handbook was rife with confusion and
partial information. The referendum on
financial aid was not printed in the

handbook; the budgetary information
was poorly ordered and confusing. How
ever, this affected many groups, the
majority of which garnered their fee
request. The Daily did not recommend
themselves or AASA; both groups won
by substantial margins. They also did
not endorse three of the four COP slates
— should The Daily give every group an
endorsement? If so, why bother with the
endorsements at all? Given the senate's
new procedure, we might as well not
bother with fee requests at all; we can
just continue to hold elections until
every fee request wins.
In a similar action, XTV was put on
the ballot in order that the senate not be
"hypocritical." Arguments similar to
those against MEChA can be made
against this action. Students rejected
their fee request because they felt the
services provided were not worth the
large amount of money requested. I
doubt many students' votes were
affected by the absence of a budget in the
handbook.
Imagine if we held another presiden
tial election because Mike Dukakis failed
to receive an endorsement from a televi
sion network, or was not contacted for
an interview by, say, The New York
Times, or better yet, because Congress
didn't like the result and voted to hold
another election.

Interim-housing rent
increase hurts those
who have to stay here
I wonder how many students have
noticed rate increase that the Housing
Center has quietly passed on to us. I
refer to the drastic increase in the rates
for summer-autumn interim housing.
The rate listed in the summer housing
booklet for 1990 was $161.50. For sum
mer 1991, the rate for the same period of
interim housing has risen to $207, an
increase of just under 30 percent.
Could the Housing Center kindly
explain how such an increase is justified?
Perhaps they have made a mistake due
to the abandoned plan to start classes
after the Centennial Celebration is com
pleted. If so, they should adjust their
rates downward.
The housing authorities should also
take into account the fact that the major
ity of students affected by the cost of
summer-autumn interim housing are
either graduate students who have to
stay on campus to research their disser
tations during a period when they are
not necessarily funded, or foreign stu
dents who cannot afford to return to
homes far away.

Democracy subverted
by senate's allowing
fee requests in runoff
Once again, the ASSU Senate has
overruled the democratic procedure of
the spring election, as an attempt to cor
rect the 'uninformed' vote of Stanford
students. Within a week of the student
body's rejection of the fee requests of
three groups, the senate voted to allow
two of them another chance and modi
fied the third into a new group.
MEChA, one of the groups to be put
on the runoff ballot, proposed that they
should be put there for two reasons: one,
because they support the Chicano/Latino
community; and two, because their entry
in the election handbook was incomplete
and The Daily did not recommend that
students vote for their fee request. As for
the first claim, MEChA informed the
students of this before the first election,
and it is a fact commonly known anyway.
We are being asked to reconsider what
the voters already declared in the first
election — that as a university, a major
ity of voters does not feel the services
provided merit the fee request.
As for the second issue, the election
handbook was rife with confusion and
partial information. The referendum on
financial aid was not printed in the

handbook; the budgetary information
was poorly ordered and confusing. How
ever, this affected many groups, the
majority of which garnered their fee
request. The Daily did not recommend
themselves or AASA; both groups won
by substantial margins. They also did
not endorse three of the four COP slates
— should The Daily give every group an
endorsement? If so, why bother with the
endorsements at all? Given the senate's
new procedure, we might as well not
bother with fee requests at all; we can
just continue to hold elections until
every fee request wins.
In a similar action, XTV was put on
the ballot in order that the senate not be
"hypocritical." Arguments similar to
those against MEChA can be made
against this action. Students rejected
their fee request because they felt the
services provided were not worth the
large amount of money requested. I
doubt many students' votes were
affected by the absence of a budget in the
handbook.
Imagine if we held another presiden
tial election because Mike Dukakis failed
to receive an endorsement from a televi
sion network, or was not contacted for
an interview by, say, The New York
Times, or better yet, because Congress
didn't like the result and voted to hold
another election.

Interim-housing rent
increase hurts those
who have to stay here
I wonder how many students have
noticed rate increase that the Housing
Center has quietly passed on to us. I
refer to the drastic increase in the rates
for summer-autumn interim housing.
The rate listed in the summer housing
booklet for 1990 was $161.50. For sum
mer 1991, the rate for the same period of
interim housing has risen to $207, an
increase of just under 30 percent.
Could the Housing Center kindly
explain how such an increase is justified?
Perhaps they have made a mistake due
to the abandoned plan to start classes
after the Centennial Celebration is com
pleted. If so, they should adjust their
rates downward.
The housing authorities should also
take into account the fact that the major
ity of students affected by the cost of
summer-autumn interim housing are
either graduate students who have to
stay on campus to research their disser
tations during a period when they are
not necessarily funded, or foreign stu
dents who cannot afford to return to
homes far away.

New policy threatens
unique experience of
Alpha Sigma life
We are writing in response to what we
feel is unwarranted, unreasonable,
bureaucratic indifference. As Stanford
students, we have heard a great deal
about the importance of building com
munity and residence-based learning.
Contrary to this purported emphasis
on community, we feel strongly that
Alpha Sigma, which has for many years
been home to a unique experiment in
coed living modeled after fraternities and
sororities, is being unduly stripped of its
identity.
In 1973, the Stanford chapter of
Alpha Sigma became a coed brotherhood
and sisterhood and in 1983 was kicked
out of the national organization when
our female house president attempted to
attend a national convention. Ever since
that time, Alpha Sig has struggled to
maintain an identity melding the best of
Greek organizations within a more inclu
sive environment. Quite simply, Alpha
Sig is a house like no other.
Alpha Sig's unique position — as a
house in the Draw attempting to pre
serve a unique identity — was greatly
hurt when returning residency was dis
continued. At that time, houses attempt

ing to preserve unique identities were
given the modest recourse of a few addi
tional exempt spots in the Draw, allow
ing for a guaranteed core of returning
residents responsible for communicating
house traditions.
Now the University is attempting to
strip Alpha Sig of two of its five previ
ously exempt spots, leaving us wonder
ing if any commitment to the preserva
tion of this unique experiment exists.
We fear that individuals within the
University have extrapolated from a pre
disposition against housed fraternities —
which we are not — and a few com
plaints — which dramatically decreased
this year and are normal within any
house — to reach the conclusion that
Alpha Sig should be phased out.
Just as in any large family, we have
experienced growing pains and struggled
to find the best lifestyle which incorpo
rates diversity while preserving commu
nity. Naturally we have had problems,
and we work as a group to solve them,
learning about each other and ourselves
along the way.
We urge the University to reconsider
its decision to remove our exempt spots,
both for ourselves — we love this house
very much — and for past and future
generations of "Siggies" who, like any
campus community, deserve respect and
consideration.
