# From the home office of a deranged insect...

### John Ott Staff writer 
Last week (as if anyone in his right
mind reads this on a regular basis), a
group of devoted yet astute seniors,
hornswoggled by the perplexing cap
tion "WELCOME SRI" on the sign of a
local motel, implored me to unearth
the true meaning behind a mystery
which had long tormented them. Ini
tially I came up with this, my "Top
Ten" possible solutions to this mad
deningly elusive acronym "SRI":
10. Society for the Removal of Idaho
9. Sam's Roach-flavored Ice creams
8. Scatological Rot Infection
7. Salmon Rushdie Incognito
6. Syphilis Really Itches
5. Stuart Regis Impersonators
4. Santa's Rectal Interests
3. Shocking Rodent Indiscretions
2. Sexual Rambo Inside!
1. Stanford Research Institute
After minimal "research," however,
it became clear that the last explana
tion for the initials "SRI" was the cor
rect one, although I think we'd all like
to believe some of the others lie a
smidgen closer to the truth. And so,
once again, my most romantic ideals,

my most fanciful dreams, my most
soaring aspirations are dashed merci
lessly against the cold, unyielding
rocks of reality. Typical.
More unfortunate still, my current
investigation of various strange
goings-on at Green Library has been
delayed by a veritable smorgasbord of
unforeseen pitfalls, and as a result I
have no other questions for this week.
At least, that's my running excuse.
What I decided to do instead was to
call up a few friends and see what
queries they could provide for me. I
must first inform you, however, that I
run with a dangerous crowd of hood

lums and what follows is not for the
squeamish, children under two and
women in their third term of preg
nancy.
The first question I got was the
most common:
Don't you have anything better to
do?
Well, actually I do, but it involves
manacles, heated Crisco and duct tape.
Besides, the very fact that you, O naive
reader, in some strange indirect way
are paying me to foam at the mouth
like this makes me a little less of a
waste of skin than you â€” but not by
much.
Why is it we park on a driveway
and drive on a parkway ?
Smart ass. Any noodlehead who
spends any amount of time dreaming
up these nauseating linguistic riddles
should have his hamstrings sliced. Or,
worse still, make him watch "O God,
You Devil" until he bursts.
Why ask why?
Clearly one of my zanier comrades
in-arms has seen one too many recent
Bud Dry commercials. I rank this as
the most upsetting slogan to come out
of television advertising since Burger

King's "Sometimes You Gotta Break
The Rules." When you're naked and
vomiting on yourself at 5 a.m. next to a
dumpster because you drank one too
many pony kegs of Bud Dry, then per
haps you might ask yourself: "Why ask
why?"
Who are you ?
This question was at once so
remarkably simple and existentially
complex that I began to quiver with
ecstasy upon its utterance. Alas, I had
dialed the wrong number. (I think we
all saw that knee-sleeper coming up El
Camino like a gargantuan, inflated
Underdog on Thanksgiving Day.)
What kind of Bug are you ?
Actually this is a question I've been
hoping someone would ask me, but
since no one has yet, I thought I'd do it
myself. The answer, of course, is sim
ple: I'm a magg-Ott. Did that pun tick
you off? I thought it mite.
Lordy. I've got to lay off the caf
feine.

The BiXg firmly believes that Tostitos
are for sharing. Questions to the
Storke Publications Building or elec
