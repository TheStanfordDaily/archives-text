# Alpha Sig suspended in party investigation
## Five arrests at 'Exotic Erotic' prompt action 
### Brad O'Donnell 
After five people were arrested after last
Saturday's campus-wide Exotic Erotic
party, Alpha Sigma, the host residence, has
been placed on social suspension by Uni
versity officials.
The suspension, which took effect Tues
day, prohibits the house from holding social
activities pending the results of a Univer
sity investigation of underage drinking at
the party. Three Stanford students and two
non-students — including a prospective
freshman — were arrested in separate inci
dents on charges ranging from burglary
and resisting arrest to public intoxication.
Acting Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin said one student was so
drunk that he was unconscious in his room
and had to be rushed to Stanford Hospital.
Conklin added that the five arrests and the
severity of the drunkenness constituted
more than enough justification to suspend
the Alpha Sigs.
"We're not opposed to self-op houses
such as Alpha Sig," said Conklin in
response to the notion that the administra
tion is unsympathetic to fraternities and
independent houses. "But we are opposed

to underage drinking."
Conklin said the suspension could result
in penalties ranging from a warning to a
loss of house privileges, but added that
such drastic action is rare.
"We could conceivably revoke their self
op status and make them a U-op (univer
sity operated)," she said. "But that is the
most severe penalty."
Conklin said she knew of only one
instance in recent Stanford history in
which a non-fraternity house lost its inde
pendence. She said the administration has
been lenient with Alpha Sig before, how
ever.
The University is working indepen
dently of the police in its investigation and
learned of the arrests by checking the
police record. This policy has become com
monplace since the institution of the new
alcohol policy, said one Alpha Sig resident
who wished to remain anonymous.
Because the police didn't contact the
Alpha Sigs about the arrests during the
Exotic Erotic and because they hired secu
rity guards for the party, many residents
don't believe all the blame lies with the
