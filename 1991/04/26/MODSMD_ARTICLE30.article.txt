# Pro Fro triplets choose Stanford

### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Two's company, and three's a
crowded study room for Robin,
Nat and Boris Shoemaker, a set of
identical triplets from Paris,
Texas who visited the Farm this
week as prospective freshmen.
The trio, delayed at a Key Club
convention, missed the official
Pro Fro week, but came to Stan
ford anyway to see whether the
University might be a match for
their talents.
"We have been able to do every
thing," Robin said, fingering an
array of science fair medals
pinned to her blouse. "We want to
go to a college where we can find
other people as successful and
promising as we are."
"We don't know," Nat began,
"If we'll be able to find one,"
Boris added.
The triplets, who boast a com
bined, unweighted grade-point
average of 13.16, have dedicated
their free time to a variety of
activities from sports to commu
nity service.
Robin was a nationally ranked
volleyball player until a horseback
riding accident forced her to
switch to a low-impact sport. She
has worked her way up the ranks
in table tennis, and will be seeded
with world champions at the
Long-Duk Pong Tournament in
China this summer.
Both Nat and Boris are
bowlers. Together, they are team
captains of their state champi
onship-winning high school team,
the Paris Beavers. Nat said,
"Bowling demands perhaps more
finesse and concentration than

any other sport."
Boris agreed, "We like to think
of ourselves as surgeons of the
lanes." They considered turning
professional after graduation, but
decided against it because, "a pro
bowler with a bachelor's has just
that much more security," accord
ing to Boris.
The three have combined their
athletic abilities with community
service for three years running in
the Paris Ping-Pong and Bowling
Extravaganza, a fund raiser that
has generated more than $1,300
for the endangered beaver popula
tion. Said Robin, "We thought it
would be tragic if our school's

mascot were wiped out by urban
sprawl."
Paris' mayor Don Butts has
awarded the three with the "City
Spread-stoppers" award, this year
and last. They plan to continue
their environmental activism at
college, and are considering
founding a mascot-awareness pro
gram there, as well.
"We hear Stanford is having a
problem with eucalyptus trees,"
Nat said. "That is attractive to
us."
The identical triplets plan on
attending Stanford in the fall and
hope to draw into Branner Hall
together.


Prospective freshmen Nat, Boris and Robin Shoemaker are the first
Identical triplets to be admitted to Stanford.
