The Daily Palo Alto
Students were fortunate enough to attend a spe
cial lecture by Professor R. W. Doane titled "Insects
and Our Campus Trees." As an added bonus, the lec
ture was advertised as being "illustrated."
According to Doane, the deaths of several local
pine trees were due to "outbreaks of several different
species of beetles." He suggested several ways to
combat these pesky pests, but added, "Once a tree
has been attacked by beetles there is no way of sav
ing it." (This provoked a horrified gasp from the
crowd.)
Not that these insects aren't our friends. "Slides
and specimens of beetles were shown" at the lecture
so the audience could stroke these cuddly creatures.

The Stanford Daily-
Freshman Alan Bourke, who had been missing
since Jan. 6, showed up at his parents' home in Palo
Alto yesterday. According to The Daily, "Bourke had
been the subject of a widespread search all over the
United States." (Obviously, Bourke was missing so
long because it's so gosh-darn-hard to glue those pic
tures onto milk bottles.)
The student had informed no one of his where
abouts for three months. According to his father,
Bourke traveled extensively through the Northeast,
including Washington, D. C., where "he stayed for a
while seeing all the points of historical interest."
Bourke had decided to head east because "he just
had an urge to get away and couldn't seem to settle
down in school." (Can anyone sav "midterms"?)
