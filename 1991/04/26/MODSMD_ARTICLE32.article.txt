# Fear and loathing in fake leather boots
## 
### 
It was just my luck. Being the thrill-seeker
(not) that I am, I, last weekend, continued
my quest to visit all the sparsely populated
areas that I could. Last week: Alaska — today:
Montana. Maybe next week I'll really break
out and go to Escondido Village.
My travels took me to Helena, Mont, to visit
my childhood best friend. Lara had described
the area as having the friendliest of people and
being really homey "Homey" sounded so nice.
I just hoped it wouldn't be those ugly tract
homes.
I was the happiest of fillies when a hand
some young buck winked at me from his seat
across the aisle from me on the plane. His eyes,
blue as the Montana sky, blazed. His ivory
white teeth teased me when he smiled. I
couldn't help but think, "This cowboy must
dig my new boots."
I tried my damndest to look Montanan on
my trip. My biggest step was replacing my five
year-old, sole-less Keds with a "really fun pair
of boots" a saleswoman convinced me to buy.
Granted, the shoe personification thing was a
good sales tactic, but I really didn't find the
boots all that fun to hang out with.
As we entered our first of 40 beverage ser
vices during the flight, the winks continued.
Better yet, as we slowly climbed to our cruis
ing altitude of 38,000 feet, they became more
and more frequent. I could sense our pulses
mutually quicken as we began to level off.
Finally, the captain informed us that we
had reached our climax and could release our
seat belts to move about the cabin freely. I
turned to my fiightmate with an oxygen-defi
cient look — why were we flying so high? — to
find he had in fact reached HEM (Rapid Eye
Movement).
Unable to stand it anymore, he reached
over and pushed my button.
"You wouldn't happen to have any saline
solution?" he asked the flight attendant who
answered his call. "My contacts are really hug
ging my eyes."
The plane landed and I got off. My red
handkerchief flowing behind me, my too-small
Levis chafing my inner thighs, my boots simu
lating galloping wild horses, I ran off the plane
to see Lara. Too bad everyone else was dressed
in shorts and T-shirts, and the Muzak version
of "I wish they could all be California . . ." was

playing in the background.
It was to be a night of fun, and we began
driving to the Montana outback. First on the
agenda: cow tipping. Suddenly, a rabbit darted
under the wheels of the truck. We circled back
to see if it was OK, only to find it lying in the
middle of the road, quivering.
A miracle happened when a young veteri
narian pulled aside and said the animal would
be OK. She gave it a shot; amazingly, the ani
mal got up, hopped off about 20 yards and
turned, waving its little paw at us.
"What did you give it?" I asked.
"A hair rejuvenator with a permanent
wave," she answered.
Nighttime fell and we swarmed t he cow pas
ture. I watched Lara's friends simply walk up
to the cows and tip them over. Finally, 1
selected a small bovine which stood near the
edge of the pasture, staring at me with inno
cent eyes.
Fiercely, I pushed on the animal. Instead of
falling, it began to kick and chase me; over the
hills of cow doo, through the fruitful plains,
bootless, I ran. They had forgotten to tell me
that the cow had to be asleep.
Finally, the cow had me pushed up against a
fence. The lost innocence in its eyes told me it
wasn't going to leave until I did what 1 had
come to do. I really wasn't sure what was
appropriate, so I just gave 15 percent. Cow tip
ping really isn't that great. I just wondered
when wo were going to get our meal.
Exhausted, we turned in under the fake

stars on Lara's ceiling. Soon enough, another
night fell, and we were off to a Western dance
establishment.
I was so excited when a young man asked
me to two-step. Though I didn't really know
how, I figured I'd counted to two and walked
"in-step" before. No problem.
"Just try and keep up," I replied.
So much for winging it. The music was so
fast that 1 couldn't think of all the numbers
that came before two quickly enough. Thank
fully, he didn't seem embarrassed after 1 forgot
to grab his hand after he twirled me. A dark
shadow did flicker across his eyes after 1
knocked four couples over and slammed into
the simulated-wood railing. Good thing I still
didn't have any shoes to wear — that made
sliding across the floor much easier.
"Are you all hopped-out or what?" he whis
pered as the tune came to a close.
"No," I smiled . How neat that he chose
Western lingo to ask me dance again. "Come
branding cowboy, just try and lasso me," I
replied. Two can play that game.
"I'm really tired," he said. "I think I'll sit
this one out."
Only later did I find out that "hopped-out"
refers to beer hops, as in tanked, sunk, wasted,
blistered and soon to be praying to the porce
lain god. Great. You can have fun without alco
hol, you know.
Unfortunately, quick as I can't count to
two, it was time to leave beautiful Montana.
Thankfully, the plane home was almost empty,
except for two guys and an older woman
behind me. Only after I reached under my seat
to retrieve all the notes I had ever taken at
Stanford, which spilled out of my seven-inch,
three-ring binder during turbulence, did I
realize that 1 had been groping their feet for
about 10 minutes.
No winks for me on that plane ride, thank
you.
As I reached San Francisco International
Airport's baggage claim, I couldn't wait to
rush back and chat with my drawmates. 1 also
realized how great being able to continue my
relationship with my childhood best friend is,
even when I don't see her that often.
And, now it's easier than ever. Just pick up
the phone and dial. All it really takes is a cou
ple minutes.
