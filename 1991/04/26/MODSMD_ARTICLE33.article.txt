## Kemper has finally solved the riddle of second base 
### David Schwartz Staff writer 
"Who are you?"
"They call me the Riddler."
"The Riddler?"
"Yes. Ask David McCarty."
This year, Chris Kemper has
solved the riddle of his Cardinal
baseball career. He has been very
persistent, for, after three years in
the Stanford baseball program, he
had only stepped up to the plate
one time. Now, in his senior year,
he is the starting second baseman.
Kemper said, "being a senior I
hadn't really played a lot for the
last three years, and getting back
to playing every day was some
what difficult, because I just
wasn't used to it. But, the longer
the season has progressed, it's
just become easier and easier to
get back being comfortable play
ing the game both offensively and
defensively."
However, even though Kemper
had paid his dues in the program
so to speak by seeing little action
during the past three years, he
was by no means a shoo-in for the
second base slot. He had to battle
highly touted freshmen Matt
Bokemeier and Jeff DesJardins
for the position.
"I thought I had a little bit of
an edge, but I didn't really look at
it that way," said Kemper. "When
I was a freshman I took note of
the people ahead of me (Troy
Paulsen, Frank Carey). . . and my
goal was that when those people
left I just wanted the opportunity
to compete for a spot when there
wasn't already an incumbent
there. Possibly I had an edge
because I had three years experi

ence and knew the program a lit
tle better . . . but I was just happy
to have the opportunity to com
pete for a spot. That's all I could
ask for — if I didn't win it, I
couldn't blame it on anybody but
myself. It's worked out pretty
well."
Kemper has become more than
comfortable playing every day.
Despite not facing Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division pitch

ing until this season, he has han
dled the transition from reserve to
starter quite nicely. He is batting a
solid .279, with three home runs
and 20 runs batted in.
Coach Mark Marquess com
mented, "He's just played great —
great defense, giving us offense. I
think he's playing much better
than we had ever anticipated."
What Kemper prides himself
most upon is his defense. He has

made only four errors in 185
chances for a fielding percentage
of .979, and has turned 22 double
plays.
Kemper devotes complete con
centration to defense when on the
field. "I think the mental aspect
[of the game] is most important.
Many errors are caused not
because you're not capable of
making the play but because
you're not concentrating," Kern

per said.
"David Esquer, who is an assis
tant coach, gave me a great piece
of advice: Every pitch you have to
think, 'this ball is coming to me,'
because innings can get long and.
. . . It's hard to keep concentra
tion, so if you just think, 'every
pitch the ball is going to be hit to
me,' then I think that is by far the
best way to approach the defen
sive aspect of the game."
Marquess added, "the most
important thing in competing for
the (second base) job was being
able to play good defense, and he
has done that. ... He has commit
ted only four errors, made some
great plays, turns the double play
well, and he and (shortstop) Roger
Burnett compliment each other
quite well."
Wearing jersey No. 2, Kemper
puts on the mild-mannered
appearance of a typical Stanford
baseball player. But in the club
house, he is known as something
else. He explains, "there was a guy
on the team last year that they
called 'The Joker,' another 'Bat
man' villain, and this year some
one said we need a 'Joker' but we
can't have a 'Joker.' Then Dave
McCarty just started calling me
'The Riddler' and it's just kind of
stuck."
Kemper is not fazed though,
and takes the puns all in stride.
Marquess said, "He has a great
attitude. I think he's a real team
player and he does whatever it
takes to help us win. He'll sacri
fice bunt to move runners over; he
does the little things that a coach
really appreciates that don't
always show up in the stats. He's
a real winner."

The senior from Banks, Ore.,
has not limited himself to achieve
ment on the field. Because he was
not on the traveling squad the
first two years of his collegiate
career, Kemper had the opportu
nity to do other things. He got
involved in the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity, participated in
the Big Brothers/Little Brothers
program, and concentrated on his
studies.
"A lot of people ask me,
'wouldn't you have rather gone
somewhere else and played for
four years, [and] maybe lhavel
started for four years?"' said
Kemper. "I would say this is the
best program in the nation, and
one of the best schools in the
nation, and a combination like
that, there's no way I could have
passed it up and I've really
enjoyed the four years I've had
here."

In his first three seasons on the Farm, Chris Kemper got a total of one at bat. But this year he has
stepped Into the starting lineup and has played near-flawless defense at second base all season long.

best way to approach the defen
sive aspect of the game."
Marquess added, "the most
important thing in competing for
the (second base) job was being
able to play good defense, and he
has done that. ... He has commit
ted only four errors, made some
great plays, turns the double play
well, and he and (shortstop) Roger
Burnett compliment each other
quite well."
Wearing jersey No. 2, Kemper
puts on the mild-mannered
appearance of a typical Stanford
baseball player. But in the club
house, he is known as something
else. He explains, "there was a guy
on the team last year that they
called 'The Joker,' another 'Bat
man' villain, and this year some
one said we need a 'Joker' but we
can't have a 'Joker.' Then Dave
McCarty just started calling me
'The Riddler' and it's just kind of
stuck."
Kemper is not fazed though,
and takes the puns all in stride.
Marquess said, "He has a great
attitude. I think he's a real team
player and he does whatever it
takes to help us win. He'll sacri
fice bunt to move runners over; he
does the little things that a coach
really appreciates that don't
always show up in the stats. He's
a real winner."

The senior from Banks, Ore.,
has not limited himself to achieve
ment on the field. Because he was
not on the traveling squad the
first two years of his collegiate
career, Kemper had the opportu
nity to do other things. He got
involved in the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity, participated in
the Big Brothers/Little Brothers
program, and concentrated on his
studies.
"A lot of people ask me,
'wouldn't you have rather gone
somewhere else and played for
four years, [and] maybe lhavel
started for four years?"' said
Kemper. "I would say this is the
best program in the nation, and
one of the best schools in the
nation, and a combination like
that, there's no way I could have
passed it up and I've really
enjoyed the four years I've had
here."

In his first three seasons on the Farm, Chris Kemper got a total of one at bat. But this year he has
stepped Into the starting lineup and has played near-flawless defense at second base all season long.
"Who are you?"
"They call me the Riddler."
"The Riddler?"
"Yes. Ask David McCarty."
This year, Chris Kemper has
solved the riddle of his Cardinal
baseball career. He has been very
persistent, for, after three years in
the Stanford baseball program, he
had only stepped up to the plate
one time. Now, in his senior year,
he is the starting second baseman.
Kemper said, "being a senior I
hadn't really played a lot for the
last three years, and getting back
to playing every day was some
what difficult, because I just
wasn't used to it. But, the longer
the season has progressed, it's
just become easier and easier to
get back being comfortable play
ing the game both offensively and
defensively."
However, even though Kemper
had paid his dues in the program
so to speak by seeing little action
during the past three years, he
was by no means a shoo-in for the
second base slot. He had to battle
highly touted freshmen Matt
Bokemeier and Jeff DesJardins
for the position.
"I thought I had a little bit of
an edge, but I didn't really look at
it that way," said Kemper. "When
I was a freshman I took note of
the people ahead of me (Troy
Paulsen, Frank Carey). . . and my
goal was that when those people
left I just wanted the opportunity
to compete for a spot when there
wasn't already an incumbent
there. Possibly I had an edge
because I had three years experi

ence and knew the program a lit
tle better . . . but I was just happy
to have the opportunity to com
pete for a spot. That's all I could
ask for — if I didn't win it, I
couldn't blame it on anybody but
myself. It's worked out pretty
well."
Kemper has become more than
comfortable playing every day.
Despite not facing Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division pitch

ing until this season, he has han
dled the transition from reserve to
starter quite nicely. He is batting a
solid .279, with three home runs
and 20 runs batted in.
Coach Mark Marquess com
mented, "He's just played great —
great defense, giving us offense. I
think he's playing much better
than we had ever anticipated."
What Kemper prides himself
most upon is his defense. He has

made only four errors in 185
chances for a fielding percentage
of .979, and has turned 22 double
plays.
Kemper devotes complete con
centration to defense when on the
field. "I think the mental aspect
[of the game] is most important.
Many errors are caused not
because you're not capable of
making the play but because
you're not concentrating," Kern

per said.
"David Esquer, who is an assis
tant coach, gave me a great piece
of advice: Every pitch you have to
think, 'this ball is coming to me,'
because innings can get long and.
. . . It's hard to keep concentra
tion, so if you just think, 'every
pitch the ball is going to be hit to
me,' then I think that is by far the
best way to approach the defen
sive aspect of the game."
Marquess added, "the most
important thing in competing for
the (second base) job was being
able to play good defense, and he
has done that. ... He has commit
ted only four errors, made some
