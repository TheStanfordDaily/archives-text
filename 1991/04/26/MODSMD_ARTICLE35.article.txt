# Three Card players advance
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference
women's tennis championships
opened yesterday with a lot of
wind, a minor storm and a
weather front that was fairly pre
dictable.
Three Stanford players ad
vanced to today's quarterfinals by
posting a pair of singles wins
apiece. Two others were elimi
nated in the first round. Doubles
play gets underway today for the
two Stanford entries in the 16-
team draw.
Friendly Ojai, Calif, was not its
usual hospitable self as a gusting
breeze wrought havoc with any
shot that wasn't hit on a line. But
for senior Sandra Birch, none of
that mattered.
Birch won this event back in
1989, the year she captured the
NCAA singles crown, and looks
primed to make another run at
the title. The No. 1 seed at Pac-lOs
beat Arizona's Alix Creek in the
first round yesterday morning. In
the second round, Birch elimi
nated California's Cara Abe, who

had defeated UCLA's Iwalani
McCalla in round one.
The wins earned Birch a
chance to face Krista Amend of
Arizona State. Amend, ranked
32nd in the nation, pulled off
something of an upset by knock
ing out 15th-ranked Danielle
Scott of Arizona in her opening
match.
The road was smooth for senior
Teri Whitlinger, who is seeded sec
ond. She scored a first-round vic
tory over Cammie Foley of UCLA.
Foley employs the moonball to her
strategic advantage and could not
have been helped by the wind.
Whitlinger then bested Kristi
Jonkosky of Arizona State and
will meet Bruin senior Kirsten
Dreyer today. Dreyer knocked off
Cal's Emilie Viqueira, who is 13th

in the country.
Sophomore Heather Willens
also moved easily into the quar
ters. Willens scored victories over
Arizona State's Luann Klimchock
and the Golden Bears' Tiffiny Sil
veria. Today, Willens will battle
with UCLA's Kim Po, who elimi
nated Stanford's Kylie Johnson in
her first-rounder.
Stanford's worst news of the
day came when freshman Laxmi
Poruri dropped her opening
match to Cal's Lisa Albano. Had
Poruri beaten the nation's No. 6
player, and won another two
matches, her chances for a berth
in the NCAA singles field would
have been much greater.
Since Poruri is ranked just
73rd in the latest Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate poll, and will
not play an intercollegiate match
before nationals, she is all-but-off
ically eliminated from the individ
ual singles event. Stanford, which
has gotten used to placing five
women in the NCAA draw, will
have to settle for four this year.
A small firestorm occurred off
the court at the annual coaches
meeting. UCLA coach Bill Zaima
has drawn criticism this season
for shuffling his singles lineup —
oftentimes seemingly at random
— in what is viewed as an attempt
to gain a matchup advantage
against a given opponent.
There is an unwritten rule
against doing that since it isn't in
the spirit of sportsmanship. How
ever, a written rule exists as well.
The Pac-10 prohibits coaches
from moving a player more than
one spot up or down in the lineup
on a given weekend. If Heather
Willens played No. 4 against Ari
zona on Friday, for instance, she
could play at No. 3 or 5 — but not
No. 6 — Saturday versus Arizona
State.
Zaima was moving players two
or three spots this season, but
won't any longer. The coaches
voted to enforce the existing rule,
declining to accept the more rigor
ous statute on the men's side.
That rule prohibits any lineup
changes on the weekend except
those required by injuries.
Card notes
Doubles play opens today with sec
ond seeds Poruri and Whitlinger fac
ing off against Viqueira and Lisa
Parks of California. Willens and
Emma Woodhouse will meet
another Cal tandem, Abe and Ellen
Walliser. UCLA's Po and Stella
Sampras are the No. 1 seeds.
The second best player not at Pac
10s (the first being the Cardinal's
Debbie Graham) is USC's Trlsha
Laux. The true student-athlete
skipped last year's event as well to
concentrate on academics.


Tracy Allen — Dally file
Freshman Laxml Porurl fell to third-seeded Lisa Albano of California
In the first round of the Pac-10 Individual tournament yesterday. Her
loss insures she will not make the 64-player NCAA singles field but
she and Teri Whitlinger begin play in the Pac-10 doubles tournament
today.
