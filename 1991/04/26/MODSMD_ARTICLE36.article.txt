## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The steamroller is gathering
momentum.
Picking up right where it left
off last weekend, the men's tennis
team dominated the competition
yesterday at the Pacific 10 Indi
vidual Championships. Cardinal
competitors won every one of
their first-round singles matches,
and all but one of their second
round contests during the first
day of play at Ojai, Calif.
"It was just a great day, " asst.
coach John Whitlinger said.
"Everybody played very, very well,
in both the singles and invita
tional bracket. The guys should be
very pleased with their perfor
mances."
As there are no team standings
involved, players are competing
only for personal finishes and
tournament experience before the
NCAA finals.
The Cardinal is looking good on
both accounts.
No. 1 seed Alex O'Brien —
recently ranked fourth nationally
in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings — had no trouble han
dling USC's Phil Whitesell 7-5, 6-
0 in the first round of the main
draw. Jared Palmer downed Rob
Grant of Arizona 6-4, 6-4, and the
quickly rebounding Jonathan
Stark out-maneuvered Wildcat

Ringo Navarossa 7-5, 6-4.
Jason Yee followed O'Brien's
example and warmed up to
always-tough Trojan Brian Mac-
Phie in the second set. Yee cruised
to a 7-5, 6-0 victory over the
nationally ranked player. Vimal
Patel continued the domination
by holding off California's Tom
Phanco 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford's invitational bracket
competitors left their opponents
wondering what hit them as well.
Freshman Michael Flanagan
demolished Mark Van Ornum 6-1,
6-1 and Chris Cocotos downed
USC's Chad Rosser 6-2, 6-1.
Glenn Solomon had a first round
bye.
"It was a continuation of last
week's play," Whitlinger said.
"We'll just keep going, and try to
get better every week until May
20 [the NCAA tournament]."
Cardinal competitors had little
trouble in the afternoon's second
round. It was a Stanford-UCLA
affair, with the Cardinal coming
up on the victor's side of the net
for the second consecutive week.
O'Brien continued his confer
ence dominance by whipping
UCLA's Fritz Bissell 6-1, 6-3. Yee
held off Bruin Jason Sher 7-5, 6-2,
and Patel pulled off one of the
great victories of his young Stan
ford career by outlasting 1990
NCAA singles finalist Jason Net
ter 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. Stark notched

the most impressive Cardinal win
of the day by beating No. 1 Bruin
competitor Mark Knowles 6-2, 2-
6, 6-4.
"I'm real happy with Jon's
play," Whitlinger said. "Nobody
knew how he would do after the
injury, but he's already close to
where he was last year, and is get
ting even better."
The lone Stanford defeat of the
day came in the form of Palmer,
who was beaten by USC's Jon
Leach 6-3, 6-2.
"Jared played well, but so did
Jon [Leach]. It was a good
match," Whitlinger added.

Solomon opened play by quickly
defeating Billy Miller 6-1, 6-3.
Flanagan continued the Cardinal
momentum, demolishing Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo's Eric Sao
6-2, 6-1. Cocotos made it three for
three by downing UCLA's Matt
Quinlan 6-2, 6-2.
Stanford has the most competi
tors still standing after the first
day of battle, and seven of the
eight singles players will take to
the courts tomorrow in the third
round of play.

"Jon and Pedersen should be a

The steamroller is gathering
momentum.
Picking up right where it left
off last weekend, the men's tennis
team dominated the competition
yesterday at the Pacific 10 Indi
vidual Championships. Cardinal
competitors won every one of
their first-round singles matches,
and all but one of their second
round contests during the first
day of play at Ojai, Calif.
"It was just a great day, " asst.
coach John Whitlinger said.
"Everybody played very, very well,
in both the singles and invita
tional bracket. The guys should be
very pleased with their perfor
mances."
As there are no team standings
involved, players are competing
only for personal finishes and
tournament experience before the
NCAA finals.
The Cardinal is looking good on
both accounts.
No. 1 seed Alex O'Brien —
recently ranked fourth nationally
in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings — had no trouble han
dling USC's Phil Whitesell 7-5, 6-
0 in the first round of the main
draw. Jared Palmer downed Rob
Grant of Arizona 6-4, 6-4, and the
quickly rebounding Jonathan
Stark out-maneuvered Wildcat

Ringo Navarossa 7-5, 6-4.
Jason Yee followed O'Brien's
example and warmed up to
always-tough Trojan Brian Mac-
Phie in the second set. Yee cruised
to a 7-5, 6-0 victory over the
nationally ranked player. Vimal
Patel continued the domination
by holding off California's Tom
Phanco 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford's invitational bracket
competitors left their opponents
wondering what hit them as well.
Freshman Michael Flanagan
demolished Mark Van Ornum 6-1,
6-1 and Chris Cocotos downed
USC's Chad Rosser 6-2, 6-1.
Glenn Solomon had a first round
bye.
"It was a continuation of last
week's play," Whitlinger said.
"We'll just keep going, and try to
get better every week until May
20 [the NCAA tournament]."
Cardinal competitors had little
trouble in the afternoon's second
round. It was a Stanford-UCLA
affair, with the Cardinal coming
up on the victor's side of the net
for the second consecutive week.
O'Brien continued his confer
ence dominance by whipping
UCLA's Fritz Bissell 6-1, 6-3. Yee
held off Bruin Jason Sher 7-5, 6-2,
and Patel pulled off one of the
great victories of his young Stan
ford career by outlasting 1990
NCAA singles finalist Jason Net
ter 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. Stark notched

the most impressive Cardinal win
of the day by beating No. 1 Bruin
competitor Mark Knowles 6-2, 2-
6, 6-4.
"I'm real happy with Jon's
play," Whitlinger said. "Nobody
knew how he would do after the
injury, but he's already close to
where he was last year, and is get
ting even better."
The lone Stanford defeat of the
day came in the form of Palmer,
who was beaten by USC's Jon
Leach 6-3, 6-2.
"Jared played well, but so did
Jon [Leach]. It was a good
match," Whitlinger added.
In the invitational bracket
Solomon opened play by quickly
defeating Billy Miller 6-1, 6-3.
Flanagan continued the Cardinal
momentum, demolishing Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo's Eric Sao
6-2, 6-1. Cocotos made it three for
three by downing UCLA's Matt
Quinlan 6-2, 6-2.
Stanford has the most competi
tors still standing after the first
day of battle, and seven of the
eight singles players will take to
the courts tomorrow in the third
round of play.
Four of the eight quarterfinal
ists in the main draw will be wear

He faces the tournament's No. 2
seed, Bent Pedersen of Cal. In the
fourth quarter USC's Leach will
play Bruin David Nainkin.
"Jon and Pedersen should be a
great match. The courts are play
ing fast which should favor Jon.
We'll see." said Whitlinger. "And
we won't have to coach in one
match. We can just watch Jason
and Vimal."
