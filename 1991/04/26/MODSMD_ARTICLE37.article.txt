# Edwards hoping to bowl over Bears

Cardinal jumper Jackie
Edwards has had a lot of experi
ence in international athletic com
petition. She was a member of the
national junior track team in the
Bahamas since she we 12.
Edwards was also her coun
try's junior champion two years in
a row, not in track but in bowling.
"In the Bahamas they had
inter-high school bowling like you
have volleyball and track. I used
to go every Saturday and watch
my brother bowl for my school,"
she said.
Edwards proved she was quite
able to knock the pins down as
well. One of four juniors chosen to
represent the Bahamas in inter
national tournaments, she trav
eled to Florida to face entries from
28 countries including the U.S.,
Canada and Venezuela.
Edwards placed fourth in sin
gles and second in doubles. She
likens the pressure on individual
performance in track to that in
bowling, where "its just you and
the lane."
By the time she was racking up
the bowling trophies, she was
already an established long
jumper. She participated in the
junior Pan Am Games and the
Central American and Caribbean
Championships.
As a youngster Edwards did
not pursue track; rather it pur
sued her. A premiere Bahamian
athlete and the man after which
Edwards' high school track is
named, Thomas Robinson, asked
her to practice under him. He had

seen her in a meet and wanted to
develop her talents for competing
on the national team.
"I didn't want to go. I was cry
ing for weeks. My mother made
me go," Edwards said.
Her long jumping improved by
leaps and bounds during high
school. By senior year she was
jumping 20 feet, seven inches.
That mark would be the fourth
best in the Pacific 10 Conference
this year.
A much sought-after athlete,
Edwards had always planned on
going to college in the U.S. She
was considering LSU, Florida and
Florida State.
"I wasn't thinking about Stan
ford at all. It never crossed my
mind, not even in the slightest
way," she said.
Edwards was surprised when a
Stanford assistant coach called
her. The assistant heard of
Edwards from a Bahamian triple
jumper the coach had formerly
mentored at the University of
Houston.
One recruiting trip was enough
to convince Edwards to don the
cardinal and white. "I didn't go on
any other recruiting trips (after
here). I just forgot about the rest,"
she said.
Coming to Stanford did have
its drawbacks, however. Fresh
man year Edwards nearly quit
because of difficulties adjusting,
differences with coaches and gen
eral disappointment with her per
formance on the field.
But now the junior is getting
more satisfaction from track. She
set the school record for the long
jump at Texas Relays and set a

personal best in the triple jump
with a 41-foot, 7 1/4-inch leap.
She is inches away from the
NCAA Championship automatic
qualifying standards in both
events.
An intense competitor, she
focuses intently on her tasks dur
ing a meet. "I'm thinking so much
about all the things I have to do. If
I don't think about them they
don't automatically happen
because there are certain things I
haven't done enough yet,"

I'm thinking so much
about all the things I
have to do. If I don't
think about them they
don't automatically
happen because
there are certain
things I haven't done
enough yet.'

Edwards said.
Mental imagery plays a large
role in her preparation. "I have to
picture [my jump} in my head,
myself actually in the air, exactly
what I do. I kind of got the first
part of my jump down. I now have
to think about my landing," she
said.
Edwards plans to use a new
landing technique this Saturday
when Stanford takes on Califor
nia. The Cardinal hasn't beaten
both the Golden Bears men's and

women's squads in Big Meet for as
long as anyone can remember
Last year, however, the final race
decided the meet. Tomorrow's
meet starts at 1 p.m.
Stanford has an excellent shot
to win Big Meet at home this year.
The team is undefeated in dual
meets and a lot of it has to do with
Edwards' strong performances in
sprints and jumps.
This weekend she hopes to
score a lot of points in the 100
meters, 4xloo, long jump and pos
sibly he triple jump and the 200.
Not only may her skill intimi
date Cal but her attire might as
well. In meets against Berkeley
Edwards typically wears a white
T-shirt emblazoned with big red
letters reading "BEAT CAL."
"It's kind of fun. People shout
out stuff from the stands like
'Take that shirt off.' I hope they
don't take it the wrong way, like
I'm being arrogant.
"Especially this weekend
you've just got to come with some
sort of attitude, so they know we
aren't fooling around," she said.
One thing Edwards does not
fool around about is her future. If
her jumping goes well she wants
to try to make the Bahamian
Olympic team. And if she's not in
Barcelona she'll be in law school.
The psychology major plans to
take the LSATs next fall and may
use her continued student status
to extend her visa. Then she could
keep training in this country.
Edwards has learned to be effi
cient and organized with her full
schedule of track and academics.
But then again, there's no time to
spare when you're in the fast lane.

After not even considering Stanford as a college choice, Jackie
Edwards has become the school record-holder in the long jump.
She will be counted on tomorrow when the Cardinal meets Cal.
