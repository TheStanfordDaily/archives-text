# Card readies for Big Row

Ahhh. Spring quarter, at last. The sun
should be out soon, school is almost over,
and many students are starting to reflect
on the past year. Seniors will soon be leav
ing the Farm for the last time and freshmen
will be leaving their memorable freshman
dorms and freshman activities.
For a surprisingly large number in the
Class of 1994, novice, or freshmen, crew
was at the top of the list of Stanford pas
times. Why is crew always so popular
among incoming freshmen? And where do
they all disappear to in spring when the
team finally starts racing?
Women's novice coach Wendy Davis
offered some answers. "The big attraction
comes from dorms. You start talking about
crew at the dinner table and people decide
to turn out. Some years it is Roble, other
years it's Wilbur."
During her eight years coaching the Car
dinal crew team, Davis has seen three basic
types of people turning out for freshmen
crew.
"There are the really good high school
athletes who want to do a sport in college
but aren't good enough for the swim team
or track team. Then there are those who
never did sports in high school and those
who did a little and see crew as a nice way to
stay in shape."
But crew is much more than just an
activity to burn off a few calories. Soon the
athletes realize the time commitment and
the effort involved. This is when, Davis
notes, "many of the people in the second
and third groups end up stopping."
"They may stick it out for fall quarter to
get the credit but they don't want to put in
the time that it takes," said Davis. In the
beginning, the rowers train for about 12

hours a week. During winter quarter they
are up to 19, and by race season in spring
they spend about 25 hours a week with the
team.
In the beginning, about 90 guys turned
out for the men's team. Now that figure is
down to 22. One of those who stuck with it
is Justin Kitch, a freshman from Wichita,
Kansas.
He turned out for crew because, "I got
cut from baseball and I wanted to do some
thing athletic. Crew is a more noble sportâ€”
it's all about comraderie, working as a
team. It's a very refined, precision sport."
Kitch's father rowed in college for Yale
and that may have also influenced him. But
this frosh, like many other rowers,
attributes his dedication to the sense of
accomplishment he gets.
"Waking up is really hard, but once
you're on the water it's nice. I get a real
sense of accomplishment from knowing
that I've done this," said Kitch.
The coaches also use this feeling as an
incentive for the rowers. "We tell them that
they'll make the sacrifices but then after a
race, they'll have a high which 90 percent of
the campus can't have," said Davis.
Close friendships and a strong sense of
accomplishment seem to be the rewards for
those freshmen who keep rowing. Starting
off as just one of many activities thrown at
Stanford students, crew often becomes an
unexpected bonus in the "Stanford experi
ence."
