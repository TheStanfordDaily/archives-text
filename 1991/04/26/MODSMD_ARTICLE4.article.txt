# ACLU won't support Reges due to '72 case
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Twenty years ago, the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union spent a
large amount of time and money
to represent Bruce Franklin, a
vocal anti-war Stanford professor
who was fired for inciting a riot.
Franklin tried — and failed —
several times to regain his posi
tion.
That experience left a bad taste
in the ACLU's mouth.
As a result, the organization
has refused to represent Com
puter Science Senior Lecturer

Stuart Reges because it believes
the two cases are similar, accord
ing to Les Ernest, an ACLU vol
unteer.
Reges claims he openly violated
Stanford's drug rules to protest
U.S. drug policy. He also admitted
he advised a drug-using student to
experiment with MDA, and
amphetamine-derived drug.
These actions have stirred a
debate about the distinction
between protected free speech and
punishable conduct.
Ernest, a former Stanford pro
fessor and former associate chair
man of the Computer Science
Department, mediated discussion
between Reges and the ACLU.
The union "lost a bundle of
money" over Franklin, he said,
adding that the ACLU thinks that
Reges' case "bears some resem
blance" to Franklin's and that
"it'll be difficult to win in a legal
sense."
In 1972, a seven-member fac
ulty advisory board chaired by
then-Biology Professor Donald
Kennedy voted 5-2 to dismiss
Franklin. However, Kennedy —
along with Religion Prof. Robert
Brown — voted in support of
Franklin. Kennedy recommended
that Franklin be suspended with
out pay for one quarter and with
pay for another.
Kennedy, now University Pres
ident, could not be reached for
comment late yesterday after
noon.
On Jan. 23, 1972, the Board of
Trustees voted to fire Franklin —
the only tenured professor ever
fired by Stanford.
A vocal Marxist, Maoist and
popular English professor, he
spoke out against the Vietnam
War and often sparked anger in
the administration.
Franklin attended a war rally
on Feb. 10, 1971 in White Plaza,
where in the concluding speech he
exhorted students "to begin to
shut down the most obvious
machinery of war, such as . . . the
computational center."
More than 200 students broke
into the center and occupied it for
three hours, causing $800 of dam
age. As they began to leave the
center, more than 100 riot police
attempted to disperse the crowd.
According to witnesses,
Franklin urged the students to

stay and confront the police. Dur
ing the conflict with police, two
students were shot and 11 others
also injured.
That evening another rally was
held in the Old Union courtyard.
There Franklin further urged the
students to protest violently.
University President Richard
Lyman suspended Franklin with
pay Feb. 13, and a year-long series
of dismissal hearings followed.
The advisory board's majority
opinion stated that "Incitement to
illegal conduct ... is an abuse of
power. . . . Advocacy is punish
able, if it is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to produce
such action."
"We believe the speech of a fac
ulty member to a campus audi
ence on campus issues is subject
to regulations," but added that
restraint on free speech wouldn't
"chill open and robust discus
sion," the statement read.
Kennedy and Brown, in their
minority opinion, agreed that
Franklin's actions were serious
but disagreed with his dismissal,
noting that "suspension itself is a
severe penalty."
They stated the situation
required "careful weighing of
costs of dismissal to the Univer
sity relative to the risks of future
violations."
It read, "The University
thrives on diversity and challenge.
When we lose a prominent symbol
of these qualities, we lose not only
the substance of the challenge,
but also the exterior perception
that we can take it in stride.
"In some quarters, the latter
effect could be dangerous — for
example, less well-buffered uni
versities may become more vul
nerable to outside pressures to get
rid of controversial faculty mem
bers," the opinion continued.
"The University is obliged to
tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like."
