# Golfers head for snow

### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
In a tune-up for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships next week, the Car
dinal men's golf team journeyed to play
today and tomorrow in the Cougar ('las
sie at the Riverside Country Club in
Provo, Utah.
"We came to this tournament with
the idea of sharpening our edge for the
Pac-10's and to support coach Tucker,"
Cardinal coach Wally Goodwin said.
Brigham Young coach Karl Tucker is
a life-long friend of Goodwin, who
"encouraged" Goodwin to enter his golf
coaching career after a series of coaching
positions related to football, basketball,
baseball and swimming, among others.
Tucker's host Cougars figure to be
the Cardinal's toughest competition for
the tourney title â€” if the tournament
even occurs. Yesterday, snow interrupted
Stanford's practice around noon.
"It was so cold that we came in and
took showers for an hour before going to
lunch," said Goodwin.
Tucker has coached at BYU for 29
years and his team will not be too fraz
zled by the chill factor and intermittent
snow flurries.
But the Cardinal is not completely
devoid of weather-hardened players.
Sophomore Dave Rutkowski, playing in
the third position after shooting a daz
zling 217 as an individual in the U.S.
Intercollegiate last weekend, is a native
of Traverse City, Minn. And young fresh
man sensation Notah Begay, from Albu
querque, N.M., is not a stranger to harsh
weather conditions.
Christian Cevaer, a junior who fin

ished sixth in the U.S. Intercollegiate,
and freshman Casey Martin will lead the
Cardinal at the top two slots.
After shooting a fantastic round of
golf just off Rutkowski's mark, sopho
more Brad Lanning will be at No. 4,
while Edwin Lee, a junior, is making his
first appearance in a major this year.
Sophomore Mike Milliken is skipping
the tournament to sooth the tendinitis
in his knees.
"Edwin has always been real close in
the line-up, but this is his first big
appearance," said Goodwin. "He's been
the first guy up in the morning, the first
guy in the van and eating the largest
breakfast of anybody. He's really
excited."
Texas-El Paso, Washington and New
Mexico also will challenge the Cardinal
for the tournament crown. UTEP sur
prised the Cardinal two weeks ago in the
Etonic Southwest Intercollegiate with a
phenomenal final day, but Stanford
rebounded to edge them in the U.S.
Intercollegiate.
Goodwin is concerned about Washing
ton because "they shot one great round"
in the U.S. Intercollegiate, and New
Mexico because of their 285 on the final
day of the same tourney in which the
Cardinal shot 286.
The Riverside Country Club is a
course much different from the courses
that the Cardinal has played on recently.
"It's not a long course," said Good
win. "There are five or six par-4's under
400 yards, but there are also two creeks
and three or four big lakes.
"It's in great shape. It's fast and hard
with shallow dog-legs that turn sharply
to the rieht or left."
