# Statement by Donald Kennedy

### 
The Chief of Naval Re
search has decided to cancel
Stanford's Memoranda of
Understanding with the Navy
and set the University's provi
sional indirect-cost rate for Fis
cal Year 1991 at 55.5 percent.
We regret this action, but we
are determined to work with
the Navy and the Defense
Contract Audit Agency over
the next several months to
develop new methods of indi
rect cost allocation to replace
those contained in the Memo
randa of Understanding.
It is impossible to estimate
the actual dollar impact on the
University at this time because
this is only a drop in a provi
sional or temporary rate,
which will be revised when
actual data become available.
This year's final indirect cost
rate will not be determined for
at least a year.
Meanwhile, the Office of

Management and Budget
announced on April 22 that
the Bush administration is
engaged in a broad effort to
develop reforms in indirect
cost policies for administra
tion, facilities and equipment.
OMB has also generated a list
of proposed "unallowable
cost" categories. We applaud
this effort to accomplish a
central government policy for
the support of university
research, and we note that
the list of unallowable costs
conforms to many of the prac
tices we have already adopt
ed at Stanford during the cui
rent audit.
Knowledgeable observers
inside and outside the Univer
sity believe that the 55.5 per
cent provisional rate is far
below that needed to recover
Stanford's real costs of con
ducting federally sponsored
research. Stanford will pro

ceed promptly with new stud
ies to document its indirect
costs. Final costs for the year
will be determined after audit,
and difference between the
provisional and the audited
rates will be carried forward as
an adjustment to the rate in
future years.
The University will certainly
weather the one- or two-year
transition that we predict. It is
prepared to make the neces
sary financial commitments to
ensure that the University's
programs of instruction and
research do not sustain seri
ous damage in this period. For
the longer term, the prospect
is for a new system that will
include far more costly
accounting requirements and
provide more uniform stan
dards for indirect-cost recov
ery at research universities
nationwide.
