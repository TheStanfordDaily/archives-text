# Packard says Congress to blame

WASHINGTON (AP) - For
mer Deputy Secretary of Defense
David Packard said yesterday that
inappropriate use of tax money by
colleges conducting federally
financed research is "primarily
the fault of Congress."
Packard said the legislative
branch never responded to the
recommendations of a White
House panel he headed in 1986.
That commission called for estab
lishing a fixed rate of overhead
expenses to be paid by the federal
government to institutions doing
such research.
Packard, chairman of the board
of the Hewlett-Packard Co., said
in prepared testimony that "it is
the oversight responsibility of the
Congress to determine whether
the taxpayer is receiving full value
for the federal dollars spent on
research at universities."
He said such audit controls
have not been implemented, and
said, "It is primarily the fault of
the Congress."
Packard was among witnesses
called before a House science sub
committee, which is among sev
eral congressional panels holding
hearings into spending abuses
involving some colleges that get
federal research dollars.

It is the oversight responsibility of the
Congress to determine whether the taxpayer
is receiving full value for the federal dollars
spent on research at universities.'
â€” David Packard

The manner in which the fed
eral government is billed for indi
rect expenses associated with the
conduct of research work under
contract, including capital costs,
room space, equipment and the
like, has come under increasing
scutiny in recent weeks.
What triggered the newfound
congressional interest was a
recent audit at Stanford Univer
sity. It revealed the Palo Alto,
Calif.-based school had charged
the government for expenses
related, among other things, to a
$1,200 antique commode, a
$10,000 set of donated silverware
and a university-owned shopping
center.
Stanford got more unwelcome
news yesterday. The Office of
Naval Research said it cancelled
more than 90 agreements with

Stanford on how to allocate over
head costs, and declared that it
would pay only 55.5 percent of the
value of a research contract
toward the university's overhead.
Stanford had been charging 70
percent, though not every
research sponsor, and not even
every government agency, paid
that much. The university
received $139 million in direct
federal research grants and con
tracts in 1989 and an additional
$100 million in indirect costs, or
contribution to overhead.
Earlier this week, the White
House Office of Management and
Budget proposed to limit the
kinds of expenses that can be
charged to the government by uni
versities conducting federally
financed research.
