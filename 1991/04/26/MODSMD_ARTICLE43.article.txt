# Stanford's costly controversy
## What goes up... 
### 
Stanford's indirect-cost rate was 56% in
1976. During the next 15 years, the rate
jumped to 74%. The University proposed a
rate of 78% for this year. Then Office of
Naval Research resident representative
Paul Biddle entered the picture. Biddle
insisited that Stanford's rate was far too
high. Responding to Biddle's concerns,
the chief of naval research sent in a
negotiating team which knocked the
University's rate down several times this
year. Yesterday's decision slashed the rate
to 55.5%, below its 1976 level.
