# Q&A on MOUs
## 
### 
The huge drop yesterday in
Stanford's provisional indirect
cost rate was largely due to the
Navy's cancellation of its memo
randa of understanding, or
MOUs, with the University. What
follows is an attempt to clarify
some of the technical details sur
rounding these accounting
agreements.
What are memoranda of
understanding?
MOUs are accounting agree
ments entered into by a university
and the government agencies
responsible for overseeing the
university's cost-recovery claims.
The Office of Naval Research is
the agency that regulates Stan
ford's research practices.
There are various types of
MOUs. The agreements may
address one-time events, for
example, allowing a substitute
signature on a document that was
supposed to be signed by a
researcher who is deceased.
Or they have may have much
larger consequences, such as
replacing the government's
"default" methodology for calcu
lating indirect costs associated
with a university's library with a
method both parties believe more
equitably reflects the real costs
incurred by the university.
In some cases, the university
benefits from having an MOU in
place because it is able to recover
more money than would other
wise be possible under federal
rules. In other cases, the govern
ment benefits. Some of the agree
ments are intended to eliminate
paperwork and simplify account
ing procedures and do not neces
sarily benefit either party.
Stanford's agreements were
signed by officials in the Univer
sity controller's office and by local
representatives of the Office of
Naval Research.
How many MOUs did Stan
ford have?
It is not clear exactly how many
MOUs Stanford and the Navy had
entered into during the last
decade. Stanford says the num
ber is 86. The Office of Naval
Research contends it is more
than 100.
According to federal auditors,
about a dozen of the agreements
accounted for roughly 80 percent
of the cost-impact of the MOUs.
Why did Stanford have so
many MOUs?
Stanford officials say that in
1979, when federal rules on
indirect-cost recovery were
revised, an opportunity arose to
clarify business practices with
the Navy. The revision pre
sented "an unusual opportunity
to start writing down more,"
says Janet Sweet, the assistant
controller in charge of indirect
cost recovery. Most of the new
MOUs were the result of docu

menting practices Stanford and
the Navy had been following for
years, Sweet says.
Federal regulator Paul Biddle
sees things differently.
Since the controversy began,
Biddle has contended the large
number of MOUs resulted from a
"cozy" relationship between Stan
ford and Office of Naval Research
representatives. "It appears that
anything the University felt might
be beneficial to them has been
characterized as an MOU," Biddle
told The Daily in November.
The MOUs, Biddle says, were
far too generous to Stanford,
allowing the University to recover
around $200 million that it wasn't
entitled to during the last
decade.
Did Stanford have more
MOUs than other research uni
versities?
Until yesterday, Stanford had
far more MOUs than any other
university. MIT, with 13, has the
next highest number of MOUs
among those schools overseen
by the Office of Naval Research.
Many schools have no MOUs.
Why were Stanford's MOUs
canceled?
An agreement between Stan
ford and the Navy was reached in
December to review all the MOUs
that had been put in place during
the last decade.
Yesterday, the Navy decided to
cancel all but one of the MOUs for
this year and future years. The
decision did not affect the status
of the MOUs in past years.
A report released in February
by the Inspector General of Chief
of Naval Research found that
Navy representatives had not
obtained proper audit and legal
reviews on the MOUs, as required
by Navy regulations. "Consider
ing the lack of formal audits on
MOUs and the significant
increase in the indirect-cost rates
there is the potential that Stanford
charged the government too
much indirect costs," the report
said.
Two other federal agencies —
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency and the Department of
Health and Human Services —
had also called for termination of
the MOUs.
How does today s decision
affect past years?
At least for the time being,
there is no effect on past years.
The University has obtained a
legal opinion stating that MOUs
are valid, binding contractual
agreements.
Biddle and some federal audi
tors believe the MOUs are to be
used for price proposals only and
do not constitute contracts.
If the Navy attempts to disallow
Stanford's use of MOUs in the
past, the University is likely to liti
gate

far more MOUs than any other
university. MIT, with 13, has the
next highest number of MOUs
among those schools overseen
by the Office of Naval Research.
Many schools have no MOUs.
Why were Stanford's MOUs
canceled?
An agreement between Stan
ford and the Navy was reached in
December to review all the MOUs
that had been put in place during
the last decade.
Yesterday, the Navy decided to
cancel all but one of the MOUs for
this year and future years. The
decision did not affect the status
of the MOUs in past years.
A report released in February
by the Inspector General of Chief
of Naval Research found that
Navy representatives had not
obtained proper audit and legal
reviews on the MOUs, as required
by Navy regulations. "Consider
ing the lack of formal audits on
MOUs and the significant
increase in the indirect-cost rates
there is the potential that Stanford
charged the government too
much indirect costs," the report
said.
Two other federal agencies —
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency and the Department of
Health and Human Services —
had also called for termination of
the MOUs.
How does today s decision
affect past years?
At least for the time being,
there is no effect on past years.
The University has obtained a
legal opinion stating that MOUs
are valid, binding contractual
agreements.
Biddle and some federal audi
tors believe the MOUs are to be
used for price proposals only and
do not constitute contracts.
If the Navy attempts to disallow
Stanford's use of MOUs in the
past, the University is likely to liti
gate
