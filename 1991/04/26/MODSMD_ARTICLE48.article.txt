# Civil engineering major to change
## 
### David Toy Staff writer 
The civil engineering
will have an additional track
next fall, but additional
requirements will not be a part
of the change.
A six-person committee
from the Civil Engineering
Department decided last sum
mer to add an environmental
specialty to the major and add
to the core itself without
increasing the 100-plus unit
requirement.
Department Chair Haresh
Shaw said he intends the
changes, which were conceived
in 1989, to revitalize under
graduate teaching in the
department. As a result, every
faculty member will be teach
ing at least one undergraduate
course next fall.
Asst. Prof. Jeffrey Koseff
adds, "There has always been a
strong environmental section
for graduates. We've now made
classes specifically for under
graduates."
Twenty-five units within
the major will be devoted to
specialty courses in two fields:
Structures and Construction
and the new Environmental
and Water Studies.
Both specialized areas will
be emphasized by reducing to
20 the number of general core
units required.
"We have longer specific

tracks now for both sides and
the tracks themselves are more
diverse," said Gil Masters, a
committee member and Civil
Engineering professor. "And,
through the core, each track
will be exposed to the other."
The environmental specialty
has been incorporated into civil
engineering as a formal track
with several new and restruc
tured courses. Those course
offerings will include water
decontamination, environmen
tal planning and air-quality
management.
"A lot of people with an
interest in the environment
simply don't know what to
major in," said Masters.
"There were so many people
designing their own related
majors already."
The core courses have been
redesigned as well. A new
Introduction to Civil Engineer
ing has been created and the
Legal Context of Civil Engi
neering has been expanded to
include environmental issues.
Requirements outside of
civil engineering itself have
been made more specific. The
21 units of mathematics
required now specifies Math
130 and an emphasis on differ
ential equations. The 20-unit
science requirement now man
dates students to take Physics
51, as before, plus Chemistry
31 and Geology 1.
