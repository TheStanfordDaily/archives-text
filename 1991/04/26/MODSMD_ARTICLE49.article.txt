# Loss of two guaranteed housing spots will hurt Alpha Sig, its residents say
## 
### Brad O'Donnell 
The University has cut the number of house offi
cers in Alpha Sigma from five to three next year,
angering residents who feel that losing the positions
will detract from the house's continuity.
The guaranteed positions for house officers are
remnants of the now-defunct returning-residence
priority, which was abolished two years ago because
many considered it unfair.
When that policy was changed, the Alpha Sigs
and other self-op residents were no longer guaran
teed assignment to the house. But in an attempt to
maintain a sense of community, five students were
exempted and were still allowed to return as house
officers the following year.
However, the Housing Operations Advisory Com
mittee decided earlier this year to cut the number of
returning students to three.
An Alpha Sig resident, sophomore Sandi Smith,
said the program is essential in maintaining the
house traditions. Formerly a fraternity, the Alpha
Sigs opted to admit women in 1973 and became inde
pendent of their national organization ten years
later.
Since the demise of returning residency, the
Housing Center has granted each house three slots,
with the option to petition for more. Alpha Sig has
for the last two years petitioned for, and been
granted, the extra two spots. This year, however, the
petition was denied.
According to Ted Hoagland, RA and four-year
Alpha Sig resident, the house will suffer greatly with
the loss.
"We adamantly feel that we need those positions
in order to keep up the traditions of the house," said
Hoagland. He said the house was not informed of
any policy change.
Jack Chin, acting dean of residential affairs, said
an announcement was made last spring by the com
mittee that a review of the exempted positions in
self-ops, co-ops and theme houses would be con

ducted this winter.
The housing committee's final decision to cut
positions regardless of petitions, came as a shock to
the Alpha Sigs. Hoagland said they weren't
informed of the change in policy until Wednesday.
"Because of a miscommunication, the residents of
Alpha Sigma weren't notified of the decision until
this week," Chin said. "In light of that fact, I've peti
tioned [the committee] to allow the house five posi
tions for next year only."
The house had already elected five officers, and
the two students now left without a guarantee of
placement in Alpha Sig next year said they feel
cheated. Smith, who had planned on being the house
historian and house vice president Andy Schultz
said they both seriously altered their plans for next
year in order to accommodate the Alpha Sigs.
Smith, a sophomore in Political Science, canceled
plans to apply for an overseas study position when
she was elected. The announcement has left her ner
vous and uncertain about next year.
"I think that if the housing administration had
realized the consequences of of reducing the num
ber, they would have recognized their error," said
Smith. "I think maybe their investigation could
have been a bit more in-depth."
But Chin said the committee's investigation was
thorough. "We conducted a comprehensive review of
all the positions and the decision was reached to
limit all self-ops to three [positions] in an effort to
standardize and reduce inequities.
"Alpha Sig may feel strongly about their tradi
tions, but so do other houses with less positions. We
have no objective basis to judge who is more deserv
ing than others."
Chin said the fact that Smith and Schultz weren't
informed until Wednesday is unfortunate, and he's
trying to help them.
Smith and Hoagland said they are grateful, but
emphasized that the house will suffer when the posi
tions are reduced.
