# Voters not impressed by ASSU performance
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Less than 11 percent of the stu
dent body thinks the ASSU is
responsive to its needs, according
to the results from the question
naire at the end of the ballot in
last week's election.
In addition, only 25 percent
reported satisfaction with the
computerized ASSU fee-refund
system.
And more than three-quarters
do not consider themselves active
members of the ASSU.
Many key figures within the
ASSU said the results show that

the ASSU needs to interact better
with students. But some dis
agreed as to the extent of the
problem.
"The ASSU needs to outreach
better to students. It does not take
a rocket scientist to figure that
out," said current COP member
Goodwin Liu, a senior. "But this
does not say that the ASSU has
not affected students. It only says
that the ASSU did not do a good
job of letting students know how
it affected them."
Senators critical of the ASSU
offered similar analysis.
"As a statistician, I would let
the data explain itself. It is a very
good summary of the facts," said
Students First Council of Presi
dents slate member John
Overdeck, a graduate senator who
has criticized the ASSU's respon
siveness to students throughout
this year.
Students First graduate sena
tor Doug Bone said, "The overall
trend of these answers shows that
the ASSU is not being responsive
to the students. It is not doing
what the students expect. . . . The
bottom line is that the ASSU is
not doing its job."
Both Bone and Overdeck noted
that these results reflect only stu
dents who voted.
"This overwhelming dissatis
faction among those who took the
time to vote makes it fairly clear
that the ASSU needs to rethink
what it is doing," Bone said.
Former elections commissioner
Raul Lopez also saw the results as
making a strong statement about
the current state of the ASSU.
"Most people do not believe
they are active members of the
ASSU," said Lopez, a graduate
student.
The dissatisfaction with the
current fee-refund system is due
to the confusion created by
changes made during this transi
tion year, said Assoc. Financial
Manager Mike Risch, a junior.
The results of other questions
also produced fairly negative
results. About 47 percent of the
students said they did not believe
they were aware of how their
ASSU fees were being used.
The results are based on the
number of students who
answered each question. Students
who abstained from answering
the question are not included.
