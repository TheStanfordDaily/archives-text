# Voters not impressed by ASSU performance
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
Less than 11 percent of the stu
dent body thinks the ASSU is
responsive to its needs, according
to the results from the question
naire at the end of the ballot in
last week's election.
In addition, only 25 percent
reported satisfaction with the
computerized ASSU fee-refund
system.
And more than three-quarters
do not consider themselves active
members of the ASSU.
Many key figures within the
ASSU said the results show that

the ASSU needs to interact better
with students. But some dis
agreed as to the extent of the
problem.
"The ASSU needs to outreach
better to students. It does not take
a rocket scientist to figure that
out," said current COP member
Goodwin Liu, a senior. "But this
does not say that the ASSU has
not affected students. It only says
that the ASSU did not do a good
job of letting students know how
it affected them."
Senators critical of the ASSU
offered similar analysis.
