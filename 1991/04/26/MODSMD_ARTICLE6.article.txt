# Freshman twins undaunted by disease
## Cystic fibrosis is 'no big deal' to the Stenzels

"We lock ourselves in our
room to do therapies, but beyond
that, we're totally healthy," says
Isabel Stenzel, waving her dis
tinctively round fingertips in the
air.
Clubbed fingers are the only
immediate physical sign that Isa
has cystic fibrosis, a progressive
genetic disease that affects the
lungs and digestive system. Her
identical twin, Anabel, nods in
agreement. "It's like we keep our
illness indoors."
Isa and Ana are two of the
four students on campus who
have cystic fibrosis, according to
Molly Sandperl, director of the
Disability Resource Center.
The fact that they are able to
"isolate" the evidence of their
disease to their room adds to
what the women see as the great
irony of cystic fibrosis. "It's the
most common genetic disease,
but most people don't know
about it,"says Isa.
Ana feels society is to blame.
"People don't see direct physical
evidence of the disease, so they
don't pay much attention to it,
even though more than 30,000
people in the United States have
cystic fibrosis. But you see Jerry

Lewis and 'his kids' on TV all the
time for muscular dystrophy.
Even though it's a much rarer
genetic disease, it is more physi
cally evident."
Like most freshmen, their
room is cluttered with colorful
paraphernalia. Photo collages,
posters and decorative pink
flamingos splash the walls. A
large poster depicting varieties

of Sushi shows the influence of
their half-Japanese heritage.
However, the scent of the
medication lingers in the air as a
gentle reminder that these are
not ordinary students. Large
medical equipment also eats up
floor space.
Cystic fibrosis demands con
tinual therapy to loosen mucus
in the lungs. "We have to be dili

gent in our therapy during every
minute, or we feel the differ
ence," Isa explains.
The sisters share the guest
room in Larkin so they can assist
each other with therapy. First,
Isa and Ana turn on the radio to
cover the noise before they
breath for thirty minutes into a

Just living. We have to," Ana says.
