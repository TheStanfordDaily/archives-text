# Freshman twins undaunted by disease
## Cystic fibrosis is 'no big deal' to the Stenzels 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
"We lock ourselves in our
room to do therapies, but beyond
that, we're totally healthy," says
Isabel Stenzel, waving her dis
tinctively round fingertips in the
air.
Clubbed fingers are the only
immediate physical sign that Isa
has cystic fibrosis, a progressive
genetic disease that affects the
lungs and digestive system. Her
identical twin, Anabel, nods in
agreement. "It's like we keep our
illness indoors."
Isa and Ana are two of the
four students on campus who
have cystic fibrosis, according to
Molly Sandperl, director of the
Disability Resource Center.
The fact that they are able to
"isolate" the evidence of their
disease to their room adds to
what the women see as the great
irony of cystic fibrosis. "It's the
most common genetic disease,
but most people don't know
about it,"says Isa.
Ana feels society is to blame.
"People don't see direct physical
evidence of the disease, so they
don't pay much attention to it,
even though more than 30,000
people in the United States have
cystic fibrosis. But you see Jerry

Lewis and 'his kids' on TV all the
time for muscular dystrophy.
Even though it's a much rarer
genetic disease, it is more physi
cally evident."
Like most freshmen, their
room is cluttered with colorful
paraphernalia. Photo collages,
posters and decorative pink
flamingos splash the walls. A
large poster depicting varieties

of Sushi shows the influence of
their half-Japanese heritage.
However, the scent of the
medication lingers in the air as a
gentle reminder that these are
not ordinary students. Large
medical equipment also eats up
floor space.
Cystic fibrosis demands con
tinual therapy to loosen mucus
in the lungs. "We have to be dili

gent in our therapy during every
minute, or we feel the differ
ence," Isa explains.

room in Larkin so they can assist

nebulizer, a small, toaster-size
machine to help loosen the secre
tions in their lungs.
Then, Ana lays on her stomach
on top of two pillows propped on
her bed. Using the heel of her
hands, Isabel then pounds with
sharp, staccato movements on her
sister's back, up and down along
both sides of the spinal cord. After
20 minutes, the two girls switch,
and Anabel pounds on Isabel's
back. Afterward, the two use the
nebulizer again.
"I've had experiences in my
past where people pity us or hold
us up as heroes. But we're just liv
ing. We have to," Ana says.
Isa, too, is adamant about
avoiding sympathy or glorifica
tion. "If you've done it all your
life, it's no big deal," she says.
Larkin Resident Fellow Robert
Harvey emphasizes. "They never
seek any advantages for the dis
ability at all. Even when they talk
about cystic fibrosis, they will
never, never do it in a way that
solicits pity," he says.
"We want to be treated as nor
mal people, but we want people to
understand our disease," Isa says
firmly.
Harvey says the women have
accomplished this goal. "The

other students are aware of the
fact that they have cystic fibrosis,
but aren't overly so. They don't
treat the girls differently, or with
inhibitions."
He attributes this positive
atmosphere to the residents' atti
tudes. "Ana and Isa will talk
openly about their disease with
those who are interested. It's not
a 'no-no' subject."
Between classes in the after
noon, Isa and Ana must repeat
the pounding therapy twice, but
because of conflicting schedules
they cannot do it together.
Instead, they use a large machine
with an attached rubber vest, sim
ilar to a life vest, that pumps air
against the body.
It's pointless to turn on the
radio on to block out this sound,
which resembles a vacuum
cleaner and a high-powered hair
dryer combined. The machine
isn't as effective as hand-pound
ing techniques, however. Their
day ends with two full hours of
pounding therapy and more
breathing with the nebulizer.
They approach their daily,
four-hour therapy regime prag
matically. "All in all, there are a lot
of times we complain, 'Why do we
have to do our therapies?' But at
least we're here. Everyone has to
eat and sleep. For us, we have to
eat, sleep and do therapy," Isa
explains.
Upon arrival at Stanford, the

pair faced the usual freshman
crises, but cystic fibrosis height
ened the difficulties of the transi
tion. "When I first arrived at
Stanford," Ana says,"I had this
illusion that I was so healthy that
I could do whatever normal people
do."
Isa protests, "Hut we can. We
lead a pretty normal lifestyle."
Another consequence of cystic
fibrosis that made the transition
difficult was the fact that their
door is often closed during thera
pies, while most freshmen during
their first quarter adhere to the
"open-door policy."
Ana says,"I used to get really
bothered. Some people would say,
'Oh, you're always locked in your
room, why don't you go back?"
But other people are "very
warm and understanding," Isa
adds. Both nod at this.
Like most Stanford students,
Ana and Isa groan about food ser
vice, but the food really does make
them sick. For the first few
months at Stanford, the high fat
content in dorm food caused
stomach problems. They now take
enzymes that are five times
stronger than their old dosage to
combat the problems.
"We lead a normal lifestyle; we
go to classes and join groups like
everyone else," Isa says.
Last weekend, Ana went on an
all-day field trip for a geology

class. "We had to climb up this
cliff. I was breathing really hard
and I felt like everyone was look
ing at me, wondering why 1
couldn't even climb the cliff. No
one in my class knows 1 have cys
tic fibrosis."
In between classes and activi
ties, however, Isa and Ana must
continually make time for therapy
and rest. "If we have something
big planned for the day," Ana
whispers a little guiltily, "We'll
take a nap."
Isa adds, "Sleep is a priority,
but the people who don't know
this think I'm a flake."
Ana and Isa both helped
explain cystic fibrosis for a Larkin
presentation. "I wanted to let peo
ple know why we stay in our room
so much, why we make noise and
why we're not in the regular hall
way with everyone else," says Isa.
She adds that the Disabled
Resource Center has helped her
discern "how the sense of identity
is connected with a disability"
Sharing with other members of
the center is a "good release," she
says.
Moth women look forward to
medical advancements and break
throughs in cystic fibrosis.
"We're learning a lot of new
techniques from the Stanford
Hospital, which is a really hard
core CF clinic. We're lucky," Ana
says.

nebulizer, a small, toaster-size
machine to help loosen the secre
tions in their lungs.
Then, Ana lays on her stomach
on top of two pillows propped on
her bed. Using the heel of her
hands, Isabel then pounds with
sharp, staccato movements on her
sister's back, up and down along
both sides of the spinal cord. After
20 minutes, the two girls switch,
and Anabel pounds on Isabel's
back. Afterward, the two use the
nebulizer again.
"I've had experiences in my
past where people pity us or hold
us up as heroes. But we're just liv
ing. We have to," Ana says.
Isa, too, is adamant about
avoiding sympathy or glorifica
tion. "If you've done it all your
life, it's no big deal," she says.
Larkin Resident Fellow Robert
Harvey emphasizes. "They never
seek any advantages for the dis
ability at all. Even when they talk
about cystic fibrosis, they will
never, never do it in a way that
solicits pity," he says.
"We want to be treated as nor
mal people, but we want people to
understand our disease," Isa says
firmly.
Harvey says the women have
accomplished this goal. "The

other students are aware of the
fact that they have cystic fibrosis,
but aren't overly so. They don't
treat the girls differently, or with
inhibitions."
He attributes this positive
atmosphere to the residents' atti
tudes. "Ana and Isa will talk
openly about their disease with
those who are interested. It's not
a 'no-no' subject."
Between classes in the after
noon, Isa and Ana must repeat
the pounding therapy twice, but
because of conflicting schedules
they cannot do it together.
Instead, they use a large machine
with an attached rubber vest, sim
ilar to a life vest, that pumps air
against the body.
It's pointless to turn on the
radio on to block out this sound,
which resembles a vacuum
cleaner and a high-powered hair
dryer combined. The machine
isn't as effective as hand-pound
ing techniques, however. Their
day ends with two full hours of
pounding therapy and more
breathing with the nebulizer.
They approach their daily,
four-hour therapy regime prag
matically. "All in all, there are a lot
of times we complain, 'Why do we
have to do our therapies?' But at
least we're here. Everyone has to
eat and sleep. For us, we have to
eat, sleep and do therapy," Isa
explains.
Upon arrival at Stanford, the

pair faced the usual freshman
crises, but cystic fibrosis height
ened the difficulties of the transi
tion. "When I first arrived at
Stanford," Ana says,"I had this
illusion that I was so healthy that
I could do whatever normal people
do."
Isa protests, "Hut we can. We
lead a pretty normal lifestyle."
Another consequence of cystic
fibrosis that made the transition
difficult was the fact that their
door is often closed during thera
pies, while most freshmen during
their first quarter adhere to the
"open-door policy."
Ana says,"I used to get really
bothered. Some people would say,
'Oh, you're always locked in your
room, why don't you go back?"
But other people are "very
warm and understanding," Isa
adds. Both nod at this.
Like most Stanford students,
Ana and Isa groan about food ser
vice, but the food really does make
them sick. For the first few
months at Stanford, the high fat
content in dorm food caused
stomach problems. They now take
enzymes that are five times
stronger than their old dosage to
combat the problems.
"We lead a normal lifestyle; we
go to classes and join groups like
everyone else," Isa says.
Last weekend, Ana went on an
all-day field trip for a geology

class. "We had to climb up this
cliff. I was breathing really hard
and I felt like everyone was look
ing at me, wondering why 1
couldn't even climb the cliff. No
one in my class knows 1 have cys
tic fibrosis."
In between classes and activi
ties, however, Isa and Ana must
continually make time for therapy
and rest. "If we have something
big planned for the day," Ana
whispers a little guiltily, "We'll
take a nap."
Isa adds, "Sleep is a priority,
but the people who don't know
this think I'm a flake."
Ana and Isa both helped
explain cystic fibrosis for a Larkin
presentation. "I wanted to let peo
ple know why we stay in our room
so much, why we make noise and
why we're not in the regular hall
way with everyone else," says Isa.
She adds that the Disabled
Resource Center has helped her
discern "how the sense of identity
is connected with a disability"
Sharing with other members of
the center is a "good release," she
says.
Moth women look forward to
medical advancements and break
throughs in cystic fibrosis.
"We're learning a lot of new
techniques from the Stanford
Hospital, which is a really hard
core CF clinic. We're lucky," Ana
says.
"We lock ourselves in our
room to do therapies, but beyond
that, we're totally healthy," says
Isabel Stenzel, waving her dis
tinctively round fingertips in the
air.
Clubbed fingers are the only
immediate physical sign that Isa
has cystic fibrosis, a progressive
genetic disease that affects the
lungs and digestive system. Her
identical twin, Anabel, nods in
agreement. "It's like we keep our
illness indoors."
Isa and Ana are two of the
four students on campus who
have cystic fibrosis, according to
Molly Sandperl, director of the
Disability Resource Center.
The fact that they are able to
"isolate" the evidence of their
disease to their room adds to
what the women see as the great
irony of cystic fibrosis. "It's the
most common genetic disease,
but most people don't know
about it,"says Isa.
Ana feels society is to blame.
"People don't see direct physical
evidence of the disease, so they
don't pay much attention to it,
even though more than 30,000
people in the United States have
cystic fibrosis. But you see Jerry

Lewis and 'his kids' on TV all the
