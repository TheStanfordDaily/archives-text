# ASSU election declared over XTV withdraws from ballot
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The spring general election is finally over, and the
composition of the ASSU Senate remains
unchanged.
And as preparations continued for this week's
runoff election, XTV, citing its refusal to be used as a
"political lever," decided late last week to withdraw
its special-fee request frorp the ballot. â€¢
Elections commissioner Enda Hu said he had not
received any ballots from five overseas campuses and
Stanford in Washington as of 7 p.m. last night, leav
ing all of the vote totals unchanged.
The ASSU Bylaws require the final vote total be
completed four days before the election certification,
which will occur at this Thursday's senate meeting.
Hu said the bylaws prohibited any exceptions to this
rule and said hearings officer Jason Moore and sen
ate chair Solina Kwan confirmed his decision.
Junior Raphe Beck finished two votes in front of
freshman Virginia Rosas in the race for the 10th
undergraduate voting senator position. Rosas will
serve as the top non-voting senator, said Hu, a
sophomore.
Distribution of ballots to off-campus locations had
sparked controversy in last week's senate meeting to
validate the election.
Moore ruled at the beginning of last week that
students at Stanford in Washington who had not
originally been sent ballots should not be allowed to
vote in the general election because the election
results had already been announced. But the senate
overruled his decision and ordered that ballots be
faxed to the campus last Wednesday.
Although Hu confirmed that the ballots were
faxed, no one at Stanford in Washington returned
the ballots by the deadline yesterday. Students at the
Kyoto, Krakow, Paris, Oxford and Salamanca centers
also did not send ballots back, even though they
acknowledged having received ballots on time. The
elections commission also made repeated phone calls
to the center, Hu said.
XTV's decision to withdraw from the runoff elec
tion leaves MEChA as the only special-fee request to
be on the ballot a second time.
The senate had decided to place the special-fee
requests of XTV and MEChA on the runoff ballot for
a second chance at student approval because of "elec
tion irregularities."
Both organizations cited problems with their
information in the election handbook as justification
for placement on the ballot again. MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student organization, also blamed a "no
recommendation" given by The Daily's editorial
board because of miscommunication about sotting
up an interview.
In a statement explaining XTV's reasons for with
drawing from the runoff, station manager Dave Hol
land said XTV deserved to be on the ballot again, but
he was concerned about the politics surrounding the
situation.
"XTV is a non-political organization and takes no
