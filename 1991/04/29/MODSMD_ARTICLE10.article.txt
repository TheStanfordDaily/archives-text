# 'Suspicious' fire breaks out in oven of Deke house kitchen

A fire broke out in the kitchen of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity Friday
morning, just a week and a half after two
beverages in the house were found to be
poisoned.
Stanford Fire Marshal Raymond
Gamma said the 10 a.m. fire was "of sus
picious origin" and that it is unknown
who set it off. Fraternity members would
not talk about the fire yesterday, as they
had decided at a house meeting not to
make any comment.
Peter Huyck, house president, said he
couldn't answer any questions because

"we really don't know anything right
now."
The fire was discovered by two frater
nity residents, Paul Santiago and Ricardo
Cuna, Gamma said. A smoke alarm in the
kitchen went off as well, alerting the fire
department, he said.
Gamma said two 54-ounce containers
of barbecue lighter fluid were put in the
fraternity kitchen's oven. The oven tem
perature was set to its maximum of 550
degrees, he said, and the plastic contain
ers melted, spilling the flammable mate
rial into the oven itself.
He added that a student saw smoke
and opened the oven door. The student
tried to put out the fire with a portable

fire extinguisher but was not successful,
Gamma said.
There were 12 students in the building
when the fire broke out, Gamma said.
At 1 p.m. on Friday Gamma met with
the 30 members of the house, in order "to
go backward and nail them down" on the
exact details of the fire. He said he would
meet with two fraternity members today
to get more information.
The fire follows two other suspicious
incidents at the fraternity in recent
weeks.
Two tainted beverages were found in
the fraternity kitchen on April 16 and 17.
The first was a pot of coffee that had been
filtered through plant fertilizer, and the

second was a container of grape juice that
contained paint thinner, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
If it had entered someone's lungs, the
paint thinner in the grape juice could
have caused serious damage, said Dr.
David Torin, the staff physician at Cowell
Student Health Center who analyzed the
substance.
The kitchen was cordoned off over the
weekend with yellow tape. A notice on a
blackboard warned residents to stay out
of the room until Monday.
Gamma said Tim Frecceri, deputy
sheriff at Stanford Police Department, is
in charge of the investigation. Frecceri
was unavailable for comment yesterday.

Interfraternity Council President Erik
Jorgenson, a senior, said the IPC will con
duct its own internal investigation of the
fire. He said senior Keith Rabois, IFC vice
president, will be conducting the investi
gation for the council.
Jorgenson said the IFC role will be to
assist the fraternity. "It's a tough time for
us [since] Rush is wrapping up this week
end. We will turn our business to (the
Dekes incident] next week," he said.
"We're concerned for the Dekes . . .
and hoping they can [get] back on their
feet again," Jorgenson said.
"They have strong leaders in that
house and a strong core of people," he
added.
