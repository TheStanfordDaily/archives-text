Pilot says he knew downed
KAL plane was commercial
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The Soviet
pilot who shot down a South Korean airliner in
1983, killing all 269 people on board, says he
knew he was firing missiles at a commercial
plane, South Korean television reported yester
day.
The pilot, Gennady Osipovich, had told the
Soviet newspaper Izvestia in January that
Soviet military officials lied about details of the
incident. But the report on Seoul's MBC televi
sion was the first quoting Osipovich as saying
he knew he was firing at a commercial plane.
The account contradicted Moscow's official
stand on the downing of Korean Airlines Flight
007. There was no immediate Soviet reaction to
the report.
On Sept. 1, 1983, the Boeing 747, on a flight
from New York to Seoul, was shot down after
straying into Soviet air space. All 269 people on
board were killed.
The Soviets initially kept silent about the
incident, but then alleged the plane had been
on a spy mission.
Turkey's first lady wins election
ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) - Semra Ozal, the
wife of Turkish President Turgut Ozal, defied
objections from the opposition and the govern
ing Motherland Party and was elected yester
day as head of the Motherland's powerful
Istanbul branch.
Ozal received 351 votes at a convention
while her fundamentalist rival Talat Yilniaz
polled 269.
The success came for Mrs. Ozal on the sec
ond try. The first convention on March 3 broke
up without a ballot amid accusations of fraud.
Ozal's candidacy, and her inability to win the
first time, rocked the government and caused
embarassment to her husband, who put all his
power and prestige behind her.
Striking teachers rally at capitol
OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — About 13,000 strik
ing teachers and their supporters crowded state
Capitol grounds Saturday, renewing their call
for dramatic increases in education funding.
After the rally, Washington Education Asso
ciation president Carla Nuxoll met with House
Speaker Joe King, but emerged from the two
hour meeting saying there was little hope for a
quick solution.
The rally was the second in as many weeks
to draw nearly 13,000 protestors, according to
the Washington State Patrol.
About 20,000 Western Washington teachers
in 32 school districts have been on strike since
April 18 over demands for higher pay, smaller
class sizes, more school construction and sup
plies and better long-term state funding.
