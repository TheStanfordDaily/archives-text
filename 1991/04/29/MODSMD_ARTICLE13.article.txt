WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush urged Americans yes
terday to pray for the victims of
the deadly tornadoes in Kansas
and Oklahoma and promised to
"do whatever we can to help."
Bush paused as he left a church
service to express his sorrow for
the "terrible tragedy" wrought bv
the dozens of tornadoes that
swept across the two states Friday
night.
"I just wanted to say on this
day of worship we were expressing
our prayers for the victims of the
terrible tornadoes, particularly
those around Andover, Kansas,"
said the president after attending
an 8 a.m. communion service at
St. John's Episcopal Church
across from the White House.
Nineteen of the 26 dead in
Kansas were residents of a trailer
park in the suburban Wichita
town of Andover that was levelled
by the fierce storms. Three people
were killed in Oklahoma* as at
least 30 twisters tore through
Kansas and 18 through Okla
homa.
Bush said Sen. Bob Dole, R-

Kan., "called me yesterday about
this awful destruction."
"Perhaps on this Sunday it's a
good time to say a prayer for the
families that have been hurt so
badly by this devastation," he
said.
"We'll do whatever we can to
help. Others are moving very
quickly to help," he said. "But it's
been a terrible tragedy and just an
awful thing for a lot of families in
our country, not just in Kansas,
but elsewhere as well."
Hundreds of homes were
destroyed as at least 30 twisters
ripped across Kansas and 18
through Oklahoma Friday night.
Twenty-six people died in Kansas
and three in Oklahoma. More
than 200 people were injured.
At least 1,500 people were left
homeless. Judy Conners of the
Salvation Army said three shel
ters had been set up and the orga
nization expected to feed 3,000 to
5,000 people Saturday.
The Golden Spur Mobile Home
Park in the suburban Wichita
town of Andover was leveled, and
at least 19 residents died, said

Capt. Stan Cox, of the Butler
County's sheriffs office.
The latest three bodies were
found in the wrecked mobile home
complex Saturday afternoon.
Gov. Joan Finney issued a state
disaster declaration, the first step
in getting federal assistance for
the stricken areas.
"What I saw made me heart
sick," she said after an aerial tour.
"The devastation is more
widespread than I had antici
pated. The suffering must be
intense."
President Bush, contacted at
Camp David in Maryland by Dole,
expressed sympathy for the loss of
life and property. Bush said he
would help as much as he could.
Judy Ingalls, a park resident
who was away when the twister
struck and destroyed her mobile
home, said all her neighbors are
dead.
"They didn't go to the shelter.
They've always rode them out.
We've always rode them out.
We've been here 15 years. They
didn't go. They are taking them
out."
