# Allies expand security zone for refugees

ZAKHO, Iraq (AP) â€” In a change of plans, allied
forces have more than doubled the size of their secu
rity zone for Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq and
are scouting a site for a second settlement, United
States officers said yesterday.
In southern Iraq, meanwhile, the U.S. Army
began an airlift to Saudi Arabia of refugees who fear
reprisals from Iraqi security forces if they remain.
That was seen as a major step toward the U.S.
troops' own departure.
Many Iraqis were displaced by the Shiite Muslim
revolt in the south and the Kurdish uprising in the
north, which broke out after the Gulf war. The
insurgencies failed to dislodge Saddam, who marked
his 54th birthday yesterday.
But renewed clashes were reported between Shi
ites and Iraqi forces near the southern city of Basra.
The fighting caused heavy casualties among gov
ernment forces and at least two personnel carriers
were set ablaze, Iranian radio reported. The broad
cast, monitored in London, also claimed rebels
attacked government intelligence posts in the south
ern cities of Al-Amarah and Karbala, killing some
Iraqi troops.
In the easternmost allied push so far, a company
of British Royal Marines moved into the Iraqi town
of Batufla, about 18 miles east of Zakho, on Saturday
night.
When the British troops arrived, a battalion of
Iraqi Republican Guard left, officers said.
Soon, United States Marines from the 24th
Marine Expeditionary Unit will enter Amadiyah,
about 75 miles east of Zahko, where a second camp is
planned, said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jim Christo-*
phersen, of the 432 nd Civil Affairs Company of
Green Bay, Wis.
"This will effectively double the size of the secu
rity zone," said Christophersen, whose men will
manage both camps until the United Nations and
humanitarian agencies can take over.
Yesterday, the European Community endorsed a
British proposal to send a U.N. police force to Iraq to
help convince the Kurdish refugees it is safe to
return home.
Britain made its proposal at a two-day meeting of
EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg. It received "a
unanimous welcome," said Luxembourg Foreign
Minister Jacques Poos, the meeting's chairman.
Some refugees have begun to complain that Kur
dish resistance fighters, known as Pesh Merga or
"those who face death,stopping refugees who
seek to return to their homes.
A French army doctor, Col. Jean La Roix, said one
group of rebels had set i>p a checkpoint near a
French field hospital and charged passengers a fee to
pass through.
"They're running a racket here," he said.
