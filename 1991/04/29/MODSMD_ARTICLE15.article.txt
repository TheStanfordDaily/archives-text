SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Accords between the gov
ernment and leftist rebels on con
stitutional reforms have provided
such momentum to the peace pro
cess that an end to the 11-year-old
civil war could be imminent.
"My estimation of this round of
talks is very optimistic. It should

lead the way to a successful con
clusion," said Alvaro de Soto, the
usually circumspect U.N. media
tor of the year-old negotiations.
He commented Saturday night
in Mexico City after he and repre
sentatives of the rightist govern
ment of President Alfredo Cris
tiani and the guerrilla army

announced agreements forged
during three weeks of intense
talks in Mexico.
Both the government and the
Farabundo Marti National Libera
tion Front, the rebel army also
known as the FMLN, have
acknowledged in recent months
that a negotiated political solution

is the only way to end the war,
which has killed more than 75,000
people.
Insurgent chiefs say they must
keep up military pressure in com
ing weeks or months to win gov
ernment concessions in future
talks.
But they privately acknowledge
that the armed struggle has ful
filled enough of its objectives that
it would be useless to continue for
long. The rebel leaders say the
contest among ideologies and plat
forms must now become political
rather than military.
The accords, the most signifi
cant in the 12 months of talks,
include constitutional reforms
that would subordinate the
hugely powerful and nearly
autonomous military to elected
civilian authority.
The reforms include the sepa
ration of the police — now a mili
tarized force encompassing com
bat infantry battalions — from
the Defense Ministry, and the
removal of the national intelli
gence agency from military con
trol.
They would also set up mecha
nisms aimed at ensuring the inde
pendence of the judiciary and giv
ing it more of the national budget;
create an office of a public
defender for human rights; and
seek to guarantee the impartiality
of the Supreme Electoral Council.

two sides reached an agreement in nearly month-long peace talks. The accords should help end the
country's 11-year old civil war, which has killed 57,000 people, most of them civilians.
