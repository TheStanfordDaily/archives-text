# FBI says violent crime up 10 percent
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Seven American
cities recorded more than one fourth of all
murders in the United States, the FBI said
yesterday in releasing its annual crime report.
Six of the seven cities had more murders
last year than in 1989. The exception was
Detroit, which had 582 murders, 42 fewer
than the year before.
Overall, violent crime — murder, rape, rob
bery and aggravated assault — jumped 10 per
cent in 1990.
"The growth in violent crimes is larger than
1 would have thought," said Alfred Blumstein,
dean of the School of Urban and Public Affairs
at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Criminologists, however, don't consider the
annual report a reliable indicator of crime
trends because it covers only reported crime.
A more accurate barometer, those experts
say, is the Justice Department's annual survey

of crime victims, which shows the level of vio
lent crime has been fairly stable in the last
decade.
The FBI expressed the national picture only
in percentages. Applying those percentages to
last year's figures, these would be the num
bers nationally in a few categories:
• Violent crime up 10 percent, to about
1,810,000,
• Murder up 10 percent, to 23,600,
• Rape up 9 percent, to 103,000,
• Robbery up 11 percent, to 642,000, and
• Aggravated assault up 10 percent, to
1,050,000.
In non-violent crimes:
• Burglary down 4 percent, to 3,040,000,
• Larceny theft, unchanged at 7,872,000, and
• Motor vehicle theft, up 5 percent to
1,620,000.
Leading the nation in murder is New York

City, with 2,245 in 1990, up from 1,905, an 18
percent increase.
The murder rate in New York City exceeds
six per day.
"It's the availability of drugs and the avail
ability of handguns," said New York City
Deputy Police Chief Michael Markman.
The other six cities with increased murder
rates are:
• Ix)S Angeles, 983, up 12 percent from 877,
• Chicago, 850, up 15 percent from 742,
• Houston, 568, up 24 percent from 459,
• Philadelphia, 503, up 5.9 percent from
475, and
• Washington, D.C., 472, up 8.8 percent
from 434.
Cities with populations ranging from
500,000 to 1 million had large increases in the
violent categories, including a 16 percent rise
in violent crimes.
