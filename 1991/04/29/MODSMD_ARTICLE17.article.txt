CAPE CANAVERAL, Kla.
(AP) â€” The space shuttle Dis
covery thundered into orbit
with seven astronauts yester
day on a "Star Wars" research
mission that promises to be one
of the most complicated flights
in shuttle history.
The spaceship roared from
its seaside launch pad at 7:33
a.m. EOT, climbing through a
fairly clear sky flushed by the
rising sun.
Once Discovery was settled
in its 161-mile-high orbit, shut
tle commander and veteran
spaceman Michael Coats told

Mission Control that "every
thing seems to be going prettv
well.
NASA constders this one of
the most complex shuttle
flights because of all the tricky,
split-second turns required.
Discovery's engine nozzles
must be pointed right at the
spacecraft during the plume
observations.
NASA called off Discovery's
launch Tuesday less than six
hours before liftoff when a sen
sor for one of the main engines
failed. A new sensor was
installed.
