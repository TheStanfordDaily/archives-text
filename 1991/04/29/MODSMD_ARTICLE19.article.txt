BGLAD - BISEXUAL, GAY
and Lesbian Awareness Days
— is a time to express,
explore, celebrate and learn about
what it is to be bisexual, gay or les
bian, at Stanford.
The two weeks of events, from
April 21 to May 4, are for the
homosexual and heterosexual stu
dents alike. This year, the weeks'
events are especially inclusive,
focusing on bisexuality as an
important part of the homosexual
community.
Unfortunately, discrimination
against bisexuals, gays and les
bians is still rampant in American
society. Even on the Stanford cam
pus, many individuals are still
homophobic, and the bisexual, gay
and lesbian community is perhaps
the least accepted minority group
on campus.
While some individuals have
come a long way in their thinking
about issues of race and ethnicity,
many Americans have not yet come
w to terms with homosexuality and
bisexuality as valid alternative
lifestyles.
Misconceptions about homosex
uality, discrimination and even vio
lence against homosexuals still
persist.
Whatever the reasons, the fact
that discrimination continues to
exist against the homosexual com
munity makes events like BGLAD
all the more compelling for stu
dents who want to be informed,
thoughtful members of a society
that will be confronting these
issues in increasing depth in the
19905.
In addition to being a wonderful
program for Stanford's lesbian,

gay and bisexual community,
BGLAD is an opportunity for all
students to learn about some of the
problems that homosexuals face in
contemporary American society.
Coming out, dealing with preju
dice, AIDS and many other issues
will be among the programs that
have relevance to everybody,
regardless of sexual orientation.
Today at 2 p.m., for example, is
the keynote address by June Jor
dan, an African American poet,
writer and peace activist.
Other events include talks about
coming out to parents and siblings,
discussions of the issues raised by
homosexual parenthood and a talk
on "Religion and Spirituality in the
Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Com
munity."
In order to live responsibly,
thoughtfully and compassionately
in today's society, every individual
should try to understand many of
the issues that will be raised
through these events.
The diverse programming will
give students the opportunity to
examine their own perspectives
and feelings on sexual orientation.
Since the awareness weeks include
a variety of activities, students
should make an effort to remained
informed and attend the events.
It seems like this year BGLAD
has been less publicized than
GALA week has been in the past. It
certainly has not been as visible as
other celebrations such as Her
story Week or Black Liberation
Month.
Stanford's multiculturalism of
the past few years has been criti
cized for focusing on ethnic and
racial differences, ignoring the
truly incredible diversity among
individuals' backgrounds and
lifestyle choices.
BGLAD is a valuable opportu
nity for the University and the
Stanford community to broaden its
perspective on diversity.
