MEChA's goals merit a second chance at ASSU fee

The chicano and latino
community has traditionally
played a very active role in the
Stanford community. We have and will
continue to put on programs and events
that we feel contribute to the overall goal
of multiculturalism. However, the pro
gramming that has come from our com
munity has not just been to help others
understand who we are as a people, but,
more importantly, has been our way of
expressing ourselves culturally
MEChA as a social, cultural and polit
ical organization has understood the
need to have institutionalized funding
for programs such as La Gran Posada,
Cinco de Mayo festivities, El Dia los
Muertos and the Ballet Folklorico spring
concert to exist. In order to provide this
institutionalized funding for the commu
nity, the MEChA special fee was estab
lished. For the past two years, the
MEChA special fee has been distributed
to the Chicano and Latino community
through El Centro Chicano, Casa Zapata
and other Chicano and Latino student
organizations.
The results of this year's ASSU elec
tion clearly put these programs in jeop
ardy. Why did this happen?

In our opinion, several factors were
responsible.
First, MEChA did not receive a posi
tive endorsement in The Daily as we
have had the past two years. We were
given a "no recommendation" by the
Daily editorial board because they were
"unable to contact us."
According to The Daily, they made
several attempts but never made contact
with us. We question the editorial
board's sincerity in this matter. Never
before have they had any difficulty find
ing MEChA officers, especially late at
night when they needed quotes for arti
cles attacking us. The editor in chief said
that The Daily is "independent" and
does not have to answer to anyone. We
contend that The Daily should be
responsible in its actions and processes,
given the strong influence it has in shap
ing student and community opinion.
Second, there still exists a growing
resentment and backlash to the goals
and ideals of multiculturalism. This
backlash has affected all of the commu
nities of color and the organizations that
have historically fought for community
empowerment: the Black Student Union,

MEChA, the Asian-American Student
Association and the Stanford American
Indian Organization. It is for this reason
that none of these special fees received
more than 60 percent of the vote this
year, as compared to "less controversial"
organizations such as the Stanford Vol
unteer Network, which received more
than 80 percent. Before 1987, the BSU
received between 65 and 70 percent of
the vote every year, but that changed
when they questioned the Western Cul
ture program. That trend concerns us
deeply and we want to understand it
more.
The fact is that the effect of these
votes is destructive to our communities
and to Stanford as a whole. The debate
that has arisen as a result of struggle to
strive for a more just and equal multicul
tural environment is to be expected;
change is difficult. But, given our chang
ing society, we have a duty and responsi
bility to confront and solve these difficult
issues.
We realize that many people are
"tired" of multiculturalism; we are tired,
too — tired of defending and justifying
our existence as people of color on this

campus. Until three years ago, Stanford
as an institution had not begun to
address these issues; today, we as stu
dents who care about Stanford have the
responsibility to insure that these issues
continue to be addressed.
We call on the ASSU, and in particular
the ASSU Senate, to respond to our com
munity's concerns and needs. We
demand accountability and, if students
truly come first, funding for our pro
grams must be a priority. We thank the
senate for working with MEChA and the
entire Chicano and Latino community to
find creative solutions to our funding
problem by helping take this issue back
to the student body.
In the struggle for justice, dignity and
respect for people of color, our ability to
express ourselves plays a critical role.
Our efforts to bring a better understand
ing of who we are to the Stanford com
munity and to proudly move our commu
nity forward will be severely crippled
without our working together. Thank
you for your support.
