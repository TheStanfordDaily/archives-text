# The
						Tri-Delts should not be punished for doing the right thing
## 
### 
This letter is a plea to the Intersoror
ity Council and the University adminis
trators who are considering taking puni
tive actions against the Tri-Delts for the
incident that occurred at their party on
April 17.
In this incident, a freshman was
taken to the hospital because her soror
ity sisters thought she had consumed so

much alcohol that her health might be in
danger. This was the only sensible move
to make. Sorority President Heather
Strom made a good call when she said
she would rather get the sorority in trou
ble than endanger the health of a pledge.
Punishing the Tri-Delts would deter
students in similar situations from seek
ing medical treatment for friends who
may be in serious danger. It is inevitable
that there will be students who will
drink too much and get out of control.
Our number one concern should be their
immediate health and safety — not their
and others' subsequent punishments.
People brought to the hospital should
have absolute rights of privacy. Students

should have the confidence that they can
go to Cowell Student Health Center or to
the Medical Center and have their prob
lems taken care of in a discreet manner.
It is very possible that students might
reason that taking a peer to the hospital
is not worth the risk. Fearing the conse
quences, they might reason, "Why don't
we just leave him here to recover by him
self? We'll do our best to care for him.
Everything will probably be OK."
In the case of the Tri-Delt pledge, no
medical treatment was actually needed;
the sorority was just being extra careful.
Not every intoxicated student is so lucky
With fraternity bids coming out soon,

pledges will be consuming large quanti
ties of alcohol. It is likely that at least
one will make an error in judgment and
drink too much. Those who are with this
person must be allowed to focus their
concern on the sick student's health —
not on the University or legal problems
that may ensue if treatment is sought.
Be assured that if the Tri-Delts are
punished for following the only proper
course of action, it will influence the
decisions of individuals and organiza
tions in similar situations. The conse
quences could be disastrous.
