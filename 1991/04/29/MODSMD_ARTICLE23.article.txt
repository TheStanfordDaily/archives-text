## More ASSU idiocy 
### 
A S A PIVOTAL FIGURE in the
/\ annual debate among parties, inde
nt. candidates and fee request
groups, the ASSU elections commissioner
commands a lot of responsibility and
withstands a lot of pressure. Throughout
that process, the commissioner is sup
posed to remain neutral and run a
smooth election. It's a tough job that gets
about as much respect as Rodney Danger
field.
While it can't be claimed that this
year's election was a flawless democratic
exercise, Raul Lopez deserves a standing
ovation for his decision to resign before
this week's runoff election. Not wanting
to be party to an undemocratic process,
Lopez stepped down in genuine protest of
the ASSU Senate's decision to add three
ballot measures that lost in the first elec
tion to the runoff ballot.
Considering the ASSU Bylaws provi
sion that the current Council of Presi
dents and senate determine the elections
commissioner's bonus, Lopez's action is
significant.
MEChA supporters argued that "irreg
ularities" in the original election justify
the group's inclusion on the runoff ballot.
The group's arguments, which center
around having received a "no recommen
dation" by The Daily's editorial board,
are as contrived as many of the storylines
in the World Wrestling Federation.
The Daily regularly gives a "neutral"
or "no recommendation" to groups that
do not make the regularly scheduled
interviews, even after the regularly
scheduled phone call to the group's con
tact person. What was irregular was that

the MEChA contact that Lopez provided
to The Daily never listened to his answer
ing machine messages.
The omission of MEChA's full state
ment and XTV's budget in the election
handbook clearly did not affect enough
votes to swing the election, given that
only about 10 students invested the time
to figure out the handbook's disorganiza
tion. Furthermore, all candidates had an
opportunity to proof the election hand
book before the final version went to
press.
Using the "irregularity" argument, all
losing fee requests should be put back on
the ballot since it is "irregular" that a fee
request gets voted down.
The second consecutive year of manip
ulated election results is only part of a
pattern of continued distortion of ASSU
rules and the democratic process by the
People's Platform-controlled senate.
Since the ASSU only comes under heavy
press scrutiny during election time, many
of its other abuses go unreported:
• Although other institutions' chairs
vote only to break a tie, the People's Plat
form senate chairs prefer a rule allowing
the chair to vote when the vote is "deci
sive." Given the Platform's current 13-to
-7 advantage in the senate, the senate
chair has voted several times this year to
get a "decisive" two-thirds majority;
• The two-thirds majority used its
power to extend ballot submission dead
lines for this year's election, allowing Peo
ple's Platform groups more time to
assemble requisite election materials; and
• Wanting to avoid a controversial vote
when some of their senators are missing,

People's Platform senators have been
known to use their "Exodus Leadership
Approach," leaving the meeting en masse
so there is no longer a quorum.
These types of actions, and the result
ing inaction, have resulted in less than 11
percent of voting students saying the
ASSU has been responsive to their needs.
Current COP members respond that the
students just don't know enough about
the ASSU. Obviously, if the ASSU were
doing something for them, the students
would have heard about it by now.
Fortunately for students, the ASSU's
inactivity is not an inherent problem.
Three years ago, Leonard Adler's slate,
"Energizers," did more in two months of
office than any slate since. Instead of
expending their time "building a Stanford
family," the "Energizers" focused on con
crete initiatives for the student body: get
ting change and condom machines for
dorms, making food-service modifica
tions, hosting an all-campus party after
Orientation, preserving Stanford Sta
dium alcohol privileges, reviving the
ASSU Course Guide, etc.
Unfortunately for the People's Plat
form, when you're so busy trying to fig
ure out how to stay in power, it's tough to
do things that will keep you in power.

Tim Marklein is a senior political science
major who hopes people use the "Exodus
Voting Approach " this week.
