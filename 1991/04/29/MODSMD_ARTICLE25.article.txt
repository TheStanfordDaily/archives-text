# From The Editor
## Janine DeFao The 						Daily is independent of the ASSU and the election process 
### 
Following several assu elec
tion controversies, I have been
asked many questions concerning
The Daily's policy and process for inter
viewing special fee request candidates. I
have met with representatives of the com
munities of color and appeared before the
ASSU Senate, but I believe some people
still do not know how the Daily editorial
board made its endorsements this year.
Like editorial boards of most newspa
pers, the Daily editorial board offers its
views on candidates and other ballot ini
tiatives before the local election each year.
We include endorsements of special fee
requests because it is important for stu
dents to know not only who their elected
officials are, but also how student money
is being spent.
Before the editorial board discusses
any endorsements, we first meet with
Council of Presidents slates to discuss
their platforms and with representatives
of student groups — 29 this year — to
examine their activities and budgets. We
believe the interview process is important
because it gives groups a chance to
respond to our questions and concerns.
At the time the opinions editors were
planning to schedule interviews, the
ASSU election handbook had not yet been
published. One of the editors met with

elections commissioner Raul Lopez and
compiled a list of the groups requesting
fees and the names of their contact people.
Two editors had the task of setting up
the interviews. When they left messages
and groups did not respond, they called
back at least twice.
In the case of MEChA, which blames
The Daily in part for losing its fee
request, opinions editors received a con
tact name from Lopez which MEChA
claims was incorrect. The editors
attempted to contact him several times.
Because The Daily received no
response from the group, MEChA leaders
say the editors should have contacted a
member of the MEChA officer core. In
retrospect, this would have been a good
idea. But it is logistically impossible to
expect that those scheduling the inter
views could track down representatives
from many of the student groups if their
contact people are improperly listed.
I would recommend that, in the future,
The Daily advertise that interviews with
the editorial board are available, rather
than rely on the ASSU's sometimes
incorrect information. This approach
would help inform student groups of the
process as well as put some of the burden
on them.
If MEChA officers believed The Daily

had not contacted them and were con
cerned about it, they certainly could have
contacted The Daily. It is hard to believe
they did not realize endorsements would
be published, both because they are
printed every year and especially since
one of the co-chairs served on the edito
rial board last spring.
Regardless of these details, however,
calling a "no recommendation" from the
editorial board an "election irregularity"
is ludicrous. The actions of The Daily
should not be be considered a part of the
election process because it is an indepen
dent newspaper, not an arm of the ASSU.
Being independent does not mean,
though, that we are not accountable to
our community, as some have alleged.
Being independent means that no one
outside The Daily can decide what we
should print. It means neither the ASSU
nor the University can place restrictions
on what we do or how we do it.
(Some have asserted that The Daily is
really not independent because it receives
student funding itself. But that funding
does not jeopardize the paper's indepen
dence because it is collected in lieu of a
subscription fee, which some college
newspapers charge. The University pays
a bulk subscription rate as well.)
Being accountable, on the other hand,

means that we are responsible to our
readers for what we print — that it is fair
and accurate.
Giving the groups we did not interview
"no recommendation" was the most
responsible action we could have taken
under the circumstances. We did not want
to make a decision for or against a group's
fee without all the facts in front of us.
Anyone who has studied budgets
before, especially those prepared by many
student groups, knows it is nearly impos
sible to understand every line item.
Before endorsing a fee request, the edito
rial board tries to determine not just if a
group performs services that benefit the
community, but also if that group is using
its funds well. We believe it would have
been unfair, both to students and student
groups, to make those determinations
without an interview.
"No recommendation" could hardly be
perceived as a "no" vote, since there was
clearly a "no" circle that could have been
filled in for each group. The explanation
for not endorsing certain groups was
printed with the endorsements.
MEChA's citing a lack of positive rec
ommendation from The Daily as reason
to be placed back on the ballot is ridicu
lous. Had the editorial board interviewed
group representatives, it might have

given the fee request a negative endorse
ment.
Contrary to recent popular belief, the
editorial board does not rubber-stamp all
requests and has negatively endorsed sev
eral in the past. This year, many fee
requests were hotly debated. Rarely did
one pass unanimously, but the endorse
ments, like all editorials, are determined
by a majority vote of the editorial board.
And with the exception of MEChA, all
groups which the editorial board did not
interview and endorse received their fee
requests.
Lastly, I would like to make clear the
distinction between the Daily editorial
board and"The Daily," over which there
seems to be some confusion. The editorial
board consists of six Daily editors, a staff
at-large member and three at-large mem
bers from the community. The at-large
positions are open to all students at the
beginning of each volume.
The opinions expressed in the editorial
box do not represent those of the editor in
chief or of the Daily news department,
whose members do not sit on the board.
Please feel free to call me with any fur
ther questions at The Daily at 723-4632.

Janine DeFao is the editor in chief of The
Daily.
