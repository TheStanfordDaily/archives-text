# Lowering the indirectcost rate will be good for Stanford research
## 
### 
The indirect-cost issue has been much
in the limelight lately. I would like to
state my view of the matter as a faculty
member involved in research.
Although the nominal indirect-cost
rate at Stanford has been 70 percent, the

actual administrative costs associated
with research are much greater. The
effective percentage of the federal money
not available to the investigator from an
awarded grant for research is 103 per
cent of the base value.
What does the investigator get in
return for this tax on his or her work?
There are, to be sure, staff benefits that
his or her research personnel receive.
Then there are, of course, the
research facilities — laboratories and

offices and their upkeep. There is also
provision of electricity, water, mainte
nance of some equipment and provision
of secretarial support for departmental
administration.
But everything else must be paid for
from the direct costs. This includes, in
addition to the cost of research itself: the
secretarial needs of the faculty member,
including the purchase of computers;
charges for support staff; rent for tele
phone equipment and all the phone calls

made by the faculty member and his or
her research group; photocopying and
postage; and the cost of applying for new
grants.
Given the above level of support that
the University provides, the 70 percent
indirect-cost rate was excessive. This has
also been the conclusion of the federal
auditors.
It is often suggested that the bottom
line budget figure on a grant — that is,
the direct plus the indirect costs — does

not affect the competitive position of a
grant with a funding agency. I know that
this is not the case at the National Sci
ence Foundation, and I suspect that it is
no more true at other agencies.
As Stanford faculty, our competitive
ness may have therefore been hampered
by the high indirect-cost rate. Thus, I do
not necessarily see the expected decrease
in the indirect-cost rate as a disaster.
