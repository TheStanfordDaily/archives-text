## Netters take Pac-10 crowns O'Brien downs Stark in all-Stanford final 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Forget about the humiliation at
UCLA. You can overlook the loss to
USC. Throw out that defeat by Cal.
Although it was individual, not team
play, the men's tennis team thoroughly
dominated conference competition at
the Pacific 10 tournament last weekend,
nullifying the significance of its previ
ous league losses.
The Cardinal jogged out of Ojai,
Calif., Sunday with the Pac-10 singles
and doubles titles, and a whole lot of
momentum.
While Alex O'Brien, Jonathan Stark
and Jared Palmer walked away with the
first-place honors, it was the entire
squad who came out a winner. With
NCAA Championships sneaking up,
Stanford was more than excited to get in
some great matches and show it can out
gun tough opponents mentally.
"It was a very good performance
overall," asst. coach John Whitlinger
said. "We had some great wins, every
body played a lot of matches and we
came out healthy"
Stanford scored 22 points to earn the
Pac-10 Championship trophy UCLA
was the runner-up with 10 team points,
USC and Cal tied for third with six
apiece, and Arizona State and Arizona
finished fifth and sixth. The Bruins had
finished on top for five of the past six
years.
Stanford dominated play from day
one, winning every one of its first-round
singles matches, taking seven of eight of
its second-rounders and grabbing three
of the four semifinal slots. The Cardinal
also had three players in the quarterfi
nals of the invitational bracket. The
guys in cardinal and white just kept
slugging it out, no matter who the oppo
nent or what the odds.
"This tournament is tough. You have
to be ready to play every match,"
Whitlinger said. "I can't remember a
time in the past five years when we had
so many guys last so long and plav so
well."
With so many Stanford competitors
acing the opposition, of course the
finals were an all-Cardinal affair.
O'Brien, who has played at the No. 1
singles spot for the Cardinal most of the
year, had to face teammate Stark —
who competed at the top last year
before a foot injury.
The match lived up to its billing.
But O'Brien showed why coach Dick
Gould rarely makes mistakes by out

slugging his more well-known team
mate 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.
"I thought it would be tough for Jon
because Alex has been playing very solid
tennis lately. Alex has really been able to
adapt his game to whatever situation he
needs to," Whitlinger said of the
nation's fourth-ranked player. "But it

was a great tourna
ment for Jon. Re
gardless of whether
he won or lost, he's
improving every day,
every match."
Stark didn't
have time to worry
about the defeat.
Bent Ove-Federsen
and Matt Lucena
were awaiting he and
partner Jared Palm
er in the doubles
final.
This time the
real Stark and
Palmer showed up.
After being humili
ated by the Golden
Bear duo two weeks
ago in Berkeley, the
stupendous sopho
mores stayed in this
one. And found the
advantage — 7-5. 6-
4. Second Stanford
title in as many
matches.
"Stark and Palm
er got a lesson at Cal.
This match was
prettv important to

them," Whitluiger said. "I'd like to see
them start a little better but overall I'm
very impressed with the win because
Lucena and f*ooersen are a great team."
There was a Cardinal player in the
invitational bracket finals as well.
Freshman Michael Flanagan showed
he is for real by getting down to the
final two in his first conference meet
before falling 6-3, 6-2 to UCLA's Billy
Barber.
Friday and Saturday were also the
scene of great action. The quarters
were full of tough matchups. And
Cardinal victories. O'Brien out
gunned USC's Donny Isaak 6-3, 6-3,
Stark resoundingly defeated Peder
sen, and Yee whipped fellow Cardinal
Vimal Patel 6-3, 6 -1. Singles semifi
nals were more of the same. O'Brien
downed teammate Yee 6-4, 6-3 and
Stark held off Bruin David Nainkin 7-
5, 3-6, 6-3.
Flanagan and fellow freshman Chris
Cocotos took center court in the second
tier. Flanagan downed Barry Hancock of
Cal 6-4, 6-4 and Cocotos outlasted team
mate Glenn Solomon 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in the
quarters. In the semis, Flanagan had no
trouble with UCLA's Robbie Wendell, 6-
4, 6-1. Cocotos was defeated by Barber
in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 thriller.
In doubles action, O'Brien and Yee
were outgunned by Barber and Nainkin
6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in the quarters, while Stark
and Palmer advanced to the semis by
defeating Arizona's Scott Siperseth and
Doug Livingston, 7-5, 6-2. Isaak and
David Ekerot were the tandem's next
victim. The team from Troy could barely
hold serve, falling 6-1, 6-2.

O'Brien, who has played at the No. 1
singles spot for the Cardinal most of the
year, had to face teammate Stark —
who competed at the top last year
before a foot injury.
The match lived up to its billing.
But O'Brien showed why coach Dick
Gould rarely makes mistakes by out

slugging his more well-known team
mate 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.
"I thought it would be tough for Jon
because Alex has been playing very solid
tennis lately. Alex has really been able to
adapt his game to whatever situation he
needs to," Whitlinger said of the
nation's fourth-ranked player. "But it

was a great tourna
ment for Jon. Re
gardless of whether
he won or lost, he's
improving every day,
every match."
Stark didn't
have time to worry
about the defeat.

Vimal Patel 6-3, 6 -1. Singles semifi

downed teammate Yee 6-4, 6-3 and
Stark held off Bruin David Nainkin 7-
5, 3-6, 6-3.
Flanagan and fellow freshman Chris
Cocotos took center court in the second
tier. Flanagan downed Barry Hancock of
Cal 6-4, 6-4 and Cocotos outlasted team
mate Glenn Solomon 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in the
quarters. In the semis, Flanagan had no
trouble with UCLA's Robbie Wendell, 6-
4, 6-1. Cocotos was defeated by Barber
in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 thriller.
In doubles action, O'Brien and Yee
were outgunned by Barber and Nainkin
6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in the quarters, while Stark
and Palmer advanced to the semis by
defeating Arizona's Scott Siperseth and
Doug Livingston, 7-5, 6-2. Isaak and
David Ekerot were the tandem's next
victim. The team from Troy could barely
hold serve, falling 6-1, 6-2.

Junior Alex O'Brien had a lot to smile about as he captured the conference
crown yesterday in Ojai, Calif. O'Brien bested two fellow Cardinal netters in the
tourney.
Forget about the humiliation at
UCLA. You can overlook the loss to
USC. Throw out that defeat by Cal.
Although it was individual, not team
play, the men's tennis team thoroughly
dominated conference competition at
the Pacific 10 tournament last weekend,
nullifying the significance of its previ
ous league losses.
The Cardinal jogged out of Ojai,
Calif., Sunday with the Pac-10 singles
and doubles titles, and a whole lot of
momentum.
While Alex O'Brien, Jonathan Stark
and Jared Palmer walked away with the
first-place honors, it was the entire
squad who came out a winner. With
NCAA Championships sneaking up,
Stanford was more than excited to get in
some great matches and show it can out
gun tough opponents mentally.
"It was a very good performance
overall," asst. coach John Whitlinger
said. "We had some great wins, every
body played a lot of matches and we
came out healthy"
Stanford scored 22 points to earn the
Pac-10 Championship trophy UCLA
was the runner-up with 10 team points,
USC and Cal tied for third with six
apiece, and Arizona State and Arizona
finished fifth and sixth. The Bruins had
finished on top for five of the past six
years.
Stanford dominated play from day
one, winning every one of its first-round
singles matches, taking seven of eight of
its second-rounders and grabbing three
of the four semifinal slots. The Cardinal
also had three players in the quarterfi
nals of the invitational bracket. The
guys in cardinal and white just kept
slugging it out, no matter who the oppo
nent or what the odds.
"This tournament is tough. You have
to be ready to play every match,"
Whitlinger said. "I can't remember a
time in the past five years when we had
so many guys last so long and plav so
well."
With so many Stanford competitors
acing the opposition, of course the
finals were an all-Cardinal affair.
O'Brien, who has played at the No. 1
singles spot for the Cardinal most of the
year, had to face teammate Stark —
who competed at the top last year
before a foot injury.
The match lived up to its billing.
