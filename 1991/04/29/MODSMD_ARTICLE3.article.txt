# Toxic chemicals found near SLAC

Traces of hazardous chemicals
have been found on a stretch of
land that borders the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, offi
cials there announced last week.
The disclosure of the contami
nation came nearly 11 months
after polychlorinated biphenyls —
a group of hazardous chemicals
better known as PCBs — were
first discovered in soil samples
taken from a 300-foot, brush
filled ditch on land that is leased
to a local horse farm.
Though they have known of
the contamination since last June,
SLAC officials notified public
agencies and the press only last
week. Officials said that while the
chemicals pose no immediate
health risk, they do not know the
source of the contamination.
Plans for cleaning up the chem
icals will be made after an investi
gation, officials said.
A report submitted last
Wednesday to the National
Response Center, an administra
tive arm of the Environmental
Protection Agency in Washington,
D.C., said that on June 1, 1990,
PCBs were discovered "in
unknown quantities from an
unknown cause . . . near Sand Hill
Road." The area of contamination
was not near any buildings.
Retesting by SLAC officials in
January revealed the same level of
contamination on the patch of
land, which is just off SLAC prop
erty. There were no signs that the
toxins had spread.
One University official, who
asked not to be identified, ques
tioned, "Why did SLAC wait so
long to report its findings?"
"We should have filed the

report earlier and reported the
discovery earlier," said Matthew
Allen, associate director of SLAC.
"We failed to do so. It was a proce
dural oversight. As far as we see,
there has been no extensive con
tamination or threat to area popu
lations. But it is a reportable
leak."
"The chance of human health
hazard is small," said Harvey
Chock, a chemical waste manager
for the University. "But small ani
mals that have lived in the area
for a long time could possibly have
been exposed."
SLAC tests found the level of
contamination ranging from 47 to
370 parts per million in soil sam
ples taken from the land on the
southern boundary of the
research facility.
PCB levels over 50 parts per
million warrant clean-up in com
pliance with EPA guidelines.
Allen said SLAC has joined the
Department of Energy, which
funds the facility, in "moving
expeditiously" to conduct addi
tional sampling and assess envi
ronmental impact.
PCBs are part of a broad family
of organic chemicals known as
chlorinated hydrocarbons. The
federal government banned the
manufacture of the chemical after
its toxicity was discovered in
1979, said Lois Grunwald of the
EPA.
Animal research has found
that PCBs increase cancer risk
and pose a threat to reproductive
capabilities. The chemical can
enter the body by eating tainted
foods, by breathing or it can per
meate the skin. Once in the body,
PCBs lodge in the body's fatty tis
sues.
