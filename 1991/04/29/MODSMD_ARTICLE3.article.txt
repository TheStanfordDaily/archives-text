# Toxic chemicals found near SLAC
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Traces of hazardous chemicals
have been found on a stretch of
land that borders the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, offi
cials there announced last week.
The disclosure of the contami
nation came nearly 11 months
after polychlorinated biphenyls —
a group of hazardous chemicals
better known as PCBs — were
first discovered in soil samples
taken from a 300-foot, brush
filled ditch on land that is leased
to a local horse farm.
Though they have known of
the contamination since last June,
SLAC officials notified public
agencies and the press only last
week. Officials said that while the
chemicals pose no immediate
health risk, they do not know the
source of the contamination.
Plans for cleaning up the chem
icals will be made after an investi
gation, officials said.
A report submitted last
Wednesday to the National
Response Center, an administra
tive arm of the Environmental
Protection Agency in Washington,
D.C., said that on June 1, 1990,
PCBs were discovered "in
unknown quantities from an
unknown cause . . . near Sand Hill
Road." The area of contamination
was not near any buildings.
Retesting by SLAC officials in
January revealed the same level of
contamination on the patch of
land, which is just off SLAC prop
erty. There were no signs that the
toxins had spread.
One University official, who
asked not to be identified, ques
tioned, "Why did SLAC wait so
long to report its findings?"
"We should have filed the

report earlier and reported the
discovery earlier," said Matthew
Allen, associate director of SLAC.
"We failed to do so. It was a proce
dural oversight. As far as we see,
there has been no extensive con
tamination or threat to area popu
lations. But it is a reportable
leak."
"The chance of human health
hazard is small," said Harvey
Chock, a chemical waste manager
for the University. "But small ani
mals that have lived in the area
for a long time could possibly have
been exposed."
SLAC tests found the level of
contamination ranging from 47 to
370 parts per million in soil sam
ples taken from the land on the
southern boundary of the
research facility.
PCB levels over 50 parts per
million warrant clean-up in com
pliance with EPA guidelines.
Allen said SLAC has joined the
Department of Energy, which
funds the facility, in "moving
expeditiously" to conduct addi
tional sampling and assess envi
ronmental impact.
PCBs are part of a broad family
of organic chemicals known as
chlorinated hydrocarbons. The
federal government banned the
manufacture of the chemical after
its toxicity was discovered in
1979, said Lois Grunwald of the
EPA.
Animal research has found
that PCBs increase cancer risk
and pose a threat to reproductive
capabilities. The chemical can
enter the body by eating tainted
foods, by breathing or it can per
meate the skin. Once in the body,
PCBs lodge in the body's fatty tis
sues.
Short-term skin exposure to
PCBs causes a skin-rash condition
known as chlora-acne. Environ
mental safety specialists agree
that only prolonged exposure to
the toxins is potentially lethal.
Allen said the definitive source
of the PCBs is unknown. But the
research center has high-power
electrical transformers that could
be a possible source of the con
tamination.
Two decades ago, SLAC
replaced highly flammable oils
used in the transformers to pre
vent electrical breakdown with
were commonly used
as an insulating fluid for electrical
equipment such as SLAC's trans
formers, as well as in hydraulic
and heat-transfer systems built
before 1979.
In some older equipment, like
the transformers, PCBs can still
be used, but regulation of the sub
stance has increased. SLAC has
about a dozen transformers that
use PCBs but is in the process of
phasing them out because of

'Some of the fluid
may have spilled and
then was just hosed
down with water. I
really don't think we
are talking about a
transformer leak.'

potential health hazards, Allen
said.
Preliminary reports suggest
that a leak was not the cause of
the contamination, primarily
because regular monthly inspec
tions on the transformers showed
no signs of leakage, Allen said.
Grunwald said the longevity of
PCBs — they biodegrade slowly —
opens up the possibility that the
initial contamination occurred
"several years ago."
Allen added that the existence
of PCBs may be residual effects of
chemical use during the early his
tory of SLAC. The center was
founded in 1962, when the haz
ardous effects of such chemicals
were unknown.
"Some of the fluid may have
spilled and then was just hosed

down with water. I really don't
think we are talking about a
transformer leak," Allen said.
SLAC officials said their
reports have not found any sign
that the chemical has moved far
ther along the ditch. Nor, they
said, does the contamination pose
a threat to neighboring popula
tions or to water supplies fed from
the ditch's run-off.
However, the Portola Valley
Thoroughbred Center, which has
a lease to the land used for horse
grazing and riding, is watching
the impending investigations with
a skeptical eye.
Wendell Chamber, owner of the
horse farm, said he had heard of
the contamination but would not
comment further pending addi
tional investigations.
Chock said the area of contam
ination is accessible to hikers who
gain access legally from the horse
ranch or trespass onto the prop
erty by illegally climbing a bound
ary fence.
A firm of environmental spe
cialists is being hired to verify the
SLAC's findings on the extent of
the contamination and recom
mend options for decontaminat
ing the soil, Allen said.

PCBs are part of a broad family
of organic chemicals known as
chlorinated hydrocarbons. The
federal government banned the
manufacture of the chemical after
its toxicity was discovered in
1979, said Lois Grunwald of the
EPA.
Animal research has found
that PCBs increase cancer risk
and pose a threat to reproductive
capabilities. The chemical can
enter the body by eating tainted
foods, by breathing or it can per
meate the skin. Once in the body,
PCBs lodge in the body's fatty tis
sues.
Short-term skin exposure to
PCBs causes a skin-rash condition
known as chlora-acne. Environ
mental safety specialists agree
that only prolonged exposure to
the toxins is potentially lethal.
Allen said the definitive source
of the PCBs is unknown. But the
research center has high-power
electrical transformers that could
be a possible source of the con
tamination.

potential health hazards, Allen
said.
Preliminary reports suggest
that a leak was not the cause of
the contamination, primarily
because regular monthly inspec
tions on the transformers showed
no signs of leakage, Allen said.
Grunwald said the longevity of
PCBs — they biodegrade slowly —
opens up the possibility that the
initial contamination occurred
"several years ago."
Allen added that the existence
of PCBs may be residual effects of
chemical use during the early his
tory of SLAC. The center was
founded in 1962, when the haz
ardous effects of such chemicals
were unknown.
"Some of the fluid may have
spilled and then was just hosed

down with water. I really don't
think we are talking about a
transformer leak," Allen said.
SLAC officials said their
reports have not found any sign
that the chemical has moved far
ther along the ditch. Nor, they
said, does the contamination pose
a threat to neighboring popula
tions or to water supplies fed from
the ditch's run-off.
However, the Portola Valley
Thoroughbred Center, which has
a lease to the land used for horse
grazing and riding, is watching
the impending investigations with
a skeptical eye.
Wendell Chamber, owner of the
horse farm, said he had heard of
the contamination but would not
comment further pending addi
tional investigations.
Chock said the area of contam
ination is accessible to hikers who
gain access legally from the horse
ranch or trespass onto the prop
erty by illegally climbing a bound
ary fence.
A firm of environmental spe
cialists is being hired to verify the
SLAC's findings on the extent of
the contamination and recom
mend options for decontaminat
ing the soil, Allen said.
Traces of hazardous chemicals
have been found on a stretch of
land that borders the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, offi
cials there announced last week.
The disclosure of the contami
nation came nearly 11 months
after polychlorinated biphenyls —
a group of hazardous chemicals
better known as PCBs — were
first discovered in soil samples
taken from a 300-foot, brush
filled ditch on land that is leased
to a local horse farm.
Though they have known of
the contamination since last June,
SLAC officials notified public
agencies and the press only last
week. Officials said that while the
chemicals pose no immediate
health risk, they do not know the
source of the contamination.
Plans for cleaning up the chem
icals will be made after an investi
gation, officials said.
A report submitted last
Wednesday to the National
Response Center, an administra
tive arm of the Environmental
Protection Agency in Washington,
D.C., said that on June 1, 1990,
PCBs were discovered "in
unknown quantities from an
unknown cause . . . near Sand Hill
Road." The area of contamination
was not near any buildings.
Retesting by SLAC officials in
January revealed the same level of
contamination on the patch of
land, which is just off SLAC prop
erty. There were no signs that the
toxins had spread.
One University official, who
asked not to be identified, ques
tioned, "Why did SLAC wait so
long to report its findings?"
"We should have filed the

report earlier and reported the
discovery earlier," said Matthew
Allen, associate director of SLAC.
"We failed to do so. It was a proce
dural oversight. As far as we see,
there has been no extensive con
tamination or threat to area popu
lations. But it is a reportable
leak."
"The chance of human health
hazard is small," said Harvey
Chock, a chemical waste manager
for the University. "But small ani
mals that have lived in the area
for a long time could possibly have
been exposed."
SLAC tests found the level of
contamination ranging from 47 to
370 parts per million in soil sam
ples taken from the land on the
southern boundary of the
research facility.
PCB levels over 50 parts per
million warrant clean-up in com
pliance with EPA guidelines.
Allen said SLAC has joined the
Department of Energy, which
funds the facility, in "moving
expeditiously" to conduct addi
