# Birch wins second league title
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It's been easy for Stanford to become
spoiled at the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships. Since the league sanctioned
women's tennis back in 1987, Stanford has
not only been the dominant team in the
Pac-10, the Cardinal has been the best in
the nation.
This year, Stanford has proved itself
somewhat vulnerable — getting killed by
Florida in early March — and conference
foes don't necessarily fear the Cardinal like
they once might have. And yet, despite it
all, including three UCLA players reaching
the semifinals to just one from Stanford,
senior Sandra Birch captured her second
Pac-10 crown yesterday in Ojai, Calif.
The Cardinal Ail-American won this
event back in 1989 and eventually won the
NCAA singles championship, as well. Her
performance over the four-day tournament
left little doubt that she is a threat at
nationals once again.

Birch closed out her successful run with
an easy victory over UCLA's Kim Po, 6-3, 6-
0. The victory avenged two Stanford defeats
since Po had knocked both junior Kylie
Johnson and sophomore Heather Willens
out of the draw in earlier matches.
By the law of averages, Birch was a
somewhat improbable winner. With the
Bruins monopolizing the semis, the tourna
ment resembled the previous two. In '89
and '90, Stanford had three of the final four
and wound up with an individual titlist.
But what the Cardinal lacked in quan
tity, it made up in quality. Birch, who has
been playing exceptionally well of late,
defeated Krista Amend 6-2, 6-1 Friday in
her quarterfinal contest. She was just get
ting warmed up.
At that point, the rest of the Stanford
contingent was sent packing by the gold
and blue. Po's win over Willens was by a 6-
3, 6-4 score. Senior Teri Whitlinger was
upset in a tight three-setter by the Bruins'
Kirsten Dreyer 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
UCLA veteran Stella Sampras
became the fourth semifinalist by
defeating teammate Mamie
Ceniza 6-1, 7-5.

Stanford's doubles hopes were
also dealt a blow Friday by Cal's
Cara Abe and Ellen Walliser. They
eliminated Willens and freshman
Emma Woodhouse 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
But Whitlinger and freshman
Laxmi Poruri took out another
Golden Bear pair, Emilie Viqueira
and Lisa Parks, 6-0, 7-5.
On Saturday, Po showed little

respect for teammate Dreyer, dec
imating her 6-0, 6-0. Birch, mean
while, quietly cruised into the
final with a 6-2, 7-6 win over
Sampras.
But the Bruins, who were
showing little respect for Stan
ford at the tournament, would
still get the Cardinal Saturday.
Ceniza and Iwalani McCalla
ended Whitlinger and Poruri's
run with a 6-3, 6-2 semifinal vic
tory.
Stanford's hopes rested solely
with Birch and she didn't disap
point. All five Pac-10 singles
crowns have gone to Stanford.
In the invitational draw, Wood
house shut out Arizona's Beth
Choate 6-0, 6-0 and slipped by

Walliser 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 to reach yes
terday's final against Cal's Veena
Prabhakar. The outcome of that
match was unavailable.
Sophomore Mario Carruth
reached the invitational semis
with a double-bagel of Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo's Moneca Heron
Friday. Prabhakar beat Carruth
7-6, 6-0.
