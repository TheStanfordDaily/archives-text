# Card nine continues slide with two losses at Arizona
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Comfort can kill.
Stanford and Arizona learned
that basic lesson in baseball phi
losophy this weekend when they
proved that no lead is ever safe.
Comebacks highlighted the three
game series, but unfortunately
the Cardinal came upon the short
end of the stick and managed only
one win in the three-game series.
The loss dropped Stanford to
31-16, 14-9 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division, six
games back of league-leading
USC. Arizona improved to 25-29,
10-17 in the Six-Pac.
Stanford wasted an early lead
to lose Friday's opener 7-3 then
returned the favor Saturday for a
13-7 victory. Yet it was yesterday's
rubber match that left heads spin
ning from the turnaround. Dra
matic is probably the correct way
to term the closing game, but for
Stanford fans, the contest could
only be called brutal.
Leading 10-0 going into the
bottom of the second inning,
Stanford managed to let Arizona

Baseball

Wildcats take two

of three from Cardinal

creep back into the game slowly
and then blow it wide open. The
Wildcats capitalized on a seven
run fifth inning and the absence
of any late-inning Stanford
offense to finally take the game
21-11.
"It is just one of those things,"
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said. "We got 10 runs early, but we
just couldn't stop them."
Everything seemed fine when
starter Willie Adams opened the
game by retiring the side, but
things quickly deteriorated. Ari
zona slowly put runs on the board
over the next few innings and
Adams was finally forced out in
the fourth after giving up seven
hits and five earned runs. Closer
Scott Weiss came into the game to
get the Cardinal out of the fourth,
but in the next frame the roof
caved in.
Weiss opened the inning by
walking Robbie Moen which

proved to be costly when Billy
Owens followed with a booming
homer over the right field fence to
make it 10-7. The hard hitting
continued as Willie Morales dou
bled off the wall. Sensing danger,
pitching coach Tom Dunton went
to the mound for a chat with his
star closer. Whatever he said did
not do much good as Marc Lavoie
beat out the throw for an infield
single and men were on the cor
ners. Weiss walked the next man
and Ron Oelschlager flied out to
score Morales and make it 10-8.
The usually effective curveball
that Wiess emphasizes continued
to misfire and the right-hander
walked Jack Johnson for the third
walk of the inning. The free pass
loaded the bases and set up a
Damon Mashore single into right
that scored two runs to tie the
game. Mashore continued his
attack on the Cardinal as he stole
second and allowed Johnson to
score when Kemper could not
handle the throw from Tallman.
Another single made it 12-10 in
the Wildcats favor and, like the
Cardinal lead, Weiss was gone
quickly.
Brian Sackinsky came in to get

'No matter how well
[your opponent] hits
the ball, you think that
you can win with a 10-
run lead. We just
didn't do much with
the bat after the sec
ond inning.'
— Mark Marquess

Stanford out of the inning.
Though he was the only Cardinal
pitcher who did not give up a run,
the big sophomore was replaced
by Aaron Dorlarque, who was
replaced by Steve Worrell and
then Jeff Light. Together the staff
allowed 17 earned runs and eight
walks — five by Worrell to go
along with the amount of runs
that crossed the plate during his
eighth-inning stint.
Though the Cardinal found
itself lacking in pitching, Stanford
hitting was not exactly stellar

after the first two innings. The
Cardinal scored 10 runs on 15
hits, but after the first couple
innings managed only one run.
"No matter how well [your
opponent] hits the ball, you think
that you can win with a 10-run
lead," Marquess said. "We just
didn't do much with the bat after
the second inning."
Saturday's game treated the
Cardinal much better. Trailing 6-
4 going into the seventh inning,
Stanford rallied for seven runs
and took the game 13-7. The
inning was highlighted by Jef
ferry Hammonds' 12th home run
of the year, but the real offensive
punch of the day came from David
Cornell. Put into left field in a
move that sent Ryan Turner to
the designated-hitter spot, Cor
nell led Stanford by going 3-for-5
with three triples and three RBI.
"David Cornell has really
helped us," Marquess said. "He
has proven to be a spark for us
and I'm very pleased with him. He
has been exceptional."
In yet another case of the
comeback, Stanford lost a 2-1 lead
after four innings in the opener

when the Wildcats went crazy for
first. Ten singles over the next
two ininngs helped Arizona score
three runs in each frame and
eventually take the game. Starter
John Reid took the loss to go 5-4
on the year.

bottom of the second inning,
Stanford managed to let Arizona

Baseball

Wildcats take two

of three from Cardinal

creep back into the game slowly
and then blow it wide open. The
Wildcats capitalized on a seven
run fifth inning and the absence
of any late-inning Stanford
offense to finally take the game
21-11.
"It is just one of those things,"
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
said. "We got 10 runs early, but we
just couldn't stop them."
Everything seemed fine when
starter Willie Adams opened the
game by retiring the side, but
things quickly deteriorated. Ari
zona slowly put runs on the board
over the next few innings and
Adams was finally forced out in
the fourth after giving up seven
hits and five earned runs. Closer
Scott Weiss came into the game to
get the Cardinal out of the fourth,
but in the next frame the roof
caved in.
Weiss opened the inning by
walking Robbie Moen which

proved to be costly when Billy
Owens followed with a booming
homer over the right field fence to
make it 10-7. The hard hitting
continued as Willie Morales dou
bled off the wall. Sensing danger,
pitching coach Tom Dunton went
to the mound for a chat with his
star closer. Whatever he said did
not do much good as Marc Lavoie
beat out the throw for an infield
single and men were on the cor
ners. Weiss walked the next man
and Ron Oelschlager flied out to
score Morales and make it 10-8.
The usually effective curveball
that Wiess emphasizes continued
to misfire and the right-hander
walked Jack Johnson for the third
walk of the inning. The free pass
loaded the bases and set up a
Damon Mashore single into right
that scored two runs to tie the
game. Mashore continued his
attack on the Cardinal as he stole
second and allowed Johnson to
score when Kemper could not
handle the throw from Tallman.
Another single made it 12-10 in
the Wildcats favor and, like the
Cardinal lead, Weiss was gone
quickly.

'No matter how well
[your opponent] hits
the ball, you think that
you can win with a 10-
run lead. We just
didn't do much with
the bat after the sec
ond inning.'
— Mark Marquess

Stanford out of the inning.
Though he was the only Cardinal
pitcher who did not give up a run,
the big sophomore was replaced
by Aaron Dorlarque, who was
replaced by Steve Worrell and
then Jeff Light. Together the staff
allowed 17 earned runs and eight
walks — five by Worrell to go
along with the amount of runs
that crossed the plate during his
eighth-inning stint.
Though the Cardinal found
itself lacking in pitching, Stanford
hitting was not exactly stellar

after the first two innings. The
Cardinal scored 10 runs on 15
hits, but after the first couple
innings managed only one run.
"No matter how well [your
opponent] hits the ball, you think
that you can win with a 10-run
lead," Marquess said. "We just
didn't do much with the bat after
the second inning."
Saturday's game treated the
Cardinal much better. Trailing 6-
4 going into the seventh inning,
Stanford rallied for seven runs
and took the game 13-7. The
inning was highlighted by Jef
ferry Hammonds' 12th home run
of the year, but the real offensive
punch of the day came from David
Cornell. Put into left field in a
move that sent Ryan Turner to
the designated-hitter spot, Cor
nell led Stanford by going 3-for-5
with three triples and three RBI.
"David Cornell has really
helped us," Marquess said. "He
has proven to be a spark for us
and I'm very pleased with him. He
has been exceptional."
In yet another case of the
comeback, Stanford lost a 2-1 lead
after four innings in the opener

when the Wildcats went crazy for
first. Ten singles over the next
two ininngs helped Arizona score
three runs in each frame and
eventually take the game. Starter
John Reid took the loss to go 5-4
on the year.

Stanford and Arizona learned
that basic lesson in baseball phi
losophy this weekend when they
proved that no lead is ever safe.
Comebacks highlighted the three
game series, but unfortunately
the Cardinal came upon the short
end of the stick and managed only
one win in the three-game series.
The loss dropped Stanford to
31-16, 14-9 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division, six
games back of league-leading
USC. Arizona improved to 25-29,
10-17 in the Six-Pac.
Stanford wasted an early lead
to lose Friday's opener 7-3 then
returned the favor Saturday for a
13-7 victory. Yet it was yesterday's
rubber match that left heads spin
ning from the turnaround. Dra
matic is probably the correct way
to term the closing game, but for
Stanford fans, the contest could
only be called brutal.
