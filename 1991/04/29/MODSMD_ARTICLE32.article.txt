# Women beat up Bears; men fall
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
In Big Meet 1991, the numbers speak
for themselves.
Saturday, five meet records, a sta
dium record and four Stanford school
records were set. One athlete automati
cally qualified for the NCAA Champi
onships and three others had provi
sional marks. The Cardinal women won,
98-47. The men lost, 99-64.
No matter what record was being set
at the time, Stanford's Jackie Edwards
was likely playing a part in it. She had
three victories and two second-place fin
ishes.
She opened the competition with a 21
foot, 2J4-inch long jump, which elicited
an impromptu rendition of "All Right
Now" by teammates Chryste Gaines
and Rhonda Oliver.
The leap set a stadium record and
broke the decade-old school record. With
that jump Edwards qualified for the
NCAA Championships.
Fighting for second place in the
event, and setting the tone for the rest
of the meet, were Stanford's Alysia
Hubbard and Cal's Roslyn Mitchell. On
her last jump, Mitchell passed Hubbard
but the Cardinal senior returned the
favor.
Next for Hubbard and Edwards was
the 4xloo-meter relay. Edwards
exploded out of the blocks on the lead
leg. Rhonda Oliver took the handoff and
nearly made up the stagger before Hub
bard took the baton for the third leg.
Hubbard and Cal's Josalyn Mack
were neck and neck entering the final
turn. With Chryste Gaines running
anchor, the Cardinal squad won the
race. Gaines crossed the line in a time of
45.32 seconds. New meet record. New

school record.
Gaines and Edwards faced each other
in the 100 meters. Edwards conceded, "I
kind of figured Chryste would win." The
Pacific 10 Conference Champion was
victorious with a time of 11.61. Gaines
made the NCAA provisional mark while
running against a 2.2-meter headwind.
Edwards placed second.
Next for Edwards was the triple
jump. Edwards has said she believes
she's not even close to her potential in
this event. Saturday, she came a little
closer with a lifetime best 41 foot, 10Mi
inch leap, another school record. Is this
starting to sound like a broken record?
Edwards and her teammates domi
nance in the jumps was critical to the
Cardinal meet victory. Asst. coach Betsy
Riccardi attributes the stellar perfor
mances, in part, to effective training
techniques.
"Our whole thing was getting people
fast, sprinting them in practice and then
resting them so their legs come back and
they have a lot of pop in their legs.
[Head coach Brooks Johnson 1 is very,
very good at training people and then
backing off so that they have time to
recover," she said.
To close out the afternoon, Edwards
was runner-up to Gaines in the 200.
Edwards scored 21 of the team's points.
"All we have to do is put Jackie in. She'll
beat them," joked Hubbard.
Edwards was surprised by the quality
of her later performances. "I was very
pleased with the triple and 200," she

said. "When I saw the scratch sheet (for
the 200) there were several Cal and
Stanford people with better times than 1
had."
The rest of the women's contingent
was crushing Berkeley as well. Peggy
Odita led a Cardinal sweep of the high
jump. Odita also placed second in the
javelin and set a school record in the 100
hurdles.
Rhonda Oliver won the 400. Melanie
Bloch and Susan Helfter went 1-2 in the
1,500 and reversed those finishes in the
800. Stanford won the mile relay with
Helfter making up a sizeable deficit and
giving anchor Dana Weeks a 15-meter
lead.
The Cardinal men also won the mile
relay. Unlike last year, however, the
meet wasn't decided by this race. '1 he
Cal squad proved too strong in the
sprints, hurdles and field events.
Stanford came out of the gate fast
with a sweep of the 3,000 meter
steeplechase. James Kostohryz won the
javelin with a monster throw of almost
200 feet. Nick Rosen finshed second.
Marcus Hickerson leaped a personal
best 26 feet, !4-inch in the long jump but
was passed by Chris Muffins' meet
record 26 foot, leap.
"Marcus did a hell of a job in the long
jump. When you're setting (personal
records] and getting beat you can't com
plain," said asst. coach Scott Chisam.
Stanford made a run at Cal in the dis
tance events. Dave Strang and Alex
Accetta went 1-3 in the 800. Mark
Mastalir set a meet record while win
ning the 1,500. The Cardinal swept the
5,000.
To have a chance to win, Chisam
thought the team would have had to
sweep the 800 and 1,500. Cal runners
finished second in both races.

sprints, hurdles and field events.
Stanford came out of the gate fast
with a sweep of the 3,000 meter
steeplechase. James Kostohryz won the
javelin with a monster throw of almost
200 feet. Nick Rosen finshed second.

records] and getting beat you can't com
plain," said asst. coach Scott Chisam.

Peggy Odita's second-place finish in the javelin was just a small part of her busy day
Saturday. Odita also led a Stanford sweep of the high jump and set a school record in
the 100-meter hurdles as the Cardinal women crushed Cal 98-47.
In Big Meet 1991, the numbers speak
for themselves.
Saturday, five meet records, a sta
dium record and four Stanford school
records were set. One athlete automati
cally qualified for the NCAA Champi
onships and three others had provi
sional marks. The Cardinal women won,
98-47. The men lost, 99-64.
No matter what record was being set
at the time, Stanford's Jackie Edwards
was likely playing a part in it. She had
three victories and two second-place fin
ishes.
She opened the competition with a 21
foot, 2J4-inch long jump, which elicited
an impromptu rendition of "All Right
Now" by teammates Chryste Gaines
and Rhonda Oliver.
The leap set a stadium record and
broke the decade-old school record. With
that jump Edwards qualified for the
NCAA Championships.
Fighting for second place in the
event, and setting the tone for the rest
of the meet, were Stanford's Alysia
Hubbard and Cal's Roslyn Mitchell. On
her last jump, Mitchell passed Hubbard
but the Cardinal senior returned the
favor.
Next for Hubbard and Edwards was
the 4xloo-meter relay. Edwards
exploded out of the blocks on the lead
leg. Rhonda Oliver took the handoff and
nearly made up the stagger before Hub
bard took the baton for the third leg.
Hubbard and Cal's Josalyn Mack
were neck and neck entering the final
turn. With Chryste Gaines running
anchor, the Cardinal squad won the
race. Gaines crossed the line in a time of
45.32 seconds. New meet record. New

school record.
Gaines and Edwards faced each other
in the 100 meters. Edwards conceded, "I
kind of figured Chryste would win." The
Pacific 10 Conference Champion was
victorious with a time of 11.61. Gaines
made the NCAA provisional mark while
running against a 2.2-meter headwind.
Edwards placed second.
Next for Edwards was the triple
jump. Edwards has said she believes
she's not even close to her potential in
this event. Saturday, she came a little
closer with a lifetime best 41 foot, 10Mi
inch leap, another school record. Is this
starting to sound like a broken record?
Edwards and her teammates domi
nance in the jumps was critical to the
Cardinal meet victory. Asst. coach Betsy
Riccardi attributes the stellar perfor
mances, in part, to effective training
techniques.
"Our whole thing was getting people
fast, sprinting them in practice and then
resting them so their legs come back and
they have a lot of pop in their legs.
[Head coach Brooks Johnson 1 is very,
very good at training people and then
backing off so that they have time to
recover," she said.
To close out the afternoon, Edwards
was runner-up to Gaines in the 200.
Edwards scored 21 of the team's points.
"All we have to do is put Jackie in. She'll
beat them," joked Hubbard.
Edwards was surprised by the quality
of her later performances. "I was very
pleased with the triple and 200," she

said. "When I saw the scratch sheet (for
the 200) there were several Cal and
Stanford people with better times than 1
had."
The rest of the women's contingent
was crushing Berkeley as well. Peggy
Odita led a Cardinal sweep of the high
jump. Odita also placed second in the
javelin and set a school record in the 100
hurdles.
Rhonda Oliver won the 400. Melanie
Bloch and Susan Helfter went 1-2 in the
1,500 and reversed those finishes in the
800. Stanford won the mile relay with
Helfter making up a sizeable deficit and
giving anchor Dana Weeks a 15-meter
lead.
The Cardinal men also won the mile
relay. Unlike last year, however, the
meet wasn't decided by this race. '1 he
