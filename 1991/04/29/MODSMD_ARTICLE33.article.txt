# Crews bested by California
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Although the overall outlook
for the men's and women's crew
teams is good, this weekend's
race against Cal was not all
smooth sailing.
The women's varsity eight
man and four-man boats lost by
six seconds but both novice
boats won by several lengths.
On the men's side, the novice
four-man boat was the only Car
dinal winner.
At the Oakland Estuary Sat
urday morning, the women had
to make do without their stroke,
Carrie MacKay, who had come
down with mononucleosis two
days earlier. The stroke is very
important because she sets the
rhythm for the boat.
"We've lost some of our
power. Carrie is strong, she has
long strokes," said senior Emily
Dirksen. "Overall, though, I
think we handled it well. We

rowed hard and did our best."
Despite the loss, the women
were pleased with their perfor
mance. "We didn't let Cal beat
us," Dirksen said. "We tried to
stay with them for as long as we
could but we just got tired at the
end."
The women will focus on
speed and strategy over the next
three weeks as they prepare for
the Pacific 10 Confernce Cham
pionships. With MacKay out for
the season, the coaches will
experiment with new combina
tions before facing Cal again at
Pac-lOs.
"We have a couple weeks to
work with it. Somewhere we've
just got to find seven more sec
onds," Dirksen said. The varsity
times have been steadily
improving though so the Cardi
nal women should be at the
front of the pack by the time
they go to Pac-lOs.
The men are in a similar situ
ation. Despite losing most of

their races to the Bears, the
men have been shaving seconds
with every competition. All the
Stanford boats gained five sec
onds from their previous
encounter with Cal at the San
Diego Crew Classic.
"We were looking to beat
them," said senior Greg Fluet.
"We're as fast as they are, but
we just didn't row the race we
should have."
The varsity four-man boat
had a tough race against three
Cal boats. They raced well,
according to Fluet, but finished
in a close third place. If the men
continue to accelerate the way
they have all season, they
should be in prime position at
Pac-lOs.
"It is kind of a battle to catch
Cal through the season," Fluet
said. "They start earlier than we
do and try to max earlier. At this
point, all the signs say if we keep
up our pace, we'll beat 'em at
Pac-lOs."
