## Cevaer wins wintry tourney at BYU, team finishes third 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Victory has tantalized him.
Three weeks ago, he led the
field of the Etonic Southwest
Intercollegiate for two rounds —
and finished fifth.
Last week in the U.S. Intercol
legiate he trailed the leader by just
four strokes entering the final
round — and he finished sixth.
And this weekend it was the
weather.
Leading the pack at the
Brigham Young Cougar Classic
after 36 holes of golf Friday, snow
caked the course and threatened
to call the tournament then and
there — with junior Christian
Cevaer as champion.
"It looked like it was going to
be only a 36-hole tournament and
I would have won it," said Cevaer.
But that was not the case. After a
six-hour snow delay, the 13-team
field resumed play at two o'clock
in the afternoon.
"I had to go out and forget

about having won the tourna
ment," Cevaer said. "It was a mat
ter of responding to pressure; I
had to have another solid round
under par."
Playing beside his challenger,
Ryan Rhees of BYU, Cevaer
birdied the 14th and 15th holes
knowing that Rhees was dead
even with him. He followed the
two birdies with three straight
pars to put an end to his string of
almost titles.
"I didn't look at Rhees' score
because I just wanted to play my
game as well as I could," said
Cevaer. Finishing five under par
with a 211, he claimed the Cougar
crown by one stroke over Rhees
for his first individual victory
since he shocked observers by tak
ing the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship as a freshman.
Despite Cevaer's antics in
Provo, Utah, host BYU trounced
the Cardinal men's golf team by
34 strokes with a 1,075 in the two
day affair. And the Cardinal fal
tered in its bid to beat Texas-El

Paso in two successive tourna
ments. Stanford settled for third
place two strokes behind UTEP at
1,109.
"I don't really mind the third
place finish," said Cardinal coach
Wally Goodwin. "We were really
consistent and we hung right in
there." The Cardinal shot 367 on
the first 18 holes and 371 in each
of the remaining two rounds.
"Golf coaches need to look at
consistency," Goodwin said. "Golf
isn't like basketball where you can
substitute if someone isn't playing
well. It's nice to see five or six
guys come through and get their
acts together."
Under the circumstances of
intermittent snowfall followed by
rain and wind, the Cardinal knew
BYU was going to run away with
the tourney because of the home
course advantage.
"It was snowing so hard you
couldn't see the ball," Goodwin
said. "I told the guys that it was
probably the only time in their
lives that they would play in
something like that and to just go
out and enjoy it."
Cevaer, a native of Cannes,
France, responded best to the
inclement conditions because he
has experienced bizarre weather
conditions while playing in Scot
land with the French national
team.
"I looked at a tee and I couldn't
see anything," Cevaer said. "But I
told myself that I could still par or
birdie — it was determination."
Freshman Notah Begay
rebounded from some rusty per
formances of late to stroke a 74,
75 and 75 for a Cardinal second
best of 224. "Notah's short game

is so great that he can have an off
day with his irons and still play
well," Goodwin said. "He's blessed
with a short-game ability."
Sophomores Dave Rutkowski
and Brad Lanning shot 226 and
227, respectively, while freshman
Casey Martin rounded out the
Cardinal top five with 228. Martin
was in the hunt behind Cevaer
with his first round of 73, but the
last 18 holes on Friday just simply
wore him out as he shot an 82.
Sixth man Edwin Lee, who was
making his collegiate debut, came
through with a 75 to pull the Car
dinal out of a snow hole.
"We were a little disappointed
finishing third," Martin said.
"But we have home-course advan
tage for the Pac-lOs. Hopefully we
can put it together." The Cardinal
hosts the Pac-10 Championships
Friday through Sunday.
