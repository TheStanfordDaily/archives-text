# Christian knows snow
## Cevaer wins wintry tourney at BYU, team finishes third

Victory has tantalized him.
Three weeks ago, he led the
field of the Etonic Southwest
Intercollegiate for two rounds —
and finished fifth.
Last week in the U.S. Intercol
legiate he trailed the leader by just
four strokes entering the final
round — and he finished sixth.
And this weekend it was the
weather.
Leading the pack at the
Brigham Young Cougar Classic
after 36 holes of golf Friday, snow
caked the course and threatened
to call the tournament then and
there — with junior Christian
Cevaer as champion.
"It looked like it was going to
be only a 36-hole tournament and
I would have won it," said Cevaer.
But that was not the case. After a
six-hour snow delay, the 13-team
field resumed play at two o'clock
in the afternoon.
"I had to go out and forget

about having won the tourna
ment," Cevaer said. "It was a mat
ter of responding to pressure; I
had to have another solid round
under par."
Playing beside his challenger,
Ryan Rhees of BYU, Cevaer
birdied the 14th and 15th holes
knowing that Rhees was dead
even with him. He followed the
two birdies with three straight
pars to put an end to his string of
almost titles.
"I didn't look at Rhees' score
because I just wanted to play my
game as well as I could," said
Cevaer. Finishing five under par
with a 211, he claimed the Cougar
crown by one stroke over Rhees
for his first individual victory
since he shocked observers by tak
ing the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship as a freshman.
Despite Cevaer's antics in
Provo, Utah, host BYU trounced
the Cardinal men's golf team by
34 strokes with a 1,075 in the two
day affair. And the Cardinal fal
tered in its bid to beat Texas-El

Paso in two successive tourna
ments. Stanford settled for third
place two strokes behind UTEP at
1,109.
"I don't really mind the third
place finish," said Cardinal coach
Wally Goodwin. "We were really
consistent and we hung right in
there." The Cardinal shot 367 on
the first 18 holes and 371 in each
of the remaining two rounds.
"Golf coaches need to look at
consistency," Goodwin said. "Golf
isn't like basketball where you can
substitute if someone isn't playing
well. It's nice to see five or six
guys come through and get their
acts together."
Under the circumstances of
intermittent snowfall followed by
rain and wind, the Cardinal knew
BYU was going to run away with
the tourney because of the home
course advantage.
"It was snowing so hard you
couldn't see the ball," Goodwin
said. "I told the guys that it was
