# High ropes reign as spring practice draws to a close
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
"If we don't make a bowl next year,
we'll be really disappointed."
That was linebacker Dave Garnett of
the Cardinal football team, version 1991.
And, having just finished their spring
training period on Saturday, that's the
attitude of the entire team.
And they're not alone. A lot of people
are predicting that Stanford's 1991 team
will be top 20. A bowl of some sort is
expected. A major bowl (read "R-O-S-E")
is not out of the question.
Skeptics might question such lofty
expectations, citing the team's 3-8 and 5-
6 records the past two seasons. But even
skeptics would concede the Cardinal has
improved under coach Denny Green, who
is heading into his third season.
Those who would have us believe that
the Cardinal will be a-bowlin' next
December or January cite a number of
reasons, not the least of which is Green's
coaching skills. On the field, Stanford
returns the nation's most efficient passer
at quarterback — Jason Palumbis.
Lining up behind Palumbis will be run
ning back Glyn Milburn, who led the
nation in total offensive yards last year.
Milburn, who will be a junior, is already
being touted as a Heisman Trophy candi
date.
Blocking for both the thrower and the
runner will be Outland Trophy finalist
and All-America candidate Bob Whitfield
at offensive tackle.
These three stars will help make Stan
ford's offense lethal through the air or on
the ground. But they are not the whole
story.
"Other teams might have a few star

players that our better than us at certain
positions, but we won't face any team
next year whose offense is better than
ours as a whole," said Garnett, who qual
ifies as an expert because he faces the
Cardinal's high-powered attack everyday
in practice. By "any team next year," he
was referring to, among others, Washing
ton, Colorado, Notre Dame, UCLA, USC
and California.
Garnett is one of the bright spots in
the area that is the big question for Stan
ford: defense. Particularly with regard to
the secondary, it is expected to be the
team's Achilles' heel. However, Green has
been scrambling to shore up this area
since last season, and if Saturday's Cardi
nal and White scrimmage was any indica
tion, he has been successful.
The Cardinal and White scrimmage is
the game at the end of spring practice in
which the offense takes on the defense.
Points are scored based on how many first
downs the offense achieves or is denied,
touchdowns, interceptions, forced fum
bles, etc. This year the offense, wearing
Cardinal, emerged the victor with a con
troversial last-second score, 27-26.
The fact that the offense barely
squeaked by is great news to Stanford
fans, however. The allegedly weak defense
picked off three passes and snagged a
fumble recovery.
Garnett, citing the defense's youth,
was both optimistic and cautious about
the performance. "We looked good at
times, but we made some pretty glaring
mistakes."
He paused and added, "But you have to
consider the strength of our offense, as
well."
Green has bolstered the defense by
converting several offensive players to

the other side of the line. "When we
recruit players, we hope they can help us
somewhere," he said. "They're all ath
letes. We haven't hesitated to make
moves."
He noted two such converted players
who had a good day. "Tommy [Knecht]
and Vaughan [Bryant] were both
recruited for defense as much as offense

by a number of schools. When you have
some individuals like that, you're better
off. And a whole team like that — that's
even better."
In addition to the "new" defensive
players, several recruits are expected to
help out next year. But Garnett said that
one of the most encouraging indications
that the defense will improve is that it

must face the offense in practice.
"Our defense gets a lot from our
offense," he said. "No one runs as many
formations as our offense. We've got one
of the biggest — if not the biggest —
offensive lines in the country, and that
helps our defensive linemen. And we've
got great running backs."


Chris Walsh, wearing number 80, and the Cardinal-clad offense, narrowly bested the White, 27-26, as spring practice ended
Saturday. Stanford is looking toward a bowl game in the '91 season, which kicks off Sept. 7 against Washington at Stanford
Stadium.
