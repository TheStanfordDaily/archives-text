# Business students dive into charity event

Six contestants wearing business suits and
carrying briefcases jump into a swimming pool
and race to the opposite side. There, they hop
out and disrobe, handing their clothing and
case to a screaming teammate, who then
plunges back into the pool.
This competition, the Investment Banker's
Relay, was one of the highlighted events in the
eighth annual MBA Challenge for Charity,
held at Stanford this weekend.
Business students from six West Coast
schools took part in the charity event, and the
more than 1,000 participants spent the week
end competing against each other to raise
money for the Special Olympics.
This year's Challenge for Charity raised
more than $150,000 â€” $20,000 more than last
year's. The money will be distributed among

Special Olympics chapters near each of the
participating schools.
The newly established Special Olympics
organization in Hungary will also receive a
$20,000 donation. The money will allow the
Hungarian team to compete in this year's
International Special Olympic Games in Min
neapolis.
The largest event was a SK/10K race yester
day morning. Almost 1,500 people, including
runners from around the Bay Area, paid to
enter the race. Several local Special Olympians
also competed.
The teams from Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
UCLA, USC, UC-Irvine, and the University of
Washington were given points for their ath
letic successes and for the amount of money
they had raised during the past year. UCLA
easily won both categories, capturing the
event's briefcase trophy for the third year in a
row.

The MBA Challenge for Charity was started
by Stanford business students in 1984, and
the Stanford Graduate School of Business has
organized and hosted the event since then.
The event has grown bigger each year.
It started as an informal competition
between Stanford and UC-Berkeley which
raised $3,000. This year's event whs so large
that it required hundreds of uniformed volun
teers armed with walkie-talkies and comput
ers to keep everything organized.
According to its coordinators, the purpose
of the event is to increase the interest of busi
ness school students in public-service work.
"Beyond the obvious fund-raising side, the
Challenge heightens the volunteer spirit at all
the business school campuses. It builds a lot of
skills for life beyond school, for giving back to
the community," said Challenge for Charity
director Laura Zinni.
