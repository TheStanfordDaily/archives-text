# Diploma may change to emphasize major
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Stanford graduates in 1992
may receive a somewhat different
looking diploma from those of the
last 100 years.
The proposed changes, subject
to approval by the Faculty Senate
Steering Committee, will include
more prominent placement of the
student's major, elimination of

the department chair's signature
and relocation of distinctions and
honors.
Jack Farrell, acting registrar
and member of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment, which is suggesting the
changes, said the alterations were
proposed "largely in response to
some well-founded complaints."
"People would look at the
diploma and say, 'Where's my

mÂ£yor?'" he said.
The only mention of the stu
dent's mqjor on the current diploma
is with the signature of the depart
ment chair in the lower left corner.
"Looking at the diploma, one
had to surmise that was the
major," Farrell said.
The proposed changes would
place the degree and major in
equally large type in the center of
the diploma, with the areas of spe-

cialization directly below in
smaller type.
The committee is also suggest
ing placing honors and distinc
tions beneath the last four lines of
text on the diploma and above the
signatures.
The only signatures would be
those of the University president,
the president of the Board of
Trustees and the academic dean of
the appropriate school.
