# Report may prompt raise for H&S lecturers
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences plans to try to raise
lecturers' salaries and grant them
some professorial privileges in
response to a recent task force report.
But in a meeting last week of more
than 25 Humanities and Sciences lee

turers, some voiced concern over the
University's commitment to imple
menting the task force' recommenda
tions, which were released last month.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas said the school is set
ting a goal of raising the base salary for
lecturers with salaries currently under
$30,000 by $5,000 over the next three
years. His plans call for salaries of lec

turers in this bracket to be increased
by $1,600 next year, he said.
He added that he has also set a goal
that entering lecturer salaries start at
80-85 percent of the salary of entering
assistant professors, which is cur
rently $34,500.
But Values, Technology, Science and
Society Lecturer Patricia Nabti, a
member of the task force who was at

the meeting, noted Thomas' use of the
term "goal," which she said indicates
support for changes but not necessar
ily implementation of all of the task
force recommendations.
"He warned us not to push too hard
while telling us if we don't push we
won't get anywhere," she said.
During the meeting, some lec
turers also said they fear the Uni
versity would pressure professors
to teach more sections in order to
reduce the need for lecturers.
Others pointed out that lectur
ers in language departments have
a more difficult time than other
lecturers in keeping teaching
quality high while combating
larger minimum class sizes.
The task force recommenda
tions target both lecturers as a
whole and Humanities and Sci
ences lecturers in particular. One
specific proposal calls for "signifi
cantly improving" the salaries of
all lecturers within the school.
The task force was formed by
Provost James Rosse last spring
in response to a petition signed by
more than 80 lecturers who
demanded that their voices be
heard bv University policy mak
ers.
The task force also recom
mended renaming the status of
lecturers from "academic staff"
to a term that does not include

the word "staff" and extending
them library privileges that pro
fessors enjoy, such as immunity
from overdue book fines.
Certain academic opportuni
ties now available only to profes
sors, such as appointment to cer
tain fellowships and grants,
should be opened to lecturers, the
report suggests.
Additionally, the report says
that each of the schools of the
University should appoint a liai
son to work with lecturers and
that lecturers should have access
to Escondido Village housing,
Faculty Club membership and the
golf course "commensurate with
their role and length of service."
Recommendations specific to
Humanities and Sciences lectur
ers include pay raises, paid leave
and funds for professional travel.
In addition, the report pro
poses that Humanities and Sci
ence lecturers be allowed to
advise undergraduates in
research projects and receive
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities major-grant stipends.
Neither option is currently avail
able to them.
The report also calls for office
space and equipment for Human

ities and Science lecturers and
suggests that overcrowding of lec
turer-led sections be avoided.
Nabti and another task force
member, Beverly McChesney,
senior lecturer in linguistics, were
present at the meeting. Other
members of the task force
included Assoc. Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. John Eaton, Asst.
Provost for Faculty Affairs
Kathryn Gillam, English Prof.
Nancy Packer and Business Prof.
John Roberts.
The University's financial sta
tus was taken into account during
the task force proceedings, Nabti
said. "I realized this is about the
worst time to ask for a raise at
Stanford," she added, "but at the
same time we are the most in
need."
Nabti said some of the condi
tions that brought about the task
force were addressed in the rec
ommendations.
"VVe have to moonlight just to
get by," she said, and added that
many lecturers must rely on
spousal subsidies in order to
"manage." She said she would
earn considerably more as a high
school teacher in Palo Alto than
she does as a Stanford lecturer.
