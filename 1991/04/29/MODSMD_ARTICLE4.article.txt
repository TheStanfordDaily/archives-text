# Report may prompt raise for H&S lecturers
## 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
The dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences plans to try to raise
lecturers' salaries and grant them
some professorial privileges in
response to a recent task force report.
But in a meeting last week of more
than 25 Humanities and Sciences lee

turers, some voiced concern over the
University's commitment to imple
menting the task force' recommenda
tions, which were released last month.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Ewart Thomas said the school is set
ting a goal of raising the base salary for
lecturers with salaries currently under
$30,000 by $5,000 over the next three
years. His plans call for salaries of lec

turers in this bracket to be increased
by $1,600 next year, he said.
He added that he has also set a goal
that entering lecturer salaries start at
80-85 percent of the salary of entering
assistant professors, which is cur
rently $34,500.
But Values, Technology, Science and
Society Lecturer Patricia Nabti, a
member of the task force who was at

the meeting, noted Thomas' use of the
term "goal," which she said indicates
support for changes but not necessar
ily implementation of all of the task
force recommendations.
"He warned us not to push too hard
while telling us if we don't push we
won't get anywhere," she said.
