# Students help repair buildings
## 'Christmas in April' volunteers renovate area homes 
### Kim McCreery 
While many Stanford students spent a relaxing
Saturday basking in the spring sun, a few dedicated
volunteers took up their shovels and paint brushes
and went to work.
About 50 students joined more than 1,000 area
volunteers in renovating and repairing almost three
dozen homes and community centers in Menlo Park,
East Palo Alto, Mountain View and Redwood City.
The effort was part of "Christmas in April," an
annual building-restoration project involving more
than 1,500 organizations nationwide. The mid-
Peninsula division, sponsored by the Junior League
of Palo Alto, also helped celebrate Bay Area Youth
Service Day and National Youth Service Day.
About 18 students spent the day scraping and
painting Hoover Elementary School in Redwood
City. The rest of the team started at the Menlo Park
Boys' and Girls' Club — painting, weeding, mowing
and spreading turf for a playground area. They fin
ished the day working at private homes.
Junior Erin Al-Amin worked eight hours — first
at the club and later painting and landscaping at an
elderly woman's home in Menlo Park. "The transi
tion is incredible," she said. "You can actually see the
difference from what is done in one day. This project
is really something where you can see that two hands

can contribute to a much bigger thing."
Despite a few aches and pains, Al-Amin said all
her friends who helped in the project felt it was well
worth the time they spent.
"I'm real sore today," she said yesterday. "Every
one's really tired and sleepy, but no one has com
plained one bit about it."
The Stanford team was coordinated by the Haas
Public Service Center and funded by campus dormi
tories and fraternities.
Victoria Deise, the volunteer coordinator at Haas,
said the Stanford group's efforts are limited by lack
of funds, not a lack of volunteers.
The lack of funding often limits the number of
spaces for unskilled volunteers, she said.
"There is always space for skilled workers who are
willing to donate their expertise," said Deise.
"According to the needs of the project, there might
be lots of work for unskilled workers, but without
the funding for supplies, they can end up costing the
program money."
Last year, when Haas did not solicit funds from
campus groups, nearly half of Stanford's 120 volun
teers couldn't do much to help.
"We've just not put our time and energy toward
raising money," Deise said. "That's something that,
if a student would initiate it, we would totally sup
port it. As a staff member, I would suggest it, but 1
can't take it on myself."
