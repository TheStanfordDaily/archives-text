# Whitney Brown with the 'Big Picture'
## Commentator discusses where Stanford fits in 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
After years of presenting his
"Big Picture" commentary on
Saturday Night Live's "Weekend
Update," A. Whitney Brown has
released his first book, in which
he satirizes subjects ranging
from Saddam Hussein to pro-lif
ers to USA Today.
On Friday afternoon, he
spent three hours signing books
at the Stanford Bookstore, and
he spoke in front of an audience
of about 100 Friday night at
Kepler's Bookstore in Menlo
Park.
Brown began to devote his
time to political comedy after
watching an episode of "The
Tonight Show" in 1980, he said
in an interview with The Daily.
"It was right after the Russians
had invaded Afghanistan. And
for the punch line of the routine,
Johnny Carson dropped his
pants, and 'Russia sucks' was
written on his underwear. I was
embarrassed for my country. 1
figured somebody ought to do
something a little better than
that."
Ironically, Brown got his big

break after appearing on "The
Tonight Show." After seeing his
stand-up routine, "Saturday
Night Live" producer Lome
Michaels and writer A 1 Franken
asked him to join their show as a
writer.
Since joining the staff five

years ago, he has contributed to
many skits, including "The
Pathological Liar." He said he
currently spends most of the
week writing, which is done "in
pairs, trios, as a group . . . every
possible way you can imagine."
He added that he has no interest

in acting, preferring to play the
role of writer and "occasional
monologist."
Brown left his home state of
Michigan at the age of 14 and
never returned to high school.

"Saturday Night Live" commentator A. Whitney Brown signs his first book, "The Big Picture," at
Kepler's Friday night. Brown also appeared at the Stanford Bookstore Friday afternoon.
Since then, however, he has spent
much of his time reading a wide
selection of literature, particu
larly biographical histories, as
well as The New York Times and
The Washington Post.
By attacking political issues he
hopes only to get people to respect
each others point of view. "You
hear this a lot — that the media
has got people brainwashed. That
shows a complete disrespect for
people's opinions.

"People don't have an opinion
because the media has brain
washed them. That implies that
you're the only one who really
understands. And that's bullshit;
people come to the opinion that
they come to because that's the
opinion they've come to. Both the
right and the left claim that any
one who differs from them must
be unduly influenced. That just
isn't true," he said.
For example, Brown said he
thinks multiculturalism is "a big
waste of time. They have this idea
that there's the white man's cul
ture and the black man's culture,
and that's just not true.

"I'll tell you why people take
black history: because they know
it's an easy class; you know it as
well as I do, so let's just say it. No
one is keeping anyone from learn
ing about their culture."
After being on campus for his
Friday book-signing and learning
about Stanford's theme houses,
Brown said, "Really? Do you have
enough American Indians to fill
up a house?" He added, "The
argument that learning the his
tory of their people will give them
self-esteem — I've never seen any
evidence to support that. I think a
person gets their self-esteem from
their family. If you don't have

self-esteem by the time you get
into college, it's too late."
When told of the controversy
surrounding Stuart Reges, a
senior computer science lecturer
who has been placed on leave by
the University, Brown asked,
"How did he get caught?"
Upon learning that Reges had
sent a letter to national drug czar
Bob Martinez, he laughed, "Oh,
man, what a fool. ... I'd be the
last one to advocate drugs to any
one. People are going to do it
whether you tell them to or not,
so I think the last thing we need
to do is encourage people to do
drugs."
