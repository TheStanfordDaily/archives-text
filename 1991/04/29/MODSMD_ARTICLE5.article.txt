# Whitney Brown with the 'Big Picture'
## Commentator discusses where Stanford fits in 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
After years of presenting his
"Big Picture" commentary on
Saturday Night Live's "Weekend
Update," A. Whitney Brown has
released his first book, in which
he satirizes subjects ranging
from Saddam Hussein to pro-lif
ers to USA Today.
On Friday afternoon, he
spent three hours signing books
at the Stanford Bookstore, and
he spoke in front of an audience
of about 100 Friday night at
Kepler's Bookstore in Menlo
Park.
Brown began to devote his
time to political comedy after
watching an episode of "The
Tonight Show" in 1980, he said
in an interview with The Daily.
"It was right after the Russians
had invaded Afghanistan. And
for the punch line of the routine,
Johnny Carson dropped his
pants, and 'Russia sucks' was
written on his underwear. I was
embarrassed for my country. 1
figured somebody ought to do
something a little better than
that."
Ironically, Brown got his big

break after appearing on "The
Tonight Show." After seeing his
stand-up routine, "Saturday
Night Live" producer Lome
Michaels and writer A 1 Franken
asked him to join their show as a
writer.
Since joining the staff five

years ago, he has contributed to
many skits, including "The
Pathological Liar." He said he
currently spends most of the
week writing, which is done "in
pairs, trios, as a group . . . every
possible way you can imagine."
He added that he has no interest

in acting, preferring to play the
role of writer and "occasional
monologist."
Brown left his home state of
Michigan at the age of 14 and
never returned to high school.
