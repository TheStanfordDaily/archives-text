each category won awards.
The six winners from graduate
schools will be announced later
this week. Two will be selected
from each ASSU voting district â€”

large-class category ar*> Herant

The voting was conducted
before Reges made headlines last
week when he was placed on paid
administrative leave for allegedly
violating the University drug pol

ASSU senators Dan Levi and
Ryan O'Hara, who created the
teaching award this year, said it
represents "something tangible
that will last for many years."
