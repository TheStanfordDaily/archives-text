## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The recipients of the ASSU
undergraduate teaching awards,
selected by students during the
spring election, were announced
yesterday.
Winners in the large-class cate
gory are Gilbert Masters, civil
engineering; Paul Wender, chem
istry; Brad Osgood, mathematics
and William Durham, anthropol
ogy
In the small-class group, the
recipients of the award are Jody
Maxmin, art; Dan Avnon, human
ities and sciences; Ronald Delph,
history and Sylvia Wynter, Span
ish and Portuguese.
Students were able to vote for
one teacher from a class with
more than 30 students and one
from a class with fewer than 30
students in the ASSU general
election. The top four teachers in
each category won awards.
The six winners from graduate
schools will be announced later
this week. Two will be selected
from each ASSU voting district —
engineering, humanities and sci
ences and business, law and
medicine.
The four runners-up for the
large-class category ar*> Herant
Katchadourian, psychology;
Robert Sapolsky, biology; Stuart
Reges, computer science; and
Barry Katz, Values, Technology,

Science and Society.
The voting was conducted
before Reges made headlines last
week when he was placed on paid
administrative leave for allegedly
violating the University drug pol
icy.
ASSU senators Dan Levi and
Ryan O'Hara, who created the
teaching award this year, said it
represents "something tangible
that will last for many years."
The recipients of the award will
receive plagues of recognition and
a congratulatory advertisement in
The Daily.
"I believe that this represents
one of the most substantial
accomplishments that a teacher
could obtain," said Levi, a junior.
"Before this award people
always said teachers with big
classes would always win teaching
awards selected by the students.
But these categories made every
thing work" fantastically, he
added.
"There are so few awards and

they are all selected by faculty,"
said O'Hara, a senior. "This one is
done only by the students —
democracy in action."
Levi also said some people have
criticized the "grade-factor" in
student-selected teaching awards,
as teachers who are hard graders
will often not receive awards. But
Delph is known as "D-minus
Delph" and is "one of the hardest
graders" in the University, Levi
said.
O'Hara said the award will be
continued in future years as the
standardized computer ballot
already contains the format for
the questions.
