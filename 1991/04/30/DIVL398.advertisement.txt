American Express
Announces A Great New
Travel Program.
Now students can get the Card
and get 3 roundtrips on Continental
Airlines, for only 5129 or $189 each.
There's only one way to cover a lot of territory without spending
a lot of money. And that's by getting the American Express® Card.
It's the only card that offers an exciting new travel program
exclusively for students—including three roundtrip certificates on
Continental Airlines.
Just look at the map and pick the place you'd like
to visit. If it's on your side of the Mississippi River, you
can use a certificate to fly for only $129 roundtrip. Or,
you can cross the Mississippi for $189 roundtrip.
You have your pick of more than ISO cities in the
I l>» >. IP.IUi
«> II
rt*#t
-48 contiguous states. And you can fly almost anytime because
there are no blackout dates. But you must make your reservations
within 14 days of the day you leave. And the maximum stay is
7 days/6 nights and must include a Saturday night
In addition to this great travel program, you'll also enjoy all
the benefits of Card membership as well as other exclusive student
privileges. They include a quarterly magazine filled with informa
tive articles on summer jobs, careers, campus life. Plus valuable
discounts from leading retailers.
But remember, there's only one way to get all this-and that's
by getting the American Express Card. Just call us (have your bank
address and account number on hand). What's more,
with our special student offer, it's easier to get the
Card now while you're still in school than it may
ever be again.
So get the Card And get ready to cover new
territory on either side of our Great Continental Divide
