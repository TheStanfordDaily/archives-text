URGENT PROBLEM?
COWELL CAN SAVE YOU MONEY!
From January 1, 1991, to March 22, 1991, 164 visits to
the Stanford Emergency Room were made by Stanford
students.
Since the fall of 1989, such visits have not been
covered bv Cowell, and insurance will often pay only
after the deductible has been satisfied ($2OO for
Stanford's plan) and only up to 80% of the total (again,
Stanford's plan).
Of these 164 visits, 55 were made during the hours of
11pm to Bam, during the hours when Cowell is closed.
The remaining 109 visits were during the hours when
Cowell was open:
■ 34 visited the ER during the 9-5 hours Cowell is
open for regular care
■ 75 visited during the time of after-hours Urgent
Care (5-1 lpm weekdays, 7am-llpm weekends),
when:
—nurses are at Cowell
—a doctor is available to be called in when
necessary.
■ Many of the ER diagnoses were problems easily
handled at Cowell: sprains, urinary infections,
bruises, abrasions, lacerations, conjunctivitis, viral
infections, etc.
Cowell can handle many of the problems for
which students have sought emergency room care,
and at no charge to the student.
Save money without compromising quality of care —
