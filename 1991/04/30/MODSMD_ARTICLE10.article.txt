# Sexuality in Zionism analyzed
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
The only connection most peo
ple can make between Zionism
and eroticism is some kind of dis
jointed fantasy about Golda Meir.
Prof. David Biale of UC-Berke
ley, however, addressed an audi
ence of about 100 people — 15
percent with full facial hair — for
over an hour last night in History
Corner on the topic of "Zionism as
an Erotic Revolution."
The speech served as the
keynote address for an ongoing
conference titled "People of the
Body/People of the Book." It was
sponsored by Stanford's Program
in Jewish Studies and UC-Berke
ley's Department of Near Eastern
Studies.
Biale spoke for over an hour on
the sexusd trials and tribulations
of the founders of a Jewish home
land, particularly about experi
ences in communal living on kib
butzim. Sounding somewhat like
a thesis paper by Woody Allen,
Biale's speech ranged from such
topics as sexual anxiety, breast
fetishes, Oedipal complexes and

wife-swapping to nudity and
"menage a quatre."
The Zionists, said Biale, were
adolescents with a "youthful Niet
zschean enthusiasm" who had not
reached a "mature sexuality."
They were searching for a virile,
pioneering spirit to break with the
cerebral, urban, pre-Zionistic
Judaism, he added.
The pioneers, convinced that
only a return to Sampson's ideal
of virility would allow them to
restore the "Promised Land,"
wrote in their philosophic writ
ings that "Only an eroticized
Zionism will restore felicity to the
impotent Jews."
Biale quoted a variety of
sources, including many Zionist
thinkers from the 1940s as well as
Nietzsche and Foucault. He used
these thinkers to outline Utopian
philosophies that greatly influ
enced the Zionists as they created
their plan to renovate Palestine
into Israel.
He also spoke about the prob
lems such idealistic concepts of
sexuality created on the kib
butzim. Foreshadowing much of
what was to occur in the free-love

movement of the '60s, the Zionists
faced many bouts of jealousy as
they experimented with open sex
uality.
Biale briefly addressed the
topic of homosexuality in Jewish
culture, the history of which has
been hidden by the community
until recent years. Although Biale
has researched the history of the
Kibbutz extensively and read sev
eral prominent gay Zionist writ
ers, he said he finds it difficult to
construct an accurate genealogy
of same-sex activity in the Zionist
community, although he acknowl
edges its existence.
Senior David Leit, a religious
studies mtyor who is attending the
entire conference, said, "When I
was in Israel I noticed a different
sense of their bodies and sexuality.
Everyone walks around with their
shirts undone up to their navel;
it's a really free atmosphere.
There's not that much of an
American Puritan attitude left
over. It's something that I didn't
expect to see from Jews."
The conference, which began
last night, continues today at UC-
Berkeley.
