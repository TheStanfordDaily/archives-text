## New elections head 'shocked' by sudden promotion 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
New elections commissioner
Enda Hu said it was "quite a
shock" to find out he would be
handling this week's runoff elec
tion because of former commis
sioner Raul Lopez' resignation.
But Hu, a sophomore, added
that he feels confident about his
ability to handle the new responsi
bilities.
He said he was in his room
studying last Tuesday night when
Lopez, a graduate student, called
and said he had resigned. Hu, the
former associate elections com
missioner, then took charge of
planning for Thursday and Fri
day's runoff.
"All of a sudden, I was over
whelmed by the responsibilities,"
Hu said. He had expected to be
election commissioner next year,

'All of a sudden, I was
overwhelmed.'

but the sudden promotion came as
a surprise, he added.
Lopez announced his resigna
tion at last Tuesday's senate
meeting to protest the placement
on the runoff ballot of special-fee
requests for MEChA and XTV and
a referendum about a redesigned
ASSU financial-aid lobby office.
Hu said he was not at the sen
ate meeting and "has only heard
secondhand accounts" from peo
ple on both sides of the contro
versy over the special-fee
requests. He added that he has
not decided how he feels about it.
The planning for the runoff has
been done, Hu said, and there will
be "at least six security measures"
to prevent fraud. Ballot boxes will

be taped to tables, students will be
required to sign in before voting
and pollwatchers will mark the
back of Stanford IDs to ensure
each person votes only once, he
added.
Other measures will be kept
secret to prevent attempts at
cheating, Hu said.
He added that he expects 4,000
to 5,000 voters to turn out for the
runoff. The elections commission
faxed ballots to overseas cam
puses yesterday with instructions
to return them by early next week
to avoid the problems that
occurred in the general election.
Five overseas campuses failed
to return general election ballots
in time, and Stanford in Washing
ton did not receive ballots until
last Wednesday.
Hu said the issue of the Lopez'
$1,900 salary has not yet been
resolved.
