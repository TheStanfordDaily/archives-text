Farm worker activist to speak
Cesar Chavez, founder and president of the
United Farm Workers, will speak at Kresge Audi
torium tonight at 7 p.m.
According to freshmen Eva Silva and Jorge
Solis, organizers of the program, Chavez' speech
will touch on three areas: education, the current
grape boycott and U.S.-Mexican relations.
Chavez has dedicated the majority of his life
working to improve conditions for farm workers,
such as increasing wages, putting warnings on
pesticides and requiring that bathroom facilities
be available for workers.
Solis said that many Stanford students are
unaware of the boycott. "People who work in the
grape fields are not the only ones affected," said
Solis. "This is not a Cesar Chavez issue, this is
everbody's issue.
"People put in fields are affected by pesticides,
which also affect people who buy the foods. This is
an environmental issue," he said.
To bring Chavez to Stanford, Solis and Silva
coordinated a 10-member committee which has
already raised $5,500 out of the $8,500 needed for
Chavez' visit. Primary sponsors included
MEChA, the ASSU Speakers Bureau and El Cen
tro Chicano, along with 19 other organizations

and dormitories.
The $8,500 needed for the program includes a
$5,000 honorarium. However, Chavez will not
keep any of the money; he will donate it all to the
United Farm Workers.

Professors given endowed chairs
Two professors have been appointed to
endowed chairs in the schools of Engineering and
Earth Sciences.
Prof. Gordon Brown, chair of the Geology
Department, will be the first Dorrell William
Kirby professor of earth sciences, and Channing
Robertson, chair of the Chemical Engineering
Department, will be the new Ruth and William
Bowes professor of engineering.
Brown, who has taught at Stanford since 1973,
is the curator of the Stanford mineral collection.
Department chair since 1986, he studies molecu
lar-level geochemistry.
Robertson has taught here since 1970. Special
