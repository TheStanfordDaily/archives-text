President rapidly approves
Kansas disaster declaration
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Hush
today quickly signed a formal disaster declara
tion to make federal grants and low-cost loans
available to help Kansas recover from Friday's
killer tornadoes.
Bush announced the action himself at a
news conference with farm broadcast
reporters, saying, "our hearts really go out to
the victims."
"I just signed the disaster assistance (decla
ration) for Kansas and I expect as the other
requests come in, they will be processed that
rapidly," Bush said.
Kansas Gov. Joan Finney asked Bush for the
action earlier in the day.
The declaration makes available federal
assistance to individuals and businesses in But
ler and Sedgwick counties.
The aid can include temporary housing,
grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured prop
erty and funds to rebuild bridges and other
damaged public structures.
U.S. bid to lower interest rates
garners more opposition
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Bush administra
tion effort to win global interest-rate cuts to
help end America's recession ran into more for
eign opposition yesterday despite U.S. warn
ings about "risks and uncertainties" facing the
world economy.
"A recovery of world economic activity is by
no means certain," Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said, raising the specter that
without more focus on growth, downturns in
the United States, Britain and Canada could
spread to other countries.
"While each country looks to its own inter
ests, we must work collectively to achieve our
common objectives of freedom and prosperity,"
Brady told finance officials gathered for the
spring meetings of the 155-nation Interna
tional Monetary Fund and World Bank.
This year's gathering, which will end tomor
row, has been dominated by an administration
plea for lower interest rates as a way to boost
global demand.
Bush reassured by Gorbachev's
retention of power
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
said today that Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev's survival of a political challenge was
"quite reassuring" and shows that Gorbachev
"is the man there right now."
Bush, fielding questions from farm writers,
also said his China policy "paid off in spades"
with China's support for the international
sanctions that forced Iraq out of Kuwait.
Gorbachev, facing growing turmoil and
opposition within the Soviet Union, last week
faced down a challenge by offering to resign his
Communist Party leadership. He won a vote of
confidence.
"What happened last week, 1 think in a
sense was quite reassuring because there was
some widespread speculation that Mr. Gor
bachev was in trouble, even with the party,"
said Bush. "I think that showed that was not
the case."
"There is a lot of turmoil and there's a lot of
economic difficulty in the Soviet Union today.
We don't take joy at all in that," Bush said.
