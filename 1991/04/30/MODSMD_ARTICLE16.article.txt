# Quake hits Soviet Georgia; 40 killed
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — A strong earth
quake hit Soviet Georgia yesterday,
setting off rockslides in mountain vil
lages and killing at least 40 people,
authorities said.
The quake also was felt in neighbor
ing Armenia, which was devastated by
a 1988 earthquake that killed 25,000
people. There were no reports of dam
age or injuries in Armenia.
Police spokesperson Zurab
Kadzhaya in the Georgian town of
Kutaisi, near the epicenter, said yester
day night about 40 people were killed
and buildings in five mountain towns
suffered widespread damage. The offi
cial Tass news agency earlier reported
30 people killed. It was not immedi
ately known how many people were
injured.
There were fears the death toll
could rise as rescuers searched col
lapsed buildings in villages isolated by

severed communications.
An aftershock as powerful as the
initial quake struck the region at 9:33
p.m. (11:33 a.m. PDT), Tass said. U.S.
Geological Survey spokesperson Pat
Jorgenson in Menlo Park, Calif., said
the aftershock registered 6.2 on the
Richter scale.
Soviet Interior Ministry troops
already in the region to quell ethnic
unrest were ordered to the disaster
area to aid in rescue efforts.
The initial quake struck at 12:13
p.m. (2:13 a.m. PDT) in north-central
Georgia among the sparsely populated
villages and towns in the Caucasus
Mountains. It measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale, according to the Soviet
Union's Central Seismic Station.
The epicenter was near Dzhava, a
town of 11,000 people about 60 miles
northwest of the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.

In a report from Dzhava, Soviet TV
showed collapsed buildings and others
with gaping holes. Rescuers standing
atop a mound of rubble dug frantically
with their hands to remove large
stones in search of further victims.
The independent Interfax news
agency said a kindergarten, a high
school, a hospital and a printing house
were among buildings destroyed there,
in addition to 30 homes.
The evening TV program "Vremya"
showed rescuers pulling an injured
woman from a badly damaged building
in Dzhava. Another woman sat
stunned outside a shattered house
with her arm in a sling.
Don Finley of the U.S. Geological
Survey in Reston, Va., put the Richter
reading at 7.2 and said the quake
released about four times as much
energy as the 1988 Armenian quake.
Kadzhaya said by telephone from

Kutaisi, 63 miles west of Dzhava, that
about 40 people were killed in the
region yesterday and about 80 percent
of the buildings were destroyed in
Dzhava, Ambrolauri, Onei, Chiatura
and Sachkhere.
"It was terrible, really terrible,"
Marina Ivanova, a pediatrician in Tbil
isi, said by telephone.
"The building was shaking like a
house of cards. We grabbed our chil
dren and rushed downstairs."
She said other residents of her
building also fled, but that damage
appeared to be limited to cracked
walls.
Aftershocks continued throughout
the day in the region, and a "Vremva"
camera even captured one strong
aftershock collapsing an already
severely damaged building.
Electricity and water supplies were
disrupted in Dzhava.
