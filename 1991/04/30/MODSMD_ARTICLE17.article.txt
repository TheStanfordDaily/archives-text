# Allies tell rebels to allow refugees' return

ZAKHO, Iraq (AP) â€” Allied forces have
demanded that Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas stop extort
ing money from Kurdish refugees and allow them to
return to their homes, senior U.S. officers said yes
terday.
Since allied forces entered northern Iraq, some of
the Kurdish guerrillas, known as pesh merga, have
blocked the refugees' return out of fear for their
safety. Others have used the opportunity to charge
tolls, stopping the refugees at checkpoints and

demanding payment for passing through.
Col. Jim Jones, the highest-ranking US. Marine
Corps officer in northern Iraq, said U.S. patrols have
been sent to some of the more notorious checkpoints
"to tell them to knock that stuff off"
"It's immoral and it's got to stop," said Jones.
"They're straight-out bandits."
The Kurdish rebels agreed to the demands, U.S.
officials said.
In southern Iraq, meanwhile, the U.S. Army air

lifted more refugees to Saudi Arabia, in an operation
that is a prelude to the U.S. troops' own departure.
The airlift is expected to take about a week.
In wide-ranging interviews on the huge allied
effort in the north to aid the Kurds, senior American
commanders also said the military hopes to clear the
Turkish border of primitive refugee camps by June
1. By then, water will be in short supply in the hills.
About 800,000 Kurds arrived at the Turkish bor
der this month, fleeing Saddam Hussein's postwar
crackdown on their rebellion. Allied military officials
are building camps for them in northern Iraq.
The first Kurdish family arrived yesterday in the
camp built outside Zakho. They joined 576 Kurdish
men already there.
U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jay Garner, who commands
the military operation in northern Iraq, said he
expected refugees to start arriving in large numbers
in the next few days.
U.S., French, Dutch and British officials met yes
terday with about a dozen Iraqi Kurdish rebel lead
ers to tell them to stop preventing the refugees from
returning home.
After the meeting, the most senior of the Kurdish
leaders, who goes bv the name of General Ali, was
taken to one checkpoint by a U.S. helicopter. He told
his men to let Kurdish refugees pass by
In addition, the officers said allied forces told Kur
dish guerrillas that they will not tolerate violence
either in the camps or in cities within the allied secu
rity zone in northern Iraq.
The United Nations said yesterday it was sending
a convoy carrying personnel and supplies to Zakho
on Tuesday, in a first step toward assuming control
of the allied camps.
But Turkish President Turgut Ozal said the
United Nations could not provide sufficient protec
tion for the camps. He called yesterday for a
longterm Western military presence in Iraq, defeated
last February in the Gulf war.
"If the allied powers do not maintain their pres
ence in northern Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds will start run
ning again as soon as they see an Iraqi soldier," Ozal
told the Iranian news agency IRNA.
The European Community on Sunday endorsed a
British call for a U.N. police force to protect the
camps. The five permanent members of the Security
Council were to discuss the plan.
But Belgian diplomat Erik Suy, who led a U.N.
mission to Baghdad last week, said yesterday the
proposal stood little chance of success.
