## A 						matter of ethics 
### 
Media should respect
rape victims' right to
remain anonymous

The issues of victims'
rights, a fair trial and the
right to know raise the con
troversial question of whether or
not the media should be allowed to
publicize the names of rape vic
tims. While the government should
not exercise censorship, this is an
ethical issue which the news media
should resolve on the side of with
holding victims' names from publi
cation.
Recently, The New York Times
and NBC disclosed the name of a
rape victim. Their actions have
been justified by some on the
grounds that rape victims are the
only criminal accusers who are
protected from public scrutiny.
Others who support the identifica
tion of rape victims believe that
publication of their names will
reduce the stigma which rape car
ries. In the long run, they argue,
this would make victims more will
ing to report the crime.
This logic is askew.
Rape victims are often portrayed
as being somehow responsible for
the crime, as a part of the problem.
Publishing their names would not
only broaden this prevalent mis
representation but also further
deter victims from going to the
police. Publicly dragging victims
through the mud only adds to the
stigma of rape.
It is also hypocritical for the
news media to publish details of
the victim's life, while at the same
time withholding his or her name.
Details of the victim's sexual
exploits in the past or mode of
attire are irrelevant. Rape is still
rape, regardless of what the victim
wore at the time of the crime.

While these details may deserve
scrutiny in a court of law, they only
serve to further misrepresent the
crime of rape in the media.
What is especially troubling
about the actions of The New York
Times and NBC is that they were
willing to publish the name of this
victim simply because a supermar
ket tabloid had already done so.
Motivated by concerns for reader
ship and television ratings,
respectable members of the media
apparently have decided to follow
suit. Invariably, the action of one
irresponsible member of the media
sets off the proverbial media "food
chain," in which a small source
prints a rape victim's name, thus
the bigger sources print it. And the
rape victim, in the end, is "gobbled
up" by all.
This issue should come down* to
the consent of the rape victim. The
publication of a victim's name is an
invasion of privacy, and only the
victim should have the right to
decide whether or not to be identi
fied by the media. The media has
no more ethical justification to
publicly identify a rape victim
without consent than militant
homosexual groups have to "force
gays out of the closet."
Clearly the case of rape is an
extraordinary one, where the vic
tim's interests are in need of spe
cial protection not accorded other
victims of crime. Yet, it should be
stressed that this is a purely ethical
question. The media has a consti
tutional right, based upon the First
Amendment and the public's right
to know, to print the facts. Allow
ing the government to exercise cen
sorship over the truth would not
only be unconstitutional, it would
set a very dangerous precedent.
The decision regarding publica
tion of rape victims' names prop
erly belongs in the hands of the
media. However, we urge them to
exercise caution and heed certain
compelling ethical concerns.
