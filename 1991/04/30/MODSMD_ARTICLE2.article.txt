# Grad teaching awards announced
## 
### Howard Libit Staff writer 
The winners of the ASSU grad
uate teaching awards were
announced yesterday after the
tabulations of the graduate stu
dents' votes were completed.
Recipients of the award in the
large-class category are Alexander
Fetter, physics; -James Plummer,
electrical engineering; and Joseph
Grundfest, law.
The winners in the small-class
group are Stephen Boyd, electrical
engineering; Harry Trost, chem
istry; and Robert Woisberg, law.
During the April 17-18 ASSU
election, graduate students were
able to vote for one teacher from a

class with more than 30 students
and one from a class with fewer
than 30 students.
One winner was selected from
each of the three graduate dis
tricts for the ASSU Senate —
engineering and earth sciences;
business, law and medicine; and
education and humanities and sci
ences — in both class-size cate
gories.
Receiving honorable mention
for exceptionally strong showings
are Parviz Moin, mechanical engi
neering, in the large-class cate
gory and Robert Gordon, law and
David Siegmund, statistics, in the
small class-category.
"I hope that any professor
would consider it an honor to be
recognized as an excellent instruc
tor," said graduate senator Doug
Bone, who organized the graduate
teaching awards. "Many profes
sors have pressure on them to
conduct research, and it should be
pleasing to be recognized for the
commitment they have made in
the classroom."
Professors selected for the
award expressed a similar reac
tion.
"All of us take teaching very
seriously. It is often difficult to

balance between teaching and
research, and it is really nice for
my efforts to be recognized,"
Plummer said.
Bone said he does recognize
some potential problems in the
current system. For instance, pro
fessors in small departments may
not receive as many votes as those
in larger departments within the
same voting district.
Some professors also teach
classes for both graduate and
undergraduate students and may
receive some votes for both ASSU
teaching awards but not enough
from either group to actually win,
said Bone, a graduate student in
engineering.
As with the undergraduate
award, winners in the graduate

category will receive a plaque rec
ognizing their work and a congrat
ulatory advertisement in The
Daily.
Bone said he hopes to "institu
tionalize the award" and keep it
"simple and accessible to large
numbers of students" through the
spring election.

For the Record

An article in Friday's Daily
incorrectly stated the number of
arrests after the Alpha Sigma
"Exotic Erotic" party. There were
four arrests, plus one hospitaliza
tion. In addition, only two of the
arrests were actually made at the
party.
