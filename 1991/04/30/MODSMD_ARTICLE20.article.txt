## Thanks but no thanks, for all that the ASSU has done 
### 
I WANT TO THANK THE ASSU Sen
ate for reaffirming my faith in Stan
ford's student government.
After attending the most recent sen
ate meeting, I was glad that I had a
chance to witness the compromising of
democratic principles in the interest of
special student groups. I was so confi
dent of my student government's abili
ties that I left after the decision to put
MEChA on the ballot of the runoff elec
tion was reached.
I knew very well that the senate
would stand by the interpretation that
when students say "no," they really
mean "yes!"
When I left the senate meeting, I won
dered why the U.S. government doesn't
operate under the same guidelines as the
ASSU; after all, it seems to work very
smoothly.
I am personally outraged at the con
duct of elections commissioner Raul
Lopez, in this general election.
After all, it seems perfectly clear to

me that groups, like MEChA, which have
received special fee requests in the past,
would need to be reminded of their
responsibilities in the election procedure.
Also, I cannot believe that Lopez would
dare imply that the mistakes in the elec
tion handbook were caused by members
of MEChA!
Furthermore, I am livid that The
Stanford Daily would issue a "no recom
mendation" in their editorial.
Doesn't The Daily realize that stu
dents on this campus have no minds of
their own, and only consider the issues
as The Daily presents them?
I am so pleased that Lopez has
resigned from his post as the elections
commissioner, though I do have to agree
with ASSU Senator Mae Lee that Lopez'
actions were indeed "irresponsible."
However, I am surprised that Janine
DeFao has not stepped down from her
post as the editor in chief of The Daily.
Doesn't she realize that under the guise
of "objectivity," her staff has delivered a

tremendous blow to the supporters of
organizations like MEChA by not search
ing high and low for a group representa
tive for the privilege of obtaining infor
mation about their fee request?
Despite the failings of an individual
and an organization, the senate, once
again, has come to the students' rescue.
I would like to thank members of the
People's Platform, especially senators
David Brown, Naomi Onaga and Council
of Presidents member Ingrid Nava, for
being instrumental in stopping the silly
debate senators John Overdeck, Douglas
Bone and James Vera tried to engage the
senate in regarding the principles of the
democratic process. Why should
Overdeck, Bone and Vera be concerned
with protecting the sanctity of this elec
tion and voicing student opinions?
Hasn't it been painfully obvious from
last year's general election that the prin
ciples of a fair election must be compro
mised to ensure a fair election? Perhaps
these three should consider resigning. If

not, I wouldn't be surprised if the senate
came to the students' rescue, again, by
impeaching these senators who were so
bold as to question the People's Plat
form's party line. Come on, we know
who's right. There is hardly need for a
debate.
All in all, I am pleased to find that the
run-off election to occur on May 2 and 3
has the provision that any registered
student at Stanford can vote, regardless
of whether they voted in the first elec
tion or not. This means that our hero
ines and heroes from the People's Plat
form can rally all of their friends to
ensure that our wonderful ASSU, fully
accountable to students, will maintain
its position as the representative of Stan
ford students.
I urge you to join me in supporting
their noble efforts. Also, I would strongly
encourage you to attend a senate meet
ing. It sure made a believer out of me!
