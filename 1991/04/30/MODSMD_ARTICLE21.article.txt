# Student groups such as MEChA do deserve special fees
## 
### 
IN HIS MONDAY COLUMN, TIM
Marklein attacked the use of the spe
cial fee system that many student
groups use to fund raise. While we agree
the system needs major revision, we
strongly disagree with a few of his asser
tions.
First, we object to his claim that some
of the groups requesting funding
through this method do not deserve
them because they are unrepresentative
and exclusive. In particular, Marklein
singles out MEChA.
He claims that with only 20 active
members, MEChA does not deserve its
fee request, ignoring the fact that pro
grams they fund — Cinco de Mayo, Gran
Posada and Ballet Folklorico, among
others — involve a cross-section of the

Stanford community.
If he applied his same criteria to his
own organization, The Stanford Daily,
Marklein might find himself without a
fee assessment. Herein lies the compari
son: MEChA's active members provide
services that benefit the entire Stanford
community
There have been questions raised
about MECliA's openness. Replace the
word MEChA with The Daily, and you
will find that the statement also rings
true. Thus, Marklein should recognize
that contributions, not mere numbers,
should be the criteria by which we grant
fee assessments.
Second, we object to Marklein's claims
that students lose in the special fee pro
cess. He seems to forget that the money

is going to student groups, which per
form student services.
Do we really want to attend a Stan
ford without the SURE Escort Service,
without Club Sports, without a Cinco de
Mayo Celebration, without The Daily?
While Marklein advocates more out
side funding of such programs, we find
this solution to be neither as easy nor as
effective as he suggests.
Without special fees, students would
be forced to spend a disproportionate
amount of their time seeking funding
instead of strengthening their programs
or developing new ones. Furthermore,
the University's current budget crisis
makes outside fund raising all the more
difficult. Since students benefit from the

services provided by the groups that,
receive special fees, it seems fair that
they should pay.
As students consider whether or not
to support the fee assessments that will
appear on the runoff ballot this Thurs
day and Friday, we urge them to base
their votes on the contributions the
groups provide to the campus commu
nity.
And in the year to come, we hope that
the students who voted "yes" make good
on their pledge by not taking the money
back.
