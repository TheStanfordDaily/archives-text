## Freedom of the echo boxes 
### 
Freedom of the press figures
prominently among the constitu
tionally guaranteed freedoms, and
it is possible to find in print a wider range
of fact and opinion in the United States
than in most countries of the world.
Unfortunately, as A.J. Liebling once
said, "Freedom of the press is guaranteed
only to those who own one," and those
who own most of the presses in this coun
try seem to share essentially the same
interests.
In contrast to the diversity present
among many small publications with lim
ited circulations, the mainstream news
papers display a remarkable homogeneity.
No American news is traditionally
dedicated to a critical analysis of govern
ment policies. In fact, the major publish
ers are depressingly willing to accept gov
ernment pronouncements at face value.
As an exercise in a government class,
we were asked to keep a record of the
front page stories in a major newspaper.
Our professor told us that year after year
his students, raised on the belief that
freedom of press automatically ensures
its diversity, were stunned by the similar
ity of their files of clippings. We were no
exception.
While occasional attempts at govern
ment control of the press do occur in this
country, the prevalence of self-censoring
evident in the the major newspapers is far
more noisome. To confront this situation,
Sonoma State University Prof. Carl
Jensen founded Project Censored in
1976. Together with a panel of media
experts, he annually selects those news
stories that were most studiously ignored

by the national media during the previous
year.
A look at the top five "censored" sto
ries selected by the judges for 1990 is
quite revealing of the bias in mainstream
news reporting (in case you are inter
ested, Public Broadcasting Service aired a
documentary on these and other underre
ported stories on Feb. 25):
• The events leading up to the Gulf
war: Eager not to seem unpatriotic, the
media was so docile that even Pete
Williams, the Pentagon's spokesman,
noted that "the reporting has been largely
a recitation of what administration peo
ple have said";
• Problems with the $500 billion sav
ings and loan bailout, including doubts
that the federal agency in charge of
resolving the situation is aware of how its
money is being spent;
• The role of the CIA in the savings
and loan crisis: New evidence indicates
that saving and loan associations may
have been used by CIA operatives to laun
der money from drug trafficking to be
used for covert aid to the Nicaraguan con
tras;
• The environmental impact of launch
ing the space shuttle, which releases 250
tons of hydrochloric acid into the air each
time, contributing to the destruction of
the ozone layer; and
• The truth behind the widely touted
war on drugs, which, according to a for
mer Drug Enforcement Agency agent, is
really a sham, with the government
attempting to use the press to convince
Americans that it is seriously trying to
address the drug problem.

Other underreported stories included
the Pentagon's secret billion-dollar black
budget, new information about George
Bush's involvement in the Iran-contra
affair obtained from Oliver North's
diaries and the impending crisis among
the nation's commercial banks.
While these were deemed the most sig
nificant on a national scale, they far from
exhaust the list of issues nominated to
the project. Most people can probably
think of some stories themselves that
seem to receive far less coverage than
they deserve or have been subject to sus
piciously one-sided reporting.
In light of the above, The New York
Times' motto: "All the News That's Fit to
Print," takes on a rather disconcerting
meaning. One can hardly expect newspa
pers to be unbiased, but selective report
ing is a rather more serious issue, espe
cially when the dailies all appear to
use the same selection criterion: Don't
challenge the powers-that-be too much.
Important as freedom of the press is to
a successful democracy, it does little good
if those who own the presses fail to
exploit their liberties to the fullest, as is
the case in this countrv today.

Maurits van der Veen may be one of the
underreported culprits in the commercial
banking crisis: Two of the three banks he
had accounts with in 1990 have since
become insolvent. His column appears
every Tuesday.
