### 
University is unfairly punishing Alpha Sigma for party incident

My name is helge ternsten.
I have worked at Stanford for 13
years. I have been the cook at
Alpha Sigma for almost 12 years. During
this time I have also been a "friendly
ear," a frequent advisor and an adult
who has always cared about the welfare
of the students I serve. I am writing this
letter because I am angry about the
recent social suspension of Alpha Sig.
I am upset because I feel the house
and its students are being treated
unfairly and are being punished by Uni
versity officials who already have an
unreasonable bias against them. I also
fear that because the Stanford adminis
tration is especially defensive at this
time (due to the "indirect-cost scandal,"
the Stuart Reges case and, I regret to
say, the past personal problems of some
of the officials investigating Alpha Sig),
it may overreact and make examples,
a.k.a., scapegoats, of the Alpha Sig resi
dents.

It is particularly ironic that Alpha Sig
is being suspended at this time because I
see this year's residents as some of the
most responsible, reliable and caring stu
dents that I have ever encountered. Over
the years Alpha Sig has had great diver
sity among its residents: all races, many
nationalities, nice people, not-so-nice
people, straight students, gay students
and most important, male and female
students.
In the early '80s, Alpha Sig was forced
out of its national organization because
it insisted on admitting equal numbers
of men and women. Its residents have
had to work out the inevitable difficul
ties of learning to live together and to
respect one another. As someone who is
personally concerned about racism and
sexism, I have seen spectacular, though
often painful, growth in this house con
cerning these matters. I wonder how
many other houses can say the same.
I am also aware that some outside

students do not see Alpha Sig as a great
place to live. I can only say that I do, and
that prejudices against it are unfounded
and probably result from past house
problems that have since been addressed.
I have always felt that all the cooks on
campus should be as lucky as I am to
work in such a wonderful house.
Regarding the recent Exotic Erotic
party, I have attended these events in the
past and I can honestly say that I have
never seen a better job of checking IDs,
checking hand stamps and trying to con
form to Stanford's new drug and alcohol
regulations, as confusing and awkward
as they may be.
The facts surrounding the arrests of
individuals — none of whom were Alpha
Sig residents — somehow associated
with this party are certainly not clear at
this time. To immediately blame Alpha
Sig is unfair, unjust and shows little con
cern for "due process." How about the
University placing the responsibility on

the students arrested instead of defam
ing Alpha Sig and all the students who
live there!
Unfortunately, this social suspension
comes at a time when Alpha Sig is
already hurting from the administra
tion's decision to eliminate two more
guaranteed housing spots from all self
operative houses, a step that can be seen
as an attempt to eliminate such houses
all together. As someone who knows
firsthand (not from sitting behind a
desk) how destructive to morale and
community feeling the new draw system
has been the past two years, I would like
to add a parting shot since cooks don't
say much around here:
Many of my fellow cooks don't like
their jobs as much under the new sys
tem. A wonderful cook at a neighboring
house just quit after 15 years because, in
his words, "I don't know anybody here
anymore." Big deal, you say, but as stu

dents can tell you, "A good cook is hard
to find."
Acting Director of the Row Jack Chin
says he wants to standardize and to
reduce inequities. Standardize what?
The students? I'm not sure what
"inequities" he's talking about, espe
cially since he supports traditional fra
ternities which are hardly "dens of
equity." Why not return the houses to
being homes away from home, as
opposed to places to stay for a year.
As I said, cooks don't say much
around here, but I hope that many peo
ple who have known me over the years
see me as a hard worker, a good cook, a
credible, honest person and someone
who loves Stanford and its students.
With this in mind, I hope the issues I
have addressed in this letter will receive
a fair hearing.
Helge Ternsten
Cook, Alpha Sigma
