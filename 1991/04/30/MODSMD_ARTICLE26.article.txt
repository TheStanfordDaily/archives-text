# Editorial dealt mean blows to hardworking election officials

### 
I am writing to defend the ASSU elec
tions commission from The Daily's hypo
critical attack in its editorial, "A Job
Poorly Done."
First, I must defend former elections
commissioner Raul Lopez against the
accusation that he had a "lack of enthu
siasm for fulfilling his job," simply
because he delayed before counting the
last few votes.
In the time leading up to the election,
Lopez' performance and enthusiasm
were both terrific. As for the period of
time immediately following the election,
I believe that anyone counting votes
until 3 a.m., while being harassed by
candidates, XTV and The Daily, deserves
at least a little rest. The elections com
missioner's task is to run fair elections,
not to get election results in time for the
next morning's Daily.

I am also disturbed by The Daily's
criticism of the ASSU election handbook.
The handbook was indeed a mess, but
what is more disgraceful is The Daily's
lack of effort to remedy the situation.
The final copy of the election hand
book was available one week before the
election. The Daily, knowing how misin
formed students were likely to be regard
ing senate candidates and other ballot
issues, did not take it upon itself to pro
vide students with the valuable informa
tion.
Is The Daily worth two-and-a-half
cents a day to me? Not when it doesn't
use its resources to provide badly needed
information to students. If The Daily
were truly interested in accurate election
information, it would not charge the
elections commission a prohibitively
expensive $1,000 a page for one day of
advertising. (Especially if The Daily is
then going to complain about the size of
the $20,000 election budget.)
I appreciate the praise for Chaparral's
election handbook, but it is truly an odd
situation when the Chaparral becomes a
more valuable source of election infor-

mation than the Daily.
Lopez was selected for his organiza
tional ability, not his desktop publishing
experience. He made an effort to make
up for his sorry handbook by subsidizing
the Chaparral's handbook. Similar infor
mation could have also appeared in The
Daily, had The Daily put students' infor
mational needs ahead of its appetite for
advertising revenue from student organi
zations.
Instead of complaining about the
quality of information available to stu
dents, why doesn't The Daily put its
money where its mouth is?
