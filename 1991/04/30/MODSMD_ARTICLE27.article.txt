# Kennedy ludicrously compared drug speech to sexual harassment
## 
### 
We would like to respond to Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy's letter
criticizing Stuart Heges.

Kennedy brings up many issues about
drug use. He speaks of an "industry
based upon exploitation," but how many
such industries are supported by our
government? And is it not painfully obvi
ous that the exploitation is a direct result
of the illegality of these substances?
Kennedy's concern for the "health of
our society" would be better expressed
through support of education about the
pros and cons of drug use than through
condemnation of people who choose to
speak about it.
The health issue becomes a curious
one when the legality of certain drugs is
concerned — yes, there are crack babies,
but what about babies with fetal alcohol
syndrome? And even if, as Kennedy says,
some evidence points to the adverse
effects of psychoactive drugs — and such
evidence is not conclusive — it is the
individual's choice to take that chance.
But drug use is not the main issue.
The most frustrating point of Kennedy's
letter is his ill-conceived metaphor com
paring Reges' conversation with a stu
dent to sexual harassment. As female

students, we cannot believe this compari
son has been made.
A situation in which a student is
coerced against his or her will bears no
resemblance to a mutual conversation
involving a request for information and
the delivery of that information, no mat
ter what the subject.
The student solicited Reges' opinion
on drugs, as he might have consulted an
encyclopedia or attended the conference
on psychadelics held at Stanford. Reges
has not forced his opinion. The student
is an adult who makes his own decisions,
as were the students who attended a
class dinner with Reges — was the pro
fessor responsible for babysitting them
to make sure they didn't drink?
Although Kennedy feels there is "con
fusion" over the "speech/conduct bound
ary," we feel that Reges' conduct so far
has been irreproachable and legal.
