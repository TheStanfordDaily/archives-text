## Batsmen hope to regain form against St. Mary's 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
By now Mark Marquess has probably unclenched
his teeth. The Stanford baseball coach returned
from Tuscon yesterday an unhappy man, his tightly
closed mouth no doubt keeping in the screams. After
Sunday's 21-11 debacle it would be hard to fault the
15th year coach for his concern.
Heading into today's non-conference game
against St. Mary's, Stanford is experiencing a late
season slump that has not just taken the team out of
contention for the Pacific 10 Southern Division
crown, but for the first time all season makes their
hold on second-place look precarious.
After seeing the Cardinal drop two of three down
in Arizona, and six of their last 10 Six-Pac contests,
USC has finally ended all the mathametical specula
tion and clinched the league title. At 14-9, Stanford
finds itself six full games behind the Trojans and
only 3.5 games ahead of the third place California
Golden Bears.
The Bears have yet to defeat the Cardinal in the
two games the teams have played, but owing to Stan
ford's inconsistancy, seasonal trends are about as
relaible as Bo Jackson's hip.
Arizona is a case in point. Forced to play the Wild
cats in a doubleheader last week after being swept by
UCLA, Stanford came out with two complete games
and five home runs to win both games. Four days
later they started a three games series against the
same team and the quality pitching was con
spiciously absent.
Aaron Dorlarque pitched a good game to secure
the 13-7 win in the second game, but that was about
the lone pitching bright spot. Earlier in the season

Marquess had said that a return to the form that had
made the team No. 1 in the nation would mean bet
ter pitching. The double-header last week proved
how correct that statement was, but lately those
kind of performances have been the exception, not
the rule.
Luckily for the Cardinal, what has been a given is
the play of first baseman David McCarty. While his
team has been struggling, McCarty has been white
hot. The Houston, Tx. native has made himself a
strong Player of the Year canidate with his .425 aver
age, 51 RBI and league-leading 20 home runs. The
junior is currently riding a 23-game hitting streak
that has seen him hit .477 with 10 homers and 30
RBI in the month of April.
With 12 games left in the season McCarty is on
line to break Rick Lundblade's 1985 record of 25
round-trippers in a season, and alos has a chance to
break Mark McGuire's Six-Pac record of 32 that the
former Trojan set in 1984.
The other bright spots for the Cardinal have been
designated hitter David Cornell and center fielder
Jeffrey Hammonds. Cornell has raised his batting
average to a season-high .315 after going six-for-nine
in two games last weekend in Tuscon. The transfer
from Santa Clara has hit in his last six games, going
12-for-26 in the process.
Hammonds has broken out of his mid-season
slump by hitting .500 in his last four games with a
home run, five RBI and seven runs scored.
The game today with St. Mary's will provide the
team with a breather from the Six-Pac and possibly
allow some seldom-used players to get on the field. It
also gives the team a great chance to gain a victory
and open their coach's mouth with a smile.

It happens to the best of us, and it's happened to the Stanford baseball team: a slump. The Cardinal nine
will try to climb out of it today at 2:30 p.m. at St. Mary's. The team hopes that the game against the Gaels
will be the starting point of a late-season surge.
