# Let's face it: sometimes the truth sucks
## 
### 
Gee, was it something I said? Last
Wednesday, a pair of Stanford swim
mers "politely" expressed their dis
pleasure at my column on Janet and Jerry
Evans. While I'd rather not discuss our con
versation — if you don't have anything nice
to say, then, well ... — several points are
worth mentioning:
• Both swimmers said that people had
approached them and asked what was wrong
with Stanford's swimming program, and,
specifically, what was wrong with coach
Richard Quick. Apparently these people —
according to the two swimmers — thought
that we must not have a very good women's
swimming team.
Who are you idiots, and what kind of
drugs are you taking?
The Stanford women's program has fin
ished second at the NCAA meet the last two
years and won the title in 1989. That's
pretty lousy. Quick coached Texas to five
straight NCAA titles before coming to Stan
ford to lead the Cardinal to the 1989 champi
onship. That's pretty lousy, too.
Now, I'm not sure if these doubters actu
ally exist — could anyone be that stupid? —
or if the two swimmers I talked to are just
extremely insecure. I guess there's no way to
find out.
• Both swimmers said I made the pro
gram look bad. Time out: Janet Evans, not I,
made the program look bad. Anyone with
half a brain could have figured that out, even
if they believed Evans' "20-hour-rule" rea
son.
Why? Simple: If the 20-hour-non-limit
were the only reason Evans stopped out, she
could have given up her eligibility and
stayed at Stanford to train with Quick. Obvi
ously, she didn't, which means she was
unhappy with her training here.
Still don't believe me? Go find Sunday's
Examiner, in which the following quote
appeared straight from Evans herself:
"I am really excited to be here at Texas
and train with Mark Schubert and the rest
of the Texas team," Evans said. "If I'm going
to train somewhere, it might as well be with
the best program and the best coach in the

country."
Ouch.
• Both swimmers — this I had trouble
swallowing — said that I should have
believed Evans no matter what reason she
gave for leaving.
Hello? Look, if I've learned nothing else at
Stanford — and, if you ask any of my profs,
I haven't — it's that we should never, never,
never simply accept what people tell us with
out critically examining it.
That's not just the job of a quasi-journal
ist; it's the obligation of every free-thinking
student and citizen. Once we stop thinking
critically and questioning motivations, we
turn into a bunch of cute little lemmings
headed for the nearest cliff. No thanks.
• Finally, both swimmers were annoyed
that I had the gall to shed light on a slightly
unpleasant situation in front of the entire
Stanford community.
Why the hell is The Daily here?
All I have to say is that sometimes the
truth sucks. Sometimes the truth is not
going to be kind to Stanford, sometimes it
won't be kind to people like Evans. Forgive
me for bringing up a situation that doesn't
exude an air of "Gee! Isn't Stanford great?
Isn't everything here perfect? And isn't it
wonderful how all our athletes put aca
demics first?"
Let's get one thing clear: If I'm gonna rip
on USC for lying about Todd Marinovich's
suspension, I'm gonna rip on someone at
Stanford when I have strong evidence that
they're not telling the truth either.
And besides, anyone who thinks I wrote
that column just so I could make Evans,
Quick, or Stanford look bad completely,
emphatically (and, to be honest, astonish

ingly) missed the entire point. Try reading it
again.
Now, in other news. . . The deadline is
12 days away, and by then Stanford
basketball fans will have their
answer.
The date on that Thursday will be May 12
— the last day underclassmen can declare
for the 1991 NBA draft. The last day anyone
can make a choice between school and a
whole mess o' money.
And, perhaps, the last day Adam Keefe
calls himself a Stanford basketball player.
The question of "Should he stay or should
he go?" has been asked about a zillion times
in the past few months, as observers have
watched the junior center rip opponents to
pieces. Some say Keefe should wait another
year to develop his skills and possibly move
up in the draft; others say he should forget
playing here and grab the cash while he can.
Just about everyone, in fact, seems to
think that they know just what's best for
Keefe. And so, since I've always been one to
just follow the crowd, here's my own humble
opinion on what's best for him:
I don't have a clue.
Sorry, but I'm not gonna pretend I know
what's best for Keefe, partially because it's
his fricking life and partially because 1 don't
know enough about what he needs to
improve to play in the NBA. However, it
might be worthwhile to look at both the Go
and Stay rationales to see if either makes
any sense:
Go: For the money, a.k.a. financial secu
rity for the rest of his life. This is a given,
because if Keefe declares he'll be drafted in
the top 15 (the word is the Warriors, who
pick 15th, love him). That means a hefty
signing bonus and a contract for, say, four
years and $3 million. At least.
Stay: The money will be there next year.
. . . unless the NBA suddenly adopts a salary
structure for rookies. Hmm.
Go: There aren't a lot of great big men in
this draft — yet — and Keefe might not
