# Athletes of the Week

At the Pacific 10 Conference Tennis
Championships this weekend, the Stanford
Cardinal found itself with two winners. On
the women's side, Sandra Birch was victori
ous; on the men's, it was Alex O'Brien.
Normally, such an achievement would
clearly net Birch and O'Brien The Daily's
Athletes of the Week awards. Unfortunately,
the two netters were honored last time
round and, well, we like to spread the wealth.

To that end, we select another pair of
deserving sports figures, with a decidedly
foreign flavor: Jackie Edwards of track
and field and Christian Cevaer of men's
golf.
Edwards, a 5-foot-7 junior from Nassau,
Bahamas, put on a show at the Big Meet
against California Saturday. She started off
with a 21 foot, 2 1/2-inch long jump, which
qualified her for NCAAs. The leap also best
ed a decade-old Stanford Stadium record.
Next up for Edwards was the lead leg in
the 4xloo-meter relay. She and teammates
Rhonda Oliver, Alysia Hubbard and Chryste
Gaines were victorious in a school-record
45.32 seconds.
In the 100, Edwards finished second to
Gaines — but don't think she was done win
ning yet. A lifetime-best 41 foot, 10 1/2-inch
triple jump gave Edwards yet another school
best.
Finally, she finished the day with a sec
ond-place finish in the 200.

Cevaer, a 6-foot junior from Cannes,
France, has come close to winning a tourna
ment twice in recent weeks — only to come
up short at the end. This weekend at the
Brigham Young Cougar Classic, though, not
even an unseasonal snowstorm could stop
the sizzling Cevaer.
The Stanford star led all golfers after 36
holes when it appeared that the frozen white
stuff would stop the tourney cold. He would
have been declared the winner.
But, afler a lengthy delay, play resumed
and Cevaer was ready. He birdied the 14th

and 15th holes to move ahead of BYU's Ryan
Rhees for good. Three straight pars closed
out Cevaer's round and left him with a five
under-par 211 for the Classic.
It was Cevaer's first win since he took the
Pac-10 title two years ago as a freshman.
Cevaer will have a chance to win that event
again as the Cardinal plays host to the con
ference championships Friday through Sun
day.
