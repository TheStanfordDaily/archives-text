# Keefe makes the cut
## Junior is one of 17 on Pan Am team 
### 
Stamford center Adam Keefe,
who led his team to the National
Invitation Tournament title last
month, was one of 13 players to
survive the first-round cut at the
U.S. Pan American Games trials
last weekend.
"I thought I played all right,"
said Keefe, who was Stanford's
MVP for the second straight year
in 1990-91. "I try not to rate
myself in terms of points and
rebounds but more on effort, and
I thought I played hard."

Keefe and his 12 Pan Am team
mates were chosen from a field of
38 players by Purdue coach Gene
Keady, the 1991 U.S. Pan Am
coach.
"I'm really happy with this
group, first of all because of their
attitude and character, and then
secondly I think their team quick
ness is good," Keady said. "I think
the strength of this team is the
versatility of it. You've got a lot of
guys who can play a lot of differ
ent positions and I think that's
our biggest strength."
The 13 players who survived
the cut will be joined by four more
who were unable to attend the tri
als. The entire 17-man squad will
reassemble on July 15 for training
camp at Purdue. Five of them will
be cut, paring the squad to its 12-
man limit, by the time the Pan Am
Games start in Havana on August
3.
Keefe, however, might not
make it to the camp, because he
only has until May 12 to decide if
he wants to give up his college eli
gibility and enter the June NBA
draft. If he does so, the team that
selects him may try to discourage
him from playing in the Games for
fear of an injury.
"I need to think about it a little
more," said Keefe, who added he
has yet to make a decision on
entering the draft.
Keefe set Stanford records for
points per game (21.5), field goals
(252), points (711), free throws
(203) and minutes played (1,204).
The 6-foot-9 junior, who made the
all-Pacific 10 Conference team for
the second straight year, is Stan
ford's fifth all-time leading scorer
(1,585 points) and rebounder
(764).
Keefe played out of position at
center for most of the 1991 season
— his natural position is power
forward — and, to his surprise,
was at center again during the tri
als.
"I was finally thinking I'd get
out away from the hoop, but they
had me in there against Elmore
Spencer (of UNLV), who's 7-foot
1, 450 pounds," Keefe said. "I was
also playing against (Eric) Mon
tross (of North Carolina) and
Mike Peplowski (from Michigan
State), who's about 6-11, 435.
"I had some success against
them; it made things a little diffi
cult for me, but I still did pretty
well."
The 17-man training-camp ros
ter includes three players from
NCAA champion Duke, including
6-foot-11 forward Christian Laet
tner, who was the NCAA tourna
ment MVP Laettner was one of
the four players to request and
receive a waiver to miss the trials

Freshman swingman Grant
Hill and sophomore guard
Thomas Hill are the other two
Blue Devils on the squad.
The only Pacific 10 Conference
player to join Keefe on the roster
was UCLA junior forward Tracy
Murray, best known for shooting
the ball anytime he's within 40
feet of the hoop. Only three other
players from west of the Missis
sippi made the roster: Spencer,
Pepperdine forward Doug
Christie, and forward Byron
Houston of Oklahoma State.
Rounding out the frontcourt
players are Montross, Peplowski,
6-9 forward Tom Gugliotta of
North Carolina State and 6-7
Clarence Weatherspoon of South
ern Miss.
The guards other than Hill are
Seton Hall's 6-4 Tony Dehere,
Ohio State's 6-6 Jimmy Jackson,
6-8 Walt Williams of Maryland
and the sleeper of the year, 6-0
point guard Anthony Bennett of
Wisconsin-Green Bay.
Notre Dame considers
Montgomery for job
ATLANTA (AP) - Bobby
Cremins took himself out of the
running for Notre Dame's vacant
basketball coaching job Monday,
deciding instead to remain at
Georgia Tech. Stanford's Mike
Montgomery is now considered to
be one of the leading candidates
to replace the departed Digger
Phelps.
Although he admitted that the
Irish job was tempting, Cremins
said, "My feeling for my players
and the Georgia Tech family and
friends was too strong for me to
pursue any other interests right
now.
"The next step was to go to
Notre Dame for an interview. I
decided not to do that. It might
have been too tempting."
Cremins took over a Georgia
Tech team in 1981 that had won
only one Atlantic Coast Confer
ence game in two years. Four
years later, he led the Yellow Jack
ets to an ACC title.
Cremins reportedly was the
leading candidate for the head
coaching job at Notre Dame after
Phelps resigned April 15.
"I was never offered the job,"
Cremins said Monday. "I was only
offered to interview for it. But
when you're Irish and Catholic,
it's something that was very dif
ficult not to look into."
Among other reported candi
dates for the Notre Dame job are
former Irish player and SMU
coach John Shumate, Nebraska's
Danny Nee and Montgomery.
In five years at Stanford, Mont
gomery has won 100 games. He
has led the Cardinal to four
straight postseason appearances
including the 1989 NCAA tourna
ment. This season was Stanford's
most succcessful since 1942. The
team won the National Invitation
Tournament.
Cremins said he made his de
cision Sunday night and called
Notre Dame athletic director Dick
Rosenthal.
"Dick Rosenthal handled this
with class," said Cremins. "He
wanted me to come up there for
an interview. It's a special place
and I was nervous about it."
If he had gone for the interview,
would he have accepted the job?

Cremins took over a Georgia
Tech team in 1981 that had won
only one Atlantic Coast Confer
ence game in two years. Four
years later, he led the Yellow Jack
ets to an ACC title.
Cremins reportedly was the
leading candidate for the head
coaching job at Notre Dame after
Phelps resigned April 15.
"I was never offered the job,"
Cremins said Monday. "I was only
offered to interview for it. But
when you're Irish and Catholic,
it's something that was very dif
ficult not to look into."
Among other reported candi
dates for the Notre Dame job are
former Irish player and SMU
coach John Shumate, Nebraska's
Danny Nee and Montgomery.
In five years at Stanford, Mont
gomery has won 100 games. He
has led the Cardinal to four
straight postseason appearances
including the 1989 NCAA tourna
ment. This season was Stanford's
most succcessful since 1942. The
team won the National Invitation
Tournament.
Cremins said he made his de
cision Sunday night and called
Notre Dame athletic director Dick
Rosenthal.
"Dick Rosenthal handled this
with class," said Cremins. "He
wanted me to come up there for
an interview. It's a special place
and I was nervous about it."
If he had gone for the interview,
would he have accepted the job?
"We'll never know,"he said.
Stamford center Adam Keefe,
who led his team to the National
Invitation Tournament title last
month, was one of 13 players to
survive the first-round cut at the
U.S. Pan American Games trials
last weekend.
"I thought I played all right,"
said Keefe, who was Stanford's
MVP for the second straight year
in 1990-91. "I try not to rate
myself in terms of points and
rebounds but more on effort, and
I thought I played hard."

Keefe and his 12 Pan Am team
mates were chosen from a field of
38 players by Purdue coach Gene
Keady, the 1991 U.S. Pan Am
coach.
"I'm really happy with this
group, first of all because of their
attitude and character, and then
secondly I think their team quick
ness is good," Keady said. "I think
the strength of this team is the
versatility of it. You've got a lot of
guys who can play a lot of differ
ent positions and I think that's
our biggest strength."
The 13 players who survived
the cut will be joined by four more
who were unable to attend the tri
als. The entire 17-man squad will
reassemble on July 15 for training
camp at Purdue. Five of them will
be cut, paring the squad to its 12-
man limit, by the time the Pan Am
Games start in Havana on August
3.
Keefe, however, might not
make it to the camp, because he
only has until May 12 to decide if
he wants to give up his college eli
gibility and enter the June NBA
draft. If he does so, the team that
selects him may try to discourage
him from playing in the Games for
fear of an injury.
"I need to think about it a little
more," said Keefe, who added he
has yet to make a decision on
entering the draft.
Keefe set Stanford records for
points per game (21.5), field goals
(252), points (711), free throws
(203) and minutes played (1,204).
The 6-foot-9 junior, who made the
all-Pacific 10 Conference team for
the second straight year, is Stan
ford's fifth all-time leading scorer
(1,585 points) and rebounder
(764).
Keefe played out of position at
center for most of the 1991 season
— his natural position is power
forward — and, to his surprise,
was at center again during the tri
als.
"I was finally thinking I'd get
out away from the hoop, but they
had me in there against Elmore
Spencer (of UNLV), who's 7-foot
1, 450 pounds," Keefe said. "I was
also playing against (Eric) Mon
tross (of North Carolina) and
Mike Peplowski (from Michigan
State), who's about 6-11, 435.
"I had some success against
them; it made things a little diffi
cult for me, but I still did pretty
well."
The 17-man training-camp ros
ter includes three players from
NCAA champion Duke, including
6-foot-11 forward Christian Laet
tner, who was the NCAA tourna
ment MVP Laettner was one of
the four players to request and
receive a waiver to miss the trials

Freshman swingman Grant
Hill and sophomore guard
Thomas Hill are the other two
Blue Devils on the squad.
The only Pacific 10 Conference
player to join Keefe on the roster
was UCLA junior forward Tracy
Murray, best known for shooting
the ball anytime he's within 40
feet of the hoop. Only three other
players from west of the Missis
sippi made the roster: Spencer,
Pepperdine forward Doug
Christie, and forward Byron
Houston of Oklahoma State.
Rounding out the frontcourt
players are Montross, Peplowski,
6-9 forward Tom Gugliotta of
North Carolina State and 6-7
Clarence Weatherspoon of South
ern Miss.
The guards other than Hill are
Seton Hall's 6-4 Tony Dehere,
Ohio State's 6-6 Jimmy Jackson,
6-8 Walt Williams of Maryland
and the sleeper of the year, 6-0
point guard Anthony Bennett of
Wisconsin-Green Bay.
Notre Dame considers
Montgomery for job
ATLANTA (AP) - Bobby
Cremins took himself out of the
running for Notre Dame's vacant
basketball coaching job Monday,
deciding instead to remain at
Georgia Tech. Stanford's Mike
Montgomery is now considered to
be one of the leading candidates
to replace the departed Digger
Phelps.
Although he admitted that the
Irish job was tempting, Cremins
said, "My feeling for my players
and the Georgia Tech family and
friends was too strong for me to
pursue any other interests right
now.
"The next step was to go to
Notre Dame for an interview. I
decided not to do that. It might
