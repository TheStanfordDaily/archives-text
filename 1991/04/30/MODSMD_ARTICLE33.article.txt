# Teaching English: international adventure
## 
### Amy McConnell Staff writer 
Teaching English as a second language can
be an adventure. It can involve everything
from digging latrines in Hong Kong to attend
ing religious services at temples in Taiwan.
Now, it can also mean canoeing down
Czechoslovakian rivers and hiking through
mountains with native students.
Through the independent, Stanford-based
program Volunteers in Asia, students from
Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz have been teach
ing English in more than five Asian countries
for the past 27 years.
Following that program's example, a new
organization, Students for East European
Democracy, will send 30 Stanford students
this summer to teach English in Czechoslo
vakia.
The new group also sponsors special pro
jects, visits, symposia and lectures about East
ern Europe. Director Matt Eldridge, a senior,
said he hopes to turn the exchange program
into something as big as the one operated by
Volunteers in Asia, with posts in several East
European countries.
Volunteers in Asia sends undergraduate
and graduate students to China, Taiwan,
Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam for six months,
one year, or two years. A $600 to $1,200 fee
covers insurance, training and a 10-day orien
tation trip to Japan, where volunteers stay
with families for a few days and then visit a
Buddhist monastery.
Participants in the Students for East Euro
pean Democracy program will spend eight
weeks tutoring in Czechoslovakia while taking
part in several different activities with their
students. They will spend two weeks living
with students' families in Prague, where they
will attend cultural events and lead conversa
tion classes.
For another two weeks the volunteers will
tutor both formally and informally while hik
ing with their students. Volunteers will also
spend two weeks canoeing with the students.
For the final two weeks, each group will repeat
one of these two-week sections. Volunteers will
only be charged for food and airfare.
"It's a cutting edge, experiential approach,"
Eldridge said. "There will be no blackboards;
it's all practical."
The program's seed was sown when
Eldridge, a senior, visited Eastern Europe last

year. "Given the dramatic changes going on in
Czechoslovakia, I wondered if there was any
thing Stanford students could do to build bet
ter links with Eastern European students," he
said.
With the help of Volunteers in Asia founder
Dwight Clark, Eldridge created Students for
East European Democracy last spring,
recruited 61 applicants this fall and selected
30 students this spring to go to Czechoslovakia
this summer.
Eldridge said he thinks students are inter
ested in teaching in Czechoslovakia for several
reasons. "The dramatic political changes of
the last two years have focused attention on
Eastern and Central Europe," he said. "Volun
teer spirit and excitement about spending time
overseas" are probably also partly responsible
for the large number of applicants, he added.
Volunteers in Asia started in the summer of
1963, when a group of Stanford students went
to Hong Kong to dig latrines. Feeling that
their trip had been very worthwhile, they
organized more trips, and out of that the orga
nization was born, said Amy Sobel, who coor
dinates the volunteers who go to Indonesia.
Today, students of anthropology, political
science, human biology and even computer sci
ence teach English in Asia.
"Originally, I think it was the same motiva
tion that started the first people who went to
Hong Kong â€” wanting to expand your hori
zons away from strict academic settings,... to
learn another language, to learn another cul
ture ... to have an adventure," Sobel said.
"Now it's also seen as a career-building
thing to do. It's good to know Japanese or Chi
nese."
But teaching English isn't all fun and
games; it involves rigorous training. Volun
teers in both programs must take two classes
on teaching English as a second language.
Aside from its regular class meetings, "Intro
duction to Methods of Teaching English as a
Foreign Language" requires 10 hours of tutor
ing practice.
The other class, "Practicum in Teaching
English as a Foreign Language," requires stu
dents to observe and teach in a real classroom
twice a week.
"It's on-the-spot teaching," said Senior Lin
guistics Lecturer Beverley McChesney, who
teaches both classes. "I have students go to the
board . . . and I throw out a question for them
as if I were one of their students."

A typical first "on-the-spot" question is,
"What's the difference between 'make' and
'do'?" The questions get tougher toward the
end of the quarter, she said. "One final ques
tion I usually ask is, 'What does resent mean?'
I do that to show them that not everything can
be answered off the cuff."
McChesney said it is not necessary for par
ticipants to know the language of the country
they will teach in, although any preparation
helps.
In addition to these classes, Volunteers in
Asia students are required to attend four all
day training sessions and one weekend retreat
that consists of discussion and role-playing.
"Training gives us a look at different cus
toms and lifestyles we'll be seeing," said
sophomore Rob Baedeker, who will spend next
year teaching in Indonesia.
"In one exercise, they dressed one [partici
pant! as a typical Muslim woman," with every
thing but her face covered in cloth, Baedeker
said. "We all said she looked inhibited, conser
vative and repressed, but we found out that. .
. covering themselves with cloth makes women
feel more individual since they aren't then
looked at as sex symbols."
Past volunteers have plenty of experiences
to tell about. Sobel, who taught for two years
in Indonesia, had an embarrassing story. "In
Indonesia, people invite you to their homes all
the time, but they don't really mean it. It's like
saying, 'How are you?' I'd been warned about
that, but one time someone seemed so genuine
that I took them up on it and went to their
house, and it completely shocked them," she
said.
Training helps prevent such misunder
standings. "We outline problems volunteers
had in the past and ways to deal with them,"
Sobel said.
Another goal of training is "to have people
in the group get to know each other, to become
sources of support for each other," she said.
"It's training for the potholes of your experi
ence."
One of those potholes is sickness, especially
in Vietnam and Indonesia. "Some do get very
sick, but there are hospitals in all the major
cities."
Still, parents are often concerned at first.
"We have a flier for parents called, 'You want
to do what?' But my impression on the whole
is that parents are at least interested and
accepting if not supportive," Sobel said.

"In one exercise, they dressed one [partici
pant! as a typical Muslim woman," with every
thing but her face covered in cloth, Baedeker
said. "We all said she looked inhibited, conser
vative and repressed, but we found out that. .
. covering themselves with cloth makes women
feel more individual since they aren't then
looked at as sex symbols."
Past volunteers have plenty of experiences
to tell about. Sobel, who taught for two years
in Indonesia, had an embarrassing story. "In
Indonesia, people invite you to their homes all
the time, but they don't really mean it. It's like
saying, 'How are you?' I'd been warned about
that, but one time someone seemed so genuine
that I took them up on it and went to their
house, and it completely shocked them," she
said.
Training helps prevent such misunder
standings. "We outline problems volunteers
had in the past and ways to deal with them,"
Sobel said.
Another goal of training is "to have people
in the group get to know each other, to become
sources of support for each other," she said.
"It's training for the potholes of your experi
ence."
One of those potholes is sickness, especially
in Vietnam and Indonesia. "Some do get very
sick, but there are hospitals in all the major
cities."
Still, parents are often concerned at first.
"We have a flier for parents called, 'You want
to do what?' But my impression on the whole
is that parents are at least interested and
accepting if not supportive," Sobel said.
Teaching English as a second language can
be an adventure. It can involve everything
from digging latrines in Hong Kong to attend
ing religious services at temples in Taiwan.
Now, it can also mean canoeing down
Czechoslovakian rivers and hiking through
mountains with native students.
Through the independent, Stanford-based
program Volunteers in Asia, students from
Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz have been teach
ing English in more than five Asian countries
for the past 27 years.
Following that program's example, a new
organization, Students for East European
Democracy, will send 30 Stanford students
this summer to teach English in Czechoslo
vakia.
The new group also sponsors special pro
jects, visits, symposia and lectures about East
ern Europe. Director Matt Eldridge, a senior,
said he hopes to turn the exchange program
into something as big as the one operated by
Volunteers in Asia, with posts in several East
European countries.
Volunteers in Asia sends undergraduate
and graduate students to China, Taiwan,
Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam for six months,
one year, or two years. A $600 to $1,200 fee
covers insurance, training and a 10-day orien
tation trip to Japan, where volunteers stay
with families for a few days and then visit a
Buddhist monastery.
Participants in the Students for East Euro
pean Democracy program will spend eight
weeks tutoring in Czechoslovakia while taking
part in several different activities with their
students. They will spend two weeks living
with students' families in Prague, where they
will attend cultural events and lead conversa
tion classes.
For another two weeks the volunteers will
tutor both formally and informally while hik
ing with their students. Volunteers will also
spend two weeks canoeing with the students.
For the final two weeks, each group will repeat
one of these two-week sections. Volunteers will
only be charged for food and airfare.
"It's a cutting edge, experiential approach,"
Eldridge said. "There will be no blackboards;
it's all practical."
The program's seed was sown when
Eldridge, a senior, visited Eastern Europe last

year. "Given the dramatic changes going on in
Czechoslovakia, I wondered if there was any
thing Stanford students could do to build bet
ter links with Eastern European students," he
said.
With the help of Volunteers in Asia founder
Dwight Clark, Eldridge created Students for
East European Democracy last spring,
recruited 61 applicants this fall and selected
30 students this spring to go to Czechoslovakia
this summer.
Eldridge said he thinks students are inter
ested in teaching in Czechoslovakia for several
reasons. "The dramatic political changes of
the last two years have focused attention on
Eastern and Central Europe," he said. "Volun
teer spirit and excitement about spending time
overseas" are probably also partly responsible
for the large number of applicants, he added.
Volunteers in Asia started in the summer of
1963, when a group of Stanford students went
to Hong Kong to dig latrines. Feeling that
their trip had been very worthwhile, they
organized more trips, and out of that the orga
nization was born, said Amy Sobel, who coor
dinates the volunteers who go to Indonesia.
Today, students of anthropology, political
science, human biology and even computer sci
ence teach English in Asia.
"Originally, I think it was the same motiva
tion that started the first people who went to
Hong Kong â€” wanting to expand your hori
zons away from strict academic settings,... to
learn another language, to learn another cul
ture ... to have an adventure," Sobel said.
"Now it's also seen as a career-building
thing to do. It's good to know Japanese or Chi
nese."
But teaching English isn't all fun and
games; it involves rigorous training. Volun
teers in both programs must take two classes
on teaching English as a second language.
Aside from its regular class meetings, "Intro
duction to Methods of Teaching English as a
Foreign Language" requires 10 hours of tutor
ing practice.
The other class, "Practicum in Teaching
English as a Foreign Language," requires stu
dents to observe and teach in a real classroom
twice a week.
"It's on-the-spot teaching," said Senior Lin
guistics Lecturer Beverley McChesney, who
teaches both classes. "I have students go to the
board . . . and I throw out a question for them
as if I were one of their students."

A typical first "on-the-spot" question is,
"What's the difference between 'make' and
'do'?" The questions get tougher toward the
end of the quarter, she said. "One final ques
tion I usually ask is, 'What does resent mean?'
I do that to show them that not everything can
be answered off the cuff."
McChesney said it is not necessary for par
ticipants to know the language of the country
they will teach in, although any preparation
helps.
In addition to these classes, Volunteers in
Asia students are required to attend four all
day training sessions and one weekend retreat
that consists of discussion and role-playing.
"Training gives us a look at different cus
toms and lifestyles we'll be seeing," said
sophomore Rob Baedeker, who will spend next
year teaching in Indonesia.
"In one exercise, they dressed one [partici
pant! as a typical Muslim woman," with every
