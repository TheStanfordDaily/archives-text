# Kimball lays foundation for four-year guaranteed housing
## 
### Tammy Watts Staff writer 
As the Draw approaches, many
Stanford students are thankful
that next year's housing options
will feature a new four-class dor
mitory — and fewer trailers in
Manzanita park.
To a Stanford student, espe
cially one who has spent any
length of time in the trailers or
searching for an affordable off
campus residence, it may be obvi
ous that the new undergraduate
housing is long overdue.
But what would motivate an
alumnus, someone with no fear of
ever living in the trailers or being
denied on-cairrpus housing, to
donate $3 million toward a new
undergraduate residence?
According to William Kimball,
the principal donor for Kimball
Hall, the answer is simple. As an
undergraduate in the late 1930s
and early 19405, he was assured
housing for all four years. He
wants current students to have
the same opportunity.
Kimball also said that residen

tial education was one of the most
important aspects of his under
graduate education and that he
wouldn't have traded that experi
ence for anything.
The desire to help give students
these opportunities motivated
Kimball to give to the Centennial
Campaign to improve undergrad
uate housing. Kimball is currently
co-chair of the campaign.
He said that when he and his
wife Sara don their hard hats to
walk through the new dormitory,
which is still under construction,
they get a "warm fuzzy feeling
inside."
He added that he looks forward
to seeing the dorm finished and
brought to life by its first resi
dents next year. Calling all Stan
ford students outstanding people,
Kimball said he hopes to have the
opportunity to meet some of the
new residents in the fall.
Although most students may
recognize Kimball's name only
because of the new residence, he
has contributed to the Stanford
community in many ways during
the past 50 years.

Now the president and owner
of Kimball and Company, a diver
sified operations and investments
company, Kimball graduated from
Stanford in 1941 with a bachelor's
degree in economics. As an under
graduate he was involved in fra
ternity life, ROTC, the Axe Com
mittee and the now-defunct rally
committee, which promoted spirit
at athletic events.
He also founded a small busi
ness to provide student residences
and campus hangouts with cool
ers where students could pur
chase Cokes — the forerunner of
the modern soda machines.
When asked to discuss what
was best about his undergraduate
education, Kimball said he is glad
that Stanford allowed him to
"take a broader brush" to his edu
cation and experience a variety of
academic disciplines and extracur
ricular activities.
His advice to today's Stanford
undergraduate is: "The broader
you can be in your academic
courses the better, because once
you get a job you tend to special
ize. Now's the time to get a
broader experience — especially at
a place like Stanford."
Kimball's post-graduate
involvement with the Stanford

community began almost immedi
ately after he returned from serv
ing in World War 11. He attributes
his motivation to his desire to give
back to a place that he feels has
given him so much.
Beginning as a volunteer fund
raiser among Stanford alumni liv
ing in Marin County, he has gone
on to be the president of Board of
Trustees and a member of the

Hoover Institution's Board of
Overseers. His contributions have
been recognized over the years
with many awards for outstand
ing service to Stanford.
Kimball said he finds this vol
unteer work both exciting and
rewarding. In his eyes, there is
"just no substitute for a good edu
cation." This conviction extends
beyond his involvement in Stan

ford to the work he and his wife do
on behalf of her alma mater, Ore
gon State University, and local
San Francisco public schools.
Even when his involvement
with Centennial Campaign ends,
he knows that his involvement
with the Stanford community will
continue into the future, he said.
"I call it giving it back," Kim
ball said.
