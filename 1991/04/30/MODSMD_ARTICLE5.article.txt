The student who asked Stuart Reges
about the use of the drug MDA told The
Daily yesterday that he thought the lec
turer's advice was an expression of free
speech, not conduct.
Reges, a computer science senior lec
turer, was placed on paid administrative
leave last week pending an investigation
of claims that he openly carried illegal
drugs on campus and broke University
drug rules in protest of U.S. drug policy.
However, the issue that has grabbed
the largest share of national attention
was Reges's advice to the student that
he try MDA. Reges admitted the inci
dent in a letter to national drug czar
Bob Martinez. The student, who asked
not to be identified, said he decided not
to take the drug.

Campus administrators such as Uni

leave and is conducting the investiga

advice was punishable conduct, not pro

Reges, saying, "I thought it was just free
speech."
In addition, the situation could hap

the student said.
He added that he and Reges were
waiting at the San Francisco Interna
tional Airport's 7-F bus stop to return to
Stanford after Thanksgiving break. The
student, who said he had positive expe
riences with marijuana and LSD in the
past, had also had Reges as an instruc
tor.

The student said he "had an interest"
in talking to Reges after reading two let
ters Reges sent to The Daily in Novem
ber. In the letters, Reges discussed his
experience with MDA, an amphetamine
derived hallucinogen.
"I asked if I could have his opinion on
MDA," the student said. "We started
talking about our past drug history and
what we learned as a result."
He said Reges told him about his own
experiences and the patterns of addic
tion for other drugs. He described the
meeting as a "personal conversation"
which covered the pros and cons of MDA
use. Reges "didn't offer me MDA," he
added.
"I'm surprised advocacy has gener
