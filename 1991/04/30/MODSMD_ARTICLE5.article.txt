# Student claims Reges' advice to him constituted free speech
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The student who asked Stuart Reges
about the use of the drug MDA told The
Daily yesterday that he thought the lec
turer's advice was an expression of free
speech, not conduct.
Reges, a computer science senior lec
turer, was placed on paid administrative
leave last week pending an investigation
of claims that he openly carried illegal
drugs on campus and broke University
drug rules in protest of U.S. drug policy.
However, the issue that has grabbed
the largest share of national attention
was Reges's advice to the student that
he try MDA. Reges admitted the inci
dent in a letter to national drug czar
Bob Martinez. The student, who asked
not to be identified, said he decided not
to take the drug.

Campus administrators such as Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
Assoc. Dean of the School of Engineer
ing Ken Down, who placed Reges on
leave and is conducting the investiga
tion, have said they believe Reges'
advice was punishable conduct, not pro
tected free speech.
However, the student defended
Reges, saying, "I thought it was just free
speech."
In addition, the situation could hap
pen to any student or faculty member,
the student said.
He added that he and Reges were
waiting at the San Francisco Interna
tional Airport's 7-F bus stop to return to
Stanford after Thanksgiving break. The
student, who said he had positive expe
riences with marijuana and LSD in the
past, had also had Reges as an instruc
tor.

The student said he "had an interest"
in talking to Reges after reading two let
ters Reges sent to The Daily in Novem
ber. In the letters, Reges discussed his
experience with MDA, an amphetamine
derived hallucinogen.
"I asked if I could have his opinion on
MDA," the student said. "We started
talking about our past drug history and
what we learned as a result."
He said Reges told him about his own
experiences and the patterns of addic
tion for other drugs. He described the
meeting as a "personal conversation"
which covered the pros and cons of MDA
use. Reges "didn't offer me MDA," he
added.
"I'm surprised advocacy has gener
ated this much controversy," the stu
dent said, adding that this situation is
the element of the entire contro
versy that is "most clearly" a mat
ter of free speech, not conduct.
Reges gave an honest opinion,
the student said. "It's important
for faculty to feel they can discuss
things openly with students," he
added. He expressed concern that
if Reges is fired, it might "make
other students wary of approach
ing faculty on other issues" and
would create a distinct "barrier
between students and faculty"
MDA, or methylenedioxy
amphetamine, was outlawed in
the 19605. Nicknamed "the love
drug," it generates extreme

euphoria and a sense of liking
everyone. In medical circles it is
classified — along with LSD and
peyote — as a psychotomimetic
drug, because it mimics the
effects of psychosis.
Physiologically, these drugs act
as mild stimulants of the nervous
system and are not habit-form
ing. Researchers are unsure
whether MDA is psychologically
addictive.
According to Dr. John Dorman
of Cowell Student Health Center,
MDA users "are not something
we see much of" at Stanford.
Some members of the media
have confused MDA with Ecstasy,
an MDA-derivative which was
invented in laboratories in the
1970s and outlawed in 1985. It is
a combination of a synthetic

mescaline — a hallucinogen
obtained from the mescal plant —
and an amphetamine.
Ecstasy has become a
"designer drug" popular with
upper-class whites. According to
Dr. Dorman, research on Ecstasy
has shown that users can die —
although rarely — if they suffer
from some form of heart disease.
Pharmacologists from both
universities and law-enforcement
agencies warn that Ecstasy is psy
chologically addictive and can
cause long-term damage.
A 1988 student survey showed
that one-third of Stanford stu
dents had tried Ecstasy, but Dor
man said that doctors at Cowell
did not take the results too seri
ously because of the survey's
"irregular interviewing tech
niques."
