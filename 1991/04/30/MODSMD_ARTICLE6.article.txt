# Faculty react to Bush's school plan
## Education profs, welcome, worry about proposed reforms 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
As President Bush promotes his plan
to reform the U.S. school system, some
Stanford professors say they welcome
many of the proposals but are worried
about their effectiveness.
In an announcement two weeks ago,
Bush unveiled a proposal to change sev
eral aspects of the educational system.
According to a White House statement,
major points of the plan include nation
wide exams in five subjects for elemen
tary and high-school students, merit
pay for teachers who work in challeng
ing situations, financial incentives for
school districts to offer more school
choices and a plan to create 535 model

schools across the country.
The model schools are designed to be
showcases for the new policy and test
new educational practices.
Michael Kirst, professor in the
School of Education, was a guest at the
formal White House presentation of
Bush's new plan, attended by leaders in
education as well as by members of
Congress. He described the program as
containing "a lot of exciting proposals"
which reflect healthy creativity
However, Kirst said that what he sees
as one of the most important proposals
— nationwide exams — has been largely
overlooked by the press. Kirst welcomed
the tests, which, if adopted widely, will
affect both teaching and college-admis
sions policies, he said.

Kirst described the tests as similar to
the current College Board achievement
tests. Each will test what a student has
learned in a specific subject, he
explained. The exams will be different
than the SAT, which measures general
knowledge in reading and mathematics.
The new exams will test more specific
areas — English, mathematics, science,
history and geography.
Bush is setting precedent in support
ing a system of national exams, Kirst
said, as no president has ever endorsed
such a system. However, Kirst criticized
the plan because there has been no par
allel move to increase teacher capacity
to instruct students in specific areas.
Kirst also noted the small role
the federal government plays in
the schools. "Currently the fed
eral government contributes
about six cents to every educa
tional dollar, and it has never con
tributed more than nine cents"
for every educational dollar, he
said. The remaining money is
paid by state and local govern
ments.
Most federal money is focused
on programs for specific target
groups, such as handicapped stu
dents, he said.
"The plan is not one to bailout
schools in financial trouble,"
Kirst said. "People are looking at
this plan and asking what it can
io for Richmond on Tuesdav

morning," he said in reference to
the impoverished East Bay school
district.
Kirst also said he worries that
new ideas may never get beyond
the demonstration stage in the
model schools. Kirst cited experi
mental programs conducted in
the 1970s that never resulted in
application to teaching practices.
"There were no residual benefits"
of those programs, he said, and a
similar risk exists with the
demonstration in the new model
schools.
Political Science Professor
Terry Moe, author of a book on
school choice opportunities and
the politics of education, echoed
Kirst's observations. He said, "I
think we need to have realistic
expectations" about the plan.
Although the federal government
has the right to make suggestions
in educational policv, the "pri-

Mary authority |to make educa
tion decisions] rests with the
states," he added.
Moe explained that if Bush
tried to make sweeping changes
within the education system, he
would see political opposition
from proponents of the status
quo, including district superin
tendents, state education admin
istrators and others. However,
Moe said the plan is "politically
feasible."
But Moe described the plan to
open 535 model schools as "a clas
sic pork-barrel project." Since
each congressional district will
receive one school with an addi
tional two schools per state, he
said this was similar to buying off
senators and representatives.
"Everyone gets a million bucks,"
he said, meaning that each dis
trict will receive an investment of
$1 million.
