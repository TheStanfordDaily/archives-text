# Faculty react to Bush's school plan
## Education profs, welcome, worry about proposed reforms 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
As President Bush promotes his plan
to reform the U.S. school system, some
Stanford professors say they welcome
many of the proposals but are worried
about their effectiveness.
In an announcement two weeks ago,
Bush unveiled a proposal to change sev
eral aspects of the educational system.
According to a White House statement,
major points of the plan include nation
wide exams in five subjects for elemen
tary and high-school students, merit
pay for teachers who work in challeng
ing situations, financial incentives for
school districts to offer more school
choices and a plan to create 535 model

schools across the country.
The model schools are designed to be
showcases for the new policy and test
new educational practices.
Michael Kirst, professor in the
School of Education, was a guest at the
formal White House presentation of
Bush's new plan, attended by leaders in
education as well as by members of
Congress. He described the program as
containing "a lot of exciting proposals"
which reflect healthy creativity
However, Kirst said that what he sees
as one of the most important proposals
— nationwide exams — has been largely
overlooked by the press. Kirst welcomed
the tests, which, if adopted widely, will
affect both teaching and college-admis
sions policies, he said.

Kirst described the tests as similar to
the current College Board achievement
tests. Each will test what a student has
learned in a specific subject, he
explained. The exams will be different
than the SAT, which measures general
knowledge in reading and mathematics.
The new exams will test more specific
areas — English, mathematics, science,
history and geography.
Bush is setting precedent in support
ing a system of national exams, Kirst
said, as no president has ever endorsed
such a system. However, Kirst criticized
the plan because there has been no par
allel move to increase teacher capacity
to instruct students in specific areas.
