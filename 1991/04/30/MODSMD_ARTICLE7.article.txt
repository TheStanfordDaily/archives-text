# Speaker addresses oppression
## 
### Jean Lu 
As the keynote speaker of the
ongoing Bisexual, Gay and Les
bian Awareness Days, June Jor
dan yesterday discussed the pet
tiness of discrimination on the
basis of sexual identity.
Addressing a moderate-sized
crowd at Kresge Auditorium,
the noted poet and professor of
women's studies at UC-Berke
ley compared anti-gay senti
ments to racist and sexist ide
ologies.
Jordan began the program by
reciting a selection of her own
poems addressing the topic of
oppression. One poem, titled
"War and Remembrance,"
depicts the inequality of a male
dominated world where women
are often intimidated by their
own husbands. The poem com

pares domestic violence and the
battering of women to the trail
of blood left by women who died
on forced marches at the hands
of Nazi soldiers.
Another poem, "Case in
Point," deals with the rape of a
woman and its aftermath as dis
tinguished by the "silence pecu
liar to the female." Other poems

touched on Vietnam and the
United States' self-imposed
mandate to spread democracy.
She said oppression —
whether it be male suppression
of females, white suppression of
blacks or heterosexual suppres
sion of gays and lesbians — is
still a problem. Society, she said
— not gay, lesbian or bisexual
individuals — "has a problem."
By limiting individual discre
tion on sexual orientation, soci
ety oppresses gays and lesbians
by making them conform to
arbitrary standards of "nor
malcy," Jordan said. The clos
eted gay or lesbian person afraid
of coming out is like a slave
"chained by social taboos," she
added.


Al Green — Daily
June Jordan, poet and professor of women's studies at UC-Berkeley, discusses discrimination on
the basis of sexual identity yesterday at Kresge Auditorium.

Jordan said, like racial identity,
sexual identity cannot be denied
for the convenience of society.
Just as ethnic minorities are not
expected to assimilate and
become white, she asked, why
should gays be expected to assim
ilate or die? On the contrary, Jor
dan said, "You can only survive if
you — who you really are — sur
vives."
Jordan also said gays, lesbians
and bisexuals need to demand
more respect and understanding.

They need to be appreciated for
their personality and talents, and
they need to be more vocal about
their plight, she added.
Finally, Jordan discussed the
implications of bisexuality. She
equated bisexuality with multi
culturalism and interracial rela
tionships. While bisexuality may
not be accepted, bisexuals should
be approached with understand
ing, she said.
Jordan defined bisexuality
with this statement: "I am free
and I am as likely to want or love
a woman as I am likely to want or
love a man, and what about
that?"

She ended her lecture as she
began it, with the recitation of
two more poems. These dealt
specifically with same-sex feel
ings. A prevalent theme was the
despair gays and lesbians feel in
having to reject who they are
because of prevailing societal
norms.
The last poem, however, ended
on a note of optimism, suggest
ing that homosexuals will not be
oppressed for much longer. A
part of that poem reads, "Wrong
is not my name, my name is my
own. . . ."
Following the lecture, Jordan
answered questions from the
audience.
