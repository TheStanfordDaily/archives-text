# Speaker addresses oppression
## 
### Jean Lu 
As the keynote speaker of the
ongoing Bisexual, Gay and Les
bian Awareness Days, June Jor
dan yesterday discussed the pet
tiness of discrimination on the
basis of sexual identity.
Addressing a moderate-sized
crowd at Kresge Auditorium,
the noted poet and professor of
women's studies at UC-Berke
ley compared anti-gay senti
ments to racist and sexist ide
ologies.
Jordan began the program by
reciting a selection of her own
poems addressing the topic of
oppression. One poem, titled
"War and Remembrance,"
depicts the inequality of a male
dominated world where women
are often intimidated by their
own husbands. The poem com

pares domestic violence and the
battering of women to the trail
of blood left by women who died
on forced marches at the hands
of Nazi soldiers.
Another poem, "Case in
Point," deals with the rape of a
woman and its aftermath as dis
tinguished by the "silence pecu
liar to the female." Other poems

touched on Vietnam and the
United States' self-imposed
mandate to spread democracy.
She said oppression —
whether it be male suppression
of females, white suppression of
blacks or heterosexual suppres
sion of gays and lesbians — is
still a problem. Society, she said
— not gay, lesbian or bisexual
individuals — "has a problem."
By limiting individual discre
tion on sexual orientation, soci
ety oppresses gays and lesbians
by making them conform to
arbitrary standards of "nor
malcy," Jordan said. The clos
eted gay or lesbian person afraid
of coming out is like a slave
"chained by social taboos," she
added.
