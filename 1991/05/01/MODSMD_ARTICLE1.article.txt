# Sex on the rise
## 10 percent more students are active than in '86, but many use unsafe practices

Although Stanford students may often be con
sidered intelligent adults, a recent survey shows
"There is no correlation between intelligence and
safer sex practices," said Cowell Health Promo
tion Program Director Patricia Fabiano.
In the survey, run by Cowell Student Health
Center, 74 percent of respondents who had vagi
nal intercourse and 66 percent who had anal
intercourse admitted that they do not always use
condoms correctly or consistently in order to pre
vent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.
The Cowell survey results include 1,250
responses to questionnaires mailed to students
last May. The survey asked students about a vari
ety of topics, from sexual practices to psychologi
cal well-being to alcohol use.
According to the results, the portion of stu
dents who said they are sexually active increased
from 66 percent to 76 percent between 1986 and
1990. Of the sexually active respondents, 95 per
cent reported activity with the opposite sex. Five
percent said they are active with "same sex only
or mostly" and "with both sexes equally."
Only 30 percent of students had been tested or
were planning to be tested for the HIV antibody.
About half of the respondents said they changed
their sexual behavior pattern due to the threat of
AIDS.
Fabiano said she believes that most Stanford
students are aware of the consequences of unsafe
sex, but that is not enough to change their sexual
behavior.
"Most students do not think anything detri
mental will happen to them, and there is a lot of
denial," Fabiano said.
"Information is not sufficient cause for change.
Innovative paths are required to alter the actions
of sexually active students. More programs such
as the Safer Sex Shoppe . . . are needed," she
added.
Current campus programs that address issues
of sexual activity include Cowell's Project SAVE
