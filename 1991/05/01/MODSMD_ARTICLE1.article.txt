# Sex on the rise
## 10 percent more students are active than in '86, but many use unsafe practices

Although Stanford students may often be con
sidered intelligent adults, a recent survey shows
"There is no correlation between intelligence and
safer sex practices," said Cowell Health Promo
tion Program Director Patricia Fabiano.
In the survey, run by Cowell Student Health
Center, 74 percent of respondents who had vagi
nal intercourse and 66 percent who had anal
intercourse admitted that they do not always use
condoms correctly or consistently in order to pre
vent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.
The Cowell survey results include 1,250
responses to questionnaires mailed to students
last May. The survey asked students about a vari
ety of topics, from sexual practices to psychologi
cal well-being to alcohol use.
According to the results, the portion of stu
dents who said they are sexually active increased
from 66 percent to 76 percent between 1986 and
1990. Of the sexually active respondents, 95 per
cent reported activity with the opposite sex. Five
percent said they are active with "same sex only
or mostly" and "with both sexes equally."
Only 30 percent of students had been tested or
were planning to be tested for the HIV antibody.
About half of the respondents said they changed
their sexual behavior pattern due to the threat of
AIDS.
Fabiano said she believes that most Stanford
students are aware of the consequences of unsafe
sex, but that is not enough to change their sexual
behavior.
"Most students do not think anything detri
mental will happen to them, and there is a lot of
denial," Fabiano said.
"Information is not sufficient cause for change.
Innovative paths are required to alter the actions
of sexually active students. More programs such
as the Safer Sex Shoppe . . . are needed," she
added.
Current campus programs that address issues
of sexual activity include Cowell's Project SAVE


Doug Davis Daily
(Stanford AIDS Volunteer Educators) and
the Contraceptive Information Center. The
center is run by student volunteers and
services about 500 students per quarter
with contraceptives and information, said
co-director Raquel Stote.
Because the programs depend on stu
dent volunteers, they are "not consistent"
enough to reach large amounts of people,
Fabiano said. "It depends on student
energy. Cowell cannot consistently [give
outl all information," she added.
The Cowell survey also gauged alcohol
consumption at Stanford, reporting that
drinking is more common among under
graduates and men than graduate students
and women.
Fifty-one percent of undergraduate men
reported drinking, compared to 31 percent
of undergraduate women. Thirty-six per
cent indicated that they had driven while
intoxicated or been in a car with an intoxi
cated driver.
"I think we have been successful in mak
ing students aware of the risks involved
with intoxication," said Louise Miller, coor
dinator of Cowell's Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Community
program.
The student-run project holds seminars
every year on alcoholic management,

social-host training and event-planning.
The programs are directed towards frater
nities, sororities and freshmen.
Other survey results include:
• Fifty percent of women surveyed
reported experiencing stress at Stanford
compared to only 14 percent of undergrad
uate men and 10 percent of graduate men.
Fabiano said this discrepancy might indi
cate that women take on more responsibil
ity.
• Seventy-four percent of undergradu
ate women and 70 percent of graduate
women said they want to lose weight. Only
35 percent of male undergraduates and 37
percent of male graduates expressed the
same desire.
• Although 95 percent of the respon
dents are within 10 pounds of normal
weight for their height and frame, only
one-third said they felt that their weight
was acceptable.
• Three out of 10 students reported
experiencing additional stress at Stanford
because of their ethnic background.
• Seventy-six percent of the respondents
reported wearing seat belts.
• Fewer than 3 percent use marijuana
once a month or more, and fewer than 2
percent smoke cigarettes daily.
• More women than men feel lonely at
Stanford. Nearly half of the international
male students said they are lonely often or
always.
• Sixty-four percent of the respondents
said they often or always feel energetic.
