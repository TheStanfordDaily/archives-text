South Koreans take to the streets
to demand presidents ouster
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Tens of thou
sands of students and workers demonstrated
nationwide yesterday for a second straight day,
protesting the fatal police beating of a student
and demanding President Roll Tae-woo's
ouster.
The escalating unrest posed what may be
the strongest challenge yet to Roh's rule. Oppo
sition parties said the demonstrations could
intensify if the president balks at political and
economic reforms.
In front-page headlines, Korean-language
newspapers pointed to increasing strife as dis
sidents, students and radical workers joined
forces. Dissidents said in the coming month
they would step up their campaign to oust Roh,
contending his administration has lost the con
fidence of the people.
Fed lowers two key interest rates
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal
Reserve today lowered two key interest rates in
a manner that emphasized the central bank's
resolve to fight a deepening U.S. recession.
The central bank first announced that it was
cutting the discount rate, the interest it
charges to make loans to commercial banks,
from 6 percent to 5.5 percent.
In a second easing step later in the day, the
Fed added reserves to the banking system as a
way of pushing the federal funds rate down to a
target of 5.75 percent. The funds rate, the
interest banks charge each other for loans, had
been at 6 percent.
Moves to reduce credit in such a dramatic
way normally result in corresponding reduc
tions in a variety of consumer and business
loans.
Budget constraints delay SI)I
WASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesale cuts in
the budget for the Strategic Defense Initiative
forced the Pentagon to push back its schedule
for the program by at least two years, a SDI
official said yesterday.
The top-level official, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, said the delay was the result
of the $1.8 billion cut in the Bush administra
tion's $4.7 billion request for strategic defense,
better known as Star Wars, in the current fiscal
year.
Congress made the reduction for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1 as part of the defense
budget, which President Bush later approved.
