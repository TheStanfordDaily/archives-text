# Talks begin on future of Northern Ireland

### 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AD
— Leaders began discussing the politi
cal future of Northern Ireland yester
day, and Britain's top official said it
was "a good day" for the province.
"It is good to have got the thing
moving, and I hope we will continue in
the same vein," Peter Brooke told
reporters.
Brooke had spent 15 months coax
ing the parties to the table for talks
about restoring u measure of self-gov
ernment in the province, which has
been directly ruled from London since
1972.
He met for 90 minutes yesterday
morning with leaders of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP),
which is supported by most of North
ern Ireland's Roman Catholics. Lead
ers of the non-sectarian Alliance party
called on Brooke in the afternoon.
Officials gave no details of the talks.
"You all know what the meeting was
about, setting the machinery for (he
agenda for the talks," said John Hume,
leader of the SDLP "It's not fair to ask

us to add to that."
Brooke will meet with Protestant
leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party
and the Democratic Unionist Party
(DUP) on Friday. All-party talks, the
first since the 19705, are expected to
begin next week, and the Irish govern
ment is expected to join at a later stage.
Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
was excluded from the talks because of
its support for violence.
As Hume entered the parliament
building yesterday morning a single
Protestant protester, Cedric Wilson,
shouted at him: "Ulster is British —
that is the message for you! No surren
der to Dublin rule."
The discordant note was a reminder
the negotiators are taking on issues
that underlie the violence and more
than 2,800 killings in Northern Ire
land since 1969.
One of the key decisions for Brooke
is the timing for Dublin's entry into
the talks; another is the deeply sym
bolic choice of where to meet.

The talks have three strands: rela
tions between the Northern Ireland
parties; their relations with Ireland;
and new relations between the British
and Irish governments.
Initially, it is expected that the par
ties will focus on relations within
Northern Ireland. One major issue is
"power-sharing," or a guaranteed role
for representatives of the Catholic
minority.
Catholic protests against gerryman
dering and discrimination in jobs and
housing under the old Northern Ire
land parliament led to violence in the
late 19605, and the parliament was
abolished in 1972.
A "power-sharing" administration
set up in 1974 collapsed after five
months in the face of unionist opposi
tion.
A Northern Ireland Assembly set up
in 1982 was hampered by boycotts
from both sides.
The parties agreed to negotiate
despite fundamental differences on
who should rule Northern Ireland.

The unionists support British rule,
while the SDLP aspires to Irish unity.
Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement
of 1985, the British and Irish govern
ments agreed that there would be no
change in sovereignty without the con
currence of a majority of the people in
Northern Ireland.
Protestant unionists are the major
ity in Northern Ireland, so in practical
terms Dublin accepted that there was
no immediate prospect of unifying the
island.
Unionists have said that progress in
the negotiations depends on the Irish
government's willingness to amend its
constitution, which lays claim to the
whole island.
Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry
Collins, who has been closely involved
in Brooke's consultations, has said he
is willing to discuss the issue.
However, a poll published last week
in the Irish Times of Dublin showed
that 58 percent wanted to retain the
controversial articles in the Constitu
tion.
