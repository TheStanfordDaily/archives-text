# Taiwan ends war provisions against China
## 
### 
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Wartime provi
sions enacted by Taiwan in 1948 against
China are to end today. President Lee Teng
hui announced.
Last week, Taiwan's National Assembly
voted to abrogate the provisions, enacted
four decades ago to suppress "the Commu
nist rebellion" on the mainland.
This had allowed the ruling Nationalists
to suspend certain constitutional rights and
justify emergency measures. The National
ists have ruled Taiwan since 1949, when
they fled mainland China after losing a civil
war to the Communists.
Lee said yesterday that reunification can
be achieved only if China demonstrates
good will, renounces its threat to use force
to regain Taiwan and stops isolating the
Nationalists in the international arena.
The Nationalists are now recognized by
28 countries, mostly smaller nations in
Africa and Latin America. China is recog
nized by 135.
Lee pledged the Nationalists would
never use force to try to achieve reunifica
tion.
"We deeply hope that the mainland
authorities will ... respond with sincerity

and concrete measures to our initiatives,"
he told a news conference.
Lee for the first time publicly used the
term "the mainland authorities" to describe
the Beijing government — tacitly acknowl
edging Communist rule over the Chinese
mainland.
The Nationalists began steps toward rec
onciliation with China in 1987 when Lee's
predecessor, Chiang Ching-kuo, approved
private visits between Taiwanese and Chi
nese and also sanctioned indirect trade
between the rival sides!
An estimated 2 million Taiwanese since
have visited China, and trade between Tai
wan and China totaled $4 billion last year.
Lee, the first native Taiwanese to head
the Nationalist government, has pushed
through other political reforms to remove
vestiges that remained from the National
ists' rule of the mainland.
This included the forced retirement of
aging conservative stalwarts of the Nation
alist Party who were elected in China four
decades ago and continued to hold their
seats to support the Nationalist claim to be
China's rightful ruler.
