Ending discrimination
deserves top priority
in Fac Sen debate

During the next few
weeks, the Faculty Senate
has an opportunity to take a
key step in alleviating institutional
discrimination against homosexu
als by extending spouse benefits to
include gay and lesbian couples.
Although the cost of such an exten
sion may be high, the senate must
pass the bill without delay in order
to maintain a consistent policy of
nondiscrimination.
California state law currently
prohibits gay and lesbian couples
from getting married, and the Uni
versity uses this discriminatory
law in determining which couples
are eligible to receive a wide range
of spouse benefits. Married faculty
and staff members receive medical
insurance plans, housing privi
leges, reduced tuition for children
attending Stanford and a variety of
other benefits.
Using marriage as the criteria
for eligibility is an administrative
convenience that saves the Univer
sity money, but such considera
tions cannot justify the inherent
discrimination in this policy. Until
state law permits same-sex mar
riages, the University must make
an exception for gay and lesbian
couples.
Opponents of such a change
claim that it is unrealistic to allo
cate more money to a program dur
ing a time of severe budget cuts.
Although the potential costs of
extending benefits will not be
known until the University Bene
fits Committee presents its report
in two weeks, the price is likely to
be high.
But this factor should not delay

a decision on the bill, even given
Stanford's financial problems.
Restructuring budgets is simply a
matter of assigning priorities to
different programs, and if a new
program is needed to alleviate a
blatantly discriminatory policy, it
should receive the highest priority,
even if older, more established pro
grams must be cut.
Others have criticized the bill
because it extends benefits only to
unmarried homosexual couples
and thus is unfair to unmarried
heterosexuals. However, this per
ceived inconsistency is justified if
one considers the true purpose of
the bill: to provide spousal benefits
to all couples who would marry
each other if they were permitted
to do so. Since there are no legal
barriers against heterosexual mar
riage, there is no need to extend
benefits to unmarried heterosexual
couples.
This brings up a third common
objection: There is a large potential
for abuse by homosexual couples
who falsely claim to have a mar
riage-like commitment in order to
receive benefits. In order to safe
guard against such abuse, the Uni
versity must establish some crite
ria for couples to meet in order to
receive benefits.
For example, couples might be
required to sign a legal document
codifying their commitment. The
University could also impose
strong penalties for fraud. Such
measures are not perfect but are
probably the best Stanford can do
until state law begins to treat het
erosexuals and homosexuals
equally.
The issue is a fundamental one.
Stanford has a clear, written policy
against discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation, and a long
history of upholding that policy.
Financial constraints should not
prevent Stanford from doing what
it can to right this social wrong.
