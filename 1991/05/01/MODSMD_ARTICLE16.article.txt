Fee requests provide big return on small investment

I WOULD BE WRITING continuously
if I wrote a letter to the editor for
every Daily column written by a
bloated, egocentric columnist. But I felt I
had to respond to the broad, unre
searched arguments brought up in Tim
Marklein's column on April 22, "The
Spring Giveaway."
Although I agree with Marklein's view
of the poorly organized election hand
book, I cannot agree with the rest of his
arguments. Marklein describes the typi
cal Stanford student as "a loser" in
terms of the money he or she shells out
for special fee requests. He claims that
while many student projects are worth
while, groups should obtain their own
funding.
To me, an extra $100 is insignificant
in relation to the $20,000 I put into the
University. And if $100 is all it costs to

support these groups, which in turn give
great programs and events to the Uni
versity, I see it as a shrewd investment.
Why not support these groups if we are
going to be able to enjoy the benefits
that they contribute?
For example, many of my friends and
I went to hear Cesar Chavez speak this
week. Why should MEChA have to sup
port the entire financial burden of bring
ing him when the knowledge and under
standing that Chavez brings will be felt
by a good part of the student body?
And what difference does it make if
MEChA's membership is "reportedly
under 20"? I feel that the things they do
for Stanford are invaluable as part of our
college experience.
Additionally, as director of SURE
Escort Service, I feel compelled to defend
our fee request. Some years ago, SURE

employees worked completely on a vol
unteer basis. Although our fee requests
at that time were considerably smaller,
the service was not consistent.
On any given night, there might have
been drivers on duty, but one could never
be sure. Sixty hours every quarter is a
big volunteer commitment to make,
especially when the service runs every
day until midnight.
The directors decided to start paying
escorts to make the service dependable.
To this day, I firmly believe that without
paying escorts, the service would not be
able to handle reliably 30-40 calls per
night.
As for Marklein's comment that most
of our money goes toward "large coordi
nator salaries," I put a significant
amount of time into the service and
make an insignificant amount above the

University minimum wage.
Finally, if Marklein truly believes that
student groups should go find their own
funding, why hasn't he mentioned
anything about The Daily's own special
fee request of almost $50,000? Would he
even have had a column if The Daily
didn't get its fee request?
Even though I do not like some parts
of The Daily, including Marklein's col
umn, I voted "yes" on The Daily's fee
request because I think The Daily is a
valuable resource for Stanford. For a tri
fling $100, I get many benefits from a
wide variety of outstanding student
organizations. In my eyes, I'll never find
a better deal.
