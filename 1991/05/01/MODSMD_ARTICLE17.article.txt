# University shouldn't dismiss exceptional teacher Reges
## 
### 
IT IS PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY that
most of us would hesitate before
defending someone whose views dif
fer radically from our own (especially
when those views concern an issue as
emotionally charged as drug abuse).
However, after reading about Stuart
Reges in the newspaper, I did not hesi
tate before writing this letter.
It is an unfortunate paradox that
exceptional researchers often lack the
time (and in some cases the desire) to be
exceptional educators. This fact makes
talented instructors a commodity that
Stanford cannot afford to squander. It is
my sincere belief that Reges is such an
instructor. He has the ability to excite
interest in the course material and
inspire students to try just a little
harder.
His lectures are an interactive experi
ence in which students are drawn to par

ticipate, either by answering questions
or by playing some role in his presenta
tion. Homework assignments are both
challenging and entertaining, and a visit
to his office becomes an enlightening
interchange between equals (as opposed
to one between a student and his profes
sor). Reges wants his students to learn
and is more than willing to help them
try. In other words, Reges is a teacher.
Let me reiterate that I do not agree
with Reges' beliefs regarding the use of
drugs; however, I could no more agree
with a University policy which dismisses
an excellent teacher for expressing those
beliefs. I admit that Reges' inflammatory
admissions are somewhat unconven
tional, but I also respect his steadfast
adherence to his beliefs.
Is it not the function of a University
to encourage debate? To question the
existing order? To look for the possibility

Talented instructors
are a commodity which
Stanford cannot afford
to squander. Stuart
Reges is such an
instructor.

of a better solution? If that is not the
case, then I am confused about the true
purpose of scholarly endeavors.
I was in the student section which
Reges took to dinner at Mac Arthur Park
Although Reges "looked the other way"
when underage students ordered drinks
from the waiter, he did not encourage or
endorse their behavior. Therefore, there

was no impropriety.
If Reges has violated a standing Uni
versity policy, then he must certainly
face disciplinary action under the cur
rent regulations. However, such action
should stop short of an outright dis
missal. I feel strongly that Reges' dis
missal would do the University more
harm than good.
I realize that such an arrangement
would require Reges to retreat from his
current vocal stance. I also realize that
Reges may not be inclined to do so.
Nonetheless, I hope Reges and the Uni
versity can resolve their differences
without his leaving the faculty. Other
wise, the University would stand to lose
something more valuable than any
amount of research funding: a teacher.
