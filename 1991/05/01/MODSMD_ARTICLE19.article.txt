## Me and the pickle man 
### 
STANDING IN THE NINE-ITEMS
or-Less line at Safeway, trapped
behind a woman with a month's pro
visions for a sizable army and a man with
13 jars of pickles, I was getting a little fid
gety.
Normally I wouldn't have minded
waiting, but it was three o'clock on a
Tuesday morning, and I needed sleep. I'd
been cajoled from a warm bed by a pair of
friends, who were now roving the aisles,
playing football with a roll of paper tow
els, and I was beginning to have serious
doubts about my decision to join them.
If nothing else, I wanted to get through
the line quickly and go out to the car to
soothe my vanity: I looked ridiculous. I'd
dressed in the dark, and it showed: My
sweats were holey, my socks were mis
matched and my T-shirt, three sizes too
small, threatened to reveal my bellybut
ton. My hair, meanwhile, shot out in all
directions, and my eyes felt crusty.
Accidentally dropping one of the free
doughnuts I'd grabbed from the bakery
counter didn't help my self-esteem any;
neither did stumbling on my untied laces
and falling to the floor when I bent to
retrieve it. As I sat there in a tangled heap
of doughnuts and grungy clothes, laugh
ing at myself and wondering why I'd ever
left my room, the man with the pickles
just stared.
I managed to stand by the time the
woman with the army rations finished
loading her bags, giving way to the pickle
man, but the little composure I gained by
this act was lost to the pickle man's con
tinuing stare.
As the cashier rang up jar after jar of

Vlassic dills, the man, stocky and 40ish,
with a trim beard and horn-rimmed
glasses, seemed more concerned with my
stability than with his transaction. He
looked me over from top to toe and turned
away only when the pickles had been
bagged and his change returned.
I stepped to the register and pulled
quarters from my sock to pay for the
apple I'd come all this way to buy, but the
man's stare had disconcerted me, and I
fumbled the quarters, sending them the
way of the doughnuts. The cashier
laughed, and so did 1.1 was making a com
plete fool of myself.
I had just managed to convince myself
that the humiliation could get no worse
when the pickle man came back to the
register, handed me $10 and said that it
looked like I could use the money
It was then that I first understood the
sting of charity.
The man was out the door before I
could say anything, before I could defend
myself, before I could say that he had it all
wrong. I looked around slowly, apprehen
sively, and saw that faces had changed. A
woman behind me in line nodded under-
the cashier had stopped
laughing and looked confused.
I wanted to shout at them, to tell them
I was perfectly normal and that they
could stop looking at me this way. But it
was hopeless; to their eyes, I was a lost
soul, and that meant pity and sadness.
I gave up and ran to the parking lot to
chase down my benefactor. The money
was his. He had earned it; he should have
it. His heart might have been in the right
place, but there was something terribly

wrong with the gesture.
I caught up to him at his silver Audi,
where he was gently lowering bags of
pickle jars into the trunk. He gave a slight
start at seeing me but held his ground,
and while I caught my breath he crossed
his arms over his thick chest and smiled,
as if awaiting thanks.
He laughed loudly when I told him I
was a Stanford student and clapped me
on the back. If I could only see how
pathetic I looked, he told me, I would
understand where he was coming from.
Anyhow, it was all over now, he said. He
insisted that I keep the money, seeing
how college is so expensive these days,
and it seemed pointless to refuse; he
wouldn't take no for an answer.
I recovered from my shame and spent
the money two days later at the Book
store, but not without a small sense that
I had done something wrong, that I was
somehow worth less than the person I
had taken the money from, and with a
glimpse at the far greater humbling of the
people we force to live that way every day.

Ed Heinemann wants Kofi and Andrew
to know the fan mail is pouring in after
last week's exchange and sends them
each a big, fat, wet, sloppy kiss to express
his gratitude.
