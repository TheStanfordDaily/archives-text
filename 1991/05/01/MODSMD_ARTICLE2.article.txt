# Sororities want joint judicial board
## 
### Robin Mathison Stall writer 
The Intersorority Council wants to
create a joint judicial board with the
Interfraternity Council in response to
increased concern about sororities' lia
bility for social events co-sponsored with
fraternities.
The IFC currently has its own judi
cial board, which was established last
fall to investigate alcohol-related viola
tions and sexual-harassment charges
and make recommendations to the Uni
versity about possible disciplinary
action.
The ISC wants to take a "more pro
active stance" regarding judicial mat
ters, said former ISC president Erin
Scalley, a junior who initiated the pro

posal before leaving office last week.
The IFC has not yet discussed the
issue, but IFC secretary Steve Jarrett
said the IFC might bring up the issue at
its regular meeting tonight. Jarrett said
a joint judicial board might take several
weeks to institute, since it took most of
fall quarter to establish the IFC's judi
cial board.
As proposed, the joint judicial board
would include the ISC and IFC vice
presidents, two elected representatives
from the ISC and four elected represen
tatives from the IFC. The board would
have more IFC representatives because
there are twice as many fraternities as
sororities.
A recent statement from the
National Panhellenic Council warned
sororities of the legal liability they face

when holding parties with fraternities
The document states, "co-sponsors ol
social events are potentially liable
regardless of how expenses are shared.'
Because sororities are equally
responsible, "they would also like to be
on the board that looks into liability
issues," said Adriana Duffy, newly
appointed ISC President.
The Panhellenic Council's statement
also opposed the misuse of alcohol, sup
ported federal, state and local laws and
prohibited chapter funds from being
used to purchase alcohol.
The ISC already requires each soror
ity to have an alcohol policy certified by
the Risk Reduction of Intoxicants in the
Stanford Community program. Each
policy must include procedures
for handling alcohol at social
events, such as checking identifi
cation and providing social moni
tors.
Since many issues that arise
concern sexual harassment,
Duffy said it is especially impor

tant that women are represented
on the judicial board.
"I'm pleased that women are
looking to join in those particular
discussions and decisions," said
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Allison
Sandy. "Most events that become
problems often involve women
somewhere down the line, and
their viewpoint is invaluable."
Sandy said the administration
would support a joint judicial
effort between fraternities and
sororities. The judicial board

would serve a useful purpose if it
could "manage or investigate, or
particularly solve or make deci
sions" regarding incidents with
out having to go to an administra
tive level, she said.
If an issue could not be
resolved thought the judicial
board alone, it could be analyzed
jointly with administration offi
cials or independently through
both channels, Sandy said. She
said she hoped there would be a
cooperative relationship.
