## Corey Davis Political correctness denies complexity inherent in all issues 
### 
THERE'S BEEN MUCH TALK
about political correctness lately;
everybody has something to say
about it. So before the the issue is worn
out and people move on to the next "hot"
topic, I'd like to add my two cents.
The problem with the debate is the
way political correctness has been
defined. Newsweek magazine, in its Dec.
24 issue titled "Thought Police," defines
political correctness as a "left-wing"
movement whose philosophical, political
and intellectual ideology is Marxist in ori
gin. According to Newsweek, the two
main tenets of political correctness are
the promotion of diversity and multicul
turalism and the rejection of hierarchy.
The PC position is "that a hostile envi
ronment for minorities abridges their
right to an equal education." As a result,
"PC represents the subordination of the
right to free speech to the guarantee of
equal protection under the law."
What Newsweek has done is to present
one possible form of political correctness.
People, like those at Newsweek, who
define political correctness as "left-wing"
have shaped the discourse of the debate in
such a way as to make it difficult to dis
cuss political correctness without equat
ing it with a "leftist" stance. In my opin
ion, people who align themselves with the
"right" can also be PC if they are express
ing views they don't believe in. 1 hus,

political correctness is not specific to one
movement. It doesn't mean the left; it
doesn't mean the right.
Political correctness means supporting
a political ideology you don't believe in,
supporting an ideology because it appears
to be "the thing to do." It is partly a self
confidence issue because PC thinkers suc
cumb to peer pressure by adopting lan
guage and codes of behavior they are
uncomfortable with. Most often political
correctness is motivated by cowardice or
guilt. However, people can also be forced
to be PC, and this is its greatest danger.
Critics assert that PC ("leftist") think
ing has become the dominant ideology on
college and university campuses. But,
ironically, the anti-PC movement has
itself become an orthodoxy, complete with
its own rhetoric. Critics of political cor
rectness have themselves become PC.
The anti-PC orthodoxy employs scare
tactics to make its point. In "Illiberal
Education," Dinesh D'Souza writes,
"Many students are unable to recognize
the scope of the revolution, because it is a
force larger than themselves, acting upon
them." The anti-PC paint political cor
rectness as an insidious evil that over
takes innocent victims, a sort of "invasion
of the body snatchers."
According to many critics, this "revo
lution" is being carried out by "activists,"
more specifically, "minority activists"

who coerce, intimidate and brainwash
their victims. PC thinkers are portrayed
as members of an irrational cult whose
sacrificial lamb is the white, heterosexual
male.
By using this type of rhetoric, the anti-
PC movement creates an aura of suspi
cion around those who support "leftist"
views, as well as those who advocate
diversifying universities and society in
general.
It is wrong to associate political cor
rectness with a belief in a particular point
of view, i.e., just a "leftist" point of view.
In doing so, it allows people to dismiss
important issues as merely propaganda.
It also seeks to stigmatize by labeling peo
ple with loaded terms such as "activist."
(Whether we're on the "right" or the
"left," we're all activists if we seek to
change or to maintain the system.) The
anti-PC movement fails to differentiate
the PC thinkers from individual thinkers
who may or may not be part of a political
movement.
Many individuals have come to believe
in and act in response to certain views
based on personal experience. For exam
ple, I am a black, gay man, and thus, I
support equal rights for blacks (and other
minority groups) and gays. I don't sup
port these ideas because it seems like the
PC thing to do, or because it is fashion
able. By supporting these ideas, I am

of view.'

affirming my existence and my right to be
recognized as a human being. Again, peo
ple are PC when they support political
ideas they don't really believe.
One of the most harmful things that
the PC and anti-PC movements have
done is to turn issues, such as diversity
and multiculturalism, into "either-or"
debates. They have established two
camps both of whose mottoes are: "You're
either with us or against us."
D'Souza makes a crucial point when he
writes, "The middle ground seems to
have disappeared as a consequence of ide
ological fracas and polarization." I agree
with D'Souza; the middle ground has dis
appeared. The polarization of the debates
has rendered those in the middle invisi
ble, or at least afraid to speak their mind.

By middle, I do not mean indecisive,
unclear or ambiguous. I mean complex.
The people who are in the middle are
those who do not buy into the "either-or"
philosophy, but acknowledge the complex
ity of an issue, the many-sidedness of a
debate and of their own lives.
For example, I support affirmative
action. But part of me is uncomfortable
with admission policies based on race.
Another part of me doesn't want to bite
the hand that feeds me, since I may have
benefited from affirmative action. I know
a lot of other black students feel the same
way but don't express their views because
they fear being labeled a "sell-out" or an
"Uncle Tom." By criticizing affirmative
action, blacks fear adding fuel to an
already blazing fire.
The "either-or" polarization of debates
negates the complexity of an issue. More
importantly, it negates the complexity of
individual experience. Eventually, most
people decide how they are going to act on
a particular issue. However, people
should acknowledge the complexity — the
diversity of values, opinions and beliefs —
of an issue and of one's own personal
experience. Only then can we begin to
tear down the PC and anti-PC orthodox
ies.
