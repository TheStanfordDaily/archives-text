## Anesthesia simulation benefits doctors 
### Craig Klugman 
Giving gas to surgical patients is no
laughing matter. To better prepare anesthe
siologists to deal with surgical problems,
Stanford doctors have created the Compre
hensive Anesthesia Simulation Environ
ment (CASE).
Imagine this scenario: An anesthesiolo
gist is placed in the middle of a surgical pro
cedure. Suddenly, an alarm goes off: The
patient isn't receiving oxygen. The anesthe
siologist gives orders; assistants and nurses
respond by looking for an oxygen tank. The
surgeon asks if the patient is all right; after
all, the surgery must continue. Everything is
real — doctors, nurses, equipment — but the
patient is a mannequin.
The surgeon is Dr. David Gabn, assistant
professor of anesthesia at the Medical
School. Gaba uses a microphone to control
the surgery while he talks to a medical stu
dent who manipulates the surgical equip
ment with a computer.
Gaba designed CASE with the help of gen
eral surgery intern Abe DeAnda. The system
was used by 13 community anesthesiologists
and teaching faculty during a recent training
session at the Palo Alto Veteran's Hospital.
Because serious anesthesia catastrophes
are rare, anesthesiologists have little prac
tice responding to them. However, anesthesi
ologists are expected to deal with any situa
tion that arises. The simulator gives them
the experience needed to deal with those
rare, but nonetheless dangerous, circum
stances, in harmless situations.

The simulator teaches resource manage
ment, as well as how to mobilize and utilize
the environment for patient care. But just as
importantly, participants learn that they are
only human and can make mistakes.
"You always have to be on your toes —
looking around and double checking —
because you might have missed something,"
Gaba said.
"I came away with the sense that next
time these people have to handle a crisis,
they will probably do a better job of it," said
Dr. Jeff Cooper, member of the Anesthesia
Patient Safety Foundation's executive com
mittee and biomedical engineer.
The simulation is probably better for
learning than a real crisis, Cooper said,
because after the procedure the participants
discuss what occurred. Each session is video
taped and viewed during a debriefing session
led by Dr. Frank Sarnquist, associate profes
sor of anesthesia at the Medical School. Dur
ing the session, participants discuss how
their performance could have been
improved. They also review a catalog assem
bled by Gaba and his colleagues that details
emergency situations and the best
responses.
During the simulation, participants hear
breathing sounds from the mannequin. The
computer sends information to a blood pres
sure cuff, as well as to a pulse oximeter, a
device that monitors blood oxygen content.
The anesthesiologist has control of oxygen
and drugs just as he or she would during a
real operation.
"It's very realistic," said one anesthesiol

ogist. "You could be anesthetizing a real
patient."
In one test run of the simulator, the
patient went into cardiac arrest and the par
ticipant did not take the proper action,
which would have been to request a defibril
lator — a device used to start the heart beat
ing. In these simulations, however, the
patient is rarely killed, in order that the par
ticipant be able to figure out the proper
action.
"Once the patient dies, there's not much
learning that takes place," Gaba said. The
participant will usually be given some help
or a clue.
The designers say that the heart simula
tor can be used alone to teach students how
the heart affects blood pressure, volume and
flow rate in patients with different cardiac
conditions.
The CASE simulator as a whole, however,
is too focused for general medical students,
Gaba said. He feels it will be used mostly for
anesthesia practitioners, interns and resi
dents.
The Anesthesia Patient Safety Founda
tion, which provided funding for the project,
recently toured the simulator. According to a
letter Gaba received, they were impressed.
Gaba and the foundation plan to further
develop the simulator and to use it on a
national scale.
"If you had to sum up what it teaches in
one word, I suppose it would be humility,"
Gaba said. "Just because you're good and
have been doing it for a long time doesn't
mean problems can't happen to you."
