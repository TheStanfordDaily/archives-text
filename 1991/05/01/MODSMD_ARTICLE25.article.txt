# Engineers learn lesson from Prof. Ben Franklin
## 
### Lisa Goldman 
A petroleum engineering class
recently duplicated an old experi
ment of Benjamin Franklin's by
pouring a teaspoon of oil into Lake
Lagunita and observing the
smooth, remarkably thin circle
that it formed.
While the combination of large
amounts of oil and water may
have the undesirable effect of pol
luting a marine environment, a
few drops of oil can actually
smooth out waves and reveal some
interesting facts about molecular
structures.
Although Franklin's experi
ment revealed that oil does indeed
smooth out rough waters, he
could not measure the oil's thick
ness and had no conception of the
chemical relationship between oil
and water.
Today, the petroleum engineer
ing class knows that the oil will
eventually spread to a layer only
one molecule thick. This layer
forms from the simultaneous
attraction and repulsion between
oil and water molecules. An oil
molecule's electrically polarized
head is attracted to polar water
molecules; its hydrocarbon tail is
"hydrophobic," or repelled by
water. This unique structure
allows the molecule to "merge"
with the water and reduces the
surface tension of the water.

On a practical scale, using oil to
calm choppy seas for ships is not a
feasible idea, although it has been
attempted with some success. Sci
entists can, however, use the oil
and-water combination to learn
about films on ocean surfaces.

By spreading a film on the
water, compressing the layer and
measuring the surface pressure,
chemists can see how molecules
orient themselves in relation to
one another.
It is ironic to note that

although it takes modern chemi
cal physics to interpret this exper
iment, the phenomenon might
never have been observed had
Benjamin Franklin not wondered
why certain ships leave smoother
wakes than others.

Last Friday, students in Petroleum Engineering 260 C re-examined an experiment invented by Benjamin
Franklin. In the experiment, a small volume of oil spreads across Lake Lagunita's surface, creating a flat,
mirror-like layer only one moletaule thick.
