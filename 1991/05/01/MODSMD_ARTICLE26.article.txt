# Metal in a microwave: Don't try this at home
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
I've been thinking about Isaac
Newton's first law. It says that
every body continues in its state of
rest or uniform motion unless
compelled to change that state by
outside forces.
The book from which I took
that general wording chose to use
the word "compelled." Now, I can
be compelled to do many things,
usually by the forces of guilt or
chocolate. But to what extent can
you really reason with, say, a
molecule of salt? Can atoms feel
compelled to do anything except
sit around and swap electrons as if
they were so many baseball cards?
Speaking of baseball cards, why
is it some people will pay hun
dreds of thousands of dollars for a
small square of cardboard with a
dead baseball player's picture on
it, just because there aren't very
many small squares of cardboard
floating around that have this
particular dead baseball player's
picture on them?
There's only one small square
of cardboard in this world with my
picture on it (that was made at
"Boardwalk and Baseball'' in
Orlando, Florida in early 1989)
but I'd bet no one wants to buy it
from me for hundreds of thou
sands of dollars.
Q,Why does metal shoot off
%blue sparks when you put it
in a microwave oven?
A.Oh, dear. Maybe you should
• find Mommy and Daddy and
ask them if it's OK for you to be
calling those 900 numbers. (And if
they give you permission, ask if I
can come over.)
The heart of a microwave oven
is a magnetron. Inside the mag
netron, a beam of electrons spins
about two-and-a-half trillion
times a second and produces
microwaves.
The waves hit the food (or, if
you're bored, a small rodent) and
are absorbed by water molecules.
When the radiant energy is
converted into energy of motion,
the water molecules experience
intense vibrations. (That sentence
is loaded with sexual innuendo,
but I did that bit last week.) The
increased motion then heats the
food (or the rodent).
Metals, however, behave differ
ently. While the molecules in food
are bonded either covalently or
ionically, metals have their own
special type of bonding, called —
strangely enough — metallic
bonding.
Metal atoms have filled, happy
electron levels, but they also have
a few electrons hanging out alone
in the outermost level, just asking
for trouble. When atoms combine,
these delinquent electrons leave
their domains and wander about

the metal. A metallic bond is one
in which these bad-boy electrons
are shared by all the atoms in the
entire system.
Think of a metal as the water
in a bathtub. The metal nuclei are
the bathtub toys (the rubber
duck, the windup whale, the
turbo-powered camouflage sub
marine that shoots real torpe
does). The water represents the
electrons.
Of course, spreading these elec
trons around like that doesn't
make for a very strong bond. So,
when a microwave hits a metal,
these electrons are, um, compelled
to change their states. They're
torn from the metal and empow
ered with radiant energy. (And
sent off to save the world from the
next savings and loan crisis.)
That's what makes those cute, lit
tle, blue sparks appear.
And then, if you're not careful,
those nice men with their shiny
red trucks will appear and spray
lots of very cold water all over
your house, tromp through your
mom's flower beds and eat all
your coffee cake.
a. What causes baldness and
• how can I tell if I'll become
?
A .To answer this question 1
• went to a good friend of
mine, who also happens to have
lost some hair, and asked his opin
ion. He said baldness was caused
by drinking too much beer, ignor
ing instruction booklets that come
with common household appli
ances and never asking for direc
tions even when hopelessly lost.
This may explain why there are no
bald women.
Baldness is actually a sex-influ
enced trait, which means it
appears in both sexes but occurs
in one sex more than the other. In
males, the baldness gene is domi
nant; in females, it is recessive.


The
Science
Bug
Thus, a female must have two
copies of the gene, while men need
only one.
But even if women do receive
two copies of the gene (one from
each parent), they will not wind
up looking like Telly Savalas.
Testosterone, the male sex hor
mone, is required for full baldness
to occur. Females do have some
testosterone, but not enough to
put hair on their chests or take it
completely off their head. (They
also don't have enough to get
excited about protein shakes,
twin-cam engines or anything
having to do with Julia Roberts.)
There's no way to tell if you'll
definitely become bald. (It's one of
those wonderful surprises, like
termites, or mail from Publisher's
Clearinghouse.) If your father is
bald, then you know he has at
least one bald gene, and there's a
50 percent chance he generously
passed it on to you. There's also a
possibility your mother has a bald
gene, or even two, sneaking
around in her DNA.
I suppose it's possible to con
struct an elaborate family tree of
baldness, and then calculate the
probability. But you have to have
better things to do. (Like play
Banzai Run, alphabetize your
sock drawer or send in more ques
tions to the Science Bug.)
