# Apple's new System 7.0: An assortment of 'almosts'?
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Many of you who have been following
the System 7.0 discussion in this space are
likely wondering what's going on. If 7.0 is
indeed the best thing since sliced bread,
why is it being maligned by Computer Cor
ner?
The answer, as is often the case, is both
simple and complex. First, let me credit
Apple for producing an evolutionary
upgrade to the 7-year-old Macintosh. Sys
tem 7.0 expands upon the best personal
computer operating system there has ever
been. Windows 3.0, the graphical interface
for IBMs and compatibles, is like wooden
blocks compared to the Lego set that is
7.0.
But, there is a nagging feeling that after
all this time — 7.0 is at least a year behind
schedule, maybe more — the new system
should be more. It should be optimized for
speed much in the way Microsoft Word 4.0
finds and replaces faster than the original.
It should also have eliminated the need
for the countless INITs, CDEVs and the
like that Mac users have turned to in order
to provide the "missing" features of cur
rent system software.
Unfortunately, 7.0 tantalizes on many
occasions only to leave us feeling a little bit
shortchanged. Take program launching,
for instance. On The Daily's Macs, we keep
each program in a separate folder and all of
those inside a folder called Applications.

To launch an application, you open the
Applications folder, open, say, the Filemak
er Pro folder and double-click on the pro
gram icon. After a while, it gets inefficient
— to say the least.
One of the "workarounds" is to buy an
inexpensive program like On Cue, which
allows you to create a menu of your appli
cations that is always available on the
menu bar. Click on the small rocket-ship
icon, pull down, let go on Excel and —
presto — Excel launches, no matter where
you are currently working.
Enter System 7.0, and its customizable
Apple menu. Once you upgrade you'll be
able to install anything — desk acces
sories, applications, control panel devices
— in the Apple menu, which will always be
available. So long, On Cue.
Hold on a second. With all the desk
accessories and applications in the same
menu, aren't things going to get clut
tered in a hurry? Remember when you
first got an extra 15 fonts and the menu
went off the bottom of the screen? It
wasn't fun.
The solution for this menu clutter is
already provided by Hand Off. Like On
Cue, it allows launching from a menu. It
also allows you to group applications
under categories and reach them through
a hierarchical sub-menu. In other words,
you could scroll down to Graphics and
then select Illustrator, Freehand or Mac-
Draw. Furthermore, both On Cue and
Hand Off allow you to put documents for

the particular programs in
hierarchical sub-menus —
very useful if you work with
the same files over and over.
Why System 7.0 doesn't
allow the creation of such
menus is unclear, but it
seems to be an omission
that will force many of us to
keep some old INITs
around.
Another example is Suit-

case, the font-management tool that many
Mac aficionados use to manage large col
lections of typefaces. With System 7.0,
Font/DA Mover is extinct — you simply
drag fonts onto the System icon to install
them.
But Suitcase lives on. System 7.0
doesn't provide an easy way to turn sets of
fonts on and off. You'll have to drag them
in and out of the System, which you can at
least open like a folder. That's certainly a
less efficient process than simply opening
or closing a font collection with Suitcase.
The last example for this Computer
Corner is the dreaded Find File desk
accessory and its replacement. With Sys
tem 6.0.7 and earlier, the Finder — as
Apple's desktop-generating software is
called — didn't find a thing without help
from a DA. Because it was so slow, other
software companies produced faster alter
natives.
System 7.0 would seem, again, to put
them out of business with the lightning-

quick Find command (hold
down the Apple key and
press F or choose it from
the File menu). But Find
has a serious flaw: You can't
get a list of all the matches
in a neat tidy window a la
Find File or Norton Utili
ties' fantastic Fast Find.
If there's only one
match, you're set with 7.0.
It will open the appropri-

ate window and highlight the file. If there
are multiple matches, you can move
through them one at a time, watching win
dows open and close all the while — or you
can choose "all at once" and have the Mac
open just one window with all the matches
highlighted in the outline mode.
That would be terrific for deleting all
the saved games from NFL Challenge, but
not all that useful for looking at a list of
Word documents to determine which one
was last quarter's poli sci paper.
Find is another "almost." Almost great.
Almost makes me want to toss my old desk
accessory/control-panel device/INIT. But
not quite. If Apple puts these fixes into
System 7.1, I'll be ecstatic. If I have to run
the same old patches — and deal with all
the crashes they generate — I'll be left
wondering why.

accessory and its replacement. With Sys
tem 6.0.7 and earlier, the Finder — as
Apple's desktop-generating software is
called — didn't find a thing without help
from a DA. Because it was so slow, other
software companies produced faster alter
natives.
System 7.0 would seem, again, to put
them out of business with the lightning-

quick Find command (hold
down the Apple key and
press F or choose it from
the File menu). But Find
has a serious flaw: You can't
get a list of all the matches
in a neat tidy window a la
Find File or Norton Utili
ties' fantastic Fast Find.
If there's only one
match, you're set with 7.0.
It will open the appropri-

ate window and highlight the file. If there
are multiple matches, you can move
through them one at a time, watching win
dows open and close all the while — or you
can choose "all at once" and have the Mac
open just one window with all the matches
highlighted in the outline mode.
That would be terrific for deleting all
the saved games from NFL Challenge, but
not all that useful for looking at a list of
Word documents to determine which one
was last quarter's poli sci paper.
Find is another "almost." Almost great.
Almost makes me want to toss my old desk
accessory/control-panel device/INIT. But
not quite. If Apple puts these fixes into
System 7.1, I'll be ecstatic. If I have to run
the same old patches — and deal with all
the crashes they generate — I'll be left
wondering why.

Many of you who have been following
the System 7.0 discussion in this space are
likely wondering what's going on. If 7.0 is
indeed the best thing since sliced bread,
why is it being maligned by Computer Cor
ner?
The answer, as is often the case, is both
simple and complex. First, let me credit
Apple for producing an evolutionary
upgrade to the 7-year-old Macintosh. Sys
tem 7.0 expands upon the best personal
computer operating system there has ever
been. Windows 3.0, the graphical interface
for IBMs and compatibles, is like wooden
blocks compared to the Lego set that is
7.0.
But, there is a nagging feeling that after
all this time — 7.0 is at least a year behind
schedule, maybe more — the new system
should be more. It should be optimized for
speed much in the way Microsoft Word 4.0
finds and replaces faster than the original.
It should also have eliminated the need
for the countless INITs, CDEVs and the
like that Mac users have turned to in order
to provide the "missing" features of cur
rent system software.
Unfortunately, 7.0 tantalizes on many
occasions only to leave us feeling a little bit
shortchanged. Take program launching,
for instance. On The Daily's Macs, we keep
each program in a separate folder and all of
those inside a folder called Applications.

To launch an application, you open the
Applications folder, open, say, the Filemak
er Pro folder and double-click on the pro
gram icon. After a while, it gets inefficient
— to say the least.
One of the "workarounds" is to buy an
inexpensive program like On Cue, which
allows you to create a menu of your appli
cations that is always available on the
menu bar. Click on the small rocket-ship
icon, pull down, let go on Excel and —
presto — Excel launches, no matter where
you are currently working.
Enter System 7.0, and its customizable
Apple menu. Once you upgrade you'll be
able to install anything — desk acces
sories, applications, control panel devices
— in the Apple menu, which will always be
available. So long, On Cue.
Hold on a second. With all the desk
accessories and applications in the same
menu, aren't things going to get clut
tered in a hurry? Remember when you
first got an extra 15 fonts and the menu
went off the bottom of the screen? It
wasn't fun.
The solution for this menu clutter is
already provided by Hand Off. Like On
Cue, it allows launching from a menu. It
also allows you to group applications
under categories and reach them through
a hierarchical sub-menu. In other words,
you could scroll down to Graphics and
then select Illustrator, Freehand or Mac-
Draw. Furthermore, both On Cue and
Hand Off allow you to put documents for

the particular programs in
hierarchical sub-menus —
very useful if you work with
the same files over and over.
Why System 7.0 doesn't
allow the creation of such
menus is unclear, but it
seems to be an omission
that will force many of us to
keep some old INITs
around.
Another example is Suit-

case, the font-management tool that many
Mac aficionados use to manage large col
lections of typefaces. With System 7.0,
Font/DA Mover is extinct — you simply
drag fonts onto the System icon to install
them.
But Suitcase lives on. System 7.0
doesn't provide an easy way to turn sets of
fonts on and off. You'll have to drag them
in and out of the System, which you can at
least open like a folder. That's certainly a
less efficient process than simply opening
or closing a font collection with Suitcase.
