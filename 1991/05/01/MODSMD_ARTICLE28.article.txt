## Fair-weather fans found on the Farm 
### 
There they were, booing
with all their might. Just
months after Rickey
Henderson had led the A's to
their third consecutive World
Series — and had wrapped up
an American League MVP for
himself along the way — Oak
land baseball aficionados
turned on their hometown dar
ling.

Did he strike out 20 times in
a row?
Did he shoot someone with
the gun on the floor of his car?
(Oops, wrong Athletic out
fielder).
Did he say he was leaving
Oakland?
No. He was asking for more
more money.
Granted, he was demanding
that his recently signed four
year 12 million-dollar contract
be renegotiated. Immediately.
And he carried on about how
he was underpaid and unappre
ciated for the entire length of
spring training. And then
some.
And he also mentioned that
he just might not feel moti
vated enough to give his all in
every game this season since he
was only making three mil a
year — and Jose and Roger and
Darryl and, and, and just
everybody was earning more
than he now.
And he also sat and watched
his teammates play Cactus
League games behind a pair of
shades in the stands because he
was too upset to concentrate on
baseball.
So the loyal Oakland fans
who had trudged all the way to
Scottsdale, Ariz, in their green
and yellow polyester to see him
smack RBI and heist a few
bases, booed.
And agreed that Rickey
Henderson was a spoiled,
unappreciative athlete — albeit
a very talented one — who no
longer deserved his faithful fol
lowing's adoration. So they
turned their attentions back to
Mark McGwire — who was
considered a stud when he set
the rookie home-run record a

few years back, and Dave Stew
art — the meanest looking
great pitcher never to have won
a Cy Young award.
There they were, Monday
night, giving the very same
Rickey Henderson a Standing
O. Just 19 games into the Sea
son of Trashing Rickey, Oak
land fans gave him so much
applause that the game had to
be temporarily stopped. Hen
derson had just tied Lou
Brock's all-time Major League
stolen-base record with his
938 th swipe.
He was in the record books.
On his way to demolishing all
previous swiping milestones,
probably by hundreds.
And once again he was the
darling of Oakland.
Sports fans are the most
fickle people around. One
minute they love you, the
next you're lower than Hades.
One day they're calling for
more, the next they're asking
for your head on a plate.
It doesn't take long to get
onto their Most Hated list.
But it only takes an instant
for them to forget that they
were mad in the first place.
Even here on the Farm —
with our supposedly enlight
ened spectators — fans are the
same as in Anytown, USA.
They boo you off the field,
then they're asking for more.
They won't acknowledge the
existence of a team, then
they're begging for tickets.
It happens all the time.
Take men's basketball. Four
years ago you could have
housed the Kurdish refugees in
Maples. During a game. There
were so many empty seats, (the
few) loud noises echoed
throughout the morgue. The
Athletic Department was prac
tically giving away season
passes. I wondered what had
led me to believe my fellow stu
dents could be fans as well as
scholars.
The next season everything
clicked. Not only was the team
talented, but it won. A lot.
Even challenged Arizona for
the Pac-10 title.
If you didn't get to games
an hour early, forget it. Season
passes were sold out months
before competition began.
Hundreds of students road
tripped to L.A. to watch the
meaningless conference tour
ney. Dead week was put on hold


Debbie
Spander
while Stanford played in the
NCAA Tourney. The name Todd
Lichti was heard much more
often than any Western Culture
(whoops, CIV) author.
Then Todd the God trotted off
into the wilds of the NBA.
And fans went back to Meyer.
Or Menlo Park.
This season, with the excep

tions of the UCLA and Cal con
tests, it was hard to locate sup
porters in between all the rows of
empty bleachers. Coach Mike
Montgomery even complained to
the local press after a particularly
horrendous showing by Cardinal
(non)fans.
Stanford was sent packing for
the rest of its games after it
taught Houston a lesson in the
first round of the NIT. Too few
people to show up on the t.v. cam
eras.
But after the Cardinal pulled
off victories in the next two games
— one in Madison and one some
place in Illinois — there were sud
denly Stanford hoops fans. Lots
of them.

"Hey, we're in the NIT finals,"
students yelled at one another.
"Did you watch the win over
Oklahoma?" you heard upon
return from spring break.
Over 500 people greeted the
team when it returned to campus
— and most students were in
Hawaii at the time.
The basketball team was out of
the dog house. Just like that there
were tons of Stanford hoops fans.
But don't expect them to be
here in December.

Lichti was heard much more
often than any Western Culture

Then Todd the God trotted off
into the wilds of the NBA.
And fans went back to Meyer.

This season, with the excep

tions of the UCLA and Cal con
tests, it was hard to locate sup
porters in between all the rows of
empty bleachers. Coach Mike
Montgomery even complained to
the local press after a particularly
horrendous showing by Cardinal
(non)fans.
Stanford was sent packing for
the rest of its games after it
taught Houston a lesson in the
first round of the NIT. Too few
people to show up on the t.v. cam
eras.
But after the Cardinal pulled
off victories in the next two games
— one in Madison and one some
place in Illinois — there were sud
denly Stanford hoops fans. Lots
of them.

"Hey, we're in the NIT finals,"
students yelled at one another.
"Did you watch the win over
Oklahoma?" you heard upon
return from spring break.
Over 500 people greeted the
team when it returned to campus
— and most students were in
Hawaii at the time.
The basketball team was out of
the dog house. Just like that there
were tons of Stanford hoops fans.
But don't expect them to be
here in December.

There they were, booing
with all their might. Just
months after Rickey
Henderson had led the A's to
their third consecutive World
Series — and had wrapped up
an American League MVP for
himself along the way — Oak
land baseball aficionados
turned on their hometown dar
ling.

Did he strike out 20 times in
a row?
Did he shoot someone with
the gun on the floor of his car?
(Oops, wrong Athletic out
fielder).
Did he say he was leaving
Oakland?
No. He was asking for more
more money.
Granted, he was demanding
that his recently signed four
year 12 million-dollar contract
be renegotiated. Immediately.
And he carried on about how
he was underpaid and unappre
ciated for the entire length of
spring training. And then
some.
And he also mentioned that
he just might not feel moti
vated enough to give his all in
every game this season since he
was only making three mil a
year — and Jose and Roger and
Darryl and, and, and just
everybody was earning more
than he now.
And he also sat and watched
his teammates play Cactus
League games behind a pair of
shades in the stands because he
was too upset to concentrate on
baseball.
So the loyal Oakland fans
who had trudged all the way to
Scottsdale, Ariz, in their green
and yellow polyester to see him
smack RBI and heist a few
bases, booed.
And agreed that Rickey
Henderson was a spoiled,
unappreciative athlete — albeit
a very talented one — who no
longer deserved his faithful fol
lowing's adoration. So they
turned their attentions back to
Mark McGwire — who was
considered a stud when he set
the rookie home-run record a

few years back, and Dave Stew
art — the meanest looking
great pitcher never to have won
a Cy Young award.
There they were, Monday
night, giving the very same
Rickey Henderson a Standing
O. Just 19 games into the Sea
son of Trashing Rickey, Oak
land fans gave him so much
applause that the game had to
be temporarily stopped. Hen
derson had just tied Lou
Brock's all-time Major League
stolen-base record with his
938 th swipe.
He was in the record books.
On his way to demolishing all
previous swiping milestones,
probably by hundreds.
And once again he was the
darling of Oakland.
Sports fans are the most
fickle people around. One
minute they love you, the
next you're lower than Hades.
One day they're calling for
more, the next they're asking
for your head on a plate.
It doesn't take long to get
onto their Most Hated list.
But it only takes an instant
for them to forget that they
were mad in the first place.
Even here on the Farm —
with our supposedly enlight
ened spectators — fans are the
same as in Anytown, USA.
They boo you off the field,
then they're asking for more.
They won't acknowledge the
existence of a team, then
they're begging for tickets.
It happens all the time.
Take men's basketball. Four
years ago you could have
housed the Kurdish refugees in
Maples. During a game. There
were so many empty seats, (the
few) loud noises echoed
throughout the morgue. The
Athletic Department was prac
tically giving away season
passes. I wondered what had
led me to believe my fellow stu
dents could be fans as well as
scholars.
The next season everything
clicked. Not only was the team
talented, but it won. A lot.
Even challenged Arizona for
the Pac-10 title.
