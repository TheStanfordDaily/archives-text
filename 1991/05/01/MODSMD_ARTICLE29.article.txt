# From Seles to Stanford
## Freshman Laxmi Poruri hopes to help Cardinal to another NCAA title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Name the only person at
Stanford with a win over a cur
rent No.l tennis player in the
worlT
Jonathan Stark? Nope. Debbie Gra
ham? Sorry, close doesn't count.
Doesn't Jared Palmer play with Ivan
Lendl sometimes? Yes, but Lendl's not
No. 1 and Palmer's never beaten him in
an actual match.
The answer is freshman Laxmi
Poruri and the victim was Monica Seles,
who currently tops the Women's Tennis
Association rankings. It happened back
at the Orange Bowl tournament four
years ago when Poruri was a promising
14-year-old. The match wasn't even
close as Poruri rolled over Seles 6-3, 6-2.
As the months passed, Poruri would
continue to be in another zone, as the
saying goes. Opponents would crumble
before her, and the thought of her losing
was borderline ridiculous. "That was
the best year of my life, the best time of
my life," Poruri says."It rules over the
first year of college.
"When I look back, it's kind of
depressing," she continues. "I just
crushed people. I had so much intensity
. . . I think I was obsessed with perfec
tion."
So much so that she would play six
hours of tennis each day. All the hard
work seemed to be paying off in results.
Before her amazing run was through,
she would record a win over Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario and play in the main
draw of the U.S. Open.
In retrospect, Poruri thinks it might
have been too much, too soon. As a
superstar on the junior circuit, she
attracted the attention of agents who
would predict great things for her. And
Poruri paid attention.
"When you're 14 years old, you don't
know that much. You have these agents
looking at you and feel like you'd better
impress them," she says. Meanwhile,
the people around you are getting swept
up in the wave — parents, coaches, et al.
"You start thinking about everything

but tennis," Poruri adds. Eventually it
would all catch up with Poruri.
"I shouldn't have taken it so seri
ously," she says of her success. "I really
regret that. I wish I took more time to
relax and have fun with the game." But
Poruri admits there is more to it.
When she was younger, Poruri could
beat people without working her hard
est. "Other players weren't as strong,
weren't as smart," she says.
Her game was above and beyond that
of the competition. But time passes, and
the competition improves. If one hopes
to continue winning, one has to retool —
even overhaul — one's game.
That's a very tough thing to do. "It's
such a big hurdle to make a transition,"
Poruri explains. "You have to say, 'I'm
going to lose ... for a year — maybe
longer.' "
Had she done that at age 15, had she
chosen to lose now, win later, it's quite
possible Poruri wouldn't be at Stanford.
True, she would not be Monica Seles.
But there exists a possibility she would
be Laxmi Poruri, one of the best players
in the world.
"I wish I worked on my game more as
a kid. I wish I took care of my body," she
says, acknowledging that she didn't.
Only now, as a college freshman, has
Poruri embarked upon the difficult road
of "transition."
She knows she may never be able to
make over her game completely, but she
intends to give it her best shot. "I've
chosen to do it," Poruri says. "I'd rather
fail doing what I think is right than fail
doing what I.know is wrong."
But altering the way she plays tennis
hasn't been the only source of tension in
for Poruri. There is inside of her a con
stant battle to decide what she wants
out of life.
The conflict is about her future: Will
it focus on tennis or will she dedicate
herself to education? Will she try to
become a ranked professional or per
haps a college professor?
Her parents are both doctors — dad
is a general practitioner, mom an anes
thesiologist. THey have raised her to

take academics seriously. They have also
raised her as a tennis player. "All my life,
I've been taught that both are very
important," she says.
When it came time to choose between
college and the pro circuit, Poruri chose
to come to Stanford. It was a dream she
had since she was a pre-teen. Coach
Frank Brennan recalls a skinny little
12-vear-old girl approaching him at the
Ojai Valley tournament years ago.
The girl wore an oversized gray
sweatshirt that went down to her knees.
The red letters on the shirt spelled out
"Stanford University." What the girl
told Brennan was simple: "I'm going to
go to Stanford." He thought little of it at
the time.
A year later, Brennan says, the same
girl walked up to him and said the same
thing. This time he asked someone,
"Who is that kid?" He was informed her
name was Laxmi Poruri and has had an
eye on her ever since.
Recruiting Poruri wasn't a matter of
selling Stanford over, say, UCLA; it was
a matter of selling college over the work
ing world. "I tried to convince her she'd
be missing out on the greatest four
years of her life," Brennan says. "She
believed me, I guess."
True enough, she did. But the choice
wasn't easy, nor is it necessarily perma
nent. She decided she wanted to experi
ence college at least for a while. "The
biggest thing is that people who stay in
school get to enjoy being young and
crazy, which a lot of people on the tour
miss," Poruri says.
"But there comes a time when you've
been young and crazy and you think,
'Why not try something else and he dif
ferent from point oh-oh-oh-one percent
of your colleagues?' "
The .0001 percent make it as profes
sional athletes, something Poruri still
could consider trying. "College is a lot of
fun. But it's not all fun," she says,
explaining that schoolwork is no walk in
the park.
But being at Stanford, away from
home and her parents, has taught

After a tremendous juniors career that included victories over Grand Slam winners
Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Laxml Poruri came to the Farm as the
nation s top recruit. While her game has not taken off to the degree that those players'
games have, Poruri is a key part of the Stanford singles and doubles lineups this year.
Poruri a lot about being indepen
dent and thinking for herself. She
feels those lessons will valuable
no matter what she eventually
does — especially if she decides to
pursue her sport.
The self-sufficiency, Poruri
says is vital. "Everything you do
on the court is you and no one
- else."
She has received other lessons
this year as well. There have been
extreme highs and difficult lows.
"I've learned a lot about making
friends. I've learned who really
cares for me in this world," she
says.
Powerful stuff, to be sure. But
not enough to erase the conflict.
Poruri thinks she wants to major
in science and knows how difficult
it will be to do that and concen
trate on tennis. She looks to
Jason Yee, an engineering major
on the men's team, and Sandra
Birch, who has a remarkable
grade-point average and an
NCAA individual singles trophy
and sees that it can be done.
Still, Poruri wonders if she can
have it all, if she can perform at a
high level on the court and in the
classroom. "Why put all that time
in and just be mediocre (at some
thing)?" she says.
Poruri has many choices: leave
school, quit playing tennis, or
develop a hybrid. She could take
summer school, skip the autumn
season and play tennis in winter
and spring. That way she can con
centrate completely on the task at
hand.

All the options don't make
things easier, though. "I'm not at
my best when I'm thinking about
10,000 things. I think about too
many choices. I wouldn't be a
good president; I'm not a good
decision-maker," Poruri explains.
At times, the indecisiveness
affects her play as well. "That's
one of my big faults," she admits.
Brennan agrees. He says, "She
makes a lot of decisions about
where to put the ball in the mid
dle of points. 'I could take this
shot and rip it cross court and
take your head off, or I could
finesse it down the line.' "
The coach is trying to get
Poruri to play more pattern ten
nis. "Most of your good players
are predictable," Brennan
explains. "They just do it so well."
He cites the example of John
McEnroe at Wimbledon. He's
ready to serve and everyone at
Centre Court knows its going
wide to the backhand side, includ
ing his opponent.
But the serve is so good, it's
still almost impossible to return.
Poruri, he notes, needs to do more
of the same thing. "No here once,
there once," he says, pointing left
and right. "You go there and you
go there. Until the cows come
home."
Poruri will someday decide not
just where to go on the tennis
court but where to go in her life.
She's not sure where yet but she
is sure of one thing:
"I'm very attached to my fam
ily. I missed them a lot more than
I expected this year. . . . Whatever
I do in life, I want to do something
that makes them happy as well.
That's the most important thing
to me. Period."
