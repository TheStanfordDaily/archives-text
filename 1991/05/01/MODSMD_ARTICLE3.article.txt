# Chavez speaks to Kresge crowd
## Leader of farm workers discusses pesticides, boycotts 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm
Workers of America, received three standing ova
tions in an emotional yet humorous speech to a
nearly filled Kresge Auditorium audience last night.
A video entitled "The Wrath of Grapes" set the
tone for the evening, as Chavez urged the audience
to participate in the ongoing union-led boycott of
table grapes in California.
"We're asking everybody not to buy anything that
looks like a grape," said Chavez. He added, however,
that raisins and wines were not included in the boy
cott.
Chavez' speech, along with the video, told horrid
stories of the effects of pesticides on young children
of farm workers, as shown in birth defects and can
cers.
In McFarland, a farming community in the Cali
fornia central valley, Chavez said the cancer rate was
800 percent higher than the national average. "In
one block (of McFarland), a child in every house is
dead or dying," said Chavez.
"These 'cancer clusters' are very technical,"
added Chavez, "but the victims are very human."
Prior to Chavez' speech, more than 100 invited
guests from the Stanford community welcomed
Chavez at a banquet at Casa Zapata, where Chavez
signed his name on Zapata's dining hall mural. The
mural depicts several famous leaders of the Chi
cano/Latino community, including Chavez, seated at

a table in a fashion similar to that of Leonardo da
Vinci's "Last Supper" painting.
Zapata resident fellow Tony Burciaga, a muralist
and writer, said Chavez was the top vote-getter of a
poll conducted to decide who should be seated at the
table in the painting.
"He (Chavez) is kind of a symbol of integrity and
spiritual vision," said Anthropology Prof Renato
Rosaldo, who introduced Chavez at Kresge.
"Some Chicanos view him as 'our Ghandi'; he has
the spiritual quality of a Ghandi," he added.
Although Chavez' speech was welcomed by a pre
dominately Chicano/Latino crowd, Chavez has previ
ously been poorly received by the government and
other authorities.
"Being arrested, what's new?" said Chavez.
Chavez spoke of his difficulties in dealing with the
government. "There are a few good politicians, but
not a lot of them," he said. "We have received noth
ing from the government except harassment. The
UFW has been investigated more than any other
union. [The government thinks 1 I get paid for what I
do. I don't get paid, but anybody will give me a taco."
Recently, a rival union, the Grape Workers and
Farmer's Coalition, has claimed that Chavez' grape
boycott is a mask for his union's failure. Union rep
resentative Adam Ortega called the boycott "a
fraud" in a phone interview with The Daily yester
day.
