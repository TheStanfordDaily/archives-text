# Stanford stops stubborn St. Mary's
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team got
itself a little confidence builder
yesterday. Nothing heals the pain
of bad memories better than a vic
tory, and St. Mary's was just what
the docter ordered.
Using a three-run first inning,
Stanford jumped to an early lead
and held on for a 6-4 non-confer
ence win in Moraga, Calif. The
Cardinal ran its record to 32-16
while the Gaels dropped to 24-22.
Though the victory did not
have any effect on the Cardinal's
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division standing, the game still
had Six-Pac implications. Stan
ford has been struggling of late in
conference play and heads down
to Los Angeles to face UCLA this
weekend, a team that swept the
Cardinal at home two weeks ago.
Stanford needs to feel good about
themselves to finish strong in con
ference play, and seeing the num
bers in the overall win column
grow is the right kind of ego boost.
"This was a good opportunity
to get momentum heading into
the weekend," said designated hit
ter Ryan Turner. "We had timely
hitting which we haven't had in
awhile, and the pitching did really
well."
Recently moved out of left field
into the designated hitter spot,
Turner was responsible for two of
the Cardinal's first inning runs.
The San Jose native followed
David Cornell's RBI double with a
single through the hole at short
stop that brought in Jeffrey Ham
monds from third and Cornell for
the early 3-0 lead. A .335 hitter

last year, Turner has been strug
gling to stay near the .300 mark
this year, but did not have much
trouble with the Gael pitchers yes
terday as he went 2-for-4.
"I'm just trying to get back on
track," said the senior. "I have my
good games and my bad games;
I'm looking for consistency."
The same can be said for the
Cardinal pitching staff. Rocked in
Sunday's game against Arizona
and struggling to put together a
string of good games, Stanford
pitching came away from yester
day's win looking good. The only
rough spot was the bottom of the
eighth when the Gaels loaded the
bases on a hit and two walks off
releiver Brian Sackinsky. Sackin
sky had come in to replace starter
Jamie Sepeda, and with three men
on and two outs, coach Mark Mar
quess went to the bullpen again.
Scott Weiss came in to give up a
single to pinch hitter Randy
Cooper that combined with a Cor
nell error to empty the bags and
move the Gaels to within two at 6-
4, but the home team would get no
more. The Cooper single would
turn out to be the last hit St.
Mary's would manage, and with
pinch-runner James Bitler stand
ing on third, Weiss struck out
Chris Koeper to end the threat.
After being on the losing side of
things his last few appearances,
Weiss found yesterday more to his
liking.
"The past couple of weeks have
been tough; it's been a real blow to
my confidence," Weiss said. "But
it was a show of confidence that
(the coaches) put me in that situa
