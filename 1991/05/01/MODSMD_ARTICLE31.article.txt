# Women sailors grab berth at nationals
## 
### Deborah Claymon 
Sure, you've heard it all before. Stanford
women this, Stanford women that. But taking
third at this past weekend's women's Pacific
Coast Championships hosted by California,
the Stanford women sailors are charging
ahead to Nationals, part of the new challenge
to the now-dominant East Coast schools from
West Coast women's sailing.
In a fleet of 11 schools, the largest showing
in years, Orange Coast College sailed consis
tently to a strong first, narrowly defeating UC-
Irvine, despite more first place bullets from
the Irvine pair. Stanford's pairing of sopho
more Haley King, junior Jenn Yeh and sopho
more Marina Kimball in A, and sophomore
Catherine Ivey, junior Amy Lightner and
sophomore Stacey Misakian in B division sur
passed the rest of the fleet, taking the third
berth at Nationals in New Orleans, their next
destination.
Although both pairs struggled in the chang
ing conditions from light to unusually extreme
wind in the Berkeley harbor, each skillfully
finished with a bullet.

'The amount of schools that
competed made the whole
regatta fantastic, as well as
helping to increase the num
ber of berths from our dis
trict.'

The berths for women at Nationals are
determined on a percentage basis from the
number of schools represented in each district.
"The amount of schools that competed made
the whole regatta fantastic, as well as helping
to increase the number of berths from our dis
trict. It really shows that women's sailing on
the West Coast is growing fast," King said.
In A division, King fought gusty wind,
switching crews to find a needed consistency
on the turbulent water. An unfortunate pre
mature start put Stanford's A team behind in

what ended as a tight point race between sec
ond and sixth. UC-Irvine, Cal, Stanford and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo battled in both days
of racing to punch ahead of the others.
In B division, Ivey snuck past a tough
Orange Coast team by one point for second in
B's. "[Catherine] really stayed confident
through both days of racing and was able to
pull off an undoubtedly successful series of
races, only once falling below the top five,"
said coach Blake Middleton.
Middleton added that "both of the teams led
by King and Ivey are young in their sailing
careers for Stanford. As sophomores, Haley
and Catherine will only get better, only con
tinue to take charge at more PCC's." Although
the official invitation awaits, this is only the
second Cardinal berth for women's Nationals
in five years. Stanford women are currently
10th in the national rankings.
This week in Coronado, Calif., the Stanford
coed team competes in both fleet and team rac
ing PCC's hosted by UC-San Diego and San
Diego State. After storming past the competi
tion in the North Series, Stanford anticipates
that a trip to New Orleans lies ahead.
