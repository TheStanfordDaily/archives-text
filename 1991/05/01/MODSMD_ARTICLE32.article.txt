Swimmers strike back
Cameron Macky [in his April
23 column] portrayed himself as
a well of knowledge on the sport
of swimming. He does not, in
our opinion, have a clue. He
challenged you to "make up your
own mind" regarding the issue
of Janet Evans leaving Stanford.
We encourage you to do the
same.
"Let's get two things straight:"
(1) The problem we have with
your article, Mr. Macky, is your
accusation that Janet lied about
why she left. Oh sure, you used
some fancy reporter lingo so you
wouldn't be liable, but the impli
cation was certainly there.
We have to agree with you;
whatever Janet's reasons were
for leaving are really no business
of anyone else's.
In drawing your information
from the L.A. Times, you fell vic
tim to its bias. Reporters have
the ability to slant a story in any
way they please. You, of all peo
ple, should know that. The L.A.
Times article is but one interpre
tation of the situation. The con
tradiction between Janet's story
and that of the Times does not
necessarily imply deceit.
Perhaps Janet did not swim
as fast this year as she would
have liked, but did you know
that Janet was talking about
leaving Stanford to train for a
year back in January when the
whole NCAA regulation change
came about? Maybe inside,
Janet was not happy with her
training, but that does not give
you any sort of right to make
inferences about the coaching

ability of Richard Quick or the
quality of the Stanford program.
Further, who are you to
judge? You haven't even talked
to her! Is it really standard pro
cedure to get information from
another newspaper when the
original source is available?
Maybe it is, but we feel it is
extremely unprofessional.
How sad that, on top of every
thing else, Janet has to deal with
fair-weather sports writers
across the country and even at
her own school, who insist upon
raking her over the coals, what
ever explanation she gives.
While we do not deny that Janet
may have had other reasons for
leaving, we feel that what you
have so expertly commented on
regarding her situation boarders
on ignorance. This brings us to
our second point:
(2) Let's get it straight that
Janet did not come to Stanford,
"first, and foremost, and above
all else, to swim. Period." How
dare you make such a ridiculous
statement? In the summer of
1988, Janet broke three world
records and won three gold
medals in Seoul. The following
summer, she won four gold
medals at the Pan-Pacific Games
in Tokyo — oh . . . and broke one
more world record — all before
ever setting foot on the Farm.
If she only wanted to swim,
why didn't she stay at home and
at the same time accept countless
endorsements which the NCAA
so strictly forbids? Why not stay
at a place where she was enjoying
so much success? The bottom
line is that she wanted a great
education and knew that her

sport was not everything in life.
And we're not done yet. ... It
is absurd to compare Janet, a
Stanford student-athlete, who
got in to school because she was
capable of contributing to the
Stanford academic community,
and was able to maintain a GPA
greater than 3.0, to an athlete
from "Toledo" who, by your own
admission, is a "non-student/
athlete." Next article, Cameron,
why not compare apples to
oranges? It might make for a
better story.
To the Stanford community,
we would like to say this: Janet
left her entire team, coaching
staff and friends behind. It was
not an easy decision and the last
thing she wanted was to hurt
any of us, or anyone at Stanford
University. In blaming the
NCAA, she was not trying to
"hide something about [herjself
that people probably won't like."
For anyone who knows Janet,
there is nothing not to like. Janet
did what was best for her and
best for all, given the situation.
Rather than condemning her,
we should wish her well. She has
done so much for this university
in only two years, including win
ning five NCAA titles, setting
two American and three NCAA
records, as well as receiving both
the Sullivan Award and the
[Honda-JBroderick Award in
1990. Any success she might
enjoy in the future will always
come back to reflect positively
on Stanford.

we would like to say this: Janet
left her entire team, coaching
staff and friends behind. It was
not an easy decision and the last
thing she wanted was to hurt
any of us, or anyone at Stanford
University. In blaming the
NCAA, she was not trying to
"hide something about [herjself
that people probably won't like."
For anyone who knows Janet,
there is nothing not to like. Janet
did what was best for her and
best for all, given the situation.
Rather than condemning her,
we should wish her well. She has
done so much for this university
in only two years, including win
ning five NCAA titles, setting
two American and three NCAA
records, as well as receiving both
the Sullivan Award and the
[Honda-JBroderick Award in
1990. Any success she might
enjoy in the future will always
come back to reflect positively
on Stanford.
