Junior wins award for paper
Junior Ravi Bellur recently won an award for
the best student paper at the 20th annual meet
ing of the Western Decision Sciences Institute in
Lihue, Hawaii.
Bellur wrote "East and West Germany: Joint
Ventures Across the Crumbled Wall." His paper
was "a participant-observation analysis of what
joint ventures where taking place, how confident
people felt about the success of these ventures,
and how much the government and the corpora
tions stood behind it," Bellur said.
One of the joint ventures Bellur studied was
the Dresdener Bank, which recently reunited
with its old partner in West Germany. Bellur said
western Germans described the bank's business
practices as similar to those of organized crime.
Service fellowships announced
The winners of the 1991 Arts and Humanities
Public Service Summer Fellowships were recently
announced. The eight students received fellow
ships to work on public service projects benefiting
children through the arts, according to junior
Natasha Ogunji, one winner.
Ogur\ji will teach photography to four girls
from Ravenswood Middle School in East Palo
Alto.
"One of the reasons I'm doing it is because I
want students to be able to define their experience
through photographs as opposed to having some
one else speak for their community," Ogunji said.
Each student received $1,500 for the summer.
Students were selected on the basis of an applica
tion and an interview.
In addition to Ogunji, the winners are:
• Graduate student Paula Alexander, who will
work on a writing project with children of bat
tered women. This is the second year in a row she
has won the fellowship.
• Junior Marshell Jones, who will also be
repeating her fellowship, teaching African dance
in Baltimore.

• Junior Fred Spitz, who will be helping teach

San Jose.
