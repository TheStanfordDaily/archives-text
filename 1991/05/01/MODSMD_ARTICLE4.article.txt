# Reges can't be arrested just for drug use claims
## Police, experts doubt 'probable cause' exists 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stanford Police and several legal experts
said yesterday that Stuart Reges cannot be
arrested or convicted solely for admitting
his drug use and possession.
In addition, several scholars questioned
whether Reges' recommendation of drug
use to a student should be considered con
duct.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that "unless [Reges] would like to come
in [to the police station] and bring in his
backpack" with the illegal drugs, it would
be very difficult to arrest him. He said a
case "must be established on probable
cause."
Niemeyer added that it would be very
difficult to obtain a search warrant for
Reges' backpack or home. However, he said
the police will discuss the issue with the dis
trict attorney later this week.
Margo Smith, supervising district attor
ney for Palo Alto, declined to speculate on
the case because she said all she knows
about the case is from newspaper reports.
"He can't be convicted solely on the basis
of his admission," said University Assoc.
General Counsel Iris Brest. "You don't get
arrested for speeding by saying you speed."
For police to have probable cause, there
must be some form of physical evidence or

witness to the illegal activity, scholars said.
Law Prof. William Cohen agreed, saying,
"There is only indirect proof that a crime
has been committed."
Reges, a computer science senior lec
turer, was placed on paid administrative
leave last week pending an investigation of
his claims that he violated University drug
rules in protest of U.S. drug policy.
The controversy has also ignited
national debate over a fundamental legal
issue — the limitations of free speech.
At a chance meeting with Reges, a stu
dent asked the lecturer if he should experi
ment with the drug MDA, an
amphetamine-derived hallucinogen nick
named "the love drug." The student, who
wished to remain anonymous, told The
Daily that they talked for an hour about the
pros and cons of drug use. He said that at
the end of the conversation, Reges recom
mended that he experiment with the drug.
The student added that he had devoted a
lot of thought to his decision before and
after the discussion and also conferred with
a few friends. Eventually, he said, he
decided not to take the drug.
University President Donald Kennedy
wrote in a letter to The Daily April 22 that
Reges' advice constitutes "conduct, not pro
tected speech." He added that any "attempt
to establish a particular kind of
speech — personal conversations
between faculty members and
students — as wholly exempt
from the burden of professional
responsibility is misguided."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, a con
stitutional lawyer who authored
the "fighting words" reinterpre
tation of the Fundamental Stan
dard, said he thinks the advice
was protected speech. "A teacher
should be able to give advice."
He noted that "there's a fine
line between using authority as a
teacher" and communicating as a
peer, but he said he thinks Reges
did not abuse his position of
authority.
Cohen said, "Of course it's a
free speech issue. ... We can't cut
off inquiry by calling it conduct."
He noted, however, that "not all
speech is free," he said.
Some have proposed that
Reges' advocacy was incitement
to commit a crime and is there
fore not protected.
Cohen said there is some con
troversy among lawyers concern
ing the definition of "incitement"
and the appropriate legal stan

dard against which to measure
free speech issues. Currently, he
said, most lawyers refer to Bran
denburg v. Ohio, which defined
"incitement" as telling someone
to do a specific act which is likely
to occur — not just talking about
a general act.
However, Brest noted that pri
vate employers do not necessarily
have to follow state and federal
laws protecting free speech. She
said the case logs are filled with
employers taking action against
employees on grounds of disrup
tive or demoralizing speech —
speech which is protected by the
First Amendment.
Brest said that defining the
issue as "free speech" versus
"punishable misconduct" is an
oversimplification. She said that
protected expression includes not
just speech, but also some forms
of non-verbal expression.
She said she believes Reges'
advice rests on a spectrum
between two extremes; for exam
ple, between a teacher who says"I
think marijuana is great — every
one should try it"and who says
"Here is a cigarette, smoke it
now."
Grey drew an analogy to a fel
low law professor, who wrote a
book that claimed some drugs
were less dangerous than others.
Grey said that if a student had

gone to the professor and asked
for information about marijuana,
and he had told the student "to
look at page five," the situation
would be "clearly protected by the
First Amendment."
Another legal issue in Reges'
case involves the right to privacy.
Reges stated in a Nov. 9 letter to
The Daily that he frequently car
ries illegal drugs in his backpack
to protest government drug pol
icy. "Most importantly, I think
that students must feel that the
privacy of dorm rooms on campus
will not be violated," the letter
stated.
"The University should be
indifferent to any private activity
taking place between consenting
adults in a dorm room, even if
that activity includes underage
drinking or use of illegal drugs,"
he continued.
Grey said he thinks Reges is
"confused" about the privacy
issue. "Just because he can't be
stopped and searched without
cause doesn't mean" police offi
cials could not search his back
pack if they had sufficient cause.
While students do have a right
to not have their dorm rooms
searched without cause, Grey
said, their rooms do not offer a
safe haven from drug-possession
laws.
