# Reges can't be arrested just for drug use claims
## Police, experts doubt 'probable cause' exists 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stanford Police and several legal experts
said yesterday that Stuart Reges cannot be
arrested or convicted solely for admitting
his drug use and possession.
In addition, several scholars questioned
whether Reges' recommendation of drug
use to a student should be considered con
duct.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said that "unless [Reges] would like to come
in [to the police station] and bring in his
backpack" with the illegal drugs, it would
be very difficult to arrest him. He said a
case "must be established on probable
cause."
Niemeyer added that it would be very
difficult to obtain a search warrant for
Reges' backpack or home. However, he said
the police will discuss the issue with the dis
trict attorney later this week.
Margo Smith, supervising district attor
ney for Palo Alto, declined to speculate on
the case because she said all she knows
about the case is from newspaper reports.
"He can't be convicted solely on the basis
of his admission," said University Assoc.
General Counsel Iris Brest. "You don't get
arrested for speeding by saying you speed."
For police to have probable cause, there
must be some form of physical evidence or

witness to the illegal activity, scholars said.
Law Prof. William Cohen agreed, saying,
"There is only indirect proof that a crime
has been committed."
Reges, a computer science senior lec
turer, was placed on paid administrative
leave last week pending an investigation of
his claims that he violated University drug
rules in protest of U.S. drug policy.
The controversy has also ignited
national debate over a fundamental legal
issue â€” the limitations of free speech.
At a chance meeting with Reges, a stu
dent asked the lecturer if he should experi
ment with the drug MDA, an
amphetamine-derived hallucinogen nick
named "the love drug." The student, who
wished to remain anonymous, told The
Daily that they talked for an hour about the
pros and cons of drug use. He said that at
the end of the conversation, Reges recom
mended that he experiment with the drug.
The student added that he had devoted a
lot of thought to his decision before and
after the discussion and also conferred with
a few friends. Eventually, he said, he
decided not to take the drug.
University President Donald Kennedy
wrote in a letter to The Daily April 22 that
Reges' advice constitutes "conduct, not pro
tected speech." He added that any "attempt
