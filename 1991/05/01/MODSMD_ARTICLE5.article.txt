# Prizes tried as incentive for curtailing water use
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
If you can't beat 'em, win 'em over with
prizes. More specifically, if you can't con
vince people to conserve water on their
own, create a contest with incentives to cur
tail water use.
So that's exactly what the Housing
Energy Conservation Center did. It has
started a contest to award the residence
which most reduces its per capita water use
by the end of the quarter. In addition, the
center will gives prizes each week to keep
students motivated.
Prizes will include T-shirts, pizzas and
study breaks from establishments like the
Stanford Pub and Suzanne's Muffins.
The leading residences for the first two
weeks are Roth and Whitman, each of
which reduced its water use by 16 percent.
"We decided to promote water conserva
tion . . . not by pitting dorms against each
other but by comparing use on a weekly
basis and giving incentives along the way.
It's basically the 'carrot on the stick'
approach," said project director Susan
Kulakowski.
During spring vacation, 19 new water
meters were installed at student residences
around campus. The center took a reading

after the first week of the quarter and
established that as the average water use
for each residence.
Each house has an environmental repre
sentative who takes a reading off the meter
each week and reports it to the center. The
contest is divided into two categories: resi
dences that have control over the water
used by their food service and those that do
not.
Kulakowski said it is a "little early to
tell" how effective the project is. "Some
houses' use has gone down, some have gone
up," she said.
"It would be great to get anywhere near
20 to 30 percent reduction," said sopho
more David Goldenberg, an environmental
intern with the center.
"Despite the rain we had in March, we're
still in a serious rain deficit. It's still very
important to conserve," Kulakowski said.
Larry Andrews, water and sewer super
intendent for Operations and Maintenance,
said Stanford University uses over one bil
lion gallons of water per year.
"We need to know where the water is
going and who's using what water,"
Andrews said, explaining the need for the
19 student water meters and the 650 water
meters that have been installed at faculty
houses.
