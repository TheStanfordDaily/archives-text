Vermont students of color
take over president's office
Last week, 24 minority students at
the University of Vermont held a sit-in
at the president's office in an attempt to
force him to change his decision regard
ing the university's minority hiring and
recruitment policy.
In 1988, another student takeover
prompted an agreement to set a targeted
number of minority faculty and stu
dents. However, University President
George Davis refused to sign the agree
ment, leading students to occupy his
office. Davis said he didn't approve the
plan because he "didn't want to promise
something he couldn't deliver."

Credit given for dating
Students in a class at Lehigh Univer
sity are rewarded with extra credit for
dating.
Prof. Bruce Smackey gives extra cred
it to his students in a marketing class
called "New Product Planning" for
amorous extracurricular activities. Stu

dents receive five points for each date,
two more for a date with someone else in
the class and five points for matchmak
ing.
Smackey said he was concerned
because students seemed to date rarely.
"I think of dating as a normal, healthy
part of growing up, and I took the initia
tive to try to do something in a humor
ous way that dealt with a serious prob
lem."
