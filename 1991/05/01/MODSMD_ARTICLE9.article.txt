### Linda Chen 
Offering her vision of a multicultural
society to an Annenberg Auditorium
audience last night, Sharon Parker,
director of the Office for Multicultural
Development, emphasized the role of
universities in advocating multicultur
alism.
"The university's job is not just to
give students the opportunity to acquire
knowledge. It is to serve society and
develop leaders for the capacity of wis
dom," Parker said.
"Stanford leads the way for other
institutions," she added. "The theme
houses are wonderful. Stanford has
done so much. Stanford can be proud of
the leadership position it has taken."
Parker said she thinks the issue of
multiculturalism is very important and
basic for Stanford students. "The world
that they lead is a world that depends on
multicultural values, and they must
learn it now in college or they must
learn it later."
When asked after her speech how she
would define multiculturalism, Parker
said it is "more than the combination of
pluralism and diversity. It is an environ
ment in which people are recognized
and accepted as individuals to make a
whole society. Multiculturalism is not
just a trend, it is here and everyone
must address it."

She defined pluralism as "two or
more different segments of a population
living or existing harmoniously" and
diversity as "a whole range of different
things such as religion, ideas, back
ground."
Parker, who came to Stanford last
year from the National Institute for
Women of Color in Washington, D.C.,
began the speech by addressing differ
ent traditional gender roles. "Politics is
in everything," she said, adding that she
believes males have shaped the environ
ment and society in which we live.
"There exist only four ways to change
the thinking of modern society," Parker
said. The first method is a revolution or
coup d'etat, the second is to broaden the
views of people, the third is to elect lead
ers with supportive views on multicul
turalism, and the fourth is a combina
tion of the second and third.
"Demographics are important,"
Parker said. Society's "mores influence
ideas on marriage, sexual relations and
childbirth, and technology and innova
tions have helped to change the role of
women in society."
As examples of changing mores,
Parker pointed to attitudes about
divorce, non-marital sex and abortion.
In terms of technological development,
she said contraception has given women
more freedom and power. Other innova
tions such as microwaves, freezers and

fast-food chains have also redefined the
roles of women.
Regarding the national debate about
multiculturalism, Parker said she
believes the historical trend of visualiz
ing racial strife as blacks vs. whites
must be changed.
"It is not always the white minority
versus the black minority," Parker said.
"In some cities, African Americans are
minorities, but in cities like Washington
D.C. they are the majority."
Parker stressed again the importance
of demographics. "People are subjected
to their environment and will think
what they are taught. They can help
themselves, however, by avoiding vio
lent confrontations between races."
She added that she believes firmly in
affirmative action as a necessary compo
nent for multiculturalism. She cited a
pollster who estimated that unless the
United States addresses the issue of
poverty, homelessness, lack of education
and racial strife, there will soon be 20
million or more in the underclass.
"How can the U.S. be a world leader if
within its own country 20 million are
jobless and self-destructive?" Parker
asked.
Parker concluded by saying the
transformation of society towards mul
ticulturalism is not a short-term trend.
"The world is changing and so must its
inhabitants."
