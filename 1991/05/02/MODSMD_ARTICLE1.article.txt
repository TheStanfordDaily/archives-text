# Co-ops will need restaurant licenses
## Surprise visit of health inspector finds violations 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior Staff writer 
Senior Adrianne Estill, like
her fellow Columbae residents,
could have lived anywhere, but
she chose a co-operative — a sin
gular living arrangement where
people cook together, share
house chores and forge a strong,
close-knit community.
But a recent health inspec
tion by Santa Clara County offi
cials at Estill's house has turned
the self-regulated life at Colum
bae and the University's six
other co-ops into a more expen
sive, if not encroaching proposi
tion, various residents say
After Columbae failed a sur
prise health inspection last
month, the county said Stanford
co-ops must obtain a restaurant
health and food license in order
to continue operating. Failure to
obtain the annual $310 license
would be a violation of the Santa
Clara County health code that
could be prosecuted by the dis
trict attorney's office.
"The whole process of trying
to get this license has been
extremely frustrating," said
Estill, a senior, who returned to
Columbae, where she lived
sophomore year. A number of
complications have arisen,
including the question of who —

the residents or the University
— has the authority to sign for
the house.
On April 12, county health
inspector Leonard Lee made an
unannounced visit to Columbae.
Lee said he found "several
uncovered containers, insects
and insect eggs in grain prod
ucts, single scoops used for mul

tiple bins of food and a severely
clogged sink."
"As far as I am concerned the
clogged sink did it," said Lee,
who made the visit without an
invitation from the University.
In their defense, residents
said only one insect was found in
one bin containing grain and
added that the inspector

declined to look in other bins.
The California Uniform
Retail Food Facilities Law, in
compliance with the Food and
Drug Administration guidelines,
requires that establishments
that serve large numbers of peo
ple possess a restaurant license.

Columbae residents prepare lunch in the house kitchen yesterday. After Columbae failed a health
inspection last month, the county said that Stanford co-ops must each obtain a restaurant license.
University living arrange
ments such as regular University
operated houses and dormitories,
and self-operatives, which hire
their own cook, are already
licensed for food preparation for
large numbers of individuals.
Residents of co-ops like Colum
bae, which has been in existence
since 1972, said they never knew
they needed a license for cooking
and food preparation, tasks that
are done by students.
The restaurant license, which
Columbae has applied for, is
something that some residents
said they could do without.
"Lee came at a bad time on a
bad day," said Columbae RA Sofia
Sorensen, a senior. "As far as I am
concerned we were no worse than
any other kitchen across cam
pus."
At the time of Lee's visit, lunch
shift crews had just changed and
some of the containers of food
were left temporarily exposed,
Sorensen said. A work order had
been filed for the clogged sink,
which the University had not

fixed by the time of the inspec
tion, she added.
"When I came back the second
time everything was taken care
of," Lee said of his second visit a
week later. "They did a good job
cleaning up Columbae. Stanford
was very cooperative too."
"We were unaware that the co
ops needed licensing. It caught us
off-guard," said Christy Junker
man, acting assistant director of
the Row.
Other houses said they would
also obtain licenses.
"Hammarskjold has not gotten
a license yet, but we will get one
because we have no choice," said
resident Balazs Kralik, a co-ter
minal student in mathematics.
Lee also inspected Ham
marskjold just days after his visit
to Columbae, but Hammarskjold
residents were warned of his visit
and had time to make minor
adjustments, said Paul Allison, a
house manager there.
Hammarskjold residents said
they are planning to comply with
the inspector's ruling and not
seek legal counseling on the issue.
The language of the Retail
Facilities Law does not specifi
cally include co-operative type
housing arrangements. But Lee

said it is applicable through a
broad interpretation because co
ops use large kitchen wares and
commercial kitchen appliances in
food preparations.
These utensils, the method of
food preparation and the number
of people cooked for make the co
ops "very similar to restaurants,"
Lee said.
"As a food facility that serves
large numbers of residents and
guests they definitely need a
license. Public health is involved
here."
Even if the residents of co-ops
don't like the new rule, it could
stave off future problems.
Lee said that when a food con
cern operates without a license it
sets itself up for liability. In the
case of Stanford's co-ops, the lack
of a license also opens up the Uni
versity for liability in the event of
fire or food poisoning.
In addition, the inspection of
Columbae may have been a bless
ing in disguise, making the
kitchen more efficient and
orderly, Estill said.
"People at Columbae aren't
thrilled about the license,"
Sorensen said. "But it's no big
deal. It is just one more thing we
have to deal with."

guests they definitely need a
license. Public health is involved
here."
Even if the residents of co-ops
don't like the new rule, it could
stave off future problems.
Lee said that when a food con
cern operates without a license it
sets itself up for liability. In the
case of Stanford's co-ops, the lack
of a license also opens up the Uni
versity for liability in the event of
fire or food poisoning.
In addition, the inspection of
Columbae may have been a bless
ing in disguise, making the
kitchen more efficient and
orderly, Estill said.
"People at Columbae aren't
thrilled about the license,"
Sorensen said. "But it's no big
deal. It is just one more thing we
have to deal with."
Senior Adrianne Estill, like
her fellow Columbae residents,
could have lived anywhere, but
she chose a co-operative — a sin
gular living arrangement where
people cook together, share
house chores and forge a strong,
close-knit community.
But a recent health inspec
tion by Santa Clara County offi
cials at Estill's house has turned
the self-regulated life at Colum
bae and the University's six
other co-ops into a more expen
sive, if not encroaching proposi
tion, various residents say
After Columbae failed a sur
prise health inspection last
month, the county said Stanford
co-ops must obtain a restaurant
health and food license in order
to continue operating. Failure to
obtain the annual $310 license
would be a violation of the Santa
Clara County health code that
could be prosecuted by the dis
trict attorney's office.
"The whole process of trying
to get this license has been
extremely frustrating," said
Estill, a senior, who returned to
Columbae, where she lived
sophomore year. A number of
complications have arisen,
including the question of who —

the residents or the University
— has the authority to sign for
the house.
On April 12, county health
inspector Leonard Lee made an
unannounced visit to Columbae.
Lee said he found "several
uncovered containers, insects
and insect eggs in grain prod
ucts, single scoops used for mul

tiple bins of food and a severely
clogged sink."
"As far as I am concerned the
clogged sink did it," said Lee,
who made the visit without an
invitation from the University.
In their defense, residents
said only one insect was found in
one bin containing grain and
added that the inspector

declined to look in other bins.
The California Uniform
Retail Food Facilities Law, in
compliance with the Food and
Drug Administration guidelines,
requires that establishments
that serve large numbers of peo
ple possess a restaurant license.


Ra)iv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Columbae residents prepare lunch in the house kitchen yesterday. After Columbae failed a health
inspection last month, the county said that Stanford co-ops must each obtain a restaurant license.
University living arrange
ments such as regular University
operated houses and dormitories,
and self-operatives, which hire
their own cook, are already
licensed for food preparation for
large numbers of individuals.
Residents of co-ops like Colum
bae, which has been in existence
since 1972, said they never knew
they needed a license for cooking
and food preparation, tasks that
are done by students.
The restaurant license, which
Columbae has applied for, is
something that some residents
said they could do without.
"Lee came at a bad time on a
bad day," said Columbae RA Sofia
Sorensen, a senior. "As far as I am
concerned we were no worse than
any other kitchen across cam
pus."
At the time of Lee's visit, lunch
shift crews had just changed and
some of the containers of food
were left temporarily exposed,
Sorensen said. A work order had
been filed for the clogged sink,
which the University had not

fixed by the time of the inspec
tion, she added.
"When I came back the second
time everything was taken care
of," Lee said of his second visit a
week later. "They did a good job
cleaning up Columbae. Stanford
was very cooperative too."
"We were unaware that the co
ops needed licensing. It caught us
off-guard," said Christy Junker
man, acting assistant director of
the Row.
Other houses said they would
also obtain licenses.
"Hammarskjold has not gotten
a license yet, but we will get one
because we have no choice," said
resident Balazs Kralik, a co-ter
minal student in mathematics.
Lee also inspected Ham
marskjold just days after his visit
to Columbae, but Hammarskjold
residents were warned of his visit
and had time to make minor
adjustments, said Paul Allison, a
house manager there.
Hammarskjold residents said
they are planning to comply with
the inspector's ruling and not
seek legal counseling on the issue.
The language of the Retail
Facilities Law does not specifi
cally include co-operative type
housing arrangements. But Lee

said it is applicable through a
broad interpretation because co
ops use large kitchen wares and
commercial kitchen appliances in
food preparations.
These utensils, the method of
food preparation and the number
of people cooked for make the co
ops "very similar to restaurants,"
Lee said.
"As a food facility that serves
large numbers of residents and
guests they definitely need a
license. Public health is involved
here."
Even if the residents of co-ops
don't like the new rule, it could
stave off future problems.

cern operates without a license it
