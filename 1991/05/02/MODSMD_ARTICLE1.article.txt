# Co-ops will need restaurant licenses
## Surprise visit of health inspector finds violations 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior Staff writer 
Senior Adrianne Estill, like
her fellow Columbae residents,
could have lived anywhere, but
she chose a co-operative — a sin
gular living arrangement where
people cook together, share
house chores and forge a strong,
close-knit community.
But a recent health inspec
tion by Santa Clara County offi
cials at Estill's house has turned
the self-regulated life at Colum
bae and the University's six
other co-ops into a more expen
sive, if not encroaching proposi
tion, various residents say
After Columbae failed a sur
prise health inspection last
month, the county said Stanford
co-ops must obtain a restaurant
health and food license in order
to continue operating. Failure to
obtain the annual $310 license
would be a violation of the Santa
Clara County health code that
could be prosecuted by the dis
trict attorney's office.
"The whole process of trying
to get this license has been
extremely frustrating," said
Estill, a senior, who returned to
Columbae, where she lived
sophomore year. A number of
complications have arisen,
including the question of who —

the residents or the University
— has the authority to sign for
the house.
On April 12, county health
inspector Leonard Lee made an
unannounced visit to Columbae.
Lee said he found "several
uncovered containers, insects
and insect eggs in grain prod
ucts, single scoops used for mul

tiple bins of food and a severely
clogged sink."
"As far as I am concerned the
clogged sink did it," said Lee,
who made the visit without an
invitation from the University.
In their defense, residents
said only one insect was found in
one bin containing grain and
added that the inspector

declined to look in other bins.
The California Uniform
Retail Food Facilities Law, in
compliance with the Food and
Drug Administration guidelines,
requires that establishments
that serve large numbers of peo
ple possess a restaurant license.

Columbae residents prepare lunch in the house kitchen yesterday. After Columbae failed a health
inspection last month, the county said that Stanford co-ops must each obtain a restaurant license.
