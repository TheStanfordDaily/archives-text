# Rice addresses Soviet future
## Speech describes challenges she faced as Bush adviser 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Condoleezza Rice, associate professor of political
science, spoke last night on the future of U.S.-Soviet
relations and the role that she played in forging ties
between the two superpowers during her two-year
stint as an advisor in the Bush administration.
Rice returned from Washington, D.C. last month,
where she was director of Soviet and Eastern Euro
pean affairs in the National Security Council.
The address, delivered at Kresge Auditorium,
marked her first speaking appearance since coming
"home to Stanford."
She devoted much of her lecture to describing the
challenges she faced at a time when communism was
collapsing in central Eastern Europe.
Rice described the period as an "incredible time"
in history and one that nobody could have foreseen.
"I went to bed one night with a socialist Czechoslo
vakia, and woke up with a democratic one," she said.
The quick collapse of communism thwarted
assumptions of a divided world order and "threw the
policy-making process into a tizzy," said Rice.
It also threw Rice's life into somewhat of a tizzy.
She said that, on good days, she arrived at her office
at 7 a.m. and left by 9 p.m. She characterized the job
as "a very intense experience."
Of the problems Rice encountered in her post,
German unification was one of the touchiest. She
said, "It was not inevitable that the Soviet Union
would accept German unification."
She described a meeting with her Soviet counter
part, in which he told her, "East Germany was ours,
West Germany was yours," conveying his concern
over the strategic shift of balance. The Soviets acqui
esced to the unification only after the nature of
NATO had been transformed and after Germany
agreed to finance the Soviet troops' exodus from
East Germany, she said.
Rice said that during her first year in office, U.S.-
Soviet relations were "anything but a problem." She
added that this amicable relationship helped certain
Eastern European countries — Poland, Hungary,
East Germany and Czechoslovakia — attain free-

However, beginning in the fall of 1990, internal
problems caused the Soviet Union to turn to tradi
tional elements of power — the KGB, the Commu
nist Party and the Soviet Army — calling into ques
tion the reformist "New Thinking" program that
had been responsible for close U.S.-Soviet relations.
The Bush administration now faces a much more
difficult task than it did when she held her position,
she said. As reforms seem to have come to a halt, and
the leadership is extremely shaky, the course of for
eign policy is difficult to navigate.
Rice said the United States should help the Soviet
Union improve its economy by providing the country
with the technical expertise it is sorely lacking.
However, Rice cautioned that the United States
should not interfere with Soviet politics. The admin
istration must resist pressures to select Boris Yeltsin
over President Mikhail Gorbachev, or vice versa, said
Rice. She explained that much of the politics is
"going on under the table" and, since the U.S. gov
ernment is not privy to the secret arrangements
forged behind Kremlin walls, it should "stay out."
Rice formulated an equation to express the extent
of the Soviet Union's problems. "Take the Great
Depression and multiply it by 100. Add to it the polit
ical problems between '68 and Watergate. Then add
to that the question of whether the Union should
stay together before the Civil War and multiply it by
100."
Although she acknowledged that it was indeed
difficult to retain optimism considering the current
situation in the Soviet Union, she cautioned against
abandoning hope.
People should keep perspective on how far the
country has come in the past five years, she said. She
concluded her speech on a positive note: "Demo
cratic principles are strong enough that once people
are exposed to the light of it, no people would go fully
back."
Rice's speech was part of a two-day symposium,
"The New Soviet Union: Implications for the United
States and Germany," sponsored by the Institute for
International Studies and the International Rela
tions Society.
