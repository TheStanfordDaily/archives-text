Angolan civil war to end
ESTORIL, Portugal (AP) — The Angolan
government and the U.S.-hacked guerrilla force
it has battled since 1975 initialed agreements
yesterday to end one of Africa's longest and
bloodiest wars.
The 1,500-page accords call for an interna
tionally monitored cease-fire to take effect in
June and for the first multiparty elections in
the southern African nation in the fall of 1992.
The accords were initialed for the rebels by
Jeremias Chitunda, vice president of the
National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, or UNITA; and for Angola's govern
ment by Territorial Administration Minister
Lopo do Nascimento.
Chief mediator Jose Manuel Durao Barroso
of Portugal also marked the preliminary agree
ment, to be formally signed later this month by
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi and President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola.
Major banks lower prime rale
NEW YORK (AP) — Major banks yesterday
cut their prime lending rates by half a point, to
a three-year low of 8.5 percent, a day after the
Federal Reserve trimmed two key interest rates
to help pull the nation out of recession.
Economists said the lower rates should help
revive the sagging economy but warned that
cheaper credit alone wasn't enough to turn the
economy around.
It was the third cut this year in the prime,
which is used to calculate a variety of consumer
and business loans and reflects a bank's cost of
borrowing money. •
President Bush quickly praised the hanks'
action: "That's going to be very good for the
economy." He predicted the recession would be
over "fairly soon."
Turkey expels British soldiers
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey yesterday

cial complaint that a group of British soldiers
had manhandled the chief of the town of
Semdinli, the radio said.
The troops were asked to depart Turkey as
quickly as possible, the radio said, and 30
British soldiers later left the area they had
been stationed, near the Yesilova refugee camp,
close to the Iranian and Iraqi borders.
