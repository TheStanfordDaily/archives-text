EAST OF AMADIYAH, Iraq(AP) -
Allied military forces will expand their
security zone in northern Iraq today,
pushing 25 miles eastward to secure
an area for a second camp for return
ing Iraqi Kurdish refugees, officials
said.
Meanwhile, elite American recon
naissance forces probed even deeper
into Iraqi territory in missions beyond
the limits of the security zone.
Allied forces told Iraqi representa
tives yesterday to withdraw their secu
rity forces from the area near
Amadivah and Suriya, and by nightfall
there were indications they had begun
to leave, said military spokesperson Lt.
Col. Bob Flocke.

Only a small "indigenous" police
force will be allowed to remain in
Amadivah, said an allied military
statement issued yesterday. U.S. offi
cials noted that the new security zone
encompasses Saddam Hussein's sum
mer palace.
"This is a careful movement by the
combined task force to provide the
refugees the necessary sense of secu
rity to leave the mountains and either
enter the second temporary commu
nity or return home," said U.S. Lt.
(Jen. John Shalikashvili, the comman
der of the allied forces, in the state
ment.
"While we do not cxpect any inter
ference, we are prepared to take the

steps necessary to accomplish this
humanitarian mission," he said.
Saddam's palace is just west of
Amadiyah. The house itself will not be
occupied by allied troops, Flocke said.
"We will allow the Iraqis to retain a
palace guard. But we will search it I the
palace and surrounding building com
plex! for heavy weapons," he said.
Yesterday, accompanied by an Asso
ciated Press reporter, U.S. Marines
scouted the mountains and valleys
even farther east, near Iran. Army sol
diers were dropped south of the secu
rity zone, outside the provincial capital
of Dohuk.
Dozens of similar missions have
been launched into other remote areas

by highly trained Marine, Navy, and
Army personnel, according to U.S.
Marine Corp. Maj. Rick Raftery, who
runs the reconnaissance operations.
The zone has been established as a
safe haven for the 800,000 Kurdish
refugees who fled to the mountains
between Iraq and Turkey in March,
escaping Saddam's crackdown on their
rebellion.
By midday yesterday, about 9,000
refugees had left their ramshackle
mountain camps, where hundreds of
people have died of hunger and expo
sure. They were going either to the
allied-run camp in the Iraqi border
town of Zakho or returning to their
homes.
