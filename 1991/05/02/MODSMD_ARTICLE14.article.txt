MANPURA, Bangladesh (AP) — As many as
25,000 people may have died in a devastating cyclone
t hat rampaged across the southeastern coast of this
impoverished nation, a news agency reported yester
day
The government said it knew of only about 3,000
deaths in Tuesday's eight-hour storm, hut acknowl
edged its reports were incomplete due to severe com
munications problems. Many of the affected islands
were still under water.
United News of Bangladesh, quoting radio
reports received in Dhaka, said 25,000 people died
mostly on the coastal islands of Kutubdia,
Maheshkali, Sandwip and Chakori that are home to
hundreds of thousands of farmers and fishermen.
Tens of thousands of people were missing, the news
agency said.
A cyclone that struck the same area in 1970
claimed about 500,000 lives. Bangladesh gained
independence from Pakistan a year later.
The government began an operation to provide
essentials to the millions of survivors, officials said.
At least 12 helicopters dispatched from Dhaka flew
in and out of the affected area, dropping packets of
food, bottles of water and clothing, they said.
Relief Secretary Hashimuddin Ahmed said the
government could confirm only 2,977 deaths from
the storm, which at its height included wind
whipped 20-foot waves sweeping over the low-lving
coastal islands. Most of the toll was gathered from
officials on the mainland, he said.
An official with the Red Crescent, the Muslim
equivalent of the Red Cross, also said the death toll
could he as high as 25,000.
"Based on the reports from our officials, it's pos
sible so many people have died," said the official,
who asked his name not be used.
