## Rap's angry underclass 
### 
Cops hate kids, kids hate cops, cops
kill kids with warning shots. What is
crime and what is not; what is justice? I
think I forgot. We buy weapons to keep us
strong. Reagan sends guns where they
don't belong. The controversy is thick
and the drag is strong. But no matter the
lies, we all know who is wrong.
— Ice T's "Squeeze the Trigger"
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT
rap has revolutionized modern music.
Rap has infused into it a deep social
consciousness that outdoes anything that
has come before it.
Rap has produced some of the most
creative and innovative music today, as
well as some of the most provocative and
insightful music to come out in a long
time. It is angry, deep and bold.
One of the most amazing aspects of rap
music has to do with the contrast
between the people who create it and the
audience that listens to it. It is urban
poetry made by and for people who don't
relate to "high culture" or ascribe to its
most basic principles. Yet, a large portion
of rap fans is composed of just the oppo
site type of people — people who can and
do relate to high culture.
It takes an "urban sensibility" to
appreciate some of the themes present in
harder rap — but all rap has a creative
boldness and appeal that reaches a
broader audience.
The social message in rap is seldom
subtle. Rap expresses itself honestly,
sometimes crudely, and is notoriously
anti-establishment. It is the expression of
the rage and frustration of a subculture

that feels abandoned and abused. And it
is angry.
Still, inanv people listen to and enjoy
rap — even some of its more "hardcore"
versions — and somehow miss the mes
sage in its content. They superficially dis
miss the lyrics as juvenile and unsophisti
cated because they are often very simplis
tic and funny.
The persistent braggadocio attitude of
the rap artists, though meant to be
humorous, is at times annoying. Some
claim that harder rap is simply sexist and
violent and refuse to see any social signif
icance in it. They don't seem to realize
that sexism and violence characterize
much of today's music and are by no
means exclusive to rap.
But social consciousness in rap is hard
to miss.
I think rap is an expression of a move
ment among the urban subculture. The
movement is a reaction to the Reagan era
and to the crisis that it precipitated in the
inner cities: the lack of educational and
career opportunities and the cutback in
social services, as well as deepening crime
and poverty.
Most young people from this subcul
ture are portrayed in the media as shift
less and apathetic. Rap music paints a dif
ferent picture of this group. They are
frustrated and angry at a system that
doesn't even try to incorporate them.
Rap attempts to give voice to these
people's grievances, and to do it without
assuming the dominant culture's lan
guage or catering to its sensibilities. I
think there is a sense of self-satisfaction
in knowing that rap offends mainstream

culture. This is the most rebellious aspect
of rap. It is its way of protesting a system
that its artists and intended audience feel
powerless to control. Music is sometimes
the means to self-empowerment, and rap
music is powerful.
Maybe that is why people fear it and
refuse to give it air time. A lot of the more
controversial artists, even those that sell
a lot of records, like Public Enemy, Boogie
Down Productions and NWA, are rarely
played on the radio.
Even at Stanford, most campus disc
jockeys refuse to play NWA's "Fuck the
Police," a song with a clear social message
— and an understandable one — from a
musical group based in Compton, Califor
nia, that has to deal with the Los Angeles
Sheriffs Department.
"We don't like profanity," is the usual
excuse for not playing it, although it is
hard for me to believe, because a lot of
these DJs play some of Too Live Crew's
nastiest early cuts.
Most of the rap that gets a lot of air
play is devoid of the social commentary of
the more underground rap music.
The more mainstream pop rap artists,
like MC Hammer, Young MC, Tone Loc
and Vanilla Ice, have introduced America
to the music of its urban subculture but
without the message that often comes
along with it.
