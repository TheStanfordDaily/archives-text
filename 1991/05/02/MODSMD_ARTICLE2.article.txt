# ASSU ties with lobby group questioned
## But supporters say it's the only way to fight for financial aid 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As students vote on the referendum to cre
ate an ASSU financial-aid office in today's
runoff election, several senators are raising
questions about the ASSU's connection with a
national student lobby organization.
After students rejected the proposed ASSU
lobby office, organizers placed the financial-aid
office referendum on the runoff ballot because
they say the future of financial aid is at a crit
ical juncture. In addition, students expressed
overwhelming support in the general election
for having ASSU work on financial aid issues,
organizers said.
The non-binding referendum calls on the
ASSU Senate to create the office for the
"express and sole purpose of advocating for
increased financial aid at the state and federal

levels." To lobby effectively, the senate will
"maintain a membership in the United States
Student Association and participate specifi
cally on financial aid issues."
Although the ASSLf has been a member for
several years, many students say they have
never heard of the association and wonder why
it and the lobby office have become big issues
now.
Several campus groups have criticized both
the national organization and the election pro
cess for the Stanford office. Hut supporters sav
the financial-aid office is the only way for
Stanford students to have an impact on the
federal debate on the reauthorization of gov
ernment funding for financial aid.
The association's history-
Pounded after World War II by returning
soldiers, the United States Student Associa

tion is fighting to "increase access to highe
education on the federal level," said Pierr
Rarolette, the membership service coordinato
for the Washington, D.C.-based association.
"Our main objective is to improve federa
financial aid," Barolette added. "We spend ove
90 percent of our time working solely on finan
cial-aid issues."
As the only student advocacy group with i
full-time Washington lobbyist, the organiza
tion also plans to open a regional office ir
Sacramento to lobby the California Legisla
tu re next year.
It now represents more than 300 commu
nity and four-year colleges, including man}
state college associations, Barolette said.
The association has worked on other cam
pus-related issues, including supporting the
passage of the Disability Rights
Act, the Civil Rights Act and the
Violence Against Women Act. The
group also actively lobbied against
the Persian Gulf war.
The ASSU has been involved
with the association for five years,
said senator Naomi Onaga, a
sponsor of the financial-aid office
referendum. The ASSU currently
pays $1,000 per year in dues to
the national organization, and
supporters here hope to double
that amount next year to support
the Sacramento office.
Onaga and freshman Danny
Ruderman are currently two of 60
voting members on the associa
tion's national board of directors,
and former Council of Presidents
member Stacey Leyton is the West
Coast representative of the orga
nization. Leyton completed her
masters degree in history last
October.
The association organized a
joint congressional hearing on the
reauthorization of federal finan
cial aid during its March legisla
tive conference in Washington,
D.C. Five Stanford students par
ticipated in the conference, and
junior Brian Hooker testified at
the hearing.
The association held a regional
hearing at UCLA last weekend on
the reauthorization of financial
aid, and another meeting is sched
uled for UC-Davis on May 11.
The organization's efforts on
financial aid have generally
received widespread support,
from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., to Robert Huff, Stanford's
director of financial aid.
And the proposed financial-aid
office at Stanford will work with
the national organization to lobby
both the federal and state govern
ments and increase the involve
ment of Stanford students in the
financial aid issue.
But not everyone in the ASSL T
expresses the same support for
the group.
Current Stanford controversy
The referendum in today's
runoff election has outraged some
members of Students United for
Fair Elections, a campus group
that organized last year's recall
election.
"The threat to financial aid is
being used as a pretext to create a
lobbying organization," charged
Larry Augustin, a member of the
group. "This issue appeared on
the ballot once. The ASSU Senate
ruled that the students need
another chance to make the right
decision."
But Onaga said the urgency of
the financial aid issue and the
overwhelming voter approval for
the referendum asking the ASSU
to allocate resources to financial
aid lobbying merit a swift
response.

Members of the national orga
nization also argue that the finan
cial-aid office must be approved
now for Stanford students to have
any impact at all.
"The question everyone must
ask themselves is 'Is it important
to have a national representative
to lobby on issues such as finan
cial aid?'," Leyton said. "If it is,
then Stanford must work with
USSA."
Onaga said the senate could
have created a financial-aid office
on its own in next year's budget
but she decided a referendum
would be "more responsive and
accountable to the students."

The scope question
"It is clear that the ASSU
should be accountable to stu
dents," Onaga said. According to
the new referendum, the finan
cial-aid office would "only work on
financial aid."
But opponents of the financial
aid office claim that Stanford's
support of the association can
never really be limited to working
on financial aid.
"Whenever USSA takes a posi
tion, it does it as a group that rep
resents 3.5 million students," said
graduate senator Doug Bone, who
wrote a statement in the election
handbook opposing the referen
dum. "No one will say, 'Oh, but I
believe that most schools are only
in (the organization) for financial
aid and do not support this policy'.
. . . They are taking a position for
Stanford, too."
Julius Davis, president of the
association, said any position the
organization takes will "implicitly
represent" Stanford students.
"But what someone says in word
ing is not the main thing. What
counts is what you do to actually
work on the issue," Davis added.
A lack of information
Some ASSU senators said it is
hard to find information on the
association.
For instance, Onaga and other
organizers of the financial-aid
office referendum have often been
unable to answer The Daily's and
senators' questions about the
national organization. They rec
ommended that interested people
either call the national office or
wait until Leyton came to campus
last Monday — leaving many
questions first asked in March
unanswered until then.
"I find that odd and discourag
ing," said Bone. "I have been try
ing to find out more information
for some time now and there seem

to be many obstacles."
The association also refuses to
make a list of member schools
available because "it might be
used as a mailing list," according
to Alicia Ybarra, an association
staff member and 1990 Stanford
graduate.
"1 find this surprising that
even now no one will provide us
with a list of member schools,"
Bone said. "Why can't a member
school know who else is a member
of the organization?"
But Leyton said this was "quite
normal for national organiza
tions" because many businesses
"would really like to know who

our members are."
Different people within the
organization also give different
estimates on its size, which
Augustin said "bothers" him.
Pamphlets describing the orga
nization say it has "more than 300
member student governments."
Ybarra said the association now
boasts 400 member schools. But
Davis said 350 was a more reason
able number.
The number of private-school
members is also unclear. Official
estimates range from six private
schools to 20, leading some sena
tors to raise questions about how
representative the organization
will be for Stanford students.
What funding does the
organization support?
Engineering graduate students
have expressed concern about the
group's position on research
funds from the military. Graduate
senator-elect Neil Crellin said he
thinks the association appears to
be working against the involve
ment of the Department of
Defense in university research
labs.
Leyton, Ybarra and Davis all
said the organization has "no offi
cial policy" on research funding
from the military. Leyton said the
only policy of that kind involves
opposition to military recruit
ment, which for many students is
the only way to pay for college.
But an association flier
obtained by The Daily expresses
concerns about governmental
research funding that makes "our
universities frighteningly sucepti
ble (sic) to the interests of the mil
itary, and its associated industrial
complex.
"Increased costs of higher edu
cation coupled with the shifting of
student aid from grant-based to
loan-based aid constrains career
choices. Students who would oth
erwise choose a field of study in

the arts or education are being
forced by the fiscal considerations
towards degrees in the sciences
and engineering, fields which are
dominated by Department of
Defense funding," the flier contin
ues.
Some graduate senators said
they were very concerned about
both this position and the confu
sion between Leyton's statement
and the flier.
"It is my opinion that Ithe asso
ciation] has worked to oppose cer
tain types of financial aid that it
does not believe to be correct,"
said senator Augustin, an engi
neering graduate student whose
research is funded by a military
grant. "Would USSA work toward
increasing financial aid for me? I
don't think so."
"I fear even more that they will
work to decrease my funding,"
Augustin added.
Leyton insisted that the flier
refers only to expanding the
options for funding grants to
areas not supported by the mili
tary.
Students First COP slate mem
ber John Overdeck also said the
organization's biggest concern
about President Bush's financial
aid proposal involves delayed dis
bursement of Stafford loans at
institutions with student-loan
default rates in excess of 30 per
cent. Both Overdeck and Leyton
agree this provision would not
apply to Stanford.
The politics of its leaders
This group of senators also
questions the political agendas of
the leaders of the association.
For instance, at a recent senate
meeting Overdeck questioned a
trip Leyton made to Cuba in
December. While in Havana, Ley
ton attended a meeting of the
International Union of Students
and the Federation of University
Students in Cuba and heard a
three-hour speech by Fidel Cas
tro.
Leyton said she went as an
"American university student"
and Davis said the association did
not send her or pay for her trip.
The association's constitution
prevents membership in any
international student organiza
tion.
At a separate public meeting
with Leyton and Ybarra, Bone
questioned the involvement of
association leaders in the now
defunct League of Revolutionary
Struggle, a Marxist-Leninist orga
nization, and the Unity National
Organizing Committee.
Leyton said the Unity commit
tee is a national multiracial orga
nization working for democracy
and progressive change.
Ybarra and Leyton said some
leaders of the association are
members of these groups but
"there are no ties in any way
between these organizations,"
and "individuals' private political
beliefs are not part of the election
process."

opposition to military recruit
ment, which for many students is
the only way to pay for college.
But an association flier
obtained by The Daily expresses
concerns about governmental
research funding that makes "our
universities frighteningly sucepti
ble (sic) to the interests of the mil
itary, and its associated industrial
complex.
"Increased costs of higher edu
cation coupled with the shifting of
student aid from grant-based to
loan-based aid constrains career
choices. Students who would oth
erwise choose a field of study in

the arts or education are being
forced by the fiscal considerations
towards degrees in the sciences
and engineering, fields which are
dominated by Department of
Defense funding," the flier contin
ues.
Some graduate senators said
they were very concerned about
both this position and the confu
sion between Leyton's statement
and the flier.
"It is my opinion that Ithe asso
ciation] has worked to oppose cer
tain types of financial aid that it
does not believe to be correct,"
said senator Augustin, an engi
neering graduate student whose
research is funded by a military
grant. "Would USSA work toward
increasing financial aid for me? I
don't think so."
"I fear even more that they will
work to decrease my funding,"
Augustin added.
Leyton insisted that the flier
refers only to expanding the
options for funding grants to
areas not supported by the mili
tary.
Students First COP slate mem
ber John Overdeck also said the
organization's biggest concern
about President Bush's financial
aid proposal involves delayed dis
bursement of Stafford loans at
institutions with student-loan
default rates in excess of 30 per
cent. Both Overdeck and Leyton
agree this provision would not
apply to Stanford.
The politics of its leaders
This group of senators also
questions the political agendas of
the leaders of the association.
For instance, at a recent senate
meeting Overdeck questioned a
trip Leyton made to Cuba in
December. While in Havana, Ley
ton attended a meeting of the
International Union of Students
and the Federation of University
Students in Cuba and heard a
three-hour speech by Fidel Cas
tro.
Leyton said she went as an
"American university student"
and Davis said the association did
not send her or pay for her trip.
The association's constitution
prevents membership in any
international student organiza
tion.
At a separate public meeting
with Leyton and Ybarra, Bone
questioned the involvement of
association leaders in the now
defunct League of Revolutionary
Struggle, a Marxist-Leninist orga
nization, and the Unity National
Organizing Committee.
Leyton said the Unity commit
tee is a national multiracial orga
nization working for democracy
and progressive change.
Ybarra and Leyton said some
leaders of the association are
members of these groups but
"there are no ties in any way
between these organizations,"
and "individuals' private political
beliefs are not part of the election
process."

As students vote on the referendum to cre
ate an ASSU financial-aid office in today's
runoff election, several senators are raising
questions about the ASSU's connection with a
national student lobby organization.
After students rejected the proposed ASSU
lobby office, organizers placed the financial-aid
office referendum on the runoff ballot because
they say the future of financial aid is at a crit
ical juncture. In addition, students expressed
overwhelming support in the general election
for having ASSU work on financial aid issues,
organizers said.
The non-binding referendum calls on the
ASSU Senate to create the office for the
"express and sole purpose of advocating for
increased financial aid at the state and federal

levels." To lobby effectively, the senate will
"maintain a membership in the United States
Student Association and participate specifi
cally on financial aid issues."
Although the ASSLf has been a member for
several years, many students say they have
never heard of the association and wonder why
it and the lobby office have become big issues
now.
Several campus groups have criticized both
the national organization and the election pro
cess for the Stanford office. Hut supporters sav
the financial-aid office is the only way for
Stanford students to have an impact on the
federal debate on the reauthorization of gov
ernment funding for financial aid.
The association's history-
Pounded after World War II by returning
soldiers, the United States Student Associa

tion is fighting to "increase access to highe
education on the federal level," said Pierr
Rarolette, the membership service coordinato
for the Washington, D.C.-based association.
"Our main objective is to improve federa
financial aid," Barolette added. "We spend ove
90 percent of our time working solely on finan
cial-aid issues."
As the only student advocacy group with i
full-time Washington lobbyist, the organiza
tion also plans to open a regional office ir
Sacramento to lobby the California Legisla
tu re next year.
It now represents more than 300 commu
nity and four-year colleges, including man}
state college associations, Barolette said.
The association has worked on other cam
pus-related issues, including supporting the
passage of the Disability Rights
Act, the Civil Rights Act and the
Violence Against Women Act. The
group also actively lobbied against
the Persian Gulf war.
The ASSU has been involved
with the association for five years,
said senator Naomi Onaga, a
sponsor of the financial-aid office
referendum. The ASSU currently
pays $1,000 per year in dues to
the national organization, and
supporters here hope to double
that amount next year to support
the Sacramento office.
Onaga and freshman Danny
Ruderman are currently two of 60
voting members on the associa
tion's national board of directors,
and former Council of Presidents
member Stacey Leyton is the West
Coast representative of the orga
nization. Leyton completed her
masters degree in history last
October.
The association organized a
joint congressional hearing on the
reauthorization of federal finan
cial aid during its March legisla
tive conference in Washington,
D.C. Five Stanford students par
ticipated in the conference, and
junior Brian Hooker testified at
the hearing.
The association held a regional
hearing at UCLA last weekend on
the reauthorization of financial
aid, and another meeting is sched
uled for UC-Davis on May 11.
The organization's efforts on
financial aid have generally
received widespread support,
from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., to Robert Huff, Stanford's
director of financial aid.
And the proposed financial-aid
office at Stanford will work with
the national organization to lobby
both the federal and state govern
ments and increase the involve
ment of Stanford students in the
financial aid issue.
But not everyone in the ASSL T
expresses the same support for
the group.
Current Stanford controversy
The referendum in today's
runoff election has outraged some
members of Students United for
Fair Elections, a campus group
that organized last year's recall
election.
"The threat to financial aid is
being used as a pretext to create a
lobbying organization," charged
Larry Augustin, a member of the
group. "This issue appeared on
the ballot once. The ASSU Senate
ruled that the students need
another chance to make the right
decision."
But Onaga said the urgency of
the financial aid issue and the
overwhelming voter approval for
the referendum asking the ASSU
to allocate resources to financial
aid lobbying merit a swift
response.

Members of the national orga
nization also argue that the finan
cial-aid office must be approved
now for Stanford students to have
any impact at all.
"The question everyone must
ask themselves is 'Is it important
to have a national representative
to lobby on issues such as finan
cial aid?'," Leyton said. "If it is,
then Stanford must work with
USSA."
Onaga said the senate could
have created a financial-aid office
on its own in next year's budget
but she decided a referendum
would be "more responsive and
accountable to the students."

The scope question
"It is clear that the ASSU
should be accountable to stu
dents," Onaga said. According to
the new referendum, the finan
cial-aid office would "only work on
financial aid."
But opponents of the financial
aid office claim that Stanford's
support of the association can
never really be limited to working
on financial aid.
"Whenever USSA takes a posi
tion, it does it as a group that rep
resents 3.5 million students," said
graduate senator Doug Bone, who
wrote a statement in the election
handbook opposing the referen
dum. "No one will say, 'Oh, but I
believe that most schools are only
in (the organization) for financial
aid and do not support this policy'.
. . . They are taking a position for
Stanford, too."
Julius Davis, president of the
association, said any position the
organization takes will "implicitly
represent" Stanford students.
"But what someone says in word
ing is not the main thing. What
counts is what you do to actually
work on the issue," Davis added.
A lack of information
Some ASSU senators said it is
hard to find information on the
association.
For instance, Onaga and other
organizers of the financial-aid
office referendum have often been
unable to answer The Daily's and
senators' questions about the
national organization. They rec
ommended that interested people
either call the national office or
wait until Leyton came to campus
last Monday — leaving many
questions first asked in March
unanswered until then.
"I find that odd and discourag
ing," said Bone. "I have been try
ing to find out more information
for some time now and there seem

to be many obstacles."
The association also refuses to
make a list of member schools
available because "it might be
used as a mailing list," according
to Alicia Ybarra, an association
staff member and 1990 Stanford
graduate.
"1 find this surprising that
even now no one will provide us
with a list of member schools,"
Bone said. "Why can't a member
school know who else is a member
of the organization?"
But Leyton said this was "quite
normal for national organiza
tions" because many businesses
"would really like to know who

our members are."
Different people within the
organization also give different
estimates on its size, which
Augustin said "bothers" him.
Pamphlets describing the orga
nization say it has "more than 300
member student governments."
Ybarra said the association now
boasts 400 member schools. But
Davis said 350 was a more reason
able number.
The number of private-school
members is also unclear. Official
estimates range from six private
schools to 20, leading some sena
tors to raise questions about how
representative the organization
will be for Stanford students.
What funding does the
organization support?
Engineering graduate students
have expressed concern about the
group's position on research
funds from the military. Graduate
senator-elect Neil Crellin said he
thinks the association appears to
be working against the involve
ment of the Department of
Defense in university research
labs.
Leyton, Ybarra and Davis all
said the organization has "no offi
cial policy" on research funding
from the military. Leyton said the
only policy of that kind involves
opposition to military recruit
ment, which for many students is
the only way to pay for college.
But an association flier
obtained by The Daily expresses
concerns about governmental
research funding that makes "our

aid office claim that Stanford's
support of the association can
never really be limited to working
on financial aid.
"Whenever USSA takes a posi
tion, it does it as a group that rep
resents 3.5 million students," said
graduate senator Doug Bone, who
wrote a statement in the election
handbook opposing the referen
dum. "No one will say, 'Oh, but I
believe that most schools are only
in (the organization) for financial
aid and do not support this policy'.
. . . They are taking a position for
Stanford, too."
Julius Davis, president of the
association, said any position the
organization takes will "implicitly
represent" Stanford students.
"But what someone says in word
ing is not the main thing. What
counts is what you do to actually
work on the issue," Davis added.
A lack of information
Some ASSU senators said it is
hard to find information on the
association.
For instance, Onaga and other
organizers of the financial-aid
office referendum have often been
unable to answer The Daily's and
senators' questions about the
national organization. They rec
ommended that interested people
either call the national office or
wait until Leyton came to campus
last Monday — leaving many
questions first asked in March
unanswered until then.
"I find that odd and discourag
ing," said Bone. "I have been try
ing to find out more information
for some time now and there seem

to be many obstacles."
The association also refuses to
make a list of member schools
available because "it might be
used as a mailing list," according
to Alicia Ybarra, an association
staff member and 1990 Stanford
graduate.
"1 find this surprising that
even now no one will provide us
with a list of member schools,"
Bone said. "Why can't a member
school know who else is a member
of the organization?"
But Leyton said this was "quite
normal for national organiza
tions" because many businesses
"would really like to know who

our members are."
Different people within the
organization also give different
estimates on its size, which
Augustin said "bothers" him.
Pamphlets describing the orga
nization say it has "more than 300
member student governments."
Ybarra said the association now
boasts 400 member schools. But
Davis said 350 was a more reason
able number.
The number of private-school
members is also unclear. Official
estimates range from six private
schools to 20, leading some sena
tors to raise questions about how
representative the organization
will be for Stanford students.
What funding does the
organization support?
Engineering graduate students
have expressed concern about the
group's position on research
funds from the military. Graduate
senator-elect Neil Crellin said he
thinks the association appears to
be working against the involve
ment of the Department of
Defense in university research
labs.
Leyton, Ybarra and Davis all
said the organization has "no offi
cial policy" on research funding
from the military. Leyton said the
only policy of that kind involves
opposition to military recruit
ment, which for many students is
the only way to pay for college.
But an association flier
obtained by The Daily expresses
concerns about governmental
research funding that makes "our
universities frighteningly sucepti
ble (sic) to the interests of the mil
itary, and its associated industrial
complex.
"Increased costs of higher edu
cation coupled with the shifting of
student aid from grant-based to
loan-based aid constrains career
choices. Students who would oth
erwise choose a field of study in

the arts or education are being
forced by the fiscal considerations
towards degrees in the sciences
and engineering, fields which are
dominated by Department of
Defense funding," the flier contin
ues.
Some graduate senators said
they were very concerned about
both this position and the confu
sion between Leyton's statement
and the flier.
"It is my opinion that Ithe asso
ciation] has worked to oppose cer
tain types of financial aid that it
does not believe to be correct,"
said senator Augustin, an engi
neering graduate student whose
research is funded by a military
grant. "Would USSA work toward
increasing financial aid for me? I
don't think so."
"I fear even more that they will
work to decrease my funding,"
Augustin added.
Leyton insisted that the flier
refers only to expanding the
options for funding grants to
areas not supported by the mili
tary.
Students First COP slate mem
ber John Overdeck also said the
organization's biggest concern
about President Bush's financial
aid proposal involves delayed dis
bursement of Stafford loans at
institutions with student-loan
default rates in excess of 30 per
cent. Both Overdeck and Leyton
agree this provision would not
apply to Stanford.
The politics of its leaders
This group of senators also
questions the political agendas of
the leaders of the association.
For instance, at a recent senate
meeting Overdeck questioned a
trip Leyton made to Cuba in
December. While in Havana, Ley
ton attended a meeting of the
International Union of Students
and the Federation of University
Students in Cuba and heard a
three-hour speech by Fidel Cas
tro.
Leyton said she went as an
"American university student"
and Davis said the association did
not send her or pay for her trip.
The association's constitution
prevents membership in any
international student organiza
tion.
At a separate public meeting
with Leyton and Ybarra, Bone
questioned the involvement of
association leaders in the now
defunct League of Revolutionary
Struggle, a Marxist-Leninist orga
nization, and the Unity National
Organizing Committee.
Leyton said the Unity commit
tee is a national multiracial orga
nization working for democracy
and progressive change.
Ybarra and Leyton said some
leaders of the association are
members of these groups but
"there are no ties in any way
between these organizations,"
and "individuals' private political
beliefs are not part of the election
process."


'Is it important to have a national
representative to lobby on issues
such as financial aid? If it is, then
Stanford must work with USSA.'
— Stacey Leyton
As students vote on the referendum to cre
ate an ASSU financial-aid office in today's
runoff election, several senators are raising
questions about the ASSU's connection with a
national student lobby organization.
After students rejected the proposed ASSU
lobby office, organizers placed the financial-aid
office referendum on the runoff ballot because
they say the future of financial aid is at a crit
ical juncture. In addition, students expressed
overwhelming support in the general election
for having ASSU work on financial aid issues,
organizers said.
The non-binding referendum calls on the
ASSU Senate to create the office for the
"express and sole purpose of advocating for
increased financial aid at the state and federal

levels." To lobby effectively, the senate will
"maintain a membership in the United States
Student Association and participate specifi
cally on financial aid issues."
Although the ASSLf has been a member for
several years, many students say they have
never heard of the association and wonder why
it and the lobby office have become big issues
now.
Several campus groups have criticized both
the national organization and the election pro
cess for the Stanford office. Hut supporters sav
the financial-aid office is the only way for
Stanford students to have an impact on the
federal debate on the reauthorization of gov
ernment funding for financial aid.
The association's history-
Pounded after World War II by returning
soldiers, the United States Student Associa

tion is fighting to "increase access to highe
education on the federal level," said Pierr
Rarolette, the membership service coordinato
for the Washington, D.C.-based association.
"Our main objective is to improve federa
financial aid," Barolette added. "We spend ove
90 percent of our time working solely on finan
cial-aid issues."
As the only student advocacy group with i
full-time Washington lobbyist, the organiza
tion also plans to open a regional office ir
Sacramento to lobby the California Legisla
tu re next year.
It now represents more than 300 commu
nity and four-year colleges, including man}
state college associations, Barolette said.
The association has worked on other cam
pus-related issues, including supporting the
passage of the Disability Rights
Act, the Civil Rights Act and the
Violence Against Women Act. The
group also actively lobbied against
the Persian Gulf war.
The ASSU has been involved
with the association for five years,
said senator Naomi Onaga, a
sponsor of the financial-aid office
referendum. The ASSU currently
pays $1,000 per year in dues to
the national organization, and
supporters here hope to double
that amount next year to support
the Sacramento office.
Onaga and freshman Danny
Ruderman are currently two of 60
voting members on the associa
tion's national board of directors,
and former Council of Presidents
member Stacey Leyton is the West
Coast representative of the orga
nization. Leyton completed her
masters degree in history last
October.
The association organized a
joint congressional hearing on the
reauthorization of federal finan
cial aid during its March legisla
tive conference in Washington,
D.C. Five Stanford students par
ticipated in the conference, and
junior Brian Hooker testified at
the hearing.
The association held a regional
hearing at UCLA last weekend on
the reauthorization of financial
aid, and another meeting is sched
uled for UC-Davis on May 11.
The organization's efforts on
financial aid have generally
received widespread support,
from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., to Robert Huff, Stanford's
director of financial aid.
And the proposed financial-aid
office at Stanford will work with
the national organization to lobby
both the federal and state govern
ments and increase the involve
ment of Stanford students in the
financial aid issue.
But not everyone in the ASSL T
expresses the same support for
the group.
Current Stanford controversy
The referendum in today's
runoff election has outraged some
members of Students United for
Fair Elections, a campus group
that organized last year's recall
election.
"The threat to financial aid is
being used as a pretext to create a
lobbying organization," charged
Larry Augustin, a member of the
group. "This issue appeared on
the ballot once. The ASSU Senate
ruled that the students need
another chance to make the right
decision."
But Onaga said the urgency of
the financial aid issue and the
overwhelming voter approval for
the referendum asking the ASSU
to allocate resources to financial
aid lobbying merit a swift
response.

Members of the national orga
nization also argue that the finan
cial-aid office must be approved
now for Stanford students to have
any impact at all.
"The question everyone must
ask themselves is 'Is it important
to have a national representative
to lobby on issues such as finan
cial aid?'," Leyton said. "If it is,
then Stanford must work with
USSA."
Onaga said the senate could
have created a financial-aid office
on its own in next year's budget
but she decided a referendum
would be "more responsive and
accountable to the students."

The scope question
"It is clear that the ASSU
should be accountable to stu
dents," Onaga said. According to
the new referendum, the finan
cial-aid office would "only work on
financial aid."
But opponents of the financial
aid office claim that Stanford's
support of the association can
never really be limited to working
on financial aid.
"Whenever USSA takes a posi
tion, it does it as a group that rep
resents 3.5 million students," said
graduate senator Doug Bone, who
wrote a statement in the election
handbook opposing the referen
dum. "No one will say, 'Oh, but I
believe that most schools are only

aid and do not support this policy'.
