# ASSU ties with lobby group questioned
## But supporters say it's the only way to fight for financial aid

As students vote on the referendum to cre
ate an ASSU financial-aid office in today's
runoff election, several senators are raising
questions about the ASSU's connection with a
national student lobby organization.
After students rejected the proposed ASSU
lobby office, organizers placed the financial-aid
office referendum on the runoff ballot because
they say the future of financial aid is at a crit
ical juncture. In addition, students expressed
overwhelming support in the general election
for having ASSU work on financial aid issues,
organizers said.
The non-binding referendum calls on the
ASSU Senate to create the office for the
"express and sole purpose of advocating for
increased financial aid at the state and federal

levels." To lobby effectively, the senate will
"maintain a membership in the United States
Student Association and participate specifi
cally on financial aid issues."
Although the ASSLf has been a member for
several years, many students say they have
never heard of the association and wonder why
it and the lobby office have become big issues
now.
Several campus groups have criticized both
the national organization and the election pro
cess for the Stanford office. Hut supporters sav
the financial-aid office is the only way for
Stanford students to have an impact on the
federal debate on the reauthorization of gov
ernment funding for financial aid.

Rarolette, the membership service coordinato
for the Washington, D.C.-based association.
"Our main objective is to improve federa
financial aid," Barolette added. "We spend ove
90 percent of our time working solely on finan
cial-aid issues."
As the only student advocacy group with i
full-time Washington lobbyist, the organiza
tion also plans to open a regional office ir
Sacramento to lobby the California Legisla
tu re next year.
It now represents more than 300 commu
nity and four-year colleges, including man}
state college associations, Barolette said.
The association has worked on other cam
