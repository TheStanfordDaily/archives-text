## New lobby office is a pretense for USSA membership 
### 
STANFORD STUDENTS HAVE
already voted to reject the special
fee request of the ASSU Lobby
Office. However, this action did not sit
well with a majority of the ASSU Senate.
So, on April 23, the senate decided to
force students to vote again by rechris
tening the Lobby Office the ASSU
Financial Aid Office, and putting it on
the ballot for the May 2 and 3 runoff
election.
The Lobby/Financial Aid Office
appeared on the spring election ballot as
a special fee request. As such, the stu
dents had direct control over whether or
not to fund the organization. Special fee
money comes directly from the students;
students directly vote on which groups
receive it, and students may choose to

have their money refunded.
The money for the new Lobby/Finan
cial Aid Office will come from students
just as the old one would, only indirectly,
through the money students pay for
Sunday Flicks, ASSU Lecture Notes and
other ASSU services.
This way, students cannot get a
refund if they disapprove of the
Lobby/Financial Aid Office. The money
is no longer directly under student con
trol, but is under the control of the sen
ate. So much for accountability.
Proponents of the Lobby/Financial
Aid office will tell you that it is a differ
ent organization than that which
appeared on the ballot in the first elec
tion. This is a blatant lie. Both organiza
tions have essentially the same charter;

both seek to directly fund the United
States Students Association.
The USSA is a national organization
which uses its money to lobby in Wash
ington, D.C. on many issues not related
to financial aid. While the Financial Aid
Office referendum supposedly limits
Stanford's involvement in the USSA to
financial aid issues, the USSA lobby
effort is not limited.
The Lobby/Financial Aid Office
remains an umbrella organization for
campaigning on issues beyond the Stan
ford campus.
The senate has not had the honesty or
decency to admit that the organizations
are the same. The senate has not had the
honesty or the decency to accept stu-

dents' decision on the funding of the
Lobby/Financial Aid Office.
We support efforts to secure financial
aid — but this is not such an effort. The
threat to financial aid is being used as a
pretense for institutionalizing member
ship in the USSA and establishing an
office to lobby on national issues.
We urge students not to establish a
precedent whereby fees, organizations or
ballot measures are repeatedly submitted
until they are voted on in the manner
the senate believes is correct.
We urge students to again vote "no"
on the ASSU Financial Aid referendum,
and therefore, the ASSU Lobby Office.
