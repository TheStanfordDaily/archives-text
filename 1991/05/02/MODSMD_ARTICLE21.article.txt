# MEChA shouldn't be subject to majoritarian election
## 
### 
I AM DISMAYED TO SEE THE
attacks mounted against putting the
MEChA special fee request on the
runoff ballot. What bothers me about
these attacks is that they invariably
express outrage over the "corruption of
the democratic process."
MEChA should get its funding with
out having to go through any election
process.
Democracy is no magic cure for our
social problems; it can also be the source
of our trouble in another guise, the
tyranny of the majority. The Old South
is an example of the failure of democracy.
Eor a democracy to work, there has to be
recognition that certain fundamental
areas should be off-limits to majority
rule.
What we have here is an area which
should be off-limits to the democratic
process, namely, the ability of the Latino
community to survive at Stanford.
Opponents of the MEChA special fee

can argue that this money should come
from the University and not the ASSU. 1
would agree with this, but to ignore the
current crisis Latinos are facing for the
coming year would be criminal.
In the long term, we should support
some type of initiative that will ensure
funding for all groups on campus that
perform absolutely vital support services
on campus for their communities. The
present reality, however, demands that
we submit to a democratic process and
vote "yes" for the MEChA special fee.
Some may doubt that the MEChA
special fee is very important to Latinos.
It would only be natural to ask the com
munity to whom the programs are
directed about the effects a funding cut
would have upon them. Opponents of the
fee shrewdly avoid this issue because
they know the Latino community at
Stanford firmly agrees on this point.
The money MEChA receives is dis
tributed throughout the Latino commu

nity at Stanford for programming that
offers much-needed support. With this
money, the Latino community gives itself
the cultural, social and academic life pre
server it needs to survive in a white
dominated and sometimes hostile envi
ronment.
One service similar to the MEChA
special fee at Stanford would be our
financial aid program. Both are essential
to ensure that students will be able to
survive at Stanford. The latter guaran
tees monetary well-being for the under
privileged; the former guarantees per
sonal well-being for a marginalized
minority group. Everyone would agree
that if financial aid were to lose in an
election, that would constitute a bar
barous and unjust result.
The special fee is really about the sur
vival of Latinos at Stanford and not
about some prosaic concern about the
preservation of democracy. Opposition to
MEChA's funding essentially states a

desire to see the Latino community evap
orate from the campus.
Some may take offense, but really,
why should people of color on this cam
pus believe otherwise? Our whole history
in this country has been one of oppres
sion by the use of many tools, one of
which has been the "democratic pro
cess."
It is evident at Stanford as well by the
small margins of victory that communi
ties of color win every year for their
funding. Being a minority means that
you just don't have the votes.
So opponents of the MEChA special
fee, be honest with yourselves. Do you
oppose it because of your.concern for
democracy, or is it because you would
rather not see so many brown people
around you?
