## No-no Nolan Ryan hurls 7th no-hitter 
### 
ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Nolan Ryan
pitched his seventh no-hitter Wednesday night
in the most dominating performance of his
amazing quarter-century career.
Ryan, 44, struck out 16 and shut down the
best-hitting team in the major leagues as the
'lYxas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-0.
Ryan, who became the oldest to pitch a no
hitter last season with his record sixth against
Oakland, allowed only two runners, and nei
ther made it past first base. He walked Kelly
oruber in the first inning and Joe Carter in the
seventh.
The Blue Jays, leading the majors with a
.276 average, did not hit a single ball hard and
flailed helplessly at his assortment of fastballs,
sharp curves and changeups. The closest they
came to hit was in the sixth on Manuel Lee's
blooper to center field, which Gary Pettis
caught on the run at his shoetops.
The crowd of 33,439 chanted "No-lan! No
lan!" as he took the mound in the ninth, and
Ryan (2-2) did not disappoint his hometown
fans. He retired Lee and Devon White on rou
tine grounders and finished his gem by striking
out a swinging Roberto Alomar.
Ryan, baseball's all-time strikeout king, has
pitched three more no-hitters than anyone.
Sandy Koufax is next with four.
He was mobbed in the middle of the field
when it ended, and the fans refused to leave.
He saluted their standing ovation with his
characteristic hand-over-his-head wave.
