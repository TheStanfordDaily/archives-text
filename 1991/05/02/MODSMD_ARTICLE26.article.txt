OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Rickey Hender
son finally swiped No. 939.
Henderson ran his way into the record
books in the fourth inning of the Oakland Ath
letics' 7-4 victory over the New York Yankees
yesterday, setting off a five-minute celebration
for baseball's new steal king.
"Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but
today I'm the greatest of all time," Henderson
said to the crowd of 36,139 in the Oakland Col
iseum.
Henderson ran into the record books with
amazing speed, setting the record in 1,154
attempts in 12 seasons. Brock needed 1,245
attempts over 19 years. It took Ty Cobb 24
years to set the old American League record of
892 stolen bases that Henderson surpassed
last May 29.
Henderson, after being thrown out at sec
ond base in the first inning, stole third base in
the fourth to break Brock's record.
Henderson broke for third on a 1-0 pitch
from Tim Leary to Harold Baines, and dove
into third head-first, easily beating Matt
Nokes' throw, which bounced before reaching
Randy Velarde.
"It was a thrill," Henderson said. "I've been
blessed with the ability and the good fortune to
not get a lot of injuries. ... I really wanted to
get it over. I was putting too much pressure on
myself."
Immediately after the record-breaking steal,
Henderson pulled up the base, held it above the
head in his right hand and pumped his left fist
in celebration.
Brock then came on the field as fans gave
Henderson a standing ovation. Henderson's
Oakland teammates stood and applauded.
