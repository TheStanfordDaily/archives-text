Following in the footsteps of family
tradition that includes a former two
sport Cardinal athlete, Menlo School
basketball standout Kate Paye
announced her intention to come to
Stanford next year.
Paye's parents and two siblings
attended Stanford, with older brother
John the most notable alumnus. John
Paye, who coached Kate and Menlo to
three straight state titles, was a start
ing quarterback for the Cardinal and a
backup guard on the basketball team.
Paye, who was recently named to
the ail-Northern California team, will
attempt to become only the second
walk-on in the last three years under
coach Tara VanDerveer. Off guard
Angela Taylor made the team and
earned a scholarship at the beginning
of the 1989-90 season.
"Stanford is where my heart is,"
said Paye, who turned down a scholar
ship offer from Pacific 10 Conference
rival California and also passed on sev
eral Ivy League schools. "I grew up
watching Stanford athletics."'
Paye may have an advantage in that
Stanford's point guard position is wide
open going into next season. Gone
from the slot is four-year starter and
Kodak All-American Sonja Henning,

Sports Shot's

and Stanford was only able to sign one
of the two prep guards it coveted.
"Katie's a heady player," Van-
Derveer said. "She's smart about the
game, I'm glad she's coming."
VanDerveer also confirmed that
Julie Zeilstra's serious ankle condition
makes her status for next season
uncertain.
In other news, Taylor was selected
to play on the Pac-10 all-star team that
will compete for the Jones Cup this
summer.
Henning, Chris MacMurdo, Christy
Hedgpeth and former Cardinal stars
Jennifer Azzi and Katv Stedingwill try
out for the U.S. national team this
summer.
