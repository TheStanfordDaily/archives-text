# A. delicate balance: Jet-setting soccer star tries to do it all
## 
### 
As swimming superstar Janet Evans
was pulling out of school last
month to concentrate on her sport,
another world-class Cardinal athlete was
choosing to do just the opposite.
Despite the demands of competing for
the traveling U.S. national squad, star
soccer midfielder Julie Foudy remains a
student worried ahout her papers and
midterms. Unlike Evans, Foudy has been
able to reach her sport's pinnacle without
sacrificing her perspective.
Yet it is Evans's story that is splashed
across the headlines — not much is heard
about Julie Foudy, the U.S. women's

team, or even soccer in general. But all
that will soon change, if the sophomore
has anything to say about it.
There are parallels here. Foudy and
Evans both came to Stanford a year and a
half ago as the nation's top recruit in
their respective sports. In choosing the
Cardinal, both spurned the state school
that had completely dominated the NCAA
championships in previous years iTexas
in swimming, North Carolina in soccer).
From there, however, the two athletes'
paths have diverged. The result is that
while Foudy will continue to juggle inter
national competition with Stanford ath

letics and academics next year, Evans will
not.
Most of you will have heard about
Evans, the Olympic heroine and media
darling who decided after two years that
school and top-notch swimming are
incompatible. Chances are, you haven't
heard of Foudy and what she has been
accomplishing on the soccer field. Allow
me to shed some much-needed light on
the latter's situation.
It it common knowledge that the
United States is gearing up to host the
world's premier sporting event, soccer's
World Cup, in 1994. You may even he
aware that Stanford Stadium is currently
being considered as one of the main sites
for World Cup games. A trial run of sorts
will take place when the U.S. national
team plays world power Argentina here
May 19.
But did you know that long before
1994 there will be a similar competition,
and that the U.S. is one of the favorites in
this, the first-ever women's World Cup?
If you know all of this, then you also
know how amazing — and refreshing — it
is that Foudy's where she is: right here at
Stanford. And unlike her more famous
classmate, Foudy isn't going anywhere.
Foudy just returned Monday from a
trip of several weeks to 1 lait i, where
the United States toyed with the
rest of its region and qualified for the
World Cup. The American squad
outscored its opponents 51-0 in five
games, including a 5-0 win over Canada
in the championship, and established
itself as the odds-on favorite to win the
Cup.
Returning to campus and a life of
anonymity has to be somewhat strange to
Foudy, who starts at center midfield on
the national team. The United States
played games in front of 30,000 fans in
Haiti and received huge amounts of pub
licity and respect. At home, no one has
heard of them. Such is the life of a U.S.
soccer star.
"We played Haiti in the semis, and it

was crazy," said Foudy, who scored two
goals during the tournament. "The whole
stadium goes nuts, with drums beating
and people dancing. ... It was great to
see such support for it."
Hut the heady success had one down
side for Foudy — the dates of the 12-team
World Cup competition, held in China in
late November, conflict with her Stanford
season. She could play during the regular
season, but she would probably miss the
bulk of the NCAA playoffs.
Foudy was on the horns of a dilemma
that Evans never faced — a concrete rea
son why she might opt out of collegiate
athletics in the pursuit of higher goals.
Surely this would make staying in school
a secondary concern.
Who would want to put in all the hours
of practice and training on a team with
which you couldn't reap the postseason
rewards?
Apparently, Foudy would, and will.
Rather than redshirt or stop out to play in
the World Cup, she will play for both
teams next fall. And the reasons are as
much academic as athletic.
"I want to play with the seniors,"' she
said, mentioning roommate Heather
Mclntyre in particular. "I'm also hoping
to graduate in four years. I want to go
overseas I to Spain I next spring, and if 1
stopped out I couldn't do that."
Academic concerns are very high on
Foudy's list, and they have been brought
into focus this spring. A human biology
major trying to complete the core courses,
she has struggled to get her schoolwork

done among the soccer trips. Four days
before leaving for Haiti, she was in Bul
garia. Later this month, its off to Europe
for another whirlwind tour.
Foudy will have done a lot of "study
abroad" even before she goes to Spain
next year. Slu> calculated that she will be
on campus just throe weeks this quarter.
While Evans had a lull ride, Foudy is
not on an athletic scholarship — indeed,
there are no scholarships at all on Stan
ford's nationally-ranked women's soccer
team. Hut this just makes school that
much more important to her.
"I hate (missing school). I'm not here
to take my classes overseas," she said. "I
pay for it — it's hard to justify it to my
folks. But I have my notes sent to me and
I'm keeping on top of things."
Academics are so important that
Foudy chose Stanford despite worries
that turning down North Carolina would
hurt her position on the national team.
The Tar Heels' coach, Anson Dorrance,
doubles as coach of the U.S. team, which
is filled with Carolina players and alums.
But the summer after she committed
to Stanford, Foudy earned a starting spot
on the national team, and has never fal
tered. North Carolina continues to rack
ip national titles, but Foudy has no
regrets. One can only wonder about
Kvans, who went back to train with the
Texas coach after leaving Stanford.
"I'm thinking of the long term — I'm
not going to play soccer for the rest of my
life," Foudy said. "I'm so glad I did come
here Stanford has been great for devel
opment."
Foudy will pursue her developing
dream of playing on the first women's
World Cup champion next fall, but she
will continue to develop in the classroom
as well. It is something that all of us,
including Janet Evans, can learn from.

didate for the Notre Dame coaching
vacancy.

But she doesn't want to abandon the team at Stanford and will therefore attmept to
do both.
