# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Silk, satin and self-discovery on the second floor of Macy's 
### 
N™„ , I hate shopping.
But it was my mom's birthday and Woolworth's was having that "We're
being forced to leave because we're not good enough for you snotty Stan
ford kids" sale, so I figured I'd kill a bird with a couple of rocks, if you
know what I mean.

My mistake was bringing a friend.
It all started when she asked me if we could "just step inside" Macy's for
a minute.
"Why not?" I figured.
This was my hubris.
"Yo, wait up. What's this second floor business?"
As she headed toward the escalator, I quickly put on my sunglasses,
avoiding the dangerous green rays that emanate from the Kermit-splat
tered Hades hidden underneath mall escalators.
She got to the top and took a right, Then she kept walking; she walked
right through the Nintendo section. And she didn't stop.
I started to sweat. I started to hyperventilate. I started to make those lit
tle noises Nermal makes when Jon's around.
She was headed toward the "Lingerie" section.
"Whoa. What's going on here?"
"I just need to pick out a bra. Mine are all so '80s."
I was torn. I was excited, yet nervous. It was like in fourth grade when
that guy in the limousine offers you a Culture Club tape, and even though
it's not candy, you know you shouldn't take it.
Before I knew it, I was standing amid rows and rows of what looked like
Superman Underoos made from Victorian tablecloths, only they were
smaller and had nothing to do with Superman.
There I was, dazed, confused, dizzied by the smell of a potpourri sachet
the size of Harry Caray's gut, and blatantly the only male on the upper
level of Macy's.
I looked around at the salespeople. Sure, they were all women, but —
unlike the ones in my recurring junior high fantasies — they were not
wearing garter belts and push-up bras with their name tags ever-so-care
fully pinned on.
Everyone was staring at me. I tried to look masculine. I tucked my hair
in the back of my shirt and made that Jewish-grandfather-coughing-up-a
phlegm-ball-while-trying-to-read-the-Haggadah noise. I even thought
about asserting my masculinity by copping a feel from the Maidenform
mannequin, but I figured that would only draw further attention.
I stood there, alone in the corner, hoping she wouldn't ask for my opin
ion. You see, my whole life, I had been patiently waiting for someone to
ask for my opinion about undergarments — using my time to craft a com
plex parable about I.owly Worm and the problems he had with the annoy
ing, pointless aperture that someone had built into his tent. Only, looking
at my surroundings, it just didn't seem apropos right then.
Meanwhile, my friend was busy looking at a wall of pink and white bras
with flowers on them. I walked over and quietly picked one up. There was
a tag on it, picturing an elderly woman with a harelip. The caption read,
"The Olga behind every Olga."
I advised her against it.
I started to look around. There were red velvet bras. There were DDD
bras you could strain soup with. There were "minimizer" bras which
showed a "before" picture of an unhappy woman who couldn't button her
shirt, and a happy, well-buttoned "after" woman. There were ...
"I'm going to go try these on." •
Try them on? Where I buy underwear there are big signs saying
"Attempting to try on undergarments is illegal and highly immoral. Viola
tors will be prosecuted and publicly embarrassed." And not once did I
question it. It just made sense, like some kind of Kantian-a-priori-jock
itch-synthetic-judgement.
"But this is different," I rationalized. "This is OK; these are bras."
Unless, of course, you happen to be nursing. And there were special nurs
ing bras for that. What a country.
When I first saw these special nursing bras, I didn't realize their special
purpose despite their name ("Special Nursing Bras"). However, I did find
them aesthetically intriguing and recommended them to my friend.
She ignored me and walked into the dressing room.
I sat on the chairs designated for insecure male sidekicks and proceeded
to sign the wedding book. I told them all about the "Karate Kid" wedding
theme and how much trouble we had getting the Pat Morita centerpiece.
She still wasn't done, so I browsed through the "Great Kisses of History"
book, but couldn't seem to find that Kris Kristofferson/Barbara Streisand
thing.
She still wasn't out so I started to walk around the store. Hey, I could
handle this. After all, I was 19 years old, and I had seen a bra or two in my
time.
I got bolder and bolder as I walked around the store asking questions
about "support" and French words I couldn't pronounce. I even walked up
to one of the saleswomen and used the old, "You look about the same size
as my girlfriend " line, but, alas, to no avail.
The next thing I remember I was running around the store with a bra
draped over my head, in some kind of Jamie Farr-induced fantasy, shout
ing "I'm Zsa Zsa. I'm Zsa Zsa."
It was right then and there that I realized I had a problem.
You see, I have a breast fetish.
It was unfortunate that it took such an event to make me realize that I
needed help, but by taking that important first step of admitting my prob
lem, I was able to take the first step on the long road to recovery.
My therapist says it all stems from the fact that I wasn't breast-fed. I still
insist that it developed from the crush I had on Heidi Mack in eighth
grade, and the fact that she never let me "tune in Tokyo."
But the more I think about it, the more I want to keep my breast fetish.
For 19 years it has served to shape and mold and knead and caress and ..
. well, it's made me who I am.
And to those that demand I change, I say only this: "Rico. Suav*."

Joel Stein is grateful that the Clock Tower does not run on military time.

tle noises Nermal makes when Jon's around.
She was headed toward the "Lingerie" section.
"Whoa. What's going on here?"
"I just need to pick out a bra. Mine are all so '80s."
I was torn. I was excited, yet nervous. It was like in fourth grade when
that guy in the limousine offers you a Culture Club tape, and even though
it's not candy, you know you shouldn't take it.
Before I knew it, I was standing amid rows and rows of what looked like
Superman Underoos made from Victorian tablecloths, only they were
smaller and had nothing to do with Superman.
There I was, dazed, confused, dizzied by the smell of a potpourri sachet
the size of Harry Caray's gut, and blatantly the only male on the upper
level of Macy's.
I looked around at the salespeople. Sure, they were all women, but —
unlike the ones in my recurring junior high fantasies — they were not
wearing garter belts and push-up bras with their name tags ever-so-care
fully pinned on.
Everyone was staring at me. I tried to look masculine. I tucked my hair
in the back of my shirt and made that Jewish-grandfather-coughing-up-a
phlegm-ball-while-trying-to-read-the-Haggadah noise. I even thought
about asserting my masculinity by copping a feel from the Maidenform
mannequin, but I figured that would only draw further attention.
I stood there, alone in the corner, hoping she wouldn't ask for my opin
ion. You see, my whole life, I had been patiently waiting for someone to
ask for my opinion about undergarments — using my time to craft a com
plex parable about I.owly Worm and the problems he had with the annoy
ing, pointless aperture that someone had built into his tent. Only, looking
at my surroundings, it just didn't seem apropos right then.
Meanwhile, my friend was busy looking at a wall of pink and white bras
with flowers on them. I walked over and quietly picked one up. There was
a tag on it, picturing an elderly woman with a harelip. The caption read,
"The Olga behind every Olga."
I advised her against it.
I started to look around. There were red velvet bras. There were DDD
bras you could strain soup with. There were "minimizer" bras which
showed a "before" picture of an unhappy woman who couldn't button her
shirt, and a happy, well-buttoned "after" woman. There were ...
"I'm going to go try these on." •
Try them on? Where I buy underwear there are big signs saying
"Attempting to try on undergarments is illegal and highly immoral. Viola
tors will be prosecuted and publicly embarrassed." And not once did I
question it. It just made sense, like some kind of Kantian-a-priori-jock
itch-synthetic-judgement.
"But this is different," I rationalized. "This is OK; these are bras."
Unless, of course, you happen to be nursing. And there were special nurs
ing bras for that. What a country.
When I first saw these special nursing bras, I didn't realize their special
purpose despite their name ("Special Nursing Bras"). However, I did find
them aesthetically intriguing and recommended them to my friend.
She ignored me and walked into the dressing room.
I sat on the chairs designated for insecure male sidekicks and proceeded
to sign the wedding book. I told them all about the "Karate Kid" wedding
theme and how much trouble we had getting the Pat Morita centerpiece.
She still wasn't done, so I browsed through the "Great Kisses of History"
book, but couldn't seem to find that Kris Kristofferson/Barbara Streisand
thing.
She still wasn't out so I started to walk around the store. Hey, I could
handle this. After all, I was 19 years old, and I had seen a bra or two in my
time.
I got bolder and bolder as I walked around the store asking questions
about "support" and French words I couldn't pronounce. I even walked up
to one of the saleswomen and used the old, "You look about the same size
as my girlfriend " line, but, alas, to no avail.
The next thing I remember I was running around the store with a bra
draped over my head, in some kind of Jamie Farr-induced fantasy, shout
ing "I'm Zsa Zsa. I'm Zsa Zsa."
It was right then and there that I realized I had a problem.
You see, I have a breast fetish.
It was unfortunate that it took such an event to make me realize that I
needed help, but by taking that important first step of admitting my prob
lem, I was able to take the first step on the long road to recovery.
My therapist says it all stems from the fact that I wasn't breast-fed. I still
insist that it developed from the crush I had on Heidi Mack in eighth
grade, and the fact that she never let me "tune in Tokyo."
But the more I think about it, the more I want to keep my breast fetish.
For 19 years it has served to shape and mold and knead and caress and ..
. well, it's made me who I am.
And to those that demand I change, I say only this: "Rico. Suav*."

N™„ , I hate shopping.
But it was my mom's birthday and Woolworth's was having that "We're
being forced to leave because we're not good enough for you snotty Stan
ford kids" sale, so I figured I'd kill a bird with a couple of rocks, if you
know what I mean.

My mistake was bringing a friend.
It all started when she asked me if we could "just step inside" Macy's for
a minute.
"Why not?" I figured.
This was my hubris.
"Yo, wait up. What's this second floor business?"
As she headed toward the escalator, I quickly put on my sunglasses,
avoiding the dangerous green rays that emanate from the Kermit-splat
tered Hades hidden underneath mall escalators.
She got to the top and took a right, Then she kept walking; she walked
right through the Nintendo section. And she didn't stop.
I started to sweat. I started to hyperventilate. I started to make those lit
tle noises Nermal makes when Jon's around.
She was headed toward the "Lingerie" section.
