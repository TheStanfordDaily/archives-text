Mou are surrounded by about 100 sleazy
looking men. Half are clad in leather,
bearing chains. The rest wear skin-tight
jeans and T-shirts, "vogueing" to the blar-
JKLL_ ing tunes of Madonna. As you nervously
edge forward in the dark, one of the slimier ones
approaches you and whispers in your ear that he'd like
to take you home with him and ...
They're not like that, really.
As a matter of fact, today's gay and lesbian bars
and dance clubs are a great option for Stanford stu
dents looking for a same-sex relationship, gay or les
bian friends, or just a place to dance the night away.
The Bay Area without a doubt
boasts one of the finest menus of
gay and lesbian nightclubs this
side of Christopher Street in
New York City.
Attending a school just 40 minutes from San
Francisco — the city which is to gays what Salt Lake
City is to Mormons — Stanford students looking for
same-sex clubs are at no loss for options.
With nearly a dozen great choices for men, and
about half that many for women, the Bay Area with
out a doubt boasts one of the finest menus of gay
nightclubs this side of Christopher Street in New
York City.
One senior says he likes gay dance clubs because
"they're a lot more fun. People cut loose a lot more
than in straight bars I've been to. It's uninhibited
fun."
But David Frank, a graduate student, says he
doesn't like gay night clubs all that much. "They're
great places to go if you're single and you want to get
fucked or if you just want to dance," Frank says. "If
you don't want to do either of those things, it's
ridiculous to go."
Junior lake Veylupek disagrees. Gay dance clubs
"are a good place to go where almost everyone inside
is gay,' he says. "Certainly you can meet people at a
gay dance place and be friends with them forever,"

and never have sex with them, he adds.
While many "gay" clubs target both men and
women, several San Francisco bars catering primar
ily to lesbians have closed in recent months. Still, the
few clubs that remain open — which, like the best
gay bars, are open just one night a week — attract
many lesbians looking for fun.
"The atmosphere is not at all aggressive or threat
ening," says graduate student Ann Seaton. "At les
bian bars, no one will hit on anyone, so you can just
have fun."
Seaton recently went to "bra night" at Club Q in
the City. Admission was free for shirtless women
sporting bras. "There were 40 people from Stanford
there," she says.
Gay clubs in the Bay Area are popular spots for
Stanford students, not all of whom are "out of the
closet" on the Farm.
"It's encouraging how often you see Stanford
related people who've just come out at a dance
place," Veylupek says. As a matter of fact, if you keep
your eyes peeled, you may just see your resident
assistant or that attractive woman in your sorority
dancing the night away at The Box.
One more thing: Straight and "undeclared" peo
ple are welcome at most gay and lesbian dance clubs,
just as long as you remember that the people you sec
don't necessarily want you to tell your roommate you
saw them there.
Robin Wehl, a junior at Central Washington Uni
versity, says she enjoyed her evening at a San Fran
cisco gay bar that she visited with a gay friend of
hers. "There were men in the women's bathroom,"
she says."I wasn't uncomfortable, but I got a little
bored, because nobody paid attention to me."
Probably the best — and without a doubt the
largest — gay dance club is Colossus, which attracts
hundreds of men every Saturday night to a ware
house south of Market Street in the City.
Packed from about 11 p.m. until literally dawn,
Colossus boasts two dance floors, each with different
music, as well as several bars, Adonis-like dancers
and huge video screens. Although the $10 cover
charge is quite steep, Colossus is definitely worth
checking out. It's located at 1015 Folsom at 6th
Street.
A good spot for Stanford students to find them
selves on a Friday night is The Mix, the area's best
18-and-older, same-sex hangout. Located on Shat-

ft look at the Bay Area's gay and lesbian clubs

tuck Street in Berkeley, The Mix appeals to men and
women who want to dance or socialize without nec
essarily drinking. Freshman Saydeah Howard, 18,
says she thinks The Mix is "a real valuable option for
those who are under 21 who want to be with other
gay people."
Other good clubs this side of San Francisco are
Club St. John in San Jose and B-Street in San Mateo.
Club St. John combines the best of several worlds,
with a large dance floor, a pool table and an immense
piano player singing show tunes. Open every night,
the crowd at this San lose hot spot at 170 W. St. John
Street is ethnically diverse and filled with both male
and female patrons.

B-Street (236 S. B Street) is smaller, but a smart
choice if you're looking to stay close to home.
"The best dancing around" is at The I-Beam at
1748 Haight in San Francisco on Sundays, according
to Veylupek. Usually a straight bar, the I-Beam is
packed with gay men on Sunday evenings for a "tea
dance" with great music, great dancing and a great
crowd. Since the party peaks between 7 and 10 p.m.,
you can spend the evening dancing and make it
home in time to study for your Monday morning
math midterm.
The Kennel Club at Divisadero and Hayes in the
City is the location of two ethnically diverse clubs,
Club Q for women and The Box for everybody. Club
Q is on Friday nights, and features house music,
while The Box is on Thursdays and Saturdays with
more of a funk mix. Of all the clubs in the city, it has
the most diverse crowd — lesbians, gays, straights
and every ethnicity under the sun.
South of Market Street, the spacious, indoor-and
outdoor Fndup (6th and Harrison) is the location

for Club Uranus (pun intended) and
Girlspot. Club Uranus features scant
ily clad go-go dancers in cages and a
young, energetic crowd on Sunday
nights. Girlspot is the happening spot
on Saturdays, one of the more popular
hangouts for lesbians.
And then, of course, there's The
Stud, described by one gay student as
"an institution."
Located South of Market Street at
9th and Harrison, The Stud boasts a
long bar, a pool table and a dance floor
complete with a laser display.
Open nightly and almost always
crowded, The Stud is quite popular
with Stanford students on Mondays
for Soul Night — when about half the
crowd is black — and especially
Wednesdays, when Oldies Night
seems more like Student Night, with
Stanford, Cal and San Francisco State
T-shirts dotting the packed club.
A story on gay bars wouldn't be
complete without mention of the Cas
tro District, the center of gay activity
in San Francisco for more than two
decades.
The best bar in the Castro is The
Midnight Sun, which is packed from

wall to wall almost every night. Several
video screens show music videos and
clips from sitcoms such as "The
Golden Girls" and "Designing
Women" on a rotating basis.
Then there's Metro which is basi
cally a sweater bar, with yuppie gays
drinking yuppie drinks and watching
yuppie music videos.
Finally, if you want to get close to
the scene at the beginning of this arti
cle, check out The Depot. I'm not
going to describe it in detail, but let
me leave you with a warning: don't use
the restroom....
Finally, for many students the best
option is right here on campus. The
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
offers a quarterly dance held in Elliot
Program Center that always draws a
large crowd, both from Stanford and
off-campus.
These Stanford dances are noted
for their conspicuous absence of alco
hol and the one or two closet cases
that break away from their "straight"
Stanford lives to check out the gay
scene for a night. This quarter's dance
is Saturday night starting at 9 p.m. at
Elliot.

Q is on Friday nights, and features house music,
while The Box is on Thursdays and Saturdays with
more of a funk mix. Of all the clubs in the city, it has
the most diverse crowd — lesbians, gays, straights
and every ethnicity under the sun.
South of Market Street, the spacious, indoor-and
outdoor Fndup (6th and Harrison) is the location

for Club Uranus (pun intended) and
Girlspot. Club Uranus features scant
ily clad go-go dancers in cages and a
young, energetic crowd on Sunday
nights. Girlspot is the happening spot
on Saturdays, one of the more popular
hangouts for lesbians.
And then, of course, there's The
Stud, described by one gay student as
"an institution."
Located South of Market Street at
9th and Harrison, The Stud boasts a
long bar, a pool table and a dance floor
complete with a laser display.
Open nightly and almost always
crowded, The Stud is quite popular
with Stanford students on Mondays
for Soul Night — when about half the
crowd is black — and especially
Wednesdays, when Oldies Night
seems more like Student Night, with
Stanford, Cal and San Francisco State
T-shirts dotting the packed club.
A story on gay bars wouldn't be
complete without mention of the Cas
tro District, the center of gay activity
in San Francisco for more than two
decades.
The best bar in the Castro is The
Midnight Sun, which is packed from

wall to wall almost every night. Several
video screens show music videos and
clips from sitcoms such as "The
Golden Girls" and "Designing
Women" on a rotating basis.
Then there's Metro which is basi
cally a sweater bar, with yuppie gays
drinking yuppie drinks and watching
yuppie music videos.

the scene at the beginning of this arti

going to describe it in detail, but let
me leave you with a warning: don't use
the restroom....
Finally, for many students the best
option is right here on campus. The
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
offers a quarterly dance held in Elliot
Program Center that always draws a
large crowd, both from Stanford and
off-campus.
These Stanford dances are noted
for their conspicuous absence of alco
hol and the one or two closet cases
that break away from their "straight"
Stanford lives to check out the gay
scene for a night. This quarter's dance
is Saturday night starting at 9 p.m. at
Elliot.

Yeah, right.
Mou are surrounded by about 100 sleazy
looking men. Half are clad in leather,
bearing chains. The rest wear skin-tight
jeans and T-shirts, "vogueing" to the blar-
JKLL_ ing tunes of Madonna. As you nervously
edge forward in the dark, one of the slimier ones
approaches you and whispers in your ear that he'd like
to take you home with him and ...
They're not like that, really.
As a matter of fact, today's gay and lesbian bars
and dance clubs are a great option for Stanford stu
dents looking for a same-sex relationship, gay or les
bian friends, or just a place to dance the night away.
The Bay Area without a doubt
boasts one of the finest menus of
gay and lesbian nightclubs this
side of Christopher Street in
New York City.
Attending a school just 40 minutes from San
Francisco — the city which is to gays what Salt Lake
City is to Mormons — Stanford students looking for
same-sex clubs are at no loss for options.
With nearly a dozen great choices for men, and
about half that many for women, the Bay Area with
out a doubt boasts one of the finest menus of gay
nightclubs this side of Christopher Street in New
York City.
One senior says he likes gay dance clubs because
"they're a lot more fun. People cut loose a lot more
than in straight bars I've been to. It's uninhibited
fun."
But David Frank, a graduate student, says he
doesn't like gay night clubs all that much. "They're
great places to go if you're single and you want to get
fucked or if you just want to dance," Frank says. "If
you don't want to do either of those things, it's
ridiculous to go."
Junior lake Veylupek disagrees. Gay dance clubs
"are a good place to go where almost everyone inside
is gay,' he says. "Certainly you can meet people at a
gay dance place and be friends with them forever,"

and never have sex with them, he adds.
While many "gay" clubs target both men and
women, several San Francisco bars catering primar
ily to lesbians have closed in recent months. Still, the
few clubs that remain open — which, like the best
gay bars, are open just one night a week — attract
many lesbians looking for fun.
"The atmosphere is not at all aggressive or threat
ening," says graduate student Ann Seaton. "At les
bian bars, no one will hit on anyone, so you can just
have fun."
Seaton recently went to "bra night" at Club Q in
the City. Admission was free for shirtless women
sporting bras. "There were 40 people from Stanford
there," she says.
Gay clubs in the Bay Area are popular spots for
Stanford students, not all of whom are "out of the
closet" on the Farm.
"It's encouraging how often you see Stanford
related people who've just come out at a dance
place," Veylupek says. As a matter of fact, if you keep
your eyes peeled, you may just see your resident
assistant or that attractive woman in your sorority
dancing the night away at The Box.
One more thing: Straight and "undeclared" peo
ple are welcome at most gay and lesbian dance clubs,
just as long as you remember that the people you sec
don't necessarily want you to tell your roommate you
saw them there.
Robin Wehl, a junior at Central Washington Uni
versity, says she enjoyed her evening at a San Fran
cisco gay bar that she visited with a gay friend of
hers. "There were men in the women's bathroom,"
she says."I wasn't uncomfortable, but I got a little
bored, because nobody paid attention to me."
Probably the best — and without a doubt the
largest — gay dance club is Colossus, which attracts
hundreds of men every Saturday night to a ware
house south of Market Street in the City.
Packed from about 11 p.m. until literally dawn,
Colossus boasts two dance floors, each with different
music, as well as several bars, Adonis-like dancers
and huge video screens. Although the $10 cover
charge is quite steep, Colossus is definitely worth
checking out. It's located at 1015 Folsom at 6th
Street.
A good spot for Stanford students to find them
selves on a Friday night is The Mix, the area's best
18-and-older, same-sex hangout. Located on Shat-

ft look at the Bay Area's gay and lesbian clubs

tuck Street in Berkeley, The Mix appeals to men and
women who want to dance or socialize without nec
essarily drinking. Freshman Saydeah Howard, 18,
says she thinks The Mix is "a real valuable option for
those who are under 21 who want to be with other
gay people."
Other good clubs this side of San Francisco are
Club St. John in San Jose and B-Street in San Mateo.
Club St. John combines the best of several worlds,
with a large dance floor, a pool table and an immense
piano player singing show tunes. Open every night,
the crowd at this San lose hot spot at 170 W. St. John
Street is ethnically diverse and filled with both male
and female patrons.

"The best dancing around" is at The I-Beam at
1748 Haight in San Francisco on Sundays, according
to Veylupek. Usually a straight bar, the I-Beam is
packed with gay men on Sunday evenings for a "tea

crowd. Since the party peaks between 7 and 10 p.m.,
you can spend the evening dancing and make it
