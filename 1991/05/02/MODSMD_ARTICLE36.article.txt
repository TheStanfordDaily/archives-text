its chocolate chip cookie time again. Why? Because sex is on the rise.
And we had no idea.
If you had asked us, we would have told you otherwise. But right there
on the front cover of yesterday's Daily was the evidence.
And if it was in The Daily, it has to be true.
lust think, if it weren't for The Daily, you never would have known
about the latest sexual surge at Stanford. Or maybe you would have.
We didn't.
And we work here.
How about some milk to go with those cookies?
Well, if you, like us, were not clued in to this latest "Spring Quarter o'
Love" thing, perhaps you might enjoy some poetry. Specifically something
like this:
Tonight
like many without a lover
I'm going to bake bread
push my knuckles
into soft dough
Interesting, huh? Hits a nerve, doesn't it? The poet, Patricia Donegan,
will be reading from her latest work, "Without Warning: A new book of
poems" along with Barbara Meier, poet and author of "The Life You
Ordered Has Arrived," at Printer's, Inc. next Wednesday. (See calendar)
If poetry is too serious or too darn intellectual for your Stanford self; or,
if life is just too serious for your Stanford self, follow the howls of laughter
to Frost Amphitheater on Sunday to catch "Laughter on the Green," a
comedy show featuring Saturday Night Live's Rich Hall and others. The
chuckles begin at 2 p.m. (See story, back page.)
In case you didn't realize that Sunday is the fifth of May, or in case you
don t translate well, the Cinco de Mayo celebration at Stanford begins this
weekend. On Friday night (which is the trÂ£s de Mayo, but hey) a Cinco de
Mayo concert will be held at Burnham Pavilion starting at 9 p.m. and run
ning until 2 a.m. Unbelievable, a University-sponsored event that runs past
midnight!
The concert features Dr. Loco and his Rockin' Jalapeno Band, a Los
Angeles-based group that blends rock, blues and salsa. A veritable wealth
of other events are also planned for the celebration. (See story, back page.)
Earlier Friday evening, senior Carolyn Shapiro presents a concert of
original works for voice and piano. You might recognize this spirited red
head from her days as Marci in a popular campus band. Moongod-less
now, she will perform in Campbell Recital Hall at 8 p.m. (See interview,
page 3.)
Also on Friday (and Saturday as well) the Stanford Savoyards will pre
sent Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Gondoliers" in Dinkelspiel.
And, For Your Information, the Webster's definition of Savoyard is 1. a
native of Savoy 2. an actor, producer or enthusiastic admirer of Gilbert and
Sullivan operas. Really.
Yet another Friday event is happening at the Mountain View Center for
the Performing Arts, where body musician Keith Terry takes the stage
with a host of intriguing props such as plastic bubble-wrap, vegetables and
wind-up toys. (See calendar.)
And another unique theatrical experience can be had at Casa Zapata on
Saturday, with Teatro Xicano de Stanford, an improvisational theater pre
sentation by undergraduate and graduate students.
But if you're just looking to get away for awhile and kick back off cam
pus, head down to Santa Cruz for the Bluegrass Festival on Saturday. (See
story, page 8.)
No grand finals. No drawn-out good-bye.
Just see ya.
