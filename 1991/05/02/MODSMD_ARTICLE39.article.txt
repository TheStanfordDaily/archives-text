# Musically Inclined
## 
### Tracy Shinn 
For many, thinking about com
posers brings to mind images of
eccentric men, oddly shaped white
wigs, fitted breeches and scenes from the
movie "Amadeus."
Composers aren't supposed to be red
headed, green-eyed bundles of energy
"on their way to Grandmother's house."
Right?
Wrong.
These are the '90s, and creative, ener
getic women like Carolyn Shapiro are
achieving recognition as accomplished
composers in their male-dominated
field.
No longer sporting the precious red cape from her role
as Little Red Riding Hood in Ram's Head's recent produc
tion of "Into the Woods," Shapiro's petite frame is now
enveloped in a comfortable, oversized sweater and an
equally comfortable, equally oversized blazer.
Her faded jeans are worn and comfortable and it looks
like Shapiro probably had to retrieve them from her
mother's Goodwill collection a few times — because they're
so comfortable.
What's the theme here? Comfort.
While energetic and ambitious, Shapiro is comfortable
with herself — as a person and as a composer. She is
forthright about her opinions, and while far from compla
cent, she appears fulfilled by her accomplishments thus far.
Although she is probably most recognizable as the for
mer lead singer of the campus band, Marci and the Moon
gods, Shapiro has been involved in a variety of musical
groups at Stanford, including the Stanford Chamber
Chorale, Early Music Singers and her current alternative
rock band, Screw. Obviously, Shapiro has a wide range of
musical experience, but her interest extends to theatrical
productions as well.
An active member of Ram's Head, Shapiro was first
onstage at Stanford in the 1988 production of "Jesus Christ
Superstar." As a sophomore she was assistant director ol "A
Chorus Line," and as a junior she vocal directed both "Gai
eties" and "Fvita." This year, Shapiro was head composer
and director for Gaieties '90: "Anachrophobia" and then
returned to the stage for "Into the Woods."
This Friday promises to conclude Shapiro's Stanford
musical career on a triumphant note. She will give a recital
of her original classical compositions, including the "Mag
nificat," winner of a humanities award this year.
Intermission: When and how did you first become involved
with music?
Carolyn Shapiro: Well, I guess my first exposure to music
was with piano. I started when I was six or seven, the nor
mal age to start taking piano, and I just really took to it. 1
didn't practice a lot, of course, nobody ever does, but I really
liked it. I started singing when I was in elementary school.
Then when I was around 13,1 did operetta workshops in
the summer. We did four Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in a
row each summer: "HMS Pinafore," then "Mikada," then
"Pirates," then "Gondaliers." So I was just completely inun
dated with Gilbert and Sullivan, and their "conventional
progressions." Everything is just so predictable.... I think
it's great for kids, just because, in a way, it's so simple.
I: So what was your first composition?
CS: When I was 13, I wrote this little operetta £ la Gilbert
and Sullivan. It was called "Prince or Peasant" and it was
probably about 45 minutes to an hour long. My younger sis
ter and I put it on for our family once, just playing all the
parts ourselves.
It's a cute little play, the standard Gilbert and Sullivan
story about the pauper who's really a prince, but nobody
knows it until the end.

The characters sing songs like (singing quietly), "Finally
we are out of school, no more learning the golden rule, now
we can go play in the pool, we are out of school." I still have
the whole thing. I wrote it out meticulously. I didn't go out
to the arcade and stuff when I was 13; I would sit at home
and write out my little notes perfectly.
I: Did your parents encourage your music?
CS: Yeah, I mean, my parents have just always supported
whatever I've wanted to do. They weren't necessarily sup
porting me specifically in music, no more than anything
else They wouldn't really even make me practice piano.
My mom would just send me to lessons, and if I didn't prac
tice I would go to my lesson anyway and be miserable....
They aren't like the "stage parents" type. They just wanted
me to do it for fun and take it as far as I wanted to.
I: Are your parents musical?
CS: No, not really. My dad is kind of inherently musical, but
he's never had any lessons at all; he can play things by ear
really well and it impresses me to death.
My mom likes Oingo Boirigo, but that's about it.
I: Did you come to Stanford knowing you were going to do
music?
CS: Yeah, I really knew I was going to do music, but I'm also
majoring in English. I always liked English; I took a few
classes at first, the ones I was really interested in, like mod
ern poetry and modern American stuff. This last year I've
had to take courses on Shakespeare and the Renaissance,
which weren't quite as fun, but I'm glad I did it anyway.
I: Do you see yourself as primarily a writer or a performer?
CS: I'd definitely much rather write. I don't see myself as a
performer. I used to be more interested in piano. I never
really sang except for fun, and I never really took lessons
until college. I really like to perform, but I would never per
form piano. I get so nervous that my knees shake and I can't
even press the pedals down. Singing, I just get nervous that
I'm going to forget the words, but it's not as bad.
I: Do you have a favorite piece that you've composed?
CS: Well, I think the "Magnificat" in this concert is going to
definitely be my greatest accomplishment. I hope. I've just
been working on it for so long that I can't believe it's going
to be finished. Well, the first draft of it at least. It's five
movements.
The theme to the first movement I found when I was a
senior in high school, and I was looking through these little
sketch books that I had written when I was about 14.1 used
to write down little ideas. And I found this one idea, just of
building up on thirds, minor thirds and major thirds. I just
thought, "Gee that sounds kind of interesting. Let's put
some words to it." Since at the time in high school we were
doing a "Magnificat," I said "OK, here's some words." I
wasn't particularly inspired by them, but they are, like for
many composer before me, a tool to write music to.
Unlike other things I have written pieces to, I don't feel
like I have to pay so much attention to the text. It's Latin and
it's just a standard traditional text that people have inter
preted so many different ways already that I feel it's some
thing my music can kind of guide. Some other pieces I write
are more textually determined. Like the piece I wrote on a
poem by June Jordan called "Poem for South African
Women." I just love the poem so much that I feel it has to
guide the music. 1 really had to do justice to the text,
whereas with the "Magnificat," I really felt like I could do
what I wanted musically and the text would just follow.
I: Do you prefer to write "serious" music like the "Magnifi
cat" or more "fun" stuff like rock tunes for your band?
CS: First of all, strangely enough, I think I have an easier
time writing serious music. I've always had a really hard
time writing upbeat things. So I think that's one thing that
I would really like to be able to do more, just write upbeat,
happy things.
I guess I get the most "profound" pleasure out of writing
"serious" or classical music, but at the same time it takes so
much out of me. I'll spend three hours working on some
thing, or however long, and there just comes a time when I
reach the threshold and I just grab the book, throw it across
the room and say I never want to see it again. Then I'll come
back to it in a couple of days when it's new and fresh and
I'm ready to work on it again.
Rock music, it's draining in it's own way, mostly because

you have to work with other people; it's not just you. You
have to communicate your ideas to other people and you
have to take in their ideas, so that's hard. Rut there's some
thing so rewarding about that, about people who are writ
ing things together.
It's so hard for people who aren't in a band situation to
understand writing together. Like the common question
"Who writes the songs?" Well, we all write the songs. Usu
ally someone will bring in an idea, but the song really
evolves within all of us.
But mainly I just write classical stuff, or whatever you
want to call it... I teach music to little kids and 1 always try
not to use the word "classical" because it has too many con
notations of 18th century or whatever it is that people think
of when you say "classical."
I: Could you describe the band (Screw) a little more?
CS: (smiling)h's a great band. We do all originals ... it's
alternative, but not real far out. It's sort of a la Pixies or
something like that. The Breeders, Pixies, lane's Addiction
and Extasy, those are our four favorites.
I: Do you find yourself torn between your classical music
and the band?

CS: No, I think they really complement each other. They're
both such a great release, but in such different ways. They
just appeal to different parts of your personality. And I
think (smiling) both of those parts of my personality really
need attention.
I: So do you plan to stay in music as a profession?
CS: I don't know ... that's so hard. I would love to, more
than anything. Before this year I was really kind of 50-50
between going into English and music. But this past year
being so involved in music has really shown me how much
1 love it, just can't live without it.
I'm teaching right now and I really like that also. I teach
music to first through sixth graders at a school in Palo Alto.
And that's really fun. So teaching is something that I also
would consider.
I: What are your plans for next year?
CS: I'm going to still work at the [elementary] school,
teaching music. It's a great job. They're really flexible and
the kids are great. So I'm really excited about being there a
lot more next year. That will also give me time to write and
work on whatever else I want to work on outside. I won't be
living like a queen, but there'll be enough ....

than anything. Before this year I was really kind of 50-50
between going into English and music. But this past year
being so involved in music has really shown me how much
1 love it, just can't live without it.
I'm teaching right now and I really like that also. I teach
music to first through sixth graders at a school in Palo Alto.
And that's really fun. So teaching is something that I also
would consider.
I: What are your plans for next year?
CS: I'm going to still work at the [elementary] school,
teaching music. It's a great job. They're really flexible and
the kids are great. So I'm really excited about being there a
lot more next year. That will also give me time to write and
work on whatever else I want to work on outside. I won't be
living like a queen, but there'll be enough ....


Composing is
nothing new for
senior Carolyn
Shapiro, who is
completing her
honors work in
music, but wrote
her first operetta
at age 13.

Marin Melchior — Daily
For many, thinking about com
posers brings to mind images of
eccentric men, oddly shaped white
wigs, fitted breeches and scenes from the
movie "Amadeus."
Composers aren't supposed to be red
headed, green-eyed bundles of energy
"on their way to Grandmother's house."
Right?
Wrong.
These are the '90s, and creative, ener
getic women like Carolyn Shapiro are
achieving recognition as accomplished
composers in their male-dominated
field.
No longer sporting the precious red cape from her role
as Little Red Riding Hood in Ram's Head's recent produc
tion of "Into the Woods," Shapiro's petite frame is now
enveloped in a comfortable, oversized sweater and an
equally comfortable, equally oversized blazer.
Her faded jeans are worn and comfortable and it looks
like Shapiro probably had to retrieve them from her
mother's Goodwill collection a few times — because they're
so comfortable.
What's the theme here? Comfort.
While energetic and ambitious, Shapiro is comfortable
with herself — as a person and as a composer. She is
forthright about her opinions, and while far from compla
cent, she appears fulfilled by her accomplishments thus far.
Although she is probably most recognizable as the for
mer lead singer of the campus band, Marci and the Moon
gods, Shapiro has been involved in a variety of musical
groups at Stanford, including the Stanford Chamber
Chorale, Early Music Singers and her current alternative
rock band, Screw. Obviously, Shapiro has a wide range of
musical experience, but her interest extends to theatrical
productions as well.
An active member of Ram's Head, Shapiro was first
onstage at Stanford in the 1988 production of "Jesus Christ
Superstar." As a sophomore she was assistant director ol "A
Chorus Line," and as a junior she vocal directed both "Gai
eties" and "Fvita." This year, Shapiro was head composer
and director for Gaieties '90: "Anachrophobia" and then
returned to the stage for "Into the Woods."
This Friday promises to conclude Shapiro's Stanford
musical career on a triumphant note. She will give a recital
of her original classical compositions, including the "Mag
nificat," winner of a humanities award this year.
Intermission: When and how did you first become involved
with music?
Carolyn Shapiro: Well, I guess my first exposure to music
was with piano. I started when I was six or seven, the nor
mal age to start taking piano, and I just really took to it. 1
didn't practice a lot, of course, nobody ever does, but I really
liked it. I started singing when I was in elementary school.
Then when I was around 13,1 did operetta workshops in
the summer. We did four Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in a
row each summer: "HMS Pinafore," then "Mikada," then
"Pirates," then "Gondaliers." So I was just completely inun
dated with Gilbert and Sullivan, and their "conventional
progressions." Everything is just so predictable.... I think
it's great for kids, just because, in a way, it's so simple.
I: So what was your first composition?
CS: When I was 13, I wrote this little operetta £ la Gilbert
and Sullivan. It was called "Prince or Peasant" and it was
probably about 45 minutes to an hour long. My younger sis
ter and I put it on for our family once, just playing all the
parts ourselves.
It's a cute little play, the standard Gilbert and Sullivan
story about the pauper who's really a prince, but nobody
knows it until the end.

The characters sing songs like (singing quietly), "Finally
we are out of school, no more learning the golden rule, now
we can go play in the pool, we are out of school." I still have
the whole thing. I wrote it out meticulously. I didn't go out
to the arcade and stuff when I was 13; I would sit at home
and write out my little notes perfectly.
I: Did your parents encourage your music?
CS: Yeah, I mean, my parents have just always supported
whatever I've wanted to do. They weren't necessarily sup
porting me specifically in music, no more than anything
else They wouldn't really even make me practice piano.
My mom would just send me to lessons, and if I didn't prac
tice I would go to my lesson anyway and be miserable....
They aren't like the "stage parents" type. They just wanted
me to do it for fun and take it as far as I wanted to.
I: Are your parents musical?
CS: No, not really. My dad is kind of inherently musical, but
he's never had any lessons at all; he can play things by ear
really well and it impresses me to death.
My mom likes Oingo Boirigo, but that's about it.
I: Did you come to Stanford knowing you were going to do
music?
CS: Yeah, I really knew I was going to do music, but I'm also
majoring in English. I always liked English; I took a few
classes at first, the ones I was really interested in, like mod
ern poetry and modern American stuff. This last year I've
had to take courses on Shakespeare and the Renaissance,
which weren't quite as fun, but I'm glad I did it anyway.
I: Do you see yourself as primarily a writer or a performer?
CS: I'd definitely much rather write. I don't see myself as a
performer. I used to be more interested in piano. I never
really sang except for fun, and I never really took lessons
until college. I really like to perform, but I would never per
form piano. I get so nervous that my knees shake and I can't
even press the pedals down. Singing, I just get nervous that
I'm going to forget the words, but it's not as bad.
I: Do you have a favorite piece that you've composed?
CS: Well, I think the "Magnificat" in this concert is going to
definitely be my greatest accomplishment. I hope. I've just
been working on it for so long that I can't believe it's going
to be finished. Well, the first draft of it at least. It's five
movements.
The theme to the first movement I found when I was a
senior in high school, and I was looking through these little
sketch books that I had written when I was about 14.1 used
to write down little ideas. And I found this one idea, just of
building up on thirds, minor thirds and major thirds. I just
thought, "Gee that sounds kind of interesting. Let's put
some words to it." Since at the time in high school we were
doing a "Magnificat," I said "OK, here's some words." I
wasn't particularly inspired by them, but they are, like for
many composer before me, a tool to write music to.
Unlike other things I have written pieces to, I don't feel
like I have to pay so much attention to the text. It's Latin and
it's just a standard traditional text that people have inter
preted so many different ways already that I feel it's some
thing my music can kind of guide. Some other pieces I write
are more textually determined. Like the piece I wrote on a
poem by June Jordan called "Poem for South African
Women." I just love the poem so much that I feel it has to
guide the music. 1 really had to do justice to the text,
whereas with the "Magnificat," I really felt like I could do
what I wanted musically and the text would just follow.
I: Do you prefer to write "serious" music like the "Magnifi
cat" or more "fun" stuff like rock tunes for your band?
CS: First of all, strangely enough, I think I have an easier
time writing serious music. I've always had a really hard
time writing upbeat things. So I think that's one thing that
I would really like to be able to do more, just write upbeat,
happy things.
I guess I get the most "profound" pleasure out of writing
"serious" or classical music, but at the same time it takes so
much out of me. I'll spend three hours working on some
thing, or however long, and there just comes a time when I
reach the threshold and I just grab the book, throw it across
the room and say I never want to see it again. Then I'll come
back to it in a couple of days when it's new and fresh and
I'm ready to work on it again.
Rock music, it's draining in it's own way, mostly because

you have to work with other people; it's not just you. You
have to communicate your ideas to other people and you
have to take in their ideas, so that's hard. Rut there's some
thing so rewarding about that, about people who are writ
ing things together.
It's so hard for people who aren't in a band situation to
understand writing together. Like the common question
"Who writes the songs?" Well, we all write the songs. Usu
ally someone will bring in an idea, but the song really
evolves within all of us.
But mainly I just write classical stuff, or whatever you
want to call it... I teach music to little kids and 1 always try
not to use the word "classical" because it has too many con
notations of 18th century or whatever it is that people think
of when you say "classical."
I: Could you describe the band (Screw) a little more?
CS: (smiling)h's a great band. We do all originals ... it's
alternative, but not real far out. It's sort of a la Pixies or
something like that. The Breeders, Pixies, lane's Addiction
and Extasy, those are our four favorites.
I: Do you find yourself torn between your classical music
and the band?

CS: No, I think they really complement each other. They're
both such a great release, but in such different ways. They
just appeal to different parts of your personality. And I
think (smiling) both of those parts of my personality really
need attention.
I: So do you plan to stay in music as a profession?
CS: I don't know ... that's so hard. I would love to, more
than anything. Before this year I was really kind of 50-50
between going into English and music. But this past year

"Who writes the songs?" Well, we all write the songs. Usu
ally someone will bring in an idea, but the song really
evolves within all of us.
But mainly I just write classical stuff, or whatever you
want to call it... I teach music to little kids and 1 always try
not to use the word "classical" because it has too many con
notations of 18th century or whatever it is that people think
of when you say "classical."
I: Could you describe the band (Screw) a little more?
CS: (smiling)h's a great band. We do all originals ... it's
alternative, but not real far out. It's sort of a la Pixies or
something like that. The Breeders, Pixies, lane's Addiction
and Extasy, those are our four favorites.
I: Do you find yourself torn between your classical music
and the band?

CS: No, I think they really complement each other. They're
both such a great release, but in such different ways. They
just appeal to different parts of your personality. And I
think (smiling) both of those parts of my personality really
need attention.
I: So do you plan to stay in music as a profession?
CS: I don't know ... that's so hard. I would love to, more
than anything. Before this year I was really kind of 50-50
between going into English and music. But this past year
being so involved in music has really shown me how much
1 love it, just can't live without it.
I'm teaching right now and I really like that also. I teach
music to first through sixth graders at a school in Palo Alto.
And that's really fun. So teaching is something that I also
would consider.
I: What are your plans for next year?
CS: I'm going to still work at the [elementary] school,
teaching music. It's a great job. They're really flexible and
the kids are great. So I'm really excited about being there a
lot more next year. That will also give me time to write and
work on whatever else I want to work on outside. I won't be
living like a queen, but there'll be enough ....


Composing is
nothing new for
senior Carolyn
Shapiro, who is
completing her
honors work in
music, but wrote
her first operetta
at age 13.

For many, thinking about com
posers brings to mind images of
eccentric men, oddly shaped white
wigs, fitted breeches and scenes from the
movie "Amadeus."
Composers aren't supposed to be red
headed, green-eyed bundles of energy
"on their way to Grandmother's house."
Right?
Wrong.
These are the '90s, and creative, ener
getic women like Carolyn Shapiro are
achieving recognition as accomplished
composers in their male-dominated
field.
No longer sporting the precious red cape from her role
as Little Red Riding Hood in Ram's Head's recent produc
tion of "Into the Woods," Shapiro's petite frame is now
enveloped in a comfortable, oversized sweater and an
equally comfortable, equally oversized blazer.
Her faded jeans are worn and comfortable and it looks
like Shapiro probably had to retrieve them from her
mother's Goodwill collection a few times — because they're
so comfortable.
What's the theme here? Comfort.
While energetic and ambitious, Shapiro is comfortable
with herself — as a person and as a composer. She is
forthright about her opinions, and while far from compla
cent, she appears fulfilled by her accomplishments thus far.
Although she is probably most recognizable as the for
mer lead singer of the campus band, Marci and the Moon
gods, Shapiro has been involved in a variety of musical
groups at Stanford, including the Stanford Chamber
Chorale, Early Music Singers and her current alternative
rock band, Screw. Obviously, Shapiro has a wide range of
musical experience, but her interest extends to theatrical
productions as well.
An active member of Ram's Head, Shapiro was first
onstage at Stanford in the 1988 production of "Jesus Christ
Superstar." As a sophomore she was assistant director ol "A
Chorus Line," and as a junior she vocal directed both "Gai
eties" and "Fvita." This year, Shapiro was head composer
and director for Gaieties '90: "Anachrophobia" and then
returned to the stage for "Into the Woods."
This Friday promises to conclude Shapiro's Stanford
musical career on a triumphant note. She will give a recital
of her original classical compositions, including the "Mag
nificat," winner of a humanities award this year.
Intermission: When and how did you first become involved
with music?
Carolyn Shapiro: Well, I guess my first exposure to music
was with piano. I started when I was six or seven, the nor
mal age to start taking piano, and I just really took to it. 1
didn't practice a lot, of course, nobody ever does, but I really
liked it. I started singing when I was in elementary school.
Then when I was around 13,1 did operetta workshops in
the summer. We did four Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in a
row each summer: "HMS Pinafore," then "Mikada," then
"Pirates," then "Gondaliers." So I was just completely inun
dated with Gilbert and Sullivan, and their "conventional
progressions." Everything is just so predictable.... I think
it's great for kids, just because, in a way, it's so simple.
I: So what was your first composition?
CS: When I was 13, I wrote this little operetta £ la Gilbert
and Sullivan. It was called "Prince or Peasant" and it was
probably about 45 minutes to an hour long. My younger sis
ter and I put it on for our family once, just playing all the
parts ourselves.
It's a cute little play, the standard Gilbert and Sullivan
story about the pauper who's really a prince, but nobody
knows it until the end.

The characters sing songs like (singing quietly), "Finally
we are out of school, no more learning the golden rule, now
we can go play in the pool, we are out of school." I still have
the whole thing. I wrote it out meticulously. I didn't go out
to the arcade and stuff when I was 13; I would sit at home
and write out my little notes perfectly.
I: Did your parents encourage your music?
CS: Yeah, I mean, my parents have just always supported
whatever I've wanted to do. They weren't necessarily sup
porting me specifically in music, no more than anything
else They wouldn't really even make me practice piano.
My mom would just send me to lessons, and if I didn't prac
tice I would go to my lesson anyway and be miserable....
They aren't like the "stage parents" type. They just wanted
me to do it for fun and take it as far as I wanted to.
I: Are your parents musical?
CS: No, not really. My dad is kind of inherently musical, but
he's never had any lessons at all; he can play things by ear
really well and it impresses me to death.
My mom likes Oingo Boirigo, but that's about it.
I: Did you come to Stanford knowing you were going to do
music?
CS: Yeah, I really knew I was going to do music, but I'm also
majoring in English. I always liked English; I took a few
classes at first, the ones I was really interested in, like mod
ern poetry and modern American stuff. This last year I've
had to take courses on Shakespeare and the Renaissance,
which weren't quite as fun, but I'm glad I did it anyway.
I: Do you see yourself as primarily a writer or a performer?
CS: I'd definitely much rather write. I don't see myself as a
performer. I used to be more interested in piano. I never
really sang except for fun, and I never really took lessons
until college. I really like to perform, but I would never per
form piano. I get so nervous that my knees shake and I can't
even press the pedals down. Singing, I just get nervous that
I'm going to forget the words, but it's not as bad.
I: Do you have a favorite piece that you've composed?
CS: Well, I think the "Magnificat" in this concert is going to
definitely be my greatest accomplishment. I hope. I've just
been working on it for so long that I can't believe it's going
to be finished. Well, the first draft of it at least. It's five
movements.
The theme to the first movement I found when I was a
senior in high school, and I was looking through these little
sketch books that I had written when I was about 14.1 used
to write down little ideas. And I found this one idea, just of
building up on thirds, minor thirds and major thirds. I just
thought, "Gee that sounds kind of interesting. Let's put
some words to it." Since at the time in high school we were
doing a "Magnificat," I said "OK, here's some words." I
wasn't particularly inspired by them, but they are, like for
many composer before me, a tool to write music to.
Unlike other things I have written pieces to, I don't feel
like I have to pay so much attention to the text. It's Latin and
it's just a standard traditional text that people have inter
preted so many different ways already that I feel it's some
thing my music can kind of guide. Some other pieces I write
are more textually determined. Like the piece I wrote on a
poem by June Jordan called "Poem for South African
Women." I just love the poem so much that I feel it has to
guide the music. 1 really had to do justice to the text,
whereas with the "Magnificat," I really felt like I could do
what I wanted musically and the text would just follow.
I: Do you prefer to write "serious" music like the "Magnifi
cat" or more "fun" stuff like rock tunes for your band?
CS: First of all, strangely enough, I think I have an easier
time writing serious music. I've always had a really hard
time writing upbeat things. So I think that's one thing that
I would really like to be able to do more, just write upbeat,
happy things.
I guess I get the most "profound" pleasure out of writing
"serious" or classical music, but at the same time it takes so
much out of me. I'll spend three hours working on some
thing, or however long, and there just comes a time when I
reach the threshold and I just grab the book, throw it across
the room and say I never want to see it again. Then I'll come
back to it in a couple of days when it's new and fresh and
I'm ready to work on it again.
Rock music, it's draining in it's own way, mostly because

you have to work with other people; it's not just you. You
have to communicate your ideas to other people and you
have to take in their ideas, so that's hard. Rut there's some
thing so rewarding about that, about people who are writ
ing things together.
It's so hard for people who aren't in a band situation to
understand writing together. Like the common question
"Who writes the songs?" Well, we all write the songs. Usu
ally someone will bring in an idea, but the song really
evolves within all of us.
