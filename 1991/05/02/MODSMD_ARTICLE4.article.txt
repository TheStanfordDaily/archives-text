Stanford researchers have
found that an unusual bacterium
may play a major role in the devel
opment of stomach cancer.
The most common type of
stomach cancer is linked to a bac
terium called helicobacter pylori,
according to the researchers'
report, which was released yester
day in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute. The researchers
discovered that virtually all of
their patients with gastric intesti
nal cancer are infected with the
bacterium.
Stomach cancer is the ninth
largest cancer killer in the United
States, with an estimated 24,600
cases and 14,200 deaths annually,
according to government studies.

It is common elsewhere and has
reached epidemic status in some
areas of Asia and South America.
The bacterium infects about 30
to 40 percent of the American pop
ulation. About one in 5,000 of
those infected develop the most
gastric intestinal cancer, said Dr.
Julie Parsonnet, the associate pro
fessor of medicine and epidemiolo
gist who conducted the study.
The bacteria are considered
unusual because they can survive
in powerful stomach acids. It is
not known how they spread.
"If you don't have the bac
terium, you are very unlikely to
get the stomach cancer," Parson
net said.
"We think it's not necessarily
the bacterium, but the inflamma
