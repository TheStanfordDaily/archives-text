# Stanford study links bacterium, stomach cancer

Stanford researchers have
found that an unusual bacterium
may play a major role in the devel
opment of stomach cancer.
The most common type of
stomach cancer is linked to a bac
terium called helicobacter pylori,
according to the researchers'
report, which was released yester
day in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute. The researchers
discovered that virtually all of
their patients with gastric intesti
nal cancer are infected with the
bacterium.
Stomach cancer is the ninth
largest cancer killer in the United
States, with an estimated 24,600
cases and 14,200 deaths annually,
according to government studies.

It is common elsewhere and has
reached epidemic status in some
areas of Asia and South America.
The bacterium infects about 30
to 40 percent of the American pop
ulation. About one in 5,000 of
those infected develop the most
gastric intestinal cancer, said Dr.
Julie Parsonnet, the associate pro
fessor of medicine and epidemiolo
gist who conducted the study.
The bacteria are considered
unusual because they can survive
in powerful stomach acids. It is
not known how they spread.
"If you don't have the bac
terium, you are very unlikely to
get the stomach cancer," Parson
net said.
"We think it's not necessarily
the bacterium, but the inflamma
tion which leads to the cancer,"
she said. The inflammation might
cause a rapid division of cells and
hence an increased risk for muta
tion. In addition, the inflamma
tion produces hazardous products
that could create mutagens —
substances that cause mutations
— in the stomach, she said.
The study involved 59 patients
with two different types of stom
ach cancer. Of the 37 patients
with the most common form, 33
patients — 89.2 percent of the
total — were found to have the
bacteria. In gastric tissue removed
from the patients with the other,
less common type of cancer, how
ever, the bacteria were found in
only 31.8 percent. The study took
place from 1985 to 1989.
The stomach cancer linked to
the bacterium is called "intesti
nal-type gastric adenocarcinoma,"
or gastric intestinal cancer,
because the malignant cells
resemble intestinal tissue when
viewed under a microscope.
Parsonnet said it is unlikely the
association between the bac
terium and the cancer is "coinci

dental," although more definitive
studies are necessary. She added
that she is currently working on a
follow-up study to see if people
who are infected with the bac
terium are likely to develop gas
tric intestinal cancer.
She said there is good prelimi
nary data supporting the linkage.
If scientists figure out the molecu
lar mechanism by which the bac
terium causes cancer, the connec
tion will be more definitely
accepted, she added.
Parsonnet said she does not
think these findings alone will
help develop a cure for stomach
cancer. A combination of factors
cause intestinal cancer, Parsonnet
said, and infection alone is not
enough.
However, the study may help to
understand how to prevent can
cer. "We can figure out who is at
high-risk," she said. The cancer
could be prevented by either pre
venting the bacterial infection or
limiting the effects of the inflam
mation, she added.
Stomach cancer is a major
problem in under-developed coun
tries, perhaps because of generally
high rates of infection and poor
diet, Parsonnet said.
