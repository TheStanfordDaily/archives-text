"Mortal Thoughts," starring
Demi Moore and Bruce Willis
A cutesy husband-loves-wife-and
life-is-soooo-perfect film.
.When I heard that "Mortal
Thoughts" starred the fab duo of
Bruce and Demi, that's what I was
expecting.
I was ready to write about a nice
movie. A mellow movie. A movie that
just makes you feel all warm and toasty

and content.
Whatever.
There I was, in the middle of this
empty theater (no one goes to the 2:55
showings; it's a great reality escape).
And, instead of a feel-good movie, I
got:
• Gory murders.
OK, only two, but we see old Bruce
die twice. And blood soaks through
everything. It was a little weird watch
ing the heroic "Die Hard" man go, but
in this film, he deserved it. Willis plays
the scummy, lazy, wife-beating, dis
gusting, mean, drug-addicted lames
excellently.
Eventually, James is killed. I have to
tell you, I was glad. loyce and Cynthia,
Joyce's best friend, devise a huge and

faulty coverup. But who is really guilty,
if anyone? Well, I won't te11....
• New Jersey.
Depending on your point of view,
this is perhaps THE reason to either
love or hate the film. But let's not rag
on Jersey.
• East Coast accents.
Funny. Especially living in sunny
California.
All of the actors could have said
"yous" a little more for authenticity.
"Whadda yous want? Where are yous
goin' ?" — like that.
Demi had some problems with the
"Joysey" speak. She asked for "wah
tuh" fabulously, but she kept slipping
in and out of the mode.
She may be beautiful, but Demi s
no Meryl Streep.
• Social commentary.
Joyce and James get married;
instead of bliss, they have problems.
Big problems. James is an abusive
sleaze. I couldn't understand why the
J's got married. He started on his
power-and-control trip making
demands at their wedding. I hated
him.

For yous (go accent!) who have a
problem with the justice system, this
movie does expose inequities in the
process which deals with the horrible
trap of the battered wife. What is jus
tice? Where is the law? Very deep
thoughts.
• Confusion. Are you a little lost? So
was I.
I left saying "I don't get it. What
happened?"
Did Cynthia's "mortal thoughts"
convince her of innocence? Did she
actually kill her real-life hubby? Is
Cynthia's testimony in the station true?
Why did the second murder happen?
What happened at the end? AAHHH
HHH!!!!
If you have nothing better to do,
and want some pseudo-controversy —
should someone go to jail, what's
wrong with America, etc. — then see
"Mortal Thoughts." It is NOT a drop
everything-now movie, but I didn't
hate it. It's OK.
If yous wanna just kick back for two
ow-ahs or whudeva, go.
If not, just wait for the video.
