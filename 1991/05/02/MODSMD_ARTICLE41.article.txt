# Film exploration of gay and lesbian themes
## 
### Jen Sey 
Homosexuality is rarely addressed by the main
stream media and is nonexistent in the realm of Hol
lywood formula pictures. Nevertheless, a few
"brave," socially conscious, artistically inclined film
makers have challenged unexamined assumptions
about sexuality and entered into the "forbidden" ter
ritory of bisexual, gay and lesbian relationships.
Alternative filmmakers have taken it upon them
selves to introduce this stigmatized topic to Ameri
can audiences. For the most part, these films have
appeared in art houses rather than first-run theaters.
Since 1982, a handful of films have been released
which have sensitively and realistically (though not
completely) depicted homosexual relationships.
Some of these films have dealt with this topic as the
primary theme; others have included homosexuality
as an incidental aspect of society.
The depiction of explicit gay and lesbian sex
scenes has consistently met with controversy as the
faint-hearted mainstream audience is troubled when
the traditional social structure is blatantly chal
lenged. Yet, filmmakers have dealt most sensitively
and effectively with this issue, portraying the sensu
ality and passion inherent in all forms of mutually
consensual sexual relations.

I believe that the following six films (all currently
available for rental) are the best of the limited few in
their depiction of homosexual relationships. Though

many have met with criticism, accused of not being
fully representative of the homosexual experience,
each has managed to delve into previously unex
plored territory and present a sensitive picture of gay
and lesbian relationships.
While imprisoned together in
South America, the two men
slowly come to understand and
care for each other.
"Personal Best" (1982) is the story of two young
women training for the 1980 Olympic Games. The
athletes (played by Mariel Hemingway and Patrice
Donnelly) are friends, teammates and lovers.
Though the primary theme of the film is the dedica
tion and perseverance involved in preparing for the
Olympics, the relationship of the two women is dealt
with in an honest and non-exploitative manner.
"Kiss of the Spider Woman" (1985) is the
somber, shocking tale of a gay window dresser
(William Hurt) and a political revolutionary (Raul
Julia). While imprisoned together in South America,
the two men slowly come to understand and care for
each other. Eventually, socially prescribed barriers
break down and the men make love â€” an act that
confirms their humanity.

Set on a "divorce ranch" in 1959, "Desert Hearts"
traces the relationship between a young, openly les
bian woman and an older, introverted professor. The
characters are convincingly portrayed by Helen
Shaver and Patricia Charbonneau. Each brings
humor and perceptiveness to her role in this touch
ing, character sketch-like film.
The 1988 screen adaptation of the prize-winning
play, "Torch Song THlogy" tells the semi-autobio
graphical story of its star, Harvey Fierstein. As an
insecure female impersonator, Fierstein is in search
of the ultimate monogamous love relationship. Anne
Bancroft brings a touch of humor to this drama as
the stubborn Jewish mother.
"Long Time Companion" (1990) follows the
spread of AIDS over the course of a nine-year period
among a close-knit group of gay friends. Emotions
are traced among these men from the mysterious
beginnings of the virus to the catastrophic losses that
leave them frightened and angry. Though criticized
as depicting the gay community in a severely limited
fashion, much can be learned from this personalized
account of the AIDS tragedy.
Finally, also released in 1990, "Henry and June"
details the sexual awakening of writer Anais Nin. Her
diary is adapted to the screen in a sensitively erotic
manner. The young woman comes to terms with her
sexuality through varied experimentation including
voyeurism, aggressive seduction and lesbian love
making.
