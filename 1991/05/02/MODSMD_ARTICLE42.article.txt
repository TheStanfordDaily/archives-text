Music to make

"Goo"
Sonic Youth
I sat on the bus, riding through
New York City on the way back to the
airport after my sister's wedding this
weekend. It was rainy and dismal as 1
stared out the window at metallic
skyscrapers, abandoned apartment
buildings, bums on street corners and
distant factories billowing smoke into
the air.
On my Walkman, Sonic Youth's
"Goo" was playing. And somehow, it
fit perfectly. The violent, apocalyptic,
eerie and dark music on "Goo" cap
tures the experience of urban living
and frustrated youth in the '90s.
Playing "Goo" in the sunny atmo
sphere of Stanford elicits a distinctly
different reaction from friends. "What
is this crap? It's just noise," they com
plain. "This must be the music they
play in hell!"
My friends should just consider
themselves lucky that I'm not playing
earlier, noisier Sonic Youth albums like
"Daydream Nation," because "Goo" is
their most musical and accessible (and
probably their bestValbum to date.
I'm not about to deny that Sonic
Youth thrives on noise. Their love of
dissonance, distortion, feedback and
thrashing around has become their
trademark.
Sonic Youth's New York nightmare
music has its roots in the Velvet
Underground, but possesses a vision
ary chaotic sound all its own. Picture a
band improvising in the same key as
Jimi Hendrix's "Star Spangled Ban
ner," and you'll have an idea of what
Sonic Youth is all about.
Some of their albums may legiti
mately be considered impossible to lis
ten to, but not "Goo." On this album,
Sonic Youth still provides the noise

ambush, but they add some song
structure and great riffs too. This
album is filled with textured guitar
interplay, memorable bass lines and
even some melody.
Kim Gordon, the other great Kim
bassist of modern rock, lets her thick
New Jersey accent infuse these songs
with biting, streetwise vocals. On
"Kool Thing," she asserts female
authority while Chuck D. of Public
Enemy cheers her on in the back
ground.
On "Tunic," she sings about trying
to make it in a rock band while bur
dened with the discouraging words of
others; "you are never going any
where," people tell her. And her mom s
no more supportive, saying, "honey,
you look so underfed."
On other tracks, Thurston Moore
sings lead, giving Goo a nice blend ot
male and female vocal sounds.
Whether screamed, spoken or sung,
the occasionally discernible lyrics are
bitter, funny, chaotic and out of con
trol — just like the music.
Standout songs like "Dirty Boots,"
"Tunic," "Kool Thing," "Titanium
Expose" and "Cinderella's Big Score"
help make this one of the best albums
of 1990.
Sonic Youth is one of the few bands
with anything new to say, a refreshing
blast of raw passion in a landscape of
slickly produced product. If Jane's
Addiction breaks up, and the Pixies
continue their trend towards quirky
pop craftsmanship, Sonic Youth will
stand alone as the best of the cutting
edge.
But remember, this album is not for
the squeamish. The band amply dis
plays its fascination with sheer noise
like the race-car simulation on
"Scooter and Jinx," or the frighteninglv
annoying (or amusing, depending
upon your mood and taste) scream
fest on "Mildred Pierce." So, if you buy
this album, be prepared to have your
roommate move out. But it just might
be worth it.
