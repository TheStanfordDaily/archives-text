# Rollin', rollin', rollin': Who are those blading fools?
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
CASE STUDY #1: The Speed Addict
Walking, running and biking are
all becoming obsolete activities in
Geoff McDonald's life. If you didn't see
him walking around his dorm late at
night in Birkenstocks, you'd think the
sophomore was surgically attached to
his rollerblades.
He skates with such grace that he'd
never evoke the non-rollerblader's
scornful comment, "Look at that idiot
on rollerblades!" He skates with such
speed that anyone who did dare com
ment "Look at that idiot on
rollerblades!" would be promptly run
over.
McDonald, who has been blading
for nearly two years, says he races
cyclists to stay in shape. He estimates
that he attains up to 20 miles per hour,
and even more when flying down hills
out of control — something he tries to
avoid for health reasons.
A transfer student from hilly and
pebble-ridden Brown University,
McDonald really appreciates the
smooth and flat Stanford campus.
Plus, McDonald is in better company
at Stanford; "I was the only one on

rollerblades at Brown," he says, not
waxing wistful in the least.
McDonald describes rollerblades as
"a dream come true." He has played ice
hockey since he was six, he explained:
"When I was little, I used to dream the
world was ice so I could skate all the
time. Now I can skate all the time, and
the world doesn't have to be ice."
With all the skating he does,
McDonald candidly admits that the
boots inside the skates have become
"raunchy." While he has no plans to
invest in a new pair of rollerblades, he
does foresee replacing the boots and
the wheels in the near future.
CASE STUDY #2: The Pain in the Leg
Junior Leilah Powell fears she may
become the "first casualty of overtight
[rollerblade] lacing."
After experiencing a recurring
nerve pain in her leg, Powell went to
Cowell. She says that when she pro
posed that the problem could have
come from rollerblading, the doctor
commented, "that's a possibility."
Powell adds that the doctor may
not have known what he was talking
about. "If I went to the doctor carrying
a leg in my hand, he probably would
have told me, 'There's something
wrong with your leg!'"

Undaunted by mcdical setbacks,
Powell continues to rollerblade around
campus and to class. The blades have
made her a more punctual student: "1
try to get to class on time now because
the rollerblades make an awful noise
when you stop. Screeching into class is
embarrassing," she explains.
Powell occasionally takes her skates
off after she arrives in class. On the
touchy subject of foot odor, Powell
confidently explains that she has noth
ing to worry about, "1 wear socks with
my skates, so my feet never smell," she
asserts.
Powell received the blades from her
five suitemates, who, after learning of
her obsession with the skates, bought
her a pair for her 21st birthday and
"plopped them onto her lap."
When seeking to impress, Powell
coordinates her clothing with her
black and teal skates. Her sister, senior
Laura Powell, also dons blades of the
same color, giving rise to their nick
name, "The Bobbsey Twins on Blades."
CASE STUDY #3: Clod in Neon
Senior "Neon Wheels" takes her
pseudonym from the bright yellow
laces and wheels of her blue
rollerblades. Neon Wheels, who also
goes by NeWhe (rhymes with kiwi),

bought her skates at a large sporting
goods store over spring break. She says
that after knocking over several fellow
shoppers while taking a sample run,
she fell in love with the rollerblades.
"It's just like bowling!" she exclaims.
Although NeWhe rides with special
rollerblader gloves to protect against
accidents, she says she is still not ready
to undertake tricky maneuvers. "I
don't yet feel comfortable cutting off
traffic and racing the Marguerite to the
mall," she explains.
Neon Wheels says her biggest blad
ing trauma occurred a mere three
minutes from her dorm. "I was skating
down the street, lurching backwards
and forwards trying to find a comfort
able stride. A little blonde girl walking
toward me pointed in my direction
and asked her mother, 'What is that
weird thing?"'
NeWhe pauses and shakes her
head, "I began cursing the bratty child
to myself. Then 1 heard a voice reply
from behind me, 'It's a ferret!' I turned
around and, to my relief, saw a woman
walking a small furry rodent. I smiled
at the sweet child and bladed off on my
way."

CASE STUDY #4: The Rollerblade
less Natural
Until recently, senior Rachel Oliker
regarded rollerbladers with contempt.
"I once watched a rollerblader in the
English Department fall down a flight
of stairs. After that 1 was convinced
that rollerblading was both silly and
dangerous."
However, after a friend of hers
invited her out for a spin on
rollerblades, Oliker was completely
transformed. "Once I got on them, I
couldn't take them off!" she exclaims.
"I just love them," she adds, her eyes
glazing over.
After 20 minutes on the skates,
Oliker was performing tricks. "I was a
natural!" she concedes. Oliker believes
her Russian heritage may have some
thing to do with her prowess on the
skates. "Russians love to skate and
they're really good at it," she explains.
(Although both Yeltsin and Gorbachev
were unavailable for confirmation, his
tory buffs will surely recall Catherine
the Great's frequent escapades around
the Summer Palace on her wheeled
piano bench.)
Now Oliker is cutting back on her

living expenses to save up for a pair of
rollerblades.
She is extremely excited about the
prospect of wearing rollerblades all the
time. "Once I get them, I'm going to
ride them to class, to the pool, to the
library, to parties. You name it, I'll
blade there!"
Oliker has already chosen a
rollerblading name: "I plan to call
myself Rollinßach," she says, rolling
her r's for emphasis.
CASE STUDY #5: Mr. Debbie
Thomas
Junior Greg Pelts is following in the
figure-skating tradition of Debbie
Thomas. Since there is no convenient
ice on the Stanford campus, he's doing
it instead on the pavement, on
rollerblades.
Pelts figure skated for over three
years before coming to Stanford. He's
now trying to convert his ice skating
abilities into rollerblading skill. While
he's mastered backward rollerblading
(A handy campus skill for avoiding
undesirable elements!), Pelts says he
still hasn't perfected his axles.

shoppers while taking a sample run,
she fell in love with the rollerblades.
"It's just like bowling!" she exclaims.
Although NeWhe rides with special
rollerblader gloves to protect against
accidents, she says she is still not ready
to undertake tricky maneuvers. "I
don't yet feel comfortable cutting off
traffic and racing the Marguerite to the
mall," she explains.
Neon Wheels says her biggest blad
ing trauma occurred a mere three
minutes from her dorm. "I was skating
down the street, lurching backwards
and forwards trying to find a comfort
able stride. A little blonde girl walking
toward me pointed in my direction
and asked her mother, 'What is that
weird thing?"'
NeWhe pauses and shakes her
head, "I began cursing the bratty child
to myself. Then 1 heard a voice reply
from behind me, 'It's a ferret!' I turned
around and, to my relief, saw a woman
walking a small furry rodent. I smiled
at the sweet child and bladed off on my
way."

CASE STUDY #4: The Rollerblade
less Natural
Until recently, senior Rachel Oliker
regarded rollerbladers with contempt.
"I once watched a rollerblader in the
English Department fall down a flight
of stairs. After that 1 was convinced
that rollerblading was both silly and
dangerous."
However, after a friend of hers
invited her out for a spin on
rollerblades, Oliker was completely
transformed. "Once I got on them, I
couldn't take them off!" she exclaims.
"I just love them," she adds, her eyes
glazing over.
After 20 minutes on the skates,
Oliker was performing tricks. "I was a
natural!" she concedes. Oliker believes
her Russian heritage may have some
thing to do with her prowess on the
skates. "Russians love to skate and
they're really good at it," she explains.
(Although both Yeltsin and Gorbachev
were unavailable for confirmation, his
tory buffs will surely recall Catherine
the Great's frequent escapades around
the Summer Palace on her wheeled
piano bench.)
Now Oliker is cutting back on her

living expenses to save up for a pair of
rollerblades.
She is extremely excited about the
prospect of wearing rollerblades all the
time. "Once I get them, I'm going to
ride them to class, to the pool, to the
library, to parties. You name it, I'll
blade there!"
Oliker has already chosen a
rollerblading name: "I plan to call
myself Rollinßach," she says, rolling
her r's for emphasis.
CASE STUDY #5: Mr. Debbie
Thomas
Junior Greg Pelts is following in the
figure-skating tradition of Debbie
Thomas. Since there is no convenient
ice on the Stanford campus, he's doing
it instead on the pavement, on
rollerblades.
Pelts figure skated for over three
years before coming to Stanford. He's
now trying to convert his ice skating
abilities into rollerblading skill. While
he's mastered backward rollerblading
(A handy campus skill for avoiding
undesirable elements!), Pelts says he
still hasn't perfected his axles.


AJ Green — Daily


They're quick.
They're cool. And
they're probably
crazy. Freshman
Kai Yamaguchi,
junior Leilah Pow
ell and physics
graduate student
Ben Tigner are
among the cam
pus' illustrious
rollerbladers.
CASE STUDY #1: The Speed Addict
Walking, running and biking are
all becoming obsolete activities in
Geoff McDonald's life. If you didn't see
him walking around his dorm late at
night in Birkenstocks, you'd think the
sophomore was surgically attached to
his rollerblades.
He skates with such grace that he'd
never evoke the non-rollerblader's
scornful comment, "Look at that idiot
on rollerblades!" He skates with such
speed that anyone who did dare com
ment "Look at that idiot on
rollerblades!" would be promptly run
over.
McDonald, who has been blading
for nearly two years, says he races
cyclists to stay in shape. He estimates
that he attains up to 20 miles per hour,
and even more when flying down hills
out of control — something he tries to
avoid for health reasons.
A transfer student from hilly and
pebble-ridden Brown University,
McDonald really appreciates the
smooth and flat Stanford campus.
Plus, McDonald is in better company
at Stanford; "I was the only one on

rollerblades at Brown," he says, not
waxing wistful in the least.
McDonald describes rollerblades as
"a dream come true." He has played ice
hockey since he was six, he explained:
"When I was little, I used to dream the
world was ice so I could skate all the
time. Now I can skate all the time, and
the world doesn't have to be ice."
With all the skating he does,
McDonald candidly admits that the
boots inside the skates have become
"raunchy." While he has no plans to
invest in a new pair of rollerblades, he
does foresee replacing the boots and
the wheels in the near future.
CASE STUDY #2: The Pain in the Leg
Junior Leilah Powell fears she may
become the "first casualty of overtight
[rollerblade] lacing."
After experiencing a recurring
nerve pain in her leg, Powell went to
Cowell. She says that when she pro
posed that the problem could have
come from rollerblading, the doctor
commented, "that's a possibility."
Powell adds that the doctor may
not have known what he was talking
about. "If I went to the doctor carrying
a leg in my hand, he probably would
have told me, 'There's something
wrong with your leg!'"

Undaunted by mcdical setbacks,
Powell continues to rollerblade around
campus and to class. The blades have
made her a more punctual student: "1
try to get to class on time now because
the rollerblades make an awful noise
when you stop. Screeching into class is
embarrassing," she explains.
Powell occasionally takes her skates
off after she arrives in class. On the
touchy subject of foot odor, Powell
confidently explains that she has noth
ing to worry about, "1 wear socks with
my skates, so my feet never smell," she
asserts.
Powell received the blades from her
five suitemates, who, after learning of
her obsession with the skates, bought
her a pair for her 21st birthday and
"plopped them onto her lap."
When seeking to impress, Powell
coordinates her clothing with her
black and teal skates. Her sister, senior
Laura Powell, also dons blades of the
same color, giving rise to their nick
name, "The Bobbsey Twins on Blades."
CASE STUDY #3: Clod in Neon
Senior "Neon Wheels" takes her
pseudonym from the bright yellow
laces and wheels of her blue
rollerblades. Neon Wheels, who also
goes by NeWhe (rhymes with kiwi),

bought her skates at a large sporting
goods store over spring break. She says
that after knocking over several fellow
shoppers while taking a sample run,
she fell in love with the rollerblades.
"It's just like bowling!" she exclaims.
Although NeWhe rides with special
rollerblader gloves to protect against
accidents, she says she is still not ready
