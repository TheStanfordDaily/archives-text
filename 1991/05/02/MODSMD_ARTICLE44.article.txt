British actor
is aged to
perfection

"An Evening with Peter Usti
nov" is playing at the Curran
Theater on 445 Geary St. until
May 26. Tickets are available
at the box office and through
BASS Ticket Centers.
"How entertaining could it possibly
be to go see an aged actor relate per
sonal anecdotes for over three hours?"
my friends asked.
"So this guy won two Oscars, three
Emmys and a Grammy — he's 70 years
old. And who cares if this show was a
'critically acclaimed hit from London's
West End'? Don't believe the hype,"
they said.
So I thought about it.
And decided my friends were right.
And that's why I skipped the silly
little program, "An Evening with Peter
Ustinov."
Yeah, right. I can live with people
thinking I'm foolish, but not
lobotomized.
Ustinov is one of the best things to
be entrenched within Western culture
since Nietzsche. Read his books; read
his plays — if you haven't already. If
you missed him in "Spartacus" or
"Death on the Nile," catch these films
at your local movie rental store. Do it
— now. Ignore your friends.
Don't waste any more time.
Ustinov is one of the all-time
greats, and I wouldn't have missed his
performance for anything. However,
he has — as humans tend to do —
grown older, and I was a little anxious
about seeing this man's mortality dis-

played onstage. My hesitation was
compounded by the feeling I had that
only an out-of-work performer need
ing money would do a show titled "An
Evening with..."
Perhaps Ustinov does need money. I
have no problem with that. I have no
qualms about buying a pity ticket to
see even the twilight of such a legend.
But Ustinov's show certainly stands on
its own.
For three hours the theatrical icon
struts his stuff, peppering his personal
anecdotes with skillful imperson
ations. And there certainly is a display
of mortality; the show is the celebra
tion of a life, not the milking of a rep
utation.
In addition to two sadistic school
masters and an aged Slavic uncle, Usti
nov's impersonations include various
recognizable personalities. His self
described "multicultural life" (his
term, not the Office of Residential
Education's) has run Ustinov across
Ronald "I forgot your name, son" Rea
gan, Nancy "What's your sign" Reagan,
Margaret "Wench" Thatcher and vari
ous cinematic and theatrical celebri
ties.
Ustinov's show pulls no punches,
yet this is no Diceman performance:
The barbs of satire and wit fly taste
fully, if frequently. Even though this
man has been knighted and encrusted
with awards, he avoids becoming
crusty. His satire shows off a lively
intelligence and sophisticated sense of
humor.
Ustinov is a skilled, energetic story
teller with some quality tales to tell.
While this performance is certainly not
worthy of awards or superlatives, it is
an uncommon opportunity to see a
living legend reflect and ruminate
about his life.
