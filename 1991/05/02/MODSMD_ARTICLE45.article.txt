The Best Little Boy in the World
John Reid
Ballantine Books, 213 pages
Warm, funny and unapologetic,
this painfully honest account of
adolescence paints an enlightened
portrait of growing up gay in a
straight world.
John Reid reveals the experi
ences of his childhood and young
adulthood, and how his parents,
not realizing that he was hiding a
secret too shocking to reveal,
referred to him as the "best little
boy in the world," i.e., one who
didn't masturbate, excelled in
sports and certainly wasn't gay.
One of the definitive works on
what it's really like to come out,
"The Best Little Boy" provides bril
liant and often hilarious insight
that shocks and delights with its
familiar ring.
And the Band Played On: Politics,
People and the AIDS Epidemic
Randy Shilts
Penguin Books, 640 pages
Why was AIDS allowed to
spread unchecked in the early '80s?
And why did our trusted insti
tutions ignore and/or deny this
threat?
In a masterpiece of investigative
reporting, Randy Shilts explores
these questions and creates the
landmark work that has become a
primary source in the AIDS debate.
Path-breaking and compelling,
with richly detailed narrative,
Shilts' informative work reads like a

mystery novel.
Twice Blessed: On Being lesbian,
(>ay and Jewish
Edited by Christie Balka
and Andy Rose
Beacon Press, 304 pages,
This collection of writings
explores the painful conflicts expe
rienced by individuals torn
between two powerful identities:
their Jewish heritage and gay or les
bian sexual preferences. Both iden
tities conflict with each other and
with America's predominantly
Christian and heterosexual society.
The pieces include personal tes
timonies, essays and oral histories.
The authors' backgrounds are var
ied, ranging from a lesbian rabbi to
Jewish parents of gay children.
Diverse in style, all the authors
exhibit critical thinking and
courage in their attempts to recon
cile religion and sexual orientation.
We Say We Love Each Other
Minnie Bruce Pratt
Spinsters/Aunt Lute, 98 pages,
Fierce and sensual, Minnie
Bruce Pratt's poetry speaks with a
powerful voice. Her poems are new
and original, exploring in wonder
ful detail her Southern heritage and
the love between women. Her sub
jects are universal: love, communi
cation, joy in mundane activities;
but her lesbian perspective grants
new insight into the familiar poetic
themes.
