It would be all too easy for a book
about campus politics to be either
blindly politically correct or knee-jerk
reactionary. Unlike most of the debate
on college campuses, though, Dinesh
D'Souza's exploration of the subject
shows a clear understanding of the
intellectual and social underpinnings
of both sides of the debate.
At the same time, D'Souza makes a
logical and compelling case for a new
way of addressing race and gender on
college campuses, an approach that
makes a more thoughtful combination
of the intellectual and social compo
nents of diversity and pluralism.
D'Souza makes use of six case stud
ies, including Stanford's Western Cul
ture debate, and several additional
anecdotes to critique the political cur
rents prevalent on university campuses
across the nation.
D'Souza has been criticized for
some errors in the factual presentation
of his book. For instance, he incor
rectly claims that Stanford News Ser
vice Director Bob Beyers resigned
shortly after the CIV controversy,
apparently in protest of the Univer
sity's actions. However, the bulk of
D'Souza's claims resonate with the
facts and were obtained from reliable
sources. Either way, the factual errors
do not destroy the validity of his main
arguments.
D'Souza uses a clear, straightfor
ward logic that displays a genuine
interest in the needs of students of
color, although he usually avoids the
term. A native of India who came to
the United States in 1978, D'Souza
claims a "special kinship" with minor
ity students and admits that the uni-

in the needs of students of
color, although he usually
avoids the term.

versity is an appropriate location "for
them to undertake their project of self
discovery." However, he argues, the
current approach is flawed.
D'Souza's first example is the "pro
portional representation" policy used
in UC-Berkeley's admissions deci
sions, a policy which creates lower
standards for black and Chicano stu
dents and higher standards for white
and Asian-American students. His
arguments confront the main problem
he sees with proportional affirmative
action policies: Does it really affirm
the students who benefit from it, or do
all students in the "underrepresented"
categories need to find other methods
of affirmation to justify their accep
tance?
Using an interesting and persuasive
technique to deal with the political
arguments of many student and fac
ulty activists, D'Souza cites a wealth of
scholarly material to show that convic
tions of many student and faculty
activists are based on faulty fact
assumptions. D'Souza often recounts
entire conversations he had with stu
dents, whose stories changed com
pletely when presented with a different
set of facts.
Regarding Stanford's CIV change,
D'Souza questions whether the
activists are mostly committed to
greater knowledge of ethnic and non-
Western cultures or to an ideological
perspective that acknowledges some
facts at the expense of others. He per

suasively argues that the choice of texts
added to Stanford's CIV reading list
"represents not the zenith of Third
World achievement but rather caters to
the ideological proclivities of Ameri
can activists."

Although each reader will individu
ally be able to find fault with specific
arguments, D'Souza's book as a whole
stands as a refreshing addition to liter
ature tracking the political formation
of America's future leaders.
