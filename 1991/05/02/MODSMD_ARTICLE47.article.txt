There is an internal landscape, a geography of the soul; we
search for its outlines all our lives. . . We may go through our
lives happy or unhappy, successful or unfulfilled, loved or
unloved, without ever... feeling the agony as the twisted iron
in our soul unlocks itself and we slip at last into place.
For the narrator of Josephine Hart's first novel, "Dam
age," that moment of devastating recognition does come —
on the dav that he meets Anna, the woman his son plans to

marry.
Novels about the shallowness of the "good life" — the
narrator is a successful doctor and politician with a beauti
ful wife, healthy children and all the necessary material
amenities — are nothing new. Neither are stories of families
and lives destroyed by a relentless, obsessive and forbidden
passion.
This book, however, is particularly gripping. Hart's terse
style keeps the reader balanced between real suspense and
an underlying sense of inevitable doom. Despite a slight
tendency towards cliches, her short, simple dialogues —
such as the following exchange between the narrator and his
"femme fatale" upon their first encounter — are devastat
ing; t
"Grey eyes stared back into mine, and held them

motionless. After a long time she said, 'How very strange.'
'Yes,' I said.
'I'm going now.'
'Goodbye,' 1 said. She turned, and walked away.
Who is this mysterious, "damaged" woman who
promises the narrator "everything, always" while planning
her wedding with his son? Who invites him to an apartment
she has bought from another lover specifically for that ren
dezvous — on the night before the marriage itself? Exactly
how will his obsession lead to the inevitable disasters, and
what form will they take?
F.ven more fascinating than the unfolding of the plot
itself is Hart's portrayal of the perfect, fatal intertwining of
love and lust that destroys all the falsehoods upon which the
narrator has built his "perfect" life Devastated anri nlnnp in

the end, he says, "At least I am certain of the truth now."
Occasionally, the narrative in "Damage" is just a little bit
too much.
Her attempts to make the novel "real," to scare us into
the realization that this could happen to any of us, some
times fall flat, and leave the novel sounding mundane and
very unrealistic.
Despite these distractions (And what first novel is per
fect?), Hart's "Damage" is, overall, a stunning success,
accomplishing exactly what it calculates to achieve, and one
would have to look hard to find better summer reading. The
novel has moments of true brilliance, and it is hard to imag
ine any readers walking away from the ending without
shuddering in horror and half-hoping it will all happen to
