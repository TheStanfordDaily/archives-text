# Bluegrass means foot-stompin fun in Santa Cruz
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
It's a touch of the blues, a little gospel, some cowboy, a
dose of country and a bit of jazz. It originated 50 years ago
in Kentucky, with a man named Bill Monroe. The B side of
Elvis* first single was this style. But what is it?
If you don't know, you're not alone, because only 1 per
cent of the population can identify what bluegrass music is.
But, if you want to become familiar with this unique blend
of sounds, which originated right here in the United States,
drive down to Santa Cruz on Saturday.
Why? Because this weekend, Santa Cruz will be even
more lively and colorful than usual. This weekend is the
fourth annual Bluegrass Festival, a free-for-all celebration
of Bluegrass Music Month, and a guaranteed good time for
all.
At the festival, you'll be introduced to a hybrid of blue
grass styles, not just straight Kentucky or California blue
grass. Vendors will sell food, beverages, baked goods, candy
and T-shirts. Raffles will be held at music stores for musical
instruments and the Strawberry Music Festival in Yosemite.
No liquor will be sold, but the local watering hole, the Cat
alyst Bar, is only half a block away.
And what kind of people will be there? Well, east of the
Mississippi River, bluegrass listeners are often a conserva
tive crowd between the ages of 45 and 65, who tend to drive
recreation vehicles and drink Budweiser.
But in the West, there's a resurgence of young fans who
don't fit that stereotype. And many of them will be in Santa
Cruz this Saturday, to square dance or boogie, to listen, and
to find out what it's all about.
And what is it about? Five instruments make up a blue
grass band: guitar, fiddle, stand-up acoustic bass, dobro (a
guitar with a resonator that looks like a hubcap) and man
dolin (something like a fiddle, played with a pick, usually
carried by a troubadour).
Four of these five-instrument bands will entertain at the
festival: Tenbrooks of Palo Alto; Side Saddle, an all-women
group with nationally distributed albums; and two Santa
Cruz bands, the Harmony Grits and the Hardly Herd.
Mike McKinley, who serves on the board of directors of
the Bluegrass Society and is a member of Harmony Grits,
says it doesn't matter. According to him, once someone
hears bluegrass music, he or she is bound to like it.
McKinley calls this year's festival "Bluegrass on the
Blacktop," since it's being held in the parking lot of the old
Ford's Department Store, which was destroyed in the Loma
Prieta Earthquake.
Bluegrass can be heard at festivals all over the country
(1000 festivals are held in the United States each year, 20 in
California alone), at footraces, spring fairs, county jails and
even funerals — where banjo music can be a sentimental
way to remember a friend. But listeners are not restricted to
Americans, for 23 countries make up the International
Bluegrass Music Association.
And if you're wondering what song Elvis recorded in the
bluegrass style, it's "Blue Moon of Kentucky." ("That's All
Right Mama" was on the flip side.)

The Santa Cruz Bluegrass Festival, will take place Saturday,
May 4, from noon until 6 p.m., in the old Ford's Department
Store parking lot at the corner of Cathcart and Pacific
avenues. Admission is free. For information on the Bluegrass
Society, write to P.O. Box 2904, Santa Cruz, CA 95063.
