# Laughter on the lawn

### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Your studying may be disrupted
this weekend by the sound of
"Laughter on the Green."
Chuckles and' guffaws will
emanate from Frost Amphitheater
on Sunday as four stand-up come
dians take the stage for an after
noon of mirth and merriment.
"Saturday Night Live's" Rich
Hall, Emo Philips, Cathy Ladman
and Warren Thomas are all slated
to take the mike at 2 p.m.
Rich Hall is probably best
known for his best-selling
"Sniglets" books, which provided
words for unnamed phenomena in
everyday life. (Personally, my
favorite sniglet was always chesidue,
the cheesy residue left on your fin
gers after eating cheese doodles.)
Hall has appeared on the
"Tonight Show," HBO's "Not Nec
essarily the News" and was a regular
cast member on "Saturday Night
Live." He won an Emmy writing for

David Letterman, but is, first and
foremost a stand-up comedian.
Emo Phillips, a Chicago native,
entered the stand-up comedian
business so people would stop
laughing at him. But, if he performs
at his usual level of hilarity, this
wish won't come true on Sunday.
Cathy Ladman has numerous
theater and comedy credits to her
name, and has appeared at New
York's hottest comedy clubs, such
as Caroline's and Catch a Rising
Star. And hey, if she's good enough
for New York, she's good enough
for Stanford.
Warren Thomas hails from the
Southern half of this state, but is a
favorite in Bay Area clubs. You
might remember the wit and raw
edge of his act from last year's
"Cavalcade of Comedy" at Frost.

Laughter on the Green will be held at
Frost Amphitheater on Sunday, May
5 at 2 p.m. Gates will open at I p.m.
Tickets are $16.50, $13.50 for stu
dents.
