# Professors brace for academic cuts
## Rosse to announce budget plans today 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
It's after working hours or
Monday evening and Tim Lenoir
chair of one of Stanford's aca
demic programs, is staying late tc
think about his future.
"I'm sitting here with my bud
get in my hand thinking aboui
how I'm going to cover course:
next year," said the chair of th<
Values, Technology, Science anc
Society program. "I'm realb
deeply concerned about it."
Lenoir is not alone. Leaders o
Stanford's academic department:
and programs said they have little
idea if, and how, harsh budgei
realities will affect programs anc
courses during the next two years
and beyond.
Provost Jim Rosse is expectec
to announce at today's Faculty
Senate meeting several budgetary
actions to be taken in the coming
year. Awaiting that, few chairs art
making specific contingency plans
for their own programs and
departments.
Before the Navy last week

announced its decision to cut the
indirect cost rate to 55.5 percent,
the University anticipated an
operating budget deficit in excess
of $5.5 million. That figure is now
expected to triple.
For the most part, the chairs
said they do not yet know how
their departments will be affected
by last Thursday's announce
ment.
"It's really up in the air what
the departments are going to have
to do,'" said Sol Feferman, chair of
the Mathematics Department. "1
don't think the deans themselves
know what is going to be
required."
But "the message we get from
the deans is to prepare yourself
for some serious cutbacks," he
added.
Feferman said that days spent
waiting to hear what and how
much gets cut have been long and
tiring.
"It's just a matter of psycholog
ical preparation more than any
thing else," he said.
Physics Department Chair
Steve Chu said, "I can tell you
what I'm doing. I'm doing noth
ing. I don't think it's wise to make
disaster plans until we know the
size of the disaster."
An effort to reduce the Univer
sity's operating budget hy $22
million resulted in across-the

board service and staff cuts ove
the past year, and some chairs ar
questioning the effects of furthe
cuts on the viability of program
and departments.
Robert Simoni, chair of the bir
logical sciences department, saic
"I'm not sure there is anythin
the department can do to weathe
the storm without major dan'
age."
But, he said, "We're all sort c
bracing for it."
