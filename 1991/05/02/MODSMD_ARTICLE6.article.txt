# COP runoff begins today
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Council of Presidents race
is entering the final stretch as stu
dents vote today and tomorrow in
the long-awaited and much
debated runoff election.
As the top two COP slates from
the general election — "Students
First" and "Stand and Deliver" —
prepared to square off for the last
time, they charged each other
with negative campaign strate
gies.
In the general election, "Stu
dents First" garnered about 43
percent of the vote while "Stand
and Deliver" received approxi
mately 29 percent. The runoff is
being held because neither slate
received a majority.
As the campaign wound up,
Students First charged that the
runoff election handbook state
ment bv Stand and Deliver inaccu
rately compared the positions and
actions of the two COP slates.
The statement "appears to be
negative campaigning," said Stu
dents First COP slate member
Beth Morgan. "It is not an accu
rate representation."
"If they want to take responsi
bility for all of the positive things
done by People's Platform, they
should also take responsibility for
all of the things People's Platform
hasn't done and all of the negative
things they have done," she
added.
But Stand and Deliver stood
behind its statement.
"Everything that is in there is
truthful," said slate member Mike
Curry. "If they want more infor
mation on Students First, they
can turn to the next page."
"We are just following the John
Louie-style of campaigning,"
Curry added. Louie, a member of
the Students First slate, began
the first debate of the campaign
by listing various negative acts of
the People's Platform.
Meanwhile, Stand and Deliver
slate members accused Students
First of avoiding any debates
before the runoff.
Slate member Jennifer Pearson
said Students First backed out of
a scheduled debate on KZSU and
refused to film statements to be
aired on XTV last night.
"It is a good campaign strategy
for them, but it is awful in terms
of campus politics," Pearson said.
"They want to play a silent cam
paign."
"Students First would like to
have as little publicity and as few
debates as possible," Curry said.

But Morgan said Students
First was never officially con
tacted by XTV or KZSU about
possible debates. She said the
slate never even heard about the
possibility until Tuesday after
noon and did not have time to ade
quately prepare.
Two special-fee requests — one
new and one old — and one new
referendum also appear on the
runoff ballot.
The ASSU Senate unani
mously approved putting Project
Motivation on the ballot because
it was inadvertently left off the
general election ballot.
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, was placed on the
runoff ballot for a second chance
at student approval of its $30,000
fee request after it narrowly lost
in the general election. Senate
supporters of MEChA cited "elec
tion irregularities," including an
incomplete statement in the elec
tion handbook, as a reason for
being included on the runoff bal
lot.
The new referendum on the
ballot calls for the senate to create
an ASSU financial aid office to
work with the United States Stu
dent Association on issues related
to state and federal financial aid.
The financial aid office replaces
the ASSU lobby office, which was
overwhelmingly rejected by the
students in the general election.
To win their fee requests, both

It is a good campaign
strategy for them, but
it is awful in terms of
campus politics.'

Project Motivation and MEChA
need approval from 15 percent of
the student body in addition to
receiving a majority of votes cast.
Two years ago, the Stanford
Axe Committee received about 56
percent of the vote in the runoff
election but failed to obtain
approval from 15 percent of the
students because of light voter
turnout.
Elections commissioner Enda
Hu said he expects turnout to be
from 4,000 to 5,000. About 5,600
students voted in the general elec
tion this year.
Unlike the general election, the
runoff will be conducted on paper
ballots instead of computers, alle
viating the problem of long lines,
Hu said.
In one other significant action,
the ballots from Stanford in
Washington arrived late Monday
afternoon, almost one day after
the Sunday 7 p.m. deadline. Hear
ings officer Jason Moore ruled
that the ballots could not be
counted and said he plans to
destroy them after tonight's sen
ate meeting.
