# Stanford faces $50M shortfall over two years
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University is facing a "daunting
financial challenge" due to the Navy's
decision last week to slash Stanford's
indirect-cost rate, Provost James Rosse
said in a sobering address to the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
Projected budget shortfalls of $20
million this year and $30 million next
year will force the University to take
several painful steps, including a near
freeze in faculty hiring, a six-month
postponement of annual faculty and
staff salary increases and sharp limits
on library purchases.
"We just need to generate as much
cash as we can, frankly," Rosse said in
an interview before his address to the
senate.
A new round of cuts should make up
half of the shortfall in this year's operat
ing budget, Rosse said. But he said he

still expects a deficit of at least $10 mil
lion at the close of Stanford's fiscal year,
Aug. 31.
Several additional cutbacks, includ
ing moderate reductions in school and
administrative budgets, should erase at
least $15 million of the projected $30
million shortfall in next year's budget,
Rosse predicted.
He said no layoffs are expected to
result from the actions announced yes
terday and indicated that the adminis
tration would do everything possible to
avoid layoffs next year.
Rosse also reaffirmed previous
pledges by the administration to hold
tuition increases to one percentage
point above the inflation rate.
"There's nothing here that signals a
change in that policy," Rosse said. "As
far as I'm concerned, it's a firm long-run
commitment."
Deficits from this year and next year
will be covered by University reserves,

Rosse said. The University has $12 mil
lion in discretionary reserves and
roughly another $100 million that can
be used upon approval by the Board of
Trustees.
Rosse said he and the trustees are
committed to using reserves to cushion
the short-term financial blow but will be
very cautious in doing so.
"We will have to draw on University
reserves and draw on them heavily,"
Rosse said. But "we simply cannot pour
red ink down the drain."
The current budget crunch is primar
ily the result of last week's decision by
the Navy to cut the amount of overhead
Stanford can charge the government on
federally sponsored research grants.
Until last week, Stanford had a provi
sional indirect-cost rate of 70 percent.
After weeks of negotiations between the
University and the Naw failed to pro-
duce an agreement, the Navy
imposed a rate of 55.5 percent.
Each one-point drop in the rate
translates into a $ 1.25 million loss
for the University as a whole.
About $800,000 of that
amount impacts the University's
operating budget. The remainder
affects the Medical School, which
has a budget separate from the
rest of the University and keeps a
large portion of the indirect-cost
recovery generated by research
there.
Stanford and the Navy will
review the University's indirect
cost rate again before the books
on this year are closed, but such a
review won't take place for at
least another year. By that point,
Stanford officials hope to have
developed new cost studies that
will justify higher rates of recov
ery.
But the timing of the process
ensures that the short-term eco
nomic pain will be extremely
severe.
The pain may be most intense
in the Medical School, where indi
rect-cost recovery accounts for
roughly half of its $60 million
operating budget. Due to the
lower rate, the school is expecting
shortfalls of $12 million this year
and $14 million next year.
"This is a very, very serious
matter," said David Korn, dean of
the Medical School, in an inter
view last night. "We're struggling
to find a pathway through it. We
haven't found it yet."
The Medical School had
already reduced its operating bud
get by $1.25 million this year. The
$12 million deficit will be covered
by reserves, Korn said.
Meanwhile, Rosse indicated
that several measures would be
necessary in the remaining four

months of this fiscal year to keep
the University's operating deficit
no larger than $10 million. The
measures include:
• Limiting hiring to "only those
positions critical to the long-term
health of the University" and
delaying replacements for vacant
positions,
• Putting numerous facilities
projects on hold until it is clear
there will be funds to cover their
completion (earthquake-related
construction will continue as
scheduled, however),
• Curtailing the number of
acquisitions made by University
libraries, and
• Diverting savings of individ
ual schools and departments to
cover operating budget shortfalls.
Plans for next year's budget
have not yet been completed,
Rosse said yesterday. But several
preliminary decisions have been
made, he said. These include:
• Holding budget items such as
supplies and travel at their cur
rent level, i.e. not increasing these
expenditures by the rate of infla
tion,
• Delaying implementation of
faculty and staff salary increases
until March 1 — a move expected
to save roughly $5 million,
• Requiring all schools and
administrative units to reduce
their budgets by at least 2 per
cent, and
• Eliminating funds in the
operating budget that have previ
ously been earmarked for curricu
lar and administrative innova
tions and improvements.
Rosse said the decision to delay
faculty and staff raises was "prob
ably the most difficult decision"
budget-planners made.
"It's not a solution that will
please everybody, I'm sure," he
said. "If we're going to keep peo
ple at this institution, we need to
keep salary levels in touch with
realitv."

But, he added, "it's clear that
this is not a normal year."
Only last fall, Rosse predicted
that the University's $22 million
"repositioning" effort would lead
to a balanced budget this year and
produce surpluses in years to
come.
But that rosy scenario was
soon discarded due to falling
interest rates, overly optimistic
projections of research volume
and several drops in Stanford's
indirect-cost rate resulting from
the federal probes of the Univer
sity's cost-recovery practices.
In November, Rosse said the
University was facing an $8 mil
lion shortfall and announced sev
eral cutbacks.
In February, following more
problems caused by the indirect
cost controversy, Rosse informed
the faculty that a deficit of $3.5 to
$5.5 million was likely this year.
Last month, he said the deficit
would probably exceed $5.5 mil
lion.
At the same time, he warned
the Faculty Senate that the 1992-
93 budget would be "substantially
reduced" compared to the current
year's due to several factors,
including effects of a recessionary
economy and uncertainty about
the government's commitment to
fund research at universities.
Rosse underscored that senti
ment at yesterday's meeting.
"The implications are clear," he
said. "Stanford University will
have a diminished capacity in the
future to continue all the activi
ties it has currently undertaken.
But while some opportunities will
be lost, we can and must protect
the essential quality of the insti
tution."
A special Faculty Senate meet
ing has been scheduled for next
Thursday to discuss long-term
budget issues.
