# Stanford faces $50M shortfall over two years
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The University is facing a "daunting
financial challenge" due to the Navy's
decision last week to slash Stanford's
indirect-cost rate, Provost James Rosse
said in a sobering address to the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
Projected budget shortfalls of $20
million this year and $30 million next
year will force the University to take
several painful steps, including a near
freeze in faculty hiring, a six-month
postponement of annual faculty and
staff salary increases and sharp limits
on library purchases.
"We just need to generate as much
cash as we can, frankly," Rosse said in
an interview before his address to the
senate.
A new round of cuts should make up
half of the shortfall in this year's operat
ing budget, Rosse said. But he said he

still expects a deficit of at least $10 mil
lion at the close of Stanford's fiscal year,
Aug. 31.
Several additional cutbacks, includ
ing moderate reductions in school and
administrative budgets, should erase at
least $15 million of the projected $30
million shortfall in next year's budget,
Rosse predicted.
He said no layoffs are expected to
result from the actions announced yes
terday and indicated that the adminis
tration would do everything possible to
avoid layoffs next year.
Rosse also reaffirmed previous
pledges by the administration to hold
tuition increases to one percentage
point above the inflation rate.
"There's nothing here that signals a
change in that policy," Rosse said. "As
far as I'm concerned, it's a firm long-run
commitment."
Deficits from this year and next year
will be covered by University reserves,

Rosse said. The University has $12 mil
lion in discretionary reserves and
roughly another $100 million that can
be used upon approval by the Board of
Trustees.
Rosse said he and the trustees are
committed to using reserves to cushion
the short-term financial blow but will be
very cautious in doing so.
"We will have to draw on University
reserves and draw on them heavily,"
Rosse said. But "we simply cannot pour
red ink down the drain."
The current budget crunch is primar
ily the result of last week's decision by
the Navy to cut the amount of overhead
Stanford can charge the government on
federally sponsored research grants.
Until last week, Stanford had a provi
sional indirect-cost rate of 70 percent.
After weeks of negotiations between the
University and the Naw failed to pro-
