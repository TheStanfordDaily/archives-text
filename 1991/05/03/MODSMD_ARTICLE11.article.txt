# Balancing between teaching, research
## Panelists discuss improving undergraduate education 
### Julie Cantor Staff writer 
Is undergraduate teaching impor
tant at a research university? Are
prestigious schools forcing their pro
fessors to follow the axiom, "Publish
or perish?"
At Stanford, the answers are yes
and no, according to speakers at the
opening event of Teaching Week, a
series of programs and discussions on
education issues.
Teaching week is a Centennial
event designed to "highlight and cele
brate teaching during Stanford's" cen
tennial year, said Michele Marin
covich, director of the Center for
Teaching and Learning, which has
organized the event.
Last night's program took place at
a special meeting of the Academic
Council. As University President Don
ald Kennedy moderated, a panel of
two deans and three professors dis
cussed the issue of "Teaching at a
Research University" in Kresge Audi
torium. Although opinions varied, all
participants stressed the need to find
and maintain a delicate balance
between teaching and research.
Kennedy began the session noting,
"Scholarship of the first rate is of
unparalleled importance." The mis
sion, he said, is to "more broadly
define scholarship" and to allow the
faculty to use many forms of teaching.
Taking a close look at Stanford's
undergraduate experience and placing
an emphasis on teaching shows that
the University is "improving a

strength, not correcting a weakness."
Panelist A. Michael Spence, dean of
the Graduate School of Business, also
praised teaching at Stanford. "In the
classroom," he noted, "the average
[undergraduate teaching] perfor
mance at Stanford ... is really quite
high."
However, he said he hopes to see
new, innovative teaching techniques,
such as videotaped lectures, incorpo
rated into the learning process, which
would allow professors to spend more
one-on-one time with their students.
Linguistics Prof, and Resident Fel
low John Rickford praised dorm-cen
tered educational programs. Inviting
faculty members to spend extra time
with undergraduates at dinner is
another way to increase professor-stu
dent contact, he said.
Rickford helped highlight the
dichotomy between teaching and
research by quoting results from a
survey of 10,000 faculty members at
306 colleges and universities. At lib
eral arts colleges, he said, 76 percent
of those surveyed said teaching is a
professor's primary goal, as opposed
to 21 percent of the faculty at research
universities.
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee, asso
ciate dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, said she would like to see more
undergraduates individually contact
ing their professors, although she is
pleased with the rise in individual
undergraduate research.
New statistics show that in recent
years grants from Undergraduate
Research Opportunities have risen

and that more Stanford students are
graduating with honors. But the num
ber of students of color involved with
individual graduate research has
declined.
Panels and lectures throughout the
week will feature many individuals at
Stanford who are associated with the
undergraduate teaching experience.
Panels will not only include profes
sors, but also deans, lecturers and
teaching assistants.
In addition to these moderated dis
cussions, a Teaching Week Film Festi
val will be held in Cubberley Audito
rium every night at 7 p.m.
All members of the Stanford com
munity, especially students, are
invited to attend the events and films
during the week, free of charge.
The activities include panels on
"Strategies for Improving Undergrad
uate Teaching" and "Technology in
the Learning Environment," a School
of Education event in White Plaza
focusing on opportunities in education
and a Haas Public Service Center
event titled, "Teaching, Research, and
Community Service."
