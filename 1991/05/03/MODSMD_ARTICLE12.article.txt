Chief Dave Yakima of the Oglalaa Lakota
Indian tribe chanted a Native American
prayer to a drum beat as an introduction to
a presentation by Ancient Forest Chau
tauqua in White Plaza yesterday afternoon.
Ancient Forest Chautauqua, a traveling
coalition of entertainers and speakers,
seeks to educate the public about Native
American and environmental issues.
The group was formed in Seattle a year
ago and is currently on a tour from Vancou
ver to San Diego. At first glance, it bears a
strong resemblance to Ken Kesey and the
Merry Pranksters. The 30 to 40 people
travel in a caravan, led by a bus painted
with colorful forest scenes. In one illustra
tion, just above the right front wheel, a deer
lies curled up under a tree.
Ancient Forest Chautauqua is based on
of the Chatauqua movement, which spon
sored festive and educational events open to
the public, including lectures, music, dance
and drama. The movement began in the
late 1800 sin upstate New York, and by the
peak of its popularity, in 1924, more than
30 million people in 12,000 cities had par
ticipated.
President Teddy Roosevelt called the
Chautauquas "the most American thing in
America."
Ancient Forest Chautauqua's presenta
tion included several speakers and perform
ers.
Chuck Peterson of the environmental
organization Bay Area Action, which is
hosting the tour, said Ancient Forest Chau
tauqua encourages biodiversity, which is
the "immune system of the forest." He

likened diversity in the forest to human
diversity.
A younger member of Yakima's tribe,
Barney Oyate, emphasized the connected
ness of Native Americans to the land, and
said his people should not be forced into an
industrialized society.
"Our ancestors knew how to take care of
this land," he-said. "We can take care of it
and rebuild it."
He added that self-sufficiency is the
most important thing for his people.
"Assimilation in society has pretty much
destroyed the people. . . . Society teaches
such individual values â€” take care of your
self and not of others."
The group is working with Bay Area
Action to secure the passage of the Native
Forest Protection Act. The legislation
would preserve native forests from clear
cutting and provide funds for loggers who
would consequently be displaced.
Currently, only 5 percent of the ancient
forests in the United States still survive.
Peterson said that at the present rate of
clear-cutting, all the forests will be
destroyed within a decade.
Andrew Rodman, a coordinator for the
group, said Ancient Forest Chautauqua is
unique as it marks one of the first times
Native Americans and environmentalists
have joined together. The group "seeks to
educate, inspire and celebrate [as well as]
empower people," Rodman continued.
"We try to inform people, get them a lit
tle riled up and then direct them," he said.
Performing for the group was Billy
Sparks, a guitarist, singer and songwriter
from New York City who along with his
band, the Bird Tribe, frequently works to
support environmental causes.
