AIDS will afflict up to 40 million
people by year 2000, WHO says
GENEVA (AP) - The World Health Organi
zation predicted yesterday that the AIDS virus
will infect up to 30 million adults and 10 mil
lion children by the end of the century.
The total is about 10 million higher than the
U.N. health agency's estimate a year ago.
The agency said it revised its forecast
because of the increasing spread of the human
immunodeficiency virus, known as Hiy in sub-
Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. It said the
infection rate appeared to be slowing in indus
trialized countries.
Israel attacks Palestinian camp
TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Two Israeli heli
copter gunships fired four rockets into a Pales
tinian refugee camp on the outskirts of the
southern port city of Tyre yesterday, police said.
In Jerusalem, the army said warplanes
attacked a PLO guerrilla target near the
Rashidiyeh camp. It gave no details, and there
was no word from any of the sources on casual
ties or damage in the attacks.
Israeli army statements do not specify the
type of aircraft, referring to all as "warplanes."
police said two Cobra attack heli
copters were involved.
The Rashidiyeh camp is controlled by guer
rillas loyal to PLO chief Yasser Arafat. It is
home to about 20,000 Palestinian refugees.
Capitalism not vindicated by
fall of Marxism, pope says
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Laying out his model
for a post-Communist world, Pope John Paul II
yesterday acknowledged capitalism's successes
but denounced the "consumer society" as akin
to Marxism for ignoring moral values.
In an encyclical, the church's first major
pronouncement of social doctrine since the
downfall of communism in Eastern Europe, the
pope told the West its way of life was not vindi
cated by the collapse of Marxist governments.
"Can it perhaps be said that, after the fail
ure of communism, capitalism is the victorious
social system, and that capitalism should be the
goal of the countries now making efforts to
rebuild their economy and society?" the Polish
born pontiff asked.
"The answer is obviously complex," the pope
wrote in the 114-page document. In it, he called
for a capitalism that has an ethical and reli
gious core.
