# U.S. didn't support coup against Saddam

WASHINGTON (AP) - Defections
by senior officials in Saddam Hussein's
army — and possibly a coup attempt
against Saddam — were shelved in
March because the United States
failed to support the effort, according
to a Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee staff report issued yesterday.
In early March, at the height of the
rebellion in Iraq, the army officials
approached a dissident group in exile
with an offer of cooperation, said the
report, written by Peter Galbraith, a
senior aide to committee Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
The would-be Iraqi defectors "con

templated bringing possibly decisive
force to the side of the rebels" but first
wanted "a sign that the sponsors of the
rebellion had the support of the United
States," the report stated, attributing
the information to unnamed Kurdish
and Arab opposition leaders.
The State Department had declined
to respond for the past two weeks to
inquiries about the matter, and an offi
cial said yesterday the department
would probably save its answer for
congressional hearings that are
expected later on the administration's
Iraq policy.
The Iraqi military officials were

dealing with the Joint Action Commit
tee, an alliance of Kurdish, Sunni,
Shi'a and other Iraqi dissidents
formed in Beirut, the report said.
It said the group put aside its reli
gious and ethnic differences to concen
trate on a sole goal: the removal of
Saddam Hussein from power, and the
establishment of a more democratic
Iraq.
Relying on a no-contact policy
established in 1988, the State Depart
ment refused to meet with the opposi
tion groups on several occasions,
according to the report.
"The public snub of Kurdish and

other Iraqi opposition leaders was read
as a clear indication the United States
did not want the popular rebellion to
succeed," the document stated.
The refusal to meet with the Iraqi
opposition was accompanied by "back
ground statements from administra
tion officials that they were looking for
a military, not a popular, alternative to
Saddam Hussein," the committee staff
report said.
The United States resisted not only
the entreaties of opposition figures,
but of Syria and Saudi Arabia, which
favored aiding the Iraqi dissidents mil
itarily, the report contended.
