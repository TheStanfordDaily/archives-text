# Lebanese militias give up weapons to government

### 
BEIRUT, Ijebanon (AP) — Government
troops have regained control of Ijebanon's
ports and main economic facilities, and the
militias that dominated the country for 16
years have surrendered most of their
weapons, an official said yesterday.
Defense Minister Michel Murr said the
government's control of the Mediterranean
ports will help shore up Ijebanon's ailing
economy and boost trade revenue.
In a statement released by his office,
Murr also said the principal Christian and
Muslim militias had surrendered 80 per
cent of their weapons to army troops dis
mantling their cantons north of the capital.
He said the groups would continue to
turn over weapons as government troops
penetrate deeper into the mountain regions
outside Beirut.
About 5,000 troops fanned out Wednes
day to areas outside Beirut as part of the
second phase of a security plan that is
expected to be completed by June 30.
The two steps will restore government
authority to one-fourth of terri
tory — about 1,000 square miles. This
includes a 70-mile coastal strip dotted with
ports that had been controlled by militia
men, depriving the treasury of $100 million
in annual tax revenue.
The lost revenue contributed to the col
lapse of the economy and devaluation of the
Lebanese pound. Before the civil war 16
years ago, the Lebanese currency traded at
three to the U.S. dollar. Now, the dollar sells

for 930 I-iebanese pounds.
The final phase of the security plan,
which is scheduled to begin on July 1, calls
for all non-Lebanese militias to disarm by
Sept. 30.
The last phase is expected to be the most
difficult. It will put the army in direct con
frontation with Palestine Liberation Orga
nization guerrillas, Israel, its proxy
Christian militia force in the
south, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and
pro-Iranian militants.
Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, has 40,000 troops in Lebanon to
help enforce a civil war peace pact that was
mediated by the Arab league in October
1989.
Syria has told its regional ally, Iran, it
will postpone disarming the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, until Israel
leaves the security zone it occupies in south
Lebanon. Hezbollah is an umbrella group
believed to be holding most of the 13 West
ern hostages in Lebanon.
A 3,000-strong contingent of Iranian
Revolutionary Guards will be permitted to
continue operating in the Syrian-policed
Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, where
they were deployed in 1982 to confront
Israel's invading army.
Israel carved out the security zone in
1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its
troops from the rest of the country. The
440-square-mile strip serves as a buffer
against guerrilla infiltrations into Israel,
