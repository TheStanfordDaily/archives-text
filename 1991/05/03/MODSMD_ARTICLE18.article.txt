dents slate best aware of and
most able to address Stan
ford students' concerns in the com
ing year is "Students First."
John Louie, Beth Morgan, John
Overdeck and Benny Sandoval
have set the tone throughout this
year's campaign by articulating
and addressing the issues that
have become central to this cam
paign.
"Students First" has made
accountability to students the issue
of the year, and they are vigorous in
their promise to be responsive to
the opinion of students throughout
the year.
The slate has also raised the

long-neglected issue of graduate
students' concerns at Stanford.
"Students First" has pledged

concerns and ability to unite the
student body around student
issues make them the most effec

coming year.
Louie, Morgan, Overdeck and
Sandoval are an assertive, well-spo
ken and thoughtful group of indi
viduals who will make excellent
leaders in the coming year.
