Insightful and effective, Project
Motivation exposes high school
students from low-income families
to college life in the hope of encour
aging them to continue their edu
cation.
Project Motivation is not on the
runoff ballot because of partisan
politics in the ASSU Senate, but
because it was inadvertently left off
the spring ballot.
MEChA and the ASSU Financial
Aid Office, however, are another
storv.

Students soundly voted down
the ASSU Lobby Office's fee
request in the spring election. The
senate then decided to rename it,
make some token changes in its
bylaws and give it another chance.
Students also rejected MEChA's
special fee request. A sympathetic
senate decided that MEChA, too,
should get another try
The whole debacle has raised the
question: How democratic is the
ASSU if the senate can rerun the
election to give its favorite projects
another opportunity?
It is insulting that the senate
does not consider voters competent
enough to make these decisions the
first time around.
