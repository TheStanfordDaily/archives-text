# Faculty confront more painful cuts
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's budget announcement
met with a grim — but unsurprised —
response from Stanford faculty.
Deans and department chairs winced
at the prospect of trimming already lean
budgets, while professors expressed con
cern over looming salary holdbacks and
reductions in library funding.
"It's pretty much what everyone
expected," said Robert Simoni, chair of
the Department of Biological Sciences.
But the cuts will still be tough for his
department: "We haven't even recovered
from the last round of cuts."

How much will be slashed from which
departments is now unknown, and some
faculty members said the processes
administrators will use to determine the
cuts are also unclear. But one thing is for
sure: Serious decisions will have to be
made, quickly.
"This year's actions are necessarily
constrained by the fact that the year is
three-quarters over," said Marshall
Smith, dean of the School of Education.
"There are only a few things you can do
to bring the budget back on-line."
And not everyone is satisfied with the
proposals outlined yesterday by Provost
James Rosse to reduce projected
shortfalls of $20 million this year
and $30 million the next.
"I'm doubtful about the wis
dom of across-the-board salary
holdbacks," said English Prof.
Bliss Carnochan, a member of the
Faculty Senate. "The people who
ran best afford it are well-paid
faculty and administrators. Those
who can least afford it are junior
faculty and a large number of
staff."
The University will delay fac
ulty and staff salary increases for
six months during the next aca
demic year, Rosse said yesterday.
In addition, library acquisitions
will be slowed for the remainder
of this year.
"Everybody has to make a sac
rifice, but I'm upset about the
library," said History Prof. Peter
Stansky. "They may have to
spend a fortune later catching up.
It may do terrible harm to the
library."
While Rosse's statement yes
terday noted that there will be
"expense reductions in all units,"

several faculty members said the
cuts will not iikely be distributed
evenly.
"The cuts are likely to be selec
tive more than they are general,
though they may be general in the
beginning," said Chemistry Prof.
James Collman. "Several faculty
believe those parts of the Univer
sity that are very strong and very
well established will be pre
served."
"The cuts are not going to be
across-the-board," said Carolyn
Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences. "We've
taken them across-the-board a
number of times in the last few
years, and we don't believe we can
do that anymore."
She added, "We're trying to
take a comprehensive look at the
whole [Humanities and Sciences]
budget to find a type of expense
that can be eliminated, or a unit,
a department, whatever. . . . The
small programs and the newer
programs are in no more jeopardy
than the older programs."
Ewart Thomas, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said several committees are
already working to determine
where the cuts will be made in his

school. All departments will be
asked to outline what cuts they
can reasonably take. t
"We can't exempt anybody,"
said Thomas. "We have to say
everything is on the table."
Given that approach, many
faculty members are anxious to
be included in the process that
will determine what cuts will be
made. Some aren't satisfied with
the degree of input they've had so
far.
"Lots of people worry if not
about the concentration of power
then about the concentration of
decision-making in a fairly small
area," said Carnochan. "Whether
that's fair or not is something
that should be talked about.
And even after the short-term
budget shortfalls are addressed, a
larger problem remains, some fac
ulty members noted.
"The real question is, how is
the University going to come back
into equilibrium?" said Smith.
"No one has a real handle on how
we're going to reach that point.
There are lots of terrible rumors
going around. My hope is that
this is done in a rational and
thoughtful way."
