# Faculty confront more painful cuts
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's budget announcement
met with a grim — but unsurprised —
response from Stanford faculty.
Deans and department chairs winced
at the prospect of trimming already lean
budgets, while professors expressed con
cern over looming salary holdbacks and
reductions in library funding.
"It's pretty much what everyone
expected," said Robert Simoni, chair of
the Department of Biological Sciences.
But the cuts will still be tough for his
department: "We haven't even recovered
from the last round of cuts."

How much will be slashed from which
departments is now unknown, and some
faculty members said the processes
administrators will use to determine the
cuts are also unclear. But one thing is for
sure: Serious decisions will have to be
made, quickly.
"This year's actions are necessarily
constrained by the fact that the year is
three-quarters over," said Marshall
Smith, dean of the School of Education.
"There are only a few things you can do
to bring the budget back on-line."
And not everyone is satisfied with the
proposals outlined yesterday by Provost
