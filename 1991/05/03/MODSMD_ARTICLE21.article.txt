# Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz
## Do you have what it takes? 
### 
SO YOU WANT TO BE A columnist,
huh? You've heard about all the
perks — extra attention in White
Plaza, Stanford Daily happy hours, post
cards from Kennell Jackson and a chance
to meet Joel Stein.
We bet you think it is difficult to pour
your soul out on paper in under 4,200
characters. You probably think you must
compete with the funniest, most intelli
gent individuals on campus. It isn't and
you won't. Hell! We made it!
Just follow our simple plan in which
we show you all the the shortcuts and
techniques you need to be a success.
• Method 1: The "Ethno-Cultural,
Gender, Sexual Orientation" Approach
Just ask yourself: "Am I a member of
an oppressed ethnic, culture, gender or
sexual orientation group? If so, am I salty
enough to talk about it every week?" If
you answered no to the first part of this
question, there's still hope for you in
Method 2.
• Method 2: The "Just Because I'm a
Conservative White Male Doesn 't Neces
sarily Mean I'm a Fascist" Approach
Just ask yourself: "Am I graduating
soon?" If not, don't try it. (You know the
way labels work around here.)
• Method 3: The "Techie/Gradllnter
national Student (choose any one or a
combination) Who is Utterly Confused by
Stanford/U.S. Politics, Stanford Culture,
American Pop Culture, The Opposite
Sex " Approach
Just ask yourself: "Can I write well
enough in English?"
• Method 4: The"I Want to Put My
Arms Around the World and Make it

Whole Again " Approach
What you need to ask yourself here is:
"Was my childhood a wonderful safe
haven for all of my naive fantasies, and
has growing up opened my eyes to the
evils of the world?"
• Method 5: The "Validation Through
Column-Writing" Approach
What you need to ask yourself here is:
"Am I insecure enough that I need to try
to entertain the entire campus and get
everybody to think I'm cool?"
Of course, you are thinking, "Yes, I am
a walking stereotype, but I still have no
idea how to write a column. What do I do
now?"
You are in luck. Helga Schmelga at the
Helsinki Institute just completed a study
of all Daily columns in which she fed all of
the text into a huge super-computer.
After a Long belch, the computer produced
the following evaluation. Every Daily col
umn is the inane conglomeration of ran
dom occurrences in a columnist's life that
have occurred since the last column.
The following is a carefully con
structed example.
Random Occurrences:
1. We watched an endless stream of
ants marching purposefully from one hole
to another. We spat in their paths and
watched them scramble as they lost their
chemical trail.
2. We celebrated our friend's 20th
birthday.
3. We searched desperately for a sum
mer job.
4. We discussed graduate schools and
the recession.
Column:

As we celebrated our friend's 20th
birthday, we were struck by the similarity
between college students and ants. Ants
drone on, mindlessly following the chem
ical trail laid down by those in front of
them to the hole off in the distance.
To some higher being, we must appear
as they do — following the trail of our
predecessors through top universities,
impressive internships and elite graduate
schools on our way to a highly rewarding
career.
The recession has dropped a gob of
saliva in our path, obscuring our chemical
trail. With the dwindling job market, sim
ply following the path of our predecessors
will not guarantee success.
We need not despair, however. Just as
the saliva will evaporate, thus allowing
the ants to reestablish their trail, so, too,
will the recession dissipate, thus allowing
us, the future bourgeois, an opportunity
to reach our respective holes in the capi
talist infrastructure.
Get the picture? Good luck.
This has been a paid advertisement.
The views expressed herein are not neces
sarily the views of the actual columnists
or the editors who actually pick the
columnists (in other words, it was just a
joke). Any similarities between the above
material and any Daily columnist, living
or dead, is purely coincidental. So there!

we got some great Ed on Wednesday!"
