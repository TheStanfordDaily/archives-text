## Democracy, not MEChA's merits, at stake: Vote no 
### 
PLEASE VOTE IN THE RUNOFE
election, and please vote against
MEChA's special fee request.
The April 29 letter written by Maria
Peters and Ana Mata, two MEChA offi
cers, repeats the standard arguments in
favor of ignoring the voters' decision to
deny MEChA its special fee request.
The list of reasons for doing so still
includes the incompleteness of MEChA's
statement in the election handbook, the
lack of a recommendation from The
Daily and the general disappointment of
the MEChA members, who had really
wanted the money.
In addition, Peters and Mata now cite
"a growing resentment and backlash to
the goals and ideals of multiculturalism"
as further rationalization that the vote
was invalid.
We can all agree that the usefulness of
the election handbook in guiding opin
ions on fee requests was approximately
zero. But even if the handbook had not

been impossibly disorganized and laden
with errors, most voters still would have
relied on their personal experience with
a group's programs and events more
than a single statement written by some
one who wanted the fee request to pass.
The lack of a positive recommenda
tion from The Daily is also irrelevant. If
the MEChA second-chancers were to
look around, they might notice that sev
eral groups did not receive positive rec
ommendations from The Daily and that
several groups were denied their special
fee requests, but that no correlation
exists between these two groups.
Peters and Mata's latest argument
leaves me bewildered. Are they saying
opposition to a group's beliefs, actions or
goals is an "irregular" reason for voting
against a fee request? Or that those who
voted against MEChA's fee request did
so only because they lack a certain level
of enlightenment — a level to which
Peters and Mata are willing to help lift

them by offering them a second chance
to vote correctly?
The way elections usually work is that
the politicians and lobbyists make their
statements and requests to the voters,
and the voters decide with whom to
agree. Peters and Mata claim the demo
cratic denial of their fee request is a sign
that community opinion is against them.
I'd be inclined to say that's sort of the
point of the democratic process.
It seems MEChA has turned to the
ASSU Senate for help, secure in the
knowledge that the senate will truly rep
resent student opinions even when the
students don't yet know they hold those
opinions. Apparently, Peters and Mata
equate "accountability" with "funding
for (their) programs," and they have
taken advantage of a severely biased sen
ate to make their plea for another chance
at accountability.
I can only agree with them when they

label the senate's disposal of the elec
tions results and their entrance into the
second-chance sweepstakes "creative
solutions to (their) funding problem."
In an ideal student government,
MEChA's fee request would never have
been placed on the runoff election ballot.
I urge everyone to show up to vote
against MEChA's newest special fee
request — even if you happen to support
MEChA. If we, the Stanford student
body, keep sending signs to the ASSU
that it is they who must represent us
and not the other way around, I think
they'll get the message someday.
And while I don't claim to endorse
either COP slate in the runoff election,
students may want to take into account
which political party on campus cur
rently controls the senate which has
made recent elections so laughable.
