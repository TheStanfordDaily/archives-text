# Don't be misled; nothing liberal about Reges' cause
## 
### 
I WAS ASTOUNDED BY JAY Kadis'
letter on April 25 which attempted to
portray Stuart Reges as a crusader
against a "conservative political agenda."
I can hardly imagine anything more anti
liberal than the position taken by Reges.
Liberalism as I understand it is the
advocacy of sacrifices by the better off to
help the worse off in society and the
involvement of government to facilitate
this.
As Kadis himself observes, "mari
juana, cocaine and heroin are predomi
nantly used by lower socioeconomic
groups." They are therefore the main
beneficiaries of a national drug policy.
Reges ignores the fact that drugs have
wreaked destruction in the lives of the
less well-off. It has sapped the strength

and resources of the poor, preventing
them from improving their economic lot.
It is no accident that when Marx wanted
to denigrate religion, he referred to it as
'the opium of the masses.'
Moreover, drug-related crime has
endangered the lives of people in inner
city neighborhoods. The poor are being
exploited by a drug trade whose main
beneficiaries are wealthy drug barons.
Reges is only concerned with how the
national policy affects him. He is not
willing to put up with the slightest
infringement into his "personal liberty."
He claims his actions are victimless.
That is something that only a well-off
lecturer on a comfortable college campus
can say. His college pay can certainly
keep up his habit. What about those

whose drug addiction means diverting
resources from food and education?
The law cannot make the distinction
between Reges' actions and behavior in
other cases that are criminal. In some
schools, a person who is carrying illegal
drugs in his backpack is doing so to push
the drugs to some victim who can ill
afford to pay for them and who is not so
well-informed as to the dangers of using
drugs.
No doubt, the record shows that
Reges is a good teacher. But does that
exempt him from obeying the law? It is
extremely selfish for students to want
Reges' actions to go unpunished so that
their education is not affected. The rich,
the educated and the privileged should
respect the law even if it adversely

affects them.
Reges' actions are comparable to
those of the National Rifle Association,
whose members feel that gun control
laws infringe on their rights in doing
something that is 'victimless.' It is easy
to think that way when they live far
away from street crime.
In short, I believe every liberal should
come right out and condemn Reges'
actions. We should not be fooled by his
claims to represent a larger cause. His
actions fall neatly into the libertarian
strain of conservatism which opposes
any sacrifice of individual liberty to help
those in need.
