## MEChA, like AASA, serves community, deserves fee request 
### 
AS ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS
Association officers and Asian-
American community members,
we whole-heartedly support the MEChA
fee assessment. With this statement, we
would like to address two main points:
one, the question of democratic process,
and two, the reasons why we think it iS
of the utmost importance that MEChA
receive its special fee.
Many people have argued that placing
MEChA on the run-off ballot has disre
garded the democratic process. However,
close examination of the election would
show the democratic process was not
completely followed in the first place.
Because the ASSIJ Election Handbook
omitted information about the activities
funded by the MEChA lee, MEChA did
not receive democratic treatment, nor
was relevant information made available
to voters. As a result, students were not
informed that the fee is used to fund
many Chicano/Latino community events
and groups, such as Cinco de Mayo Cele
bration and Ballet Folklorico. (In fact,
only about 5 percent of the fee directly
funds MEChA). *
When the ASSU Senate voted to place
the MEChA fee on the run-off ballot, it
reinstituted a democratic process into an
election which had irregularities.
A democrat ic process which allows for
all perspectives to be heard fairly has
long been a priority for students of color.
For over 20 years, student of color
groups have worked to meet the needs of

their particular communities, while at
the same time striving to enrich and
improve the campus as a whole. The
MEChA fee assessment is part of this
ongoing legacy.
()ur support for the MEChA fee can
best he understood by explaining our
own reasons for building the Asian-
American community. In 1969, AASA
formed to serve the social, cultural and
issue-oriented needs of Asian-American
students.
In the 19705, AASA provided support
for the limited number of Asian-Ameri
cans on campus. Asian-American stu
dents in AASA initiated the formation of
Okada House as an institution that
would provide Asian-American program
ming, such as Extravaganza, for the
entire campus. They also founded the
Teahouse, which still serves late-night
snacks.
In the 1980s, AASA joined the Black
Student Union, MEChA and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization in
lobbying to change the required core
course "Western Culture" to the more
inclusive "Cultures, Ideas and Values."
Student of color groups, along with other
supportive students and faculty, advo
cated CIV because of the need to begin to
recognize and understand non-Western
cultures and peoples.
The Asian American Students Associ
at ion cannot be understood without rec
ognizing the greater social context of
Asian peoples in America. Neither can

the work of MEChA be separated from
the social context of Chicano/Latinos in
America. The needs of our communities
inside and outside of Stanford prompt us
to be active in student of color organiza
tions.
For Asian-Americans, there are cur
rent problems and issues which our com
munity must address. For example, there
has been an alarming rise in hate crimes
against both Asian and Chicano peoples
in the United States. In Chinatown in
San Francisco, garment workers are paid
$2 for a dress that sells on the market
for $100. Fifty percent of Philipino and
South East Asian youths drop out of
high school.
Many of the Asian-American students
at Stanford have been affected in some
way by the inequalities in the greater
society. Before arriving at Stanford, most
of us never learned much about the con
tributions and history of Asians in Amer
ica. In addit ion, many of us, and many of
our parents, have faced discrimination in
the workplace, in the schools and even in
our own neighborhoods.
For many of us, the Asian-American
community at Stanford is our first
opportunity to explore our identity, our
history and our concerns as a commu
nity. To this end, Asian-American stu
dents, wit h the help of the AASA special
fee, have developed community service
programs and many campus-wide events,
such as the Asian American Speakers

Series and the up-coming Asian Images
Centennial program.
MEChA has played a similar role in
building the Chicano/Latino community.
MEChA helped found campus institu
tions such as the Chicano Fellows Pro
gram, Casa Zapata and El Centro Chi
cano, as well as initiating community
service programs like Barrio Assistance
and Project Motivation.
Although Chicano/Latinos are the
largest minority in California, not many
Stanford students have learned much
about the history or culture of
Chicano/Latino peoples in America. The
MEChA special fee funds many cultural
and educational projects, such as Ballet
Folklorico, Cinco de Mayo, Zoot Suit
Week and many other programs, all open
to the Stanford community.
Student organizations are at the heart
of the development of Stanford student
life. The right to organize is fundamental
to American society. Over the past 20
years, AASA, MEChA and the other stu
dent of color groups have asserted this
right.
In addition to sponsoring social and
cultural events, the student of color
groups have also worked for the needs of
our communities and, in a greater sense,
for justice, equality and respect for all
people.
We sincerely hope the majority of this
campus will take to heart the contribu
tions and role of student of color groups
on this campus. It is important not to

lose sight of the fact that these groups
give every interested student on this
campus the opportunity to participate in
these events. The student of color fee
assessments fund completely volunteer
run, non-profit activities. Dollar-for-dol
lar, they are one of the best values
around.
As students on this campus, we can
appreciate the vibrant dances of Ballet
Folklorico, the music of Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band and the excite
ment of Cinco de Mayo. Supporting the
MEChA fee assessment supports many
Chicano/Latino events that enrich the
Stanford community as a whole.

When the ASSU Senate voted to place
the MEChA fee on the run-off ballot, it
reinstituted a democratic process into an
election which had irregularities.
A democrat ic process which allows for
all perspectives to be heard fairly has
long been a priority for students of color.
For over 20 years, student of color
groups have worked to meet the needs of

their particular communities, while at
the same time striving to enrich and
improve the campus as a whole. The
MEChA fee assessment is part of this
ongoing legacy.
()ur support for the MEChA fee can
best he understood by explaining our
own reasons for building the Asian-
American community. In 1969, AASA
formed to serve the social, cultural and
issue-oriented needs of Asian-American
students.
In the 19705, AASA provided support
for the limited number of Asian-Ameri
cans on campus. Asian-American stu
dents in AASA initiated the formation of
Okada House as an institution that
would provide Asian-American program
ming, such as Extravaganza, for the
entire campus. They also founded the
Teahouse, which still serves late-night
snacks.
In the 1980s, AASA joined the Black
Student Union, MEChA and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization in
lobbying to change the required core
course "Western Culture" to the more
inclusive "Cultures, Ideas and Values."
Student of color groups, along with other
supportive students and faculty, advo
cated CIV because of the need to begin to
recognize and understand non-Western
cultures and peoples.
The Asian American Students Associ
at ion cannot be understood without rec
ognizing the greater social context of
Asian peoples in America. Neither can

the work of MEChA be separated from
the social context of Chicano/Latinos in
America. The needs of our communities
inside and outside of Stanford prompt us
to be active in student of color organiza
tions.
For Asian-Americans, there are cur
rent problems and issues which our com
munity must address. For example, there
has been an alarming rise in hate crimes
against both Asian and Chicano peoples
in the United States. In Chinatown in
San Francisco, garment workers are paid
$2 for a dress that sells on the market
for $100. Fifty percent of Philipino and
South East Asian youths drop out of
high school.
Many of the Asian-American students
at Stanford have been affected in some
way by the inequalities in the greater
society. Before arriving at Stanford, most
of us never learned much about the con
tributions and history of Asians in Amer
ica. In addit ion, many of us, and many of
our parents, have faced discrimination in
the workplace, in the schools and even in
our own neighborhoods.
For many of us, the Asian-American
community at Stanford is our first
opportunity to explore our identity, our
history and our concerns as a commu
nity. To this end, Asian-American stu
dents, wit h the help of the AASA special
fee, have developed community service
programs and many campus-wide events,
such as the Asian American Speakers

Series and the up-coming Asian Images
Centennial program.
MEChA has played a similar role in
building the Chicano/Latino community.
MEChA helped found campus institu
tions such as the Chicano Fellows Pro
gram, Casa Zapata and El Centro Chi
cano, as well as initiating community
service programs like Barrio Assistance
and Project Motivation.
Although Chicano/Latinos are the
largest minority in California, not many
Stanford students have learned much
about the history or culture of
Chicano/Latino peoples in America. The
MEChA special fee funds many cultural
and educational projects, such as Ballet
Folklorico, Cinco de Mayo, Zoot Suit
Week and many other programs, all open
to the Stanford community.
Student organizations are at the heart
of the development of Stanford student
life. The right to organize is fundamental
to American society. Over the past 20
years, AASA, MEChA and the other stu
dent of color groups have asserted this
right.
In addition to sponsoring social and
cultural events, the student of color
groups have also worked for the needs of
our communities and, in a greater sense,
for justice, equality and respect for all
people.
We sincerely hope the majority of this
campus will take to heart the contribu
tions and role of student of color groups
on this campus. It is important not to

lose sight of the fact that these groups
give every interested student on this
campus the opportunity to participate in
these events. The student of color fee
assessments fund completely volunteer
run, non-profit activities. Dollar-for-dol
lar, they are one of the best values
around.
As students on this campus, we can
appreciate the vibrant dances of Ballet
Folklorico, the music of Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band and the excite
ment of Cinco de Mayo. Supporting the
MEChA fee assessment supports many
Chicano/Latino events that enrich the
Stanford community as a whole.

AS ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS
Association officers and Asian-
American community members,
we whole-heartedly support the MEChA
fee assessment. With this statement, we
would like to address two main points:
one, the question of democratic process,
and two, the reasons why we think it iS
of the utmost importance that MEChA
receive its special fee.
Many people have argued that placing
MEChA on the run-off ballot has disre
garded the democratic process. However,
close examination of the election would
show the democratic process was not
completely followed in the first place.
Because the ASSIJ Election Handbook
omitted information about the activities
funded by the MEChA lee, MEChA did
not receive democratic treatment, nor
was relevant information made available
to voters. As a result, students were not
informed that the fee is used to fund
many Chicano/Latino community events
and groups, such as Cinco de Mayo Cele
bration and Ballet Folklorico. (In fact,
only about 5 percent of the fee directly
funds MEChA). *
When the ASSU Senate voted to place
the MEChA fee on the run-off ballot, it
reinstituted a democratic process into an
election which had irregularities.
