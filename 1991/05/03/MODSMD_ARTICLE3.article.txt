# Record funding year falls 2nd to Harvard
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Once again, Stanford is second to Har
vard.
This time, though, it isn't so painful.
Second place in this case is $202.2 million.
This figure — the total for donations to
Stanford in the 1989-1990 school year —
comes to an average of $14,325 per student,
according to a survey released yesterday by
the Council for Aid to Education. Harvard
received $213.5 million, more than any
other institution. Harvard's donations
amount to $8,743 per student.
"It was a record year, the highest ever,"
said Richard Bennett, associate campaign
director for the Office of Development.
Private donors — including corpora

tions, alumni, religious groups and other
private organizations — gave a total of $9.8
billion to U.S. colleges and universities in
1990, a 10 percent increase from 1989.
Stanford's donations went up 7 percent,
while Harvard's increased 15 percent.
Bennett said one reason for the higher
than-average donations to Stanford was the
ongoing Centennial Campaign.
But because donors usually specify how
they would like their gift to be used, the
record-breaking donations will not do much
to alleviate Stanford's multimillion-dollar
budget crisis.
"It's not as if we have a big faucet (of
donations) that we can just turn on to solve
all the budget problems," Bennett said.
Only $2.8 million of the $202.2
million is "purely unrestricted
expendable" money, which the
University can spend as it
chooses. Bennett said that num
ber is "fairly constant" with other
years and added that it will defi
nitely go into the operating bud
get-
Bennett said he expects this
year's gifts to be lower than those
for the record-breaking 1989-
1990 school year.

He attributed that to the fact
that last year they had "some
really big hits." In addition, giv
ing money is "purely voluntary.
It's not as if you can say to some
one, 'You gave this much last year,
we want more.' You have to start
from zero each year."
Bennett said he does not think
the indirect-cost controversy has
had any effect on the fund raising.
"We've been looking very care
fully, but we haven't seen any
change in gift totals which could
possibly be attributed to that," he
said. "We've had a lot of questions
about what's going on, but that is

about it."
Since this survey covers dona
tions received during the 1989-90
school year, it would not reflect
any drop in funding caused by the
recession.
The largest donating group
was alumni, followed bv non
alumni individuals, corporate
donations, foundations and reli
gious groups.
For the past four years, Stan
ford occupied the number-one
position on the list.
