# Record funding year falls 2nd to Harvard

Once again, Stanford is second to Har
vard.
This time, though, it isn't so painful.
Second place in this case is $202.2 million.
This figure — the total for donations to
Stanford in the 1989-1990 school year —
comes to an average of $14,325 per student,
according to a survey released yesterday by
the Council for Aid to Education. Harvard
received $213.5 million, more than any
other institution. Harvard's donations
amount to $8,743 per student.
"It was a record year, the highest ever,"
said Richard Bennett, associate campaign
director for the Office of Development.
Private donors — including corpora

tions, alumni, religious groups and other
private organizations — gave a total of $9.8
billion to U.S. colleges and universities in
1990, a 10 percent increase from 1989.
Stanford's donations went up 7 percent,
while Harvard's increased 15 percent.
Bennett said one reason for the higher
than-average donations to Stanford was the
ongoing Centennial Campaign.
But because donors usually specify how
they would like their gift to be used, the
record-breaking donations will not do much
to alleviate Stanford's multimillion-dollar
budget crisis.
"It's not as if we have a big faucet (of
donations) that we can just turn on to solve
all the budget problems," Bennett said.
