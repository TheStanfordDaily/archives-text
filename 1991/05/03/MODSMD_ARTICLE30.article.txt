# Give the Büg a river and nothing to do

### John Ott Staff writer 
Muscles rippling in glistening heat,
1 hovered 1,000 feet above a limpid
pool that mirrored the bright blue of
the sky.
"When I gotta thirst. .
In a spiraling formation my buddies
and I dove our hang gliders still closer
to our friends — all neon, bronze and
peroxide, on horseback in the water
below.
. . drench it, quench it. .
With death-defying precision I
swooped in behind a woman riding
bareback in a bikini and, still grasping
the glider, mounted the horse.
. . smooth, refreshing. .
My legs firmly gripping the sides of
the steed, the three of us soared up out
of the water and into the cloudless
infinity.
. . do it, do it, Mountain Dew!"
I woke screaming.
It was a hangover like you read
about: My head was filled with week
old porridge and my stomach was spin
ning on its axis, but I had work to do. I
brushed away the 20 or so cans of
Mountain Dew I had imbibed the night
before and broke out the first letter.

Dear Biig,
In the song "Shake a Tail Feather,"
Ray Charles urges people to "do the
Watusi." Is there really a dance by that
name? No one I've asked knows how
one does the Watusi.

Given the current political climate
and the series of controversies that
have plagued Stanford of late, I'm not
sure I should answer this question.
I mean, the Watusi (also known as
the Wobble), while not addictive, is
viewed by many in positions of author
ity as dangerous. In fact, normally I
would concur with Mr. Charles and
recommend that you experiment with
it, but as a role model not only at Stan-

ford but in California proper, my
hands are tied.
On second thought, screw it. The
dance, as far as I can tell, goes some
thing like this:
1. Begin with hands at your sides,
legs slightly spread.
2. Take a step back with your left
foot, throw your hands back just past
your hips, and stick your head for
ward.
3. Return to the first position.
4. Take a step forward with your
right foot, raise hands over head and
clap, tilting head back.
5. Remember to alternate the roles
of each foot each cycle. Repeat until
you hemorrhage.
1 really hope none of you try this. I
got most of my information from
watching that scene in"The Blues
Brothers" and flipping through issues
of Life magazine from the '60s in the
cozy West Stacks of Green Library, so
my answer's more than a little sketchy.
Besides, you'll look like an idiot.
Keep in mind this dance was "hip" in
early-'6os discotheques along with
other winning numbers like the
Mashed Potato and the Hitchhiker.
I'd sooner watch Adrian Zhmed on
"Dance Fever." (I always thought
when you had a fever you should stay
in bed, not don purple spandex and

thrust your privates all about the
dance floor.)
Dear Rug,
When was the last time they cleaned
the big chairs in Green Library ?
If you slap them, a huge cloud of
dust comes off them.
A delightful bureaucratic jaunt
through the switchboard at Green
Library led me at last to Don Intersi
mone at the Facilities Services Office.
Though not completely certain, Inter
simone proclaimed that the immense
bed/chairs had been vacuumed "mavbe
in the last two years," and extraction
cleaning had not been performed upon
them in anywhere from three to five
years.
So be careful to close your mouth
next time you nod off while studying,
lest some weevil crawl into your lower
intestine and settle down. I guess you
better watch out for earwigs, too.
Hey! I'm just joking about the ver
min! Don't sue me.. . .
