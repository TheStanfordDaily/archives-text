# Lag Ness Monster returns
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Several unconfirmed reports of
mysterious sightings were report
ed both yesterday afternoon and
last night around the Lake Lagu
nita area. Some experts fear that
these sightings mark the return of
the "Lag Ness Monster" after a
nearly 50-vear hiatus.

A set of identical triplets visit
ing Stanford as prospective fresh
men made the first sighting yes
terday afternoon, according to
Dean of Aquatic Resources
Hieronymus Grubb. Boris, Robin
and Nat Shoemaker, who alleged
ly saw the beast, were "scared so
silly they couldn't speak," Grubb
said.
"They came into my office all a-

quiver," he said. "It's a darn
shame such lovely and talented
kids had to see something so terri
ble on their first visit to campus."
The trio from Paris, Texas, was
unable to comment.
Since yesterday's sighting, two
students and a professor have
reported seeing something
strange skimming across the lake.
The professor, who wished to
remain anonymous, said, "I had
just put on my backpack when I
saw it.
"For a second, I thought I was
seeing things."
The students, freshmen John
McClure and Marsha Blockwaller
were sharing a romantic moment
on the beach late last night when
the beast appeared.
"It was scary, hut I've seen
worse," Blockwaller said McClure
and Blockwaller said they went to
the Bridge for counseling after the
event."It helped lots," Block
waller said.
The monster has enjoyed a
notorious past at Stanford. On
April 1, 1943, a sighting drove sev
eral members of the Lamba Lamb
da Mu sorority to temporary
insanity. They subsequently lost
their house because of "indeco
rous behavior," according to an
article published in The Stanford
Moralist.

This story is entirely fictional.
Don't believe a word of it. Unless it
makes you feel smooth inside.


The Lag Ness monster raises its head before a crowd of trembling
onlookers. The beast, which has not been spotted for 50 years,
scared members of one sorority into temporary insanity that
inspired much naughtiness.
