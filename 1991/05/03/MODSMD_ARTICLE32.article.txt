The Stanford Daily
Two Stanford graduates agreed to donate dead
animal parts to the Stanford Museum. Fletcher
(Fletch) and Kenneth Walker spent three months in
Africa on safari, and returned with "large skulls" for
their alma mater.
Seemingly just to prove how slow a news day it
was, The Daily also ran an article on the front page
describing the amazing luck of a student who was
dealt a perfect hand of 13 spades in a bridge game.
(Wow! That's so cool. And I thought ASSU elections
were important.)

The Stanford Daily
The Bell-ringing Bandit was apprehended last
night. A Quasimodoesque character had been terror
izing the campus for the past few weeks, breaking
into the top of Hoover Tower late at night and play
ing tunes on the bells.
The Crooked Carillonneur was captured by a
group of women as he fled from his latest recital. The
women, who were holding a meeting on the 12th
floor of Hoover Tower, turned him over to the police.
No one could deny that the Tintinnabulary Thief
was conscientious, though. Having damaged the lock
on the door when gaining entry to the belfry, he had
left a note of apology and 45 cents. The Criminal
Campanologist was sentenced to five hours of volun
teer work at a local nursing home as punishment for
his crimes.
