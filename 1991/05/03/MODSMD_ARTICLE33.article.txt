# Between a rock and a hard place

It was just my luck. No one ever said
growing up was easy. Then again, I
was the only kid who ever continu
ally struck out in T-ball games. I think
my coach of a Dad was bummed. It was
hard for him to justify even having me
suit up much less putting me beyond the
right field fence shagging balls.
Other people have dreams of what
they wunt to bo when they grow up. I
just hoped I would survive the process. I
think I hold the record for cracking my
head open the most times. Reach up to
your head, and you'll probably find that
your skull is hard. Mine still has that
baby's soft spot and twenty different
skull plates. Some kids hope for puberty
— me, just cranial fusion.
The first time I ever cracked my head
open was on a swing at preschool. I
loved swinging super high and scream
ing at the top of my lungs. (We all have
our fetishes.) One day, the noon-duty
attendant became so annoyed that she
began yelling, "Stop that or you're going
to fall off and crack your head open!"
While she was screaming at me, I lost
concentration, fell off and cracked my
head open.
Being the innovative preschool thnt
it was, it had just installed gravel on the
playground, (travel was better than
grass because parents could brush their
kids clothes off instead of having to
wash grass stains out all the time. From
what the surgery felt like, I took it that
my doctor must have been an advocate
of the gravel because it felt like he
brushed, not washed, the gravel out of
the back of my head.
Two weeks later I went to the doc
tor's to have my stitches removed. He
said that once the hair grew back, no
one would be able to see all of the bumps
in my scalp from the gravel they missed.
Mom was so proud that I didn't seri
ously injure anyone when I screamed,
clawed and kicked while they took my
stitches out that she got me a tiny pink
Hot Wheels car to celebrate.
Hack in the car, Mom said I could play
with it as long as I stayed in my seat
belt. I loved our GM Monte Carlo; it was

one of those great '70s wonders that got
three miles to the gallon, had an eight
track cassette player in it and was so
long it had to have a sticker in the hack
that said "Warning: This vehicle makes
wide right turns."
It was so big inside that it was almost
like playing in your backyard. On rainy
days, all the neighborhood kids would
pile into the Hoge's tanker for an after
noon of fun.
Finally home, Mom got out to raise
our garage door, and 1 headed to the
floor of the car to continue playing. All I
remember after that was accidentally
"driving" my Hot Wheel down near
mom's feet as she began to pull into the
garage. As 1 went to retrieve it, 1 fell on
her right foot. In the end, we had driven
through the back wall of the garage and
into our yard.
When 1 woke up in the hospital, I
found out they were able to stitch me up
right away because my head was already
shaved. Dad decided to leave the back
wall of the garage in it's new location,
about eight feet into the living room.
For the first time, the entire Monte
Carlo actually fit in our garage! The fact
that the front of the car was dented in
four feet helped, too.
As my hair grew out and I grew up, 1
slowly regained enough confidence to
face the world. So there I was, six years
old, skipping down the street in my
Brownie uniform: hair parted down the

middle and pulled back so tightly in clips
that I had a permanent smile on my
face; coal-colored, horned-rim glasses
accentuating I don't know what; and
brown knee-hi socks stretched up to
their limit around mid-thigh. I was on a
mission to sell a box of Girl Scout Cook
ies to my troop mother.
Reaching her house, I climbed the
stairs to her second-storv front door and
rang the door bell. Alas! I had a great
idea. Why not sit atop the thin metal
railing surrounding the entry-way
porch so I could look my troop mother,
Mrs. Smith, right in her four eyes with
my four eyes making eight eyes when
she opened the door? (Note: First
remembered application of arithmetic
outside of the classroom. Funny, 1 have
yet to have an equivalent calculus expe
rience.)
Seconds later, Mrs. Smith swung the
door open — deferring her option to use
any of the eight available eyes — oppo
site the way I anticipated, succeeding
only in knocking me off the railing.
Head first, skirt hiked, and my Tuesday
panties exposed for the whole world to
see, I fell 10 feet onto Mrs. Smith's infa
mous gravel lawn. 1 guess she didn't like
grass stains either.
If you guessed that I ended back up in
the hospital with a shaved head, you
must have experienced cranial fusion. I
did manage, however, to sell a ton of
sympathy boxes of the year's hottest
cookie, Thin Mints. The doctor even
washed my wound out!
To this day, I still haven't given up on
trying to be a little kid and hoping for
cranial fusion. I do have a feeling,
though, that it may take forever to get it
right.
Hut, we should never stop trying. We
should never stop dreaming about what
we want to be when we grow up. And
never let anyone tell you it's not OK to
still have a soft spot. ... in your heart
for vour childhood.

her right foot. In the end, we had driven
through the back wall of the garage and
into our yard.
When 1 woke up in the hospital, I
found out they were able to stitch me up
right away because my head was already
shaved. Dad decided to leave the back
wall of the garage in it's new location,
about eight feet into the living room.
For the first time, the entire Monte
Carlo actually fit in our garage! The fact
that the front of the car was dented in
four feet helped, too.
As my hair grew out and I grew up, 1
slowly regained enough confidence to
face the world. So there I was, six years
old, skipping down the street in my
Brownie uniform: hair parted down the

middle and pulled back so tightly in clips
that I had a permanent smile on my
face; coal-colored, horned-rim glasses
accentuating I don't know what; and
brown knee-hi socks stretched up to
their limit around mid-thigh. I was on a
mission to sell a box of Girl Scout Cook
ies to my troop mother.
Reaching her house, I climbed the
stairs to her second-storv front door and
rang the door bell. Alas! I had a great
idea. Why not sit atop the thin metal
railing surrounding the entry-way
porch so I could look my troop mother,
Mrs. Smith, right in her four eyes with
my four eyes making eight eyes when
she opened the door? (Note: First
remembered application of arithmetic
outside of the classroom. Funny, 1 have
yet to have an equivalent calculus expe
rience.)
Seconds later, Mrs. Smith swung the
door open — deferring her option to use
any of the eight available eyes — oppo
site the way I anticipated, succeeding
only in knocking me off the railing.
Head first, skirt hiked, and my Tuesday
panties exposed for the whole world to
see, I fell 10 feet onto Mrs. Smith's infa
mous gravel lawn. 1 guess she didn't like
grass stains either.
If you guessed that I ended back up in
the hospital with a shaved head, you
must have experienced cranial fusion. I
did manage, however, to sell a ton of
sympathy boxes of the year's hottest
cookie, Thin Mints. The doctor even
washed my wound out!
To this day, I still haven't given up on
trying to be a little kid and hoping for
cranial fusion. I do have a feeling,
though, that it may take forever to get it
right.
Hut, we should never stop trying. We
should never stop dreaming about what
we want to be when we grow up. And
never let anyone tell you it's not OK to
still have a soft spot. ... in your heart
for vour childhood.

Anne lloge won't let you touch her "soft
spot" on the first date. Her column

Just My Luck
It was just my luck. No one ever said
growing up was easy. Then again, I
was the only kid who ever continu
ally struck out in T-ball games. I think
my coach of a Dad was bummed. It was
hard for him to justify even having me
suit up much less putting me beyond the
right field fence shagging balls.
Other people have dreams of what
they wunt to bo when they grow up. I
just hoped I would survive the process. I
think I hold the record for cracking my
head open the most times. Reach up to
your head, and you'll probably find that
your skull is hard. Mine still has that
baby's soft spot and twenty different
skull plates. Some kids hope for puberty
— me, just cranial fusion.
The first time I ever cracked my head
open was on a swing at preschool. I
loved swinging super high and scream
ing at the top of my lungs. (We all have
our fetishes.) One day, the noon-duty
attendant became so annoyed that she
began yelling, "Stop that or you're going
to fall off and crack your head open!"
While she was screaming at me, I lost
concentration, fell off and cracked my
head open.
Being the innovative preschool thnt
it was, it had just installed gravel on the
playground, (travel was better than
grass because parents could brush their
kids clothes off instead of having to
wash grass stains out all the time. From
what the surgery felt like, I took it that
my doctor must have been an advocate
of the gravel because it felt like he
brushed, not washed, the gravel out of
the back of my head.
Two weeks later I went to the doc
tor's to have my stitches removed. He
said that once the hair grew back, no
one would be able to see all of the bumps
in my scalp from the gravel they missed.
Mom was so proud that I didn't seri
ously injure anyone when I screamed,
clawed and kicked while they took my
stitches out that she got me a tiny pink
Hot Wheels car to celebrate.
Hack in the car, Mom said I could play
with it as long as I stayed in my seat
belt. I loved our GM Monte Carlo; it was

one of those great '70s wonders that got
three miles to the gallon, had an eight
track cassette player in it and was so
long it had to have a sticker in the hack
that said "Warning: This vehicle makes
wide right turns."
It was so big inside that it was almost
like playing in your backyard. On rainy
days, all the neighborhood kids would
pile into the Hoge's tanker for an after
noon of fun.
Finally home, Mom got out to raise
our garage door, and 1 headed to the
floor of the car to continue playing. All I
remember after that was accidentally
"driving" my Hot Wheel down near
mom's feet as she began to pull into the
garage. As 1 went to retrieve it, 1 fell on
her right foot. In the end, we had driven
through the back wall of the garage and
into our yard.
When 1 woke up in the hospital, I
found out they were able to stitch me up
