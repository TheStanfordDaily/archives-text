# An apology to our readers
## 
### 
Last week's pro fro story was lies, all lies.
We're sorry for being untruthful. It sound
ed like such a good idea at the time.
But after receiving letters and phone
calls, and moderating numerous dorm dis
cussions, we realized it was time to clear the
air. So, for the record, the story was made
up, and the photo was doctored.
The craziest thing of all, however, is how
many people swallowed it, hook, line and

sinker. Even Hes Ed was hornswoggled.
Whatever happened to "don't believe
everything you read"? Is it true just because
it was printed in The Daily?
Listen: loosen up kimosabes, and read
with a critical eye. From time to time people
are going to pull your leg And you don't
want to be caught in an embarrassing posi
tion again. It could cause permanent dam
age.
Candy-asses.
