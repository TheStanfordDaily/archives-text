I cblems will not be easy to fix. It is important to
i tween the short and long range problems.
hi m Problems and Objectives
' me turn to an overview of the immediate future.
• nigh we doubt that the indirect cost rate will return
'Otis |, vcls, we view the government's action to
t 1 indirect cost rate to its present low level as a tem
" nation. Federal regulations make clear that univer
se entitled to recover their actual research costs,
ling indirect costs. Although we have limited options
it term recovery, our first priority must be to do
mi necessary to establish our actual costs under new
>i wc do this, our billing rate can return to a more
MM level and we can make the showing needed to
1 !i out costs in year-end audits.
' Nation of the Memoranda of Understanding

will entail a great deal of work for Stanford as it must collect
different data and conduct new studies to establish its indi
rect costs under new standards. Until we can establish the
basis for a different rate, we will be operating under a provi
sional rate based essentially on a "default" method of calcu
lating costs — that is, Government regulations allow the
recovery of only a minimum amount of costs in the absence
of special studies and surveys that establish and allocate true
costs. This is somewhat akin to the standard deduction on
the federal income tax form. Stanford wants to itemize its
expenses rather than use the standard deduction, but at the
moment lacks documentation necessary to prove its true
costs.
We believe that discussions and special studies leading to
a new indirect cost rate can be completed before the end of
fiscal year 1992, thus enabling us to establish some part of
our real costs for that year. It is too soon to say what Stan
ford's rate will be upon completion of the special studies.
Preliminary calculations by Stanford's Controller and our
consultants from Arthur Andersen & Co. suggest an indirect
cost rate not greatly different from the provisional rate of
70% we had earlier this year — that is, presuming a continu
ation of current regulatory policies. If regulatory policies
should change, which seems entirely likely given current
events in Washington, then indirect cost recovery at lower
levels is a distinct possibility.
In the meantime, dealing with current budget shortfalls
must be our first priority. Our short term objectives are:
• Reduce expenses as much as we can bear, and wherev
er we can.
• Limit disruption to Stanford's academic programs and
support services.
• Reduce hardship to individuals.
• Limit the amount of reserve funds we will need to
spend in order to stabilize the budget.
In order to provide for an orderly transition through this
difficult period to a new environment, the Board of Trustees
is willing to use financial reserves in a careful and limited
way. These funds will buffer the University somewhat from
the immediate budget shortfalls, at least until we can devel
op and implement our longer-range plans. However, even
the infusion of some reserves will not relieve the strain on
the budget nor the resulting pain it will inevitably cause to
people and programs at the University; and we must, of
course, be extremely cautious about the use of the Universi
ty's capital to solve short-run problems.
Actions To Be Taken in the Current Fiscal Year
I recognize that all operating budget units — both aca
demic and administrative — have had to tighten their belts
already this year; first with Repositioning cuts, and then
again with budget holdbacks last November. However,
given the seriousness of the situation we face today, we need
to make additional efforts to reduce expenses for the remain
der of the University's fiscal year, which ends on August
31st.
As a result, I will be working with deans, vice presidents,
and the school management group to implement the follow
ing actions:
Expense reductions in all units. I believe there is an
opportunity for further one-time reduction of
expenditures to achieve savings. I plan to meet
with each dean and vice president to discuss a spe
cific expense reduction target and to explore how
additional savings might be achieved. I do not
believe that layoffs will be required to achieve our
savings expectations in the current fiscal year,
apart from those remaining layoffs connected with
the Repositioning effort; however, delaying
replacements for vacant positions and reducing
non-salary expenditures will most likely be neces
sary.
— Limiting hiring. During the reminder of this year, we
will be filling only those positions critical to the
long-term health of the the University. Decisions
on such positions must be reviewed and approved
by the cognizant dean or vice president. I plan to
discuss this matter with all deans and vice presi
dents, and work with the new Vice President for
Human Resources to establish a better way to
monitor hiring.
— Reduction of capital expenditures. We have slowed
and delayed a number of facilities projects. We
have not, however, reduced any of our current
plans regarding the earthquake repair program.
— Slowing library acquisitions. We plan to slow the
rate of purchase of monographs in the libraries
over the remainder of the year.
— Use of Interest Earnings on Designated Funds.
Because we will be calling upon the University's
reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating
budget at their current levels. This means that
budget for such items as materials, services, and
travel will not be increased to account for price
inflation.
— A six month delay in implementation of the salary
program for both faculty and staff. We will rec
ommend the following salary program:
• The 1991-92 salary program will be implement
ed on March 1, 1992.
• For faculty, schools will receive base allocations that
will permit raises averaging 4%.
• For nonexempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
Non-exempt staff in the steps of the four
step range structure will remain eligible
to receive programmed increases begin
ning on March 1, 1992.
• For exempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined
by negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers on a
new agreement. The current three-year
agreement expires on August 31st; nego
tiations are expected to begin in the near
future.
— Additional one-time budget reductions and holdbacks.
In preparing their three year plans for next year, I
have asked deans and vice presidents to prepare
for a 2% holdback. We may need to ask for addi
tional reductions.
— Elimination of funding for innovation. As I
announced to the Senate earlier this year, there will
be no incremental funds set aside in next year's
budget for consolidations and improvements.
— Other Possibilities. The University Cabinet and Bud
get Group will be considering other alternative
measures for budget reduction next year, including
limits on hiring, reduced capital expenditures, and
other actions. We will do everything we can to
avoid layoffs related to this deficit reduction pro
gram in the next fiscal year.
The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid
eration by the University Cabinet and the larger University
community. Membership of the Committee includes facul
ty, administrators, and student representatives. The commit
tee has already begun to meet and will continue to work
through next year until it finishes its job in spring or summer
of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc
cess and good fortune is by design, and not accident. The
legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled
this institution in a mere 100 years to become one of the
leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will
emerge from this difficult episode leaner, yet strong and
vital, with an undiminished commitment and spirit to fulfill
our mission of research and teaching.
APPENDIX
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT BUDGET
REDUCTION ACTIONS
FOR THE 1990-91 ANI) 1991-92 FISCAL YEARS
What is the main point of the Provost's announcement?
The University is taking a series of actions to reduce this
year's and next year's budgets and therefore lessen the
impact of the reduced provisional (temporary) indirect cost
rate of 55.5% for federal grants and contracts at Stanford.
Unless we take action immediately, the lower rate translates
into an estimated $20 million shortfall for the current year,
and an estimated $30 million shortfall for the fiscal year

beginning September 1, 1991. The Medical School, which
operates on its own budget, is also facing shortfalls because
of the lower indirect cost rate.
Why do private research universities like Stanford rely on
the federal government for research funding?
The majority of research at Stanford, as well as at other
major universities, is paid for by the federal government as
part of the nation's overall plan to stay scientifically and
technologically competitive with the rest of the world.
Indeed, most of the country's basic research takes place only
within universities. This successful, productive research
partnership has existed since the end of World War II
Research funding is divided into two categories: direct costs
and indirect costs. Direct costs are those expenses that can
be attributed directly to specific research projects, such as
equipment, supplies, travel related to the project, and salaries
of faculty, students, and postdoctoral investigators involved.
Indirect costs are administrative and infrastructure costs that
support research but cannot be attributed directly to any one
project. These expenses include facilities and maintenance,
utilities, security and fire protection, libraries, payroll and
accounting, and other central and departmental administra
tive costs. Federal government policy makes it clear that
universities are entitled to recover their actual research costs,
including indirect costs.
I.ast year, the federal government funded $175.9 million lor
the direct costs of research it sponsored at Stanford, not
including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SI.AC).
Reimbursement for the indirect costs of federally sponsored
research totaled $84.4 million of Stanford's operating budget
last year, about 21% of the total.
Where will the budget cuts he made?
Between now and August 31, which is the end of the current
fiscal year, a variety of actions will be taken to reduce
expenses in all academic and administrative units, l or the
1991-92 fiscal year, which begins Sept. 1, further efforts will
be taken to reduce expenses, including a delay of six months
in the implementation of the salary program for both faculty
and staff. Deans, vice presidents, and directors, in consulta
tion with faculty and managers, will make specific decisions
regarding spending reduction in their own areas.
Will any programs he eliminated?
The focus of the immediate budget actions over the next If)
months is on reducing expenses within academic and admin
istrative programs, and not on eliminating programs them
selves.
Will salaries he affected?
The annual salary program for faculty and exempt and non
exempt staff, which normally takes effect on Sept. 1, will be
delayed for six months — that is, current faculty and staff
salaries will remain the same until March 1, 1902.
Detailed information on the salary program will be forth
coming from Human Resources.
How will these steps affect the wages of bargaining unit
employees?
The current three year agreement between Stanford and the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680, is scheduled to expire
on August 31. Negotiations are expected to begin in the
near future on a new agreement. Wage rates tor bargaining
unit staff after August 31 will be determined by these negoti
ations.
Will there be layoffs?
At this time, we do not anticipate layoffs related to this
deficit reduction program in the current fiscal year ending
August 31. Next year we will do all that we can to avoid
layoffs. Attrition, elimination of open positions, anil other
means will be considered first
How will these actions affect students?
The University has already made decisions about tuition for
next year — holding it to 1% above the expected rate ol
inflation, as was pledged last year. Stanford will also assure
that sufficient resources for student financial aid are avail
able at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
Why don't we use contributions from the successful Cen
tennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the Centennial Cam
paign already goes directly to the University's annual operat
ing budget. The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as building projects,
equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
and students — has begun to reevaluate the University's pn
orities. Over the next 12 months, the committee will be
developing specific proposals for permanently restructuring
Stanford's academic and supporting units. The Committee is
chaired by Provost Rossc; the deputy chair is Prof. Charles
Krugcr, who is chair of the Faculty Senate.
How will the University community be kept informed?
How can 1 get more specific information on how my unit
might be affected?
There will be an organized effort to keep people informed
over the coming weeks and months. Deans and vice presi
dents will be asked to communicate regularly on the details
of their own planning efforts with faculty and stall members
in their areas. In addition, updates on the situation will be
provided via employee mailings, electronic mail, and Cam
pus Report. For information on how the changes will affect
your unit, please contact your supervisor.

reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating
budget at their current levels. This means that
budget for such items as materials, services, and
travel will not be increased to account for price
inflation.
— A six month delay in implementation of the salary
program for both faculty and staff. We will rec
ommend the following salary program:
• The 1991-92 salary program will be implement
ed on March 1, 1992.
• For faculty, schools will receive base allocations that
will permit raises averaging 4%.
• For nonexempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
Non-exempt staff in the steps of the four
step range structure will remain eligible
to receive programmed increases begin
ning on March 1, 1992.
• For exempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined
by negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers on a
new agreement. The current three-year
agreement expires on August 31st; nego
tiations are expected to begin in the near
future.
— Additional one-time budget reductions and holdbacks.
In preparing their three year plans for next year, I
have asked deans and vice presidents to prepare
for a 2% holdback. We may need to ask for addi
tional reductions.
— Elimination of funding for innovation. As I
announced to the Senate earlier this year, there will
be no incremental funds set aside in next year's
budget for consolidations and improvements.
— Other Possibilities. The University Cabinet and Bud
get Group will be considering other alternative
measures for budget reduction next year, including
limits on hiring, reduced capital expenditures, and
other actions. We will do everything we can to
avoid layoffs related to this deficit reduction pro
gram in the next fiscal year.
The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid
eration by the University Cabinet and the larger University
community. Membership of the Committee includes facul
ty, administrators, and student representatives. The commit
tee has already begun to meet and will continue to work
through next year until it finishes its job in spring or summer
of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc
cess and good fortune is by design, and not accident. The
legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled
this institution in a mere 100 years to become one of the
leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will
emerge from this difficult episode leaner, yet strong and
vital, with an undiminished commitment and spirit to fulfill
our mission of research and teaching.
APPENDIX
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT BUDGET
REDUCTION ACTIONS
FOR THE 1990-91 ANI) 1991-92 FISCAL YEARS
What is the main point of the Provost's announcement?
The University is taking a series of actions to reduce this
year's and next year's budgets and therefore lessen the
impact of the reduced provisional (temporary) indirect cost
rate of 55.5% for federal grants and contracts at Stanford.
Unless we take action immediately, the lower rate translates
into an estimated $20 million shortfall for the current year,
and an estimated $30 million shortfall for the fiscal year

beginning September 1, 1991. The Medical School, which
operates on its own budget, is also facing shortfalls because
of the lower indirect cost rate.
Why do private research universities like Stanford rely on
the federal government for research funding?
The majority of research at Stanford, as well as at other
major universities, is paid for by the federal government as
part of the nation's overall plan to stay scientifically and
technologically competitive with the rest of the world.
Indeed, most of the country's basic research takes place only
within universities. This successful, productive research
partnership has existed since the end of World War II
Research funding is divided into two categories: direct costs
and indirect costs. Direct costs are those expenses that can
be attributed directly to specific research projects, such as
equipment, supplies, travel related to the project, and salaries
of faculty, students, and postdoctoral investigators involved.
Indirect costs are administrative and infrastructure costs that
support research but cannot be attributed directly to any one
project. These expenses include facilities and maintenance,
utilities, security and fire protection, libraries, payroll and
accounting, and other central and departmental administra
tive costs. Federal government policy makes it clear that
universities are entitled to recover their actual research costs,
including indirect costs.
I.ast year, the federal government funded $175.9 million lor
the direct costs of research it sponsored at Stanford, not
including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SI.AC).
Reimbursement for the indirect costs of federally sponsored
research totaled $84.4 million of Stanford's operating budget
last year, about 21% of the total.
Where will the budget cuts he made?
Between now and August 31, which is the end of the current
fiscal year, a variety of actions will be taken to reduce
expenses in all academic and administrative units, l or the
1991-92 fiscal year, which begins Sept. 1, further efforts will
be taken to reduce expenses, including a delay of six months
in the implementation of the salary program for both faculty
and staff. Deans, vice presidents, and directors, in consulta
tion with faculty and managers, will make specific decisions
regarding spending reduction in their own areas.
Will any programs he eliminated?
The focus of the immediate budget actions over the next If)
months is on reducing expenses within academic and admin
istrative programs, and not on eliminating programs them
selves.
Will salaries he affected?
The annual salary program for faculty and exempt and non
exempt staff, which normally takes effect on Sept. 1, will be
delayed for six months — that is, current faculty and staff
salaries will remain the same until March 1, 1902.
Detailed information on the salary program will be forth
coming from Human Resources.
How will these steps affect the wages of bargaining unit
employees?
The current three year agreement between Stanford and the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680, is scheduled to expire
on August 31. Negotiations are expected to begin in the
near future on a new agreement. Wage rates tor bargaining
unit staff after August 31 will be determined by these negoti
ations.
Will there be layoffs?
At this time, we do not anticipate layoffs related to this
deficit reduction program in the current fiscal year ending
August 31. Next year we will do all that we can to avoid
layoffs. Attrition, elimination of open positions, anil other
means will be considered first
How will these actions affect students?
The University has already made decisions about tuition for
next year — holding it to 1% above the expected rate ol
inflation, as was pledged last year. Stanford will also assure
that sufficient resources for student financial aid are avail
able at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
Why don't we use contributions from the successful Cen
tennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the Centennial Cam
paign already goes directly to the University's annual operat
ing budget. The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as building projects,
equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
and students — has begun to reevaluate the University's pn
orities. Over the next 12 months, the committee will be
developing specific proposals for permanently restructuring
Stanford's academic and supporting units. The Committee is
chaired by Provost Rossc; the deputy chair is Prof. Charles
Krugcr, who is chair of the Faculty Senate.
How will the University community be kept informed?
How can 1 get more specific information on how my unit
might be affected?
There will be an organized effort to keep people informed
over the coming weeks and months. Deans and vice presi
dents will be asked to communicate regularly on the details
of their own planning efforts with faculty and stall members
in their areas. In addition, updates on the situation will be
provided via employee mailings, electronic mail, and Cam
pus Report. For information on how the changes will affect
your unit, please contact your supervisor.

we can and will overcome. 1 will outline a series of

i tween the short and long range problems.
hi m Problems and Objectives
' me turn to an overview of the immediate future.
• nigh we doubt that the indirect cost rate will return
'Otis |, vcls, we view the government's action to
t 1 indirect cost rate to its present low level as a tem
" nation. Federal regulations make clear that univer
se entitled to recover their actual research costs,
ling indirect costs. Although we have limited options
it term recovery, our first priority must be to do
mi necessary to establish our actual costs under new
>i wc do this, our billing rate can return to a more
MM level and we can make the showing needed to
1 !i out costs in year-end audits.
' Nation of the Memoranda of Understanding

will entail a great deal of work for Stanford as it must collect
different data and conduct new studies to establish its indi
rect costs under new standards. Until we can establish the
basis for a different rate, we will be operating under a provi
sional rate based essentially on a "default" method of calcu
lating costs — that is, Government regulations allow the
recovery of only a minimum amount of costs in the absence
of special studies and surveys that establish and allocate true
costs. This is somewhat akin to the standard deduction on
the federal income tax form. Stanford wants to itemize its
expenses rather than use the standard deduction, but at the
moment lacks documentation necessary to prove its true
costs.
We believe that discussions and special studies leading to
a new indirect cost rate can be completed before the end of
fiscal year 1992, thus enabling us to establish some part of
our real costs for that year. It is too soon to say what Stan
ford's rate will be upon completion of the special studies.
Preliminary calculations by Stanford's Controller and our
consultants from Arthur Andersen & Co. suggest an indirect
cost rate not greatly different from the provisional rate of
70% we had earlier this year — that is, presuming a continu
ation of current regulatory policies. If regulatory policies
should change, which seems entirely likely given current
events in Washington, then indirect cost recovery at lower
levels is a distinct possibility.
In the meantime, dealing with current budget shortfalls
must be our first priority. Our short term objectives are:
• Reduce expenses as much as we can bear, and wherev
er we can.
• Limit disruption to Stanford's academic programs and
support services.
• Reduce hardship to individuals.
• Limit the amount of reserve funds we will need to
spend in order to stabilize the budget.
In order to provide for an orderly transition through this
difficult period to a new environment, the Board of Trustees
is willing to use financial reserves in a careful and limited
way. These funds will buffer the University somewhat from
the immediate budget shortfalls, at least until we can devel
op and implement our longer-range plans. However, even
the infusion of some reserves will not relieve the strain on
the budget nor the resulting pain it will inevitably cause to
people and programs at the University; and we must, of
course, be extremely cautious about the use of the Universi
ty's capital to solve short-run problems.
Actions To Be Taken in the Current Fiscal Year
I recognize that all operating budget units — both aca
demic and administrative — have had to tighten their belts
already this year; first with Repositioning cuts, and then
again with budget holdbacks last November. However,
given the seriousness of the situation we face today, we need
to make additional efforts to reduce expenses for the remain
der of the University's fiscal year, which ends on August
31st.
As a result, I will be working with deans, vice presidents,
and the school management group to implement the follow
ing actions:
Expense reductions in all units. I believe there is an
opportunity for further one-time reduction of
expenditures to achieve savings. I plan to meet
with each dean and vice president to discuss a spe
cific expense reduction target and to explore how
additional savings might be achieved. I do not
believe that layoffs will be required to achieve our
savings expectations in the current fiscal year,
apart from those remaining layoffs connected with
the Repositioning effort; however, delaying
replacements for vacant positions and reducing
non-salary expenditures will most likely be neces
sary.
— Limiting hiring. During the reminder of this year, we
will be filling only those positions critical to the
long-term health of the the University. Decisions
on such positions must be reviewed and approved
by the cognizant dean or vice president. I plan to
discuss this matter with all deans and vice presi
dents, and work with the new Vice President for
Human Resources to establish a better way to
monitor hiring.
— Reduction of capital expenditures. We have slowed
and delayed a number of facilities projects. We
have not, however, reduced any of our current
plans regarding the earthquake repair program.
— Slowing library acquisitions. We plan to slow the
rate of purchase of monographs in the libraries
over the remainder of the year.
— Use of Interest Earnings on Designated Funds.
Because we will be calling upon the University's
reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating
budget at their current levels. This means that
budget for such items as materials, services, and
travel will not be increased to account for price
inflation.
— A six month delay in implementation of the salary
program for both faculty and staff. We will rec
ommend the following salary program:
• The 1991-92 salary program will be implement

• For faculty, schools will receive base allocations that
will permit raises averaging 4%.
• For nonexempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
Non-exempt staff in the steps of the four

to receive programmed increases begin

• For exempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined
by negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers on a
new agreement. The current three-year
agreement expires on August 31st; nego
tiations are expected to begin in the near

— Additional one-time budget reductions and holdbacks.
In preparing their three year plans for next year, I
have asked deans and vice presidents to prepare
for a 2% holdback. We may need to ask for addi
tional reductions.
— Elimination of funding for innovation. As I

get Group will be considering other alternative

other actions. We will do everything we can to

gram in the next fiscal year.
The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid

of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc
cess and good fortune is by design, and not accident. The
legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled

leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will
emerge from this difficult episode leaner, yet strong and
vital, with an undiminished commitment and spirit to fulfill
our mission of research and teaching.

paign already goes directly to the University's annual operat
ing budget. The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as building projects,
equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
and students — has begun to reevaluate the University's pn
orities. Over the next 12 months, the committee will be
developing specific proposals for permanently restructuring
Stanford's academic and supporting units. The Committee is
chaired by Provost Rossc; the deputy chair is Prof. Charles
Krugcr, who is chair of the Faculty Senate.
How will the University community be kept informed?
How can 1 get more specific information on how my unit
might be affected?
There will be an organized effort to keep people informed
over the coming weeks and months. Deans and vice presi
dents will be asked to communicate regularly on the details
of their own planning efforts with faculty and stall members
in their areas. In addition, updates on the situation will be
provided via employee mailings, electronic mail, and Cam
pus Report. For information on how the changes will affect
your unit, please contact your supervisor.

I cblems will not be easy to fix. It is important to
i tween the short and long range problems.
hi m Problems and Objectives
' me turn to an overview of the immediate future.
• nigh we doubt that the indirect cost rate will return
'Otis |, vcls, we view the government's action to
t 1 indirect cost rate to its present low level as a tem
" nation. Federal regulations make clear that univer
se entitled to recover their actual research costs,
ling indirect costs. Although we have limited options
it term recovery, our first priority must be to do
mi necessary to establish our actual costs under new
>i wc do this, our billing rate can return to a more
MM level and we can make the showing needed to
1 !i out costs in year-end audits.
' Nation of the Memoranda of Understanding

will entail a great deal of work for Stanford as it must collect
different data and conduct new studies to establish its indi
rect costs under new standards. Until we can establish the
basis for a different rate, we will be operating under a provi
sional rate based essentially on a "default" method of calcu
lating costs — that is, Government regulations allow the
recovery of only a minimum amount of costs in the absence
of special studies and surveys that establish and allocate true
costs. This is somewhat akin to the standard deduction on
the federal income tax form. Stanford wants to itemize its
expenses rather than use the standard deduction, but at the
moment lacks documentation necessary to prove its true
costs.
We believe that discussions and special studies leading to
a new indirect cost rate can be completed before the end of
fiscal year 1992, thus enabling us to establish some part of
our real costs for that year. It is too soon to say what Stan
ford's rate will be upon completion of the special studies.
Preliminary calculations by Stanford's Controller and our
consultants from Arthur Andersen & Co. suggest an indirect
cost rate not greatly different from the provisional rate of
70% we had earlier this year — that is, presuming a continu
ation of current regulatory policies. If regulatory policies
should change, which seems entirely likely given current
events in Washington, then indirect cost recovery at lower
levels is a distinct possibility.
In the meantime, dealing with current budget shortfalls
must be our first priority. Our short term objectives are:
• Reduce expenses as much as we can bear, and wherev
er we can.
• Limit disruption to Stanford's academic programs and
support services.
• Reduce hardship to individuals.
• Limit the amount of reserve funds we will need to
spend in order to stabilize the budget.
In order to provide for an orderly transition through this
difficult period to a new environment, the Board of Trustees
is willing to use financial reserves in a careful and limited
way. These funds will buffer the University somewhat from
the immediate budget shortfalls, at least until we can devel
op and implement our longer-range plans. However, even
the infusion of some reserves will not relieve the strain on
the budget nor the resulting pain it will inevitably cause to
people and programs at the University; and we must, of
course, be extremely cautious about the use of the Universi
ty's capital to solve short-run problems.
Actions To Be Taken in the Current Fiscal Year
I recognize that all operating budget units — both aca
demic and administrative — have had to tighten their belts
already this year; first with Repositioning cuts, and then
again with budget holdbacks last November. However,
given the seriousness of the situation we face today, we need
to make additional efforts to reduce expenses for the remain
der of the University's fiscal year, which ends on August
31st.
As a result, I will be working with deans, vice presidents,
and the school management group to implement the follow
ing actions:
Expense reductions in all units. I believe there is an
opportunity for further one-time reduction of
expenditures to achieve savings. I plan to meet
with each dean and vice president to discuss a spe
cific expense reduction target and to explore how
additional savings might be achieved. I do not
believe that layoffs will be required to achieve our
savings expectations in the current fiscal year,
apart from those remaining layoffs connected with
the Repositioning effort; however, delaying
replacements for vacant positions and reducing
non-salary expenditures will most likely be neces
sary.
— Limiting hiring. During the reminder of this year, we
will be filling only those positions critical to the
long-term health of the the University. Decisions
on such positions must be reviewed and approved
by the cognizant dean or vice president. I plan to
discuss this matter with all deans and vice presi
dents, and work with the new Vice President for
Human Resources to establish a better way to
monitor hiring.
— Reduction of capital expenditures. We have slowed
and delayed a number of facilities projects. We
have not, however, reduced any of our current
plans regarding the earthquake repair program.
— Slowing library acquisitions. We plan to slow the
rate of purchase of monographs in the libraries
over the remainder of the year.
— Use of Interest Earnings on Designated Funds.
Because we will be calling upon the University's
reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating
budget at their current levels. This means that
budget for such items as materials, services, and
travel will not be increased to account for price
inflation.
— A six month delay in implementation of the salary
program for both faculty and staff. We will rec
ommend the following salary program:
• The 1991-92 salary program will be implement
ed on March 1, 1992.
• For faculty, schools will receive base allocations that
will permit raises averaging 4%.
• For nonexempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
Non-exempt staff in the steps of the four
step range structure will remain eligible
to receive programmed increases begin
ning on March 1, 1992.
• For exempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined
by negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers on a
new agreement. The current three-year
agreement expires on August 31st; nego
tiations are expected to begin in the near
future.
— Additional one-time budget reductions and holdbacks.
In preparing their three year plans for next year, I
have asked deans and vice presidents to prepare
for a 2% holdback. We may need to ask for addi
tional reductions.
— Elimination of funding for innovation. As I
announced to the Senate earlier this year, there will
be no incremental funds set aside in next year's
budget for consolidations and improvements.
— Other Possibilities. The University Cabinet and Bud
get Group will be considering other alternative
measures for budget reduction next year, including
limits on hiring, reduced capital expenditures, and
other actions. We will do everything we can to
avoid layoffs related to this deficit reduction pro
gram in the next fiscal year.
The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid
eration by the University Cabinet and the larger University
community. Membership of the Committee includes facul
ty, administrators, and student representatives. The commit
tee has already begun to meet and will continue to work
through next year until it finishes its job in spring or summer
of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc
cess and good fortune is by design, and not accident. The
legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled
this institution in a mere 100 years to become one of the
leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will
emerge from this difficult episode leaner, yet strong and
vital, with an undiminished commitment and spirit to fulfill
our mission of research and teaching.
APPENDIX
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT BUDGET
REDUCTION ACTIONS
FOR THE 1990-91 ANI) 1991-92 FISCAL YEARS
What is the main point of the Provost's announcement?
The University is taking a series of actions to reduce this
year's and next year's budgets and therefore lessen the
impact of the reduced provisional (temporary) indirect cost
rate of 55.5% for federal grants and contracts at Stanford.
Unless we take action immediately, the lower rate translates
into an estimated $20 million shortfall for the current year,
and an estimated $30 million shortfall for the fiscal year

beginning September 1, 1991. The Medical School, which
operates on its own budget, is also facing shortfalls because
of the lower indirect cost rate.
Why do private research universities like Stanford rely on
the federal government for research funding?
The majority of research at Stanford, as well as at other
major universities, is paid for by the federal government as
part of the nation's overall plan to stay scientifically and
technologically competitive with the rest of the world.
Indeed, most of the country's basic research takes place only
within universities. This successful, productive research
partnership has existed since the end of World War II
Research funding is divided into two categories: direct costs
and indirect costs. Direct costs are those expenses that can
be attributed directly to specific research projects, such as
equipment, supplies, travel related to the project, and salaries
of faculty, students, and postdoctoral investigators involved.
Indirect costs are administrative and infrastructure costs that
support research but cannot be attributed directly to any one
project. These expenses include facilities and maintenance,
utilities, security and fire protection, libraries, payroll and
accounting, and other central and departmental administra
tive costs. Federal government policy makes it clear that
universities are entitled to recover their actual research costs,
including indirect costs.
I.ast year, the federal government funded $175.9 million lor
the direct costs of research it sponsored at Stanford, not
including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SI.AC).
Reimbursement for the indirect costs of federally sponsored
research totaled $84.4 million of Stanford's operating budget
last year, about 21% of the total.
Where will the budget cuts he made?
Between now and August 31, which is the end of the current
fiscal year, a variety of actions will be taken to reduce
expenses in all academic and administrative units, l or the
1991-92 fiscal year, which begins Sept. 1, further efforts will
be taken to reduce expenses, including a delay of six months
in the implementation of the salary program for both faculty
and staff. Deans, vice presidents, and directors, in consulta
tion with faculty and managers, will make specific decisions
regarding spending reduction in their own areas.
Will any programs he eliminated?
The focus of the immediate budget actions over the next If)
months is on reducing expenses within academic and admin
istrative programs, and not on eliminating programs them
selves.
Will salaries he affected?
The annual salary program for faculty and exempt and non
exempt staff, which normally takes effect on Sept. 1, will be
delayed for six months — that is, current faculty and staff
salaries will remain the same until March 1, 1902.
Detailed information on the salary program will be forth
coming from Human Resources.
How will these steps affect the wages of bargaining unit
employees?
The current three year agreement between Stanford and the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680, is scheduled to expire
on August 31. Negotiations are expected to begin in the
near future on a new agreement. Wage rates tor bargaining
unit staff after August 31 will be determined by these negoti
ations.
Will there be layoffs?
At this time, we do not anticipate layoffs related to this
deficit reduction program in the current fiscal year ending
August 31. Next year we will do all that we can to avoid
layoffs. Attrition, elimination of open positions, anil other
means will be considered first
How will these actions affect students?
The University has already made decisions about tuition for
next year — holding it to 1% above the expected rate ol
inflation, as was pledged last year. Stanford will also assure
that sufficient resources for student financial aid are avail
able at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
Why don't we use contributions from the successful Cen
tennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the Centennial Cam
paign already goes directly to the University's annual operat
ing budget. The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as building projects,
equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
and students — has begun to reevaluate the University's pn
orities. Over the next 12 months, the committee will be
developing specific proposals for permanently restructuring
Stanford's academic and supporting units. The Committee is
chaired by Provost Rossc; the deputy chair is Prof. Charles
Krugcr, who is chair of the Faculty Senate.
How will the University community be kept informed?
How can 1 get more specific information on how my unit
might be affected?
There will be an organized effort to keep people informed
over the coming weeks and months. Deans and vice presi
dents will be asked to communicate regularly on the details
of their own planning efforts with faculty and stall members
in their areas. In addition, updates on the situation will be
provided via employee mailings, electronic mail, and Cam
pus Report. For information on how the changes will affect
your unit, please contact your supervisor.

again with budget holdbacks last November. However,
given the seriousness of the situation we face today, we need
to make additional efforts to reduce expenses for the remain
der of the University's fiscal year, which ends on August
31st.
As a result, I will be working with deans, vice presidents,
and the school management group to implement the follow
ing actions:
Expense reductions in all units. I believe there is an
opportunity for further one-time reduction of
expenditures to achieve savings. I plan to meet
with each dean and vice president to discuss a spe
cific expense reduction target and to explore how
additional savings might be achieved. I do not
believe that layoffs will be required to achieve our
savings expectations in the current fiscal year,
apart from those remaining layoffs connected with
the Repositioning effort; however, delaying
replacements for vacant positions and reducing
non-salary expenditures will most likely be neces
sary.
— Limiting hiring. During the reminder of this year, we
will be filling only those positions critical to the
long-term health of the the University. Decisions
on such positions must be reviewed and approved
by the cognizant dean or vice president. I plan to
discuss this matter with all deans and vice presi
dents, and work with the new Vice President for
Human Resources to establish a better way to
monitor hiring.
— Reduction of capital expenditures. We have slowed
and delayed a number of facilities projects. We
have not, however, reduced any of our current
plans regarding the earthquake repair program.
— Slowing library acquisitions. We plan to slow the
rate of purchase of monographs in the libraries
over the remainder of the year.
— Use of Interest Earnings on Designated Funds.
Because we will be calling upon the University's
reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating
budget at their current levels. This means that
budget for such items as materials, services, and
travel will not be increased to account for price
inflation.
— A six month delay in implementation of the salary
program for both faculty and staff. We will rec
ommend the following salary program:
• The 1991-92 salary program will be implement
ed on March 1, 1992.
• For faculty, schools will receive base allocations that
will permit raises averaging 4%.
• For nonexempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
Non-exempt staff in the steps of the four
step range structure will remain eligible
to receive programmed increases begin
ning on March 1, 1992.
• For exempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined
by negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers on a
new agreement. The current three-year
agreement expires on August 31st; nego
tiations are expected to begin in the near
future.
— Additional one-time budget reductions and holdbacks.
In preparing their three year plans for next year, I
have asked deans and vice presidents to prepare
for a 2% holdback. We may need to ask for addi
tional reductions.
— Elimination of funding for innovation. As I
announced to the Senate earlier this year, there will
be no incremental funds set aside in next year's
budget for consolidations and improvements.
— Other Possibilities. The University Cabinet and Bud
get Group will be considering other alternative
measures for budget reduction next year, including
limits on hiring, reduced capital expenditures, and
other actions. We will do everything we can to
avoid layoffs related to this deficit reduction pro
gram in the next fiscal year.
The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid
eration by the University Cabinet and the larger University
community. Membership of the Committee includes facul
ty, administrators, and student representatives. The commit
tee has already begun to meet and will continue to work
through next year until it finishes its job in spring or summer
of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc
cess and good fortune is by design, and not accident. The
legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled
this institution in a mere 100 years to become one of the
leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will
emerge from this difficult episode leaner, yet strong and
vital, with an undiminished commitment and spirit to fulfill
our mission of research and teaching.
APPENDIX
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT BUDGET
REDUCTION ACTIONS
FOR THE 1990-91 ANI) 1991-92 FISCAL YEARS
What is the main point of the Provost's announcement?
The University is taking a series of actions to reduce this
year's and next year's budgets and therefore lessen the
impact of the reduced provisional (temporary) indirect cost
rate of 55.5% for federal grants and contracts at Stanford.
Unless we take action immediately, the lower rate translates
into an estimated $20 million shortfall for the current year,
and an estimated $30 million shortfall for the fiscal year

beginning September 1, 1991. The Medical School, which
operates on its own budget, is also facing shortfalls because
of the lower indirect cost rate.
Why do private research universities like Stanford rely on
the federal government for research funding?
The majority of research at Stanford, as well as at other
major universities, is paid for by the federal government as
part of the nation's overall plan to stay scientifically and
technologically competitive with the rest of the world.
Indeed, most of the country's basic research takes place only
within universities. This successful, productive research
partnership has existed since the end of World War II
Research funding is divided into two categories: direct costs
and indirect costs. Direct costs are those expenses that can
be attributed directly to specific research projects, such as
equipment, supplies, travel related to the project, and salaries
of faculty, students, and postdoctoral investigators involved.
Indirect costs are administrative and infrastructure costs that
support research but cannot be attributed directly to any one
project. These expenses include facilities and maintenance,
utilities, security and fire protection, libraries, payroll and
accounting, and other central and departmental administra
tive costs. Federal government policy makes it clear that
universities are entitled to recover their actual research costs,
including indirect costs.
I.ast year, the federal government funded $175.9 million lor
the direct costs of research it sponsored at Stanford, not
including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SI.AC).
Reimbursement for the indirect costs of federally sponsored
research totaled $84.4 million of Stanford's operating budget
last year, about 21% of the total.
Where will the budget cuts he made?
Between now and August 31, which is the end of the current
fiscal year, a variety of actions will be taken to reduce
expenses in all academic and administrative units, l or the
1991-92 fiscal year, which begins Sept. 1, further efforts will
be taken to reduce expenses, including a delay of six months
in the implementation of the salary program for both faculty
and staff. Deans, vice presidents, and directors, in consulta
tion with faculty and managers, will make specific decisions
regarding spending reduction in their own areas.
Will any programs he eliminated?
The focus of the immediate budget actions over the next If)
months is on reducing expenses within academic and admin
istrative programs, and not on eliminating programs them
selves.
Will salaries he affected?
The annual salary program for faculty and exempt and non
exempt staff, which normally takes effect on Sept. 1, will be
delayed for six months — that is, current faculty and staff
salaries will remain the same until March 1, 1902.
Detailed information on the salary program will be forth
coming from Human Resources.
How will these steps affect the wages of bargaining unit
employees?
The current three year agreement between Stanford and the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680, is scheduled to expire
on August 31. Negotiations are expected to begin in the
near future on a new agreement. Wage rates tor bargaining
unit staff after August 31 will be determined by these negoti
ations.
Will there be layoffs?
At this time, we do not anticipate layoffs related to this
deficit reduction program in the current fiscal year ending
August 31. Next year we will do all that we can to avoid
layoffs. Attrition, elimination of open positions, anil other
means will be considered first
How will these actions affect students?
The University has already made decisions about tuition for
next year — holding it to 1% above the expected rate ol
inflation, as was pledged last year. Stanford will also assure
that sufficient resources for student financial aid are avail
able at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
Why don't we use contributions from the successful Cen
tennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the Centennial Cam
paign already goes directly to the University's annual operat
ing budget. The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as building projects,
equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
and students — has begun to reevaluate the University's pn
orities. Over the next 12 months, the committee will be
developing specific proposals for permanently restructuring
Stanford's academic and supporting units. The Committee is
chaired by Provost Rossc; the deputy chair is Prof. Charles
Krugcr, who is chair of the Faculty Senate.
How will the University community be kept informed?
How can 1 get more specific information on how my unit
might be affected?
There will be an organized effort to keep people informed
over the coming weeks and months. Deans and vice presi
dents will be asked to communicate regularly on the details
of their own planning efforts with faculty and stall members
in their areas. In addition, updates on the situation will be
provided via employee mailings, electronic mail, and Cam
pus Report. For information on how the changes will affect
your unit, please contact your supervisor.

we can and will overcome. 1 will outline a series of

hi m Problems and Objectives
' me turn to an overview of the immediate future.

'Otis |, vcls, we view the government's action to
t 1 indirect cost rate to its present low level as a tem
" nation. Federal regulations make clear that univer
se entitled to recover their actual research costs,

mi necessary to establish our actual costs under new
>i wc do this, our billing rate can return to a more
MM level and we can make the showing needed to
1 !i out costs in year-end audits.
' Nation of the Memoranda of Understanding

will entail a great deal of work for Stanford as it must collect
different data and conduct new studies to establish its indi
rect costs under new standards. Until we can establish the
basis for a different rate, we will be operating under a provi
sional rate based essentially on a "default" method of calcu
lating costs — that is, Government regulations allow the
recovery of only a minimum amount of costs in the absence
of special studies and surveys that establish and allocate true
costs. This is somewhat akin to the standard deduction on
the federal income tax form. Stanford wants to itemize its
expenses rather than use the standard deduction, but at the
moment lacks documentation necessary to prove its true
costs.
We believe that discussions and special studies leading to
a new indirect cost rate can be completed before the end of
fiscal year 1992, thus enabling us to establish some part of
our real costs for that year. It is too soon to say what Stan
ford's rate will be upon completion of the special studies.
Preliminary calculations by Stanford's Controller and our
consultants from Arthur Andersen & Co. suggest an indirect
cost rate not greatly different from the provisional rate of
70% we had earlier this year — that is, presuming a continu
ation of current regulatory policies. If regulatory policies
should change, which seems entirely likely given current
events in Washington, then indirect cost recovery at lower
levels is a distinct possibility.
In the meantime, dealing with current budget shortfalls
must be our first priority. Our short term objectives are:
• Reduce expenses as much as we can bear, and wherev
er we can.
• Limit disruption to Stanford's academic programs and
support services.
• Reduce hardship to individuals.
• Limit the amount of reserve funds we will need to
spend in order to stabilize the budget.
In order to provide for an orderly transition through this
difficult period to a new environment, the Board of Trustees
is willing to use financial reserves in a careful and limited
way. These funds will buffer the University somewhat from
the immediate budget shortfalls, at least until we can devel
op and implement our longer-range plans. However, even
the infusion of some reserves will not relieve the strain on
the budget nor the resulting pain it will inevitably cause to
people and programs at the University; and we must, of
course, be extremely cautious about the use of the Universi
ty's capital to solve short-run problems.
Actions To Be Taken in the Current Fiscal Year
I recognize that all operating budget units — both aca
demic and administrative — have had to tighten their belts
already this year; first with Repositioning cuts, and then
again with budget holdbacks last November. However,
given the seriousness of the situation we face today, we need
to make additional efforts to reduce expenses for the remain
der of the University's fiscal year, which ends on August
31st.
As a result, I will be working with deans, vice presidents,
and the school management group to implement the follow
ing actions:
Expense reductions in all units. I believe there is an
opportunity for further one-time reduction of
expenditures to achieve savings. I plan to meet
with each dean and vice president to discuss a spe
cific expense reduction target and to explore how
additional savings might be achieved. I do not
believe that layoffs will be required to achieve our
savings expectations in the current fiscal year,
apart from those remaining layoffs connected with
the Repositioning effort; however, delaying
replacements for vacant positions and reducing
non-salary expenditures will most likely be neces
sary.
— Limiting hiring. During the reminder of this year, we
will be filling only those positions critical to the
long-term health of the the University. Decisions
on such positions must be reviewed and approved
by the cognizant dean or vice president. I plan to
discuss this matter with all deans and vice presi
dents, and work with the new Vice President for
Human Resources to establish a better way to
monitor hiring.
— Reduction of capital expenditures. We have slowed
and delayed a number of facilities projects. We
have not, however, reduced any of our current
plans regarding the earthquake repair program.
— Slowing library acquisitions. We plan to slow the
rate of purchase of monographs in the libraries
over the remainder of the year.
— Use of Interest Earnings on Designated Funds.
Because we will be calling upon the University's
reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating

• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined

The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid

of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc

legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled

leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will

our mission of research and teaching.

tion with faculty and managers, will make specific decisions
regarding spending reduction in their own areas.
Will any programs he eliminated?
The focus of the immediate budget actions over the next If)
months is on reducing expenses within academic and admin
istrative programs, and not on eliminating programs them
selves.
Will salaries he affected?
The annual salary program for faculty and exempt and non
exempt staff, which normally takes effect on Sept. 1, will be
delayed for six months — that is, current faculty and staff
salaries will remain the same until March 1, 1902.
Detailed information on the salary program will be forth
coming from Human Resources.
How will these steps affect the wages of bargaining unit
employees?
The current three year agreement between Stanford and the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680, is scheduled to expire
on August 31. Negotiations are expected to begin in the
near future on a new agreement. Wage rates tor bargaining
unit staff after August 31 will be determined by these negoti
ations.
Will there be layoffs?
At this time, we do not anticipate layoffs related to this
deficit reduction program in the current fiscal year ending
August 31. Next year we will do all that we can to avoid
layoffs. Attrition, elimination of open positions, anil other
means will be considered first
How will these actions affect students?
The University has already made decisions about tuition for
next year — holding it to 1% above the expected rate ol
inflation, as was pledged last year. Stanford will also assure
that sufficient resources for student financial aid are avail
able at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
Why don't we use contributions from the successful Cen
tennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the Centennial Cam
paign already goes directly to the University's annual operat
ing budget. The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as building projects,
equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
and students — has begun to reevaluate the University's pn
orities. Over the next 12 months, the committee will be
developing specific proposals for permanently restructuring
Stanford's academic and supporting units. The Committee is
chaired by Provost Rossc; the deputy chair is Prof. Charles
Krugcr, who is chair of the Faculty Senate.
How will the University community be kept informed?
How can 1 get more specific information on how my unit
might be affected?
There will be an organized effort to keep people informed
over the coming weeks and months. Deans and vice presi
dents will be asked to communicate regularly on the details
of their own planning efforts with faculty and stall members
in their areas. In addition, updates on the situation will be
provided via employee mailings, electronic mail, and Cam
pus Report. For information on how the changes will affect
your unit, please contact your supervisor.

we can and will overcome. 1 will outline a series of

I cblems will not be easy to fix. It is important to
i tween the short and long range problems.
hi m Problems and Objectives
' me turn to an overview of the immediate future.
• nigh we doubt that the indirect cost rate will return
'Otis |, vcls, we view the government's action to
t 1 indirect cost rate to its present low level as a tem
" nation. Federal regulations make clear that univer
se entitled to recover their actual research costs,
ling indirect costs. Although we have limited options
it term recovery, our first priority must be to do
mi necessary to establish our actual costs under new
>i wc do this, our billing rate can return to a more
MM level and we can make the showing needed to
1 !i out costs in year-end audits.
' Nation of the Memoranda of Understanding

will entail a great deal of work for Stanford as it must collect
different data and conduct new studies to establish its indi
rect costs under new standards. Until we can establish the
basis for a different rate, we will be operating under a provi
sional rate based essentially on a "default" method of calcu
lating costs — that is, Government regulations allow the
recovery of only a minimum amount of costs in the absence
of special studies and surveys that establish and allocate true
costs. This is somewhat akin to the standard deduction on
the federal income tax form. Stanford wants to itemize its
expenses rather than use the standard deduction, but at the
moment lacks documentation necessary to prove its true
costs.
We believe that discussions and special studies leading to
a new indirect cost rate can be completed before the end of
fiscal year 1992, thus enabling us to establish some part of
our real costs for that year. It is too soon to say what Stan
ford's rate will be upon completion of the special studies.
Preliminary calculations by Stanford's Controller and our
consultants from Arthur Andersen & Co. suggest an indirect
cost rate not greatly different from the provisional rate of
70% we had earlier this year — that is, presuming a continu
ation of current regulatory policies. If regulatory policies
should change, which seems entirely likely given current
events in Washington, then indirect cost recovery at lower
levels is a distinct possibility.
In the meantime, dealing with current budget shortfalls
must be our first priority. Our short term objectives are:
• Reduce expenses as much as we can bear, and wherev
er we can.
• Limit disruption to Stanford's academic programs and
support services.
• Reduce hardship to individuals.
• Limit the amount of reserve funds we will need to
spend in order to stabilize the budget.
In order to provide for an orderly transition through this
difficult period to a new environment, the Board of Trustees
is willing to use financial reserves in a careful and limited
way. These funds will buffer the University somewhat from
the immediate budget shortfalls, at least until we can devel
op and implement our longer-range plans. However, even
the infusion of some reserves will not relieve the strain on
the budget nor the resulting pain it will inevitably cause to
people and programs at the University; and we must, of
course, be extremely cautious about the use of the Universi
ty's capital to solve short-run problems.
Actions To Be Taken in the Current Fiscal Year
I recognize that all operating budget units — both aca
demic and administrative — have had to tighten their belts
already this year; first with Repositioning cuts, and then
again with budget holdbacks last November. However,
given the seriousness of the situation we face today, we need
to make additional efforts to reduce expenses for the remain
der of the University's fiscal year, which ends on August
31st.
As a result, I will be working with deans, vice presidents,
and the school management group to implement the follow
ing actions:
Expense reductions in all units. I believe there is an
opportunity for further one-time reduction of
expenditures to achieve savings. I plan to meet
with each dean and vice president to discuss a spe
cific expense reduction target and to explore how
additional savings might be achieved. I do not
believe that layoffs will be required to achieve our
savings expectations in the current fiscal year,
apart from those remaining layoffs connected with
the Repositioning effort; however, delaying
replacements for vacant positions and reducing
non-salary expenditures will most likely be neces
sary.
— Limiting hiring. During the reminder of this year, we
will be filling only those positions critical to the
long-term health of the the University. Decisions
on such positions must be reviewed and approved
by the cognizant dean or vice president. I plan to
discuss this matter with all deans and vice presi
dents, and work with the new Vice President for
Human Resources to establish a better way to
monitor hiring.
— Reduction of capital expenditures. We have slowed
and delayed a number of facilities projects. We
have not, however, reduced any of our current
plans regarding the earthquake repair program.
— Slowing library acquisitions. We plan to slow the
rate of purchase of monographs in the libraries
over the remainder of the year.
— Use of Interest Earnings on Designated Funds.
Because we will be calling upon the University's
reserve funds to cover deficits, we expect schools
and departments that have designated funds in
expendable funds pools will need to call upon
those reserves, as well. Consequently, we will
consider whether interest on part of these funds
should be devoted to overall deficit reduction.
Capturing year-end budget savings. The policy
which permits schools and administrative units to
retain their operating budget savings at year end
will be suspended in this year's budget so that the
one-time savings generated by these actions can be
used to reduce the University's budget shortfall.
I expect that these actions will result in approximately
$10 million in deficit reduction this year. The effect will be
to slow the progress of Stanford's programmatic efforts, but
they should not have long term deleterious impact. Even so,
these actions will not be sufficient to produce a balanced
budget; we will need to draw on resources by as much as
$10 million, and perhaps more.
Actions To Be Taken in the 1991-92 Fiscal Year
We will be taking proposed Operating Budget Guidelines
for the 1991-92 budget to the Senate and the Board of
Trustees in June. We have already made decisions about
tuition for next year — holding it to 1% above the expected
rate of inflation, as we pledged last year. We also must
assure sufficient resources for student financial aid at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Although a number

of other decisions have yet to be made, let me tell you what
has already been decided:
— Hold many non-salary components of the operating
budget at their current levels. This means that
budget for such items as materials, services, and
travel will not be increased to account for price
inflation.
— A six month delay in implementation of the salary
program for both faculty and staff. We will rec
ommend the following salary program:
• The 1991-92 salary program will be implement
ed on March 1, 1992.
• For faculty, schools will receive base allocations that
will permit raises averaging 4%.
• For nonexempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
Non-exempt staff in the steps of the four
step range structure will remain eligible
to receive programmed increases begin
ning on March 1, 1992.
• For exempt staff, merit raises will average 4%.
• For bargaining unit staff, wage rates will be determined
by negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers on a
new agreement. The current three-year
agreement expires on August 31st; nego
tiations are expected to begin in the near
future.
— Additional one-time budget reductions and holdbacks.
In preparing their three year plans for next year, I
have asked deans and vice presidents to prepare
for a 2% holdback. We may need to ask for addi
tional reductions.
— Elimination of funding for innovation. As I
announced to the Senate earlier this year, there will
be no incremental funds set aside in next year's
budget for consolidations and improvements.
— Other Possibilities. The University Cabinet and Bud
get Group will be considering other alternative
measures for budget reduction next year, including
limits on hiring, reduced capital expenditures, and
other actions. We will do everything we can to
avoid layoffs related to this deficit reduction pro
gram in the next fiscal year.
The combination of all of these actions, coupled with the
judicious use of reserve funds, will help us cover the expect
ed $30 million shortfall in next year's budget while urgent
longer-term planning for institutional adjustment takes place.
The Longer-Term Problems
Let us again briefly look at the longer-term issues and
problems. As I said earlier, we will continue to face deficits
in coming years unless we begin now to make careful, long
range plans that will change the scope and priorities of Stan
ford University in the future. The budgets for 1992-93 and
years beyond must be substantially reduced through perma
nent restructuring of academic priorities and a reorganization
of academic and supporting units. We must achieve bal
anced budgets in those years and still retain the impetus for
innovation that has given Stanford a leading role in
academia. The implications are clear: Stanford University
will have a diminished capacity in the future to continue all
the activities it has currently undertaken. But while some
opportunities will be lost, we can and must protect the essen
tial quality of the institution.
In order to move forward on these longer-term planning
issues, 1 recently announced the creation of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget anil Strategic Planning. Its mission
will be to reevaluate the priorities of Stanford in light of new
budget realities and to develop specific proposals for consid
eration by the University Cabinet and the larger University
community. Membership of the Committee includes facul
ty, administrators, and student representatives. The commit
tee has already begun to meet and will continue to work
through next year until it finishes its job in spring or summer
of 1992. Among the principles that will guide this process
are straightforward and frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of the effort, and
participation of faculty, students and staff in guiding the pro
cess.
In Conclusion
There is no question that Stanford faces challenging
times and tough choices. The financial problems facing the
University would be burdensome under any circumstances,
but they seem an especially cruel trick of fate in the year of
Stanford's Centennial. Yet there is no cause for pessimism.
It has been said that adversity is not without its comforts and
hopes. In our case, it is the knowledge that Stanford's suc
cess and good fortune is by design, and not accident. The
legacy of vision, determination, and drive bequeathed by the
founders to succeeding generations at Stanford has propelled
this institution in a mere 100 years to become one of the
leading universities of the world. It's an achievement that
never happened so quickly anywhere, at any time. These
same characteristics and values will now help us prevail over
obstacles in the way of our future.
It is my belief, and I hope it is yours, that Stanford will
emerge from this difficult episode leaner, yet strong and
vital, with an undiminished commitment and spirit to fulfill
our mission of research and teaching.
APPENDIX
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT BUDGET
REDUCTION ACTIONS
FOR THE 1990-91 ANI) 1991-92 FISCAL YEARS
What is the main point of the Provost's announcement?
The University is taking a series of actions to reduce this
year's and next year's budgets and therefore lessen the
impact of the reduced provisional (temporary) indirect cost
rate of 55.5% for federal grants and contracts at Stanford.
Unless we take action immediately, the lower rate translates
into an estimated $20 million shortfall for the current year,
and an estimated $30 million shortfall for the fiscal year

beginning September 1, 1991. The Medical School, which
operates on its own budget, is also facing shortfalls because
of the lower indirect cost rate.
Why do private research universities like Stanford rely on
the federal government for research funding?
The majority of research at Stanford, as well as at other
major universities, is paid for by the federal government as
part of the nation's overall plan to stay scientifically and
technologically competitive with the rest of the world.
Indeed, most of the country's basic research takes place only
within universities. This successful, productive research
partnership has existed since the end of World War II
Research funding is divided into two categories: direct costs
and indirect costs. Direct costs are those expenses that can
be attributed directly to specific research projects, such as
equipment, supplies, travel related to the project, and salaries
of faculty, students, and postdoctoral investigators involved.
Indirect costs are administrative and infrastructure costs that
support research but cannot be attributed directly to any one
project. These expenses include facilities and maintenance,
utilities, security and fire protection, libraries, payroll and
accounting, and other central and departmental administra
tive costs. Federal government policy makes it clear that
universities are entitled to recover their actual research costs,
including indirect costs.
I.ast year, the federal government funded $175.9 million lor
the direct costs of research it sponsored at Stanford, not
including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SI.AC).
Reimbursement for the indirect costs of federally sponsored
research totaled $84.4 million of Stanford's operating budget
last year, about 21% of the total.
Where will the budget cuts he made?
Between now and August 31, which is the end of the current
fiscal year, a variety of actions will be taken to reduce
expenses in all academic and administrative units, l or the
1991-92 fiscal year, which begins Sept. 1, further efforts will
be taken to reduce expenses, including a delay of six months
in the implementation of the salary program for both faculty
and staff. Deans, vice presidents, and directors, in consulta
tion with faculty and managers, will make specific decisions
regarding spending reduction in their own areas.
Will any programs he eliminated?
The focus of the immediate budget actions over the next If)
months is on reducing expenses within academic and admin
istrative programs, and not on eliminating programs them
selves.
Will salaries he affected?
The annual salary program for faculty and exempt and non
exempt staff, which normally takes effect on Sept. 1, will be
delayed for six months — that is, current faculty and staff
salaries will remain the same until March 1, 1902.
Detailed information on the salary program will be forth
coming from Human Resources.
How will these steps affect the wages of bargaining unit
employees?
The current three year agreement between Stanford and the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680, is scheduled to expire
on August 31. Negotiations are expected to begin in the
near future on a new agreement. Wage rates tor bargaining
unit staff after August 31 will be determined by these negoti
ations.
Will there be layoffs?
At this time, we do not anticipate layoffs related to this
deficit reduction program in the current fiscal year ending
August 31. Next year we will do all that we can to avoid
layoffs. Attrition, elimination of open positions, anil other
means will be considered first
How will these actions affect students?
The University has already made decisions about tuition for
next year — holding it to 1% above the expected rate ol
inflation, as was pledged last year. Stanford will also assure
that sufficient resources for student financial aid are avail
able at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.

equipment, and endowment funds.
What about the longer-term budget concerns?
In addition to the current budget shortfalls caused by the
lower indirect cost rate, the University will continue to face
deficits in the future unless it makes changes in its priorities.
In order to plan for reduced budgets in the fiscal years 1992-
93 and beyond, a new Cabinet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning — composed of faculty, administrators,
