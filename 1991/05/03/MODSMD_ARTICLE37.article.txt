## Hat, home court lead Cardinal against UW, Cal 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Dick Gould isn't superstitious.
He just believes in repetition.
The coach of the three-time
defending national champion
men's tennis team wears a floppy
blue western-style hat — one side
folded up, one side down — during
every home and NCAA contest.
The result?
Forty-plus consecutive home
victories, and three NCAA titles.
Until April 11, 1990.
On that day California defeated
the Cardinal at the Stanford Ten
nis Stadium, 5-4. Since then,
Gould has continued to wear "The
Hat", but with both sides folded
up. And Stanford has not lost at
home — or at the national finals.
Gould is hoping "The Hat,"
and Stanford's great play of late,
continues the streak this weekend
when the Golden Bears make
their first appearance on the Farm
since that fateful day.
But it's not only last year's
home loss that should have the
Cardinal riled up for its last dual
match of the season. Cal soundly
defeated Stanford the first time
the two met this year. Although
the final score was 5-4, the Bears
took three singles matches in
straight sets and four of the six
singles contests last month across
the Bay. It was Stanford's third
consecutive Pac-10 loss, and it

dropped the team to No. 5 in the
Volvo Tennis/Intercollegiate rank
ings.
The Cardinal is looking to con
tinue building momentum for the
rapidly approaching NCAA tour
nament, but also has a bit of
revenge in mind.
"It should be a great match, a
good climax to the season," Gould
said. "[And] we didn't like losing
to them — at home or at Berke
ley."
Before Stanford has a chance to
get back at those Dirty Golden
Bears, however, it has to face
Washington this afternoon.
And Gould is a bit worried his
talented squad may overlook the
unranked but able Huskies.
"Washington is pretty good —
they're a lot like a Fresno State,
talent-wise," Gould said. "If we
don't have our minds in the match
we could struggle. [But] if every
one plays close to their capacity
we should be fine."
The Cardinal should have the
advantage — over both oppo
nents. It is flying high from an
impressive victory at the Pac-10
individual championships last
weekend. Not only did Stanford
players take both the singles and
doubles titles, but its eight com
petitors won the same number of
matches as did USC, UCLA and
Cal combined.
And prior to its league shellack
ing, the Cardinal creamed both

the Trojans and the Bruins — the
nation's No. 1 and 2 squads.
Stanford, however, does have to
use its past success to its advan
tage.
"It could work both ways,"
Gould cautioned. "We can either
let down — we could take a breath
and let someone catch us, or we
can use it as a springboard.
"It would be very easy to let
down right now — we're coming
off some great wins and [the team
is] already thinking about nation
als. But no one has really caught
us in a letdown match this year."
If the Cardinal doesn't let down
— which it shouldn't — expect a
great match Saturday. The cross-

After a strong showing at the Pac-10 Championships last week, Vimal Patel and the Stanford Cardinal
are primed for the NCAA Championships. Before that, however, the team meets Washington and Cali
fornia at the Stanford Tennis Stadium today and tomorrow.
