# Mastalir relaxing his way to NCAAs
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Mark Mastalir is having an
extraordinary year.
A month ago he ran the
fastest mile of his life, less than
a second from the four-minute
barrier. Three weeks ago he
finished a 1,500-meter race
with a time of 3:41.3.
With that nearly perfect run
Mastalir got the hat trick: qual
ifying for the NCAA Champi
onships, U.S. Olympic Trials
and The Athletic Congress
(TAC) national championships.
At last Saturday's Big Meet,
after a round of golf the day
before, he ran a 1,500-meter
3:43 "in his sleep," according to
teammate Alex Accetta.
As this season has gone
Mastalir can afford to be low
key before a meet. In fact, his
relaxed approach is a part of
his success.
"Just at my house before I
go down (to the track) I try to
be as low-key as possible. I read
the New York Times. I listen to
Frank Sinatra. Seriously, I love
Frank. I just sit there and mel
low out," Mastalir said.
Once he gets to Stanford
Stadium, he's all business. If
you're running against him,
Mastalir wants you to be in
pain.
"My fitness level is great
enough that I can go out and
try to make other people hurt
as much as possible, just try to
make their pain threshold too
high so that they don't want to
buy into that," he said.
Which is exactly what hap
pened at Big Meet. Reggie
Williams, the California run
ner, wanted a slow race but
Mastalir pushed the pace and
began his kick at 500 meters
out. Williams did, too.
"But the thing is he didn't
want to at 500. I thought he
might throw the cards in and
he didn't, but at 300 meters he
did," Mastalir said.
"It's a classic thing. Every
one thinks that they're faster,
they have more leg speed than
the guv next to them. No one
wants to work hard enough to
punish themselves.
"They'd rather go through
in 3:10 for three laps and just
try to kick as hard as they can
than go through in 2:57 and try
to hang on because it hurts a
hell of a lot more to go in 2:57."
He plans to push the pace at
the NCAA Championships at
Oregon in a month. There he
will have to run a qualifying
heat to make the finals, which
Mastalir expects to do.
"In the finals, so I stay clear
of traffic, set myself up in lane
two so I don't get on the rail
and get boxed in. With 600
meters to go just start shifting
gears every 100 meters, picking
up a little bit more.
"Run a good last lap, hit full
speed pretty much. At worst I
figure I'll be All-American. At
best I'd like to win," he said.
But before NCAAs Mastalir

has to do some speed work to
get his leg turnover rate higher
and he has some planning to
do. This summer Mastalir
hopes to travel around Europe,
getting more racing experience.
"It's difficult because
there's not really much for col
legiate runners. You're kind of
in limbo," he said.
Mastalir, however, is good
enough and has the right con
tacts to prabably get a shoe
contract and compete overseas.
While he's there he'll be in
select company. Joining him
are Ray Brown, a four-time
TAG indoor 800 meters cham-

ple hurt as much as
possible.'

pion; Matt Guisto, a former
NCAA 5,000 meters champion;
and Jeff Atkinson, Stanford
grad and an Olympian in the
1,500 meters.
"No one would have thought
[Atkinson] would make the
Olympic team, let alone win
the (Olympic) Trials. He's a
mortal man. We work out with
him every day. I realize well,
heck, if 1 want to be as dedi
cated as he is I can maybe do
the same thing," Mastalir said.
Of course he wasn't always
expected to fulfill such lofty
goals. Freshman year was a dif
ficult transition period for him
and critics had been quick to
point out that Eric, Mark's
twin brother and teammate,
was running better than Mark
was. Last year Eric placed 11th
in the 1,500 at the NCAA
Championships.
The comparisons, however,
don't bother Mark. "Every
thing Eric's been able to do in
the past I've been able to do. It
keeps you going at times.
"If I listened to my harshest
critics here for the first couple
of years, that I wasn't running
as well as people expected me
to run, I would have quit a long
time ago. But I always saw the
big picture and said, 'If you
stick with it you'll get back on
top again.' I never gave up and
finally I am," he said.
Mastalir has found the top
to be to his liking, especially
the rewards that come with
being an NCAA contender.
This weekend the men's track
team travels to Oregon to face
the Ducks.
Hut Mastalir will be here,
preparing for NCAAs and play
ing golf.
"I wish I had more time to
play. We only play about once a
week. 1 guess I'm not too disap
pointed about going to Oregon
because that means I can get
out (on the links) twice this
week," Mastalir said.

might throw the cards in and
he didn't, but at 300 meters he
did," Mastalir said.
"It's a classic thing. Every
one thinks that they're faster,
they have more leg speed than
the guv next to them. No one
wants to work hard enough to
punish themselves.
"They'd rather go through
in 3:10 for three laps and just
try to kick as hard as they can
than go through in 2:57 and try
to hang on because it hurts a
hell of a lot more to go in 2:57."
He plans to push the pace at
the NCAA Championships at
Oregon in a month. There he
will have to run a qualifying
heat to make the finals, which
Mastalir expects to do.
"In the finals, so I stay clear
of traffic, set myself up in lane
two so I don't get on the rail
and get boxed in. With 600
meters to go just start shifting
gears every 100 meters, picking
up a little bit more.
"Run a good last lap, hit full
speed pretty much. At worst I
figure I'll be All-American. At
best I'd like to win," he said.
But before NCAAs Mastalir

has to do some speed work to
get his leg turnover rate higher
and he has some planning to
do. This summer Mastalir
hopes to travel around Europe,
getting more racing experience.
"It's difficult because
there's not really much for col
legiate runners. You're kind of
in limbo," he said.
Mastalir, however, is good
enough and has the right con
tacts to prabably get a shoe
contract and compete overseas.
While he's there he'll be in
select company. Joining him
are Ray Brown, a four-time
TAG indoor 800 meters cham-

great enough that I
can go out and try
to make other peo
ple hurt as much as
possible.'

pion; Matt Guisto, a former
NCAA 5,000 meters champion;
and Jeff Atkinson, Stanford
grad and an Olympian in the
1,500 meters.
"No one would have thought
[Atkinson] would make the
Olympic team, let alone win
the (Olympic) Trials. He's a
mortal man. We work out with
him every day. I realize well,
heck, if 1 want to be as dedi
cated as he is I can maybe do
the same thing," Mastalir said.
Of course he wasn't always
expected to fulfill such lofty
goals. Freshman year was a dif
ficult transition period for him
and critics had been quick to
point out that Eric, Mark's
twin brother and teammate,
was running better than Mark
was. Last year Eric placed 11th
in the 1,500 at the NCAA
Championships.
The comparisons, however,
don't bother Mark. "Every
thing Eric's been able to do in
the past I've been able to do. It
keeps you going at times.
"If I listened to my harshest
critics here for the first couple
of years, that I wasn't running
as well as people expected me
to run, I would have quit a long
time ago. But I always saw the
big picture and said, 'If you
stick with it you'll get back on
top again.' I never gave up and
finally I am," he said.
Mastalir has found the top
to be to his liking, especially
the rewards that come with
being an NCAA contender.
This weekend the men's track
team travels to Oregon to face
the Ducks.
Hut Mastalir will be here,
preparing for NCAAs and play
ing golf.
"I wish I had more time to
play. We only play about once a
week. 1 guess I'm not too disap
pointed about going to Oregon
because that means I can get
out (on the links) twice this
week," Mastalir said.
Mark Mastalir is having an
extraordinary year.
A month ago he ran the
fastest mile of his life, less than
a second from the four-minute
barrier. Three weeks ago he
finished a 1,500-meter race
with a time of 3:41.3.
With that nearly perfect run
Mastalir got the hat trick: qual
ifying for the NCAA Champi
onships, U.S. Olympic Trials
and The Athletic Congress
(TAC) national championships.
At last Saturday's Big Meet,
after a round of golf the day
before, he ran a 1,500-meter
3:43 "in his sleep," according to
teammate Alex Accetta.
As this season has gone
Mastalir can afford to be low
key before a meet. In fact, his
relaxed approach is a part of
his success.
"Just at my house before I
go down (to the track) I try to
be as low-key as possible. I read
the New York Times. I listen to
Frank Sinatra. Seriously, I love
Frank. I just sit there and mel
low out," Mastalir said.
Once he gets to Stanford
Stadium, he's all business. If
you're running against him,
Mastalir wants you to be in
pain.
"My fitness level is great
enough that I can go out and
try to make other people hurt
as much as possible, just try to
make their pain threshold too
high so that they don't want to
buy into that," he said.
Which is exactly what hap
pened at Big Meet. Reggie
Williams, the California run
ner, wanted a slow race but
Mastalir pushed the pace and
began his kick at 500 meters
out. Williams did, too.
"But the thing is he didn't
want to at 500. I thought he
might throw the cards in and
he didn't, but at 300 meters he
did," Mastalir said.
"It's a classic thing. Every

the guv next to them. No one
