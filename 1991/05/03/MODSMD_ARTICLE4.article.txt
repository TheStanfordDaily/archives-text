# Causes of homosexuality
## Experts, gays cite genetics, individual choice 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Just 20 years ago homosexuality was
still considered a disease by the American
Psychiatric Association.
In 1973, that classification was dropped
by the association, but the bias against
homosexuality still lingers in society — a
bias that many experts think relates to the
public's lack of understanding about the
origin of a person's sexual orientation.
"The issue of choice is always asked,"
said Ann Davidson, board member of the
Peninsula chapter of Parents and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays. "Hut 1 don't think it
is a choice — being gay is a discovery, it's an

awareness. Gay people discover that they
are attracted to people of the same sex."
Her husband, Physiology Prof. Julian
Davidson, agreed. "It's something that
occurs in the body of the person — they
don't just say, 'I want to be gay.' It happens,
and it has to happen — it is organic," he
said.
One bisexual student, senior Sairus
Patel, accepted that interpretation, but
argued that the development of sexual ori
entation should still leave room for free
choice.
"I do believe that [sexual orientation)
cannot be changed to a significant degree,
and that it has been established at
a young age," Patel said. "But I
only agree with that to a point,
because I believe sexuality should
be freely chosen."
The debate over the develop
ment of sexual orientation has lit
tle scientific basis. The issue has
not been studied in detail, Julian
Davidson said. He added that he is
unaware of any research at Stan
ford on the subject, and "would be
surprised if there were any."
Studies of the causes of homo
sexuality have been on shaky sci
entific ground, said Asst. Psychol
ogy Prof. Laura Carstensen.

Most of them have centered on
the "genetic underpinnings of
homosexuality," Carstensen said.
Some evidence of genetic causes
has been found in men, although
she said the studies have not been
conclusive.
One reason the causes of
homosexuality have not been
studied in detail, she added, is
because such research seems
inherently biased — no one
researches the causes of hetero
sexuality.
"It's kind of like asking why
some people have blue eyes and
some have brown," Carstensen
said. "A more interesting question
is why people are so phobic about
it."

That is a very interesting ques
tion to Ann Davidson, whose
group operates a local informa
tion telephone line and organizes
support groups for families and
friends of gay and lesbian people.
She said she thinks homopho
bia results from people's accep
tance of the many false myths
about homosexuality. "People are
afraid that gays want to molest
and recruit other people — espe
cially children," she said. "They
find sexual activity between peo
ple of the same sex disgusting and
unnatural. They are afraid it will
break down the family system."
But all of those fears are
"based on ignorance, fear, stereo
types and misconceptions," she
said, adding that another reason
for homophobia is people's insecu
rity with their own heterosexual
ity. "They are afraid of their own
same-sex attractions, and they
feel threatened by that," David
son said.
Parents usually have difficulty
accepting gay children, she said.
"I went through a stage in coming
to accept my son, asking, 'Why is
my child gay?' Every parent asks,
'Why is my child gay? What did I
do?' But the question is not
answerable — it's pointless."
A more helpful attitude, David
son said, is to "determine the sup
port that a gay person needs,"
rather than merely trying to
assess the causes of his or her
homosexuality.
That support is necessary, she
said, because gays are faced with a
bewildering range of difficult deci
sions to make, most of them
caused by our homophobic society.
A gay person, Davidson said,
"faces many choices — will I act
upon it? Will I pretend to be
straight? Will I be in or out of the
closet?"
Despite the homophobia that is
still prevalent, Julian Davidson
thinks the attitude toward gays
has become more accepting and
open. "I think it's getting better,"
he said. "There has been a vast
improvement in certain states. In
California, it's definitely getting
better."
