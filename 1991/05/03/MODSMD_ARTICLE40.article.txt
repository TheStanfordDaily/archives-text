# Sepeda finds consistency, victories
## 
### David Schwartz Staff writer 
Foundation. Every pitching
staff needs it. For the Stanford
Cardinal, one need look no further
than Jamie Sepeda.
"I worked on a change-up
which has really helped my game
a lot. It's helped me get some big
outs," Sepeda said.
Those big outs have added up
to some big victories. Sepeda's
record stands at six wins with only
one loss. He has a 3.34 earned run
average.
Said coach Mark Marquess, "I
think Jamie Sepeda has pitched
extremely well for us. He's one of
our most effective pitchers now at
the tail end of the season, and 1
think he had three or four more
games which he would've won . . .
[but] we lost the lead for him after
he'd left the game. He's just had a
great year for us."
During his freshman season a
year ago, Sepeda started off
strong before going into a dry
spell, and finished the year with a
3-0 record, recording eight saves
after being delegated to a relief
role. This year, the right-hander
experienced a similar turn of
events, but managed to pull him
self out of the "sophomore
slump."
"Early on in the season I was
doing well and then I kind of fell
off again, just like last year when I
started as the third starter,"
Sepeda said. "I just fell off and
went in a kind of slump, but this
year I've been able to pick it back
up. I've been working hard and
I've been able to get back in the
starting rotation, and that's

where I want to be."
As a starter, he is perfect
against Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division opponents,
with three wins in six appear
ances. Tuesday, he pitched four
innings in Stanford's 6-4 non-con
ference victory against St. Mary's,
giving up one run and three hits.
What makes Sepeda such a
force on the mound is his ability to
mix pitches, and this is an area
which he has greatly improved
upon.
"I think the keys to his
improvement are the fact that
he's able to get more pitches over
the plate consistently," com
mented Marquess. "He has better
command of his curveball — he
throws it for strikes, and the
change-up is a real big pitch for
him. Last year he had those
pitches but he didn't have the
command of them, he couldn't
throw them for strikes. But right
now he can throw any one of the
three pitches — the fastball, the
curve, or the change — for a strike
at any time."
Sepeda's pitching philosophy is
simple and effective: be confident
in yourself and your teammates,
and you will be victorious. "1
really don't think the other team
can hurt you if you don't hurt
yourself. Sure you're going to
have your bad days when the
other team just crushes you and
stuff, but most of the time if you
throw strikes, and with our
defense and offense, you're going
to win most of your games here."
There was little doubt that
when Sepeda came to Stanford, he
would become an integral part of
the pitching staff. The Sinton,
Texas, native reaped accolades at
the end of his high school career.
He was named the Texas Baseball
Player of the Year in both 1987
and 1988, and garnered High
School All-America honors from
Baseball America following his
senior year. He also was recog
nized at the end of his senior sea
son as one of the top 15 prep play
ers of the vear bv Collegiate Base
ball.
Most improtantly, Sepeda is a
great competitor, and that trans

lates into victories. This has not
escaped Marquess. "He has a good
attitude. He's real team oriented;
he's willing to pitch on short rest.
His biggest quality is that he's
real competitive. He likes to go
out and compete and win. That's
one of the keys to his success."

Sepeda was drafted by the
Chicago Cubs in the 14th round of
the June 1989 professional base
ball draft, but opted instead to
come to the Farm. "School has
been great and I'm glad that I did
decide to go to Stanford. It's really
opened my eyes to a lot of things.
I really don't think I was ready
athletically or maturity-wise to
start my professional career.
Hopefully this will help."

throw them for strikes. But right
now he can throw any one of the
three pitches — the fastball, the
curve, or the change — for a strike
at any time."
Sepeda's pitching philosophy is
simple and effective: be confident
in yourself and your teammates,
and you will be victorious. "1
really don't think the other team
can hurt you if you don't hurt
yourself. Sure you're going to
have your bad days when the
other team just crushes you and
stuff, but most of the time if you
throw strikes, and with our
defense and offense, you're going
to win most of your games here."
There was little doubt that
when Sepeda came to Stanford, he
would become an integral part of
the pitching staff. The Sinton,
Texas, native reaped accolades at
the end of his high school career.
He was named the Texas Baseball
Player of the Year in both 1987
and 1988, and garnered High

he's willing to pitch on short rest.
His biggest quality is that he's
real competitive. He likes to go
out and compete and win. That's
one of the keys to his success."

Sepeda was drafted by the
Chicago Cubs in the 14th round of
the June 1989 professional base
ball draft, but opted instead to
come to the Farm. "School has
been great and I'm glad that I did
decide to go to Stanford. It's really
opened my eyes to a lot of things.
I really don't think I was ready
athletically or maturity-wise to
start my professional career.
Hopefully this will help."
