# Men's golf team hosts nation's best
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's golf team is getting
accustomed to adversity.
Last weekend in the Brigham Young
Cougar Classic, the Cardinal took a novel
course in blizzards as they gritted their teeth
and played consistently through snow, wind
and delays.
"Nothing can be as bad as that tournament
was," said sophomore Dave Rutkowski. "But it
was good for us."
Today the linksters begin a crash course in
endurance that will last until Sunday. For the
first time ever, the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship will be 72 holes, not the cus
tomary 54 holes.
"The cream eventually comes to the top
after 72 holes," said Cardinal coach Wally
Goodwin. "Even though we haven't played
that much golf yet this year, we just look at the
extra 18 holes as just another day Physical fit
ness will be very important in the last nine

holes on Saturday and in the final 18 on Sun
day."
The Pac-10 field will be playing 18 holes
today, 36 tomorrow and 18 Sunday, the final
day.
But the Cardinal has home-course advan
tage on its side. In its last tourney at home, the
U.S. Intercollegiate, the Cardinal used its
familiarity to its advantage in upstaging top
ranked Arizona State and No. 7 USC.
"I think that playing on our course will
even things up," said Goodwin. "We know the
course better than any other team and we can
get on cruise control and be very tough to beat.
"The only tough thing about playing on our
home course is the expectations. The expecta
tions here at Stanford are high and they drive
us to great heights, but in golf so much luck is
involved that hopes can mean nothing "
Junior Christian Cevaer, who won the
Cougar Classic last weekend, will lead the Car
dinal at the top spot. Coming off that hot vic
tory, Cevaer is looking to challenge for the Pac
-10 title outright, something he did two years

ago as a freshman.
Freshman Notah Begay will play No. 2 fol
lowed by sophomores Rutkowski and Brad
Lanning. Casey Martin, a freshman, and
senior Johan Remmelgas will round out the
play-six, count-five field.
"It's my last tournament and 1 have moti
vation to do well," said Remmelgas. "Christian
wants to win it; I'll be more moderate and say
that I want to have a few decent rounds so that
I can be in contention on the last day."
"If Johan can contribute a few times, we
can really shoot a low score," said Rutkowski
"He'll be an added bonus."
But the Cardinal will have its hands full
with second-ranked Arizona. Arizona literally
ran away with the U.S. Intercollegiate title
when it shot a 54-hole Stanford Golf Course
record of 861, 17 strokes ahead of the Cardi
nal.
"Arizona has made a remarkable sweep
towards the top of college golf since January,"
said Goodwin. "They're tough
from top to bottom â€” but that
isn't to say that we can't beat
them."
And the Wildcats were not able
to count their best score in the
tournament. Michael Berganio
won the tournament as an indi
vidual, but did not play as one of
Arizona's top five players. It
seems that Arizona learned a les
son: Berganio will be playing No.
2 for the Wildcats.
Although the Cardinal beat up

on Arizona State and USC for the
first time this season in the U.S.
Intercollegiate, Goodwin knows
that both will be "powerhouses."
Arizona State's top player, Phil
Mickelson, did not make an
appearance at the U.S. Intercolle
giate because he was playing in
the Masters in Augusta, Ga.
For 17 years the Pac-10 title
has eluded the Cardinal, but
Goodwin and his young players
are not too concerned with his
tory.
"In terms of the NCAA this is
just another tournament," he
said. "But it would be nice to have
bragging rights."
