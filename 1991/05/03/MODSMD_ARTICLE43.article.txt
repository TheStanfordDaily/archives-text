# Former 'sleeper' wakes up
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Jane Austen's version of
Emma Woodhouse was a meddle
some, immature child. She was
mortified by her own silliness,
befriended a love-child and even
went so far as to arrange a mar
riage between the love-child and
the man of her dreams.
Eventually, "Emma" extricates
herself from this mess, marries
Knightley, the man she loved but
tried to give away, and lives hap
pily ever after.
Though Stanford's Emma
Woodhouse was named for the lit
erary character, she could hardly
be more different. Born Sept. 7,
1973, the 17-year-old freshman is
quite mature despite being among
the youngest of Stanford stu
dents. And her youth hasn't
stopped her from making an
impact on the women's tennis
program here.
Woodhouse was not a No. 1
recruit like Debbie Graham or
Sandra Birch, so her arrival at
Stanford was relatively unher
alded. This is not a story of a
superstar tennis player who goes
to college; it is a story of a college
student who happens to play ten

nis well.
"She was the sleeper of the
recruits in the country last year,"
coach Frank Brennan says. He
found out about Woodhouse rela
tively late in the process and did
not know too much about what
she could do on the tennis court,
but pursued her anyway. "She had
the grades and the interest (in
Stanford). Two out of three ain't
bad."
"Three," of course, is playing
ability — something Brennan has
discovered that Woodhouse isn't
lacking in. Though she was only
ranked around 30th in the 16-
and-under juniors, Woodhouse
has a good deal of natural talent
and has shown what Brennan
calls "dramatic improvement"
this season.
He surmises that because
Woodhouse was just 16 a year ago,
many coaches didn't even realize
she was a high school senior. Suf
fice it to say they're regretting
that oversight now.
"She really had a lot to learn;
but she's learned a lot," Brennan
continues.
Woodhouse seconds the notion.
In describing her first year of col
lege, she says,"The most difficult
thing is to organize your time.

There are so many opportunities
to do a lot of different things."
Aside from playing tennis five
or more days each week, and keep
ing up with her schoolwork,
Woodhouse has a plate full of
extracurricular items. "I have a
little sister . . . that takes up
time," she says."I just joined a
sorority . . . that takes up time."
Woodhouse recently pledged
Kappa Kappa Gamma.
"You have to balance it out and
try to do your best at everything."
As far as tennis goes, Wood
house is doing very well, thank
you. Last week, in the invitational
tournament at the Pacific 10 Con
ference championships, Wood
house not only was a participant
— she won the event.
It was a rare opportunity for
her to show off her singles game
since Woodhouse has spent the
season primarily as a doubles spe
cialist. Brennan loved what he
saw. "I'm really on a high now
with Emma Woodhouse because
she did so well last week," he says.
"She played well and competed
well. She showed me she's tough."
Looking ahead to the future,
Brennan can envision Woodhouse

Despite not being considered a big-time recruit coming out of high school, Emma Woodhouse has
quickly made her mark on the Farm. She and Heather Widens have been very successful at No. 3 dou
bles leading into the NCAA Championships, which begin here next Wednesday.
