# Crew teams tune up for Pac-10 meet
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
This weekend, the Cardinal
men's and women's crew teams
will be rowing their boats down
the last stretch of the regular
season. The women will be host
ing their final dual meet against
UC-Davis on Saturday at Red
wood Shores, while the men will
head south for the Newport
Regatta this Sunday.
For both teams, these races
will represent the final chance
for fine-tuning before the Pacific
10 Conference Championships,
which will be held May 18-19 in
Sacramento.
In fact, it might be easy for
the women's team to consider
this weekend's competition
insignificant in comparison to
the challenges ahead. UC-Davis
has yet to beat Stanford, and is
not traditionally known as a
rowing powerhouse. However,
coach John Davis is not taking

anything for granted.
"This is a big event for Davis
because a win against us could
make their season. The standard
strategy for a small school racing
a Big Four school (like Stanford)
is to really throw the kitchen
sink at us since they have noth
ing to lose. We have to anticipate
that and prepare for it by being
flexible, and we need to concen
trate on rowing our boats the
way we want to row them," he
explained.
The best match-up will proba
bly occur in the varsity four-per
son boat race. UC-Davis' nation
ally competitive lightweight
eight will be split in order to cre
ate a powerful four-person boat.
The Cardinal four, however, has
been equally strqng, only suffer
ing its first loss of the season last
weekend against California.
Sophomore coxswain Mickie
Shen characterized the race as
"a good gauge for how we're
doing going into Pac-lOs," where

the boat would like to cap off an
outstanding season with a vic
tory
After weathering a 7 1/2-hour
van ride to Southern California,
the men's crew will be facing a
field of 10 schools, including top
competitors UCLA, UC-Santa
Barbara, USC and UC-San
Diego. Coming off a disappoint
ing loss to Cal last week, the
Cardinal will try to rebuild its
confidence by attacking the Bru
ins, who placed third in the
National Championship regatta
last year.
"UCLA has always been a big
rowing power. They've won the
Pac-10 Championships two out
of the past three years, and they
beat Cal by three to four seconds
a couple of weeks ago. If our var
sity boat wins (this weekend), it
will be a great thing," Stanford
team captain Tom Beischer said.
According to men's coach
Wieslaw Kujda, a win is defi
nitely within the Cardinal's

r ach. "We just basically want to
start strong and hold on to the
fastest boat. We'll give UCLA a
good race and try to win from
the very first stroke," he said.
In addition, the regatta will
allow Kujda to test the success of
his most recent changes in the
lineup of the varsity eight. In the
lead seat will be junior Greg
Klingsporn, who did not stroke
the boat against Cal last week.
In addition, junior Peter Guar
raia will be rowing in the varsity
boat for the first time.
The challenge for the junior
varsity team will come from
Orange Coast College, a junior
college with one of the best JV
rowing programs in the country.
"Racing against OCC will give
the boat a good idea of where
they are," Beischer said. "We're
looking at this regatta as
another step towards Pac-lOs,
and our main goal will be to
achieve a faster speed than we
had in the Cal race last week."
