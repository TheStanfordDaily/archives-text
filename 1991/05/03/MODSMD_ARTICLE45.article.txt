# Events commemorate Cinco de Mayo holiday
## 
### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
The Stanford celebration of
Cinco de Mayo kicks off this week
end, with events ranging from
fiestas to a band performance to
an alumni conference.
The activities will be the high
lights of a month-long celebration
of Mexican-American culture.
Cinco de Mayo, which falls on
Sunday, May 5, commemorates
the Battle of Puebla, a Mexican
victory over Napoleon Ill's army
in the 1860s. Junior Bill Cande
laria, who works at El Centro Chi
cano, said the festival is a more
important holiday for Mexican-
Americans than it is in Mexico,
where Mexican Independence Day
on September 16 is emphasized
more.
The battle was part of a war
known in Mexico as the War of
French Intervention. The French
eventually succeeded in placing a
French emperor in Mexico, but
"what happened at Puebla gave
hope to a lot of Mexicans," Cande
laria said.
Because the battle represented
victory by a small group, "the
underdog," it is especially impor
tant to Chicanos living in the
United States, he said.
Senior Lore Barron, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, said "Mexico has
always had a history of being con
quered." In contrast to that his
tory, Cinco de Mayo is "an expres
sion of freedom," she said.
Candelaria called the holiday a
"symbol of courage and hope,"
and said it encourages Mexican-
Americans "to have faith and
determination, and let them set
goals."
Sponsors for the events include
MEChA, El Centro Chicano, Casa
Zapata and various other organi
zations.

Cinco de Mayo will also feature
the annual Cinco de Mayo Fiesta
at Casa Zapata and a bilingual
mass in Kresge Auditorium.
The fiesta will include dance
performances by Ballet Folklorico
de Stanford, mariachi music and a
Mexican food dinner.
Ballet Folklorico will perform
dances from two regions of Mex
ico, Jalisco and Colima, Cande
laria said.
He said the dances from the
Jalisco region are "what people
think of when they think ol Mexi
can dance," while the Colima
dances are less widely known.
Both reflect the mixed influences
of Native American and Spanish
dance, he said.
This afternoon, Polly Baca,
executive director of the Colorado
Institute for Hispanic Education
and Economic Development and a
former Colorado state senator,
will speak at 4 p.m. in the History
Corner. The lecture is a Stanford
Centennial multicultural event.
In addition, at 9 p.m. tonight,
Dr. Loco and his Rockin' Jalapeno
Band, a group of Chicano musi
cians, will perform at Burnham
Pavilion.
Tomorrow's events include a
Stanford Chicano Alumni Confer
ence, a Teatro Xicano de Stanford
improvisational performance at
Zapata and a Cinco de Mayo Cele
bration, also at Zapata.
Other events throughout the
month include performances by
El Grupo Cultural Zero, a theatri
cal group from Mexico, by Ballet
Folklorico and by the band
Enrique Ramirez and His Trio; an
art exhibit of selected works by
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony Bur
ciaga; a poetry reading; a lecture
by John Beverly of the University
of Pittsburgh; and a panel discus
sion on "Re-envisioning Chicano
Studies."
