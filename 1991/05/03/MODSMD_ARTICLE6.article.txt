# Land rezoned to allow for new building
## 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld 
A University plan to rezone a saxophone-shaped
chunk of Stanford land to accommodate a new psy
chiatry center and possible expansion of the Medical
Center received preliminary approval yesterday.
The proposal, addressed in a meeting of the Santa
Clara County Planning Commission, requested zon
ing changes for three sites located across Quarry
Road from the Stanford Medical Center and the
Stanford Shopping Center. The planning commis
sion's recommendation must still be approved by the
Board of Supervisors.
The decision gives the University the go-ahead to
submit further development proposals for the psy
chiatric center and other buildings to the planning
commission.
"It came out exactly the way it
would," said Phil Williams, directoi of planning for
the University.
Most of the land was previously designated as
"study area," requiring that development proposals
be examined by the county, Palo Alto and Stanford.
The commission, meeting in San Jose, voted 4 to
1 to recommend that the three University lots total
ing 22.5 acres be rezoned in accordance with the
University's proposal.
One of the parcels, known as the Campus Drive
site, is a continuation of the Arboretum and will be
preserved as open space. The new psychiatry center
will be built on the adjacent "triangle site."
The third lot, the "rectangle site" may be used for
further Medical Center expansion.
"We have no specific facility planned for the rect
angle site," Williams said, "but we're pleased it's des
ignated for Medical Center uses."
A number of issues caused confusion and some
controversy while planning com
mission members wrangled with
the proper wording for their rec
ommendations.
Most of the concern came from
the fear that development might
cause additional need for housing
and added traffic.
But the commission decided
that the benefits provided to the
public by the expansion of the
Medical center and the psychi
atric facility, and the University's
good record on traffic and hous
ing issues, were enough to coun
terbalance any adverse effects of
development.
The final environmental
impact report had found that in
the worst case, building "could
result in a gross demand for over
1,000 housing units."
The report asked that the Uni
versity conduct a study to Find
possible locations for 155 addi
tional housing units.
In a letter to the commission,
Palo Alto Mayor Jack Sutorius
asked that the rectangle site be
designated as a residential area
where the occupancy of the units
would be limited to people affili
ated with the University.
But Williams said housing
shortage is a premature worry.
"As far as we know our needs
won't catch up with what we're
planning in the immediate
future," he said.
Williams also described the
efforts made by the University to
provide housing on campus.
"Since 1960 we have built
4,622 new units," Williams said.
There are also 1,326 units under
construction or in planning.
Dolores Furman, a resident of
Menlo Park, spoke in front of the
commission before it discussed
the Stanford issue.
"I find great (environmental)
abuse on the part of Stanford,"
she said.
Leland Stanford "didn't want
his farm to become commercial
and industrial," she concluded.
