# ASSU debates counting of ballots from D.C.
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Drugs, discrimination and late election votes
headlined the topics debated at last night's ASSU
Senate meeting.
The senate certified the election results from the
spring general election despite an attempt by senator
David Brown to include the late votes from students
at Stanford in Washington.
The elections commission neglected to send bal
lots to the Washington program before the April 17-
18 election was held, and the senate forced the com
mission to fax ballots to students there after election
results were announced. But the ballots were not
faxed back to the ASSU until Monday afternoon,
nearly 24 hours after the Sunday 7 p.m. deadline.
The Stanford in Washington ballots could have
affected the outcome of several senate races. The
most important was for the 10th voting position, in
which Hammer and Coffin senator-elect Raphe Beck
led People's Platform senator-elect Virginia Rosas by
only two votes.
Hearings officer Jason Moore ruled that the bal
lots could not be counted because the bylaws
expressly state that all votes included in the results
must be counted by no later than four days before
certification. The bylaws also state that "no excep
tions shall be made," Moore said. According to the
the bylaws, certification must take place at the first
senate meeting after the election is validated.
But Brown attempted to convince the senate that
it was "fair and right to interpret this ambiguous
time line" in a manner that would allow the votes to
be counted to prevent the "disenfranchisement of

voters."
The senate failed to achieve
the necessary two-thirds mtyority
to overturn Moore's decision and
count the ballots.
"I'm glad to see that they
finally followed the bylaws,"
Moore said.
The senate also passed a reso
lution calling on the University to
reinstate Computer Science
Senior Lecturer Stuart Reges and
finish the investigation of his
actions in a timely manner. The
motion says the senate "deplores
the use of federal research funds
as a political tool to coerce univer
sities into enforcing federal poli
cies."
Reges has recently made
national headlines after he was
placed on paid administrative
leave pending an investigation of
his claims that he violated Uni
versity drug and alcohol policy.
The senate's action is an
attempt to "protect free speech
and show the dissatisfaction of
the ASSU with the government's
attempt to stifle free speech by
threatening to withhold federal
funds," said graduate senator
James Vera, a co-author of the
bill.
Financial manager Torrence
Boone presented the initial 1991-
92 ASSU operating budget. He
also announced the selection of
Friday Classic Flicks as the new
business project and said a pro
posal for a CD and cassette
exchange will be studied further.
In other action, the senate
again debated a bill to dissolve all
ties with the United States Stu
dent Association because of its
allegedly discriminatory affirma
tive action policy.
But after much debate and a
series of political maneuvers, the
senate voted to send the bill back
to committee to possibly establish
a task force that would assess the
policy and recommend changes to
the national association.
