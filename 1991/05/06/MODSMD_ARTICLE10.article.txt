# Panels explore multiculturalism

"Why do so many students
cringe at the 'M' word?" asked
graduate student Carrie Bramen
yesterday.
"Multiculturalism and Institu
tions," a three-day conference this
weekend organized by students in
the Modern Thought and Litera
ture program, attempted to
answer that question.
Graduate students from 14
universities gathered in the Histo
ry Corner to address, among other
things, the media's portrayal of
multiculturalism and the hesitan
cy of institutions to implement
multicultural change.
"We wanted to partake in a
self-critique of multiculturalism,"

said Bramen, who helped organize
the event.
In "Borderlands of Citizen
ship," a panel discussion yester
day, participants attacked the fed
eral government's double stan
dard of immigration, which they
said favors Europeans over Mexi
cans and Central Americans.
Bramen, a panel member, said
the portrayal of illegal aliens today
is a far cry from that of the hon
est, hardworking European immi
grant, which Ellis Island and pop
ular myth symbolize. That myth,
Bramen said, implicitly ties the
immigrant to the American ideal
of class mobility.
Martha Otis, another graduate
student, linked the acceptance of
the European immigrant with
assimilation into American cul

ture. Early immigrants were
accepted because they were simply
more willing to be Americans, to
buy into the ideal of social mobili
ty, than today's immigrants from
Third World countries, she said.
English graduate student Ben
Saenz commented on the recent
treatment of aliens from Mexico
by U.S. officials. Those attempt
ing to cross the border illegally
often had property seized and
have been denied due process of
law, he said.
The conference on immigration
was only one of a series of panels
that attempted to clarify the goals
of multiculturalism.
"In general, we're saying we
need to go farther, and that may
be entirely unpopular," said Bra
men.
