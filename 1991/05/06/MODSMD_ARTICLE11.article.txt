# Brooks encourages black actors
## Former TV star tells thespians to tight business' stereotypes 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
For nearly three years actor Avery Brooks played
Hawk, a street-wise, say-it-in-your-face quasi-pri
vate investigator on television's "Spenser for Hire."
In a Friday speech, Brooks, exuding the powerful
presence of his television character, encouraged
blacks to pursue their dreams in acting and other
vocations despite the racism and ignorance they may
encounter.
"You have to hold on," Brooks intoned in a rich,
clarion baritone. "You have to overcome that which
holds you down."
"I challenge you to require the world to include
you," he added.
Brooks' Memorial Auditorium speech — a
tapestry of anecdotes, powerful prose and readings
from authors such as James Baldwin — served as
the keynote address for the first Bay Area College
and University Black Theater Conference.
The conference focused on the dearth of black
people in theater and touched on the casting of peo
ple of color in traditionally white roles. Conference
activities were also held at San Francisco State Uni
versity Saturday and yesterday.
More than 150 students and community members
from the Bay Area gathered to listen to Brook's
speech, a message which touched on the experiences
of its messenger.
Brooks — also an accomplished director, musician
and teacher — hurdled racial barriers in becoming
an acclaimed thespian.
He appeared recently in the lead role of Shake
speare's "Othello" at the world-renowned Folger
Shakespeare Theater in Washington, D.C. He has
also appeared in other Shakespearean productions.
Brooks juggled his career in the theater with tele
vision roles. He co-starred in "Spenser for Hire"
with Robert Urich, and later starred in a spin-off
series, "A Man Called Hawk."

Despite these successes, the actor was almost
turned away by a tide of racism.
After appearing in a 1969 play while attending
Oberlin College, Brooks received a letter from a pro
fessor who questioned the casting of a black actor in
the role of a white character.
In response to his performance as Othello in the
recent Folger production, a Rutgers university pro
fessor wrote that blacks should not play Othello
because the character was meant to be Arab, Brooks
recalled.
Brooks said, "Things are very much the same
today. Racism exists. The genius is here I among
black actors and actresses), the talent is abundant,
the desire to succeed exists . . . but the opportunity
for us to contribute is scarce."
"There is not enough commitment to keeping and
training black actors and actresses, and black stu
dents are seldom given the chance to have a role wor
thy of their tuition, time and talent," Brooks said.
The actor called for the infusion of more black
professors in schools with drama departments and
the recognition of the multi-racial diversity of the
ater.
But even when blacks are given an opportunity
for entrance and advancement in the acting industry,
additional barriers exist. Brooks recalled his con
frontations with white producers who wanted to por
tray blacks in stereotyped images in "A Man Called
Hawk"
"They told me my job was just to hit my mark and
say my lines."
Brooks did. He also infused the cultural reality of
black culture and people into the character Hawk, a
contemporary, mythological urban black hero, he
said. "I decided I was going to make up the lines
use lines that were real and representative," Brooks
said.
"I refuse to betray the dignity of my people," he
said. "Art is divine, and the artist's responsibility is
to his people."
