Israel willing to swap prisoners
for hostages, missing soldiers
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said yesterday
it was willing to release the Lebanese prisoners
it holds for the Western hostages in Lebanon —
if Israel's missing soldiers were included in the
deal.
The announcement came one day after Ira
nian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati called
for the release of the 13 Western hostages in
Lebanon "as soon as possible," along with pris
oners held by Israel.
There are 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon
— six Americans, four Britons, two Germans
and an Italian. Most are believed held by pro-
Iranian Shiite factions.
The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
More winds head for Bangladesh
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Forecasters
yesterday predicted winds approaching cyclone
strength for Bangladesh's storm-devastated
coast.
Steady rain and inadequate transport upset
distribution of relief supplies yesterday to the
estimated 10 million people displaced from the
cyclone, and relief officials and physicians said
"secondary deaths" may start occurring soon in
remote islands still awaiting aid.
As time began to run out for refugees with
out shelter or food, relief officials criticized the
government for not coming up with a specific
relief plan.
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's 6-week-old
government has denied the charge of inepti
tude, saying the job at hand is enormous.
