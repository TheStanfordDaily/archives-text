BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — President Bush contin
ued to experience an irregular heartbeat yesterday
and his spokesman said doctors may administer an
electrical shock treatment today during which presi
dential power would be shifted to Vice President Dan
Quayle.
Marlin Fitzwater said doctors at Bethesda Naval
Hospital would consider the shock procedure if Bush
did not respond adequately to medication overnight.
He called the procedure routine and said it carried
minimal risk.
The shock will "erase the heart's rhythm and let
it restart, hopefully with a normal rhythm," said car
diologist Jonathan Halperin of Mt. Sinai Medical
Center in New York.
The 66-year-old Bush was evacuated from Camp
David after suffering fatigue and shortness of breath
while jogging on Saturday. He was diagnosed as hav
ing atrial fibrillation, a fast, irregular heart rhythm.
"We want to assure the American people that the
president is in a healthy condition. He has not suf
fered a heart attack. He has not suffered heart mus
cle damage," Fitzwater said yesterday evening in a
nationally televised briefing.
Trying to curtail any alarm about Bush's condi
tion, the White House projected an air of business as
usual. Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, went to the hospital to brief Bush
on global developments. "The world hasn't stopped,"
Scowcroft told reporters, holding aloft a satchel of
briefing papers.
Fitzwater said doctors hoped Bush's heartbeat
would return to normal under medication during the
night. If not, they will decide early today whether to
try the shock procedure, known as electrical car
dioversion.
Fitzwater described it as "a single application of
direct electrical current to the heart — one very
quick jolt."
He said Bush would have to be under a general
anesthesia during the treatment but might be
sedated only a few minutes. During that period,
Quayle would be acting president under provisions
of the 25th Amendment.
"The risk is minimal particularly in a patient such
as the president who has no demonstrable heart dis
ease," Fitzwater said. "During the short time that
the president would be under anesthesia, the vice
president would be acting president under the 25th
Amendment."
