Students First has to
restore long-needed
efficacy to the ASSU

NOW THAT "STUDENTS
First" has won the race for
Council of Presidents, it is
time to make some meaningful
changes in the ASSU.
An almost 2-1 margin of victory
over "Stand and Deliver" shows
that voters desire the changes
promised by Students First.
But for COP members-elect
John Louie, Beth Morgan, John
Overdeck and Benny Sandoval, liv
ing up to that promise will present
a challenge far more imposing than
the election ever posed.
The slate is taking leadership at
a time when student confidence in
the ASSU is at an appalling low; in
a recent poll, fewer than 11 percent
of students said the ASSU is
responsive to their needs.
Students First made account
ability to students the central issue
of this year's election — and they
will have to do much to live up to
that promise.
Next year's COP should dedi
cate itself to gauging student opin
ion by visiting dorms and groups,
answering questions about the
ASSU and asking some of its own.
Students must be convinced
that their government wants to be
accountable all year — not just the
month before elections.
Another factor that led to a Stu
dents First victory was its promise
to provide an array of student ser
vices. In the past few years, candi
dates for COP have made dozens of
such promises: a revived course
guide, an improved airport shuttle,
better food service and affordable,
high-quality health and child care.
Little has been accomplished.

This year, above all others, will
require creative problem solving.
Facing a $50 million deficit over
the next two years, Stanford's
administration may prove reluc
tant, or unable, to accommodate all
student needs.
By contrast, the ASSU has vast
reserve funds. Students First
should put more ASSU resources
at the disposal of students.
In particular, the COP-elect
could make a difference in address
ing the problem of sexual assault at
Stanford.
In its platform, Students First
pledged to lobby the University to
hire a sexual assault coordinator.
However, given the University's
budget constraint, little may be
accomplished unless the ASSU
does something itself.
The COP could create a new sex
ual assault office with counseling
and legal advice for survivors of
sexual assault. It must also get var
ious campus groups to assist in
addressing this problem.
Although the University must
assume responsibility in the long
run, such action by the ASSU
would meet a tremendous need
which the University is likely to
ignore in the short run.
Finally, Students First must
implement multiculturalism in a
meaningful and positive way. The
ASSU should facilitate discussion
between members of Stanford's
communities, with the objective of
integrating everyone into the
larger Stanford community.
One method for accomplishing
that goal would be to host another
Leadership Summit. With its new
definition of multiculturalism, this
year's summit was widely hailed as
a step toward positive change.
Students First has its work cut
out. Next year could be another
year of failed promises and ASSU
inefficacy. It could also be an excit
ing year in which credibility and
efficacy are finally restored.
