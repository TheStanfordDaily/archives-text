Stanford shouldn't cut faculty salaries to balance budget

lAM DISMAYED BY PROVOST
James Rosse's announcement that
part of the deficit for this and next
year will be met by cutting the salaries of
faculty and staff.
Rosse has announced that salary
increases will be 2 percent for 1991-92,
half the minimal expectation of 4 per
cent, and 2 or 3 percent less than infla
tion, representing a real reduction in pay.
I can barely think about the impact on
morale that this reduction in faculty
salaries will have. I have already heard
many outcries of dismay and anger.
In an understatement of enormous
magnitude, Rosse says, "It's not a solu-

tion that will please everybody, I'm
sure."
Rosse's announcement leaves many
questions unanswered, and answers to
those questions must be forthcoming, in
fairness to the Stanford community.
Is it really necessary to cut salaries to
save "roughly $5 million" if, as Rosse
stated, the University has $12 million in
discretionary reserves and roughly
another $100 million that can be used
upon approval by the Board of trustees?
Is that figure of $100 million a potential
increase in the pay-out on income from
the endowment? If that is the case,
should we be satisfied by the trustees'
willingness, as Rosse put it, to use finan

cial reserves only in a "careful and lim
ited" way?
Using endowment income to offset
the budget shortfall, a bolder change
than that contemplated by the Trustees,
seems the obvious alternative to cuts in
faculty salaries.
The trustees have been extremely
conservative in their approach to endow
ment income, putting about half of it
back into the endowment as a hedge
against inflation and, I would have
thought, crises like the present one.
Now is the time to re-examine the size
of that "hedge." There is still time to
change course before the June meeting
of the Trustees.

If Rosse sticks with his proposal, the
people who help make Stanford what he
calls "one of the leading universities of
the world" will bear the brunt of the con
sequences of years of mismanagement by
University President Donald Kennedy,
Chief Financial Officer William Massy
and others.
Like the inept handling of the recent
Congressional hearings, that misman
agement has resulted from an arrogance
about Stanford's invulnerability. Faculty
and staff should not have to pay the
price of that arrogance.
