# New cost hearing planned
## Stanford not called to testify Thursday 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Rep. John Dingell, who lam
basted Stanford's indirect-cost
practices during a seven-hour
hearing in March, will have more
to say on the subject later this
week.
The powerful Michigan Demo
crat's House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations has
scheduled another hearing Thurs
day to examine how universities
charge the government for indi
rect costs of federally sponsored
research.
Unlike the March hearing,
Stanford officials have not been
called upon to testify.
"Most of the focus will be on
other schools," a subcommittee
staff member said, "but I don't see
how you can have an indirect-cost
hearing without Stanford's name
coming up."
At least two Stanford-related
issues are expected to surface, the
subcommittee staffer said:
• The Navy's recent decision to
lower Stanford's indirect-cost rate
to 55.5 percent, and
• Allegations by federal audi
tors that Stanford is continuing to
block access to University records.
In March, Fred Newton of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency
testified before Dingell that Stan
ford officials had not been cooper
ative in the auditing process. At a
hearing held last month by the
House Science Subcommittee,
Newton said the situation had not
improved.
Stanford officials say they are
troubled by the allegations.
"It's a matter of concern to us,"
said Larry llorton, associate vice
president for public affairs. "We
are endeavoring to cooperate."
Horton said he believes the
problem has to do with the large
volume of requests auditors have
made during the course of the
investigations. Stanford and
Defense Contract Audit Agency
officials have met several times
regarding the matter, he added.
"We hope that there has been
some progress," he said.
The majority of Thursday's
hearing will be devoted to discus
sion of what federal agencies can
do to prevent problems like those
brought to light at Stanford by the
subcommittee.
Those who have been invited to

testify are:
• Rear Adm. William Miller, the
chief of naval research. The Office
of Naval Research is the govern
ment agency responsible for nego
tiating the indirect-cost rate at
Stanford and 39 other universi
ties.
• Newton, deputy director of
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency. Newton's agency is
responsible for auditing the indi
rect-cost claims from Stanford
and all other universities overseen
by the Office of Naval Research.
• Gary Talesnik, director of the
Department of Health and
Human Service's Office of Grant

and Contract Financial Manage
ment. Health and Human Ser
vices plays an oversight role at
hundreds of universities nation
wide similar to the role played by
the Office of Naval Research at
Stanford.
• Richard Kusserow, the
inspector general of Health and
Human Services.
The indirect-cost recovery
practices of MIT, Caltech and
Dartmouth, Yale, Cornell and
Duke Universities will also be dis
cussed Thursday, the subcommit
tee staff member said. The prelim
inary results of audits at those
schools are expected to be made
public, she added.
