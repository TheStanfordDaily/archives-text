# New cost hearing planned
## Stanford not called to testify Thursday 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Rep. John Dingell, who lam
basted Stanford's indirect-cost
practices during a seven-hour
hearing in March, will have more
to say on the subject later this
week.
The powerful Michigan Demo
crat's House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations has
scheduled another hearing Thurs
day to examine how universities
charge the government for indi
rect costs of federally sponsored
research.
Unlike the March hearing,
Stanford officials have not been
called upon to testify.
"Most of the focus will be on
other schools," a subcommittee
staff member said, "but I don't see
how you can have an indirect-cost
hearing without Stanford's name
coming up."
At least two Stanford-related
issues are expected to surface, the
subcommittee staffer said:
• The Navy's recent decision to
lower Stanford's indirect-cost rate
to 55.5 percent, and
• Allegations by federal audi
tors that Stanford is continuing to
block access to University records.
In March, Fred Newton of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency
testified before Dingell that Stan
ford officials had not been cooper
ative in the auditing process. At a
hearing held last month by the
House Science Subcommittee,
Newton said the situation had not
improved.
Stanford officials say they are
troubled by the allegations.
"It's a matter of concern to us,"
said Larry llorton, associate vice
president for public affairs. "We
are endeavoring to cooperate."
Horton said he believes the
problem has to do with the large
volume of requests auditors have
