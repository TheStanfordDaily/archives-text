# Kennedy should stand up for the University's right to autonomy
## 
### 
In a day where government control is
escalating and threatening Stanford's
open community, University President
Donald Kennedy and his administration
have responded weakly to the challenge
that Stuart Reges has stirred up.
Reges' suspension has raised the issue
of government's role and power in soci
ety. How can the people in Washington,
D.C. possibly know more about what is
best for Stanford University?
That is why the suspension of Reges
incenses me. Reges is the only person
brave enough to declare war upon this
trend of government intervention in Uni
versity decisions.
If we give in now, what is to stop the
government from imposing on us the
rest of their straitjacketed policies? After
all, we have already given ground in
terms of our alcohol policy. Are we in
favor of police-dog resident assistants?

Are we in favor of demerits? Are we in
favor of the American government mak
ing our decisions for us? I for one will
not stand by and let a free, open and
understanding community like Stan
ford's be demolished.
On a typical University of California
campus, the RAs give demerits to people
seen drinking or committing "fouls," and
a person with a certain number of
demerits will be removed from housing.
Although academic learning is occurring
at these campuses, other types of learn
ing are stifled by pervasive fear. The fact
that Stanford treats well-informed peo
ple with respect and allows them to make
informed personal decisions is what
makes Stanford's community exemplary.
President Kennedy, we need you to
stand up for our autonomy. Stanford is
an honest, open community resulting
from a combination of good education
and personal freedom. It is time to rise to
the occasion, to bravely stand up to the
government and to defy it as an example
to other universities.
With the support of other universities,
we can force the government to value
outstanding education for all, and with

it, personal freedom. President Kennedy,
take a positive stand and tell the federal
government that its intervention in
Stanford's affairs stops today.
