# KZSU fears the FCC, not the social message, behind hardcore rap
## 
### 
Delia Ibarra suggested in her column
Thursday that radio DJs "fear" hardcore
rap and "refuse to give it air time." Allow
me to ruffle some old charts.
Last year, Public Enemy's "Fear of a
Black Planet" was the most played
record on KZSU. Boogie Down Produc
tions' "Ghetto Music: the Blueprint of
Hip-hop" was in our top five in 1989. Ice
Cube, Movement Ex, Brand Nubian, Ice
T, Paris, Poor Righteous Teachers, King
Sun — all hardcore rap groups, all were
played on KZSU and all charted.
In fact, college DJs prefer the more

non-mainstream rap, and pride them
selves on their taste.
Ibarra says that "campus disc jockeys"
refuse to play "Fuck tha Police" but play
plenty of early 2 Live Crew. Take the
case of KZSU. I am often having prob
lems with people playing the first record,
and 1 don't think we even have the sec
ond.
Why is it a problem to play "Fuck tha
Police" on the radio? Is it too full of
"social commentary," as Ibarra suggests?
No. If a single person listening made a
complaint to the FCC, we could lose our
license. If this happened, KZSU would be
out of business, because there is no way
we could pay for the appeal process.
KZSU is not "safe" radio, but we are
legal radio.
These corrections aside, Ibarra's col
umn was OK. Now, if she can explain
why Eazy E, the lead rapper for NWA,
has joined the Republican Inner Circle —
if indeed hardcore rap is the voice of the
"angry underclass" and "a reaction to
the Reagan era" — we'll be all set.
