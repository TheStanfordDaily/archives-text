## Red ink runs deep

THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION
to knock Stanford's indirect cost
rate from 70 percent to 55.5 per
cent has put the University in a world of
financial hurt — a $50 million world of
hurt, to be precise.
Unfortunately, the University's stop
gap responses to the problem may make
the long-term situation even worse, as
the University's recent financial woes
have consistently proven too great for the
measures taken to stop the flow of red
ink.
In the past three years, Provost James
Rosse has made several separate
announcements about the University's
large projected budget deficits. Several
rounds of budget cuts have occurred,
including last year's $22 million reposi
tioning effort, but the red ink still flows.
Add to that the massive cost of repairing
last year's earthquake damage, and it
may be a while before the University gets
out of its financial mess.
The University's budget situation is
starting to sound like the California
drought, which has seemingly been
around for hundreds of years yet every
season seems to take us by surprise.
Maybe it's time for us to realize that
years with low rainfall and high operating
costs are the rule, not the exception. It's
time to apply long-term solutions to
tackle the long-term problems.
Every dollar of Centennial fund rais
ing is like another raindrop in "Lake"
Lagunita, something to get excited about
but nothing to alleviate the real problem
at hand.
Responding to the direct costs of the

indirect-cost controversy, Rosse and Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy have
emphasized their intention to maintain
the high quality of a Stanford education
and to avoid staff layoffs "at all costs."
The decision to channel funds from the
University's enormous endowment to
make up for deficits in this year's and
next year's operating budgets sounds
simple and easy, but much tougher deci
sions loom ahead.
University officials have made clear
their assumption that the indirect-cost
problems are temporary. The last two
times University officials used the term
"temporary," they stuck the campus with
Manzanita Park and quake "modulars"
for classrooms.
Given the federal government's own
budget "shortfalls," it is probably not
realistic for Stanford to assume a smooth
level of research funding"over the next 10
years. The research volume itself will
probably decrease, and the indirect cost
rate will not likely rise back up to Stan
ford's original 78 percent, especially if the
government imposes further restrictions
on indirect-cost recovery.
Many of us support the Stanford mis
sion and love the spirit embodied by the
University, but the torch will lose its
flame if tough financial planning deci
sions are not made soon. Those decisions
will not and cannot be made without con
troversy, without layoffs and without
pain.
As the University administration is
wont to do, Rosse announced the creation
of a new Cabinet Committee on Budget
and Strategic Planning to make most of

the tough financial decisions. The task
force has 16 months to complete its mis
sion, before the 1992-93 fiscal year begins
in September 1992.
If that mission includes pleasing every
body on this campus, it will surely be a
mission impossible. But if that mission
emphasizes the needs of the University's
whole over its parts, the mission will have
a chance at being accomplished.
Rosse's proposed 2 percent, across
the-board cuts in each school's or admin
istrative unit's 1991-92 budget must not
set a precedent for the Cabinet Commit
tee to follow. Across-the-board cuts have
the danger of watering down every Uni
versity department to the point where
none of them can compete in the Ameri
can university market.
Instead, the Cabinet committee must
set new priorities to carry the University
into its second century. Programs or
departments may need to be cut alto
gether. Sacrifices will have to be made.
The University must admit that it can't
be the best in everything, if it intends to
remain the best in anything.
