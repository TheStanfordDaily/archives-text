## Bear trap Men's tennis demolishes California 8-1 in final preparation for the NCAA Championships 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
The Big Red Machine is racing, throttle
to the floor, all signals indicating invincibil

No matter what the men's tennis team
does during the regular season, when the
national championships draw near Dick
Gould's squad enters a higher dimension. It
took the final step last weekend.

Men's Tennis

Cardinal 8, Huskies 1
Cardinal 8, Golden Bears 1

The Cardinal decimated both Washing
ton Friday and No. 6 California Saturday,
bringing its season record to 19-4 in its
final tune-up for next week's national team
tournament. A fourth-consecutive national
title is looking like a strong possibility.
The wave is cresting, ready to wash over
the competition in Athens, Ga. Again. Stan
ford's victories brought its streak to seven
— six of which were clinched in singles play.
College tennis world — look out!
"Our reputation speaks for itself when it
comes to Athens," said John Whitlinger,
Stanford's assistant coach. "The guys are
on a roll now. They have a lot of confidence.
It seems like we're right where we should
be.
"The Big Red Machine is going to try to
keep rolling."
While Stanford's convincing victories
will not give it the No. 1 seeding at NCAAs
due to its two losses to USC during the sea
son — one at the National Team Indoors
and the other in Pac-10 play — it should be
top four. And the Cardinal will definitely be
ahead of conference rival Cal.
Saturday's win was sweet revenge for
the Cardinal. The Bears handed the squad
humility last month with a defeat that
almost ended in singles. A second victory
would have given Cal the fourth and final
top spot in Georgia. Now Stanford has the
advantage.
But the loss across the Bay may have
been exactly what Stanford needed at the
time.
"When we lost there it made it three in a
row, and coach [Gould] said, 'Let the season
start here,' " sophomore phenom Jonathan
Stark said. "We've played very well since
then — beating USC, UCLA and Cal in sin
gles and putting up a real good showing at
Pac-10's.
"We're ready to play"

It looked like it was going to be two in a
row for the Bears, however. Two years that
is. California ended Stanford's 40-match
home winning streak last season, and, after
an hour of play, it appeared that the Bears
were once again going to be the first team of
the season to down the Cardinal at Stan
ford.
Top singles player Alex O'Brien had been
demolished by Bent Ove Pedersen 6-0 in
the first set, Jared Palmer had been downed
by Carl Chang 6-3, and three Cardinal com
petitors were down early in their second
sets.
It was right then, however, that Stanford
shifted into fifth gear. So long, Golden
Bears.
While O'Brien eventually fell to Peder
sen in three sets, his teammates picked up
the slack. And left the Bears wondering if
maybe they should have slept in, after all.
At No. 2, Stark never let Matt Lucena in
the match. After cruising to a 6-3 advan
tage in the first set, Stark held serve to
open the second, broke Lucena in the sec
ond game, and kept on rolling.
With his 100-plus-mile-per-hour serve
right on target, Stark aced his way to a 6-0
demonstration — some games denying
Lucena nary a point — and a standing ova
tion from the capacity crowd.
Stark's determination was contagious.
O'Brien and Palmer both powered their
way back into their matches in their second
sets.
O'Brien deserved the "Valiant Effort of
the Day" award. After being humiliated in
the first set, he turned right around and
broke Pedersen in the second. Things were
all tied up at three — and Pedersen was still
dictating the tempo of the match — when
O'Brien went to the net. Down 15-40 he
fought his way back into the point, and
slammed a volley past Pedersen for the 4-3
break.
The momentum clearly in his court,
O'Brien cruised to a 6-3 win in the second.
Pedersen answered with four straight
games. But once again O'Brien refused to
quit. He fought back to 4-5 before Pedersen
put the match out of reach, 6-0, 3-6, 6-4. It
was O'Brien's first defeat in twelve
matches at No. 1.
"To win 12 in a row is pretty dammed
good at No. 1," Gould said.
"I'm not sure it's not all that bad to lose
a match every once in a while," added
Whitlinger.
Palmer's renewed intensity, on the other

If this weekend is any indication,,sophomore Jared Palmer has rediscovered his winning ways. The shot-making wizard
upended California's Carl Chang, 3-6, 7-6, 6-3, as the Cardinal routed the Bears 8-1 Saturday. Palmer also teamed with
partner Jonathan Stark to record an easy 6-3, 6-4 victory over Bent Ove Pedersen and Matt Lucena, the nation's No. 1-
ranked doubles tandem.

first 3-6 to Chang, he went up on
Michael's Little Brother 5-2
before allowing his opponent back
into the match. But at 6-6 Palmer
pulled out the tiebreaker to send
the match to three. And set No. 3
had his name written all over it.
3-6, 7-6, 6-3 Stanford.
One month ago Cal swept the
bottom three, taking two in
straight sets. The tables were
turned Saturday Jason Yee had
no trouble with Matt Stroyman at
No. 4, cruising to a 6-2, 6-3 win.
Michael Flanagan was also in
complete control, shellacking
Tom Phanco 6-4, 6-2 at No. 6 to
give the Cardinal the advantage.
At No. 5, Vimal Patel pulled off
one of his most tenacious victo
ries of the year, allowing Stanford
to win in singles. After cruising to
a 6-4 first set, he hit a wall in the
second, falling 3-6. Quickly
rebounding, Patel built up a 5-2
advantage before he let Phanco
back in. Down 5-6, he broke
Phanco, then held on for the 7-6
tie-breaking win.
Stanford 5, California 1. Game
over.

But the two squads elected to
compete in doubles anyway, giv
ing the Cardinal a chance to get in
doubles play before nationals —
and an opportunity to annihilate
the Bears.
At No. 1, the dynamic duo of
Stark and Palmer avenged their
defeat in Berkeley. With balls
from rocket volleys flying on both
sides of the court, the Stanford
tandem worked its way to a 6-3
advantage over Pedersen and
Lucena, then held off a strong
comeback bid for the 6-4 victory.
The win may have earned
them the No. 1 seed at NCAA
doubles competition.
O'Brien and Yee concluded
their season undefeated in dual
match play with a 6-3, 6-3 school
ing of Ed Marcum and Barry
Hancock at No. 2, and Patel and
Chris Cocotos destroyed Fitz
patrick and Phanco 6-1, 6-3.
The Cardinal couldn't have
been happier with its perfor
mance. "I am the most pleased
about our doubles play,"
Whitlinger said. "Everyone
played exceptionally. We'd been
struggling a bit at No. 3 but I'm

for John and Jared. And Alex and

Cardinal 8, Huskies 1
Cardinal 8, Golden Bears 1

The Cardinal decimated both Washing
ton Friday and No. 6 California Saturday,
bringing its season record to 19-4 in its
final tune-up for next week's national team
tournament. A fourth-consecutive national
title is looking like a strong possibility.
The wave is cresting, ready to wash over
the competition in Athens, Ga. Again. Stan
ford's victories brought its streak to seven
— six of which were clinched in singles play.
College tennis world — look out!
"Our reputation speaks for itself when it
comes to Athens," said John Whitlinger,
Stanford's assistant coach. "The guys are
on a roll now. They have a lot of confidence.
It seems like we're right where we should
be.
"The Big Red Machine is going to try to
keep rolling."
While Stanford's convincing victories
will not give it the No. 1 seeding at NCAAs
due to its two losses to USC during the sea
son — one at the National Team Indoors
and the other in Pac-10 play — it should be
top four. And the Cardinal will definitely be
ahead of conference rival Cal.
Saturday's win was sweet revenge for
the Cardinal. The Bears handed the squad
humility last month with a defeat that
almost ended in singles. A second victory
would have given Cal the fourth and final
top spot in Georgia. Now Stanford has the
advantage.
But the loss across the Bay may have
been exactly what Stanford needed at the
time.
"When we lost there it made it three in a
row, and coach [Gould] said, 'Let the season
start here,' " sophomore phenom Jonathan
Stark said. "We've played very well since
then — beating USC, UCLA and Cal in sin
gles and putting up a real good showing at
Pac-10's.
"We're ready to play"

It looked like it was going to be two in a
row for the Bears, however. Two years that
is. California ended Stanford's 40-match
home winning streak last season, and, after
an hour of play, it appeared that the Bears
were once again going to be the first team of
the season to down the Cardinal at Stan
ford.
Top singles player Alex O'Brien had been
demolished by Bent Ove Pedersen 6-0 in
the first set, Jared Palmer had been downed
by Carl Chang 6-3, and three Cardinal com
petitors were down early in their second
sets.
It was right then, however, that Stanford
shifted into fifth gear. So long, Golden
Bears.
While O'Brien eventually fell to Peder
sen in three sets, his teammates picked up
the slack. And left the Bears wondering if
maybe they should have slept in, after all.
At No. 2, Stark never let Matt Lucena in
the match. After cruising to a 6-3 advan
tage in the first set, Stark held serve to
open the second, broke Lucena in the sec
ond game, and kept on rolling.
With his 100-plus-mile-per-hour serve
right on target, Stark aced his way to a 6-0
demonstration — some games denying
Lucena nary a point — and a standing ova
tion from the capacity crowd.
Stark's determination was contagious.
O'Brien and Palmer both powered their
way back into their matches in their second
sets.
O'Brien deserved the "Valiant Effort of
the Day" award. After being humiliated in
the first set, he turned right around and
broke Pedersen in the second. Things were
all tied up at three — and Pedersen was still
dictating the tempo of the match — when
O'Brien went to the net. Down 15-40 he
fought his way back into the point, and
slammed a volley past Pedersen for the 4-3
break.
The momentum clearly in his court,
O'Brien cruised to a 6-3 win in the second.
Pedersen answered with four straight
games. But once again O'Brien refused to
quit. He fought back to 4-5 before Pedersen
put the match out of reach, 6-0, 3-6, 6-4. It
was O'Brien's first defeat in twelve
matches at No. 1.
"To win 12 in a row is pretty dammed
good at No. 1," Gould said.
"I'm not sure it's not all that bad to lose
a match every once in a while," added
Whitlinger.
Palmer's renewed intensity, on the other

If this weekend is any indication,,sophomore Jared Palmer has rediscovered his winning ways. The shot-making wizard
upended California's Carl Chang, 3-6, 7-6, 6-3, as the Cardinal routed the Bears 8-1 Saturday. Palmer also teamed with
partner Jonathan Stark to record an easy 6-3, 6-4 victory over Bent Ove Pedersen and Matt Lucena, the nation's No. 1-
ranked doubles tandem.
hand, paid off. After dropping the
first 3-6 to Chang, he went up on
Michael's Little Brother 5-2
before allowing his opponent back
into the match. But at 6-6 Palmer
pulled out the tiebreaker to send
the match to three. And set No. 3
had his name written all over it.
3-6, 7-6, 6-3 Stanford.
One month ago Cal swept the
bottom three, taking two in
straight sets. The tables were
turned Saturday Jason Yee had
no trouble with Matt Stroyman at
No. 4, cruising to a 6-2, 6-3 win.
Michael Flanagan was also in
complete control, shellacking
Tom Phanco 6-4, 6-2 at No. 6 to
give the Cardinal the advantage.
At No. 5, Vimal Patel pulled off
one of his most tenacious victo
ries of the year, allowing Stanford
to win in singles. After cruising to
a 6-4 first set, he hit a wall in the
second, falling 3-6. Quickly
rebounding, Patel built up a 5-2
advantage before he let Phanco
back in. Down 5-6, he broke
Phanco, then held on for the 7-6
tie-breaking win.
Stanford 5, California 1. Game
over.

But the two squads elected to
compete in doubles anyway, giv
ing the Cardinal a chance to get in
doubles play before nationals —
and an opportunity to annihilate
the Bears.
At No. 1, the dynamic duo of
Stark and Palmer avenged their
defeat in Berkeley. With balls
from rocket volleys flying on both
sides of the court, the Stanford
tandem worked its way to a 6-3
advantage over Pedersen and
Lucena, then held off a strong
comeback bid for the 6-4 victory.
The win may have earned
them the No. 1 seed at NCAA
doubles competition.
O'Brien and Yee concluded
their season undefeated in dual
match play with a 6-3, 6-3 school
ing of Ed Marcum and Barry
Hancock at No. 2, and Patel and
Chris Cocotos destroyed Fitz
patrick and Phanco 6-1, 6-3.
The Cardinal couldn't have
been happier with its perfor
mance. "I am the most pleased
about our doubles play,"
Whitlinger said. "Everyone
played exceptionally. We'd been
struggling a bit at No. 3 but I'm

ment. It was simply a great win
for John and Jared. And Alex and
