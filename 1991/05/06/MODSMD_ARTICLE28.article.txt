# Card nine goes into overtime, nearly sweeps Bruins
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
A win yesterday would have been ideal,
but justice was still served this weekend
in Los Angeles. Stanford lost a 4-3 heart
breaker in the 14th inning to close their
three-game series with UCLA, yet man
aged to win the first two games. In the
process, the Cardinal clinched second
place in the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division.
It seems appropiate that Jackie Robin
son Stadium was the site of the Cardi
nal's success. Two weeks ago the Bruins
had knocked Stanford out of the Six-Pac
race with a Sunken Diamond sweep, and
though retribution came up one game
short, the Cardinal did enough damage to
erase the old memories and virtually
guarantee themselves another trip to
postseason play.
Though yesterday's loss dropped Stan
ford to 34-17 overall and 16-10 in the Six-
Pac, Friday's 18-0 walloping and Satur
day's 12-11 comeback win were enough to
secure second place in the conference, a
result that should produce an invitaton

regional.
The Cardinal got themselves into this
comfortable position by sending word to
the Bruins early that this series would
not be a repeat performance. Behind the
complete game shutout pitching of John
Reid, the Cardinal pounded out 19 hits off
six UCLA pitchers to take the opener in a
walkover.
Reid allowed only three hits over the
nine innings, striking out six while only
walking two. Troy Tallman helped treat
the wounds of the last meetings by bang
ing out a grand slam, as the Cardinal used
a four-run seventh inning and a seven
run eighth to negate the Bruins chances
for another sweep.
With one nightmare experience erased,
the Cardinal almost revived another the
next day. Reminiscent of the 10-run lead

they squandered last weekend in a loss to
Arizona, Stanford found itself up 7-0
after their first at-bat only to be down 10-
7 three innings later.
Stanford jumped all over Bruin starter
Tim Lindsay early, knocking him out of
the game before UCLA could record a sin
gle out. Lindsay walked two and gave up
all seven runs on five hits, highlighting
the experience with a gopher ball to Roger
Burnett for a three-run homer. The prob
lem was, like Arizona, the home team did
not roll over and die. UCLA scored a run
in each of their the next two at-bats, sav
ing their run explosion for the fourth
inning.
Stanford starter Jamie Sepeda got the
team in trouble when he gave up two runs
on a walk and two singles and found him
self heading for the showers with his
team up 7-3. Aaron Dorlarque came in as
relief, but actually provided the opposite.
With the bases loaded, Dorlarque walked
in another run then let Gary Tokheim
clear the bases with a grand slam that
sent the Bruins ahead 8-7.
With only one out, Dorlarque walked
Robert Hinds and then gave up his second

long ball of the inning to Chris Pritchett,
making the score 10-7 in UCLA's favor
and sending Marquess to the mound.
Brian Sackinsky came in to clean things
up and managed to get the last two outs
and end the madness.
Having had a week to think over the
last lead they lost, Stanford decided not to
let this one get away. The Cardinal con
tinued the home run parade by getting
two of their own in the next inning to pull
within one. Burnett and Tallman each
collected their second round trippers of
the weekend with back-to-back efforts
that swung the emotion back to Stan
ford's favor. The Cardinal used this impe
tus to take over the game in the sixth
when they scored three runs to retake
control of the game, 12-10.
"It was a big lift to be down by three
and then get the back-to-back home
runs," Marquess said. "They had the
momentum and we regained it. That was
big-
UCLA staged a little comeback in the
bottom of the ninth when Sackinsky
walked Hinds and then gave way to closer
Scott Weiss. Joe Wolfe singled to bring the

Bruins within one, but Weiss struck out
Micheal Moore to end both the threat and
the game. Sackinsky wound up as the
game winner, going 4 and two-thirds
innings and giving up only three hits
while striking out two. After some shaky
starts due to his comeback from an arm
injury, Sackinsky finally showed the form
that made him a 10-game winner last
year.
"Brian Sackinsky shut them down,"
Marquess said. "He did a great job; he had
a good fastball and I'm very pleased with
the way he pitched. That was his best per
formance."
Looking for the sweep, the Cardinal
found itself unable to do what the team
had done so well in the first two games:
score runs. After going up 3-0 on Bruin
errors, the Cardinal watched as UCLA
used a Chris Pritchett homer and a two
run eighth inning to tie the game and
send it to extra innings.
Stanford had the bases loaded in both
the 11th and the 13th, but could not score
a run either time. UCLA was finallv able
