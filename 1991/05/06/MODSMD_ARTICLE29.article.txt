# Homestanding golf finishes 4th at Pac-10s

At first, they were sizzling. But
as Cardinal coach Wally Goodwin
said, "The cream really came to
the top."
On Friday, the Cardinal men's
golf team — playing on its very
own Stanford Golf Course — set
the pace for the 72-hole Pacific 10
Conference Championship, hut
perennial powerhouses Arizona,
Arizona State and USC outlasted
the Cardinal in the final 54 holes
played Saturday and yesterday.
Second-ranked Arizona
upended top-ranked Arizona
State by 14 strokes with a three
day total of 1,430. The Trojans,
ranked seventh in the nation, set
tled for third as they bettered the
Cardinal by 16 shots. Stanford
completed the tourney with a
1,463, well ahead of fifth-place
Washington. California finished
ninth — out of 10.
The Cardinal six opened the
tourney with quite possibly the
best performance ever seen on
The Farm.
Led by freshman sensation
Casey Martin, the linksters com

bined for a 356 in the play-six,
count-five format. After 18 holes,
the Cardinal led second-ranked
Arizona by a stroke, top-ranked
Arizona State by nine strokes and
USC by 12. "That's the best golf
I've ever seen on this course,"
Goodwin said.
Martin led the field with a
three-under par and senior Johan
Remmelgas, who had just quali
fied for Pac-lOs the week before,
was only a stroke behind with a
69.
But the key to the tourney was
the 36 holes on Saturday — and
the Cardinal did not fare too well.
Arizona took over the tournament
with a 54-hole total of 1,071, 19
strokes ahead of its closest com
petitor, Arizona State. USC
moved up a notch into third place
at 1,094, four strokes behind the
Sun Devils, but only two ahead of
Stanford.
After Martin's phenomenal
performance in the first round he
was paired with Arizona's top
player, Manny Zerman, and Ari
zona State's Phil Mickelson.

finishing as low amateur at The
Masters, is the top Arizona State
player and the two-time defending
NCAA champion.
"Phil [Mickelson] attracted
some big galleries," Martin said.
"It was somewhat intimidating."
Martin ballooned his score
when he shot a 77 followed by a
76. "I just didn't play well," Mar
tin said. "It was just one of those
days." He rebounded yesterday to
hit an even par. "I played all right
today," said a disappointed Mar
tin. He finished 14th overall with
a 292, second-best on the Cardinal
squad.
After Martin's picturesque
opening round, the story for the
Cardinal belonged to the other
freshman phenom, Notah Begay.
"It went OK," Begay said. "I
struck the ball well all four days."
Begay shot a solid one-over par
on Friday and returned Saturday
to dismantle his competitors with
a two-under par on the first 18

holes and a 73 on the final 18. His
even par yesterday put him sixth
overall in the Pac-10 individual
standings with a 286.
"That's pretty damned good to
hit two strokes behind Phil Mick
elson," Goodwin said. Mickelson
finished in third behind Arizona's
Zerman, who shot a 278, and
Washington's O.D. Vincent, who
was a stroke behind Zerman.
"I'm just learning every
round," Begay said. "College golf
is a lot different from national
junior tournaments.
"You make a lot of mental mis
takes here. Hopefully, by the time
of the NCAA tournament I will
have enough knowledge to give
them a good showing."
Junior Christian Cevaer did
not have the tournament he was
hoping for, especially after win
ning the Brigham Young Cougar
Classic last weekend. He finished
with a 295, good for third on the
Cardinal.
"I think we did a pretty
damned good job," Goodwin said.
"Everyone played better than
their stroke averages and this is
