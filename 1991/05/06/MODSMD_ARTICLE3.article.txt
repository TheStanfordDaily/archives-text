# Students First sweeps COP runoff
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
A celebration was held Friday night in the
ASSU office, but for the first time in four
years it wasn't members of the People's Plat
form who were sipping the champagne.
"Students First" defeated "Stand and
Deliver" in the Council of Presidents runoff
race by the biggest margin since the beginning
of the two-party system at Stanford three
years ago.
In last week's election, "Students First"
received nearly 64 percent of the vote, topping
the 36 percent garnered by "Stand and
Deliver," the People's Platform slate.
"I am very happy," said graduate senator
and COP-elect member John Overdeck early
Saturday morning. "But the truth of the mat
ter is that only 14 percent of the student body
voted for us. We have a long way to go to build
the credibility that this organization deserves,
and that job starts tomorrow."
Voter turnout for the election was the low

est in many years, as only about 2,850 stu
dents voted. That represented 21 percent of
the student body and was a drop of almost
3,000 students from the April 17-18 general
election and nearly 600 from last spring's
recall election, which happened during Dead
Week.
Joining Overdeck on the COP-elect are
sophomores Beth Morgan and Benny San
doval, and junior John Louie.
"It will be a lot of work, but 1 am looking
forward to working for the student body and
the University," Louie said. "It is kind of dis
appointing that so few people came out to vote,
but I would call 64 percent (of the vote) a very
good sign."
Elections commissioner Enda Hu, a sopho
more, blamed the low turnout on bad weather,
fewer students being around campus on a F>i
day and some poorly situated poll sites. Only
37 students voted at Encina Gym and 44 at the
Business School, even though both sites were
open for more than five hours both Thursday
and Friday.

Hu said he might have changed the days of
the election and the locations of some poll
sites, but because the ASSU Senate had
already approved the election schedule, he
could not do so.
Although members of the Stand and
Deliver slate did not wait for results at the
ASSU Friday night, they graciously accepted
defeat.
"Students First worked very hard, and I
sincerely congratulate them," said Stand and
Deliver member Mike Curry, a sophomore. "I
have no ill feelings and respect all four of
them."
Junior Jennifer Pearson attributed her
slate's loss to several different causes and said
more students "were voting against the past
history of the People's Platform rather than
voting for the current issues of Students
First."
"I think that the misconceptions about
what People's Platform stands for hurt our
campaign. A lot of people, includ
ing The Daily editorial board,
didn't look at our slate as four dif
ferent individuals bringing new
perspectives to both our party
and the campus," she added.
Pearson said part of the blame
lies in The Daily's endorsement,
the hearings officer's ruling pre
venting People's Platform from
airing messages on XTV because
Students First did not do so, neg
ative campaigning by Students
First and the "general isolationist
and more conservative tone of our
country that is being reflected in
campus politics."
Louie said the "deplorable"
past history of the People's Plat
form hurt "Stand and Deliver"
but added that freshmen and
sophomores unfamiliar with past

campus politics "voted for us
because of our ideas."
Members of both slates said
they have learned valuable
lessons from the election. For
example, Curry proposed the cre
ation of a judicial branch of the
ASSU to rule on elections infrac
tions and said there need to be
more publicized debates to pre
sent the issues instead of a "war
of four-by-eight (foot) signs."
Members of the COP-elect
have a few weeks before they for
mally begin their new job, but
they said they are already trying
to decide how to act on the results
of the financial-aid office referen
dum and how to aid
Chicano/Latino student groups in
getting funds after the loss of
MEChA's special-fee request. -
But the issue about which they
will have no second thoughts is
the 20 percent pay cut promised
throughout the election, which
Louie and Overdeck promise will

take effect next year.
In other election news, the
debate around the late general
election votes from Stanford in
Washington continues.
According to a copy of the
instructions sent to the Washing
ton campus that was obtained by
The Daily, the tally sheet had to
be received by the elections com
mission by last Monday afternoon
â€” not the Sunday 7 p.m. deadline
imposed by hearings officer Jason
Moore, a junior.
"The issue is that the elections
commissioner screwed up," said
Stanford in Washington resident
assistant Marc Katz. "It is ridicu
lous that the elections commis
sioner did not know what the
time-frame was."
Hu said he was "not aware" of
those instructions but promised
to "look into it." He said he does
not know who sent the ballots to
Washington.
