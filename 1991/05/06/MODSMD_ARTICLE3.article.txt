# Students First sweeps COP runoff
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
A celebration was held Friday night in the
ASSU office, but for the first time in four
years it wasn't members of the People's Plat
form who were sipping the champagne.
"Students First" defeated "Stand and
Deliver" in the Council of Presidents runoff
race by the biggest margin since the beginning
of the two-party system at Stanford three
years ago.
In last week's election, "Students First"
received nearly 64 percent of the vote, topping
the 36 percent garnered by "Stand and
Deliver," the People's Platform slate.
"I am very happy," said graduate senator
and COP-elect member John Overdeck early
Saturday morning. "But the truth of the mat
ter is that only 14 percent of the student body
voted for us. We have a long way to go to build
the credibility that this organization deserves,
and that job starts tomorrow."
Voter turnout for the election was the low

est in many years, as only about 2,850 stu
dents voted. That represented 21 percent of
the student body and was a drop of almost
3,000 students from the April 17-18 general
election and nearly 600 from last spring's
recall election, which happened during Dead
Week.
Joining Overdeck on the COP-elect are
sophomores Beth Morgan and Benny San
doval, and junior John Louie.
"It will be a lot of work, but 1 am looking
forward to working for the student body and
the University," Louie said. "It is kind of dis
appointing that so few people came out to vote,
but I would call 64 percent (of the vote) a very
good sign."
Elections commissioner Enda Hu, a sopho
more, blamed the low turnout on bad weather,
fewer students being around campus on a F>i
day and some poorly situated poll sites. Only
37 students voted at Encina Gym and 44 at the
Business School, even though both sites were
open for more than five hours both Thursday
and Friday.

Hu said he might have changed the days of
the election and the locations of some poll
sites, but because the ASSU Senate had
already approved the election schedule, he
could not do so.
Although members of the Stand and
Deliver slate did not wait for results at the
ASSU Friday night, they graciously accepted
defeat.
"Students First worked very hard, and I
sincerely congratulate them," said Stand and
Deliver member Mike Curry, a sophomore. "I
have no ill feelings and respect all four of
them."
Junior Jennifer Pearson attributed her
slate's loss to several different causes and said
more students "were voting against the past
history of the People's Platform rather than
voting for the current issues of Students
First."
"I think that the misconceptions about
what People's Platform stands for hurt our
