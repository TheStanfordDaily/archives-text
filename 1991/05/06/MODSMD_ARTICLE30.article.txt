# Gaines sprints her way into nationals
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
While some of us were kicking
back this weekend, enjoying
spring quarter in sunny Califor
nia, Stanford sprinter Chryste
Gaines was in Texas at the
Longhorn Invitational.
Last week Scott Chisam, an
assistant track coach, said Gaines
was "ready to run well." And she
did. She finished second in the
100 meters with a time of 11.28
seconds and fourth in the 200 in
23.23.
"I went down to qualify for [the
NCAA Championships] and that's
what I did," Gaines said. Stanford
has now automatically qualified
four athletes in five events at
NCAAs.
While Gaines was down south
the Cardinal men were taking on
the Oregon Ducks in Eugene.
Chisam called it "possibly the
start of a new tradition."
Hopefully for Stanford, future
trips will be accompanied by a
reversal of fortune. The Cardinal
lost, 115-41.
The fly-in-Saturday morning
compete-fly-out Saturday night
venture was done as a return
favor for Oregon's participation in
the Diet Pepsi Track Challenge
which was held at Stanford five
weeks ago.
On their home turf, the Ducks
proved almost unbeatable, win
ning 14 of 18 events. The lopsided
score is deceptive since the Cardi
nal only sent 20 competitors.
"It wasn't the best possible cir
cumstances," said distance run
ner Chris Eae. "Sometimes we
have a hard time getting up for
the post-Cal meet. We tried to
compete our best. It's kind of a
letdown. Everyone would have
liked to perform better, including
_ M
me.
Rae was one of the bright spots
for the Stanford contingent. He
placed third in the 1,500 meters
with his second fastest time ever,
3:48.64.
Jason Martin led wire to wire
in the 3,000 meter steeplechase.

Dave Scudamore won the 5,000
while beating two club athletes.
Marcus Hickerson easily won the
long jump with a leap of 25 feet, 2
inches, well below his season best
of 26 feet, 1/4 inch.
"Coming off Cal you're just not
going to be as sharp," Chisam
said. "Now he jumps 25 feet on his
bad days. When he's on, he'll go
way over 26 feet."
Because Hickerson had to run
the 400 right after the long jump
he missed participating in a
unique Oregon tradition. "If you
win (an event) you take a victory
lap. They get upset if you don't,"
Chisam said. He called Hicker
son's 48.03 third place time in the
400 "the fastest victory lap of any
. M
one.

Members of the throwing team
got their victory laps in as they
continued their strong perfor
mances from Big Meet. John
Fowler won the discus with Pat
Stowell finishing a close second.
Dave Popejoy took third in the
hammer with a toss of 182 feet, 11
inches.
Toby Norwood took second in
the shot put with a lifetime best
50 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Oregon had the event sweeped
until Norwood finished the ham
mer throw and rushed over to the
shot put ring. He got his six
attempts in after all the other
competitors were done.
Although the competition was
just a dual meet the Ducks drew
2,000 fans. They apologized for

the low figure (Oregon averages
5,000) but the Portland Trailblaz
ers' playoff game was televised.
"Even in Eugene they'll stay
(home) and watch basketball,"
Chisam said.
The Cardinal men finished
their dual meet season with seven
wins and two losses. They have
two weeks to prepare for the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships at Arizona State.
Best bets for conference crown
rest with defending Pac-10 cham
pion Dave Strang in the 800
meters and Mark Mastalir in the
1,500.
The women's team will be gear
ing up for the Pac-10 Champi
onships with the Modesto Relays
this weekend.
