# League meet up next
## Crew rows well at Davis 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
The women's crew team came
away from Saturday's regatta
against UC-Davis with mixed
results, chalking up final wins for
the varsity eight and first novice
eight but dropping the varsity
four and second novice eight
races.
In the last dual meet of the sea
son, the varsity eight showed the
improvement that coach John
Davis was hoping to see before the
Pacific Coast Championships.
Taking a permanent lead off the
start, the Cardinal outrowed the
Aggies by a large 15-second mar
gin that left the members of the
team feeling good about their per
formance.
"When they came off the water,
they all had big smiles on their
faces," Davis said. "They said it
was the best row they've had all
year."
Sophomore Wendy Martin felt
that the team's performance was
a good sign of things to come. "We
have definitely improved a lot and
the boat is finally starting to come
together and be really strong," she
said. "We've been picking up
speed, and when Pac-lOs come
around (in two weeks) I think
we'll do well."
According to senior Emily
Dirksen, much of this weekend's
race was decided by the team's
successful execution of a new
strategy. "We were able to get a
sprint going at the end," she said.
"We were able to shorten our
strokes and really get our rate up.
We also took our powers of 10
(strokes) at different points dur
ing the race, which worked out
well."
The varsity four was not able to
come up with a win against UC-

Davis's powerful four, which was
composed of members of the
lightweight national' champi
onship team.
The first-team novice eight
overcame a shaky start to finish
the season undefeated in dual
competition. "We went into the
race thinking we could beat Davis
pretty easily," freshman stroke
Maijorie Crigler admitted. "Then
we started really badly, and they
were ahead for 750 meters. But
we're good at driving hard and
being really solid and finally we
just booked past them and won by
three or four seats of open water."
Although novice coach Wendy
Davis described the race as being
"a little scary for a while," she can
hardly be disappointed with the
boat's performance this season.
Suffering its only defeat against
No. 1-ranked Washington earlier
in the season, the Cardinal will
enter the Pac-10 Championships
ranked No. 2 and with high hopes
of returning with a title.
The second novice tight also
has had an outstanding season,
although the boat was edged out
by just under a second on Satur
day. The dual meet loss was the
first of the season, and it came on
the heels of some recent lineup
changes.
"The boat lost a little rhythm
due to the changes," Davis said.
"But right now we're in the mid
dle of our big push before we begin
to taper (the difficulty of prac
tices). Everyone's really tired, but
we only lost by about five feet.
Once they're rested, they should
be able to beat them pretty
soundly."
"Of course we were disap
pointed, but now we've got more
motivation than ever to beat them
at Pac-lOs," sophomore Sarah
Tracy said.
