# Top-ranked foes pay call on women's golf

### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The table is set.
And they're ready to begin
the feast.
The Cardinal women's golf
team tees off this morning in
the California Invitational in
what will be its last tuneup
before the big one, the NCAA
tournament at Ohio State. It is
senior Jodi Figley's final tour
ney on The Farm.
"I'm excited about it and I
obviously want to beat UCLA
and San Jose State," said
Figley, who will join the ranks
of the pro circuit this summer.
The two-day tournament on
the Stanford Golf Course pits
the Cardinal against a
formidable field led by top
ranked San Jose State and sec
ond-ranked UCLA.
"It's basically a three team
tournament â€” San Jose St.,
UCLA and us," said junior
Stephanie Davis. "But we have
the home course advantage and
the talent to do it. We just need
the right attitude."
Last week, at the Pacific 10
Conference Championship in
Eugene, Ore. UCLA clobbered
its Pac-10 foes en route to the
conference title. "I don't know
if we've beaten UCLA all year,"
said Davis. "If we have, it was a
while ago."
And then there is San Jose
State, which has four players
ranked in the top 25 nationally.
"If we could nail them
(UCLA and San Jose State)

here on our home course it
would give us momentum and
confidence going into the
NCAA's," said junior Audrey
Wooding. "It would establish
us going into nationals."
The Cardinal will face,
among others, Pac-10 rivals
USC, Oregon State, and Wash
ington in addition to Long
Beach State, Hawaii, Brigham
Young, USF and Pepperdine.
The teams will play 36 holes
today and complete the tour
ney with 18 on Tuesday.
Today's tournament is the
first and only time this year
that the Cardinal will play 36
holes on a given day.
"Thirty-six holes will be a
challenge," said Figley. "But I
don't think it will be a factor
because we're all in pretty good
shape. It's going to be a matter
of who can concentrate the
longest."
If the Cardinal is going to
prove that it is every bit as
competitive as the Spartans
and Bruins, the home course
advantage should not hinder
them.
"The last time we played a
tournament on our course (last
autumn in the Fall Invita
tional) we played really well,"
said junior Adele Moore. "We
hit a 299 or 300."
Wooding thinks that the
putting will be the difference
for the Cardinal. "These greens
are tricky and fast," she said.
"We have to keep our heads on
and two-putt or one-putt every
time."
