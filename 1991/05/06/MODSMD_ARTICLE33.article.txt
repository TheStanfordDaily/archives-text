# Activist urges Chicanas to become leaders
## 
### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
Calling for Chicanas to "discard the yoke of
triple oppression," political activist and former
Colorado state senator Polly Baca opened a
weekend of Cinco de Mayo events in a Friday
speech at History Corner.
Baca's speech, titled "Silent No More: A
Chicana's Vision for Leadership," emphasized
the possibility of a new style of leadership for
Chicanas. She also discussed the barriers now
facing them, including oppression based on
race, gender and class.
The speech was one of several events cele
brating Cinco de Mayo. There were also two
fiestas at Casa Zapata, a bilingual mass, an
improvisational performance by Teatro Xicano
de Stanford and an alumni conference.
Baca, who serves as executive director of the
Colorado Institute for Hispanic Education and

Economic Development, said her vision of
leadership emphasizes "nurturing the positive
side of human nature," recognizing the accom
plishments of both genders and valuing diver
sity among and within cultures."
Leadership should not involve dominance
or power of one person over another, Baca
said, but should leave room for respectful, hon
est disagreement.
Emphasizing that leadership should be
shared, she said of Chicanas, "Our proper
place is working side by side, mano en mano
with our male colleagues."
Mexican-American women earn 15 percent
less than the national average for all women,
and 17 percent less than Mexican-American
men, Baca said. Chicanas are forced to contend
simultaneously with sexism, racism and class
oppression, she added.
She pointed to women who have played
leadership roles historically, including Queen

Isabella and Dorena Morena. "Historians seem
to forget that . . . Columbus could never have
outfitted three Spanish ships . . . had it not
been for a Spanish woman taking the risk of a
lifetime," she said.
She called Morena, a Native American
woman who was given as a gift to Cortez and
was his translator, "the communications link
between two worlds and the mother of a new
race."
Baca's speech marked the Sixth Annual
Ernesto Galarza Commemorative Lecture, and
she was the first woman to speak in the lecture
series.
As a Colorado state senator from 1974 to
1986, Baca was the first Chicano/Latino
woman to hold a leadership position in any
senate in the United States.
The lecture was a Stanford Centennial mul
ticultural event and was presented by the
Stanford Center for Chicano Research.
