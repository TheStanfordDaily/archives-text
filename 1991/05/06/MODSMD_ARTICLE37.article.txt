# Two groups lose fee requests
## Referendum for ASSU financial aid office passes 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
MEChA's controversial appearance on the runoff
ballot proved fruitless as almost 56 percent of the
students who voted denied its special fee request.
Project Motivation, which was inadvertently left
off the ballot in the ASSU general elections two
weeks ago, received about 70 percent of the votes
cast, but failed to get the 15 percent approval of the
student body it needed to win its fee request.
And the non-binding referendum to create an
ASSU financial aid office, which only required
mcyority approval, passed with 56 percent of the
vote.
MEChA co-chair Maria Peters said the group's
leadership plan to meet soon and discuss ways of
securing funding for the programs it sponsors. She
called the election result "unfortunate," but said she
does not regret campaigning for MEChA a second
time because it was necessary to bring the issue back
to students "with all the information."
Peters said that if MEChA just went to the senate
for money, it would be a real "subversion of democ
racy." The students needed a second chance to vote
on MEChA because of "irregularities" surrounding
the general election, she added.
She said the group was really hurt by negative
opinions, which, while valid, were often "construed
as facts" during the campaign. "We tried to counter
that as best as we could," she said.
But graduate senator Larry Augustin, who
worked against placing the MEChA fee request on
the runoff ballot, said, "I am encouraged that the
students did not let the senate get away with putting
MEChA on the ballot twice, and I hope that the sen
ate will abide by the students' voice this time."
The financial-aid office referendum was placed on
the runoff ballot after students voted down the
ASSU lobby-office proposal in the general election.
Advocates said the runoff referendum was a
response to students' support of a general election

referendum asking the ASSU to work for financial
aid.
"Students are really concerned about financial
aid, and this referendum shows that the ASSU does
have a role to play," said Jennifer Pearson, who sup
ported the creation of an office, which will work with
the United States Students Association. Pearson was
a member of the defeated Council of Presidents slate
"Stand and Deliver."
Senator Naomi Onaga said she is also happy the
referendum passed. "We will get together to figure
out how the office should be," she said.
Graduate senator Doug Bone, a vocal critic of the
financial aid office, said the results are "a clear rec
ommendation from a plurality of students to join
USSA." He added that more discussion is needed
because of a low voter turnout, "and the issue is still
confusing."
In his election handbook statement opposing the
referendum, Hone said it was "about financial aid for
the [USSArather than for students. He said he
opposes ASSU membership in the lobbying organi
zation.
Project Motivation's financial director Tonia
Zazueta, a junior, said group members were "very
disappointed" that they did not get the money "1 feel
like it is the ASSU's fault that we did not get on the
first ballot," she said. Project Motivation is an orga
nization that encourages Latino high school stu
dents to attend college.
Mike Canul, the project's director, said he plans to
go to the May 16 senate meeting "to protest their
mistake." The organization was "clearly the victim
of their error of forgetting to put us on the ballot."
Zazueta said that while Project Motivation was
late in submitting its election materials, former elec
tions commissioner Raul Lopez told her that about
30 percent of the other special-fee requests were also
late.
People also did not know what the group was
about, Zazueta said. "They might have grouped us
with MEChA, but we are a separate organization."
