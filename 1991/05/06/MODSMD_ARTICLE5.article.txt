# Betas incur $20K debt to University
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
The Beta fraternity is facing a
$20,000 debt to the University
incurred by boarders who moved
out for spring quarter but for
which the fraternity is responsi
ble.
About 10 students left the Beta
house either to go overseas, stop
out or move elsewhere on campus.
The students broke their hous
ing agreement by failing to find
replacement boarders or notify
the fraternity of their plans so it
could find replacements. Only two
of the 10 students explicitly stated
in their housing contracts that
they would be moving out spring
quarter.
The fraternity has to pay the
University for each available
housing spot.
Since fraternity housing con
tracts are arranged independently
of the University, the administra
tion has no enforcement obliga
tion. "It's the Betas' responsibil
ity to fill the house. It's their priv
ilege and their responsibility,"
said Asst. Row Director Anne
Junkerman. "Fraternities have
lost their housing due to debts."
Junkerman said fraternities

are responsible for foreseeing this
problem and can compensate for
lost residents by overcrowding the
house in advance or by inviting
new members.
The Betas have several options
in resolving their situation, such
as seeking University assistance
for enforcing the contracts, said
Beta president Kai Quinto. For
example, University administra
tors could place a hold on a stu
dent's registration for failure to
abide by a housing agreement.
One-on-one negotiations with
contract violators, however, is the
Betas' first choice, Quinto said.
"We hope people will be sympa
thetic to our situation, out of con
sideration," Quinto said.
"Whether or not they'd pay our
bill in full would be something to
discuss," he said.
If a debt remains at the end of
the quarter, the Betas may inten
tionally overcrowd their house by
one or two residents next year to
earn $2,000 per additional stu
dent. They may also ask their
alumni for assistance or may
restructure their budget to com
pensate, said Beta's resident
assistant Geoff Ballew.
Two new boarders moved into
the Beta house this spring, one of
whom returned from overseas.
The other resident is a visiting
scholar whose off-campus housing
arrangements fell through, said
Quinto. The scholar is visiting the
University for four weeks but was
reluctant to stay in a hotel since
he cannot drive, he said.
The scholar found out about
the Betas' vacancy through a com
puter service that advertises
housing to University students
and staff. "We weren't looking to
take in people off the street. We're
looking for legitimate boarders,"
Quinto said.
However, University policy
states explicitly that only regis
tered undergraduate and gradu
ate students may live in student
housing. The Betas have not had
time to contact University admin
istrators about this arrangement
yet, said Quinto.
Junkerman said she did not
know if a policy exception could be
made for a visiting fellow.
Currently, the Betas are in
good standing with the University,
said Row Director Jack Chin.
Although they are no longer affili
ated with the Beta Theta Pi
national organization, University
policies allow them to maintain
their house.
"They must be locally
autonomous. It doesn't matter to
the University what the ties are to
the national fraternity ... as long
as they're adhering to Stanford
policies and continuing to fill the

'We're looking for
legitimate boarders.'

house and not getting into trou
ble," Chin said.
However, filling the house may
present a problem. The Betas do
not know whether they will fill
their pledge quota, as they are still
offering bids to students in an
effort to fill the house. They are
allowed to do so until mid-August.
There are currently eight vacan
cies.
The Beta house has an occu
pancy of 37 residents plus the res
ident assistant, one third of whom
are typically boarders, Quinto
said. The fraternity also has sev
eral members who live off cam
pus.
"If the University decides to
take a house, they will look at the
house with the greatest two-year
quota deficit as well as social prob
lems, academic problems and pos
sible debts," said Ballew.
Two previous boarders,
William Ruark and Daniel Cama
cho, moved out of the Beta house
into Potter House this spring
seeking "a coed residential educa
tion environment." They claim
they did not violate their con
tracts.
The two seniors posted fliers to
find replacement boarders and
were reassured by the Betas'
house manager that finding two
new boarders would be "no prob
lem" and would fulfill their hous
ing obligation, Ruark said.
"I really feel that we're not
obligated to pay anything," Cama
cho said.
