# Betas incur $20K debt to University
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
The Beta fraternity is facing a
$20,000 debt to the University
incurred by boarders who moved
out for spring quarter but for
which the fraternity is responsi
ble.
About 10 students left the Beta
house either to go overseas, stop
out or move elsewhere on campus.
The students broke their hous
ing agreement by failing to find
replacement boarders or notify
the fraternity of their plans so it
could find replacements. Only two
of the 10 students explicitly stated
in their housing contracts that
they would be moving out spring
quarter.
The fraternity has to pay the
University for each available
housing spot.
Since fraternity housing con
tracts are arranged independently
of the University, the administra
tion has no enforcement obliga
tion. "It's the Betas' responsibil
ity to fill the house. It's their priv
ilege and their responsibility,"
said Asst. Row Director Anne
Junkerman. "Fraternities have
lost their housing due to debts."
Junkerman said fraternities

are responsible for foreseeing this
problem and can compensate for
lost residents by overcrowding the
house in advance or by inviting
new members.
The Betas have several options
in resolving their situation, such
as seeking University assistance
for enforcing the contracts, said
Beta president Kai Quinto. For
example, University administra
tors could place a hold on a stu
dent's registration for failure to
abide by a housing agreement.
One-on-one negotiations with
contract violators, however, is the
Betas' first choice, Quinto said.
"We hope people will be sympa
thetic to our situation, out of con
sideration," Quinto said.
"Whether or not they'd pay our
bill in full would be something to
discuss," he said.
If a debt remains at the end of
the quarter, the Betas may inten
tionally overcrowd their house by
one or two residents next year to
earn $2,000 per additional stu
dent. They may also ask their
alumni for assistance or may
restructure their budget to com
pensate, said Beta's resident
assistant Geoff Ballew.
