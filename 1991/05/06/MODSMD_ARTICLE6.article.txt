# Students hold party to save old Synergy
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Students and alumni with a
special affinity for the old Synergy
house held a garden party yester
day afternoon outside the
boarded-up edifice, which is
scheduled to be demolished this
summer to make way for faculty
residences.
Gathered near a table replete
with orange juice and healthy
pasta salad, about 20 Synergy
supporters swapped stories of
their old home and exchanged
grievances over the fact that the
house may soon be bulldozed.
Alumnus Paul Baer — who

founded the Committee to Save
the Hill Houses in January after
learning of the University's plan
to raze Synergy, Phi Psi and the
Delta Tau Delta house — sat out
side the barbed-wire fence sur
rounding the house and
strummed his guitar. People
formed a circle around him, main
taining a festive mood despite the
sorry physical state and fate of the
old Synergy house.
Baer said he organized the
party to bring friends of Synergy
and all "co-opers past, present and
future" together to "show the
strength of community support
for the old houses."
During the past few months,
Baer has sent letters to all the
alumni of the three houses, alert
ing them to the University's plans
and asking them for donations to
cover the cost of the mailings. His
committee has been digging into
the history of the house, hoping to
preserve it because of its past.
The three houses were closed
following the Earthquake of 1989.
Synergy residents now live in
Grove-Mayfield and Grove-
Lasuen.
Senior Eric Rose, who lived in
the old house for two years and is

currently the Synergy house man
ager, said the committee's
research has revealed some inter
esting information about the old
Synergy house, and he claims that
destruction of the house would
"degrade the historical character"
of the University.
For example, the house was one
of the rare wood-shingle houses
designed by the architects of San
Francisco City Hall, and once
housed the Beta Chi fraternity,
one of the first in the nation to
admit women, according to com
mittee members.
For Rose, who wore cut-off
jeans that had "Synergy" painted
in white down one side, the party
provided an opportunity for the
old Synergy house residents to
show current residents what the

house meant to them, in order to
"establish some continuity."
Graduate student Gal Cohen,
who lived in Synergy from 1984 to
1987, emphasized the importance
of co-operatives on campus. He
said Leland Stanford himself,
though a robber baron, had a
vision of a cooperative society,
with people living together and
working together.
The Synergy house supporters
agreed that the University does
not appreciate the importance of
co-ops on campus and has always
treated them with less priority
than other campus residences.
Phi Psi alumnus Gary Zweig, a
graduate student, said the co-ops
were "neglected and the founda
tions were allowed to fall apart"
and as a result, suffered exten
sively in the earthquake.
He asserted that the earth
quake has given the University an
excuse to get rid of the houses.
According to University esti
mates, it would cost $4.5 million
to repair the three houses.
Despite this weighty sum,
Rose, who keeps a thick notebook
of press clippings and letters relat
ing to the struggle to save Syn
ergy, maintains that it would be

more cost-effective to repair the
houses than to raze them.
Originally, the University
planned to repair the three earth
quake-damaged residences, but
because of the difference between
the actual and projected costs of
repairing Columbae and several
other houses during the summer,
administrators decided to tear
down the San Juan Hill houses.
Row Director Jack Chin
defended the decision in February,
saying it was one "that made the
most sense to the whole campus
community."
Former residents said the old
house is designed for cooperative
living. Synergy's large kitchen, for
example, is conducive to commu
nal cooking. The backyard is the
only land on campus zoned as an
agricultural area, meaning the
residents could have a serious gar
den and could legally raise chick
ens, said Rose.
Police circled the house several
times yesterday afternoon, but
the party proceeded without inci
dent.
Rose said the Committee to
Save the Hill Houses has tentative
plans to throw its next party out
side the Phi Psi house.
