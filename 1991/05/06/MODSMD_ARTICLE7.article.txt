# Universities use new personal touch to compete for freshmen
##

Dean Jean's customary personal notes
to accepted students — "Splendid,
Christina," "Bravo, Maria" and "Super,
Jenny" — were just the beginning.
Personalized acceptance letters, phone
calls from students and faculty, and invi
tations to campus and to receptions
around the country are becoming more
and more common — almost necessary
for selective colleges and universities.
While some parents and admitted stu
dents may see it as a high-pressure sales
pitch, Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter's colleagues at places

like Brown, Georgetown, Princeton and
Yale Universities see it as a way of helping
admitted students make informed deci
sions.
"We're not here to twist arms. We're
here to give information, answer ques
tions, and . . . give people a personal
introduction to the University which goes
beyond the literature sent to them in the
mail," said John Bunnell, Stanford's
director of freshman admissions.
Ann Lightcap of the Brown University
admissions office said, "We're not selling
Brown, we're just being accessible to
prospective freshmen."
But the letters and phone calls go a bit
beyond providing accessibility. Each

school is competing with other schools
around the country.
"The good majority of students admit
ted (to Stanford) were admitted just
about everywhere," Bunnell said. "When
we're one of eight or nine schools, we
have to make sure they are informed.
"Besides, if everyone else is doing it
and you're not, you have to wonder if
your not doing it is going to be noticed,"
Bunnell added.
Megan O'Brien, an undergraduate
admissions official at Georgetown Uni
versity, said Georgetown's main thrust
"is to show them we care about them,
that they're not just a piece of paper."
Brown University sponsors "call-outs"

targeted toward those students who
won't have the chance to visit the cam
pus. In addition, three or four nights dur
ing the month of April the university has
"call-ins," where admitted students can
call Brown's admissions office and talk to
a current Brown student volunteer.
"Our focus is on personal contact, all
along in the process," Lightcap said. "We
write a lot of post cards. We try to reach
all the students, but especially our
favorite ones."
Yale sponsors phone-a-thons for
minority students and prospective science
majors, but does not make an effort to
contact any of the other admitted stu
dents. All other calls are made on an indi

vidual basis.
Like Yale and Princeton, Stanford also
targets its admitted minority students in
phone-a-thons. The Black Recruitment
Orientation Committee, Project Motiva
tion and the Stanford American Indian
Organization call admitted black, Latino
and Native American students, respec
tively, to answer questions about minor
ity issues.
Stanford also has a major phone-a
thon that attempts to reach every admit
ted student.
Many schools are also sending per
sonal letters from faculty and students.
"Some departments will write
letters to students who have
already declared majors in those
departments. Often, individual
staff members will follow up
those letters with congratulatory
letters to give the student a per
sonal contact at Yale," said Margit
Dahl, director of undergraduate
admissions at Yale.
At Princeton, each admitted
international student is written a
letter by a current international
student there.
Projects like Stanford's
Prospective Freshmen Week are

considered the most influential in
the process. Although they vary
by name and length, these pro
grams, which allow students to
visit campus, attend classes and
spend a day or two with a current
student, are seen by many schools
as the deciding factor for admit
ted students.
"Obviously only a student can
tell someone what the dorm is
like, what the parties are like.
Admissions officers can't do
that," O'Brien said.
"A large fraction (of the admit
ted students) will not have been
to campus before. We figure we
should organize it so they don't
just land on campus," said Fred
Hargadon, Princeton's dean of
admissions.

Some schools offer discounts
on airfare and train tickets, and
almost all schools have some
money set aside — although a
limited amount — to help pay
travel costs for students with
demonstrated financial need.
Many schools, including Stan
ford, Brown and Yale, offer special
programs for minority students.
In addition, the alumni associ
ations of many colleges and uni
versities sponsor receptions
around the country for admitted
students and their parents.
This year, Stanford held a total
of 19 off-campus receptions and
one on campus. They varied from
one for 300 people in Los Angeles
last week to one in Phoenix with
only nine prospective students.
