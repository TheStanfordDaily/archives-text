Addressing his country's
modernization efforts, Venezue
lan President Carlos Andres
Perez last night stressed the
important influence industrial
ized countries have on the eco
nomic progress of Venezuela
and the rest of Latin America.
Addressing an overflow
crowd at Bishop Auditorium,
Perez said his government's
economic reforms will not suc
ceed unless developed coun
tries, particularly the United
States, drop trade barriers.
Venezuelan economic pro
grams implemented in the last
two years include the lessening
of protectionist policies "which
have impeded economic compe
tition and efficiency" and a
decreasing dependence on oil
exports, which make the econ
omy vulnerable to fluctuating
world prices, he said.
Perez said these programs
have improved the economy in
various ways, including a 50
percent decrease in inflation,
the highest gross domestic
product growth rate in Latin
America and increases in pro
ductive potential and invest
ment opportunities. "Promises
have started to become reality,"
he said.
These internal changes are
not enough to save the economy,
however, he said. Venezuela's
efforts to substitute oil rev
enues with those of its other
main industries — steel, iron,
aluminum and petrochemical
products — are being thwarted
by the lack of openness of the
U.S. economy. Perez said.
