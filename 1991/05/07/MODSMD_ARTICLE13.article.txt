# Bush returns to work, heart rhythm stable

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush returned
to work and put in a full day in the Oval Office yes
terday as his heart resumed a normal rhythm under
medication. "It's great to be back," he said after two
nights in the hospital.
"I'm glad to be here in more ways than one," said
the president, who had been treated for an erratic
heartbeat.
A White House nurse checked him with a heart
monitor just off the Oval Office between meetings.
At the end of the day, Bush's physician, Burton Lee,
said, "No problems of any kind have arisen since he
left the hospital."
The success of drug therapy in treating his prob
lem allowed doctors to shelve plans to use an electri
cal shock procedure to make his heart beat normally.
The procedure would have required Bush to be put
under a general anesthetic and to temporarily trans
fer power to Vice President Dan Quayle.
Bush's doctors recommended that he curtail his
rigorous fitness regimen for a week or so while they
fine-tune the drug dosages needed to keep his heart
beat stable. But they said Bush could resume his
normal business schedule, and he went ahead with
his appointments, including a meeting with former
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
"Feel good," he said during a picture-taking ses
sion with Shevardnadze. With a sweep of his hands
and a whistle, Bush indicated his heartbeat was nor
mal.
"Talk to my doctor, will you?" he said, fending off
further questions. "I'm just glad to be here." Bush,
66, appeared animated, though slightly tired.
"He can be expected to live the same life he was
living last week." said Dr. Allan Ross, chief of cardi
ology at Georgetown University and a member of
Bush's medical team.
Although Bush was responding to medication, his
heart was still beating fast when he was discharged
from Bethesda Naval Hospital, but it returned to
normal shortly thereafter and remained so through
the day, said spokesperson Marlin Fitzwater. Doctors
said they hadn't been pressured to release him pre
maturely.
"It was a pure medical case without any decision
having been made for political or other considera
tions," said Lee, Bush's personal physician, in a
news conference with other members of the medical
team.
Lee said White House chief of staff John Sununu
attended the meeting where doctors decided to
release Bush but "didn't really do much more than
listen."
