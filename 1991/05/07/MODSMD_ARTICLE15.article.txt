CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
— Discovery and its seven astro
nauts returned home safely yes
terday from a long "Star Wars"
research mission, landing in
Florida because of high wind at
the main shuttle touchdown site.
The spaceship glided through a
slightly cloudy sky and touched
down at 2:55 p.m.
"Welcome back to sunny
Florida, and congratulations on
an outstanding mission," Mission
Control's Ken Bowersox told the
crew.
"Thank you, and thank every
body there who worked so hard to

pull this one off," shuttle com
mander Michael Coats replied.
The astronauts circled the
world 134 times and traveled
3,475,000 miles during their eight
days in space. The mission was
the first of eight military shuttle
missions to be conducted without
a news blackout.
The mission encountered sev
eral problems, including the fail
ure of two data recorders.
Nevertheless, Air Force Col.
John Armstrong, deputy mission
director, said he was elated by the
flight's overall success.
He said the research "promises

to be a giant step forward" for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, bet
ter known as "Star Wars," which
is working on designs for a space
defense system.
NASA decided yesterday after
noon to bring Discovery back to
Kennedy Space Center after the
wind picked up suddenly at
Edwards Air Force Base in Cali
fornia, preventing a landing at the
desert base's concrete runway.
Discovery needed to land on a
concrete strip to protect the Pen
tagon's heavy instruments in the
cargo bay and to assure a
smoother landing.
