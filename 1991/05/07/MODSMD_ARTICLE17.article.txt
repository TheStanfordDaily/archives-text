## Joint Greek judiciary 
### 
A JOINT JUDICIAL BOARD
between the Interfraternity
Council and the Intersorority
Council is in the works. Both fra
ternities and sororities on campus
are looking to create a body which
can provide effective self-regula
tion. The IFC judicial board has
worked in this vein throughout the
year, and its future actions will be
greatly enhanced if it joins forces
with the ISC.
If the Greek system on campus
is going to exercise self-regulatory
powers, the source of judicial
authority must be representative
of both fraternities and sororities.
The two genders are equally affect
ed by the issues which confront the
system, such as sexual harassment
and alcohol abuse.
Fraternities and sororities often
participate in events together, like
all-campus parties. While these
events generally take place at a fra
ternity house, both groups organiz

ing the event should be held
responsible for any violations of
the University alcohol policy.
Under the direction of a joint judi
cial body, this would be the case;
fraternal and sororal participants
would be subject to equal treat
ment.
It is important that the Greek
system takes the initiative to regu
late itself. Only under conditions of
self-regulation will it be firmly
rooted in responsible behavior, and
the achievement of this end neces
sitates the joint efforts of the fra
ternities and sororities on campus.
However, these collaborative
efforts will be fruitless if the Uni
versity does not allow the Greeks to
investigate and take responsibility
for their own actions. The adminis
tration should take this initiative
seriously and move toward recog
nizing greater self-regulation on
the part of the Greek system.
