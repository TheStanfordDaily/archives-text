# Carrots to save water
## 
### 
ANEW WATER conservation
program has been introduced
by the Housing Energy Con
servation Center. Through the pro
gram, an award will be given to the
residence with the greatest reduc
tion in per capita water usage by
the end of the quarter. Small prizes
like T-shirts and pizzas will also be
awarded to the weekly leaders.
Such incentives are a good idea
because they offer positive rein
forcement for water conservation.
However, the trivial prizes may
offer little motivation for a long
term change in habits. It is difficult
to imagine T-shirts and pizzas lead
ing individuals to internalize the
need to save water.
If this program is unsuccessful
for the above reason, then the use
of penalties by the University may
prove more effective.
Dorm funds are generally tight,

and the threat of losing some of
those funds would be likely to moti
vate residents to save water when
ever possible. This way, poor habits
would be broken and water conser
vation would indeed be internal
ized.
Still, this program should be
credited with achieving some initial
successes. Both Roth and Whitman
deserve praise for reducing their
water consumption by over 16 per
cent.
The program also rightfully cre
ated a special division between res
idences which can control water
used by food service and those that
can't.
The new water incentive pro
gram is a good idea which should be
promoted throughout campus.
However, if it proves ineffective,
another program utilizing penal
ties should be adopted in its place.
