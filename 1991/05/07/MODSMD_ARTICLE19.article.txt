Grape boycott symbolizes decline of union's power

I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES
at the age of 13 and have been a
grape worker since the age of 18. I
am a former member of the United Farm
Workers union and have been working
against the grape boycott since 1985.
While UFW President Cesar Chavez is
spending considerable time on the col
lege lecture tour boycotting grapes, the
UFW continues to crumble in the fields
of California. For all the evils he per
ceives, Chavez has one answer â€” boycott
grapes. Yet, the UFW neglects to put its
own house in order.
In February 1991, a California
appeals court upheld a judgment against
the UFW for sponsoring violence during
a strike. This judgment, with interest,

has accrued to $2.4 million, a price that
threatens to shut down the UFW.
On Chavez' back every time he travels
are persistent questions about the
UFW's exploitation of certain children
who appear in a video he presents titled:
"Wrath of Grapes."
One child has no arms or legs while
another has had cancer. While scientists
have not determined what created these
unfortunate circumstances, Chavez uses
the unauthorized images to turn the
blame on grapes.
The parents have sued the UFW and
have successfully pursued a court injunc
tion against the video, having never
agreed to be a part of Chavez' lecture cir
cuit.

Then there is the boycott itself.
Chavez alleges that California table
grapes are contaminated with pesticides.
Public safety agencies, however, have
long disputed those claims and in Cali
fornia, 86 percent of grapes tested have
no pesticide residues at all.
While Chavez says that farm worker
injuries due to pesticides justify the
grape boycott, the facts state otherwise.
In 1990, the California Department of
Industrial Relations reported that only 4
percent of injuries in agriculture are due
to pesticides. The vast majority are due
to equipment handling and other factors
which the UFW fails to address.
Most significantly, the UFW has
experienced setbacks in farm worker

elections in California. Today, the UFW
represents less than 12,000 workers
according to agricultural labor
economists at UC-Davis.
While the boycott is the last weapon
of survival for the UFW, it is also a sym
bol of the union's decline.
Revenues from grape boycott speeches
and fund raising appeals are what keep
the UFW going, not farm worker mem
bership dues. Thus, the purpose that the
boycott serves is what former UFW offi
cial Marshall Ganz termed "smoke and
mirrors, words not substance."
