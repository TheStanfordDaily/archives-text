Three Stanford professors were
recently elected to the National Academy
of Sciences, a prestigious organization
that advises the government on science
and technology.
Psychology Prof. David Rumelhart,
Mathematics Prof. Richard Schoen and
Cell Biology Prof. James Spudich are
among 60 new members and 1.5 foreign
associates elected to the academy, which

was founded bv Congress in 1863. The
academy now has a total of 1,903 lifelong
members, including non-voting foreign
associates.
Scientists are nominated by their col
leagues and then are voted in by members
of the academy.
Rumelhart's research has focused on
artificial intelligence. For the past twelve
years he has been working on computer
simulation models that process informa
tion and enable researchers to learn
about human intelligence.

He also studies how, in learning, the
pattern of conductivity changes. He
examines this process through the princi
ple of modification — the idea that a
whole neural network can become better
in dealing with the environment. By sim
ulating a network and environment on a
computer, he watches it adapt and learns
to predict events.
"I'm pleased to be elected. It's a great
honor," he said.
Schoen has concentrated much of his
work on general relativity. One of his

most important accomplishments has
been the derivation of the positive mass
theorem, which states that in any con
ceivable universe, gravitation is an attrac
tive force. This theorem reinforces and
verifies the general theory of relativity.
His work, which also concerns differ
ential geometry, involves mathematically
constructing geometric objects that opti
mize some physical energies. His work is
mainly theoretical — he is more inter
ested in predicting properties of the
shapes rather than making mathematical

models of them.
"I thought I would get in one of these
years. It's a recognition by your peers and
colleagues — that's always nice. You can
be more or less active in the academy — I
don't know my options right now," he
said.
Spudich has been aiming toward two
primary goals involving the study of
myacin, a "molecular motor" protein first
discovered in muscles. To understand
how the protein works in molecu
lar detail, he has created in-vitro
motility assays, which are quanti
tative ways of measuring what it
does. These assays have been the
most important aspect of study
ing the purified protein.
His second goal involves

understanding what roles the
motor plays in cell behavior. By
targeting the myacin gene with a
DNA vector, eliminating it from
the chromosome and observing
how a new cell lacking myacin
behaves, Spudich learns what the
gene can and cannot do.
"I'm obviously delighted to
receive this honor, and it's a great
pleasure to be working at Stan
ford," he said.
