# Punishing faculty for giving advice might create chilling effect
## 
### 
One of the most immediately pressing
issues raised by the Stuart Reges case is
whether advice to students is "speech"
(protected by the First Amendment or its
moral equivalent) or "conduct" (unpro
tected). It is all the more pressing
because University President Donald
Kennedy has come down squarely on the
wrong side of it.
Reges says his conversation with a
student who asked him for advice about
using MDA was speech. Kennedy says it
was conduct and compares it to verbal
sexual harassment. The comparison is
illogical and insulting to anyone who
takes sexual harassment seriously.
Why am I so worried? Because every
instructor who is perceived as even
marginally approachable is regularly
approached by students seeking personal

advice. Even as a teaching assistant, I've
been asked for advice ranging from
"What should I tell my mother about the
fact that I'm failing physics?" to "If I
move into Escondido Village with my
domestic partner, can my department
find out?"
If Kennedy thinks Reges' conversation
about MDA was potentially punishable
conduct, is he going to feel the same way
about my advice to a student to move in
with her lover? Where will he stand if the
government pressures him to do some
thing about a faculty member who has
advised a pregnant student about how to
get an abortion, which is not an unlikely
scenario given recent federal efforts to
limit what doctors can say to their
patients about abortion?
Giving solicited personal advice to stu
dents is almost a necessary part of being
a responsible teacher. Knowing that the
federal government could come after you
for saying the "wrong" thing and that
your institution would back them up is
chilling.
Please President Kennedy, support
your faculty. If a solicited conversation

with a student isn't protected speech,
what is?
