# Reges case brings to light Stanford's need to change president
## 
### 
Stuart Reges has provided the Stan
ford community with evidence of an age
old truth â€” that maturity and common
sense do not necessarily correlate posi
tively with age.
From University President Donald
Kennedy's letter to the editor in The
Daily, it is apparent that one person who
is confused about the difference between
"behavior" and "speech" is Kennedy
himself. Kennedy's rebuttal, that sexual
harassment might under Reges' argu
ments be defended on the basis of "free
dom of speech," is absurd.
Kennedy would like people to believe
that "the University administration"

really does not exist. Perhaps someone
should ask Kennedy if he believes that
the "Saddam Hussein regime" is a "fic
tional monolith."
It is time for us to stop mincing
words. The problem with Stanford's pre
sent leadership is that a boy has been
sent to do a man's job. The latest setback
in the indirect-cost situation in the April
26 Daily suggests that Stanford must
take the kind of drastic action that
occurred at the upper echelons of Lock
heed a few years ago; that is, executive
heads must roll.
The Reges case has brought to light
even more evidence of the inept leader
ship at Stanford. From what I know of
the situation, it appears that the basis
for Reges' firing would be that he gave a
student the wrong advice.
If he is fired for this reason, one could
argue that the Board of Trustees would
be obliged to fire a lot of other people.
It seems to me that, in the Reges case,
dishonor belongs to those who choose to
cast the first stones.
