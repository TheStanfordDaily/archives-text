## Wronging human rights 
### 
Last Friday, george bush
gave the commencement address at
the University of Michigan, dis
cussing the nature and importance of
freedom and assailing the intolerance of
"politically correct" ideologies. It was a
good speech, and I think, few people would
disagree with its message.
Unfortunately, Bush appears to believe
in the maxim "Do as I say, not as I do."
(Translation: You have no right to be as
hypocritical as I am.)
I find it difficult to take seriously a plea
for tolerance by someone who supported a
constitutional amendment against burn
ing the American flag. Nor does Bush's
attempt to scuttle non-governmental
negotiations concerning job discrimina
tion (he insinuates that they would lead
to hiring quotas, although actual experi
ence does not bear this out) speak well for
his open-mindedness.
This issue of freedom of speech and of
thought extends to foreign affairs as well.
China's most-favored-nation status, pro
viding it with valuable trade benefits,
comes up for renewal in a month.
Bush, of course, has a special place in
his heart (perhaps ironically, his heart
started beating irregularly on the same
day he gave the speech cited above) for
China, having been the U.S. envoy there
in the 19705, and he is disposed in favor of
extending the favored status.
But Beijing has recently come under
increasing criticism for its policies deny
ing freedom of expression. Dozens of dis
sidents arrested after the Tiananmen
crackdown still languish in prison,
untried. Tibet is still under illegal occupa

tion and its people are oppressed. Finally,
China uses prisoners as forced labor to
produce consumer products for export. In
part as a result, China's trade surplus
with America is projected to reach $15 bil
lion this year.
At the same time, going easy on Beijing
has become less important of late, as the
perception that China is moving toward
greater political and economic freedoms
has largely evaporated, as has the strate
gic value of playing China against the
Soviet Union.
Under pressure from Congress and
human rights groups, Washington has
only recently begun to signal its displea
sure to Beijing. Several weeks ago, Bush
met with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiri
tual leader and a strong critic of China's
occupation of his country. Last week,
Bush barred the sale of American compo
nents for a Chinese satellite. And this
week, Undersecretary of State Robert
Kimmitt is in Beijing to discuss American
concerns about human rights, trade pol
icy and weapons proliferation.
There is, unfortunately, some concern
that Bush might just be sending these sig
nals in order to inoculate himself against
criticism when he renews Beijing's most
favored-nation status in June.
After all, the United States was one of
the first countries to reopen contacts with
China after Tiananmen when it secretly
sent National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Undersecretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing just a
month later. And last year, Bush ignored
Congressional protests and renewed
China's favored status when it declared it

had released hundreds of political prison
ers seized after June 1989, even though it
offered no specific names or numbers.
Interestingly, former president Jimmy
Carter also favors renewing China's trade
status, arguing that Beijing has made
conciliatory gestures to Chinese students
abroad and that it is time to put Tianan
men behind us. But even if we do put the
1989 massacre itself behind us, that is no
reason to ignore the scores of people
imprisoned during its aftermath, nor does
it excuse the continued oppression of
Tibet or the use of "slave" labor to pro
duce export consumer goods.
China's timely release of a few political
prisoners in May of each year should not
qualify it for continued most-favored
nation status. After all, that would give
Beijing an incentive to keep imprisoning
dissidents as bargaining chips.
Important though relations with
China may be, rewarding its leaders'
hypocrisy with trade benefits worth sev
eral billion dollars annually would simul
taneously underscore the hollowness of
George Bush's commitment to human
rights.
