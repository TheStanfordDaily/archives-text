## Morning glory Card flourishes early before fading to third place 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
For the first 18 holes of the Cal
ifornia Invitational yesterday, the
sixth-ranked Cardinal women's
golf team combined for a 297 to
whip the likes of top-ranked San
Jose State and No. 2 UCLA, each
of whom finished the first round
at 303.
But in the afternoon the wind
began to swirl and the greens
stiffened up on the Stanford Golf
Course. The result was that the
Cardinal saw what had been a six
stroke lead over the Spartans and
Bruins completely disintegrate.
UCLA converted its deficit into a
20-stroke lead over San Jose
State, bettering the Cardinal
linksters by 23 strokes on the day.
"UCLA just blew our ass
away," Cardinal coach Tim Bald
win said. "They played the best
any female golf team has ever
played on this course considering
the wind and the greens."
In the second half of the 36-
hole day, UCLA shot a 290, which
only amplified the falterings of
San Jose State and the Cardinal.
The Spartans shot a 310 and
Stanford came in at 319.
Entering the second round
after a spectacular first 18 holes,
the Cardinal thought that it had a
legitimate shot to take the title.
"We definitely should beat
them on our own course because
we know it," said junior Audrey
Wooding.
However, reality set in Monday
night.
"I'd be very much satisfied
with a win over San Jose State,"
Baldwin said. "They're tops in the
country and it would be a feather
in our cap to beat them.
"To beat San Jose State, we're
going to have to shoot a little bet
ter than we shot this morning.
We're probably going to have to
hit something like a 295."
Today's early morning play
should come to the advantage of
the hard-hitting Cardinal squad.
The greens will be soft and there
should not be much wind.
"This course will be friendly,"
said Baldwin. "We will be able, to
attack it."
Yesterday afternoon the course
was not very amiable to the Cardi
nal. "I hit some shots that I've
never seen bounce as high in my
life," said Wooding. "On the sixth
(hole), the ball took a skyrocket
bounce and if it didn't hit the flag
it would've been off of the green
— it was pathetic."
"Hitting 15-footers that ripped
by the hole" in the afternoon,
Wooding wound up shooting seven
over par for the second round. She

lost the lead she had shared after
shooting 72 for the first 18, but
her overall score of 152 still left
her in contention, in fifth place,
six strokes behind the co-leaders
Lisa Kiggens and Laßee Sugg of
UCLA.
"Audrey had a terrific first
round," said Baldwin. "But 1
thought that she played better in
the afternoon. I didn't see her hit
any bogeys in the time that I
watched her."
Junior Adele Moore finished
just one stroke behind Wooding
with a 153 on the day, carding a 74
and a 79. Moore is tied in seventh
with Tracy Hanson of San Jose
State and Liz Bowman of UCLA.
Making her final appearance
on the Stanford Golf Course as a
Cardinal, senior Jodi Figley shot a

total of 154, faltering with an 81
after stroking a dazzling even par
in the morning.
"1 hit the ball great in the sec
ond round, hut 1 had three bad
holes — two double bogeys and a
Stephanie Davis had the most sta
ble day with a 78 and a 79, but she
was disappointed with her usually
solid short game.
"1 hit the ball fine, I just
couldn't putt," Davis said. "I got a
little over-confident — 1 went for
birdies but ended up with bogeys.
1 three-putted a lot. Any bad
bounce I could get, 1 got."
Bad bounces also tortured
junior Martha Richards all day en
route to an 81 and an 89. "I played
a lot better than an 89," Richards
said. "You just have days like that
in golf."


Audrey Wooding blistered the Stanford Golf Course yesterday
morning, shooting a 72 to grab the individual lead. She, and her
teammates, didn't fare as well in the afternoon round, however, and
Wooding now stands in sixth entering today's final round.
