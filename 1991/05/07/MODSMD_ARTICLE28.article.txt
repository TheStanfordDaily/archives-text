Streaks, records and three
mind-boggling achieve
ments are in the news
these days: Two major-league
records fell last Wednesday, and
this upcoming weekend at Stan
ford could see another record —
most NCAA women's tennis
titles in a row — extended yet
again.
You've probably heard about
the baseball records — one of
them because it was hyped,
hyped, hyped by (who else?) Bay
Area newspapers for over a
month, the other because it's
one of the most stupefying
pitching achievements ever.
Mr. Hype is Rickey Hender
son, who finally broke Lou
Brock's career stolen-base
record; Mr. Stupefying is Nolan
Ryan, who threw his seventh
career no-hitter. On the same
night.
Rickey's run at Brock's
record had, of course, been
played up for week after nause
ating week as the hugest thing
to happen to baseball since some
genius figured catchers should
probably wear masks. And so,
after all the buildup, on a night
which Rickey would have loved
to own ... a balding, slightly
overweight 44-year-old pitcher
who looks like the guy at the
hardware store steals his thun
der.
1 loved it.
Poor Rickey. Heck, he can't
get away from Nolan: Last year
the Swift One had the dubious
honor of being the Swifter One's
5000 th strikeout victim. (By the
way, Rickey is batting .143 (2-
for-14) lifetime against Nolan.)
Rickey is flash, lots of talk
and a hell of a lot of speed;
Nolan is simplicity, not much
talk and a hell of a lot of speed.
Somehow, the Bay Area
papers captured the night just
right. There was Rickey at the
top of the front page, holding his
arms up in the air; there he was
at the top of the sports page,
under a gigantic headline, with
huge color photos of him mak
ing the steal and then exulting .
. . . and there was Nolan at
the bottom nf the nnr<\ TTo got n
simple "bv the way" mention on
the front page, and in the sports
section there was one plain
black-and white picture. No
flash, just domination. Can you
see Rickey stealing bases at age
44?
This year, Rickey almost
tainted his moment in the sun
by whining all spring about
making only $3 mil per season.
So what happens? It takes him a

month to get the last three
steals to break the record. And,
when he finally does it, it's on
the same night as something
much, much more incredible
accomplished by someone who
made $7,000 his rookie season.
Right on.

Of course, Rickey's record is
amazing, and of course, it will be
quite awhile before someone
even approaches it. But some
day, a very fast young man is
going to show up, start stealing
bases like nobody's business . . .
and Rickey will be history.
No one, however, will ever
throw seven no-hitters again. In
over 100 years of baseball, only
one other man has thrown as
many as four.
And 5,361 strikeouts? Look
at it this way: For a pitcher to
catch Nolan's K record he would
have to rack up 265 strikeouts a
year — approximately one per
inning — for 20 years.
The major-league record for
most seasons averaging at least
one K per inning is 15, held by
(surprise) Nolan Ryan. Sandy
Koufax — who had those four
no-hitters — is second on the
seasons-with-a-K-per-inning
list.
With seven.
Anyone wanna bet on some
one ever catching up?
Incredible as they may be,
Rickey and Nolan are last
week's news. This week,
there's another streak in the
news and another record for the
taking — right here at Stanford.
The streak, of course, is the
Stanford women's tennis team's
five straight NCAA titles. Yes,
five in a row. Yes, that's a lot,
considering there have only
-
How dominant is the Cardi
nal? The last time it didn't win
(he NCAA championship, "Back
to the Future" (the good one)
had just been released, Huey
Lewis was the hottest thing
around and Dan Quayle was a
nobody.
Actually, scratch that last
thought. Some things don't
change.
Let's just say it's been a

while. Yes, I know, it does seem
it would get a tad boring for
coach Frank Brennan to bring
home a trophy year after year —
How many slabs of wood does a
man need? — but for some rea
son the women's netters keep
doing it.
Now that I think about it,
though, it's a good thing they've
got all those trophies . . . 'cuz
there ain't no way they can win
this year.
Sorry. Not a chance. Haven't
you heard about The Curse? In
the nine years that the NCAA
has sanctioned the women's
tennis tournament, no team
that's hosted the event has ever
won the championship. In fact,
before Florida made it to the
title match last year — only to
get shellacked by the Cardinal
— no host team had even made
it past the semifinals.
Guess who's hosting this
year.
You got it — and, by the way,
you should probably get your
tickets to Sunday's finals as fast
as you can. For, barring a major
catastrophe (like, say, half of
Stanford's lineup spontaneously
combusting), the Cardinal will
be playing Florida for the title.
Now, before anyone gets car
ried away worrying about The
Curse, let's remember that a
huge reason no host has ever
won is that the Cardinal has
usually been a hell of a lot better
than everyone else, including
whoever happened to be host
ing. In fact, the only time a host
team didn't make it as far as
they should have was in 1989,
when Florida lost in the semis
while looking ahead to play
Stanford in the final match.
This year, Stanford's women
should have no trouble making
the finals — but, once there,
they'll have to fight a team that,
believe it or not, might be better.
The Florida team, after all, is
the one that broke Stanford's
76-match win streak into a mil
lion pieces in March, when the
Gators sent the Cardinal pack
ing 6-0 in the National Indoors.
Six-love. Add in a little extra
incentive — like, say, the fact
that tfiey've lost in the finals
two of the last three years and
have never won a team title —
and you've got a bunch of angry
Gators.
Or a bunch of cockv ones.
After all, it's Stanford — and
not Florida — that has some
thing to prove this weekend,
because it's been a looong time
