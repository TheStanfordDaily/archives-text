# Graham hopes to double her success at this year's NCAAs
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The little girl first picked up a
racket at age 9. She had
seen her father play at the
community center and thought
the game looked like fun. A little
bored and looking for something
to do, the girl would go to the play
ground with a friend and they
would try to play tennis.
One day, the father saw his
daughter swinging away and
sensed she was enjoying herself.
"If you like tennis," he said, "then
we should get you some lessons."
For the girl, it was a hobby. No
big deal. She was simply learning
something new, like how to play
the piano, for instance.
At first, she was put in a group
with the other kids. A few onlook
ers thought the girl had some
aptitude and recommended she
get private teaching. The parents
had no objections. The daughter
seemed happy. Why not?
She was no imposing figure on
the tennis court."I was really
small when I was little," she says.
But tennis wasn't her only ath
letic endeavor. She was a swimmer
and a gymnast as well.
The other sports began to wear
on her after a while though. "I
wasn't into swimming because I
hated to get up early," she says,
adding that jumping into cold
water was no great thrill, either.
Gymnastics lost its appeal when
one of the girls fell from the paral
lel bars while practicing flips. She
landed on her neck and was para
lyzed.
By now, the girl was 14 and was
considered a rising star in junior
tennis. Her parents weren't
putting any pressure on her, but
they did begin to realize tennis
might take their daughter some
where — to college. They hoped
their child might earn a scholar
ship to a small state school some
day.
Never did the parents imagine
their daughter would play for a

tennis power, a or Stan
ford. She remembers dad telling
her, "Ifl could get a scholarship to
Stanford, he'd buy me any car
that I wanted."
As a high school junior, the
girl made others stand up
and take notice. For
starters, she had grown, to about
5-foot-10. She was also ranked in
the top echelon of junior tennis
and was invited to the junior
French Open, junior Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open. Everybody
who follows these things had
heard about the girl from Foun
tain Valley, Calif., Debbie Graham.
And Debbie Graham knew she
wanted to go to Stanford Univer
sity. It wasn't the car she was
after, either. She was seeking a
great education, a chance to play
tennis with the best and an oppor
tunity to be a regular person.
Most college coaches knew of
her desire and didn't bother to
recruit her. But California figured
it was worth a shot. Instead of
confusing Graham, though, the
trip to Berkeley only strengthened
her resolve to wear the Cardinal
and White.
Says Graham: "They didn't
care about my grades and SATs.
They said, 'You can pick and
choose whoever you want to live
with.' " Graham didn't want the
special treatment. "There are so
many talented people here," she
says. "Nobody sticks out."
Well, maybe not nobody. Now a
6-foot tall junior, Graham is hard
to miss, especially on the court.
She already has been a key con
tributor to two national team
champions, reached the finals of
the NCAA doubles tournament
with partner Sandra Birch the
past two years and captured the
NCAA singles crown in 1990.
For many, that title might have
served as a farewell to college ten
nis. At the end of last year repre
sentatives from the United States
Tennis Association told Graham:
"You've already done what you

need to in college." In other
words, they suggested she leave
school and join the pro circuit.
Graham wasn't ready yet. She
played in a pro tournament nearly
every week last summer and was
looking forward to school by the
time autumn rolled around. "I
wanted to be a normal person,"
she says."I was so tired of living
out of suitcases."
There were at least two other
mitigating concerns as well. First,
Graham wants very much to get
her degree and graduate with her
class. She doesn't want to come

back to Stanford as a 28 year old,
socially isolated, to finish her
schoolwork. Second, she has a
strong sense of her own mortality.
While she is not haunted by the
vision of the injured gymnast,
Graham nonetheless is aware of
the fragility of the athlete's exis
tence; she knows tennis is not for
ever. Currently, she is suffering
from tendinitis in her shoulder
which has limited her ability to
play this year. At school, she gets
free treatment for the injury.
"Everyone takes care of me here,"
Graham says. Furthermore, at

the end of next year she'll have a
college degree for when her tennis
career ends,
Still, there was a moment
where Graham regretted the deci
sion. When the team played its
challenge matches to determine
the lineup, she wound up at No. 2,
behind Sandra Birch. It was the
third straight year Graham felt
she should have been higher and
she readily admits she wasn't
happy about coach Frank Bren
nan's decision.
"I wanted to play No. 1 for
Stanford before I left," she says.

"I was very, very disappointed."
Especially in herself. Graham was
up 5-3 in third set of her challenge
match against Birch. The top spot
was one game away. And she
choked. "The pressure of being
No. 1 finally hit me," she says.
Her mind began racing: "Oh my
God, I'm No. 1, I'm going to win. I
should win." She began to wonder
how long her dual-match winning
streak would continue in the spot
light of No. 1.
In her first two years, Graham
had not lost in team competition.
Through the early part of the sea
son, she had pushed the run to 55
straight wins. Her place in the
lineup eventually played a key role
in ending the streak. Graham
began to have second thoughts
about staying at school. "Why am
I doing this?" she thought, and it
began to affect her play. "I lost a
dual match because I was think
ing about numbers too much," she
says.
The loss came on Feb. 16 at the
hands of California's Emilie
Viqueira, a player who shouldn't
have defeated her. "Two weeks
before, I beat her oh and oh," Gra
ham remembers. For Graham,
The Streak was not very impor
tant while it lasted. Playing pri
marily third and fourth singles,
she figured she should win all the
time. But she acknowledges it was
fun while it lasted and that it
secures her place in college tennis
history.
Graham would like to do that
one more time by winning a sec
ond singles title this year or next.
She also would love to break
through and win the doubles tour
nament. She and Birch have
reached the finals twice and, with
Birch graduating, have just one
more chance. "I really want to win
for Sandra this year," she says.
She wants it so badly because
the two have been playing
together for so long, and this
could be the end of the line. Years

After winning an NCAA singles title and two team titles In her first two years, Debbie Graham has even
loftier goals this year. She hopes to help her team to another team crown and teams with Sandra Birch
to win the doubles championship. She will also probably be the second seed, behind Birch, in the sin
gles tournament.
ago, in the juniors, current Pep
perdine star Noelle Porter sug
gested they pair up at the U.S
Hardcourt event. Birch and Gra
ham ended up winning that tour
nament and have been a success
ever since.
For her own part, Graham's
best times are no doubt ahead of
her. In Philadelphia last August,
she had a match point against
Monica Seles before falling. With
Graham's big serve and powerful
groundstrokes, she could be one of
the best there is someday.
Asst. coach Lele Forood, who
has developed a friendship with
Graham and is a former pro,
thinks Graham's upside potential

is great. "Toward the end of last
year, she started to have a certain
poise and composure," Forood
says, explaining that Graham now
exudes confidence on the court.
When you look like you're sure
that you will win, Forood says,
"People will lose to you. You don't
have to beat them as much."
Forood adds that while Gra
ham is ready for pro tennis,
another year in school will do her
well. "Is she ready to be a top-10
player in the world? Not yet. Does
she have the potential? Abso
lutely!"
At Stanford, Forood explains,
Graham can get the coaching she
needs and get "more match play
where she's not playing (Steffi)
Graf and Seles." The idea, of
course, is that her time here will
prepare to not just to play Graf
and Seles, but maybe even to beat
them.

Tennis Association told Graham:
"You've already done what you

need to in college." In other
words, they suggested she leave
school and join the pro circuit.
Graham wasn't ready yet. She
played in a pro tournament nearly
every week last summer and was
looking forward to school by the
time autumn rolled around. "I
wanted to be a normal person,"
she says."I was so tired of living
out of suitcases."
There were at least two other
mitigating concerns as well. First,
Graham wants very much to get
her degree and graduate with her
class. She doesn't want to come

back to Stanford as a 28 year old,
socially isolated, to finish her
schoolwork. Second, she has a
strong sense of her own mortality.
While she is not haunted by the
vision of the injured gymnast,
Graham nonetheless is aware of
the fragility of the athlete's exis
tence; she knows tennis is not for
ever. Currently, she is suffering
from tendinitis in her shoulder
which has limited her ability to
play this year. At school, she gets
free treatment for the injury.
"Everyone takes care of me here,"
Graham says. Furthermore, at

the end of next year she'll have a
college degree for when her tennis
career ends,
Still, there was a moment
where Graham regretted the deci
sion. When the team played its
challenge matches to determine
the lineup, she wound up at No. 2,
behind Sandra Birch. It was the
third straight year Graham felt
she should have been higher and
she readily admits she wasn't
happy about coach Frank Bren
nan's decision.
"I wanted to play No. 1 for
Stanford before I left," she says.

"I was very, very disappointed."
Especially in herself. Graham was
up 5-3 in third set of her challenge
match against Birch. The top spot
was one game away. And she
choked. "The pressure of being
No. 1 finally hit me," she says.
Her mind began racing: "Oh my
God, I'm No. 1, I'm going to win. I
should win." She began to wonder
how long her dual-match winning
streak would continue in the spot
light of No. 1.
In her first two years, Graham
had not lost in team competition.
Through the early part of the sea
son, she had pushed the run to 55
straight wins. Her place in the
lineup eventually played a key role
in ending the streak. Graham
began to have second thoughts
about staying at school. "Why am
I doing this?" she thought, and it
began to affect her play. "I lost a
dual match because I was think
ing about numbers too much," she
says.
The loss came on Feb. 16 at the
hands of California's Emilie
Viqueira, a player who shouldn't
have defeated her. "Two weeks
before, I beat her oh and oh," Gra
ham remembers. For Graham,
The Streak was not very impor
tant while it lasted. Playing pri
marily third and fourth singles,
she figured she should win all the
time. But she acknowledges it was
fun while it lasted and that it
secures her place in college tennis
history.
Graham would like to do that
one more time by winning a sec
ond singles title this year or next.
She also would love to break
through and win the doubles tour
nament. She and Birch have
reached the finals twice and, with
Birch graduating, have just one
more chance. "I really want to win
for Sandra this year," she says.
She wants it so badly because
the two have been playing
together for so long, and this
could be the end of the line. Years

After winning an NCAA singles title and two team titles In her first two years, Debbie Graham has even
loftier goals this year. She hopes to help her team to another team crown and teams with Sandra Birch
to win the doubles championship. She will also probably be the second seed, behind Birch, in the sin
gles tournament.
ago, in the juniors, current Pep
perdine star Noelle Porter sug
gested they pair up at the U.S
Hardcourt event. Birch and Gra
ham ended up winning that tour
nament and have been a success
ever since.
For her own part, Graham's
best times are no doubt ahead of
her. In Philadelphia last August,
she had a match point against
Monica Seles before falling. With
Graham's big serve and powerful
groundstrokes, she could be one of
the best there is someday.
Asst. coach Lele Forood, who
has developed a friendship with
Graham and is a former pro,
thinks Graham's upside potential

is great. "Toward the end of last
year, she started to have a certain
poise and composure," Forood
says, explaining that Graham now
exudes confidence on the court.
When you look like you're sure
that you will win, Forood says,
"People will lose to you. You don't
have to beat them as much."
Forood adds that while Gra
ham is ready for pro tennis,
another year in school will do her
well. "Is she ready to be a top-10
player in the world? Not yet. Does
she have the potential? Abso
lutely!"
At Stanford, Forood explains,
Graham can get the coaching she
needs and get "more match play
where she's not playing (Steffi)
Graf and Seles." The idea, of
course, is that her time here will
prepare to not just to play Graf
and Seles, but maybe even to beat
them.
The little girl first picked up a
racket at age 9. She had
seen her father play at the
community center and thought
the game looked like fun. A little
bored and looking for something
to do, the girl would go to the play
ground with a friend and they
would try to play tennis.
One day, the father saw his
daughter swinging away and
sensed she was enjoying herself.
"If you like tennis," he said, "then
we should get you some lessons."
For the girl, it was a hobby. No
big deal. She was simply learning
something new, like how to play
the piano, for instance.
At first, she was put in a group
with the other kids. A few onlook
ers thought the girl had some
aptitude and recommended she
get private teaching. The parents
had no objections. The daughter
seemed happy. Why not?
She was no imposing figure on
the tennis court."I was really
small when I was little," she says.
But tennis wasn't her only ath
letic endeavor. She was a swimmer
and a gymnast as well.
The other sports began to wear
on her after a while though. "I
wasn't into swimming because I
hated to get up early," she says,
adding that jumping into cold
water was no great thrill, either.
Gymnastics lost its appeal when
one of the girls fell from the paral
lel bars while practicing flips. She
landed on her neck and was para
lyzed.
By now, the girl was 14 and was
considered a rising star in junior
tennis. Her parents weren't
putting any pressure on her, but
they did begin to realize tennis
might take their daughter some
where — to college. They hoped
their child might earn a scholar
ship to a small state school some
day.
Never did the parents imagine
their daughter would play for a

tennis power, a or Stan
ford. She remembers dad telling
her, "Ifl could get a scholarship to
Stanford, he'd buy me any car
that I wanted."
As a high school junior, the
girl made others stand up
and take notice. For
starters, she had grown, to about
5-foot-10. She was also ranked in
the top echelon of junior tennis
and was invited to the junior
French Open, junior Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open. Everybody
who follows these things had
heard about the girl from Foun
tain Valley, Calif., Debbie Graham.
And Debbie Graham knew she
wanted to go to Stanford Univer
sity. It wasn't the car she was
after, either. She was seeking a
great education, a chance to play
tennis with the best and an oppor
tunity to be a regular person.
Most college coaches knew of
her desire and didn't bother to
recruit her. But California figured
it was worth a shot. Instead of
confusing Graham, though, the
trip to Berkeley only strengthened
her resolve to wear the Cardinal
and White.
Says Graham: "They didn't
care about my grades and SATs.
They said, 'You can pick and
choose whoever you want to live
with.' " Graham didn't want the
special treatment. "There are so
many talented people here," she
says. "Nobody sticks out."
Well, maybe not nobody. Now a
6-foot tall junior, Graham is hard
to miss, especially on the court.
She already has been a key con
tributor to two national team
champions, reached the finals of
the NCAA doubles tournament
with partner Sandra Birch the
past two years and captured the
NCAA singles crown in 1990.
For many, that title might have
served as a farewell to college ten
nis. At the end of last year repre

After winning an NCAA singles title and two team titles In her first two years, Debbie Graham has even
loftier goals this year. She hopes to help her team to another team crown and teams with Sandra Birch
to win the doubles championship. She will also probably be the second seed, behind Birch, in the sin
gles tournament.
ago, in the juniors, current Pep
perdine star Noelle Porter sug
gested they pair up at the U.S
Hardcourt event. Birch and Gra
ham ended up winning that tour
nament and have been a success
ever since.
For her own part, Graham's
best times are no doubt ahead of
her. In Philadelphia last August,
she had a match point against
Monica Seles before falling. With
Graham's big serve and powerful
groundstrokes, she could be one of
the best there is someday.
Asst. coach Lele Forood, who
has developed a friendship with
Graham and is a former pro,
thinks Graham's upside potential

is great. "Toward the end of last
year, she started to have a certain
poise and composure," Forood
says, explaining that Graham now
exudes confidence on the court.
When you look like you're sure
that you will win, Forood says,
"People will lose to you. You don't
have to beat them as much."
Forood adds that while Gra
ham is ready for pro tennis,
another year in school will do her
well. "Is she ready to be a top-10
player in the world? Not yet. Does
she have the potential? Abso
lutely!"
At Stanford, Forood explains,
Graham can get the coaching she
needs and get "more match play
where she's not playing (Steffi)
Graf and Seles." The idea, of
course, is that her time here will
prepare to not just to play Graf
and Seles, but maybe even to beat
them.
