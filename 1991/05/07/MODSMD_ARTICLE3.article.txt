# ASSU to start Friday Flicks
##

Flicks fans will be able to attend movies
two nights a week when a new ASSU busi
ness project, Friday Classic Flicks, begins
next year.
The. ASSU is also "looking at the feasi
bility" of implementing a plan for a used
music exchange, said Financial Manager
Torrence Boone.
Junior Bob Florsheim, current project
manager for Sunday Flicks, submitted the
proposal for the Friday film series. "Clas
sics" include older movies such as
"Casablanca," but "it does not have to be

old to be a classic," Florsheim said.
For example, he said he would consider
"The Princess Bride," which he showed on
a Sunday this year, a classic. But Friday
Classics will not be movies that are less
than four or five years old, he said.
Newer movies are too expensive, and the
project "was conceived so it would not con
flict with Sunday Flicks," he added.
Florsheim said he believes the reason
Sunday Flicks are so popular is that there is
only one other film society on campus,
Tuesday Films, which is "more avant
garde." Most schools have several groups
showing movies, he said.
No definite plans for running
the new project have been made.
Boone said a proposal for a
Stanford Music Exchange is also
being examined. The exchange
would carry used tapes, records
and compact discs. "We need to
figure out whether the profitabil
ity of the project is on line with
what we need it to be," he said.
The project was conceived
independently by two students,
sophomore Shao-Pow Lin and
junior Holly Deal, who later com
bined their ideas in a joint pro
posal.
Lin said he has had the idea for
a music store since last year,
when he noticed there was a "lack
of sources" for people without

cars. "I imagine [the exchange!
would be in demand," he said.
Although their proposal may
not ultimately be implemented,
Lin and Deal will share half of the
$500 prize for conceiving the idea,
while Florsheim will receive the
remaining $250.
Boone said he received 16 pro
posals for new projects this year.
"I felt that the proposals submit
ted were quite impressive and
very thorough," he added.
One possible project, a video
store, was eliminated because it
was "realized early on that the
initial capital expenditure was
foreboding" and there would be a
problem finding space for the
store, Boone said.
A book-buying service for stu
dents who did not want to stand
in line at the Bookstore was also
considered, but Boone said there
were questions about how many
people would use the service.
