# Men's crew takes a giant step
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
After working hard and
patiently waiting for the rewards
all season, the men's crew team
made its big move this Sunday
against a large field of competitive
teams. Although Stanford did not
come away with any first-place
finishes, the Cardinal boats con
sistently finished in competitive
second and third spots, only sec
onds off the lead.
The varsity eight took a close
second-place finish to its tradi
tional nemesis UCLA, beating out
Santa Clara, UC-San Diego,
Sacramento State and UC-Irvine
in the process. The fact that Stan
ford was able to stay with UCLA,
one of the best teams in the coun
try, proved that coach Wieslaw
Kujda's training strategy for the
season is paying off.
"I was very, very pleased with
the performance of the whole
team," Kujda said. "As we get
closer to the main race (the Pacific
10 Championships), we are over
the hill and accelerating very

hard. Our average speed is five
seconds faster than last year, so
we're showing a lot of improve
ment. I think we're going to do
extremely well at Pac-lOs."
Senior Tom Beischer agreed
that things began to click for the
team this weekend. "We would
have liked to have won, but the
speed we achieved was the speed
we really should've gotten last
week against Cal," he said. "Now
it'll make it a lot easier for us to go
fast at Pac-lOs."
The junior varsity eight fin
ished its race third behind Orange
Coast College and UCLA, but the
final margin between the Cardinal
and the winner was again a slim 2
1/2 seconds.
"It was a really close race,"
senior Greg Fluet said. "We had a
slow start, and we were down on
Coast and UCLA by about seven
seats at the beginning. But we
came back on them during the
middle 1000 meters, and we were
only half a seat down on UCLA
and four seats down on Coast
coming into the sprint. At the end
we just didn't really redline like

we should have, so we didn't get a
last surge in."
The outlook for the JV team is
good, however. "It is totally clear
that we can pick up another five
or six seconds, because we were
understroking the other boats. We
were at 33 1/2 (strokes per
minute), while they were at 35 or
36," Fluet said.
Continuing the trend of the
day, the freshman and novice
eights finished second behind
OCC by less than a boat length.
The freshman eight brought the
race down to the wire, finally
being edged out by .1 second. This
was a large improvement over the
15-second margin that separated
the teams at the San Diego
regatta earlier in the season.
"We had a few changes in the
boat and we happened to row bet
ter than we did at San Diego,"
freshman Matt Woelburn said.
"Right now OCC and Cal are the
teams to beat, and we've finished
within a second of both of them.
We haven't even reached our full
potential, but we're hoping that
they have."
