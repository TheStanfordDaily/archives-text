# For the record
## 
### 
An article in yesterday's Daily
inaccurately reported the amount
of money the Beta fraternity owes
the University. The correct debt is
$8,397, based upon $933 rent
from nine vacant rooms.
An article appearing in the

Campus Bulletin on May 1 gave
incorrect information about the
Dresdener Bank. It is a western
German bank which is now start
ing branches in eastern Germany.
The bank's president described
the accounting practices of east
ern German bureaucrats as simi
lar to those of an organized crime
family.
