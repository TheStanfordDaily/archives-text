# Panel asks: What constitutes free speech?
## 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld Staff writer 
The Fundamental Standard interpretation
restricting "fighting words" was one of the
issues addressed in a panel discussion on hate
speech and political correctness last night at
the Center for Educational Research at Stan
ford.
Dennis Matthies, a member of the panel
and resident fellow in Otero, had to deal with
a May 1988 incident in his dorm which was
instrumental in prompting the University to
revise its interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard.
He presented a worst-case scenario based
on this incident: "It's late in the year. You've
had a lot of bad-boy behavior during the year.
As a group [the offendersl are pretty tight,
they're fairly large and they intimidate most of
the rest of the dorm. Their peer group is fra

ternities.
"The dormitory is split in two. The majority
of the residents scared into silence. The inci
dent then occurs.
"They address another member of the dorm
as a faggot. They insist they have a right to live
in a hallway that is free of faggots," Matthies
concluded.
Panelist Shauna Jackson, former president
of the Stanford Law Review, responded to this
scenario saying that such actions would pre
vent students from participating in the life of
their dormitoiy or community.
Law School Prof. William Cohen argued
that the rules for Stanford residences are not
necessarily the same as for private homes and
that the current Fundamental Standard policy
at Stanford is "designed to defend students on
a one-on-one basis from insulting epithets."
He added that he believes many people are
unsure about the policy and that the "regula

tion has done more bad than good."
The panelists also discussed "political cor
rectness."
"Yes, it's there," answered Matthies, when
asked whether there was a political orthodoxy
on campus.
Jackson recognized the existence of a "lan
guage of PC" and that people might hesitate to
speak for fear of accidentally saying the wrong
words and being labeled racist or insensitive.
But she added that she finds it hard to sym
pathize with those people because she doesn't
see any harm done to them.
Cohen, however, said he deplored the fact
that "some ideas simply don't get expressed
because it is too great a hassle to take an
unpopular position."
Me said the underlying question is how a
private university such as Stanford, which can
make its own rules about free speech, must
react to these issues.
