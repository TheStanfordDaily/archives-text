"I met her in a hotel lobby mas
turbating with a magazine. ..."
Reading this and other lyrics
from Prince's song "Darling
Nikki," U.S. District Judge James
Ware opened a debate yesterday
on the issues of "Protected
Expression in the Arts and
Music." Ware and a group of pan
elists spoke in Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge before a gathering of
about 60 educators, students and
community members.
The debate was part of the
First Amendment Challenges
Today conference hosted by the
California Forum of the National
Amendment Congress and the
Department of Communication.
Approximately 200 leaders
from bench, bar, media, education
and advocacy groups assembled to
examine and debate current
threats to the First Amendment
in eight separate forums.
"Minority viewpoints must be
protected, and thus the govern
ment may not restrict expression
for its messages, its ideas, its sub
ject matter or its content," Ware
said. "But there are those who
would disagree. There are those
who feel that we have gone too far,
that there are limits to the funda
mental guarantee."
He asked James Bernard, an
editor and writer on hip-hop
music, culture and politics, if he
felt there was a need for addi
tional control over these types of
messages when they are broadcast
to children.
Bernard, who throughout the
debate stressed that music is not
to blame for problems like suicide
among today's youth, responded,
"We don't need controls. We need
discussions. We need to talk about
these things openly and honestly.
These kids will pick these things
up on the playground, and we
need to affirmatively prepare
them to deal with it."
Ware also questioned KZSU
Assoc. Program Director Sam
Wang about whether the radio
station would play controversial
songs and about what responsibil
ity it has for what it plays.
In response, Wang argued that
lyrics of controversial songs must
be taken in the context of the big-

'We don't need con
trols. We need dis
cussions.'

ger picture.
Many rap groups, he explained,
are making political or social com
mentaries, and it is often hard for
"white America" to accept the lan
guage the artists use. Wang said
he feels these songs must be aired
in order to encourage discussions
about taboo or sensitive issues.
David Llewellyn, president of
the Western Center for Law and
Religious Freedom and the
panel's lone conservative voice,
challenged the presumption that
all ideas are fundamentally equal.
He said he fears graphic lyrics in
music may be associated with
aberrant behavior in children and
that they have contributed to a
"moral shift" in this country.
Madonna, Llewellyn said, is
doing more than expressing ideas
in her videos; she is showing chil
dren acts to mimic.
Prof. Don Roberts, chair of
Stanford's Department of Com
munication, agreed that music
may negatively influence "fringe
kids," but said such children are a
very small proportion of the audi
ence. Roberts also criticized a
study, quoted by Llewellyn, that
concluded that children were
more likely to engage in early sex
ual activity if exposed to explicit
music videos.
Panelist Margie O'Driscoll, act
ing director of the San Francisco
Arts Commission, who works to
foster government and business
support for artistic display and
performances, mentioned specific
art exhibits that have gained noto
riety from attempts to suppress
them. After an exhibit of Robert
Mapplethorpe's photographs was
banned in a Cleveland museum,
the show broke attendance
records at a Berkeley gallery.
"Once an organization [or artistl
gets attacked," O'Driscoll said,
"their popularity increases."
Roberts summarized the
debate by saying, "If an idea
doesn't bother someone, it's prob
ably not a good idea."
