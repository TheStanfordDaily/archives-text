# Writer speaks of pressures against negative journalism
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Journalist Tom Wicker, whose novel "On
Press" is required reading in college jour
nalism classes around the nation, spoke to a
half-filled Kresge Auditorium last night on
forces that are "Nibbling at the First
Amendment."
Wicker's speech was the 26th annual
Carlos McClatchy Memorial Lecture, spon
sored by the Department of Communica
tion. It coincided with a day of programs,
titled "First Amendment Challenges
Today," sponsored by the California First
Amendment Coalition, the First Amend
ment Congress and the Communication
Department.

The annual McClatchy lecture is
designed to give students a firsthand look
at the field of communication. Last night's
audience, however, consisted primarily of
elderly citizens familiar with Wicker's work
over the past four decades.
Wicker is the only person to deliver the
McClatchy lecture twice. His first speech,
19 years ago, was titled "Whose Freedom
Next?"
The speaker opened the evening by
detailing the pressure he has received from
readers about his opinions on national and
world events. Me said that because he did
not support the Persian Gulf war, he
received mail which said "be patriotic for a
change" and "get your head out of
the sand." But he added that he
did not receive his usual "go back
to Kussia where I belong" letter.
Recalling the Watergate scan
dal, Wicker said writers who
would not write negatively about
Richard Nixon were pressured
"not to write anything at all."
Wicker's journalism career
spans 40 years, and he has pub
lished eight novels. Currently he
is an associate editor of The New
York Times and writes that
paper's "In the nation" column.
The central theme of Wicker's
speech was how First Amend
ment rights were being "nibbled
away," but never eaten whole.
"The subject that concerns me
the most is freedom of expression
on university campuses," he said.
"A university is a model of
openness and exploration of free
dom of expression and ideas," he
said. "Reasonable rules (govern
ing censorship) need to be estab
lished without stifling ideas."
Sidestepping a potentially
touchy subject, Wicker said he
would avoid getting into specific
problems at Stanford but added
that "political correctness" is
plaguing the nation's campuses.
"Political correctness has too
little openness," he said. "Some
ideas are politically correct, while
others are not. This defeats the
whole purpose of ideas."

Wicker also examined televi
sion's retreat from its duties to
report the news. He said that
because television news must
make money, it must have high
ratings — and to have high rat
ings, it uses "infotainment."
Infotainment, according to
Wicker, is "a deep interview with
a rock star." In contrast to info
tainment is the documentary,
which Wicker says has all but dis
appeared.
"Entertainment and news is
interchangeable," Wicker said.

"The seriousness of network
news is on the decline. I raise the
question that by the end of the
century we might not have any
news other than a half hour" with
"star-quality anchors."
In coverage of the Persian Gulf
war, the American media was con
trolled by the government, he
said. "The public was glad to see
the press controlled," Wicker
said. "I find that fact the most
disturbing fact of my long career
as a journalist."
"The government now knows

how to present a war, and that
will be the reason for such wars in
the future," he said. "The days of
the bold American war correspon
dent are gone."
Wicker encouraged the few
younger members of the audience
to enter the field of journalism in
order to serve the public.
Wicker expressed his hope
that, in the future, the American
press will not back down from
government censorship, such as
the type which occurred in the
Gulf war.
