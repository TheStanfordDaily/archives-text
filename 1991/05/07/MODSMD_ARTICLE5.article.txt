# Reges decision imminent
## Lecturer threatens suit to regain position if fired 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The University will decide
whether to take disciplinary
action against Computer Science
Senior Lecturer Stuart Reges
within a few days, Dean of the
School of Engineering James Gib
bons said this weekend.
And if the decision is to fire
him, Reges said he will sue the
University to regain his position.
Reges was placed on paid
administrative leave April 19 after
University President Donald
Kennedy received a letter from
national drug czar Bob Martinez
warning him that the University
must enforce its drug and alcohol
policy or risk losing its federal
funds.

Reges had admitted in a letter
to Martinez that he openly vio
lates Stanford's drug rules to
protest U.S. drug policy.
Gibbons would not say whether
the University has completed its
investigation into Reges' claims,
which was authorized by Kennedy
on April 22. But he added that the
decision is being made "in a timely
way" to assure fairness and
thoughtfulness.
He added that he and Provost
James Rosse will make the deci
sion on Reges' case.
Rosse said he has received a
completed report and recommen
dations from Ken Down, associate
dean for administration in the
School of Engineering, who fin
ished his initial investigation last
week. Rosse would not elaborate
further.
Reges said he has not yet found
a lawyer who will represent him
free of charge but added that the
Washington, D.C.-based Drug Pol
icy Foundation is aiding him in his
search and will pay any legal fees.
"We're helping him out in every
way we can," said Kennington
Wall, director of public informa
tion for the foundation.
Reges said he thinks his possi
ble termination would be based on
the issue of "professional miscon
duct" — the advice he gave to a
student to experiment with the
drug MDA, an amphetamine
derived hallucinogen nicknamed
"the love drug." He said it is a
"matter of opinion" whether the
advice constitutes misconduct.
He said being dismissed for car
rying drugs on campus would be a
result of government coercion.
The strongest legal case
against him involves the dinner at
which he looked away when some
of his underage students ordered
alcohol, he added.
However, he said he has told
University administrators that he
is willing to promise never to
allow underage students to drink
in his presence again.
Reges is currently on paid
administrative leave pending the
results of the investigation.
He said it is not clear to him
why he is on suspension. Accord
ing to the University's adminis
trative guide, "Supervisors should
use an investigatory suspension

only in a situation in which the
investigation cannot be conducted
reasonably while the employee
remains on the job."

But Reges said he could not
understand why the investigation
could not be "conducted reason
ably" while he continued teach
ing.
Down said, "It seemed appro
priate to relieve Stuart of his
duties with pay while we investi
gated the actions he'd described."
Down noted that the investigation
required a great amount of time
on Reges' part.
Reges said he is unsure what he
will do if he loses his job. But he
added that he thinks his academic
career would likely be finished.
With regard to fighting disci
plinary sanctions, academic staff
— lecturers, senior lecturers,
research associates and senior
research associates — do not have
the same rights as faculty.
According to the Academic
Handbook, which outlines proce
dures for academic staff, a staff
member can file a grievance in
writing with the head of the divi
sion in which the decision is made.
In Reges' case, Rosse is the
highest-level administrator
involved in the decision. Accord
ing to the handbook, the adminis
trator may consider the grievance
and "may attempt to resolve the
matter informally or make what
ever disposition of the grievance
he or she deems appropriate."
The staff member may appeal
the division head's decision to the
next higher administrative officer
— Kennedy, in this case — and, in
all cases, the president's decision
will be final.
