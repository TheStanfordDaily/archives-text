# Campus policy will not change

The controversy sur
rounding Senior Computer
Science Lecturer Stuart
Reges will not affect the
enforcement of Stanford's
drug and alcohol policy,
according to several Stan
ford officials.
"We'll continue what
we're doing," said Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
Although Reges has thrust the
drug and alcohol policy into the
spotlight, enforcement of the pol
icy will still mainly consist of edu
cation about the effects of drugs
and alcohol, Jackson said.
The new policy was adopted at
the beginning of last quarter to
comply with the 1989 Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act,
which stipulates that universities
must implement drug and alcohol
policies to receive federal aid.
Stanford's old policy empha
sized personal responsibility in
the decision to drink or take
drugs, while the new policy
requires the University to take a
more active role in policy enforce
ment.
Jackson said that under the
new policy — which prohibits
alcohol use by minors and any use
or possession of illegal drugs on
campus — more people have
brought drug- and alcohol-related
incidents to the University's
attention than under the old pol
icy.
The University finds out about
incidents in a number of ways,
including reports of parties which
go out of control and of students
who are arrested for being under
the influence, Jackson said.
He said he could not compare
the number of reported drug and
alcohol incidents from this year to
a similar period last year, adding
that the policy is still in a transi
tion phase because many students

'My personal view is that I'd like to see
a bit stronger anti-drug-use lobby' from
the University administration. Stanford's
attitude toward drug use has been 'a bit
detached.'

are unaware of its existence.
University President Donald
Kennedy, in an April 24 letter to
The Daily, addressed the contro
versy and Stanford's enforcement
of its policy. "It is . . . true that we
have previously been perhaps too
casual about the serving of alcohol
at campus events," he wrote.
"But it is our obligation, how
ever we may feel about it, to
tighten up our practices and com
ply. There just isn't any room for
hypocrisy," he added.
When asked yesterday how the
University will enforce its drug
and alcohol policy more rigidly,
Kennedy had no comment.
However, with regard to wine
and cheese parties hosted by fac
ulty or staff where minors are pre
sent, Kennedy said, "We're cer
tainly being very careful about
that ourselves and expect others
will be too."
Jackson said the University's
advice to most faculty and staff is:
"If you're in doubt, don't serve
alcohol at all."
Several other members of the
Stanford community also said
they think the controversy will
have little effect on enforcement.
Ann Porteus, assistant director
of the Office of Residential Educa-

tion, said that although Res Ed
has not conducted any studies
about the ways resident assistants
have dealt with the new policy, she
sees no reason to enforce the pol
icy more harshly.
Porteus said Stanford is unique
in having RAs who are solely "pro
moters of community" and do not
double as "police officers." How
ever, she said that if Stanford is
required to crack down on drug
and alcohol use, Res Ed might cre
ate a special "cadre of monitors"
whose only job is to enforce the
policy.
Anita De Lucio, an RA at Casa
Zapata, said, "I don't think it's
going to affect [enforcement! sig
nificantly."
She noted that throughout her
experience with Res Ed the
department "has stood firm on its
enforcement of the policy."
Health educator Louise Miller,
director of the Risk Reduction of
Intoxicants in the Stanford Com
munity program, said she thinks
the Reges controversy "will not
change [enforcement! at all."
She said Stanford has an effec
tive policy on the books and every
effort is already being made to
comply.

Health economist Joel Hay, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution who has done
research on the costs of drug
abuse, said he thinks the contro
versy probably won't affect the
enforcement. "I hope not," he
added.
But, he said, "My personal view
is that I'd like to see a bit stronger
anti-drug-use lobby" from the
University administration, adding
that Stanford's attitude toward
drug use has been "a bit
detached."
The national debate over col
lege drug policy enforcement was
intensified by a raid in late March
at the University of Virginia after
undercover federal agents com
pleted a six-month investigation
into drug use at three fraternities.
In a nighttime raid, officers found
12 partially filled sandwich bags
of marijuana, three bags of hallu
cinogenic mushrooms and one of
LSD.
However, Norm Robinson, act
ing dean of student affairs, said he
sees no reason why the University
should enforce its policy more
rigidly in response to that inci
dent. He added that he does not
think fraternities and sororities
should be singled out.
"We've developed a reasonable
and effective policy," he said.
At the University of Virginia,
all freshmen are required to
attend alcohol and drug-abuse
seminars, and officers of fraterni
ties and sororities are given spe
cial training on the consequences
of abuse. But Robinson said that
Stanford has not considered such
programs, noting that drug and
alcohol education is coordinated
through Res Ed.
