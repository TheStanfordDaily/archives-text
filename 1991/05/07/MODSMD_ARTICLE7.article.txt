# Phony letters sent in prank
## 
### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Several students, faculty and staff members have
been the victim of an apparent UC-Berkeley prank
â€” a rash of phony letters saying they or members of
their departments are facing University investiga
tions.
"I think this is a Cal 'weenies' scheme," said Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. "It has all the indica
tions of a Cal prankster with a warped sense of
humor and money for postage."
At least 25 students reported receiving letters
Monday signed by "Myron Kesselbaum," described
in the letter as Stanford's "Student Conduct Offi
cer," Cole said. No such person works with the Office
of Student Affairs, she added.
The phony letters addressed to students say, "You
must contact this office within 48 hours of receipt of
this letter to arrange for a hearing before the Judi
cial Board," but does not explain what charges the
student faces.
The chief indication that the letters originate

from UC-Berkeley is a tag at the bottom of the let
ters reading "MK:ucb." The MK evidently refers to
Myron Kesselbaum.
One student who received a phony letter, sopho
more Lori Ludington, said "right after I calmed
down it was pretty obvious that it wasn't real." She
noticed not only the "ucb" tag, but also the postmark
stamped in San Francisco.
The letters are "vaguely threatening and very
pompous," said Cole. "If you don't study it carefully
it looks pretty official," she added.
The letters also list a fourth floor office in the Old
Union as a return address, she said. There is no
fourth floor in Old Union.
Cole said that if this incident is a prank, it is "out
of the blue," since it is neither April Fool's Day nor
the season for the Stanford-Cal football game. As a
result, people who have received the letters have
tended to take them seriously. In addition to the stu
dents, several upset parents have also called her, she
added.
