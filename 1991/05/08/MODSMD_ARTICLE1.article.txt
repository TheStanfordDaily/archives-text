# Race against time
## No typical days, or nights, in the emergency room 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld 
11:45 a.m. A car crashes on Skyline Boulevard. A 14-
year-old girl emerges from the wreck, walks away and col
lapses.
12:01 p.m. The Life Flight Helicopter takes off for the
scene with a nurse and doctor on board. The Stanford Hos
pital Emergency and Prompt Care Unit is notified.
12:15 p.m. The attending physician is notified that the
teenage girl is unconscious and unresponsive. A button is
pushed and bells ring to alert the staff. Upstairs in the pedi
atrics and trauma departments beepers go off.
12:30 p.m. The 7,000-pound helicopter lands gently on
the roof of the hospital. Two paramedics rush to its rear
bay doors to help unload the patient, who can't afford to
wait for the rotor blades to stop.
12:31 p.m. The patient regains consciousness in the ele
vator that takes her from the roof to the emergency room.
She tells the doctor her name. Everyone breathes more eas
ily.
12:32 p.m. Dr. Ric Martinez, the attending physician and
clinical director of emergency medicine, and a dozen doc
tors and nurses have put on gowns and are waiting in the
emergency room hall in front of room five, the "trauma
room."
The teenager is transferred to one of the beds. Her
clothes are quickly removed. An intravenous drip is set up
as machines monitor her vital signs: blood pressure, heart
rate, blood oxygen content. After making sure she is stable,

doctors whisk her away to the
scanner room.
The head scans reveal nothing
abnormal. The girl was very lucky.
Everyone agrees that it could have
been a lot worse. "There could
have been something (bad) going
on in her head," Martinez says
after hearing that the scans were
negative.
It's a typical spring Sunday in
the emergency room.
Two patients occupy room one,
the half-filled "cardiac room"
where patients with heart prob
lems are treated.
A child vomits in room three,
an isolated room. She may be
rejecting the heart transplant she
received eight days earlier. The
drugs that try to prevent rejection
also make her particularly vulner
able to germs.
The next room down the hall is
room five, where blunt traumas
— non-open-wound injuries —
and penetrating traumas — like
knife wounds — are handled. This
is sometimes where the "gun and
knife club" meets, Martinez says.
Room seven, around the cor
ner, is where minor traumas (bro
ken bones, dislocated joints) are
treated. Victims of bike accidents
abound.

In the back hall, people who
aren't in urgent need of care get
attention in Prompt Care. This is
the calmest place in the unit.
Small cuts, sprains and other
minor injuries are dealt with
there.
The price for this care at the
Stanford Hospital Emergency
Room is a steep one. Just walking
through the door costs $150 and a
body scan can run as high as
$2,800.
Nurses, residents and interns
move busily in seemingly random
patterns from desks to beds to X
ray viewing rooms to labs to beds
again. The continuous flow of
information helps solve the cases.
The average day, if there is
such a thing, includes most of the
above, plus rashes and 7-year-olds
with sore throats.
In a year, the physicians see an
average of 100 cases a day, which
is only moderate compared to
large inner-city hospitals.
The number of cases varies
greatly from one day to another,
from one moment to another.
"The business comes to the
door," says Martinez. "It can
make it easy for us or it can kill
us."
The beds can fill up in a
minute, from car accident casual
ties to multiple shooting victims.
It is sometimes hard to under
stand why anyone would want to
live in this apparent chaos and

under such constant stress.
"I've never had an uninter
rupted meal around here," says
Dr. Phillip Harter, an attending
physician, looking sadly at his cold
french fries.
"We're the last bastion of clini
cal medicine," Martinez says. "It's
you and your stethoscope, a con
versation, and that's about it. You
have to make decisions based
upon that for the first 15 or 20
minutes. You're going blind."
Physicians in the emergency
room have to deal quickly and effi
ciently with very different cases,
from the simple to the bizarre and
complex.
For some, this diversity is the
main reason they chose the spe
cialty. "I like the variety that
comes through. I also like the acu
ity — I like the really sick
patients," says Martinez.
While he agrees that people
may not want to hear that some
physicians like critical cases, "It's
better than having a scared guy
standing there," when you're
being wheeled in.
The horror of some cases
described by the emergency room
workers rivals that of scenes from
Hollywood's most gruesome
movies — severed limbs, impale
ments, gunshot and blade
wounds, drug-related seizures,
deranged people shouting in the
halls. But they don't involve

actors or special effects. They're
real, too real.
Workers fall through skylights,
chain saws cut through flesh,
babies are trapped in their dead
mothers' wombs. The emergency
room is where they are fixed, or at
least stabilized.
"The emergency room is the
resuscitation center for the whole
hospital," Martinez says. Its role
is to stabilize the patients and
then send them to surgery, the
intensive-care unit, home or
whichever department can help
them best.
The academic side of the Stan
ford Medical Center means that
specialists and researchers
abound. The emergency room and
its patients benefit directly from
these resources. Cancer and heart
specialists can come down from
their departments in minutes to
help emergency physicians with
their diagnoses.
Despite ever-increasing knowl
edge, the doctors, nurses and staff
in the emergency room are still
faced with heart-wrenching cases.
When asked how doctors deal
with the emotional aspects of
their jobs in the emergency room,
Harter said, "You can't get
attached in your emotional side.
Everyone probably has a different
mechanism to protect themselves
— those who don't burn out. You
have to keep things in perspective.
"We see things that even the
most hardened person is going to
be affected by. There's people who
go home and cry, too. Kids always
affect me," he adds.
A terminal pancreas cancer
patient is rolled through the door.
She is another part of the unend
ing and random flow of people
that pass through here.
Her family had decided to let
her die at home, but someone pan
icked and dialed 9-1-1. Now she
will have to die at the hospital.
The ethical issue of whether
someone should be kept alive at
all costs and in all cases is particu
larly pressing in the emergency
room, where doctors know next to
nothing about their patients.
"We see people whose time it is
to die, and we see people whose
time it isn't," Harter says."The
community in general is starting
to realize that people have a right
to make a determination on how
they want to sustain their lives.
Fifteen years ago you couldn't die
without CPR, now you can."
The old woman will die in one
of the back rooms with her family
assembled at her bedside.
The staff has to deal with all
kinds of social situations. Ten
sions between patients, visitors
and staff have to be resolved
quickly in such a stressful envi
ronment.
"When I step into a room,"

Martinez says,"I have 15 seconds
to figure out what the relation
ships between the people are."
Most of the problems the physi
cians see have social implications.
Many of the cases are drug- or
alcohol-related.
The emergency room some
times attracts drug addicts who
pretend to be sick to try to get pre
scriptions under assumed names.
Sometimes doctors have to
become social workers to under
stand and help their patients.
A woman has a miscarriage.
She doesn't speak English. The
doctors and nurses have to decide
whether to let her husband stay in
the room or not.
And they also have to help her
deal with the guilt she feels over
losing the baby. The staff can no
more ignore the mental distress of
their patient than they could her
physical pain. It's not just part of
their job, it's part of themselves,
doctors say.

The people in the emergency
room are dedicated and sensitive
individuals. The tragedy and
death that surrounds them has
forged a special brand of ethics
that mixes pragmatism and ideal
ism, a humble and blind dedica
tion to their patients.
While dealing with their own
limitations and shortcomings,
they give the impression that they
will nonetheless go above and
beyond them if the patients
require it.
Here, everything possible is
done to maximize speed and effi
ciency. The doctors have immedi
ate access to computer databases
on chemicals and drugs. Special
ized trays are prepared for all con
tingencies. X-ray films can be
ready in less than half an hour,
scans in less than 10 hours. Most
tests are performed in a small lab
in the back.
Meanwhile, the helicopter
takes off again.
