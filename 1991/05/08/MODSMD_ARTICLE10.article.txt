Angola approves peace accord
LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Angola's govern
ment said it has accepted the provisional peace
accord with U.S.-supported UNITA rebels on
ending their 16-year-old civil war.
The Soviet-backed government also said in a
statement Monday night that it had given final
approval to laws legalizing opposition groups in
the southern African nation. It has been a one
party state since independence from Portugal
in 1975.
Under the peace accord initialed by negotia
tors in Portugal last week, the two sides are to
halt fighting by midnight May 15, two weeks
before a formal cease-fire takes effect with
monitoring by a U.N. peacekeeping force.
The accord also calls for Angola's first free
elections in the fall of 1992.
EPA accused of slow action
on pesticides in ground water
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Environmental
Protection Agency can take more than 15 years
to ban pesticides endangering drinking water,
thereby allowing contamination that will be
"difficult, costly or even impossible to remedy,"
congressional investigators say.
Pesticides already found in ground water in
various parts of the nation include many of the
most widely used chemicals applied to food
crops, Congress' General Accounting Office said.
Some of the pesticides are listed as probable
or possible causes of cancer by the EPA, and
health officials have expressed concern that
they could be linked to reproductive problems,
weakening of immune systems and behavioral
difficulties.
Bangladesh struck by tornado
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A tornado and
thunderstorms yesterday brought new misery
and death to Bangladesh, still on its knees from
last week's cyclone.
Yesterday's tornado struck Tongi, an indus
trial suburb 20 miles north of Dhaka.
