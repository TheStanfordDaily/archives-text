# Curfew imposed in D.C. neighborhood
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - City officials imposed a 7
p.m. curfew yesterday in a predominantly Hispanic
neighborhood where 13 police officers were injured
and several businesses ransacked in two previous
nights of violence.
Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon said the dusk-to-dawn
curfew was necessary to "to allow us to restore order
... to not give way to our own worst fears" in the
Mount Pleasant area, about two miles north of the
White House. The curfew will remain in force
nightly until lifted by separate order.
"We can't surrender ... we can't let a few people

who wish to take advantage of other problems in our
community set the tone and tenor of Washington,
D.C.," the mayor said at a news conference.
The Mount Pleasant streets were calm through
out the daylight hours as businessmen set about
assessing and repairing the damage caused by ban
dana-masked youths who smashed shop windows,
wrecked a restaurant and set several buildings afire
on Monday night.
Several hundred youths congregated in the
streets in early evening, as community leaders and
Spanish-speaking police officers pleaded with them

to disperse and obey the curfew. Some shredded
Spanish-language copies of the curfew notice, toss
ing them in the air like confetti beneath the gaze of
police on horseback.
But many youths remained on the streets as the
deadline passed, and there were sporadic episodes of
rock-throwing. "This is our street, we can be on the
street as long as we want," yelled one as 40 helmeted
police formed a skirmish line, nightsticks drawn.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, accompanied by Hispanic
leaders, urged the crowds to go home and remain
calm. "We're tyring to encourage young people to
comply with the curfew.... We're trying to reduce the
atmosphere that appears so innocent but is so dan
gerous," he said.
The new curfew banned people other than law
enforcement officers, firefighters, medical teams and
other city workers from the streets. Violators faced
penalties ranging to 10 days in jail and a $300 fine.
Late Monday, Dixon instituted a midnight to 5
a.m. curfew after the second round of confrontations
between riot-equipped police and bands of rock- and
bottle-throwing youths.
The initial rampage, a night earlier, followed the
gunshot wounding of a Hispanic man by a rookie
policewoman. Police officials said the man drew a
knife as the officer attempted to arrest him and sev
eral others after they challenged her warning about
drinking in public. Some residents disputed the
police account, saying the suspect, Daniel Gomez,
had already been handcuffed when he was shot.
Thirteen officers were injured Monday night in
the second violent spree before police dispersed the
bands, totaling an estimated 200 to 400 people, with
barrages of tear gas.
Fifty arrests were made and Police Chief Isaac
Fulwood Jr. said his department suffered $600,000
in property losses, including 13 vehicles burned or
damaged Monday night and six a night earlier. A
transit bus also was wrecked. Transit officials put
the replacement cost at $180,000.
The mayor met earlier yesterday with the com
mander of the D.C. National Guard, Maj. Gen.
Calvin Franklin, but said she had no plan to ask the
Guard to supplant the heavy police patrols.
Hispanic community leaders said a combination
of lack of employment opportunities as well as what
they called disrespectful treatment by police were at
the root of the disturbances.
