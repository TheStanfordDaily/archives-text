# Aid to Soviets sidetracked over objections by Baltics
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - An effort to
speed $1.5 billion in food credits to the
Soviet Union was sidetracked yesterday
after the leaders of Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania voiced objections to congres
sional leaders.
The chief sponsor of a Senate resolu
tion urging President Bush to approve
the aid, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
said he would seek to rewrite the docu
ment and try again in a few days.
The Bush administration "would like
to move ahead with export credits," said
Dole, R-Kan., but is wary of a legal provi
sion requiring that Moscow first be

deemed creditworthy.
Bush said a week ago that the credit
worthiness test was keeping him from
approving loan guarantees to allow the
Soviets to buy $1.5 billion worth of U.S.
grain. Soviet President Mikhail Gor
bachev has appealed for the aid as neces
sary to stabilize his country and keep his
democratic reform efforts alive.
Earlier yesterday, President Mauno
Koivisto of Finland and Germany's eco
nomics minister appealed to the Bush
administration for more Western aid to
the Soviet Union.
But Bush, in a private White House

meeting with Koivisto, remained non
committal and gave no indication when
he will decide on the agricultural credits.
Koivisto said in his departure remarks
on the South Lawn, "Reform efforts in
Eastern Europe, including the Soviet
Union, now need our support. With the
Cold War behind us, no new divisions
must be drawn."
Bush, in his public comments at the
departure ceremony, said he and Koivisto
agreed on "the importance of pragma
tism," meanwhile, in solving the problem
between Moscow and the breakaway
Baltic republics.

Meanwhile, Economics Minister Juer
gen Moellemann of Germany also pitched
for greater Western assistance to the
Soviets, saying "nothing would imperil
world peace more than if an internally
tormented Soviet Union were to spin out
of control."
Moellemann, in Washington for meet
ings with Vice President Dan Quayle and
Bush Cabinet members, said in a speech
to a German studies group that his nation
has provided $23 billion in aid to the
Soviet Union, though "at times we in the
West tend to think that its problems are
insurmountable."

Dole, whose wheat-producing state
would benefit from new sales, had
arranged for a vote yesterday on the Sen
ate floor on a resolution designed to give
Bush a go-ahead signal to approve aid.
The vote schedule was designed to take
advantage of former Soviet Foreign Min
ister Eduard Shevardnadze's presence in
Washington.
"A decision which will be taken in
Washington will to a large extent deter
mine the fate of reform and democracy in
Ihe Soviet Union," Shevardnadze said a
day earlier.
