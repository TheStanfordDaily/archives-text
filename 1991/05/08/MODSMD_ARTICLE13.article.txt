# Rivalries divide Yugoslavia
## 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— The growing violence between
Serbs and Croats stems from
deep-seated historical rivalry that
has threatened to engulf
Yugoslavia since it was created in
1918.
Members of the two largest
ethnic groups in this country of 24
million people speak nearly identi
cal languages. But history has
driven them apart: The Serbs
proudly maintained Orthodox
belief under the Muslim Ottoman
Empire; the Croats adopted the
Roman Catholicism of the Haps
burg rulers of the Austro-Hungar
ian Empire.
The experience left each group
with a fierce pride in its particular
historical identity and a determi
nation to stay united and cede
nothing to rivals. Intermarriage is
still relatively rare.
Yugoslavia's political chaos has
deepened the divide. Central
authority in the country crumbled
as leaders of the six quarrelling
republics took power into their
own hands.
Traveling between the differ
ent regions now is increasingly
difficult, sometimes dangerous.

Dusan Vranic, who has survived

assignments in Afghanistan and
recently in Iraq without injury,
was beaten Saturday by armed
Croatian nationalists who said
they mistook him and a Serb col
league for Serb gunmen.
Serbs who have for decades
maintained holiday homes on
Croatia's Dalmatian coast now
fear traveling to them. Some who
do find the properties damaged,
smeared in the nationalist graffiti
that have proliferated throughout
Yugoslavia the past year.
Serbs in western Croatia have
blocked railway lines to the coast
sporadically since summer.
The regional leaders have
sought in vain to bury their deep
differences, leaving Yugoslavs to
choose between peaceful divorce
and violent separation.
Last year's free elections in the
six republics sharpened con
frontation.
Croatia, ruled by center-right
ists, wants Yugoslavia to become a
loose association of sovereign
states and is threatening to secede
if it doesn't.
Communist-ruled Serbia seeks
a Serb-dominated federal nation
and has threatened to expand its
territory to include all ethnic
Serbs who live in other republics if

Croatia secedes.
The flareup has brewed since
August, when Serbs in the west
ern Croatian region of Krajina
declared autonomy. Serbs, who
make up about 11 percent of Croa
tia's 5.5 million citizens, claim dis
crimination by the Croatian gov
ernment, which they say follows
Ustasha policies.
Croatia denies the charges,
countering that Serbia is manipu
lating the minority to form a
"Great Serbia" at Croatia's
expense.
The passions dividing the two
peoples easily spill into violence.
In World War 11, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs died at the
hands of Croat Ustashas, allies of
the Nazis. Serb Chetniks mur
dered Ustashas and Communists.
The recent fighting has been
the fiercest between Serbs and
Croats since the war, prompting
the army to try to play the role
once enjoyed by the late Commu
nist President Josip Broz Tito in
holding the country together.
Croatia has repeatedly accused
the army of being pro-Serb and
Communist. That anger stoked
the huge anti-army demonstra
tion Monday that left one soldier
dead in Split.
