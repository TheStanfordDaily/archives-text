Dubious USSA better
than nothing, for now,
on financial aid issue

IN THE ASSU ELECTION, A
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents indicated they are con
cerned about financial aid. Yet the
United States Students Associa
tion, the organization through
which the ASSU proposes to lobby
Congress on this issue, appears to
be both ideologically questionable
and unnecessarily secretive. This
leaves many moderate students
caught in an unfortunate dilemma:
They can support an organization
about which they know little, or
else lose influence in the national
debate on financial aid.
Although the USSA claims to
spend "90 percent" of its resources
and effort on financial aid issues, it
also has taken stances on issues
ranging from the recent Civil
Rights Act to the Gulf war. Unlike
financial aid, these issues are
highly controversial among Stan
ford students.
But even more disturbing are
the many unanswered questions
surrounding the USSA: Does it
lobby against Department of
Defense funding of university
research or not? What are the
names of the other member
schools? How many of them are
private, and how many are public?
How many of the leaders of the
USSA are also involved in the pro
gressive Unity committee or other
highly political organizations?
Proponents of the USSA tend to
portray such ideological attacks as
reactionary McCarthyite tactics.
But the elusive nature of the USSA
invites criticism and raises suspi
cions in the mind of any reasonable
student. Perhaps the most trou
bling question of all is why Stan

ford students who are on the USSA
board of directors cannot answer
basic questions about the organiza
tion.
The last line of defense for
USSA supporters is that continued
membership in the organization is
the only possible way for Stanford
students to have a voice in the cur
rent debate over financial aid. As
unappealing as such an argument
may be, it has great validity.
The Bush administration has
already demonstrated its willing
ness to limit federal aid to students
in its quest to cut the budget, and
in order to speak out against such
actions, Stanford must ally itself
with an existing national lobbying
group â€” at least in the short term.
Student aid is a current issue in
Congress; there is no time to
search for alternatives. The $1,000
membership fee of the USSA is a
reasonable share of the fight to
retain federal aid programs, and it
also allows Stanford, at least
marginally, to shape the USSA
stance on other issues.
But that is for the short term
only. In the long term, Stanford
students must demand answers
from the USSA and make future
membership contingent upon
receiving such answers. The extra
$1,000 the USSA is requesting to
open a Sacramento, Calif, office
should be held up until the group is
demystified.
Finally, serious work should be
put into finding alternative meth
ods of lobbying Congress on this
issue. If no better group exists,
Stanford could help found a new
one; we have a respectable name
and moderate resources, and
surely there are other campuses
that are equally disenchanted.
If the USSA refuses to open up
and justify its policies to its own
student members, Stanford stu
dents deserve to be given another
solution to the financial aid
dilemma.
