University, like Reges, should stand up for its beliefs

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT Don
ald Kennedy, in his April 24 letter
to The Daily, shows concern that
some of the boundaries in the issues of
the Stuart Reges case are becoming con
fused. I agree with Kennedy on this
point, but I think his letter has further
blurred many of these same boundaries.
The first issue Kennedy addresses is
the distinction between conduct and
speech. He demonstrates how sexual
harassment that takes the form of
speech is misconduct. However, I do not
understand how he draws a parallel
between sexual harassment and Reges'
behavior.
Reges explained that after a thought
ful, hour-long discussion with a student,
he expressed his opinion about the drug
MDA — an opinion derived from
personal experience and research. If

Kennedy sees this as an instance of mis
conduct, then it appears misconduct is
an expression of an opinion divergent
from the mainstream; in which case, all
dialogue concerning a very complex and
unresolved issue is effectively shut down.
In fact, Kennedy explicitly states this
toward the end of his letter: "It seems to
me unconscionable for responsible per
sons on this campus to recommend the
use of illicit drugs." With these words,
Kennedy not only misrepresents Reges'
action, but also denies an individual's
right to dissent from mainstream opin
ion.
Kennedy also has some words about
"hypocrisy." Apparently, Kennedy sees
hypocrisy in the discrepancy between the
stated rules in the University's drug and
alcohol policy and the enforcement of
these rules. In his words, "It is our obli

gation, however we may feel about it, to
tighten up our practices and comply."
Although there is certainly some
hypocrisy in the discrepancy between
these rules and their enforcement, this is
not the same hypocrisy of which Reges
and many others, including myself, are
aware. The true hypocrisy lies in the
University's acceptance of a federal drug
and alcohol policy with which the Uni
versity itself does not agree.
As Kennedy says, "Most of us dislike
the need for government interference
into the arrangements for community
life." Yet, several lines later, he refers to
our "obligation" to "tighten up" and
"comply" with that intervention.
If we do not believe in government
intervention, why are we complying? Is
it because the federal government has

threatened to cut off aid if we do not fol
low their rules, rules we do not believe
in? It seems the University is not
allowed to differ from the opinion of the
federal government in much the same
way that Reges is not permitted to hold
an opinion different from that of the
University president.
The difference is Reges refused to
compromise his principles.
Reges has taken a brave stand against
an unfair "drug war" — a war that
threatens our personal liberties, a war
that scapegoats drugs as the cause of
problems in our cities, ignoring the pre
existing poverty, a war that, like all wars,
unfairly invalidates and dismisses legiti
mate criticisms and probing questions.
