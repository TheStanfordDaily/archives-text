# Fee refund system subverts democracy; abolish it
## 
### 
NOW THAT THE ELECTIONS
are over, it is time to reflect on
what we have learned. It is time
to reflect on what, for lack of a better
name, I will call the Morgan-Overdeck
hypocrisy, as they are the most visible
proponents of it.
In its simplest form, this hypocrisy
states that when we (the student body)
say "no," we mean "no," but when we
say "yes," we probably meant "no" —
the reverse of what Council of Presidents
candidates Beth Morgan and John
Overdeck argued was the reason the
ASSU placed MEChA's fee request on
the runoff ballot.
In other words, we should not have
been allowed to vote for the MEChA fee
request again, as it was voted down in
the general election, but we should be
allowed to vote on all the groups' fee
requests again when we ask for fee

refunds.
The fee refund system is the worst
possible way to subvert the democratic
process, for it allows us to feel good
about ourselves when, in our generosity,
we approve all the special fees. We can
then turn around and change our votes
by asking for our money back — without
even an allegation of irregularity
If, through the ASSU electoral sys
tem, we are attempting to capture the
reality of the "real" world, we must
abandon the fee refund system, as it does
not exist outside the school environment.
How many of you have been successful
in getting your taxes refunded because
you did not believe in the programs the
government was funding? Not only can it
not be done, but such a system would
amount to governmental suicide, as has
already happened in a town whose name
I cannot recall.

The residents of this town had two
choices. They could vote either to
increase their taxes or to cut the services
provided by the town. They chose the
latter and now live with the conse
quences. All government offices, includ
ing the public library, are now open only
three days a week. The police depart
ment is comprised of an answering
machine that instructs the callers to call
the state police, 30 minutes away, in the
event of an emergency. The fire depart
ment cannot repair the fire engines or
the city's alarm system. I ask Overdeck,
Morgan, John Louie and Benny San
doval: Is that what you want to see here
at Stanford?
People will almost always vote against
taxes and for fee refunds because they
take services for granted and do not real
ize where the funding for them comes
from. Those of us who argued against

the subversion of the democratic process
must now work to abolish the system
that subverts it the most: fee refunds.
This system can be abolished while
allowing the students to select which
groups they wish not to fund. We already
vote by computer. It would therefore be
easy, as part of the voting process, to give
each student the non-ASSU portion of
her fee, the part that would be used to
fund the various student groups, to dis
tribute among the groups for which she
approved the special fee request.
No refunds would then be necessary,
for no student would be funding groups
of which she disapproved. No student
would be able to take the moral high
ground at the elections by voting for
every special fee on the ballot, only to
turn around and request fee refunds.
