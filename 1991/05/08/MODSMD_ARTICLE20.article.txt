## Kofi, Andy: Eat my shorts 
### 
I'M MAD AS HELL, AND I'M consid
ering a preliminary investigation into
the possibility of not taking it any
more. I've managed to sit and suffer
through the persecution of gays and
minorities and the mistreatment of the
American underclass, but now the forces
of evil have hit me where it hurts:
They've started bashing columnists.
Last Friday, in an apparent attempt at
humor, Kofi Bruce and Andrew Katz por
trayed columnists as a deluded, pedantic
breed of run-of-the-mill dimwits, who do
nothing but take random occurrences and
throw them together randomly in hopes
of achieving some minimal entertainment
value.
Bruce and Katz may feel a masochistic
urge to discredit themselves, but they're
not dragging me down with them. Col
umn-writing is an art of breathtaking
precision, in which emotion and reason
are deftly balanced to produce a message
of lasting importance, and any suggestion
to the contrary does a serious disservice.
The damage has been done, but in
order to salvage what little pride the com
munity of columnists has left, I will now
survey the process that produces what I
firmly believe may be the finest example
of our art in circulation today: my weekly
column. I hope you can keep up.
The first thing you need is a catchy
opening sentence. Relevance to the topic
is nice, but not necessary; it just has to be
catchy. If it isn't catchy, no one will keep
reading. If no one keeps reading, it's time
to start thinking about picking up a more
productive hobby.
"I'm mad as hell, and I'm considering a

preliminary investigation into the possi
bility of not taking it anymore," for exam
ple, is a catchy opening sentence. "Boy,
the ASSU really sucks" is not.
Next, set the scene. Where are you?
What are you doing there? Why aren't
you in Green Library studying for that
damn midterm? Use plenty of details.
Details are a powerful rhetorical tool, fil
tering the narrative through the prism of
life and magically transporting the reader
to another time and place. They also take
up lots of space.
Start to narrow your focus a little
before people begin to wonder why The
Daily is running an article on pickles.
Drop hints that an Important Theme,
most likely a Major Social Problem, will
soon be revealed.
At this point, your best bet is to intro
duce a Significant Character and/or Inci
dent. Or, to be Grammatically Correct, a
Character and/or Incident of Significance.
Grammatical Correctness is optional, but
it's always wise to fear the wrath of the
League of Revolutionary Linguists.
If you haven't had a meaningful
encounter with a homeless person lately,
keep your friends in mind. Sure, Ben
probably figured you would keep his inti
mate secrets to yourself, but when he sees
the enlightening impact the story of his
sex change can have upon the community,
he'll understand.
Once you've got a character and a situ
ation, you can coast. Spend some time
developing your apocrypha. And make
sure to use enough big words so you can
justify spending $20,000 a year for the
privilege of reading books. While you're at

it, toss in amazingly short paragraphs
every once in a while, as if you actually
had something important to say.
Like this.
Or this.
Of course, the story itself doesn't mat
ter that much. It's just the background
for the sudden, epiphanic, melodramatic
realization that everything you've
learned since you stopped breast feeding
is dead wrong.
From there, the possibilities are limit
less. You can rant about injustice. You can
castigate the system. You can tell Stan
ford students they're a bunch of material
istic, insensitive egotists. And the best
part of it is that none of it's your fault:
You were just too innocent to notice these
things until now.
Conclude by telling everyone the
world's not a perfect place, but express
the hope that it will be sooner or later.
Not too soon, however; then you wouldn't
have anything to write about next week.

Ed Heinemann has been trying desper
ately to work into his column an analogy
between the indirect-cost hearings and
the John Sununu controversy, as sug
gested by his friends Tom and Susan, but
he just can't get a decent epiphany out of
a fat white guy from New Hampshire.
