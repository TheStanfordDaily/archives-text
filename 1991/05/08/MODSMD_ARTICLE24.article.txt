## A 						laugh a day may keep the doctor away 
### Craig Klugman 
A joke a day will not substitute for exer
cise, but some laughter gives the body the
same benefits as a good workout, a former
professor of clinical psychiatry from the
Medical Center reports.
Research by Prof. Emeritus William Fry
shows that laughter causes the body to phys
ically respond as if it had been exercised.
Fry's research into gelotology, the science of
laughter, shows that it takes more than a lit
tle chuckle for such a response: To get the
effect, one needs a full belly laugh — what
Fry calls "mirthful laughter."
After exercise or a good laugh, muscleS
become fatigued and sore. The pain is caused
by a buildup of acid in the muscles, which
the body doesn't have time to remove during
the action. When running, a person gets a
"cramp"; in the case of laughter, the pain is
called a "stitch in one's side." The physiolog
ical mechanism is the same, Fry said.
Fry found several changes occur in the
body during laughter: Muscles are active;
heart rate increases; blood pressure goes up;
and breathing becomes faster, resulting in a
higher rate of oxygen intake. Following this
stimulatory phase comes a stage in which
muscles relax, and fatigue causes heart rate
and blood pressure to decrease below their
normal level. Soon afterward, the body
resumes normal functioning. These events
are the same as those that take place during
exercise.
Fry's work has concentrated on the phys

iological changes that take place during
laughter. He has exposed his subjects to
audio tapes of performances by both profes
sional and amateur comedians. Depending
upon the particular study in progress, he
looked at either the heart rate or the breath
ing rate to see the effect laughter that had on
the body.
But a good joke is more than just physical
exercise: "Tickling the funny bone" has pos
itive effects for the laugher's immune
responses and mental health as well. Fry's
research at Loma Linda University has
shown that laughter stimulates production
of white blood cells.
Fry also found that anger increases the
levels of certain hormones which can lead to
a heart attack, whereas laughter diffuses
anger. While he does not have enough data to
be conclusive, Fry said heart attacks during
laughter are very rare.
Based on previous studies on grief and
depression, Fry has inferred a connection
between laughter and cancer. He believes the
inability to laugh and smoke simultaneously
should decrease the chance of contracting
cancer. Fry mentioned other studies that
have suggested that depression contributes
to a person's susceptibility to cancer. Since
laughter diminishes depression, it may
lessen chances of developing cancer as well.
Humor not only helps prevent cancer, Fry
said, but is being used in its treatment.
Although the mechanisms involved are not
understood, humor diminishes physical pain
and mental anguish and also raises

depressed spirits.
"One is taken momentarily from discom
fort into a more pleasant state," Fry said.
Research on laughter has traditionally
focused on what makes people laugh.
According to researchers, everyone is born
with the ability to have a sense of humor.
However, it is environment and culture that
shapes a sense of humor and determines
what one considers to be funny. Lawrence
Pinneo of the Stanford Research Institute
has shown humor to have a biological basis.
Pinneo has demonstrated that chimpanzees
have a sense of humor and even have an
affinity for playing practical jokes.
But on the other hand, laughter prevents
poor blood circulation in the brain. Poor cir
culation can allow clots to form, blocking
blood vessels in the brain and causing small
strokes. Thus, mirthful laughter has mixed
reviews as far as strokes are concerned.
Drawing on his laughter research, Fry is
beginning to work on a theory that the body
is in a constant state of flux, rather than in
homeostasis, or balance.
As inspiring as the possibilities may seem,
a 30-minute comedy videotape tape will not
replace the aerobics workout tape in the
video library. Fry explained that a wide
range of motion is necessary.
But for people who aren't able to move
large portions of their body — paraplegics,
people with fractured bones and the
wheelchair-bound handicapped — mirthful
laughter may be good exercise, and certainly
better than none at all.
