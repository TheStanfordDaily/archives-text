# Universities need uniform overhead system
## 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
Despite our painful proximity to the indi
rect-cost controversy, it is often difficult for
members of the Stanford community to con
sider the national ramifications of the ongoing
investigations of university research overhead.
Our sometimes narrow perspective may
owe itself to the apparent triviality of the
charges leveled against Stanford. The icons of
the issue are almost ridiculous: a slowly depre
ciating yacht, a wedding reception, flowers for
the Lou Henry Hoover House.
But the clownishness of these material
items distracts us from the sober possibility
that the drubbing Stanford underwent at the
hands of Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., may
soon be experienced by other U.S. research
institutions. The Department of Health and
Human Services announced that it will expand
its exploration of indirect-cost abuses from the
four universities currently under the gun to as
many as 20 institutions.
Administrators of research facilities are
running scared: Harvard Medical School has
withdrawn $500,000 in indirect-cost claims,
which an external audit discovered had been
"mistakenly" billed to the government.
These universities aren't afraid of mere
embarrassment. Rather, they live in legitimate
fear that Congress — which has budget con

siderations of its own — will use the Stanford
scandal as an excuse to slash millions of dol
lars from the National Institute of Health
(NIH) budget. Members of the House Appro
priations Committee have already asked NIH
officials for their opinions about a possible
across-the-board cap on indirect-cost rates — a
move that could result in cuts of up to $250
million.
Back on the home front, the indirect-cost
system that legislators are attempting to pro
tect from abusive universities has spread a
web of suspicion on financial dealings within
individual institutions. Scientists fear that the
indirect-cost cream of their grant money is
being shunted by administrators to benefit
humanities departments: "fuzzy" professors

suspect that funds are illegitimately flowing in
the other direction. Their suspicion only grows
when their inquiries about available overhead
services are turned away by bookkeepers who
are either unable or unwilling to make
promises.
Obviously, the system is tangled enough
even without the uncertainty provided by
headlines about plummeting rates and unpre
dictable futures.
The irony of it all is that it seems like a
standardized, fair overhead reimbursement
system would solve a large percentage of the
problems. A universal procedure for setting
rates would remove ambiguities (Is a wedding
reception a legitimate expense? A standardized
system would have a definite answer.) and
reduce in-house suspicions that funds meant
for one study's overhead weren't begin
diverted across the campus to another depart
ment.
Yet last month the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) terminated negotiations
with the Association of American Universities
(AAU) that might have led to a much fairer
system that the one currently in place.
Apparently spirited by the recent contro
versy, the OMB decided to forego the uniform
accounting method under discussion in favor
of a system that would eliminate from consid-
