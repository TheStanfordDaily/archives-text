# Earthquakes are not Saint Andrew's fault
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
Last night, I had the strangest
dream. (Not the one about the
identical triplets and the Loch
Ness monster.) I was straddling
the San Andreas fault, one
Birkenstock (that's how I knew it
was a dream) planted firmly on
each side. In my left arm I cradled
a wombat.
Suddenly, that wild and crazy
monk Junipero Serra appeared,
abandoning his usual post over
looking Route 280 North to tell
me that Saint Andrew was none
too pleased that this aberration of
the earth had been named after
him. Andy didn't live in the area
— he'd never even gone to Great
America, for God's sake. He'd
done nothing to deserve such a
thing.
In short, Junipero wanted it
made clear that it wasn't San
Andreas' fault.
Ouch.
I know, the other Bug's column
started out with a dream sequence
too. But I'm still working on my
style. Speaking of style, I'm not
sure I like this ladybug stuff.
Can't I be a praying mantis, or
even a termite? When I think of
ladybugs, I think of flying away
home because my house is on fire
and my children are gone. What a
gratuitous verse that is — where
is this poor ladybug's husband?
Probably in Reno. Typical.
OK, enough bearing my own
personal crosses.
.All of us are painfully
Vy • aware of the San Andreas
fault. How did it form? How long
is it? How old is it? How fast is it
moving? How does it cause earth
quakes? Can we stop it somehow?
A. I'm most often painfully
• aware of large objects lodged
in my ear or the sudden juxtaposi
tion of my skull and a slippery din
ing room floor. I'm not painfully
aware of the San Andreas fault.
Be stingy with adverbs — they're
likely to turn against you.
Saint Andrew's fault — even
though it isn't his, really — repre
sents the boundary between two
of Earth's tectonic plates: the
North Pacific plate on the west
side and the North American plate
on the east side.
These plates are two of many
such plates that float above the
Earth's mantle. The mantle is a
huge pot of boiling stuff. It's boil
ing because of heat from radioac
tive decay and heat left over from
the creation of the Earth. The

boiling mantle causes the plates
(which can be anywhere from
three to 30 miles thick) to move,
break and grate against each
other.
Bathtub analogy of the week:
The mantle is the water in a very
hot tub, and the plates are the
toys. (Except you have to have
enough toys to cover the entire
surface of the tub, since the plates
cover the entire surface of the
Earth.)
Above the plates, like the scum
on the top of alphabet soup when
you cook it without stirring, lie
the continents or, as we like to call
them, "solid ground." Right.
Researching this question was
enough to make me feel most
unsteady on my feet. (Almost as
unsteady as I was at the '70s
Party last week.)
The San Andreas fault was cre
ated when the mantle caused
these two plates to form and begin
grating against each other. Thus,
it's very, very, very old. (That's in
scientific terminology, of course.)
The fault is about 650 miles long
and it doesn't really move, since
it's not matter but the absence of
matter, like a doughnut hole. (Of
course, doughnut shops sell
doughnut holes . . . but that's
another story.)
But, the plates and the conti
nent resting on the plates do
move. Right now, the North
Pacific plate is moving past
the North American plate at any
where from five millimeters to 20
millimeters per year, depending
on whom you believe. So maybe
eventually some of California will
wind up in Oregon, and the Stan
ford Band won't have to ride in a


The
Science
Bug
bus for 10 hours to wreak satiric
havoc.
How does the fault cause earth
quakes? Well, it doesn't. Just like
Junipero said, it's not San
Andreas' fault.
Earthquakes are caused by the
sudden release of energy, when
stresses in the plates have
exceeded the strength of the rocks
that make up the plates. The fault
is simply the path of least resis
tance for the release of the energy.
It's like a rubber band snap
ping, which is probably why this
theory is called the elastic
rebound theory. (Just a surmise
on my part.)
Can we stop the San Andreas
fault? Sure. We can all stand with
one Birkenstock on one side and
one on the other, hold hands and
sing about buying the world a
Coke.
The mantle will stop heating,
"Family Circus" will be cut from
the comics page and grape Pop-
Tarts will make a comeback.

Nancy Volkers thinks full-time
employment is overrated. Ques
tions for the Science Bug can be
submitted to her box at the Storke
Publications Building.

monk Junipero Serra appeared,
abandoning his usual post over
looking Route 280 North to tell
me that Saint Andrew was none
too pleased that this aberration of
the earth had been named after
him. Andy didn't live in the area
— he'd never even gone to Great
America, for God's sake. He'd
done nothing to deserve such a
thing.
In short, Junipero wanted it
made clear that it wasn't San
Andreas' fault.
Ouch.
I know, the other Bug's column
started out with a dream sequence
too. But I'm still working on my
style. Speaking of style, I'm not
sure I like this ladybug stuff.
Can't I be a praying mantis, or
even a termite? When I think of
ladybugs, I think of flying away
home because my house is on fire
and my children are gone. What a
gratuitous verse that is — where
is this poor ladybug's husband?
Probably in Reno. Typical.
OK, enough bearing my own
personal crosses.
.All of us are painfully
Vy • aware of the San Andreas
fault. How did it form? How long
is it? How old is it? How fast is it
moving? How does it cause earth
quakes? Can we stop it somehow?
A. I'm most often painfully
• aware of large objects lodged
in my ear or the sudden juxtaposi
tion of my skull and a slippery din
ing room floor. I'm not painfully
aware of the San Andreas fault.
Be stingy with adverbs — they're
likely to turn against you.
Saint Andrew's fault — even
though it isn't his, really — repre
sents the boundary between two
of Earth's tectonic plates: the
North Pacific plate on the west
side and the North American plate
on the east side.
These plates are two of many
such plates that float above the
Earth's mantle. The mantle is a
huge pot of boiling stuff. It's boil
ing because of heat from radioac
tive decay and heat left over from
the creation of the Earth. The

boiling mantle causes the plates
(which can be anywhere from
three to 30 miles thick) to move,
break and grate against each
other.
Bathtub analogy of the week:
The mantle is the water in a very
hot tub, and the plates are the
toys. (Except you have to have
enough toys to cover the entire
surface of the tub, since the plates
cover the entire surface of the
Earth.)
Above the plates, like the scum
on the top of alphabet soup when
you cook it without stirring, lie
the continents or, as we like to call
them, "solid ground." Right.
Researching this question was
enough to make me feel most
unsteady on my feet. (Almost as
unsteady as I was at the '70s
Party last week.)
The San Andreas fault was cre
ated when the mantle caused
these two plates to form and begin
grating against each other. Thus,
it's very, very, very old. (That's in
scientific terminology, of course.)
The fault is about 650 miles long
and it doesn't really move, since
it's not matter but the absence of
matter, like a doughnut hole. (Of
course, doughnut shops sell
doughnut holes . . . but that's
another story.)
But, the plates and the conti
nent resting on the plates do
move. Right now, the North
Pacific plate is moving past
the North American plate at any
where from five millimeters to 20
millimeters per year, depending
on whom you believe. So maybe
eventually some of California will
wind up in Oregon, and the Stan
ford Band won't have to ride in a


The
Science
Bug
bus for 10 hours to wreak satiric
havoc.
How does the fault cause earth
quakes? Well, it doesn't. Just like
Junipero said, it's not San
Andreas' fault.
Earthquakes are caused by the
sudden release of energy, when
stresses in the plates have
exceeded the strength of the rocks
that make up the plates. The fault
is simply the path of least resis
tance for the release of the energy.
It's like a rubber band snap
ping, which is probably why this
theory is called the elastic
rebound theory. (Just a surmise
on my part.)
Can we stop the San Andreas
fault? Sure. We can all stand with
one Birkenstock on one side and
one on the other, hold hands and
sing about buying the world a
Coke.
The mantle will stop heating,
"Family Circus" will be cut from
the comics page and grape Pop-
Tarts will make a comeback.
