# See 7.0 live at MacFest next week
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
We take time out this week from the Sys
tem 7.0 saga to recommend that Mac enthu
siasts note the following on their calendars:
Next Tuesday and Wednesday, Apple Com
puter will host its annual MacFest Gala in
Maples Pavilion. Doors open at 10 a.m. each
day and close at 7 p.m.
If you've seen any of the ads in The Daily,
you are probably aware that System 7.0 is the
star of the show. Set to debut Monday, the
next generation of computer operating sys
tem has gone "golden" — Apple terminology
which means the final version that will reach
customers is being duplicated.
Word on the street, and here at the proving
grounds, is that 7.0 should be as solid as 6.0.7,
the current system. That is to say, it won't
crash all the time but there will be system
errors that are probably due to 7.0. They will
be no doubt fixed in 7.0.1 and its successors.
In the mailbox this week was a letter from
a 7.0 beta-tester who was getting a little
miffed at my endless barrage of criticism for
Apple's new baby. I'll address the specifics in
a few weeks but let me just say this now: Sys
tem 7.0 is revolutionary software. That does
not mean it will instantly revolutionize the
way we use computers.
System 7.0 has wonderful new features.
That does not mean it will replace all the
existing workarounds that have been devel
oped to provide those features in the past.
But back to MacFest. Over 40 Macintosh

vendors will be on hand to
show off over 100 software
packages and dozens of pieces
of hardware. Many will
demonstrate 7.0-compatible
versions of their wares or at
least offer a tease of what is to
come.
Although spreadsheets
might not excite everyone, a
trip by the Microsoft b<x)th to
see Excel 3.0 is a must for

those interested in System 7.0. The Red
mond, Wash, software giant delayed the
release of the new Excel in order to deliver it
with 7.0 features like publish and subscribe.
Excel, of course, is a lonely world where
there is little to publish to, but it is nonethe
less an example of things to come.
Claris, which has big plans for System 7.0
in the near future, will be a good preview spot
because they offer a full line of application
software, know what's up at Apple (since they
are a subsidiary) and are also delivering
HyperCard 2.1 — an AppleEvents-sawy ver
sion of the venerable stack maker.
Eventually, you will be able to type in sim
ple English commands in one central pro
gram — probably something called Apple-
Script in System 8.0 — that can control all
your other software. Many System 7.0 appli
cations will offer versions of this external con
trol, through Apple Events. HyperCard 2.1 is
the first to show off this powerful capability.
Those in the market for a hard drive
might visit IDS/Jasmine. This unlikely pair-

ing of an upstart drive maker
and former hard-disk giant
emerging from bankruptcy
offers the most unusual mass
storage device in a while.
Called the Clipper, it's a hard
disk that plugs into the SCSI
port and just rests on the
back of the Mac. It's about
the side of a pack of 3-by-5
index cards.
Adobe will be able to answer

any questions you might have about how
their Type 1 Postscript fonts will work in the
TrueType universe of System 7.0. They could
also probably show off their multiple master
font technology. Multiple masters are a revo
lution. They allow you to work with a base
font and not only squeeze it — as you can
with nearly any Mac application — but also to
vary the weight of the fonts.
One multiple master font can produce lit
erally hundreds of varieties. None of these
fonts exist yet, and no programs support
them, but type fiends will eat up multiple
masters once they become available.
Perhaps the best thing about MacFest is it
gives you the rare opportunity to do some
comparison shopping and get all of your not
so-dumb questions answered. Give it a look
see.

tems manager. His analysis of System 7.0
resumes in earnest next week and will thence
forth he based on the real McCoy.
