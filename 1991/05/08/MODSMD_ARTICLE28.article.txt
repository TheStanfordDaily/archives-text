## Baseball chances for title not dead 
### 
Oh no! The baseball team
dropped a game! What
ever is the Farm going to
do? Surely the Cardinal has
sealed its fate. That's it. No
regional invite now. No chance
to return to the College World
Series to try to pick up that
third national championship.
Get serious. Another loss is
not going to make the regional
selection committee run away.

It's time to stop whining
and take a look at reality.
Yes, the Cardinal went down
to UCLA — in 14 — Sunday.
Yes, Stanford was previously
swept by the Bruins. Yes, the
squad blew a series to the Tro
jans earlier in the season as
well.
But no, these losses do not
equivocate staying home dur
ing the end of May (though
they do mean no regional at
Sunken Diamond this year.)
The Cardinal is 34-17 for
the year, a very respectable
record. It's not last year's
unbelievable 59-12 (when
favored Stanford fell in the
CWS anyway). Nor is it 1987's
fantastic 53-17 (though it tech
nically could be if the Cardinal
doesn't drop another one the
remainder of the season.)
But those were two amazing
seasons. We're still looking at a
very good year here, folks.
Don't forget, we're talking
about baseball.
The sport where in the
majors — yes, the place where
you even get paid to act like a
10 year old — the best, the
creme de la creme, the pennant
winners lose 60 games a sea
son. And that's in a good year.
The worst, the cellar
dwellers — the Atlanta Braves
and Seattle Mariners — still
win 60.
To be expected to win all
your games in an almost year
round season is ridiculous.
To be expected to win all
your games in a sport like base
ball is even more absurd.
Baseball is a game of intelli
gence, concentration and even
luck as much as athleticism
and skill. It takes talent, espe
cially good pitching, to win (ask
the San Francisco Giants), but
it also takes everything falling
into place. Everything clicking.
And that doesn't happen
every single day of the season.
Bob Welch — one of the best
pitchers in the game right now,
last year's Cy Young winner
after an amazing 27-win year
— gave up 11 runs and 13 hits
in four and two-thirds innings
Sunday.
Did he think his pitching
career was over? Did he con
clude that he had lost his

touch?
Not in the least.
"When you get beat up, you
get beat up. You're not happy
about it. But you don't stop
and say, 'Oh my God, it's the
end of the world,' " Welch con
cluded.
He had a bad outing. As
most baseball players and
teams do. He knows he'll
bounce back.
The Athletics themselves,
three-time defending American
League Champions and cur
rently owners of the best
record in the American League
West, gave up 35 runs in two
games last weekend.
Did they concede the sea
son? Decide that two awful
ones in a row meant all hopes
for a fourth-straight pennant
were gone?
No way.
They were embarrassed.
They looked for answers to
explain why a usually stellar
pitching corps couldn't find the
strike zone if it was handed to
them on a silver platter. They
tried to figure out why every
thing that possibly could
seemed to go wrong on two
consecutive days.
But they consider them
selves very much still in the
hunt for the AL title.
They know that in baseball
the great ones have bad days,
the bad ones have good days,
and everything will come out in
the wash.
So does the Cardinal.
The team isn't happy that it
has been swept twice this sea
son or that it has lost 10 Six-
Pac games — almost as many
as its overall loss total last year.
The players aren't pleased they
kept dropping gimme non-con
ference match-ups whenever
they attained the No. 1 rank
ing. The Cardinal isn't thrilled
it will have to settle for second
place in the league and will
have to travel to a regional.
But after 34 wins, including
some very impressive victories,
Stanford also knows it has a
good team — one that deserves
to be in a regional despite its
mishaps.
A 34-17 record translates
into a 66.6 winning percentage.
The best in the majors, those
few teams who can pick up 100
W's in a season, head to the
World Series after winning
approximately 62 percent of
their contests.
So statistically Stanford is
doing OK.
The Cardinal also beat the
very same team 18-0 on Friday
that it lost to Sunday. And
Stanford is still ranked among
the top 10 in the nation.
It appears that the Cardinal
is actually keeping its head
above water.
So chill out.
And get ready for postsea
son play.

Stanford's spoiled fans whin

to be in a regional despite its
mishaps.
A 34-17 record translates
into a 66.6 winning percentage.
The best in the majors, those
few teams who can pick up 100
W's in a season, head to the
World Series after winning
approximately 62 percent of
their contests.
So statistically Stanford is
doing OK.
The Cardinal also beat the
very same team 18-0 on Friday
that it lost to Sunday. And
Stanford is still ranked among
the top 10 in the nation.
It appears that the Cardinal
is actually keeping its head
above water.
So chill out.
And get ready for postsea
son play.

Debbie Spander is tired of
Stanford's spoiled fans whin
ing every time the Card nine
drops a contest.

Oh no! The baseball team
dropped a game! What
ever is the Farm going to
do? Surely the Cardinal has
sealed its fate. That's it. No
regional invite now. No chance
to return to the College World
Series to try to pick up that
third national championship.
Get serious. Another loss is
not going to make the regional
selection committee run away.

It's time to stop whining
and take a look at reality.
Yes, the Cardinal went down
to UCLA — in 14 — Sunday.
Yes, Stanford was previously
swept by the Bruins. Yes, the
squad blew a series to the Tro
jans earlier in the season as
well.
But no, these losses do not
equivocate staying home dur
ing the end of May (though
they do mean no regional at
Sunken Diamond this year.)
The Cardinal is 34-17 for
the year, a very respectable
record. It's not last year's
unbelievable 59-12 (when
favored Stanford fell in the
CWS anyway). Nor is it 1987's
fantastic 53-17 (though it tech
nically could be if the Cardinal
doesn't drop another one the
remainder of the season.)
But those were two amazing
seasons. We're still looking at a
very good year here, folks.
Don't forget, we're talking
about baseball.
The sport where in the
majors — yes, the place where
you even get paid to act like a
10 year old — the best, the
creme de la creme, the pennant
winners lose 60 games a sea
son. And that's in a good year.
The worst, the cellar
dwellers — the Atlanta Braves
and Seattle Mariners — still
win 60.
To be expected to win all
your games in an almost year
round season is ridiculous.
To be expected to win all
your games in a sport like base
ball is even more absurd.
Baseball is a game of intelli
gence, concentration and even
luck as much as athleticism
and skill. It takes talent, espe
cially good pitching, to win (ask
the San Francisco Giants), but
it also takes everything falling
into place. Everything clicking.
And that doesn't happen
every single day of the season.
Bob Welch — one of the best
pitchers in the game right now,
last year's Cy Young winner
after an amazing 27-win year
— gave up 11 runs and 13 hits
in four and two-thirds innings
Sunday.
Did he think his pitching
career was over? Did he con
clude that he had lost his

touch?
Not in the least.
"When you get beat up, you
get beat up. You're not happy
about it. But you don't stop
and say, 'Oh my God, it's the
end of the world,' " Welch con
cluded.
He had a bad outing. As
most baseball players and
teams do. He knows he'll
bounce back.
The Athletics themselves,
three-time defending American
League Champions and cur
rently owners of the best
record in the American League
West, gave up 35 runs in two
games last weekend.
Did they concede the sea
son? Decide that two awful
ones in a row meant all hopes
for a fourth-straight pennant
were gone?
No way.
They were embarrassed.
They looked for answers to
explain why a usually stellar
pitching corps couldn't find the
strike zone if it was handed to
them on a silver platter. They
tried to figure out why every
thing that possibly could
seemed to go wrong on two
consecutive days.
But they consider them
selves very much still in the
hunt for the AL title.
They know that in baseball
the great ones have bad days,
the bad ones have good days,
and everything will come out in
the wash.
So does the Cardinal.
The team isn't happy that it
has been swept twice this sea
son or that it has lost 10 Six-
Pac games — almost as many
as its overall loss total last year.
The players aren't pleased they
kept dropping gimme non-con
ference match-ups whenever
they attained the No. 1 rank
ing. The Cardinal isn't thrilled
it will have to settle for second
place in the league and will
have to travel to a regional.
But after 34 wins, including
some very impressive victories,
Stanford also knows it has a
good team — one that deserves
to be in a regional despite its
mishaps.
A 34-17 record translates
into a 66.6 winning percentage.
The best in the majors, those
few teams who can pick up 100
W's in a season, head to the
World Series after winning
approximately 62 percent of
their contests.
So statistically Stanford is
doing OK.
The Cardinal also beat the
very same team 18-0 on Friday
that it lost to Sunday. And
Stanford is still ranked among
the top 10 in the nation.
It appears that the Cardinal
is actually keeping its head
