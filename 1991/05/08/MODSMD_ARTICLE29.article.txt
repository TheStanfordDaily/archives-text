# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With warm weather showing signs it's
here for good, it seems only natural Stanford
athletes should get to enjoy Mother Nature's
benevolence as much as anyone else.
This past week, two athletes especially
enjoyed being outside, earning The Daily's
Athlete of the Week honors in the process.
For their outstanding efforts, Chryste
Gaines of the track team and John Reid of
the baseball team are this week's winners.

Gaines, a 5-foot-8 junior from Dallas,
Texas, returned to her home state for the
Longhorn Invitational last Saturday, hoping
to qualify for the NCAA Championships.
She succeeded. She placed second in the
100 meters with a time of 11.28 and took
fourth in the 200 meters with a 23.23. More
important than her finishes were her times,
which were both under the automatic quali
fying standards.
"I went down to qualify . . . and that's
what I did," she said after the meet. Stanford
now has four athletes qualified for NCAAs
with a few more chances coming up in the
next weeks. The NCAA Championships
begin May 30 in Eugene, Ore.

Going into a three-game series with
UCLA down at Jackie Robinson Stadium last
week, the Cardinal baseball team had a lot to
be negative about. When they met the Bruins
earlier in the season, Stanford had been
gaining on first-place USC while UCLA
stood in last in the Six-Pac standings. But a
Bruin sweep ended all hopes of a Stanford
league title, and put UCLA back into the
postseason hunt.
If that weren't enough going into last Fri
day's series opener in Los Angeles, Stanford
had to remember blowing a 10-run lead to
lose in its most recent conference game. With
those thoughts nagging the squad, John
Reid, a 6-5 senior right-hander, took the
mound against the Bruins.
The result was a complete-game, three-hit
shutout that re-established momentum for
the Cardinal. After taking two of three on

the weekend, Stanford has now clinched sec
ond in the Six-Pac.
Reid was a big reason for the turnaround.
He walked two while striking out six after
being staked a pair of runs in the first. Stan
ford heated up offensively late in the game,
putting up 11 runs in the last two innings in
what turned out to be an 18-0 laugher. Reid
improved to 6-4 entering a four-game series
with California this weekend.
