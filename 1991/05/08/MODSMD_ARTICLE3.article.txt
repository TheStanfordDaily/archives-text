# Venezuela gives $400K donation
## 
### Julie Cantor Staff writer 
After several months of plan
ning, the Venezuelan government
has given Stanford's Center for
Latin American Studies a
$400,000 gift to support academic
exchange programs.
Center director Terry Karl, an
associate professor of political sci
ence, said she is delighted about
the gift.
"We're deeply committed to
[academic inquiry ] The Venezue
lans have helped make [this goal]
a reality," she said.
The Gran Mariscal de Ayacu
cho Foundation, a Venezuelan
government foundation, arranged
the donation with the Center,
located in Bolivar House, in order
to enhance learning and research
associated with Latin America.
Both Leopoldo Lopez Gil, pres
ident of the foundation, and John
Ford, vice president for the Office
of Development, signed the agree
ment Monday. Venezuelan Presi
dent Carlos Andres Perez, who
also spoke at the Graduate School
of Business during his visit to
Stanford, witnessed the event.
Karl said the impact of this

donation will be three-fold.
The "Venezuela-Stanford Aca
demic Exchange" program, the
first part of the gift, is an endowed
fellowship. A permanent fund will
be established to "support quali
fied Venezuelan students who
have been admitted to masters
programs at Stanford," Karl said.
Only the interest from the princi
pal donation will be used, she
added.
Preference for these grants will
be given primarily to Venezuelan
students, with other Latin Ameri
can and Caribbean students given
next priority. Also, students in
Humanities and Sciences pro
grams and Center for Latin Amer
ican Studies programs will be
given special consideration.
The program will "make an
important contribution to
increase the number of Venezue
lan [graduate] students at Stan
ford," Karl said.
The second aspect of this gift is
a fund for faculty and graduate
research in Venezuela. It is a
term-endowed fund, meaning
both the principal and the interest
will be spent over a five-year
period.
Having lived herself in
Venezuela for two years doing
research for her doctorate, Karl
said actually living and working in
the country "is the core of aca
demic experience."
With the last portion of the gift,
a fund for visiting scholars at
Stanford will be established
"aimed at encouraging Venezue
lan scholars to engage in produc
tive exchanges with Stanford."
Scholars who can benefit from
time at Stanford will be given the
opportunity to compare and con
trast personal research with fac

ulty here. Karl said she hopes to
"expand opportunities and pro
vide access to things that we (at
Stanford) have, like a first rate
library collection, to Venezuelan
scholars visiting Stanford."
Through this endowment, as
well as the new Stanford campus
in Chile, Karl hopes to "expand
contacts with Latin America. This
is an important step," she said.
Following the signing of the
agreement, Perez presented the
center with a bust of its name
sake, Simon Bolivar, as a sign of
his delight that the center was
named after this Venezuelan
national hero.
In return, Karl gave Perez a
thank-you gift — a Bolivar House
T-shirt signifying Perez as an offi
cial member of the center.
