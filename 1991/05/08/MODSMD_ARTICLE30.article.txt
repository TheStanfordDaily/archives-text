# Card burns Spartans, falls to UCLA
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's golf
team was hot, but UCLA was siz
zling. Again.
After gaining 29 strokes over
former leader Stanford on Mon
day, the Bruins yesterday carried
away the accolades of the Califor
nia Invitational with a one-under
par team total.
"UCLA just blew us out of the
water on our home course," said
junior Stephanie Davis.
The UCLA victory was not
unexpected after they had drilled
then-No. 2 Arizona in the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
two weeks ago.
But the Cardinal's 54-hole per
formance on the Stanford Golf
Course was still something to
savor.
The Cardinal linksters con
cluded the final round of the tour
ney with a five-over-par 298 to
trounce the top-ranked San Jose
State Spartans by six strokes and
claim second place.
"This is the first time we've
beaten San Jose State since I
don't know when," said Stanford
coach Tim Baldwin.
Rebounding from Monday's
atrocious final round in which the
Cardinal shot a 317 after leading
the field with a 297 in the morn
ing, Stanford overtook the Spar
tans with a nine stroke
turnaround yesterday to finish
the tournament at 914, 20 strokes
higher than UCLA's picturesque
score..
"We finally beat them,"
screamed junior Audrey Wooding.
Wooding was pivotal in the
Cardinal's ascent into the runner
up position. After hitting a phe
nomenal 72 and then a mediocre
80 on Monday, she returned to the
form that made her the 20th
ranked golfer in the nation.
Hitting a 73 in the final round,
Wooding finished with a 226 in a
four-way tie for fifth place with
Tracy Hanson of San Jose State,
Laree Sugg of UCLA and team
mate Adele Moore, who drilled the
top Cardinal score on the day with
an even par 73.
"I hit the ball poorly at first. I
didn't have much confidence,"
said Wooding. "But I got up and
down when I needed to later on."
Nonetheless, she hit for par on

the first nine holes. But on the
back nine it was like a roller
coaster.
She bogeyed the 10th hole,
birdied the 11th and 13th,
bogeyed the 14th, birdied the 16th
and bogeyed the 17th.
Finishing 15th individually,
veteran Jodi Figley, a senior, was
somewhat disappointed with her
final performance on The Farm.
"I'm kind of sad," said Figley.
"I wish that I could've played bet
ter."
Figley completed the final
round with a respectable 77 to
round out a score of 231, third
best on the Cardinal squad.
Junior Stephanie Davis turned
in yet another steady performance
with a 74 yesterday following
rounds of 78 and 79 on Monday to
share the 15th spot with Figley.

"I hit the ball great," said
Davis. "With the way I putted, a
74 was the worst that I could've
shot."
Junior Martha Richards came
through in the clutch for the Car
dinal yesterday with a one over
par after hitting an 81 and 89 the
day before. She finished with a
249.
The Cardinal's sterling perfor
mance in the Invitational almost
definitely assures them a fifth
seed behind San Jose State,
UCLA, Arizona and Georgia in
the upcoming NCAA Tournament
at Ohio State.
But Baldwin realizes the Cardi
nal is going to have to hit like it
did in the first and third round of
the California Invitational if they
are to have a shot at the NCAA
title.
"UCLA is hotter than heck
right now," he said. "Everyone's
going to have to play their best for
four days."
