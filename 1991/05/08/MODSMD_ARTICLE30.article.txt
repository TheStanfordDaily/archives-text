# Card burns Spartans, falls to UCLA
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's golf
team was hot, but UCLA was siz
zling. Again.
After gaining 29 strokes over
former leader Stanford on Mon
day, the Bruins yesterday carried
away the accolades of the Califor
nia Invitational with a one-under
par team total.
"UCLA just blew us out of the
water on our home course," said
junior Stephanie Davis.
The UCLA victory was not
unexpected after they had drilled
then-No. 2 Arizona in the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
two weeks ago.
But the Cardinal's 54-hole per
formance on the Stanford Golf
Course was still something to
savor.
The Cardinal linksters con
cluded the final round of the tour
ney with a five-over-par 298 to
trounce the top-ranked San Jose
State Spartans by six strokes and
claim second place.
"This is the first time we've
beaten San Jose State since I
don't know when," said Stanford
coach Tim Baldwin.
Rebounding from Monday's
atrocious final round in which the
Cardinal shot a 317 after leading
the field with a 297 in the morn
ing, Stanford overtook the Spar
tans with a nine stroke
turnaround yesterday to finish
the tournament at 914, 20 strokes
higher than UCLA's picturesque
score..
"We finally beat them,"
screamed junior Audrey Wooding.
Wooding was pivotal in the
Cardinal's ascent into the runner
up position. After hitting a phe
nomenal 72 and then a mediocre
80 on Monday, she returned to the
form that made her the 20th
ranked golfer in the nation.
Hitting a 73 in the final round,
Wooding finished with a 226 in a
four-way tie for fifth place with
Tracy Hanson of San Jose State,
Laree Sugg of UCLA and team
mate Adele Moore, who drilled the
top Cardinal score on the day with
an even par 73.
"I hit the ball poorly at first. I
didn't have much confidence,"
said Wooding. "But I got up and
down when I needed to later on."
Nonetheless, she hit for par on
