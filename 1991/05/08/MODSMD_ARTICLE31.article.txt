# NCAA tennis tourney starts here today

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
After months of preparation,
the NCAA women's tennis tour
nament finally gets underway
today.
Sort of.
The teams seeded 13 through
20 will compete for spots in the
final 16. Action will take place
both at the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium and the West Campus
Courts, located across Campus
Drive from Governor's Corner.
Matches start at 10 a.m. and 2
p.m.
The opener at the stadium pits
No. 15 Miami against No. 20
William & Mary. The Hurricanes
are led by a solid one-two punch of
Melissa Mazzotta and Mariette

Verbruggen.
While the Tribe might be con
tent with just making the tourna
ment, don't look for them to lay
down and die. Surprising frosh
sensation Kristine Kurth leads by
example for William & Mary. Even
though she doesn't get to play the
best in the nation, Kurth has
maintained a top-20 singles rank
ing this year. She's also rated in
doubles with Jane Wood.
The West Campus will feature
No. 16 Ole Miss and No. 17 San
Diego in its 10 a.m. match. The
No. 16 Rebels are led by Paloma
Collantes, but the No. 1 doubles
team of Alison Hill and Nina Top
per seems out of place. Hill-Top
per belongs at Western Kentucky
(look it up).
At 2 p.m., No. 19 Indiana meets

No. 13 LSU at the stadium. The
Tigers were not in the top 25
when the NCAA participants were
selected but made the field any
way. LSU's strengths are at the
bottom of both their singles and
doubles lineups. Indiana, the Big
10 champion, is led by Stephanie
Reece and Debbie Edelman.
Together, they're an excellent
doubles team. Separately, they can
beat a lot of people.
The late match on the West
courts is No. 18 San Diego State
versus No. 14 Tennessee. Stan
ford fans pay attention: The Car
dinal meets the winner. The Lady
Vols have been victimized by
injuries and weak doubles. The
Aztecs rebounded from four
straight season-opening defeats to
wind up with a solid 12-8 record.

Their doubles are weak as well.
Stanford will play at the sta
dium tomorrow at 3 p.m. Some
tickets should be available. Your
student or faculty /staff ID will not
get you in.
The team final is Sunday at 1
p.m. Individual singles and dou
bles take place next Monday
through Thursday.

Sandra Birch, Debbie Graham,
Teri Whitlinger and Heather Wil
lens were selected for the singles field.
Birch-Graham and Whitlinger-Laxmi
Poruri are in the doubles draw.

last night. Stanford accounted for five
of the nine all-decade players: Alycia
Moulton, Linda Gates, Patty Fen
dick, Birch and Graham.
