# Rush process may be shorter next year

After a Rush in which all fra
ternities but one met their quotas,
the Interfraternity Council has
suggested some structural
changes for the future — includ
ing shortening Rush.
Under the proposal, formal fra
ternity Rush would be reduced
from three to two weeks, and a
informal week without mandatory
parties might be held beforehand.
Many fraternities also praised
the IFC's new dry-Rush policy,
which was enacted this year.
Delta Tau Delta President Rob
Robbins advocates shortening
Rush in future years. A three
week Rush is difficult to arrange
with members' schedules, espe
cially since many Delts are ath
letes and have time-consuming
practices, he said.
This year 13 Delts missed most
of Rush to attend trips for the
baseball team. If Rush were short
ened, some people would be more
likely to rearrange their schedules
around it, Robbins said.
The idea of condensing Rush
also earned wholehearted support
from the Delta Kappa Epsilon fra
ternity, said Rush Chair John
Momtazee. A three-week Rush
was too long, and it strained the
group's creativity and finances, he
said.
Tom Boyd, the Kappa Alpha
rush chair, said a shorter Rush is
appropriate since most decisions
have been made by the third week.
An informal week without manda
tory parties is already conducted
by almost all fraternities, he said.
The IFC's new officers, to be
elected May 15, will discuss the
proposed change and make a deci
sion by the end of the year.
Many fraternities considered
this year's dry Rush a success,
even though they were initially
skeptical about the move because
it required a change in the type of
parties thrown, IFC President
Erik Jorgensen said.
But the number of pledges is
greater than last year, strengthen
ing the Greek system, Jorgensen

said. "Dry Rush went extremely
well. It surpassed our expecta
tions, definitely."
Last year, fraternities could
serve alcohol during the first and
third week of Rush, but the sec
ond week was dry. This year all
three weeks were alcohol-free.
The Sigma Phi Epsilon frater
nity supports the idea of a dry
Rush, a policy they have followed
since they formed on campus in
1985. They were the first frater
nity to hold a dry Rush.
"It takes off pressure from peo
ple who might shy away from join
ing a fraternity," said junior Steve
McEwen, the fraternity's Rush
chair. "We want to get to know the
rushee, not how much he drinks,"
he said.
Sigma Nu member Sean Caster
also praised the dry Rush system.
"It weeded out those who weren't
serious about Rush — those who
were just looking for a free beer,"
he said. The Sigma Nus have held
dry Rush since their founding on
campus in 1988.
However, Robbins said it is
more work and harder to main

tain interest during the three
weeks of an alcohol-free Rush.
KA members were initially
divided between supporting wet
and dry Rush, KA Rush Chair
Tom Boyd said. This year's suc
cessful Rush convinced most
members that dry Rush is fairer
to the rushees even if it is less fun
for the active members, he said.
This year's Rush was particu
larly successful for the KAs, Sig
Eps and Sigma Nus, who received
34, 31 and 26 pledges, respec
tively. The KAs more than dou
bled their 14-point quota by
receiving 31.5 points for this
year's pledge class.
Housed fraternity quotas
depend on the amount of space
available in each house. Fresh
man pledges count as one point
towards filling quota while sopho
mores, who can live in the house
for only two years instead of
three, count as one half-point.
Unhoused fraternities have no
quotas.
The KAs needed to take a large
number of pledges since they have
many graduating members, said

Doug Davis — Dally
Boyd, a junior. They had no prob
lem meeting this requirement, he
said.
The only fraternity that failed
to meet quota was the Beta frater
nity, which has been locally
autonomous since it lost its affili
ation with its national organiza
tion last fall. They received 3
sophomore pledges, which equals
1.5 points out of their 10.5 point
pledge quota.
Both the Sigma Chi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternities said
they would have liked to accept
more pledges but were restricted
by their limited housing space.
"We have a very overcrowded
house," said SAE member Joe
Reilly. "Nineteen is the maximum
number of pledges the University
would let us take."
The SAE house is already
expected to be 10 percent over
crowded, which is the University
imposed limit. Since many upper
classmen will be living in the
house next year instead of moving
off campus, the SAEs cannot
accept their usual 22-25 pledges,
Reilly said.
