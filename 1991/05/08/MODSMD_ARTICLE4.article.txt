# University looking into frat takeover
## 
### Jon Gifford Staff Writer 
The University is investigating
rumors that pledges of the cur
rently unhoused Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternity are trying to take over
the Theta Delta Chi house by join
ing both fraternities.
If the rumors prove true, both
fraternities would be violating
University policy on fraternity
housing as well as the Fundamen
tal Standard, administrators said.
Director of Row Housing Jack
Chin said the University "is con
cerned with the rumor that [peo
ple] are accepting bids at the
Theta Delta Chi" and the AEPi
fraternities so they can take over
the Theta Delt house in the future
as members of AEPi.
AEPi's spokesperson, Michael
Fox, said last night that some its
pledges were planning to join both
fraternities. These pledges
"wanted to live in a house for its
social benefits" but also desired
the brotherhood of AEPi, he said.
Fox said a laywer hired by his
fraternity found there was no
stated University policy prohibit
ing membership in more than one
fraternity. AEPi had 17 pledges as
of yesterday.
But Nancy Howe, director of
the Office of Student Activities
said, "The issue is not a legal
question. The University, not the
law, ultimately determines which
fraternities have which housing."
Theta Delt President Marc Fio

ravanti denied any wrongdoing on
the part of his fraternity. "There
is no truth to those rumors," he
said.
Steve Lyons, president of
AEPi, had no comment. Both fra
ternities refused to release their
pledge lists to The Daily.
"I have no problems with the
AEPis taking over another
house," Fox said.
Similar actions have appar
ently occurred in the past. "Last
year we lost six guys to Delta
Kappa Epsilon. We tried to take it
over but it didn't work," Fox said.
Fox said he was aware that tak
ing over another house would be
against University policy and real
ized the consequences of violating
the policy.
Chin said, "If the University
finds the rumor ... to be true,
both groups involved would lose
their recognition at the Univer
sity." The house would then be
placed in the Draw, he added.
The alleged takeover attempt
would violate the 1982 University
housing policy that says that the
University will not increase sub
jectively selective housing and
that fraternities that fail to meet
their University-set quotas will
lose their housing.
University officials met yester
day and decided to establish
guidelines that would prevent any
takeover attempt.
A takeover, if successful, would
