# Student's exclusion from feminist class under fire
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
The Feminist Studies Program is
embroiled in a controversy over aca
demic freedom and accessibility to its
courses involving a graduate student's
claims that he was dropped from a class
in an ideological dispute.
The student, Jan Kerkhoven, is a
third-year doctoral candidate in the
School of Education. According to
Kerkhoven, the instructor told him last
month that he could not stay in the class
because he had an insufficient back
ground in feminist studies. Kerkhoven,
however, claims his background was not
the reason — he says he was excluded

because of his ideology.
The teacher, Lecturer Susan Krieger,
declined to comment on the issue.
But Feminist Studies Program Chair
Sylvia Yanagisako said the issue is not
ideological — it is simply a matter of one
instructor's discretion in a course that
had been overenrolled. Krieger, Yanag
isako said, simply "decided that he was
not an appropriate student for the class,
and it was not a good class for him."
Last Thursday in Serra House, a
quarterly "feminist pedagogy" luncheon
— which usually attracts only a handful
of faculty — was "standing room only"
because the Kerkhoven case was dis-
cussed, Education Prof. Nel Nod
dings said.
Some faculty within the pro
gram are "very concerned" that
Kerkhoven's case will "set a
precedent of people leaving (Femi
nist Studies) courses when they
disagree with the majority opin
ion," said Assoc. Education Prof.
Myra Strober. However, she added
that she "can't tell yet in this case
whether that happened."
Strober defined the issues at
stake. "It's about the freedom of
students to take courses, and it's
about the freedom of instructors
to plan small classes and semi
nars," she said. "It's a tough ques
tion about whose rights are being
stepped on."
It is "very important for people
who don't agree with the majority
opinion to voice their opinions,
but it's also important that the
quality of disagreement is suffi
cient to maintain a high level of
discussion," she added.
The class that Kerkhoven was
dropped from, Feminist Studies
2038, is a methods course in fem
inist perspectives in social science
research. Enrollment is limited to
15, with preference given to
feminist studies majors because it

is part of the major's core curricu
lum.
Yanagisako said the class is
"very intensive." She noted that
Courses and Degrees outlines its
central question: "What happens
to soeial scientific description
when women's perspectives and
feminist values become central?"
Kerkhoven said he had prob
lems with that basic premise. His
personal ideology of humanism,
he said, prevents him from
excluding one half of human expe
rience by focusing only on
women's perspectives.
"In present Western society,"
he said, "there is unquestionably
repression of women, which is a
very serious issue. But linked
with that is a dehumanization of
everyone. What makes repression
so serious is that it is ultimately
repression of everyone."
Noddings said Kerkhoven's
point is a valid one, although "his
interpretation of humanism is not
the traditional one."
Noddings, who has been a
member of the board of Feminist
Studies Program for the last three
years, said she is concerned that
Kerkhoven's case is an example of
academic repressiveness.
"I'm inclined to agree with
Jan," Noddings said. "It's per
ilously close to a test of belief, and
that worries me a lot. A test of
belief should not crop into our
work."

'It's a tough question
about whose rights
are being stepped
on.'

Lack of preparation was not
the reason for Kerkhoven's exclu
sion, said Noddings, who taught
him in another feminist studies
course. "I don't think there is a
lack of understanding," she said.
"I think it's a difference of opin
ion."
Yanagisako said Kerkhoven's
approach "reduces the impact of
cultural differences. It denies the
significance of gender."
She denied that the feminist
studies ideology is repressive or
exclusionary.
"It is interested in scholarship
that critically challenges conven
tional ideas about gender," she

said. "There is no single approach
— there is a very wide range of
concepts, theories and methods."
The diversity of feminist stud
ies, Yanagisako said, is what has
made the field "so vibrant over
the last 20 years/' and that is why
it has been the focus of so much
debate.
Despite the field's diversity,
one element is central, Yanagisako
said. "It critically examines gen
der and makes that a central part
of what is studied. It is a rethink
ing of academic disciplines by ask
ing how the central concepts hold
up once one starts to focus on gen
der."
Kerkhoven said he approves of
the Feminist Studies Program as
a whole, but only disagrees with
this particular manifestation of
its ideology.
"I'm not saying that Feminist
Studies as a whole is repressive,"

he said, "but I'm being excluded
on the basis of my ideology, and
the chair of the Feminist Studies
Program does not acknowledge
that."
Yanagisako added that

grievance through the University
Ombudsperson or through the
student grievance process.
Kerkhoven raised the issue of
ideology in an unpublished letter
to The Daily that explained his
situation. In the letter, he empha
sized that he is not attempting to
"win the issue" and is "not seek
ing justification for myself or
compensation."
Rather, he is raising the issue
because this "may be a problem
for students in the future — stu
dents may not be permitted to
study these issues simply because
of their personal views."
Kerkhoven said he wants to

study feminist issues, but not
"with the intention of precluding
the entire humanist perspective."
The Feminist Studies Program
has been growing since its incep
tion at Stanford in 19§0. This
quarter, a record 27 coiirses are"
being offered in the major, accord
ing to program coordinator Lisa
Layne. She also noted that the
number of entries in the pro
gram's annual essay competition
has more than doubled since last
year, from 20 to 42.
The number of students major
ing in feminist studies has also
increased, said Yanagisako. The
program currently boasts about
15 declared students, with a num
ber of others considering declar
ing. She added that at least 10
people will graduate this year in
feminist studies. In the last 10
years, only 35 students graduated
with a feminist studies msyor.
