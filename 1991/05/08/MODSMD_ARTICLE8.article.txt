# Students would support speech control
## 
### Anita Presser Staff writer 
Twice as many students say the gov
ernment should be able to censor the
media as would support censorship of
sexually explicit videos such as
Madonna's "Justify My Love," accord
ing to a poll conducted by the American
Studies House.
Seventy-nine percent of students
polled said they agree with the First
Amendment protection of speech and
of the press, although 59 percent said
the government should have the right
to censor the media in some instances.
For example, 43 percent said the gov
ernment should have had the right to
control news about the war in the Per
sian Gulf.
On the other hand, only 30 percent
of the students interviewed believe the
government should have the right to
prevent the broadcasting of sexually
explicit music videos on network televi
sion.
The results indicate that Stanford
students agree in principle with the
First Amendment, but when faced
with a specific scenario that clashes
with their political views, a significant
number support government control of
speech, said Communication Prof.
Donald Roberts, the house's resident
fellow.
Although students tended to sup
port the abstract principle of free
speech and press, "When we put meat

It is frightening to see
these kind of numbers.'

on these questions, a general pattern of
inconsistency developed," he added.
Students in the house conducted the
random survey of 258 undergraduate
students, asking questions that
focused on the First Amendment and
the Second Amendment — the right to
bear arms.
Respondents could agree strongly,
agree, disagree or strongly disagree on
a question. Some students opted to
remain neutral on some questions,
although this option was not men
tioned, Roberts said.
Phrasing used in different questions
appeared to affect the answers,
Roberts said. In one instance, 42 per
cent of the respondents supported the
Second Amendment, which says the
right to keep and bear arms should not
be infringed. But only 30 percent said
the government should not be able to
control whether people can own guns.
Either way, the majority of students
did not support the Second Amend
ment.
Roberts concluded that the students
believe that times have changed and
that the government does have the
right to control the use and ownership
of firearms.

He also said he was disturbed by the
lack of support for the First Amend
ment. "I am stunned that about 20
percent of the students don't accept
the First Amendment," he said.
"The American public distrusts, dis
likes, and is unhappy with the mass
media." he said. "But if you believe, as
I do, that the First Amendment may be
the single most important thing that
makes us special... it is frightening to
see these kind of numbers Isupporting
censorship!, particularly from Stan
ford students."
The poll also found that 95 percent
of respondents believe minorities
should have the right to criticize the
majority.
Seventy-six percent of the students
believe the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People
should have the right to place paid
media announcements that criticize
white people, while only 50 percent
said the Ku Klux Klan should have the
same right to criticize minorities.
Roberts said these discrepancies
result from individual tastes. He said
students ask themselves, "If person 'A'
has the right to say something, then
why doesn't person 'B' have the same
right? . . . Because I don't like what
person 4 B' has to say."
"There is always tension between
the principle of getting ideas that you
hate out there and the discomfort of
having to deal with those ideas," he
said.
