# ASSU may fund sexual assault post
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
About 10 members of this year's and next year's
ASSU Senate and Council of Presidents plan to ask
the senate to spend $40,000 to fund sexual-assault
prevention and education projects the University
cannot afford.
The programs to be funded — which were pro
posed in February by the Sexual Assault Task Force
— include a temporary coordinator of sexual-assault
prevention, education and response services, an ori
entation program for incoming freshmen, an office
for sexual-assault prevention and education groups
and weekend self-defense workshops.
The total cost of the programs, including the coor
dinator's salary and benefits, will be about $40,770.
The ASSU Senate will vote on the move at its next
meeting on May 16, when it approves next year's
budget.
The move was prompted by a request to the ASSU
by the Coalition Against Sexual Assault, an umbrella
group representing the Rape Education Project, Pro
ject HEAR (Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape), Greek RAR members of the Sexual Assault
Task Force and other students and administrators
involved with sexual-assault issues on campus.
"It is great to see the students prioritizing this
crucial issue so highly — I look forward to the Uni
versity doing the same," said senior Susan Epstein, a
member of the Sexual Assault Task Force who co
authored the proposals and submitted them to the
senators and COP members-elect at a meeting last
night.
Both bills will explicitly commit the ASSU to fund
these programs for one year, after which the Univer
sity would be expected to assume the financial
responsibility for their continuation.
"It is a student priority, and I think the Univer
sity has to recognize that and make it a University
priority," said COP member-elect Beth Morgan, a
sophomore.
The University released the
Sexual Assault Task Force report
Feb. 5, but budget constraints
have prevented the implementa
tion of some of the task force rec
ommendations — notably a per
manent coordinator for sexual
assault response services.
The impetus for the current
proposals came from a meeting
between Epstein and University
President Donald Kennedy.
According to Epstein, Kennedy
asked her to develop the projects

at the end of last quarter. Last
month, he agreed to implement
some of them, pending the
approval of Sally Mahoney, acting
vice president for student
resources .
But because the University has
not made money available to
implement the projects, the coali
tion decided to seek funding from
alternative sources to begin work
now so that the programs would
be in place next year, Epstein said.
The proposal consists of two
bills to be placed before the sen
ate.
One bill will provide $1,650
from the ASSU annual reserve
funds to begin recruitment of ori
entation program facilitators and

to buy equipment for the self
defense workshops.
The second bill will amend the
annual budget to include the
remaining money needed to
implement the proposals. But if
the coalition receives money from
other groups it has lobbied, that
amount will be deducted from the
total given by the ASSU. The
coalition has already solicited
money from the Rape Education
Project and the Haas Public Ser
vice Center.
The people at last night's
meeting seemed confident that
there was enough bipartisan sup
port for the projects to assure pas
sage.
The ASSU and the temporary
coordinator will be responsible for

lobbying the administration and
other sources, such as student
groups and alumni, for the
resources to establish a perma
nent coordinator position.
To begin this effort, the coali
tion will run full-page ads in The
Daily, Campus Report and the
Stanford Observer urging stu
dents, faculty and staff to write to
the administration expressing
their support for the coordinator
position.
In addition, members of this
year's and next year's COPs plan
to schedule a meeting with
Kennedy, ASSU financial officers
and possibly some members of the
coalition to discuss the issue fur
ther.
