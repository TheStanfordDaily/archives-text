# Reges controversy part of larger debate over drug policy
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stuart Reges' leap into national noto
riety for openly flouting University drug
rules comes at a time when a growing
number of legislators and drug experts
are questioning U.S. drug policy.
Like Reges, many experts have pro
posed the legalization of drugs. This push
coincides with an ever-increasing
national drug war — along with frustra
tion about its lack of results. In recent
years a number of prominent people have
engaged in sharp debate over the legaliza
tion of drugs.
Proponents assert that decriminaliza
tion would end the organized crime that
has grown around drugs. Taxes on the
drugs, along with part of the $8 billion
spent annually on the drug war, could be
used for education and treatment pro
grams, which currently cost $500 million
yearly.
But critics claim that legalization
would increase the number of addicts and
that people with no understanding of the
effects of exotic new drugs would suffer
severe damage. They add that medical
costs to cover the new addicts would be
prohibitive and that the legalization of
drugs would hurt social mores.
Reges, a computer science senior lec
turer who claims to have violated Stan
ford drug rules in protest of U.S. drug pol
icy, said he thinks all drugs should be
legalized because, among other things, it

would lead to a reduction in drug-related
crime.
Reges, who is currently on paid admin
istrative leave, is scheduled to meet
tomorrow with Dean of the School of
Engineering James Gibbons. Gibbons
and Provost James Rosse are expected to
make a decision soon regarding Reges'
status.
The debate over legalization has cre
ated a wide spectrum of responses and
solutions.
Patrick Connell, acting director of
emergency services at Oakland's High
land Hospital, said he thinks the govern
ment should regulate distribution of
drugs to people over 21 through sale in
state "stores," in much the same way that
alcohol is sold in some states.
The drugs would be sold at the cost of
production plus tax, like alcohol, Connell
said. He said his solution would definitely
lead to higher levels of addiction, but
added he thinks it would be an acceptable
tradeoff to improve the quality of inner
city life.
But clinical psychologist Bob Matano,
director of Stanford Hospital's Drug and
Alcohol Program, said the "broader set of
problems" created by legalization would
outweigh the benefits of a decrease in vio
lence. Problems would include an
increase in the number of addicts and a
message that drug use is acceptable.
Many experts said legalization may
increase addictions in the short run but
would stabilize over time. Robert Garner,

director of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Ser
vices for Santa Clara County, noted that
most drug use is experimental and that
few people actually become regular users.
Experts also note that alcohol and
tobacco cause a far greater number of
deaths than illegal drugs.
However, Matano said the health
industry has been trying to undo effects
of alcohol and nicotine addiction and
added that there is no reason to add more
problems by legalizing drugs.
He said U.S. drug policy should focus
on preventing drug dependency.
But Garner said, "We need to identify
use and abuse as a health problem we've
chosen to criminalize" at an enormous
cost.
Drug abuse "is the only disease that
doesn't get treatment on demand in our
society," he said.
During the past several years, many
politicians and other officials have joined
the debate over the legalization of drugs.
In an address at a conference on drug
policy held at the Hoover Institution in
November, Nobel Prize-winning
economist Milton Friedman said, "The
attempt to make the use of drugs a crimi
nal matter is destroying our poorer neigh
borhoods in city after city and is creating
a whole climate that is destructive to the
people who live there."
Noting a rise in homicide rates during
the Nixon and Reagan drug wars, Fried
man, a Hoover senior research fellow, pre
dicted homicides would drop after decrim

inalization.
However, "No one can rule out the pos
sibility that 50 percent of the population
would become drug addicts. Nobody has
come up with positive evidence," he said.
Since 1972, Friedman has advocated
the legalization of all drugs.
In a 1989 open letter to then-Drug
Czar William Bennett in The Wall Street
Journal, Friedman wrote, "Illegality cre
ates obscene profits that finance the mur
derous tactics of the drug lords; illegality
leads to the corruption of law enforce
ment officials; illegality monopolizes the
efforts of honest law forces so that they
are starved for resources to fight the sim
pler crimes of robbery, theft and assault."
He added that legalizing drugs would
make them less expensive. In that case,
the inexpensive drug crack cocaine —
which was created because most drugs
were very expensive — would never have
been developed, he said.
Bennett, in his response to Friedman's
letter, said the toll of drug use is already
too high and addiction would skyrocket
with legalization. "It's fanciful to suggest
that [legalization] would make crime van
ish," he said, adding that "drug addicts
always want more drugs than they can
afford, and no legalization scheme has yet
come up with a way of satisfying that
appetite."
Former Secretary of State George
Shultz, in an October 1989 address at the
Graduate School of Business, surprised
the political world when he said, "We need

to at least consider and examine forms of
controlled legalization of drugs."
"No politician wants to say what I just
said, not for a minute," he said. Though
he welcomed increased efforts by the
Bush administration in law enforcement,
education and treatment, he said the gov
ernment needs to eliminate the profit
motive in drugs.
The White House scoffed at his ideas.
Spokesperson Marlin Fitzwater said
Shultz had "been on the West Coast too
long."
Since then, Shultz, who is now a Dis
tinguished Fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, has been reluctant to discuss his
views on the issue, and he declined an
interview yesterday.
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke
shocked a 1988 conference of mayors
when he advocated decriminalization,
saying illegal drug use should be a health
concern, not one of criminal justice.
"Have we failed to learn the lessons of
the Prohibition era?" he asked. "Now is
the time to fight on the only terms the
drug underground empire respects —
money. Let's take the profit out of drug
trafficking."
But Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman
of the House Select Committee on Nar
cotics Abuse and Control, disagreed in a
1988 New York Times editorial. "What
gives anybody the impression that legal
ization would deter many jobless and eco
nomically deprived people from resorting
to crime to pay for their habits?"
