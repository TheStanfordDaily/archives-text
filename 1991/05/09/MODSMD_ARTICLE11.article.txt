# Hoover creates new fund-raising position

### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
In an effort to bolster revenues, Hoover
Institution Director John Raisian has created
a new fund-raising position.
The goal of the new post, the associate
director for resource development, is to
"increase activity into getting . . . fuel for the
Institution," Raisian said. Hoover is "not
without its fiscal challenges," he added.
"It is a question of getting on proper foot
ing. For the last couple of years. . . we have had
to dip into the reserves."
Raisian announced last week that he had
selected Catherine Smith, formerly of the Cato
Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., to
fill the position. He said he had sought "to
recruit an individual who has experience on
the business side of fund raising and public
relations."
One of Smith's major responsibilities will

be to improve donor relations and to help
develop a new strategic plan for the Institu
tion, he said.
Smith, scheduled to begin work Monday,
will be teamed with Thomas Henriksen, asso
ciate director for program development.
Raisian said that although responsibility
for fund raising ultimately lies with him,
Smith will "help me use my time as best as
possible."
The Institution annually raises roughly 25
percent of its annual $20 million budget from
donations. The University contributes $4 mil
lion from its general fund to cover two-thirds
of the cost of maintaining Hoover's libraries.
The remaining $11 million comes from
earnings from the Institution's $120 million
endowment and from its $80 million reserves.
The reserves are considered a part of the
endowment.
In light of the current University budget
crisis resulting from the indirect cost contro-

versy, Raisian said Hoover anticipates its
library funding may be reduced slightly. He
said the library budget will be adjusted accord
ingly.
Continuing to spend from the reserves, he
said, "could have long run ramifications on the
size of [Hoover] in the future."
In addition to doubling its support base,
Hoover's long-term goal is to stop having to
tap into its reserves and to allow them to
remain untouched as part of the endowment,
Raisian said.
The University administration has wel
comed the creation of the new post. "We have
been waiting for it for a long time," said
Richard Bennett, associate campaign director
in the Office of Development. "We are very
supportive and pleased."
Bennett said there was no conflict between
fund raising by Hoover and by the University.
"There is absolutely no friction. . . [It is] help
ful to them and to us," he said.
