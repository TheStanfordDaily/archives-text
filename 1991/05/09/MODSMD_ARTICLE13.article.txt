treatable thyroid condition and not a heart ail

Iraq grants amnesty for rebels
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — The government
yesterday issued a pardon for those involved in
the rebellion against President Saddam Hus
sein, but said it was excluding those guilty of
rape or premeditated murder.

Revolutionary Command Council shortly after
Saddam met with a delegation of Kurdish lead
ers in Baghdad seeking an agreement that
would end their rebellion in the north.
The text of the order, carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency, said:
"All Iraqi fugitives at home or abroad who
were being sought for trial on charges of violat
ing the law during the recent disturbances are
hereby pardoned.
De Klerk announces progress
in addressing township violence
PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — President
F.W. de Klerk said he and Nelson Mandela had
made "good progress" yesterday toward resolv
ing differences over township violence, and the
government announced new moves to halt the
killings.
I)e Klerk spoke after a four-hour meeting
with the African National Congress leader, a
last-minute attempt to resolve an impasse that
threatened negotiations to end the apartheid
system of white domination.
The South African Press Association said de
Klerk reportedly agreed to two key ANC
demands: a ban on most weapons at public
gatherings, and conversion of all-male workers'
hostels — frequent targets of violence — into
family units.
House panel would authorize
women to fly in combat missions
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a surprise move,
the House Armed Services Committee yester
day approved legislation that would authorize
the Pentagon to assign women pilots to fighter
and bomber combat missions.
The measure, adopted on a voice vote in
closed session, was an amendment to the
defense department's fiscal 1992 budget.
Under current law, women in the Navy,
Marine Corps and Air Force are barred from
serving in combat jobs. The Army is not cov
ered under the same statute, but has written
its own regulations in line with the law.
