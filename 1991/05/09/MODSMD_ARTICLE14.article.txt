# Bangladesh appeals for more helicopters

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — 'Ihe
government appealed to foreign coun
tries for more helicopters yesterday to
augment its efforts to get food,
medicine and clothing to survivors of
last week's cyclone.
"We have at the moment 13 heli
copters, and these are going to farflung
areas," Information Secretary
Manzur-e-Moula told a news confer
ence.
He said Bangladeshi Air Force heli
copters, along with three choppers
from India and two from Pakistan,
made a total of 19 relief flights yester
day to southern and southeastern
Bangladesh, where more than 125,000
people perished in the cyclone.
"We need more helicopters," he

said. "Any offer made by any friendly
country would be of help to us."
How much difference 10, 20 or even
100 additional helicopters would make
is uncertain.
As many as 10 million people live in
the cyclone-hit region, according to the
government, which says it is still try
ing to assess how many people need
help — and what kind.
Communications in most of
Bangladesh are tentative in the best of
times. After cyclones, which along with
floods and tornadoes strike here with
deadly regularity, the task of assessing
needs and reaching victims is even
more difficult.
Some foreign aid donors question
how much a few more helicopters — or

even a few more squadrons — would
help.
"Supplying helicopters is an option
that we are working on urgently, but
our main objective is to make the most
constructive contribution that we
can," Richard Boucher, a U.S. State
Department deputy spokesperson, said
in Washington.
Moula, the Bangladeshi official, said
he could not say how many people
were reached by yesterday's relief
efforts, which included truck convoys
as well as helicopters.
But he said the helicopters dis
tributed 50 tons of material, including
rice, molasses, bread and 600 cans of
drinking water.
Many cyclone victims are stranded

on islands surrounded by salt water in
the Bay of Bengal or on land where the
only water is dirty with mud and pol
luted by decaying bodies of people and
animals.
So far, about $200 million worth of
aid has been pledged by 26 nations,
Moula said.
Meanwhile, the death toll from
another disaster reached 455 yester
day.
The tornado that struck 25 miles
north of Dhaka shortly after sundown
Tuesday killed 40 people on the spot
and five more died after being admit
ted to a Dhaka hospital, Moula said.
About 200 other people were
injured in the tornado that hit near the
industrial town of Tongi, he said.
