# House approves Brady bill

WASHINGTON (AP) - Gun control
opponents are looking to the friendlier con
fines of the Senate to shoot down a House
passed bill that requires a seven-day wait
ing period for handgun purchases.
"We're not going home," said James
Baker, chief lobbyist of the National Rifle
Association. "There's going to be a lot of
give and take over the next several months.
. . . This is far from over."
The House yesterday approved 239-186
the so-called Brady bill after first defeating
an NRA-backed plan to scrap the waiting
period in favor of a national hotline for
instant criminal checks. The Justice
Department had said it would take years
and millions of dollars to implement a com
puter hotline in all 50 states.
It was the biggest victory for gun control
advocates in Congress since the 1968 gun
control act, which banned interstate gun
sales. Just three years ago, in a similar con
frontation, the NRA plan won over Bradv,
228-182.
"The stranglehold of the NRA is now
broken," said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-
N.Y. "They had this aura of invincibility . . .
and they were beaten."
Lawmakers on both sides said the dra
matic change in the House stance reflected
some anti-NRA sentiment and, more
importantly, public frustration with rising
gun violence in the country â€” symbolized
by the bill's best-known advocate, former
White House press secretary James Brady.
Disabled since his wounding during an

attempt on President Reagan's life in 1981,
Brady watched from his wheelchair as the
House approved the bill.
"I told Ronald Reagan that in the end,
truth wins out," Brady said. "Truth did win
out this time. The little guys won. This is
not gun control, it's crime control."
If the Brady bill becomes law, gun deal
ers would pass along to authorities the
names of potential gun buyers. The police
could, but would not be required to, then
check for histories of crime or mental disor
ders.
The Senate, however, has a different ori
entation than the House. Since its member
ship is based on population, the House has
a far more urban tilt than the other cham
ber.
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a
Brady bill supporter, predicted a tough fight
but said the House vote provided "real
momentum for effective laws to keep guns
out of the hands of criminals."
In the Senate, the gun control issue will
become formally entangled with other anti
crime measures. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee, has said he wants to produce an overall
crime bill.
"The president is committed to a com
prehensive approach to combat violent
crime, not to partial solutions," Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said in a state
ment following the House vote. He repeated
Bush's threat to veto the Brady measure if
it were sent to his desk alone.
