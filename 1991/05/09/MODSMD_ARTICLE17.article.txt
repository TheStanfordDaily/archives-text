MOSCOW (AP) — Coal miners in western Siberia
agreed yesterday to end their two-month strike, in
what appeared to be a final chapter in the nation
wide work stoppage that cost the Soviet economy
more than $8 billion.
All but 12 mines in the vast Kuznetsk basin will
resume work on Friday, said Sergei Zelenkov, the
strike committee co-chairman.
Six pits on the Far East island of Sakhalin had
been the only other mines still taking part in a strike
that began March 1, according to the Independent
Union of Miners.
Miners in the F"ar East region of Vorkuta earlier
voted to resume work Friday but will continue to

press for satisfaction of all their demands, the Tass
news agency reported.
At its height, the strike idled from one-quarter to
one-third of the country's 600 mines and 300,000 of
the 1.2 million miners.
Kuznetsk miners refused to resume work until
they could study a document under which President
Mikhail Gorbachev agreed on Monday to relinquish
control over half the nation's coal mines to the Rus
sian Federation, led by Boris Yeltsin.
The Sakhalin miners also were holding out for
proof that they will be transferred to Russian juris
diction.
Copies of the agreement were hand-delivered to

the Kuznetsk miners yesterday, after they refused to
consider a text dictated over the telephone from
Moscow.
Miners' representatives from 16 cities in the
Kuznetsk basin voted 14-2 in favor of joining the
growing return-to-work movement, Zelenkov said by
telephone from Kemerevo. They represent 41 of the
region's 53 mines, he said.
Miners at 12 pits in Beriozovsk and Leninska-
Kuznetsk will hold separate meetings Friday to
decide whether to prolong the walkout, he said.
Miners said they will keep their strike committees
in place and would resume the walkout in two
months if the Kremlin reneges on its promises.
