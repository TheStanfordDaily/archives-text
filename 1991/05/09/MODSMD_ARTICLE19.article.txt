## No sneaking around 
### 
Unhoused fraternities
should get a crack at
houses that come up

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
done right, you have to do it
yourselves.
At least that's what the Alpha
Epsilon Pi fraternity thinks about
becoming a housed frat, if rampant
campus rumors are true.
Fraternity members have asked
the University time and time again
for a house. They've even volun
teered to finance and build their
own house.
But repeated efforts have fallen
flat in the face of a University pol
icy which prohibits the increase of
selective campus housing.
Finally fed up, the AEPs have
decided to take a new approach: If
the University won't give them a
house, they'll just take one.
Some AEPi pledges have report
edly joined another fraternity in
hopes of gradually taking over that
group's house.
Granted, the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity — which currently owns
the house in question — isn't com
plaining. In fact, the president says
the rumors are false and he has
had little contact at all with the
AEPis.
But an AEPi spokesman and a
student who was offered a bid
admit there may be some double
dealing going on.
The spokesman said this week
that some pledges are planning to
join both groups and that the fra
ternity tried a similar approach
with another house last year.
University administrators are
investigating and say students
involved could be violating the
Fundamental Standard through

"duplicity."
Maybe the AEPis believe they've
exhausted all the "legal" options in
their struggle to become housed.
But that doesn't mean the fra
ternity should sneak around to
beat the system.
Just when Greek groups are try
ing to legitimize themselves to the
Stanford community and take on a
more self-regulating role, attempt
ing to pull the wool over the eyes of
administrators can't be received
favorably.
The AEPis may think the
current policy is unfair, but so do
the Sigma Nu and the Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternities. They, too,
have previously petitioned the Uni
versity for housing.
Even if the University were to
back down on its policy, should the
AEPis necessarily be next in line
for a house — just because they
were the most clever?
There has to be a better way.
If the University does support
maintaining some selective hous
ing, as some administrators have
said this year, it should allow
unhoused fraternities to take over
the houses of those that fail to
meet quota for a given number of
years.
Preference should be given to
groups who have been petitioning
for housing the longest.
Taking houses away, and never
giving any back, would eventually
end housed fraternities. If that's
the University's goal, someone
should say so.
If not, administrators should
seriously reconsider the current
policy. That way, unhoused frater
nities will have some reasonable
rules to play by.
Until then, the AEPis and oth
ers should continue their fight for
housing. But the fraternities
should try to change the system,
not beat it.
