We, too, violate the University's drug and alcohol policy

AS TEACHING ASSISTANTS and
employees of Stanford University,
we feel compelled to respond to the
recent placement of Stuart Reges on aca
demic leave.
Reges has brought into the open what
was previously a commonly understood
but unstated fact: violations of Stan
ford's Policy on Controlled Substances
and Alcohol are routine occurrences on
the Stanford campus. We find it repug
nant that such a policy exists at all; how
ever, our primary concern is not the sub
stantive content of the policy, but rather,
the manner in which this policy has been
enforced.
Clearly, the University is not serious
about enforcing the policy; a quick Fri
day night tour of the parties, dormitory
rooms and fraternities on campus would
convince anyone that violations of the
policy are readily tolerated, so long as
the perpetrators don't make too much
noise.
But the University has now shown
itself to be quite serious about prosecut
ing those who cause a political commo
tion; open protest of the policy has
proved to be the only instance in which
the University is willing to take action.
We can conclude only that Stanford is

not interested in enforcing the policy per
se, but in enforcing silence regarding it,
since open acknowledgement of what
really takes place on campus might cause
further embarrassment in the media, or
worse, the revocation of government
funds.
Regardless of one's position on drug
and alcohol consumption, writing letters
should not be a punishable offense. And
those letters are the only offenses that
separate Reges from many other people
at this university.
For instance, I have personally vio
lated every prohibition for which Stuart
is currently under investigation: I have
possessed controlled substances on the
Stanford campus; I have, at fraternity
events, with students at the conclusion
of courses, and in my dormitory room,
provided alcoholic beverages purchased
with my own money to students whom I
knew were under 21; I have myself used
alcohol while under 21 as a student and
employee of Stanford University.
And evidently worst of all, I have held
discussions with students in which I
opposed current policies on drug prohibi
tion, and advocated the use of certain
drugs such as marijuana in various situ

ations. All of these events took place
while I was either a teaching assistant or
instructor for the CSIO6 classes, and the
students involved either had taken or
were taking these classes or were aware
that I was an employee of the Computer
Science department.
University President Donald Kennedy
has stated that conversation between
employees and students constitutes pun
ishable conduct and not protected
speech. Yet our responsibilities as educa
tors and as individuals direct us to
express our convictions, and to offer
advice based on those convictions, even
when this may directly contradict Uni
versity policies.
The very foundation of intellectual
advancement lies in pointing out where
accepted doctrine is wrong, not in parrot
ing accepted beliefs. It is true that a pri
vate university can discipline its employ
ees even for protected "conduct"; but
when it chooses to prosecute precisely
those who would point out that the pres
ident has no clothes, it has become some
thing less than an institute for intellec
tual inquiry. We have no desire to teach
in such an atmosphere — therefore, if
this be "conduct," let us make the most
of it:

The co-signatories, as employees of
Stanford University, are potentially in
violation of Stanford University's Policy
on Controlled Substances and Alcohol
and recommend that an investigation
proceed on the grounds of:
• Having knowingly facilitated the
consumption of alcoholic beverages by
underage students,
• Having held non-classroom conver
sations with students in which the use of
controlled substances and the underage
consumption of alcohol was defended
and/or advocated,
• Refusing to relinquish the right to
openly defend and discuss actions, in
direct violation of Stanford University's
Policy on Controlled Substances and
Alcohol, while an employee of Stanford
University.
In order for Stanford to comply with
federal law, we believe that we must be
investigated so as to ensure the consis
tent application of sanctions.
We await a proper response.
