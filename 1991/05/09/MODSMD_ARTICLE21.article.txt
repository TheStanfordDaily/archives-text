# Stanford's bikers are a menace to drivers and pedestrians

Bicycles can be lethal weapons to even
the casual observer.
Within the last two months I have
been a near victim of careless and
thoughtless bicycle riders on four sepa
rate occasions. Once I was trapped on the
sidewalk, caught between a fast rider
coming in each direction

The second incident occurred in the
Inner Quad when a rider cut sharply
around a pillar in front of Memorial
Church. I saved myself by putting out
my arms to stop him from knocking me
over. The next day a visiting scholar
from Sweden wasn't so lucky — he was
knocked down in the Inner Quad and
had to be taken to the hospital.
The third and fourth incidents
involved bikers not stopping at the stop
signs at the corners of Santa Teresa
Street and Samuel Morris Way. One just
laughed and rode on when I called "stop"
and shook my finger at her; only her two

companions stopped.
In the fourth incident a biker rode
merrily on after brushing past two of us
as we were about to step up on the curb
after crossing the street in the crossing
zone.
It was recently noted by both emer
gency team members and University
safety officials after an emergency drill
at the Terman Engineering Center that
should there be a real emergency, people
would have trouble exiting the building,
as bikes are parked in front of the exits.
This is true all over campus.

Bikers can be fined for violating the
vehicle code on the streets, but the police
can do little about offenses in the inner
areas of the campus. Bikers, have respect
for your lives as well as those of others in
the community!
And remember, not every motorist on
this campus knows that bikers are not in
the habit of stopping for stop signs —
you could wind up dead or seriously
injured.
