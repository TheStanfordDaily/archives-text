## Latino men aren't that bad 
### 
MY BROTHER VINCE, my confi
dant since childhood, still calls me
up with strange stories, ideas and
requests. A few days ago, he asked me to
write a column that would dispel the
myth of the machismo that surrounds the
Chicano man.
About a dozen people have asked me to
write about the Chicano male. ... I feel
obliged to comply with this latest request
to salvage the reputation of Chicano men,
especially since the most important men
in my life — my father and two brothers
— and many of my friends are Chicano
males.
There is a stigma of sexism attached to
Latino men. People take for granted the
stereotype of the sexist, patriarchal, vio
lent and overly masculine Latino man.
After all, wasn't the word "machismo"
coined in reference to Latino men?
There is no doubt that many Latino
men are sexists — like the great majority
of men everywhere. A double standard
does exist in Mexican society and, there
fore, in Chicano society as well. It is a fact
that men enjoy more freedoms than
women and are expected to be more
assertive and responsible than women
are. In fact, it's a lot like Western society.
"Honor" is an important part of social
and especially gender relations in Mexico
and an essential aspect upon which
"machismo" is based.
It is unfair, however, to think of Latino
men as being more virulently sexist than
other men.
In fact, much of the new social science
research on Latino families suggests that
Latino men are not significantly more

domineering than men of other cultures.
Indeed, a lot of the new research paints a
more favorable view of the Latino man
than was once presented — and it does, in
some ways, clean up the tarnished image
of the Mexican and Latino male.
Overthrowing the image of the skirt
chasing, tequila-drinking, Latin lover has
been hard because the mainstream media
still adores that caricature. Some Latino
males cling to this image because, in some
strange way, they feel it asserts their mas
culinity. Even at Stanford, many Latino
males have been slow to catch on to the
new sociological findings about them.
Some Latino males actually internalize
the dominant stereotypes and strive to
emulate them; they view it as a masculine
ideal. A Chicano acquaintance conve
niently argued with me recently that I
should excuse his sexism because it was
culturally based.
In addition to the obvious absurdity of
this argument, I am bothered by the fact
that this particular Chicano wanted to
justify his sexism by appealing to a nega
tive stereotype about himself and his
kind, that he would willingly take an
image about himself that is dictated by
white society and then embrace it as if it
were part of his culture.
Moreover, he places a warped, restric
tive image not only upon himself but on
the Latina woman as well. If Latino men
become the super macho-males, then
their counterparts are forced to become
overly feminized, submissive and docile
partners — if indeed the men choose
them to be their partners.
Even "enlightened" Latinos at Stan

ford fall prey to this stereotype, and I feel
they are sometimes in danger of conform
ing to the stereotype only too well. More
over, they expect Latinas to conform to
the same ideals of Mexican propriety and
honor that they think is essential to all
"good" Chicanas.
Chicano men, like any other group, are
a complex set of individuals with various
personalities, ideas and viewpoints. They
are by no means some monolithic entity,
but for the purposes of this column, I
realize that I have reluctantly had to
make some generalizations. But while
I'm at it, let me generalize some more.
Latino men are really not all that bad,
especially those that are in higher educa
tion, with the following exception: Some
think they can get away with more than
they should because of their relative
scarcity in higher education. Generally,
they are less politically inclined, in any
direction, than most Chicanas. And
finally, they think they're raza gold.
Other than that, they're just fine.

Delia Ibarra would like to remind the
men in the Latino community that they
asked her for this column and that she
was only happy to comply.
