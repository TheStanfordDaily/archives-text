# New HIV test procedure to be offered
## Cowell Student Health Center to begin peer-counseling option 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center is planning
to introduce a peer-counseling option for stu
dents undergoing HIV testing, according to Dr.
John Dorman, the center's director of public
relations and outreach.
Organizers plan to implement the new
option in the fall, after a trial period during
the summer. Dorman said the logistics of the
proposal are currently being worked out.
Under the current system, students consid
ering being tested for the Human Immunode
ficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, are
required to meet with a physician both before
and after the test for counseling.
The new plan would offer students the
option of meeting with a state-certified peer
counselor instead of a Cowell physician. In
order to be certified, students would partici
pate in a three-day training program through
the California Health Department.
The intent of the peer counseling program
is to add a new dimension to Cowell's services,
said graduate student Alex Macalalad, who
spearheaded the planning. "Counseling at
Cowell was inadequate [because] it was unable
to reach out to all students that needed to get
tested."
Manv students feel more comfortable talk-

ing to peers rather than a professional,
Macalalad added.
Pretest counseling serves primarily as an
information session. Assessing the student's
level of risk is also a major concern, Dorman
said.
Some students prove to be free from all rea
sonable risk of infection and are needlessly
worried, he said. One foreign student came in
for testing just because he lived in the Bay
Area, Dorman said.
Other times, a student may be concerned
about infection from a recent sexual
encounter. In these cases, the student is
informed that there is a 12- to 18-month
incubation period before the HIV virus can be
detected, Dorman said. Any test before this
point may not necessarily yield the proper
result, he said.
Post-test counseling primarily involves dis
cussion of the implications of both positive and
negative results. Only the doctor and the
patient are aware of the outcome. Macalalad
said the proposed student peer counselors will
not receive test results, but students could dis
close their test results to a peer counselor if
they wish.
If approved, the peer-counseling service will
not be solely limited to those seeking testing,
Macalalad said. Rather, it is part of a greater
educational effort to teach students about sex
ual issues, he said. "Sexual health is more

than absence of disease. It is taking responsi
bility for your actions and your health."
The actual test for HIV consists of two dif
ferent procedures. The first is called Enzyme
Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay. This proce
dure, repeated twice for accuracy, is an anti
gen-antibody test. If the two react and coagu
late, the test is positive.
The second procedure, the Western Blot,
tests for the presence of proteins associated
with the virus, according to Noe Arragate, an
outreach worker with the American Red Cross
in Palo Alto.
In order for a blood sample to be deemed
positive, all the tests must be positive. 1 his
helps to ensure against a false positive result,
Arragate said.
If a students does test positive, he or she is
immediately retested to ensure the accuracy of
the results, Dorman said. If the results again
are positive, the patient is given a T-cell test to
determine the stage of the infection. T-cells are
a type of lymphocyte in the blood that is
directly attacked by the virus.
The patient then learns about possible
treatment as well as various support groups in
the area.
An average of 10 students per week are
tested at Cowell, Dorman said. Only a very
small percentage actually tests positive, he
said.
