## Netters look to conquer Aztecs in NCAA opener 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The comparison to 1988 are
inevitable. Three years ago, when
the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships were contested at
UCLA, Florida entered the field as
an undefeated, overwhelming No.
1 seed.
And lost to Stanford in the
finals.
The 1991 Lady Gators are 26-
0, with one of those wins being a
6-0 thrashing of the Cardinal at
the National Team Indoors. Stan
ford is certainly not the favorite to
capture this tournament — and a
sixth consecutive national crown.
Unlike 1988, the Cardinal
enters this year's championships
completely healthy. When they
upset Florida that season, it was
without the team's No. 1 player,
Tami Whitlinger.
Florida, however, is healthy as
well and has what is, relatively
speaking, one of the best teams in
the history of the sport. That is to
say: While the individual talent on

the Lady Gators might not be the
equal of the '84 and '89 Stanford
superteams, compared to the rest
of the field Florida looks nearly
unbeatable.
For those desiring a preview,
the top-seeded Gators open this
morning at 9 a.m. against Miami,
which defeated William & Mary 6-
3 yesterday.
Stanford's first serve will be at
3 p.m. when the Cardinal tackles
San Diego State, a 5-1 winner over
Tennessee. When the teams met
here on Feb. 15, the Cardinal
emerged as an 8-1 winner. Today's
match should turn out similarly
but Stanford, which nearly lost to
Wisconsin in the opener at
Indoors, has been talking for
weeks about how they won't take
anyone lightly.
The single best thing working
in Stanford's favor — and against
all of yesterday's winners — is
that, since the tournament
expanded to 20 teams back in
1988, no first-round winner has
ever won a second-round match.
San Diego State's lineup is

headed by three ranked players:
Dorey Brandt, Eva Olivarez and
Nicole Storto. Brandt and Storto
are also ranked in doubles.
Should the Cardinal women
win, they'll meet the winner of
No. 8 Arizona versus No. 12
Brigham Young. That match is
one of the day's best chances for
an upset, although the Wildcats
are likely to prevail.
Arizona State, seeded seventh,
faces No. 9 Duke in the other
upset possible. The Blue Devils
are led by the nation's most
improved player, Julie Exum.
Texas and California square off
at noon on the West Campus
Courts, which are opened to
passers-by. At No. 1 singles, serve
and-volleyer Susan Gilchrist
meets baseline-ace Lisa Albano in
a match sure to delight spectators.
The other featured matches pit
UCIjA against Ole Miss and Geor
gia against Indiana. The Bruins
should have no trouble against
the Rebels. Even though UCLA's
top of the lineup isn't the
strongest, the Bruins depth will
do in Ole Miss.
Georgia is without No. 2 player
Caryn Moss and may face troubles
tomorrow as a result, but proba
bly not today Indiana may well be
the class of the Big 10, but the
Bulldogs are one of the few teams
that even got Florida's attention
this season. Junior Shannan
McCarthy leads Georgia in both
singles and doubles.
Stanford, for its own part, is
not yet worried about the rest of
the field. The Cardinal expects to
face Georgia in the semis and
Florida in the finals — assuming
all goes according to plan. But
UCLA presents an intriguing
matchup against the Gators and
stopped them under similar cir
cumstances in the 1989 semis.
The Cardinal has already
defeated Arizona and Georgia
twice this season and is hoping to
become the first host school to
win NCAAs. Florida's thrashing
of Stanford may have deceived
some into thinking the Cardinal
isn't that good, to be sure. But the
Gators don't possess an overwh
leming advantage at any spot in
the lineup.
In other words, the champi
onship match could be quite a
barn burner.
Stanford placed four players in
the individual singles competi
tion: 1990 champ Debbie Graham,
'89 titlist Sandra Birch, Teri
Whitlinger and Heather Willens.
In doubles, Birch and Graham,
two-time NCAA finalist, will bid
for the title as will Whitlinger and
Laxmi Poruri.
