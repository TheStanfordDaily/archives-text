The dress rehearsal went off
pretty much without a hitch. If
the weather cooperates, today's
grand opening should be a smash
hit.
Eight teams competed in first
round action at the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships
yesterday with winners Miami,
Ole Miss, Indiana and San Diego
State advancing to today's round
of 16.
William & Mary tested the
Hurricanes in the opening match
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium
by taking three of the six singles
matches, including Nos. 1 and 2.
The Tribe's Kristine Kurth
bested Melissa Mazzotta in three
sets 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 and Karen Gal
lego beat Mariette Verbruggen 2-

6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0. But Miami swept
the doubles to advance with a 6-3
win. They face No. 1 Florida
today.
The West Campus Courts saw
their first collegiate competition
ever when Ole Miss met San
Diego. The Rebels, in the NCAAs
for the first time, made short
work of San Diego, 5-1.
Unranked Alison Hill crushed
San Diego's Tuck Kacharoen,
ranked 36th, 6-0, 6-1 at No. 2 sin
gles. Lady Rebel star Paloma Col
lantes bested Tonya Fuller 7-5, 6-
3 at No. 1. Ole Miss finds the road
a bit tougher today as they meet
fourth-seeded UCLA.
By afternoon the mediocre
weather had turned worse and the
underdogs seemed to benefit from
the conditions. San Diego State,
seeded 18th, defeated No. 14 seed
Tennessee 5-1. Things were much

closer than they seemed as three
matches, including the clincher,
went to third-set tiebreakers.
No. 18 Indiana won a thriller
over 13th-seeded LSU to close out
the day. The Hoosiers trailed 3-1
before coming back to tie things at
3-3 after singles. Indiana's one
two punch of Stephanie Reece and
Deborah Edelman proved critical.
Reece knocked of Laura Randmaa
7-5, 6-4 while Edelmen beat Clau
dia Herrera 7-5, 6-3.
In doubles, Reece and Edelman
bested Randmaa and Nelly Pardo
to move Indiana up 4-3. Brenda
Hacker and Danielle Paradine
picked up the clincher at No. 2 by
beating Particia Minnis and Sarah
Stewart. Indiana's third doubles
was trailing at the time, 5-3 in the
third. That match was stopped
immediately.
