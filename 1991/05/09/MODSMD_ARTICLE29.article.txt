# Roger Burnett takes 'em as they come
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Roger Burnett is anxious.
Standing deep in the stretch of
dirt that separates second base
from third, he waits. The arm of
the pitcher recoils and the ball is
released to a waiting bat that
directs the hard sphere to the man
who is more than happy to receive
it.
Using the eyes that have made
him into one of the premiere
shortstops in the country, Burnett
judges the hop, catches the ball,
and throws the runner out in a
fluid motion that he has per
formed hundreds of times before.
He does not smile, but he is happy.
This is what Roger Burnett likes.
"There are two things that
make a good infielder," said the
man from Broken Arrow, Okla.
"Number one is that you have to
expect the ball to come to you, and
number two is that you have to
want it to come to you. I really
want it to come."
Burnett would not mind if it
came to him every time. In fact it
brings a smile to his face when
you mention an inning in which
the ball only comes to him.
"Three putouts in a row is the
ultimate," said Burnett. "It helps
make the game fun."
Roger Burnett has been hav
ing a lot of fun over the last three
years. Shortstops see a lot of balls
bounce their way over a season,
and Burnett has made the most of
his opportunities. With a career
fielding percentage of .955, Bur
nett has impressed both his team
and pro scouts with the way he
handles himself in the field.
Both parties appreciate his tal
ent, but the team needs his leader
ship as well. They call the short
stop the coach of the infield, and
Burnett does the job best with his
glove.
"He really leads by his play,"
said coach Mark Marquess. "He is
very steady and very consistent.
He has been consistent from day
one."
This kind of consistency makes
a ball that heads for short not so

much a threat as just an out. Bur
nett has 11 errors in 149 attempts
this year, but they are enough of
the exception to the rule that they
are the subject of a little infield
joke with second baseman Chris
Kemper.
Burnett and Kemper are out to
see who has the better glove, and
they do this by having an error
count. Kemper is winning with
eight, but he places much faith in
his opponent.
"I have a lot of confidence (in
Roger]," Kemper said. "He is one
of those people who will make the
fundamental play all the time, and
because of his strong arm can
make the occasional great play."
According to Marquess it is this
ability to make the great play that
actually can make Burnett more
susceptible to making errors. Bur
nett's extension is such that he
can get to some balls that others
would let by for a hit. This kind of
skill is something that helps make

Burnett a good bet to be a high
draft pick when the big leagues
look for new blood in June, but
does not especially please the man
who makes the plays.
"I'd really like to play in the
m*yor leagues, but it will take a lot
of work," Burnett said. "In the
field I need to improve my range
and my speed. I have stretches
were I have really great range,
and others where I don't."
Such a stretch occurred a few
weeks ago. Burnett had about five
games in which he allowed Kem
per to pull ahead in the count and
had media folks wondering if
there was anything the matter.
The errors stopped coming as
soon as Burnett remembered he
was not scared of the ball.
"I made some errors that I did
not understand, and then I got
timid," Burnett said. "When you
are timid in the infield you are
done, so I started coming in on the
ball and being more aggressive."

"He is very determined," said
teammate and roommate Tony
Detter. "He's focused on what he
needs to get done."
That focus has a tendency to
confuse people. Burnett is not
known for his rah-rah antics,
instead preferring to keep things
at an even keel. This lack of emo
tion has a way of making the
junior hard to figure out, but he is

pros after this season.
not worried about such matters.
Roger Burnett has other things on
his mind.
"I"m definitely focused. I have
to be," said Burnett. "I set goals
for myself and the team, and if
you don't stay focused you won't
attain goals."
The obvious team goal is a
return to the NCAAs as a No. 1
seed in some regional, and hope
fully another chance to go to
Omaha, Neb. and win the College
World Series. The personal goal is
a little more simple. When Mar
quess handed out cards at the
beginning of the year that asked
for individual goals, Burnett
thought about different numbers,
but decided instead he wanted to
have fun.
"If you are having fun," said
Burnett, "the rest will follow."
Roger seems to be enjoying
himself. The defensive productiv
ity is obvious and well docu
mented, but Burnett is doing
pretty well at the plate as well.

Going into today's contest with
the California Golden Bears, Bur
nett is hitting .313 with 40 RBI.
Last weekend against UCLA, Bur
nett went 5-for-13 with two home
runs in Saturday's 12-11 come
back victory.
Burnett has nine homers this
season and 23 for his career, more
than any other shortstop in Stan
ford baseball history. In addition,
he has reached base in 47 of Stan
ford's 51 games and has been hit
less in consecutive games only
once this season. Nice numbers,
but like his fielding, Burnett is not
satisfied.
"Offensively I've had n
mediocre year," said Burnett. "It's
hard to keep my level of offensive
play where I would like it to be.
My self expectations are pretty
hi g h "
Maybe Roger Burnett will
never be satisfied, but he will be
happy as long as he is playing the
game. Next year could bring the
pros or it could bring another year
at Stanford; it does not matter.
The future holds lots of baseballs
for Roger Burnett, and he will just
keep waiting for them, waiting for
the fun they bring.

Going into today's contest with
the California Golden Bears, Bur
nett is hitting .313 with 40 RBI.
Last weekend against UCLA, Bur
nett went 5-for-13 with two home
runs in Saturday's 12-11 come
back victory.
Burnett has nine homers this
season and 23 for his career, more
than any other shortstop in Stan
ford baseball history. In addition,
he has reached base in 47 of Stan
ford's 51 games and has been hit
less in consecutive games only
once this season. Nice numbers,
but like his fielding, Burnett is not
satisfied.
"Offensively I've had n
mediocre year," said Burnett. "It's
hard to keep my level of offensive
play where I would like it to be.
My self expectations are pretty
hi g h "
Maybe Roger Burnett will
never be satisfied, but he will be
happy as long as he is playing the
game. Next year could bring the
pros or it could bring another year
at Stanford; it does not matter.
The future holds lots of baseballs
for Roger Burnett, and he will just
keep waiting for them, waiting for
the fun they bring.
Roger Burnett is anxious.
Standing deep in the stretch of
dirt that separates second base
from third, he waits. The arm of
the pitcher recoils and the ball is
released to a waiting bat that
directs the hard sphere to the man
who is more than happy to receive
it.
Using the eyes that have made
him into one of the premiere
shortstops in the country, Burnett
judges the hop, catches the ball,
and throws the runner out in a
fluid motion that he has per
formed hundreds of times before.
He does not smile, but he is happy.
This is what Roger Burnett likes.
"There are two things that
make a good infielder," said the
man from Broken Arrow, Okla.
"Number one is that you have to
expect the ball to come to you, and
number two is that you have to
want it to come to you. I really
want it to come."
Burnett would not mind if it
came to him every time. In fact it
brings a smile to his face when
you mention an inning in which
the ball only comes to him.
"Three putouts in a row is the
ultimate," said Burnett. "It helps
make the game fun."
Roger Burnett has been hav
ing a lot of fun over the last three
years. Shortstops see a lot of balls
bounce their way over a season,
and Burnett has made the most of
his opportunities. With a career
fielding percentage of .955, Bur
nett has impressed both his team
and pro scouts with the way he
handles himself in the field.
Both parties appreciate his tal
ent, but the team needs his leader
ship as well. They call the short
stop the coach of the infield, and
Burnett does the job best with his
glove.
"He really leads by his play,"
said coach Mark Marquess. "He is
very steady and very consistent.
He has been consistent from day
one."
This kind of consistency makes
a ball that heads for short not so

much a threat as just an out. Bur
nett has 11 errors in 149 attempts
this year, but they are enough of
the exception to the rule that they
are the subject of a little infield
joke with second baseman Chris
Kemper.
Burnett and Kemper are out to
see who has the better glove, and
they do this by having an error
count. Kemper is winning with
eight, but he places much faith in
his opponent.
"I have a lot of confidence (in
Roger]," Kemper said. "He is one
of those people who will make the
fundamental play all the time, and
because of his strong arm can
make the occasional great play."
According to Marquess it is this
ability to make the great play that
actually can make Burnett more
susceptible to making errors. Bur
nett's extension is such that he
can get to some balls that others
would let by for a hit. This kind of
skill is something that helps make

Burnett a good bet to be a high
draft pick when the big leagues
look for new blood in June, but
does not especially please the man
who makes the plays.
"I'd really like to play in the
m*yor leagues, but it will take a lot
of work," Burnett said. "In the
field I need to improve my range
and my speed. I have stretches
were I have really great range,
and others where I don't."
Such a stretch occurred a few
weeks ago. Burnett had about five
games in which he allowed Kem
per to pull ahead in the count and
had media folks wondering if
there was anything the matter.
The errors stopped coming as
soon as Burnett remembered he
was not scared of the ball.
"I made some errors that I did
not understand, and then I got
timid," Burnett said. "When you
are timid in the infield you are
done, so I started coming in on the
ball and being more aggressive."

"He is very determined," said
teammate and roommate Tony
Detter. "He's focused on what he
needs to get done."
That focus has a tendency to
confuse people. Burnett is not
known for his rah-rah antics,
instead preferring to keep things
at an even keel. This lack of emo
tion has a way of making the
junior hard to figure out, but he is

not worried about such matters.
Roger Burnett has other things on
his mind.
"I"m definitely focused. I have
to be," said Burnett. "I set goals
for myself and the team, and if
you don't stay focused you won't
attain goals."
The obvious team goal is a
return to the NCAAs as a No. 1
seed in some regional, and hope
fully another chance to go to
Omaha, Neb. and win the College
World Series. The personal goal is
a little more simple. When Mar
quess handed out cards at the
beginning of the year that asked
for individual goals, Burnett
thought about different numbers,
but decided instead he wanted to
have fun.
"If you are having fun," said
Burnett, "the rest will follow."
Roger seems to be enjoying
himself. The defensive productiv
ity is obvious and well docu
mented, but Burnett is doing
pretty well at the plate as well.
