# Alpha Sig no longer suspended
## 
### Cecilia Tom Editorial staff 
The University lifted the social
suspension on the Alpha Sigma
house yesterday afternoon after
administrators determined that
the house was not at fault in four
arrests made April 20 during and
after its Exotic Erotic party
After the suspension took
effect April 23, Alpha Sig submit
ted a report to the University
explaining the circumstances
behind the arrests. Acting Row
Director Jack Chin, who was in
charge of investigating the
incidents, said the University has
been able to confirm the report's
statements that the people
arrested did not get intoxicated at
the party.
Of the four arrested, three
were Stanford students and one
was a prospective freshman. They
were arrested separately on
charges ranging from burglary
and resisting arrest to public
intoxication.
Diana Conklin, acting associate
dean of student affairs, said no

penalty will be levied on the
house. The three arrested stu
dents are being investigated by
their respective resident deans for
violation of the University's alco
hol policy.
None of the students live in
Alpha Sig.
According to the 14-page Alpha
Sig report, one of the arrested stu
dents, a Burbank resident, admit
ted to Alpha Sig residents he
"drank a great deal of hard alcohol
at his dorm before coming to Alpha
Sig." The report concludes that the
student's "serious physical condi
tion and his subsequent hospital
ization was not attributable to
Alpha Sig."
A freshman from Donner who
was arrested also admitted he had
drunk at his own dorm and said
he drank nothing while at Alpha
Sig, the report says.
The student charged with bur
glary, Jon-Paul Villegas, was
arrested early Sunday morning
after allegedly breaking into
Meyer Library. Because he was
not cited for any alcohol-related
offense, and because he was

arrested more than two hours
after he left the party, which
ended at 2:30 a.m., the connection
between the incident and the
Exotic Erotic party was "dubi
ous," the report states.
Finally, the prospective fresh
men, who was staying in Donner,
"apparently drank at Donner and
definitely drank quite a bit" at a
Rush party in the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house before heading off
for Alpha Sig, according to the
report. In addition, "no one . . .
knows if 1 he] ever even made it to
Alpha Sig," the report continues.
Conklin praised Alpha Sig for
doing "a really extraordinary job"
in its internal investigation and
said "it was a pleasure" working
with the students.
However, Alpha Sig's resident
assistant Ted Hoagland said it is
"regrettable" that the University
put the house on suspension "on
the first rumor" before conduct
ing a thorough investigation. "1
don't really agree with the Uni
versity procedure . . . but I guess
that's normal."
