# Stop the shutout

The situation is right out
of a John Cusack movie:
"I tell ya, Lance, we're in
a slump. It's my senior year,
and look at us.
"Remember freshman year
— three times. Sophomore
year was excellent — three
times again, once in the water.
Junior year, three more times,
including once on national tele
vision. This year, an NIT title,
otherwise. ..."
It's nice to be a senior dur
ing the Centennial Celebration,
and a member of Stanford's
100 th graduating class. But
when we look back on our
Stanford experience years from
now, I hope we won't be
haunted by the unthinkable:
our class didn't capture a single
NCAA title.
I know, I know, it's horrible
— worse than the fact that not
one of us will be able to find a
job once we graduate in this,
the most depressed employ
ment market in 30 years. How
can we live it down?
Because everyone knows
that NCAA championships at
Stanford are a Sure Thing. We
own 43 of the suckers, which
compared to the rest the nation
is ... a lot. Only those jock fac
tories in La La Land have
more.
Face it, we're spoiled. The
last time Stanford didn't win a
single NCAA title? Try 1975-
76, when we were all in first
grade. But who can blame us
for wanting, expecting the
best?
The same spring all of us in
the Class of '91 received those
coveted letters from Dean
Jean, the Cardinal already had
two first-place trophies under
its belt, and would add two
more by year's end.
The achievement marked
the second straight time that
Stanford had won four team
titles in one academic year, and
in the process topped every

other collegiate athletic pro
gram in the nation. We even
broke with our country club
image by winning a baseball
championship.
Say Anything you wanted to
about us socially, we still kicked
sand in the rest of the coun
try's face athletically. These
were also the glory years aca
demically, what with the top
billing in U.S. News and World
Report. The government gave
us overhead money with a
smile, then.
The good times continued
our freshman year, as
baseball improbably won
another title and the tennis
teams each won. Stanford ten
nis and national titles would
become synonymous by the end
of the the 1980s, as Stanford
became the decade s Champion
of Champions with 24 overall
team crowns, half in tennis.
But there were some insidi
ous trends as well. Water polo
and men's swimming, both
two-time defending champi
ons, failed to win it all in 1987-
88. Now, in our senior year,
both teams are consistently at
the top of the rankings but still
have yet to win another title.
Sophomore year had its dark
side, too. The powerful
women's volleyball team, after
reaching the title game the
year before, was upset early
and finished ninth. On the flip
side, the surprising men's vol
levball team streaked all the
