# Stop the shutout
## 
### 
The situation is right out
of a John Cusack movie:
"I tell ya, Lance, we're in
a slump. It's my senior year,
and look at us.
"Remember freshman year
— three times. Sophomore
year was excellent — three
times again, once in the water.
Junior year, three more times,
including once on national tele
vision. This year, an NIT title,
otherwise. ..."
It's nice to be a senior dur
ing the Centennial Celebration,
and a member of Stanford's
100 th graduating class. But
when we look back on our
Stanford experience years from
now, I hope we won't be
haunted by the unthinkable:
our class didn't capture a single
NCAA title.
I know, I know, it's horrible
— worse than the fact that not
one of us will be able to find a
job once we graduate in this,
the most depressed employ
ment market in 30 years. How
can we live it down?
Because everyone knows
that NCAA championships at
Stanford are a Sure Thing. We
own 43 of the suckers, which
compared to the rest the nation
is ... a lot. Only those jock fac
tories in La La Land have
more.
Face it, we're spoiled. The
last time Stanford didn't win a
single NCAA title? Try 1975-
76, when we were all in first
grade. But who can blame us
for wanting, expecting the
best?
The same spring all of us in
the Class of '91 received those
coveted letters from Dean
Jean, the Cardinal already had
two first-place trophies under
its belt, and would add two
more by year's end.
The achievement marked
the second straight time that
Stanford had won four team
titles in one academic year, and
in the process topped every

other collegiate athletic pro
gram in the nation. We even
broke with our country club
image by winning a baseball
championship.
Say Anything you wanted to
about us socially, we still kicked
sand in the rest of the coun
try's face athletically. These
were also the glory years aca
demically, what with the top
billing in U.S. News and World
Report. The government gave
us overhead money with a
smile, then.
The good times continued
our freshman year, as
baseball improbably won
another title and the tennis
teams each won. Stanford ten
nis and national titles would
become synonymous by the end
of the the 1980s, as Stanford
became the decade s Champion
of Champions with 24 overall
team crowns, half in tennis.
But there were some insidi
ous trends as well. Water polo
and men's swimming, both
two-time defending champi
ons, failed to win it all in 1987-
88. Now, in our senior year,
both teams are consistently at
the top of the rankings but still
have yet to win another title.
Sophomore year had its dark
side, too. The powerful
women's volleyball team, after
reaching the title game the
year before, was upset early
and finished ninth. On the flip
side, the surprising men's vol
levball team streaked all the


David
Hirning
way to the NCAA finals before
falling to arch-nemesis UCLA.
These programs have since
experienced frustrating times.
The women finished ninth again
the following year, and were
crushed this year in the regional
finals by the Bruins. The men
haven't been the same since Scott
Fortune graduated.
Women's swimming was riding
high in 1989-90, and broke
through with its second NCAA
title. With the world's top swim
mer, Janet Evans, committing to
come to Stanford the following
year and coach Richard Quick on
his sixth straight title (five with
Texas), the rest of the country's
programs figured to be Better Off
Dead.
But something hasn't quite
clicked. Despite loads of Cardinal
talent, those pesky Longhorns,
Quick or no Quick, have got the
better of Stanford the past two
years.
Last year, the Cardinal lost by a

miniscule 9.5 points even though
Evans and Janel Jorgensen tied as
the meet's top point scorers. This
year, it was a distant second for
Stanford. To add to the indignity,
Texas has been doing the same to
the Cardinal men's program,
which finished second to the
'Horns earlier this spring.
Baseball faltered under the
pressure of trying to threepeat
two years ago, and didn't even get
invited to the tournament. Last
year, the 59-12 Cardinal machine
was awesome, but somehow
didn't win the title (finishing
third to Georgia).
Inconsistency and injuries
make it unlikely that the 34-17
baseball squad can win it all in
Omaha this year. Definitely possi
ble (you can't count Mark Mar
quess out should he get to the
World Series), but not something
to bet the Farm on.
Women's basketball has qui
etly, almost impossibly, become a
Cardinal powerhouse athletic pro
gram, and kicked off the 1990s for
Stanford with a dramatic, nation
ally televised NCAA Champi
onship victory.

But, as any sports fan will tell
you, NCAA basketball tourna
ments are highly unpredictable.
This year, the Cardinal probably
shouldn't have even made the
Final Four after an injury to cen
ter Trisha Stevens, did anyway,
and then suffered another injury
loss and bowed to eventual cham
pion Tennessee.
Which brings us, suddenly,
to the present quandary:
Where will the title(s?)
come from this year? Where else,
but tennis?
Every year for the last three,
Stanford has won both the men's
and women's tennis champi
onships. It's like death and taxes.
Or is it?
This year, I'm worried. Just
look at how the year has gone so
far. Then look at the men netters:
19-4, 17-3 in conference. A three
match losing streak. Coach Dick
Gould has definitely won it under
similar conditions, but is a fourth
straight title asking too much?
Then there are Frank Bren
nan's troops, which kick off play
today in the NCAA tournament

which Stanford is hosting. What
more can this team, which has
won a John Woodenish five
straight national titles, accom
plish?
Two things. 1) Break the
Home Court Jinx. Now in its
10th year, no host team has ever
managed to win the women's
NCAA tennis title. Can the Cardi
nal flex its powerful forearms and
demolish the curse?
2) Save the Class of '91.
Please. But they might need some
help. So all of you seniors, come
out of the Career Planning and
Placement Center for a few hours
this weekend. You aren't going to
find work anyway.
Instead, get down to the Tennis
Stadium today at 3 p.m., or
tomorrow, and definitely Satur
day and Sunday. Cheer the Cardi
nal on. Get a tan.
Remember, our senior class
pride is at stake.

David Hirning hasn't seen "The
Grifters" yet, but sports editor
Mark Rogowsky thinks it was one
of the worst movies of all time.
