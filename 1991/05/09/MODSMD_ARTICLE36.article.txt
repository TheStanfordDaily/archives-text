# INTERMISSION
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S FREE LOVE WEEKLY On studying overCs 
### 
Editor's Note: The beloved Chris Harris
has honored us with an absentee col
umn, which we have most dutifully
decided to print immediately.
Well, I made it to Berlin, and
am now in the middle of
what has to be the easiest
academic quarter of college — no
wonder they call this "over Cs" stud
ies.
Not that it was easy getting here.
First, I had to decide where to apply.
I thought about beautiful Krakow,
the only city in the world where one
steps inside for a breath of fresh air
and people use cigarettes for air fresh
eners. When residents see the term
"Polish landscape," they're not sure if
it's a description or a command.
The pollution is so bad ("How bad
is it?"), it extends into politics. And
I'm not just talking about those dirty
Communists — even the opposition
force is named Solid-air-ity.

Now there's a real pollutical party.
I could have gone to Kyoto, but
they say it's exactly like Tokyo,
depending on just where you move to.
(Yes, there is a joke in there. Look for
it.) Anyway, I saw "The Bad News
Bears in Japan" and"The Karate Kid
II," and frankly, I wasn't impressed
Naturally, Hopkins Marine Station
was out — it's more underseas than
overseas. Or ROTCs, if you mistake the
name.
And the situation in Russia was, I
decided, too unstable to study in. One
must, however, praise the government
for having taken such a relatively pas
sive role as the world changed around
them — looks like they're finally living
up to the name "So be it" Union.
Florence? To some, the name
brings to mind beautiful architecture,
romantic evenings and pasta, pasta,
pasta. All I can think of is Florence
Henderson. I get nightmares of a city
filled with thousands of Bobbys, Jans
and Sam-thebutchers running loose
around a river of Wesson Oil looking
for Tiger. This is not what I call groovy.
And Oxford could wait until after
the Rhodes Scholarship.
Which left me with Paris, Tours
and Berlin. Rather than typing up a
unique application for each program, I
quickly resurrected the standard
"form-essay" style from my college
application days:
"Ever since I was little, I've simply
dreamed of going to . ,
widely regarded as the cultural center
of Europe, is vital to my European
studies at Stanford. Furthermore,
when I was 8, I visited , and
there I lost my faithful dog Norman,
never to hear of him to this day. This
will be my on!y chance to ever return
to and find him. So please
pleasepleasepleaseplease accept me."
Look familiar? I've never put the
"Find ... /Change ..option to bet
ter use.
On two applications, I left room for
witty conclusions: "The thought of not
getting in would bring Tours to my
eyes" and, of course, "Thank God for
Paris!"
I was accepted to Berlin.
I had fears about going. Not about
its historical value, of course. I mean,
how many other cities were important
enough to make it into Billy Joel's "We
Didn't Start the Fire"?
I worried. You can tell a lot about a
country's culture by the names of their
cities and what products they bring to
mind. Chilly England has Oxford
sweaters and Cambridge wool. Pas
sionate France has Parisien silk and
eau de Cologne. Emotional Italy has
Florentine scarves and Roman can
dles. So what does Germany have?
Hamburg and Frankfurt.
Regardless, I figured it was time to
start learning the language. Before last
fall, my entire knowledge of German


Danken Gott
fiir Harris!
