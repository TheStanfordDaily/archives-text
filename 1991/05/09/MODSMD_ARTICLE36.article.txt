# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S FREE LOVE WEEKLY On studying overCs 
### 
Editor's Note: The beloved Chris Harris
has honored us with an absentee col
umn, which we have most dutifully
decided to print immediately.
Well, I made it to Berlin, and
am now in the middle of
what has to be the easiest
academic quarter of college — no
wonder they call this "over Cs" stud
ies.
Not that it was easy getting here.
First, I had to decide where to apply.
I thought about beautiful Krakow,
the only city in the world where one
steps inside for a breath of fresh air
and people use cigarettes for air fresh
eners. When residents see the term
"Polish landscape," they're not sure if
it's a description or a command.
The pollution is so bad ("How bad
is it?"), it extends into politics. And
I'm not just talking about those dirty
Communists — even the opposition
force is named Solid-air-ity.

Now there's a real pollutical party.
I could have gone to Kyoto, but
they say it's exactly like Tokyo,
depending on just where you move to.
(Yes, there is a joke in there. Look for
it.) Anyway, I saw "The Bad News
Bears in Japan" and"The Karate Kid
II," and frankly, I wasn't impressed
Naturally, Hopkins Marine Station
was out — it's more underseas than
overseas. Or ROTCs, if you mistake the
name.
And the situation in Russia was, I
decided, too unstable to study in. One
must, however, praise the government
for having taken such a relatively pas
sive role as the world changed around
them — looks like they're finally living
up to the name "So be it" Union.
Florence? To some, the name
brings to mind beautiful architecture,
romantic evenings and pasta, pasta,
pasta. All I can think of is Florence
Henderson. I get nightmares of a city
filled with thousands of Bobbys, Jans
and Sam-thebutchers running loose
around a river of Wesson Oil looking
for Tiger. This is not what I call groovy.
And Oxford could wait until after
the Rhodes Scholarship.
Which left me with Paris, Tours
and Berlin. Rather than typing up a
unique application for each program, I
quickly resurrected the standard
"form-essay" style from my college
application days:
"Ever since I was little, I've simply
dreamed of going to . ,
widely regarded as the cultural center
of Europe, is vital to my European
studies at Stanford. Furthermore,
when I was 8, I visited , and
there I lost my faithful dog Norman,
never to hear of him to this day. This
will be my on!y chance to ever return
to and find him. So please
pleasepleasepleaseplease accept me."
Look familiar? I've never put the
"Find ... /Change ..option to bet
ter use.
On two applications, I left room for
witty conclusions: "The thought of not
getting in would bring Tours to my
eyes" and, of course, "Thank God for
Paris!"
I was accepted to Berlin.
I had fears about going. Not about
its historical value, of course. I mean,
how many other cities were important
enough to make it into Billy Joel's "We
Didn't Start the Fire"?
I worried. You can tell a lot about a
country's culture by the names of their
cities and what products they bring to
mind. Chilly England has Oxford
sweaters and Cambridge wool. Pas
sionate France has Parisien silk and
eau de Cologne. Emotional Italy has
Florentine scarves and Roman can
dles. So what does Germany have?
Hamburg and Frankfurt.
Regardless, I figured it was time to
start learning the language. Before last
fall, my entire knowledge of German


Danken Gott
fiir Harris!
could be summed up in two words:
kindergarten and Burgermeister. Con
cerned friends tried to comfort me in
my ignorance, assuring me that the
rest of language was pretty much "just
English with a slur." But I wasn't satis
fied with what I knew. More impor
tantly, neither was the Overseas Office.
I wanted to speak German, breathe
German, eat German ... that is, until I
took a look at German food. I wanted
to hear the romantic poetry of "der"
and "ich" rolling melodiously off my
tongue. I wanted to know what this
funky little "6" means, and if they
really dot their U's just to make little
smiley faces everywhere: 0.
I wanted to know German like Bo
knows... the sidelines. So I did every
thing I could to learn German. I
dusted off my trusty Apple 11+ and
started replaying "Castle Wolfenstein."
I taped every single "Hogan's
Heroes" episode, and made sure to
catch all the Volkswagen commercials
in between (Worthless joke that I
couldn't fit in anywhere else: "Whad
dya get when you cross a Volkswagen
with a distant junk food? Farfignew
ton!").
Most importantly, I took German I,
and found myself and 20 others sitting
in a classroom, watching some strange
man in black discussing personal pro
nouns with a sock puppet named
Hugo.
The first few weeks were rocky. The
first test contained a question which
asked, "Are you both from California?"
I naturally replied, "No, I am happy
from California." And got partial
credit.
But soon I had learned the key sur
vival phrases for American travelers:
"Sprechen Sie Englisch?" "Auf
Englisch, bitte" and, of course, "Wo ist
McDonald's?"
I'd also learned that the Comman
der-in-Chief of our American forces in
Iraq is really named General Black
head. I was ready for the big time.
Alas, my first experience with Ger
man was not perfect. Waiting for my
train to Berlin, some weirdo guy in
black came up to me, pointed at my
generic European backpacker's bottle
of Evian, said something like,
"Schochen schafen lafen lafen gedoi
biedoibieboibieand stood there, eyes
wide, arms open and moving in some
mutated Steve Martin impression, just
waiting for me to bust out laughing at
his obviously hilarious comment.
I tried mime, charades,
bird calls, third-base
signals, semaphore,
metaphor, final four
and every single Ger
man phrase that I
could remember, but
the only response I ever
got was when he point
ed me two blocks down
the street to the nearest
McDonald's.
I sort of sat there and smiled weakly
for a minute, wondering if I should
actually try to ask him — in German
— to repeat himself. Go for it, I finally
decided. Eye of the tiger. Wo English.
So for half an hour I tried in vain to
make him understand my request,
sputtering, stuttering, slurring, shout
ing, stomping, waving my arms in
strange directions, patting my head
and rubbing my stomach. I tried
mime, charades, bird calls, third-base
signals, semaphore, metaphor, final
four and every single German phrase
that I could remember, but the only
response I ever got was when he
pointed me two blocks down the street
to the nearest McDonald's.
Since then, I've gotten better. But
ask me to describe something in Ger
man, and I can still only tell you
whether it's "good," "bad" or on
adventurous days, "nice." I'm starting
to sound like some dubbed Disney
version of a Clint Eastwood flick.
Given time, however, I know my
language skills will grow. After all, I
am in the German-nation stage of my
life.

(Yes, there is a joke in there. Look for
it.) Anyway, I saw "The Bad News
Bears in Japan" and"The Karate Kid
II," and frankly, I wasn't impressed
Naturally, Hopkins Marine Station
was out — it's more underseas than
overseas. Or ROTCs, if you mistake the
name.
And the situation in Russia was, I
decided, too unstable to study in. One
must, however, praise the government
for having taken such a relatively pas
sive role as the world changed around
them — looks like they're finally living
up to the name "So be it" Union.
Florence? To some, the name
brings to mind beautiful architecture,
romantic evenings and pasta, pasta,
pasta. All I can think of is Florence
Henderson. I get nightmares of a city
filled with thousands of Bobbys, Jans
and Sam-thebutchers running loose
around a river of Wesson Oil looking
for Tiger. This is not what I call groovy.
And Oxford could wait until after
the Rhodes Scholarship.
Which left me with Paris, Tours
and Berlin. Rather than typing up a
unique application for each program, I
quickly resurrected the standard
"form-essay" style from my college
application days:
"Ever since I was little, I've simply
dreamed of going to . ,
widely regarded as the cultural center
of Europe, is vital to my European
studies at Stanford. Furthermore,
when I was 8, I visited , and
there I lost my faithful dog Norman,
never to hear of him to this day. This
will be my on!y chance to ever return
to and find him. So please
pleasepleasepleaseplease accept me."
Look familiar? I've never put the
"Find ... /Change ..option to bet
ter use.
On two applications, I left room for
witty conclusions: "The thought of not
getting in would bring Tours to my
eyes" and, of course, "Thank God for
Paris!"
I was accepted to Berlin.
I had fears about going. Not about
its historical value, of course. I mean,
how many other cities were important
enough to make it into Billy Joel's "We
Didn't Start the Fire"?
I worried. You can tell a lot about a
country's culture by the names of their
cities and what products they bring to
mind. Chilly England has Oxford
sweaters and Cambridge wool. Pas
sionate France has Parisien silk and
eau de Cologne. Emotional Italy has
Florentine scarves and Roman can
dles. So what does Germany have?
Hamburg and Frankfurt.
Regardless, I figured it was time to
start learning the language. Before last
fall, my entire knowledge of German


Danken Gott
fiir Harris!
could be summed up in two words:
kindergarten and Burgermeister. Con
cerned friends tried to comfort me in
my ignorance, assuring me that the
rest of language was pretty much "just
English with a slur." But I wasn't satis
fied with what I knew. More impor
tantly, neither was the Overseas Office.
I wanted to speak German, breathe
German, eat German ... that is, until I
took a look at German food. I wanted
to hear the romantic poetry of "der"
and "ich" rolling melodiously off my
tongue. I wanted to know what this
funky little "6" means, and if they
really dot their U's just to make little
smiley faces everywhere: 0.
I wanted to know German like Bo
knows... the sidelines. So I did every
thing I could to learn German. I
dusted off my trusty Apple 11+ and
started replaying "Castle Wolfenstein."
I taped every single "Hogan's
Heroes" episode, and made sure to
catch all the Volkswagen commercials
in between (Worthless joke that I
couldn't fit in anywhere else: "Whad
dya get when you cross a Volkswagen
with a distant junk food? Farfignew
ton!").
Most importantly, I took German I,
and found myself and 20 others sitting
in a classroom, watching some strange
man in black discussing personal pro
nouns with a sock puppet named
Hugo.
The first few weeks were rocky. The
first test contained a question which
asked, "Are you both from California?"
I naturally replied, "No, I am happy
from California." And got partial
credit.
But soon I had learned the key sur
vival phrases for American travelers:
"Sprechen Sie Englisch?" "Auf
Englisch, bitte" and, of course, "Wo ist
McDonald's?"
I'd also learned that the Comman
der-in-Chief of our American forces in
Iraq is really named General Black
head. I was ready for the big time.
Alas, my first experience with Ger
man was not perfect. Waiting for my
train to Berlin, some weirdo guy in
black came up to me, pointed at my
generic European backpacker's bottle
of Evian, said something like,
"Schochen schafen lafen lafen gedoi
biedoibieboibieand stood there, eyes
wide, arms open and moving in some
mutated Steve Martin impression, just
waiting for me to bust out laughing at
his obviously hilarious comment.
I tried mime, charades,
bird calls, third-base
signals, semaphore,
metaphor, final four
and every single Ger
man phrase that I
could remember, but
the only response I ever
got was when he point
ed me two blocks down
the street to the nearest
McDonald's.
I sort of sat there and smiled weakly
for a minute, wondering if I should
actually try to ask him — in German
— to repeat himself. Go for it, I finally
decided. Eye of the tiger. Wo English.
So for half an hour I tried in vain to
make him understand my request,
sputtering, stuttering, slurring, shout
ing, stomping, waving my arms in
strange directions, patting my head
and rubbing my stomach. I tried
mime, charades, bird calls, third-base
signals, semaphore, metaphor, final
four and every single German phrase
that I could remember, but the only
response I ever got was when he
pointed me two blocks down the street
to the nearest McDonald's.
Since then, I've gotten better. But
ask me to describe something in Ger
man, and I can still only tell you
whether it's "good," "bad" or on
adventurous days, "nice." I'm starting
to sound like some dubbed Disney
version of a Clint Eastwood flick.
Given time, however, I know my
language skills will grow. After all, I
am in the German-nation stage of my
life.

Well, I made it to Berlin, and
am now in the middle of
what has to be the easiest
academic quarter of college — no
wonder they call this "over Cs" stud
ies.
Not that it was easy getting here.
First, I had to decide where to apply.
I thought about beautiful Krakow,
the only city in the world where one
steps inside for a breath of fresh air
and people use cigarettes for air fresh
eners. When residents see the term
"Polish landscape," they're not sure if
it's a description or a command.
The pollution is so bad ("How bad
is it?"), it extends into politics. And
I'm not just talking about those dirty
Communists — even the opposition
force is named Solid-air-ity.

Now there's a real pollutical party.
I could have gone to Kyoto, but
