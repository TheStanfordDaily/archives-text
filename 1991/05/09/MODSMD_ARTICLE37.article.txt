# For a dose of the sixties take a trip to the Haight

o vou want any doses?"
I Vhat was the first thing I
I Jheard upon my arrival at
M ijfr the Haight District.
Flashback to the '605... My, what a long, strange
||pL ; - trip it's been. M
As one walks through the district, at the precise
I §' corner where Ashbury Street intersects liaight Street,
is the largest Gap Store I've ever seen outyde any mail.
The Gap seems to lymbolke the blend of decades pre
sent on these streets which have been immortalized by
literature and other mediums of popular culture. >
For those that have never visited Haight-Ashbury, it is a
district full of cultural attractions and tiny shops which
run the gamut from used record shops and vintage cloth
ing stores to excellent book shops and diverse ethnic
restaurants. M \
I had never been 1 to the Haight before and I guess I
expected everyone to be we.uing tie-dyes and toking up
on the corner. I didn't expect the continuum of
lifestyles — or The Gap. Sixties flower power seems to
have been converted into '90s new age sentiments, in the
Haight.
It's a neighborhood with strong traditions, yet I got
the impression that no one remembers what the '60s
were really like.
Perhaps people have taken too many drugs to
I remember the decade, o* maybe they simply
hadn't been born yet. But in any case, the magi
j cal nature of the Haight today — the '90s rein-
Si terpretation of the '60s —la th«U it doesn't
. • matter what really happened ft* the '60s.

what the '60s were really like is as

Sami (as she asks everyone n> call her) is an "artM "

carries an exten- ■

thing from ceramic to wood burrs.
Pipe Dreams also sells bongs, oops,
I mean water pipes, and carries a sign
which states that the products it sells
are exclusively intended for tobacco
smoking. Of course they are. The shop
also displays one of the "Be kind to
Your Mind" signs.
Across the street from Pipe Dreams
is Bound Together, an anarchist col
lective bookstore. Featuring such titles
as "Dogs in Lingerie" and "Marijuana
Chemistry: Genetics, Processing and
Potency," Bound Together has a cache
of hard-to-find books as well as an
impressive selection of serials.
Try Ozone for an example of the
nouveau haute (not Haight) cuisine
generated in the area. Located at 1654
Haight St., this restaurant was once a
rundown bakery, but has been miracu
lously transformed.
Ozone offers such exotic fare as
grilled chicken livers with bread salad
and salmon with potato pancakes — a
far cry from the veggie-burger fare
offered at Dead shows.
Other dining options in the Haight
include Hell's Kitchen; a nifty
Mexican fast food place called Zona

your own interpretation and be part of
the scene for a while.
Rosa; Escape From New York Pizza,
where an East Coaster can get a thin
slice and growl at other patrons with
out feeling guilty; and a variety of
other eateries and cafes.
For visual distractions, try the store
of the same name. Distractions is
located on the middle of Haight and
has an excellent selection of tie-dyes
including shirts, pants, jackets, under
wear and very reasonably priced
tapestries. Distractions also sells tarot
cards, blacklight posters and other
odds and ends.
Everyone and all types of people are
present on the Haight. As described by
a native in San Francisco's "Global
Village Connection" magazine,
"Diversity: that's the name of the

as "Dogs in Lingerie" and "Marijuana
Chemistry: Genetics, Processing and
Potency," Bound Together has a cache
of hard-to-find books as well as an
impressive selection of serials.
Try Ozone for an example of the
nouveau haute (not Haight) cuisine
generated in the area. Located at 1654
Haight St., this restaurant was once a
rundown bakery, but has been miracu
lously transformed.
Ozone offers such exotic fare as
grilled chicken livers with bread salad
and salmon with potato pancakes — a
far cry from the veggie-burger fare
offered at Dead shows.
Other dining options in the Haight
include Hell's Kitchen; a nifty
Mexican fast food place called Zona

Rosa; Escape From New York Pizza,
where an East Coaster can get a thin
slice and growl at other patrons with
out feeling guilty; and a variety of
other eateries and cafes.
For visual distractions, try the store
of the same name. Distractions is
located on the middle of Haight and
has an excellent selection of tie-dyes
including shirts, pants, jackets, under
wear and very reasonably priced
tapestries. Distractions also sells tarot
cards, blacklight posters and other
odds and ends.
Everyone and all types of people are
present on the Haight. As described by
a native in San Francisco's "Global
Village Connection" magazine,
"Diversity: that's the name of the
Renaissance Haight Street. You name

I Vhat was the first thing I
I Jheard upon my arrival at
M ijfr the Haight District.
Flashback to the '605... My, what a long, strange
||pL ; - trip it's been. M
As one walks through the district, at the precise
I §' corner where Ashbury Street intersects liaight Street,
is the largest Gap Store I've ever seen outyde any mail.
The Gap seems to lymbolke the blend of decades pre
sent on these streets which have been immortalized by
literature and other mediums of popular culture. >
For those that have never visited Haight-Ashbury, it is a
district full of cultural attractions and tiny shops which
run the gamut from used record shops and vintage cloth
ing stores to excellent book shops and diverse ethnic
restaurants. M \
I had never been 1 to the Haight before and I guess I
expected everyone to be we.uing tie-dyes and toking up
on the corner. I didn't expect the continuum of
lifestyles — or The Gap. Sixties flower power seems to
have been converted into '90s new age sentiments, in the
Haight.
It's a neighborhood with strong traditions, yet I got
the impression that no one remembers what the '60s
were really like.
Perhaps people have taken too many drugs to
I remember the decade, o* maybe they simply
hadn't been born yet. But in any case, the magi
j cal nature of the Haight today — the '90s rein-
Si terpretation of the '60s —la th«U it doesn't

what the '60s were really like is as

Pipe Dreams also sells bongs, oops,

which states that the products it sells
are exclusively intended for tobacco
smoking. Of course they are. The shop
also displays one of the "Be kind to

Across the street from Pipe Dreams
