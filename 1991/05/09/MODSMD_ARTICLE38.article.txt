Self portrait? No. The photo above pictures part of the cast from "Real
Women Have Curves," a lively comedy featuring five full-figured
Hispanic women who work at a tiny sewing factory in East Los Ange
les. With a rapidly approaching deadline to finish 100 dresses, the women
confront love, lunch and the law in their own unique and comic way.
"Real Women" will be performed at the Mountain View Center for the
Performing Arts Main Stage tonight through Saturday.
On stage on campus, Macbeth, opened yesterday at the Little Theater
and will be presented by the Stanford Drama Department this weekend
and next weekend.
Nearby, the big-screen version of "Citizen Kane," the black-and-white
Orson Welles classic, is being shown at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto.
A bit farther away, at the M.H. deYoung Museum in the City, "Three
Women: Three Views," a film program featuring "Dear Lisa: A letter to
my sister" — a candid rumination on the fate of women's ambitions — is
being screened tonight.
Saturday is the legendary Black & White Ball, San Francisco's largest
block party which features over 35 orchestras and bands at a variety of
locations across the city. You probably can't afford it. And neither can we,
but it can be really fun to watch.
And for your campus viewing pleasure, the Dance Department's annu
al production, Spring Migration is this weekend. The program of student
and faculty-choreographed pieces opened last night and runs through Sat
urday in Roble Gym.
And, of course, what would spring quarter be without lots of ordinari
ly Gap-dad Stanford students breaking out the hippie-wear and heading to
Shoreline Amphitheater for The Grateful Dead shows? Hey, remember the
days when they played right here on campus? The times they are a-chang
ing. (Yes, we're fully aware that that's Dylan and not a Dead song. Same
era, though.)
For some folk and rock music interpreted by female voices, head to the
Coffee House on Tuesday night to catch Mixed Company members,
Jeanette Davidson and Meg Travis sing the blues, (well, not necessarily
blues, but it sounded good.)
Hope you're feelin' groovy. *
