# Candidates vie for senate chair
##

The most powerful position within the ASSU Sen
ate will be filled at the first meeting of the newly
elected senators tonight.
Four candidates are vying for senate chair â€”
juniors Solina Kwan, Jason Moore and Kevin Warsh,
and senior Keith Rabois, who will attend the Law

None of the four candidates are elected senators,
but all except Rabois have been senators in the past.

continues until a majority is reached.
The one Hammer and Coffin and two indepen

mining the outcome of the race, which many expect
will probably not be decided until the final ballot.
Morgan said the senate chair position is primarily
a facilitator. "It should be someone who is able to
help senators, is well-versed in the constitution,
bylaws and parliamentary procedure, and should not
be working for any personal agenda.
"He or she should serve as a representative of the
senate on University committees and communicate
the voice of the majority and the objections to that
view, not his or her own personal opinions," added
Morgan, a sophomore.
The role of senate chair has recently been criti
cized, and the three challengers have levied several
charges at the incumbent, Kwan.
While acknowledging that she has worked very
hard, Moore, Rabois and Warsh said Kwan has
