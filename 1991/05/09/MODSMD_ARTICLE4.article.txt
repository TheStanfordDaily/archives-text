# Candidates vie for senate chair
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The most powerful position within the ASSU Sen
ate will be filled at the first meeting of the newly
elected senators tonight.
Four candidates are vying for senate chair —
juniors Solina Kwan, Jason Moore and Kevin Warsh,
and senior Keith Rabois, who will attend the Law
School next year. Kwan is the current senate chair.
None of the four candidates are elected senators,
but all except Rabois have been senators in the past.
Although all four candidates agree that the senate
chair is a non-partisan position, many senate
observers predict that the election will go along party
lines, with Kwan receiving the eight People's Plat
form votes and Moore, Rabois and Warsh splitting
the nine Students First votes.
To win, a candidate needs a simple majority
among the 20 voting senators. If a majority is not
reached, two additional ballots will be held. If that
fails, a final preferential ballot will be held to deter
mine the winner, said current deputy senate chair
and COP member-elect Beth Morgan.
For the preferential ballot, senators rank the can

didates one through four. Candidates with the least
number of votes are dropped, and their votes are dis
tributed among their second choices. This process
continues until a majority is reached.
The one Hammer and Coffin and two indepen
dent senators will likely be instrumental in deter
mining the outcome of the race, which many expect
will probably not be decided until the final ballot.
Morgan said the senate chair position is primarily
a facilitator. "It should be someone who is able to
help senators, is well-versed in the constitution,
bylaws and parliamentary procedure, and should not
be working for any personal agenda.
"He or she should serve as a representative of the
senate on University committees and communicate
the voice of the majority and the objections to that
view, not his or her own personal opinions," added
Morgan, a sophomore.
The role of senate chair has recently been criti
cized, and the three challengers have levied several
charges at the incumbent, Kwan.
While acknowledging that she has worked very
hard, Moore, Rabois and Warsh said Kwan has
repeatedly ignored the bylaws and
parliamentary procedure.
"In following the bylaws and
parliamentary procedure, there
has been a great deal lacking"
with Kwan as senate chair this
year, Moore said. "She has repeat
edly said the senate should not let
the bylaws stand in the way of
student initiative, but the bylaws
are necessary to provide a check
on student government."
"Through the arbitrary use of
parliamentary procedure, Solina
has not allowed the opposition
senators to speak," Warsh added.
But Kwan defended her
actions in the senate, explaining
that in her role as a facilitator it
was her duty to "give the senate
all of the different options."
In one case, when the bylaws
prevented the senate from allo
cating $200 to Women's Herstory
Week in March because the
Women's Center already receives
a special fee, Kwan supported the
senate's decision to loan the

money interest-free.
"It is inaccurate to describe the
procedure as circumvention. I
simply stated the options that the
senate could take," Kwan said.
Another issue for the new sen
ate chair will be the length of sen
ate meetings.
The senate has been criticized
for the length of several recent
meetings. According to bylaws,
after 10 p.m. the senate must
leave its customary room in the
Law School.
Kwan has recently tried to ask
the senate to limit its debate to 10
minutes on every issue, which she
said can always be extended if the
senate wants more time.
But Moore said that too much
time is being wasted trying to
limit debate and that senators
should be allowed to state their
complete opinion. "I do not want
to play a partisan game of impos
ing time limits on issues I do not
agree with," Moore said.
Warsh said time could be saved
and discussions could be short
ened by stricter enforcement of
Robert's Rules of Order, which he
said the senate often arbitrarily
ignores.
