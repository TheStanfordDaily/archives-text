# TEACHING FROM EXPERIENCE
## 
### 
Amidst Stanford's slew of academi
cally laudable faculty, there
remains an instructor who has yet
to win a scholarly award, but
whose exceptional work is as notable as all
the rest.
Instead of Pulitzer Prizes, this man
packs his resume with the names of highly
regarded international companies... ballet
companies, that is.
Ken Delmar, dancer and teacher
extraordinaire, has been the principal ballet
instructor at Stanford for the past three
years. He made his home in the Bay Area
only after spending a good part of his
career dancing professionally on stages
from New York to Moscow.
Listening to Delmar teach a ballet class
is almost like eavesdropping on a monk
reciting his daily prayers. His voice is sooth
ing and reassuring; he describes exercises to
his students in a barely audible, melodic
chant keeping time with the music.
His calm voice, however, is in no way an
indicator of his physical presence. Delmar's
compact build and toned physique allow all
his moves to appear effortless. Watching
him dance, one needn't be a classical ballet
expert to recognize the years of experience
and training behind his solid, yet elegant
movements.
But perhaps more important than Del
mar's artistic accomplishments is his
friendly manner that makes him a favorite
among students in the Dance Department.
A quick smile and easy laugh complete his
youthful image and complement his condi
tioned body. Given his youthful verve, it's
not hard to imagine Delmar taking classes
here himself. And in fact, he does. This
year, Delmar completed two quarters of a
freshman CIV tract.
As if this weren't enough, Delmar also
holds the position of artistic director at the
Western Ballet Company located in Moun-

tain View. His current "pet project"
involves implementing a scholarship pro
gram for Mexican-Americans enabling
them to take classes at the company's
school without paying tuition.
A casual chat with Delmar quickly
reveals his love for ballet and for his stu
dents, as well as intelligent reflections on
life at Stanford and beyond.
Intermission: So Ken, how did you get
your start in ballet?
Ken Delmar: When I was 11 years old I was
watching my sister dance and her teacher
dared me to take the class. I fell in love with
the expressionistic qualities of ballet and
knew right away that that was what I
wanted to do for the rest of my life. I started
taking as many classes as I could beginning
with one a day, then two, then three — at
one point I was taking four ballet classes a
day.
I: Whew! How did you do that? One class at
a time looks strenuous enough!
KD: Well, I knew the piano player and she
would slip me candy in the middle of class
for extra energy. I loved it so much that I
just didn't want to stop.
I: As a teenager, you began studying in New
York. Wasn't that an intimidating place to
move to alone at such a young age?
KD: Yes. In fact, the first time I went there,
I came home after three days. I had never
seen a cockroach before and I was even get
ting propositions on the streets. 1 came
back the next year a little more prepared to
handle New York City life.
I: Did you find dancing in Europe very dif
ferent from performing in the United
States?
KD: Well, I found it much more appealing
for manv reasons. We were dancing in

amazing places — palaces, castles, piazzas
and some of the most beautiful theaters in
the world. It was really an incredible way to
get to know the different cultures.
I: After traveling and performing around
the world, do you find Stanford enough to
hold your interest?
KD: Oh, I love Stanford! I really do. The
atmosphere is wonderful and the students
are all so bright.
I: You're in an interesting position, being
both a teacher and a student.
KD: It does give me an unusual perspective,
since I play both roles. I really enjoy being
able to continue my interests in poetry, lit
erature and philosophy here, but the classes
I've taken have really made me feel for the
students ... I'd rather do just about any
thing than have to take a Stanford exam!
I: How does teaching ballet at Stanford
compare to teaching at a ballet school or
company?
KD: I had to change my teaching methods
when I came to Stanford. Stanford students
aren't planning on making a career out of
ballet, so my classes can be less drill-like
and less demanding. I also find I have to
speed up the pace, students here grasp
material very quickly.
I: Are there any particularly memorable
moments you've had since you've been
here?
KD: Well, one time I was asked by an
anatomy class at the Medical School to be
their model. While I was there, I got to look
at several cadavers that the students were
studying for their class. The next day,
before my ballet class, I felt kind of strange
and depressed. Then my students came in
and I saw the color in their cheeks and all of
their vitality ... seeing them really made
me appreciate life.
