# Dance production sparks 'Spring Migration' to Roble Gym
## 
### Kristin Schrader 
Across the globe spring signals the
arrival of warm weather, long days and
colorful flowers. At Stanford, however,
spring heralds the coming of some
thing else as well: the Dance Depart
ment's annual performance of Spring
Migration.
This year's performance features
faculty as well as student choreogra
phy, focusing on a spectrum of forms
and tones, with question marks, excla
mation points and ellipses....
The collection of dances includes
two pieces from the repertory of
Isadora Duncan, bringing a taste of
traditional ballet-based dance to
Spring Migration. Arranged by
Melinda McGee from the Music
Department, these dances emphasize
the symmetry and unison reminiscent
of les corps de ballet.
Guest choreographer, Mel Wong,
the first Asian-American to receive a
Guggenheim Fellowship, has chore
ographed "The Other House," which
strays from the traditional constraints
of dance by intermingling verbal and
physical communication. This some
times humorous depiction of the
dancers' childhood memories —
dancing among the trash they have lit
tered over the floor — carries the
theme of questioning, "What's next?"
Tony Morris-Kramer and his wife,
Noelle, have choreographed a piece
depicting death, which dancer Charan
Devereaux, in attempting to describe
the piece, claims, "I just wish I could
see it." The black-clad dancers whirl in
an abyss of movement as death comes
like a thief"... In the Night."

dancers reveal the lines created by

Marlies Yearby, artist-in-residence of
the Dance Department. The piece is
currently included in the repertory of
Movin' Spirits Dance Theatre, under
Yearby's direction.
However, this solo was first created
between 1985 and 1986 and was
Yearby's first piece of choreography
after she moved away from the Bay
Area — where she attended San Jose
State University — and established
herself in New York.
This same piece, performed in a
four-choreographer showcase Off-
Broadway, led to her discovery by and
initiation into Urban Bush Women
Dance Company.
The breathing and vocal sounds
that Yearby exerts while performing,
familiar to her students in Jazz I and
Modern 111 classes, reflect her mood
and energy at the time of performance
and change accordingly.
She remains true to the pre-estab
lished structural choreograghy while
enhancing the legato music of Oregon
with her percussive breathing.
To explain the piece, Yearby offers,
"Mama said, 'Life isn't a bowl of cher
ries.' 1 said, 'I don't care, I don't like
cherries anyway.' But Mama didn't say
life was a never-ending nightmare or a
tight box 0r...
In addition to the mainstay of fac
ulty choreography, Spring Migration
features a plethora of student pieces
portraying the diversity of talent and
direction to be found in the depart
ment.
Torrence Boone enhances the ryth
mic movement of "Red" with audible
breathing similar to Yearby's "accom
paniment." In his duet performed with
Marshall Jones, the two dancers keep
perfect time even in the intermittent
silences in the Miles Davis medley.
Boone and Jones alternate between
lyrical, linear movements and synco
pated, aggressive leaps and steps por

traying strength, agility and courage.
Robin Roos performs a power
packed, self-chorographed solo to
music by Meredith Monk. In "You Can
Run But You Can't Hide," Roos por
trays a jester character in a costume of
black, red and white, exuding stamina
and energy.
Lea Wolf performs with
Carmichael Blankenship an intimate
duet that she choreographed to an
original piano composition by David
Millis. "Coming To ..begins in the
tradition of the ballet pas de deux, but
subsequently surpasses this rigid form
by changing planes and levels, even
taking the pas de deux to ground level,
sitting on the floor. The piece veers
toward the acrobatic as Blankenship
swings, spins and handsprings over his
partner, while holding to the tender
ness of a balletic duet.

Excerpts of vocal music by Mered
ith Monk and Pauline Oliveros pro
vides the background for Catherine
Goodstein's "Spectra," yet the chore
ography of this solo demonstrates a
spectrum of movement intensity inde
pendent from the musical structure.
Goodstein commits her full body to
both lyrical extensions and brisk,
striking motion, exploring her own
bodily potential. Her costume of pri
mary colors complements the basic
importance of movement and dance
which continues in her prism-shaped
spin even after the lights go down.
Richard Green has created a
sophisticated "Me and My Shadow," a
duet with Shawn Truwe in which the
two "Walk, Fall, .... Crawl Again."
The two dancers weave in and out of
the flats and each other, alternating
between moments of opposition and

unison, mimicking one another's
movement and feeding off one
another's energy.
The student choreography in this
year's Spring Migration is overwhelm
ing both in quality aand quantity. In
fact, the plentitude of pieces per
formed has created a need for alternat
ing schedules: Torrence Boone's "Red,"
Catherine Goodstein's "Spectra," and
Richard Green's "Walk, Fall, . . . ,
Crawl Again" and Lea Wolf's "Coming
To ..." will be presented Wednesday
and Friday; Robin Roos' "You Can
Run But You Can't Hide" and the two
Isadora Duncan pieces will be pre
sented Thursday and Saturday; faculty
choreography by Diane Frank, Tony
Morris-Kramer, Mel Wong,and Mar
lies Yearby will be performed at every
show, Wednesday through Saturday at
8:30 pm in Roble Studio.

Creative choreography from Stanford students as well as faculty will be showcased at the dance department's annual
production, "Spring Migration."
Across the globe spring signals the
arrival of warm weather, long days and
colorful flowers. At Stanford, however,
spring heralds the coming of some
thing else as well: the Dance Depart
ment's annual performance of Spring
Migration.
This year's performance features
faculty as well as student choreogra
phy, focusing on a spectrum of forms
and tones, with question marks, excla
mation points and ellipses....
The collection of dances includes
two pieces from the repertory of
Isadora Duncan, bringing a taste of
traditional ballet-based dance to
Spring Migration. Arranged by
Melinda McGee from the Music
Department, these dances emphasize
the symmetry and unison reminiscent
of les corps de ballet.
Guest choreographer, Mel Wong,
the first Asian-American to receive a
Guggenheim Fellowship, has chore
ographed "The Other House," which
strays from the traditional constraints
of dance by intermingling verbal and
physical communication. This some
times humorous depiction of the
dancers' childhood memories —
dancing among the trash they have lit
tered over the floor — carries the
theme of questioning, "What's next?"
Tony Morris-Kramer and his wife,
Noelle, have choreographed a piece
depicting death, which dancer Charan
Devereaux, in attempting to describe
the piece, claims, "I just wish I could
see it." The black-clad dancers whirl in
an abyss of movement as death comes
like a thief"... In the Night."

dancers reveal the lines created by
their particular movement while

Marlies Yearby, artist-in-residence of
the Dance Department. The piece is
currently included in the repertory of
Movin' Spirits Dance Theatre, under
Yearby's direction.
However, this solo was first created
between 1985 and 1986 and was
Yearby's first piece of choreography
after she moved away from the Bay
Area — where she attended San Jose
State University — and established
herself in New York.
This same piece, performed in a
four-choreographer showcase Off-
Broadway, led to her discovery by and
initiation into Urban Bush Women
Dance Company.
The breathing and vocal sounds
that Yearby exerts while performing,
familiar to her students in Jazz I and
Modern 111 classes, reflect her mood
and energy at the time of performance
and change accordingly.
She remains true to the pre-estab
lished structural choreograghy while
enhancing the legato music of Oregon
with her percussive breathing.
To explain the piece, Yearby offers,
"Mama said, 'Life isn't a bowl of cher
ries.' 1 said, 'I don't care, I don't like
cherries anyway.' But Mama didn't say
life was a never-ending nightmare or a
tight box 0r...
In addition to the mainstay of fac
ulty choreography, Spring Migration
features a plethora of student pieces
portraying the diversity of talent and
direction to be found in the depart
ment.
Torrence Boone enhances the ryth
mic movement of "Red" with audible
breathing similar to Yearby's "accom
paniment." In his duet performed with
Marshall Jones, the two dancers keep
perfect time even in the intermittent
silences in the Miles Davis medley.
Boone and Jones alternate between
lyrical, linear movements and synco
pated, aggressive leaps and steps por

traying strength, agility and courage.
Robin Roos performs a power
packed, self-chorographed solo to
music by Meredith Monk. In "You Can
Run But You Can't Hide," Roos por
trays a jester character in a costume of
black, red and white, exuding stamina
and energy.
Lea Wolf performs with
Carmichael Blankenship an intimate
duet that she choreographed to an
original piano composition by David
Millis. "Coming To ..begins in the
tradition of the ballet pas de deux, but
subsequently surpasses this rigid form
by changing planes and levels, even
taking the pas de deux to ground level,
sitting on the floor. The piece veers
toward the acrobatic as Blankenship
swings, spins and handsprings over his
partner, while holding to the tender
ness of a balletic duet.

Excerpts of vocal music by Mered
ith Monk and Pauline Oliveros pro
vides the background for Catherine
Goodstein's "Spectra," yet the chore
ography of this solo demonstrates a
spectrum of movement intensity inde
pendent from the musical structure.
Goodstein commits her full body to
both lyrical extensions and brisk,
striking motion, exploring her own
bodily potential. Her costume of pri
mary colors complements the basic
importance of movement and dance
which continues in her prism-shaped
spin even after the lights go down.
Richard Green has created a
sophisticated "Me and My Shadow," a
duet with Shawn Truwe in which the
two "Walk, Fall, .... Crawl Again."
The two dancers weave in and out of
the flats and each other, alternating
between moments of opposition and

unison, mimicking one another's
movement and feeding off one
another's energy.
The student choreography in this
year's Spring Migration is overwhelm
ing both in quality aand quantity. In
fact, the plentitude of pieces per
formed has created a need for alternat
ing schedules: Torrence Boone's "Red,"
Catherine Goodstein's "Spectra," and
Richard Green's "Walk, Fall, . . . ,
Crawl Again" and Lea Wolf's "Coming
To ..." will be presented Wednesday
and Friday; Robin Roos' "You Can
Run But You Can't Hide" and the two
Isadora Duncan pieces will be pre
sented Thursday and Saturday; faculty
choreography by Diane Frank, Tony
Morris-Kramer, Mel Wong,and Mar
lies Yearby will be performed at every
show, Wednesday through Saturday at
8:30 pm in Roble Studio.
