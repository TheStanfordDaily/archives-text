Impressive new
music from a
blue-collar city
'Hold Me Up"
The Goo Goo Dolls
I got a package from Buffalo, New
York, with a one-page letter and a
compact disc inside. The cover of the
CD case, with its numerous colored
dots, looked like a test for color blind
ness. The note read as follows: "Wow!
Don't you love the Goo Goos?? They're
the next Replacements, no doubt in
my mind. The is the best new rock 'n'
roll album I've heard since 'Pleased to
Meet Me. "
Talk about raising my expectations.
Yet, although I was set up to be dis
appointed, I loved "Hold Me Up" the
first time I listened to it. This album is
an honest rock record with great tunes
— especially on side one. The songs
have simple lyrics that might look
dumb on paper but work well with the
music.
Long a mainstay of Buffalo clubs,
The Goo Goo Dolls are one of the few
rock bands from that area to break into
the national scene. They sing about
frustration with life, love and aspira
tions in a blue-collar city where pizza
and bowling constitute a night out on
the town, and chicken wings are raised
to near-mythical status.
Their style is punk, thrash and
metal-influenced, but hooks abound
to make it a kind of hyperactive pop.
Without trying too hard for rough
ness, The Goo Goos have a casual,
unpolished feel, somewhat like the
Replacements on "Let It Be." As in "Let
It Be," there is a struggle between great
songwriting and the tendency to
thrash.
"Just the Way You Are" and "There
You Are" are two of the strongest cuts
on the album, two hard-rocking mini
epics. Then there are a few thrash
influenced songs like "On Your Side"
that are catchy in an unexpected way.
Most of the songs don't really fall into
any genre, but are good tunes, with
metal and punk influences, like "So
Outta Line." What makes everything
so "listenable" on this album is that
despite the hard-edged sound and
influences, it all tries to be good pop
music first and foremost.

There are some weird, unexpected
moves too. In the tradition of cheesy
lounge singers covering Prince songs
(as in Tom Jones' version of "Kiss"),
there is a cover of "Never Take the
Place of Your Man" with guest vocalist
the Incredible Lance Diamond, who is
something of a legend in Buffalo
nightclubs. Just imagine a lounge-act
voice singing Prince with a metal twist.
All three members of the band sing
on this album, but their voices blend
because of their similarity in style. In
fact they are a very tight-knit group, as
artists and as friends. As a sign of their
brotherhood, and in the tradition of
bands like the BoDeans, each member
of The Goo Goo Dolls has taken "Goo"
as his/her last name.
I can't recommend this album
enough — the first side is amazing,
and despite a few weaker songs on side
two it is interesting throughout. "Hold
Me Up" is some pretty strong rock and
roll.

The same old
sound is getting
sort of old
"Out of Time"
REM
It's probably my own fault that I
don't love this album. I want to have
my cake and eat it too: I expect a new
album from a band of REM's caliber to
have a discrete and original personal
ity, but at the same time, I demand
that it maintain everything I liked
about the band after I heard their last
album.
Don't get me wrong — I don't hate
"Out of Time." It's just that I wish I
could describe it in more laudatory
terms. After all, I grew up on REM.
They were my favorite band in high
school and the fact that I don't appre
ciate what they're currently producing
makes me afraid I am becoming
stupid, old or both.
By far the best offering on the
album is "Texarkana," which has
everything an REM purist could ever
want. The song resurrects the unmis
takably independent, rousing Mike
Mills bass line that characterizes so
many of the band's classic pieces ("Box
Cars," "Driver 8"). Stipe's amazing,

bright voice is mixed exactly where it
belongs — a bit further back than on
the other tracks — giving the haunt
ing, from-everywhere-and-nowhere
sound that was Stipe's trademark for
the first half of his career.
Yet "Texarkana" and the album's
other classic-style offerings demon
strate no real progress for REM. The
pieces derive their quality not from
originality but from the extent to
which they remind me of earlier songs.
It's as if Stipe et al had read purist crit
icisms of "Green" and "Document"
and, in an attempt to quell complaints,
had exhumed stock features of mate
rial from the early '80s and mixed
them up in a bucket.
The lack of creativity is
pervasive throughout' Out
of Time, and the originali
ty drought is especially
apparent on tracks like
'Shiny Happy People
Do I make myself clear? They're
good songs; they're just not creative —
and this lack of creativity is pervasive
throughout the album. The originality
drought is especially apparent on
tracks like "Shiny Happy People,"
which features B-52s vocalist Kate
Pierson and which is "Out of Time's"
sell-lots-of-records track. "Shiny
Happy People" has lyrical monotony
similar to that featured in an earlier
sellout track — "Orange Crush," from
"Green" — but is musically much less
inspiring than much of what 1 hear
when I accidentally hit the FM button
on my stereo.
Speaking of radio, 1 feel compelled
to complain about "Out of Time's"
first track, "Radio Song," which com
bines self-parodically uncreative
rhymin' by rapper KRS-1 with a gui
tar/organ line that resembles too much
of the material that crept out of
Manchester, England a couple of years
ago (e.g. The Soupdragons).
If this song — which contains the
lyric, "It's the same, same song on the
radio/Makes me sad" — is supposed
to be as ironic as I find it to be, then I
suppose it's kind of funny. Otherwise
. .. well ... thank the Almighty Mag
navox for the programmable scanning
on my compact disc player.
I will close by stating — paradoxi
cally — that I'm not sorry I bought
"Out of Time." The album's last four
tracks justify the purchase, and a few
of the remaining seven songs have
enough lyrical depth to be more than
tolerable.
It's entirely possible that many
people will sincerely enjoy this album.

Heck, it's entirely possible that I will,
too — just as soon as I quit wishing for
REM to start writing songs the way
they did seven years ago.

Dead tribute
brings new lile
to classic folk
"Deadicated," a compilation of
Grateful Dead songs performed
by various artists
The concept behind "Deadicated,"
a benefit album aimed at raising
money to save the rain forests, seems
like the idea of some zonked-out
Deadhead on a bad acid trip.
"Picture this maaaan ... Los Lobos,
Bruce Hornsby, the Harshed Mellows,
Elvis Costello, Suzanne Vega, Dwight
Yoakam, Warren Zevon with David
Lindley, the Indigo Girls, Lyle Lovett,
the Cowboy Junkies, Midnight Oil,
Burning Spear, Dr. John and Jane's
Addiction all playing on the same
album!!! Doing Grateful Dead
songs!!!"
If this person had, say, gone to CBS
Records with this idea, he probably
would have been hospitalized, if not
arrested for trespassing. But, if a cou
ple of big-name record executives
came up with the very same idea, the
album would have gotten made. Hap
pily, the executives thought of it first.
Because it makes sense.
Forget about all the cultural
baggage associated with the Grateful
Dead; forget about the legions of tie
dyed hippie relics dancing convul
sively. Clear away the marijuana haze
and the mountains of skull and danc
ing bear merchandise; ignore the
psychedelic, jazzy improvisation of
Jerry Garcia and the boys.
Without all that, what are you left
with? A catalogue of great American
rock and folk songs.
With all the focus on the "Dead
head" lifestyle, people seem to forget
about the great songs the Grateful
Dead once wrote. (Their studio
albums of the '80s necessitate the use
of the word "once.") "Deadicated" is
aimed at refreshing our memory.
So, is this bizarre melange of artists
and songs any good?
Well, it won't replace "Skeletons
from the Closet" in anyone's record
collection, but for a various-artist
album it's damn good. With compila
tion records, it's always hit or miss, and
there are surprisingly few big misses
here. Given the variety of artists
involved, it's a testament to the Dead's
versatility that half these songs work at
all.
The core of the album is made up of
mediocre covers that leave you hungry

to hear the Dead's originals. Bruce
Hornsby turns in a pleasantly bland
"Jack Straw" that sounds like every
thing else he does. And Suzanne Vega
sings a lovely, haunting, sedate "China
Doll" in her awkward deadpan style
and then blows it by singing the
upbeat "Cassidy" in her awkward
deadpan style.
Dwight Yoakam's "Truckin' " has a
tempting country twang, but his
boozy, boastful delivery of the lyrics
deprives the song of its necessary
urgency.
There's also a group of renditions
that are truly entertaining, but in the
end they're still better off DEAD. Los
Lobos rocks out to "Bertha," Warren
Zevon and David Lindley have a good
time with "Casey Jones," Lyle Lovett
sings an appropriately sad and intro
spective take of "Friend of the Devil"
and the Cowboy Junkie's funeral dirge
sound is quite effective on "To Lay Me
Down."
The only really bad cover on the
album is Midnight Oil's dreadful ver
sion of "Wharf Rat." In the liner notes,
they claim they'd never heard the
Dead's music before, and I'm willing to
bet that they still haven't.
There are, in addition, a few inter
pretations that add so much to the
song that they match or almost match
the Dead's original.
Burning Spear gives "Estimated
Prophet" the full reggae treatment,
practically making a brand new song
out of it.
In this category of great versions,
the Elvis Costello and Jane's Addiction
numbers are the most satisfying.
Jane's Addiction's tribal version of
Ripple (that musically quotes snatches
from"the Other One" and if you listen
closely, "Bird Song" at the end), is an
exciting result from the most unlikely
band on a Grateful Dead project.
Deadheads, however, may not take to
the unorthodox sound.
Finally, Elvis Costello's beautifully
passionate rendering of "Ship of
Fools" takes this moving anthem on a
new emotional voyage. A song about a
ship of fools, written in the Watergate
era, and re-recorded during the Gulf
war, is perfectly suited to Costello's
affinity for bitter irony.
If all these song titles don't conjure
up any music in your head, you should
probably check out some of the Dead's
own albums first. Otherwise, go ahead,
satisfy your curiosity and give "Deadi
cated" a listen. Besides showing you
that the Dead are the best at perform
ing their own music, this album will
help you remember how great the
Dead's songwriting used to be; it'll
"turn you on" to some new artists; and
you might even help save a rain forest.

Addiction all playing on the same

songs!!!"
If this person had, say, gone to CBS
Records with this idea, he probably
would have been hospitalized, if not
arrested for trespassing. But, if a cou
ple of big-name record executives
came up with the very same idea, the
album would have gotten made. Hap
pily, the executives thought of it first.
Because it makes sense.
Forget about all the cultural
baggage associated with the Grateful
Dead; forget about the legions of tie
dyed hippie relics dancing convul
sively. Clear away the marijuana haze
and the mountains of skull and danc
ing bear merchandise; ignore the
psychedelic, jazzy improvisation of
Jerry Garcia and the boys.
Without all that, what are you left
with? A catalogue of great American
rock and folk songs.
With all the focus on the "Dead
head" lifestyle, people seem to forget
about the great songs the Grateful
Dead once wrote. (Their studio
albums of the '80s necessitate the use
of the word "once.") "Deadicated" is
aimed at refreshing our memory.
So, is this bizarre melange of artists
and songs any good?
Well, it won't replace "Skeletons
from the Closet" in anyone's record
collection, but for a various-artist
album it's damn good. With compila
tion records, it's always hit or miss, and
there are surprisingly few big misses
here. Given the variety of artists
involved, it's a testament to the Dead's
versatility that half these songs work at
all.
The core of the album is made up of
mediocre covers that leave you hungry

to hear the Dead's originals. Bruce
Hornsby turns in a pleasantly bland
"Jack Straw" that sounds like every
thing else he does. And Suzanne Vega
sings a lovely, haunting, sedate "China
Doll" in her awkward deadpan style
and then blows it by singing the
upbeat "Cassidy" in her awkward
deadpan style.
Dwight Yoakam's "Truckin' " has a
tempting country twang, but his
boozy, boastful delivery of the lyrics
deprives the song of its necessary
urgency.
There's also a group of renditions
that are truly entertaining, but in the
end they're still better off DEAD. Los
Lobos rocks out to "Bertha," Warren
Zevon and David Lindley have a good
time with "Casey Jones," Lyle Lovett
sings an appropriately sad and intro
spective take of "Friend of the Devil"
and the Cowboy Junkie's funeral dirge
sound is quite effective on "To Lay Me
Down."
The only really bad cover on the
album is Midnight Oil's dreadful ver
sion of "Wharf Rat." In the liner notes,
they claim they'd never heard the
Dead's music before, and I'm willing to
bet that they still haven't.
There are, in addition, a few inter
pretations that add so much to the
song that they match or almost match
the Dead's original.
Burning Spear gives "Estimated
Prophet" the full reggae treatment,
practically making a brand new song
out of it.
In this category of great versions,
the Elvis Costello and Jane's Addiction
numbers are the most satisfying.
Jane's Addiction's tribal version of
Ripple (that musically quotes snatches
from"the Other One" and if you listen
closely, "Bird Song" at the end), is an
exciting result from the most unlikely
band on a Grateful Dead project.
Deadheads, however, may not take to
the unorthodox sound.
Finally, Elvis Costello's beautifully
passionate rendering of "Ship of
Fools" takes this moving anthem on a
new emotional voyage. A song about a
ship of fools, written in the Watergate
era, and re-recorded during the Gulf
war, is perfectly suited to Costello's
affinity for bitter irony.
If all these song titles don't conjure
up any music in your head, you should
probably check out some of the Dead's
own albums first. Otherwise, go ahead,
satisfy your curiosity and give "Deadi
cated" a listen. Besides showing you
that the Dead are the best at perform
ing their own music, this album will
help you remember how great the
Dead's songwriting used to be; it'll
"turn you on" to some new artists; and
you might even help save a rain forest.

Impressive new
music from a
blue-collar city
'Hold Me Up"
The Goo Goo Dolls
I got a package from Buffalo, New
York, with a one-page letter and a
compact disc inside. The cover of the
CD case, with its numerous colored
dots, looked like a test for color blind
ness. The note read as follows: "Wow!
Don't you love the Goo Goos?? They're
the next Replacements, no doubt in
my mind. The is the best new rock 'n'
roll album I've heard since 'Pleased to
Meet Me. "
Talk about raising my expectations.
Yet, although I was set up to be dis
appointed, I loved "Hold Me Up" the
first time I listened to it. This album is
an honest rock record with great tunes
— especially on side one. The songs
have simple lyrics that might look
dumb on paper but work well with the
music.
Long a mainstay of Buffalo clubs,
The Goo Goo Dolls are one of the few
rock bands from that area to break into
the national scene. They sing about
frustration with life, love and aspira
tions in a blue-collar city where pizza
and bowling constitute a night out on
the town, and chicken wings are raised
to near-mythical status.
Their style is punk, thrash and
metal-influenced, but hooks abound
to make it a kind of hyperactive pop.
Without trying too hard for rough
ness, The Goo Goos have a casual,
unpolished feel, somewhat like the
Replacements on "Let It Be." As in "Let
It Be," there is a struggle between great
songwriting and the tendency to
thrash.
"Just the Way You Are" and "There
You Are" are two of the strongest cuts
on the album, two hard-rocking mini
epics. Then there are a few thrash
influenced songs like "On Your Side"
that are catchy in an unexpected way.
Most of the songs don't really fall into
any genre, but are good tunes, with
metal and punk influences, like "So
Outta Line." What makes everything
so "listenable" on this album is that
despite the hard-edged sound and
influences, it all tries to be good pop
music first and foremost.

There are some weird, unexpected
moves too. In the tradition of cheesy
lounge singers covering Prince songs
(as in Tom Jones' version of "Kiss"),
there is a cover of "Never Take the
Place of Your Man" with guest vocalist
the Incredible Lance Diamond, who is
something of a legend in Buffalo
nightclubs. Just imagine a lounge-act
voice singing Prince with a metal twist.
All three members of the band sing
on this album, but their voices blend
because of their similarity in style. In
fact they are a very tight-knit group, as
artists and as friends. As a sign of their
brotherhood, and in the tradition of
bands like the BoDeans, each member
of The Goo Goo Dolls has taken "Goo"
as his/her last name.
I can't recommend this album
enough — the first side is amazing,
and despite a few weaker songs on side
two it is interesting throughout. "Hold
Me Up" is some pretty strong rock and
roll.
— Paul Yu
The same old
sound is getting
sort of old
"Out of Time"
REM
It's probably my own fault that I
don't love this album. I want to have
my cake and eat it too: I expect a new
album from a band of REM's caliber to
have a discrete and original personal
ity, but at the same time, I demand
that it maintain everything I liked
about the band after I heard their last
album.
Don't get me wrong — I don't hate
"Out of Time." It's just that I wish I
could describe it in more laudatory
terms. After all, I grew up on REM.
They were my favorite band in high
school and the fact that I don't appre
ciate what they're currently producing
makes me afraid I am becoming
stupid, old or both.
By far the best offering on the
album is "Texarkana," which has
everything an REM purist could ever
want. The song resurrects the unmis
takably independent, rousing Mike
Mills bass line that characterizes so
many of the band's classic pieces ("Box
Cars," "Driver 8"). Stipe's amazing,

bright voice is mixed exactly where it
belongs — a bit further back than on
the other tracks — giving the haunt
ing, from-everywhere-and-nowhere
sound that was Stipe's trademark for
the first half of his career.
Yet "Texarkana" and the album's
other classic-style offerings demon
strate no real progress for REM. The
pieces derive their quality not from
originality but from the extent to
which they remind me of earlier songs.
It's as if Stipe et al had read purist crit
icisms of "Green" and "Document"
and, in an attempt to quell complaints,
had exhumed stock features of mate
rial from the early '80s and mixed
them up in a bucket.
The lack of creativity is
pervasive throughout' Out
of Time, and the originali
ty drought is especially
apparent on tracks like
'Shiny Happy People
Do I make myself clear? They're
good songs; they're just not creative —
and this lack of creativity is pervasive
throughout the album. The originality
drought is especially apparent on
tracks like "Shiny Happy People,"
which features B-52s vocalist Kate
Pierson and which is "Out of Time's"
sell-lots-of-records track. "Shiny
Happy People" has lyrical monotony
similar to that featured in an earlier
sellout track — "Orange Crush," from
"Green" — but is musically much less
inspiring than much of what 1 hear
when I accidentally hit the FM button
on my stereo.
Speaking of radio, 1 feel compelled
to complain about "Out of Time's"
first track, "Radio Song," which com
bines self-parodically uncreative
rhymin' by rapper KRS-1 with a gui
tar/organ line that resembles too much
of the material that crept out of
Manchester, England a couple of years
ago (e.g. The Soupdragons).
If this song — which contains the
lyric, "It's the same, same song on the
radio/Makes me sad" — is supposed
to be as ironic as I find it to be, then I
suppose it's kind of funny. Otherwise
. .. well ... thank the Almighty Mag
navox for the programmable scanning
on my compact disc player.
I will close by stating — paradoxi
cally — that I'm not sorry I bought
"Out of Time." The album's last four
tracks justify the purchase, and a few
of the remaining seven songs have
enough lyrical depth to be more than
tolerable.
It's entirely possible that many
people will sincerely enjoy this album.

Heck, it's entirely possible that I will,
too — just as soon as I quit wishing for
REM to start writing songs the way
they did seven years ago.

sort of old
"Out of Time"
REM
It's probably my own fault that I
don't love this album. I want to have
my cake and eat it too: I expect a new
album from a band of REM's caliber to
have a discrete and original personal
ity, but at the same time, I demand
that it maintain everything I liked
about the band after I heard their last
album.
Don't get me wrong — I don't hate
"Out of Time." It's just that I wish I
could describe it in more laudatory
terms. After all, I grew up on REM.
They were my favorite band in high
school and the fact that I don't appre
ciate what they're currently producing
makes me afraid I am becoming
stupid, old or both.
By far the best offering on the
album is "Texarkana," which has
everything an REM purist could ever
want. The song resurrects the unmis
takably independent, rousing Mike
Mills bass line that characterizes so
many of the band's classic pieces ("Box
Cars," "Driver 8"). Stipe's amazing,

bright voice is mixed exactly where it
belongs — a bit further back than on
the other tracks — giving the haunt
ing, from-everywhere-and-nowhere
sound that was Stipe's trademark for
the first half of his career.
Yet "Texarkana" and the album's
other classic-style offerings demon
strate no real progress for REM. The
pieces derive their quality not from
originality but from the extent to
which they remind me of earlier songs.
It's as if Stipe et al had read purist crit
icisms of "Green" and "Document"
and, in an attempt to quell complaints,
had exhumed stock features of mate
rial from the early '80s and mixed
them up in a bucket.
The lack of creativity is
pervasive throughout' Out
of Time, and the originali
ty drought is especially
apparent on tracks like
'Shiny Happy People
Do I make myself clear? They're
good songs; they're just not creative —
and this lack of creativity is pervasive
throughout the album. The originality
drought is especially apparent on
tracks like "Shiny Happy People,"
which features B-52s vocalist Kate
Pierson and which is "Out of Time's"
sell-lots-of-records track. "Shiny
Happy People" has lyrical monotony
similar to that featured in an earlier
sellout track — "Orange Crush," from
"Green" — but is musically much less
inspiring than much of what 1 hear
when I accidentally hit the FM button
on my stereo.
Speaking of radio, 1 feel compelled
to complain about "Out of Time's"
first track, "Radio Song," which com
bines self-parodically uncreative
rhymin' by rapper KRS-1 with a gui
tar/organ line that resembles too much
of the material that crept out of
Manchester, England a couple of years
ago (e.g. The Soupdragons).
If this song — which contains the
lyric, "It's the same, same song on the
radio/Makes me sad" — is supposed
to be as ironic as I find it to be, then I
suppose it's kind of funny. Otherwise
. .. well ... thank the Almighty Mag
navox for the programmable scanning
on my compact disc player.
I will close by stating — paradoxi
cally — that I'm not sorry I bought
"Out of Time." The album's last four
tracks justify the purchase, and a few
of the remaining seven songs have
enough lyrical depth to be more than
tolerable.
It's entirely possible that many
people will sincerely enjoy this album.

Heck, it's entirely possible that I will,
too — just as soon as I quit wishing for
REM to start writing songs the way
they did seven years ago.

Dead tribute
brings new lile
to classic folk
"Deadicated," a compilation of
Grateful Dead songs performed
by various artists
The concept behind "Deadicated,"
a benefit album aimed at raising
money to save the rain forests, seems
like the idea of some zonked-out
Deadhead on a bad acid trip.
"Picture this maaaan ... Los Lobos,
Bruce Hornsby, the Harshed Mellows,
Elvis Costello, Suzanne Vega, Dwight
Yoakam, Warren Zevon with David
Lindley, the Indigo Girls, Lyle Lovett,
the Cowboy Junkies, Midnight Oil,
Burning Spear, Dr. John and Jane's
Addiction all playing on the same
album!!! Doing Grateful Dead
songs!!!"
If this person had, say, gone to CBS
Records with this idea, he probably
would have been hospitalized, if not
arrested for trespassing. But, if a cou
ple of big-name record executives
came up with the very same idea, the
album would have gotten made. Hap
pily, the executives thought of it first.
Because it makes sense.
Forget about all the cultural
baggage associated with the Grateful
Dead; forget about the legions of tie
dyed hippie relics dancing convul
sively. Clear away the marijuana haze
and the mountains of skull and danc
ing bear merchandise; ignore the
psychedelic, jazzy improvisation of
Jerry Garcia and the boys.
Without all that, what are you left
with? A catalogue of great American
rock and folk songs.
With all the focus on the "Dead
head" lifestyle, people seem to forget
about the great songs the Grateful
Dead once wrote. (Their studio
albums of the '80s necessitate the use
of the word "once.") "Deadicated" is
aimed at refreshing our memory.
So, is this bizarre melange of artists
and songs any good?
Well, it won't replace "Skeletons
from the Closet" in anyone's record
collection, but for a various-artist
album it's damn good. With compila
tion records, it's always hit or miss, and
there are surprisingly few big misses
here. Given the variety of artists
involved, it's a testament to the Dead's
versatility that half these songs work at
all.
The core of the album is made up of
mediocre covers that leave you hungry

to hear the Dead's originals. Bruce
Hornsby turns in a pleasantly bland
"Jack Straw" that sounds like every
thing else he does. And Suzanne Vega
sings a lovely, haunting, sedate "China
Doll" in her awkward deadpan style
and then blows it by singing the
upbeat "Cassidy" in her awkward
deadpan style.
Dwight Yoakam's "Truckin' " has a
tempting country twang, but his
boozy, boastful delivery of the lyrics
deprives the song of its necessary
urgency.
There's also a group of renditions
that are truly entertaining, but in the
end they're still better off DEAD. Los
Lobos rocks out to "Bertha," Warren
Zevon and David Lindley have a good
time with "Casey Jones," Lyle Lovett
sings an appropriately sad and intro
spective take of "Friend of the Devil"
and the Cowboy Junkie's funeral dirge
sound is quite effective on "To Lay Me
Down."
The only really bad cover on the
album is Midnight Oil's dreadful ver
sion of "Wharf Rat." In the liner notes,
they claim they'd never heard the
Dead's music before, and I'm willing to
bet that they still haven't.
There are, in addition, a few inter
pretations that add so much to the
song that they match or almost match
the Dead's original.
Burning Spear gives "Estimated
Prophet" the full reggae treatment,
practically making a brand new song
out of it.
In this category of great versions,
the Elvis Costello and Jane's Addiction
numbers are the most satisfying.
Jane's Addiction's tribal version of
Ripple (that musically quotes snatches
from"the Other One" and if you listen
closely, "Bird Song" at the end), is an
exciting result from the most unlikely
band on a Grateful Dead project.
Deadheads, however, may not take to
the unorthodox sound.
Finally, Elvis Costello's beautifully
passionate rendering of "Ship of
Fools" takes this moving anthem on a
new emotional voyage. A song about a
ship of fools, written in the Watergate
era, and re-recorded during the Gulf
war, is perfectly suited to Costello's
affinity for bitter irony.
If all these song titles don't conjure
up any music in your head, you should
probably check out some of the Dead's
own albums first. Otherwise, go ahead,
satisfy your curiosity and give "Deadi
cated" a listen. Besides showing you
that the Dead are the best at perform
ing their own music, this album will
help you remember how great the
Dead's songwriting used to be; it'll
"turn you on" to some new artists; and
you might even help save a rain forest.

Impressive new
music from a
blue-collar city
'Hold Me Up"
The Goo Goo Dolls
I got a package from Buffalo, New
York, with a one-page letter and a
compact disc inside. The cover of the
CD case, with its numerous colored
dots, looked like a test for color blind
ness. The note read as follows: "Wow!
Don't you love the Goo Goos?? They're
the next Replacements, no doubt in
my mind. The is the best new rock 'n'
roll album I've heard since 'Pleased to
Meet Me. "
Talk about raising my expectations.
Yet, although I was set up to be dis
appointed, I loved "Hold Me Up" the
first time I listened to it. This album is
an honest rock record with great tunes
— especially on side one. The songs
have simple lyrics that might look
dumb on paper but work well with the
music.
Long a mainstay of Buffalo clubs,
The Goo Goo Dolls are one of the few
rock bands from that area to break into
the national scene. They sing about
frustration with life, love and aspira
tions in a blue-collar city where pizza
and bowling constitute a night out on
the town, and chicken wings are raised
to near-mythical status.
Their style is punk, thrash and
metal-influenced, but hooks abound
to make it a kind of hyperactive pop.
Without trying too hard for rough
ness, The Goo Goos have a casual,
unpolished feel, somewhat like the
Replacements on "Let It Be." As in "Let
It Be," there is a struggle between great
songwriting and the tendency to
thrash.
"Just the Way You Are" and "There
You Are" are two of the strongest cuts
on the album, two hard-rocking mini
epics. Then there are a few thrash
influenced songs like "On Your Side"
that are catchy in an unexpected way.
Most of the songs don't really fall into
any genre, but are good tunes, with
metal and punk influences, like "So
Outta Line." What makes everything
so "listenable" on this album is that
despite the hard-edged sound and
influences, it all tries to be good pop
music first and foremost.

There are some weird, unexpected
moves too. In the tradition of cheesy
lounge singers covering Prince songs
(as in Tom Jones' version of "Kiss"),
there is a cover of "Never Take the
Place of Your Man" with guest vocalist
the Incredible Lance Diamond, who is
something of a legend in Buffalo
nightclubs. Just imagine a lounge-act
voice singing Prince with a metal twist.
All three members of the band sing
on this album, but their voices blend
because of their similarity in style. In
fact they are a very tight-knit group, as
artists and as friends. As a sign of their
brotherhood, and in the tradition of
bands like the BoDeans, each member
of The Goo Goo Dolls has taken "Goo"
as his/her last name.
I can't recommend this album
enough — the first side is amazing,
and despite a few weaker songs on side
two it is interesting throughout. "Hold
Me Up" is some pretty strong rock and
roll.
