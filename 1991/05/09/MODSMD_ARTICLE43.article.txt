Why can't she
have her cake
and eat it too?
"Eating," is a documentary
exploring women's relation
ships with food.
"Twenty-five years ago, the secret
subject of women was sex ... today it's
food!" says one woman in Henry
Jaglom's "Eating."
In this film, Jaglom daringly
explores the relationship between
women and food in a serious, yet
comic documentary style. Jaglom sees
the hilarity in these women's hang-ups
with food, but also recognizes them as
serious problems which need to be
confronted. By creating a film which
portrays both aspects of the issue, he
attempts to show how ridiculous these
women's attitudes are in an effort to
have society address them.
In the movie, 38 women meet for a
triple-birthday party, but only one will
openly eat the cake. The other women
all have eating disorders. The excep
tion is an older woman from an earlier
generation, who has not been affected
by society's new emphasis on the stick
figured woman. The contrast between
this woman and the other 37 demon
strates that these eating disorders have
not always existed and, therefore, do
not necessarily exist.

Eating disorders encompass not
only the explicit starvation tactics of
anorexia and bulimia, but also low
self-esteem and unhealthy attitudes
towards food, men and sex. For exam
ple, one woman tries to convince her
partners to have sex before dinner
because she can not enjoy it on a full
stomach.
Jaglom effectively shows the unlim
ited scope of the problem by offering a
wide range of attitudes. And women
are able to sympathize with those char
acters who share their own relation
ship with food.
I think that one's reaction to the
movie is dependent on one's personal
experience with food and people with
eating disorders. While male reviewers
may emphasize the comic aspect of
this movie, I personally found it both
serious and tragic.
1 respect Jaglom's intention and
creative format, but found this movie
to be overwhelming. Toward the end,
I became sick of watching women who
were chronically dependent on a par
ticular obsession to center their life
around — whether this obsession be
sex, men or food.
To compare this movie to food
which is pleasurable only in certain
quantities, this movie felt like a binge
that made me want to vomit. However,
I believe my disgust reflected my atti
tude toward society rather than toward
the movie.
I not only recommend the film, but
I think that it is a must-see because it is

enlightening and makes the secret sub
ject of food open and accessible to
conversation.

A slow and
boring dramatic
death
"A Kiss Before Dying," starring
Matt Dillon and Sean Young
"A Kiss Before Dying" is the story of
a poor Ivy League student who com
mits murders in order to become part
of a successful copper company. One
would think that his diploma from the
University of Pennsylvania would have
qualified him for the job, but appar
ently not.
A "thriller" written and directed by
James Dearden — who also directed
"Fatal Attraction" — "A Kiss Before
Dying" promised to create suspense in
the audience, but did not live up to
that promise. I personally laughed at
the "intense" ending because I could
not figure out which character I was
supposed to be nervous for.
The only reason I found for sympa
thizing with the murderous con man
portrayed by Matt Dillon was my
appreciation for his good looks.
However, I could have bought last
month's GQ magazine to do this.
Either Dillon's acting was atrocious
or he brilliantly portrayed an unemo
tional character with no redeeming
qualities. Sean Young is Dillon's inno
cent victim as she somehow manages
to be swept away by this dud. It's too
bad that she didn't play a murderous
con man because her performance as a
politically correct social worker was
even duller than Dillon's.
