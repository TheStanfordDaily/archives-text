# The 						oxymoron of '60s fashion

"Oh, Sarah ... you didn't. They're
so uglyl"
Needless to say, Mom didn't much
approve of the Birkenstocks.
But she doesn't understand. It's not
really that they're ugly, it's just that
they're 50... 50....
Sixties. That's it, they're '60s. And
let's face it, the '60s were ugly. There
were some good things — peace, love,
John Lennon — but it was still an ugly
decade.
4 Julie's'Birkenstocks aren't
the standard brown,
they're a deep (fashion
able) forest green.
In the past 20 years, somebody shot
John Lennon and the political activists
seemed to have turned into middle
aged politically correct environmental
ists. But unfortunately the "fashion" of
the '60s never died.
We're still wearing Birkenstocks.
We're still wearing micro-miniskirts.
Hell, we're still wearing tie-dyes and
you can't tell me they're not ugly.
And it's not just on Telegraph
Avenue either. Everywhere from Syn
ergy to the Suites, the fashion of the
'60s lives on around Stanford.
Take "Ed," for instance. Ed is Stan
ford's home-grown hippie of the '90s
— a "granola." He wears Birkenstocks,
but he doesn't live in them; naturally,
he lives in a co-op. He hails from Col
orado, sports a SEAS mug on the
straps of his North Face backpack and
doesn't eat meat. What Ed does eat is
granola, and lots of it. Grape Nuts, too.
But then there's "Julie." Julie's
Birkenstocks aren't the standard
brown, they're a deep (fashionable)
forest green. Julie wears a headband
that matches her socks perfectly. She
wears wildly patterned leggings, yes,
but only with an expensive shirt in the
same shade of pink. Julie hasn't made
the '60s part of her life like Ed has,
she's made it a part of her wardrobe...
. and only because she read about it in
Cosmo.
And of course there's the professor
who just hasn't had a fashion update in
the last 20 years. Look in the Anthro
pology or Comparative Literature
departments and you'll find several
goateed and sideburned professors

who ask to be called by their first
names.
Like "Grant." Grant teaches semi
nars in rooms that have beanbags
instead of chairs. Grant doesn't mind if
you smoke in class, as long as you
share. He usually wears a Nehru jacket
with horizontal stripes and some verti
cally striped pants. Don't look at him
too closely, it could give you a
headache.
And then there's "Rainbow." Rain
bow grew up in Berkeley, but was too
young to speak full sentences in the

'60s. She's always been a little bitter
about that. She hasn't been the same
since she listened to the soundtrack of
"Hair" and first realized what she had
missed.
Rainbow owns a closet full of long,
flowing flowered skirts, and she likes
to wear them all at once. She pulls back
her long tousled hair with a recycled
headband, doesn't wear any makeup
and always keeps a flower —preferably
a daisy — tucked behind her ear.
Rainbow, of course, wears Birken
stocks. And her mom likes them.
