# The 						old clothes you love to Haight
## 
### Jen Sey Staff writer 
Stop! Don't do it! It's not the
answer you're looking for!
That's right, don't cut holes in your
jeans! I know you want that laid-back,
lived-in look, but it won't work that
way — the clean scissor cuts will give
you away. Besides, you're probably
ruining a perfectly good pair of hole
less jeans.
But don't despair — there is a solu
tion to your problem. If you don't
want jeans that look spanking new,
don't buy jeans spanking new — buy
them used. That's right, eliminate the
years of breaking jeans in, of wearing
them when they're stiff and uncom
fortable. Let someone else endure the
trauma of new, binding, cardboard
like denim trousers while you enjoy
them in the softness and lounge
around comfort of their old age.
If you're in search of this seemingly
unattainable, perfect pair of jeans, the
pair you can just pull on whenever,
skip the Gap and head to a thrift store.
Yep, a good old-fashioned thrift store.
But they're not really so old-fashioned
anymore. Actually, they're darn funky.
At a thrift store, your dream jeans
will not only be the most wearable,
they'll be cheap. Dirt cheap. What a
bonus! Your future (if you don't
already have a pair) favorite, most ver
satile item of clothing will only cost
you about $12.
You say you're not looking for
jeans? You want that beatnik, '60s
throwback look? Or maybe your striv
ing for that Dee-Lite, hot pink
chartreuse, platform-shoes kind of
style? No, you say, the strictly eclectic,
I'll-wear-any th ing-from-bowling
shirts-to-crinolines look is for me.
Well, it's all there. Just head to the
nearest used and restored clothing
store.
Your mother, if she's anything like
mine, probably won't understand why
you'd want to buy clothes with a his
tory. "You don't know who wore that
last," she'll say. "Why would you wear
such a schmata?" Upon entering one
of these havens of retro fashion, she
might whine, "This store smells
funny."
Pay her no mind. Search for those
perfect jeans, that funky retro dress,
that shocking red, burghana coat! Tell
her she should be happy you like such
cheap clothes. Tell her to go to Macy's
to shop for herself.
A warning though: Once you've
decided to embark upon a thrift store
adventure, you must understand that
it's going to take some digging and cre

ativity to come out with what you
want. Things aren't all neatly divided
into sections and sizes and name
brand labels. This isn't Nordstrom's.
You're going to need some patience.
Are you ready to begin the hunt?
Well, the immediate area is dotted with
good, small thrift stores, most of
which are described in helpful detail in
Claudia Tomaso's pocket-sized book,
"Thrift Store Shopping in Your Neigh
borhood."
But I prefer the larger selection
available at stores in the City. San
Francisco is chock full o' thrift stores
to explore. And the Haight District
boasts some of the finest used-clothing
establishments in the country, equal to
those found in Manhattan's Greenwich
Village and Melrose in Los Angeles.
But, before you hit the Haight, let
me recommend my personal favorite
City thriftery: American Rag, at 1305
Van Ness. It's a huge, high-ceilinged
warehouse packed with funky fashion
treasures.
New, and often pricey clothes are
sold in the front but, upon wandering
to the rear of the store, you'll
encounter racks of neatly ironed, clean
but used jeans, tuxedo jackets, over
sized blazers, 1920s vintage formal
wear, overcoats and bowling shirts.
The selection is overwhelming and
you'll have no trouble finding your size

— which can be a problem at some of
the smaller thrift stores. The quality of
the clothes is also exceptional and
everything is cleaned and pressed.
American Rag also features some
creative, though expensive, used and
altered clothing. For example, you can
find Levi's 501s dyed red or green or
painted with stars and stripes. There's
also a rack of chaps-style jeans with
suede fronts in a variety of colors.
As I said, American Rag tends to be
on the more expensive end of the
thrift-store spectrum. leans will cost
you around $25, and a tuxedo jacket
will run you about $60. But, as far as
selection goes, there isn't a better place
around.
Moving into the Haight District,
you'll be bombarded with a plethora of
secondhand stores. My favorite is
Wasteland. Jeans are cheap ($7-$ 12)
and in great condition. Hats are plenti
ful (especially velvet) and 1970s
rayon/polyester shirts are everywhere*.

You can also find furniture, shoes,
boas, sunglasses, petticoats and more.
The prices are very reasonable at
Wasteland and the fountain spewing
red water near the entrance is a must
see.
If it's platform shoes you're search
ing for, go straight to The New Gov
ernment. From hot pink vinyl boots to
lime green glow-in-the-dark heeled
sandals, this is the place to go for early
1970s footwear.
Aardvarks is a thrift store with a
sense of humor.
"Like, are you in a band? Do you
want to look like you are?" says one
sign above a rack of sequined, gold and
silver lam£, obnoxious clothes.
"Hippie wear. Dress the part. Fool
your friends," mocks another sign,
directed at all those poseur Deadheads
out there.
And in addition to the humor,
Aardvarks boasts a tremendous selec
tion of eclectic clothing. You'll find the
tallest green velvet hats you've ever
seen, a rainbow of bowling shirts
sorted by color, bizarre ties with fish
patterns and crinolines with a span of
at least four feet.
Also on Haight Street is Buffalo
Exchange, a thrift store with all the
traditional items. The rack of jeans is
rather skimpy but the store is worth
checking out for the fantastic selection
of men's vests which, as we all know,
are now unisex.
Spellbound offers beautiful vintage
clothing. If you're sick of that lacy
Gunne Sax number you've worn to
every formal since your senior prom,
check this place out.
Well, I've barely scratched the sur
face of thrift store shopping in San
Francisco but, from the stores men
tioned, you should be able to find that
perfect pair of jeans in which to while
away your college days. Don't get dis
couraged if you don't find them right
away. They're out there with your
name on them.
Good luck! Happy shopping!

You're going to need some patience.
Are you ready to begin the hunt?
Well, the immediate area is dotted with
good, small thrift stores, most of
which are described in helpful detail in
Claudia Tomaso's pocket-sized book,
"Thrift Store Shopping in Your Neigh
borhood."
But I prefer the larger selection
available at stores in the City. San
Francisco is chock full o' thrift stores
to explore. And the Haight District
boasts some of the finest used-clothing
establishments in the country, equal to
those found in Manhattan's Greenwich
Village and Melrose in Los Angeles.
But, before you hit the Haight, let
me recommend my personal favorite
City thriftery: American Rag, at 1305
Van Ness. It's a huge, high-ceilinged
warehouse packed with funky fashion
treasures.
New, and often pricey clothes are
sold in the front but, upon wandering
to the rear of the store, you'll
encounter racks of neatly ironed, clean
but used jeans, tuxedo jackets, over
sized blazers, 1920s vintage formal
wear, overcoats and bowling shirts.
The selection is overwhelming and
you'll have no trouble finding your size

— which can be a problem at some of
the smaller thrift stores. The quality of
the clothes is also exceptional and
everything is cleaned and pressed.
American Rag also features some
creative, though expensive, used and
altered clothing. For example, you can
find Levi's 501s dyed red or green or
painted with stars and stripes. There's
also a rack of chaps-style jeans with
suede fronts in a variety of colors.
As I said, American Rag tends to be
on the more expensive end of the
thrift-store spectrum. leans will cost
you around $25, and a tuxedo jacket
will run you about $60. But, as far as
selection goes, there isn't a better place
around.
Moving into the Haight District,
you'll be bombarded with a plethora of
secondhand stores. My favorite is
Wasteland. Jeans are cheap ($7-$ 12)
and in great condition. Hats are plenti
ful (especially velvet) and 1970s
rayon/polyester shirts are everywhere*.

You can also find furniture, shoes,
boas, sunglasses, petticoats and more.
The prices are very reasonable at
Wasteland and the fountain spewing
red water near the entrance is a must
see.
If it's platform shoes you're search
ing for, go straight to The New Gov
ernment. From hot pink vinyl boots to
lime green glow-in-the-dark heeled
sandals, this is the place to go for early
1970s footwear.
Aardvarks is a thrift store with a
sense of humor.
"Like, are you in a band? Do you
want to look like you are?" says one
sign above a rack of sequined, gold and
silver lam£, obnoxious clothes.
"Hippie wear. Dress the part. Fool
your friends," mocks another sign,
directed at all those poseur Deadheads
out there.
And in addition to the humor,
Aardvarks boasts a tremendous selec
tion of eclectic clothing. You'll find the
tallest green velvet hats you've ever
seen, a rainbow of bowling shirts
sorted by color, bizarre ties with fish
patterns and crinolines with a span of
at least four feet.
Also on Haight Street is Buffalo
Exchange, a thrift store with all the
traditional items. The rack of jeans is
rather skimpy but the store is worth
checking out for the fantastic selection
of men's vests which, as we all know,
are now unisex.
Spellbound offers beautiful vintage
clothing. If you're sick of that lacy
Gunne Sax number you've worn to
every formal since your senior prom,
check this place out.
Well, I've barely scratched the sur
face of thrift store shopping in San
Francisco but, from the stores men
tioned, you should be able to find that
perfect pair of jeans in which to while
away your college days. Don't get dis
couraged if you don't find them right
away. They're out there with your
name on them.
Good luck! Happy shopping!

Stop! Don't do it! It's not the
answer you're looking for!
That's right, don't cut holes in your
jeans! I know you want that laid-back,
lived-in look, but it won't work that
way — the clean scissor cuts will give
you away. Besides, you're probably
ruining a perfectly good pair of hole
less jeans.
But don't despair — there is a solu
tion to your problem. If you don't
want jeans that look spanking new,
don't buy jeans spanking new — buy
them used. That's right, eliminate the
years of breaking jeans in, of wearing
them when they're stiff and uncom
fortable. Let someone else endure the
trauma of new, binding, cardboard
like denim trousers while you enjoy
them in the softness and lounge
around comfort of their old age.
If you're in search of this seemingly
unattainable, perfect pair of jeans, the
pair you can just pull on whenever,
skip the Gap and head to a thrift store.
Yep, a good old-fashioned thrift store.
But they're not really so old-fashioned
anymore. Actually, they're darn funky.
At a thrift store, your dream jeans
will not only be the most wearable,
they'll be cheap. Dirt cheap. What a
bonus! Your future (if you don't
already have a pair) favorite, most ver
satile item of clothing will only cost
you about $12.
You say you're not looking for
jeans? You want that beatnik, '60s
throwback look? Or maybe your striv
ing for that Dee-Lite, hot pink
chartreuse, platform-shoes kind of
style? No, you say, the strictly eclectic,
I'll-wear-any th ing-from-bowling
shirts-to-crinolines look is for me.
Well, it's all there. Just head to the
nearest used and restored clothing
store.
Your mother, if she's anything like
mine, probably won't understand why
you'd want to buy clothes with a his
tory. "You don't know who wore that
last," she'll say. "Why would you wear
such a schmata?" Upon entering one
of these havens of retro fashion, she
might whine, "This store smells
funny."
Pay her no mind. Search for those
perfect jeans, that funky retro dress,
that shocking red, burghana coat! Tell
her she should be happy you like such
cheap clothes. Tell her to go to Macy's
to shop for herself.
A warning though: Once you've
decided to embark upon a thrift store
adventure, you must understand that
it's going to take some digging and cre

ativity to come out with what you
want. Things aren't all neatly divided
into sections and sizes and name
brand labels. This isn't Nordstrom's.
