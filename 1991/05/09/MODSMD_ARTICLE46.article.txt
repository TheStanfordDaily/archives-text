Somewhat
modernized,
Macbeth
remains classic
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Macbeth" will be
performed in the Little Theater
at 8 p.m. tonight through Sat
urday and May 16-18.
Before anything is seen in the
murky darkness, the audience hears
blood dripping from the throat of a
slain man.
And the bloodiness pervades the
Drama Department's production of
"Macbeth." Men and women die after
being beaten with pipes and chains —
lending an air of street-fighting to the
drama — but King Duncan is mur
dered with a dagger, in accord with
Shakespeare's original text.
Bruce Evers, appearing courtesy of
Actors' Equity Association, delivers a
very strong performance as Macbeth,
particularly in the scenes with Lady
Macbeth, played by Aleta Hayes. Evers
and Hayes have fantastic energy
together as a lustful, scheming couple.
The Porter of Macbeth's Castle —
the "Hell Porter" — does an excellent
job in his monologue. His drunken
speech about alcohol and equivoca
tion, the latter being a major theme of
the play, elicits laughter from the audi
ence. And his gestures while explaining
that alcohol stimulates one's desire for
sex, but takes away one's ability, pro
vide the audience with welcome comic
relief — particularly after having seen
so much blood.
The sue witches in this production
are dressed as homeless women with
various twitches and speech impedi
ments. They do a good job of seeming
grotesque and confused, while simul
taneously adding a contemporary

sense to the play. While the words they
speak are Shakespeare's, the vagrant
sub-culture they represent is uniquely
a part of our industrialized, capitalist
society.
The Army surplus-style costumes
might seem inappropriately modern,
especially since the dialogue has not
been updated to match the costumes,
but the military garb worn throughout
the play accurately conveys the idea
that men such as Macbeth and Mac
duff fight constantly. Their lives are
defined by military battles and accom
plishments. These men also don com
bat boots and gray, waterproof tarps
which resemble capes.
Short, simple, contemporary
dresses are worn by Lady Macbeth and
Lady Macduff, the former's black and
the latter's white; the contrasting col
ors perhaps reflect the states of their
souls.
The sound designer, Karen Weitz
man, does an excellent job sampling
appropriate pieces of music to convey
the moods of different scenes. After
Banquo is murdered by Macbeth's
hired hands, a cut of Sinead O'Con
nor's music with a steady, aggressive
drum beat returns the audience to the
banquet scene with Macbeth's halluci
nation.

Chamber
Chorale bursting
with song, talent
The Stanford Chamber Chorale
will perform in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium this Sunday, May
12 at 2:30 p.m.
The Stanford Chorale? Isn't that
Donald Kennedy's version of the Rea
gan ranch?
Thankfully, most Stanford students
now know that it's not. Largely due to

the success of its sell-out Broadway
musical revue, "Murder at the Broad
way Cafe," this highly talented vocal
ensemble has finally begun to receive
the attention it deserves.
The Chorale is composed of 36
voices, ranging from freshmen to doc
toral students. That's fairly small for a
chamber choir, but the talent of those
voices more than makes up for the size
of the group.
Members of the Chorale include
Carolyn Shapiro, composer, director
and actress (Little Red Riding Hood in
"Into the Woods"); Kathye Boline and
Ben Evans, Ram's Head's most recog
nizable couple (Adam and Eve from
"One Bad Apple," Cinderella and Cin
derella's Prince from "Into the
Woods"); Debbie Wicks, writer and
composer ("One Bad Apple"); and
Illana Zauderer, actress (God in "One
Bad Apple" and the Witch from "Into
the Woods").
If that wasn't enough, the Chorale
also boasts the names of Julie Hunt,
the lead soprano from the Music
Department's recent production of

appearances and on numerous record
ings.
The upcoming Chorale perfor
mance, which will be held on Sunday,
May 12, at 2:30 p.m., promises to be
particularly unique. Each of four doc
toral candidates in choral conducting
— Alan Baker, Rafael Ornes, Michael
Rosewall and Stephen Sano — will
conduct a set of pieces that each indi
vidually chose. Thus, there should be
an interesting mix of styles and selec
tions.
But the Chorale can, no doubt,
handle it.

Mozart's "The Magic Flute"; Dr. Perry
Cook, inventor of the synthesized
voice; and Fleet Street Singers Micah
Friedman, Kevin Bleyer, Scot Gibson,
Bill Grundy and Grey Norton. The list
goes on and on.
Clearly, only a talented leader could
head such a talented group, and Dr.
William Ramsey, director of choral
activities at Stanford, is just that. An
accomplished baritone, Ramsey has
recorded with such musical greats as
Leonard Bernstein and Igor Stravinsky
and has performed as a soloist in
Carnegie Hall.
Since receiving his doctoral degree

at Columbia University in 1963, Ram
sey has taught at Utah State University,
Kentucky Southern College, the Uni
versity of Kentucky and Harvard Uni
versity.
Obviously the abilities of the
Chorale has led to its growing reputa
tion in musical circles. Just as helpful,
however, is the fact that several famous
composers, such as Randall Thomp
son and Kirke Meechem, have com
posed works especially for the group.
The Chorale performed these pre
miere pieces during tours of Israel and
Europe, on radio and television
