Her Blue Body Everything We Know: Earthling poems
1965-1990 complete

In 1965, Alice Walker did not believe she would live to
write poetry for 25 more years.
linding fault in both herself and the world around her,
Walker assumed, in her younger years, that she would com
mit suicide by the age of 30. But fortunately, with passing
years, acceptance and serenity came to the insightful poet
and novelist. And in "Her Blue Body Everything We Know,"
Walker grants us insight into the psychological and spiritual
development that shaped her literary career.
More than a mere anthology, "Her Blue Body" traces
Walkers spiritual journey over three decades, chronicling
the turbulent and painful episodes in her life as well as pro
viding her insightful and often critical thoughts on world
events.
The Pulitzer Prize winning author of "The Color Pur
ple and 'The Temple of My Familiar" views her life as a
jeweler would a precious stone. She holds the world care
fully up to the light, peering into its depths and scrutinizing
its details, at once mesmerized by its beauty and disturbed
by its deep flaws.
Walker's masterful poetry is at once intensely personal
and startlingly universal. She draws insightful generalities
from specific, isolated incidents and draws on everyday
activities to point out the sublime.
Although each poem is moving on its own, "Her Blue
Body" is best appreciated when read from start to finish, for
each piece is best understood within the context of other
poems from the same time period. The book was carefully
divided into sections by Walker herself and by reading them
in sequence, one can trace the author's evolving conscious
ness and spirituality.
Beginning with a summer spent in Past Africa during
college, Walker takes the reader back to the United States
and the turbulent, racially segregated south; she provides

glimpses of her childhood in Mississippi and then moves
forward to capture the turmoil of her emerging sexuality
and political consciousness.
One is struck by the freshness of Walker's writing during
the earliest period, which provides an interesting and
insightful contrast to her later and more mature work. The
clarity and wonder of her inquisitive young mind are evi
dent in these pieces, most of which are quite brief.
In 1978, Walker moved from New York — where she felt
cramped creatively — to Northern California, a decision
she considers one of the best she ever made. During this
time period, her poems acquire a new sense of serenity; she
grows to accept herself and her heritage, and becomes more
attuned — as a woman — to her connection with nature.
She mourns the abuse of the earth and the exploitation
of its people in poems such as "We Have A Beautiful
Mother," which contains the title phrase:
"We have a beautiful
mother
Her green lap
immense
Her brown embrace
eternal
Her blue body
everything
we know."
Particularly in those pieces exploring women's spiritual
ity and sexuality, the reader will find herself eagerly absorb
ing each word; struck by the familiarity of feeling in poems
such as "Did this happen to your mother? Did your sister
throw up a lot?" and "On Stripping Bark From Myself."
Walker's own growing realization of the universality of
women's experience is evidenced in poems such as "At
First," which begins with "At first I did not fight it. 1 loved
the suffering./It was being alive!" and concludes with:
It was my friend Gloria
who saved me. Whose glance said "Really,
you've got to be kidding. Other
women have already done this
sort of suffering for you,
or so I thought."
