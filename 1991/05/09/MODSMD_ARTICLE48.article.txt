"The Gods of Winter"
By Dana Gioia

Not so long ago, Dana Gioia was a Stanford
student and a book reviewer for The Stanford
Daily. Today, not surprisingly, he is a remark
ably successful executive at a large corporation
and has been named one of Esquire magazine's
"Men and Women Under 40 Who Are Chang
ing America." A little more unusual, however, is
the fact that Gioia has a successful second
career as a poet, biographer and poetic transla
tor.

Gioia has just released his second book of
poetry, "The Gods of Winter," an intensely per
sonal work dealing primarily with the death.of
his young son.
Throughout the first section of the book,
Gioia explores issues such as the agony of loss,
the inevitability of death and the life of the
soul. He uses environmental symbols to convey
the disintegration and regrowth not only of his
own life, but also of the natural world as it
exists today.
The conclusion of this section, however,
does not leave the reader with the dismal weari
ness such pain often inspires. Instead, Gioia
offers "Planting A Sequoia": a poetic testament
to his son's spirit in which the roots of the

the life of the soul.
growing tree are intertwined with a lock of the
child's hair. The sequoia symbolizes the tri
umph of life — not death — over the human
spirit. As the tree begins to grow, the author
commands it "to stand among strangers, all

young and ephemeral to you,/ Silently keeping
the secret of your birth." This is Gioia's way of
keeping his son's memory alive.
The rest of the collection, while not as
focused as the first section, contains many
moving pieces expressing the confusion of
growing older and losing one's ideals. Some of
the poems, such as "Counting the Children"
and"The Homecoming" are longer, story-like
tales which reveal philosophical insight
through seemingly insignificant events.
In "Counting the Children," the poet shows
his love and despair toward humanity:
There is no tabula rasa for the soul.
Each spirit, be it infant, bird or flower,

Comes to the world perfected and complete,
And only time proves its unraveling.
The entire collection reflects this outlook: a
desire to celebrate the human soul while recog
nizing its inevitable degradation. He writes of
poetic inspiration, natural settings, lost love,
life and death.
Overall, Gioia's second poetic attempt is
wonderfully refined and beautiful in its expres
sions. His command of words and rhythm
gives aesthetic value to his otherwise complex
philosophical themes. "The Gods of Winter" is
pleasing proof that corporate executives can
reach beyond the world of money and power
lunches to express valuable artistic truths.
