# Metaphysical and material pleasures
## Buy your beads and baubles at a breeding ground for beatniks 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld 
Soothing New Age music plays in the background; a
faint smell of incense lingers in the air. Mandalas, tie-dyed
T-shirts and Native American sweet medicine feathers hang
from the walls. Earrings shaped like peace signs and ankle
bracelets from India sit side by side in a display case. Shells,
fossils, malachite eggs and crystals — each one unique —
are on display on a table.
You might expect a store like this to be in San Francisco,
or Berkeley. But Earthly Delights, a shop that caters to both
your physical comfort and your metaphysical well-being, is
right here in Palo Alto, and marks a distinct departure from
most of the other neighborhood establishments.
The small gift shop on California Avenue is wedged
between a pizzeria and a carpet store and is hidden behind
a fir tree. You could drive right by it and never know it's
there. But take the time to find it; otherwise, you'll miss out
on a trip to the past and a look at the future.
Earthly Delights opened last November, as a response to
society's abandonment of the cutthroat spirit of the '80s,
and return to the spiritual values of the '60s and '70s, says
Court Tefft, the store's manager and co-owner.
Across the country, and particularly in California, peo
ple have become concerned about the impact mankind is
having on nature. More and more individuals are trying to
become attuned to the Earth; some choose to do this
through the use of crystals, believing that their "piezoelec
tric" action will affect living creatures.
Tefft himself always carries at least one crystal and enjoys

talking about them. He'll patiently describe how you should
attune your crystal to yourself to amplify your aura and
focus your energies.
According to Tefft, running the crystal under warm
water and cleaning it is a necessary preliminary step. Then,
you must imagine all the negativity flowing out. Finally, you
charge it with your positive energies and make it into your
personal amulet.
Even if you don't believe that crystals can interact with
people electromagnetically, chances are you'll be charmed
by the hand-crafted folk art at Earthly Delights.
Shannon Dominick, a high school senior visiting Stan
ford from Houston, Texas, says she was "attracted by the
variety, the small glass things, the little trinkets." However,
she was just as attracted to the store's "mystical, magical"
atmosphere.
This atmosphere adds to the sense that Earthly Delights
is more than a store; it's a social place where people can talk
about the significance of the pyramid on the one dollar bill,
Buddhism, Emerson and Thoreau. It's a place where the
managers and owners have the time and patience to share
their knowledge.
As a self-defined "product of the '605," Tefft finds it dif
ficult to accept God as a "judgmental, old, bearded man."
Like many others today, he tried to find an alternative to
this ideal. "This is the age of Aquarius where everyone must
create his own reality," says Tefft. Earthly Delights is his real
ity.
And it can be yours as well.
