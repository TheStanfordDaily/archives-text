# Looming in 1992-93:
## Millions more in budget cuts 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Once Stanford emerges from
the two-year budgetary storm cre
ated by the indirect-cost contro
versy, it will face yet another
daunting financial challenge: the
permanent removal of at least
another $22 million from the Uni
versity's operating budget.
That assessment was offered
by University President Donald
Kennedy in an interview yester
day afternoon.
A month ago, Provost James
Rosse warned the Faculty Senate
that the operating budget for
1992-93 would be "substantially
reduced." Kennedy's comments
yesterday represent the first time
an administrator has publicly

associated a dollar magnitude
with the impending cuts.
Kennedy indicated that the
upcoming budget reduction would
likely exceed that of the Univer
sity's $22 million "repositioning"
effort that began last February.
The cuts coming in 1992-93
will likely be "of that magnitude
or somewhat larger," Kennedy
said. He added that his assess
ment was "probably more opti
mistic than most."
"I tern 1 to be that way," he said.
The $22 million in permanent
reductions announced last Febru
ary were intended to produce bal
anced operating budgets this year
and in years to come. But finan
cial fallout from the indirect-cost
controversy, along with lower
than-projected research volume
and lower interest rates, have
shattered that scenario.
Rosse announced last week
that the University faces short
falls of $20 million this year and
$30 million next year, due largely
to the Navy's recent decision to
temporarily reduce the amount of
indirect-cost recovery Stanford
receives on federal research con
tracts.
The University will absorb
some of that shock through the
use of its vast reserves, but Rosse
unveiled actions last week that
will reduce planned expenditures
by close to $10 million in the
remaining four months of this fis
cal year and by $15 million next
year.
Those cuts are one-time reduc
tions, however, and will have no
effect on balancing future years'
budgets.
Unlike the "repositioning"
effort, the next round of perma
nent cuts will include reduction —
and possible elimination — of aca

demic programs.
Last month, Rosse indicated
that interdisciplinary programs
would come under heavy scrutiny.
But Kennedy suggested yesterday
that the future of these programs
might be more secure than previ
ously thought.
"As I look at the tea leaves, I
don't see a lot of savings there,"
he said. Programs such as Human
Biology and American Studies are
both strong academically and very
popular, Kennedy said. And "they
do it at bargain rates," he said,
since most of the faculty in these
programs hold positions in other
departments.
"If you were to knock them off,
you wouldn't save a hell of a lot,"
Kennedy said.
He added that he was only
offering a "top-of-the-head view of
the matter." The recently formed
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning, chaired by Rosse, is
examining these matters much
more closely, Kennedy said.
The University's operating
budget is close to $400 million.
The Faculty Senate has sched
uled a special meeting today to
discuss issues related to the Uni
versity's operating budget.
