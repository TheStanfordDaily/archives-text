# Mr. Bill goes to Washington
## 
### Amy McConnell Staff writer 
The stage is dark. Suddenly, a single light appears, cut
ting through the darkness to reveal a small, sad-looking Bill
huddled in the corner.
But this isn't just any bill; this is a Bill on Capitol Hill.
Bill More, a senior in electrical engineering, has been
"The Bill" ever since Fleet Street Singers first began singing
Schoolhouse Rock tunes two years ago.
"When they arranged Schoolhouse Rock, I guess they
had me in mind because my name's Bill," he suggests.

Perhaps.
But just between you
and me, I don't think that's
the real reason. Just look at
his face ... he's a perfect
Bill. As More himself puts
it, he fits "the pathos of the
part." He's shy. He's goofy.
And he's always been so.
He's not quite a law,
just a humble bill. But
underneath that quiet
veneer you can detect the
makings of a big, flashy
law.
"There's one part where
Bill sees himself becoming
a law," More says of the
cartoon. "He slaps a badge
on himself; he's all radiant
and transfigured; there's a
burst of color, but then it's
back to reality. He's back
on the stairs, talking to a
little kid. The kid asks him,
'What's the matter?'" To
which Bill responds:
"I'm just a bill,
Yes I'm only a bill,
And I'm sitting here
on Capitol Hill.
Well it's a long, long
journey to that capi
tol city,
A long, long way while
you're sitting in
committee;
But I know I'll be a law
someday,
Yea, I hope and pray
that I will

But today I am still just a bill."
"There's something about the Bill song that people
really like," More says.
And that's clearly an understatement — the first time
Fleet Street sang Schoolhouse Rock, he only got as far as
"I'm just a bill," before the audience started roaring. Fleet
Street even has a tape where you can't hear More at all
"because the audience is so loud."
More has become known around campus as "the bill
guy," so much so that people "stop me in the Quad and sing
the song to me," he says.
And how does he feel about this recognition?
"I love it!" he exclaims without hesitation.

'There's one part where Bill sees himself
becoming a law. He slaps a badge on
himself; he's all radiant and transfigured;
there's a burst of color, but then it's back
to reality,
More said he feels lucky, even luckier than Fleet Street's
Tom Smith, whose role in the song is to demonstrate the
meaning of nouns. After the group sings, "And everything

that you can show," Smith
grins mischievously and
sings, "I.ike your butt."
Needless to say, Smith
has been introduced more
than once as "the butt
man."
Although Fleet Street
has been singing School
house Rock for only two
years, they sing it so often
that "it seems we've been
doing it forever," More
said. And every time, he
gets the same part.
"I tend to do it the same
way each time," More said.
"I get into a rut. Last year,
two girls in my dorm
memorized it and did it
exactly the way I do. That
was embarrassing, so I
tried to change it after
that."
But why change? After
all, More is the quintessen
tial bill with a long, long
journey ahead.
And the journey is not
toward law school.
Did you think it might
be?
No, More's goal is to
learn more about elec
tronic instruments —
"synthesizers and other
devices." Meanwhile, he'll
plug away at electrical engi
neering.
Does that seem strange?
An electrical engineer who

sings? __
"Five of the members of Fleet Street were EE majors
when I was a freshman," More said. "I guess you can sort of
see it as complementary - the life of an engineer and the life
of a Fleet Street singer... it's sort of yin and yang."
And speaking of yin and yang, "1 think there's a little bit
of Bill in all of us," More said with a bashful smile.
Can we quote him on that?
"I was hoping you would."
Mores too shy to say it, but he loves recognition. Yes,
he's definitely a bill. Not just a Bill, but a Bill on Capitol Hill.

"I tend to do it the same
way each time," More said.
"I get into a rut. Last year,
two girls in my dorm
memorized it and did it
exactly the way I do. That
was embarrassing, so I
tried to change it after
that."
But why change? After
all, More is the quintessen
tial bill with a long, long
journey ahead.
And the journey is not
toward law school.
Did you think it might
be?
No, More's goal is to
learn more about elec
tronic instruments —
"synthesizers and other
devices." Meanwhile, he'll
plug away at electrical engi
neering.
Does that seem strange?
An electrical engineer who

sings? __
"Five of the members of Fleet Street were EE majors
when I was a freshman," More said. "I guess you can sort of
see it as complementary - the life of an engineer and the life
of a Fleet Street singer... it's sort of yin and yang."
And speaking of yin and yang, "1 think there's a little bit
of Bill in all of us," More said with a bashful smile.
Can we quote him on that?
"I was hoping you would."
Mores too shy to say it, but he loves recognition. Yes,
he's definitely a bill. Not just a Bill, but a Bill on Capitol Hill.


AJ Green — Daily
Is it the face or just the name that makes senior Bill More
the quintessential Bill on Capitol Hill?
