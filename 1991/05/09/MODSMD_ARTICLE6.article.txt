# Stanford writes U.S. check for $924,517
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
On the eve of another indirect
cost hearing by Rep. John Dingell,
Stanford hand-delivered a check
for $924,517 to government offi
cials in Washington yesterday.
The check, made out to the U.S.
Treasury, reflects expenses that
the University had originally
included in its indirect-cost recov

ery claims but subsequently with
drew upon scrutiny by the Michi
gan Democrat's House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations.
Included in the refund are
$533,328 in costs Stanford volun
tarily removed but maintains are
legally allowable charges. Most of
the expenses that fall into this cat
egory are associated with the Uni
versity-owned residences of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and other Stanford officials.
In January, University admin
istrators decided some of these
expenses — such as flower
arrangements and antiques at
Lou Henry Hoover House — were
too difficult to justify to the public
as indirect costs of federal
research.
The money returned yesterday
also compensates the government
for several Stanford accounting
errors from the past decade,
including $184,285 in deprecia
tion on the yacht Victoria and
other athletic equipment and
$162,760 in administrative costs
of the Stanford Shopping Center.
Both sets of expenses had been
erroneously charged to the gov
ernment as indirect costs of

research.
Under normal practice, accoun
ting errors by either the govern
ment or a university are corrected
through "adjusting the carryfor
ward" — that is, crediting or
deducting the amount from
future reimbursements from fed
eral granting agencies.
But two weeks ago, officials
from the Defense Contract Audit
Agency suggested Stanford pay by
check to the U.S. Treasury,
according to Larry Horton, Stan
ford's associate vice president for
public affairs.
After discussing several techni
calities with federal officials,
Stanford agreed to the procedure.
A May 5 letter from University
Counsel Debra Zumwalt to federal
officials states that Stanford con
siders the move a "special accom
modation to the government" and
that the University will agree to
such a procedure only on "a one
time basis."
The presentation of the check
to federal officials came one day
before today's hearing by Dingell

on the way research universities
charge the government for indi
rect costs of research. Stanford's
practices were the subject of a
punishing seven-hour Dingell
hearing in March.
Stanford officials have not been
invited to testify at today's pro
ceeding, but several Stanford
related issues are expected to
arise. Dingell has requested an
update from federal auditors on
their recent allegations about
access-to-information problems at
Stanford.
Yesterday the University re
leased a six-page report from
Zumwalt to Kennedy that
concluded "Stanford has not
improperly denied [federal audi
tors] access to any information."
The report was apparently
prompted by the testimony of a
federal auditor at a hearing by the
House Science Subcommittee last
month. Fred Newton, deputy
director of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, alleged that Stan
ford was "certainly at the far end

of the spectrum" in being uncoop
erative with federal auditors.
Zumwalt's report notes that
Stanford "does have a substantial
backlog of requests from DCAA"
due to its "effort to accelerate
years of auditing into a few
months."
According to Zumwalt, Stan
ford has produced more than
38,000 pages of University docu
ments to federal auditors and
investigators since October.
The report also claims the pro
cess has been hindered by the
nature of some audit requests.
"Many of them require significant
efforts over minuscule sums of
money," Zumwalt writes, "for
example, a 42-cent phone call or a
$10 charge for coffee at a meet
ing."
Also, according to Zumwalt,
audit officials have not prioritized
their requests. "Therefore, a
major request could be blocked
pending the resolution of a rela
tively insignificant inquiry such
as what a dishwasher is used for."
