# Stanford Filipinos feel forgotten
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
On display in the bookcase of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center is a book called "Filipinos:
The Forgotten Asian-Americans."
And indeed, Filipino-Americans seem to be for
gotten at Stanford.
Filipino-Americans constitute the largest
Asian-American ethnic group in California and
one of the largest in United States. But at Stan
ford, Filipino-Americans are one of the smallest
Asian-American groups.
"In every other school the Filipino association
is probably the most powerful (of the Asian-Amer
ican groups) and they all have separate cultural
nights. But here we are so small we are unable to
put on such a function," freshman Ernie Sibal
said.
"It's really difficult to build a sense of commu
nity here when there are so few of us," he added,
saying there are maybe a dozen members who
regularly attend Stanford Filipino Association
events or dance in the folk-dance group.

Stanford does not have an official figure of the
number of Filipino-American students here,
because the Office of Undergraduate Admissions
only counts Chinese- and Japanese-Americans
within the Asian-American community.
"The thing that bothers me most is that [Stan
ford is] blowing their trumpets of diversity, but in
reality nothing is changing in the Asian-American
community," said recent Stanford graduate Brett
Sevilla, a Filipino-American. "The absolute num
ber is growing, but the makeup of that commu
nity is not changing — it is not becoming more
diverse."
Elsa Tsutaoka, office manager for the Asian
American Activities Center, said one of the ways
the small Filipino-American community here dif
fers from other Asian-American groups is that it
"naturally gravitates to look at issues such as
admissions."
Many other Asian-American groups concen
trate more on planning cultural and social events
than on addressing issues facing their specific

communities, she said.
Sevilla said the notion among
other Asians that "Filipinos
aren't really Asians" heightens
these differences. "It's very dis
turbing — at times there's this
perception that Filipino-Ameri
cans are second-class Asians."
He added that he believes eco
nomics is one reason the Stanford
Filipino-American community is
small.
"Many Filipino-Americans
cannot afford to come here, and
even if they could, Stanford has
this ivory-tower image" that
scares them away, Sevilla said.
In addition, some say many
Filipino-Americans have not had
the same advantages in high
school as people of other cultures.
Asst. Director of Undergradu
ate Admissions Cecilia Evange
lista, a Filipino-American who
graduated from Stanford in 1988,
said the lack of good student
counseling in high school is a
problem.
"Stanford is looking at the top
applicants coming out of high
school. Many groups, including
Filipino-Americans, have tradi
tionally not had great access to
student counseling. No one was

there saying 'You have to take
these classes and on top of that
you have to be in all these
extracurricular activities,' " she
said.
Tsutaoka said, "I don't think
it's as easy for Filipino-Americans
to fulfill the criteria to get into
Stanford."
"Many of them have to work
all the time, and so they don't
have the vast array of extracurric
ular activities."
Cultural differences between
Filipino-Americans and other
Asian-Americans are also often
cited as a reason for the disparity
in Filipino-Americans' represen
tation at Stanford.
"Filipino-Americans are not as
much a work-oriented group like
the Chinese. Education is not as
high up in Filipino culture as it is
in the Chinese culture," Sibal
said.
In light of these reasons, the
Stanford Filipino Association has
tried to encourage the Admissions
Office to make a stronger effort to
admit more Filipino-Americans
and has asked the office specifi
cally, although unsuccessfully, to
declare them a targeted minority
like blacks and Chicano/Latinos.
To help with the admissions
effort, the Stanford group visited
two Bay Area high schools with
large Filipino-American popula
tions during fall quarter.
