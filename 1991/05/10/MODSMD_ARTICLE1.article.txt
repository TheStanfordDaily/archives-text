# Two-year shortfall will hit $95 million
## 
### John Wagner Senior Staff writer 
Painting a much broader and much
bleaker picture of Stanford's financial crisis
than just a week ago, Provost James Rosse
said yesterday that the University would
use about $70 million in reserves to help
weather a combined $95 million shortfall in
this year's and next year's operating bud
gets.
Rosse, in an appearance before a special
session of the Faculty Senate, also predicted
the University would need to permanently
reduce its $400 million operating budget by
about 10 percent in 1992-93 — a task that
will involve cuts in academic programs and
a re-evaluation of the University's priori
ties.
"We may not do everything in the new
world that we do in the old world," Rosse
said during a candid question-and-answer
session with faculty members. "But I do
think we will be excellent at what we do."
Last week, Rosse told the senate that the

Medical School was facing a two-year short
fall of $23 million, while revenue projec
tions for the rest of the University were
likely to fall $50 million short during the
same period.
The $95 million shortfall figure that
emerged yesterday includes both those
numbers but also takes into account other
financial fallout from Stanford's ongoing
indirect-cost controversy, including:
• Paying the lawyers, media consultants,
accountants and temporary help the Uni
versity has hired since the federal investi
gations got underway last fall, and
• Having to pay a higher percentage of
costs associated with the University's "ser
vice centers" — the Stanford Data Center,
the University phone system and various
operations and maintenance shops.
Several accounting agreements that
spelled out how much of these services the
government would pay to support federal
research at Stanford were terminated bv
