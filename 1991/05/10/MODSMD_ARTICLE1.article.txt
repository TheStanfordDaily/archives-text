# Two-year shortfall will hit $95 million
## 
### John Wagner Senior Staff writer 
Painting a much broader and much
bleaker picture of Stanford's financial crisis
than just a week ago, Provost James Rosse
said yesterday that the University would
use about $70 million in reserves to help
weather a combined $95 million shortfall in
this year's and next year's operating bud
gets.
Rosse, in an appearance before a special
session of the Faculty Senate, also predicted
the University would need to permanently
reduce its $400 million operating budget by
about 10 percent in 1992-93 — a task that
will involve cuts in academic programs and
a re-evaluation of the University's priori
ties.
"We may not do everything in the new
world that we do in the old world," Rosse
said during a candid question-and-answer
session with faculty members. "But I do
think we will be excellent at what we do."
Last week, Rosse told the senate that the

Medical School was facing a two-year short
fall of $23 million, while revenue projec
tions for the rest of the University were
likely to fall $50 million short during the
same period.
The $95 million shortfall figure that
emerged yesterday includes both those
numbers but also takes into account other
financial fallout from Stanford's ongoing
indirect-cost controversy, including:
• Paying the lawyers, media consultants,
accountants and temporary help the Uni
versity has hired since the federal investi
gations got underway last fall, and
• Having to pay a higher percentage of
costs associated with the University's "ser
vice centers" — the Stanford Data Center,
the University phone system and various
operations and maintenance shops.
Several accounting agreements that
spelled out how much of these services the
government would pay to support federal
research at Stanford were terminated bv

the Navy two weeks ago. Conse
quently, Stanford has had to
revert to government "default"
formulas which yield lower gov
ernment shares of these costs.
Rosse announced yesterday
that the impending budget short
falls would force the University to
spend about $70 million of its
reserves, a substantial fraction of
a reserve pool that he estimated
contains "well over" $100 million.
These funds are currently
invested and yield an annual pay
out of nearly 5 percent, Rosse
said.
The remaining $25 million of
the two-year shortfall will be cov
ered by various measures
announced last week, including a
six-month delay in annual faculty
salary and staff salary increases
and a near-freeze in faculty hir
ing.

Several senate members,
including English Prof. George
Dekker, voiced concerns yester
day about salary holdbacks.
"There is very widespread unhap
piness about this proposal,"
Dekker said. He suggested that
the faculty would be more sup
portive of the entire budget
reduction process if the salary
issue were reconsidered.
Rosse noted that the final deci
sion about the faculty salary plan
rests with the Board of Trustees.
But he said he doubted they
would accept a more generous
plan.
The $40 million permanent
reduction to the operating budget
Rosse is predicting for 1992-93
would be nearly twice as large as
the University's last round of per
manent budget cuts — the $22
million "repositioning" effort
announced in February 1990.
The current financial crisis
results largely from the recent
decision by the Navy to cut the
amount of overhead, or indirect

costs, Stanford can charge the
government on federally spon
sored research grants.
Indirect-cost recovery
accounts for almost 30 percent of

the University's operating bud
get.
Until two weeks ago, Stanford
had a provisional indirect-cost
rate of 70 percent. After weeks of
negotiations between the Univer
sity and the Navy failed to pro
duce an agreement, the Navy uni
laterally imposed a rate of 55.5
percent.
It is unclear how long Stanford
will have to operate under the
lower rate and how much higher
it might be in future years. Con
sequently, Rosse said, his projec
tions were subject to a great deal
of change.
"You need to understand these
are estimates," Rosse said.
"There are substantial uncertain
ties even with respect to the cur
rent year."
The shortfall estimates for this
year and next year could be as
much as $8 million too high or too
low, he said. The reduction to the
budget base in 1992-93 could be
off by $15 million in either direc
tion, Rosse said.
