# All-freshman vs. four-class housing
## Residents of both say each format has advantages, drawbacks 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
"We're going to throw a good death-of-
Trancos party at the end of the year to cele
brate the last exiting class of all freshmen,"
current Trancos resident Josh Ross said last
month.
True to his word, Trancos residents dressed
in black and mourned the "death" of their all
freshman dormitory at a farewell party last
weekend.
Another Trancos resident at the party,
Alfred Lee, said he really enjoyed being a part
of the dormitory this past year and "can't pic
ture what [Trancos] would be like being a
four-class dorm."
Trancos, an all-freshman house in Wilbur,
will become a four-class house next year to
keep the ratio of freshmen to upperclassmen
in all dormitories the same after Kimball Hall
is opened. Kimball will house 50 freshmen.
Some Trancos residents were disappointed
at the move and cited many benefits of all
freshman dormitories. They say all-freshman
houses allow for a greater sense of community,
more bonding, more enthusiasm and more
fun. But with these aspects come noise, stum
bling through the first year of school with peo
ple who also don't know what they're getting
into and an environment that is often more
conducive to parties than studies.
Trancos resident assistant David Chang, a
senior, favors the all-freshman experience. He
said, "I think it's really too bad" that there will
be less of an opportunity for entering students
to spend their first year in an all-freshman
environment because of the change at Tran
cos.
Many people who have lived in all-freshman
houses said they enjoyed their experience and
would do it all again.

Freshman Rich Barnett, who currently
lives in four-class Faisan, said he would choose
to live in an all-freshman dormitory if he had a
second chance. In all-freshman houses stu
dents have more of a chance to make friends
for life, he said.

'All-frosh dorms definitely
have a tighter community. You
share the same experience
with more people.'

Some students say they prefer all-fresh man
residences because first-year students start
out in the same situation and have no other
ties with friends in other dormitories or to
extracurricular activities.
Sophomore Kelly Ramirez, who lived in
Donner, an all-freshman house in Stern Hall,
last year, put it this way: "All-frosh dorms def
initely have a tighter community. You share
the same experience with more people. There
are not people in the dorm who already have
lives outside the dorm. It's not already
diluted."
Among students who lived in four-class
houses their freshman year, opinions are a lit
tle more diverse.
Some said they wish they had a different
experience and that having upperclassmen
around was not helpful during their freshman
year. They said upperclassmen have their own
Draw groups and tend to be antisocial, while
residents of all-freshman dormitories seemed
to have a lot more energy, fun and unity.
Eugene Koh, a sophomore who lived in Uja

maa last year, said upperclassmen there were
often "busy with their own friends."
But students who said they enjoyed four
class houses claimed that they can get more
work done and that upperclassmen helped
them choose classes and gave them a more
complete picture of the various activities avail
able at Stanford.
Ryokei Imai said the highlight of living in a
four-class house his freshman year was the
invaluable advice that he was given by sopho
mores, juniors and seniors.
Dave Hsu, a junior, said he received help
from upperclassmen in his dormitory for his
electrical engineering classes. He also made a
lot of older friends because they had similar
interests, like playing volleyball.
All-freshmen dormitories do provide some
of these benefits through RAs who are usually
juniors or seniors. But budget cuts call for a
reduction of the residential staff to three RAs
in dormitories which have traditionally had
four. Many students said they feel this will
have a somewhat negative impact on residen
tial life.
It will affect the size of the activities RAs
can plan and execute, they said.
Having more RAs also allowed the house to
enjoy the different ideas, programs and leader
ship styles each has to offer. Moreover, stu
dents will have less of a chance to find an RA
with a personality similar to theirs, especially
one who can understand and interact closely
with them, Ramirez and Barnett said.
Currently 55 percent of freshmen live in all
freshman dormitories and 45 percent reside in
four-class houses. Each year, more students
request to be in all-freshman houses than are
spaces available, said Director of Housing
Rodger Whitney. And with one fewer all-fresh
man house, next year it is likely that even
more requests will be denied.

Ryokei Imai said the highlight of living in a
four-class house his freshman year was the
invaluable advice that he was given by sopho
mores, juniors and seniors.
Dave Hsu, a junior, said he received help
from upperclassmen in his dormitory for his
electrical engineering classes. He also made a
lot of older friends because they had similar
interests, like playing volleyball.
All-freshmen dormitories do provide some
of these benefits through RAs who are usually
juniors or seniors. But budget cuts call for a
reduction of the residential staff to three RAs
in dormitories which have traditionally had
four. Many students said they feel this will
have a somewhat negative impact on residen
tial life.
It will affect the size of the activities RAs
can plan and execute, they said.
Having more RAs also allowed the house to
enjoy the different ideas, programs and leader
ship styles each has to offer. Moreover, stu
dents will have less of a chance to find an RA
with a personality similar to theirs, especially
one who can understand and interact closely
with them, Ramirez and Barnett said.
Currently 55 percent of freshmen live in all
freshman dormitories and 45 percent reside in
four-class houses. Each year, more students
request to be in all-freshman houses than are
spaces available, said Director of Housing
Rodger Whitney. And with one fewer all-fresh
man house, next year it is likely that even
more requests will be denied.
