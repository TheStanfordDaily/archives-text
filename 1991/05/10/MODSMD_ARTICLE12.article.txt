took a dose of radioactive iodine yesterday to
begin bringing his overactive thyroid under
control and doctors said his health could be
fully restored within a matter of weeks.
Bush was diagnosed as having Graves' dis
ease, a common thyroid condition that also
afflicts his wife Barbara and doctors at
Bethesda Naval Center immediately prescribed
the radioactive iodine.
Dr. Burton Lee, the White House physician,
said the president's schedule may be eased next
week to help him recover.
An estimated seven million Americans suf
fer thyroid problems, with about one million

Rape charges filed against
William Kennedy Smith
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - William
Kennedy Smith was charged with rape yester
day, nearly six weeks after a 29-year-old woman
reported he attacked her at the Kennedy fam
ily's seaside estate.
State Attorney David Bludworth said a war
rant had been issued for Smith's arrest, and
police said the 30-year-old Georgetown Univer
sity medical student was expected to surrender
early next week.
Bludworth's announcement before more
than 100 reporters capped weeks of specula
tion and controversy in the United States and
overseas.
The intense interest has been driven in part
by the fact that Smith was with his uncle, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and the senator's
son, Rhode Island state Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
the night of the incident.
Landslide kills 21 in China
BEIJING (AP) — A landslide apparently set
off by mine activity killed 21 miners in south
ern China, an official newspaper said yesterday.
It was the second mine-related disaster
reported in a week. The official media disclosed
Wednesday that an April 21 gas explosion at
the state-run Sanjiaohe coal mine in northern
China killed at least 147 miners.
In the latest accident, the China Daily said,
about 40 miners were sleeping in a work shed
at the Qingshuikang Tin Mine in Guangdong
province when dirt and rocks slid down from a
nearby hill. Eight miners were injured, three
critically.
