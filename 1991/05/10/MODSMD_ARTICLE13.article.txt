SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
Riot police swinging truncheons
and firing tear gas fought tens of
thousands of demonstrators yes
terday in the largest anti-govern
ment protests in three years.
Radical students, yelling
"Down with (President] Roh Tae
woo," cut their fingers to write
protests in blood and carried wood
coffins to symbolize their hope for
the end of the ruling party of
President Roh Tae-woo.
Police said at one point 35,000
protesters hurling firebombs and

rocks were a block from the U.S.
Embassy and heading toward the
presidential Blue House mansion.
News reports said at least
200,000 protesters took part in
protests nationwide, adding that
up to one million people boycotted
classes and workplaces. Hand-to
hand fighting took place in the
nation's capital, Seoul.
National Police Headquarters
said perhaps hundreds of
protesters and at least 28 police
men had been injured nationwide.
In dozens of more peaceful

protests, marchers carried black
rimmed portraits of 20-year-old
Kang Kyung-dae, the student
beaten to death by police and
hailed a patriot.
Roh fired a Cabinet minister
and arrested five riot police
involved in the student's death,
but critics say it's not enough.
Fighting was the most
widespread since Roh took office
in 1988 and was considered cer
tain to deepen the political crisis
for his government, embroiled in
controversy since the April 26
fatal police beating of a student.
