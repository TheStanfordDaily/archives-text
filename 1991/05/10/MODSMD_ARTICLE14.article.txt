# Biden sees compromise on gun bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A key Senate Democrat
signaled a willingness yesterday to compromise on
provisions of President Bush's anti-crime bill to gain
the president's support for gun-control legislation.
Sen. Joseph Biden, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, vowed to send an anti-crime package to
the floor "as rapidly as I can" to meet Bush's chal
lenge to enact the legislation by June 15.
House passage of a seven-day waiting period for
handgun purchases on Wednesday was a "phenome
nal victory" for gun control advocates that could lead
to compromise with the White House on key ele
ments of the president's anti-crime package, Biden
said.
One disputed element of Bush's bill would make it
harder for state prisoners, particularly those on
death row, to file habeas corpus petitions in federal
court to challenge their sentences.
Another would expand the exceptions to the so
called exclusionary rule that bars prosecutors from
using illegally seized evidence in court.
"I think there is room for compromise on both,"
Biden said.
Bush also favors an expanded federal death penal
ty, opposed by many liberal Democrats. On the other
hand, many liberals favor a ban on certain semi
automatic weapons — a move opposed by the Nation
al Rifle Association and its allies in Congress.
These elements — along with handgun control —
are likely to become part of any overall crime bill that
emerges from Congress this year.
The White House renewed its threat during the
day to veto the handgun control bill if it is passed
separately. "Our position is the same on the veto but
we'll have to wait to see what the Senate does," said
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
The measure was approved in the House on a sur
prisingly wide margin of 239-186.
While Biden seemed to suggest that Democrats
were willing to negotiate the outlines of a crime bill,
the National Rifle Association has vowed to continue
its fight against the Brady Bill when it reaches the
Senate.
The bill would require gun dealers to notify local
police when a customer wants to purchase a hand
gun to give authorities a week to conduct a back
ground check of criminal records.
The measure is named for former White House
press secretary James Brady, who was left disabled
in 1981 when he was shot in the head in John Hinck
ley assassination attempt upon President Reagan.
