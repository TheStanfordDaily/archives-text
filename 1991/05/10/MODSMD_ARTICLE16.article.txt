## Political correctness 
### 
'PC' should not become
a label that obscures
the real issues at stake

Last Saturday, in his
address to the University of
Michigan's graduating class,
President Bush warned that intol
erance and bigotry are on the rise
in the United States.
But just as alarming, he said, is
the "growing tendency to use
intimidation rather than reason in
settling disputes."
For the first time, the president
added fuel to the fire of the debate
over political correctness, a notion
he said "has ignited controversy
across the land."
"And although the movement
arises from the laudable desire to
sweep away the debris of racism,
sexism and hatred, it replaces old
prejudices with new ones," he con
tinued.
The president's speech raised
some important issues, and he
could not have found a better place
to deliver it than at Michigan, a
university whose speech code was
recalled after being found uncon
stitutional.
But like much of the recent
debate on the issue, Bush's speech
failed to separate political correct
ness from the goals of the progres
sive movement that is labeled as
such.
Bush is right that reason has
been removed from much of the
debate. But what the president
attributes to intimidation is more
likely caused by a failure of individ
uals to touch more than the sur
face of many controversial topics.
The debate focusing on political
correctness is succeeding in degen
erating issue-oriented debate into
name calling.
What begin as intellectual argu

ments over issues like affirmative
action, minority faculty hiring and
restrictive speech codes end with one
side discounting the other's argu
ments by dismissing them as PC.
These days, being anti-PC has
even become PC.
And in the meantime, people
aren't participating in true debate
or making decisions on important
issues confronting the country,
many of which are particular to
college campuses.
Advocates of progressive politics
are lumped into the categories of
"non-thinker" and "crowd fol
lower." Critics don't account for
individuals' personal ideologies
and won't consider that those they
call PC may have reached conclu
sions after long, hard thought —
not just because everybody else is
doing it.
An example of the problems
with the furor over political cor
rectness is the debate on free
speech.
Bush says that "what began as a
crusade for civility has soured into
a cause of conflict and even censor
ship, . . . [inviting] people to look
for an insult in every word, ges
ture, action."
Granted, speech codes like
Michigan's have gone too far in
attempts to control discourse.
But the spirit of policies like
Stanford's Fundamental Standard
interpretation is to increase debate
by freeing certain people from a
harassing atmosphere which could
limit their opportunities for equal
education and free speech.
Protective speech codes restrict
ing the use of insults and fighting
words like "nigger" are not what is
hurting debate on campuses.
The focus on political correct
ness, and many people's immediate
dismissal of what are considered
PC ideas — simply because they
have been labeled so — is a much
more serious threat to open debate.
