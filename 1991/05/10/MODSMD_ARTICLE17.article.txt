Able leadership can lead us through current storm

PROFESSOR JOHN MANLEY
wrote in the April 27 Campus
Report that Stanford has been cor
rupted, that University President Don
ald Kennedy's leadership is lacking and
that Kennedy should resign. I believe
that Manley's opinions are shared by
very few and that he shows very little
understanding of the quality of Stan
ford's administration or of the depth of
commitment the faculty and staff have
for the institution and its goals.
As a teacher and researcher here for
35 years, I have seen Stanford served by
superb leadership, and Kennedy is
clearly continuing in that fortunate tra
dition.
The effort required to make Stanford
a continually stronger teaching and
research institution is enormous. This
involves obtaining financial resources to
attract and support the best scholar
teachers and to provide the academic and
physical facilities for students, faculty
and staff.
A policy which Stanford has
attempted to follow when possible is that

gifts, endowment income and tuition are
used for academic purposes and that
sponsored research should be self-sup
porting. It is not that Stanford did not
want to share the costs of sponsored
research projects, but if push comes to
shove, it is more important to use Uni
versity funds to support an English pro
fessor's teaching than the research pro
gram of an engineering professor.
Also, for many years agencies that
sponsor research have agreed that they
should pay the total cost of research and
that university research was a good deal
for them. Not only did they receive qual
ity work, but the indirect-cost rate was
less than for industry, and the U.S. econ
omy benefited from the trained gradu
ates.
Some universities have shared the
real indirect costs of sponsored research,
but they were either state-supported or
not stretched to the limit to provide the
best possible research and teaching envi
ronment.
"Full cost" has meant, for example,
paying the stipends and tuition of

research assistants (still a modest salary)
and reimbursing the institutions for the
costs associated with those research
assistants (for example, a fair share of
the library costs).
The agencies have also been willing
to pay a fair share of administrative
costs. But rather than to look at every
receipt, they have endorsed "pool
accounting."
The fair allocation to a pool was nego
tiated by looking over the expenses for
some period of time and deciding
through a "memorandum of understand
ing" what fraction should be charged to
the agencies.
The government did not pay for new
furniture in Hoover House nor for flow
ers, it simply paid its share of the pool.
Likewise, if three years ago Kennedy was
expected to entertain visiting govern
ment VIPs, the government only paid its
share of the pool, not the true cost of the
entertainment.
By looking at only a few specific items
in a pool, the whole process can be enor

mously distorted. The political and
financial climates in Washington, D.C.
have changed and perhaps now universi
ties are a target for cost-cutting and even
present an opportunity for headlines
based on these distortions.
In hindsight (which is close to 20/20
vision), Stanford should have left some
items out of the pool simply to prevent
persons who wish to use this distortion
to serve their own agenda from doing so.
Of course, mistakes have been made
and I expect that Stanford will develop
accounting procedures which will be a
model for institutions across the country.
In the meantime, we will have some
painful months to live through and we
can survive these better if we all assist
Kennedy and a very able staff in their
effort to move Stanford back to its pri
mary missions of teaching and research.
Stanford's progress these past 10
years and 100 years has been without
parallel and we are fortunate.
