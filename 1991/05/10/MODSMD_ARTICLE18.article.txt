# Advocating drug use is not unusual among medical professionals

Stuart Reges has drawn the most crit
icism for counseling an undergraduate
student to try the illegal drug MDA. His
defense, that the casual bus stop conver
sation represents private speech, is inad
equate. The relationship between profes
sional and client cannot be dismissed
because the conversation did not take
place in a classroom.
If a doctor met a former patient at a
bus stop and counseled the patient to
take an illegal drug, it would be difficult

to argue that the doctor had no profes
sional responsibility. But would the doc
tor be within ethical bounds if she or he
felt it was in the best interests of the
patient, or at least would do no harm?
The May 1 San Jose Mercury News
carried the following item: "Despite the
drug's illegality, more than 40 percent
surveyed U.S. cancer specialists have rec
ommended smoking marijuana to relieve
chemotherapy nausea."
The survey was conducted by
researchers from Harvard University. It
may seem an aberration for professionals
to advocate illegal drug use to their
clients, but apparently it is fairly com
mon.
