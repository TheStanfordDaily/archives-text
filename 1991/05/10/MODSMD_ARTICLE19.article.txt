# Reges should use his soapbox to advocate much worthier causes
## 
### 
Stuart Reges should get a real cause.
For a person who is willing to put his job
on the line and get on various blacklists,
he has squandered his convictions on an
incredibly petty issue.
People all over the world are suffering
real misfortunes; the planet is in jeop
ardy, and Reges goes to the mat for our
freedom to do drugs. "Freshman and
sophomores," he complains, "are amaz
ingly afraid of trying any drugs." So
what? Is this a critical issue?

If Reges is really more interested in
making improvements than in grand
standing, there are plenty of deserving
causes that could benefit from his level
of dedication.
