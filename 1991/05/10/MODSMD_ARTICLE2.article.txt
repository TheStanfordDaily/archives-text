# Faculty poll:
## 45% give Kennedy negative rating 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
Nearly half of Stanford's
professors disapprove of Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy's job performance,
and about one-third want him
to resign, according to the
results of a Daily poll con
ducted this week.
Kennedy has endured harsh
criticism during months of fed
eral investigations into Stan
ford's use of federal research
grants. And last week, Provost
James Rosse announced deep
budget cuts resulting from the
government's decision to cut
the rate at which it reimburses
Stanford for research over
head.
Only 34 percent of profes
sors approve of the way
Kennedy is handling his job as
University president, while 45
percent said they disapprove.
The Daily polled 314 mem
bers of the University's Aca
demic Council by telephone.
The council is made up of Stan
ford's nearly 1,400 professors.
Although it accounts for the vast
majority of the faculty, the council
does not include several hundred
lecturers and other non-professo
rial instructors.
A random sample of professors
was called Tuesday, Wednesday
and yesterday. The poll has a 5
percent margin of error.
Twenty-nine percent of profes
sors called for Kennedy's resigna
tion, while 51 percent said
Kennedy should remain in his job.
Kennedy said last month that
he had no plans to resign. Soon
after, the Board of Trustees

voiced support of Kennedy. Only
one Stanford professor, Political
Science Prof. John Manley, has
publicly called for Kennedy to
step down.
Poll results show that profes
sors are slightly more critical of
Kennedy than students were in a
Daily poll conducted last month.
In the earlier poll, 19 percent of
students called for Kennedy's res
ignation, while 54 percent wanted
Kennedy to keep his job.
Professors also voiced more
disapproval of Kennedy's job per
formance than did the students.
Students with an opinion were
evenly split at 35 percent on
whether they approved or disap
proved of Kennedy's perfor
mance.
Many professors also seemed
to be concerned about the effects

budget cuts will have on academic
programs and quality of life.
According to the poll, morale
among professors has dropped
during the last year. Forty-two
percent of professors polled said
their morale is lower or much
lower now than it was last year at
this time. Only about 10 percent
said their morale now is higher or
much higher, and 38 percent said
their morale is the same as last
year.
