# Faculty poll:
## 45% give Kennedy negative rating 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
Nearly half of Stanford's
professors disapprove of Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy's job performance,
and about one-third want him
to resign, according to the
results of a Daily poll con
ducted this week.
Kennedy has endured harsh
criticism during months of fed
eral investigations into Stan
ford's use of federal research
grants. And last week, Provost
James Rosse announced deep
budget cuts resulting from the
government's decision to cut
the rate at which it reimburses
Stanford for research over
head.
Only 34 percent of profes
sors approve of the way
Kennedy is handling his job as
University president, while 45
percent said they disapprove.
The Daily polled 314 mem
bers of the University's Aca
demic Council by telephone.
