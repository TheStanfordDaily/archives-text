## Ode to SLE Males 
### 
Oppression, that is our
Theme Of The Week. We asked our
selves, "What is the most perse
cuted and oppressed group on campus?"
Ethnic minorities? No. Women? Guess
again. Fraternity guys? Nope. Non-tradi
tional sexual orientation groups? Uh-uh.
People's Platform Council of Presidents
slates? Close, but no cigar.
The most oppressed group on campus
(and we know from personal experience)
is: SLE Males.
Let us set the scene:
It is spring quarter. Marx, Hegel and
Nietzsche are getting annoying. Freud,
however, is sounding quite relevant. Hor
mones are raging, the fever is high. You
look across from you in section and see
the object of your affection. "The dialec
tic" begins to take on new meaning.
You know what you want to do, but
you don't have the guts. You have become
what the entire campus has always
believed you to be: Socially Inept.
We can identify with your struggle. We
know your pain. We want to put our arms
around you and make you whole again.
We composed this little poem for you.
We have attempted, by capturing our
year-old memories, to reconstruct the
universal plight of all SLE Males.
(Any similarities between our poem
and T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock" is not coincidental. He
copied us, dammit! And we're pissed.)
"The Love Song of the Spring Quarter
SLE Male"
Let us go then, you and 1,
When the evening is spread out against

the sky,
Like lecture notes scattered 'bout the
table;
Let us go, through Flo Mo's narrow
halls,
The pasty white walls
Of restless nights in sterile dormitories,
And post-party puking in lavatories.
SLE students come and go,
Talking of Michelangelo.
There will be time, there will be time,
Time for you and time for me,
And yet time for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
On the papers we write for SLE.
SLE students come and go,
Talking of Michelangelo.
And indeed there will be time
To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I
dare?"
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a
minute will reverse.
Why does perfume from a dress
Make me so digress ?
Shall I say, I have walked at dusk
around Lake Lag
And watched the smiles of happy couples
Of two people rolling in the grass? . . .
Her back, her neck, it all entices,
But, have I the strength to force the

moment to its crisis?
Now we've come to back rub's end —
But how 1 dread, those evil words,
"I like you as a friend."
No! 1 am not MACHO, nor was meant to
be,
Am a Pathetic Guy, one that will do
To lend an ear and kiss up to you.
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious and humorous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous —
Almost, at times, the Fool.
To be bold ... To be bold . ..
Should I wear my Bugle Boy trousers
rolled?
Shall I part my hair behind ? Do I dare
to wear Drakkar?
I'll take her to the movies — where can 1
find a car ?
I do not think she'll go out with me.
This is how spring quarter ends,
Not with a bang, but a whimper.
