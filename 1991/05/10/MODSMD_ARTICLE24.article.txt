## Geetika Tandon It's time for Indian-Americans to share and celebrate their culture 
### 
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME. I've
been a Farm-dweller for four
years and an Indian for 21, yet
this is the first time I've been able to
bring the two together. The Indian-Amer
ican community at Stanford is finally
coming out into the open.
I realized this in October when San
skriti, the Indian club, celebrated Divali
(the festival of lights) in the Wilbur Hall
courtyard. The festivities were complete
with food, folk dancing and loud Indian
music blaring in Branner Hall's direction.
A path of candles lit the way to the
samosas and pakoras (food) and stick
dancing on the grass.
I've been to Divali celebrations here
every year, but there's quite an emotional
difference between the quiet containment
of the Bechtel International Center and
the visibility of Wilbur courtyard.
People stared as they walked by. And it
felt good. We played the same music I
used to beg my parents to turn off when
friends came over. But this time, it actu
ally felt good.
We've come a long way since the 1987
Orientation, when a couple of us U.S.-
born Indians bounded over to the Asian
American New Students Orientation
Committee dinner, assuming that we
were Asian. We watched and applauded
the Japanese Dragon dancers and appre
ciated the Hawaiian Club hula dancers,

and watched and waited to identify with
the others.
We listened and got excited when the
AANSOC chair spoke, careful to begin by
saying, "We at the Asian American Stu
dents Association know that 'Asian'
doesn't just mean being Chinese,
Japanese or Korean, but also includes . .
We looked at each other, smiled and
waited. Twenty or so "Asian brands"
later, we were still waiting to identify.
Finally we left, dissatisfied, but moved on
and forgot about the whole thing for a
while.
Why has our emergence been so long in
coming, in light of the culture-is-cool atti
tude at Stanford? My guess is that it has
something to do with poverty.
No, not the "poverty of our people"
thing — that wouldn't be real. I heard
recently that Indians in the United States
are the second most wealthy ethnic
group. Nor am I referring to the well-pub
licized poverty of India itself.
The poverty I mean is the product of
my lack of understanding of my country,
of the empty picture that evolved as I was
growing up.
Elementary school was a traumatic
experience. "India" was a faraway place
made up of starving kids with bloated
stomachs sitting on dusty paths in dirty
villages. It was the all-purpose guilt-trip

Elementary school was a traumatic experience. India'
was a faraway place made up of starving kids with

image to be utilized by the parents of my
non-Indian friends. You know what it
sounds like: "Amy, now finish those lima
beans. There are starving children in
India!"
After years of being the butt of " Indian
jokes" (which were really Native Ameri
can jokes, but kids can be stupid), cow
jokes and "Why did 'Gandhi' win the
Oscar? It was so long and boring" com
ments from my peers, you can't help feel
ing a little guilt.
Indian-Americans at Stanford had a
discussion last quarter — the first one of
its kind — about identity issues. At one
point in the evening I asked the group,
"Do you guys really think we're proud of
who we are?" The nearly unanimous
response was a low murmur that echoed
through the room. "No," said Indian-
American men and women softly.
Coming out of years of hoping no one

noticed my color, it is no wonder that it
has been difficult to want visibility in
the Stanford community. There's always
the unspoken fear, "Will people really be
interested?"
But I am beginning to have a new hope
for my community. We are a new presence
in the United States, and even newer
presence on this campus. It is difficult at
times not being a "mainstream" minority.
At times I've even wished that we were
unfortunate enough to be stereotyped
more often. At least that would mean we
were being noticed.
But I am beginning to find hope in the
realization that the place we are in now is
invaluable. It just isn't every day that you
get to define yourself and develop a com
munity from scratch. How we assimilate,
who we become, depends pretty much on
turn aur mai (you and me).
My excitement about the Indian-

American community at Stanford has lit
tle to do with political correctness.
Rather, it has everything to do with being
who we are, and sharing that with people
who are interested.
It has everything to do with being in a
place where we are secure enough to feel
interesting. The victory is that we can
play our music and dance our dances and
begin to see and share the richness of our
traditions. We are on the threshold of
something new and big.
At that discussion on identity last
quarter, I posed a question to the group:
"How would you feel if tomorrow morn
ingyou opened The Daily and saw an arti
cle about us — the Indian-American com
munity at Stanford?"
Eyes widened. People were visibly star
tled by the idea. I think I even heard a few
hearts beat faster. And I knew what peo
ple were thinking. I'd thought it myself
many times. "Who'd read it? Who'd be
interested?"
Maybe it's time to take the risk and
find out.

coming, in light of the culture-is-cool atti
tude at Stanford? My guess is that it has
something to do with poverty.
No, not the "poverty of our people"
thing — that wouldn't be real. I heard
recently that Indians in the United States
are the second most wealthy ethnic
group. Nor am I referring to the well-pub
licized poverty of India itself.
The poverty I mean is the product of
my lack of understanding of my country,
of the empty picture that evolved as I was
growing up.
Elementary school was a traumatic
experience. "India" was a faraway place
made up of starving kids with bloated
stomachs sitting on dusty paths in dirty
villages. It was the all-purpose guilt-trip

image to be utilized by the parents of my
non-Indian friends. You know what it
sounds like: "Amy, now finish those lima
beans. There are starving children in
India!"
After years of being the butt of " Indian
jokes" (which were really Native Ameri
can jokes, but kids can be stupid), cow
jokes and "Why did 'Gandhi' win the
Oscar? It was so long and boring" com
ments from my peers, you can't help feel
ing a little guilt.
Indian-Americans at Stanford had a
discussion last quarter — the first one of
its kind — about identity issues. At one
point in the evening I asked the group,
"Do you guys really think we're proud of
who we are?" The nearly unanimous
response was a low murmur that echoed
through the room. "No," said Indian-
American men and women softly.
Coming out of years of hoping no one

noticed my color, it is no wonder that it
has been difficult to want visibility in
the Stanford community. There's always
the unspoken fear, "Will people really be
interested?"
But I am beginning to have a new hope
for my community. We are a new presence
in the United States, and even newer
presence on this campus. It is difficult at
times not being a "mainstream" minority.
At times I've even wished that we were
unfortunate enough to be stereotyped
more often. At least that would mean we
were being noticed.
But I am beginning to find hope in the
realization that the place we are in now is
invaluable. It just isn't every day that you
get to define yourself and develop a com
munity from scratch. How we assimilate,
who we become, depends pretty much on
turn aur mai (you and me).
My excitement about the Indian-

American community at Stanford has lit
tle to do with political correctness.
Rather, it has everything to do with being
who we are, and sharing that with people
who are interested.
It has everything to do with being in a
place where we are secure enough to feel
interesting. The victory is that we can
play our music and dance our dances and
begin to see and share the richness of our
traditions. We are on the threshold of
something new and big.
At that discussion on identity last
quarter, I posed a question to the group:
"How would you feel if tomorrow morn
ingyou opened The Daily and saw an arti
cle about us — the Indian-American com
munity at Stanford?"
Eyes widened. People were visibly star
tled by the idea. I think I even heard a few
hearts beat faster. And I knew what peo
ple were thinking. I'd thought it myself
many times. "Who'd read it? Who'd be
interested?"
Maybe it's time to take the risk and
find out.

WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME. I've
been a Farm-dweller for four
years and an Indian for 21, yet
this is the first time I've been able to
bring the two together. The Indian-Amer
ican community at Stanford is finally
coming out into the open.
I realized this in October when San
skriti, the Indian club, celebrated Divali
(the festival of lights) in the Wilbur Hall
courtyard. The festivities were complete
with food, folk dancing and loud Indian
music blaring in Branner Hall's direction.
A path of candles lit the way to the
samosas and pakoras (food) and stick
dancing on the grass.
I've been to Divali celebrations here
every year, but there's quite an emotional
difference between the quiet containment
of the Bechtel International Center and
the visibility of Wilbur courtyard.
People stared as they walked by. And it
felt good. We played the same music I
used to beg my parents to turn off when
friends came over. But this time, it actu
ally felt good.
We've come a long way since the 1987
Orientation, when a couple of us U.S.-
born Indians bounded over to the Asian
American New Students Orientation
Committee dinner, assuming that we
were Asian. We watched and applauded
the Japanese Dragon dancers and appre
ciated the Hawaiian Club hula dancers,

and watched and waited to identify with
the others.
We listened and got excited when the
AANSOC chair spoke, careful to begin by
saying, "We at the Asian American Stu
dents Association know that 'Asian'
doesn't just mean being Chinese,
Japanese or Korean, but also includes . .
We looked at each other, smiled and
waited. Twenty or so "Asian brands"
later, we were still waiting to identify.
Finally we left, dissatisfied, but moved on
and forgot about the whole thing for a
while.
