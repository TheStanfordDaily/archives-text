# Eating pavement and swallowing gears

it was just my luck.
You know those people you always
get stuck biking behind when you're
already three minutes late for class,
rushing to turn in a paper due five
days ago? You know, the people who
truck along at two miles an hour with
their helmets, orange warning vests
and bike lights turned on even though
it's daytime, making you feel guilty
because they actually walk their bike
through White Plaza?
That's me.
I didn't used to be a bike doofus. In
fact, biking used to be my most social
activity. 1 met many people through
accidents caused by my reckless bik
ing. Now I just take SURE Escort Ser
vice to meet the drivers.
My first dooser came on KA Mud
Volleyball Tournament day. Being an
eager freshman dorm, we had risen at
5:00 a.m., played in sub-zero tempera
tures in a fake lake for 12 hours and
acted like we were having the time of
our lives.
Of course, I couldn't have a normal
accident near the Clock Tower at
11:53 a.m. on a school day. No, mine
had to be on the road in back of the
Law School during an outdoor admin
istration conference. My sweatshirt
came untied and slid in between the
frame of my bike and the back wheel.
Wheels locked and skidding for 20
feet, I — the muddy, screaming won
der — totally disrupted the conference
as 1 flew by. Actually, I was able to
recover, but then the Ford Aerostar
turned the corner and slammed into
me. The good news is that the 15-mile
an-hour speed bumpers on those vans
really work.
"How about that for a quality
American-made vehicle," the driver
nodded as he stepped out of the car.
1 was lucky because the mud helped
to slow the bleeding, and Cowell Stu
dent Health Center doctored me up
with some Band-Aids.
Then, I started sneezing, hyperven
tilating and got the chills. The doctors
said that I might be going into shock,
but probably just had a touch of a cold.
The cold symptoms sheet they gave
me as they carried me out of the door
was really helpful. It said I should feel
free to come back later if I had green

mucus that prevented me from
breathing, a temperature higher than
105 degrees or was dead.
Though I treasured the people I
had met during my first wreck, my
second brought even more new
acquaintances. It was a beautiful day
as I went to leave the training room
having had my ankles wrapped. Slip
ping my shoes on, I decided to bag on
tying my shoe laces — definitely a
freshman testing out her new freedom
thing.
I forgot as I biked toward the fields
whether you're supposed to ride with
or against the flow of traffic. I just
rode through it, crossing Campus
Drive near the tennis courts.
I drifted back to my elementary
school days when Bob the Bike Safety
Bear sang to our school, "Keep both
hands on the handle bars and eyes
peeled on the road." Suddenly, I was
blasted out of my daydream by a blar
ing horn.
Quickly, I braked and came to a
stop near the median. The car whizzed
by. When I went to put my feet down
to regain my balance, I found that
both of my shoelaces had wrapped
around my pedals, binding my legs to
the bike. Luckily, I had a nice cushy
median to fall on.
I lay pinned and helpless. Then,
people came streaming from the ten
nis match that had just ended! About
40 elderly alumni rushed over and
stood there gaping at me.
Finally, two alumni attempted to
lift the bike tires, and then a few more
joined in after one threw out his back.

Patiently, they unwound my shoe
laces. I was free. I biked away waving
to the crowd of hundreds that had
grown when the ambulance arrived to
help the nice man with his back prob
lem.
But it wasn't until the day I discov
ered pedestrians don't always stop for
bikes like cars do that I stopped my
reckless ways.
Luckily, it was one of my CIV pro
fessors I plowed into as he walked
across the intersection near the Ter
man Engineering Building, just after
our first essay was due. Some profto
sors make themselves so accessible.
Just that morning, he had encouraged
us to come and chat about our essays
sometime.
Then, I remembered we were sup
posed to come with a hard copy. How
was 1 going to find my paper among
the 240 scattered CIV essays in the
street? Not that the Honor Code thing
of having to keep your eyes on your
own paper made it any easier.
"Who are you?" he screamed as I
sifted through the mass of papers.
My eyes popped open and my pulse
began to race. This was it. He was test
ing me, using the Socratic method we
had discussed in class, beginning with
the fundamental question, "Who are
you?" I wish I had read over the course
information sheet. I was under the
impression that he only gave surprise
oral exams in class.
Then the answer became clear to
me. Exams ... the Honor Code ... a
question using traditional Socratic
method ... I had it: "Why are blue
books blue like the sky?" I rebutted.
He only became angrier when I
head butted him as I bent to help him
pick the papers. "Just leave them be,"
he said. "Go away, and we'll pretend
this never happened."
Great. There are some things that
are OK to do with your teachers out
side of the classroom. I mean, I didn't
think the Bike Safety Czar was going
to send him a letter or anything.
I turned over a new leaf after that
accident. You really have to draw the
line when the federal government gets
involved. My swinging, social days as a
reckless biker were over. I reevaluated
my priorities. I came here to get an
education, not to socialize.

as 1 flew by. Actually, I was able to
recover, but then the Ford Aerostar
turned the corner and slammed into
me. The good news is that the 15-mile
an-hour speed bumpers on those vans
really work.
"How about that for a quality
American-made vehicle," the driver
nodded as he stepped out of the car.
1 was lucky because the mud helped
to slow the bleeding, and Cowell Stu
dent Health Center doctored me up
with some Band-Aids.
Then, I started sneezing, hyperven
tilating and got the chills. The doctors
said that I might be going into shock,
but probably just had a touch of a cold.
The cold symptoms sheet they gave
me as they carried me out of the door
was really helpful. It said I should feel
free to come back later if I had green

mucus that prevented me from
breathing, a temperature higher than
105 degrees or was dead.
Though I treasured the people I
had met during my first wreck, my
second brought even more new
acquaintances. It was a beautiful day
as I went to leave the training room
having had my ankles wrapped. Slip
ping my shoes on, I decided to bag on
tying my shoe laces — definitely a
freshman testing out her new freedom
thing.
I forgot as I biked toward the fields
whether you're supposed to ride with
or against the flow of traffic. I just
rode through it, crossing Campus
Drive near the tennis courts.
I drifted back to my elementary
school days when Bob the Bike Safety
Bear sang to our school, "Keep both
hands on the handle bars and eyes
peeled on the road." Suddenly, I was
blasted out of my daydream by a blar
ing horn.
Quickly, I braked and came to a
stop near the median. The car whizzed
by. When I went to put my feet down
to regain my balance, I found that
both of my shoelaces had wrapped
around my pedals, binding my legs to
the bike. Luckily, I had a nice cushy
median to fall on.
I lay pinned and helpless. Then,
people came streaming from the ten
nis match that had just ended! About
40 elderly alumni rushed over and
stood there gaping at me.
Finally, two alumni attempted to
lift the bike tires, and then a few more
joined in after one threw out his back.

Patiently, they unwound my shoe
laces. I was free. I biked away waving
to the crowd of hundreds that had
grown when the ambulance arrived to
help the nice man with his back prob
lem.
But it wasn't until the day I discov
ered pedestrians don't always stop for
bikes like cars do that I stopped my
reckless ways.
Luckily, it was one of my CIV pro
fessors I plowed into as he walked
across the intersection near the Ter
man Engineering Building, just after
our first essay was due. Some profto
sors make themselves so accessible.
Just that morning, he had encouraged
us to come and chat about our essays
sometime.
Then, I remembered we were sup
posed to come with a hard copy. How
was 1 going to find my paper among
the 240 scattered CIV essays in the
street? Not that the Honor Code thing
of having to keep your eyes on your
own paper made it any easier.
"Who are you?" he screamed as I
sifted through the mass of papers.
My eyes popped open and my pulse
began to race. This was it. He was test
ing me, using the Socratic method we
had discussed in class, beginning with
the fundamental question, "Who are
you?" I wish I had read over the course
information sheet. I was under the
impression that he only gave surprise
oral exams in class.
Then the answer became clear to
me. Exams ... the Honor Code ... a
question using traditional Socratic
method ... I had it: "Why are blue
books blue like the sky?" I rebutted.
He only became angrier when I
head butted him as I bent to help him
pick the papers. "Just leave them be,"
he said. "Go away, and we'll pretend
this never happened."
Great. There are some things that
are OK to do with your teachers out
side of the classroom. I mean, I didn't
think the Bike Safety Czar was going
to send him a letter or anything.
I turned over a new leaf after that
accident. You really have to draw the
line when the federal government gets
involved. My swinging, social days as a
reckless biker were over. I reevaluated
my priorities. I came here to get an
education, not to socialize.

Just My Luck
it was just my luck.
You know those people you always
get stuck biking behind when you're
already three minutes late for class,
rushing to turn in a paper due five
days ago? You know, the people who
truck along at two miles an hour with
their helmets, orange warning vests
and bike lights turned on even though
it's daytime, making you feel guilty
because they actually walk their bike
through White Plaza?
That's me.
I didn't used to be a bike doofus. In
fact, biking used to be my most social
activity. 1 met many people through
accidents caused by my reckless bik
ing. Now I just take SURE Escort Ser
vice to meet the drivers.
My first dooser came on KA Mud
Volleyball Tournament day. Being an
eager freshman dorm, we had risen at
5:00 a.m., played in sub-zero tempera
tures in a fake lake for 12 hours and
acted like we were having the time of
our lives.
Of course, I couldn't have a normal
accident near the Clock Tower at
11:53 a.m. on a school day. No, mine
had to be on the road in back of the
Law School during an outdoor admin
istration conference. My sweatshirt
came untied and slid in between the
frame of my bike and the back wheel.
Wheels locked and skidding for 20
feet, I — the muddy, screaming won
der — totally disrupted the conference
as 1 flew by. Actually, I was able to
recover, but then the Ford Aerostar
turned the corner and slammed into
me. The good news is that the 15-mile
an-hour speed bumpers on those vans
really work.
