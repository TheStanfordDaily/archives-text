# Bug dreams of Jeannie with light blond hair
## 
### John Ott Staff writer 
My reign as BOg began early last
quarter, when I was an eager but naive
Psychology 1 student (3 units,
Pass/Not Conscious). A proponent of
the advancement of scientific knowl
edge, I signed myself up for experi
ment after experiment with all the
shameful, drooling glee of a spry young
lad unwrapping a bounty of presents
under a Christmas tree.
What a horrid metaphor.
At any rate, I became wary during
one experiment when they manacled
my wrists together and drove me to an
underground lab at the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, and outright
suspicious when they strapped me into
a glowing iron coffin and attached sev
eral dozen electrodes to my temples.
But I figured, hell, if Philip Zim
bardo could get away with that sadist
prison number, then a stunt like this
was OK by me, despite the fact that
everyone else was wearing radiation
suits.
Next thing I knew . . . well, you've
all seen "The Fly." Now the Jeff Gold
blum of the Stanford community, I've
had a little trouble readjusting to col
lege life as a six-foot-tall, eight-legged

insect.
For instance, it takes people a little
while to get used to my spitting up sev
eral pints of gooey, acidic bile on my
food before I eat it. In addition, I've
discovered that most Food Service
pasta resists such endeavors to break
it down into a digestible morass.
Yes, I do know most of you are eat
ing as you read this.
For a while I also had difficulty
accepting my new self-image, but I
came to the conclusion that there are
a lot of graduate students out there
who look just as strange as as I do.
Anyway. . . .
Dear Bug,
I am confused about the gender of
the Pro Fro triplets featured in the
April 26 Daily. What sex are they?
Were any non-identical triplets ever
admitted to Stanford?
First off, as the cover-our-asses
apology stated last week, it was all a
hoax, you ninny.
Of course, I should be the last one to
talk about gullibility, having clung to
the myth of the Tooth Fairy well into
my teens — a psychologically danger
ous situation as I increasingly began to
confuse my wet dreams and the explo

ration of my sexuality with dental
hygiene. My Oedipal instincts became
quickly and strangely centered around
the battle against the "Cavity Creeps."
Besides, it was kind of nifty to get
that supermarket tabloid feel in The
Daily, wasn't it? I personally would like
to see more headlines like "UFO
PILOTED BY HITLER CLONES
LOOTS GRACELAND!" adorning the
front page.
Oh yes, the question. A merry
steeplechase through perhaps every
department at this University ended,
at last, at the office of the mythic Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions, Jean
Fetter. Boy, was I playing with the high
rollers this time.

Here I had a shot at real Fame.
Maybe I was going to live forever,
maybe I was going to light up the sky
like a flame! Naw. At any rate, this was
an opportunity to chat with one of the
most well-known people in the under
graduate world.
What really made her tick? What
were her hobbies? Did she have any
tattoos? Why so many? If she were
stranded on a desert island, what
aspirin would she bring along with
her? Why do I get the feeling that the
entire student body would commit sui
cide for her at her very whim like some
far-fetched, deranged Jonestown deal?
There were many questions to be
asked. Above all, I felt this burning
desire to ask her out on a date. I mean,
what the hell, I'm a good-looking
arthropod.
But, alas, the Fates would not allow
it. Our only communication occurred
via answering messages, so I guess I'll
never get the chance to fill the aching
void in my yearning heart. She did
answer the question, though. In the
last seven years, Stanford has admit
ted two sets of non-identical triplets,
but none of the six chose to enroll.
How snooty. Your mom's egg splits
in three and all of a sudden you're the
cat's meow.
