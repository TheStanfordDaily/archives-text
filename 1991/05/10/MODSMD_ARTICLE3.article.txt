# Few say Reges case involves free speech

A mtyority of Stanford professors think
Computer Science Senior Lecturer Stuart
Reges should be fired if administrators
determine he has violated the University's
drug and alcohol policy, a Daily poll has
found.
Less than a fifth of the members of the
Academic Council polled said they think
Reges should be allowed to stay if the Uni
versity determines he has violated its drug
and alcohol policy.

Reges was placed on paid administrative
leave April 19 pending an investigation of his
claims that he violated University drug rules
in protest of U.S. drug policy.
His suspension came after University
President Donald Kennedy received a letter
from national drug czar Bob Martinez warn
ing that the University must enforce its drug
and alcohol policy or risk losing its federal
funds.
In the three weeks since his suspension,
Reges has attracted national media attention
and raised the issues of personal privacy and
free speech while advocating the legalization

of drugs.
Keges has said that if he is fired, the Uni
versity's decision would be based on an issue
of "professional misconduct" involving his
advice to a student to experiment with the
drug MDA, an amphetamine-derived hallu
cinogen nicknamed "the love drug."
He claims the advice is protected free
speech.
But University President Donald
Kennedy wrote in a letter to The Daily April
22 that Reges' advice constitutes "conduct,


Doug Davis — Daily
not protected speech.''
The poll found that 54 percent
of Stanford professors agree that
Reges' advice should be consid
ered punishable conduct.
Only 18 percent think Reges'
advice was protected free speech,
even though a number of Law
School professors — including
Thomas Grey and William Cohen
— said last week that it should be
considered a free speech issue.
The poll also found that nearly
three-quarters of the faculty — 73
percent — disagree with Reges'
opinion that the University
should not prohibit recreational
drug use.
