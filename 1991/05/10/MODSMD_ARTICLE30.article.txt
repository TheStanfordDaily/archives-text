# Small-time politics — big-time bickering
## A 						closer look at the fun, fashion and fecundity of the ASSU Senate 
### 
"A real live ASSU Senate meeting?" you gasp.
"What goes on there? What kind of semiotics of
power take place behind those dark oak Law School
doors?"
Well, my friends, look no further. You can get your
fix on what really goes on at an ASSU Senate meet
ing right here. Here's what happened at last Thurs
day's meeting:
7:00 p.m.: Senate meeting scheduled to begin.
Five senators present.
7:13 p.m.: Quorum achieved; 12 of 40 senators
present.
8:14 p.m.: Senators-elect Pamay Bassey and

Ying-Ying Goh begin argument over the esteemed
privilege of calling themselves the Kith undergradu
ate senator. (They were tied in the election.) Secret
ballot ensues.
8:20 p.m.: Naomi Onaga (in faded, well-worn-in
jean shorts) asks the group at large, "What are the
bylaws?" to which the spunky graduate senator
James Vera quips, "A big book of rules that nobody
follows."
8:24 p.m.: In a moment of parliamentary mas
turbation — too confusing to explain to you, the
uninitiated reader — graduate senator Andrew Zim
merman asks the age-old question, "Are we dis
cussing whether we should count the votes or
whether Dave [Brownl is allowed to make a
motion?"
8:49 p.m.: Senator-elect Dave Hyatt unwraps his
packet of strawberry-flavored Pop Rocks Action
Candy and proceeds to lick the apparently already
candy-free foil.
8:57 p.m.: Hyatt can find no more "pop" in wrap
per. Sighs emphatically. Proceeds to leave room.
9:30 p.m.: Jason Moore (in self-described hip,
'90s Agent Cooper conservative/hick garb) agrees to
give money-hungry "Face Book" entrepreneur
Kevin Hartz the senate's powerful vote of approval
if, in exchange, he includes a full-page photo of the
senate and the Council of Presidents. Gets big,
dorky high five from graduate senator Doug Bone.
9:32 p.m.: Senator-elect Silvia Ferroni (in a
bright, yellow floral dress) leaves with equally blond,
"Face Book tycoon" Kevin Hartz.
9:34 p.m.: John Overdeck, graduate senator and
COP member-to-be, waves placard spastically in an

effort to be recognized by senate chair Solina Kwan.
9:42 p.m.: Jason Moore hides copy of "Time"
magazine under senate voting package, lands upon
article on Madonna.
9:57 p.m.: Overdeck waves placard spastically
while humming simultaneously.
10:00 p.m.: Senate scheduled to end, but
diehards move outside to Law School courtyard to
vote on whether to give senators who go to USSA
(Secret palindromic organization?) $100 for "stamps
and gas money and stuff."
10:33 p.m.: Everyone heads home for cookies,
hot chocolate and another long week of preparation.
