The Board of Trustees announced
today that they were abolishing the
Stanford "500" rule. The "500" rule, of
course, was the maximum number of
female students allowed to attend Stan-
I ford each year. With the country in the
1 middle of a depression, the trustees real-
I ized that they needed a quick influx of

students and tuition to stay afloat.

"Again tomorrow, we all have the
chance to participate in an annual Stan
ford farce: ASSU elections.
"But why should the grand tradition
of self-government have degenerated
into a farce?"
No, this editorial wasn't written last
week, but 36 years ago. In a Kafkaesque,
strangely familiar way, The Daily edito
rial board lambasted the current state of
student politics. It laid the principle
blame, however, on voter apathy.
