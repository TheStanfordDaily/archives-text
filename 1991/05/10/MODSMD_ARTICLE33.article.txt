Eastern European studies professors will proba
bly understand — and more than likely approve — if
their students decide to skip class and sit in front of
the television this morning.
Senior government officials from Central and
Eastern Europe will join Hoover Institution fellows
today in a teleconference discussing the revolution
ary changes and economic challenges faced by their
countries as they shake off communism. It will be
broadcast to selected locations around the country as
well as to some residences and other locations on
campus.
Today's panelists will include Nobel Laureates in
economics Milton Friedman and George Stigler, for
mer Secretary of State and Hoover Distinguished
Fellow George Schultz and five senior officials from
Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Czechoslo
vakia.
John Raisian, director of the Hoover Institution,
said the discussion will generally focus on the drastic
economic reforms that are underway in Eastern
Europe.
He said he is optimistic that the conference will
provide useful suggestions for improvements,
although many U.S. scholars have ambitious but
impractical ideas about what Eastern Europeans
should do to expedite their transition to capitalist
economies.
"American advisors tend to say 'You must do this,
this and this — quickly!' without an idea of the con
straints on Eastern Europeans," Raisian said. "In
order to have a productive conversation, we must
find out what the possibility for economic change is
and also what the realities are."
The teleconference will be aired live from
Hoover's Stauffer Auditorium from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Although entrance to the set will be by "invitation

only," Stanford residents can access the conference
by tuning in to residential cable Channel 12 or uni
versal cable Channel 42.
The discussion format allows viewers to pose
questions to the speakers by telephone and receive
their answers on the air. This morning's session,
moderated by Stanford alumna Kate Kelly of KPIX
TV and Hoover Senior Fellow Edward Lazear, will be
picked up via satellite by approximately 150 public
broadcasting stations.
"As a courtesy to Stanford," Raisian added, "we
decided to make it available to the campus and put it
on SUNet, which is linked to various dormitories
and Meyer Library."
The panel is the culmination of a three-day con
ference "Out of the Red: Economic Transition in
Eastern Europe," which began on Wednesday with
talks about privatization, financial markets, cur
rency convertibility and the reduced role of the
Soviet Union in Eastern European economies.
Bill Free, one of the executive producers of the
conference, said mostly businesses and colleges are
scheduled to receive the signal, but Canadian
embassies and select locations in Mexico will also
view the broadcast.
"Even more exciting," Free added, "World Net
will be taping the conference and running it in all of
the Eastern European countries involved on Mon
day."
