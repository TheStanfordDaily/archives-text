# Fetter's successor to be announced at Commencement
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
The name of Jean Fetter's suc
cessor as dean of undergraduate
admissions will be announced at
Commencement, June 16, accord
ing to members of the committee
searching for her replacement.
The committee will make its
final recommendation to Vice
President for Student Resources
Sally Mahoney by June 4, said
Nadine O'Leary, administrative
assistant to acting Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson.
Robinson is one of the committee
members.
Mahoney, who was out of town
yesterday and could not be
reached for comment, will make
the final decision on the new
dean.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips,
one of the search committee mem
bers, said he thinks announcing
the new dean at Commencement
is intended as a public farewell to
Fetter. "The feeling was we'd like
to announce it this academic year,
while [Fetter] is still in office,"
Phillips said.
The committee, consisting of
several faculty members and
Council of Presidents member
Goodwin Liu, first met April 29
and has held one meeting since.
The committee is chaired by Dean
of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow.
O'Leary said the committee
has already pared down a list of
more than 60 candidates by one

third.
By the last week of May, five or
six finalists will be chosen,
O'Leary said. These finalists will
be on campus for public presenta
tions and interviews. The commit
tee will then make its final recom
mendation.

"We have some amazing candi
dates," Liu said. "It will be very
difficult to make a decision."
He added that the candidates
have a "variety of strengths,"
which will make it "very difficult
to apply criteria across the
board."
The committee will have only a
month to make its decision, a
timetable that O'Leary said is
"very short."
"It's going to be a fairly hectic
couple of weeks," Phillips said.
The short deadline "will
require the committee members
to be very diligent, but the com
mittee is up to the task," Liu said.
