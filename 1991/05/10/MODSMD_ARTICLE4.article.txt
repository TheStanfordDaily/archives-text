# Warsh named next ASSU Senate chair
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Junior Kevin Warsh was
elected chair of the 22nd ASSU
Senate last night in a series of
votes that some senators-elect
claimed left little time for debate.
In the final ballot, Warsh
defeated this year's chair, junior
Solina Kwan, 12-8. Other candi
dates included senator Jason
Moore and senior Keith Rabois,
who will attend Stanford Law
School next year.
Each candidate spoke and
answered questions for 20 min
utes before debate began over who
would serve best in the most pow
erful senate position.
Next year's senators voted
three times with no candidate
receiving a m*\jority, but a fourth
ballot allowing senators to rank
candidates resulted in Warsh's
election. The senators then unan
imously voted to confirm Warsh's
election.
Freshman Virginia Rosas, who

will be a non-voting senator next
year, said she was upset by the
absence of substantial debate
between ballots. "We had three
votes within about five minutes,"
she said. "The votes went so
quickly without any debate."
Senate associate Nawwar Kas
rawi, a freshman, also said he
objected to the senators "ram
ming motions through" so that
the meeting would end by 10 p.m.
to avoid having to move to the
ASSU office from the Law School.
Warsh, who was a senator last
year, said he wants to concentrate
on "running the process and let
ting the senate take care of the
substance" because he believes
past chairs have used parliamen
tary procedure in "incredible and
arbitrary" ways.
"I will not be manipulated by
political parties," he said. "I do
not have an agenda."
However, some senators
expressed concern about Warsh's
ability to be non-partisan because
he helped organize Students First
and served as its first party chair
two years ago.
"Be careful not to make the
mistake that any of the candidates
are non-partisan," Council of
Presidents member Ingrid Nava
warned senators.
Warsh said he believes his job is
only to try to channel student
opinion. "Hopefully, we can put
the debate from this meeting
behind us and get the ASSU back
on track," he said.
Kwan, who is affiliated with
the People's Platform, said she
believes she has "made her mark"
at Stanford and will continue to
do so. "I set the groundwork for
anybody to be able to continue,"
she said.
She was severely criticized by
several of this year's senators for
allegedly cutting off debate during
senate meetings this year. During
the questioning period, Peter
Thiel, who will be a graduate sen
ator next year, accused Kwan of
"bending and breaking the rules
to advance the People's Plat
form."
Graduate senator James Vera

said during the debate that he
believed it "would be a mistake to
elect her as senate chair" because
she "would skip over senators she
did not want to allow to speak"
during senate meetings this year.
But senator Leina Johansson
defended Kwan. "Solina is easy to
criticize because she has been
here," she said, adding that "there
are some people who talk forever
at a meeting and need to be cut
off."
Moore, a junior, also came

under fire by several senators for
what they called his "loss of con
trol" during meetings. "I am wor
ried about your ability to main
tain order," said Johansson,
adding that Moore has "often lost
his temper" in senate meetings.
But Moore said that while he
has "spoken with passion," he has
never been out of control.
He promised during his speech
that he would "never ask the sen
ate to suspend the Bylaws" and
criticized past senate chairs for
failing to make clear what was
being voted on.
Also, he said he would like to
see more senators become familiar
with the ASSU Constitution and
Bylaws and start meetings earlier
if they are going to be long. "It is
impossible to conduct a fair meet
ing ... in the (Law School) court
yard," he said.
After the final vote, Moore
wished next year's senate luck. "I
am satisfied that I said what I
wanted to say and what I believed
in,"he said.
Several senators said they wor
ried that Rabois, who has been
involved with the College Republi
cans and The Stanford Review,
would not be able to be non-parti
san.
