## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
Junior Kevin Warsh was
elected chair of the 22nd ASSU
Senate last night in a series of
votes that some senators-elect
claimed left little time for debate.
In the final ballot, Warsh
defeated this year's chair, junior
Solina Kwan, 12-8. Other candi
dates included senator Jason
Moore and senior Keith Rabois,
who will attend Stanford Law
School next year.
Each candidate spoke and
answered questions for 20 min
utes before debate began over who
would serve best in the most pow
erful senate position.
Next year's senators voted
three times with no candidate
receiving a m*\jority, but a fourth
ballot allowing senators to rank
candidates resulted in Warsh's
election. The senators then unan
imously voted to confirm Warsh's
election.
Freshman Virginia Rosas, who

will be a non-voting senator next
year, said she was upset by the
absence of substantial debate
between ballots. "We had three
votes within about five minutes,"
she said. "The votes went so
quickly without any debate."
Senate associate Nawwar Kas
rawi, a freshman, also said he
objected to the senators "ram
ming motions through" so that
the meeting would end by 10 p.m.
to avoid having to move to the
ASSU office from the Law School.
Warsh, who was a senator last
year, said he wants to concentrate
on "running the process and let
ting the senate take care of the
substance" because he believes
past chairs have used parliamen
tary procedure in "incredible and
arbitrary" ways.
"I will not be manipulated by
political parties," he said. "I do
not have an agenda."
However, some senators
expressed concern about Warsh's
