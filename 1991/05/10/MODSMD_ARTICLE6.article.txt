# Hearing scolds schools on costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Questions about whether Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices are
unique among research universi
ties were resoundingly answered
yesterday in a congressional hear
ing held by Rep. John Dingell.
In testimony before the Michi
gan Democrat's House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investi
gations, federal auditors said the\
had found more than $14 million
worth of inappropriate charges at
a dozen schools besides Stanford.
Among the items auditors said
had been included in bills to the
government as indirect costs oi
research:
• $20,490 for the chauffeuring
of Dartmouth's president and his
wife,
• The salary of the president's
cook at MIT,
• $25,000 for use of a chartered
aircraft by the president of Cor
nell University, and
• Air fare for the University of
Pittsburgh's president's wife for
trips to Grand Cayman Island.
"For too long, federal research
funds have been treated as a cash
cow for the universities," Dingell
said in his opening statement. But
he said universities were begin
ning to recognize that "there are
limits to what the taxpayers will
tolerate."
"I believe universities now
understand that this is a new day
and that all overhead charges they
make to the government must
relate to government-funded
research rather than merely sup
port a country club lifestyle," he
said.
Dingell's subcommittee held a
punishing seven-hour hearing in
mid-March that focused exclu
sively on Stanford's practices. Yes
terday's hearing focused primar
ily on findings from other schools,
but several Stanford-related
issues surfaced.
He praised "the excellent
work" of Paul Biddle, the Navy
regulator who alleged last fall that
Stanford had overcharged the
government for indirect costs by
$200 million during the last
decade.
A substantial amount of dis
cussion also centered around the
$924,517 check Stanford deliv
ered to the government yesterday.
The amount covers hard-to
explain expenses associated with
the operation of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's home, as
well as accounting errors related
to the yacht Victoria and the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
"Although this is but a down
payment on what Stanford owes
the government for 10 years of
overcharging and mischarging, it
is a step in the right direction,"
Dingell said.
But Rear Adm. William Miller,
chief of naval research, testified

that the check was unacceptable
because it was not large enough to
cover all the charges Stanford had
announced it would withdraw.
The issue was quickly resolved
after the hearing, however, and
resulted in Stanford writing a sec
ond check for $105,600.
Under normal practice,
accounting errors are corrected
through "adjusting the carryfor
ward" — that is, crediting or
deducting the amount from

future reimbursements from
federal granting agencies.
But two weeks ago, federal
auditors requested Stanford pay
by check. Stanford agreed to do so
as "a special accommodation to
the government," according to a
letter written by University Coun
sel Debra Zumwalt.
Stanford officials maintain
that the University did not over
charge the government during the
last decade.
