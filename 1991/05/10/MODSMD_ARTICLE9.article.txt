# Theta Delt pledges remain in spotlight
## They miss deadline to confirm single fraternity membership 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
Theta Delta Chi pledges did
not submit by yesterday's
deadline special housing cards
guaranteeing that they were
only joining that fraternity,
according to Row Director Jack
Chin.
The guarantee cards were
created in response to concerns
that some Alpha Epsilon Pi
pledges were also planning to
join the Theta Delts to secure a
house in the future for the
AEPis. The rumored move
would also allow the Theta
Delts to recruit enough new
members to prevent their
house from being placed in the
Draw. The Theta Delts had
failed to fill their quota for the
previous three years.
Row Director Jack Chin said
yesterday that he had not
received any signed cards from
Theta Delt pledges. "I made it
clear to Theta Delt members
where they could pick up the
cards," Chin said. He said he
also told fraternity officers
twice that the deadline was 8
a.m. yesterday
Originally the deadline was
set for 5 p.m. Wednesday, but
Chin extended it to give pledges
"time to think about what they
were signing." Chin and five
other administrators will meet

this afternoon with the Theta
Delt leadership to discuss the
matter.
According to Interfraternity
Council Vice President and
AEPi member Keith Rabois,
more than 10 AEPi pledges
were also planning to join the
Theta Delts as of Tuesday
night.
Theta Delt Resident Assis
tant Samer Hamadeh said the
fraternity is waiting to decide
how to respond to the guaran
tee cards until it meets with
University officials.
"The sense of urgency of the
matter has made it difficult for
the fraternity to respond at
this time," he said.
Chin said the cards were
issued "out of a concern that
the house be occupied by bona
fide Theta Delta Chi members.
. . . Houses are specifically for
members, and we need verifica
tion of that," Chin said.
He would not elaborate on
what he meant by "bona fide,"
but said, "It does not necessar
ily mean that one belong exclu
sively to one fraternity."
"Changes in pledge policy
may determine whether or not
the Theta Delts meet their
pledge quota this year," said
Chin. He refused to comment
further until after the meeting.
Theta Delta Chi President
Rob Tymoczko was unavailable
for comment.
