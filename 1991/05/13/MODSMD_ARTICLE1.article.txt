# Still the best
## Stanford buries surprising Bruins in singles to claim a sixth straight NCAA title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Leading 4-1 in the third set of her No. 6
singles match, Kylie Johnson could have
been thinking about a whole lot of things.
First of all, she had 2,000 people watch
ing her, perhaps more than had ever
focused on one individual court at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Women's Tennis
Secondly, the Cardinal led UCLA 4-1 at
the time. If Johnson could hold off the Bru
ins' Cammie Foley, Stanford would clinch
the match in singles.
And this was no ordinary match, it was
an NCAA Championship final — Stanford's
sixth such contest in six years.
So what was going through Kylie John
son's head at the time? "I wanted to end the
match with a volley," she said afterward.
Four games later, with Foley serving at
4-5, ad out, the crafty Bruin tried to loft one
past a charging Johnson on the backhand
side. Johnson put her racket up, met the
ball square and returned it deep to the
other side of the court.
Foley could do little more than stab at it.
Her shot sailed well beyond the baseline. It
was break point. Set point. Match point.
National championship point.
The Stanford women's tennis team had
become the first host school to win the

NCAA Championship. For the Cardinal,
that meant an unbelievable sixth straight
national title and eight of the 10 since the
NCAA first sponsored women's athletics
back in 1982.
Coach Frank Brennan, the man behind
the dynasty, was surprisingly nonplussed
by it all. "It's still kind of shocking," said
the normally unflappable Brennan. "It's
sort of fantasyland. 1 can't believe we pull
this thing off every year."
For three years, they've been pulling it
off quite easily. Brennan's team, which
many felt was vulnerable before the tourna
ment began, had won all four of its matches
in singles despite nearly competing without
its No. 1 player.
Brennan said he asked his assistant
coach, Lele Forood: "We didn't play dou
bles?" No they didn't, despite having to go
with a less-than-healthy Sandra Birch, who
did not win a match in the team competi
tion and may have to skip the individual
singles and doubles.
Birch contracted a stomach virus early
Tuesday morning and could not play at all
until Saturday's semifinals against Geor
gia. She defaulted her match to Shannan
McCarthy midway through the second set
— after the Cardinal had clinched the win.
Yesterday, Birch faced a red-hot Kim
berly Po and hung in for awhile, narrowly
dropping the first set 7-5 before getting
buzz-sawed in the second 6-1.
"It was very disappointing, very frus
trating," Birch said of her physical trou
bles. She was visibly upset that after a sea-

son of hard work, she couldn't do
more with the national title on the
line.
One thing perked up her spirits
as she played yesterday, though.
"It was definitely a good feeling to
look up at the scoreboard and see
we were winning all the other
matches," she said.
Her teammates, on the other
hand, were a little concerned for
their co-captain. "I was kind of
watching both courts," said junior
Debbie Graham, explaining her
attention was divided between her
match and Birch's on the adjacent
court.
Said senior co-captain Teri
Whitlinger: "It was a little hard
watching Sandra." But everyone
was especially glad she was out
there at all. Back in 1988, the Car
dinal played NCAAs with its then-
No. 1 player, Tami Whitlinger, on
the sidelines. They won the tour
nament, but it required a Her
culean effort.
"It was a little bit better (than
'881," Teri Whitlinger said of the

year her twin sister couldn't go.
"At least we had our No. 1 player
out there this time. At least San
dra had a chance to win."
But Birch's presence in the
lineup meant so much more to
Stanford. It allowed everyone else
to remain in their normal spots
instead of forcing them to move
up. "We feel comfortable playing
in our normal positions. We feel
confident," Whitlinger said.
Were Birch unable to play,
Stanford might not have won in
singles — or at all for that matter.
With everyone in their usual spot,
though, the Cardinal could enter
the final feeling they had better
players than the Bruins at every
position. The end result proved
that true.
Stanford drew first blood at
No. 2 singles where Graham was
engaged in a see-saw battle with
Iwalani McCalla for a while. After
McCalla broke Graham to tie the
first set at 4-4, however, Graham
took charge. First, she captured
the set 6-4, then she used three
breaks to move up 5-2 in the sec
ond.

Graham found herself serving
for the match but McCalla wasn't
yet ready to quit. After Graham
won the first point, McCalla took
four straight to make it 5-3.
McCalla then won the first
point on her serve before Graham
answered with three of her own to
get to double match point. After a
brief rally, Graham sent the ball
hard to McCalla's forehand and
the UCLA junior's return landed
just long. Stanford 1, UCLA 0.
Birch was already in trouble
and things were about to turn
worse. Suffering from stomach
cramps and an empty fuel tank,
she soon succumbed. Po had
evened the match. Stanford 1,
UCLA 1.
But the Cardinal had good
news on the back courts. Fresh
man Laxmi Poruri and sophomore
Heather Willens were well ahead
and ready to close things out.
Poruri had won the first set 6-3
over Mamie Ceniza and was up a
break at 5-2.
Like McCalla before her,
Ceniza was serving and facing
match point when a deep ball to

the forehand side was upon her.
Ceniza sent it over the baseline
and Poruri had given the Cardinal
a lead it would not relinquish.
Stanford 2, UCLA 1.
Almost immediately, Willens
had a break point against Kirsten
Dreyer and a 5-4 lead in set two.
Willens had already captured the
first set 6-2. This time, though,
one match point wouldn't do the
trick.
Dreyer came back to hold and
tie things at 5-5. Willens also held
to again move within one game.
With Dreyer again serving, Wil
lens quickly pushed the score to
15-40 — two more match points.
A nearly unreturnable serve
saved the first match point but
when Dreyer approached on the
second Willens passed her with a
backhand. Willens had won her
eighth NCAA match in eight tries
and the Cardinal was building an
insurmountable lead. Stanford 3,
UCLA 1.
Things did get a bit dicey at
that point for the five-time
defending champs. Johnson and
Teri Whitlinger, who had each
won their first sets, were both
down in the second. Stella Sam
pras, a four-year veteran like
Whitlinger, was challenging the
Stanford star at No. 3. Leading 5-
3, Sampras broke Whitlinger to
force a third set.
Meanwhile, the aforemen
tioned Foley had banged her way
back into the match at No. 6.
When Johnson was broken to fall
behind 3-5 in set two, her chances
of a straight-set win slipped away
as well.
Stanford's prospects bright
ened again when Whitlinger used
a perfect drop shot to go up 4-2 in
the third. In the next game, with
Sampras serving at 15-all, the
chair umpire reversed one of
Whitlinger's line call and the nor
mally cool All-American blew up.
She argued vehemently and
threw her racket in disgust. "I
thought it was out," Whitlinger
said later. "I don't think the
umpire has any business overrul
ing there. I was a little frustrated
and then the racket went on the
ground," she added with a grin.
"I didn't want the umpire to
take anything away from me
that's mine."
Sure enough, he couldn't.
Whitlinger picked up the racket
and decided it was time to play. "I
think it motivated me a little
more," she said of the incident.
Whatever the reason, she
recovered in time to hold serve
and take a 5-3 advantage. With

Sampras serving in the next game
at 15-15, Whitlinger passed her.
Sampras then hit a backhand that
failed to clear the net, making it
15-40 — double match point.
On the ensuing rally, Sampras
put a forehand into the doubles
alley and Teri Whitlinger's bril
liant Stanford dual-match career
— one in which she won a phe
nomenal 101 times while losing
just six — ended with a victory.
Stanford 4, UCLA 1.
The Cardinal women ran over
to hug Whitlinger. And, before she
could catch her breath, they
dragged her over to watch the
drama unfolding on Court 7.
The seats in the main stadium,
which had been filled to capacity
just minutes before, were sud
denly empty. The temporary
bleachers on Court 5 were packed
with spectators.
Those with stadium seats
climbed to the top level so they
could look over the back courts.
Every square inch of available
railing was occupied by somebody
trying to catch a glimpse of an
NCAA Championship in the mak
ing.
"It was kind of funny," John
son said. "I have my own little
bleachers (just off Court 7) and
usually have 20 people out there."
The inside joke is that it's "Kylie's
Korner" out there and Johnson
almost never disappoints the
faithful. She has lost on her per
sonal court just three times in
three years.
This time Kylie's Korner may
as well have been Centre Court at
Wimbledon with all the attention
it was getting. "My little cornel
grew into a vast sea of people,"
Johnson said. About one hundred
times as many fans as typically
watch Johnson — including all
the Stanford players — sat with

rapt attention to observe her bat
tle.
When Foley broke to cut John
son's lead to 4-3, Willens told her
teammates: "You guys, get ready
to play doubles. Assume you're
playing doubles."
It wasn't so much that Willens
didn't believe in Johnson as the
fact the she wanted her team
mates to be prepared. Oh, and
truth be told, Johnson seemed to
be in more than a little bit of dan
ger.
Graham attracted the atten
tion of Forood, who was in charge
of coaching Johnson, and told her
to suggest playing to Foley's fore
hand. Forood answered that she
already told Johnson that — on
several occasions.
The problem was that Johnson
was hearing but not listening. Her
lead, which was once 4-1, had sud
denly evaporated. "The gag factor
choked in for about three games,"
she said. "I kind of lost focus on
the match."
Things became clear again
soon enough to set up the champi
onship-winning volley. 'Three
days before nationals, I changed
my grip (on the volley)," Johnson
said. "People thought I was really
stupid to do that."
Indeed, one would have to be
borderline crazy to scrap years of
practice on the volley less than a
week before the NCAA tourna
ment. Crazy enough to block out
the huge crowd and the pressure.
Crazy enough to want to hit the
clinching shot with the new,
improved volley.
Crazy enough, even, to hit the
volley perfectly when it counted.
To give Stanford one more cham
pionship. To keep the streak alive
at six.
And counting.

a lead it would not relinquish.
Stanford 2, UCLA 1.
Almost immediately, Willens
had a break point against Kirsten
Dreyer and a 5-4 lead in set two.
Willens had already captured the
first set 6-2. This time, though,
one match point wouldn't do the
trick.
Dreyer came back to hold and
tie things at 5-5. Willens also held
to again move within one game.
With Dreyer again serving, Wil
lens quickly pushed the score to
15-40 — two more match points.
A nearly unreturnable serve
saved the first match point but
when Dreyer approached on the
second Willens passed her with a
backhand. Willens had won her
eighth NCAA match in eight tries
and the Cardinal was building an
insurmountable lead. Stanford 3,
UCLA 1.
Things did get a bit dicey at
that point for the five-time
defending champs. Johnson and
Teri Whitlinger, who had each
won their first sets, were both
down in the second. Stella Sam
pras, a four-year veteran like
Whitlinger, was challenging the
Stanford star at No. 3. Leading 5-
3, Sampras broke Whitlinger to
force a third set.
Meanwhile, the aforemen
tioned Foley had banged her way
back into the match at No. 6.
When Johnson was broken to fall
behind 3-5 in set two, her chances
of a straight-set win slipped away
as well.
Stanford's prospects bright
ened again when Whitlinger used
a perfect drop shot to go up 4-2 in
the third. In the next game, with
Sampras serving at 15-all, the
chair umpire reversed one of
Whitlinger's line call and the nor
mally cool All-American blew up.
She argued vehemently and
threw her racket in disgust. "I
thought it was out," Whitlinger
said later. "I don't think the
umpire has any business overrul
ing there. I was a little frustrated
and then the racket went on the
ground," she added with a grin.
"I didn't want the umpire to
take anything away from me
that's mine."
Sure enough, he couldn't.
Whitlinger picked up the racket
and decided it was time to play. "I
think it motivated me a little
more," she said of the incident.
Whatever the reason, she
recovered in time to hold serve
and take a 5-3 advantage. With

Sampras serving in the next game
at 15-15, Whitlinger passed her.
Sampras then hit a backhand that
failed to clear the net, making it
15-40 — double match point.
On the ensuing rally, Sampras
put a forehand into the doubles
alley and Teri Whitlinger's bril
liant Stanford dual-match career
— one in which she won a phe
nomenal 101 times while losing
just six — ended with a victory.
Stanford 4, UCLA 1.
The Cardinal women ran over
to hug Whitlinger. And, before she
could catch her breath, they
dragged her over to watch the
drama unfolding on Court 7.
The seats in the main stadium,
which had been filled to capacity
just minutes before, were sud
denly empty. The temporary
bleachers on Court 5 were packed
with spectators.
Those with stadium seats
climbed to the top level so they
could look over the back courts.
Every square inch of available
railing was occupied by somebody
trying to catch a glimpse of an
NCAA Championship in the mak
ing.
"It was kind of funny," John
son said. "I have my own little
bleachers (just off Court 7) and
usually have 20 people out there."
The inside joke is that it's "Kylie's
Korner" out there and Johnson
almost never disappoints the
faithful. She has lost on her per
sonal court just three times in
three years.
This time Kylie's Korner may
as well have been Centre Court at
Wimbledon with all the attention
it was getting. "My little cornel
grew into a vast sea of people,"
Johnson said. About one hundred
times as many fans as typically
watch Johnson — including all
the Stanford players — sat with

rapt attention to observe her bat
tle.
When Foley broke to cut John
son's lead to 4-3, Willens told her
teammates: "You guys, get ready
to play doubles. Assume you're
playing doubles."
It wasn't so much that Willens
didn't believe in Johnson as the
fact the she wanted her team
mates to be prepared. Oh, and
truth be told, Johnson seemed to
be in more than a little bit of dan
ger.
Graham attracted the atten
tion of Forood, who was in charge
of coaching Johnson, and told her
to suggest playing to Foley's fore
hand. Forood answered that she
already told Johnson that — on
several occasions.
The problem was that Johnson
was hearing but not listening. Her
lead, which was once 4-1, had sud
denly evaporated. "The gag factor
choked in for about three games,"
she said. "I kind of lost focus on
the match."
Things became clear again
soon enough to set up the champi
onship-winning volley. 'Three
days before nationals, I changed
my grip (on the volley)," Johnson
said. "People thought I was really
stupid to do that."
Indeed, one would have to be
borderline crazy to scrap years of
practice on the volley less than a
week before the NCAA tourna
ment. Crazy enough to block out
the huge crowd and the pressure.
Crazy enough to want to hit the
clinching shot with the new,
improved volley.
Crazy enough, even, to hit the
volley perfectly when it counted.
To give Stanford one more cham
pionship. To keep the streak alive
at six.
And counting.

Teri Whitlinger, right, receives a hug from twin sister Tami after posting a three-set victory over UCLA's
Stella Sampras yesterday. Teri Whitlinger closed out her career with four NCAA team titles, a 101 -6 over
all dual-match record and a 14-match win streak in NCAA team competition.
Leading 4-1 in the third set of her No. 6
singles match, Kylie Johnson could have
been thinking about a whole lot of things.
First of all, she had 2,000 people watch
ing her, perhaps more than had ever
focused on one individual court at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Women's Tennis
Secondly, the Cardinal led UCLA 4-1 at
the time. If Johnson could hold off the Bru
ins' Cammie Foley, Stanford would clinch
the match in singles.
And this was no ordinary match, it was
an NCAA Championship final — Stanford's
sixth such contest in six years.
So what was going through Kylie John
son's head at the time? "I wanted to end the
match with a volley," she said afterward.
Four games later, with Foley serving at
4-5, ad out, the crafty Bruin tried to loft one
past a charging Johnson on the backhand
side. Johnson put her racket up, met the
ball square and returned it deep to the
other side of the court.
Foley could do little more than stab at it.
Her shot sailed well beyond the baseline. It
was break point. Set point. Match point.
National championship point.
The Stanford women's tennis team had
become the first host school to win the

NCAA Championship. For the Cardinal,
that meant an unbelievable sixth straight
national title and eight of the 10 since the
NCAA first sponsored women's athletics
back in 1982.
Coach Frank Brennan, the man behind
the dynasty, was surprisingly nonplussed
by it all. "It's still kind of shocking," said
the normally unflappable Brennan. "It's
sort of fantasyland. 1 can't believe we pull
this thing off every year."
For three years, they've been pulling it
off quite easily. Brennan's team, which
many felt was vulnerable before the tourna
ment began, had won all four of its matches
in singles despite nearly competing without
its No. 1 player.
Brennan said he asked his assistant
coach, Lele Forood: "We didn't play dou
bles?" No they didn't, despite having to go
with a less-than-healthy Sandra Birch, who
did not win a match in the team competi
tion and may have to skip the individual
singles and doubles.
Birch contracted a stomach virus early
Tuesday morning and could not play at all
until Saturday's semifinals against Geor
gia. She defaulted her match to Shannan
McCarthy midway through the second set
— after the Cardinal had clinched the win.
Yesterday, Birch faced a red-hot Kim
berly Po and hung in for awhile, narrowly
dropping the first set 7-5 before getting
buzz-sawed in the second 6-1.
"It was very disappointing, very frus
trating," Birch said of her physical trou
bles. She was visibly upset that after a sea-

nis Stadium. The Cardinal, which has won six consecutive NCAA crowns, becomes the first host team to ever win the title.
son of hard work, she couldn't do
more with the national title on the
line.
One thing perked up her spirits
as she played yesterday, though.
"It was definitely a good feeling to
look up at the scoreboard and see
we were winning all the other
matches," she said.
Her teammates, on the other
hand, were a little concerned for
their co-captain. "I was kind of
watching both courts," said junior
Debbie Graham, explaining her
attention was divided between her
match and Birch's on the adjacent
court.
Said senior co-captain Teri
Whitlinger: "It was a little hard
watching Sandra." But everyone
was especially glad she was out
there at all. Back in 1988, the Car
dinal played NCAAs with its then-
No. 1 player, Tami Whitlinger, on
the sidelines. They won the tour
nament, but it required a Her
culean effort.
"It was a little bit better (than
'881," Teri Whitlinger said of the

year her twin sister couldn't go.
"At least we had our No. 1 player
out there this time. At least San
dra had a chance to win."
But Birch's presence in the
lineup meant so much more to
Stanford. It allowed everyone else
to remain in their normal spots
instead of forcing them to move
up. "We feel comfortable playing
in our normal positions. We feel
confident," Whitlinger said.
Were Birch unable to play,
Stanford might not have won in
singles — or at all for that matter.
With everyone in their usual spot,
though, the Cardinal could enter
the final feeling they had better
players than the Bruins at every
position. The end result proved
that true.
Stanford drew first blood at
No. 2 singles where Graham was
engaged in a see-saw battle with
Iwalani McCalla for a while. After
McCalla broke Graham to tie the
first set at 4-4, however, Graham
took charge. First, she captured
the set 6-4, then she used three
breaks to move up 5-2 in the sec
ond.

Graham found herself serving
for the match but McCalla wasn't
yet ready to quit. After Graham
won the first point, McCalla took
four straight to make it 5-3.
McCalla then won the first
point on her serve before Graham
answered with three of her own to
get to double match point. After a
brief rally, Graham sent the ball
hard to McCalla's forehand and
the UCLA junior's return landed
just long. Stanford 1, UCLA 0.
Birch was already in trouble
and things were about to turn
worse. Suffering from stomach
cramps and an empty fuel tank,
she soon succumbed. Po had
evened the match. Stanford 1,
UCLA 1.
But the Cardinal had good
news on the back courts. Fresh
man Laxmi Poruri and sophomore
Heather Willens were well ahead
and ready to close things out.
Poruri had won the first set 6-3
over Mamie Ceniza and was up a
break at 5-2.
Like McCalla before her,
Ceniza was serving and facing
match point when a deep ball to

the forehand side was upon her.
Ceniza sent it over the baseline
and Poruri had given the Cardinal
a lead it would not relinquish.
Stanford 2, UCLA 1.
Almost immediately, Willens
had a break point against Kirsten
Dreyer and a 5-4 lead in set two.
Willens had already captured the
first set 6-2. This time, though,
one match point wouldn't do the
trick.
Dreyer came back to hold and
tie things at 5-5. Willens also held
to again move within one game.
With Dreyer again serving, Wil
lens quickly pushed the score to
15-40 — two more match points.
A nearly unreturnable serve
saved the first match point but
when Dreyer approached on the
second Willens passed her with a
backhand. Willens had won her
eighth NCAA match in eight tries
and the Cardinal was building an
insurmountable lead. Stanford 3,
UCLA 1.
Things did get a bit dicey at
that point for the five-time
defending champs. Johnson and
Teri Whitlinger, who had each
won their first sets, were both
down in the second. Stella Sam
pras, a four-year veteran like
Whitlinger, was challenging the
Stanford star at No. 3. Leading 5-
3, Sampras broke Whitlinger to
force a third set.
Meanwhile, the aforemen
tioned Foley had banged her way
back into the match at No. 6.
When Johnson was broken to fall
behind 3-5 in set two, her chances
of a straight-set win slipped away
as well.
Stanford's prospects bright
ened again when Whitlinger used
a perfect drop shot to go up 4-2 in
the third. In the next game, with
Sampras serving at 15-all, the
chair umpire reversed one of
Whitlinger's line call and the nor
mally cool All-American blew up.
She argued vehemently and
threw her racket in disgust. "I

said later. "I don't think the
umpire has any business overrul

and then the racket went on the
ground," she added with a grin.
"I didn't want the umpire to
take anything away from me

Sure enough, he couldn't.
Whitlinger picked up the racket
and decided it was time to play. "I
think it motivated me a little
more," she said of the incident.
Whatever the reason, she
recovered in time to hold serve
and take a 5-3 advantage. With

Sampras serving in the next game
at 15-15, Whitlinger passed her.
Sampras then hit a backhand that
failed to clear the net, making it
15-40 — double match point.
On the ensuing rally, Sampras
put a forehand into the doubles
alley and Teri Whitlinger's bril
liant Stanford dual-match career
— one in which she won a phe
nomenal 101 times while losing
just six — ended with a victory.
Stanford 4, UCLA 1.
The Cardinal women ran over
to hug Whitlinger. And, before she
could catch her breath, they

First of all, she had 2,000 people watch
ing her, perhaps more than had ever
focused on one individual court at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Women's Tennis
Secondly, the Cardinal led UCLA 4-1 at
the time. If Johnson could hold off the Bru
ins' Cammie Foley, Stanford would clinch
the match in singles.
And this was no ordinary match, it was
an NCAA Championship final — Stanford's
sixth such contest in six years.
So what was going through Kylie John
son's head at the time? "I wanted to end the
match with a volley," she said afterward.
Four games later, with Foley serving at
4-5, ad out, the crafty Bruin tried to loft one
past a charging Johnson on the backhand
side. Johnson put her racket up, met the
ball square and returned it deep to the
other side of the court.
Foley could do little more than stab at it.
Her shot sailed well beyond the baseline. It
was break point. Set point. Match point.
National championship point.
The Stanford women's tennis team had
become the first host school to win the

NCAA Championship. For the Cardinal,
that meant an unbelievable sixth straight
national title and eight of the 10 since the
NCAA first sponsored women's athletics
back in 1982.
Coach Frank Brennan, the man behind
the dynasty, was surprisingly nonplussed
by it all. "It's still kind of shocking," said
the normally unflappable Brennan. "It's
sort of fantasyland. 1 can't believe we pull
this thing off every year."
For three years, they've been pulling it
off quite easily. Brennan's team, which
many felt was vulnerable before the tourna
ment began, had won all four of its matches
in singles despite nearly competing without
its No. 1 player.
Brennan said he asked his assistant
coach, Lele Forood: "We didn't play dou
bles?" No they didn't, despite having to go
with a less-than-healthy Sandra Birch, who
did not win a match in the team competi
tion and may have to skip the individual
singles and doubles.
Birch contracted a stomach virus early
Tuesday morning and could not play at all
until Saturday's semifinals against Geor
gia. She defaulted her match to Shannan
McCarthy midway through the second set
— after the Cardinal had clinched the win.
Yesterday, Birch faced a red-hot Kim
berly Po and hung in for awhile, narrowly
dropping the first set 7-5 before getting
buzz-sawed in the second 6-1.
"It was very disappointing, very frus
trating," Birch said of her physical trou
bles. She was visibly upset that after a sea-

son of hard work, she couldn't do
more with the national title on the
line.
One thing perked up her spirits
as she played yesterday, though.
"It was definitely a good feeling to
look up at the scoreboard and see
we were winning all the other
matches," she said.
Her teammates, on the other
hand, were a little concerned for
their co-captain. "I was kind of
watching both courts," said junior
Debbie Graham, explaining her
attention was divided between her
match and Birch's on the adjacent
court.
Said senior co-captain Teri
Whitlinger: "It was a little hard
watching Sandra." But everyone
was especially glad she was out
there at all. Back in 1988, the Car
dinal played NCAAs with its then-
No. 1 player, Tami Whitlinger, on
the sidelines. They won the tour
nament, but it required a Her
culean effort.
"It was a little bit better (than
'881," Teri Whitlinger said of the

year her twin sister couldn't go.
"At least we had our No. 1 player
out there this time. At least San
dra had a chance to win."
But Birch's presence in the
lineup meant so much more to
Stanford. It allowed everyone else
to remain in their normal spots
instead of forcing them to move
up. "We feel comfortable playing
in our normal positions. We feel
confident," Whitlinger said.
Were Birch unable to play,
Stanford might not have won in
singles — or at all for that matter.
With everyone in their usual spot,
though, the Cardinal could enter
the final feeling they had better
players than the Bruins at every
position. The end result proved
that true.
Stanford drew first blood at
No. 2 singles where Graham was
engaged in a see-saw battle with
Iwalani McCalla for a while. After
McCalla broke Graham to tie the
first set at 4-4, however, Graham
took charge. First, she captured
the set 6-4, then she used three
breaks to move up 5-2 in the sec
ond.

Graham found herself serving
for the match but McCalla wasn't
yet ready to quit. After Graham
won the first point, McCalla took
four straight to make it 5-3.
McCalla then won the first
point on her serve before Graham
answered with three of her own to
get to double match point. After a
brief rally, Graham sent the ball
hard to McCalla's forehand and
the UCLA junior's return landed
just long. Stanford 1, UCLA 0.
Birch was already in trouble
and things were about to turn
worse. Suffering from stomach
cramps and an empty fuel tank,
she soon succumbed. Po had
evened the match. Stanford 1,
UCLA 1.
But the Cardinal had good
news on the back courts. Fresh
man Laxmi Poruri and sophomore
Heather Willens were well ahead
and ready to close things out.
Poruri had won the first set 6-3
over Mamie Ceniza and was up a
break at 5-2.
Like McCalla before her,
Ceniza was serving and facing
match point when a deep ball to

the forehand side was upon her.
Ceniza sent it over the baseline
and Poruri had given the Cardinal
a lead it would not relinquish.
Stanford 2, UCLA 1.
Almost immediately, Willens
had a break point against Kirsten
Dreyer and a 5-4 lead in set two.
Willens had already captured the
first set 6-2. This time, though,
one match point wouldn't do the
trick.
Dreyer came back to hold and
tie things at 5-5. Willens also held
to again move within one game.
With Dreyer again serving, Wil
lens quickly pushed the score to
15-40 — two more match points.
A nearly unreturnable serve
saved the first match point but
when Dreyer approached on the
second Willens passed her with a
backhand. Willens had won her
eighth NCAA match in eight tries
and the Cardinal was building an
insurmountable lead. Stanford 3,
UCLA 1.
Things did get a bit dicey at
that point for the five-time
defending champs. Johnson and
Teri Whitlinger, who had each
won their first sets, were both
down in the second. Stella Sam
pras, a four-year veteran like
Whitlinger, was challenging the
Stanford star at No. 3. Leading 5-
3, Sampras broke Whitlinger to
force a third set.
Meanwhile, the aforemen
tioned Foley had banged her way
back into the match at No. 6.
When Johnson was broken to fall
behind 3-5 in set two, her chances
of a straight-set win slipped away
as well.
Stanford's prospects bright
ened again when Whitlinger used
a perfect drop shot to go up 4-2 in
the third. In the next game, with
Sampras serving at 15-all, the
chair umpire reversed one of
Whitlinger's line call and the nor
mally cool All-American blew up.
She argued vehemently and
threw her racket in disgust. "I
thought it was out," Whitlinger
said later. "I don't think the
umpire has any business overrul
ing there. I was a little frustrated
and then the racket went on the
ground," she added with a grin.
"I didn't want the umpire to
take anything away from me
that's mine."
Sure enough, he couldn't.
Whitlinger picked up the racket
and decided it was time to play. "I
think it motivated me a little
more," she said of the incident.
Whatever the reason, she
recovered in time to hold serve
and take a 5-3 advantage. With

Sampras serving in the next game
at 15-15, Whitlinger passed her.
Sampras then hit a backhand that
failed to clear the net, making it
15-40 — double match point.
On the ensuing rally, Sampras
put a forehand into the doubles
alley and Teri Whitlinger's bril
liant Stanford dual-match career
— one in which she won a phe
nomenal 101 times while losing
just six — ended with a victory.
Stanford 4, UCLA 1.
The Cardinal women ran over
to hug Whitlinger. And, before she
could catch her breath, they
dragged her over to watch the
drama unfolding on Court 7.
The seats in the main stadium,
which had been filled to capacity
just minutes before, were sud
denly empty. The temporary
bleachers on Court 5 were packed
with spectators.
Those with stadium seats
climbed to the top level so they
could look over the back courts.
Every square inch of available
railing was occupied by somebody
trying to catch a glimpse of an
NCAA Championship in the mak
ing.
"It was kind of funny," John
son said. "I have my own little
bleachers (just off Court 7) and
usually have 20 people out there."
The inside joke is that it's "Kylie's
Korner" out there and Johnson
almost never disappoints the
faithful. She has lost on her per
sonal court just three times in
three years.
This time Kylie's Korner may
as well have been Centre Court at
Wimbledon with all the attention
it was getting. "My little cornel
grew into a vast sea of people,"
Johnson said. About one hundred
times as many fans as typically
watch Johnson — including all
the Stanford players — sat with

rapt attention to observe her bat
tle.
When Foley broke to cut John
son's lead to 4-3, Willens told her
teammates: "You guys, get ready
to play doubles. Assume you're
playing doubles."
It wasn't so much that Willens
didn't believe in Johnson as the
fact the she wanted her team
mates to be prepared. Oh, and
truth be told, Johnson seemed to
be in more than a little bit of dan
ger.
Graham attracted the atten
tion of Forood, who was in charge
of coaching Johnson, and told her
to suggest playing to Foley's fore
hand. Forood answered that she
already told Johnson that — on
several occasions.
The problem was that Johnson
was hearing but not listening. Her
lead, which was once 4-1, had sud
denly evaporated. "The gag factor
choked in for about three games,"
she said. "I kind of lost focus on
the match."
Things became clear again
soon enough to set up the champi
onship-winning volley. 'Three
days before nationals, I changed
my grip (on the volley)," Johnson
said. "People thought I was really
stupid to do that."
Indeed, one would have to be
borderline crazy to scrap years of
practice on the volley less than a
week before the NCAA tourna
ment. Crazy enough to block out
the huge crowd and the pressure.
Crazy enough to want to hit the
clinching shot with the new,
improved volley.
Crazy enough, even, to hit the
volley perfectly when it counted.
To give Stanford one more cham
pionship. To keep the streak alive
at six.
And counting.
