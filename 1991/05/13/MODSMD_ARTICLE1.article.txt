## Stanford buries surprising Bruins in singles to claim a sixth straight NCAA title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Leading 4-1 in the third set of her No. 6
singles match, Kylie Johnson could have
been thinking about a whole lot of things.
First of all, she had 2,000 people watch
ing her, perhaps more than had ever
focused on one individual court at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.

Secondly, the Cardinal led UCLA 4-1 at
the time. If Johnson could hold off the Bru
ins' Cammie Foley, Stanford would clinch
the match in singles.
And this was no ordinary match, it was
an NCAA Championship final — Stanford's
sixth such contest in six years.
So what was going through Kylie John
son's head at the time? "I wanted to end the
match with a volley," she said afterward.
Four games later, with Foley serving at
4-5, ad out, the crafty Bruin tried to loft one
past a charging Johnson on the backhand
side. Johnson put her racket up, met the
ball square and returned it deep to the
other side of the court.
Foley could do little more than stab at it.
Her shot sailed well beyond the baseline. It
was break point. Set point. Match point.
National championship point.
The Stanford women's tennis team had
become the first host school to win the

NCAA Championship. For the Cardinal,
that meant an unbelievable sixth straight
national title and eight of the 10 since the
NCAA first sponsored women's athletics

Coach Frank Brennan, the man behind
the dynasty, was surprisingly nonplussed
by it all. "It's still kind of shocking," said
the normally unflappable Brennan. "It's
sort of fantasyland. 1 can't believe we pull
this thing off every year."
For three years, they've been pulling it
off quite easily. Brennan's team, which
many felt was vulnerable before the tourna
ment began, had won all four of its matches
in singles despite nearly competing without
its No. 1 player.
Brennan said he asked his assistant
coach, Lele Forood: "We didn't play dou
bles?" No they didn't, despite having to go
with a less-than-healthy Sandra Birch, who
did not win a match in the team competi
tion and may have to skip the individual
singles and doubles.
Birch contracted a stomach virus early
Tuesday morning and could not play at all
until Saturday's semifinals against Geor
gia. She defaulted her match to Shannan
McCarthy midway through the second set
— after the Cardinal had clinched the win.
Yesterday, Birch faced a red-hot Kim
berly Po and hung in for awhile, narrowly
dropping the first set 7-5 before getting
buzz-sawed in the second 6-1.
"It was very disappointing, very frus
trating," Birch said of her physical trou
