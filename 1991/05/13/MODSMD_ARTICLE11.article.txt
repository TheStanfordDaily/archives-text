Nepal holds multiparty election
KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) — People jammed
polling stations yesterday to vote in record
numbers in Nepal's first multiparty election in
more than three decades.
More than 70 percent of the electorate
turned out in constituencies for which figures
were available, poll officials said. In previous
votes, which mostly elected rubber-stamp
assemblies dominated by palace favorites, the
turnout did not surpass 62 percent.
First results are expected today. Results
from remote districts will not be available until
Friday, the government says.
Kurdish leader says guerrillas
and Iraq are near agreement
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — A Kurdish rebel
leader said yesterday that the guerrillas and
the government are nearing an agreement on
Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq.
Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic
Party, the largest Iraqi Kurdish opposition fac
tion, did not say when an agreement might be
announced, nor did he discuss the substance of
a week of talks with Iraqi officials.
But he said the negotiations were going
"very well."
Although Saddam's troops largely succeeded
in crushing both rebellions, he last month
agreed in principle to expanded autonomy for
Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds and to democratic
reforms throughout the country.
U.S. troops arrive in Bangladesh
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — U.S. Marines
and Army Special Forces, promising to make
contaminated water safe for drinking, arrived
yesterday and joined the international effort to
save cyclone survivors from disease and starva
tion.
Bangladeshi officials estimate at least eight
million survivors face serious health problems
and food shortages after the April 30 cyclone
and tidal wave that inundated low-lying islands
and coastal villages along the Bay of Bengal.
The U.S. task force will include 4,600
Marines and 8,000 sailors, along with hundreds
of other troops going separately, said Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Kenneth Patterson, a spokesperson for
the U.S. Pacific Command in Honolulu.
The Marines were on their way home from
the Gulf war when President Bush diverted
them to Bangladesh to join the relief effort.
