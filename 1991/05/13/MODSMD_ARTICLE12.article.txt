# Syria, U.S. differ on terms for talks
## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — Syrian
President Hafez Assad refused to
yield yesterday on two of his key
demands for joining a Middle East
peace conference, and Secretary of
State James Baker began to look
for fresh approaches to save a U.S.
initiative on which "many, many
things have been agreed."
After meeting with Assad for
nearly six hours in Damascus,
Baker flew to Cairo late yesterday
to coordinate strategy with Soviet
Foreign Minister Alexander Bess
mertnykh, who was concluding
his own tour of the region. He will
meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak today.
As Baker and Bessmertnykh
began their session, Baker said
there were more points of agree
ment than disagreement for forg
ing superpower-back talks in the
region.
Bessmertnykh said they had
come a great distance, "so we have
continuing work. There have been
shifts by all."
One option under considera
tion is to call a conference on
water resources and other
regional problems with the hope
of expanding it into negotiations
over the Arab-Israeli dispute, an
administration official said.
He described it as starting at
the outer circle and moving in.
Another approach being
weighed is holding peace talks
between Israel and a joint delega
tion of Jordan and Palestinian
Arabs — excluding Syria, said the
official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
Baker, in four trips to the area
over two months, has been work
ing on a larger pallet, but the ses
sion with Assad produced no nar
rowing of its differences with
Israel over a U.N. role in the talks,
or provisions for reconvening the
conference in the event of a dead
lock.
Syria wants a full-fledged role
for the United Nations, while
Israel having been stunned by a

number of lopsided votes in the
world organization, wants to keep
the United Nations out.
Another big sticking point is
Syria's demand for a way to recon
vene a conference if direct Arab-
Israeli talks falter, compared with
Israel's refusal to have more than
a ceremonial initial session.
Baker will take these points up
with Israel's Yitzhak Shamir and
foreign minister David Levy on
Wednesday and Thursday
But the administration official
said, "I don't expect to see pro
gress on the two issues when we
get to Israel."
Never the less, Baker may go
back to Damascus from Jerusalem
and keep trying, according to the
official.
"We've got to make sure we
exhaust all the possibilities," he
said.
The possibility of a conference
on regional problems as a spring
board to wider talks was enhanced
on Saturday when Saudi Arabia
and five other Persian Gulf states
agreed to attend such a session
with Israel.
Also on the positive side, the
official said, all the parties agreed
that the basis for peace talks
would be two U.N. Security Coun
cil resolutions that call on Israel
to exchange territory for peace.
And yet, the official said, Israel
and Syria sharply disagree on the
meaning of the 1967 and 1973 res
olutions.
Israel takes the position it has
already complied by relinquishing
the Sinai to Egypt in the 1979
peace treaty with its strongest
Arab neighbor.
Syria, on the other hand, inter
prets the resolutions as requiring
Israel to return the Golan Heights
which Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast war,
Baker had hoped the decision
by the six Gulf states to sit down
with Israel would help push hard
line Syria into peace talks.
