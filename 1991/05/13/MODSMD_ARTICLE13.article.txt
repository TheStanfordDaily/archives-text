A little pain now, no pain later
A Kurdish girl gets a sting from a cholera vaccination given by a French army
medic yesterday in a refugee camp on the Iraqi-Turkish border. The unsanitary
conditions of some of the remote mountain camps have led to some outbreaks
of the disease. Many Kurdish refugees have refused to leave the camps and
return to their homes because of fear of Iraqi reprisals.
