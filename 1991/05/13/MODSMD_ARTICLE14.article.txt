# Afghan aid policy under review by administration
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The adminis
tration said yesterday it is undecided about
whether to continue covert U.S. assistance
to the rebels in Afghanistan in the next fis
cal year.
President Bush has yet to ask Congress
for money for the rebels in fiscal 1992, and
deputy press secretary Judy Smith said that
the secret program is "under review."
Bush himself, speaking briefly with
reporters at nearby Andrews Air Force
Base, Md., said there was no cutoff under
the current budget. "We're still doing what
we're doing," he said. "But I'd like to see
that situation evolve so we wouldn't have to

do that." He did not elaborate.
The rebels reportedly have received more
than $2 billion over the past decade from
the United States.
An administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that last year
at this time there was no money in the bud
get for the rebels and that it is true again
this year.
The New York Times suggested yester
day that the omission from the 1992 budget
plan may be part of a larger strategy to get
Moscow to agree to a timetable for cutting
off its aid to the Afghanistan government.
