The Reges case shows
universities' need to
assert their autonomy

WHEN STANFORD admin
istrators made the decision
to fire Stuart Reges on Fri
day afternoon, they faced profound
political and economic imperatives.
The circumstances surrounding
the Reges controversy left the Uni
versity with few choices.
It is hard to deny that the fed
eral government played a pivotal
role in the decision to fire Reges.
Pressure from federal drug czar
Bob Martinez directly led to the
University's investigation.
The federal government then
used its financial muscle to try to
strong-arm Stanford's administra
tion into making the decision it
wanted. Stanford was threatened
with a loss of federal research and
financial aid grants if it did not
comply with Washington, D.C.
Unfortunately, the Reges inci
dent followed on the heels of the
indirect-cost scandal, placing Stan
ford in an already precarious posi
tion with respect to federal fund
ing. Stanford's administration
didn't have a lot of latitude in the
Reges case.
While it would be great to make
Stanford more immune from the
machinations of the "real world,"
in reality it is not. Stanford as an
institution in the public light is as
accountable to public opinion as
any other private organization.
The parents who pay money to
educate their children here, the
alumni who contribute to their
alma mater and even the taxpayers
whose income is redirected to
research and financial aid pro
grams will all try to exercise influ
ence upon Stanford's affairs.
This type of public pressure has

a positive side. It has been respon
sible, for example, for changing the
minority admission policies of
many universities in the last 40
years.
But it has also had sinister
implications for intellectual free
dom, as in the McCarthy era, when
government bullied universities
into firing faculty who were
thought sympathetic to Commu
nism.
Universities have often served
as the locus of progressive politics
and protest of government action.
They played a fundamentally
important role, for example, in the
opposition to the Vietnam War.
The right to maintain faculty
who speak out against government
policy and offer views divergent
from mainstream thought is a
priceless asset.
While it's hard to imagine Stan
ford administrators being able to
make a different decision in the
Reges case, administrators should
be making an effort to carve out
and protect the University's
sphere of autonomy.
Although the University cannot
exist in a vacuum, it must try to
maintain its independence in the
face of a government and a society
that would like to influence its poli
cies, its practices and its state
ments.
The decision to fire Reges is also
problematic because it does not
address the advice he gave a stu
dent to experiment with an illegal
drug.
This is an important side of the
controversy because it raises the
issue of speech versus conduct and
the relationship that teachers and
students can have.
There are no easy decisions in
the Reges incident. The issues that
surround the case, like university
accountability to government and
preservation of campus intellectual
freedom, will be around for a long
time.
