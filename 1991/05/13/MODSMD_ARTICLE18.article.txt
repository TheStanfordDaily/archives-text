## Debilitating paranoia 
### 
THE ALPHA EPSILON PI frater
nity's subversive attempt to take
over another fraternity house
reflects much more than a desire to get
housing for fraternity members; it repre
sents the widespread paranoia that pre
vents Stanford's fraternities and sorori
ties from working constructively with
University officials.
For years, fraternity members have
consistently expressed their claim that
"the administration is out to get us."
Whether it's the fraternal affairs adviser,
the Dean of Student Affairs or University
President Donald Kennedy, any fraternity
member will tell you conclusively that
everyone in the administration hates all
fraternities.
Granted, many members of the Stan
ford community operate with a bias
against the Greek system. Granted, the
University's words and actions justify a
certain amount of trepidation on the part
of fraternities. But it's the fraternities'
own words and actions, many of them
based on the Paranoia Principle, that get
them in trouble.
Fraternity members rightfully point to
the double standard used in dealing with
fraternity violations of University policy
versus violations by dormitory groups.
Whenever a fraternity violation arises,
fraternity leaders point to similar dorm
incidents to which the University turned
a blind eye.
Instead of dealing with the fraternity
incident on its own terms, however, and
proving that precautions were taken to
avoid the incident under investigation,
fraternity leaders resort to making argu-

ments based solely on social justice and
principles of fairness. Fraternities appar
ently prefer pointing to the rhesses in
other kitchens (Columbae's?) rather than
cleaning up their own.
The Paranoia Principle factors into
fraternity planning for social events, the
events for which fraternities most often
get in trouble. Based on the assumption
that police and University officials are
looking to "catch" any group that allows
drinking and the simultaneous belief in
the fraternity's duty to provide alcohol to
everyone — regardless of age or sobriety
— many fraternities devise ways to avoid
getting into trouble rather than planning
ways to make their parties safe for guests.
This applied paranoia turns out to be a
self-fulfilling prophecy. The party
inevitably violates University policy;
someone finds out, despite the "precau
tions" taken; and the fraternity doesn't
beat the rap even though it can point fin
gers at similar violations by dormitories.
The recent University handling of
Alpha Sigma's "Exotic Erotic" violations
could be instructive to most fraternity
members. Because Alpha Sig representa
tives were cooperative in dealing with the
problems and worked with University
officials to uncover the whole story, the
University lifted the dorm's social sus
pension in light of the evidence provided.
Because such leniency — or common
sense — is rarely shown with fraternity
violations, fraternity members automati
cally point to the withdrawn suspension
as another example of the University's
double standard. Although the argument
may have some truth, the fraternities are

missing an important lesson: Sincere
cooperation has its rewards.
Right now, I can envision several Inter
fraternity Council members yelling and
screaming at the top of their lungs that
the IFC Judicial Board has a sincere
interest in getting to the bottom of the
incidents it investigates. But they know
as well as I do that the IFC and its judicial
board place a higher priority on covering
the fraternities' butts than on finding out
if a University policy was violated.
If fraternities really want to save their
hides, and their houses, they should work
internally to minimize the potential for
problems and deal seriously with alleged
violations of University policy. Through
out the year, fraternity leaders should
work constructively with University offi
cials to establish a strong, positive work
ing relationship.
Through their own words and actions,
fraternities might yet be able to get the
social justice and fairness they are seek
ing.

the above column are just that; they do
not apply to all fraternities or fraternity
members.
