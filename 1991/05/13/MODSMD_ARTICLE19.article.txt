Reges is challenging government's drug orthodoxy

Kudos to stuart reges for
resisting the federally imposed
campus drug regulations. Reges
has taken a stand for both personal and
academic freedom.
Reges has challenged the chief totem
of the drug war: the government's
authority to dictate what citizens do
with their bodies. Such authority, though
taken for granted in today's anti-drug
hysteria, is at odds with traditional
American values of individual freedom,
self-reliance and privacy.
Current drug laws resemble laws
against sexual preference in that they
outlaw self-regarding, victimless behav
ior. The supposed illegality of Reges'
actions must be weighed against the
dubious justice of the drug laws them
selves.
By his exemplary job performance,
Reges has shown the lie in the govern
ment's claim that users of illicit intoxi
cants are naturally incompetent and

dangerous. It is no secret that the Stan
ford community harbors many other
responsible and productive members
who have used non-traditional intoxi
cants, with no observable harm to them
selves or the community. What distin
guishes Reges is his outspoken honesty.
The federal regulations that Reges
has challenged are designed to enforce,
on college campuses, the government's
own type of "politically correct" attitudes
toward intoxicants.
The government's orthodoxy doesn't
mean a drug-free campus, since no one
intends to prohibit drugs like alcohol or
nicotine, which both have strong political
lobbies. Rather, it means persecuting
other, non-traditional intoxicants, even
when they are known to be no more dan
gerous than alcohol and tobacco.
Insofar as many nontraditional (or, to
complete the analogy, non-PC) intoxi
cants are in fact socially accepted in
other cultures, the PC view has the

same, one-dimensional cultural bias as
an old-fashioned Western civilization
text.
In the government's view, it is correct
for corporations to mass market and
advertise liquor and cigarettes to the
public, but backyard pot growers are to
be rooted out with helicopters, infor
mants and urine tests.
The government has gone so far as to
forbid drinking by "minors" under 21, a
laughably high age by the standards of
other countries. It is a pity that social
drinking by most college students is ille
gal and is in routine violation of Stan
ford policy.
In imposing cultural conformity, fed
eral drug regulations undermine the
social diversity and tolerance vital to aca
demic life. Lawful investigation in the
area of psychedelic drug research, for
example, has long since been squashed
by the government.
The war on drugs has become the

most dangerous assault on academic and
personal freedom since McCarthyism,
with "un-American" drugs (and atti
tudes about drug use) having replaced
Communism as the bogeyman.
As a Stanford alumnus active in the
drug reform movement, I join other
alumni, students and faculty to urge that
the University resist drug czar Bob Mar
tinez' intimidation.
It is unfortunate that Reges' protest
is embarrassing and comes when the
administration is already in a delicate
situation. However, it must be recog
nized that the real threat to academic
freedom comes not from Reges, but from
the government. Only by standing up for
Reges will Stanford be able to defend its
own freedom.
