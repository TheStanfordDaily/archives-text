# Reges fired for carrying drugs, buying minors alcohol

### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stuart Reges, a computer science
senior lecturer, was fired late Friday
afternoon for carrying illegal drugs on
campus and buying alcoholic beverages
for underage students.
Another basis for Reges' termination
was his refusal to promise not to carry
illegal drugs in his backpack on campus in
the future, said James Gibbons, dean of
the School of Engineering, in a letter dis
missing Reges.
"These violations of [the University
drug and alcohol policy], coupled with
your refusal to undertake to observe the

policy in the future, in my view, constitute
very serious professional misconduct of
an academician at Stanford University,"
Gibbons wrote.
He noted that his decision was not
influenced by Reges' advice to a student
to experiment with the amphetamine
derived hallucinogen MDA and his advice
to Stanford students to violate the policy.
But, Gibbons added, "1 personally con
sider your advice to students extremely
irresponsible."
He concluded, "If and when you can
freely and publicly, in a manner accept
able to the University, agree to abide by
the University's Policy on Controlled
Substances and Alcohol at all times in the

future, I would be willing to consider re
employing you."
Reges said he is considering suing the
University to regain his position. He said
he has not yet found a lawyer who will
represent him, but he is being aided in his
search by the Washington, D.C.-based
Drug Policy Foundation.
Reges' termination, effective Wednes
day, came three weeks after he was placed
on paid administrative leave, during
which a University investigation was car
ried out by Ken Down, associate dean for
administration in the School of Engineer
ing, and Kathy Davis, associate dean for
human resources in the school.
The two interviewed Reges three times

and also spoke with some of the students
who were present at an off-campus din
ner where Reges allegedly allowed two
underage students to order alcohol.
Reges said he told the interviewers he
would not violate the alcohol prohibition
in the future, but he refused to promise
not to carry illegal drugs on campus.
In two November letters to The Daily
and a March letter to national drug czar
Bob Martinez, Reges admitted that he
carries illegal drugs on campus to protest
U.S. drug policy.
Reges said it is clear that he was fired
"because of government pressure." If this
weren't true, he asked, "Why didn't they
fire me then in November?"

Terry Shepard, director of Stanford
News Service, told The Chronicle of
Higher Education that the University did
not take action against Reges in Novem
ber because the philosophical points in
the Daily letters were constitutionally
protected free speech and because the
actions described in the letter predated
the implementation of the policy.
According to University policy con
cerning the termination of academic staff,
Gibbons' decision had to be approved by
Provost James Rosse. In a letter to Gib
bons, Rosse wrote, "I find this action rea
sonable in view of the facts as you report
