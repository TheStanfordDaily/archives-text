# Reges fired for carrying drugs, buying minors alcohol
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Stuart Reges, a computer science
senior lecturer, was fired late Friday
afternoon for carrying illegal drugs on
campus and buying alcoholic beverages
for underage students.
Another basis for Reges' termination
was his refusal to promise not to carry
illegal drugs in his backpack on campus in
the future, said James Gibbons, dean of
the School of Engineering, in a letter dis
missing Reges.
"These violations of [the University
drug and alcohol policy], coupled with
your refusal to undertake to observe the

policy in the future, in my view, constitute
very serious professional misconduct of
an academician at Stanford University,"
Gibbons wrote.
He noted that his decision was not
influenced by Reges' advice to a student
to experiment with the amphetamine
derived hallucinogen MDA and his advice
to Stanford students to violate the policy.
But, Gibbons added, "1 personally con
sider your advice to students extremely
irresponsible."
He concluded, "If and when you can
freely and publicly, in a manner accept
able to the University, agree to abide by
the University's Policy on Controlled
Substances and Alcohol at all times in the

future, I would be willing to consider re
employing you."
Reges said he is considering suing the
University to regain his position. He said
he has not yet found a lawyer who will
represent him, but he is being aided in his
search by the Washington, D.C.-based
Drug Policy Foundation.
Reges' termination, effective Wednes
day, came three weeks after he was placed
on paid administrative leave, during
which a University investigation was car
ried out by Ken Down, associate dean for
administration in the School of Engineer
ing, and Kathy Davis, associate dean for
human resources in the school.
The two interviewed Reges three times

and also spoke with some of the students
who were present at an off-campus din
ner where Reges allegedly allowed two
underage students to order alcohol.
Reges said he told the interviewers he
would not violate the alcohol prohibition
in the future, but he refused to promise
not to carry illegal drugs on campus.
In two November letters to The Daily
and a March letter to national drug czar
Bob Martinez, Reges admitted that he
carries illegal drugs on campus to protest
U.S. drug policy.
Reges said it is clear that he was fired
"because of government pressure." If this
weren't true, he asked, "Why didn't they
fire me then in November?"

Terry Shepard, director of Stanford
News Service, told The Chronicle of
Higher Education that the University did
not take action against Reges in Novem
ber because the philosophical points in
the Daily letters were constitutionally
protected free speech and because the
actions described in the letter predated
the implementation of the policy.
According to University policy con
cerning the termination of academic staff,
Gibbons' decision had to be approved by
Provost James Rosse. In a letter to Gib
bons, Rosse wrote, "I find this action rea
sonable in view of the facts as you report
them, and, accordingly, I approve
and adopt the disposition you pro
pose."
University policy allows Reges
to file a grievance with Gibbons
and Rosse. Reges said he will dis
cuss the grievance with lawyers
today and will probably present it
to Gibbons tomorrow.
In addition, he will give Gib
bons a statement today saying
that he will "never facilitate the
use of alcohol for underage stu
dents as long as the policy exists,"
he said.
Reges added that he has talked
to two lawyers who told him that
he should not be held responsible
for the alcohol incident.
According to the University
policy, "The unlawful possession,
use, or distribution of alcohol is
prohibited on the Stanford cam
pus, in the workplace, or as part of
any of the University's activities."
Reges said the students were
the ones who possessed and used
the alcohol and that the restau
rant was liable for the distribu
tion of the beverages. He also
questioned if the dinner was a
University activity.
He also denied Gibbons' accu
sation that through his advice he
encouraged a student to violate
the policy. "I didn't tell him to vio
late [the policy] on campus," he
said, adding, "I've never encour
aged others to violate [the policy].
. . . I've encouraged others to
ignore it."
In his Nov. 9 letter to The
Daily, Reges wrote, "My advice
regarding [the policy] is to defy it
and to do so as openly as you are
willing to do. I encourage students
to insist on the right to decide
whether they will drink or do
drugs in their own rooms."
Reges has said he carries drugs
on campus to protest the govern
ment's "coercion" of universities
through the 1989 Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act,
which stipulates that universities
must implement drug and alcohol
policies to receive federal funds.
He has also said he is protest
ing the University's "hypocrisy"
in complying with a policy with
which it does not agree.
Gibbons' letter acknowledged
Reges' right to object to Univer
sity policies but added that "vio

lating the policy is not an accept
able form of objection, especially
in a community such as ours that
promotes full and free discussion
of opposing views."
Reges won a Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel Award for Outstanding Ser
vice to Undergraduate Education
in 1985, a School of Engineering
Distinguished Adviser Award in
1986 and an honorable mention in
this year's ASSU Undergraduate
Teaching Awards.
He restructured some of the
introductory-level computer sci
ence courses and introduced the
undergraduate section leader pro
gram in the Computer Science
Department.
Gibbons wrote, "I admire you
greatly for these contributions
and am sorry that the University
will lose these services."
Reges' current appointment
was to have expired in June but as
of March 15 was going to be
renewed for at least another year.
He was given 30 days' pay in lieu
of notice.
The department has hired
Peter Rathmann, a computer sci
ence research associate who has

been teaching Reges' Computer
Science 1098 course for the past
week, to teach the class until the
end of the quarter, said Jeffrey
Ullman, the department chair.
Ullman taught the class from
April 22 to May 4.
Eric Roberts, the department's
assistant chair for educational
affairs, said he is unsure what will
happen to Reges' advisees, noting
that the department is short on
advisers. "We'll dig up some some
where," said Roberts, also a com
puter science associate professor.
He said the department plans
on maintaining its cadre of four
lecturing positions next year.

Roberts called Reges' termina
tion "a real loss" and "inappropri
ate," adding, "It's a sad situation
when the University insists on
weaker standards of proof than
the court system would."
However, Ullman said Gibbons
had a "fairly reasonable position"
because he did not base his deci
sion on the charges that could
have been interpreted as either
protected speech or punishable
conduct and "asked Stuart to
respect the law."
"It's a shame Stuart has
refused to do this," Ullman said,
adding he hopes Reges will even
tually comply with the policy.
A Daily poll of Stanford profes
sors conducted last week found
that less than a fifth of the faculty
said they thought Reges should be
allowed to stay in his job if the
University determined he had vio
lated the drug and alcohol policy.
The poll also found that 54 per
cent of the professors character
ized Reges' advice to students as
punishable conduct, while only 18
percent thought his advice was
protected free speech.

A solemn Stuart Reges, a former senior lecturer in computer science, sits alone in his office after learn
ing of his termination.
Stuart Reges, a computer science
senior lecturer, was fired late Friday
afternoon for carrying illegal drugs on
campus and buying alcoholic beverages
for underage students.
Another basis for Reges' termination
was his refusal to promise not to carry
illegal drugs in his backpack on campus in
the future, said James Gibbons, dean of
the School of Engineering, in a letter dis
missing Reges.
"These violations of [the University
drug and alcohol policy], coupled with
your refusal to undertake to observe the

policy in the future, in my view, constitute
very serious professional misconduct of
an academician at Stanford University,"
Gibbons wrote.
He noted that his decision was not
influenced by Reges' advice to a student
to experiment with the amphetamine
derived hallucinogen MDA and his advice
to Stanford students to violate the policy.
But, Gibbons added, "1 personally con
sider your advice to students extremely
irresponsible."
He concluded, "If and when you can
freely and publicly, in a manner accept
able to the University, agree to abide by
the University's Policy on Controlled
Substances and Alcohol at all times in the

future, I would be willing to consider re
employing you."
Reges said he is considering suing the
University to regain his position. He said
he has not yet found a lawyer who will
represent him, but he is being aided in his
search by the Washington, D.C.-based
Drug Policy Foundation.
Reges' termination, effective Wednes
day, came three weeks after he was placed
on paid administrative leave, during
which a University investigation was car
ried out by Ken Down, associate dean for
administration in the School of Engineer
ing, and Kathy Davis, associate dean for
human resources in the school.
The two interviewed Reges three times

and also spoke with some of the students
who were present at an off-campus din
ner where Reges allegedly allowed two
underage students to order alcohol.
Reges said he told the interviewers he
would not violate the alcohol prohibition
in the future, but he refused to promise
not to carry illegal drugs on campus.
In two November letters to The Daily
and a March letter to national drug czar
Bob Martinez, Reges admitted that he
carries illegal drugs on campus to protest
U.S. drug policy.
Reges said it is clear that he was fired
"because of government pressure." If this
weren't true, he asked, "Why didn't they
fire me then in November?"

Terry Shepard, director of Stanford
News Service, told The Chronicle of
Higher Education that the University did
not take action against Reges in Novem
ber because the philosophical points in
the Daily letters were constitutionally
protected free speech and because the
actions described in the letter predated
the implementation of the policy.
According to University policy con
cerning the termination of academic staff,
Gibbons' decision had to be approved by
Provost James Rosse. In a letter to Gib
bons, Rosse wrote, "I find this action rea
sonable in view of the facts as you report
them, and, accordingly, I approve
and adopt the disposition you pro
pose."
University policy allows Reges
to file a grievance with Gibbons
and Rosse. Reges said he will dis
cuss the grievance with lawyers
today and will probably present it
to Gibbons tomorrow.
In addition, he will give Gib
bons a statement today saying
that he will "never facilitate the
use of alcohol for underage stu
dents as long as the policy exists,"
he said.
Reges added that he has talked
to two lawyers who told him that
he should not be held responsible
for the alcohol incident.
According to the University
policy, "The unlawful possession,
use, or distribution of alcohol is
prohibited on the Stanford cam
pus, in the workplace, or as part of
any of the University's activities."
Reges said the students were
the ones who possessed and used
the alcohol and that the restau
rant was liable for the distribu
tion of the beverages. He also
questioned if the dinner was a
University activity.
He also denied Gibbons' accu
sation that through his advice he
encouraged a student to violate
the policy. "I didn't tell him to vio
late [the policy] on campus," he
said, adding, "I've never encour
aged others to violate [the policy].
. . . I've encouraged others to
ignore it."
In his Nov. 9 letter to The
Daily, Reges wrote, "My advice
regarding [the policy] is to defy it
and to do so as openly as you are
willing to do. I encourage students
to insist on the right to decide
whether they will drink or do
drugs in their own rooms."
Reges has said he carries drugs
on campus to protest the govern
ment's "coercion" of universities
through the 1989 Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act,
which stipulates that universities
must implement drug and alcohol
policies to receive federal funds.
He has also said he is protest
ing the University's "hypocrisy"
in complying with a policy with
which it does not agree.
Gibbons' letter acknowledged
Reges' right to object to Univer
sity policies but added that "vio

lating the policy is not an accept
able form of objection, especially
in a community such as ours that
promotes full and free discussion
of opposing views."
Reges won a Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel Award for Outstanding Ser
vice to Undergraduate Education
in 1985, a School of Engineering
Distinguished Adviser Award in
1986 and an honorable mention in
this year's ASSU Undergraduate
Teaching Awards.
He restructured some of the
introductory-level computer sci
ence courses and introduced the
undergraduate section leader pro
gram in the Computer Science
Department.
Gibbons wrote, "I admire you
greatly for these contributions
and am sorry that the University
will lose these services."
Reges' current appointment
was to have expired in June but as
of March 15 was going to be
renewed for at least another year.
He was given 30 days' pay in lieu
of notice.
The department has hired
Peter Rathmann, a computer sci
ence research associate who has

aged others to vio
late [the policy]...
. I've encouraged
others to ignore it.'
— Stuart Reges

been teaching Reges' Computer
Science 1098 course for the past
week, to teach the class until the
end of the quarter, said Jeffrey
Ullman, the department chair.
Ullman taught the class from
April 22 to May 4.
Eric Roberts, the department's
assistant chair for educational
affairs, said he is unsure what will
happen to Reges' advisees, noting
that the department is short on
advisers. "We'll dig up some some
where," said Roberts, also a com
puter science associate professor.
He said the department plans
on maintaining its cadre of four
lecturing positions next year.

Roberts called Reges' termina
tion "a real loss" and "inappropri
ate," adding, "It's a sad situation
when the University insists on
weaker standards of proof than
the court system would."
However, Ullman said Gibbons
had a "fairly reasonable position"
because he did not base his deci
sion on the charges that could
have been interpreted as either
protected speech or punishable
conduct and "asked Stuart to
respect the law."
"It's a shame Stuart has
refused to do this," Ullman said,
adding he hopes Reges will even
tually comply with the policy.
A Daily poll of Stanford profes
sors conducted last week found
that less than a fifth of the faculty
said they thought Reges should be
