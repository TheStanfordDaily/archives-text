# Government is forcing Stanford to be partner in its war on drugs
## 
### 
Stuart Reges is not the real issue
here; rather, it is the federal govern
ment's efforts to strong-arm Stanford.
The government wants to make an
example of Stanford by forcing the Uni
versity to support federal drug regula
tions.
To motivate the Stanford administra
tion to fire Reges, the government
threatened to cut federal funding —
unless Reges was dismissed.
As federal drug czar Robert Martinez
wrote to University President Donald
Kennedy on April 12:

"I know you share my concern about
the threat illicit drugs pose to all young
Americans, and I am sure you agree that
American education has a special obliga
tion to help insure the safety and order
of its campuses where drugs are at issue.
Then, too, I know you are aware of legal
provisions governing receipt of federal
funding and financial assistance (includ
ing participation in all federal student
aid programs)."
Martinez and the Office of National
Drug Control Policy have blackmailed
the University into acting as they com
mand with Reges. Under the threat of
losing federal financial aid, the adminis
tration had no choice but to fire him.
To me, it seems like the government
is using extortionary tactics in an effort
to turn Stanford into its (the govern
ment's) model of the perfect American
university.

Does the Stanford community want to
become this model? Does it feel that men
like Reges should be allowed to fall by
the wayside?
