# Prohibition, not drug use, causes the social problems of drugs

David Chan's May 3 letter about Stu
art Reges displays an astonishingly
myopic view of the drug issue.
It is not addictive substances them
selves that cause the social horrors of
crime and exploitation; it is the prohibi
tion of those substances.

America went through an analogous
situation once before, during the 19205,
when the prohibition of alcohol led to the
rise of a violent and exploitative group of
"drug lords." They and their gangs dis
appeared soon after Prohibition ended.
Addictive substances, when abused,
can hurt a person. But prohibition makes
them hurt an entire society.
As a society we should legalize the
drugs, make them safely available and
work on the underlying causes of sub
stance abuse.
This approach is working well with
alcohol and tobacco. If Chan seriously
believes in "sacrifices by the better off to
help the worse off in society" he should
sacrifice his moralistic blindfold and help
eliminate prohibition.
