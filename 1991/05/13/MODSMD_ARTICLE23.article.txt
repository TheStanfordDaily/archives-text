## Stuart Reges Life's experiences have taught me to stand up against injustice

It may profit us very little to win the war
on drugs if in the process we lose our soul.

MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO think
the controversy I have raised is
trivial, or not worth getting fired
over, but in fact it focuses on many of
the most fundamental issues I have
grappled with in my life. When I was in
ninth grade I was puzzled by Alexis de
Tocqueville's comment, "I know no
country in which there is so little inde
pendence of thought and true freedom of
expression as in America." I was
intrigued by the idea. Aren't we the
champions of free speech?
A week later my teacher invited me to
participate in the Optimists' Club's ora
torical contest. She said that I should
give a patriotic speech. I wrote a speech
in which I attacked de Tocqueville's
characterization of free speech in Amer
ica. I didn't know whether I believed in
what I was saying; I just thought it was
likely to win me a prize. I took first
place. Little did I know that the very
forces that de Tocqueville understood so
well would frequently engulf me later in
my life.
That event was one of many in which
I was praised and given awards for doing
what I was supposed to do. And I might
have never done differently, except for
the fact that I was gay. I could find no
way to resolve my inner feelings with my
desire to be a "good boy." The struggle
was so intense that I attempted suicide
because being dead seemed preferable to
being torn apart. That was the first

"bad" thing I had ever done, and it laid
the foundation for everything that fol
lowed.
Most of my struggles since then have
been with people who want to silence me
because I express dangerous or unpopu
lar ideas. As an undergraduate, I orga
nized the first-ever gay/lesbian dance at
my school and had my first experience
with open hatred. People would rip down
my posters right in front of me, crumple
them and throw them at my feet. When
Stanford's Computer Science Depart
ment informed me that I would be hired
only if I would promise never to publish
another article on being gay in The Daily,
I had my first experience with compro
mising my ideals. (I kind of promised
and avoided writing such articles for
three years.) I experienced similar frus
tration when the principal of my former
high school banned me from school after
a newspaper article mentioned that I'm
gay-
Four years ago I had a great deal of
power and respect at Stanford, but I
needed something more in my life. I
tried working in industry, but that did
not satisfy my hunger either. Allan
Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind"
convinced me that what I needed was a
strong dose of ideals. Since then I have
taken time to think and read and look
for ideals.
I found those ideals when I read Jef
ferson, de Tocqueville, Paine, Nietzsche,
Swift, Plato, Spooner and too many oth
ers to name. In de Tocqueville and
Spooner I found the story of an America
lost, a society of citizens rather than sub
jects, a society that knew that justice

must supersede the will of the majority
and, most of all, a society that under
stood that governments will make mis
takes, that unjust laws will be passed
and that government, therefore, must be
limited so as to protect its citizens from
tyranny.
In studying the history of this country
I can't help but wonder whether there
has ever been a time when Americans
understood free speech. Joseph
McCarthy was hardly the first American
to use government to limit the expres
sion of ideas. Thomas Jefferson battled
religious intolerance, Emma Goldman
and Margaret Sanger were jailed for giv
ing out birth control information,
Eugene Debbs was sentenced to 10 years
for encouraging people to resist the draft
and the list goes on and on.
Jefferson realized that nobody can
know absolute truth and that the only
rational approach to differences of opin
ion is to allow ideas to compete freely on
the battlefield of "reason and free
inquiry." He said, "It is error alone
which needs the support of government.
The truth can stand by itself." And now I
find myself debating congressmen on
national television who say that federal
funds should not go to universities that
employ faculty with opinions like mine.
Even sadder is the fact that over half the
Stanford faculty say that giving one's
honest advice to a student can be "pun
ishable conduct." A university should be
the citadel of reason, and free inquiry
and advice, therefore, should not be con
strained.
Drugs are not one of the most impor
tant parts of my life, but in watching the

government's war on drugs I've seen just
how much America has forgotten. Even
though I have never been convicted of a
drug crime and have never even been
searched by the police, I have been fired
from Stanford for talking about drug
use. The government has forced Stan
ford to join the drug police.
The excuse, of course, is that I carried
illegal drugs in my backpack and that I
purchased alcohol for students under 21.
I plan to file a grievance, but the argu
ments are too lengthy to repeat here. (I'll
make copies available, however, for inter
ested parties.) Even so, the detailed anal
ysis is almost superfluous. Everyone
knows that my allowing two undergradu
ates to have a before-dinner drink hardly
constitutes even the tip of the iceberg of
underage drinking violations. At most, it
qualifies me as a minor player in a cast
of thousands here at Stanford. But I am
so tired of arguing about alcohol that I'm
going to promise never to do it again.
But that won't get me off the hook (as
I have already been told). Which brings
us to the backpack. I am being fired for
carrying illegal drugs in my backpack on
campus. This was determined by the
administration's "investigation." And
what did the investigation turn up? The
fact that I claim to have done so. There
is no independent evidence, no witnesses
other than myself and even my "testi
mony" was coerced (the administration
threatened to fire me if I didn't answer
the question). But even with my coerced
confession, all that proves is that I claim
to have carried illegal drugs in my back
pack (and contrary to what members of
the administration suggest, claiming

that you violate a policy seems to me to
be an excellent way to protest). My
claims are nothing new. I made them
way back in November. So why fire me
now? The answer is obvious: because the
government insists that Stanford do so.
Why? Because my views on drugs are
"dangerous" to the "impressionable
youngsters" here at Stanford.
I can tell from talking to the students
who support me that many are unsure of
how they should respond to my firing.
Let me recommend that you not take
drastic action. Even if you admire my
courage of conviction, don't test your
own strength too soon and don't give up
on working from inside the system just
yet. The biggest compliment you could
pay me would be to promise yourself
that you'll search for your own ideals, as
I have, and that you'll be willing to fight
for them, as I have, by the time you're
my age.
I am, however, asking everyone who
supports me to join me for lunch in
White Plaza tomorrow (Tuesday) at
noon. I have often eaten lunch there,
and I would enjoy spending my last day
as a staff member with those who sup
port what I've done. There won't be any
speeches or marching to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's office, just a
group of people expressing their feelings
by getting together. But do be sure to
bring your lunch in a backpack if you
can.
