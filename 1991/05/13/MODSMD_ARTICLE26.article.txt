## Mental toughness gives Card the edge 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
"The last time we played
Stanford in the finals we were
happy to be there. This time
we 're going out to win. "
— UCLA coach Bill Zaima,
Saturday, discussing his
team's chances in the NCAA
Championship match
In that same discussion,
Zaima explained how the Car
dinal met the Bruins twice this
season and used 4-2 leads after
singles to defeat UCIJV This
time around, Zaima felt, his
team would go into doubles at
worst 3-3 — maybe even ahead
4-2.
Yesterday, Bill Zaima and
the Bruins came crashing back
down to reality as the mighty
Court of Destruction, the Stan
ford women's tennis team,
blew away UCLA 5-1 to win its
sixth straight NCAA crown.
Each year the opposition
thinks they'll finally break
through — and each year the
Cardinal breaks them down.
Take the case of Georgia,
which Stanford defeated 5-1 in
the semifinals. It was the fifth
consecutive time the Cardinal
had eliminated the Bulldogs
from the NCAAs.
"I felt every single time, we
were capable of doing it," said
Georgia coach Jeff Wallace of
his team's chances against
Stanford. "I felt real positive
for the past five years. We go in
and I really think this is the
time were going to get 'em."
Instead, Georgia gets "got"
themselves. So what do they
do? Go back to the drawing
board, of course. "I can't wait,"
said Georgia star Shannan
McCarthy about the proverbial
next year. "I start thinking
about it tomorrow."
Florida, on the other hand,
probably won't forget this

tournament for a while. The
Lady Gators were a prohibitive
favorite, but fell in the semis to
UCLA. A much anticipated
rematch with Stanford never
came off.
The final was supposed to
give the Cardinal a chance to
avenge its 6-0 defeat to Florida.
The fact that Stanford didn't
get that chance mattered little
to the team, though.
"I'm not big on revenge,"
Stanford coach Frank Brennan
said. "The best revenge is liv
ing well. We'll live very well
with that trophy for the next
couple of days."
Stanford has that trophy
because they shook off their
crushing defeat, which ended a
streak of 76 straight wins, and
got back to business. "This
team played some of the best
tennis I've ever seen played
here (after the loss)," Brennan
said.
Thay also got their confi
dence back and took it out
there with them. "Our girls go
on the court knowing they're
the best players, the best ath
letes, the best trained and the
most together."
Together? With all the indi
vidual stars. Take it from Deb
bie Graham: "Our team is so
much closer this year. I feel so
close to everyone. I wanted to
win it for every single person
on my team. This year every
one wanted it for each other."
Said Brennan: "This team is
the closest team I've ever had
in my 12 years here."
After two years of having
what Brennan called "the best
team ever," this season Stan
ford had maybe its best team
ever — the one that put all
individual goals and desires
aside to make sure the Cardi
nal won yet another NCAA
title.
It was the team that answered
the question "Will it be six?" with
an emphatic "Yes!"
Someday, the conventional
wisdom says, this seemingly end
less run of national champi
onships will have to come to an
end. Florida, Georgia, UCLA,
someone, will finally figure out
how to beat Stanford at the
NCAAs.
All they've got to do is get bet
ter players, better athletes. All
they've got to do is train them
better, get them closer together.
That's it. Nothing more. What
could be easier? What could be
more impossible?
