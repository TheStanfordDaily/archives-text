# Poruri, Johnson key Card six-peat
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Two-thirds of Stanford's 1991
singles lineup was there last sea
son. Sandra Birch, Debbie Gra
ham, Teri Whitlinger and Heather
Willens were key cogs in the
machine that brought home the
Cardinal's fifth straight title a
year ago.
The remaining two players that
helped make it six in a row yester
day, weren't on the courts in
Gainesville, Fla., last May. One,
freshman Laxmi Poruri, was still
in high school. The other, Kvlie
Johnson, was a spectator.
Each overcame bumpy roads to
these championships. Together,
their spectacular play over the
past four days was critical in Stan
ford becoming the first host
school to win the NCAA title.
Poruri's freshman season has
had its ups and downs. The pres
sure of adjusting to college — and
college tennis — have taxed her at
times.
But like Willens and Johnson
before her, Poruri has become yet
another in the long line of Stan
ford freshman to come up big at
the national championships.
Make that huge. Poruri won all
her matches in straight sets and
was one of the first players off for
the Cardinal each day. The pres
sure of repeating, of winning
again, seemed to have no affect on
her.
"Ignorance is bliss," coach
Frank Brennan said. "The fresh
man don't know the pressure 'til
it's all over. . . . Laxmi Poruri was
awesome."
Indeed she was — and loving
every minute of it. "We proved to
everybody we're still the champi
ons," said an ecstatic Poruri. "I
can definitely say this is one of the
best moments of my life."
All those years of junior tennis,
of being out there all alone, had
been replaced by the chance to
play with people, to strive for a
common goal.
"We were so close as a team,"
she said. "During Stanford's his

For the third consecutive year, a freshman stepped Into the bottom half of the Cardinal lineup to domi

four straight-sets wins at Nos. 4 and 5 singles.
tory, there's been so much individ
ualism." Not this season. Espe
cially not after the Cardinal lost 6-
0 to Florida at the National Team
Indoors back on March 3.
"We went through a lot — get
ting blown away. We've been bear
ing a lot of doubt," Poruri
explained. But the doubt came
from outside, not from the team.
The Cardinal pulled together and
re-learned what it took to make
the team so successful.
Though Poruri is in just her
first year here, she knew what
that was. "Stanford is solid — like
a steel wall," she said. "It's not
like we fluctuate."
There are countless reasons for
that. One of them is that everyone
remembers the special feeling
they had the first time they were
an NCAA champ — and wants to
share it."I got teary eyed when we
won," Whitlinger said. "I wanted
to win it for the freshman."
Johnson remembered winning
as a freshman and what a great
experience it was for her but said,
"This year beats it out. It means a
lot more to me."
Why? Because not only was she
a reserve last year after failing to
crack the lineup, but Johnson
wasn't even supposed to be play
ing in this tournament. As a mat
ter of fact, she wasn't supposed to
be playing this year.
Last summer, while playing in
Austria, Johnson shattered her
ankle, breaking both the tibia and

fibula in right leg. She was rushed
into surgery and remembers com
ing out of the anesthesia.
"The first thing I a3ked when I
came to was, 'Doc, when can I be
playing again?' " His answer was
frightening. It basically consisted
of maybe next summer and that
Johnson "might never be back to
100 percent."
It could have been a crushing
blow. Late in the spring of 1990,
Johnson had returned to the form
that made her a star as a fresh
man and was sure to figure in
Brennan's plans for the lineup
this year.
Instead of becoming depressed
about the injury, however,
Jonhson used it as a motivational
tool. "I decided then and there I
was going to come back ... to try
and prove everybody wrong."
Consider it proved. But don't
think the trek back has been an
easy one. "It was really tough
sometimes," Johnson said. "It
wasn't until three days before
nationals that there wasn't a lot of
pain every time I had to go on the
court."
Just in time for Johnson to
step back into the spotlight. Two
seasons ago, her scintillating per
formance at the NCAAs was
capped by a key win at No. 6 sin
gles over UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer.
Entering the match, the Bruins
figured Dreyer was their best
hope. When Johnson finished her
off, UCLA collapsed.
Brennan was counting on
Johnson again this time. "She was
what we call the UCLA killer," he
said of the '89 finals. Then Bren
nan went on to credit Johnson for
making it back. "Kylie's just so

courageous. She's been working
so hard to get ready for this."
He continued to explain that
Johnson was hurting herself early
in the year by trying to do too
much before she was ready. Even
tually, Brennan said, Johnson told
him what she could and could not
do — and didn't push herself
beyond the limit.
"Her honesty with the coach
ing staff was really important,"
Brennan said. "Her honesty really
kept her in the lineup."
Some days, Johnson said, all
she could give in practice was 45
minutes. Many times, she left
early. The frustration of a a will
ing mind and incapable body
might have led many to give up.
But Johnson was determined
and that pulled her through —
especially yesterday. On April 20
at UCLA, Cammie Foley crushed
her 6-2, 6-2. When the Cardinal
squared off against the Bruins in
the championship match, Foley
was again on the other side of the
net.
Did any self-doubt creep into
Johnson's mind? No siree. "I
didn't ever think about losing. I
don't think you can," she said.
That was good news for Stan
ford, which needed a Johnson win
badlv yesterday. Ahead 4-1, the
Cardinal desparately wanted to
win in singles because, with
Birch's status in doubt, the dou
bles situation was shakv at best.
And when all the attention
shifted to her court, when Kvlie
Johnson could give Stanford a
national crown, all the months of
hard work paid off in a big way.

three-setter, killing off the Bruins'

crack the lineup, but Johnson
wasn't even supposed to be play
ing in this tournament. As a mat
ter of fact, she wasn't supposed to
be playing this year.
Last summer, while playing in
Austria, Johnson shattered her
ankle, breaking both the tibia and

fibula in right leg. She was rushed
into surgery and remembers com
ing out of the anesthesia.
"The first thing I a3ked when I
came to was, 'Doc, when can I be
playing again?' " His answer was
frightening. It basically consisted
of maybe next summer and that
Johnson "might never be back to
100 percent."
It could have been a crushing
blow. Late in the spring of 1990,
Johnson had returned to the form
that made her a star as a fresh
man and was sure to figure in
Brennan's plans for the lineup
this year.
Instead of becoming depressed
about the injury, however,
Jonhson used it as a motivational
tool. "I decided then and there I
was going to come back ... to try
and prove everybody wrong."
Consider it proved. But don't
think the trek back has been an
easy one. "It was really tough
sometimes," Johnson said. "It
wasn't until three days before
nationals that there wasn't a lot of
pain every time I had to go on the
court."
Just in time for Johnson to
step back into the spotlight. Two
seasons ago, her scintillating per
formance at the NCAAs was
capped by a key win at No. 6 sin
gles over UCLA's Kirsten Dreyer.
Entering the match, the Bruins
figured Dreyer was their best
hope. When Johnson finished her
off, UCLA collapsed.
Brennan was counting on
Johnson again this time. "She was
what we call the UCLA killer," he
said of the '89 finals. Then Bren
nan went on to credit Johnson for
making it back. "Kylie's just so

courageous. She's been working
so hard to get ready for this."
He continued to explain that
Johnson was hurting herself early
in the year by trying to do too
much before she was ready. Even
tually, Brennan said, Johnson told
him what she could and could not
do — and didn't push herself
beyond the limit.
"Her honesty with the coach
ing staff was really important,"
Brennan said. "Her honesty really
kept her in the lineup."
Some days, Johnson said, all
she could give in practice was 45
minutes. Many times, she left
early. The frustration of a a will
ing mind and incapable body
might have led many to give up.
But Johnson was determined
and that pulled her through —
especially yesterday. On April 20
at UCLA, Cammie Foley crushed
her 6-2, 6-2. When the Cardinal
squared off against the Bruins in
the championship match, Foley
was again on the other side of the
net.
Did any self-doubt creep into
Johnson's mind? No siree. "I
didn't ever think about losing. I
don't think you can," she said.
That was good news for Stan
ford, which needed a Johnson win
badlv yesterday. Ahead 4-1, the
Cardinal desparately wanted to
win in singles because, with
Birch's status in doubt, the dou
bles situation was shakv at best.
And when all the attention
shifted to her court, when Kvlie
Johnson could give Stanford a
national crown, all the months of
hard work paid off in a big way.
Johnson gritted out a tough
three-setter, killing off the Bruins'

Two-thirds of Stanford's 1991
singles lineup was there last sea
son. Sandra Birch, Debbie Gra
ham, Teri Whitlinger and Heather
Willens were key cogs in the
machine that brought home the
Cardinal's fifth straight title a
year ago.
The remaining two players that
helped make it six in a row yester
day, weren't on the courts in
Gainesville, Fla., last May. One,
freshman Laxmi Poruri, was still
in high school. The other, Kvlie
Johnson, was a spectator.
Each overcame bumpy roads to
these championships. Together,
their spectacular play over the
past four days was critical in Stan
ford becoming the first host
school to win the NCAA title.
Poruri's freshman season has
had its ups and downs. The pres
sure of adjusting to college — and
college tennis — have taxed her at
times.
But like Willens and Johnson
before her, Poruri has become yet
another in the long line of Stan
ford freshman to come up big at
the national championships.
Make that huge. Poruri won all
her matches in straight sets and
was one of the first players off for
the Cardinal each day. The pres
sure of repeating, of winning
again, seemed to have no affect on
her.
"Ignorance is bliss," coach
Frank Brennan said. "The fresh
man don't know the pressure 'til
it's all over. . . . Laxmi Poruri was
awesome."
Indeed she was — and loving
every minute of it. "We proved to
everybody we're still the champi
ons," said an ecstatic Poruri. "I
can definitely say this is one of the
best moments of my life."
All those years of junior tennis,
of being out there all alone, had
been replaced by the chance to
play with people, to strive for a
common goal.
"We were so close as a team,"
she said. "During Stanford's his

cially not after the Cardinal lost 6-
0 to Florida at the National Team
Indoors back on March 3.
"We went through a lot — get
ting blown away. We've been bear
ing a lot of doubt," Poruri
explained. But the doubt came
from outside, not from the team.
The Cardinal pulled together and
re-learned what it took to make
the team so successful.
Though Poruri is in just her
first year here, she knew what
that was. "Stanford is solid — like
a steel wall," she said. "It's not
like we fluctuate."
There are countless reasons for
that. One of them is that everyone
remembers the special feeling
they had the first time they were
an NCAA champ — and wants to
share it."I got teary eyed when we
won," Whitlinger said. "I wanted
to win it for the freshman."
Johnson remembered winning
as a freshman and what a great
experience it was for her but said,
"This year beats it out. It means a
lot more to me."
