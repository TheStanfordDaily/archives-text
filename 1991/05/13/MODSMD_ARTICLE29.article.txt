The Stanford women's track
team travelled to the Modesto
Invitational Saturday to qual
ify some athletes for the NCAA
Championships.
Although they posted some
good marks, no one qualified.
Junior Chryste Gaines ran
the 100 meters, recording a
time of 11.39 seconds. It is
under the qualifying standard
but Gaines has a better mark of
11.28 from a week ago.
Although pleased with the
time and the conditions at the
track, she was not entirely sat
isfied with her race.
"I didn't feel like I had any
turnover until the very end. It
was a good time," Gaines said.
"The track is fast and you
usually get a (tail) wind."
Gaines skipped the 200 but
ran anchor on the 4xloo relay
team. At Big Meet the four
some of junior Jackie Edwards,
sophomore Rhonda Oliver,
senior Alysia Hubbard and
Gaines ran a school record of
45.32 seconds.
This weekend, however,
Hubbard could not run due to a
knee injury so Alison Callicoate
took her place. The squad took

second place with a time of
45.88.
One person who was not
pleaded with her performance
was senior 1,500 meters run
ner, Melanie Bloch.
"I was kicking and running
by some people [at the finish]. I
knew I hadn't run well and
that was enough for me. I
didn't look for the time or the
place," Bloch said.
She will have a chance to
improve her performance at
the Pacific 10 Championships
which begin this week in
Tempe, Ariz.
Bloch took first in the 1,500
last year and is one of the
favorites to win this year.
Her toughest competition
will come from last year's run
ner-up, Bridget Smyth from
Arizona. Smyth is the only
competitor in the conference to
run the 1,500 meters in under
four minutes, 20 seconds this
year.
Teammate Gaines expects to
defend her 100-meter title.
Gaines believes the 100-meter
field will be fast but anticipates
little competition in the 200.
Senior Peggy Odita hopes to
make it two years in a row as
the Pac-10 heptathlon cham
pion.
