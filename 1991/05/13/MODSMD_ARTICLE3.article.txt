## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
Student, Affairs officials will
meet today with Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity members to
discuss an incident at a closed
party April 20 in which a prospec
tive freshman allegedly got drunk.
The University is evaluating
the incident based on a report
submitted by the fraternity May 6
and additional interviews, said
Nanci Howe, director of the Office
of Student Activities.
If the incident is true, it could
be a violation of the University
alcohol policy, according to Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Allison Sandy.
It would be "premature to spec
ulate" on the consequences the
Dekes will face if found guilty of
violating the alcohol policy, Howe
said. The fraternity is not on pro
bation during the investigation.
University administrators
received a report of the violations
while investigating alcohol
related incidents surrounding
Alpha Sigma's Kxotic Erotic party.
The prospective freshman — a
minor — was arrested outside
that party for being drunk in pub
lic. Alpha Sig was not held respon
sible for the incident and was
removed from social suspension
