# Underage drinking incident examined
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
Student, Affairs officials will
meet today with Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity members to
discuss an incident at a closed
party April 20 in which a prospec
tive freshman allegedly got drunk.
The University is evaluating
the incident based on a report
submitted by the fraternity May 6
and additional interviews, said
Nanci Howe, director of the Office
of Student Activities.
If the incident is true, it could
be a violation of the University
alcohol policy, according to Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Allison Sandy.
It would be "premature to spec
ulate" on the consequences the
Dekes will face if found guilty of
violating the alcohol policy, Howe
said. The fraternity is not on pro
bation during the investigation.
University administrators
received a report of the violations
while investigating alcohol
related incidents surrounding
Alpha Sigma's Kxotic Erotic party.
The prospective freshman — a
minor — was arrested outside
that party for being drunk in pub
lic. Alpha Sig was not held respon
sible for the incident and was
removed from social suspension
last week.
Deke President Pete Huyck
said his fraternity took "every
possible security measure" at the
party, including checking student
IDs and requiring each person
attending the party to sign a state
ment acknowledging the alcohol
policy and California state alcohol
laws.
Huyck said the party was not
one of the fraternity's three offi
cial alcohol-free Rush functions.
Invitations were issued to only
about 50 people, he added.
The prospective freshman
must have "purposely eluded our

security" since he never signed in
at the door, said Huyck. The
prospective freshman had
attended a Rush function the
Wednesday before, and many
Dekes assumed he was a student
rushing the house, Huyck said.
Huyck said he thinks the Uni
versity is responsible for prospec
tive freshmen since it invites
them to visit Stanford but does
not provide a method for fraterni
ties to distinguish them from stu
dents. Since Stanford IDs lack
photos, fraternities have no way
of determining whether an indi
vidual is a legitimate student or
using a borrowed ID, Huyck said.
"The University does not do a
responsible job of inviting
[prospective freshmen] and caring
for them properly," Huyck said.
