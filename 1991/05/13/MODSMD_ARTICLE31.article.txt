# Card nine drops two of three to Cal
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Chalk up the home-field advan
tage as the latest concept ruined
in the ongoing saga of Bear versus
Cardinal, as neither Stanford nor
California had much success on
their native baseball diamonds
this weekend.

Baseball
Including Thursday's make-up
game, both teams won twice on
the road, with California taking
two of three over the weekend in
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division series finale for each
squad. The Cardinal won Thurs
day 7-6 to clinch second place in
the Six-Pac, but took it to the chin
9-5 Friday at Sunken Diamond
before winning up in Berkeley 11-
9 and dropping yesterday's game
8-5.
The four-game series closes the
Cardinal out at 18-12 in league
play, 36-19 overall. The Bears
improved to 14-16, good for third
in the Six-Pac, and 33-25 overall.
After clinching second and vir
tually assuring themselves a place

in the 48-team NCAA field, the
question of a let-down is raised,
but Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said that played only e small
part in his team's losses over the
weekend.
"I think the intensity has been
good," Marquess said. "We had a
little let-down on Friday, but the
two games over at Cal and today's
game were good. I think the inten
sity was fine."
Unfortunately the pitching did
not match. The Cardinal strug
gled on the mound all weekend,
even during its victory on Satur
day at frigid Evans Diamond.
Freshman Willie Adams started
the contest for Stanford, giving up
eight hits, nine runs (five earned)
and six walks before giving way to
reliever Scott Weiss in the sev
enth.
Adams hit Reid Neumann in
the fifth with the bases loaded to
give California a 5-3 lead, and also
gave up two homers on the day,
the last a two-run shot in the sev
enth by Dean Hashimoto that tied
the score at seven and sent the big
right-hander packing. Weiss came
in and did not allow a run, guiding
the Cardinal to victory behind
Matt Bokemeier's sacrifice fly in
the eighth and Steve Solomon's
RBI double in the ninth.
"I felt good," said Weiss. "I was
scared earlier when it was so cold

because I didn't know if I could
loosen up, but I actually loosened
up pretty quickly. My stuff was
the best it's been in a few games."
Weiss struck out three and gave
up five hits to pick up his second
victory over the Bears in three
days. The righty went to 7-6 on
the year in closing what was really
a tough victory for the Cardinal.
The game was close all the way
through and saw the score tied
four different times.
Jeffrey Hammonds and Ryan
Turner were the big men for the
Cardinal offense as each picked up
three RBI on multiple-hit days.
Hammonds went 3-for-5, and
Turner went 2-for-4 in a game
that came as a nice antidote to the
loss at home the day before.
"(Friday) we had a let-down in
effort," said Turner after the
game. "Today we had a good
effort all around; we got hits when
it counted."
Fifteen of them actually, in an
area sorely lacking the day before.
Friday's game saw seven Stanford
hits, but five of those came in the
first inning when the team scored
four of its runs. Stanford's day
was highlighted in the bottom of
the second when Troy Tallman hit
his sixth homer of the year to give
the team a momentary 4-3 lead.
California came back to tie the
game in the third, and then took

'(Friday) we had a let
down in effort. Today
we had a good effort
all around.'

over for good in the fourth when
Dan Cholowsky broke the 4-4 tie
with a two-run homer off Cardinal
starter Jamie Sepeda.
"I put the ball where I wanted
it; (Cholowsky) just did his job,"
said Sepeda. "They are good hit
ters, but I never got into it. I
didn't feel comfortable, and I
don't know why. It was a tough
day."
Sepeda took the loss to go 6-2
on the year. The sophomore gave
up seven hits and seven runs, all
of them earned.
"I don't think (Sepeda) had real
good command," said Marquess.
"He was missing with all his
pitches and didn't have real good
command, and that's a bad combi
nation."
Stanford had a chance to
redeem itself at home yesterday,
but lost a 5-5 tie in the eighth
when Aaron Dorlarque struggled
and gave up three runs. Dorlarque
had come in after starter Brian
Sackinsky lasted only three bat
ters, giving up two runs to get the
Cardinal behind early. It was a
quick yank, but one that made
sense to both sides.
"(Sackinsky) had nothing,"
said Marquess. "I went out to talk
to him and he said he had no
rhythm. He just was all out of
sync. It's just one of those things."
Dorlarque came in to pitch
eight and a third innings, doing a
good job keeping Stanford in the
game against California's predom
inantly left-handed line-up until
the eighth, when he gave up a
lead-ofT solo homer to Matt Luke
and a two-run single to Matt
Hansen, bringing the score to its
finale 8-5. After the game the
right-hander was not faulted for
his effort.
"I thought (Dorlarque) did just
great," pitching coach Tom Dun
ton said. "Facing all those lefties
makes it difficult, but Dorlarque
is just so competitive; there is no
love lost (between him and Cali
fornia)."
Hammonds tied the score in
the seventh with a single to the
right of second base that scored
lead-off hitter David Cornell, but
the Cardinal could get no closer.
Hammonds finished the day 2-for
-4 with two RBI, and Cornell
scored four times with one RBI,
also going 2-for-4.

eight and a third innings, doing a
good job keeping Stanford in the
game against California's predom
inantly left-handed line-up until
the eighth, when he gave up a
lead-ofT solo homer to Matt Luke
and a two-run single to Matt
Hansen, bringing the score to its
finale 8-5. After the game the
right-hander was not faulted for
his effort.
"I thought (Dorlarque) did just
great," pitching coach Tom Dun
ton said. "Facing all those lefties
makes it difficult, but Dorlarque
is just so competitive; there is no
love lost (between him and Cali
fornia)."
Hammonds tied the score in
the seventh with a single to the
right of second base that scored
lead-off hitter David Cornell, but
the Cardinal could get no closer.
Hammonds finished the day 2-for
-4 with two RBI, and Cornell
scored four times with one RBI,
also going 2-for-4.

Cat's Matt Hansen isn't too happy with the home-plate umpire after Aaron Dorlarque blew a strike by him
In yesterday's game. Hansen had the last laugh, however, as the Golden Bears defeated the Cardinal 8-
5 at Sunken Diamond.
Chalk up the home-field advan
tage as the latest concept ruined
in the ongoing saga of Bear versus
Cardinal, as neither Stanford nor
California had much success on
their native baseball diamonds
this weekend.

Baseball
Including Thursday's make-up
game, both teams won twice on
the road, with California taking
two of three over the weekend in
the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division series finale for each
squad. The Cardinal won Thurs
day 7-6 to clinch second place in
the Six-Pac, but took it to the chin
9-5 Friday at Sunken Diamond
before winning up in Berkeley 11-
9 and dropping yesterday's game
8-5.
The four-game series closes the
Cardinal out at 18-12 in league
play, 36-19 overall. The Bears
improved to 14-16, good for third
in the Six-Pac, and 33-25 overall.
After clinching second and vir
tually assuring themselves a place

in the 48-team NCAA field, the
question of a let-down is raised,
but Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said that played only e small
part in his team's losses over the
weekend.
"I think the intensity has been
good," Marquess said. "We had a
little let-down on Friday, but the
two games over at Cal and today's
game were good. I think the inten
sity was fine."
Unfortunately the pitching did
not match. The Cardinal strug
gled on the mound all weekend,
even during its victory on Satur
day at frigid Evans Diamond.
Freshman Willie Adams started
the contest for Stanford, giving up
eight hits, nine runs (five earned)
and six walks before giving way to
reliever Scott Weiss in the sev
enth.
Adams hit Reid Neumann in
the fifth with the bases loaded to
give California a 5-3 lead, and also
gave up two homers on the day,
the last a two-run shot in the sev
enth by Dean Hashimoto that tied
the score at seven and sent the big
right-hander packing. Weiss came
in and did not allow a run, guiding
the Cardinal to victory behind
Matt Bokemeier's sacrifice fly in
the eighth and Steve Solomon's
RBI double in the ninth.
"I felt good," said Weiss. "I was
scared earlier when it was so cold

because I didn't know if I could
loosen up, but I actually loosened
up pretty quickly. My stuff was
the best it's been in a few games."
Weiss struck out three and gave
up five hits to pick up his second
victory over the Bears in three
days. The righty went to 7-6 on
the year in closing what was really
a tough victory for the Cardinal.
The game was close all the way
through and saw the score tied
four different times.
Jeffrey Hammonds and Ryan
Turner were the big men for the
Cardinal offense as each picked up
three RBI on multiple-hit days.
Hammonds went 3-for-5, and
Turner went 2-for-4 in a game
that came as a nice antidote to the
loss at home the day before.
"(Friday) we had a let-down in
effort," said Turner after the
game. "Today we had a good
effort all around; we got hits when
it counted."
Fifteen of them actually, in an
area sorely lacking the day before.
Friday's game saw seven Stanford
hits, but five of those came in the
first inning when the team scored
four of its runs. Stanford's day
was highlighted in the bottom of
the second when Troy Tallman hit
his sixth homer of the year to give
the team a momentary 4-3 lead.
California came back to tie the
game in the third, and then took

down in effort. Today
we had a good effort
all around.'

over for good in the fourth when
Dan Cholowsky broke the 4-4 tie
with a two-run homer off Cardinal
starter Jamie Sepeda.
"I put the ball where I wanted
it; (Cholowsky) just did his job,"
said Sepeda. "They are good hit
ters, but I never got into it. I
didn't feel comfortable, and I
don't know why. It was a tough
day."
Sepeda took the loss to go 6-2
on the year. The sophomore gave
up seven hits and seven runs, all
of them earned.
"I don't think (Sepeda) had real
good command," said Marquess.
"He was missing with all his
pitches and didn't have real good
command, and that's a bad combi
nation."
Stanford had a chance to
redeem itself at home yesterday,
but lost a 5-5 tie in the eighth
when Aaron Dorlarque struggled
and gave up three runs. Dorlarque
had come in after starter Brian
Sackinsky lasted only three bat
ters, giving up two runs to get the
Cardinal behind early. It was a
quick yank, but one that made
sense to both sides.
"(Sackinsky) had nothing,"
said Marquess. "I went out to talk
to him and he said he had no
rhythm. He just was all out of
sync. It's just one of those things."
Dorlarque came in to pitch
eight and a third innings, doing a
good job keeping Stanford in the
game against California's predom
inantly left-handed line-up until
the eighth, when he gave up a
lead-ofT solo homer to Matt Luke
and a two-run single to Matt
