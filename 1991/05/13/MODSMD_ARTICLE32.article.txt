## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford students tes
tified before congressional staff
members at a United States
Student Association financial
aid hearing held at UC-Davis
Saturday.
Freshman Perry Arnold and
graduate student Derek Miya
hara spoke for about five min
utes each and discussed their
own experiences with financial
aid.
The hearing was organized
to solicit student opinion on
the federal reauthorization of
financial aid, which is sched
uled to be completed next year.
President Bush has proposed a
shift in financial aid packages
from grants to loans, among
other changes.
Several local members of
Congress sponsored the hear
ing, including Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.; Sen. John
Seymour, R-Calif.; Rep. Bar
bara Boxer, D-San Rafael; Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Sacramento;
and Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Sacra
mento. The representatives
and senators did not attend the
hearing but sent their staff
members instead, and all of the
testimony will appear in the
Congressional Record.
The hearing, held in a
lounge outside the UC-Davis
swimming pool, attracted
about 35 people representing
10 colleges and universities.
Stanford was the only private

university represented.
Eight Stanford students,
including Arnold and Miya
hara, attended. ASSU Senator
Naomi Onaga, a senior, was a
co-chair of the hearing.
Nine students testified, and
a two-hour "spirited question
and-answer period followed
that mostly involved testimony
from the audience," Miyahara
a *f!liyahara said the message
the congressional staff mem
bers received was an important
one. He added that many staff
members agreed with the stu
dents about the issues.
"It is tough preaching to the
converted, but hopefully we
will give them some ammuni
tion for when they talk to their
colleagues in Congress and
gain supporters," Miyahara
said.
While the testimony was a
"very important beginning
step," Arnold said "a lot more
is needed."
Critics of the ASSU's mem
bership in the United States
Student Association said the
hearing did not ease their
f earS
"I don't see where USSA
provided an invaluable role,"
said Council of Presidents-elect
member John Overdeck, who
attended the hearing. "It
doesn't appear to be powerful
or well organized, and we
might have to take things into
our own hands" to lobby on
financial aid.
