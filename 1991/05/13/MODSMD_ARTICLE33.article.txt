# Computerized Draw remains dream
## 
### David Wallace 
The computerized housing lot
tery announced last fall remains a
dream seven months later.
The Draw is still the Draw.
But this week's Draw will likely
be the last of its kind. Housing
officials say they are "streamlin
ing" the current process and plan
to implement the computerized
lottery next year, when student
residences are more fully con
nected to the University computer
system.
"The student on-line access
project has been delayed,"
Housing Director Rodger Whitney
said. The project will ultimately
connect residence computer clus
ters to the Registrar's Office and
other facilities.
As part of the plan, the com
puterized lottery will eventually

allow students to make housing
choices and receive a Draw num
ber in their residences, thus elim
inating the need to wait in line.
This year's Draw will retain
the old structure, minus two
familiar features: the Draw theme
and live television coverage.
The University's budget cuts
and "repositioning" forced the
Housing Office to end the Draw
theme tradition, Whitney said.
XTV decided not to present its
usual live, play-by-play coverage
of the Draw because "it's a long,
grueling job to cover it. . . and we
don't have as much money as last
year," said station manager
Kalinda Ukanwa.
This year's Draw will be held in
Oak Lounge West in Tresidder
Union, which provides more space
than the previous Old Union
Clubhouse location, Whitney said.

The Draw will be held today,
tomorrow and Wednesday from 10
a.m. to noon and from 1:15 to 4
p.m.
Whitney also said there are sev
eral other changes in the housing
system:
• The special priority system
has been overhauled this year,
because "a lot of priorities had lost
their meaning," Whitney said.
The University eliminated pri
orities at Toyon Hall, Mirrielees
Apartments, Storey House and
553 Mayfield and allowed priori
ties only for cooperates and theme
houses — the two types of houses
"which need them," he said.
• Freshmen no longer have to
designate their unguaranteed
year. Unlike in past years, stu
dents will be able to claim a guar
anteed year in the Draw without
deciding ahead of time or standing

in line at the Housing Office to
change a previous decision.
• Trancos, which is now
reserved for freshmen, will enter
the Draw this year as a four-class
dorm, and the Grove houses, cur
rently occupied by Synergy, will
return to the Draw.
• Stern Hall food service and
the new Kimball Hall will use the
point system next year, joining
Ricker Dining Center. The Flo
rence Moore Hall and Wilbur Hall
food services will continue all-you
can-eat board plans next year,
despite earlier announcements
that they would also change.
Whitney said the Stern conver
sion will give the University a
chance to evaluate the change;
plus, with the current budget
crunch, "it would be too costly to
do all three at once."
