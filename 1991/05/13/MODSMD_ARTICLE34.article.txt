# Homeless man rescued from seizure in creek
## 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
A transient man was pulled out
of the Menlo Park Creek bed at El
Camino Real near the Stanford
Shopping Center last night and
taken to Stanford Hospital after
suffering ten bouts of grand mal
seizures.
A team of eight firefighters and
paramedics were called to the
scene by the man's wife at 8:21

p.m. after he began coughing up
blood.
The man, known as Randall,
has had these seizures before.
Menlo Park police officer Andrew
Kline said they are "common
among alcoholics."
Kline said Randall was a
"familiar subject" and "has been
transported before."
Randall will not be charged
criminally, Kline added. "This is
strictly medical," he said.

His wife, Lenis, said the
seizures "started a couple of years
ago, but he has flashbacks all the
time."
She said Randall was a prisoner
of war during the Vietnam war.
The couple met on the streets
four years ago and got married
after a year, Lenis added.
Randall was visiting a friend,
Don, who said he "camps out" in
the creek. Don said Randall had
just come from a barbecue near

the Menlo Park Safeway store.
He added that Randall would
have been fine if "he didn't mess
up taking his medicine."
Before the seizures got bad,
Lenis said, Randall worked as a
furniture stripper. "What do you
do when you can't find work
because you have seizures?"
Lenis said she "just got over
cancer" and is now "legally dis
abled," so she cannot find work.
