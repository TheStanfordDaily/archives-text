More than 20,000 people attended the 20th
Annual Stanford Powwow this weekend, capping
a year of preparation by the Stanford American
Indian Organization and Native American stu
dents.
"It's gone really well," said sophomore Nyleta
Belgarde, one of the event's coordinators.
The annual powwow is the largest student-run
event on campus and one of the largest powwows

on the West Coast.
The event, held on the soccer fields next to
Stanford Stadium, featured more than 90 booths
showcasing Native American crafts, food and
activities.
Booths selling traditional foods such as "Nava
jo Tacos" and "Buffalo Burgers" sat alongside
booths of organizations such as the "Bay Area
American Indians Bowling Association" and
"Debbie's Wolf Pack Traders."

Sunday's featured activity was
a traditional powwow ceremony
that included more than 200
dancers. The performers wore the
traditional costumes of Native
American tribes from all over the
United States and Canada, said
sophomore Tim Wilcox, another
coordinator.
On Saturday, a ceremony fea
tured high-school students from
Alaska. The students performed
songs and dances representing
several Northwest Coast tribes,
including the Tlingit, Tsimpsian
and Haida.
The annual powwow event has
grown since it began in 1971. At
that time there were only 20
dancers and a crowd of 500,

according to the powwow's pro
gram guide.
The powwow is dedicated every
year to the memory of the 250
Minneconjou Sioux who were
massacred at Wounded Knee,
S.D., in 1890.
And for the fourth straight
year, the powwow carried the
theme "A Celebration of Indian
Sobriety." According to the pro
gram, the theme is a "celebration
of our cultures' traditional values
before the introduction of alcohol
to our people."
The powwow also honored
Native Americans and Alaska
Natives who have served in the
U.S. military. "On a symbolic
level, they represent the spiritual
strength and endurance that has
been characteristic of American
Indian history and culture," the
program said.
