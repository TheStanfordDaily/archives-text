More than 20,000 people attended the 20th
Annual Stanford Powwow this weekend, capping
a year of preparation by the Stanford American
Indian Organization and Native American stu
dents.
"It's gone really well," said sophomore Nyleta
Belgarde, one of the event's coordinators.
The annual powwow is the largest student-run
event on campus and one of the largest powwows

on the West Coast.
The event, held on the soccer fields next to
Stanford Stadium, featured more than 90 booths
showcasing Native American crafts, food and
activities.
Booths selling traditional foods such as "Nava
jo Tacos" and "Buffalo Burgers" sat alongside
booths of organizations such as the "Bay Area
American Indians Bowling Association" and
"Debbie's Wolf Pack Traders."
