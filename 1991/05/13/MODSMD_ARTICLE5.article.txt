# Keefe won't go pro
## Junior to stay at Stanford next year 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Midterms, papers and finals
beat out cars, condos and lots of
spare cash Friday morning, as
junior Adam Keefe announced
that he will return to Stanford
next year instead of entering the
NBA draft.
Keefe, who led the Stanford
men's basketball team to the 1991
National Invitation Tournament
championship, made the an
nouncement at a 9 a.m. press con
ference: He's in no rush to leave
school.
"It was a difficult decision, but
I think in the long run spending
the year back here with my team
mates and friends would be more
valuable than the money I'd go
out and make," Keefe said.
That would have been a lot of
money, for Keefe estimates he
would have been drafted from
12th to 16th in the first round had
he chosen to leave school. That
translates into roughly a four
year contract at $1 million per
year.
"The money is just absurd,"
Keefe said. "1 could probably
spend four to five thousand of it
and be happy. My lifestyle proba
bly wouldn't change very much."
"Remember that statement
five years from now," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery cracked.
Had Keefe turned pro, that
money very likely would have
come from the Golden State War
riors, who have pick No. 16.
"I think thev would've liked to

take me," Keefe said. "Nothing's
concrete in the draft, (but) that
was a lot of people's opinion. ... I

would have loved
to have played for
the Warriors. It
would have been
great."
And yet Keefe
will come back to
Stanford, where
he'll be the Cardi
nal's only return
ing starter in

1991-92. That fact, along with the
pounding he took last season,
made his decision somewhat more
difficult.
"Earlier (right after the sea
son), I was beat up, I was tired,"
Keefe said. "We'd just done some
thing that hadn't been done here
in a long time, and the four guys
I'd done it with were leaving.
"Now that it's spring quarter,
though, I've been able to take in
the whole picture, instead of just
looking at basketball."
The whole picture, in the end,
won out over just the business pic
ture. "There's so much going on
here," Keefe said. "It came down
to basically just being a kid and
not having any real responsibility.
That suits me, seeing how imma
ture and childish I am."
"We're delighted to have him
back," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Now we've got to
get to the business of surprising a
few people next year."
And Keefe can get back to to
the business of school work, secure
in the thought that all that money
will come — next year.
