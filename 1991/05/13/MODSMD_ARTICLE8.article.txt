# Drama depicts peaceful Malcolm X
## Biographical play kicks off week celebrating black leader's life 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
"When I am dead ... the white
man, in his press, is going to iden
tify me with 'hate' . . . will make
use of me ... as a convenient sym
bol of 'hatred.'" So said Malcolm
X, one of this nation's most con
troversial and misunderstood
black leaders, in a speech just
before his assassination in 1965.
To commemorate his life,
Omega Psi Phi, a black fraternity,
and the Black Student Union
sponsored a dramatic perfor
mance Friday night depicting the
life of the late civil rights leader.
The one-man show by actor Ver
non Van was attended by more
than 80 people at Lagunita Court
and kicked off a week-long cele
bration of Malcolm X's contribu
tions to the civil rights movement.
• The program traced Malcolm
,X's evolution as an activist and a
Muslim while emphasizing how
and misrepre
sented he was by the mainstream
'American media. The goal of the
performance, according to Van,
!was to demonstrate "that Mal
colm X was not a racist, was not a
•violent man, that [he] was a very
loving individual."
i The program focused on sev
eral events during Malcolm X's
childhood that helped shape his
future activism. When Malcolm X
was six years old, his father died
when he was beaten and then
thrown in front of a streetcar.
When he was 14, he was told by
his favorite teacher that he could
never become a lawyer because he
was a "nigger."
After that point, Malcolm X
effectively gave up on school and
resigned himself to a life on the
streets. He was finally arrested for
burglary and sentenced to 10
years in prison.
While in prison, he converted
to Islam and became a disciple of
Elijah Mohammed, founder of the
Nation of Islam. Upon his release
from prison, Malcolm X became
the national spokesperson for the
organization.
It was at this juncture that he
began to express his belief that
the white man was the devil, a
legacy that lingers with his mem
ory today. This belief, according to

the performance, arose because
Malcolm X had only experienced
hatred and oppression from white
America.
"The media turned and twisted
my words so my own brothers
turned against me," Van por
trayed Malcolm X as saying.
However, in 1964 Malcolm X
went on a hajj, the Muslim pil
grimage to Mecca. There, he
learned that, in fact, all races can
peacefully coexist in equality.
"I believe in a society in which
people can live like human beings
on the basis of equality," Malcolm
X said in a speech after his return
from Mecca to the United States.
Malcolm X then renounced his
belief that the white man was the
devil and left the Nation of Islam.
He came "to judge men by his
deeds and not by his color,"
according to the performance.
In a speech just five days before
his death, Malcolm X said, "[We
are not] anti-white, anti-blue,
anti-green or anti-yellow . . .
We're against anybody who wants
to practice some form of segrega
tion or discrimination against us."
Audience members seemed to
agree that Malcolm X is an
extremely misunderstood figure.
"People don't know enough about
him ... he is purposely evaded,"
said freshman Mariama Smith.
One objective of the perfor
mance, according to Jason Dicks,
a member of Omega Psi Phi, was
to heighten the awareness on
campus of Malcolm X's goals and
of how these views and ideals can
be applied today. "His life was a
progression from a more radical
stage to an all-encompassing view
of the world."
Malcolm X "paved the way for
[Martin Luther] King," Dicks
added.
According to Nelda Brown, an
outgoing officer of the BSU, for
college students in the black com
munity "Malcolm X has a lot more
influence than King because he
represents action and standing up
for what you believe in." She said
that King has a stronger influence
in the South, where he spent most
of his life.
"King didn't necessarily
address things in the North . . .
people definitely identify with

1 Malcolm XI much more than
with King," said junior Michelle
Branch.
According to junior Mike
Friedly, who is helping History
Prof. Clavborne Carson write a
book on Malcolm X, "King's image
has been tarnished quite a bit; he
is no longer seen as a semi-god.
Malcolm X has taken up the slack
a little bit in terms of being a role
model."

Carson is also head of the Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject.
Malcolm X Week runs through
May 18. A variety of events are
scheduled, including a speech by
Bobby Seale of the Black Panther
Party tonight in Annenberg Audi
torium at 7:30 p.m. The events
are sponsored by the BSU and
Omega Psi Phi.


Actor Vernon Van plays Malcolm X in a one-man show at Lagunita
Court Friday night. Van said the goal of his performance was to
show that "Malcolm X was not a racist, was not a violent man, that
[he] was a very loving individual."
