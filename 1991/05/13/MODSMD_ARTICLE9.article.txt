# IFC: No rule bars double-pledging
## 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
In response to a University
investigation of double-pledg
ing by new members of Alpha
Epsilon Pi and Theta Delta Chi
fraternities, the Interfrater
nity Council is claiming that
"there is no University prohibi
tion on pledging two fraterni
ties."
In a Thursday letter to act
ing Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson, the IFC states
that "any decision to the con
trary would be groundless and
be nothing more than an ad
hoc attempt at manufacturing
a new policy."
An AEPi spokesperson has
admitted that some pledges
were planning to join two fra
ternities, and new Theta Delt
pledges have failed to submit
signed housing cards to the
University affirming that they
are only joining a single frater
nity.
The IFC letter claims that
legal advice sought by the two
fraternities backs their con
tention that there is no Univer
sity policy prohibiting double
pledging. But Diana Conklin,
acting associate dean of stu
dent affairs, said the lack of an
explicit policy does not mean
that certain actions are allow
able.
"There is also no policy pro
hibiting them from grazing cat
tle on the roof," she said.
IFC Vice President and
AEPi member Keith Rabois
said AEPi-Theta Delt joint
pledges are not planning to
sign the new cards pending the
outcome of a meeting this
afternoon between University
officials and the leadership of
the Theta Delts. The meeting
was originally slated for last
Friday but had to be resched
uled for today.
Rabois, who co-authored the
letter with three other IFC
members, wrote that the IFC
has learned that several fresh
men wanted to pledge both fra

ternities in order to "benefit
from the brotherhood and Jew
ish tradition" of AEPi while
"being able to experience the
social opportunities" of Theta
Delt.
"They will, therefore,
undergo the pledge training
program of both fraternities,"
the letter continues.
Rabois said the letter has
been approved by the IFC exec
utive board, which consists of
its president, vice president,
secretary, community service
representative and Rush chair.
The letter further argues
that a policy permitting dou
ble-pledging and allowing men
to be involved in"the rituals
and traditions of two very
diverse organizations" would
contribute "positively to the
University's commitment to
multiculturalism."
According to Rabois, the
University's decision to print
special housing guarantee
cards requiring signatories to
say they are not members of
another fraternity "proves that
the old cards did not prohibit
double pledging." The old
housing guarantee cards did
not include this qualification.
Because it failed to meet its
pledge quota for the past three
years, the Theta Delt house
could have been placed in the
Draw if it did not receive
enough pledges this year. But
19 students pledged the frater
nity this spring.
Conklin, however, said that
without the signed statements
from Theta Delt pledges, the
University will not count them
toward fulfilling the frater
nity's pledge quota. "As of right
now, the house has not made
quota," she said.
University officials sched
uled to attend today's meeting
are Robinson, Conklin, Row
Director Jack Chin, Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson, Office of Stu
dent Activities Director Nanci
Howe and Housing Director
Rodger Whitney.
