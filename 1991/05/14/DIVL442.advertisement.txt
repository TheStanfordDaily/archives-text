KEPLER'S PRESENTS
Peter Ustinov
Peter Ustinov, Oscar-winning actor and director, author of
twenty-five works of fiction and nonfiction, and recently
knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1990, will read from his third
novel, THE OLD MAN AND MR. SMITH. The Old Man and
Mr. Smith are the most surprising couple in recent fiction:
they are no less than God and Satan, reunited for the first
time since the Fall, on a fact-finding mission to planet earth.
The Old Man and Mr. Smith is a parable for our times,
written by a master storyteller, who shows us our vulnerable
world through the eyes of two slightly weary immortals.
