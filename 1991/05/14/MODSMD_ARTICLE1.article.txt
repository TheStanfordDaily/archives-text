# Black grad seeks bone marrow
## Students, staff help lawyer in fight against killer disease

Stanford Law School prepared San
dra Willis for a life as a lawyer. After
graduating in 1979, she dove headlong
into the legal profession with a simple
philosophy — to be in control of every
thing a courtroom could throw at her.
That philosophy carried Willis from
the cavernous corridors of the Justice
Department to the fluorescent-lit hall
ways of a top San Francisco law firm
where she was recently named part
ner.
But law school could not prepare
the 43-year-old mother of two for the
unwelcomed challenge she now faces
outside the familiar confines of the
courtroom — a battle that has shaken
the cool, steely disposition of the
defense attorney.
Willis has cancer. "For the first
time in my life, there is nothing I can
do to change the outcome," she said.
In September 1990, Willis was diag

nosed with chronic myelogenous
leukemia, a disease in which cancer
ous white blood cells grow and spread
throughout the body, infiltrating and
destroying vital organs.
The disease is curable. High doses
of radiation and chemotherapy can
kill the renegade white blood cells. In
the process, however, life-sustaining
red blood cells are also destroyed.
Willis' doctor has told her that in
addition to the chemotherapy she is
currently receiving, Willis ultimately
must undergo a bone marrow trans
plant — replacing her body's own
faulty bone marrow with marrow that
produces non-cancerous blood cells —
or she will die within five years.
But cancer is not Willis' only
enemy Her race is too.
The odds for a successful bone mar
row transplant are increased when a
patient receives marrow from a donor
whose marrow possesses a similar
genetic structure and matches in six
key antigens, or proteins. Given the

unique genetic structure of bone mar
row cells in black people, doctors say
that Willis needs marrow from a per
son of her own ethnic group.
But black people, for a host of rea
sons, donate bone marrow as well as
blood and other organs in numbers
that are disproportionately lower than
the number of potential black donors
in the general population.
"If you are black and have leukemia
and need a bone marrow transplant, it
is practically a death sentence," said
Paulette Bryant, a Harvard-trained
hematologist at the Stanford Blood
Bank.
The statistics are telling. According
to the Minnesota-based National Mar
row Donor Program, the country's
largest registry network of its kind,
only 9,500 of 320,000 registered indi
viduals are black — 2.9 percent of the
registry.
Since 96 percent of people in the
