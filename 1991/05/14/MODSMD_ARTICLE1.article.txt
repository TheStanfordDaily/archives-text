# Black grad seeks bone marrow
## Students, staff help lawyer in fight against killer disease 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Stanford Law School prepared San
dra Willis for a life as a lawyer. After
graduating in 1979, she dove headlong
into the legal profession with a simple
philosophy — to be in control of every
thing a courtroom could throw at her.
That philosophy carried Willis from
the cavernous corridors of the Justice
Department to the fluorescent-lit hall
ways of a top San Francisco law firm
where she was recently named part
ner.
But law school could not prepare
the 43-year-old mother of two for the
unwelcomed challenge she now faces
outside the familiar confines of the
courtroom — a battle that has shaken
the cool, steely disposition of the
defense attorney.
Willis has cancer. "For the first
time in my life, there is nothing I can
do to change the outcome," she said.
In September 1990, Willis was diag

nosed with chronic myelogenous
leukemia, a disease in which cancer
ous white blood cells grow and spread
throughout the body, infiltrating and
destroying vital organs.
The disease is curable. High doses
of radiation and chemotherapy can
kill the renegade white blood cells. In
the process, however, life-sustaining
red blood cells are also destroyed.
Willis' doctor has told her that in
addition to the chemotherapy she is
currently receiving, Willis ultimately
must undergo a bone marrow trans
plant — replacing her body's own
faulty bone marrow with marrow that
produces non-cancerous blood cells —
or she will die within five years.
But cancer is not Willis' only
enemy Her race is too.
The odds for a successful bone mar
row transplant are increased when a
patient receives marrow from a donor
whose marrow possesses a similar
genetic structure and matches in six
key antigens, or proteins. Given the

unique genetic structure of bone mar
row cells in black people, doctors say
that Willis needs marrow from a per
son of her own ethnic group.
But black people, for a host of rea
sons, donate bone marrow as well as
blood and other organs in numbers
that are disproportionately lower than
the number of potential black donors
in the general population.
"If you are black and have leukemia
and need a bone marrow transplant, it
is practically a death sentence," said
Paulette Bryant, a Harvard-trained
hematologist at the Stanford Blood
Bank.
The statistics are telling. According
to the Minnesota-based National Mar
row Donor Program, the country's
largest registry network of its kind,
only 9,500 of 320,000 registered indi
viduals are black — 2.9 percent of the
registry.
Since 96 percent of people in the

registry are white, other people of
color besides blacks also have
small donor pools; the remaining
1.1 percent of registrants are Chi
cano, Asian-American and Native
American.
Officials at the donor program
estimate that Willis has only a one
in 20,000 chance of finding a
match. In the past 12 years only
five blacks have located compati
ble donors. One doctor described
Willis' chances as being up to "the
luck of the draw."
"Now that there is a medical
cure for leukemia in the form of
marrow transplants, we can't
offer the cure to many people of
certain ethnic groups," said Liz
Qualm, a spokesperson for the
Minnesota bone marrow registry,
which has no formal targeting
programs for people of color. "It is
pretty bleak."
The situation has gotten
bleaker for Willis. Three weeks
ago she learned the cancer had
migrated to her leg, causing it to
bloat painfully.
"I just don't know how much
time I have," Willis said in a voice
unlike the barrister's bass she has
wielded against opposing counsel
for more than a decade.
Despite the lack of donors and
waning time, Willis harbors hope.
A group of Stanford students,
administrators, black undergrad
uates and alumni, and local com
munity and church groups have
banded together to give Willis
another reason to be hopeful.
The group is part of the African
American Donor Task Force, an
East Palo Alto-based organization
that aims to increase the pool of
potential black bone-marrow

donors.
"I realized that I had to do
something about the lack of
blacks giving blood and getting
tissue-typed," said La Doris
Cordell, a task force founder and a
judge of the Superior Court of
Santa Clara County.
Cordell's involvement with
Willis is more than a story of a
concerned community member
extending a Samaritan hand to a
sick person. It is the story of
Cordell, a former dean of Student
Affairs at the Law School, coming
to the aid of her former student.
"She was such a good student
and nice person," Cordell recalled.
"I just could not sit back and not
do anything."
Cordell, along with other task
force members, contacted Stan
ford physicians — including
Bryant — and student groups to
focus the group's efforts on Willis,
as well as the low number of black
donors.
"I was so sick and tired of
responding to crises to no avail,"
Cordell said. "I wanted an answer
to the question of why there were
not more blacks in the registry."
Some answers came from a
survey the group conducted
among 1,500 people in East Palo
Alto. The task force found black
people were reluctant to donate
for reasons of cost, fear of the
medical establishment and a con
cern that donating marrow was
dangerous and painful.
The survey's most surprising
finding was a widespread reli
gious-based worry among black
Christians that donating would
prevent the body from being
whole for resurrection in the
afterlife.
Cordell enlisted the help of
Asst. Dean of Memorial Church
Floyd Thompkins to temper the
religious fears of potential donors

in the community.
The task force has also sent
some 4,000 letters to students and
alumni encouraging them to get
tested and tissue-typed. Next
week, the task force is planning a
three-day phone-a-thon at the
Law School to answer questions
and provide information to poten
tial donors.
Prior efforts of the task force,
now one year old, have already
had an impact. Thompkins said
that the group has increased the
number of blacks in the national
marrow registry by 3 percent, or
80 people. But the goal is to
increase the numbers more, task
force members say.
"What we have gotten is a pro
cess that works — people do care,"
Bryant said.
"Sandra has made us push
faster. Unless we get more poten
tial donors we have not given her
the best hand to beat this dis
ease." Bryant added. "That's hard
to accept."
Task force organizers hope
their efforts create a long-range,
institutional model for the medi
cal community to examine the
issue of black donations.
The more immediate goal,
though, is saving Willis.
The ailing lawyer still bills
hours at her law firm when she is
not shuffling in and out of the
hospital or suffering from mor
phine depression and Interferon
induced chills that force Willis to
cocoon herself in multiple layers
of clothes and blankets.
In this most challenging time
of her life, Willis is trying to main
tain her self-control and attempt
ing to stay optimistic until a com
patible donor is found. "My fam
ily, my friends — they are worth
living for," she said. "I've just got
to keep pushing on."
