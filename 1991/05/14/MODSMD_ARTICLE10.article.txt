# Black Panther discusses movement

### Ly Tahira Boyd Staff writer 
Bobby Seale, co-founder of the
Black Panther Party, discussed
how Malcolm X influenced the ori
gins of the Black Panthers before
an audience of 350 in Annenberg
Auditorium last night as part of
the Black Student Union's Mal
colm X Week.
The Black Panthers were cre
ated as an alternative to the main
stream political parties which
would address black concerns,
Seale said. The party formulated a
10-point platform to improve the
conditions of African-Americans.
According to Seale, two state
ments of Malcolm X, "by any
means necessary" and"the bullet
or the ballot," profoundly influ
enced the philosophy of the Black
Panthers. The first slogan
referred to the socioeconomic
advancement of black people
through whatever methods
worked, while the second hinted
that if whites continued to deny
black people political power,
blacks might have to resort to

defensive action.
While some view these state
ments as controversial, Seale said
they were simply a logical form of
self-defense. The founders of the
Black Panthers "wanted an orga
nization that would be used to
empower black people and would
concentrate on patrolling the
police,"
During the civil rights move
ment, police brutality against
blacks was rampant and relations
between blacks and whites were
strained, Seale added.
Seale said the killing of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. provided
the impetus for thousands of
blacks across the nation to join
the Panthers "because they were
fed up with the system."
Seale also discussed Malcolm
X's effect on his own awareness of
race issues. "Before 1962,1 had no
politics and black people had no
history and no understanding of
ourselves," he said. "We were
brainwashed. I believed I was a
nigger."
But through extensive reading,

Seale said he "tried to understand
racism and economic exploita
tion." Eventually, he realized that
he was agreeing with Malcolm X
more and more.
"I was personified by Malcolm
X, after he left the Nation of
Islam," Seale said. "He redefined
the civil rights struggle in Amer
ica as a human rights struggle."
Seale addressed rumors about
the Black Panthers in his speech.
"J. Edgar Hoover tried to stereo
type us as being hoodlums and
thugs, bless his racist soul," he
said.
Many others were confused
about the aims of the party, Seale
added.
He concluded his speech the
way he began it, saying "We need
to do anything necessary to save
this earth. The greatest abuse to
humanity is destruction of the
environment. If the environment
is gone, humanity is gone, includ
ing all the brothers and sisters."
After concluding his speech,
Seale received a standing ovation
from the crowd.
