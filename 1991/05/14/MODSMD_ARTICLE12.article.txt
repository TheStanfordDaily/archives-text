Three nights of riots in Brussels
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — A police traffic
check in an immigrant neighborhood triggered
three nights of rioting that littered the streets
with broken window glass from cars, police
vans and shops yesterday.
About 20 people were reported injured, and
four rioters were arrested, a spokesman for the
prosecutor's office said.
The official said a car filled with Molotov
cocktails exploded Sunday night, seriously
burning its three passengers.
The violence started Friday night in the
city's Forest district when a police patrol
stopped a North African immigrant riding a
moped to check his license and the officers were
attacked by dozens of other immigrants, the
spokesman said.
Police reinforcements and riot units of the
Belgian State Police had to be called in to
restore order.
Russia begins colorful,
independent TV programming
MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian republic
launched its own television programming yes
terday, emblazoning the pre-revolutionary tri
color flag across the screen and poking fun at
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev even before it
was an hour old.
"Today is a special day, because today we
stopped the monopoly of the airwaves," Alexan
der Nekhorosho, an executive at Russian Tele
vision and Radio, told viewers.
Television has become a major battleground
in the Soviet Union. Reformers like Russian
leader Boris Yeltsin are harshly critical of how
the state-controlled Central Television has
been turned into a mouthpiece for the Kremlin.
Operating out of space leased from Central
Television, Russian Television initially will broad
cast about six hours a day, featuring two 15-
minute newscasts and independently produced
cultural, entertainment and political shows.

Thirty-three victims were crushed to death
under the limestone, Gomes said. Two more
died on the way to the hospital and 21 others
were hospitalized in serious condition.
