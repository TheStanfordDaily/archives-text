# Winnie Mandela guilty of kidnapping

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)
— Winnie Mandela, the wife of African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela,
was found guilty yesterday of kidnap and
accessory-to-assault charges following a
complex and politically charged trial.
Mrs. Mandela, 56, looked shocked when
the verdict was read. Her husband rushed
to embrace her, and the two made defiant
clenched-fist salutes to a cheering crowd as
they left the courthouse.
Mrs. Mandela and her two co-defendants
had proclaimed their innocence in the 1988
abduction and beating of four youths in the
black township of Soweto, but the judge, in
a scathing verdict, called Mrs. Mandela an
"unblushing liar."
The judge also found both of Mrs. Man
dela's co-defendants guilty of kidnapping,
and one was convicted of assault as well. In
South Africa, the verdict is decided by the
judge, not a jury.
The judge ordered the defendants to
appear in court Tuesday, when sentencing
was expected. They could face anything
from suspended sentences to lengthy jail
terms.
The three-month trial featured often
sordid testimony and bizarre twists that
included the disappearance of a key prose
cution witness.
The defendants had pleaded innocent
Feb. 11 to four counts of kidnap and four
counts of assault. Prosecutors allege they
abducted and beat the victims because of
allegations the young men had engaged in
homosexual activities or spied for police.
Monday's verdict is likely to add to the
growing political confrontation between the
ANC and the government. The ANC has
threatened to pull out of talks on the coun
try's future unless the government does
more to stop black faction fighting that has
claimed thousands of lives.
Many militant blacks, especially the
young, oppose any negotiated settlement
with the government. The militants, many
of whom believe the prosecution of Mrs.
Mandela was politically inspired, are likely
to be even less willing to back a compromise
now.

Mandela, 72, himself was in prison for
anti-government activity when the crimes
occurred. He has publicly stood by his wife
throughout the controversy. After the ver
dict, Mandela, who had sat grimly in court
throughout the day, went to his wife and
hugged and kissed her.
Mrs. Mandela, her voice quavering, told
reporters: "As long as you all know that I
did not assault any child, that is all that
matters."
A crowd of supporters yelling "Viva,
Viva!" greeted the Mandelas as they left the
courthouse arm-in-arm. They raised their
fists and smiled before driving away in a red
Mercedes.
In addition to the verdict against Mrs.
Mandela on the kidnapping charges, Jus
tice M.S. Stegir.ann found co-defendant
Xoliswa Falati, 36, guilty of four counts of
kidnap and four counts of assault. The
other defendant, John Morgan, 61, was
convicted of four kidnapping counts but
cleared of assault.
The judge contended that Mrs. Man
dela's power over the co-defendants — and
her failure to order the captives' release —
made her an accessory after the fact to the
assaults. However, that was a reduction of
the more serious charge of assault against
her.
In a 6 1/2-hour reading of his verdict, the
judge delivered stinging attacks on Mrs.
Falati and Mrs. Mandela, saying they con
spired to abduct four young men from a
Methodist Church home on Dec. 29, 1988,
and beat them in Mrs. Mandela's Soweto
home.
Referring to Mrs. Mandela's trial testi
mony, he said: "She showed herself on a
number of occasions to be a calm, com
posed, deliberate and unblushing liar."
One of the victims, Stompie Seipei, was
killed after the assaults. Mrs. Mandela's
former bodyguard, Jerry Richardson, was
convicted last year in his death.
The trial opened Feb. 4 but adjourned
almost immediately after the disappearance
of Gabriel Mekgwe, one of the four young
men, who was to testify that Mrs. Mandela
whipped him.
