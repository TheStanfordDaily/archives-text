# World faces population crisis

LONDON (AP) — The world's popula
tion is growing faster than predicted,
increasing the pressures on the natural
resources needed for global survival, a U.N.
report said today.
The population is expected to reach 5.4
billion by mid-1991 and then rise to about
10.2 billion perhaps as soon as 2050 —
about 25 years earlier than previous projec
tions, the report said.
About 95 percent of the increase is com
ing in the poorer, developing nations least
able to cope, said the report, "The State of
the World Population 1991."
The populations of North America and
Europe will increase little through births,
but the industrial nations could face
increasing pressures from immigrants flee
ing poverty and environmental problems,
the report said.
Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the
United Nations Population Fund, told
reporters that to stabilize world population
at 10.2 billion by 2075, fertility would have
to be lowered from the current 3.8 births
per woman to 3.3 births.
To do this, the number of couples prac
ticing contraception in the developing
world must increase by 50 percent, from
381 million in 1990 to 567 million by 2000,
she said.
"We can already see the warning signs of
missing our targets," she said. "These signs
represent trends that if not checked por
tend an ominous future."
Increasing human demands are damag
ing the natural resources that underpin
economic development and human sur
vival, the report said. Slower population

growth and more even distribution of peo
ple would help relieve the pressure on land,
energy resources, watersheds and forests, it
said.
The report said the largest relative pop
ulation increase is taking place in Africa,
rising from its current 650 million people to
900 million by the end of the century.
The population of Latin America and the
Caribbean is expected to increase by 100
million by the turn of the century to 540
million.
Meanwhile, North American and Euro
pean countries, with the exception of Alba
nia, have growth rates of less than 1 per
cent.
But migratory pressures will increase as
the Third World population rises, the
report said. The number of migrants fleeing
poverty, political oppression or environ
mental instability already is growing while
the need for unskilled and semiskilled
workers is falling in the industrial nations.
The report said there are some positive
signs for slowing birth rates.
"Compared with any previous genera
tion, more women are saying they want
fewer children. Although actual fertility is
much higher than desired fertility in many
countries, it is now falling in all regions of
the developing world," it said.
The voluntary use of contraception in
developing countries has grown from 10
percent of couples in the 1960s to 51 per
cent today, the report said. If women who
did not want to become pregnant could
exercise that choice, the rate of population
growth in the Third World would fall by
about 30 percent.
