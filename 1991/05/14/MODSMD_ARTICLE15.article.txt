PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia
(AP) â€” Russian republic leader
Boris Yeltsin met President
Vaclav Havel yesterday and
condemned the 1968 invasion
of Czechoslovakia as a huge
mistake.
The leader of the Soviet
Union's largest republic called
the Moscow-led invasion that
crushed Czechoslovakia's
reform-minded government
typical of the totalitarian Com
munist system.
"Together, we will now rid
ourselves of this totalitarian
ism," Yeltsin said upon arriving
on his first foray to forge rela
tions with a democratic East
ern Europe.
Yeltsin warmly greeted his
host, Alexander Dubcek, who
had led the government over
thrown by the Warsaw Pact
forces in 1968, and laid a
wreath at a memorial for vic
tims of communism.
In a sign of the new spirit of
reconciliation, figures from the
"Prague Spring" of 1968 lined
up to greet Yeltsin at a crowded
Soviet Embassy reception.
Among them were Jiri Hajek,
Dubcek's foreign minister.
Yeltsin held an hour of talks
with former dissident Havel,

outlining the April 23 agree
ment with his rival, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev, on reshaping the Soviet
Union.
Gorbachev, by contrast, has
not visited Eastern Europe
since the democratic revolu
tions of late 1989. He canceled
a meeting with Havel at the 35-
nation Paris summit last year
after the Czechoslovak leader
spoke out in favor of indepen
dence for the Baltic republics.
Yeltsin and Havel also
sketched plans to boost eco
nomic ties by setting up what
Havel's spokesman, Michael
Zantovsky, called a "Russia
House" in Prague to clear
barter trade and other deals.
The Czechoslovaks, who
ousted their Communist gov
ernment in late 1989, stand to
gain enhanced economic ties
with a man who has just won
control of Russia's valuable
coal mines and may soon have
a hold over its oil and natural
gas.
On Tuesday, Yeltsin is to
address deputies in Parlia
ment, of which Dubcek is
chairman, before leaving for
the eastern republic of Slo
vakia.
