ZAKHO, Iraq (AP) - The
United Nations formally took con
trol Monday of the first United
States-run Kurdish refugee camp
in northern Iraq. British and Iraqi
soldiers exchanged gunfire at a
summer palace of Saddam Hus
sein's.
No Britons were hurt and there
were no known Iraqi casualties
from the shootout near Sensenk, a
town 40 miles east of Zakho.
In other developments, the
allied commander of relief and
resettlement operations for the
Kurds said he did not plan to
expand to the provincial capital of
Dohuk a "safe haven" zone
intended to protect the refugees.
That expansion is "not some
thing we're working or planning
for," Army Lt. Gen. John Sha
likashvili said, standing in a U.S.-
run refugee camp outside Zakho.
"We don't want a Gaza Strip
here."
Kurdish leaders have
demanded the allies occupy the
strategic city, home to 350,000
before the failed Kurdish upris
ing. They comdemned a U.N. ship
ment Monday of 16 tons of food
from Zakho to Dohuk as a "bribe."
"The U.N. is sick if they think a
convoy of food can bribe us to
return home," said Hussain Sin
jari, a top official in the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan.

In Zakho, several hundred
Kurds demonstrated raucously
against Saddam Hussein and
attacked at least one suspected
Saddam loyalist before U.S. mili
tary police intervened.
Shalikashvili said the allied
operation to rescue refugees from
the miserable mountain camps —
by providing food, water,
medicine, protection and trans
portation home — was going bet
ter than expected.
The Army says more than
200,000 Kurds have descended
from their squalid mountain hide
aways where they fied Saddam's
crackdown on their rebellion in
March. Another 250,000 remain
in the hills.
Shalikashvili came to Iraq to
participate in a U.N. flag-raising
ceremony, celebrating the transfer
of administrative control of the
first U.S.-run refugee camp to the
U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
The takeover brings American
forces participating in the human
itarian operation to save the
Kurds a step closer to home.
The shootout at a summer villa
of Saddam's involved a British
patrol and several Iraqi soldiers
inside the palace complex, which
is surrounded by 12-foot walls.
The shootout was reported by
the British Defense Ministrv and

confirmed by the British Embassy
in Ankara, Turkey.
The first Iraqi gunfire at the
Royal Marines patrol took place at
about 10:30 a.m. local time, when
three rounds were fired from the
complex in front of a patrol, said
James Gee, a spokesman for the
British Defense Ministry at Silopi,
Turkey.
At 1:13 p.m, one round was
fired at the standing patrol from
the same area, and it was
answered by one round, Gee said.
At 1:20 p.m., two men emerged
from a block house on the palace
wall and began to fire long bursts
of automatic fire at the patrol.
Fire was returned and the two
men dropped from sight, he said.
Shortly afterward, two more
shots were fired at the patrol. No
further fire was returned, Gee
said.
Under an agreement with the
allies, a small number of Sad
dam's troops were permitted to
stay to guard the palaces and vil
las Saddam built in the mountain
valley.
The allies plan to complain to
the Iraqi military over the inci
dent, said British army Maj.
Andrew Venus. "It seems to have
happened out of the blue. It is a
serious incident."
