Senate, Bush need to
follow House, accept
Brady gun limitation

Last Wednesday, the
House finally approved the
Brady bill, a measure which
would institute a federally man
dated seven-day waiting period for
anyone buying a handgun. The bill
now faces a close vote in the Senate
and an even more uncertain fate at
the hands of President Bush. The
bill is not — nor do its supporters
claim it to be — a comprehensive
solution to this country's stagger
ing crime problem, but it is an
important first step toward curb
ing the most blatant violations of
existing gun control law.
Many states currently require
some form of waiting period for
handgun purchases in order to run
a background check on the buyer.
The delay gives authorities time to
check for past felonies, drug addic
tion, or mental illness in the his
tory of the buyer, any of which
would make the sale illegal under
current laws. But the state-man
dated waiting periods are not
nearly as effective as they could be,
since a criminal can easily drive
into a state with lenient or non
existent gun control laws and pur
chase a gun there. The need for a
united federal policy in this case is
clear.
Opponents of the Brady bill
have many objections, all of them
trivial. Most common is the claim
that the Brady bill violates the Sec
ond Amendment of the Constitu
tion, which gives every citizen the
right to bear arms. But like any
other freedom, this right must be
subject to reasonable restrictions.
A seven-day delay between the
decision to purchase a handgun
and receiving the handgun is

hardly an unreasonable restric
tion, especially given the current
frequency of handgun abuse.
A second objection, also on Con
stitutional grounds, is that the
national government should avoid
infringing on state's rights as
much as possible, in accordance
with the principle of federalism.
Yet there are numerous precedents
for such "infringement": By
threatening to withhold funding,
the federal government has man
dated such things as a national
speed limit and a national drinking
age. Surely, if exceptions can be
made in these cases, there is an
even stronger practical incentive to
coordinate gun control policy.
Opponents of the Brady bill also
maintain that it would be ineffec
tive, and they offered their own bill
that would mandate an instant
computer check of any potential
buyer's criminal record. But, by
the Justice Department's own cal
culation, setting up the required
database and infrastructure for
such a procedure would cost mil
lions and take years to complete.
True, a waiting period will not
halt all illegal handgun sales. But it
will severely reduce the amount of
interstate gun-running and will
bar many criminals from being
able to buy guns.
And, hopefully, a few of the bill's
technical problems will be solved
by the Senate. For example, under
current provisions, the chief local
law enforcement officer could con
ceivably delay sale of a gun to a
legitimate buyer beyond the neces
sary seven days by not acknowledg
ing receipt of the buyer's purchase
application.
But such abuses are extremely
unlikely. The need for the Brady
bill is great, and the sacrifice which
it forces upon law-abiding citizens
is insignificant. This legislation
deserves to be speedily enacted into
law.
