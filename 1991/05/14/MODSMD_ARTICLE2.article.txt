# Educator's focus is men and rape
## 
### Eleni Kirkas Staff writer 
Joe Weinberg, a soft-spoken man with long, curly
black hair and five earrings, is sometimes called a
"rape expert."
Though Weinberg himself cringes at the term
with its dubious connotations of being skilled at
rape, it has often been applied to him because of
what he does.
As a member of Men Stopping Rape, Weinberg
makes it his business to travel the country educating
people — primarily men — about sexual assault and
how to stop it.
Sponsored by the Rape Education Project, Wein
berg is currently at Stanford to present workshops to
several fraternities and residences. He also plans to
meet with administrators to discuss sexual assault

prevention and education on campus.
This is the third time the project has brought
Weinberg to campus. "We thought he would be an
effective way to reach out to men on campus," said
senior Michelle Finkel, a project member.
Last night, Weinberg conducted workshops for
the Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Alpha fraternities.
Today he is scheduled to speak to the Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternity.
Theta Delt Resident Assistant Samer Hamadeh, a
senior, said the program was effective because Wein
berg made the men comfortable with the discussion
while challenging many of their attitudes.
"It just allowed people to really express what they
thought," he said.
Weinberg's programs discuss numerous issues
surrounding rape, including
myths about sexual assault, how
language and advertising con
tribute to the "rape culture" and
especially communication and
consent between men and
women.
Weinberg says, however, his
main purpose is to emphasize
that sexual assault touches every
one.
"I am looking for men to see
how rape hurts them as well as
honor how it hurts women,"
Weinberg says.
Most men, he says, probably
know someone who is a survivor,
and many are themselves sur
vivors of sexual assault.
Weinberg usually begins the
workshops by asking the men
how they know when a woman
wants to be kissed. The usual
answer, he says, is body language.
But, Weinberg continues, how
do men know if a woman wants
more than just a kiss? More
importantly, how do they know
when she doesn't?

'I am looking for men to see how rape
hurts them as well as honor how it hurts
women.'

Problems of sexual assault and
coercion arise, Weinberg says,
because consent is frequently not
an issue in many interactions
between men and women. There
is a common misperception that
often "her mouth says 'no,' but
her eyes say 'yes,"' he explains.
Because the issue of consent is
so clouded, Weinberg says, many
men are unaware that some of
their actions are considered rape.
"That does not exonerate them,
but in terms of education, it is
critical," he continues.
Weinberg also raises the issue
of how sex and relationships are
treated in everyday language.
For instance, the common
question "Did you get some?"
implies that sex is a commodity
that the woman guards and the
man must somehow obtain.
Other phrases promote the
notion of sex as something a man
does to a woman, as opposed to an

act of mutual consent, Weinberg
says.
Such language helps create a
culture that condones rape and
discourages effective communica
tion between men and women, he
adds.
In conjunction with his discus
sion of language, Weinberg also
shows his audience an assortment
of about 70 magazine ads and
record covers which he feels help
illustrate the pervasive attitude
in society that sexual violence is
acceptable.
Through this open forum for
discussion, Weinberg says he
strives to get men to think seri
ously about complex issues and
challenges many assumptions
about sexual assault. By getting
men together to talk about their
feelings, a first step can be taken
toward changing the attitudes
that can lead to sexual assault,
Weinberg says.
