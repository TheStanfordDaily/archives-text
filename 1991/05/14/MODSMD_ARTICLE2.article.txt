# Educator's focus is men and rape

Joe Weinberg, a soft-spoken man with long, curly
black hair and five earrings, is sometimes called a
"rape expert."
Though Weinberg himself cringes at the term
with its dubious connotations of being skilled at
rape, it has often been applied to him because of
what he does.
As a member of Men Stopping Rape, Weinberg
makes it his business to travel the country educating
people — primarily men — about sexual assault and
how to stop it.
Sponsored by the Rape Education Project, Wein
berg is currently at Stanford to present workshops to
several fraternities and residences. He also plans to
meet with administrators to discuss sexual assault

prevention and education on campus.
This is the third time the project has brought
Weinberg to campus. "We thought he would be an
effective way to reach out to men on campus," said
senior Michelle Finkel, a project member.
Last night, Weinberg conducted workshops for
the Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Alpha fraternities.
Today he is scheduled to speak to the Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternity.
Theta Delt Resident Assistant Samer Hamadeh, a
senior, said the program was effective because Wein
berg made the men comfortable with the discussion
while challenging many of their attitudes.
"It just allowed people to really express what they
thought," he said.
Weinberg's programs discuss numerous issues
