### 
University should not create own legal guidelines

ONCE AGAIN, THE UNIVERSITY
has shown its true colors. The
administration's response to the
Alpha Epsilon Pi housing request is
another example of the University's
belief that it is outside the realm of legal
responsibility. Commenting on a legal
opinion obtained by AEPi regarding Uni
versity housing policy, Nancy Howe,
Director of the Office of Student Affairs,
said: "The issue is not a legal question.
The University, not the law, ultimately
determines which fraternities have
which housing."
The move envisioned by AEPi is
clearly within the specifications of the
University housing policy, the guidelines

of which do not prohibit a student from
pledging more than one fraternity. Aban
doning its own policy, the University has
proceeded to enact a retroactive regula
tion to fill in its self-created loophole.
The University's decision to make a rule
ex post facto shows a complete disregard
for the due process rights of the students
involved.
The University's handling of the Stu
art Reges incident was similarly muddled
by the administration's belief that its
policies were not required to mesh with
congressional law. Though aware of its
responsibilities under the Alcohol and
Controlled Substance Abuse Act passed
by Congress last year, the administration

chose to buck the system, as if the Ivory
Tower were outside the jurisdiction of
the federal government. It took a threat
by the government to cut off Stanford's
federal funding before the University
conceded to the legal requirements.
Speaking of federal funding, Stan
ford's treatment of the indirect cost
scandal also highlighted the University's
disrespect for the legal institution. While
the administration claims to have been
operating within the federal guidelines,
there is no question that expenditures
were made for puchases wholly unre
lated to research. Despite having been
publicly humiliated, Kennedy continues
to assert the legality of Stanford's

frivolous expenditures.
As an educational institution, Stan
ford claims to offer its students the nec
essary tools to function in society. While
classroom experience tends toward this
direction, the University's continued
rebuking of the country's legal institu
tions is hypocritical. How can the admin
stration expect to command respect from
its students when it has no respect for
the legitimacy of the American legal sys
tem? Education starts at home, and the
University is failing miserably!
