# Budget cuts unfair, especially for young professors and staff
## 
### 
I am compelled to write, from an
accustomed position on the sidelines, to
support the opinions expressed recently
and independently by English Profs.
Bliss Carnochan and Ronald Rebholtz
concerning the undesirable material and
psychological impact of severe budget
cuts on faculty and staff, particularly
those at an early stage of their careers
who are less able to weather the conse
quences.
There is no justification whatsoever
for penalizing salaried members of the
University unconnected with the poor
governance that has brought about the
present difficult situation. An appear
ance of piecemeal reaction is conveyed by
the administration which has yet to jus
tify, in its repositioning, the cost effec
tiveness of a large legal staff that pro
vides numerous spokespersons for the
unwelcome news items of recent date.

And it is dismaying, indeed, to be
reminded about newly incurred expenses
for "paying the lawyers, media consul
tants, accountants and temporary help
the University has hired. ..."
Many members of the University
have, over the years, accomplished much
distinction in teaching and research. But
the guidance and support of administra
tors has not matched the level of such
accomplishments. The words from the
latter often outdistance their actions,
and the reshaping of an educational
institution along corporate lines does not
merit thanks. A new practice and
resolve is called for and will, hopefully,
be forthcoming.
