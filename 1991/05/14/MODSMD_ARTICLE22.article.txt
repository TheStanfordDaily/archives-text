# Daily article excludes coed frat; Alpha Delts upset by omission
## 
### 
I am writing to express my disappoint
ment in the fact that a recent Daily arti

cle on Rush did not include the figures
for Alpha Delta Phi, my fraternity. In
the Daily's defense, we did not call direct
ly with our information. However, we
would have gladly done so had we known
that there was a need. (If I remember
correctly, last year's article only included
totals from housed fraternities.)
We are members of the Interfraternity
Council like the other organizations
mentioned in the article, and participat
ed in Rush to the same degree as these
groups. I do not know how the informa
tion was obtained from the other frater
nities, but it should not have been diffi
cult for a reporter to contact us. Our
telephone number was in the Rush book
published by the IFC, and any IFC offi
cer could have put you in touch with us.
I would imagine, though, that the
information was gathered through the
IFC. In that case, it is unfortunate that
our results were not communicted in this
manner. At some point, IFC President
Erik Jorgensen was notified of our Rush
results by our president, Jody Berkes,
though it is conceivable that there was a
timing problem.

Perhaps the problem lies in the graph
ics used for the chart that displayed
Rush results. Maybe there was no little
girl to put next to the little boys that rep
resented the other fraternities. (I knew
going coed would cause a problem sooner
or later.) For the record, we too wanted a
little boy with a goofy hat and his hands
wedged firmly in his pockets doing who
knows what. A smiling little girl would
be nice as well.
Finally, for those who are interested,
Alpha Delta Phi at Stanford has 30 sweet
neophytes.il of whom are women. The
reader will note that this total would
have given us a very tall little boy,
indeed.
