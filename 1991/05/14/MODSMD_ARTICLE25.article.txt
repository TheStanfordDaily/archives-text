## Democracy in America 
### 
A PROMINENT DUTCH newspaper
last year opened its pages to a
debate on whether the Netherlands
is becoming a one-party state. To most,
the outcome might seem to be a foregone
conclusion — after all, more than 10 par
ties are regularly represented in the
Dutch parliament.
However, the contributors looked
beyond the obvious political diversity, and
worried that parliamentarians appear to
be culled from a limited demographic
group, and once they arrive in the Hague,
are often in closer touch with their party
officials than with those who elected
them. Similar concerns about the U.S.
political system are just as valid.
One of the admirable qualities of the
American system is that politicians regu
larly go home to defend their choices in
i mien constituents. Unfortu
nately, this may well be the only advan
tage of the U.S. system over most Euro
pean democracies, however privileged
many Americans consider their own sys
tem to be.
Voter turnout for U.S. elections is
probably among the lowest of all world
democracies, reflecting a dangerous apa
thy on the part of the electorate. More
over, apart from a few well-turned
phrases around election time, main
stream politicians expend little effort to
remedy the problem. Perhaps they fear,
with some justification, that current non
voters might not altogether applaud the
legislature's record.
Actually, those mainstream politicians
are a remarkably select group. Most are
independently wealthy; it seems nearly

impossible today to get elected without
spending millions. They also look forward
to a life-long career in Congress. The frac
tion of incumbents re-elected again and
again is alarmingly high. Even if repre
sentatives occasionally must justify their
actions at home, how well do they still
understand their constituents' concerns
after 20 years in Congress?
I cannot believe that for several
decades no party can find a challenger
more qualified to represent the people
than the incumbent. Yet most incum
bents have no trouble recapturing their
party's endorsement and, campaigning
from office, leave the voters with pre
ciously little real choice.
The ruling two-party system only
aggravates the problem. With just two
candidates in most races, people often
vote against one candidate as opposed to
voting for another. Many campaign ads
reflect this, dedicating more time to the
claimed faults of the opponent than to the
acts (let alone the ideas) of their own can
didate. Even the campaigning in last
month's ASSU elections repeatedly sank
to this level.
One of the worst aspects of a system of
district-based representation is that, the
oretically, a party earning 49% percent of
all votes nationwide might not win a sin
gle victory. Only large, well-established
parties can thrive under such rules. As a
result, the two distressingly similar par
ties which dominate Congress can safely
ignore many issues inconvenient to both
of them.
For example, if all people who want
stronger environmental legislation lived

in a single town, they could easily elect a
representative to raise their concerns in
Washington. Unfortunately, they are
spread out, and in any single district the
representative often has little time for the
concerns of a few "environmental radi
cals."
Last year's election of Socialist
Bernard Sanders was the best thing to
happen to the House in a long time. While
he cannot pass any new laws by himself,
his mere presence makes it more difficult
for Congress to push aside issues and
ideas that have not had a fair hearing for
years.
I have been told that as a foreigner I
should not criticize the U.S. political sys
tem. However, I pay taxes too (it's called
taxation without representation), and it
seems to me that far too few Americans
are concerned with their current system
of government.
Despite its obvious (and much
vaunted) qualities, it has many flaws.
Debating them amongst ourselves will, if
nothing else, at least contribute to a
greater awareness of the obstacles to real
democracy in America.

Maurits van der Veen believes democracy
means that no voice will be ignored or
silenced permanently, but doubts the cur
rent administration feels the same way.
