## Julie Cantor Living with a cancer death: 'Zachy, we are going to miss Daddy' 
### 
ICY FEET BRUSHED UP AGAINST
my legs. It was 6:30 a.m. I guess he
was glad to see me. After all, it had
been awhile.
I had come home from Stanford for
the weekend to see how Dad was doing,
and my 8-year-old crazy kid brother
came in to wake me up. He missed me.
They say he idolizes me; it's great for the
ego. Zachary. Zachy-Wacky. The Zach
meister.
His early wake-up call had startled
me, but how could I have been upset?
The child is too damn cute. I just looked
at him — those blond curls resting deli
cately on my pillow, those eyes that said,
"I'm still tired," those revealing marks
on wrinkled skin of deep sleep. I didn't
speak. How did he feel? Maybe he'd talk
to me.
"Julie," he whined.
"Yes, Wack-a-doo."
"What if Daddy dies?"
God. Whatever I say is going to seri
ously affect this vulnerable child. I didn't
know what to do.
Maybe we should not have told little
Zach that his Daddy, his pal, was "very,
very sick." Maybe, when Wacky first
asked if his Daddy was going to die, we
should have laughed hysterically and
reassured him, "Of course not, sweetie."
But we didn't.
When we took Zach to the hospital we
had told him what to expect: a mon
strous octopus of plastic tubes and col
ored wires entangling dad, supposedly
helping — who knows. The myriad of
machines. Beeps and buzzes. The uneasy
aura of "intensive care."
The child was not too traumatized. He
just looked at his father in the sterile
bed. He looked, wrinkled his brow, curled
his mouth and asked for cookies and
milk. Kids. Zach sat there next to an

unconscious father, inhaled his snack
and started to watch TV
"Why won't Daddy open his eyes?
What are those things on his legs?"
My mother explained carefully that
Daddy had a blood clot in his brain.
Another complication of cranial surgery.
("Sorry, but we don't know why these
things happen." Thanks, doc.) Some
thing was making Daddy sleep.
He could still squeeze our hands,
though. Not in a coma yet. Not yet. This
was only week number two since
"Surgery Sunday." And those inflating
wrappers on Dad's legs? Well, Zach,
that's so he doesn't get a blood clot in his
leg, Mom explained.
He cocked his head. "Well, why don't
they just put those on his head?"
Smart boy. Too bad it doesn't work
like that.
The week before, the first week after
Surgery Sunday, when Zachary came to
say "hi" to Dad, things were not as grim.
Dad had only (only?) lost his short-term
memory because of the tumors.
Old Pops (well, he was just 43) had
just talked to his "Zoo-Zoo." That's what
Dad called him. But when Zach left the
room, and I was alone with the shadow
of what was once a whole, complete man,
Daddy said, "When's my boy coming?"
Mr. Short-Term Memory. God, that hurt
me.
So Zach watched the progression, (or
is it digression?), of events. lie overheard
our frantic explanations on the phone.
"It's the most fatal, most rapid brain
cancer. Glioblastoma Meningioma. I
know. We can't believe it either. We're
sorry too."
He knew. He knew. Now, he needed
security. What happens if Daddy dies?
Since it always takes me awhile to get
moving in the morning, I answered my

Dad's Zoo-Zoo as well as I could. What
do you say? "Gee, Zach, looks like you're
going to grow up without that Dad you
were promised. Nope. Sorry, Zach. No
more hikes, jogs, games, piano-practices,
math problems, bed-time stories, smiles
— with Dad. We'll be alone and we'll. ..."
No.
1 didn't say that, although I was and
still am mad as hell that my father was
abruptly stripped of life. WTiy?
Instead, I draped my arm over his
bony body. I looked into his pleading
eyes, and the sun began to rise.
"Zachy. We are going to miss Daddy.
We love him so much and it's very sad.
We will be very sad. But we will be OK.
Daddy has taken good care of us because
he loves us very much. It's going to be
very hard. It's OK to be sad."
The birds started to sing, and I held
that hurting boy.
I held him close as he cried.
Life changes too quickly.
Last year at this time, I knew
where I was going to college, and I
was thrilled. Everything was under con
trol.
Today is the one-month anniversary
of my father's death, April 14. 1 really
cannot talk about him here; he was too
important and amazing and healthy.
Maybe another time 1 will find the
words, but how can I describe my
Daddy?
I never thought something so painful
could happen to me and my family. It
was so sudden. No warnings or explana
tions. Pain and hurt often remain unno
ticed. Something you glance over in the
newspapers. Somehow, most people
think they are immune. I did.
Just when you think everything is
fine, WHAM! — reality hits. And it hits

hard.
I did not write this story to make peo
ple sad, but rather I wrote it to make
people think. To make me think. To
appreciate each year, each day, each
moment. I've thought about things. I
still do, and I still will. I think I have
learned. Enjoy each day because tomor
row's too uncertain. Prepare for the next
phase of the game because it may come,
but don't forget to laugh, to learn, to
look, to love.
As a little girl I held my hands up to
my Daddy's to see whose were bigger. I

grew and learned and internalized my
Daddy until my hands were as big as his
And one day I discovered that they
looked exactly the same. Oh, I had
always held those hands so tightly
because they were my dad's — because
he was my dad.
Until one day, I had to let them go.
Because the time actually came,
although much too soon, when those
hands just couldn't be with me anymore
And I miss them, and I miss him.

Today is the one-month anniversary
of my father's death, April 14. 1 really
cannot talk about him here; he was too
important and amazing and healthy.
Maybe another time 1 will find the
words, but how can I describe my
Daddy?
I never thought something so painful
could happen to me and my family. It
was so sudden. No warnings or explana
tions. Pain and hurt often remain unno
ticed. Something you glance over in the
newspapers. Somehow, most people
think they are immune. I did.
Just when you think everything is
fine, WHAM! — reality hits. And it hits

hard.
I did not write this story to make peo
ple sad, but rather I wrote it to make
people think. To make me think. To
appreciate each year, each day, each
moment. I've thought about things. I
still do, and I still will. I think I have
learned. Enjoy each day because tomor
row's too uncertain. Prepare for the next
phase of the game because it may come,
but don't forget to laugh, to learn, to
look, to love.
As a little girl I held my hands up to
my Daddy's to see whose were bigger. I

grew and learned and internalized my
Daddy until my hands were as big as his
And one day I discovered that they
looked exactly the same. Oh, I had
always held those hands so tightly
because they were my dad's — because
he was my dad.
Until one day, I had to let them go.
Because the time actually came,
although much too soon, when those
hands just couldn't be with me anymore
And I miss them, and I miss him.

ICY FEET BRUSHED UP AGAINST
my legs. It was 6:30 a.m. I guess he
was glad to see me. After all, it had
been awhile.
I had come home from Stanford for
the weekend to see how Dad was doing,
and my 8-year-old crazy kid brother
came in to wake me up. He missed me.
They say he idolizes me; it's great for the
ego. Zachary. Zachy-Wacky. The Zach
meister.
His early wake-up call had startled
me, but how could I have been upset?
The child is too damn cute. I just looked
at him — those blond curls resting deli
cately on my pillow, those eyes that said,
"I'm still tired," those revealing marks
on wrinkled skin of deep sleep. I didn't
speak. How did he feel? Maybe he'd talk
to me.
"Julie," he whined.
"Yes, Wack-a-doo."
"What if Daddy dies?"
God. Whatever I say is going to seri
ously affect this vulnerable child. I didn't
know what to do.
Maybe we should not have told little
Zach that his Daddy, his pal, was "very,
very sick." Maybe, when Wacky first
asked if his Daddy was going to die, we
should have laughed hysterically and
reassured him, "Of course not, sweetie."
But we didn't.
When we took Zach to the hospital we
had told him what to expect: a mon
strous octopus of plastic tubes and col
ored wires entangling dad, supposedly
helping — who knows. The myriad of
machines. Beeps and buzzes. The uneasy
aura of "intensive care."
The child was not too traumatized. He
just looked at his father in the sterile
bed. He looked, wrinkled his brow, curled
his mouth and asked for cookies and
milk. Kids. Zach sat there next to an

unconscious father, inhaled his snack
and started to watch TV
"Why won't Daddy open his eyes?
What are those things on his legs?"
My mother explained carefully that
Daddy had a blood clot in his brain.
Another complication of cranial surgery.
("Sorry, but we don't know why these
things happen." Thanks, doc.) Some
thing was making Daddy sleep.
He could still squeeze our hands,
though. Not in a coma yet. Not yet. This
was only week number two since
"Surgery Sunday." And those inflating
wrappers on Dad's legs? Well, Zach,
that's so he doesn't get a blood clot in his
leg, Mom explained.
He cocked his head. "Well, why don't
they just put those on his head?"
Smart boy. Too bad it doesn't work
like that.
The week before, the first week after
Surgery Sunday, when Zachary came to
say "hi" to Dad, things were not as grim.
Dad had only (only?) lost his short-term
memory because of the tumors.
Old Pops (well, he was just 43) had
just talked to his "Zoo-Zoo." That's what
Dad called him. But when Zach left the
room, and I was alone with the shadow
of what was once a whole, complete man,
Daddy said, "When's my boy coming?"
Mr. Short-Term Memory. God, that hurt
me.
So Zach watched the progression, (or
is it digression?), of events. lie overheard
our frantic explanations on the phone.
"It's the most fatal, most rapid brain
cancer. Glioblastoma Meningioma. I
know. We can't believe it either. We're
sorry too."
He knew. He knew. Now, he needed
security. What happens if Daddy dies?
Since it always takes me awhile to get
moving in the morning, I answered my

Dad's Zoo-Zoo as well as I could. What
do you say? "Gee, Zach, looks like you're
going to grow up without that Dad you
were promised. Nope. Sorry, Zach. No
more hikes, jogs, games, piano-practices,
math problems, bed-time stories, smiles
— with Dad. We'll be alone and we'll. ..."
No.
1 didn't say that, although I was and
still am mad as hell that my father was
abruptly stripped of life. WTiy?
Instead, I draped my arm over his
bony body. I looked into his pleading
eyes, and the sun began to rise.
"Zachy. We are going to miss Daddy.
We love him so much and it's very sad.
We will be very sad. But we will be OK.
Daddy has taken good care of us because
he loves us very much. It's going to be
very hard. It's OK to be sad."
The birds started to sing, and I held
that hurting boy.
I held him close as he cried.
Life changes too quickly.
Last year at this time, I knew
where I was going to college, and I
was thrilled. Everything was under con
trol.
