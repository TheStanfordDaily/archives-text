# MEChA's programming to suffer
## 
### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
A number of programs that
relied on MEChA for funding will
suffer financially or be canceled
next year as a result of the loss of
its $33,000 special fee request in
the ASSU election, according to
several community members.
The annual Cinco de Mayo cel
ebrations, normally hosted by
Casa Zapata and funded largely by
MEChA, will probably not be held
next year, said Zapata Resident
Fellow Tony Burciaga. This year's
celebration drew 300 people.
El Centro Chicano has also
received funds from MEChA for a
number of annual events in the

past, and these "will really suffer"
next year, said Frances Morales,
the center's director.
She said the center will not be
able to hire a mariachi band to
play traditional music at La Gran
Posada next year, and will have
difficulty funding El Dfa de los
Muertos, the Chicano/Latino Hal
loween celebration. MEChA has
paid more than half the celebra
tion's costs in the past.
Burciaga added that Casa Zap
ata's annual Zoot Suit week, a
Chicano/Latino celebration in
winter quarter involving speakers
and films, and other programs will
probably be canceled next year.
He said that while MEChA is
itself political, many of the pro

grams it supports are not. These
programs should not be funded
through MEChA, he added, and
the Chicano/Latino community
should look for new ways to find
funding.
One posjible source of new
funding is the Latino Students
Association, said the group's
founder, Benny Sandoval, a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents
elect. The association was formed
in November and has about 115
members.
Sandoval said the association
has not yet discussed funding
more Latino programs, and such a
move would have to be made in
