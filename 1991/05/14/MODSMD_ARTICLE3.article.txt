# MEChA's programming to suffer
## 
### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
A number of programs that
relied on MEChA for funding will
suffer financially or be canceled
next year as a result of the loss of
its $33,000 special fee request in
the ASSU election, according to
several community members.
The annual Cinco de Mayo cel
ebrations, normally hosted by
Casa Zapata and funded largely by
MEChA, will probably not be held
next year, said Zapata Resident
Fellow Tony Burciaga. This year's
celebration drew 300 people.
El Centro Chicano has also
received funds from MEChA for a
number of annual events in the

past, and these "will really suffer"
next year, said Frances Morales,
the center's director.
She said the center will not be
able to hire a mariachi band to
play traditional music at La Gran
Posada next year, and will have
difficulty funding El Dfa de los
Muertos, the Chicano/Latino Hal
loween celebration. MEChA has
paid more than half the celebra
tion's costs in the past.
Burciaga added that Casa Zap
ata's annual Zoot Suit week, a
Chicano/Latino celebration in
winter quarter involving speakers
and films, and other programs will
probably be canceled next year.
He said that while MEChA is
itself political, many of the pro

grams it supports are not. These
programs should not be funded
through MEChA, he added, and
the Chicano/Latino community
should look for new ways to find
funding.
One posjible source of new
funding is the Latino Students
Association, said the group's
founder, Benny Sandoval, a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents
elect. The association was formed
in November and has about 115
members.
Sandoval said the association
has not yet discussed funding
more Latino programs, and such a
move would have to be made in
consultation with MEChA. For
next year, MEChA will probably
continue to be responsible for
most programs, she added.
MEChA co-chair Lorena Bar
ron, a senior, said MEChA missed
the deadline to apply for yearlong
funding from the ASSU program
board because the group expected
to win its special fee request. She

said MEChA will have to wait
until fall quarter and apply for
quarterly funding.
Barron said MEChA will not be
able to bring speakers like Cesar
Chavez to Stanford or fund events
such as Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford's spring show, El Concierto
de la Primavera.
She suggested that MEChA's
failure to win its special fee
request resulted primarily from a
lack of knowledge about what
MEChA is and where its money
goes, as well as problems related

to its political stance.
Burciaga said he hoped that
one result of the loss, which he
called "disastrous and sad," would
be a drawing together of the com
munity by holding monthly Chi
cano/Latino community meetings,
which existed several years ago.
"We're not going to say it is the
end," he said.
MEChA and El Centro Chicano
have not yet begun to seek fund
ing elsewhere, but will probably
look to outside corporations,
Morales and Barron said.
