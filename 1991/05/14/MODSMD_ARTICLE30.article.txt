## Four Card netters advance 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Though rain swept away much of the
action at the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships, Heather Willens still
managed to have her day in the sun.
The sophomore from Los Angeles
won two singles matches to move into
the final 16 and, in the process, earned
All-America honors for the first time.
"It feels great. It hasn't really sunk
in," said Willens of her achievement.
"Being on this team, not as big a deal is
made of it, [but making Ail-American]
was my goal this year."
Willens becomes the fifth Stanford
player to gain All-America status this
season. She joins Sandra Birch, Debbie
Graham and Teri Whitlinger — who
were recognized in singles and doubles
— and Laxmi Poruri, an All-American
in doubles only.
Play was slated to begin at 9 a.m. yes
terday, with two rounds of singles and
one round of doubles on the agenda. But
rains washed came down on the courts
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium and
West Campus Courts, forcing a post
ponement until around 2 p.m.
When things finally got underway,
Willens was ready to rock. Her first
round opponent was San Diego State's
Nicole Storto, an alternate who made it
into the draw when Clemson's Mimi
Burgos had to pull out due to injury.
Storto was no match for Willens. A
lightning-quick 6-1, 6-2 rout put the ris
ing Stanford star into the second round.
There Willens figures she'd meet Kim
berly Po of UCLA. Po was red hot in the
team competition, beating Florida's
Nicole Arendt and Birch.
Yesterday, though, the eighth-seeded
Po was unable to overcome Oklahoma
State's Caroline Delisle, falling by a 7-5,
7-5 score. With what she described as a
"huge break," avoiding Po, Willens
crushed Delisle 6-0, 6-4 and became one
of just six players to reach the third
round before play was suspended.
"I was really happy with my play,"
Willens said. "It was so hard to get moti
vated. I was on such a high last night."
Somehow, she overcame the emotion of
winning the team title and the awkward
feeling of playing her first match on the
West Campus Courts.
"I felt like I was just in the boonies
playing some high school tournament,"

she said. "But I kept my concentration."
And she kept playing superb tennis.
"I'm still not hitting my forehand as
aggressively as I should be, but I'm hit
ting my backhand probably the best I've
ever hit it."
Surprisingly, Willens said, "I don't
think I'm playing very well." But she
has gained valuable experience over this
year, which is now paying dividends.

"One thing I've really learned is that if
you can be mentally tough, you can beat
people 80 percent of the time."
She will need to muster everything
she's got, physically and mentally, today
In all probability, Willens will square off
with the Lady Gators' Andrea Farley,
who is hitting the ball with authority.
