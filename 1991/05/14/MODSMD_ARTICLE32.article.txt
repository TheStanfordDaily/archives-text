# Showers delay early rounds
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Mother Nature was her typical,
not-so-cooperative self yesterday
as the individual singles and dou
bles events began at the NCAA
Women's Tennis Championships.
Rains, early and often, post
poned the start of matches by five
hours and prevented completion
of both second-round singles and
first-round doubles. With the orig
inal schedule calling for two more
rounds of singles and another
doubles round today, players in
both draws figure to be particu
larly busy beginning at 8 o'clock
this morning.
While the NCAA tournament
committee had not yet decided
how to reschedule everything, one
thing is for sure: Players in singles
and doubles will be at a huge dis
advantage vis a vis those in just
one of the tournaments.
Two scheduling options will be
presented to the committee early
this morning (see box) to allow the

finals to take place Thursday
evening. As always, television is
responsible for making the rules.
Prime Network requires that the
championship matches not be
delayed since they will be broad

cast live.
Among the biggest losers due
to the weather are Sandra Birch,
Teri Whitlinger and Debbie Gra
ham. All three are seeded in both
events and didn't complete their
second round singles yesterday.
Graham, whose match with Cara
Abe was tied at 1-1 in the first set,
could play what amounts to four
entire matches.
While she is in great shape,
that promises to be a tremendous
physical test.
Day one of singles produced a
lot of rain, but only one major
upset: Kimberly Po's loss to Caro
line Delisle. Duke's Julie Exum
nearly lost to BYU's Jennifer
Holmes, the last alternate to

make the singles draw. Exum, the
seventh seed, prevailed in three
sets.
Among the players still alive
are four from Stanford — Birch,
Graham, Whitlinger and Willens,
and four from Florida — Jillian
Alexander, Holly Lloyd, Nicole
Arendt and Andrea Farley. UCLA
had five players in the draw — Po,
Stella Sampras, Iwalani McCalla,
Mamie Ceniza and Kirsten
Dreyer. Four lost yesterday while
Dreyer withdrew before her
match.
With the second round not yet
complete, the following preview of
today's round of 16 involves a
good deal of guesswork. With that
caveat in mind, here goes:
Graham will likely defeat Abe

and Sabo as she charges forward
in defense of the national crown
she won in 1990. Her theoretical
quarterfinal opponent might be
Ole Miss' Paloma Collantes, who
is playing exceptional tennis, or
USC's Trisha "Bam Bam" Laux.
If Whitlinger survives Melissa
Mazzotta, she could meet Nicole
Arendt. A finalist last year, Arendt
would no doubt like to close her
collegiate career in style. But
then, so would Whitlinger. Should
the Stanford star's shoulder and
energy level hold up, she could
surprise.
Texas' Susan Gilchrist meets
California's Lisa Albano in one of
the day's feature matches. Albano

loves the baseline; Gilchrist lives
at the net. Both are quite good at
what they do.
Willens will likely have the mis
fortune of meeting Farley, who is
on fire. Willens looks forward to
the challenge, though, and is capa
ble of the major upset. Then
again, Farley is a legitimate threat
to win the whole tournament.
Shannan McCarthy probably
gets the pesky Emilie Viqueira in
the round of 16 today. Again, the
contrast in styles should be inter
esting. Look for McCarthy to edge
Viqueira behind her powerful
serve and volley.
Exum's struggle with Holmes
does not bode well for her since

she faces another human back
board in Georgia's Laura Kimel
today. This quarter of the draw is
wide open because of Birch's
health. If she can play at anything
near 100 percent, though, her
road to the semifinals is clear of
superstars. Of course, that's the
benefit of being the No. 1 seed.
Predicting the doubles tourna
ment is a sure way to look foolish.
Po and Sampras, the top seeds,
look formidable but two years ago
Sampras and Ceniza look like an
awesome No. 1 — and lost to
Birch and Graham. If you're look
ing for a sleeper team, try Susan
Gilchrist and Joanna Plautz of
Texas. If they don't wake up, you
didn't read it here.
