# Take time to appreciate experiences at Stanford
## 
### 
Sometimes I wonder why
many people — and people at
Stanford in particular —
never seem to really appreciate
everything they have.
It's something that a lot of peo
ple (including myself) don't think
about nearly enough, and I guess

the ones who are the most guilty
are the ones who have the most.
Living in a place as beautiful as
this, with all its opportunities, a
lot of us tend to forget just how
lucky we are.
Until, that is, we come very
close to losing whatever it is we
have — or are reminded, in some
way, that very few people have the
opportunities we do. Then, sud
denly, we see how lucky we are,
and what we have becomes that
much more important to us.
Take, for example, the
women's tennis team's win in the
NCAA title match on Sunday.

The championship was obvi
ously nothing new, because this
team wins it all every year. Think
about it: Six consecutive NCAA
crowns.
If ever a team deserved to have
a ho-hum attitude about NCAAs,
it's this one. What more do they
have to prove?
And yet there they were late
Sunday afternoon, collapsing on
Kylie Johnson after she hung on
at No. 6 for the fifth and decisive
win; there they were on the grand
stand courts, dancing and hug
ging each other; there they were,
laughing, accepting the trophy for
the umpteenth straight time and
then finding their families so they
could share the win with them.
Why the fuss? After all, doesn't
this sort of thing happen all the
time?
Well, yes, it does. This time,
however, was just a bit different:
This time, before the tournament
began, there was just a small pos
sibility that they were not going to
win.
Two players said after the
match that this title meant more
to them than any other because
they'd had doubts over whether
they'd be able to do it. Florida
