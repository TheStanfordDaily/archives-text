# Take time to appreciate experiences at Stanford
## 
### 
Sometimes I wonder why
many people — and people at
Stanford in particular —
never seem to really appreciate
everything they have.
It's something that a lot of peo
ple (including myself) don't think
about nearly enough, and I guess

the ones who are the most guilty
are the ones who have the most.
Living in a place as beautiful as
this, with all its opportunities, a
lot of us tend to forget just how
lucky we are.
Until, that is, we come very
close to losing whatever it is we
have — or are reminded, in some
way, that very few people have the
opportunities we do. Then, sud
denly, we see how lucky we are,
and what we have becomes that
much more important to us.
Take, for example, the
women's tennis team's win in the
NCAA title match on Sunday.

The championship was obvi
ously nothing new, because this
team wins it all every year. Think
about it: Six consecutive NCAA
crowns.
If ever a team deserved to have
a ho-hum attitude about NCAAs,
it's this one. What more do they
have to prove?
And yet there they were late
Sunday afternoon, collapsing on
Kylie Johnson after she hung on
at No. 6 for the fifth and decisive
win; there they were on the grand
stand courts, dancing and hug
ging each other; there they were,
laughing, accepting the trophy for
the umpteenth straight time and
then finding their families so they
could share the win with them.
Why the fuss? After all, doesn't
this sort of thing happen all the
time?
Well, yes, it does. This time,
however, was just a bit different:
This time, before the tournament
began, there was just a small pos
sibility that they were not going to
win.
Two players said after the
match that this title meant more
to them than any other because
they'd had doubts over whether
they'd be able to do it. Florida


I Cameron
Macky
hadn't lost all year; the Gators
kicked the Cardinal's butt in
March; and no host team had ever
won the title.
There was a chance that the
Cardinal would lose, there was a
chance that their title would be
taken away and there was a (tiny)
chance The Curse would come
through again.
None of it happened, but the
possibility was enough to make
this NCAA Championship just a
bit sweeter than the others.
The women's netters weren't
the only ones this last week
to think about how fortu
nate they are: Adam Keefe also
had a good, long chance to think
about it.
Keefe announced last Friday
that he'll be coming back to school
next year instead of entering the
NBA draft, turning down several
million dollars for the opportunity
to (wheel) take finals a few more
times.
Before everyone starts telling
Keefe that the decision might be
completely stupid in terms of dol
lars and cents, trust me: He
knows. In strictly a business
sense, this is probably the dumb
est thing he'll ever do. (Let's
hope.)
So why stay? Simple: He said
being with his teammates and
friends for another year would be
more valuable than any money
he'd make. He said he was in no
rush for basketball to become a
job.
And, most importantly, he said
there was too much happening at
Stanford to just give it up early.
A few days before Keefe
announced his decision, I thought

about something that Todd Lichti,
Stanford's last NBA-bound player,
told me in an interview several
months ago. I'd asked him what
he missed the most about Stan
ford, and he said his friends on the
team. Then he said something
that I haven't been able to forget:
He said he didn't think most
college students, including him,
ever really appreciated what they
had until after they'd graduated.
He wasn't talking about
classes, or opportunities for
future work because of the
"power" of a Stanford degree, or
even about the weather; instead,
he was talking about the people
we get to meet.
In college, he said, there was
always something exciting hap
pening, always someone to do
things with, "especially at Stan
ford, where you're surrounded by
so many incredible people," he
said. "There's always something
going on."
In"the real world," he said, it
just wasn't the same.
Keefe, as it turned out, talked
with Lichti before making his
decision to stay — and, appar
ently, he listened. He said he was
staying because he was childish
and immature, but I think it took
a little maturity for him to recog
nize how lucky he is to be in a very
special place.
He very easily could have left,
could have given up what he has
here. When he had to think about
life after Stanford, however,
maybe he realized that another
year here is not something to be
thrown away.
In spite of the business draw
backs of the decision, I think it
was the smartest decision
Keefe could have made, if only
because not everyone gets to be a
kid blessed with the ability and
the opportunity to be at Stanford.

It's something we could all
think about a little more often
than we do — and, with that in
mind, I'd like to invite everyone to
either volunteer for this week
end's Special Olympics or at least
come watch Saturday morning at
deGuerre.
Each year, on this one morning
that I spend helping a bunch of
athletes get across a 25-yard
stretch of water, I remember how
I usually take everything I have
for granted. I usually don't realize
that the most fundamental things
I do might be impossible for some
people, and this one morning
reminds me that maybe it's some
thing I could stand to think about
a little more often.
Every time I jump in that pool,
I think of how there's no solid rea
son that I should be the one help
ing them get through the water
instead of the other way around.
After all, my abilities —
whether it's the ability to swim or
to memorize formulas or to sing
or to write — were given to me not
because I earned them, not
because I deserved them and cer
tainly not because I had a right to
them.
I had nothing to do with it. My
abilities, and most everything that
I have — including my opportu
nity to be here — are gifts that
could easily have been given to
someone else.
Every now and then, some
thing reminds me of that —
whether it's the Special Olympics,
or the fact that in five very short
weeks I'm going to have to leave
this place — and I remember, for a
little while, just how truly lucky I
am.

Due to a series of mistakes made
early in his academic career,
Cameron Macky will be graduat
ing next month.

rush for basketball to become a
job.
And, most importantly, he said
there was too much happening at
Stanford to just give it up early.
A few days before Keefe
announced his decision, I thought

about something that Todd Lichti,
Stanford's last NBA-bound player,
told me in an interview several
months ago. I'd asked him what
he missed the most about Stan
ford, and he said his friends on the
team. Then he said something
that I haven't been able to forget:
He said he didn't think most
college students, including him,
ever really appreciated what they
had until after they'd graduated.
He wasn't talking about
classes, or opportunities for
future work because of the
"power" of a Stanford degree, or
even about the weather; instead,
he was talking about the people
we get to meet.
In college, he said, there was
always something exciting hap
pening, always someone to do
things with, "especially at Stan
ford, where you're surrounded by
so many incredible people," he
said. "There's always something
going on."
In"the real world," he said, it
just wasn't the same.
Keefe, as it turned out, talked
with Lichti before making his
decision to stay — and, appar
ently, he listened. He said he was
staying because he was childish
and immature, but I think it took
a little maturity for him to recog
nize how lucky he is to be in a very
special place.
He very easily could have left,
could have given up what he has
here. When he had to think about
life after Stanford, however,
maybe he realized that another
year here is not something to be
thrown away.
In spite of the business draw
backs of the decision, I think it
was the smartest decision
Keefe could have made, if only
because not everyone gets to be a
kid blessed with the ability and
the opportunity to be at Stanford.

It's something we could all
think about a little more often
than we do — and, with that in
mind, I'd like to invite everyone to
either volunteer for this week
end's Special Olympics or at least
come watch Saturday morning at
deGuerre.
Each year, on this one morning
that I spend helping a bunch of
athletes get across a 25-yard
stretch of water, I remember how
I usually take everything I have
for granted. I usually don't realize
that the most fundamental things
I do might be impossible for some
people, and this one morning
reminds me that maybe it's some
thing I could stand to think about
a little more often.
Every time I jump in that pool,
I think of how there's no solid rea
son that I should be the one help
ing them get through the water
instead of the other way around.
After all, my abilities —
whether it's the ability to swim or
to memorize formulas or to sing
or to write — were given to me not
because I earned them, not
because I deserved them and cer
tainly not because I had a right to
them.
I had nothing to do with it. My
abilities, and most everything that
I have — including my opportu
nity to be here — are gifts that
could easily have been given to
someone else.
Every now and then, some
thing reminds me of that —
whether it's the Special Olympics,
or the fact that in five very short
weeks I'm going to have to leave
this place — and I remember, for a
little while, just how truly lucky I
am.

Due to a series of mistakes made
early in his academic career,
Cameron Macky will be graduat
ing next month.
Sometimes I wonder why
many people — and people at
Stanford in particular —
never seem to really appreciate
everything they have.
It's something that a lot of peo
ple (including myself) don't think
about nearly enough, and I guess

the ones who are the most guilty
are the ones who have the most.
Living in a place as beautiful as
this, with all its opportunities, a
lot of us tend to forget just how
lucky we are.
Until, that is, we come very
close to losing whatever it is we
have — or are reminded, in some
way, that very few people have the
opportunities we do. Then, sud
denly, we see how lucky we are,
and what we have becomes that
much more important to us.
Take, for example, the
women's tennis team's win in the
NCAA title match on Sunday.

The championship was obvi
ously nothing new, because this
team wins it all every year. Think
about it: Six consecutive NCAA
crowns.
If ever a team deserved to have
a ho-hum attitude about NCAAs,
it's this one. What more do they
have to prove?
And yet there they were late
Sunday afternoon, collapsing on
Kylie Johnson after she hung on
at No. 6 for the fifth and decisive
win; there they were on the grand
stand courts, dancing and hug
ging each other; there they were,
laughing, accepting the trophy for
the umpteenth straight time and
then finding their families so they
could share the win with them.
Why the fuss? After all, doesn't
this sort of thing happen all the
time?
Well, yes, it does. This time,
however, was just a bit different:
This time, before the tournament
began, there was just a small pos
sibility that they were not going to
win.
Two players said after the
match that this title meant more
to them than any other because
they'd had doubts over whether
they'd be able to do it. Florida


I Cameron
Macky
hadn't lost all year; the Gators
kicked the Cardinal's butt in
March; and no host team had ever
won the title.
There was a chance that the
Cardinal would lose, there was a
chance that their title would be
taken away and there was a (tiny)
chance The Curse would come
through again.
None of it happened, but the
possibility was enough to make
this NCAA Championship just a
bit sweeter than the others.
The women's netters weren't
the only ones this last week
to think about how fortu
nate they are: Adam Keefe also
had a good, long chance to think
about it.
Keefe announced last Friday
that he'll be coming back to school
next year instead of entering the
NBA draft, turning down several
million dollars for the opportunity
to (wheel) take finals a few more
times.
Before everyone starts telling
Keefe that the decision might be
completely stupid in terms of dol
lars and cents, trust me: He
knows. In strictly a business
sense, this is probably the dumb
est thing he'll ever do. (Let's
hope.)
So why stay? Simple: He said
being with his teammates and
friends for another year would be
more valuable than any money
he'd make. He said he was in no
rush for basketball to become a
job.
And, most importantly, he said
there was too much happening at
Stanford to just give it up early.
