# Artist captures Stanford spirit
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Andrea Fono is a bundle of energy. She channels
most of her enthusiasm into her artwork, but the
remainder is exhibited through her wide grin and
boisterous laugh.
Normally, Fono lives in San Francisco, but for the
last two and a half months she has been camping out
at Stanford.
"My relationship these days is with the trees,
squirrels and birds of Stanford," she says.
As the artist commissioned by Stanford to paint
the official Stanford Centennial portfolio, Fono is
eager to translate campus architecture onto French
artist's paper.
The portfolio will consist of eight colored draw
ings of a variety of scenes around the campus, such
as the Mausoleum, the Barn, a student studying
and, of course, Hoover Tower and Memorial Church.
Fono says her scenes depict life at Stanford from
three points of view: that of the student, visitor and
artist.
In putting together her portfolio for the Stanford
Centennial, Fono has spent countless hours walking
around Stanford and talking to students and faculty
to get a feel for the best scenes to draw.
After getting ideas, she "plays around" with 10 to
20 sketches of a particular scene until she is ready to
paint with watercolors.
Fono says most of her paintings have to be made
early in the morning to capture the best sunlight.
While working on a project, Fono maintains a strict
behavioral regimen that includes "no socializing, no
alcohol and a 9 p.m. bedtime."
She says one of her toughest challenges thus far
in painting Stanford has been trying to camouflage
"a piece of bird doo-doo" which was dropped on a
palm tree in one of her paintings. She has also been
intimidated by high-speed frisbees, golf balls, roller
skaters and bikers.
"It's dangerous out here," she jokes.
Throughout her life, Fono has expressed herself
through art. "In school J had a hard time expressing
myself verbally and in writing," says Fono. "I had a
tendency to want to draw my reports. Since I was an
only child, I kept myself company with my paints
and crayons."
Several times during her childhood, Fono's par
ents sent her to Europe. Her parents, successful
restaurateurs in the Bay Area, were immigrants
from Hungary.
"I went to Europe a lot and established a relation

'Freedom is an important
theme in my work.'

ship with famous painters and their paintings,"
Fono says. Today she says her favorite artists are the
sculptors, painters and writers of late 19th and early
20th century France.
Although an accomplished artist as a child, Fono
took her first art class at Stanford in the summer of
1981. She studied art and photography at Sarah
Lawrence College, a liberal arts school outside of
Manhattan, where she graduated in 1986.
"My parents came [to the United States] during
the Revolution of 1956, which was successful
against the Communists for three days," she says.
"They are so proud to be Americans. They are about
as 'rah-rah' as you can imagine."
Fono's first language was Hungarian, and she
says art became her own way to communicate.
Fono says her Stanford drawings tend to be more
technical and realistic than her usual paintings,
which have been exhibited and sold around the
world. Her most famous pieces of art are monotypes
that contain abstract renditions of flowers and
ghost-like spirit bodies.
Monotypes are made by painting on plexiglass,
then putting a piece of white paper on the plexiglass
to transfer the painted image to the paper.
The spirit bodies have no facial features and
appear to be either dancing or running. "Freedom is
an important theme in my work," says Fono.
Fono's Stanford paintings will be exhibited in the
form of greeting cards in early June.
The Stanford portfolio is Fono's second project
commemorating an important anniversary in the
Bay Area. In 1987 Fono was named the official artist
for the 50th anniversary for the Golden Gate Bridge.
She put together several water-color landscapes of
the bridge and San Francisco for the event.
One of Fono's projects in the near future will be a
portfolio of the Rodin Sculpture Garden to raise
money for the Stanford Museum.
Stanford is one of her favorite places in the world,
Fono says.
"The University is a special place; this campus is
beautiful. The founders (Senator and Mrs. Stanford)
had a mystical vision of their son speaking to them
and saying, 'Even though I'm dead, live for human
ity.'"
