# Theta Delt members sign housing accords
## But AEPi member cites possible loophole 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
University administrators say they have
resolved the question of whether members
of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity could also
pledge at Alpha Epsilon Pi, but not all of
the Greek system members involved agree.
Stanford officials met with Theta Delt
officers yesterday to discuss the issues of
double-pledging and the housing privileges
of the fraternity
It had been rumored since Hush was
completed that pledges of AEPi, an
unhoused fraternity, were also joining the
Theta Delts to secure a home for AEPis and
to allow the Theta Delts to meet their
pledge quota.
Theta Delt officers surprised University
administrators at the meeting by turning in
specially-printed housing guarantee cards

The statements on the cards, which
required the signatures of all Theta Delt
pledges, read, "I am not now a member of a
Stanford University fraternity. I hereby

accept the offer to join the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity."
According to Row Director Jack Chin,
the Theta Delts met their pledge quota,
turning in 15 pledge cards. This year's
pledge quota for the Theta Delt house was
14 new pledges.
Administrators then briefly discussed
the University policy against double-pledg
ing with the officers. The remainder of the
meeting was spent discussing how the
Theta Delts could strengthen the fraternity
by bolstering their membership and becom

Administrators said they were pleased
with the outcome of the meeting. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson, who
directed the meeting, said, "There was a
definite sense of cooperation and good spirit
that flowed both ways."
However, not everyone in the fraternity
system believes the controversy has been
resolved.
