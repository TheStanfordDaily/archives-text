# Theta Delt members sign housing accords
## But AEPi member cites possible loophole 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
University administrators say they have
resolved the question of whether members
of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity could also
pledge at Alpha Epsilon Pi, but not all of
the Greek system members involved agree.
Stanford officials met with Theta Delt
officers yesterday to discuss the issues of
double-pledging and the housing privileges
of the fraternity
It had been rumored since Hush was
completed that pledges of AEPi, an
unhoused fraternity, were also joining the
Theta Delts to secure a home for AEPis and
to allow the Theta Delts to meet their
pledge quota.
Theta Delt officers surprised University
administrators at the meeting by turning in
specially-printed housing guarantee cards
with signed statements bv Theta Delt
pledges ensuring their membership in one
fraternity.
The statements on the cards, which
required the signatures of all Theta Delt
pledges, read, "I am not now a member of a
Stanford University fraternity. I hereby

accept the offer to join the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity."
According to Row Director Jack Chin,
the Theta Delts met their pledge quota,
turning in 15 pledge cards. This year's
pledge quota for the Theta Delt house was
14 new pledges.
Administrators then briefly discussed
the University policy against double-pledg
ing with the officers. The remainder of the
meeting was spent discussing how the
Theta Delts could strengthen the fraternity
by bolstering their membership and becom
ing more involved with the campus commu
nity.
Administrators said they were pleased
with the outcome of the meeting. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson, who
directed the meeting, said, "There was a
definite sense of cooperation and good spirit
that flowed both ways."
However, not everyone in the fraternity
system believes the controversy has been
resolved.
According to Keith Rabois, vice presi
dent of the Interfraternity Council and a
member of AEPi, the signed
statements "did not specifically
prohibit pledging at two fraterni
ties."
Rabois argued that since the
statement refers to "members"
and not pledges, it does not pre
vent students from double-pledg
ing. "Pledges are technically not
members of a fraternity. There
fore, the statement only applies to
active members," Rabois said.
Rabois would not comment on
whether or not some Theta Delt
pledges would use this semantic
loophole to pledge at AEPi.
Theta Delt president Rob
Tymoczko denied the existence of
any plot and said that "there are
no Theta Delt pledges that are
pledging at another fraternity."
Tymoczko said that six stu
dents who had intended to pledge
both fraternities decided to pledge
at the Theta Delts only, "choosing
the benefits of a housed fraternity
over the Jewish tradition of the
AEPis." The six pledges, whom he
would not identify, would most
likely maintain informal contact

with the AEPis in the future, he
said.
AEPi spokesman Mike Fox
said he had "no reaction" to the
results of the meeting.
Despite Rabois' suggestion
that the University's imprecise
policy provides a loophole, Uni
versity officials believe that none
of the Theta Delt pledges who
signed the statements intended to
double-pledge.
According to Robinson, "The
University is still acting under
the assumption that Theta Delt
pledges who signed the state
ments were being honest."
Robinson explained that the
University prohibits pledging at
more than one fraternity because
"houses are valuable University
resources allocated to one group
and only one group."
Houses "are allocated only to
the group that the University has
had an historical relationship
with, and they cannot be trans
ferred to another group," Robin
son said. "People can join more
than one fraternity, provided they
don't do so as a back door means
to get into a house."
If a fraternity and its members
intended to exploit the lack of an
explicit University policy, "the
fraternity would lose the house

and the University would file
(Fundamental Standard) charges
against each individual involved,"
Robinson said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin added that "the
University's intention had been
made perfectly clear. If we learn
that people have been dishonest
or surreptitious, everybody loses:
Theta Delts, the AEPis and every
individual found to be dishonest.
That is a promise."
In responding to Rabois' com
ments, Conklin said, "If we find
that his innuendoes are based in
fact, we will take the appropriate
action."
Conklin met with Theta Delt
Resident Assistant Samer
Hamadeh over the weekend,
"making it clear [to himj that the
University does not allow stu
dents to pledge at more the one
fraternity" to allow an unhoused
fraternity to secure a house.
Meanwhile, the reaction of the
IFC was mixed. IFC President
Erik Jorgensen said that
although the IFC was "supportive
of the actions of the Theta Delts,"
it was disappointed that the fra
ternities "have been forced to deal
with legalities because the Uni
versity has not been up front
about the issue."

meeting was spent discussing how the
Theta Delts could strengthen the fraternity
by bolstering their membership and becom
ing more involved with the campus commu
nity.
Administrators said they were pleased
with the outcome of the meeting. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson, who
directed the meeting, said, "There was a
definite sense of cooperation and good spirit
that flowed both ways."
However, not everyone in the fraternity
system believes the controversy has been
resolved.
According to Keith Rabois, vice presi
dent of the Interfraternity Council and a
member of AEPi, the signed
statements "did not specifically
prohibit pledging at two fraterni
ties."
Rabois argued that since the
statement refers to "members"
and not pledges, it does not pre
vent students from double-pledg
ing. "Pledges are technically not
members of a fraternity. There
fore, the statement only applies to
active members," Rabois said.
Rabois would not comment on
whether or not some Theta Delt
pledges would use this semantic
loophole to pledge at AEPi.
Theta Delt president Rob
Tymoczko denied the existence of
any plot and said that "there are
no Theta Delt pledges that are
pledging at another fraternity."
Tymoczko said that six stu
dents who had intended to pledge
both fraternities decided to pledge
at the Theta Delts only, "choosing
the benefits of a housed fraternity
over the Jewish tradition of the
AEPis." The six pledges, whom he
would not identify, would most
likely maintain informal contact

with the AEPis in the future, he
said.
AEPi spokesman Mike Fox
said he had "no reaction" to the
results of the meeting.
Despite Rabois' suggestion
that the University's imprecise
policy provides a loophole, Uni
versity officials believe that none
of the Theta Delt pledges who
signed the statements intended to
double-pledge.
According to Robinson, "The
University is still acting under
the assumption that Theta Delt
pledges who signed the state
ments were being honest."
Robinson explained that the
University prohibits pledging at
more than one fraternity because
"houses are valuable University
resources allocated to one group
and only one group."
Houses "are allocated only to
the group that the University has
had an historical relationship
with, and they cannot be trans
ferred to another group," Robin
son said. "People can join more
than one fraternity, provided they
don't do so as a back door means
to get into a house."
If a fraternity and its members
intended to exploit the lack of an
explicit University policy, "the
fraternity would lose the house

and the University would file
(Fundamental Standard) charges
against each individual involved,"
Robinson said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin added that "the
University's intention had been
made perfectly clear. If we learn
that people have been dishonest
or surreptitious, everybody loses:
Theta Delts, the AEPis and every
individual found to be dishonest.
That is a promise."
In responding to Rabois' com
ments, Conklin said, "If we find
that his innuendoes are based in
fact, we will take the appropriate
action."
Conklin met with Theta Delt
Resident Assistant Samer
Hamadeh over the weekend,
"making it clear [to himj that the
University does not allow stu
dents to pledge at more the one
fraternity" to allow an unhoused
fraternity to secure a house.
Meanwhile, the reaction of the
IFC was mixed. IFC President
Erik Jorgensen said that
although the IFC was "supportive
of the actions of the Theta Delts,"
it was disappointed that the fra
ternities "have been forced to deal
with legalities because the Uni
versity has not been up front
about the issue."
