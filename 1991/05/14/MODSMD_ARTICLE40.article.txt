# Stanford reduces water use
## 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
Stanford can congratulate itself on the efficient
use of at least one resource this spring.
The University, reversing an expensive trend of
excessive water use begun last fall, saved enough
water in the last several months to recover fines
totaling more than $300,000.
By mid-May, Stanford's water reduction reached
nearly 92 million gallons, according to Utilities Man
ager David Kaye of Operations and Maintenance.
The fines were levied when Stanford exceeded its
water allotment by more than 72 million gallons dur
ing the months of August, September, October and
November of last year. The San Francisco Water
Department charged the University $302,630 for
that interval.
"The University has not exceeded its water allot
ment since December," Kaye said. "Everybody made
an effort to conserve water."
Due to the accomplishments of the Stanford com
munity, Kaye said, "we have recovered our penalties
and will return these funds to the respective con
sumer budgets."
Stanford purchases its water from San Francisco,
which owns the Hetch Hetchy reservoir system.
However, after the penalties were imposed, the Uni
versity chose to rely more heavily on water from its
own wells.
The well water is safe and potable, but is hard
and, according to some people, has an inferior taste.
Hard water, Kaye explained, has a negative effect on
equipment such as dining facilities and heating sys
tems.

Since Stanford has proved capable of reducing
water use, the wells will be switched off at the end of
May, Kaye said.
"This means that the entire campus will be served
by the Hetch Hetchy system and the hard-water
problems will go away," Kaye said.
"But this does not mean we can revert back to old
habits. We must remain aware of the fact that we are
still in a drought and exceeding our allotment is
costly," he added.
San Francisco had planned to cut down its allot
ment to Stanford even further, from the current 25
percent to a proposed 45 percent below 1987 water
usage levels. However, the city canceled those plans
due to particularly heavy rainfall during March.
According to Kaye, a major goal has been to
encourage conservation so that Stanford can avoid
fines during future drought years. The University
has taken such steps as using lake water for irriga
tion, limiting irrigation to high-priority areas, a pub
lic awareness and education program and the close
monitoring of daily water use. Faculty residences, all
of which now have water meters, are also being mon
itored.
