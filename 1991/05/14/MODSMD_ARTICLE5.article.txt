# Donation will provide student SUNet access

A donation of computer hardware com
ponents worth $123,500 will enable all stu
dents living in University housing to access
SUNet services on their personal comput
ers.
The donation will make the service avail
able within three years despite Stanford's
budgetary woes.
Bob Street, vice president for libraries
and information systems, formally accept
the Cisco Systems Inc. donation at the Fac
ulty Club yesterday The gift was originally
offered to the University on April 29.
The new hardware will allow students to
access all of SUNet's resources in their own
rooms, including library and information
resources on the Stanford campus and
overseas.
SUNet is connected to Internet, which is
a member of the Bay Area Regional
Research Network, the National Science
Foundation Foundation Network and BIT
NET, a worldwide network of university
computer centers.

Previously, students who wished to
access SUNet had to purchase a modem for
their personal computers or go to a com
puter cluster.
Stanford's combination of information
resources, communication tools and com
puting services is expected to be a model for
university campuses across the country,
according to Bill Yundt, director of net
working and communication systems.
Catherine Muther, Stanford alumna and
vice president for marketing at Cisco,
agreed. "Stanford is a model for individual
access," she said.
Cisco Systems Inc. is a company founded
by five Stanford employees, three of whom
are graduates, more than six years ago. The
company now has 16 Stanford alumni, 12 of
whom underwrote the donation, according
to Muther.
Cisco is making three AGS+ routers
available. This equipment allows similar
machines to share data across a network,
said Jeff Paine, marketing and communica
tions manager at Cisco.
One router has been donated
outright while the other two are
being offered at significantly dis
counted rates, according to Eliza
beth Sloan, director of communi
cation for the Office of Develop
ment.
The new routers will run a
fiber-distributed data interface
card, which allows data transfer
at 100 megabytes per second.
This is a speed 10 times faster
than Ethernet, the system cur
rently linking Stanford comput
ers.
The basic process of connect
ing all dorm computers to SUNet
and upgrading selective ethernet
connections to the fiber dis
tributed data interface should be
completed in three years â€” five if
budgetary problems worsen, said
Yundt.
John Morgridge, president of

'We are proud of the
association [with
Stanford]. Our gift is
representative of
that.'

Cisco, explained his company's
donation to Stanford in terms of
commitment to education.
"Education has had a big
impact on my life. If you are going
to keep it going you have to invest
in it," Morgridge said. "The
money that students pay in
tuition does not cover the real
cost. Someone has to pick it up
and it should not all come from
the government," he added.
Morgridge also emphasized the
mutual relationship that the com
pany has with Stanford.
"Stanford tests some of our
products in their computer sci
ence department and on their net
work. The students get a kick out

of telling us what we are doing
wrong," Morgridge said. "They
learn something about real world
relevance. We benefit because,
without a profit motive, a univer
sity can experiment and tends to
be on the cutting edge of technol
ogy.
"We are proud of the associa
tion [with Stanford). Our gift is
representative of that," Mor
gridge added.
Other Cisco employees
expressed the same feelings.
"We are acknowledging her
itage and corporate indebted
ness," said Paine.
Council of Presidents-elect
member John Overdeck said the
ASSU Senate has been working to
gain this benefit.
"This is great news. We were
expecting to have to fight long
and hard for this," Overdeck said.
"A lot of grad students have
been very active fighting for this
system," he added. "This should
encourage us to fight for other
student services."
