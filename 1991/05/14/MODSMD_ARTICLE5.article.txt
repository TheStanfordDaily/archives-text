A donation of computer hardware com
ponents worth $123,500 will enable all stu
dents living in University housing to access
SUNet services on their personal comput
ers.
The donation will make the service avail
able within three years despite Stanford's
budgetary woes.
Bob Street, vice president for libraries
and information systems, formally accept
the Cisco Systems Inc. donation at the Fac
ulty Club yesterday The gift was originally
offered to the University on April 29.
The new hardware will allow students to
access all of SUNet's resources in their own
rooms, including library and information
resources on the Stanford campus and
overseas.
SUNet is connected to Internet, which is
a member of the Bay Area Regional
Research Network, the National Science
Foundation Foundation Network and BIT
NET, a worldwide network of university
computer centers.

Previously, students who wished to
access SUNet had to purchase a modem for
their personal computers or go to a com
puter cluster.
Stanford's combination of information
resources, communication tools and com
puting services is expected to be a model for
university campuses across the country,
according to Bill Yundt, director of net
working and communication systems.
Catherine Muther, Stanford alumna and
vice president for marketing at Cisco,
agreed. "Stanford is a model for individual
access," she said.
Cisco Systems Inc. is a company founded
by five Stanford employees, three of whom
are graduates, more than six years ago. The
company now has 16 Stanford alumni, 12 of
whom underwrote the donation, according
to Muther.
Cisco is making three AGS+ routers
available. This equipment allows similar
machines to share data across a network,
said Jeff Paine, marketing and communica
tions manager at Cisco.
