# Playwright enraptured by work

Playwright Neil Simon related some
of his insights on the joys and dangers
of being a professional writer to an audi
ence of about 350 in Kresge Auditorium
last night.
Simon said he loves the fact that
writing enables him to work for hours
without becoming bored. Even though
he often writes alone in one room all
day, he said, "I have never felt lonely
[writing]. I feel alive with the charac
ters. They are in the office waiting to for
me to arrive."
Simon, whose 27 plays include
"Biloxi Blues" and "Brighton Beach
Memoirs," attributed his success to a
lack of fear of writing. Writers must not
succumb to fears of failure or embar
rassment, he said, because scenes and
acts can always be rewritten and
improved.
Simon, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize
this year for his play "Lost in Yonkers,"
first started writing when he was 13
years old. His brother Danny, who was
then in high school, convinced Simon to
begin what would become a lifelong
career.
Together they wrote jokes and sto
ries which were first published in local
newspapers and were later broadcast on

the radio and television. It was then
that Simon decided he wanted to write
plays, although the task at that time
seemed like "climbing Mt. Everest."
One of Simon's most well-known
plays, "The Odd Couple," was inspired
by his brother Danny. "The Odd Cou
ple" is the story of Oscar and Felix, two
men who decide to share an apartment
despite their different personalities.
While visiting his brother in Califor
nia, Simon witnessed an argument
between Danny and his roommate Roy.
The pair was holding a dinner party and
Danny became very upset when he dis
covered that his pot roast was going to
be finished before the guests arrived.
Simon said, "I couldn't believe I was
watching two grown men arguing about
pot roast. I said 'This is a play."' Simon
said this play addresses the "universal
theme" that "two people living together
are bound to fight."
Simon also talked about the dangers
of being a playwright.
He said he sometimes feels that he
has become "an observer of life" rather
than a participant. Because he never
loses the "perspective of a playwright,"
Simon said he cannot experience life as
it really is.
After writing several plays, Simon
turned to films, most recently working

'I have never felt lone
ly [writing]. I feel alive
with the characters.
They are in the office
waiting to for me to
arrive.'
— Neil Simon

with Disney on "The Marrying Man," a
movie starring Kim Basinger and Alec
Baldwin.
Working on movies made Simon real
ize how much more he eryoys writing
for the theater. Film writers lose control
over their work, he said, because they
must meet demands made by producers,
directors and actors. He said that at
Disney "the writer is the low man on
the totem pole."
After speaking for about an hour in
Kresge, Simon moved to Florence
Moore Hall's main lounge to answer
questions in an informal setting.
