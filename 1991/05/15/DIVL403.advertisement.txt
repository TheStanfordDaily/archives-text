RESPOND
TO
SEXUAL
ASSAULT
The prevalence of sexual assault at Stanford is alarmingly high. Thirty-seven percent of graduate women, 29% of undergraduate women, 10% of
undergraduate men, and 16% of graduate men responding to thel9B9 Stanford Rape Education Project Survey indicated that they had been coerced or
forced into full sexual activity against their will. For the undergraduate women, 55% of these incidents occurred at Stanford.
"The Sexual Assault Task Force released its report yesterday amid campus-wide praise. However,
University officials are concerned about the cost of implementing its recommendations.'"
Prompted by the survey's findings, the Dean of Student Affairs created a Task Force on Sexual Assault. The Task Force was charged to investi
gate the issues surrounding sexual assault at Stanford and make recommendations for University response. The Task Force worked for eighteen
months to develop these recommendations and submitted its report in November of 1990. When the report was released to the campus, the adminis
tration responded that it could not implement any of the recommendations that required funding, because of current "budgetary concerns."
"The task force felt and feels strongly that we need a visible, accessible person who is specifically
designated to coordinate a comprehensive approach to sexual assault. 2 "

The University plans to move forward with some of the recommendations; however, it refuses to create and fund the position of Coordinator of
Sexual Assault Response Services. This coordinator would be responsible for assisting rape survivors with judicial, medical, academic, residential and
emotional concerns.
"The University is trying to spread out the coordinator's responsibilities among several departments. 3 "
Instead of creating the Coordinator position, the administration has divided responsibility for these services among various staff members. This
is an inefficient, haphazard, and ineffective response. Under this system, sexual assault survivors do not know where to go for assistance. Further
more. since no one staff member can provide all of the necessary services, this system requires sexual assault survivors to describe their experiences
repeatedly. Moreover, busy staff members are being asked to assume additional responsibilities and maintain coordinated efforts.
"(Preventing) sexual assault is clearly a top priority for students. 4 "
The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) are considering donating the funds to support a Coordinator for one year as an
emergency measure. The ASSU is demonstrating its commitment to alleviating the problem of sexual assault on campus. It is time for the University
to do the same.
"The University must do more to ensure that a full-time coordinator is hired as soon as possible.

Dear President Kennedy:
Stanford University must provide funding for sexual assault prevention and response
immediately. I believe the University should fund the position of Coordinator of Sexual As
sault Response Services, as recommended by the Task Force on Sexual Assault. I urge you
to take the necessary steps to provide this coordinator immediately.
Sincerely,
