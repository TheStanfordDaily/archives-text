### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
Artists, art fans and sup
porters of the earthquake-dam
aged Stanford Museum are
finally getting some good news.
In celebrating the muse
um's, and also Leland Stanford
Jr.'s, 100 th birthday yesterday,
Stanford's Committee for Art
announced that $1 million had
been collected and pledged by
museum supporters to rebuild
the temporarily closed facility.
Acting museum director and
Art Department Chair Wanda
Corn also introduced Thomas
Seligman, who will become
director Aug. 1, to a gathering
of 200 people in front of the
museum. Seligman has spent
the last 20 years working in
fine arts museums in San
Francisco, where he specialized
in African art.
"I am very excited to be
coming back to Stanford and
optimistic about the (recon
struction) project," said Selig
man, who graduated from
Stanford in 1965.
Seligman recognizes he
faces a tough challenge in over
seeing the museum's recon
struction, as shown by the
chain-link fence that sur
rounds the building. "I never
contemplated being a director
of a closed museum," Seligman
joked.
"[The museum] is essen
tially all messed up," said Selig
man.
University President Don
ald Kennedy told the audience
that he was captivated by Selig
man's interview for the direc
tor position, specifically by
Seligman's goals of bringing
the museum closer to the aca
demic and learning life of Stan
ford.

Thomas Seligman, the new director of the Stanford Museum, speaks at the muse

assist In repairing the facility for a 1994 re-opening.
"expand the museum's influence
in the surrounding community"
and enhance the museum's art.
The museum is currently
scheduled to be reopened in three
years. The rebuilding project also
includes a modernization of the
facility.
Describing the museum's
problems, Corn said the facility
"suffered a stroke" in the 1989
earthquake, "needed a facelift"
for the cracks in the walls, "and
had trouble regulating her body
temperature" because of the bro
ken humidity system.
At its annual meeting last year,
the Committee for Art faced
many uncertainties about the
museum's future, most impor
tant being the problem of raising

birthday, plus a gift to give her another 100

day, but it's all in our hearts.'

sufficient funds to rebuild.
The tone for this year's meet
ing and celebration, however, was
entirely optimistic. "Today we are
celebrating [the museum's] birth
day," said Corn, "plus a gift to
give her another 100 years.
"I don't suppose we'll sing
happy birthday, but it's all in our
hearts."
Yesterday's celebration cen
tered also focused on two of the
museum's dedicated servants of
the past, Jane Stanford and
Lorenz Eitner, an art professor
emeritus.
"Jane Stanford is surely one of

Stanford's greatest dreamers,"
said Seligman. "She was its
founder, funder, director and
curator. She was the museum."
Eitner also played a large role
in the museum's history, serving
as museum director and Art
Department chair for 26 years.
Unlike Eitner, Seligman will
concentrate solely on directing
the museum, thanks to the $1.2
million Freidenrich endowment
for his position. In the past, the
museum has always been directed
by the chair of the Art Depart
ment.
