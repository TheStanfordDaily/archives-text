# Ethnicity class added to Am Stud major

Two new race and ethnicity class require
ments will be added to the American Studies
major at the end of this year.
One course, titled "Race and Ethnicity in
the American Experience," will be required of
all students who declare American studies,
according to Monica Moore, the program s
administrator.
"I think because the major is pretty flexible,
the new requirement will not be an imposition.
It will serve as an important opportunity to

learn more," said Jeannette LaFors, who will
graduate this spring with an American Studies
degree.
Another change requires new majors to
take a second race and ethnicity course as part
of the major's 11-course concentration
requirement. In addition, students taking at
least five such courses will have the option of
graduating with a race and ethnicity special
ization in American studies.
The changes will affect anyone who declares
the major after Aug. 31.
Members of the American Studies adminis
trative committee say the change will

strengthen the curriculum by adding rigor i n
the area of multiculturalism.
The new mandatory course, American Stud
ies 164, has been added to two other core
requirements. In addition to the three core
classes, American studies majors also have to
fulfill the concentration requirement.
"My impression is that they cover [aspects
of race and ethnicity] pretty well in other class
es, but [the change] is not a bad idea. It
depends on how they teach the class. As long as
it does not become just another politically cor
rect action," it's OK, said junior Sherromba
Barbee, another American Studies major.
