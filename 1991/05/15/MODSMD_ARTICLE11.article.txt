Bush chooses new CIA chief
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush yes
terday named Robert Gates to head the CIA,
brushing aside questions about Iran-Contra links
that made former President Reagan withdraw
Gates' nomination to the post four years ago.
Bush nominated Gates, a 25-year intelli
gence veteran with extensive experience as a
Soviet analyst, as director of central intelligence
to succeed William Webster who is retiring.
Gates had been named deputy CIA chief in
1986, then moved two years ago to the White
House where he worked closely with Bush as
his deputy director of national security.
"Bob Gates has performed with wisdom and
precision in laying out the options for presiden
tial action. He is a good man and I am proud to
send his name up to the Senate," Bush said
Communists will be likely
winners of Nepal election
KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A Communist
alliance emerged yesterday as a major political
force in Nepal after defeating the prime minis
ter and capturing many districts considered
loyal to his party.
Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai,
who led last year's campaign against the
monarchy at the head of the Nepali Congress
party, resigned earlier yesterday after his upset
by Marxist activist Madan Bhandari, 39.
"It is inappropriate for me to continue in
government on political and moral grounds,"
Bhattarai said after results showed him losing
his Katmandu district seat.
Final results in the Nepal's first multiparty
elections in 32 years are not expected before
Friday. Ballots from many remote constituen
cies were still being collected.
Croat to become Yugoslavia's
first non-Communist president
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Former
political prisoner Stipe Mesic of Croatia is to
become Yugoslavia's first non-Communist
chief executive today, but ethnic passions
threaten the transfer of power.
In the scheduled rotation of the eight-mem
ber collective presidency, the 56-year-old
lawyer would take over as chairman for one
year, succeeding Borisav Jovic of rival Serbia.
But in a period when there is open talk of
civil war between Serbs and Croats, what was a
quiet ritual during Communist rule is anything
but certain this time.
