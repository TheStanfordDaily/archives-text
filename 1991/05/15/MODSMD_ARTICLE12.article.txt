JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — A judge sentenced Winnie
Mandela to six years in prison yester
day on kidnap and accessory-to-assault
charges, saying the wife of black leader
Nelson Mandela had shown no
remorse for the crimes.
Mrs. Mandela stood silently and
showed no emotion as the sentence
was read, but outside the court, she
raised her fist defiantly to a cheering
crowd and declared: "The struggle
goes on!"
The judge, who convicted Mrs.

Mandela on Monday after a politically
sensitive three-month trial, freed her
pending an appeal that could take
months. South Africa has no jury tri
als; verdicts and sentencing are done
by the judge.
The conviction and stiff sentence
for his wife could put pressure on Nel
son Mandela to take a harder line
against the white-led government,
because Mrs. Mandela's militant fol
lowers see her as a political martyr.
The ANC is the leading black opposi
tion group and has been holding talks

with the government on political
reform.
Mrs. Mandela, 56, was given five
years in prison for the four kidnap
counts and one year for being an acces
sory after the fact to assaults on the
kidnap victims.
Mandela's wife and two co-defen
dants had pleaded innocent to eight
counts of kidnap and assault. Prosecu
tors alleged they abducted four young
men aged 14 to 29 from a church home
in December 1988 and beat them in
her Soweto home because of claims the

four engaged in homosexual relations
or spied for police.
"There has been no indication that
any of you feels the slightest remorse,"
Justice M.S. Stegmann said as the
three stood before him.
Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, a leader in the anti-apartheid
movement, said he was "shocked" by
the severity of the sentence.
"The movement will continue and
will honor her for the good things that
she did and recognize that human
beings are human beings," he said.
