# Question of U.N. role may impede peace talks
## 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Sec
retary of State James A. Baker 111
met with Jordan's King Hussein
yesterday and said afterwards
that all parties he has consulted
with in his Middle East diplomacy
"have agreed essentially" to
attend a regional peace confer
ence.
But Baker acknowledged that
"the possibility of a U.N. role" was
still a sticking point in the way of
convening such a meeting.
He met with reporters after
more than three hours of talks
with Hussein, who told reporters
at a news conference: "I believe
we share a total commitment to
the cause of peace in this region
that is long overdue."
Hussein added, "I believe this
chance that now exists for a peace
process to start ... will probably
never come again," although he
dodged questions about his own
country's participation.
Baker is on his fourth trip to
the Middle East since the end of
the Persian Gulf War. He drove to
Israel from Jordan after meeting
with the king.
His caution that there
remained differences over a UN
role came on top of comments on
Monday, when he outlined several
obstacles, including the role of the
UN and the question of Pales
tinian representation.
Despite Hussein's comments
about the desirability of peace, the
Jordanian monarch would not say

if he would attend an interna
tional Mideast peace conference if
Syria refused to participate.
Syria is insisting on a United
Nations role in such a conference
but Israel has rejected that idea.
Syria also wants assurances
that a Mideast peace conference
would meet regularly to check
progress. Israeli leaders want to
adjourn immediately into bilat
eral talks following a one-time
international gathering.
Hussein also said that if asked
by "our Palestinian brothers,"
Jordan would consider forming a
joint delegation for the talks. But
he refused to say whether that
included the Palestine Liberation
Organization, whose participation
Israel rejects.
Baker had planned to fly to
Israel, but he decided yesterday
morning to go by motorcade
instead, passing through the
Judean Hills, Jericho and other
Palestinian Arab strongholds.
Bush and Baker are trying to
prod Israel into a peace confer
ence in which they hope Israel will
yield all or most of the occupied
territories in exchange for peace
and Arab recognition.
The conference in Bush's view
should produce surrender of terri
tory by Israel in exchange for
Arab recognition.
But Shamir said on Sunday
"we cannot relinquish any portion
of the land."
