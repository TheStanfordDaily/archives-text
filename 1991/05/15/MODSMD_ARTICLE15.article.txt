## A 						responsive ASSU 
### 
University has left void
on sexual assault issue;
ASSU is trying to fill it

IN FEBRUARY, THE SEXUAL
Assault Task Force made sev
eral propoals to combat a prob
lem that is affecting far too many
students. Little has been accom
plished since then. Fortunately, the
ASSU is taking the lead on making
the recommendations a reality.
Administrators and students
alike agree that these proposals
should be implemented by the Uni
versity. Nevertheless, administra
tors have stated the University
cannot currently afford to hire a
coordinator of sexual assault
response services. As a result,
members of this year's and next
year's ASSU Senate and Council of
Presidents are proposing that the
ASSU spend $40,000 next year to
fund sexual-assault prevention and
education projects as well as the
hiring of a temporary coordinator.
Cheers to the ASSU. The facts
undeniably show a need for pre
vention programs. One-third of the
Stanford women and one-eighth of
the Stanford men who responded
to a survey done by the Stanford
Rape Education Project reported
having full sexual activity when
they did not want to.
The proposal is not ideal, but it
is nice to see students taking initia
tive within the student govern
ment. If the ASSU can hire a coor
dinator, it will be providing a
needed and valuable service for the
community, responding to a stu
dent priority in a situation where
the University is unable to. At the
same time, of course, the ASSU
cannot simply hire the first person
who comes along seeking the coor
dinator position. It is imperative
that a thorough search be com

pleted to ensure the hiring of the
most qualified candidate possible.
Moreover, although the ASSU is
stepping up to meet the problem,
the University should not consider
the issue settled. Instead, the Uni
versity must make the sexual
assault post its own priority and
relieve the ASSU of its financial
responsibility as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, given that next year
the ASSU will most probably be
funding the sexual-assault preven
tion and education projects, the
University should assist in every
possible way and treat the sexual
assault post as though it has full
University authority.
Imagine the ASSU starting a
program which commands Univer
sity authority. They could be on to
something here. Seizing the initia
tive on the sexual assault issue
could be a way for the ASSU to
start building legitimacy and
respect among the student body.
There would be no better way to
earn students' respect than by act
ing on one of their top priorities
and implementing the proposals of
the Sexual Assault Task Force.
Members of the COP-elect
should be applauded not only for
the worthiness of the cause, but
also for acting on their campaign
promises. It is all the more com
mendable and optimistic that they
are not even in office yet and they
are already encouraging change.
It is important for the sexual
assault prevention and education
programs to start getting under
way as quickly as possible because
the Sexual Assault Task Force
identified Orientation as a time of
critical importance and a valuable
opportunity for educating incom
ing freshmen. Holding programs
during Orientation seems espe
cially necessary since the Rape
Education Project has reported
that a significant percentage of all
sexual assaults occur during fresh
men year.
