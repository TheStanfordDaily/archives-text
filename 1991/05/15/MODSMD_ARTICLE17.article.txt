## Hold the sex; let's read 
### 
The signs of spring are
everywhere. Studious souls snooze
in the afternoon sun, textbooks
sprawled on their chests. Leaves have
made the campus green again. And hover
ing in the air, like a spreading fog, can be
heard the strange song, simultaneously
celebratory and lamenting, of graduating
seniors anticipating the real world.
I shouldn't care; I'm only a sopho
more. I should be able to laugh with scorn
and tell myself that I have years before I
have to start thinking about those things.
But I can't help feeling sympathy pains,
and even a little anticipation of my own.
Jobs are scarce; one college student
quoted recently in The New York Times
interviewed with 199 companies and
didn't get a single offer. Graduate schools,
receiving a wave of failed job-seekers, are
becoming more competitive. And even the
Peace Corps is harder to get into than it
used to be.
So maybe it makes sense that my con
versations with my parents have come to
focus as much on my plans for graduate
school as on what I'm doing now. Maybe I
should be deliberating whether to get a
master's or a doctorate and deciding what
schools to apply to. After all, it's never too
early to start looking for the classes,
activities and internships that will look
the best on my resume.
But there's a big difference between
planning for the future and living for it.
Planning is fine; so is serious thought.
It's better to burn some brain cells ahead
of time than to graduate and find the only
job you're qualified for is pumping gas.
Our obsession with ensuring a fruitful

future, however, can sometimes make us
forget that there's a present we should
probably be taking advantage of.
In high school, college was our great,
glowing future. We slaved over boring
classes, joined countless clubs and
crammed for the SAT so that we might
one day be able to enjoy the freedom col
lege had to offer. But now that we're here,
it's more of the same; our reward has
been put off again, relocated to the mate
rial benefits and professional satisfaction
of a career.
We think that someday we'll "make it"
and be able to relax and appreciate life
fully. But that end is constantly receding
and, in the long run, is only a phantom. Is
retirement the good life? How about the
nursing home?
The world of careers and marriages
and children isn't any more "real" than
the one we inhabit now; the "real," gras
pable substance of life lies in the present,
and it's there that we'll find our greatest
pleasures, both brief and lasting.
I'm not saying we should all drop out
of school and make wanton love in the
streets, but we clearly have something to
learn about enjoying ourselves. I've seen
the best minds of my generation driven
mad by biology midterms, and for what?
A slight edge in the rats' procession to
medical school? It's hard to think that
anyone can really care that much about
grades, but we do, and we suffer for it.
We complain that our lives are miser
able because we have so much work, then
do a double-take at the suggestion that we
simply not do the work. Pleasure just

isn't one of our major concerns because
we assume it will magically drop into our
laps one day 10 or 15 years down the road.
The love of knowledge, which might
justify our devotion to study, is largely a
myth. We read what the professor tells us
will be on the final, which will in turn
affect our grade-point average and help to
determine where we end up in the "real"
world. Ours is a practical education, at its
best and worst: We learn lots on how to
work and nothing on how to live.
Stanford isn't unique regard,
but the effect of this social
nature of the student body is remarkable.
When people pass up sex to catch up on
reading — as has been known to happen
here on more than one occasion — some
thing is seriously wrong.
Take a break. Skip class today. Read a
book for kicks. Go to the beach. Make
sure you have as good a time as you possi
bly can, as often as you possibly can, or
before you know it you'll be 50, sitting
behind a desk and on top of the world,
wondering when the fun's going to start.
