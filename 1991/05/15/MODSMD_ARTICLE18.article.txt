## Columnist unfairly critical of IFC Judicial Board 
### 
I'M WRITING IN RESPONSE TO
Tim Marklein's May 13 column,
"Debilitating paranoia." Marklein
suggests fraternities form policies based
on a paranoia that "everyone in the
administration hates all fraternities."
He also accuses the Interfraternity
Council and the IFC Judicial Board of
making decisions that are designed only
to "cover the fraternities' butts," deci
sions he says are based solely on issues
of "social justice and principles of fair
ness."
The judicial board was established
this fall as part of a comprehensive effort
to provide self-regulation in the Greek
system. This self-government was
designed with the help of many Univer
sity administrators. The judicial board's
mission is to investigate possible viola
tions of IFC and University policy and
levy appropriate punishments if viola
tions are found.

Obviously, the judicial board is con
cerned with Greek issues when investi
gating an incident, but it does not pro
tect fraternities that have committed
violations. The judicial board protects
the Greek system by issuing fair punish
ments to fraternities that violate either
University regulations or regulations
that the IFC has determined are vital to
protecting the growth and survival of the
Greek community.
The judicial board is committed to
using a set of standards in evaluating its
decisions on possible violations so that
each case is treated equitably. But if the
judicial board is going to be charged with
policing the University's regulations, it
must know explicitly what these regula
tions are, specifically those of the new
alcohol policy.
The University has been sending very
mixed messages. On the one hand, it
overlooks blatant violations like those at
Alpha Sigma; on the other hand, it scru

tinizes other organizations for commit
ting much lesser offenses. How can the
University expect the IFC to provide a
consistent system of self-regulation that
includes the University's rules when the
University itself doesn't consistently
enforce its own policies?
I'm particularly surprised by
Marklein's statement that "many frater
nities devise ways to avoid getting into
trouble rather than planning ways to
make parties safer for guests." The IFC
Social Committee spent many weeks
establishing an IFC social policy that
would reduce liability for host fraterni
ties and provide a safe and enjoyable
environment for all party-goers, drinkers
and non-drinkers alike.
The policy is heavily influenced by
many campus programs designed to edu
cate students on safe party-planning. In
addition to the IFC policy, each frater
nity is required to have a written policy
detailing the steps and precautions used

at a party to ensure the safety of the
guests.
In my own fraternity, we have signs
clearly displaying STOP Safe
Transportation Program's phone num
ber, signs informing guests of the legal
drinking age, effective door security,
sober monitors actively looking for
potentially dangerous situations, people
designated to assist any guests who may
need assistance returning home safely,
and a host of other procedures all
designed to make our parties safe.
All of these procedures are mandated
in the IFC's social policy. Does this
sound like superficiality and only an
effort to "cover the fraternities' butts"? I
think these are genuine measures to pro
vide a safe party environment, and I
hope they will serve as a model for the
rest of the campus.
