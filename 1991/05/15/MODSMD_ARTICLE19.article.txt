STUART REGES, I UNDERSTAND
the shock and dismay you obviously
must feel because of your recent fir
ing. Clearly, the University could not
comprehend the magnitude of your self
sacrifice.
However, I've been studying your sit
uation very carefully and have come to
the conclusion that this is the best thing
that could have happened to you. Instead
of proceeding with a court case, you
should thank the University for opening
up more opportunities for you.
Teaching is a very limiting profession.
I mean, you get stuck in a position for 20
or 30 years with little or no recognition;
everybody's on your back all the time,
and the students really don't want to
learn anyway. And for what? A measly

$50,000 — maybe $60,000 or $70,000 —
a year. Drug trafficking is by far a more
lucrative endeavor.
"But," you might counter, "I could
have had such a large clientele if only I
were able to stay at Stanford." Not
really. Most Stanford students — indeed,
college students in general — are intelli
gent enough to know the danger to mind
and body, the destruction of families, and
the risks to the community when one
uses drugs. You probably wouldn't have
had too much business around here.
But that's OK, because you can just
open up shop in the neighborhoods of
East Palo Alto. You can still live at your
present address, since it's conveniently
located right over U.S. Highway 101.
Or, if you feel you must get away from

the area, there's always South Central
Los Angeles.
True, the inhabitants of these areas
aren't necessarily the richest, but with
your background as a former professor
at one of the top universities in the coun
try, you should have no trouble in con
vincing them that you only have their
best interests in mind. They would be
eating out of your hands in no time!
The best thing about this setup is that
if you're really ambitious and put your
mind to it, you can have your first mil
lion before the "crack babies" you helped
to produce are old enough to go to school
— that is, if they live that long. When
that happens, you just quietly pack up
your paraphernalia and move to another

town.
So let me summarize the game plan I
think you should follow to get yourself
started. Continue holding all those ral
lies in favor of free speech and autonomy
for the University; it's a great cover.
Meanwhile, start interviewing drug
runners; you're going to need some
dependable kids on your side. Don't open
up your Swiss bank account right away,
you should wait at least until people stop
writing letters in The Daily about you.
Once all the publicity has subsided, you
can embark on your new profession.
Good luck!
