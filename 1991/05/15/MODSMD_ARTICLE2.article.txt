# Fewer students taken from wait list
## 
### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Are earthquakes more frightening
than financial woes?
Perhaps scared off by the threat of
temblors, many of last year's prospec
tive freshmen decided against the Farm,
and many students on the wait list were
offered admission.
In contrast, this year's indirect-cost
controversy seems to have affected the
decisions of far fewer students; to date,
Stanford has only offered admission to
80 wait-listed students â€” less than half
last year's number.
The number taken from Stanford's
wait list alternates from year to year,
according to Jean Fetter, dean of under
graduate admissions. In her seven years
in this position, Fetter said wait list
offers have ranged from zero to 80 or 90
students in certain years to more than

200 students last year.
Stanford was not alone in underesti
mating the number of admission offers
that would be accepted this year. Yale
University, for example, has accepted
130 students from the wait list so far,
and may take more in a few weeks,
according to its admissions office. Duke
and Georgetown Universities have both
gone to their wait list, but have not yet
determined final figures.
On the other hand, MIT, Brown and
Princeton Universities have not
accepted anyone from their wait lists,
according to their admissions offices.
Despite a nationwide decrease in high
school graduates, the toted number of
Stanford applicants this year increased
4.5 percent from last year, to 13,528. Of
the pool of applicants, 19.5 percent
(2,639) were admitted - a slight decrease
from last year, when 20 percent of the
applicants were accepted.

The Admissions Office is aiming for a
freshman class of 1,525 students, said
Fetter. The office currently has "just
over" 1,500 students.
"We don't expect a 100 percent yield"
from the students accepted off the wait
list, Fetter added. "We hope we'll get 60
to 70 percent."
More students may be accepted from
the wait list in the coming weeks. The
Admissions Office is still waiting to hear
from about 110 people who were sup
posed to have sent in their enrollment
information by May 10.
Fetter added that Stanford will have
to "over-enroll," as it usually does. The
University will probably lose 25 to 30
students due to "summer melt," she
said. "Summer melt" is the Admissions
Office's term for the loss of admitted
students who choose during the sum
mer not to enroll for various reasons.
