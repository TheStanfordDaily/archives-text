## Researchers investigate infant deaths Study searches for clues about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
What is normal?
That's the question pediatric researchers
at the Medical School are trying to answer
about the development of circadian rhythms
in infants and the relationship of these
rhythms to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
(SIDS).
Despite many years of research, SIDS is
still as mysterious as it is devastating. Each
year, 7,000 to 10,000 seemingly healthy
babies die in their sleep, without apparent
cause or explanation. SIDS is the leading
cause of death for children between the ages
of 1 month and 1 year, and is 10 times more
prevalent among premature infants.
The Pediatric SIDS Research Program at
Stanford is embarking on an in-home study
which will use microprocessors to record the
vital signs of full-term infants. Normal
babies will be studied for three continuous
days at the age of 1 month and again at the
age of 3 months. The project is the first SIDS
study to examine healthy infants in their
homes for extended periods of time.
"To understand SIDS abnormalities, we
must first understand the normal physiology

in the infant," said Margaret Boeddiker,
R.N., one of the coordinators of the project.
"Almost no information is available on the
development of circadian rhythms in normal
full-term infants."
Circadian rhythms are biological cycles
approximately 24 hours in length. Uncover
ing the mechanisms underlying the forma
tion of these rhythms would be of immense
importance in detecting, treating and pre
venting disease, according to many chrono
biologists.
"Our interest is in the influence of envi
ronmental patterns on sleep, growth and
feeding in early infancy, and in detecting cor
relations between environmental factors
that retard development of rhythmicity and
increase the risk of SIDS," explained Boed
diker.
To that end, the biological rhythms
underlying sleep and wakefulness, tempera
ture fluctuation, hormone secretion and
metabolic activity will be examined.
Ten healthy, full-term infants and their
parents are currently being recruited to par
ticipate in the study, and the first study is
scheduled to begin at the end of this month.
Infants will be monitored at home by a Vita
log microprocessor that will record heart
rate, abdominal skin temperature, activity

and core body temperature.
"All of these monitoring methods have
been used clinically for many years and are
very safe," said Boeddiker. "The tape we use
to attach the sensors is the most uncomfort
able part."
Sleep and its influence on the infants'
thermoregulation is of central interest to the
study, as very little is currently known about
the interaction of sleep and thermal control
in newborn infants.
The work of Dr. Ronald Ariagno, profes
sor of pediatrics and Dr. Steven Glotzbach,
senior research scientist, suggests that SIDS
may be a manifestation of impaired ther
moregulatory capabilities which fail during
sleep.
Newborns spend nearly 80 percent of
their time sleeping, of which 30 to 60 percent
is Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, or
active sleep. It is known that in adults, ther
moregulation and sweating is inhibited dur
ing REM sleep. In addition, REM sleep is
associated with increased incidents of apnea
(periods of breathing cessation) and reduced
central respiratory chemosensitivity (sensi
tivity to changes in blood oxygen that cause
one to breath automatically).
Working together, these factors
may be very dangerous to a heav
ily clothed infant during REM
sleep in a warm room. Learning
how normal babies physiologi
cally cope with these factors may
elucidate the mechanisms which
are thought to fail in the case of
SIDS.
"We wish to emphasize that
the purpose of our study is to
develop a clear understanding of
the development of circadian
rhythms in normal infants, and
then to contrast this information
with infants who develop prob

lems," said Boeddiker.
For the past several years,
Ariagno and Glotzbach's efforts
have focused on the development
of premature infants' biological
rhythms in the hospital neonatal
intensive care environment. Con
trasting their new work with nor
mal infants to their previous
work with premature infants may
pinpoint key differences that sug
gest causes of SIDS.
Learning more about the cop
ing mechanisms of normal
infants through their in-home
study may lead Ariagno and his
team to a greater understanding
of what goes wrong in SIDS vic
tims, and eventually to the devel
opment of a diagnostic test for the
disease.
