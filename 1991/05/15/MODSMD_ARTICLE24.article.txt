# Dish's long history includes research, rescue
## 
### Linda Chen Staff writer 
I remember the first time I saw the overwhelming
figure in the moonlight. My friends and I had hiked
up the steep trail to witness the majesty of the pop
ular site.
Looking up at the overwhelming machine sur
rounded by barbed wire and overgrown weeds, I
wondered about its capabilities. Like many other
members of the Stanford community, I was unaware
of the Dish's colorful history.
Built in 1962 for $750,000 by the U.S. govern
ment, the Dish is a 150-foot parabolic antenna
located in the Foothills near Stanford. Ever since
1962, Stanford Research Institute International has
been operating the Dish.
One of the Dish's original functions was gather
ing information about the ionosphere — the part of
the Earth's atmosphere that extends from 25 to 250
miles above its surface. The ionosphere contains
ions that reflect radio waves and make long-distance
radio communication possible. The Dish measured
the effects of Pacific Island nuclear blasts on the
ionosphere.
Relic or not, the Dish continues to be used three or
four times a year. In fact, the Dish rescued a British
satellite, UOSAT-OSCAR 9, in September 1982.
The British satellite had accidentally turned on
its transmitters and was blaring them so loudly that
it couldn't receive the transmission from Earth. The
Dish responded by bursting a powerful signal to
turn off the satellite's transmitters so that it could
once again respond to its masters.
Although the Dish is no longer among the most
powerful instruments of its kind, it has become a
Stanford landmark. This sleeping giant of the
Foothills serves a great purpose for Stanford stu
dents. Whether it be an early jog, a picnic lunch or a
midnight mountain biking trip, many will attest to
the sublime feeling the Dish arouses.

During its 30-year lifespan, the mysterious technological artifact known as the Dish
has performed functions that range from ionosphere research to satellite guidance.
