# Sex, lies and chocolate
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
Once upon a time, on a faraway
planet, a small, inconsequential
termite sat in the afternoon sun,
pondering the meaning of ply
wood and listening to James Tay
lor sing about a steamroller. She
thought about the line: "Oh I'm a
steamroller baby, I'm gonna roll
all over you."
She didn't think that it
sounded like something people
should be cheering about.
As she sat and listened, her
stomach grumbled. It was almost
time for dinner, and a nice chunk
of plywood sounded really good
right then.
Her gastrointestinal musings
were interrupted by a loud whin
ing, which at first she thought
was due to her Walkman, but
proved eventually to be a large
mosquito. The insect managed a
sloppy landing on a dandelion and
looked down his proboscis at her.
"I've got one word for you," he
said. "Chocolate."
The termite looked perplexed.
"I'm a termite," she said.
The mosquito rolled his eyes
(sure, they can do that — they're
just really small, so we never see
it) and made a sarcastic noise in
the back of his throat.
"Any other obvious facts you'd
be interested in sharing?" he
asked.
"I mean, I just eat wood," she
said, embarrassed. I don't even
know this guy, she thought. I bet
he's going to try to sell me maga
zines.
"And I just drank blood — until
I discovered chocolate."
"What's so great about choco
late?" the termite asked, wonder
ing as she said it if he was going to
roll his eyes again. She wished he
would go away. He reminded her
of Pinocchio, and that made her
stomach grumble louder.
The mosquito stumbled off the
dandelion and leaned noncha
lantly against a blade of grass.
"It's an aphrodisiac," he said in a
stage whisper, as if anyone else
were listening.
This time she rolled her eyes.
"Who told you that?" she
asked.
"Several reliable sources," he
said. Great, she thought, a
mosquito who's also a part-time
journalist.
"Sit down," she said, "and I'll
explain chocolate to you."
The mosquito sat and the ter
mite began pacing, which she
knew was a terrible public speak
ing technique but one that made
her think more clearly.
"A while back," she began,
"these two doctors at the New
York State Psychiatric Institute
proposed this theory about choco
late. They suggested that there
was an ingredient in chocolate
similar to a chemical found in the

brain of people who were in love or
otherwise feeling fine. This chem
ical, phenylethylamine, produces
an amphetamine-like high. Since
chocolate contains a lot of
phenylethylamine, these doctors
proposed that maybe people eat
chocolate because it makes them
feel like they're in love."
The mosquito, who had been
scratching a tic-tac-toe board on
the ground with his nose, looked
up.
"So it's true, then," he said
importantly.
"No, it's not true. These guys
weren't talking about chocolate
being a sexual stimulant — they
were talking about feeling like
you're in love. Typical of you
mosquitoes to confuse the two.
And stop pouting."
The termite climbed onto a
small stone and continued.
"No studies could ever confirm
this theory. In fact, one researcher
found that the levels of
phenylethylamine in the blood
didn't rise after people ate choco
late, and he decided that most of
the chemical is probably metabo
lized and never even makes it to
the brain.
"Chocolate is mildly addictive,
though," she said, as if to console
him. "It's the caffeine that makes
it so. Chocolate comes from cacao
bean's and was first consumed by
the Mava and Aztec Indians, who

drank it unsweetened and called it
'cacahuatl.' In the 1500s, Spanish
explorers added sugar to the drink
and the name changed to 'choco
latl.' Hernando Cortes called it
'the divine drink that builds up
resistance and fights fatigue' —
alluding to its caffeine content."
"He didn't say anything about
sex?" the mosquito asked, still
hopeful.
The termite laughed. "Not that
I know of."
"You seem to know a lot of
things," the mosquito said. "Do
you mind if I ask you one more
question?"
"Sorry," said the termite, "I'm
late for dinner."
She began walking away, but

the mosquito followed. "Do you
know why the Yankees are doing
so terribly?" he asked desperately,
waving his wings about him.
The termite paused for a
moment, took a deep breath, and
sighed.
"There are some things I don't
pretend to understand," she said
quietly. And as the sun set slowly
over the dandelion, the mosquito
and the termite parted ways, each
in awe of the mystery in the world
around them and Don Mattingly's
present inability to hit in the
clutch.

female mosquitoes drink blood, so

The termite climbed onto a
small stone and continued.

though," she said, as if to console
him. "It's the caffeine that makes
it so. Chocolate comes from cacao

"He didn't say anything about
sex?" the mosquito asked, still
hopeful.
The termite laughed. "Not that
I know of."
"You seem to know a lot of
things," the mosquito said. "Do
you mind if I ask you one more
question?"
"Sorry," said the termite, "I'm
late for dinner."
She began walking away, but

the mosquito followed. "Do you
know why the Yankees are doing
so terribly?" he asked desperately,
waving his wings about him.
The termite paused for a
moment, took a deep breath, and
sighed.
"There are some things I don't
pretend to understand," she said
quietly. And as the sun set slowly
over the dandelion, the mosquito
and the termite parted ways, each
in awe of the mystery in the world

Once upon a time, on a faraway
planet, a small, inconsequential
termite sat in the afternoon sun,
pondering the meaning of ply
wood and listening to James Tay
lor sing about a steamroller. She
thought about the line: "Oh I'm a
steamroller baby, I'm gonna roll
all over you."
She didn't think that it
sounded like something people
should be cheering about.
As she sat and listened, her
stomach grumbled. It was almost
time for dinner, and a nice chunk
of plywood sounded really good
right then.
Her gastrointestinal musings
were interrupted by a loud whin
ing, which at first she thought
was due to her Walkman, but
proved eventually to be a large
mosquito. The insect managed a
sloppy landing on a dandelion and
looked down his proboscis at her.
"I've got one word for you," he
said. "Chocolate."
The termite looked perplexed.
"I'm a termite," she said.
The mosquito rolled his eyes
(sure, they can do that — they're
just really small, so we never see
it) and made a sarcastic noise in
the back of his throat.
"Any other obvious facts you'd
be interested in sharing?" he
asked.
"I mean, I just eat wood," she
said, embarrassed. I don't even
know this guy, she thought. I bet
he's going to try to sell me maga
zines.
"And I just drank blood — until
I discovered chocolate."
"What's so great about choco
late?" the termite asked, wonder
ing as she said it if he was going to
roll his eyes again. She wished he
would go away. He reminded her
of Pinocchio, and that made her
stomach grumble louder.
The mosquito stumbled off the
dandelion and leaned noncha
lantly against a blade of grass.
"It's an aphrodisiac," he said in a
stage whisper, as if anyone else
were listening.
This time she rolled her eyes.
"Who told you that?" she
asked.
"Several reliable sources," he
said. Great, she thought, a
mosquito who's also a part-time
journalist.
"Sit down," she said, "and I'll
explain chocolate to you."
The mosquito sat and the ter
mite began pacing, which she
knew was a terrible public speak
ing technique but one that made
her think more clearly.
"A while back," she began,
"these two doctors at the New
York State Psychiatric Institute
proposed this theory about choco
late. They suggested that there
was an ingredient in chocolate
similar to a chemical found in the

otherwise feeling fine. This chem
ical, phenylethylamine, produces
an amphetamine-like high. Since
chocolate contains a lot of
phenylethylamine, these doctors
proposed that maybe people eat
chocolate because it makes them
feel like they're in love."
The mosquito, who had been
scratching a tic-tac-toe board on
the ground with his nose, looked
up.
"So it's true, then," he said
importantly.
"No, it's not true. These guys
weren't talking about chocolate
being a sexual stimulant — they
were talking about feeling like
you're in love. Typical of you
