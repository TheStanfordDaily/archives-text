# Whether — and how — to upgade to System 7
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It's here. A year late and a dollar short of
the original plan, System 7.0 is out, available
and, by all accounts, working pretty well.
Apple CEO John Sculley thinks so much
of the new software, he said, "We feel more
confident about this release than any other
product we've ever shipped."
Exactly what those words mean is uncer
tain, but they seem to suggest Apple is not
planning on System 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and 7.0.3 in
the immediate future. When System 6.0 was
first released, it was nowhere near as major
an update as System 7.0. Yet it took three
bug fixes, including one update that lasted
just a few weeks before being superseded, to
finally get it right.
This time it won't be up to Apple; it'll be
the responsibility of everyone else — i.e., the
software companies. Applications and utili
ties that do not function under System 7.0
will need to be upgraded and, often, you'll
end up paying for the privilege.
Most of the thorny compatibility problems
will come with control-panel devices, INITs
and so forth. The average application, on the
other hand, will run without crashing.
Right now, the average user's biggest
problem is this: If my machine has the nec
essary hardware to allow me to upgrade,
when is the best time to do it?
One of the easiest ways to determine that
answer is to format a spare hard drive with
System 7.0, attach it to your Mac, copy over

all your applications and try
to run them. If everything you
use runs, you may as well go
ahead and upgrade — if you
just have to have it now.
Of course, most of use don't
have spare hard drives lying
about on our bookshelves. In
the likely event that you don't,
one option is to buy one. For
under $400, you can get a 100-
megabyte drive with a Quan
tum mechanism and two-year warranty
through many mail order houses, including
Alliance Peripheral System (1-800-233-7550)
and ClubMac (1-800-258-2622).
Do that and you'll have a backup drive,
extra storage space or whatever — as well as
a place to run System 7.0 in the meantime.
Why the fuss about the separate drive? If
things you use don't run under System 7.0,
and your hard disk is running under 6.0.5,
you won't be able to use those programs.
The biggest stumbling block toward pain
less upgrading is that some of the incompat
ible software doesn't yet have 7.0-ready
replacements. Quick Mail, for instance, the
premier electronic-mail product, won't be
compatible until version 2.5 comes out this
summer.
Back to the hard disk question for a
minute. Assuming you cannot get another
mass-storage device and still want 7.0, there
is an alternative. An application called the
Compatibility Checker, provided by Apple,
will make a determination of what works on

your hard disk with System
7.0 and what does not.
It's not a bulletproof
method. All sorts of shareware
and public domain software is
not covered by Compatibility
Checker, but it may be good
enough nonetheless. Assum
ing most everything passes —
and you hide or delete the
stuff that won't work so you
avoid nasty crashes — you can

pop in the installer and go.
Should things blow up on you, however,
don't come calling here. The only recom
mendation I can give about the upgrade
your-existing-hard-disk method is that a
number of the beta testers on campus have
been running 7.0 for several months without
reporting a too many unusual incidents.
For those of you who are reading this and
wondering why I keep talking about hard
disks, the reason is that you can't do System
7.0 without one. Not only does your Mac
need two megabytes of memory, but you
must also have a hard drive.
System 7.0 takes up about 4 megabytes of
disk space all by itself. It's not so big that it
will chew up too much of your standard 40-
meg drive.
Stop by MacFest today at Maples Pavilion,
stop by Microdisc in the Bookstore, stop by a
friend's room and check out 7.0. The gee
whiz factor is very high and seeing the soft
ware in action will help you determine what
you need right now.
