## Birch, Graham reach quarters; doubles teams cruise 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
For the first time ever, this
year's NCAA singles fielu includes
' tw o returning champions. After
three rounds of competition, both
are still alive and just two wins
a way from earning spots opposite
one another in tomorrow night's
final.
Intriguing enough, yet? Well
consider this: Not only are Sandra
Birch and Debbie Graham the No.
1 and 2 seeds in the tournament,
they are teammates and doubles

partners as well.
Birch, who might not even be
playing in the championships
were it not for a rain delay Mon
day that allowed her five extra
hours to recuperate from stomach
trouble, looked like her old self
yesterday. She opened play by
closing out Florida's Jillian
Alexander 7-5, 6-4 in the comple
tion of a match suspended Mon
day due to the rain.
Her next opponent was San
Diego's Tonya Fuller, one of the 9-
16 seeds who are placed alphabet
ically in the draw. Fuller was good

enough to take just one game
from Birch, falling 6-0, 6-1.
Graham's suspended match
against Cara Abe of California
was tied just 1-1 so she essentially
had to play two complete rounds
of singles. Abe succumbed fairly
quietly by a score of 6-1, 6-2.
Duke's Susan Sabo then went
down just as meekly, 6-1, 6-1.
"It was a very good day for
me," said Graham, who also won
two doubles matches with Birch.
"Yesterday, I kind of got off to a
bad start. I didn't know when to
eat, when to warm up" because
the rain wrought havoc with the
schedule.
"I came out today ready to
play," she said. "In my second
match, I was really fired up to play
her." Graham used that positive
energy to attack the net early and
often. She ended points quickly
and looked very sharp in the pro
cess.
Stanford's other two singles
representatives didn't fare as well.
Heather Willens and Teri
Whitlinger were both knocked out
of the draw by powerful oppo
nents.
Willens' loss, though, was not
one she has any reason to be
ashamed of. Florida's Andrea Far
ley defeated her 6-4,4-6, 6-3 in the
third round, ending a brilliant
sophomore season for the rising
Stanford star.
She said she was "very pleased"
with her showing. "What's not to
be pleased about?" A good ques
tion indeed. Consider that one
year ago, Willens faced the Lady
Gators' Amy Alcini in the team
final, playing at No. 6 singles.
This season, she jumped up to
No. 4, cracked the top 20 in the
rankings, earned All-America
honors and took Farley — one of
the nation's best players — to
three sets before finally losing.
Not bad.
"It's a great feeling," Willens
said of the season. "It's almost
better than coming in and having
everyone expect you to do that."
And it almost didn't end yester
day. She got down 4-1 in the first
set and came back to tie it before
losing 6-4.
In the end, Farley was able to
get the opening two games of the
third set and use fresher legs to
finally put Willens away. Willens
said the early comeback may have
sapped her energy a bit. "[Fight

ing back] is the most tiring thing
to do," she said.
If nothing else, she earned Far
ley's respect. "Heather played
really well today," Farley said.
"She made some really great
shots." Including among those
were several devastating serve
returns from the backhand side
that eventually led Farley to
change her serve pattern.
Midway through the third set,
she began to spin all her first
serves in to make sure she could
get them to Willens' forehand.
That, plus Farley's extra spring,
made the difference. "Even
though I had already played one
match," Farley said, "she was the
one getting tired. I saw her kind of
leaning over to get her breath."
Whitlinger picked up her sus
pended match down a set to
Miami's Melissa Mazzotta, the
surprise of the tournament so far.
The Hurricane baseliner has been
causing quite a storm with her
devastating two-handed ground
strokes and eventually blew
Whitlinger out of the field 6-2, 6-
3. Mazzotta continued her impres
sive run by defeating Florida's
Nicole Arendt, the tournament's
third seed, 6-4, 6-3.
Stanford's four-time All-Amer

ican nearly saw her college career
come to a close just a few hours
later when she and freshman
Laxmi Poruri wound up in a tight
doubles match with William &
Mary's Kristine Kurth and Jane
Wood.
Poruri and Whitlinger won the
first set 6-3 and dropped the sec
ond 2-6. The third see-sawed
before winding up in a tiebreak,
which the Stanford pair won eas
ily, 7-3.
In the second round, they
squared off with Paula Iverson
and Mariette Verbruggen of
Miami. Quickly, Poruri and
Whitlinger were up 5-0. Then the
roof caved in.
They dropped six games in a
row before finally winning the set
in a tiebreak 7-5. They then
cruised 6-1 in the second set to
advance into the quarters.
"We played good at the right
time," Poruri said of the team's
success despite some struggles.
On squandering the 5-0 lead, and
almost the set, she added: "We
have a tendency to do that, which
we have to work on — soon."
Poruri explained that when
they get into troubles they "go
back to the basics .. . play a differ
ent pattern." Usually it works, as

it did yesterday. As for the future?
"We can definitely make a.'
run," Poruri said. "We have to'
make sure our heads are in place.
If both of us are really psyched. . .
That's a big if with Whitlinger
out of the singles and soon out of
Stanford. Poruri is working to be'
the enthusiastic freshman. "I'm
trying to get her pumped up;
that's all I can do," she said.
Whitlinger won the doubles in
1990 with Meredith McGrath and
will probably be ready to go today.
Equally ready are Birch and
Graham, who have lost in the
finals two straight years. Birch
and Graham crushed Cal's Lisa
Albano and Tiffinv Silveria 6-1,6-
3 in the first round and blasted
Fuller and Julie McKeon of San
Diego 7-5, 6-1.

On the day, Graham played an
unbelievable eight sets of tennis.
Birch played seven. Neither lost one.

from Birch, falling 6-0, 6-1.
Graham's suspended match
against Cara Abe of California
was tied just 1-1 so she essentially
had to play two complete rounds
of singles. Abe succumbed fairly
quietly by a score of 6-1, 6-2.
Duke's Susan Sabo then went
down just as meekly, 6-1, 6-1.
"It was a very good day for
me," said Graham, who also won
two doubles matches with Birch.
"Yesterday, I kind of got off to a
bad start. I didn't know when to
eat, when to warm up" because
the rain wrought havoc with the
schedule.
"I came out today ready to
play," she said. "In my second
match, I was really fired up to play
her." Graham used that positive
energy to attack the net early and
often. She ended points quickly
and looked very sharp in the pro
cess.
Stanford's other two singles
representatives didn't fare as well.
Heather Willens and Teri
Whitlinger were both knocked out
of the draw by powerful oppo
nents.
Willens' loss, though, was not
one she has any reason to be
ashamed of. Florida's Andrea Far
ley defeated her 6-4,4-6, 6-3 in the
third round, ending a brilliant
sophomore season for the rising
Stanford star.
She said she was "very pleased"
with her showing. "What's not to
be pleased about?" A good ques
tion indeed. Consider that one
year ago, Willens faced the Lady
Gators' Amy Alcini in the team
final, playing at No. 6 singles.
This season, she jumped up to
No. 4, cracked the top 20 in the
rankings, earned All-America
honors and took Farley — one of
the nation's best players — to
three sets before finally losing.
Not bad.
"It's a great feeling," Willens
said of the season. "It's almost
better than coming in and having
everyone expect you to do that."
And it almost didn't end yester
day. She got down 4-1 in the first
set and came back to tie it before
losing 6-4.
In the end, Farley was able to
get the opening two games of the
third set and use fresher legs to
finally put Willens away. Willens
said the early comeback may have
sapped her energy a bit. "[Fight

ing back] is the most tiring thing
to do," she said.
If nothing else, she earned Far
ley's respect. "Heather played
really well today," Farley said.
"She made some really great
shots." Including among those
were several devastating serve
returns from the backhand side
that eventually led Farley to
change her serve pattern.
Midway through the third set,
she began to spin all her first
serves in to make sure she could
get them to Willens' forehand.
That, plus Farley's extra spring,
made the difference. "Even
though I had already played one
match," Farley said, "she was the
one getting tired. I saw her kind of
leaning over to get her breath."
Whitlinger picked up her sus
pended match down a set to
Miami's Melissa Mazzotta, the
surprise of the tournament so far.
The Hurricane baseliner has been
causing quite a storm with her
devastating two-handed ground
strokes and eventually blew
Whitlinger out of the field 6-2, 6-
3. Mazzotta continued her impres
sive run by defeating Florida's
Nicole Arendt, the tournament's
third seed, 6-4, 6-3.
Stanford's four-time All-Amer

ican nearly saw her college career
come to a close just a few hours
later when she and freshman
Laxmi Poruri wound up in a tight
doubles match with William &
Mary's Kristine Kurth and Jane
Wood.
Poruri and Whitlinger won the
first set 6-3 and dropped the sec
ond 2-6. The third see-sawed
before winding up in a tiebreak,
which the Stanford pair won eas
ily, 7-3.
In the second round, they
squared off with Paula Iverson
and Mariette Verbruggen of
Miami. Quickly, Poruri and
Whitlinger were up 5-0. Then the
roof caved in.
They dropped six games in a
row before finally winning the set
in a tiebreak 7-5. They then
cruised 6-1 in the second set to
advance into the quarters.
"We played good at the right
time," Poruri said of the team's
success despite some struggles.
On squandering the 5-0 lead, and
almost the set, she added: "We
have a tendency to do that, which
we have to work on — soon."
Poruri explained that when
they get into troubles they "go
back to the basics .. . play a differ
ent pattern." Usually it works, as

it did yesterday. As for the future?
"We can definitely make a.'
run," Poruri said. "We have to'
make sure our heads are in place.
If both of us are really psyched. . .
That's a big if with Whitlinger
out of the singles and soon out of
Stanford. Poruri is working to be'
the enthusiastic freshman. "I'm
trying to get her pumped up;
that's all I can do," she said.
Whitlinger won the doubles in
1990 with Meredith McGrath and
will probably be ready to go today.
Equally ready are Birch and
Graham, who have lost in the
finals two straight years. Birch
and Graham crushed Cal's Lisa
Albano and Tiffinv Silveria 6-1,6-
3 in the first round and blasted
Fuller and Julie McKeon of San
Diego 7-5, 6-1.

Yesterday Debbie Graham played four sets of singles and four sets of doubles at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. The defending NCAA singles champion backed up the quantity of her tennis with quality, win
ning all eight sets to advance to the quarterfinals in both singles and doubles.
For the first time ever, this
year's NCAA singles fielu includes
' tw o returning champions. After
three rounds of competition, both
are still alive and just two wins
a way from earning spots opposite
one another in tomorrow night's
final.
Intriguing enough, yet? Well
consider this: Not only are Sandra
Birch and Debbie Graham the No.
1 and 2 seeds in the tournament,
they are teammates and doubles

partners as well.
Birch, who might not even be
playing in the championships
were it not for a rain delay Mon
day that allowed her five extra
hours to recuperate from stomach
trouble, looked like her old self
yesterday. She opened play by
closing out Florida's Jillian
Alexander 7-5, 6-4 in the comple
tion of a match suspended Mon
day due to the rain.
Her next opponent was San
Diego's Tonya Fuller, one of the 9-
16 seeds who are placed alphabet
ically in the draw. Fuller was good

enough to take just one game
from Birch, falling 6-0, 6-1.
