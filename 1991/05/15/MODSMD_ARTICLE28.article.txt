# Stanford stars on collision course
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Eight singles players and
eight doubles teams remain in
the hunt for NCAA individual
titles. By the time the day is
done, only two will be left in
singles and just four in dou
bles. The following is a viewer's
guide to just who they might
be.
Stanford's Debbie Graham,
the No. 2 seed, squares off
against Ole Miss' Paloma Col
lantes with the winner meeting
either Lisa Albano of Califor
nia or the tournament's
biggest surprise, Miami's
Melissa Mazzotta. Of the eight
players left, Mazzotta is the
only one who was not seeded.
Graham is looking strong
right now, and her superb con
ditioning should allow her to
withstand the rigors of playing
both singles and doubles. Only
she and No. 1 seed Sandra
Birch remain in both draws.
Mazzotta is crushing the
ball right now, but don't count
out Albano. The Golden Bear
junior is a heady player, and, if
she can figure out how to move
Mazzotta in and out instead of
side to side, Albano could hold
her off.
At the Riviera Ail-American
last October, Graham thrashed
Collantes 6-0, 6-1 so she enters
the match with some confi
dence. Graham is quite famil
iar with Mazzotta, having also
beaten her over the summer.
Birch faces Kansas' Eveline
Hamers, a semifinalist from

1990. With her strength back,
Birch should be too much for
the Jayhawk. Should she win,
however, Birch would meet
either Georgia's Shannan
McCarthy or Florida's Andrea
Farley.
McCarthy and Farley pro
vide a delightful contrast in
styles. McCarthy serves and
volleys like she means it while
Farley lives to pound from the
baseline. This season, each has
become somewhat more profi
cient at playing the other's
game.
In a dual match in March,
Birch cruised past McCarthy 6-
2, 6-2. Saturday, in NCAA team
competition, McCarthy
defeated Birch, who had to
default with stomach trouble.
Farley and Birch have not met
this season.
The doubles tournament
also has the potential to pro
duce two Stanford finalists.
Teri Whitlinger and Laxmi
Poruri meet San Diego State's
Dorey Brandt and Nicole
Storto, a team they destroyed
6-3, 6-2 on Feb. 15.
If they advance, they will
face either UCLA's Kimberly
Po and Stella Sampras or
Texas' Susan Gilchrist and
Joanna Plautz. The Bruin tan
dem's strength is fundamental
doubles play, the Texas pair is
pure power.
Birch and Graham, twice
the bridesmaid in this event,
are looking to go out as
champs. To get there, they
