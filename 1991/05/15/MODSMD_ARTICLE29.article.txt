# Not your average back-up backstop
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Bryan Taylor's desk is littered
with post-its. The little yellow
squares are lined up on the left
side of his desk all crammed with
names and numbers and dates.
Up and down the desk the colored
scraps go in two neat little rows.
They are the numbered items of
business that make up the life of
the Stanford catcher. Everything
is important and eveiything will
get done. Bryan Taylor is a busy
guy and he likes it that way.

"I'm happy when my back is to
the wall and I have 100 things to
do and not enough time to do it,
but then the week ends, and I do it
all and do it well," said Taylor.
"It's almost a high sometimes."
Bryan Taylor is probably the
busiest athlete that nobody
knows. As Stanford's third-string
catcher, Taylor has labored away
tirelessly for three years in the
bullpen waiting for his chance on
the field, all the while never miss
ing one outside it.
Last year Taylor was a recepi
ent of the prestigious Truman

Scholarship, given to award aca
demic excellence, leadership and
proven commitment to public ser
vice. The same spring he was
selected president of Stanford's
chapter of the national children's
rights group Children Now. As a
junior he will be eligible to gradu
ate this spring, and has only got
ten two B's in his entire career on
the Farm. In Bryan Taylor's life
there is always something to do,
always a task to be completed and
he does it all while practicing six
hours a day, five days a week,
while never really playing.
Bryan Taylor has been up to
bat twice in three years, and yet
he still keeps coming back day
after day while at home the post
its wait and grow. It brings up the
question almost everybody out
side the team wonders.
Why?
"There are three reasons," said
the Bakersfield, Calif, native.
"One, I've known exactly what is
expected of me each year, and I'm
willing to give everything for the
team. Two, I absolutely love base
ball and can't imagine not playing;
and three, there is a chance. There
is always a shot."
Entering Stanford in the same
class as Troy Tallman, the Cardi
nal's talented starting catcher,
Taylor was immediatly relegated
to a position of role player. In the
bullpen, the catcher is up and
down as many as three or four
times an inning warming up
pitchers. Spending practice after
practice receiving balls, the man
behind the plate gets to know the
pitches and becomes a surrogate
coach. Fans never see all the little
things, and the only people who
care are the ones to whom it mat
fprq mOQt
"There is no doubt that BT is
valuable," said pitcher Andrew
Lorraine. "There are times when I
am struggling, and he knows what
is going on."
"Bryan is not just a human
backboard," pitching coach Tom
Dunton said. "He analyzes things
with pitchers and really helps
them out. A bullpen catcher is a
thankless job, but very necessary."
There is a certain amount of
respect for Bryan Taylor among
the people with whom he spends
his afternoon. Baseball players
like to consider themselves some
of the busiest athletes on campus,

Tm happy when my
back is to the wall
and I have 100 things
to do and not enough
time to do it, but then
the week ends and I
do it all and do it
well.'

and with daily marathon practices
and the possibility for 70 games in
a season that stretches from Jan
uary to June, they have a good
argument. Playing baseball being
and a student is hard. All the play
ers do it, but Bryan Taylor excels.
"It is pretty incredible what he
does," said teammate Mark
Skeels. "The role he has is not a
good one, and he has kept with it.
Most guys would quit after a year
or two. I admire him; he is a dedi
cated person."
Many things float in Taylor's
head, decisions have to be made
and things have to be cared for. He
is a complex person who will
travel to Japan this summer to
research his honors thesis. He has
entitled it "A comparative analysis
of the healthcare cost-control and
delivery systems of three industri
alized countries: England, Japan
and the United States."
"I have an intense drive," said
Taylor. "You see (David) McCartv
or Tallman strike out and they are
so pissed. They are so intense
about suceeding, and I try to do
the same thing about school. I
really thrive on learning."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
knows Talor is smart, but admits
that book smarts does not always
translate on the field. Taylor, how
ever, is an exception.
"Bryan is an intelligent base
ball guy; he is a real student of the
game," Marquess said. "He is real
important. You just don't know
what can happen — he can get his
chance."
Stanford did not get any catch
ing recruits this year, and Tallman
may go pro next year. The future
is blurry, yet still bright. Nineteen
ninety-two could hold the playing
time Taylor has been waiting for,
but even without it, his time at
Stanford has been full of success.
His desk will tell you that.

the people with whom he spends
his afternoon. Baseball players
like to consider themselves some
of the busiest athletes on campus,

Tm happy when my
back is to the wall
and I have 100 things
to do and not enough
time to do it, but then
the week ends and I
do it all and do it
well.'

and with daily marathon practices
and the possibility for 70 games in
a season that stretches from Jan
uary to June, they have a good
argument. Playing baseball being
and a student is hard. All the play
ers do it, but Bryan Taylor excels.
"It is pretty incredible what he
does," said teammate Mark
Skeels. "The role he has is not a
good one, and he has kept with it.
Most guys would quit after a year
or two. I admire him; he is a dedi
cated person."
Many things float in Taylor's
head, decisions have to be made
and things have to be cared for. He
is a complex person who will
travel to Japan this summer to
research his honors thesis. He has
entitled it "A comparative analysis
of the healthcare cost-control and
delivery systems of three industri
alized countries: England, Japan
and the United States."
"I have an intense drive," said
Taylor. "You see (David) McCartv
or Tallman strike out and they are
so pissed. They are so intense
about suceeding, and I try to do
the same thing about school. I
really thrive on learning."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
knows Talor is smart, but admits
that book smarts does not always
translate on the field. Taylor, how
ever, is an exception.
"Bryan is an intelligent base
ball guy; he is a real student of the
game," Marquess said. "He is real
important. You just don't know
what can happen — he can get his
chance."
Stanford did not get any catch
ing recruits this year, and Tallman
may go pro next year. The future
is blurry, yet still bright. Nineteen
ninety-two could hold the playing
time Taylor has been waiting for,
but even without it, his time at
Stanford has been full of success.
His desk will tell you that.

Catcher Bryan Taylor Is not always busy on the baseball field as he
plays behind Troy Tallman, a member of the U.S. National team. Off
the field, however, the true scholar-athlete juggles a vast number of
other activities along with the demands required of a collegiate ath
lete on a nationally-ranked team.
Bryan Taylor's desk is littered
with post-its. The little yellow
squares are lined up on the left
side of his desk all crammed with
names and numbers and dates.
Up and down the desk the colored
scraps go in two neat little rows.
They are the numbered items of
business that make up the life of
the Stanford catcher. Everything
is important and eveiything will
get done. Bryan Taylor is a busy
guy and he likes it that way.

"I'm happy when my back is to
the wall and I have 100 things to
do and not enough time to do it,
but then the week ends, and I do it
all and do it well," said Taylor.
"It's almost a high sometimes."
Bryan Taylor is probably the
busiest athlete that nobody
knows. As Stanford's third-string
catcher, Taylor has labored away
tirelessly for three years in the
bullpen waiting for his chance on
the field, all the while never miss
ing one outside it.
Last year Taylor was a recepi
ent of the prestigious Truman

Scholarship, given to award aca
demic excellence, leadership and
proven commitment to public ser
vice. The same spring he was
selected president of Stanford's
chapter of the national children's
rights group Children Now. As a
junior he will be eligible to gradu
ate this spring, and has only got
ten two B's in his entire career on
the Farm. In Bryan Taylor's life
there is always something to do,
always a task to be completed and
he does it all while practicing six
hours a day, five days a week,
while never really playing.
Bryan Taylor has been up to
bat twice in three years, and yet
he still keeps coming back day
after day while at home the post
its wait and grow. It brings up the
question almost everybody out
side the team wonders.
Why?
"There are three reasons," said
the Bakersfield, Calif, native.
"One, I've known exactly what is
expected of me each year, and I'm
willing to give everything for the
team. Two, I absolutely love base
ball and can't imagine not playing;
and three, there is a chance. There
is always a shot."
Entering Stanford in the same
class as Troy Tallman, the Cardi
nal's talented starting catcher,
Taylor was immediatly relegated
to a position of role player. In the
bullpen, the catcher is up and
down as many as three or four
times an inning warming up
pitchers. Spending practice after
practice receiving balls, the man
behind the plate gets to know the
pitches and becomes a surrogate
coach. Fans never see all the little
things, and the only people who
care are the ones to whom it mat
fprq mOQt
"There is no doubt that BT is
valuable," said pitcher Andrew
Lorraine. "There are times when I
am struggling, and he knows what
is going on."
"Bryan is not just a human
backboard," pitching coach Tom
Dunton said. "He analyzes things
with pitchers and really helps
them out. A bullpen catcher is a
thankless job, but very necessary."
