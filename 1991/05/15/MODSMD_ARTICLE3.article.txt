# Navy regulator:
## 'Significant likelihood' of criminal wrongdoing 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Rough-and-tumble Navy regulator Paul
Biddle is channeling his energy in a new
direction: providing documentation to a
congressional subcommittee on what he
believes are numerous instances of criminal

wrongdoing by Stanford
and Navy officials during
the last decade.
Biddle is the Office of
Naval Research represen
tative whose allegations of
massive overcharging by
Stanford triggered the
events leading to last
month's dramatic drop in
the University's indirect-

cost rate. Stanford is confronting a finan
cial crisis and severe budget cuts as a result
of the reduction in funds it receives for fed
erally sponsored research.
Yesterday Biddle contacted several mem
bers of the local press, informing them he
had begun documenting instances of "civil
and criminal wrongdoing" related to Stan
ford's past indirect-cost claims. He said he
would soon provide the information to staff
members of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.
The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John

Dingell, D-Mich., castigated Stanford offi
cials for irresponsible management of fed
eral research funds during a grueling,
seven-hour hearing in mid-March. At the
hearing, Dingell said recent findings by fed
eral auditors raised a "serious question as
to criminal liability."
University President Donald Kennedy

countered at the hearing
that he was concerned
about "loose implications"
of criminal activity on the
part of Stanford officials.
Biddle would not detail
any specific allegations of
wrongdoing during an
interview yesterday. Eiut
he said he believes there is
"a quite significant likeli-

hood" that Stanford officials had engaged
in "criminal and civil wrongdoing."
"We're not dealing with evil people," Bid
die said. "If anything, we're dealing with
people who had a lapse in accountability."
University Counsel Debra Zumwalt said
she is confident there has been no wrongdo
ing by Stanford administrators. "That's my
belief â€” that there's nothing to find," she
said. "I don't know what he's looking at."
Biddle said he had been instructed by
