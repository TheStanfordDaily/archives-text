# Navy regulator:
## 'Significant likelihood' of criminal wrongdoing 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Rough-and-tumble Navy regulator Paul
Biddle is channeling his energy in a new
direction: providing documentation to a
congressional subcommittee on what he
believes are numerous instances of criminal

wrongdoing by Stanford
and Navy officials during
the last decade.
Biddle is the Office of
Naval Research represen
tative whose allegations of
massive overcharging by
Stanford triggered the
events leading to last
month's dramatic drop in
the University's indirect-

cost rate. Stanford is confronting a finan
cial crisis and severe budget cuts as a result
of the reduction in funds it receives for fed
erally sponsored research.
Yesterday Biddle contacted several mem
bers of the local press, informing them he
had begun documenting instances of "civil
and criminal wrongdoing" related to Stan
ford's past indirect-cost claims. He said he
would soon provide the information to staff
members of the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.
The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John

Dingell, D-Mich., castigated Stanford offi
cials for irresponsible management of fed
eral research funds during a grueling,
seven-hour hearing in mid-March. At the
hearing, Dingell said recent findings by fed
eral auditors raised a "serious question as
to criminal liability."
University President Donald Kennedy

countered at the hearing
that he was concerned
about "loose implications"
of criminal activity on the
part of Stanford officials.
Biddle would not detail
any specific allegations of
wrongdoing during an
interview yesterday. Eiut
he said he believes there is
"a quite significant likeli-

hood" that Stanford officials had engaged
in "criminal and civil wrongdoing."
"We're not dealing with evil people," Bid
die said. "If anything, we're dealing with
people who had a lapse in accountability."
University Counsel Debra Zumwalt said
she is confident there has been no wrongdo
ing by Stanford administrators. "That's my
belief — that there's nothing to find," she
said. "I don't know what he's looking at."
Biddle said he had been instructed by


Biddle


Dingell
Navy officials not to speculate on
whether or not Office of Naval
Research employees had commit
ted any criminal offenses.
Yesterday wasn't the first time
Biddle has made such allegations.
In a 27-page letter sent to the
Inspector General of the Office of
Naval Research last fall, Biddle
claimed there was "the likelihood
of criminal conspiracy, criminal
acts, civil violations and ethics
infractions" resulting from a

"cozy" relationship between
Stanford and Office of Naval
Research officials prior to his
arrival in October 1988.
Biddle has alleged that the
tight relationship allowed Stan
ford to recover more than $200
million more in indirect costs
than it was entitled to.
Representatives of the naval
office "made and recommended
expenditures of funds known or
believed to be in violation of U.S.
law," Biddle wrote last fall.
That letter apparently
prompted an investigation by the
Naval Investigative Service. That
probe, which began in late Jan

uary, is still ongoing.
Biddle said yesterday that his
present efforts at documenting
wrongdoing were prompted by
Dingell's comments and lines of
questioning at the March hearing
on Stanford.
At the hearing, Dingell repeat
edly asked several federal audi
tors if they believed Stanford had
committed fraud by including
unallowable and inappropriate
charges in its indirect cost billings
to the government. The witnesses
were critical of Stanford, but all
stopped short of characterizing
the University's actions as
"fraud."

Biddle said he had subse
quently contacted staff members
of Dingell's subcommittee, volun
teering to document instances of
criminal wrongdoing.
"Dingell's staff indicated they
would welcome such information
from my office," Biddle said. He
said the staff members were
"appreciative, highly interested
and anxious to be in receipt of any
information that would disclose
adverse impact on the taxpayer."

handling the indirect-cost investi
gations were out of the country
yesterday unavailable for com
ment.
