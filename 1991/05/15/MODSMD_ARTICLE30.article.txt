# Chitren providing relief for Oakland
## 
### 
Steve Chitren has traded in
Cardinal and White for
Gold and Green, Sunken
Diamond for the Coliseum, but
Stanford remains with every
pitch he releases.
The greatest reliever in
Stanford history — the pitcher
on the mound for both of the
Cardinal's College World Series
victories — is now a rookie
hurler for the Oakland Athlet
ics. And while the Majors has
been a series of 3-2 counts,
Chitren remains motivated.
While developing his fast
ball, the Las Vegas, Nev. native
also gleaned a few other arti
cles from Stanford. Such as a
diploma. Desire. And a taste for
success.
Chitren may be struggling
during his first full season in
the show, but he'll keep driving
for success. Thanks to his four
years on the Farm.
Even though the short
reliever has chalked up 3.38
ERA in 16 innings for the A's,
Chitren remains optimistic and
positive.
"The success at Stanford
was fascinating to me. It makes
you so aware of what you can
do that you feel cheated if you
don't go out and try to be that
good every single time,"
Chitren said. "You look at suc
cessful players, at successful
people in general, and once
they get a taste of success they
want even more next time."
"It's what drives you to keep
working hard. [And] it makes
you aware of what your limita
tions are."
Chitren has seen his bound
aries and knows exactly how
far he can go to get that'S.'
For although he is the pos
sessor of the Stanford career
saves record and was drafted in
the sixth round, baseball and
life at Stanford were anything
but a breeze.
After going 8-3 with 13
saves his sophomore season,
Chitren couldn't seem to find
the strike zone during the first

half of his junior year and
relinquished lead after lead.
But after going 5-7 and chalk
ing up a 3.96 ERA, the resilient
pitcher regained his control
and his confidence. And helped
lead the Cardinal to a second
consecutive national title.

Senior year was more of the
same. After returning to Stan
ford to get his degree in biology
despite being drafted, Chitren
had another roller-coaster sea
son, finishing with a 6-4 record
and only two saves.
His experiences have helped
him tremendously in the
majors.
When most rookie pitchers
get called up they try to throw
just a little bit harder or
change their pitch oh-so
slightly from what they used in
triple-A ball. From his seasons
in hell, Chitren knows it's use
what you've got, and don't try
to do any more.
"With the ups and downs I
had at Stanford I learned the
hard way," Chitren said. "My
approach here is I'm going to
come out and go with the stuff
I've been successful with up to
this point.
"If it doesn't work out, I
know I don't have what it takes
to pitch in the big leagues."
Oakland obviously thinks
he has what's necessary.
While his experience in
the Majors hasn't been all
smooth sailing, Chitren has
shown the A's he has what it
takes. In his first full season in
