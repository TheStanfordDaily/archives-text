69 percent approval in the runoff
election, but a low voter turnout
caused it to fall about 25 votes
short of receiving approval by the
needed 15 percent of the student
body, according to elections com
missioner Enda Hu.
Zimmerman complained that
an ASSU financial-aid office, sup
ported by a non-binding referen
dum, is eligible for and will likely
receive funding while "everyone
in the senate validated the elec
tion without giving Pro Mo a
penny."
The referendum, which
required a majority approval, gar
nered 56 percent of the votes.
Various members of the ASSU
sympathized with the plight of
Project Motivation after the sen
ate meeting but said little could be
done.
"It was unfortunate that they
failed to receive the requisite
number of votes, but bylaws are
bylaws," said hearings officer
Jason Moore. "We can't impose
taxes on the students unless they
vote for them. Justice was served,
albeit cruelly."
COP-elect member Beth Mor
gan, currently the deputy senate
chair, agreed with Moore. "Realis
tically, it is a shame that Project
Motivation can't get funding
because it didn't get enough votes,
she said. The way supporters of

In perhaps its shortest meeting
ever, the ASSU Senate validated
the results of the spring runoff
election last night, leaving tomor
row night's certification vote as
the only thing between "Students
First" and the Council of Presi
dents position.
In a 10-minute meeting
attended by only 14 of 40 current
senators, the senate validated the
election by a divided voice vote.
The ASSU Bylaws and Constitu
tion require election results to be
validated and certified at separate
meetings before the results are
final.
"I am impressed how we have
worked together and finished a
senate meeting while it is still day
light," said hearings officer Jason
Moore just before the meeting
ended.
Graduate senator Andrew Zim
merman voted against the valida
tion because of the complications
surrounding the special-fee
request of Project Motivation, a
program that encourages Chi
cano/Latino high school students
to attend college.
Project Motivation was inad
vertently left off the general elec
tion ballot by the elections com
mission. The group received about

the financial-aid office managed
to slip the office back on the ballot
allows it to be funded by the
ASSU, she added.
The senate will meet again
tomorrow night in its final session
before the new senate officially
takes over. During the meeting,
which has a 340-page agenda, the
ASSU budget for next year is
expected to be approved. There
will also be discussion of an
ASSU-funded sexual assault pre
vention and education office.
Torrence Boone, the ASSU
financial manager, announced to
the senate's Budget and Finance
Committee, which met after the
full senate meeting, that student
fees will increase by four dollars
next year but the nonrefundable
part of the fee will decrease by
almost 25 percent.
COP-elect member John
Overdeck, who is currently com
mittee chair, said he "would like to
cut it more but the bylaws prevent
it." Overdeck said he will seek
changes next year in the bylaws
regarding the handling of various
accounts.
Overdeck added that the
$530,000 project reserves should
also be decreased. For instance,
Sunday Flicks alone has $250,000
in reserves, which is enough to
fund it for at least four years with
out selling a single ticket.
