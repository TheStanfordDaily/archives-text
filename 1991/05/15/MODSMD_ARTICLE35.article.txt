# Monument honors astronauts
## Stanford professor played key role in project's design 
### Jen Jauquet 
Celebrities may live to see their names lit up on
a marquee, but 14 astronauts killed in the line of
duty were recently honored with their names
emblazoned across the sky.
Family, friends and co-workers of the deceased
astronauts convened at the Kennedy Space Cen
ter in Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Thursday for the
unveiling of the four-story, granite Space Mirror
monument designed by Lambertus Hesselink, a
Stanford electrical engineering and physics pro
fessor, and a team of San Francisco architects.
Vice President Dan Quayle, head of the
National Space Council, attended the opening and
called the astronauts "American pioneers."
Hesselink's design allows the astronauts'
names to be projected onto the sky. The names are
carved into 93 blocks of granite with transparent
acrylic plastic, through which concentrated sun
light, which bounces off a parabolic mirror,
shines.
The idea for the monument originated in 1986
when the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster
claimed the lives of seven astronauts, including
school teacher Christa McAuliffe. The monument
also honors four astronauts killed in jet accidents
and three who died on the launch pad during the
1967 Apollo I accident.
Holt, Hinshaw, Pfau and Jones, a San Fran
cisco architectural firm, developed the elaborate
plan of using high-intensity light and special mir
rors to cast the names of fallen astronauts across
the sky. The design was selected from over 756

entries in a competition sponsored by the Astro
nauts Memorial Foundation.
The firm then enlisted the brain-power of Hes
selink, who attended Thursday's ceremony and
has been intimately involved with the conceptual
ization, mechanical design and computer model
ing of the $6.4 million project since its inception
in 1988.
"They asked me to design the optical system
and the tracking program — which charts the sun
as the earth rotates — to make this a reality,"
Hesselink said. "The mechanical design was very
difficult and the hand drills were a tricky design,
but ultimately our team found the solution."
Hesselink devoted about three years to writing
the complex computer program that effectively
tracks the sun. He and his team did most of the
work at Stanford.
He said that when visitors stand in front of the
memorial and let it fill their field of vision, they
will be able to read clearly the 14 names of the
astronauts.
The massive monument, standing 42.5 feet
high and 50 feet wide, was constructed to last at
least 200 years, Hesselink said. The team made
provisions to allow for additional tributes in the
future.
Unfortunately, the monument is already out
dated and incomplete. The name of astronaut
Manley (Sonny) Carter, who died in the April 5
plane crash that killed former U.S. Senator John
Tower, is scheduled to appear in the sky in the
next few weeks.
