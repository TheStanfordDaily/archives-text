# New Fac Sen chair elected
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
History Prof. James Sheehan has
been elected chair of next year's
Faculty Senate.
His election comes at a time
when faculty members are re-exam
ining the senate's role in University
governance and looking for ways to
increase the body's influence in the
administrative decision-making
process.
Stanford is currently facing a

combined $95 million shortfall over this year and
next year. The University's 1992-93 operating bud
get will have to be reduced by about 10 percent — a
process that requires a "change in the scope and pri
orities of the University," Provost James Rosse told
the faculty last month.
Sheehan wants to ensure faculty opinion is "vig
orously" represented throughout the process. "I
think next year will be a very important year for the
senate and the University," he said yesterday.
He added that he hopes the senate will foster "a
more intense dialogue with the administration" than
in past years — a change he considers healthy. "I
think it will be a productive dialogue," he said. "I
don't see it as confrontational."
The Faculty Senate was formed in 1968 to serve
as the representative body of the Academic Council,
which includes more than 1,300 Stanford professors.
The 55-member body approves degrees and sets Uni
versity policy on curriculum, academic programs,
admissions and research. It also plays an advisory
role on University budget issues.
Next year will be Sheehan's fifth year as a sena
tor. He served a two-year term in 1983-84 and 1984-
85. He is currently serving the first year of another
two-year term. In addition, he filled a vacated seat
during the 1988-89 academic year.

Sheehan received his bache
lor's degree from Stanford in 1958
and his doctorate in history from
UC-Berkeley in 1964. He was an
instructor at Stanford from 1962
to 1964 before becoming a faculty
member at Northwestern Univer
sity for 15 years.
He joined the Stanford faculty
in 1979 and served as chair of the
History Department from 1982-
85. A specialist in modern German
history, his research deals with
the relationship between social,
cultural and political develop
ments between the French Revo
lution and World War I.
Sheehan succeeds Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Charles
Kruger.
