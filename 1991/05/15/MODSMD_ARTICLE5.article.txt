# Senators hope to change body
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
It was a time to sit back
and look forward.
At last week's Faculty
Senate meeting, senators
spent about 45 minutes dis
cussing what was wrong
with the 55-member body
and how to fix it.
Before embarking on a
candid wide-ranging discus
sion, senators unanimously
passed a motion to dissolve
into "the committee of the
whole." Under such condi
tions, minutes are not
recorded. Journalists are
allowed to remain at the
meeting, but they must
agree not to attribute state
ments to individual sena
tors.
Almost all the senators
agreed that the body has
become too passive.
Some of the specific
observations:
• The senate should for
mulate more resolutions
stating faculty opinion on
relevant issues. Various sen
ators suggested such resolu-
tions might have been useful
commenting on University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's recent
teaching initiatives, the Stuart
Reges case or the recent decision
by the administration to demolish
several Row houses damaged in
the Earthquake of 1989.
• Something needs to be done
to address the "extremely
tedious" nature of the meetings.
One senator said he often found
himself bored by the proceedings.
• The senate should be smaller,
and senators should be chosen by
random lot rather than election.
Such a method, one professor
argued, would go a long way
toward depoliticizing the body.
Senators are currently elected by
members of artificially con

structed "districts."
• Senators shouldn't have to
listen to as many reports by
administrators and University
committees. One professor sug
gested that the practice of deliver
ing oral reports be curtailed. Sen
ators could read written versions
of the report at their leisure and
then ask questions at the meet
ing.
• The senate should not be so
heavily dominated by the presi
dent and the provost. Senators
need to discuss issues among
themselves more rather than sim
ply ask top administrators to jus
tify their decisions, one senator
suggested.
• Deans should attend more
regularly and be available for
questions about policy decisions
in their schools.
• Senators should make more
conscientious efforts to keep in
touch with the constituents who
elected them.
