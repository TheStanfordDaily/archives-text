# Lunch with Reges
## Ex-lecturer discusses drug war and uproar he caused 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld Staff writer 
More than 250 people gathered in White Plaza at
noon yesterday to hear Stuart Reges, the recently
dismissed computer science senior lecturer, speak on
the controversy he has sparked.
Sitting on the grass, Reges ate lunch and talked to
the crowd for more than an hour, criticizing the U.S.
' drug war" and his termination from work. He also
listened to some critics.
Reges said he regretted that Stanford had decided
to police the campus and limit free speech. "Students
shouldn't be expelled for calling people 'faggots,' and
I shouldn't be fired for giving my opinion," he added,
eating cheese and drinking non-fat milk.
However, Dean of the School of Engineering
James Gibbons, who dismissed Reges last Friday,
has said explicitly that his decision was not influ
enced by Reges' advice to a student to experiment
with the amphetamine-derived hallucinogen MDA.
He explained that Reges was fired for carrying illegal
drugs in his backpack and serving alcohol to under
age students.
"The University has joined the drug police" under

pressure from the federal government, Reges told
his attentive audience, which laughed and cheered
frequently during the informal hour-and-a-half ses
sion.
"Governments will accomplish what they want to
do by scaring people rather than implementing
laws," he added.
In a post-lunch interview, Reges talked about the
future of his case. "After today the news story ends,
unless I file a lawsuit," he said.
But the prospect of a lawsuit at this juncture is
pretty slight, he added.
Reges is currently seeking lawyers that will take
his case pro bono and help him file a grievance with
the University.
His comments came under strong attack by a
member of the audience. The man described Reges
as "the worst kind of armchair liberal hypocrite,"
and categorized his actions as "rash and intemper
ate." He criticized Reges' attempt to broaden the
debate on drug policy as "absolute rubbish."
The man identified himself as Phillip Lawes, a
graduate student in economics, but the Office of the
