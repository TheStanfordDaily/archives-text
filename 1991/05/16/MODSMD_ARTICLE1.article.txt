# White House proposal caps costs
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The White House proposed new rules yes
terday limiting the amount of indirect-cost
recovery universities can receive on federal
research grants and contracts.
The initiatives, announced by Richard Dar
man, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, include a cap on administrative over
head expenses as well as restrictions on how
universities can spend federal reimburse
ments for depreciation of their buildings and
scientific equipment.
Stanford administrators were reluctant
yesterday to assess the potential financial
impact of the proposals on the University but
indicated they were particularly concerned
about the limit on expenses associated with
University and departmental administrators'
offices.
"It will mean unrecovered costs," said
Larry Horton, associate vice president for pub

lic affairs. "It's going to be a loss."
Darman's plan would limit the reimburse
ments universities receive on administrative
costs to 26 percent of the direct costs of con
ducting federally sponsored research.
"That number appears a bit low," Horton
said.
Before the Navy slashed Stanford's indi
rect-cost rate last month, the University
recovered about 27.6 percent on administra
tive costs, according to University Controller
Frank Riddle. Each one-point drop translates
into a loss of about $1.25 million to the Uni
versity.
Administrative costs represent only one
component of a university's indirect-cost
recovery. Other expenses necessary to conduct
federal research include operations and main
tenance costs, library expenses and building
and equipment depreciation.
The rate at which Stanford was reimbursed
for all these expenses was cut by the Navy last
month to 55.5 percent from a proposed rate of

78 percent. University administrators said it
remained unclear how the Navy's decision last
month affected the administrative component
of the rate.
Stanford officials have maintained they will
be able to justify higher cost-recovery within a
year or so. But these efforts now may be hin
dered by a cap on administrative costs.
Most of the negative publicity Stanford has
received since last fall has resulted from costs
included in its administrative accounts, such
as flowers, antiques and catering bills at Lou
Henry Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Darman said yesterday that his proposals
were directed at such "abuses" by Stanford
and other research universities.
"The (Bush) administration remains com
mitted to funding a fair share of the costs of
the research enterprise," Darman said. "But
this share must not include excessive adminis-
trative costs. Abuses in cost
recovery must be stopped."
Navy regulator Paul Biddle,
whose allegations of wrongdoing
sparked Stanford's indirect-cost
controversy, said a cap on admin
istrative costs would "take a lot of
mischief out of the hands of
(Stanford) administrators."
"I think it's reasonable," he
said.
Biddle also disputed the Uni
versity's figures on how much
administrative expenses con
tribute to its overall indirect-cost
rate.
Prior to last month's cut, Bid
dle said, the administrative-cost
percentage was close to 34 per
cent, not 27.6 percent as Stanford
indicated. "1 don't know where
the hell they got that from,"he
said. Even after the cutback to
55.5 percent, there are about 30

points associated with adminis
trative costs, he added.
As many as 75 universities
have administrative reimburse
ment rates above 26 percent,
according to Robert Rosenzweig,
president of the Association of
American Universities. These
institutions together would lose
about $100 million under the pro
posed cap, Rosenzweig told the
Associated Press yesterday.
He also called the proposal a
"major change in science policy."
"As soon as you put a cap on
any element of costs, what you've
said is you're not going to reim
burse on the basis of real costs,
which has been the policy for 40
years."
Darman's initiatives would
also require universities to direct
federal reimbursements for
depreciation on their buildings
and scientific equipment toward
future building and equipment
costs. Currently, these reimburse
ments flow back into universities'
general funds and can be used for

any purpose they choose.
Horton called the proposal
"sort of odd," but said it was
unlikely to have any substantial
short-term effect on Stanford.
Darman's proposals will be
published in the May 18 Federal
Register, where they will be sub
ject to a period of review and com
ment. Riddle indicated that Stan
ford would likely express its views
on the proposals to the govern
ment.
As part of a broader review,
Darman also announced yester
day that he had established a task
force to examine Circular A-21,
the rules governing how universi
ties are reimbursed for federally
sponsored research costs.
"Many of these abuses would
not occur if there were agreed
accounting standards," Darman
said. "We must proceed immedi
ately to define those standards."
Darman's task force will
include representatives from the
White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy, the

Departments of Agriculture,
Defense, Energy, and Health and
Human Services, and the
National Science Foundation.
He also said he had asked the
Cost Accounting Standards
Board, a congressional agency, to
establish new standards for fed
eral research contracts. The two
reviews will be coordinated to
develop common standards for all
major research universities, Dar
man said.
Last month, Darman proposed
a laundry list of expense cate
gories that he felt should be
explicitly identified as unallow
able in Circular A-21. The list
included entertainment costs,
country-club memberships, pro
motional advertising and
expenses related to housing of
university administrators.
In addition to Darman's
efforts, two House subcommit
tees are currently drafting legisla
tion to reform the way universi
ties are reimbursed for the indi
rect costs of research.

recovery must be stopped."
Navy regulator Paul Biddle,
whose allegations of wrongdoing
sparked Stanford's indirect-cost
controversy, said a cap on admin
istrative costs would "take a lot of
mischief out of the hands of
(Stanford) administrators."
"I think it's reasonable," he
said.
Biddle also disputed the Uni
versity's figures on how much
administrative expenses con
tribute to its overall indirect-cost
rate.
Prior to last month's cut, Bid
dle said, the administrative-cost
percentage was close to 34 per
cent, not 27.6 percent as Stanford
indicated. "1 don't know where
the hell they got that from,"he
said. Even after the cutback to
55.5 percent, there are about 30

points associated with adminis
trative costs, he added.
As many as 75 universities
have administrative reimburse
ment rates above 26 percent,
according to Robert Rosenzweig,
president of the Association of
American Universities. These
institutions together would lose
about $100 million under the pro
posed cap, Rosenzweig told the
Associated Press yesterday.
He also called the proposal a
"major change in science policy."
"As soon as you put a cap on
any element of costs, what you've
said is you're not going to reim
burse on the basis of real costs,
which has been the policy for 40
years."
Darman's initiatives would
also require universities to direct
federal reimbursements for
depreciation on their buildings
and scientific equipment toward
future building and equipment
costs. Currently, these reimburse
ments flow back into universities'
general funds and can be used for

any purpose they choose.
Horton called the proposal
"sort of odd," but said it was
unlikely to have any substantial
short-term effect on Stanford.
Darman's proposals will be
published in the May 18 Federal
Register, where they will be sub
ject to a period of review and com
ment. Riddle indicated that Stan
ford would likely express its views
on the proposals to the govern
ment.
As part of a broader review,
Darman also announced yester
day that he had established a task
force to examine Circular A-21,
the rules governing how universi
ties are reimbursed for federally
sponsored research costs.
"Many of these abuses would
not occur if there were agreed
accounting standards," Darman
said. "We must proceed immedi
ately to define those standards."
Darman's task force will
include representatives from the
White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy, the

Departments of Agriculture,
Defense, Energy, and Health and
Human Services, and the
National Science Foundation.
He also said he had asked the
Cost Accounting Standards
Board, a congressional agency, to
establish new standards for fed
eral research contracts. The two
reviews will be coordinated to
develop common standards for all
major research universities, Dar
man said.
Last month, Darman proposed
a laundry list of expense cate
gories that he felt should be
explicitly identified as unallow
able in Circular A-21. The list
included entertainment costs,
country-club memberships, pro
motional advertising and
expenses related to housing of
university administrators.
In addition to Darman's
efforts, two House subcommit
tees are currently drafting legisla
tion to reform the way universi
ties are reimbursed for the indi
rect costs of research.
The White House proposed new rules yes
terday limiting the amount of indirect-cost
recovery universities can receive on federal
research grants and contracts.
The initiatives, announced by Richard Dar
man, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, include a cap on administrative over
head expenses as well as restrictions on how
universities can spend federal reimburse
ments for depreciation of their buildings and
scientific equipment.
Stanford administrators were reluctant
yesterday to assess the potential financial
impact of the proposals on the University but
indicated they were particularly concerned
about the limit on expenses associated with
University and departmental administrators'
offices.
"It will mean unrecovered costs," said
Larry Horton, associate vice president for pub

lic affairs. "It's going to be a loss."
Darman's plan would limit the reimburse
ments universities receive on administrative
costs to 26 percent of the direct costs of con
ducting federally sponsored research.
"That number appears a bit low," Horton
said.
Before the Navy slashed Stanford's indi
rect-cost rate last month, the University
recovered about 27.6 percent on administra
tive costs, according to University Controller
Frank Riddle. Each one-point drop translates
into a loss of about $1.25 million to the Uni
versity.
Administrative costs represent only one
component of a university's indirect-cost
recovery. Other expenses necessary to conduct
federal research include operations and main
tenance costs, library expenses and building
and equipment depreciation.
The rate at which Stanford was reimbursed
for all these expenses was cut by the Navy last
month to 55.5 percent from a proposed rate of

78 percent. University administrators said it
remained unclear how the Navy's decision last
month affected the administrative component
of the rate.
Stanford officials have maintained they will
be able to justify higher cost-recovery within a
year or so. But these efforts now may be hin
dered by a cap on administrative costs.
Most of the negative publicity Stanford has
received since last fall has resulted from costs
included in its administrative accounts, such
as flowers, antiques and catering bills at Lou
Henry Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Darman said yesterday that his proposals
were directed at such "abuses" by Stanford
and other research universities.
"The (Bush) administration remains com
mitted to funding a fair share of the costs of
the research enterprise," Darman said. "But
this share must not include excessive adminis-
trative costs. Abuses in cost
recovery must be stopped."
Navy regulator Paul Biddle,
whose allegations of wrongdoing
sparked Stanford's indirect-cost
controversy, said a cap on admin
istrative costs would "take a lot of
