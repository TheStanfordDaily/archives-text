# White House proposal caps costs

### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The White House proposed new rules yes
terday limiting the amount of indirect-cost
recovery universities can receive on federal
research grants and contracts.
The initiatives, announced by Richard Dar
man, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, include a cap on administrative over
head expenses as well as restrictions on how
universities can spend federal reimburse
ments for depreciation of their buildings and
scientific equipment.
Stanford administrators were reluctant
yesterday to assess the potential financial
impact of the proposals on the University but
indicated they were particularly concerned
about the limit on expenses associated with
University and departmental administrators'
offices.
"It will mean unrecovered costs," said
Larry Horton, associate vice president for pub

lic affairs. "It's going to be a loss."
Darman's plan would limit the reimburse
ments universities receive on administrative
costs to 26 percent of the direct costs of con
ducting federally sponsored research.
"That number appears a bit low," Horton
said.
Before the Navy slashed Stanford's indi
rect-cost rate last month, the University
recovered about 27.6 percent on administra
tive costs, according to University Controller
Frank Riddle. Each one-point drop translates
into a loss of about $1.25 million to the Uni
versity.
Administrative costs represent only one
component of a university's indirect-cost
recovery. Other expenses necessary to conduct
federal research include operations and main
tenance costs, library expenses and building
and equipment depreciation.
The rate at which Stanford was reimbursed
for all these expenses was cut by the Navy last
month to 55.5 percent from a proposed rate of

78 percent. University administrators said it
remained unclear how the Navy's decision last
month affected the administrative component
of the rate.
Stanford officials have maintained they will
be able to justify higher cost-recovery within a
year or so. But these efforts now may be hin
dered by a cap on administrative costs.
Most of the negative publicity Stanford has
received since last fall has resulted from costs
included in its administrative accounts, such
as flowers, antiques and catering bills at Lou
Henry Hoover House, the residence of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Darman said yesterday that his proposals
were directed at such "abuses" by Stanford
and other research universities.
"The (Bush) administration remains com
mitted to funding a fair share of the costs of
the research enterprise," Darman said. "But
this share must not include excessive adminis-
