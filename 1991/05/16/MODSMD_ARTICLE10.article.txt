# Physicist rescued in Yosemite
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
A Stanford physicist missing in
Yosemite National Park since
Sunday was rescued yesterday fol
lowing an expansive three-day
search by more than 60 park
rangers.
Anahid Yeremian, 37, a
researcher at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, had been
roaming the park's back country
for four days when she was picked
up by a helicopter rescue team on
a hillside yesterday morning.
"When the helicopter crew
found me I could see they were
just as happy as I was," Yeremian
said in a statement issued after
the rescue.
Yeremian could not be reached
for comment yesterday. She was
reportedly on her way back to the
Bay Area last night.
Park officials credited the
hiker's resourcefulness and good
thinking for saving her life. "She
did everything right," said Lisa
Dapprich, a park spokesperson.
She remained "calm, collected and
composed. That's what really
brought her through this situa
tion without serious injury."

Yeremian recounted her experi
ence in a post-rescue meeting with
park rangers yesterday afternoon.
Her odyssey began Saturday.
An experienced hiker, Yeremian
took out a permit for a one-day
excursion in Yosemite's wilds.
After setting out late Saturday
afternoon, she spent the night in a
clearing near Yosemite Falls trail,
6,700 feet above sea level, park
officials said.
The following morning she con
tinued trekking but became lost
because snowfall had obscured the
trail. Yeremian then tried unsuc
cessfully to follow footprints
before climbing to a higher eleva
tion to get her bearings, Dapprich
said.
When Yeremian did not return
to the park's base camp, officials
initiated a search. The hiker had
enough food — including bread
sticks and granola. But because
she had misplaced her backpack
and was only wearing shorts and a
cotton sweatshirt, she was not
prepared for Monday night's
freezing temperatures.
Officials said the hiker's ten
years of wilderness experience
saved her from serious injury or
death.

Yeremian found a hollow of a
tree and crawled in to escape the
icy night winds. She spent the
night in the tree trunk, placing a
map over the opening to keep
warm.
"When I heard the birds chirp
ing the following morning I knew
that I was still alive," she told res
cuers.
Yeremian found her pack on
Tuesday, just in time to set up a
mini-camp — a hammock and
tarp — before a snowstorm hit.
She also was forced to ration
food and decided to conserve calo
ries by not moving around, Dap
prich said.
A search team with dogs
located her Wednesday morning at
a location 8,200 feet above sea
level. The team then radioed a
helicopter to the hiker's location.
"She used all the right logic,"
Dapprich said.
In her statement prepared
after the rescue, Yeremian
thanked park officials for deliver
ing her to safety. "I thank God for
people like this and feel there is
nothing I could do to ever repay
them. . . . This was a fantastic
team that found me and saved my
life."
