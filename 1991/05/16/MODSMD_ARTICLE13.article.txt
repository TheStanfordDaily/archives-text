# Bush backs trade favoritism for China
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush said yesterday he stongly
believes China should continue getting
most-favored-nation trade status de
spite problems" with its human
rights record.
"I look at the big picture," Bush
said, adding that China had been sup
portive during the Persian Gulf War
and that its system was "an awful lot
better" than when he served in Beijing
as the U.S. envoy in the mid-19705.
Bush's stand sets the stage for a
new battle with Congress, which must
ratify his decision.
Liberal and conservative lawmakers,
believing Bush has been too easy on
China's hard-line, aging leaders, have
teamed up behind legislation to deny
most-favored-nation (MFN) status. If
a motion of disapproval were approved
by Congress, Bush probably would

veto it.
Mike Gendrzejczyk, Washington di
rector of Asia Watch, a private human
rights monitoring organization, said:
"We're deeply disappointed in Bush
tipping his hand on his MFN deci
sion. . . . He's basically told the Chi
nese that they have MFN for free this
year without making significant im
provements in human rights."
Bush has been at odds with law
makers on China ever since he resisted
penalizing Beijing for the 1989 mas
sacre in Tiananmen Square.
Human rights problems aside, there
also are growing concerns about
China's arms-sale policies. Bush sent
Undersecretary of State Robert Kim
mitt to Beijing last week to warn
against the sale of ballistic missiles to
Syria and Pakistan.
The deep strains in relations sur

faced anew early this month when
China's ambassador to the United
States, Zhu Qizhen, heatedly denied
that his country has violated its
citizens' human rights or that it has
a problem trade surplus with the
United States.
He said China would retaliate with
high tariffs to drive U.S. companies
out of its markets if the most-favored
nation status were denied.
To underscore U.S. unhappiness
with China, Bush met with the Dalai
Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet, last
month despite objections from Beijing.
He also barred the export to China of
parts for a domestic communications
satellite.
The MFN designation allows China,
with $15 billion in annual sales to
America, to export goods to the United
States at the lowest tariffs available.

The decision involves thousands of jobs
in the United States and many more
in China.
China's most-favored status is due
to expire July 3, and Bush must for
mally notify Congress by June 3 if he
wants to renew it. After receiving his
recommendation, Congress would have
90 days to consider a motion of dis
approval.
Bush disclosed his intentions after
a meeting with Senate Republicans on
Capitol Hill. "We discussed China,
MFN," Bush told reporters back at
the White House.
"And I go back to the days when I
was in China as the equivalent of am
bassador and, though there are major
problems in China, things that we
don't like about their system, things
are an awful lot better than they were
back in 1975." he said.
