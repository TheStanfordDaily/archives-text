# Baker ends trip without peace-conference accord

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Secretary of State James
Baker and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
met for nearly six hours of inconclusive talks yes
terday on terms for a Mideast peace conference.
Baker, tight-lipped throughout the day, told
reporters that he and Shamir had made progress.
But he evidently did not resolve differences between
Israel and the Arabs on a format for a peace con
ference and made plans to fly home today after a
brief, final meeting with Shamir.
A senior U.S. official said Baker had not even
asked Israel "for a formal commitment."
Two weeks ago Baker ended another unsuccessful
mission, blaming Israel. But this time American
and Israeli diplomats worked late into the night on
an understanding of where the two sides were in
accord.
This could have the effect of leaving it to the
Arab side in general, and Syria in particular, to
make the next move.
Avi Pazner, the media adviser to Shamir, said the
understanding would be made public before Baker
flew home. Also, Baker and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy planned to hold a news conference.
Baker had held open the possibility of extending
his fourth trip to the Middle East in two months
in order to go to Syria again for further talks with
President Hafez Assad.
At a meeting Sunday in Damascus the Syrian
leader registered two demands Shamir would not
accept: a decisive role for the United Nations in
peacemaking and agreement to reconvene the con
ference if direct talks between Israel and the Arabs
deadlocked.
