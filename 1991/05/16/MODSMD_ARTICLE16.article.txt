## It's a crying shame 
### 
ASSU's mistake will
keep a worthy cause
from getting funding

IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL
sorry for Project Motivation, a
program that encourages Chi
cano/Latino high schoolers to
attend college.
Mistakenly left off the general
election ballot by the ASSU Elec
tions Commission, the project then
won about 69 percent of the vote
when it was included on the ballot
for the runoff election.
But because of low turnout, Pro
ject Motivation ended up 25 votes
short of gaining approval, under an
ASSU bylaw which states that a fee
request must be voted for by 15
percent of the entire student body.
As the situation stands, the
group will not receive its fee
request.
And for better or worse, that's
the way things should remain. Any
attempt to change the result of a
fair election would further call into
question the already dubious
integrity of the ASSU election pro
cess. The ASSU Senate should not
have the power to manipulate the
results of elections after the fact.
While the project clearly suf
fered from not having a spot on the
original ballot, two wrongs don't
make a right. And although Project
Motivation's work is clearly praise
worthy, the senate shouldn't con
tinue to bend the rules, as it did in
placing MEChA and XTV on the
runoff ballot.
The 15 percent requirement pre
vents frivolous requests from pass
ing in elections with low voter
turnout. Generally, it's a sensible
requirement; no one would want
the ASSU Doorknob Polishing Ser
vice to receive $100,000 of student
money because of the whims of a

handful of strongly interested stu
dents.
However, the senate could have
foreseen the problem Project Moti
vation would have in a low-turnout
runoff election, and exempted it
from the 15 percent requirement
before the votes were cast.
But the time to do something
was before the election — not after.
The senate must not have the
power to reinterpret the voters'
will.
The ASSU must not bend the
rules in favor of individual groups.
If it starts basing its certification of
election results on its own prefer
ences or hastily drawn-up rules, it
creates an astounding potential for
abuse.
No one wants to see a situation
where the senate can grant fee
requests arbitrarily.
And if so few people cared about
Project Motivation that 15 percent
of the student body wouldn't show
up to approve its request, then it's
hard to say that the group has a
strong mandate.
In the words of Hearing Officer
Jason Moore, "We can't impose
taxes on the students unless they
vote for them. Justice was served,
albeit cruelly."
With this in mind, however, the
student community should do its
best to see that a worthwhile cause
gets the funding it deserves. Hope
fully the Program Board will give
members of the project a sizable
contribution.
Students should also want to
keep the election's circumstances
in mind if Project Motivation seeks
contributions from dormitories
and student groups.
To prevent this situation from
arising in the future, the Elections
Commission must print the ballot
before the election to make sure it
is mistake-free.
Student groups should be able to
see and be responsible for approv
ing the ballot before the election.
