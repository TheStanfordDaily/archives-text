Is the University to decide what is best for us?

IN THE MOVIE "Dead Poets' Soci
ety," Robin Williams' character,
Charles Keating, encourages free
thought and discourse among a group of
students who are intellectually stifled by
their surroundings. He tries to teach
them that they have choices. He tries to
show them that they can think for them
selves. He doesn't tell them what to
think, he just encourages them to think.
Keating ultimately loses his job for
encouraging his students to think for
themselves.
I believe that drug use is wrong. If
you break any kind of drug law and are
caught, you should be punished to the
fullest extent of the law. Based on what I
know about drug use, I plan on never
experimenting with drugs, because it is
my belief that such activity is wrong and
unhealthy
Stuart Reges is being fired for advo
cating drug use. This brings up a very

interesting question: Should the Univer
sity fire someone for something that is
not against the law? The law cannot con
vict him, but his own word can cost him
his job. Diana Conklin was arrested and
convicted on drug charges; why does it
appear that Reges lost his job for merely
speaking his mind? Or is speaking your
mind a more dangerous crime?
Reges was fired for allowing minors to
drink beer with University-unrestricted
funds. Does this mean that anytime a
faculty member of the University buys
an underage student a drink he should
be fired? Should we be turning in those
faculty members who drink with under
age students? Should every resident
assistant who buys beer for freshmen be
fired or expelled?
Reges was originally investigated for
'counseling' a student about certain nar
cotics. After this incident, I can't feel
that faculty members will be able to

speak openly and freely with me.
I do not want to give my right to
make choices and decisions to any insti
tution. Is the University to decide, as the
school did in "Dead Poets' Society," what
is best for us?
I abhor and am repulsed by Reges'
drug use. Drugs are a major problem in
this country and I would never condone
• or encourage their usage. But that is my
decision to make.
John Stuart Mill wrote in "On Lib
erty" that "the peculiar evil of silencing
the expression of an opinion is that it is
robbing the human race, posterity as
well as the existing generation. If the
opinion is right, they are deprived of the
opportunity of exchanging error for
truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost
as great a benefit, the clearer perception
and livelier impression of truth produced
by its collision with error."
The University should be supporting

Reges, not purging him. If the govern
ment can tell the University to fire
Reges, what else can it do?
If we refuse to allow discussion of
drugs, won't we forget why it is wrong to
take them? I am ashamed to be a student
at a university that appears to be firing a
person solely because he spoke his mind.
What else can the University keep us
from saying? Do we want a school that
prohibits and limits the speech of its fac
ulty? Do we want a Stanford like the
school in "Dead Poets Society"?
I consider Reges one of my heroes. In
an age when many of our leaders and
educators fail to reach for the sky and
instead grasp mediocrity, it is refreshing
to see someone willing to take a stand
and live his life honestly and openly.
I don't believe Reges is right, but I
believe he has the right to be wrong.
