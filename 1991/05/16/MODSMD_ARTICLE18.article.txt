# Cowell, Hospital will respect the privacy of students who visit
## 
### 
In his letter to The Daily concerning
the suspension of the Delta Delta Delta
sorority after a pledge was brought to
the hospital for treatment for alcohol
sickness, Matt Rhone wrote that "Stu
dents should have the confidence that
they can go to Cowell Student Health
Center or to the Medical Center and have
their problems taken care of in a discreet
matter."
I'm writing to assure the community
that that is exactly what happens.
Medical information in the possession
of Cowell is confidential. It is not
released to the University, to police or to

anyone else unless the student requests
in writing that information be shared
with someone else, or a subpoena is
received.
In the latter case, every effort is made
to notify the student before complying. A
subpoena would be issued only if a stu
dent were involved in litigation.
Students who seek counseling at
Counseling and Psychological Services
for any concerns, including those that
are alcohol-related, can be assured that
those records will be confidential except
as noted above. This is also true of the
Stanford Hospital emergency room.
Information gained separately by
police is a different matter. The Stanford
Police Department maintains an open
police blotter with information that is
available to the press and to other inter
ested parties, including the University.
Depending on the circumstances,

information gained this way — or
through any of the several other ways
information is gained and circulated in a
community the size of Stanford — may
or may not be used in University disci
plinary action.
