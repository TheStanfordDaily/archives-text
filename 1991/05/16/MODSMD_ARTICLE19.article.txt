# Soldiers have power to put an end to needless, unnecessary fighting
## 
### 
A recent piece on National Public
Radio provided some inspiration which I
take to heart as Armed Forces Day
approaches.
Analyzing why allied intelligence over
estimated Iraqi military support in the
months before the war, the commentator
noted how no one guessed that so many

Iraqi soldiers would desert as hostilities
began.
Between 100,000 and 150,000 troops
— or 20 to 30 percent of the Iraqi forces
facing the allies — deserted, a factor
which certainly helped shorten the war
and probably saved tens of thousands of
lives.
Whether or not the Iraqi deserters
knew it, their intelligent actions direct
our attention to Albert Einstein's wis
dom: "Wars will cease when young men
refuse to fight."
I look forward to the era when Armed
Forces Day becomes obsolete because
enough soldiers throughout the world
have used whatever legal or illegal means
at their disposal to refuse service, and
thus caused the collapse of militaries
everywhere.
How soon that comes is up to all of us.
