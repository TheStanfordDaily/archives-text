## Former foreign minister to visit Hoover archives 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
First it was behind Kremlin walls; now it is
behind the gates of Stanford.
On Saturday, Eduard Shevardnadze, former
Soviet foreign minister and George Shultz, former
U.S. secretary of state, will meet again.

Shevardnadze will attend a
closed luncheon in his honor at the
Hoover Institution. He was invited
to Stanford by Shultz, who is cur
rently a Hoover Distinguished Fel
low. Several professors, Hoover fel
lows and graduate students have
also been asked to attend.
He will spend Saturday after
noon viewing Russian treasures in
the Hoover archives. Among these

historical gems arc tho first issue of the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda, original letters by Lenin
and the abdication notice of the last Russian czar,
Nicholas 11, according to Charles Palm, Hoover
deputy director.
Shevardnadze was elected foreign minister in
July 1985 and held the position until his resigna ion
last December. The Georgian diplomat, second only
to Gorbachev in decision-making and a very power
ful voice in defense and arms control matters, omi
nously voiced his fears of a looming dictatorship as
he tendered his resignation.
Prof. Jack Kollman of the Center for Russian and
Eastern European Studies called Shevardnadze an
"interesting character" in world politics. He said,
"Shevardnadze's resignation on a matter of princi
ple elevates him above ordinary politics."
Because his resignation was not motivated by
personal interest, it makes him "a very attractive
figure," Kollman added.
On Friday afternoon, Shevardnadze will speak on
the economic and political future of the Soviet
Union at the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco.
Shevardnadze has already made his rounds on
the East Coast, where he visited the White House
and delivered the commencement address at Boston
University.
