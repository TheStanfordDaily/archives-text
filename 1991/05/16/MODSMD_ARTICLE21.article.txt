## Fashion’s obnoxious reign 
### 
THE USE OF ETHNIC MODELS in
the fashion world has become its
latest trend.
More ethnic-looking models are grac
ing the covers of magazines. Now, the
fashion experts are proclaiming the
arrival of the "ethnic model."
I suppose the fashion tycoons think
that women of color should rejoice about
this sudden inclusion. But gaining the
right to be objectified is no cause for cele
bration.
First of all, the fashion world is not
known for its accurate depictions of
women in general, and of women of color
in particular. Fashion experts enforce on
our society a capricious standard of
beauty that dictates what is beautiful and
what is not — long hair one season, short
hair the next.
Nevertheless, there are some definite
constants in the fashion world, inviolable
rules that govern the standard of beauty
at all times. These include a woman's
height, weight, bone structure and all the
other superficial requirements used to
determine a woman's beauty.
This standard of beauty has had devas
tating effects on an incredible number of
women. Although most women cannot
easily fit into the standard, they make
themselves miserable trying.
The prevalence of anorexia nervosa,
bulimia and other eating disorders in our
society is a symptom of the self-hatred the
standard of beauty imposes.
This standard of beauty is especially
hard on women of color because they usu
ally deviate from it radically. The ethnic
model isn't much better.

The new ethnic model, though not
white, is usually at least part white.
Her lips may be a bit more sensuous
and her tan a little deeper; her hair may
not even be the same texture as that of
the white woman. But the ethnic model
still conforms to the white aesthetic. The
ethnic model seems to be just ethnic
enough to be exotic but not so ethnic that
she deviates from the established norms
of white beauty.
There are no broad noses or kinkv hair,
no cheek bones that are too high, no eyes
that are too slanted or too dark, no lips
that are overly full.
The fact that the white aesthetic is
becoming the standard of beauty for
women of color is particularly appalling
because United States and Europe export
it to the rest of the world as easily as they
export their magazines, television shows
and advertisements.
The first world imposes upon the rest
of the world a European cultural concept
of beauty that is just as inappropriate for
the rest of the world as its political con
cepts about liberty and democracy, in
which, for example, the Nicaraguan con
tras are considered freedom fighters
while the Salvadoran revolutionaries are
considered guerrilla terrorists.
Most of the women in the world don't
look like Paulina Porizkova, or even like
Benetton's ethnic models.
Through cultural imperialism, the
North Atlantic's standard of beauty easily
penetrates other cultures. Latin Ameri
can versions of "Cosmopolitan" and ot her
fashion magazines often feature blonde
or Nordic-looking women on the cover.

Moreover, the standard of beauty rein
forces the already existing inter- and
intra-ethnic racism in those non-pAiro
pean nations.
In Latin America, for example, it
superimposes an exogenous category
upon the already existing racial hierarchy.
It introduces the Nordic-European
model as the ideal — a category that even
in the highly varied cultural and racial
mix of Latin America is extremely rare
and definitely doesn't portray the reality
of the Latin American masses, who tend
to be darker the further down in the
socioeconomic scale they are.
Countless black artists and activists
have addressed this issue as it affects
their own community: Spike Lee dealt
with it in his movie "School Daze" and
Toni Morrison in"The Bluest Eyes."
Too many people have internalized the
dictates of the fashion gods to break away
from them and to learn to find comfort in
who they are. Too many women, of all col
ors, worry about how fat they are, how
short they are and how ugly they feel.
Even if the standard of beauty weren't
so inherently racist, it would still oppress
the great majority of the world's women,
who feel, and will continue to feel, inade
quate because of it.
