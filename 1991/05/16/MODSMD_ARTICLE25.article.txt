## Stirring up the potpourri 
### 
From one observer's point of
view:
• Memo from Frank Bren
nan to fellow coaches: Host team
jinx? What host team jinx? RS.
Y'all come back in '92, ya hear?
Heh heh.
• The excitement here over the
possibility of Duke sharpshooting
guard Billy McCaffrey transfer
ring to Stanford died quietly
Tuesday, when McCaffrey an
nounced suddenly that he will
attend Vanderbilt next year. I
wonder what could have turned
his head to the Commodores' pro
gram so sharply?

• Could this be Michael Jor
dan's year to finally win an NBA
title? Says here that no experience
in the championship series will
ultimately prove fatal to Mike and
Co. Blazers in six.
• Course, by the time they play
that final series we'll be taking
finals of our own. It's about this
time of the year that I realize why
I like college basketball 10 times
better than pro. Basketball's a
winter sport, period.
• Never losing in the NCAA
tournament during your entire
college career is a little like acing
every final for four years — it's
almost unnatural.
• What was Adam Keefe think
ing? Forget the money — he's
coming back to a team that over
achieved to win an NIT champi
onship, then lost four starters to
graduation. He's not gonna be
double-teamed next year, he's
gonna be quintuple-teamed. What
does he think he is, a student-ath
lete? PS. Just kidding, Adam.
Congratulations on making the
right choice. We appreciate it, and
we respect the hell out of you.
• My whole image of Jose
Canseco was shot this week, and
just when 1 thought he was rally
ing. After an illicit visit to
Madonna's New York apartment,
Canseco went after a taunting fan
in Yankee Stadium . . . just to yell
at him. What's the world coming
to?
• The U.S. national soccer team
plays Argentina in Stanford Sta
dium at 1 p.m. Saturday. Sixty
thousand fans are expected. This
is news to you? Somehow, I'm not
surprised.
• Is Nolan Ryan human?
• In February, I wrote a column
appealing to dominant teams such
as UNLV's men's basketball
squad and Brennan's tennis jug
gernaut, asking for a loss to break
the monotony. Both subsequently
lost, ending long win streaks.
The difference? Tarkanian and
the boys didn't get a comeback
shot; Brennan and the Cardinal
did, and made the most of it.
Memo to Florida coach Andy
Brandi: He who laughs last,
laughs best.
• With the "Top this" mentality
of the Stanford tennis programs, I
wouldn't be surprised if Dick
Gould and the Cardinal men bring
home a fourth straight title next
week.
• The San Francisco Giants are
suffering their poorest start in
nearly 20 years. As of yesterday,
they had the worst record in base
ball at 10-22, trailing first place
Atlanta by seven and a half games.
Meanwhile, the Oakland A's are
in the midst of a three-game los
ing streak, and lead second place
Seattle by just a half game.
As a four-year Bay Area resi
dent and victim of the debilitating
