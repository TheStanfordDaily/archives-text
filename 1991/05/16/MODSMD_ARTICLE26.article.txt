# Netters alive — barely — in NCAA individuals
## Birch meets Cal's Albano in singles final; Whitlinger and Poruri reach doubles semis 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The war of attrition known as the
NCAA Women's Tennis Individual Cham
pionships claimed yet another handful of
victims yesterday. Foremost among the
casualties was Stanford junior Debbie
Graham, who was blasted out of the sin
gles draw by California's Lisa Albano.
But three Stanford women are still
alive: Sandra Birch will vie for her second
national singles crown at 5 p.m. today in
the Stanford Tennis Stadium, while Teri
Whitlinger and Laxmi Poruri have moved
into the doubles semifinals. The Cardinal
duo plays at 10 a.m. and, if they win, com
pete in the finals, which are scheduled for
7 p.m.
The four quarterfinals went pretty
much as expected in the morning. Birch
got on and off the court in a hurry, cruis
ing past Kansas junior Eveline Hamers 6-
1, 6-3.
The other three matches, though, went
to three sets before being decided. Gra
ham met one of the two sleepers among
the final eight, Ole Miss freshman Paloma

Collantes. Graham took the first set 6-4
but Collantes won the second set by the
same score.
Finally, Graham was able to outslug
the promising Peruvian 6-2 in the third.
Little did anyone know at the time — save
Graham — that the Stanford start had
nothing left with which to continue.
The other semifinalists could easily
have wound up in the same boats. Georgia
junior Shannan McCarthy bested Florida
sophomore Andrea Farley 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 in a
clash of Southeastern Conference titans.
Albano finally ended the spectacular run
of Miami's unheralded Melissa Mazzotta,
defeating her 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Exactly what ailed Graham wasn't
clear, but she was taking both antibiotics
and an anti-inflammatory for two unre
lated shoulder problems. She may have
had a reaction to the drugs.
Whatever it was that affected Graham
certainly had no effect on Albano. The
Peabody, Mass., native came of age yester
day, stepping up to earn a place among the
college tennis elite by thrashing Graham
6-3, 6-0.
"I'm really excited," Albano said. "This

is the first time I've ever beaten her.
That's more important to me than getting
to the finals."
Early on, it appeared she might not
accomplish either feat. Through five
games, neither player had held serve and
Graham was leading 3-2. Then, all of the
sudden, it was over.
Albano broke and got the match's first
hold of serve to edge ahead 4-3. She broke
Graham once more and was serving for
the set. Graham had enough fight left to
save three set points before Albano hit a
winner to go up 6-3.
Early in the second set, Graham tried a
change of strategy. She began mixing in
some high, arcing moonballs in an
attempt to throw Albano off stride.
The tactic had little effect, though, in
part because Albano was prepared for it.
"I was actually lucky because in my match
this morning, I was hitting moonballs,"
Albano said. The Golden Bear All-Ameri
can used the technique to throw off Maz
zotta and had success with it.
Graham did not. It wasn't until she
trailed 5-0 that Graham put up one final
charge. Serving at match point, Albano

sent a forehand streaking toward Graham
that landed out by about three inches.
Albano then proceeded to choke away
three more match points on unforced
errors before finally putting Graham
away.
"I was very tired," Graham said. "I had
no energy. . . . Maybe if 1 had won easier
[in the) morning. Whatever I would've
done, nothing was working. I wasn't very
focused or concentrating too well.
"I did the best 1 could which obviously
wasn't good enough for today."
In the end, the 1990 NCAA champion
had lost an unbelievable 10 consecutive
games to a player who, before yesterday,
was one level below the top echelon.
"Lisa's been streaking since March,"
Cal coach Jan Brogan said, explaining
that Albano finally went a couple of
months without pulling a muscle or pick
ing up some other injury and has been on
a roll.
Albano has finally learned that she
shouldn't be intimidated by her opposi
tion. When she took the first set, instead

Teri Whitlinger and partner Laxmi Poruri are two wins away from an NCAA doubles championship. Should they win their semifinal match, which takes place at 10 a.m.
today, and the final, Whitlinger will become only the second player to win the NCAA doubles title twice. Stanford great Linda Gates accomplished the feat in 1984 and '85.
of getting tense she went for the
jugular. "I wanted to keep playing
like I was playing and not let up."
Brogan attributed Albano's
new killer instinct to something
called "The Model." Brogan has
her players "look at the barriers
they set up and get rid of them.
She's been willing to do that,"
Brogan said.
One of those barriers was Gra
ham, another is Birch, the 1989
champion. Birch would like to
nothing more than to go out on
top and become only the second
player ever to win the NCAA sin
gles title twice. Stanford's Patty
Fendick pulled off the double with
crown in '86 and '87.
If Birch plays the same heady
tennis she did yesterday, the title
should be hers. After defeating
Hamers, she played a superb tac
tical match to defeat the always
tough McCarthy.
Birch dropped the first set 6-4
but came back to win the next two
6-2, 6-3. She was able to negate
McCarthy's superb net play with
a variety of passing shots and
some attacking of her own.
"I tried to play more aggres
sively," Birch said. "[Playing at
the net] has not really become as
much a part of my game as I'd like
it to." Yesterday, though, Birch
was volleying like a pro, some
thing she'll probably need to do to
beat Albano.
The two have met three times
this year with Birch winning eas
ily each time. At the Riviera All-
American tournament in October,
Birch handled her 6-2, 6-1. In the
two Stanford-Cal dual matches,
Birch won 6-0, 6-1 in Berkeley
and 6-2, 6-3 at Stanford.
That's ancient history now,
though. So is the fact that Albano
has never beaten Birch. "That

doesn't make any difference the
way she's been playing this
week," Birch said. "I don't think
Debbie ever lost to her either
(before yesterday). But look what
happened today."
Birch won't have to worry
about playing doubles today since
she and Graham were eliminated
by Noelle Porter and Janna
Kovacevich of Pepperdine. The
Cardinal pair was exhausted and
got beat by a fresher team.
In both sets, the Stanford
women were leading 5-4 with
Birch serving but each time were
broken. Kovacevich and Porter
won the match 7-5, 7-5.
The Cardinal nevertheless has
a chance to duplicate its unprece
dented triple in 1990 — winning
the team, singles and doubles
titles in the same year. The double
hopes rest with Poruri and
Whitlinger, 7-5, 6-3 winners over
Dorey Brandt and Nicole Storto
of San Diego State.
But the title will be tough to
take. The 10 a.m. match pits
Poruri and Whitlinger against
UCLA's Kim Po and Stella Sam
pras, the No. 1 seeds in the tour
nament.
Sampras and Whitlinger have
a lot in common. Each has won
the NCAA doubles title with
someone other than their current
partner and each has held the No.
1 ranking with a third partner.
Whitlinger won the championship
last season with Meredith
McGrath in 1990 and was ranked
No. 1 with her sister Tami.
Sampras captured the national
crown in 1988 with Allyson
Cooper. She and Mamie Ceniza
were once ranked first in the
country.
Should Poruri and Whitlinger
advance, either Kovacevich and
Porter or Florida's Nicole Arendt
and Jillian Alexander await them
in the finals. Arendt and Alexan
der are seeded second in the tour
nament.
