# Baseball heartbreaker: Hornets sting Card in Sacramento
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
If baseball games were seven innings
long, Stanford would have no trouble
with Sacramento State. Unfortuantly for
the Cardinal, the game requires teams to
play through nine frames, and those last
two innings have not been too kind when
the Hornets are on the other half of the
scorebook.
On Feb. 19, the Cardinal blew a 10-2
seventh-inning lead and eventually lost
12-10. Though yesterday's 9-8 setback
was not as drastic a lead change, it was no
less dramatic.
Leading 8-6 after seven complete,
Stanford reliever Brian Sackinsky faced
Hornet pinch hitter Will Fitzpatrick with
men on first and second and two out.
With Sackinsky at 6-foot-5, 220 pounds
and Fitzpatrick at 6-5, 215, it was a battle
of the big boys. In a classic showdown pit-

ting brawn versus more brawn, the
skinny guy wound up on top.
After fouling off a couple of balls to
even the count at 2-2, Fitzpatrick met
heat with power and sent a fastball over
the right field fence to bring the standing
room-only crowd of 1,700 to their feet and
bring eventual victory to the home team.
For the Cardinal it was the eighth non
conference loss of the year, dropping them
to 36-20. Sacramento State improved to
40-22-1 as their hopes for a NCAA invite
were greatly improved after dropping No.
9 Stanford.
The Cardinal could only leave the field
shaking their heads and uttering unprint

ables, while the Hornets jumped all over
each other in a messy pile of celebration.
Stanford players probably do not like los
ing to a team that has gotten beat by such
powerhouses as Lewis & Clark and Port
land State.
The problem is, this has happened not
once, but twice. Could Sacramento State
have the Cardinal's number?
"It's tough to say when you have only
played two times," said Stanford coach
Mark Marquess. "They have played bet
ter the two times we have played them.
They deserve the win."
The loss left pitching coach Tom Dun
ton without any answers to a pitching
problem that becomes very dangerous as
the postseason approaches. Stanford
hurlers have had trouble holding leads all
year.
In the eighth, Sackinsky was having
control problems and getting behind in
the count, but only gave up two weak

ground ball singles. That prompted Mar
quess to keep closer Scott Weiss in the
bullpen when Fitzpatrick came up.
"I thought [SackinskyJ was throwing
well; he hadn't been hit hard yet," Mar
quess said. "The guy comes out and hits a
homer — you have to give him credit; it
was a great effort."
In a day that was dominated by the
longball, Stanford came up just a little
short. Both squads hit two home runs
apiece, with the Cardinal's shots from the
men you would expect to see breaching
enemy fences — David McCarty and Jef
frey Hammonds.
Hammonds' 11th homer of the year
was a two-out, two-run blast that lined
into the left field scoreboard with a pow
erful thud. The fifth-inning shot gave the
Cardinal a comfortable 6-2 lead at the
time and highlights the sophomore cen
terfielder's recent hot streak.
Hammonds is currently on an eight

game hitting streak, and has hit .435 over
the past 13 games with 22 runs batted in.
"Personally, I felt good at the plate,"
said Hammonds. "But we also did well as
a team. We got eight runs on 11 hits, they
just wanted it more."
Joining Hammonds in clearing the
fence was McCarty, recently named the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
Player of the Year. McCarty has been com
ing through for the Cardinal all year, and
did so again in the top of the seventh.
With the score knotted at six, the
Houston native followed David Hol
brook's leadoff triple with his league lead
ing 21st home run of the year. The shot
over the fence in right-center highlighted
a 3-for-4, three RBI day.
After a series with California that saw
the national player of the Year candi
date's average drop 20 points to below
.400, the offensive production was a wel
come slump breaker.
