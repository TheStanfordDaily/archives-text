# Physicist wants freedom in China

### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
Chinese astrophysicist Fang
Lizhi visited Stanford this week
under the auspices of the Uni
versity's astronomy program.
And although he spoke about
the structure of the universe,
his main focus was the absence
of universal human rights in his
homeland.
During his visit Tuesday and
yesterday, Fang, who is probably
China's best-known dissident,
lived up to his reputation as an
unflappable proponent of free
dom of speech and press in

China.
In an interview with The
Daiiy, the once-persecuted Chi
nese intellectual, who spent 386
days hiding in the American
Embassy in Beijing after the
Tiananmen Square massacre,
criticized President Bush's posi
tion on trade with China, which
was announced yesterday. He
also challenged a recent article
written by former President
Jimmy Carter. Fang said Carter
and Bush have both been too
soft on China's ailing leaders.
Bush announced yesterday
that he supports granting most
favored nation trading status to

China again this year, meaning
that China would receive the
lowest possible tariffs on its
exports to the United States.
Opponents of granting the trade
status hope to weaken Chinese
leaders' hold on power by harm
ing the regime's ability to trade.
Advocates of continued
favored trading status for China
argue that maintaining eco
nomic relations can lead to
reform.

rights improvements are made.
But Bush, commenting from
his experience as envoy to China,
was quoted by the Associated
Press yesterday as saying,
"Though there are major prob
lems in China, things we don't
like about their system, things are
an awful lot better than they were
back in 1975."
Fang criticized Bush's logic as
"not too strong."
"You can't only ask if this level
is higher than 10 years ago," he
said.
If China's leaders want to
move in an increasingly repressive
direction, "Why are you still
happy?" he asked Bush rhetori
cally.
Fang criticized an editorial
written by Carter after his recent
trip to China.
In the article, Carter writes
that while in China he requested
that government officials allow
Chinese students studying over
seas to visit China and be able to
travel back again to their univer
sities. He also called for amnesty
for peaceful protesters involved in
the 1989 pro-democracy move
ment and for reduced sentences
for jailed students, among other
measures.

Although Fang agreed with
these requests, he criticized the
central thrust of the opinion,
printed April 30 in The New York
Times.
Carter writes, "Prime Minister
Li Peng, General Secretary Jiang
Zemin, Foreign Minister Quin
Qichen, Education Minister Li
Tieying and others listened with
patience and close attention to
these suggestions. They assured
me that students can visit China
freely and return abroad."
He adds that the leaders did
not reject "out of hand" all his
suggested human rights improve
ments.
"They (and leaders of other
socialist countries) point out, cor
rectly, that there is a wide range of
human rights, some of which are
respected in their countries and
neglected in the U.S. These
include the right to have a decent
home, job and adequate health
care," the article continues.
But Fang disagreed strongly,
saying instead that human rights
do not vary in different countries.
"I was very disappointed in his
paper. In Tiananmen Square,
many people died. Why did he
never mention that?" he said.
"And he mentioned that Li
Peng and some leaders 'heard' his
speech, but he never said what
their response was. Did they give
him a positive response? No
response is equal to a negative

response," he added.
Fang said he believes that Chi
nese authorities "never felt they
were sorry for the Tiananmen
Massacre," and that Carter was
misled if he believed people in
China could ever have confidence
in the current government again.
Despite his willingness to chal
lenge current and former U.S.
presidents when he disagrees with
them, Fang said he is not a politi
cian by choice.
In addition, he does not like to
be thought of as the leader of the
Chinese democracy movement.
But he acknowledged, "I'm still
a famous dissident in China." He
said he has a responsibility to be
an inspiration to the movement,
even if we doesn't want to be its
leader.
Some Chinese activists have
criticized Fang because he hasn't
stormed into politics to become
the central overseas leader of the
democracy movement.
But Fang seems confident in
his position. "In China, many
times I mentioned the idea of
democracy. . . I still demand free
dom and democracy in China."
Fang said he will continue to
work toward measuring the uni
verse, calling for democratic
change and thinking about his
country.
"Home is still very sad," he
said. "I still remember my friends
and colleagues."

And although he spoke about
the structure of the universe,
his main focus was the absence
of universal human rights in his
homeland.
During his visit Tuesday and
yesterday, Fang, who is probably
China's best-known dissident,
lived up to his reputation as an
unflappable proponent of free
dom of speech and press in

China.
In an interview with The
Daiiy, the once-persecuted Chi
nese intellectual, who spent 386
days hiding in the American
Embassy in Beijing after the
Tiananmen Square massacre,
criticized President Bush's posi
tion on trade with China, which
was announced yesterday. He
also challenged a recent article
written by former President
Jimmy Carter. Fang said Carter
and Bush have both been too
soft on China's ailing leaders.
Bush announced yesterday
that he supports granting most
favored nation trading status to

China again this year, meaning
that China would receive the
lowest possible tariffs on its
exports to the United States.
Opponents of granting the trade
status hope to weaken Chinese
leaders' hold on power by harm
ing the regime's ability to trade.
Advocates of continued
favored trading status for China
argue that maintaining eco
nomic relations can lead to
reform.
Fang said he would accept

rights improvements are made.
But Bush, commenting from
his experience as envoy to China,
was quoted by the Associated
Press yesterday as saying,
"Though there are major prob
lems in China, things we don't
like about their system, things are
an awful lot better than they were
back in 1975."
Fang criticized Bush's logic as
"not too strong."
"You can't only ask if this level
is higher than 10 years ago," he
said.
If China's leaders want to
move in an increasingly repressive
direction, "Why are you still
happy?" he asked Bush rhetori
cally.
Fang criticized an editorial
written by Carter after his recent
trip to China.
In the article, Carter writes
that while in China he requested
that government officials allow
Chinese students studying over
seas to visit China and be able to
travel back again to their univer
sities. He also called for amnesty
for peaceful protesters involved in
the 1989 pro-democracy move
ment and for reduced sentences
for jailed students, among other
measures.

Although Fang agreed with
these requests, he criticized the
central thrust of the opinion,
printed April 30 in The New York
Times.
Carter writes, "Prime Minister
Li Peng, General Secretary Jiang
Zemin, Foreign Minister Quin
Qichen, Education Minister Li
Tieying and others listened with
patience and close attention to
these suggestions. They assured
me that students can visit China
freely and return abroad."
He adds that the leaders did
not reject "out of hand" all his
suggested human rights improve
ments.
"They (and leaders of other
socialist countries) point out, cor
rectly, that there is a wide range of
human rights, some of which are
respected in their countries and
neglected in the U.S. These
include the right to have a decent
home, job and adequate health
care," the article continues.
But Fang disagreed strongly,
saying instead that human rights
do not vary in different countries.
"I was very disappointed in his
paper. In Tiananmen Square,
many people died. Why did he
never mention that?" he said.
"And he mentioned that Li
Peng and some leaders 'heard' his
speech, but he never said what
their response was. Did they give
him a positive response? No
response is equal to a negative

response," he added.
Fang said he believes that Chi
nese authorities "never felt they
were sorry for the Tiananmen
Massacre," and that Carter was
misled if he believed people in
China could ever have confidence
in the current government again.
Despite his willingness to chal
lenge current and former U.S.
presidents when he disagrees with
them, Fang said he is not a politi
cian by choice.
In addition, he does not like to
be thought of as the leader of the
Chinese democracy movement.
But he acknowledged, "I'm still
a famous dissident in China." He
said he has a responsibility to be
an inspiration to the movement,
even if we doesn't want to be its
leader.
Some Chinese activists have
criticized Fang because he hasn't
stormed into politics to become
the central overseas leader of the
democracy movement.
But Fang seems confident in
his position. "In China, many
times I mentioned the idea of
democracy. . . I still demand free
dom and democracy in China."
Fang said he will continue to
work toward measuring the uni
verse, calling for democratic
change and thinking about his
country.
"Home is still very sad," he
said. "I still remember my friends
and colleagues."
