# ASSU Senate to debate financial issues
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Budgets, budgets and more budgets will
dominate tonight's ASSU Senate meeting.
In addition to next year's budget, several
funding proposals are likely to be debated and
decided during the final meeting of this year's
senate.
The meeting has a four-part, 325-page
agenda, which cost the senate about $500 to
print. The 55 copies produced for the meeting
come to a total of almost 9,000 double-sided
pieces of paper.
The mammoth agenda has raised concern
among senators that this may be the longest
meeting of the entire year — and some senate
meetings this year have already lasted four
and-a-half hours.
Senate chair Solina Kwan acknowledged in
a special senate meeting Tuesday night that
"this has the potential for being a very long
meeting." She urged senators to "do your
homework and read the agenda and budgets
ahead of time to be prepared to ask questions."
Some senators suggested starting the meet
ing an hour earlier than usual, but Kwan said
this was not a feasible option.

The main topics of discussion tonight will
be related to the ASSU's finances. The senate
must approve next year's budget as well as
funding for both the ASSU Program Board
and ASSU Publications Board.
Among the proposals regarding finances
are:
• An amendment by graduate senator Doug
Bone to allocate $1,000 for XTV to televise
senate meetings during fall quarter. If the sen
ate approves this measure, XTV would either
broadcast the meetings live or offer them on a
tape-delay basis.
• Two amendments, also authored by Bone,
to lower the senate chair and administrative
manager salaries by more than $1,000 each.
This would make their salaries equal to those
of next year's Council of Presidents. The new
COP is planning to reduce its salaries after it
takes over.
• A guarantee of funding for a sexual
assault information and resource center cre
ated by the Coalition Against Sexual Assault
and endorsed by both campus political parties.
The center will likely be guaranteed its
$45,000 funding request by the ASSU through
special reserves, senate observers say. More
than $25,000 of that request is for a full-time

sexual-assault response coordinator, who will
probably be senior Susan Epstein, the pro
posal's main author.
• Two different proposals regarding the
United States Student Association, a national
student-lobbying organization.
Bone and senator Jason Moore propose
decreasing funding for the ASSU's activities
with the organization from $3,600 to $900 and
cutting all travel expenses to the association's
conferences. But senator Naomi Onaga, who is
a member of the association's board of direc
tors, proposes increasing the $3,600 figure to
more than $8,000 to support a financial-aid
office.
• An allocation of $100 to fund a public ser
vice retreat at the Buck Estate tomorrow. The
retreat is for student leaders, including cur
rent and incoming senators and other stu
dents who are "active leaders in service organi
zations," said sophomore Felix Tsai, one of the
retreat's organizers.
The senate will also act on several other
issues at tonight's meeting. The spring runoff
election, validated at Tuesday's special meet
ing, is scheduled to be certified and "Students
First" will officially assume office as the COP
at midnight.
