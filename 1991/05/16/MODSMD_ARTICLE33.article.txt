# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S MELODRAMATIC WEEKLY On Stanford days gone by 
### 
IN THE OLD DAYS, THEY HAD
classy ways of firing you. If you
were a communist, they would just
put on a smile, offer you a handshake
and say, "Sorry, you're just not right
for the part," or "Gee, Mr. Miller, I like
this whole dead salesman concept, but
I'm afraid your writing's just not up to
par.
But nowadays there's no tact. They
just look you in the eye, make up some
excuse about drinking with people
under 21 and tell you to clean all the
double-screened water bongs out of
your desk by noon.
This whole Stuart Reges thing has
got me thinking: How do you go about
getting kicked out of the Disneyland of
the North?
Well, I had tried everything —
chewing gum in class, running in the
halls — I even tried painting tiny little
pictures of Yuri Andropov on all the
People's Platform fliers, but nothing
seemed to work.

So, I did what all famous people do
when they come across a situation
they're too yellow-bellied to write
about under their own name — I
wrote a semi-fictional story from the
point of view of a trusted family pet.
Only this time we've replaced the stan
dard cocker spaniel with Robin
Kennedy's Chia Pet, Curly. Let's see
what happens....
[Fade out in impressive visual bar
rage of hazy, sitcom dream sequence
mist]
I haven't been fed for weeks. The
Miracle Gro is right in front of Robin's
face, but does she care? No. All she
cares about is Don and that damn
toupee they sent away for. Says it will
give him a new image. I say it'll give
him a rash.
I've seen a lot go on here. I've seen
fire. I've seen drizzle. I've even seen
those dorks from the Axe Committee
chain-link themselves naked to each
other. (Or was that just one of those
pseudo-sexual, drought-induced hal
lucinations?)
But I've never seen anybody fired
before. I mean, c'mon, isn't this the
university where you break into the
president's office and still get $5,000 as
a Council of Presidents member? Isn't
this the institution where dorm funds
go toward those tacky little umbrellas
for mixed drinks? The school where
Perry Friedman gets a Dean's Award
for public service? The place where
John Manley chains himself to a tower,
like some flaccid intellectual imitation
of a Slaughter album cover?
But, hey, I guess we've all learned a
lot this year. Don learned how to stuff
large bills into his mattress without his
chiropractor letting on. I learned that,
despite the new regulations, calling
yourself a pet when you're really a
plant still qualifies you for federal
funding.
And what did Reges learn? Two
things. First, that it's actually better to
get caught by the police while freaking
out on cocaine — and then construct a
lame story about finding it behind an
old videotape of "Bosom Buddies" —
than to tell the government to "sneck
up." Second, that the week after the
university gets embarrassed on
national television is a bad time to
write taunting prank letters to a drug
czar who's already plenty insecure
about losing to a democrat in Florida.
All of which leads me to the fright
ening conclusion: What will I, as a
Chia Pet, be allowed to do and say in
the Stanford of the future? Will I be
able to supplement my diet with occa
sional catnip-tainted Chia snacks? Will
I be able to advise other Chia Pets to


Joel Stein
A man with
a purpose
grow out their leg sprouts? Will my
Chia "pot" brothers at Lambda Nu be
allowed to exist? Is the University
using the new point system as some
sick genocidal plot to decrease sprout
consumption?
And, furthermore, as the $11.99
Edward Gibbons of this falling Palo
Altan Empire, I must aslc What will
become of our school? Will we wind
up as strewn ramshackles of some
twisted, multicultural version of
"Escape From New York"? Will we

emerge from this academic cataclysm
devoid of faculty, departments and
buildings — with only enough money
to float the Office of Residential Edu
cation and a couple of tents on Roble
Field? Will we fall behind UC-Berke
ley, or will this "100 years, 100 dollars"
campaign really be enough to pay off
U.S. News and World Report?
Alas, why couldn't I be a Chia Pet
somewhere else? Maybe some univer
sity less plagued with troubles, less rid
dled with snotty pseudo-intellectuals
who can't even tell the difference
between the first and the second Dar
ren in "Bewitched." Maybe someplace
that gets out before mid-June?
And once again I feel the heat fall

upon me, the school's other mail
order invertebrate mascot. It's either
sink or swim, replant or wither. So I
had to think quick, and think quick I
did. First, I say we make up for the loss
of federal funds by putting out a series
of highly fashionable Stuart Reges
brand backpacks, replete with secret,
combination-lock pockets. Next, I say
we get rid of those 19 whining MEChA
kids by giving them the Theta
Delt/AEPi house. Well, maybe not.
But as I sit here and worry, my
sprouts turning prematurely gray, I am
relieved by one thought.
I'm gonna beat Reges to the punch,
and make a bundle off of this book
writing thing.
