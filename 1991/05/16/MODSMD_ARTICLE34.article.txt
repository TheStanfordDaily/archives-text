Did you know that your lab part
ner may actually be a beagle? Or that
the innocent-looking woman sitting
next to you in Psychology 1 turns
into a princess at night? It could very
well be true. And to find out, all you
have to do is check out any of the
dorm musicals running this week
end or next — you'll be sure to see
familiar faces singing and dancing
their way into stardom.
Many dorms produce full
fledged musicals every spring, but
they often go unnoticed due to
skimpy publicity funds. Don't be
fooled by low-budget flyers . . .
dorm musical staffs manage to pack
a whole lot of entertainment into
small-scale versions of your favorite

A plethora of dorm pro
ductions will be present
ed on campus over the
next few weeks, several of
which open this weekend.
Clockwise from upper
right: "Pippin," the story
of Charlemagne's son
who returns from college
without a job, is Roble
Hall's "huge" spring pro
duction. "The Princess
Bride," rewritten as a
semi-musical, staged pro
duction will be per
formed by Burbank Hall.
And "Anything Goes," a
free-spirited musical tak
ing place on a cruise, will
be performed by Gover

Dining Hall this weekend.

shows. And some even create origi
nal musical extravaganzas, with
scores, scripts — the works!
But high-quality dorm theater
shouldn't really be a surprise; after
all, all the campus' talented people
have to live somewhere!
So how much do you think all
this talent and fun will cost? $8? $5?
No way! The admission to dorm
shows is usually free, and they'll
even throw in a program to boot.
So what are you waiting for? For

Bag the books and come support
your fellow Stanford students in one
of the many upcoming dorm shows.
The choices are oh-so-tempting ...
Anything Goes — Governor's
Corner
Directed by Tad Glauthier and

Kay Rhee, this bright musical illumi
nates the Christine Ricker Dining
Center beginning this evening. Its
peppy cast of 19 comes from all over
campus to participate in this rousing
Cole Porter production.
The story takes place on a cruise
ship sailing from New York to Lon
don during the dashing 19205. Inter
twined in the plot are gangsters,
evangelists, the upper-crust rich and
a whole slew of tap-dancing passen
gers. Add a dash of intrigue, a tea
spoon of deception and a cupful of
romance. VoiW You have "Anything
Goes," a sappy, sweet musical sure to
keep you humming.
Passion, Pillows and Pusillanimous
People — Branner Hall
Now we know what those infa
mous freshmen do with their spare
time. They don't party; they write
musicals! A bunch of Brannerites
got together to write and compose
this spoof on Stanford life, while
directors Mai-Mai Fox and Suzanne
Fanger pulled together a hearty cast
to perform it.
The plot centers around the
rivalry between Madera and Bran
ner, la "West Side Story." Lo and
behold, Madera girl meets Branner
boy at a fraternity party and (yup,
you guessed it) love filters through
the beer-scented air.
Intermingled with this dilemma
are bit scenes that take place in such
familiar Stanford hangouts as Meyer
Library, the Coffee House and, of
course, the ever-present freshman
dorm. This show promises to make
good fun of Stanford students —
something we could all stand to see
once in a while. Performance dates
are May 24 and 25 at 8 p.m. in the

Branner Lounge. The show is free,
and so are the alliterations.
Pippin — Roble Hall
Nicknamed "the mama of dorm
musicals," everything about this
production is absolutely HUGE. The
cast is huge (a whopping 45 people),
the talent is huge and even the stage,

otherwise known as the Roble court
yard, is way huge. Bring your wide
angle lenses to watch this one.
So what's the story? Director
Raphe Beck describes it as "Charle
magne's son coming home from col
lege without a job." Basically, "Pip
