Did you know that your lab part
ner may actually be a beagle? Or that
the innocent-looking woman sitting
next to you in Psychology 1 turns
into a princess at night? It could very
well be true. And to find out, all you
have to do is check out any of the
dorm musicals running this week
end or next — you'll be sure to see
familiar faces singing and dancing
their way into stardom.
Many dorms produce full
fledged musicals every spring, but
they often go unnoticed due to
skimpy publicity funds. Don't be
fooled by low-budget flyers . . .
dorm musical staffs manage to pack
a whole lot of entertainment into
small-scale versions of your favorite

A plethora of dorm pro
ductions will be present
ed on campus over the
next few weeks, several of
which open this weekend.
Clockwise from upper
right: "Pippin," the story
of Charlemagne's son
who returns from college
without a job, is Roble
Hall's "huge" spring pro
duction. "The Princess
Bride," rewritten as a
semi-musical, staged pro
duction will be per
formed by Burbank Hall.
And "Anything Goes," a
free-spirited musical tak
ing place on a cruise, will
be performed by Gover
nor's Corner at the Ricker
Dining Hall this weekend.

shows. And some even create origi
nal musical extravaganzas, with
scores, scripts — the works!
But high-quality dorm theater
shouldn't really be a surprise; after
all, all the campus' talented people
have to live somewhere!
So how much do you think all
this talent and fun will cost? $8? $5?
No way! The admission to dorm
shows is usually free, and they'll
even throw in a program to boot.
So what are you waiting for? For
get television. Forget the movies.
Bag the books and come support
your fellow Stanford students in one
of the many upcoming dorm shows.
The choices are oh-so-tempting ...
Anything Goes — Governor's
Corner
Directed by Tad Glauthier and

Kay Rhee, this bright musical illumi
nates the Christine Ricker Dining
Center beginning this evening. Its
peppy cast of 19 comes from all over
campus to participate in this rousing
Cole Porter production.
The story takes place on a cruise
ship sailing from New York to Lon
don during the dashing 19205. Inter
twined in the plot are gangsters,
evangelists, the upper-crust rich and
a whole slew of tap-dancing passen
gers. Add a dash of intrigue, a tea
spoon of deception and a cupful of
romance. VoiW You have "Anything
Goes," a sappy, sweet musical sure to
keep you humming.
Passion, Pillows and Pusillanimous
People — Branner Hall
Now we know what those infa
mous freshmen do with their spare
time. They don't party; they write
musicals! A bunch of Brannerites
got together to write and compose
this spoof on Stanford life, while
directors Mai-Mai Fox and Suzanne
Fanger pulled together a hearty cast
to perform it.
The plot centers around the
rivalry between Madera and Bran
ner, la "West Side Story." Lo and
behold, Madera girl meets Branner
boy at a fraternity party and (yup,
you guessed it) love filters through
the beer-scented air.
Intermingled with this dilemma
are bit scenes that take place in such
familiar Stanford hangouts as Meyer
Library, the Coffee House and, of
course, the ever-present freshman
dorm. This show promises to make
good fun of Stanford students —
something we could all stand to see
once in a while. Performance dates
are May 24 and 25 at 8 p.m. in the

Branner Lounge. The show is free,
and so are the alliterations.
Pippin — Roble Hall
Nicknamed "the mama of dorm
musicals," everything about this
production is absolutely HUGE. The
cast is huge (a whopping 45 people),
the talent is huge and even the stage,

otherwise known as the Roble court
yard, is way huge. Bring your wide
angle lenses to watch this one.
So what's the story? Director
Raphe Beck describes it as "Charle
magne's son coming home from col
lege without a job." Basically, "Pip




Illuitration by Jo« Bcltrmn — Dtily
pin" gives us a little history with a
twist — and it's the twist you have to
watch out for! This slightly bizarre tale
won't fail to pique interests and raise
some eyebrows, and as long as May
drizzles stay away tonight, tomorrow
and Saturday at 8 p.m., the show shall
be free for all to see.
Bye-Bye Birdie — Florence
Moore Hall
Well, it's not quite Shakespeare-in
the-Park, but you should still bring a
bundle of blankets to Flo Mo's spring
production, "Bfe-Bye Birdie," which
will be held in the building's court
yard.
Set in the '50s, this show details a
wild publicity scheme for
singer/heartthrob Conrad — more
than loosely based on Elvis Presley —
who has just been drafted. Conrad's
goofy but lovable manager concocts a
seemingly foolproof, profitable plan
— to have Conrad kiss one lucky

female fan before leaving for the war.
The Flo Mo show was cast at the
end of winter quarter and is being per
formed later than other shows in
order to allow cast members the free
dom to balance the performance with
their other obligations. Opening on
The whole Peanuts gang
will dance and frolic their
way through Toy on Hall
— with 'The Spinning
Songimmortalized as the
Peanuts' theme song, no
doubt playing in the hack
ground — this spring.
May 31 and June 1, the show will be
highlighted with "big splashy dance
numbers" and a guest appearance by
members of the Fleet Street Singers.
"You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown" — Tovon Hall

There are few things in life you can
truly count on, but the fact that Char
lie Brown will never actually kick the
football is one of them. Poor oP Char
lie Brown.
The whole Peanuts gang will dance
and frolic their way through Toyon —
no doubt with "The Spinning Song,"
immortalized as the Peanuts' theme
song, playing in the background —
this spring. Recently elected ASSU
Senator Jason Snyder will sing for his
supper as Snoopy and Jon Ploudre will
portray the diagonally striped shirt
clad Good Man himself.
Directed by Julie Strong and Victor
Barclay, "You're a Good Man" will be
performed on May 30 and 31 in the
Toyon Lounge — bring your security
blanket.
The Princess Bride — Burbank
"The Princess Bride" — a musical?
Being performed by a dorm? And per
formed well? Inconceivable!
But true.
Burbank has undertaken the ambi

tious project of staging a "semi-origi
nal" musical version of the classic Rob
Reiner film. This multi-faceted and
Burbank has undertaken
the ambitious project of
staging a 'semi-original
musical version of the clas
sic Rob Reiner film, which
was exciting enough to
hold the attention of even
the most skeptical 9-year
old.
well-crafted story — exciting enough
to hold the attention of even the most
skeptical 9-year old — promises to
captivate Stanford students as well.
Romantics and adventurers alike
will find themselves on the edge of
their seats on Friday and Saturday as
Westley proves, once and for all, that
"death cannot stop true love — it can
only delay it for a while."
