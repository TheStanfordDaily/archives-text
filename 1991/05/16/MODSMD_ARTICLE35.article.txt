IS IT A BALANCING ACT OR EXPERIMENTAL THEATER?
Kids playing with blocks or performance art? We're not sure.
But you can find out at Cowell Theater in San Francisco as
they premiere "Ace Taboo," a new, creative and avant-garde
production that opened yesterday and plays through June 1.
Spring is the season to dance, frolic and raise your voice in
song. And all around campus, that's just what folks are doing. The
a capella singing groups all have their fantabulous spring shows
this week. Mixed Company's show, titled "Booger Patrol," will be
performed with incomparable immaturity tonight in Cubberley
Auditorium at 8 p.m.
Fleet Street Singers celebrate the 10th anniversary of their tal
ented all-male group. In honor of their approaching adolescence
as a group, Fleet Street will perform in Memorial Auditorium on
Tuesday at 8 p.m. (See story, page 6.)
The sweet soprano and alto sounds of Counterpoint will be
yours for the hearing next Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the Christine
Ricker Dining Hall. And, far from ordinary, Everyday People will
wrap up their eventful year with an extravaganza of vocal maneu
vers next Thursday at 8 p.m., outdoors in Memorial Court.
University President Donald Kennedy will contribute to the Stan
ford Symphony Orchestra's Spring Pops Concert in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium tomorrow. Our fearless leader will be accompanied by
the orchestra as he narrates the "Lincoln Portrait"in this concert of
works by famous American composers. (See story, page 4.)
For a stronger rhythm, check out The Stanford Percussion
Ensemble in Dinkelspiel on Saturday afternoon; or, for a little
more soul, try the Jazz Concert, featuring the Stanford Jazz Band
and BAYSIX a little later that evening in Dinkelspiel.
