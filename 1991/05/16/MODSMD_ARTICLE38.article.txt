# Always on her toes
## Interview by June Cohen Photos by Marin Melchior 
### 
Many people dream
about taking off and
traveling around the
world by themselves.
Halifu Osumare
did it.
Many people fantasize about danc
ing to the music of thunderous
applause on a New York stage.
Halifu Osumare's done it.
Many people want to make a differ
ence, to influence and improve the lives
of others.
Halifu Osumare does it.
A teacher, choreographer and for
mer dancer, Osumare has led an envi
able life.
For the past 10 years, Osumare has
been teaching both jazz dance and
African-Caribbean roots of jazz to
crowded classes of Stanford students.
But her proud, confident manner
speaks of experience that extends far
beyond the walls of Roble Gym.
Osumare's energy and enthusiasm
are apparent even in conversation. Her
dark eyes sparkle knowingly as she
speaks, beckoning you in, inviting
your questions, convincing you that
that all the world's wisdom and
unimaginable adventures are stored
safely behind her dancing eyes.
But even if you were to imagine the
most fascinating and exotic adventures
you could think of, they probably
wouldn't measure up to her real life.
Osumare has traveled solo all over
the globe, immersing herself in other

cultures. She has taught
dance and performed on
stages from Greenwich Vil
lage in New York to Ghana
in West Africa. Along the
way, she has studied with
some of the world's greatest
dance masters and has
gained appreciable knowl
edge, both of herself and the
world.
A San Francisco native,
Osumare returned to the

Bay Area in the late '70s and opened
her own international, ethnically
diverse dance studio in Oakland before
joining the faculty at Stanford in 1981.
Deeply committed to the advance
ment of African-Americans in the arts,
Osumare became the coordinator of
the Committee on Black Performing
Arts at Stanford in 1981 and has since
founded Black Choreographers Mov
ing Toward the 21st Century, a festival
based in both San Francisco and Los
Angeles that highlights the work of
young, talented and frequently over
looked black choreographers across
the country.
Talking with her, it quickly
becomes clear that the dedication and
energy that mark her personality have
shaped the rest of her life as well.
Always a pioneer, Osumare "has not
been afraid of life. I've just met it head
on and gone into it tearless. That's the
only way I know how to do it."

Intermission: I know you taught
dance at the University of Ghana. Is
that where you were first introduced to
traditional forms of African dance?
Halifu Osumare: No. I was introduced
to African dance by seeing the
National Dance Company of Guinea,
one of the first African dance compa
nies to tour America and Europe in the
late '60s. Before that I had studied
what is now called African-derived
dance forms; movement inspired by
the Caribbean Islands. I had studied
the [Katherine] Dunham technique
before going to West Africa, and it was
through this exposure that I really got
a sense of what African dance is about
— its connectedness to life and the
processes of life, the socialization pro-

cess of life.
If you are in a culture where dance
is very much a part of the people's lives
and their identity and their expression,
then each stage of your life is involved
in dance from birth to death. I really
wanted to go and experience that cul
ture, so individually — no fellowship,
no scholarship — I just saved my
money and went to West Africa.
I did affiliate myself with the Uni
versity of Ghana. I enrolled purely as
an auditor in classes there. I wanted to
study traditional Ghanaian dance
forms. They had African studies as a
discipline, and within that the school
of dance, music and drama. So that
you had qualified teachers for the var
ious forms of dance that make up
Ghana — the dances of the different
ethnic groups — the Ashanti, the Ewe.
While 1 was there they became familiar
with me and my dance experience and
they asked me if I would teach while I
was doing my own study.
1 taught what 1 would now call

African-Ameri
can dance; it was
modern dance
training with a
strong jazz em
phasis. And I
would also teach
them black Amer
ican social dance
which is the
closest form we
have here that
retained African
movement styles.
I: Do you see
dance as a form
of self-expres
sion or a form

of cultural expression? What role does
dance play in your life?
HO: I can't separate the two. Self and
culture, it's like one and the same to
me. I think African-Americans are
much more aware of that — that
insepararability of culture and per
sonal identity. And it's because we've
had to be. There's no way you could
not know you're a black person in this
culture; historically, we've had to be
very self conscious of who we were as a
culture and as a race.
I think white people in America
have had the luxury of not thinking of
themselves in a cultural way because the
entire lifestyle reinforces that culture.
You don't have to think about your cul
ture because everything — almost all

the images, the way
the education sys
tem is set up —
everything rein
forces what you first
learned in your
home. You can have
the luxury of think
ing of yourself
totally as a person,
but that doesn't
mean that culture
hasn't been there,

and has not been a part of your cultural
identity. It just means that the aware
ness h*s not been there.
I: What is your relationship with the
black community at Stanford?
HO: I think I've had a very strong rela
tionship with the black community at
Stanford. I've just recently resigned
from my position as program coordi
nator of the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts. My position as part-time
administrator — while I was still
teaching here — put me right at the
center of helping students devise pro
grams for what they wanted to do, in
terms of expressing themselves.
I feel that in my 10 years here as
program coordinator I was able to help
the committee go from a program that
was utilized entirely by black students
on campus to having more of a cam
pus-wide profile.
I: Do you think the relation between
form and function in today's dance in

the United States is different than it is
in tradiitonal African dance?
HO: Well, for African-Americans, I
think that not only have some of the
movement styles have been retained,
but some of what determines dance
aesthetic principles. Those principles
are that you don't just dance for
dance's sake, but you dance to
heighten your own energy and to
heighten the group's energy. You have
a purpose behind dancing. It's a kind
of group consciousness-raising that
dance is used for in Africa, and I think
that purpose still remains in African-
American.
When you look at traditional
African society and you look at the way
dance is used not only for the secular
aspect of life, but also the religious, the
sacred, you see a much more delin
eated aspect of what that form and
function is all about — there are
dances for certain occasions, for cer
tain times of the year. Form and func
tion in that sense is much more defini
tive in traditional dances. When we say
that we have retained some of that here
in America, it is in the broadest sense
of the term, in that we use dance for
consciousness-raising and ultimately
that's what it's used for in Africa as
well.

I: In your own choreography, do you
find that your work tends to revolve
around a theme or is it more dance for
dancing's sake?
HO: Well, being an African-American,
I draw upon all the various approaches
and the aesthetics I've grown up under,
which is not only African but Euro
pean as well. I find that I create dances
from different perspectives; each dance
is a statement unto itself and will have
its own purpose and reason for being.
I tend to go more toward dance in a
functional sense in that I want to say
something when I choreograph.
I: Do you have any role models or any
one whose work you particularly
admire?
HO: Well of course there's Ruth Beck
ford and Nantsizi Cayou and Ed Mock
... But I tell you I never met anyone
who really inspired me; who made me
say, "I want to follow this person. This
is my guru," until I met Katherine
Dunham. I met her for the first time in
1987 when she visited Stanford. And I
thought, "This is a person I can totally
identify with." When I met her, she was
just so much greater than I imagined.
She is the closest living person I know
who is truly self-realized. She has
found a way to integrate mind, body
and spirit in a way I've never encoun

tered in anyone else I've met. She is my
ultimate role model. Not only in the
discipline of dance, but in the disci
pline of life. It's taken all this time to
find her; and it's coming at the tail end
of my performing career. She's my
spirit mother.
1: Where did you receive your dance
training?
HO: Well, I grew up in San Francisco,
and I started dancing in high school. I
was lucky enough to go to a high
school that had a trained modern
dance teacher who talked the adminis
tration into letting her start a dance
program within the [physical educa
tion] program. So I started with her
and she really gave us a sense of the
integrity of dance as an art.
I: Is high school kind of late for a
dancer to start out?
HO: Well, it depends. For classical bal
let, oftentimes they say you should
start as a young child. But many mod
ern dancers start in their adult years —
or late teens — so that's a myth in a
way. Although it does help to start
younger, modern dance — which
often requires more than just skills in
terms of executing steps — takes inter

pretation and a knowledge of yourself.
I think it's important that a dancer
have lived some life.
However, in some cultures you start
dancing on your mother's back. The
mother straps the baby to her back and
participates in dance ceremonies; you
start dancing even before you can even
walk.
So when you start is relative to the
culture. In America, where the arts are
very seperate from the socialization
process of growing up, we consciously
choose to start dance at certain times.
I: Where did you receive the rest of
your dance training?
HO: 1 think I pieced together the rest
of my training as a dancer/teacher.
During college, I went to other studios
at night, as any serious dance student
does. I have a strong Katherine Dun
ham training and I've studied with
many of the masters in the Bay Area.
Another woman who had a particu
larly strong influence on me was Nant
sizi Cayou; she was my mentor at col
lege, and she's still there today.
When I was in Europe I met up
with some of the best American chore
ographers. It's kind of ironic because I
got trained by some of the best New
York choreographers by going to
Europe. Being a black performer I was
seen as a commodity in the European
dance scene. It was the Josephine
Baker syndrome: you know, (mocking
a European accent) "Ah, the black
woman exotica!" So I could pretty
much write my own ticket.
I: And while you were in Europe, you
also taught at the Ballet Academy of
Stockholm?
HO: That's another life! This preceded
Africa. From '69 to '71 I lived in

Europe. The first year I traveled
around just being a hippie — they had
them in those days. Talk about
rebelling against our parents! My gen
eration paved the way for you guys. It
was much more rigid when I was your
age.
There were a lot of people traveling
around Europe and there was a little
circuit everyone was traveling around
on. Anyway, I finally ended up in
Copenhagen for one year — again,
being a pioneer. I met up with another
American and we started a dance com
pany of Danish girls because there
wasn't very much happening at that
time on the contemporary dance
scene. I taught at various dance studios
and then I was invited by the Ballet
Academy of Stockholm to come and
teach jazz dance there, so I went for a
year.
I don't know where they are finan
cially now, but Sweden had quite a bit
of money then — they imported a lot
of American dance teachers, and it
really upgraded the contemporary
dance in their country I taught there
for a year, then I finally got sick of
Europe and decided to come back.
I: After visiting Europe and Africa, you
were a soloist with the Rod Rogers
Dance Company in New York; what
style of dance was that?
HO: Rod Rogers is basically a modern
dance company that's been around for
25 years. When I came back to this
country from West Africa, I lived on
the East Coast for about two years and
I danced for Rod for about a year-and
a-half. He was a very important voice
in the dance scene as a black man in
modern dance. Rod is a prime example
of an African-American choreogra
pher that again drew on all his
resources; he had an eclectic repertoire
and he did not feel he had to be put
into any one category.
I: Did you come to Stanford after that
or did you stay in New York?
HO: That's when I started my own
dance studio in Oakland — which is
another life! It's called CitiCentre
Dance Theater. When we started, we

called it Everybody's Creative Arts
Center — and that was indicative of
my philosophy. It was strongly multi
cultural — before multicultural was
even talked about, before diversity was
even discussed — I started this studio
that had not only various forms of
Afrid&n dance but modern, ballet and
jazz — the three main staples here in
America — along with Balinese,
Indonesian, Mexican Folk ...

I wanted people to be able to come
and experience any type of dance that
existed on the planet, that was my
whole artistic focus putting together
that studio. It worked for a time, but
ultimately, fiscal responsibilty took
over and we really had to hone it down.
I: You've just resigned as program
coordinator here, is there a new pro
ject you're taking on?

HO: I just started graduate school this
spring. I'm going into a new field —
which isn't really new, but it's new in
terms of my academic training. I'm
doing a special major at San Francisco
State on the anthropology of dance.
I: Do you intend to do field work over
seas again?
HO: Not at the master's level, but at
the doctorate level I'm sure I will. My

region will definitely be Africa or the
Caribbean. You know, I'm amazed at
how much I could bring to my own
education from my experiences. For
many students the idea of field work is
in the future; but I can go back over
my own field work and use that as
sources for my papers. I've kept'a diary
since I left for Europe in '69, so I have
all of my notes.
You know, I'm really glad I traveled

when I did, because since I returned to
the West Coast I've been doing a lot of
instituion building — starting Citi-
Centre, coming to Stanford and devel
oping the black performing arts on
campus, founding Black Choreogra
phers Moving and having that take
place in two different cities. All that's
taken being rooted, so I'm glad I did
the moving around when I was
younger.

which isn't really new, but it's new in
terms of my academic training. I'm
doing a special major at San Francisco
State on the anthropology of dance.
I: Do you intend to do field work over
seas again?
HO: Not at the master's level, but at
the doctorate level I'm sure I will. My

region will definitely be Africa or the
Caribbean. You know, I'm amazed at
how much I could bring to my own
education from my experiences. For
many students the idea of field work is
in the future; but I can go back over
my own field work and use that as
sources for my papers. I've kept'a diary
since I left for Europe in '69, so I have
all of my notes.
You know, I'm really glad I traveled

when I did, because since I returned to
the West Coast I've been doing a lot of
instituion building — starting Citi-
Centre, coming to Stanford and devel
oping the black performing arts on
campus, founding Black Choreogra
phers Moving and having that take
place in two different cities. All that's
taken being rooted, so I'm glad I did
the moving around when I was
younger.
Many people dream
about taking off and
traveling around the
world by themselves.
Halifu Osumare
did it.
Many people fantasize about danc
ing to the music of thunderous
applause on a New York stage.
Halifu Osumare's done it.
Many people want to make a differ
ence, to influence and improve the lives
of others.
Halifu Osumare does it.
A teacher, choreographer and for
mer dancer, Osumare has led an envi
able life.
For the past 10 years, Osumare has
been teaching both jazz dance and
African-Caribbean roots of jazz to
crowded classes of Stanford students.
But her proud, confident manner
speaks of experience that extends far
beyond the walls of Roble Gym.
Osumare's energy and enthusiasm
are apparent even in conversation. Her
dark eyes sparkle knowingly as she
speaks, beckoning you in, inviting
your questions, convincing you that
that all the world's wisdom and
unimaginable adventures are stored
safely behind her dancing eyes.
But even if you were to imagine the
most fascinating and exotic adventures
you could think of, they probably
wouldn't measure up to her real life.
Osumare has traveled solo all over
the globe, immersing herself in other

cultures. She has taught
dance and performed on
stages from Greenwich Vil
lage in New York to Ghana
in West Africa. Along the
way, she has studied with
some of the world's greatest
dance masters and has
gained appreciable knowl
edge, both of herself and the
world.
A San Francisco native,
Osumare returned to the

Bay Area in the late '70s and opened
her own international, ethnically
diverse dance studio in Oakland before
joining the faculty at Stanford in 1981.
Deeply committed to the advance
ment of African-Americans in the arts,
Osumare became the coordinator of
the Committee on Black Performing
Arts at Stanford in 1981 and has since
founded Black Choreographers Mov
ing Toward the 21st Century, a festival
based in both San Francisco and Los
Angeles that highlights the work of
young, talented and frequently over
looked black choreographers across
the country.
Talking with her, it quickly
becomes clear that the dedication and
energy that mark her personality have
shaped the rest of her life as well.
Always a pioneer, Osumare "has not
been afraid of life. I've just met it head
on and gone into it tearless. That's the
only way I know how to do it."

Intermission: I know you taught
dance at the University of Ghana. Is
that where you were first introduced to
traditional forms of African dance?
Halifu Osumare: No. I was introduced
to African dance by seeing the
National Dance Company of Guinea,
one of the first African dance compa
nies to tour America and Europe in the
late '60s. Before that I had studied
what is now called African-derived
dance forms; movement inspired by
the Caribbean Islands. I had studied
the [Katherine] Dunham technique
before going to West Africa, and it was
through this exposure that I really got
a sense of what African dance is about
— its connectedness to life and the
processes of life, the socialization pro-

cess of life.
If you are in a culture where dance
is very much a part of the people's lives
and their identity and their expression,
then each stage of your life is involved
in dance from birth to death. I really
wanted to go and experience that cul
ture, so individually — no fellowship,
no scholarship — I just saved my
money and went to West Africa.
I did affiliate myself with the Uni
versity of Ghana. I enrolled purely as
an auditor in classes there. I wanted to
study traditional Ghanaian dance
forms. They had African studies as a
discipline, and within that the school
of dance, music and drama. So that
you had qualified teachers for the var
ious forms of dance that make up
Ghana — the dances of the different
ethnic groups — the Ashanti, the Ewe.
While 1 was there they became familiar
with me and my dance experience and
they asked me if I would teach while I
was doing my own study.
1 taught what 1 would now call

African-Ameri
can dance; it was
modern dance
training with a
strong jazz em
phasis. And I
would also teach
them black Amer
ican social dance
which is the
closest form we
have here that
retained African
movement styles.
I: Do you see
dance as a form
of self-expres
sion or a form

of cultural expression? What role does
dance play in your life?
HO: I can't separate the two. Self and
culture, it's like one and the same to
me. I think African-Americans are
much more aware of that — that
insepararability of culture and per
sonal identity. And it's because we've
had to be. There's no way you could
not know you're a black person in this
culture; historically, we've had to be
very self conscious of who we were as a
culture and as a race.
I think white people in America
have had the luxury of not thinking of
themselves in a cultural way because the
entire lifestyle reinforces that culture.
You don't have to think about your cul
ture because everything — almost all

the images, the way
the education sys
tem is set up —
everything rein
forces what you first
learned in your
home. You can have
the luxury of think
ing of yourself
totally as a person,
but that doesn't
mean that culture
hasn't been there,

and has not been a part of your cultural
identity. It just means that the aware
ness h*s not been there.
I: What is your relationship with the
black community at Stanford?
HO: I think I've had a very strong rela
tionship with the black community at
Stanford. I've just recently resigned
from my position as program coordi
nator of the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts. My position as part-time
administrator — while I was still
teaching here — put me right at the
center of helping students devise pro
grams for what they wanted to do, in
terms of expressing themselves.
I feel that in my 10 years here as
program coordinator I was able to help
the committee go from a program that
was utilized entirely by black students
on campus to having more of a cam
pus-wide profile.
I: Do you think the relation between
form and function in today's dance in

the United States is different than it is
in tradiitonal African dance?
HO: Well, for African-Americans, I
think that not only have some of the
movement styles have been retained,
but some of what determines dance
aesthetic principles. Those principles
are that you don't just dance for
dance's sake, but you dance to
heighten your own energy and to
heighten the group's energy. You have
a purpose behind dancing. It's a kind
of group consciousness-raising that
dance is used for in Africa, and I think
that purpose still remains in African-
American.
When you look at traditional
African society and you look at the way
dance is used not only for the secular
aspect of life, but also the religious, the
sacred, you see a much more delin
eated aspect of what that form and
function is all about — there are
dances for certain occasions, for cer
tain times of the year. Form and func
tion in that sense is much more defini
tive in traditional dances. When we say
that we have retained some of that here
in America, it is in the broadest sense
of the term, in that we use dance for
consciousness-raising and ultimately
that's what it's used for in Africa as
well.

I: In your own choreography, do you
find that your work tends to revolve
around a theme or is it more dance for
dancing's sake?
HO: Well, being an African-American,
I draw upon all the various approaches
and the aesthetics I've grown up under,
which is not only African but Euro
pean as well. I find that I create dances
from different perspectives; each dance
is a statement unto itself and will have
its own purpose and reason for being.
I tend to go more toward dance in a
functional sense in that I want to say
something when I choreograph.
I: Do you have any role models or any
one whose work you particularly
admire?
HO: Well of course there's Ruth Beck
ford and Nantsizi Cayou and Ed Mock
... But I tell you I never met anyone
who really inspired me; who made me
say, "I want to follow this person. This
is my guru," until I met Katherine
Dunham. I met her for the first time in
1987 when she visited Stanford. And I
thought, "This is a person I can totally
identify with." When I met her, she was
just so much greater than I imagined.
She is the closest living person I know
who is truly self-realized. She has
found a way to integrate mind, body
and spirit in a way I've never encoun

tered in anyone else I've met. She is my
ultimate role model. Not only in the
discipline of dance, but in the disci
pline of life. It's taken all this time to
find her; and it's coming at the tail end
of my performing career. She's my
spirit mother.
1: Where did you receive your dance
training?
HO: Well, I grew up in San Francisco,
and I started dancing in high school. I
was lucky enough to go to a high
school that had a trained modern
dance teacher who talked the adminis
tration into letting her start a dance
program within the [physical educa
tion] program. So I started with her
and she really gave us a sense of the
integrity of dance as an art.
I: Is high school kind of late for a
dancer to start out?
HO: Well, it depends. For classical bal
let, oftentimes they say you should
start as a young child. But many mod
ern dancers start in their adult years —
or late teens — so that's a myth in a
way. Although it does help to start
younger, modern dance — which
often requires more than just skills in
terms of executing steps — takes inter

pretation and a knowledge of yourself.
I think it's important that a dancer
have lived some life.
However, in some cultures you start
dancing on your mother's back. The
mother straps the baby to her back and
participates in dance ceremonies; you
start dancing even before you can even
walk.
So when you start is relative to the
culture. In America, where the arts are
very seperate from the socialization
process of growing up, we consciously
choose to start dance at certain times.
I: Where did you receive the rest of
your dance training?
HO: 1 think I pieced together the rest
of my training as a dancer/teacher.
During college, I went to other studios
at night, as any serious dance student
does. I have a strong Katherine Dun
ham training and I've studied with
many of the masters in the Bay Area.
Another woman who had a particu
larly strong influence on me was Nant
sizi Cayou; she was my mentor at col
lege, and she's still there today.
When I was in Europe I met up
with some of the best American chore
ographers. It's kind of ironic because I
got trained by some of the best New
York choreographers by going to
Europe. Being a black performer I was
seen as a commodity in the European
dance scene. It was the Josephine
Baker syndrome: you know, (mocking
a European accent) "Ah, the black
woman exotica!" So I could pretty
much write my own ticket.
I: And while you were in Europe, you
also taught at the Ballet Academy of
Stockholm?
HO: That's another life! This preceded
Africa. From '69 to '71 I lived in

Europe. The first year I traveled
around just being a hippie — they had
them in those days. Talk about
rebelling against our parents! My gen
eration paved the way for you guys. It
was much more rigid when I was your
age.
There were a lot of people traveling
around Europe and there was a little
circuit everyone was traveling around
on. Anyway, I finally ended up in
Copenhagen for one year — again,
being a pioneer. I met up with another
American and we started a dance com
pany of Danish girls because there
wasn't very much happening at that
time on the contemporary dance
scene. I taught at various dance studios
and then I was invited by the Ballet
Academy of Stockholm to come and
teach jazz dance there, so I went for a
year.
I don't know where they are finan
cially now, but Sweden had quite a bit
of money then — they imported a lot
of American dance teachers, and it
really upgraded the contemporary
dance in their country I taught there
for a year, then I finally got sick of
Europe and decided to come back.
I: After visiting Europe and Africa, you
were a soloist with the Rod Rogers
Dance Company in New York; what
style of dance was that?
HO: Rod Rogers is basically a modern
dance company that's been around for
25 years. When I came back to this
country from West Africa, I lived on
the East Coast for about two years and
I danced for Rod for about a year-and
a-half. He was a very important voice
in the dance scene as a black man in
modern dance. Rod is a prime example
of an African-American choreogra
pher that again drew on all his
resources; he had an eclectic repertoire
and he did not feel he had to be put
into any one category.
I: Did you come to Stanford after that
or did you stay in New York?
HO: That's when I started my own
dance studio in Oakland — which is
another life! It's called CitiCentre
Dance Theater. When we started, we

called it Everybody's Creative Arts
Center — and that was indicative of
my philosophy. It was strongly multi
cultural — before multicultural was
even talked about, before diversity was
even discussed — I started this studio
that had not only various forms of
Afrid&n dance but modern, ballet and
jazz — the three main staples here in
America — along with Balinese,
Indonesian, Mexican Folk ...

I wanted people to be able to come
and experience any type of dance that
existed on the planet, that was my
whole artistic focus putting together
that studio. It worked for a time, but
ultimately, fiscal responsibilty took
over and we really had to hone it down.
I: You've just resigned as program
coordinator here, is there a new pro
ject you're taking on?

HO: I just started graduate school this
spring. I'm going into a new field —
which isn't really new, but it's new in
terms of my academic training. I'm
doing a special major at San Francisco
State on the anthropology of dance.
I: Do you intend to do field work over
seas again?
HO: Not at the master's level, but at
the doctorate level I'm sure I will. My

region will definitely be Africa or the
Caribbean. You know, I'm amazed at
how much I could bring to my own
education from my experiences. For

resources; he had an eclectic repertoire
and he did not feel he had to be put
into any one category.
I: Did you come to Stanford after that
or did you stay in New York?
HO: That's when I started my own
dance studio in Oakland — which is
another life! It's called CitiCentre
Dance Theater. When we started, we

called it Everybody's Creative Arts
Center — and that was indicative of
my philosophy. It was strongly multi
cultural — before multicultural was
even talked about, before diversity was
even discussed — I started this studio
that had not only various forms of
Afrid&n dance but modern, ballet and
jazz — the three main staples here in
America — along with Balinese,
Indonesian, Mexican Folk ...

I wanted people to be able to come
and experience any type of dance that
existed on the planet, that was my
whole artistic focus putting together
that studio. It worked for a time, but
ultimately, fiscal responsibilty took
over and we really had to hone it down.
I: You've just resigned as program
coordinator here, is there a new pro
ject you're taking on?

HO: I just started graduate school this
spring. I'm going into a new field —
which isn't really new, but it's new in
terms of my academic training. I'm
doing a special major at San Francisco
State on the anthropology of dance.
I: Do you intend to do field work over
seas again?
HO: Not at the master's level, but at
the doctorate level I'm sure I will. My

region will definitely be Africa or the
Caribbean. You know, I'm amazed at
how much I could bring to my own
education from my experiences. For
many students the idea of field work is
in the future; but I can go back over
my own field work and use that as
sources for my papers. I've kept'a diary
since I left for Europe in '69, so I have
all of my notes.
You know, I'm really glad I traveled

when I did, because since I returned to
the West Coast I've been doing a lot of
instituion building — starting Citi-
Centre, coming to Stanford and devel
oping the black performing arts on
campus, founding Black Choreogra
phers Moving and having that take
place in two different cities. All that's
taken being rooted, so I'm glad I did
the moving around when I was
younger.
Many people dream
about taking off and
traveling around the
world by themselves.
Halifu Osumare
did it.
Many people fantasize about danc
ing to the music of thunderous
applause on a New York stage.
Halifu Osumare's done it.
Many people want to make a differ
ence, to influence and improve the lives
of others.
Halifu Osumare does it.
A teacher, choreographer and for
mer dancer, Osumare has led an envi
able life.
For the past 10 years, Osumare has
been teaching both jazz dance and
African-Caribbean roots of jazz to
crowded classes of Stanford students.
But her proud, confident manner
speaks of experience that extends far
beyond the walls of Roble Gym.
Osumare's energy and enthusiasm
are apparent even in conversation. Her
dark eyes sparkle knowingly as she
speaks, beckoning you in, inviting
your questions, convincing you that
that all the world's wisdom and
unimaginable adventures are stored
safely behind her dancing eyes.
But even if you were to imagine the
most fascinating and exotic adventures
you could think of, they probably
wouldn't measure up to her real life.
Osumare has traveled solo all over
the globe, immersing herself in other

cultures. She has taught
dance and performed on
stages from Greenwich Vil
lage in New York to Ghana
in West Africa. Along the
way, she has studied with
some of the world's greatest
dance masters and has
gained appreciable knowl
edge, both of herself and the
world.
A San Francisco native,
Osumare returned to the

Bay Area in the late '70s and opened
her own international, ethnically
diverse dance studio in Oakland before
joining the faculty at Stanford in 1981.
Deeply committed to the advance
ment of African-Americans in the arts,
Osumare became the coordinator of
the Committee on Black Performing
Arts at Stanford in 1981 and has since
founded Black Choreographers Mov
ing Toward the 21st Century, a festival
based in both San Francisco and Los
Angeles that highlights the work of
young, talented and frequently over
looked black choreographers across
the country.
Talking with her, it quickly
becomes clear that the dedication and
energy that mark her personality have
shaped the rest of her life as well.
Always a pioneer, Osumare "has not
been afraid of life. I've just met it head
on and gone into it tearless. That's the
only way I know how to do it."

Intermission: I know you taught
dance at the University of Ghana. Is
that where you were first introduced to
traditional forms of African dance?
Halifu Osumare: No. I was introduced
to African dance by seeing the
National Dance Company of Guinea,
one of the first African dance compa
nies to tour America and Europe in the
late '60s. Before that I had studied
what is now called African-derived
dance forms; movement inspired by
the Caribbean Islands. I had studied
the [Katherine] Dunham technique
before going to West Africa, and it was
through this exposure that I really got
a sense of what African dance is about
— its connectedness to life and the
processes of life, the socialization pro-

cess of life.
If you are in a culture where dance
is very much a part of the people's lives
and their identity and their expression,
then each stage of your life is involved
in dance from birth to death. I really
wanted to go and experience that cul
ture, so individually — no fellowship,
no scholarship — I just saved my
money and went to West Africa.
I did affiliate myself with the Uni
versity of Ghana. I enrolled purely as
an auditor in classes there. I wanted to
study traditional Ghanaian dance
forms. They had African studies as a
discipline, and within that the school
of dance, music and drama. So that
you had qualified teachers for the var
ious forms of dance that make up
Ghana — the dances of the different
ethnic groups — the Ashanti, the Ewe.
While 1 was there they became familiar
with me and my dance experience and
they asked me if I would teach while I
was doing my own study.
1 taught what 1 would now call

African-Ameri
can dance; it was
modern dance
training with a
strong jazz em
phasis. And I
would also teach
them black Amer
ican social dance
which is the
closest form we
have here that
retained African
movement styles.
I: Do you see
dance as a form
of self-expres
sion or a form

of cultural expression? What role does
dance play in your life?
HO: I can't separate the two. Self and
culture, it's like one and the same to
me. I think African-Americans are
much more aware of that — that
insepararability of culture and per
sonal identity. And it's because we've
had to be. There's no way you could
not know you're a black person in this
culture; historically, we've had to be
very self conscious of who we were as a
culture and as a race.
I think white people in America
have had the luxury of not thinking of
themselves in a cultural way because the
entire lifestyle reinforces that culture.
You don't have to think about your cul
ture because everything — almost all

the images, the way
the education sys
tem is set up —
everything rein
forces what you first
learned in your
home. You can have
the luxury of think
ing of yourself
totally as a person,
but that doesn't
mean that culture
hasn't been there,

and has not been a part of your cultural
identity. It just means that the aware
ness h*s not been there.
I: What is your relationship with the
black community at Stanford?
HO: I think I've had a very strong rela
tionship with the black community at
Stanford. I've just recently resigned
from my position as program coordi
nator of the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts. My position as part-time
administrator — while I was still
teaching here — put me right at the
center of helping students devise pro
grams for what they wanted to do, in
terms of expressing themselves.
I feel that in my 10 years here as
program coordinator I was able to help
the committee go from a program that
was utilized entirely by black students
on campus to having more of a cam
pus-wide profile.
I: Do you think the relation between
form and function in today's dance in

the United States is different than it is
in tradiitonal African dance?
HO: Well, for African-Americans, I
think that not only have some of the
movement styles have been retained,
but some of what determines dance
aesthetic principles. Those principles
are that you don't just dance for
dance's sake, but you dance to
heighten your own energy and to
heighten the group's energy. You have
a purpose behind dancing. It's a kind
of group consciousness-raising that
dance is used for in Africa, and I think
that purpose still remains in African-
American.
When you look at traditional
African society and you look at the way
dance is used not only for the secular
aspect of life, but also the religious, the
sacred, you see a much more delin
eated aspect of what that form and
function is all about — there are
dances for certain occasions, for cer
tain times of the year. Form and func
tion in that sense is much more defini
tive in traditional dances. When we say
that we have retained some of that here
in America, it is in the broadest sense
of the term, in that we use dance for
consciousness-raising and ultimately
that's what it's used for in Africa as
well.

I: In your own choreography, do you
find that your work tends to revolve
around a theme or is it more dance for
dancing's sake?
HO: Well, being an African-American,
I draw upon all the various approaches
and the aesthetics I've grown up under,
which is not only African but Euro
pean as well. I find that I create dances
from different perspectives; each dance
is a statement unto itself and will have
its own purpose and reason for being.
I tend to go more toward dance in a
functional sense in that I want to say
something when I choreograph.
I: Do you have any role models or any
one whose work you particularly
admire?
HO: Well of course there's Ruth Beck
ford and Nantsizi Cayou and Ed Mock
... But I tell you I never met anyone
who really inspired me; who made me
say, "I want to follow this person. This
is my guru," until I met Katherine
Dunham. I met her for the first time in
1987 when she visited Stanford. And I
thought, "This is a person I can totally
identify with." When I met her, she was
just so much greater than I imagined.
She is the closest living person I know
who is truly self-realized. She has
found a way to integrate mind, body
and spirit in a way I've never encoun

tered in anyone else I've met. She is my
ultimate role model. Not only in the
discipline of dance, but in the disci
pline of life. It's taken all this time to
find her; and it's coming at the tail end
of my performing career. She's my
spirit mother.
1: Where did you receive your dance
training?
HO: Well, I grew up in San Francisco,
and I started dancing in high school. I
was lucky enough to go to a high
school that had a trained modern
dance teacher who talked the adminis
tration into letting her start a dance
program within the [physical educa
tion] program. So I started with her
and she really gave us a sense of the
integrity of dance as an art.
I: Is high school kind of late for a
dancer to start out?
HO: Well, it depends. For classical bal
let, oftentimes they say you should
start as a young child. But many mod
ern dancers start in their adult years —
or late teens — so that's a myth in a
way. Although it does help to start
younger, modern dance — which
often requires more than just skills in
terms of executing steps — takes inter

pretation and a knowledge of yourself.
I think it's important that a dancer
have lived some life.
However, in some cultures you start
dancing on your mother's back. The
mother straps the baby to her back and
participates in dance ceremonies; you
start dancing even before you can even
walk.
So when you start is relative to the
culture. In America, where the arts are
very seperate from the socialization
process of growing up, we consciously
choose to start dance at certain times.
I: Where did you receive the rest of
your dance training?
HO: 1 think I pieced together the rest
of my training as a dancer/teacher.
During college, I went to other studios
at night, as any serious dance student
does. I have a strong Katherine Dun
ham training and I've studied with
many of the masters in the Bay Area.
Another woman who had a particu
larly strong influence on me was Nant
sizi Cayou; she was my mentor at col
lege, and she's still there today.
When I was in Europe I met up
with some of the best American chore
ographers. It's kind of ironic because I
got trained by some of the best New
York choreographers by going to
Europe. Being a black performer I was
seen as a commodity in the European
dance scene. It was the Josephine
Baker syndrome: you know, (mocking
a European accent) "Ah, the black
woman exotica!" So I could pretty
much write my own ticket.
I: And while you were in Europe, you
also taught at the Ballet Academy of
Stockholm?
HO: That's another life! This preceded
Africa. From '69 to '71 I lived in

Europe. The first year I traveled
around just being a hippie — they had
them in those days. Talk about
rebelling against our parents! My gen
eration paved the way for you guys. It
was much more rigid when I was your
age.
There were a lot of people traveling
around Europe and there was a little
circuit everyone was traveling around
on. Anyway, I finally ended up in
Copenhagen for one year — again,
being a pioneer. I met up with another
American and we started a dance com
pany of Danish girls because there
wasn't very much happening at that
time on the contemporary dance
scene. I taught at various dance studios
and then I was invited by the Ballet
Academy of Stockholm to come and
teach jazz dance there, so I went for a
year.
I don't know where they are finan
cially now, but Sweden had quite a bit
of money then — they imported a lot
of American dance teachers, and it
really upgraded the contemporary
dance in their country I taught there
for a year, then I finally got sick of
Europe and decided to come back.
I: After visiting Europe and Africa, you
were a soloist with the Rod Rogers
Dance Company in New York; what
style of dance was that?
HO: Rod Rogers is basically a modern
dance company that's been around for
25 years. When I came back to this
country from West Africa, I lived on
the East Coast for about two years and
I danced for Rod for about a year-and
a-half. He was a very important voice
in the dance scene as a black man in
modern dance. Rod is a prime example
of an African-American choreogra
pher that again drew on all his
resources; he had an eclectic repertoire
and he did not feel he had to be put
into any one category.
I: Did you come to Stanford after that
or did you stay in New York?
HO: That's when I started my own
dance studio in Oakland — which is
another life! It's called CitiCentre
Dance Theater. When we started, we

called it Everybody's Creative Arts

existed on the planet, that was my
whole artistic focus putting together
that studio. It worked for a time, but
ultimately, fiscal responsibilty took
over and we really had to hone it down.
I: You've just resigned as program
coordinator here, is there a new pro
ject you're taking on?

HO: I just started graduate school this
spring. I'm going into a new field —
which isn't really new, but it's new in
terms of my academic training. I'm
doing a special major at San Francisco
State on the anthropology of dance.
I: Do you intend to do field work over

pany of Danish girls because there
wasn't very much happening at that
time on the contemporary dance
scene. I taught at various dance studios
and then I was invited by the Ballet
Academy of Stockholm to come and
teach jazz dance there, so I went for a
year.
I don't know where they are finan
cially now, but Sweden had quite a bit
of money then — they imported a lot
of American dance teachers, and it
really upgraded the contemporary
dance in their country I taught there
for a year, then I finally got sick of
Europe and decided to come back.
I: After visiting Europe and Africa, you
were a soloist with the Rod Rogers
Dance Company in New York; what
style of dance was that?
HO: Rod Rogers is basically a modern
dance company that's been around for
25 years. When I came back to this
country from West Africa, I lived on
the East Coast for about two years and
I danced for Rod for about a year-and
a-half. He was a very important voice
in the dance scene as a black man in
modern dance. Rod is a prime example
of an African-American choreogra
pher that again drew on all his
resources; he had an eclectic repertoire
and he did not feel he had to be put
into any one category.
I: Did you come to Stanford after that
or did you stay in New York?
HO: That's when I started my own
dance studio in Oakland — which is
another life! It's called CitiCentre
Dance Theater. When we started, we

called it Everybody's Creative Arts
Center — and that was indicative of
my philosophy. It was strongly multi
cultural — before multicultural was
even talked about, before diversity was
even discussed — I started this studio
that had not only various forms of
Afrid&n dance but modern, ballet and
jazz — the three main staples here in
America — along with Balinese,
Indonesian, Mexican Folk ...

I wanted people to be able to come
and experience any type of dance that
existed on the planet, that was my
whole artistic focus putting together
that studio. It worked for a time, but
ultimately, fiscal responsibilty took
over and we really had to hone it down.
I: You've just resigned as program
coordinator here, is there a new pro
ject you're taking on?

HO: I just started graduate school this
spring. I'm going into a new field —
which isn't really new, but it's new in
terms of my academic training. I'm
doing a special major at San Francisco
State on the anthropology of dance.
I: Do you intend to do field work over
seas again?
HO: Not at the master's level, but at
the doctorate level I'm sure I will. My

region will definitely be Africa or the
Caribbean. You know, I'm amazed at
how much I could bring to my own
education from my experiences. For
many students the idea of field work is
in the future; but I can go back over
my own field work and use that as
sources for my papers. I've kept'a diary
since I left for Europe in '69, so I have
all of my notes.
You know, I'm really glad I traveled

when I did, because since I returned to
the West Coast I've been doing a lot of
instituion building — starting Citi-
Centre, coming to Stanford and devel
oping the black performing arts on
campus, founding Black Choreogra
phers Moving and having that take
place in two different cities. All that's
taken being rooted, so I'm glad I did
the moving around when I was
younger.
Many people dream
about taking off and
traveling around the
world by themselves.
Halifu Osumare
did it.
Many people fantasize about danc
ing to the music of thunderous
applause on a New York stage.
Halifu Osumare's done it.
Many people want to make a differ
ence, to influence and improve the lives
of others.
Halifu Osumare does it.
A teacher, choreographer and for
mer dancer, Osumare has led an envi
able life.
For the past 10 years, Osumare has
been teaching both jazz dance and
African-Caribbean roots of jazz to
crowded classes of Stanford students.
But her proud, confident manner
speaks of experience that extends far
beyond the walls of Roble Gym.
Osumare's energy and enthusiasm
are apparent even in conversation. Her
dark eyes sparkle knowingly as she
speaks, beckoning you in, inviting
your questions, convincing you that
that all the world's wisdom and
unimaginable adventures are stored
safely behind her dancing eyes.
But even if you were to imagine the
most fascinating and exotic adventures
you could think of, they probably
wouldn't measure up to her real life.
Osumare has traveled solo all over
the globe, immersing herself in other

cultures. She has taught
dance and performed on
stages from Greenwich Vil
lage in New York to Ghana
in West Africa. Along the
way, she has studied with
some of the world's greatest
dance masters and has
gained appreciable knowl
edge, both of herself and the
world.
A San Francisco native,
Osumare returned to the

Bay Area in the late '70s and opened
her own international, ethnically
diverse dance studio in Oakland before
joining the faculty at Stanford in 1981.
Deeply committed to the advance
ment of African-Americans in the arts,
Osumare became the coordinator of
the Committee on Black Performing
Arts at Stanford in 1981 and has since
founded Black Choreographers Mov
ing Toward the 21st Century, a festival
based in both San Francisco and Los
Angeles that highlights the work of
young, talented and frequently over
looked black choreographers across
the country.
Talking with her, it quickly
becomes clear that the dedication and
energy that mark her personality have
shaped the rest of her life as well.
Always a pioneer, Osumare "has not
been afraid of life. I've just met it head
on and gone into it tearless. That's the
only way I know how to do it."

Intermission: I know you taught
dance at the University of Ghana. Is
that where you were first introduced to
traditional forms of African dance?
Halifu Osumare: No. I was introduced
to African dance by seeing the
National Dance Company of Guinea,
one of the first African dance compa
nies to tour America and Europe in the
late '60s. Before that I had studied
what is now called African-derived
dance forms; movement inspired by
the Caribbean Islands. I had studied
the [Katherine] Dunham technique
before going to West Africa, and it was
through this exposure that I really got
a sense of what African dance is about
— its connectedness to life and the
processes of life, the socialization pro-

cess of life.
If you are in a culture where dance
is very much a part of the people's lives
and their identity and their expression,
then each stage of your life is involved
in dance from birth to death. I really
wanted to go and experience that cul
ture, so individually — no fellowship,
no scholarship — I just saved my
money and went to West Africa.
I did affiliate myself with the Uni
versity of Ghana. I enrolled purely as
an auditor in classes there. I wanted to
study traditional Ghanaian dance
forms. They had African studies as a
discipline, and within that the school
of dance, music and drama. So that
you had qualified teachers for the var
ious forms of dance that make up
Ghana — the dances of the different
ethnic groups — the Ashanti, the Ewe.
While 1 was there they became familiar
with me and my dance experience and
they asked me if I would teach while I
was doing my own study.
1 taught what 1 would now call

African-Ameri
can dance; it was
modern dance
training with a
strong jazz em
phasis. And I
would also teach
them black Amer
ican social dance
which is the
closest form we
have here that
retained African
movement styles.
I: Do you see
dance as a form
of self-expres
sion or a form

of cultural expression? What role does
dance play in your life?
HO: I can't separate the two. Self and
culture, it's like one and the same to
me. I think African-Americans are
much more aware of that — that
insepararability of culture and per
sonal identity. And it's because we've
had to be. There's no way you could
not know you're a black person in this
culture; historically, we've had to be
very self conscious of who we were as a
culture and as a race.
I think white people in America
have had the luxury of not thinking of
themselves in a cultural way because the
entire lifestyle reinforces that culture.
You don't have to think about your cul
ture because everything — almost all

the images, the way
the education sys
tem is set up —
everything rein
forces what you first
learned in your
home. You can have
the luxury of think
ing of yourself
totally as a person,
but that doesn't
mean that culture
hasn't been there,

and has not been a part of your cultural
identity. It just means that the aware
ness h*s not been there.
I: What is your relationship with the
black community at Stanford?
HO: I think I've had a very strong rela
tionship with the black community at
Stanford. I've just recently resigned
from my position as program coordi
nator of the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts. My position as part-time
administrator — while I was still
teaching here — put me right at the
center of helping students devise pro
grams for what they wanted to do, in
terms of expressing themselves.
I feel that in my 10 years here as
program coordinator I was able to help
the committee go from a program that
was utilized entirely by black students
on campus to having more of a cam
pus-wide profile.
I: Do you think the relation between
form and function in today's dance in

the United States is different than it is
in tradiitonal African dance?
HO: Well, for African-Americans, I
think that not only have some of the
movement styles have been retained,
but some of what determines dance
aesthetic principles. Those principles
are that you don't just dance for
dance's sake, but you dance to
heighten your own energy and to
heighten the group's energy. You have
a purpose behind dancing. It's a kind
of group consciousness-raising that
dance is used for in Africa, and I think
that purpose still remains in African-
American.
When you look at traditional
African society and you look at the way
dance is used not only for the secular
aspect of life, but also the religious, the
sacred, you see a much more delin
eated aspect of what that form and
function is all about — there are
dances for certain occasions, for cer
tain times of the year. Form and func
tion in that sense is much more defini
tive in traditional dances. When we say
that we have retained some of that here
in America, it is in the broadest sense
of the term, in that we use dance for
consciousness-raising and ultimately
that's what it's used for in Africa as
well.

I: In your own choreography, do you
find that your work tends to revolve
around a theme or is it more dance for
dancing's sake?
HO: Well, being an African-American,
I draw upon all the various approaches
and the aesthetics I've grown up under,
which is not only African but Euro
pean as well. I find that I create dances
from different perspectives; each dance
is a statement unto itself and will have
its own purpose and reason for being.
I tend to go more toward dance in a
functional sense in that I want to say
something when I choreograph.
I: Do you have any role models or any
one whose work you particularly
admire?
HO: Well of course there's Ruth Beck
ford and Nantsizi Cayou and Ed Mock
... But I tell you I never met anyone
who really inspired me; who made me
say, "I want to follow this person. This
is my guru," until I met Katherine
Dunham. I met her for the first time in
1987 when she visited Stanford. And I
thought, "This is a person I can totally
identify with." When I met her, she was
just so much greater than I imagined.
She is the closest living person I know
who is truly self-realized. She has
found a way to integrate mind, body
and spirit in a way I've never encoun

tered in anyone else I've met. She is my
ultimate role model. Not only in the
discipline of dance, but in the disci
pline of life. It's taken all this time to
find her; and it's coming at the tail end
of my performing career. She's my
spirit mother.
1: Where did you receive your dance
training?
HO: Well, I grew up in San Francisco,
and I started dancing in high school. I
was lucky enough to go to a high
school that had a trained modern
dance teacher who talked the adminis
tration into letting her start a dance
program within the [physical educa
tion] program. So I started with her
and she really gave us a sense of the
integrity of dance as an art.
I: Is high school kind of late for a
dancer to start out?
HO: Well, it depends. For classical bal
let, oftentimes they say you should
start as a young child. But many mod
ern dancers start in their adult years —
or late teens — so that's a myth in a
way. Although it does help to start
younger, modern dance — which
often requires more than just skills in
terms of executing steps — takes inter

pretation and a knowledge of yourself.
I think it's important that a dancer
have lived some life.
However, in some cultures you start
dancing on your mother's back. The
mother straps the baby to her back and
participates in dance ceremonies; you
start dancing even before you can even
walk.
So when you start is relative to the
culture. In America, where the arts are
very seperate from the socialization
process of growing up, we consciously
choose to start dance at certain times.
I: Where did you receive the rest of
your dance training?
HO: 1 think I pieced together the rest
of my training as a dancer/teacher.
During college, I went to other studios
at night, as any serious dance student
does. I have a strong Katherine Dun
ham training and I've studied with
many of the masters in the Bay Area.
Another woman who had a particu
larly strong influence on me was Nant
sizi Cayou; she was my mentor at col
lege, and she's still there today.
When I was in Europe I met up
with some of the best American chore
ographers. It's kind of ironic because I
got trained by some of the best New
York choreographers by going to
Europe. Being a black performer I was
seen as a commodity in the European
dance scene. It was the Josephine
Baker syndrome: you know, (mocking
a European accent) "Ah, the black
woman exotica!" So I could pretty
much write my own ticket.
I: And while you were in Europe, you
also taught at the Ballet Academy of
Stockholm?
HO: That's another life! This preceded
Africa. From '69 to '71 I lived in

Europe. The first year I traveled
around just being a hippie — they had
them in those days. Talk about
rebelling against our parents! My gen
eration paved the way for you guys. It
was much more rigid when I was your
age.
There were a lot of people traveling
around Europe and there was a little
circuit everyone was traveling around
on. Anyway, I finally ended up in
Copenhagen for one year — again,
being a pioneer. I met up with another
American and we started a dance com
pany of Danish girls because there
wasn't very much happening at that
time on the contemporary dance
scene. I taught at various dance studios
and then I was invited by the Ballet
