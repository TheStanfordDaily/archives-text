I was wrong.
I didn't expect to be entertained; I
didn't expect to laugh. In short, I just
plain didn't expect to like it. But I was
wrong.
I had heard some less-than-won
derful reviews about the opening night
of Burbank's musical rendition of
"The Princess Bride," but that wasn't
what was holding me back. The main
thing was that I just didn't think it was
possible to make a decent dorm pro
duction out of one of my favorite
movies.
"It's possible, pig. It's possible, you
vomitous mass."
c True love is the most
wonderful thing in the
world ... except for a
good MLT when the
tomatoes are perky and
the mutton is nice and
lean
OK, I guess it was. In fact, it was
great. Sure, there are weak spots in the
show, but not enough to make a real
difference in the overall performance.
"The Princess Bride" is a story of
giants, sword fighting, villainous liars
and, of course, true love. And as we all
know...
"True love is the most wonderful
thing in the world... except for a good
MLT when the tomatoes are perky and
the mutton is nice and lean."
The only real difference between
Burbank's production and the movie is
that Burbank has turned the show into
a musical, or rather, a semi-musical.
There are only four songs and a reprise
in the show. Personally, I preferred the
non-musical version.
Although the songs were good, the
range of musical talent in the cast was
so varied it made it hard to accept the
story in musical form.
The acting, however, was fantastic.
Granted, it wasn't Shakespeare, but
nobody was expecting that. What I
expected was a less-than-mediocre
performance. What I got was an
extremely well-rehearsed show with

actors who had actually developed
their characters.
Count Rugen, played by freshman
Jason Frazzano, was excellent as Prince
Humperdink's pain-loving henchman.
Frazzano turned what could have been
a very nondescript supporting role
into a very definite character; his per
formance is obviously the result of
long, hard work. And it paid off: Fraz
zano's voice, facial expressions and
movements are fitted to the count's
character wonderfully
In addition to Frazzano, the most
memorable performance was that of
freshman Udaya Patnaik. Patnaik, in a
brief but hysterical role as the bishop,
had the audience in stitches. Although
it was a small part, his character was
definitely one of the funniest.
The only real weak spot was Butter
cup's lack of depth. Because her char
acter wasn't developed, it was very dif
ficult to tell where Buttercup ended
and freshman Jena Hickey began ...
you always wondered if the bored look
on her face was Buttercup's or
Hickey's.
On the other side of the coin,
Vizzinni was a little overdone. Vizzinni
is by no means a mild character, so
sophomore Alexa Molnar's extra
hyper portrayal is to be expected —
but it still needs to be toned down a
bit. It just didn't seem natural.
But these few imperfections are just
that — imperfections. You cannot
expect perfection from a dorm pro
duction. And Burbank's "Princess
Bride" is a super show by any amateur
standards.

A kids-eye view
oi an ancient
Greek divorce
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Medea's Children"
can be seen at The Nitery The
ater at 8 p.m. tonight through
Saturday and at 2 p.m. on
Sunday, May 19
Even if you remember "Medea"
from your CIV readings, this is part of
the story you won't recognize.
"Medea's Children," a joint project of
players from the Unga Klara Children's
Center in Stockholm and Swedish

schoolchildren, covers the play from a
different point of view — Medea's chil
dren. After all, they were affected by
the events that transpired between
their parents, weren't they? "Medea's
Children" attempts to capture the pro
found emotional trauma that divorce
causes children to endure.
Little Jason, played by Chris
Cuckow, and Little Medea, played by
Michi Barall, succeed in conveying the
utter emotional disruption inflicted on
their lives through their all-out physi
cal war on themselves and each other.
A steady stream of stuffed animals flies
through the air, aimed at one or the
other of them. Mutual slaps, attempted
hangings and suicides and maximum
effort leaps toward the bed abound
throughout the drama. The audience
quickly discovers why Little Medea has
black-blue-and-red knees.
Cuckow and Barall perform their
roles admirably, and they are sup
ported in their acting by an overall fine
cast. Alys Shanti, who plays Anna, the
au pair who cares for Little lason and
Little Medea, does a fine job as a con
cerned young woman who stands up
for the children, urging their parents
to be honest with them. Though the
telephone is practically an outgrowth
of Shanti's hand, she still conveys a real
concern for the well-being of Little
Jason and Little Medea.
Ashwin Arjun Bulcandani plays a
wonderfully yuppie, macho Jason who
teaches Little Medea that she will not
be able to become a professional soccer
player because she is a girl. He initiates
Little Medea into the ways of our
misogynist world through both word
and deed.
And Alicia Miller, who plays
Medea, and Kimberly Hoskins, who
plays Glauce, capture their roles well
through dance. Miller spins around in
circles as the distraught sorceress
unable to bear her husband's adultery,

Little Jason and Little
Medea succeed in con
veying the utter emo
tional disruption
inflicted on their lives
through their all-out
physical war on them
selves and each other.
while Hoskins, who never says a word,
dances lustfully and delicately in order
to seduce lason.
"Medea's Children" does well in
conveying the children's side of the
divorce story. And the slides of various
photographs, drawings and paintings
shown immediately before and during
the performance effectively grab the
attention of the audience and support
the performances of the endlessly
moving actors with still, visual images.

Director presents
'Macbeth' with
modern themes
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Macbeth" is being
performed in the Little Theater
in Memorial Auditorium
tonight through Saturday at 8
p.m., with a Saturday matinee
at 2 p.m. Student tickets are
$5.
From the moment one enters the
Little Theater to see the Drama
Department's production of "Mac
beth," it's obvious that watching the

play is going to be an unsettling expe
rience.
The set, designed by John Wilson,
creates an ugly wasteland of stray
garbage cans, corroding tires and gray
asphalt. The gloomy atmosphere is
mirrored in the play's programs, which
are done in tabloid form. The mini
newspapers contain clippings of vari
ous American travesties including
headlines reading "The Forgotten
Homeless" and "CIA Terrorist Train
ing Manual Uncovered."
When the play itself begins, the des
perate, horrific feelings depicted in the
set and the program are duplicated on
stage. The connection is difficult to
miss — that Shakespeare's story carries
themes still very relevant to our lives
today. "Macbeth" is more than the tale
of a man who turns to evil. It also
forces us to think about the brutal
times in which we live and the danger
ous potential for wrongdoing within
each of us.
"I'm not interested in museum
pieces," comments director Rush
Rehm, "I wanted to do 'Macbeth'
because it has some very negative but
very true things to say about our soci
ety. It can be violent and angry, but it
also has moments of great beauty and
insight. I also did it because I knew I
could cast it."
And cast it he did. Due to an excep
tional number of talented women who
auditioned, Rehm decided to expand
the number of female roles in the play.
He increased the number of witches
from three to six and even cast a
woman as Macduff's son. In addition,
Rehm chose a professional actor, Bruce
Evers, to play Macbeth.
"I wouldn't have done "Macbeth" if
I didn't have someone who could play
the lead," says Rehm. "Bruce's presence
is a great opportunity for students to
learn that an acting career is a lot of
hard work ... Bruce definitely sees
himself as a working man."
For Evers, performing with Stan
ford students proves to be a rewarding
experience as well.
"They like to have a good time,"
Evers says of his fellow cast members,
"I don't see myself as any different
from them ... only a little more expe
rienced. They're really a bunch of hard
workers."
The play itself is not a new experi
ence for Evers, as this production
marks his third portrayal of Macbeth,
the first being while he was still in high
school. This doesn't make the role any
easier though, as Evers admits that
Macbeth's complexity and various crit
ical interpretations are very intimidat
ing. "All scholarliness aside," he
explains, "you just have to get out
there and play the stuff... you have to
act it."
Powerful acting combined with
Shakespeare's rich language leave
"Macbeth's" audiences ample oppor
tunity to discover it%> meaning for
themselves. Rehm notes that the play's
quick pace (it's done without an inter
mission) and high impact produce an
almost overwhelming effect.
"When I asked several people after
the performances what their opinions
were, they told me they didn't want to
talk about it right away... that kind of
reaction is in the nature of the play."

Director presents
'Macbeth' with
modern themes
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Macbeth" is being
performed in the Little Theater
in Memorial Auditorium
tonight through Saturday at 8
p.m., with a Saturday matinee
at 2 p.m. Student tickets are
$5.
From the moment one enters the
Little Theater to see the Drama
Department's production of "Mac
beth," it's obvious that watching the

play is going to be an unsettling expe
rience.
The set, designed by John Wilson,
creates an ugly wasteland of stray
garbage cans, corroding tires and gray
asphalt. The gloomy atmosphere is
mirrored in the play's programs, which
are done in tabloid form. The mini
newspapers contain clippings of vari
ous American travesties including
headlines reading "The Forgotten
Homeless" and "CIA Terrorist Train
ing Manual Uncovered."
When the play itself begins, the des
perate, horrific feelings depicted in the
set and the program are duplicated on
stage. The connection is difficult to
miss — that Shakespeare's story carries
themes still very relevant to our lives
today. "Macbeth" is more than the tale
of a man who turns to evil. It also
forces us to think about the brutal
times in which we live and the danger
ous potential for wrongdoing within
each of us.
"I'm not interested in museum
pieces," comments director Rush
Rehm, "I wanted to do 'Macbeth'
because it has some very negative but
very true things to say about our soci
ety. It can be violent and angry, but it
also has moments of great beauty and
insight. I also did it because I knew I
could cast it."
And cast it he did. Due to an excep
tional number of talented women who
auditioned, Rehm decided to expand
the number of female roles in the play.
He increased the number of witches
from three to six and even cast a
woman as Macduff's son. In addition,
Rehm chose a professional actor, Bruce
Evers, to play Macbeth.
"I wouldn't have done "Macbeth" if
I didn't have someone who could play
the lead," says Rehm. "Bruce's presence
is a great opportunity for students to
learn that an acting career is a lot of
hard work ... Bruce definitely sees
himself as a working man."
For Evers, performing with Stan
ford students proves to be a rewarding
experience as well.
"They like to have a good time,"
Evers says of his fellow cast members,
"I don't see myself as any different
from them ... only a little more expe
rienced. They're really a bunch of hard
workers."
The play itself is not a new experi
ence for Evers, as this production
marks his third portrayal of Macbeth,
the first being while he was still in high
school. This doesn't make the role any
easier though, as Evers admits that
Macbeth's complexity and various crit
ical interpretations are very intimidat
ing. "All scholarliness aside," he
explains, "you just have to get out
there and play the stuff... you have to
act it."
Powerful acting combined with
Shakespeare's rich language leave
"Macbeth's" audiences ample oppor
tunity to discover it%> meaning for
themselves. Rehm notes that the play's
quick pace (it's done without an inter
mission) and high impact produce an
almost overwhelming effect.
"When I asked several people after
the performances what their opinions
were, they told me they didn't want to
talk about it right away... that kind of
reaction is in the nature of the play."

I was wrong.
I didn't expect to be entertained; I
didn't expect to laugh. In short, I just
plain didn't expect to like it. But I was
wrong.
I had heard some less-than-won
derful reviews about the opening night
of Burbank's musical rendition of
"The Princess Bride," but that wasn't
what was holding me back. The main
thing was that I just didn't think it was
possible to make a decent dorm pro
duction out of one of my favorite
movies.
"It's possible, pig. It's possible, you
vomitous mass."
c True love is the most
wonderful thing in the
world ... except for a
good MLT when the
tomatoes are perky and
the mutton is nice and
lean
OK, I guess it was. In fact, it was
great. Sure, there are weak spots in the
show, but not enough to make a real
difference in the overall performance.
"The Princess Bride" is a story of
giants, sword fighting, villainous liars
and, of course, true love. And as we all
know...
"True love is the most wonderful
thing in the world... except for a good
MLT when the tomatoes are perky and
the mutton is nice and lean."
The only real difference between
Burbank's production and the movie is
that Burbank has turned the show into
a musical, or rather, a semi-musical.
There are only four songs and a reprise
in the show. Personally, I preferred the
non-musical version.
Although the songs were good, the
range of musical talent in the cast was
so varied it made it hard to accept the
story in musical form.
The acting, however, was fantastic.
Granted, it wasn't Shakespeare, but
nobody was expecting that. What I
expected was a less-than-mediocre
performance. What I got was an
extremely well-rehearsed show with

actors who had actually developed
their characters.
Count Rugen, played by freshman
Jason Frazzano, was excellent as Prince
Humperdink's pain-loving henchman.
Frazzano turned what could have been
a very nondescript supporting role
into a very definite character; his per
formance is obviously the result of
long, hard work. And it paid off: Fraz
zano's voice, facial expressions and
movements are fitted to the count's
character wonderfully
In addition to Frazzano, the most
memorable performance was that of
freshman Udaya Patnaik. Patnaik, in a
brief but hysterical role as the bishop,
had the audience in stitches. Although
it was a small part, his character was
definitely one of the funniest.
The only real weak spot was Butter
cup's lack of depth. Because her char
acter wasn't developed, it was very dif
ficult to tell where Buttercup ended
and freshman Jena Hickey began ...
you always wondered if the bored look
on her face was Buttercup's or
Hickey's.
On the other side of the coin,
Vizzinni was a little overdone. Vizzinni
is by no means a mild character, so
sophomore Alexa Molnar's extra
hyper portrayal is to be expected —
but it still needs to be toned down a
bit. It just didn't seem natural.
But these few imperfections are just
that — imperfections. You cannot
expect perfection from a dorm pro
duction. And Burbank's "Princess
Bride" is a super show by any amateur
standards.
"I'll use small words so you'll be sure
to understand, you warthog-faced baf

Auditorium on Friday, May 17,
at 8:00 p.m.
This year, Stanford Symphony
Orchestra's Spring Concert goes snap,
mambo and pop.
The orchestra is altering its usual
repertoire of classical European pieces
to celebrate Stanford's centennial in
American pops style. Instead of
Mozart, they will be featuring a lot of
popular tunes, including music by
Rodgers and Hammerstein and
Leonard Bernstein.
The program will also include a

"tribute to jazz." As part of this tribute,
the orchestra will play Gershwin's
"Rhapsody in Blue" with student
piano soloist Matt Springer.
Chairperson Alice Lee says that the
goal of this show is "to draw people
who are not into serious classical
[music] to see the orchestra." And the
greatest attraction may just be the spe
cial guest appearance by University
President Donald Kennedy. No, our
beloved leader will not be singing, but
will narrate a piece called "Lincoln
Portrait." The orchestra will accom
pany Kennedy in this "tone poem"
about Lincoln by supplementing his
words with musical descriptions and
impressions.
Aside from being an entertaining
way to spend an evening, this special
pops performance is a fund-raiser for
the orchestra's tour of Eastern Europe,
planned for late June. Inspired by the
new political stability and open com
munication, this trip is viewed by
members of the orchestra as an oppor

A kids-eye view
oi an ancient
Greek divorce
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Medea's Children"
can be seen at The Nitery The
ater at 8 p.m. tonight through
Saturday and at 2 p.m. on
Sunday, May 19
Even if you remember "Medea"
from your CIV readings, this is part of
the story you won't recognize.
"Medea's Children," a joint project of
players from the Unga Klara Children's
Center in Stockholm and Swedish

schoolchildren, covers the play from a
different point of view — Medea's chil
dren. After all, they were affected by
the events that transpired between
their parents, weren't they? "Medea's
Children" attempts to capture the pro
found emotional trauma that divorce
causes children to endure.
Little Jason, played by Chris
Cuckow, and Little Medea, played by
Michi Barall, succeed in conveying the
utter emotional disruption inflicted on
their lives through their all-out physi
cal war on themselves and each other.
A steady stream of stuffed animals flies
through the air, aimed at one or the
other of them. Mutual slaps, attempted
hangings and suicides and maximum
effort leaps toward the bed abound
throughout the drama. The audience
quickly discovers why Little Medea has
black-blue-and-red knees.
Cuckow and Barall perform their
roles admirably, and they are sup
ported in their acting by an overall fine
cast. Alys Shanti, who plays Anna, the
au pair who cares for Little lason and
Little Medea, does a fine job as a con
cerned young woman who stands up
for the children, urging their parents
to be honest with them. Though the
telephone is practically an outgrowth
of Shanti's hand, she still conveys a real
concern for the well-being of Little
Jason and Little Medea.
Ashwin Arjun Bulcandani plays a
wonderfully yuppie, macho Jason who
teaches Little Medea that she will not
be able to become a professional soccer
player because she is a girl. He initiates
Little Medea into the ways of our
misogynist world through both word

their characters.
Count Rugen, played by freshman
Jason Frazzano, was excellent as Prince
Humperdink's pain-loving henchman.
Frazzano turned what could have been
a very nondescript supporting role
into a very definite character; his per
formance is obviously the result of
long, hard work. And it paid off: Fraz
zano's voice, facial expressions and
movements are fitted to the count's
character wonderfully
In addition to Frazzano, the most
memorable performance was that of
freshman Udaya Patnaik. Patnaik, in a
brief but hysterical role as the bishop,
had the audience in stitches. Although
it was a small part, his character was
definitely one of the funniest.
The only real weak spot was Butter
cup's lack of depth. Because her char
acter wasn't developed, it was very dif
ficult to tell where Buttercup ended
and freshman Jena Hickey began ...
you always wondered if the bored look
on her face was Buttercup's or
Hickey's.
On the other side of the coin,
Vizzinni was a little overdone. Vizzinni
is by no means a mild character, so
sophomore Alexa Molnar's extra
hyper portrayal is to be expected —
but it still needs to be toned down a
bit. It just didn't seem natural.
But these few imperfections are just
that — imperfections. You cannot
expect perfection from a dorm pro
duction. And Burbank's "Princess
Bride" is a super show by any amateur
standards.

This year, Stanford Symphony
Orchestra's Spring Concert goes snap,

The orchestra is altering its usual

The program will also include a

Chairperson Alice Lee says that the
goal of this show is "to draw people

A kids-eye view
oi an ancient
Greek divorce
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Medea's Children"
can be seen at The Nitery The
ater at 8 p.m. tonight through
Saturday and at 2 p.m. on
Sunday, May 19
Even if you remember "Medea"
from your CIV readings, this is part of
the story you won't recognize.
"Medea's Children," a joint project of
players from the Unga Klara Children's
Center in Stockholm and Swedish

schoolchildren, covers the play from a
different point of view — Medea's chil
dren. After all, they were affected by
the events that transpired between
their parents, weren't they? "Medea's
Children" attempts to capture the pro
found emotional trauma that divorce
causes children to endure.
Little Jason, played by Chris
Cuckow, and Little Medea, played by
Michi Barall, succeed in conveying the
utter emotional disruption inflicted on
their lives through their all-out physi
cal war on themselves and each other.
A steady stream of stuffed animals flies
through the air, aimed at one or the
other of them. Mutual slaps, attempted
hangings and suicides and maximum
effort leaps toward the bed abound
throughout the drama. The audience
quickly discovers why Little Medea has
black-blue-and-red knees.
Cuckow and Barall perform their
roles admirably, and they are sup
ported in their acting by an overall fine
cast. Alys Shanti, who plays Anna, the
au pair who cares for Little lason and
Little Medea, does a fine job as a con
cerned young woman who stands up
for the children, urging their parents
to be honest with them. Though the
telephone is practically an outgrowth
of Shanti's hand, she still conveys a real
concern for the well-being of Little
Jason and Little Medea.
Ashwin Arjun Bulcandani plays a
wonderfully yuppie, macho Jason who
teaches Little Medea that she will not
be able to become a professional soccer
player because she is a girl. He initiates
Little Medea into the ways of our
misogynist world through both word
and deed.
And Alicia Miller, who plays
Medea, and Kimberly Hoskins, who
plays Glauce, capture their roles well
through dance. Miller spins around in
circles as the distraught sorceress
unable to bear her husband's adultery,

Little Jason and Little
Medea succeed in con
veying the utter emo
tional disruption
inflicted on their lives
through their all-out
physical war on them
selves and each other.
while Hoskins, who never says a word,
dances lustfully and delicately in order
to seduce lason.
"Medea's Children" does well in
conveying the children's side of the
divorce story. And the slides of various
photographs, drawings and paintings
shown immediately before and during
the performance effectively grab the
attention of the audience and support
the performances of the endlessly
moving actors with still, visual images.

Director presents
'Macbeth' with
modern themes
The Drama Department's pro
duction of "Macbeth" is being
performed in the Little Theater
in Memorial Auditorium
tonight through Saturday at 8
p.m., with a Saturday matinee
at 2 p.m. Student tickets are
$5.
From the moment one enters the
Little Theater to see the Drama
Department's production of "Mac
beth," it's obvious that watching the

play is going to be an unsettling expe
rience.
The set, designed by John Wilson,
creates an ugly wasteland of stray
garbage cans, corroding tires and gray
asphalt. The gloomy atmosphere is
mirrored in the play's programs, which
are done in tabloid form. The mini
newspapers contain clippings of vari
ous American travesties including
headlines reading "The Forgotten
Homeless" and "CIA Terrorist Train
ing Manual Uncovered."
When the play itself begins, the des
perate, horrific feelings depicted in the
set and the program are duplicated on
stage. The connection is difficult to
miss — that Shakespeare's story carries
themes still very relevant to our lives
today. "Macbeth" is more than the tale
of a man who turns to evil. It also
forces us to think about the brutal
times in which we live and the danger
ous potential for wrongdoing within
each of us.
"I'm not interested in museum
pieces," comments director Rush
Rehm, "I wanted to do 'Macbeth'
because it has some very negative but
very true things to say about our soci
ety. It can be violent and angry, but it
also has moments of great beauty and
insight. I also did it because I knew I
could cast it."
And cast it he did. Due to an excep
tional number of talented women who
auditioned, Rehm decided to expand
the number of female roles in the play.
He increased the number of witches
from three to six and even cast a
woman as Macduff's son. In addition,
Rehm chose a professional actor, Bruce
Evers, to play Macbeth.
"I wouldn't have done "Macbeth" if
I didn't have someone who could play
the lead," says Rehm. "Bruce's presence
is a great opportunity for students to
learn that an acting career is a lot of
hard work ... Bruce definitely sees
himself as a working man."
For Evers, performing with Stan
ford students proves to be a rewarding
experience as well.
"They like to have a good time,"
Evers says of his fellow cast members,
"I don't see myself as any different
from them ... only a little more expe
rienced. They're really a bunch of hard
workers."
The play itself is not a new experi
ence for Evers, as this production
marks his third portrayal of Macbeth,
the first being while he was still in high
school. This doesn't make the role any
easier though, as Evers admits that
Macbeth's complexity and various crit
ical interpretations are very intimidat
ing. "All scholarliness aside," he
explains, "you just have to get out
there and play the stuff... you have to
act it."
Powerful acting combined with
Shakespeare's rich language leave
"Macbeth's" audiences ample oppor
tunity to discover it%> meaning for
themselves. Rehm notes that the play's
quick pace (it's done without an inter
mission) and high impact produce an
almost overwhelming effect.
"When I asked several people after
the performances what their opinions
were, they told me they didn't want to
talk about it right away... that kind of
reaction is in the nature of the play."

I was wrong.
I didn't expect to be entertained; I
didn't expect to laugh. In short, I just
plain didn't expect to like it. But I was
wrong.
I had heard some less-than-won
derful reviews about the opening night
of Burbank's musical rendition of
"The Princess Bride," but that wasn't
what was holding me back. The main
thing was that I just didn't think it was
possible to make a decent dorm pro
duction out of one of my favorite
movies.
"It's possible, pig. It's possible, you
vomitous mass."
c True love is the most
wonderful thing in the
world ... except for a
good MLT when the
tomatoes are perky and
the mutton is nice and
lean
OK, I guess it was. In fact, it was
great. Sure, there are weak spots in the
show, but not enough to make a real
difference in the overall performance.
"The Princess Bride" is a story of
giants, sword fighting, villainous liars
and, of course, true love. And as we all
know...
"True love is the most wonderful
thing in the world... except for a good
MLT when the tomatoes are perky and
the mutton is nice and lean."
The only real difference between
Burbank's production and the movie is
that Burbank has turned the show into
a musical, or rather, a semi-musical.
There are only four songs and a reprise
in the show. Personally, I preferred the
non-musical version.
Although the songs were good, the
range of musical talent in the cast was
so varied it made it hard to accept the
story in musical form.
The acting, however, was fantastic.
Granted, it wasn't Shakespeare, but
nobody was expecting that. What I
expected was a less-than-mediocre
performance. What I got was an
extremely well-rehearsed show with

actors who had actually developed
their characters.
Count Rugen, played by freshman
Jason Frazzano, was excellent as Prince
Humperdink's pain-loving henchman.
Frazzano turned what could have been
a very nondescript supporting role
into a very definite character; his per
formance is obviously the result of
long, hard work. And it paid off: Fraz
zano's voice, facial expressions and
movements are fitted to the count's
character wonderfully
In addition to Frazzano, the most
memorable performance was that of
freshman Udaya Patnaik. Patnaik, in a
brief but hysterical role as the bishop,
had the audience in stitches. Although
it was a small part, his character was
definitely one of the funniest.
The only real weak spot was Butter
cup's lack of depth. Because her char
acter wasn't developed, it was very dif
ficult to tell where Buttercup ended
and freshman Jena Hickey began ...
you always wondered if the bored look
on her face was Buttercup's or
Hickey's.
On the other side of the coin,
Vizzinni was a little overdone. Vizzinni
is by no means a mild character, so
sophomore Alexa Molnar's extra
hyper portrayal is to be expected —
but it still needs to be toned down a
bit. It just didn't seem natural.
But these few imperfections are just
that — imperfections. You cannot
expect perfection from a dorm pro

Bride" is a super show by any amateur
standards.
