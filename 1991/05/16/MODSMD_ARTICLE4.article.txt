# Jackson chosen to be new dean
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson has
been selected to fill the new
dean of students position.
Jackson's selection was offi
cially announced yesterday
afternoon by acting Vice Presi
dent for Student Resources
Sally Mahoney.
Jackson said he has
accepted the position.
"I'm very honored, excited
and humbled for the opportu
nity to serve in such an impor

tant position," Jackson said. "I
won't let folks down."
The new post, which reports
to Mahoney, was created as
part of the University's
restructuring effort and
replaces the dean of student
affairs position, currently occu
pied by Norm Robinson. Robin
son has been the acting dean
since James Lyons retired last
year.
Jackson will take over at the
beginning of summer quarter,
Robinson said.
Robinson said he is pleased by
Jackson's selection. "I think it's
wonderful for the University and
it's wonderful for Michael," he
said.
He added that he is unsure
whether he will stay at Stanford
in a new position or go elsewhere.
Mahoney made the final deci
sion to select Jackson. Her choice
among four candidates — all from
Stanford — was based on the rec
ommendation of a search commit
tee of five students, five faculty
and two staff members.
Jackson has been associate
dean of student affairs since
1987. As head of Campus Affairs,
he supervised all the ethnic com
munity centers, among other
duties.
As dean of students, Jackson's
responsibilities will be similar to
those of the former dean of stu
dent affairs, but will also include
supervising Beehtel International

Center and playing an increased
support role for graduate stu
dents.
Jackson will also oversee per
sonal and group crisis support,
judicial affairs, fraternal affairs,
Tresidder Union, the ASSU, the
Disability Resource Center and
the Office of Student Activities.

He said he will emphasize
"making the dean's office respon
sive to student needs and con
cerns" and making "all groups in
the University feel included in the
decision-making process."
Jackson said he is also inter
ested in hearing ideas from fac
ulty and students."
Part of the restructuring that
created the position means that
Jackson will report to Mahoney
rather than directly to University
President Donald Kennedy, as the
dean of student affairs did.
But Jackson dismissed con
cerns that his attempts at student
advocacy will be filtered before
reaching the president.
"The dean of students will still
have direct access to the presi
dent," Jackson said. "I will have
close interaction with the presi
dent and his staff."
Jackson beat three other Stan
ford candidates for the position.
They were Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Jean Kim, Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs James Larimore
and Lecturer and post-doctoral
fellow Faye McNair-Knox.
