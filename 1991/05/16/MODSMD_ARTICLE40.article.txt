# Giving underprivileged children their indepenDANCE
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
One day after a hard dance workout, Ehud Krauss took
a group of 14 East Palo Alto kids to Jack-in-the-Box, where
he says they "ordered exactly what they wanted, sat very
quietly and behaved wonderfully."
The owner of the restaurant came over and, seeing
Krauss' Star of David, asked, "What's a Jewish person like
you doing with all of these kids?"
"I'm just teaching them dance," Krauss replied.

"Where are they from? East Palo
Alto? Kids from East Palo Alto know
how to behave like this?" the owner
asked, somewhat incredulously.
"Why not?" was Krauss' reply.
That's exactly how Krauss feels.
Since 1986, Krauss has made daily
trips to East Palo Alto schools to
teach not only dance, but also self
esteem, patience, clarity and focus.
His dance training and performance
program for elementary through
high school students is called Inde
penDANCE, and 14 advanced stu
dents from this group form the Step-
Up! ensemble.
Krauss believes these youngsters
need someone to "dream with them
and show them that they can do it."
Many of his talented young perform
ers already have the moves they
learned from break dancing and rap

music, which he describes as "talking about their frustra
tions and spilling their guts." But these unbridled spirits
require technique and discipline as an alternative to the lure
of selling drugs.
Krauss tries to give them this discipline through dance
and self-awareness. In one exercise, he gives his students
dance magazines to analyze, asks them to choose 10 pic
tures, then has them explain to the class why they chose
those pictures. The youngsters look at the men and women
in tights and leotards, and some of the very embarrassed
ones say, "I chose this picture because 1 see this on him," or
"I see that on her." But in learning to express what they feel,
they're also learning how wonderful their bodies are, and
Krauss says that's "like taking a stone and making it into a
diamond."
Reflecting on the crisis in education, Krauss says he

doesn't believe in "fixing" kids: the teacher on one side of
the desk and the students, who open books and study for
rote, on the other. He thinks it's interaction and, to a certain
extent, involvement with young students that helps them
learn about themselves, "how much strife they can take,
how great is their capacity to listen and grow as a person."
Krauss often observes his students in their academic
classes to see how the responsibility of performing and the
development of memory through dance carry over into
other areas of their lives.
"I don't think you can be gifted all around," he says, "but

if you're gifted in one thing, that can
be the core for life "
This year, Krauss and Daynee Lai,
his wife and co-director of the Zohar
School of Dance, have reached only
three of the eight schools in East Palo
Alto because of the expense and diffi
culty of transportation. Their pro
gram also extends to schools in east
ern Menlo Park, Redwood City and
San Jose.
But Krauss feels that even when
money isn't pouring in, "nothing
seems to be better." The schools need
crazy people like him. "I'm addicted
to it,"he says passionately of his voca
tion to get kids to see how much
potential they have.
This weekend, everyone will be
able to see this potential, as 150 of
Krauss' students dance to Duke
Ellington, Scott Joplin and the works

of other jazz musicians that they themselves have selected
and helped choreograph routines for.
More boys are participating this year; with the help of
MC Hammer, they've begun to see that dancing is cool.
Guest speaker Dr. Shirley Knight, superintendent of the
East Palo Alto School District, will be at the benefit perfor
mance, and there will be live singing at all three shows. A
key to the success of this year's program has been the
involvement of parents.
Johanna and Jazylet Rivera, two talented sisters who will
perform both solos and a duet, are Step-Up! dancers who
say that dancing "has made them closer and keeps them
together." They're also honor students who are very
involved with the student body, and while they have other
career aspirations, "dance will always be a part of their
lives."
