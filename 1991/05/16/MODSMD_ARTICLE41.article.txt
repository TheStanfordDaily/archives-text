# Stern Hall's Green Line is one giant leap for food service
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
"Awesome!"
"Delicious. Can I have more?"
"Yum!"
There's nothing unusual about these comments, right?
You hear them all the time at restaurants, at parties and at
dinner at your relatives, right? Well, what about at Stern
Hall?
Yes, Stern Hall.
The above are all direct quotes of students who have
recendy eaten Stern Food Service. No, the cooks haven't
added hallucinogens to the food. What they have added is
the Green Line — a lunchtime offering of appetizing and
innovative vegetarian entrees.
On the Green Line, baskets overflow with muffins,
bagels, croissants and an assortment of other breads. Fresh
melons, pineapples and strawberries are gracefully arranged
on a silver tray next to a variety of cheeses such as gouda,
white cheddar, feta, fontina and more. And these m just
the "usual" components of the Green Line; in addition,
there's always a choice of three or four vegetarian entrees,
fresh vegetables and vegetarian soups.
Hessin Camille Ghazal, assistant manager at Stern Food
Service, is the brawn and the brains behind the Green Line.
After immigrating to the United States in 1979, she earned
a master's in both French and home economics and a doc
torate in education. Ghazal has been working for University
Food Service — primarily on the Row — since 1983, but
this is her first year at Stern.
"My main concern when I first came here was the quality
of the food. I went over last year's evaluations and found
that certain things would be easy to improve," she says.
"Other things — like the vegetarian items — really needed
a person dedicated to improving them."
After talking with many students and receiving very pos
itive responses, Ghazal began thinking about creating a full
service vegetarian line. After months of planning and train
ing, the Green Line opened in the beginning of spring quar
ter.
The Green Line operates on a cyclical five-week menu
system. In addition to the "regular days," each week there is
one "theme lunch" with a menu featuring foods from a spe
cific country.
Two weeks ago a Greek lunch was served. The menu
included such dishes as eggplant moussaka, tyropita (trian
gles of filo dough filled with cheese), spanakopita (filo lay

ered with spinach), lentil soup, fresh green beans & la Greek,
tzatziki, pasta with lemon and cream, an olive tray and
baklava.
The feedback was encouraging. Mina Satoyoshi, a fresh
man living in Twain says she ''was impressed with the selec
tion of olives. They had more kinds than you can usually
find in the supermarket."
To set the mood, Greek music was played, posters of
Greece were hung and the staff dressed in blue and white —
the traditional colors of Greece.
"I like to create an ethnic atmosphere to complement the
food," says Ghazal. "It's fun to hang flags and posters and to

have flowers and music."
In planning the Green Line menus, Ghazal takes many
factors into consideration. She says she concerns herself
with "nutrition, taste, quality, variety, texture and the colors
of the food. I want to provide the students with a healthy
and appealing meal." In addition, says Ghazal, "Fresh veg
etables and breads are very important to me, as are cheeses
and desserts, which I like very much."
Though the finances of the new line have not yet been
completely analyzed, as of now it appears that the Green
Line is not any more expensive to operate in terms of food
cost than is the standard line.

"For what the students pay, I feel they deserve extra
effort and good quality food. The most expensive item on
the Green Line is the cheese. Otherwise, I know that meats
are more expensive than vegetables, so in the end it all
works out," explains Ghazal.
Keith Guy, the director of Housing and Food Services,
seems to agree. According to him, there has been some dis
cussion of centralizing the production of food service vege
tarian entrees next year. That would probably "increase the
consistency and the quality of the vegetarian offerings," he
says. "We intend to offer a strong vegetarian option again
next year, perhaps in two locations."
"The reactions have been very, very positive," he says,
"I've had several lunches there and enjoyed them very
much."
The addition of the Green Line has meant extra work for
everyone at Stern, not just Ghazal. The staff has had to learn
how to prepare many new dishes, and it takes a lot of time
to make all the Green Line entrees in addition to the stan
dard line offerings. The Green Line also requires additional
hashers.
"It's been extra work, but we've had fun with it. It's been
a learning experience," says Virginia Varkony, manager of
Stern Food Service.
Students have been able to help out with the workload.
One evening, 10 students helped Ghazal prepare nearly 200
vegetable and tofu brochettes for the next day's lunch.
Students also helped to pick fresh green beans. There may
be more of such opportunities to pitch in and help in the
future.
In addition to creating the Green Line, Ghazal has
worked to present some educational programs related to
nutrition and vegetarian cooking. In April, she invited chefs
from Green's Restaurant to Stern to present a vegetarian
cooking demonstration for students and the kitchen staff.
Some of the dishes, such as the vegetable and tofu bro
chettes, have been incorporated into the Green Line.
"I've been very happy with the success of the Green
Line," beams Ghazal. "The first day we had 65 students, the
next day 98, then 141 and now it's up to nearly 200 students
every day. They come from everywhere — Lagunita, Roble,
Wilbur. I feel bad when they have to wait in long lines but I
try to talk to them and encourage them to wait by telling
them about the day's entrees."
The Green Line is served Monday through Friday from
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the Larkin side of Stern. It's often
crowded around noon, so come early to avoid the lines.
However, in the words of one student, "It's worth the wait!"

the Green Line — a lunchtime offering of appetizing and
innovative vegetarian entrees.
On the Green Line, baskets overflow with muffins,
bagels, croissants and an assortment of other breads. Fresh
melons, pineapples and strawberries are gracefully arranged
on a silver tray next to a variety of cheeses such as gouda,
white cheddar, feta, fontina and more. And these m just
the "usual" components of the Green Line; in addition,
there's always a choice of three or four vegetarian entrees,
fresh vegetables and vegetarian soups.
Hessin Camille Ghazal, assistant manager at Stern Food
Service, is the brawn and the brains behind the Green Line.
After immigrating to the United States in 1979, she earned
a master's in both French and home economics and a doc
torate in education. Ghazal has been working for University
Food Service — primarily on the Row — since 1983, but
this is her first year at Stern.
"My main concern when I first came here was the quality
of the food. I went over last year's evaluations and found
that certain things would be easy to improve," she says.
"Other things — like the vegetarian items — really needed
a person dedicated to improving them."
After talking with many students and receiving very pos
itive responses, Ghazal began thinking about creating a full
service vegetarian line. After months of planning and train
ing, the Green Line opened in the beginning of spring quar
ter.
The Green Line operates on a cyclical five-week menu
system. In addition to the "regular days," each week there is
one "theme lunch" with a menu featuring foods from a spe
cific country.
Two weeks ago a Greek lunch was served. The menu
included such dishes as eggplant moussaka, tyropita (trian
gles of filo dough filled with cheese), spanakopita (filo lay

ered with spinach), lentil soup, fresh green beans & la Greek,
tzatziki, pasta with lemon and cream, an olive tray and
baklava.
The feedback was encouraging. Mina Satoyoshi, a fresh
man living in Twain says she ''was impressed with the selec
tion of olives. They had more kinds than you can usually
find in the supermarket."
To set the mood, Greek music was played, posters of
Greece were hung and the staff dressed in blue and white —
the traditional colors of Greece.
"I like to create an ethnic atmosphere to complement the
food," says Ghazal. "It's fun to hang flags and posters and to

have flowers and music."
In planning the Green Line menus, Ghazal takes many
factors into consideration. She says she concerns herself
with "nutrition, taste, quality, variety, texture and the colors
of the food. I want to provide the students with a healthy
and appealing meal." In addition, says Ghazal, "Fresh veg
etables and breads are very important to me, as are cheeses
and desserts, which I like very much."
Though the finances of the new line have not yet been
completely analyzed, as of now it appears that the Green
Line is not any more expensive to operate in terms of food
cost than is the standard line.

"For what the students pay, I feel they deserve extra
effort and good quality food. The most expensive item on
the Green Line is the cheese. Otherwise, I know that meats
are more expensive than vegetables, so in the end it all
works out," explains Ghazal.
Keith Guy, the director of Housing and Food Services,
seems to agree. According to him, there has been some dis
cussion of centralizing the production of food service vege
tarian entrees next year. That would probably "increase the
consistency and the quality of the vegetarian offerings," he
says. "We intend to offer a strong vegetarian option again
next year, perhaps in two locations."
"The reactions have been very, very positive," he says,
"I've had several lunches there and enjoyed them very
much."
The addition of the Green Line has meant extra work for
everyone at Stern, not just Ghazal. The staff has had to learn
how to prepare many new dishes, and it takes a lot of time
to make all the Green Line entrees in addition to the stan
dard line offerings. The Green Line also requires additional
hashers.
"It's been extra work, but we've had fun with it. It's been
a learning experience," says Virginia Varkony, manager of
Stern Food Service.
Students have been able to help out with the workload.
One evening, 10 students helped Ghazal prepare nearly 200
vegetable and tofu brochettes for the next day's lunch.
Students also helped to pick fresh green beans. There may
be more of such opportunities to pitch in and help in the
future.
In addition to creating the Green Line, Ghazal has
worked to present some educational programs related to
nutrition and vegetarian cooking. In April, she invited chefs
from Green's Restaurant to Stern to present a vegetarian
cooking demonstration for students and the kitchen staff.
Some of the dishes, such as the vegetable and tofu bro
chettes, have been incorporated into the Green Line.
"I've been very happy with the success of the Green
Line," beams Ghazal. "The first day we had 65 students, the
next day 98, then 141 and now it's up to nearly 200 students
every day. They come from everywhere — Lagunita, Roble,
Wilbur. I feel bad when they have to wait in long lines but I
try to talk to them and encourage them to wait by telling
them about the day's entrees."
The Green Line is served Monday through Friday from
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the Larkin side of Stern. It's often
crowded around noon, so come early to avoid the lines.
However, in the words of one student, "It's worth the wait!"

"Awesome!"
"Delicious. Can I have more?"
"Yum!"
There's nothing unusual about these comments, right?
You hear them all the time at restaurants, at parties and at
dinner at your relatives, right? Well, what about at Stern
Hall?
Yes, Stern Hall.
