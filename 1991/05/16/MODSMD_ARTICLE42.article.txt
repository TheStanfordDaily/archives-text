# Triumphant Mem Aud concert celebrates Fleet Street's 10th anniversary
## 
### Julie Cantor 
They're almost family. You've known them
for so long, you can hardly remember a time
when you didn't know them. But you can defi
nitely remember when you met them.
It was Orientation. The lights in Memorial
Auditorium were dimmed; Dean Jean had just
finished her "Welcome to Stanford" speech.
Things were starting to drag a little, and then
they climbed onstage, dressed in tuxedos.
"What's this?" you thought, excited for a
change. But then they sang the alma mater.
"Ugh," you thought, "how dull." And when
they started to sing it again, you almost left.
Good thing you didn't.
Within minutes, "Hail, Stanford, Hail" was
your favorite song (well, the rap version, any
way) and the Fleet Street Singers were your best
friends.
Well, your best friends have been gone for a
while, singing and touring their way around
the globe, from East Coast colleges to the sandy

shores of Mexico. And you've missed them. But
they're back home at last, and they're ready to
rock Memorial Auditorium on Tuesday with
their a capella magic.
Cool. Way cool.
The upcoming concert is Fleet Street's 10th
annual spring show, and, according to inside,
anonymous sources (graduating members
Micah Friedman, Bill Grundy and Bill More), it
should be a doozy. Visual effects, Elvis imper
sonators, Billy J0e1,... OK, maybe not.
Why don't we let the men speak for them
selves? ...
Bill Grundy: It's a big deal because it's our 10th
annual spring show, and this year will probably
be the only year we'll get into Mem Aud.
Bill More: We're trying to do some new stuff.
Different stuff — to take advantage of the tech
nical possibilities of Mem Aud. But we don't
want to give away the jokes before they happen.
BG: True — humor is about surprise. I don't
think it will be significantly different from
other Spring shows; it'll be more wonderful

music.
BM: With the exception of the 62 Elvis imper
sonators, of course.
Intermission: Huh? Elvis impersonators? I'm
confused. What about alumni?
BG: Well, we do always have them come up to
sing the "Stanford Hymn" at the end. It's all
very shmaltzy. So, yeah, we're expecting several
hundred alumni there. Of course, there are
only 56 —
Micah Friedman: Fifty-two.
BG: — or something like that.
BM: But we had 16 come up on stage last year.
I: That's better than none.
BM: Yeah, that's true. There were 32 people
onstage.
BG: He counted.
BM: I didn't count. My mother counted.
I: The parents are coming?
BG: Oh, yeah! My parents are flying in from
Illinois.
I: What about the future?
MF: I think the desire is to keep getting better.

Still be a college group and not be ridiculously
high pressure, but become more and more pro
fessional — keeping the college connection as
much as we can. That's really our main
purpose, the college. Dorm shows are our —
BM: Bread and butter.
BG: Dorm shows are our bread and butter, yes.
BM: They're the most fun.
BG: It makes a big difference for us. For us to
perform two shows every Wednesday night in a
dorm with an audience that's right there in
front of you means that you can try out weird
things that you wouldn't be able to try in a big
concert. And they can fly or fall.
I: Any farewell memories? Anything slightly
risque stand out?
BG: I know one. Last year at Commencement,
when we sang the "Stanford Hymn," it was
right before the Benediction. It wasn't an
appropriate time for the rap, so we just left the
stage. The guy went up to do the Benediction,
and everyone chanted, "Rap, rap, rap ..." So
we had to go back and do it. It was magic.

BM: It's all been one big happy glow for me.
I: Any advice for the next Fleet Streeters?
BM: just never forget how fun it is. Even at the
worst moments, like if the group has to sing
and there are only two people there. The times
that we just barely managed to pull it off. If you
can manage to keep a loose and laid-back atti
tude and still look professional, then that's my
advice.
MF: :Concentrate a lot in performances.
Louder is not necessarily equal to faster. A
memory? Spring show.
BG: We've been working all year for our spring
show. It's usually a longer-than-two-hour per
formance. That's longer than Billy Joel con
cert.
BM: And cheaper too!
BG: He doesn't even do intros. He only does 20
to 22 songs.
So there you have it. Fleet Street's spring
show will be better than Billy. So be there.
You wouldn't want to let your best friends
down, would you?

Well, your best friends have been gone for a
while, singing and touring their way around
the globe, from East Coast colleges to the sandy

shores of Mexico. And you've missed them. But
they're back home at last, and they're ready to
rock Memorial Auditorium on Tuesday with
their a capella magic.
Cool. Way cool.
The upcoming concert is Fleet Street's 10th
annual spring show, and, according to inside,
anonymous sources (graduating members
Micah Friedman, Bill Grundy and Bill More), it
should be a doozy. Visual effects, Elvis imper
sonators, Billy J0e1,... OK, maybe not.
Why don't we let the men speak for them
selves? ...
Bill Grundy: It's a big deal because it's our 10th
annual spring show, and this year will probably
be the only year we'll get into Mem Aud.
Bill More: We're trying to do some new stuff.
Different stuff — to take advantage of the tech
nical possibilities of Mem Aud. But we don't
want to give away the jokes before they happen.
BG: True — humor is about surprise. I don't
think it will be significantly different from
other Spring shows; it'll be more wonderful

music.
BM: With the exception of the 62 Elvis imper
sonators, of course.
Intermission: Huh? Elvis impersonators? I'm
confused. What about alumni?
BG: Well, we do always have them come up to
sing the "Stanford Hymn" at the end. It's all
very shmaltzy. So, yeah, we're expecting several
hundred alumni there. Of course, there are
only 56 —
Micah Friedman: Fifty-two.
BG: — or something like that.
BM: But we had 16 come up on stage last year.
I: That's better than none.
BM: Yeah, that's true. There were 32 people
onstage.
BG: He counted.
BM: I didn't count. My mother counted.
I: The parents are coming?
BG: Oh, yeah! My parents are flying in from
Illinois.
I: What about the future?
MF: I think the desire is to keep getting better.

Still be a college group and not be ridiculously
high pressure, but become more and more pro
fessional — keeping the college connection as
much as we can. That's really our main
purpose, the college. Dorm shows are our —
BM: Bread and butter.
BG: Dorm shows are our bread and butter, yes.
BM: They're the most fun.
BG: It makes a big difference for us. For us to
perform two shows every Wednesday night in a
dorm with an audience that's right there in
front of you means that you can try out weird
things that you wouldn't be able to try in a big
concert. And they can fly or fall.
I: Any farewell memories? Anything slightly
risque stand out?
BG: I know one. Last year at Commencement,
when we sang the "Stanford Hymn," it was
right before the Benediction. It wasn't an
appropriate time for the rap, so we just left the
stage. The guy went up to do the Benediction,
and everyone chanted, "Rap, rap, rap ..." So
we had to go back and do it. It was magic.

BM: It's all been one big happy glow for me.
I: Any advice for the next Fleet Streeters?
BM: just never forget how fun it is. Even at the
worst moments, like if the group has to sing
and there are only two people there. The times
that we just barely managed to pull it off. If you
can manage to keep a loose and laid-back atti
tude and still look professional, then that's my
advice.
MF: :Concentrate a lot in performances.
Louder is not necessarily equal to faster. A
memory? Spring show.
BG: We've been working all year for our spring
show. It's usually a longer-than-two-hour per
formance. That's longer than Billy Joel con
cert.
BM: And cheaper too!
BG: He doesn't even do intros. He only does 20
to 22 songs.
So there you have it. Fleet Street's spring
show will be better than Billy. So be there.
You wouldn't want to let your best friends
down, would you?
