More deadly
intrigue and a
companion who
wouldn't shut up
"FX2: The Deadly Art of Illu
sion," starring Bryan Brown
and Brian Dennehy
I swear I will never talk during a
movie again.
I used to, all the time. I would say
the characters' lines before they said
them, try to figure out what was going
to happen next before it happened and
generally make a nuisance of myself.
But I wasn't aware of it. Well, not
really.
Until I saw "FX2: The Deadly Art of
Illusion."
The person I went to see this movie
with — let's call him "Ted," just for
simplicity's sake — did exactly what I
used to do: talked incessantly. I mean
all the time. Without stopping.
"So Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown)
killed the cop!" he exclaimed. "No, the
Peeping Tom killed the cop!" he
shouted. "No, wait, the cop killed him
self!" he yelled (and I do mean yelled).
I almost killed him. Lucky for him,
he drove to the theater and I needed a
ride home.
Otherwise, Ted would have been as
dead as the most dead person in the
movie.
Which brings us to the movie.
"FX2" is the sequel (No, really?) to the
1986 thriller "F/X," hence the name.
Usually, when reviewing a sequel, I like
to bring in the basic plot of the original
film. But I can't. I don't remember it.
So much for journalistic style.
In "FX2," Tyler and Leo McCarthy
(Brian Dennehy) are reunited to
uncover a police cover-up — one that
is potentially dangerous to Tyler's life.
You see, Tyler was hired to return to
his abandoned career of special effects
in order to protect a model from a

potential killer. A quick, easy, basic job.
Or so he thought. As tends to happen
in movies, however, something went
wrong, someone got killed and Tyler
was the only one who witnessed it.
And, of course, the killers know
this.
Simplistic? Yes. But it works fairly
well.
However, it apparently was not
simplistic enough for Ted. Because his
constant chatter wasn't only irritating,
it was wrong. Dead wrong. It couldn't
have been more wrong.
When Ted said they'd kill Tyler's
girlfriend, they didn't. When he said
they'd kill Tyler, they didn't. When he
said they wouldn't kill McCarthy's girl
friend, they did. Good thing I wasn't
relying on Ted for insight.
At least when / talk during a movie,
I'm right.
Better luck next time, Ted.

Sex, gender
and simplistic
humor in
'Switch'
"Switch," starring Ellen Bar kin,
Jimmy Smits, Joßeth Williams
and Perry King
Blake Edwards' new sex-change
comedy, "Switch," delivers exactly
what it promises: a dumb, occasionally
funny and ultimately forgettable entry
in the body-switch genre of films made
so popular a few years ago with "Big"
and "Like Father, Like Son."
Steve (Perry King) is a male chau
vinist pig who is murdered by three
former mistresses. In purgatory, God
orders him to return to Earth and find
one woman who actually likes him. If
successful, he will be allowed into
heaven when he dies again. If not, he
goes to hell.

Well, before you can say "transsex
ual," Steve gets an added bonus to his
second chance on Earth: He's brought
back as a gorgeous blonde (Ellen
Barkin).
At this point, one would expect the
fun to begin, and for a brief moment
or two, it does: One early hilarious
sequence has Steve (now named
Amanda) gleefully feeling his/her own
breasts. But once the man-in-a
woman's-body premise is established,
the film fails to move in any direction.
Instead of exploring the psycholog
ical and humorous — not to mention
provocative — consequences of a
chauvinistic heterosexual man in a
woman's body, "Switch" aims for
cheap laughs. There are too many gags
showing Amanda stumbling on her

high heels, and too many fight scenes
designed to illustrate her hidden mas
culinity.
Edwards shies away from contro
versy, opting instead for a mainstream,
pseudo-feminist slapstick comedy.
Imagine how much more interesting
"Switch" would have been if Amanda,
still plagued by Steve's sex drive, had to
cope with being attracted to a woman?
Or if she realized how difficult it was to
be a sexy blonde in a tight dress work
ing in a male-dominated setting?
Unlike "Tootsie," which featured such
profound observations, "Switch" goes
for sex jokes and one-liners (and a joy
ously resolved rape that is bound to
offend).
Barkin, a quirky-looking actress
who can be compelling no matter what

she's doing, plays Amanda with gusto.
She saves the film from total disaster
with her physical performance —
when she walks briskly down a hall
with exaggerated manliness, she not
only manages to be funny but also is
remarkably on target, conveying the
inherent braggadocio so prevalent in
the American male.
In the end, however, "Switch" suf
fers from being sent through the Hol
lywood hit factory. Glossed over with a
paint-by-numbers, mainstream for
mula, it never manages to be as inter
esting or controversial as it could have
been. It's just another dumb Edwards
comedy (and there are many) that fails
to deliver more than a few clever jokes.

Madonna dares
to tell the tnith
"Truth or Dare," starring
Madonna
Much publicity has been given to
the latest Madonna Event, the eagerly
awaited (at least on my part) docu
mentary film about last year's Blond
Ambition concert tour. Hyped for
months as a two-hour tell-all session
in which the real Madonna is exposed,
"Truth or Dare" manages to be a fasci
nating look at the hectic and not-so
glamorous life of the world's sexiest —
and most successful — celebrity.
Part concert film, part documen
tary, "Truth or Dare" follows Madonna
on tour from a rain-soaked show in
lapan to a near-riotous appearance in
Europe. Along the way, we see the
Material Girl babysit her temperamen
tal dancers, wake up with no makeup
on and gloriously rip into Kevin Cost
ner for describing her show as "neat."
Oh yeah, she also simulates oral sex
with a bottle of sparkling water and
exposes her breasts after a show.
"Truth or Dare" offers several
revealing glimpses (heh, heh) of the
pop star's persona, and this makes the
film undeniably compelling; many
aspects of Madonna's life are not as
they seem.
For example, in spite of her glam
orous, party-all-night lifestyle,
Madonna often appears lonely and
exhausted. Several scenes in the film
reflect this, such as the one in which
Madonna returns to her hotel after a
show, puts the "Do Not Disturb" sign

on her door and is asleep within min
utes ... alone. Or the time she arrives
at a party in filmmaker Pedro Aimod
ovar's honor, and is ecstatic to meet a
handsome young actor whom she has
a crush on — until she finds out he is
married. At this point, the slightly
deflated Madonna retreats to the bath
room for a pep talk with her girl
friends.
Yes, folks, even the Boy Toy faces
rejection. What is the world coming
to?
In spite of such insightful
moments, however, "Truth or Dare" is
essentially nothing more than an
extended Madonna performance. She's
raunchy, aggressive, bossy and sexual
— exactly what you'd expect after
watching the "Express Yourself" video.
But one gets the feeling this is just
another video, as many scenes seem
acted out and staged.
For example, at one point,
Madonna lies down on top of her
mother's grave and explains how she
plans to be buried next to her. In
another sequence, she talks to her
father on the phone, reassuring him
that her show is not as racy as he might
expect. (Boy is he in for a surprise.)
While this may sound like more "real
life" Madonna, it doesn't come across
as natural.
Director Alek Kesheshian aimed to
contrast Madonna-the-act with
Madonna-the-person, so interspersed
with the black-and-white footage of
Madonna's life behind the scenes are
color sequences of her concert perfor
mances. This juxtaposition works well.
The concert scenes, while annoyingly
cut to diminish Madonna's talents as a
dancer, manage to capture the singer at
her most versatile. Whether you like
her or not, you'll be swept away by her
stage presence and unflagging, aggres
sive delivery of such songs as "Holi
day," "Keep It Together" and "Express
Yourself."
"Truth or Dare" is one of the more
fascinating films of the last few years, if
only because it features raw footage of
one of the most fascinating icons of the
last few decades. While most of the
movie documents Madonna doing
what she does best (being playfully
raunchy and provocative, both onstage
and off), there are, nevertheless, a few
glimpses of a lonely, nurturing and
very funny woman who is almost as
human as we are. For this alone,
"Truth or Dare" is not to be missed.

She may appear to be a woman, but she has the soul of a man. Ellen Barkin
portrays Amanda (Steve) Brooks in a comedy of "Switch"ed identity.
