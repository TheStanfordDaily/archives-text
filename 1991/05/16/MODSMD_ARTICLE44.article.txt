# Pomp and polka dots at the Senior Formal
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Saturday night witnessed a mass infusion of fan
cily clad Stanford seniors and their associates to the
Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Two regal
ballrooms, one mirrored hall and one coat-check
room of the St. Francis were stuffed with the approx
imately 1,000 people attending the Senior Class For
mal.
The Ball, one of the most celebrated Stanford
social events of the year, afforded men the opportu
nity to spend $75 for a tuxedo, and, for weeks before
hand, allowed women to produce poofy gowns from
their closets and ask, "Can I get away with this prom
dress again?"
Of course, not everyone faced these identical
questions. Many men bypassed tuxedo peer pressure
and simply wore jackets and ties. One even refused to
succumb to tie pressure and wore just a T-shirt (and
slacks). Several men donned security suits.
The favorite dress for women was a classic black
velvet, leading to much confusion among men, who
had to go from velvet woman to velvet woman ask
ing, "Are you my date?"
Polka dot-clad women also came out in numbers,
possibly because last-minute shoppers all poured
into Macy's, where many of the dresses were spotted.
Crinoline-wearing plummeted this year, as women
had a collective realization that wearing the puffy
material prevented their dates from getting within 10
feet of them.
When the hotel security saw the sequined dresses
streaming in, they mercifully turned down the lights
to avoid the glare. However, several women still
managed to find some light to reflect.
Several freshmen made their social debut at the
dance, walking hand-in-hand with their senior dates,
who were heard explaining, "She's a very mature 18,"

or "He's really supposed to be a sophomore."
One ballroom featured a rock band, the other a
large screen displaying videos. Rooms were deco
rated with huge bouquets of black, red and white
balloons, with security guards standing by them to
make sure nobody got out of control with the
helium.
The party began at 9 p.m., but was not in full
swing until 11:30 p.m., when people started experi
encing energy bursts from the cheese, fruit and water
generously offered for free with the purchase of the
$55 ticket.

Rooms were decorated with
huge bouquets of blacky red and
white balloons, with security
guards standing by them to
ensure that nobody got out of
control with the helium.

"Fifty-five dollars for this?" was a common
refrain throughout the evening, second only to the
question, "How did you say you snuck in?"
For couples who attended the dance for three
hours — the average attendance span — the actual
per capita cost was a mere $9.17 per hour. Couples
received bronze key chains with a '91 engraved on
one side and a "Centennial Seniors, Stanford Univer
sity Senior Formal" on the other. The prize, esti
mated retail value $3.50, knocked the average per
capita cost down to a minuscule $8 per hour. And for
those bargain hunters who walked off with the water

glasses (my date, for instance) or a slab of leftover
cheese, the price sank as low as $6 an hour.
Many couples agreed that the dance was worth
the time and financial investment, although few
broke out into celebratory song afterward and only
30 percent of those who commented, "I had the time
of my life!" were serious.
While only one or two couples erupted into
vicious battle, common expletives were "Stop step
ping on my toes!" "Your date keeps elbowing mine!"
"Why did I bring him?!" "Why did you come?"
"You're sweating all over me!" and"The wedding is
off!"
The dance gave seniors a chance to re-discover
their roots by glimpsing long-lost members of their
freshman dorm. Noting who was with whom was
also a popular activity, but the crowds made it diffi
cult to know if couples with their hands on each
other were actually together, or just two parts of sep
arate couples accidentally shoved together by the
crowd. The dark rooms added to the confusion,
although most people were able to re-locate their
dates by the end of the evening.
The St. Francis offered 20 of their hotel rooms to
formal-goers at $135 each, instead of the usual $185.
Not a bad deal, but still $95 more than El Camino's
Glass Slipper Inn. By 1 a.m., all of those who had
taken advantage of the $50 discount had retreated
into the bowels of the hotel. But the dance lasted 45
minutes past the scheduled ending time of 1 a.m.,
allowing latecomers the opportunity to eke out more
fun and permitting those who left at 1 a.m. the
chance to feel good for not remaining until the bitter
end.
Most seniors breathed a sigh of relief when the
exhausting event was over and they could leave, with
a collection of gossip to last several weeks, life-long
memories safely enshrined in their brains and brass
key chains in their pockets.

Rooms were decorated with
huge bouquets of blacky red and
white balloons, with security
guards standing by them to
ensure that nobody got out of
control with the helium.

"Fifty-five dollars for this?" was a common
refrain throughout the evening, second only to the
question, "How did you say you snuck in?"
For couples who attended the dance for three
hours — the average attendance span — the actual
per capita cost was a mere $9.17 per hour. Couples
received bronze key chains with a '91 engraved on
one side and a "Centennial Seniors, Stanford Univer
sity Senior Formal" on the other. The prize, esti
mated retail value $3.50, knocked the average per
capita cost down to a minuscule $8 per hour. And for
those bargain hunters who walked off with the water

glasses (my date, for instance) or a slab of leftover
cheese, the price sank as low as $6 an hour.
Many couples agreed that the dance was worth
the time and financial investment, although few
broke out into celebratory song afterward and only
30 percent of those who commented, "I had the time
of my life!" were serious.
While only one or two couples erupted into
vicious battle, common expletives were "Stop step
ping on my toes!" "Your date keeps elbowing mine!"
"Why did I bring him?!" "Why did you come?"
"You're sweating all over me!" and"The wedding is
off!"
The dance gave seniors a chance to re-discover
their roots by glimpsing long-lost members of their
freshman dorm. Noting who was with whom was
also a popular activity, but the crowds made it diffi
cult to know if couples with their hands on each
other were actually together, or just two parts of sep
arate couples accidentally shoved together by the
crowd. The dark rooms added to the confusion,
although most people were able to re-locate their
dates by the end of the evening.
The St. Francis offered 20 of their hotel rooms to
formal-goers at $135 each, instead of the usual $185.
Not a bad deal, but still $95 more than El Camino's
Glass Slipper Inn. By 1 a.m., all of those who had
taken advantage of the $50 discount had retreated
into the bowels of the hotel. But the dance lasted 45
minutes past the scheduled ending time of 1 a.m.,
allowing latecomers the opportunity to eke out more
fun and permitting those who left at 1 a.m. the
chance to feel good for not remaining until the bitter
end.
Most seniors breathed a sigh of relief when the
exhausting event was over and they could leave, with
a collection of gossip to last several weeks, life-long
memories safely enshrined in their brains and brass
key chains in their pockets.
