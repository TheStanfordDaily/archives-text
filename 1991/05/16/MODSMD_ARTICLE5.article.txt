# Fraternity may give up house
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Members of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity are
planning to give up their house next fall, and the
house will be placed in next year's Draw, according to
a fraternity member and an Interfraternity Council
official.
Although Samer Hamadeh, the Theta Delt resi
dent assistant, would not specify the reasons for the
move, IFC president Erik Jorgensen said the Theta
Delts are giving the house up "because a lot of the
members want to move out of the house and live off
campus next year."
This came as a surprise to IFC members, since the
University officially recognized Monday that the
Theta Delts had met their pledge quota and are in no
danger of losing their house.
"We did make our quota. We have not lost the
house," Hamadeh said, explaining that any actions
taken in the near future regarding the house will be
initiated by the fraternity, not the University.
Because the Theta Delts and the University have
not yet come to a conclusion regarding the fate of the
house next fall, Jorgensen suggested that the house
may be a "walk-on, wait-list type of thing" operated
by the University.
But Hamadeh stressed that "nothing has been
worked out" with the University.
These developments sparked a long conversation
in last night's unusually-long IFC meeting. In addi
tion to electing new members, IFC members dis
cussed ways to keep the house within the fraternity
system.
Jorgensen said, "The University reached an
agreement with (the Theta Delts) that they would
get (the house) back whenever they wanted it." Uni
versity officials could not be reached for comment
last night.
"They'd rather let the University take care of it
the next couple of years and take it back when they
are ready" in a few years, Jorgensen explained. "But
we just don't think that's an equitable solution."
"As I see it, the Theta Delts are as good as gone
after this year," Jorgensen said.
"Since the Theta Delts are moving out, we want
one unhoused fraternity to move in." said senior Joe
Reilly, an IFC representative from Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, a housed fraternity.
"I definitely think some sort of
action must be taken," said sopho
more Bryan Spaulding, a member
of Phi Delta Theta.
Jorgensen and president-elect
Steve Jarrett are hoping to meet
with Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson and
Office of Student Activities Direc
tor Nanci Howe today to discuss
the matter.
Several IFC members also
expressed interest in organizing a
lunch-time rally in White Plaza
some time next week so that stu
dents, faculty and staff could show
support for the Greek system in
general and for keeping the Theta
Delt house for fraternities.
