# Bulletin boards link gay students

When "Margaret" was coming
out of the closet earlier this year,
she wanted to get in touch with
the heart of Stanford's gay com
munity
And through a computer key
board, she found it at her finger
tips.
"Granted, a computer network
isn't the most 'personable' way to
learn about a community of real
live human beings," she said.
But, she added, "it was a rela
tively easy way for a scared, con
fused neophyte in the realm of gay
consciousness to slowly soak up
the names, events, organizations,
issues and yes, even personalities
in the Stanford gay/lesbian/bisex
ual community."
Members of the gay commu
nity say Margaret, a senior, is just
one of many gays, lesbians and
bisexuals who find computer bul
letin boards a comfortable envi
ronment for exploring and dis
cussing their sexuality.
Stanford mainframes enable

students, faculty and staff to
access several gay-oriented elec
tronic bulletin boards. Some read
"bboard gay" on their Macbeth
accounts, which will be phased
out in June. Most, however, sub
scribe to any of several bulletin
boards discussing gay issues on a
mainframe machine called
Leland.
On Iceland, Stanford students
generally read and post messages
to a bulletin board known as
"su.gay." Other gay bulletin boards
include "soc.motss," "ba.motss,"
and "alt.motss." These names
inform potential readers of the
content of the bulletin boards, or
"news groups."
"Motss," for example, is an
acronym for "members of the
same sex," "ba" stands for "Bay
Area," and so on.
Many feel that picking from
one of these news groups is sim
pler than going up the sometimes
daunting steps of the Fire Truck
House, where the lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
is located.
"A lot of gay people are afraid of

approaching the community. A lot
of people don't know whether
they're gay — they just know that
they have some unresolved sexual
feelings," said Stuart Reges, a for
mer senior lecturer in computer
science.
He added, "They have never
heard gay people talk; they've just
heard fag jokes. So to listen in on
their conversation is a great
thing."
Back in April 1984, Reges initi
ated the first Stanford-based gay
bulletin board on Macbeth. In an
open letter, he wrote, "I've been at
Stanford and LOTS for over four
years now, and I've never known a
time when there have been so
many gay people on the system."
Reges said he set up the bul
letin board as an experiment,
offering to forward messages for
people who wanted to remain
anonymous.
"Actually, I had no idea how it
would turn out," Reges said,
seven years later. "For a while 1
would talk to friends of mine and

say 'Won't you post something so
it's not all from me?' "
Numbers sketchy
Eventually the idea caught on.
While an accurate count of the
number of people who currently
read the bulletin boards is impos
sible, Reges said 1,071 current
users have read "bboard gay" on
Macbeth at some point over the
past seven years.
This number, which would
make it the third most widely read
bulletin board at Stanford, does

not include users who have left
the University or who read the
bulletin board from different
machines, Reges added.
A recent survey of news groups
found 87 people read "su.gay,"
said Paul Traina, a systems pro
grammer at Academic Informa
tion Resources. But the actual
number of readers could be up to
three times as many because of
flaws in the counting process, he
added.
Users say the news groups pro
vide a quick way to keep informed
on community developments. In a
cross between a post office and a
telephone line, the bulletin boards
allow for a continuous conversa
tion to take place.

Daniel Dermer, a senior in psy
chology, said he has been reading
the bulletin board on Macbeth
since his freshman year, posting
occasional messages. "It's a really
big social tool for the community,"
he said. "It's a good way to get
word out quickly."
"Whenever anything major has
happened in the gay community,
it's always discussed on the bul
letin board," Reges added. "Even
when there isn't something par
ticularly important going on, a
discussion will be spontaneously
generated on issues like gay par
enting, [orl coming out to par
ents."
Such discussions often start on
the bulletin board and spread out
ward, said senior Chris Hayes.
"Occasionally, people who don't
want their names to appear on the
bulletin board have sent me mail
asking me to post things for

them," he added.
Reges said he has archived the
first seven years of the Macbeth
bulletin board up until four
months ago when Macbeth
stopped providing the service. The
information in those files could
prove valuable to a study of Stan
ford's gay community, he added.
Some students also use com
mercial bulletin boards, which
provide a type of dating service as
well as a forum to discuss issues.
There are about four or five such
bulletin boards in the Bay Area,
users estimate.
Charles Goldman, a doctoral
candidate at the Graduate School
of Business, met his lover of a
year-and-a-half through one such
bulletin board. "We had an elec
tronic conversation that lasted
hours and hours before we
switched over to the phone," he
said.
