# Bulletin boards link gay students

When "Margaret" was coming
out of the closet earlier this year,
she wanted to get in touch with
the heart of Stanford's gay com
munity
And through a computer key
board, she found it at her finger
tips.
"Granted, a computer network
isn't the most 'personable' way to
learn about a community of real
live human beings," she said.
But, she added, "it was a rela
tively easy way for a scared, con
fused neophyte in the realm of gay
consciousness to slowly soak up
the names, events, organizations,
issues and yes, even personalities
in the Stanford gay/lesbian/bisex
ual community."
Members of the gay commu
nity say Margaret, a senior, is just
one of many gays, lesbians and
bisexuals who find computer bul
letin boards a comfortable envi
ronment for exploring and dis
cussing their sexuality.
Stanford mainframes enable

students, faculty and staff to
access several gay-oriented elec
tronic bulletin boards. Some read
"bboard gay" on their Macbeth
accounts, which will be phased
out in June. Most, however, sub
scribe to any of several bulletin
boards discussing gay issues on a
mainframe machine called
Leland.
On Iceland, Stanford students
generally read and post messages
to a bulletin board known as
"su.gay." Other gay bulletin boards
include "soc.motss," "ba.motss,"
and "alt.motss." These names
inform potential readers of the
content of the bulletin boards, or
"news groups."
"Motss," for example, is an
acronym for "members of the
same sex," "ba" stands for "Bay
Area," and so on.
Many feel that picking from
one of these news groups is sim
pler than going up the sometimes
daunting steps of the Fire Truck
House, where the lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
is located.
"A lot of gay people are afraid of

approaching the community. A lot
of people don't know whether
they're gay — they just know that
they have some unresolved sexual
feelings," said Stuart Reges, a for
mer senior lecturer in computer
science.
He added, "They have never
heard gay people talk; they've just
heard fag jokes. So to listen in on
their conversation is a great
thing."
Back in April 1984, Reges initi
ated the first Stanford-based gay
bulletin board on Macbeth. In an
open letter, he wrote, "I've been at
Stanford and LOTS for over four
years now, and I've never known a
time when there have been so
many gay people on the system."
Reges said he set up the bul
letin board as an experiment,
offering to forward messages for
people who wanted to remain
anonymous.
"Actually, I had no idea how it
would turn out," Reges said,
seven years later. "For a while 1
would talk to friends of mine and

One step beyond
Members of Stanford's chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha strut their stuff in an annual step show. From
100 to 200 people gathered to watch the performance in front of the Law School yesterday evening.
