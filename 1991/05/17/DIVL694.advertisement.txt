you and your neighbors have a voice in deciding
whether The Monitor Channel, the one network
with an 80-year tradition of in-depth and unbiased
international reporting, comes to Palo Alto.
If you've read The Christian Science Monitor or World Monitor
magazine, or have seen World Monitor on I he Discovery Channel,
you've already had a taste of Pulitzer Prize-winning Monitor Journalism.
Now with The Monitor Channel you'll have an entire network dedicated
to providing you with an understanding of who, what, when, where and
most importantly, why world events take place.
The Monitor Channel also offers a solid line-up of news, information and
entertainment for your whole family. With shows that range from analysis and
commentary, to sports and gardening. Plus children's programs and afterschool
specials. And a worldwide array of exclusive documentaries that are more
like adventures than television.
