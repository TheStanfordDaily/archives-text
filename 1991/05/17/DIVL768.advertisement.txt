If there is one thing you've learned at Stanford, it has been the necessity of the
Macintosh computer. You've come to rely upon these convenient machines over
your four years here on The Farm - from those dark and lonely finals nights to the
many study breaks spent playing computer games (admit it). You've come to
appreciate those sharp laser
written papers, the fast
spreadsheet calculations, and
the myriad of software
packages available for the
Macintosh which all work in
the same, consistent, manner.
Now as the end of your
Stanford career comes near
and you become one step
closer to the "real" world, how
can you leave this place and
ever survive without a
Macintosh?
So before you leave Stanford,
finish off that final
requirement and buy a
Macintosh. Buy one now, at
student prices. Once you i \
graduate you can still buy a
Macintosh, but then, only at a
"real" world price.
