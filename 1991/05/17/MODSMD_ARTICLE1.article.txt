# Fac Sen shelves partners debate
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Following 90 minutes of con
tentious debate, a sharply divided
Faculty Senate yesterday voted to
postpone indefinitely its consider
ation of a measure urging the
administration to offer gay and
lesbian partners the same benefits
currently given spouses of faculty
and staff.
Supporters of the bill had
called on senators to make a state
ment "of principle" asking Uni
versity administrators to rectify
benefits policies which they say
discriminate against gay and les
bian employees.
But by a 22-20 vote the senate
sent the bill back to the Univer
sity's Committee on Faculty and
Staff Benefits for further study of
the costs and legal implications of
extending spousal benefits to
same-sex couples in committed
relationships. The review will
likely take several months.
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, the
bill's sponsor, criticized the move,
saying it was an effort to "put a
price tag on principles."
Rhode's measure calls for the
extension of all spousal benefits,
including:
• Dental and medical plans,
• Accident insurance,
• Reduced tuition for children
attending the University, and
• Use of University libraries
and athletic facilities.
Yesterday's senate action
marked the latest setback for a
bill that has been surrounded by
controversy.
Under senate rules, resolutions
passed by the ASSU or petitions
signed by more than 50 faculty
members can be placed on the
Faculty Senate's agenda for dis
cussion.
The ASSU approved a faculty
and staff "benefits parity" resolu
tion in late February. Subse
quently, 71 faculty members
signed a petition calling for intro
duction of a similar bill in the Fac
ulty Senate, prompting the intro
duction last month of a measure
authored by Prof. Katherine
O'Hanlan and sponsored by
Rhode.
But rather than allowing the
bill to come to the senate floor for
discussion at its April 18 meeting,
Prof. Charles Kruger, the senate
chair, announced that the senate's
steering committee was introduc
ing an alternative measure. The
alternative measure, which
passed last month on a divided
voice vote, sent Rhode's bill to the
University's benefits committee
for further examination. The pro
cedure prompted accusations of
"stonewalling" from some sena
tors.
