# Japanese condoms score big in fifth annual rubber match
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
The results of this year's Great
Condom Rating Contest have
been released, once again proving
that Japanese technology encom
passes more than cars, televisions
and movie dubbing.
For the fourth year in a row, a
Japanese company led the field.
This year's winner, Kimono, tri
umphed in four categories, includ
ing overall performance.
In an unprecedented coup,
Kimono ousted the three-year
title holder, Crown, also known in
the United States as Skinless
Skin.
The contest, now in its fifth
year, was organized by the Stan
ford AIDS Education Project. The
project distributed more than
2,000 free packets of condoms
from a table in White Plaza during
a three-day period this February.
The packets also included bal
lots, on which students were
asked to rank the condoms in the
categories of comfort, appearance,
security, lubrication, smell, taste
and overall performance. They

could also include additional com
ments on their ballots.
Only about 25 of the ballots
were returned.
One respondent wrote, "Smells
like fish, has brown spots — I
wouldn't lick one of these."
Packets were handed out to a
diverse group of people, including
University President Donald
Kennedy and a member of
Gideon's International, who took
time out of his schedule of dis
tributing copies of the New Testa
ment to snap up a packet.
The condoms were donated by
several condom manufacturers —
three Japanese, two Swedish and
two American.
On the whole, survey partici
pants found the Japanese con
doms to be thinner, more sensitive
and just as strong as American
brands.
Survey respondents dismissed
rumors that Japanese brands are
too tight. Kimonos, for instance,
can reach sizes as large as three
feet long and a foot in diameter,
project members say.
"If your lover is bigger than
that," warns project member Pat

Dote, "you should head for the
hills."
When asked why Japanese
brands have been historically
superior, Dote said Japanese con
doms are supported by the gov

ernment and advertised on televi
sion.
This year, organizers decided
not to include Trojan condoms,
saying they wanted to use other,
less known brands to show people

the diversity that exists.
Furthermore, project member
Rachel Maddow comments, Tro
jans are "butt-white, clinical and
smell like old tires. Why would
you want to roll a rubber tire on

your schlonger?"
Although the coordinators of
the project say they were disap
pointed with the low return rates,
they are glad they were able to dis
tribute so many condoms.
