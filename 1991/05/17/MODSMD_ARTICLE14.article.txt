# Education students split on merits of new credentialing
## 
### Tahira Boyd Staff writer 
The state's introduction of more difficult exami
nations for the credentialing of high school teachers
will not affect most current Stanford education stu
dents, since most are already accredited.
Even so, many students here believe such changes
in the credentialing process are necessary and will
help ensure better teacher quality in the future. But
some worry that the tests cannot determine who will
be a good teacher.
The California Commission on Teacher Creden
tialing, a state agency that establishes and adminis
ters standards for teaching credentials, will imple
ment the new tests in November. Two years ago, the
Commission appointed panels of teachers and cur
riculum specialists to develop new exams in English,
mathematics, life science, physical science and social
science.
David Wright, director of the commission's Pro
fessional Services Division, said the exams were
changed in these areas because the largest number
of teacher candidates wants to teach in these disci

plines.
"Many changes have taken place in school cur
riculum, so the teachers' knowledge needs to be cur
rent," Wright said. "The second reason is that
changes have occurred at the university level of
teaching future educators."
The new tests have been extensively field-tested
in California. Leela Chowdhury, a Stanford master's
student in English education, took the credentialing
exam with experimental parts containing two essays.
"The new parts are better gauges of competence,"
she said. "No essay sections existed before, only mul
tiple choice."
Nicole Holthuis, a master's student who wants to
teach high school science, said she supports a change
in the credentialing process but is unsure whether
the commission's changes are necessary.
"Being a good teacher cannot be measured by a
standardized test," Holthuis said.
Karen Dennen, a master's student who will teach
high school biology, said she believes that the
changes in the exam are not challenging enough. "I
think that you could easily pass the test, but that
does not mean that you will be a good teacher."
