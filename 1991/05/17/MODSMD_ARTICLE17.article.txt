Sino-Soviet border treaty signed
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet Union and
China signed an agreement yesterday settling
part of the decades-old border dispute.
Chinese Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin,
the first party chief to visit the Soviet Union
since Mao Tse-tung in 1957, also discussed eco
nomic issues with Prime Minister Valentin
Pavlov and met with Anatoly Lukyanov, chair
man of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
The border agreement was signed in the
Kremlin by Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh and his Chinese counterpart,
Qian Qichen.
Soviet and Chinese diplomats said earlier
this week the agreement would exclude trouble
some areas including islands in the Amur River,
over which the countries clashed in 1969.
Pakistan adopts Koranic law
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Parliament
yesterday passed a controversial Islamic mea
sure called shariah that would make the Koran
the supreme law of Pakistan and subject all
aspects of life to Islamic tenets.
The law will govern all aspects of Pakistani
life from social mores to education and the
economy. It will frame laws in line with the
Koran, and the Sunnah, a collection of the
teachings of the prophet Mohammad.
The bill was passed by a "voice vote," which
is not accompanied by a vote count. An esti
mated 120 members of Pakistan's 237-member
national assembly were present.
War trials begin in Kuwait
KUWAIT CITY (AP) - The government
said yesterday that trials for defendants
accused of collaborating with Iraq during its
occupation of Kuwait will begin Sunday, a day
later than previously announced.
At least 628 people face charges of assisting
the Iraqis and other war crimes. Many could face
the death penalty at their martial law trials.
In another development, five members of an
opposition group, detained last week for
putting up posters without permission, were
released yesterday, said opposition leader Eisa
al-Shaheen.
The five were detained while taping up
posters that welcomed home returning
Kuwaitis on behalf of the Islamic Constitu
tional Movement. The movement is considered
the strongest opposition force in Kuwait. Polit
ical parties are outlawed in the emirate.
Senate approves probe into
Reagan-hostages issue
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House Demo
cratic leadership has quietly approved a prelimi
nary staff investigation into whether the 1980
Reagan-Bush campaign against President Jimmy
Carter conspired with Iran to delay release of
American hostages until after the election.
But aides looking into the matter already
have disproved an allegation that President
Bush, then the vice presidential candidate,
secretly met with Iranian representatives in
Paris in October of 1980, one source said.
