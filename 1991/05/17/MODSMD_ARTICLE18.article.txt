## Soviets agree on new economic program 
### 
MOSCOW (A P) â€” President
Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday banned
strikes in the coal, oil, natural gas and
other industries in order to prevent
economic chaos he warned could cost
millions of jobs.
Gorbachev's decree was issued
hours after Soviet Prime Minister
Valentin Pavlov announced leaders of
the Soviet Union and 13 of the 15
republics had agreed on an "anti-crisis
program" to shift from central plan
ning toward a more market-oriented
economy.
The measures are the latest seeking
to halt the collapse of the Soviet econ
omy, which has been hit by walkouts,
rising costs and shortages of many
basic consumer goods.
In Washington, CIA officials told a
congressional committee yesterday
that the Soviet economy could decline
by up to 15 percent in 1991 and experi
ence an inflation rate of more than 100

percent if frictions continue between
the Kremlin and the republics.
Gorbachev, meanwhile, said the
Soviet equivalent of Gross National
Product had dropped 10 percent since
January and strikes and other eco
nomic disruptions "threaten to stop
thousands of enterprises, which will
have to lay off millions people," the
state news agency Tass reported.
The Soviet president, using emer
gency powers given him by the
national legislature, threatened crimi
nal proceedings against those who
instigate strikes in the coal, oil, natu
ral gas, chemical and petrochemical
industries.
Coal miners ended a two-month
walkout this month after Gorbachev
agreed to turn over the mines and
most of the nation's other industrial
and natural resources to the 15 Soviet
republics. The miners had ignored
appeals by Gorbachev and resolutions

by the Supreme Soviet legislature urg
ing them to return to work.
The deal to transfer coal mines and
other enterprises from central control
was part of a broader economy reform
plan struck April 23 between Russian
leader Boris N. Yeltsin and leaders of
eight other republics. The accord
helped Gorbachev fend off a call for his
resignation by hard-line members of
the Central Committee of the Commu
nist Party.
Pavlov, appearing at a news confer
ence, gave few details of the plan,
which was agreed upon Wednesday.
But he said central authorities would
play a smaller role in setting prices and
drawing up supply contracts among
individual businesses.
Pavlov's deputy, Vladimir
Shcherbakov, said cuts were planned
in the central government and on
defense spending.
The plan drew immediate criticism

from the Baltic republic of Estonia,
whose leaders said the Kremlin was
demanding $302 million as Estonia's
contribution to the Soviet budget.
Georgia also did not back the plan.
A key element, he said, was closer
integration of the Soviet economy into
Europe. Soviet cooperation with
Europe "should be linked with our
ability to supply energy. This will serve
as the locomotive that will draw our
economy toward Western economies."
The Soviets would continue to sell
oil, natural gas and electricity to
Europe, he said.
Shcherbakov said spending on the
central planning bureaucracy should
be reduced by at least 50 percent. He
did not provide figures for reductions
in defense spending or the vast num
ber of Communist Party and govern
ment bureaucrats who for decades
have managed the centralized econ
omy.
