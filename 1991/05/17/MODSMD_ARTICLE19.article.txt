# Kurdish refugees overburden allied camps

### 
ZAKHO, Iraq (AP) — Tens of thousands of Kurds
from outside the allied security zone are cramming
refugee camps and pitching tent settlements in
northern Iraq, creating a major problem for the
coalition forces trying to get them home, officials
said yesterday.
They said they could not put up tents fast enough

for the refugees, with over 10,000 people coming
down from the mountains on Wednesday alone.
Most of the refugees are refusing to go to their
towns because they remain in the hands of Iraqi
forces.
The development is putting new pressure on the
coalition to extend its 3,600-square-mile security

zone to include the provincial capital of Dohuk,
home to many of the refugees.
"If we don't go down there, we could wind up with
a quarter-million people here, which would be
crazy," said U.S. Maj. Gen. Jay Garner, commander
of the coalition forces in northern Iraq.
Already, the U.S.-built refugee camps in the
northern city of Zakho are overflowing, with about
55,000 refugees.
The Iraqis are arriving so quickly the camps ran
out of tents on Tuesday, officials said.
"Every tent that we possess is either on a truck
heading for Zakho or is up at Zakho," said Lt. Col.
Philip Crowley, a spokesman for the allied effort at
the Incirlik base in Turkey.
He said refugees who had left homes within the
secure area were returning to them. He said Zakho's
pre-exodus population of 52,000 was almost all back
in the city. The same applied in smaller communi
ties.
Some of the refugees were returning from Iran,
where about 1.2 million Iraqis sought shelter when
the Iraqi army crushed the Kurdish rebellion in late
March.
Another 450,000 Iraqi Kurds fled to the Turkish
border, where they had been living in squalid camps.
More than half of them have returned to Iraq.
In addition to the refugees at the Zakho settle
ments, more than 15,000 other Iraqis have set up
camp near a British "way station" at Kani Masi,
originally intended for Kurds going to their homes.
U.S. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the overall com
mander of the allied forces involved in the resettle
ment operation, said Wednesday that the allies coulc
not "precede the Kurds into every town and village.
He indicated the allies would not add Dohuk tt
the security zone. The city was home to 350,000 peo
pie, before most fled in the exodus.
Baghdad has strenuously opposed losing contro
of the city, fearing it would give the allies easy access
to the major oil-producing city further south.
On the allied side there is also reluctance. Moving
into the city could mean a longer stay and more
troops involved.
