## An ode to the Draw 
### 
Housing lottery will no
longer offer false sense
of control over fate

ONE OF STANFORD'S MORE
infamous traditions is com
ing to an end. The Draw,
that anticipated and dreaded rite of
spring, will be performed by com
puter after this year. The computer
will list draw groups in a random
order and assign them, one by one,
to the housing they prefer.
Students can put away their rab
bit's feet, lucky charms and draw
ing strategies. Spring quarter just
won't be the same.
No longer will students step ner
vously up to boxes of white, num
bered cards, cards that could mean
anything from a luxurious single in
Roble Hall to a cramped apartment
in Kalamazoo.
No more will the spring air be
thick with the cry of "Have you
drawn yet? What's your number?"
No longer will draw groups
devise strategies among them
selves, deciding which member is
the "luckiest" and should be the
one to decide the group's housing
fate.
No longer will the unlucky group
that draws 3,000 be rewarded with
the consolation prize of a trip to
Disneyland.
Sure there won't be any lines.
But there won't be any pageantry,
either. And most of all, there won't
be any stories. For the Draw,
though rich in injustice and replete
with disappointment, always
brought those funny anecdotes,
those tales of the thrill of the
Suites and the agony of Crothers.
There was campus prankster
Perry Friedman, who drew 0001 in
the Draw and then stunned the
campus a week later when he

admitted he had forged it.
There was the Adelfa draw
group that held hands, closed their
eyes and chanted "69, 69, 69,"
while one of their members
solemnly stepped forward and drew
. . . 2,869.
There was the "girl next door"
who drew a 12 but planned to live
in the Enchanted Broccoli Forest or
Terra or something like that.
And there were the people down
the hall who missed their next-to
last favorite residence by a single
point.
It was fair, and yet it wasn't fair.
The Draw seemed to symbolize all
that was arbitrary. The whole qual
ity of the following year seemed to
be riding on the card that one
groped for in the dark, hesitatingly
selected and removed with a mix
ture of excitement and dread.
Students would later agonize
that those same fingers that had
drawn a 2,930 had been just inches
away from a 17 or a 142 which
could have put them in the housing
of their choice. And then there
were those unfortunate souls
whose luck seemed to run out on
them year after year, the celebrated
"10,000 Club," who seemed every
May to be atoning for past sins.
There won't be any more Draw
themes. No more baseball games.
No more Hollywood. No more
annoying XTV reporters who asked
you what you were going to do with
your 4,502. "I'll tell you what to do
with it," one Manzanita-bound stu
dent had quipped.
And there won't be any more
crowds in front of dormitory televi
sions, watching with fascination,
amusement and envy the trials and
tribulations of people they didn't
even know.
The computerized draw will save
students a fair amount of time and
more than a little anxiety. It'll be
quick. It'll be efficient. It'll be easy.
But it won't be the same.
