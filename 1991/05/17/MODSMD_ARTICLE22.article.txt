## Kofi Bruce & Andrew Katz Stanford's gland denial 
### 
SLE MALES ARE NOT THE most
oppressed group on campus. The
most oppressed group is — we hesi
tate to say — glands.
GLANDS?!
Yes, glands.
Glands produce hormones — the
chemicals voted "least respected" by the
Stanford community. Stanford students
disregard glands' validity as motivation
for action and expect that they are above
these baser instincts.
Excuse us for asking, but when did
sexual attraction become an inappropri
ate reason for wanting to know someone?
Perhaps we should each have a pair of X
ray personality glasses — the kind that
enable you to see a total stranger and say,
"Check out the personality in that one!"
The normal reaction is to see a total
stranger, flare your nostrils like a rhino in
heat and, if you're a male, adjust the front
of your jeans (using one of the approved,
socially acceptable, discrete methods —
the pocket, the poke, the pelvic turn, the
hurdler and the pull up-out-and-down).
This is normally followed by "declara
tion of war, reconnaissance and assess
ment of potential damage." The normal
student, under favorable conditions,
would then enter SCAM MODE.
Stanford students, however, are not
normal. We follow an entirely different
process. (Luckily, K and A know why.)
Stanford is suffering from GLAND
DENIAL, a terrible disease that causes
inflammation and swelling of the
superego. It is characterized by the fol
lowing irrationale: If someone I have
never met before suddenly gives me flow

ers, it is because they are a superficial,
hormonal, debauched, depraved, sex
crazed, objectifying, incarnation of EVIL.
Unless they can discern my internal qual
ities from across the room, they have no
shot. I will only date people whom I know
and who know me.
So what do Stanford students do when
they want to date someone they don't
know?
• Step 1 — Planning the Chance
Encounter
This consists of the strategic place
ment of oneself in the path of the date
target so as to bring about a seemingly
coincidental meeting (e.g., "accidentally"
crashing into his or her bicycle in White
Plaza). A brief introduction and relevant
conversation follows, laying a foundation
for future meetings (e.g., an offer to pay
hospital bills).
• Step 2 — Finding a Pretext for the First
Invitation
This consists of using a minute detail
from a previous conversation as grounds
for an invitation to do some casual activ
ity together, (e.g., "You mentioned your
trailer has roaches, so I thought you
might want to go to the supermarket with
me to get some Raid.") The activity is fol
lowed by an affirmation that you had a
great time, regardless of how the time
was spent, (e.g., "Wow! 1 really had a
great time getting mail with you. Since I
normally check my box every day, maybe
we could meet here again sometime?")
• Step 3 — More Pretexts for More Invita
tions
Same as Step 2. The pretexts, however,
become more reasonable, and the activi-
SLE MALES ARE NOT THE most
