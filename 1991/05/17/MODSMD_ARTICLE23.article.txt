# Stimulate research; cut indirect-cost rate even more
## 
### 
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WE HAD
an excellent presentation and dis
cussion led by Dr. Leon Lederman,
Nobel Prize-winner in physics in 1989
and now president of the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Science.
Unfortunately, not many faculty mem
bers participated.
If they had, they would have learned
more about the basic problems underly
ing Stanford's dilemma. This discussion
might also have generated some thought
beyond that presented in the almost end
less memoranda from the administra
tion.
Lederman pointed out that research is
burdened by superfluous "middle admin

istration" which leads to inflated over
head charges, locally called "indirect
costs and staff benefits." I believe our
academic work is also overburdened by
unnecessary middle administrators.
Every couple of weeks, we read of the
appointment of another associate dean of
this or assistant provost of that. We need
to eliminate these albatrosses, and after
this is done: "They never will be missed;
yes, they never will be missed."
It has been pointed out by Lederman
and others that overhead charges are a
tax — imposed on the research efforts of
universities — and, as such, they stifle
these efforts significantly. This was par
ticularly true under the recent rules,

when every dollar spent on research at
Stanford was matched by almost $1
spent on overhead.
Because our charges are higher than
most, we have become less competitive in
the scramble for federal funding, which
has been noted by many faculty mem
bers. We need to lower our rates signifi
cantly in order to be more competitive
and thereby increase our total income.
Over several decades now, it has been
demonstrated that lowering the federal
capital gains tax stimulates the economy
so much that the total income to the gov
ernment from this source is much
greater than with a higher tax rate. We
are now being forced to decrease our

indirect-cost rate from about 75 percent
to about 55 percent.
I suggest a further reduction on our
part to 45 percent or 35 percent would
stimulate the research program here
greatly and after an initial readjustment
could well lead to more total income to
this university from this source.
If in the process we get rid of this load
of unnecessary middle administrators
with their secretarial staff, office space
and parking spaces, we may come out of
this whole experience better off than we
were before. Let's hope so.
