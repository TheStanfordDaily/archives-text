# Letter in Review demanded accompanying comment
## 
### 
Those who are reckless in
the use of epithets like "racist,"
"sexist" and "homophobic" are just
as off-base as those who engage in racist
and sexist slurs and innuendoes or those
who indulge in gay-bashing.
Mindless name-calling is uncalled for.
Having said that, I want to acknowledge
that a prudent use of homophobia and
its derivatives sometimes is warranted,
and I refer to a recent incident to illus
trate my opinions on this matter.
The May 6 issue of The Stanford
Review reprinted an open letter to Stan
ford's Board of Trustees by a 1984 grad
uate of the Graduate School of Business.
The letter is a classic example of the
loathing and disgust that some hetero
sexuals have towards those who engage
in same-sex behavior; the letter writer
claims he has lost all pride in his univer
sity because he is made uneasy by stat
ues honoring "sodomy" right around the
corner from Memorial Church. A ques
tion worth posing is why the paper
didn't take this occasion to speak up for

human decency, for honoring the
humanity of gays, lesbians and bisexuals,
as naturally as it would have for hetero
sexuals. It would have been so easy.
I can see the editorial now:
"On an adjoining page you'll notice a
letter from an irate alumnus who appar
ently is offended by the foursome that
many of us regard as a tasteful portrayal
of the intimate caring that people are
capable of, whatever their orientation.
We believe it's a great statement. Per
haps the discomforts experienced by this
alumnus can become an occasion for his
personal growth.
"After all, many of us have been
scarred by the prejudice in our culture to
the point that bigotry has taken up resi
dence in our minds. Even though it's
painful to change one's mind, isn't that
the price people have to pay as they grow
emotionally, ethically, spiritually? Pulling
out a stereotype can be disorienting in
the same way that entertaining a truly
new idea often is, but isn't it worth it?
What's education about, anyway?
"Mr. MBA '84 will never grow as long

as he continues to engage in self-induced
hysteria â€” he envisions a grief-stricken
family building a church dedicated to
God and morality, while in its very
shadow the forces of vice erect a monu
ment to glorify a repulsive lifestyle that
is quite properly condemned by Holy
Writ. A bit maudlin.
"The affection gays have for each
other is as innocent as the affection het
erosexuals have towards people of the
opposite sex; both lifestyles deserve to be
openly celebrated. Let's take pride in a
university that honors diversity."
By reprinting a letter that certainly
sounds homophobic without at least
some critical comment, The Review not
only missed an opportunity to speak out
for greater understanding on campus but
also gave the impression of condoning
the attitude of the letter writer.
As a liberal, I am often stimulated by
conservatives, but I'm unhappy when
conservative spokespersons seem to go
easy on homophobia. Isn't this the time
for moral leadership from conservatives?
I know printing unenlightened letters is

part of their job, but conservative editors
ought to make their own position clear
lest the reader assume bigotry is OK
with them; responsible opinion-makers
don't help spread the gospel of fear and
hate.
That's not a matter of political cor
rectness; that's a matter of simple
human decency. The temptation to resort
to censorship in order to protect minori
ties who have been subjected to unwar
ranted abuse will diminish as we all
learn the basic civilities of reasoned dis
course and genuine good will.
