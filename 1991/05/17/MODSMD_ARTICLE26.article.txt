ties look more like dates, (e.g., "I was
going to drive into San Francisco alone to
get dinner like I usually do. Then it
occurred to me that you had mentioned
you had not been to San Francisco in a
while. So I figured it would be cool if I
asked you to join me.")
• Step 4 — Dating and Hormone Denial
This consists of a formal admission of
attraction and a denial of the original hor
monal impetus, (e.g., "I think it was after
that third trip to the ATM machine that 1
started having feelings for you.")
• Step 5— Kissing as Consummation
Like we really need to explain, (e.g.,
The earth moves, the stars align in the
same quadrant of the night sky and your
sexual emotional being is satisfied. You
are overcome by the feeling that makes
wildebeasts rub up against trees.)
Our point is that ... we are all moti
vated by hormonal/sexual urges. Physical
attraction, while not a sufficient condi
tion for a relationship, is frequently a nec
essary one. Many relationships begin
with some sort of magnetic attraction
that provides the energy necessary to
bring the two individuals together.
Let's face it, if we all got back in touch
with our glands (that's sick), there would
be a lot more wonton sex in the streets.
This may not be such a bad thing — as
long as we put condoms on our chop
sticks.
