# Reges case 'not dead,' new legal ally asserts
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
A lawyer from a drug-policy foundation
offered yesterday to represent Stuart Reges
if he decides to sue the University to regain
his position and can find a local lawyer to
serve as co-counsel.
The lawyer, Ron Sinoway of Humboldt
County, said that although the University
would have a strong case, Reges "is not
dead in the water." Sinoway is a member of
the board of directors of the Drug Policy
Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based non
profit organization that has been searching
for a lawyer for Reges during the last two
weeks.
Reges has previously said he would con
sider suing the University but has not
announced definite plans. He could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Sinoway said Reges — who was fired a
week ago by School of Engineering Dean

James Gibbons — needs an additional
lawyer to handle day-to-day concerns.
Gibbons, in his letter of dismissal to
Reges, said the award-winning teacher was
fired for violating the University drug and
alcohol policy by carrying illegal drugs on
campus, buying alcoholic beverages for
underage students and refusing to promise
not to carry illegal drugs in his backpack in
the future.
He also said his decision was not influ
enced by Reges' advice to a student to
experiment with the amphetamine-derived
hallucinogen MDA.
But "this is clearly a First Amendment
issue," said Arnold Trebach, president of
the foundation. "We're determined not to
let Stanford get away with this."
Sinoway said Reges' situation is without
precedent and called it a "really excellent
example of the utter folly of current drug
