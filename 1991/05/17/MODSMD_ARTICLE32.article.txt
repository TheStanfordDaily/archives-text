# Overseas correspondent 'scared silly' by strange French customs

### Ken Wharton Overseas correspond 
It was my junior year, and I was begin
ning to suspect there was more to life
than Stanford. Scary though it was, I
began to feel the need to get away from

campus, to experience a new culture, to
meet completely different types of people.
I probably should have moved into
Rains.
But no, I opted instead for the escape
mechanism that so many unguaranteed
juniors had used before, and signed up for

a Stanford overseas program.
And so, saying goodbye to friends, fam
ily and cheap American beer, I hopped
onto one of those winged tubes of death,
and was immediately confined in a "seat"
with less legroom than a body cast. And
thanks to other luxuries, such as a Barry
Manilow channel on the audio-inflight
entertainment system, the flight seemed
to last only slightly longer than the 1988
presidential campaign. But at long last,
the plane touched down, and there I was
a new arrival on the not-so-virgin shores
of France.
One of the first things that struck me
was that the people here actually speak a
completely different language, and not
that heavily accented English that Peter
Sellers had led me to believe. But despite
the communication barrier, I slowly came
to realize that the French, like most
Europeans, detest the United States and
everything associated with it.
Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little
bit; I was only flipped off once in the first
24 hours, and have since learned to blend
in better by — for example — not singing
"God Bless America"in outdoor cafes.
I'm not sure why Europeans don't like
us, but I think it's probably envy. I mean,
when it's 85 degrees out, they see us
Americans comfortably wearing shorts
and T-shirts while they sit and swelter in
their "fashionable" multi-layered cloth
ing. I'd get pretty bitter too, unless I had
some sort of strange affinity for sweat.
Plus, they're probably jealous that in
America we're allowed to walk on the
grass. In French cities, the grass is just to
be looked at, mainly because they have an

average of four blades per city block. As
you might imagine, this poses several
problems, especially when you consider
the large number of dogs in this country.
They leave little steaming gifts on the
sidewalks, the streets and even inside
stores, which lie around until they are
either stepped on, or taken away by the
"Pooper Scooper Police."
This profession, which I swear I am
not making up, consists of cruising
around town on a cross between a scooter
and a Hoover Dustette, looking for little
land mines and sucking them off the
pavement. A definite career possibility for
all you history majors out there.
But I don't think envy explains it all. 1
think they consider themselves superior.
For example, they know that their
medieval architecture is much more
impressive than most American architec
ture of that period. They'll point out that
they have much fewsr drive-by shootings,
mainly because French cars are the size
and speed of automatic vacuum cleaners.
And above everything else, they are very
proud of their food.
And for good reason: They have end
less varieties of wine and cheese, tons of
delicious pastries and crepes and, of
course, mountains upon mountains of
federally subsidized French bread. Actu
ally, I think they go a little overboard on
this one. Sure, it's good and it's really
cheap, but do they have to use it for
everything? I mean, using it for hot dog
buns is bad enough, but it's gotten to the
point where it's more cost-effective than
firewood.
The French manage to make up for

this overabundance of bread, however, by
cleverly neglecting to have other essential
items, such as peanut butter, public water
fountains and 24-hour supermarkets. I'm
beginning to understand why this coun
try's government has traditionally been
less stable than Michael Jackson's nose;
hell, if they stopped putting doughnuts
out at Safeway, I'd revolt too.
But despite these minor problems,
Europe is a fun place to hang out, espe
cially if you're traveling around. It's hard
to go more than a few minutes in any
direction without running across a new
country with a new, incomprehensible
language and a new currency that looks
like it's straight out of a Parker Brothers
board game.
In fact, in the last month I've
exchanged money so often that it has
somehow managed to disappear without
my actually spending any of it. It was only
later that I realized that my hundreds of
Belgian guildenlira had approximately
the same purchasing power as an expired
20-cent Meow Mix coupon.
However, beginning in 1992, all these
tourist hassles will become a thing of the
past. That's right, sometime next year
most of Europe will undertake the brave,
bold and daring new policy of shooting all
Americans on sight.
But meanwhile, I'm having a great
time overseas, and recommend it highly
to anyone who thinks they could survive
without decent pizza. And by the way, it
might be a good idea to look into getting a
Canadian passport. After all, it's probably
cheaper than shipping your bullet-ridden
body home, eh?
