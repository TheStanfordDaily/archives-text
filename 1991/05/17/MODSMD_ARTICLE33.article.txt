## Bug concocts fantasy about small boy 
### John Ott Staff writer 
Those of you who have read this
piece o' poo more than once (yeah,
whatever) might have noticed a strik
ing propensity on my part to make
obscure allusions to the television cul
ture of the early '80s.
And I'm sure a large number of you
were momentarily dumbstruck by
this, unable to recall that it was thes
pian Donny Most who played the lov
able Ralph Malph on "Happy Days," or
that one could distill the storyline of
every single "Silver Spoons" episode
down to the statement, "It's kinda
crazy, but it just might work."
I well understand that so many an
uproarious, side-splitting gag went
uncomprehended and sadly unappreci
ated.
What would you prefer? Subtle,
urbane allusions to Nietzsche's
"Genealogy of Morals"? Parallels to
subtext in James Joyce's "Finnegan's
Wake"? Let's face it, I'm going to get
more chuckles citing Flo from "Alice"
("Kiss my grits!") and exploring the
pseudo-sexual ramifications of Mr.

Snuffleupagus' snuffle.
Why does Tony the Tiger — carniv
orous by nature — eat sugar-coated
cereal flakes instead of killing and
devouring the obnoxious preteens he
so readily befriends? When you watch
too much TY like I did, questions like
these make for many a sleepless night.
Well, let's hit the mailbag, shall we?
Dear Biig,
How old is Emmanuel Lewis? The
other day someone told me that he is
older than I am, and this confused me.
Is this right?

Whether this is correct or not
remains to be seen, but it certainly
isn't "right" that this hopelessly
syrupy sitcom lasted for five seasons
with the general approval of the Amer
ican people.
Lewis, for those of you who didn't
spend your pre-pubescent years slowly
murdering your brain cells in front of
the "boob tube," starred in the epic hit
"Webster."
Episodes generally centered around
a variation on the Webster-can 't-sleep
without-his-teddy-bear theme and
were not so much tear-jerkers as they
were bowel-movers or channel-chang
ers.
Had I been in control of the series, I
would have had a special two-hour
episode in which the young protago
nist ignores the "Mr. Yuk" stickers on
various aged bottles of noxious chemi
cals under the kitchen sink and drinks
heartily from a jug of glass cleaner
made radioactive by unchecked radon
emissions from the basement of his
otherwise idyllic suburban home.
His poisoned body transformed into
a miniature, albeit cute, nuclear reac
tor, Webster slowly and painfully

mutates into a gargantuan spider crea
ture — hence the name, Web-ster —
and when his parents return home
from a stroll in the park he takes them
by surprise and feasts on their juicy
bodies.
The bloodshed whets Webster's
appetite and he proceeds to embark on
a killing spree of an unprecedented
scale. With each killing he grows in
stature until he dwarfs most city build
ings. Soon he descends on Tokyo, or at
least a low-budget model of it, and does
battle with Godzilla and Mothra, the
giant silkworm.
But somehow I don't think that
would appeal to most Lewis fans.
At any rate, information on our
dimple-laden friend was sparse; all I
know is that he was 12 when the series
began in September 1983, which
means he is either 19 or 20 right now,
the age of the majority of the sopho
more class.
"Webster" can rent porno films.

The Biig wishes Anne Hoge would stop
getting into so many accidents. Send
