# Dating woes: FITS, SITS and TITS
## 
### 
It was just my luck. I was so excited
when I got the care package. I fig
ured it was the one from Mom, the
one I'd dreamed of for the last two
years. Never mind that the mailing date
was November 1989. Our post office has
enough problems trying to promptly
deliver mail through rain, snow, hail and
sleet, much less five years of continual
sunshine.
After running to Tresidder Union
during lunch time, I sat with a telling "I
got a package smirk" in the middle of
the white-and-red tables and began rip
ping the parcel open, with exaggerated
movements, while singing my own ren
dition of "Wind Beneath My Wings."
That was before I pulled an "Adam
and Eve" catalog from the parcel, and
an 8-inch string of gold-foil packaged
condoms unfolded and dropped to the
ground.
Everyone turned to stare as the sun
light caught the foil, and became silent
when I bumbled and dropped the sexual
paraphernalia catalog — causing it to
land open on the ground, revealing its
wares.
Eternal moments passed before I was
able to scoop up my jaw, the catalog and
the birth control from the ground and
start leaping, tossing the condoms to the
crowd. "New White Cheddar Condoms!"
I exclaimed. I figured no one would
think much of it after all the Smartfood
promotion.
Back in my room, I pulled out the let
ter that was enclosed with the parcel.
"Dear Ms. Hoge," it read, "Someone is
trying to tell you something very special
by sending you this. He even had to
know your last name ..."
Quickly, I reverted to my SAT "main
idea" skills, and breezed through the list
of lads who knew my last name. 1 ruled
out my dad and brother because they
would have addressed the parcel to
"Pumpkin" or "Farthead" Hoge, respec
tively. That only left my long-lost Love
Cakes. After 18 months, he was finally
trying to contact me. The SAT is such a
good measure of future college perfor
mance.
Entering into a blissful dream world,
I recalled my by-the-book Stanford rela
tionship. It was fall quarter of my fresh
man year when I met Muffin Man. Ours
was a relationship governed by the

guidelines known by my drawmates as
FIT, SIT and TIT (First, Second and
Third Impression Theories).
FIT states that, unlike in the "real
world," everyone here at Stanford
always seems to make incredible first
impressions.
It was night, and both of us were
about to leave Green Library. As we
started chatting and heading down the
stairs, I caught a glimpse of his back
pack. It was my favorite brand.
Everything was fine until the Green
door attendant locked the turnstile on
me. As I went to plow through it, 1
knocked myself back to the floor on my
rump. I had forgotten to show my back
pack.
While walking to our bikes we found
we had a lot in common. Turns out he
had almost sterilized himself once too!
We were even both compatible Type G
(Green) personalities. He called the next
day and asked me to Flicks — things
were moving so fast. Wow, I hoped that
didn't mean he was a scammer.
With the second meeting, we entered
into the realm of SIT, which states that
while most people make better impres
sions the second time, at Stanford, the
reverse seems to be true. After the per
son gets to know you on your date, you
usually never hear back from that indi
vidual.
As we met and went to sit down at
the movie, I wasn't too bothered by the
fact that he decided to bring 20 of his
closest women dorm friends. First dates
with a group are much easier. He was
the really strong, silent type; I'd never

had someone throw a ball of newspaper
so hard at me, and he didn't even talk to
me the whole time!
Leaving to bike home after the
movie, I was embarrassed when the
wheel on my bike wouldn't turn. He
spoke, explaining that if I removed my
Kryptonite lock from my wheel, friction
would be reduced, allowing it to turn.
He was the mechanical type, too! I wish
I'd studied physics harder in high school
so we'd have something to talk about. I
never knew physics was a social science.
The night ended as he bent down, the
moonlight catching his eyelashes as
they closed. I'd never had a high-five
that good.
It was only after the Flicks date that
SIT truly kicked in. My roommate
swore I hadn't gotten any messages
from him even after I threatened to
jump around and stir up all the asbestos
in the dorm. I even called his room and
left my phone number 46 times in case
he had lost it. It was incredible how
much his roommate sounded like him.
The Admissions Office always does an
amazing job matching freshmen.
I also tried hanging out at the post
office to see him when he came to check
his mail. He didn't come for a whole
week. If I had gone back to my dorm, I
would have figured out it was Christmas
break when I found no one there. My
parents said they kept calling and leav
ing messages on the recorder. Great, I
bet he tried to call when it was busy.
None of that mattered anymore. He
had tried to reach me through a package
from long ago.
Instantly, I woke out of my dream as
my draw mates shook me.
"We see you finally got that package
we sent you last year," they chuckled.
Once again, we laughed for having no
TITs. Though Third Impressionless, we
were happy. It seems often, when third
impressions are made here, people think
the only thing left for the couple to do is
decide whether or not to get married in
Memorial Church. No wonder everyone
sticks with Flicks.

Anne Hoge's name is derived from the
Latin "Ann," meaning graceful, and the
Greek "Hoge," meaning large sandwich
served at cheap graduation parties.
