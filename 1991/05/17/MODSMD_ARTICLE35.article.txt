"The modern woman's first job
is to be feminine and charming,"
said English Prof. Margery Bailey,
who was "acknowledged as one of
the most perceptive women on the
Stanford campus." The responsi
bility for this training, she said,
comes from family and instinct.
The second priority is that "she
be intelligent and this is the task
of the University." To this end,
Bailey believed that the 10:30 p.m.
bedtime required of coeds should
be abolished. "Women of college
age should have poise and individ
uality enough to manage their
everyday routine without an
administrative spank."
Hard to believe such a progres
sive person lived 60 years ago. I
just hope every female today has
received her "feminine and
charming" lessons already, or else
she'll be left behind.

No current freshmen would be
allowed to draw into on-campus
University residences for their
sophomore year, the Housing
Office announced today. This was
a result of the new policy to house
all incoming freshmen in dorms
next year for the first time, which
bumped the sophomores out.
Because of the large size of the
incoming class of 1957, it was also
decided that some freshmen
might be placed in Stern Hall for
the first time.
And you thought going unguar
anteed one year sucked? How
'bout your entire class living in
Oak Creek Apartments? But at
least those lucky freshmen got to
live in Stern their first year. Com
ing from one who shared the same
fate, it's an ineffable experience.
