couldn't give 100 percent," Birch
explained. But she decided to play
because her doctor, James Klint,
told Birch she couldn't harm her
self and because her father con
vinced her the worst thing that
might happen is that she would
lose.

Though Birch went out there,
she almost didn't make it through
to Tuesday. Coach Frank Brennan
described her as "very, very, very
close" to quitting on a number of
occasions. Birch recalls telling
Brennan: "Frank I'm so tired, I
can't go on."
Brennan wouldn't let her give
in."It was a like a recovering alco

holic," he said. "I told her, 'Don't
think of winning this match, don't
think about winning two more
matches. Think about winning
this game.'"
A few games later, a few
matches later, Birch was still win
ning — and feeling better. By the
time she squared off with Albano
yesterday she was still tired, but
much stronger than when the
tournament began.
Albano, meanwhile, was flying
high after her breakthrough win
over Stanford star Debbie Gra
ham Wednesday. But Albano was
not given much of a chance to beat
Birch. In eight previous meetings
between the two, Albano had
never come out the winner. Only
in the first of those matches did
Albano even extend Birch to three
sets.
Last night, Albano opened the
match by holding her serve on the
strength of three forehand win
ners. She then had a break point
against Birch in game two. But
Birch fought it off, subsequently
broke Albano and never looked
back.
With Albano serving at 3-1,
Birch used a beautiful drop shot
to break again and move up 4-1.
Neither player held again in the
set, which Birch won 6-3.
"Lisa kept me back pretty well,
so I couldn't attack as much as I
would've liked," Birch said. "After
she ripped three forehand win
ners down the line in the first
game, I went to her backhand."
The strategy worked well,
causing Albano's error-to-winner
ratio to take a major upturn.
Birch's often-lethal forehand may
not have been particularly devas
tating last night, but it was
enough to subdue Albano.
"She figures out how to beat
people, that's her greatest
strength," Albano said. "I've
played her so many times, I
expected her to do that."
Birch wasn't sure what to
expect. "I was very worried about

playing Lisa," Birch said. "She'd
been playing well all week." But
she was 0-8 against you, Sandra.
"That made me more nervous."
Not so much so that it affected
her play, however. Birch was her
usual error-free self, and Albano
couldn't ever gain any advantage.
"I think I could have come in on a
lot of points, but didn't," Albano
said. "I should've come into the
net more."
Realistically, Albano's greatest
failing was capitalizing on oppor
tunities throughout the match.
She had several break points she
failed to convert and couldn't
force the issue.
Serving the first point at 2-5 in
the second set, Albano was able to
run Birch all over the court and
sneak into the net. But Birch
eventually passed her to win the
best rally of the match. Soon,
Albano faced her first match point
and saved it with a volley winner.
Twice more she fought off
Birch at match point but on the
fourth one, Albano sent a lob over
the baseline and it was over. Birch

mate Mario Carruth, then was

After a stomach virus greatly weakened her during the team compe
tition, Sandra Birch bounced back to win six straight matches and
the NCAA singles title. Her 6-3, 6-2 win over Lisa Albano last night
allowed Birch to Join Stanford graduate Patty Fendick as the only
two-time winner in NCAA history.
