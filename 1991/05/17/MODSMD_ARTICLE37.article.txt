# Men's golf at final tune-up
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's golf team has a "presea
son" spanning from October to mid-May.
And then it begins the "real season" â€”
regionals and the NCAA Championships.
With that bit of introduction, the Cardinal
concludes its preseason today and tomorrow
with the Nike Northwest Golf Tournament,
played on the Oregon State home course in
Corvallis, Ore.
"It's going to be a bit hectic, but it will keep
us in good shape," Cardinal coach Wallv Good
win said. "We're going about the way to do it.
It's better to be competitive for two or three
weeks and then take a break than to play one
week and take the next week off."
The linksters are coming off a strong perfor
mance in the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships two weeks ago in which they immedi
ately clinched a berth in the Western Regionals
with a fourth-place showing behind the likes of
then second-ranked Arizona, top-ranked Ari
zona State and seventh-ranked USC.
However, none of those teams will be com
peting in Corvallis. The Cardinal's stiffest
competition figures to come from Washington
and Oregon, which tied for fifth at Pac-lOs, lag
ging far behind Stanford. Washington State,
Oregon State, Portland State, Boise State and
Idaho will round out the field.
"I don't imagine that we'll do too poorly,"
sophomore Mike Milliken said. "We're tired of
finishing second."
"We've beaten every team in this tourna
ment and we're hopeful of winning it," said
Goodwin. "It would be nice going into to
regionals with a win."
Freshman Notah Begay topped all Cardinal
golfers by shooting a 286 at the 72-hole Pac-10
Championships. His sixth-place finish puts
him in the No. 1 position for the Cardinal
today.
Christian Cevaer, a junior who finished far
back in the pack at Pac-lOs a week after taking
the Brigham Young Cougar Classic, fell to the
No. 2 slot. He will be followed by freshman
Casey Martin, who finished 14th at the Pac
lOs, sophomore Dave Rutkowski and Milliken.
Milliken is making his first appearance in
over three weeks after being sidelined with ten
dinitis in his knees.
"I feel good, but I'm a little inconsistent,"
said Milliken.
Sophomore Brad Lanning is playing as an
individual to determine whether he or Milliken
will be the Cardinal's No. 5 player at regionals.
The Nike Northwest will be the last tourna
ment in which the Cardinal will play 36 holes
on a given day. Today, the golfers will play the
ominous 36 followed by 18 on the final day,
Saturday.
"Thirty-six-hole days are usually our worst
rounds," said Cevaer. "The 36 holes will be
good preparation for regionals even though
there won't be any 36-hole days because there
is going to be a lot more pressure, psychically
and physically, and it's going to take a lot more
out of us."
