### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships may go down
as the tournament that would
not end. After the completion
of the individual singles final
last night, the rains which
wrought havoc on Monday
made an untimely return.
As a result, the doubles final
between UCLA's Stella Sam
pras and Kimberly Po and
Florida's Jillian Alexander and
Nicole Arendt was move to the
Sundown Tennis Club in San
Mateo.
There, with no spectators in
attendace, a thrilling three-set
ter was decided in the Lady
Gators' favor 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (10-
8). The victory capped the bril
liant career of Arendt, who like
Stanford's Sandra Birch was a
four-time All-American in sin
gles and doubles.
Earlier in the day, Po and
Sampras defeated Stanford's
Teri Whitlinger and Laxmi
Poruri 6-4, 6-3 in a semifinal

ing," she said. "I desparately
wanted to win here for my parents
and the home crowd. Hearing the
fans and my teammates cheering
for me was a great feeling."
Asked what she was going to do
to celebrate, Birch said, "I'm
going to get a large frozen yogurt,
kick back and watch L.A. Law."
Last night's victory closes a
major chapter in Birch's life. She
leaves Stanford with four team
titles, two individual singles titles
and four years' worth of All-
America honors in both singles
and doubles. She will graduate
this June with approximately a

match.
The list of Volvo Tennis Ail-
Americans was released yester
day and included five players
from Stanford. Birch, Debbie
Graham and Whitlinger were
recognized in singles and dou
bles. Heather Willens was hon
ored for singles while Laxmi
Poruri received the award for
doubles.
A total of nine players are
singles and doubles AU-Ameri
cans for 1991: Birch, Graham,
Whitlinger, Arendt, Po, Texas'
Susan Gilchrist, Indiana's
Stephanie Reece, Georgia's
Shannan McCarthy and Pep
perdine's Noelle Porter.
The criteria for All-America
selections in singles is: being
seeded in the top 16 at NCAAs,
reaching the round of 16 in the
tournament or finishing in the
top 20 of the final Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate rankings.
In doubles: being seeded
among the top eight, reaching
the doubles quarterfinals at
NCAAs or finishing in the top
20 of the final rankings.

3.8 grade point average and a
degree in economics.
Birch's next stop is the profes
sional tennis tour where she will
debut this summer at a satellite
event in Evansville, Ind. Her
ranking is quite low since she has
played few pro events, but Birch
said she plans on playing for at
least two to three years and seeing
how she does.
No matter what happens in the
real world, where Birch will be lit
tle more than an aspiring new
comer, she can rest easy knowing
that in the world of college tennis,
she won't soon be forgotten.
