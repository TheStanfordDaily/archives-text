# Stark ready to make his mark at NCAAs
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Thirteen months ago Jonathan Stark ruled the
college tennis world with his mighty scepter, the
Prince Pro.
Lord Stark had been a singles and doubles finalist
at the Volvo All-American Championships, possessed
a nearly perfect dual-match record, played at No. 1
singles and doubles for the two-time defending
national champion, and was named Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Year. As a freshman.
In his first season of collegiate tennis, Stark was
favored to crown his amazing year with NCAA sin
gles and doubles victories. The future was golden.
Then it occurred. Every athlete's living hell.
Injury.
But not the do-this-and-it-will-heal type. Worse.
Much worse. The wait-and-see-what-happens injury.
A stress fracture.
Stark waited. He sat out of competition the end of
April and beginning of May Skipped the Cardinal's
road trips. Paced the sidelines during home matches.
And returned just in time to play in the NCAA tour
nament, and help lead Stanford to a third-straight
title.
There would be no individual titles, though he
and partner Jared Palmer did make it as far as the
national doubles semifinals.
But what did it matter? Stark's left foot seemed
to be getting healthy. He'd take the summer off,
regain his impressive form and would smash his wu>
to collegiate tennib' top individual crowns — while
reclaiming his lordship — as a sophomore.
Stark's sophomore season almost didn't exist.
The happy-go-lucky competitor with the all-Ameri
can looks thought his gimpy foot was ready for
action in September. But the summer bumming
around in Medford, Ore. hadn't been enough. After
winning the All-American doubles title with Palmer
in October, he re-aggrevated the injury.
Back to the physical therapist. Maybe even the
operating room. And back to waiting.
"When I came back to school 1 was really ready to
play again," Stark said. "I thought I could just take
the summer off and be able to work back into it in
the fall.
"It was really frustrating. It just wouldn't heal. I
was really disappointed because I really enjoy play
ing every day and being with the team."
The Cardinal, and collegiate tennis aficionados,
were disappointed as well. Here Stark was, at the
pinnacle of the college game, and he couldn't play, he
couldn't compete, he couldn't contribute.
The best-tuned machine in the talented garage of
college tennis was losing its advantage. Stark wasn't
improving. He was even slipping.
"It's really hard to sit back and watch your bud
dies playing and getting better," said Stanford coach
Dick Gould. "[The injuryl cost Jon a year."
April 2 Stark was allowed to return to competi
tion. April 5 he was defeated at No. 3 singles by
UCLA's Fritz Bissell — No. 67 in the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate Rankings.
The woes continued. "It was really frustrating —
not because of where I was playing on the team, but
how I was playing and competing," Stark explained.
"UCLA was basically the first match I played in a
year, and I didn't play very well.
"It's hard when you stop playing at one level and
go down. I was getting upset on the court."
Good-bye hopes of an NCAA title in 1991?
For most players. But not Jon Stark.
Six weeks after Stark's return he has chalked up
a 12-1 dual match record, is ranked No. 3 in the
nation, and is being counted on to help lead the Car
dinal to a fourth consecutive title. He's also a

tavorite tor both the NCAA singles and doubles
crowns.
"Jon's a year behind where he could be but he's
very competitive and a great athlete," Gould said. "If
anyone can pick up to a very high level quickly it's
Jon.
"He's improved tremendously the past month.
Last April he simply overpowered everyone he
played and he's getting close to that level now. I
think he will continue improving through NCAAs 'til
the time he competes in the individual tournament,
and he should be a threat for the championship."
While his months in the grandstand were frus
trating at best, Stark does feel he picked up a few
additions. Not being able to run put the sophomore
in front of the ball machine for hours on end, where
he was able to work on grooving his hitting. Days in
the training room gave him a new understanding of
physical limits. And the time away from the baseline
gave Stark a new yearning to play.
"It was too much time off but it did make me
ready to play and work hard," said Stark. "It's nice
being hungry to play again.
"I'm real ready to play, which is very important,
especially going into NCAA's."
Stark may be excited to be back, but the Cardinal
is overjoyed. He is a key piece in the solution to the
NCAA championship puzzle.
He is a leader both on and off the court. Team
mates look to his performance for inspiration. And
he's always willing to give others help or advice.
"The guys look to him for leadership," said co
captain Dan Turbow. "His aggressive style is indica
tive of the team style — how he does rubs off on the
rest of the team. If Jon has a good day and plays
aggressive tennis it gives the team life."
His abilities are even more vital to Stanford's suc
cess in Athens, Ga. He and fellow super soph Palmer
are the best doubles team in the countrv. And while

teammate Alex O'Brien will be leading the Cardinal
to battle in the top singles spot, Stark is one of the
most talented players to compete for Stanford. Ever.
He is one of the most aggressive players on the
court today. He's the possessor of a 100-plus mile per
hour second serve. He has a very effective serve-and
volley game — the future of competitive tennis —
and an aggressive return.
"There's no question that Jon has had and will
have a tremendous impact on the history of Stanford
tennis," Gould said. "He is one of the tremendous
talents I have had the opportunity to coach in the
past 25 years."
But Stark's contributions don't end on the court.
Stanford is known for cultivating the well-rounded
individual, and Stark falls squarely into this cate
gory.
"Jon is a real good example of someone getting the
maximum out of Stanford — athletically, academi
cally and socially," Gould added. "He's not just stu
dent or athlete or partier — he's a nice blend of all
three.
"He's the kind of player a coach dreams of having
the opportunity of working with. He's just a tremen
dous representative of Stanford tennis, on and off
the court."
And in the most individual of junior sports, Stark
relishes the team aspect of Stanford tennis. With
memories of high school basketball still fresh, the
former two-sport star loves contributing to a team.
And winning with a team.
Out of all of Stark's personal accomplishments —
including a Wimbledon Juniors Doubles title — it is
Stanford's victory in Palm Desert, Calif, last May
which stands out.
"Winning NCAAs last year was one of the best
things in my life. I'm excited to be part of a winning
tradition."
With or without a crown.
