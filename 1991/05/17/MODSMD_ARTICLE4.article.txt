## Married professors share pursuits, endure compromises 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
For married faculty members within
the same department, a working rela
tionship can mean anything from pass
ing a slobbering dog back and forth dur
ing the day to digging around Greek
ruins together with an entourage of stu
dents.
As students who have pored through
Courses and Degrees looking for com
mon last names in departmental mast
heads can vouch for, many Stanford
departments feature a married couple.
The Departments of Anthropology,
English, Biological Sciences and Psy
chology are each endowed with two cou
ples.

Many of the couples met while
attending grnduate school und ex
changed wedding vows before arriving
at Stanford.
For instance, Mark Munn and his
wife, Mary Lou, met in Athens while
participating in archaeological research
sponsored by the American School of
Classical Studies and married in 1980.
The Munns now work together and
even share an office in the Classics
Department, where she is a lecturer and
he an assistant professor. In addition to
still performing archaeological research
together, they collaborate on scholarly
writings and offer guidance to students
as a team.
Mark Munn is effusive about the
arrangement. "An academic pursuit cap

tivates your whole being," he says.
"When you're doing something you love,
it is absolutely marvelous to have the
person you love carrying on the same
work."
As the only two archaeologists in the
Classics Department, they see their
complementary careers as a benefit to
both themselves and the department.
Mark Munn says they bring different
perspectives to the study of classical
archaeology, which "builds a depth" to
the department.
They also provide each other feed
back. "We can bounce ideas off each
other â€” and play the devil's advocate
with one another," explains Mary Lou
