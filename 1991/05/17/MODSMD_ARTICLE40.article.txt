# Cornell finds a home at Stanford and atop the lineup

### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Perhaps it was a sign.
Maybe Stanford designated hit
ter David Cornell knew something
that everyone else did not. It was
the spring of 1990 and Cornell did
not attend Stanford, but inside he
thought he should. Growing up in
Palo Alto, Cornell had spent his
whole life yearning to attend the
school that lay so close. Yet last
spring when he entered the Bud
Klein Varsity Clubhouse to use
the locker room mirror and put in
his contacts, he was more than an
unwelcomed visitor — he was the
enemy.
Cornell had a dream to go to
Stanford, but after his senior year
he got the thin envelope and
decided on Santa Clara instead. So
it was as a Bronco that Cornell
entered a sanctuary reserved
soley for Cardinal. An athletic
faux paux, yes, but Cornell just
did it. To him it felt right.
"You don't just walk into the
opposing team's clubhouse," said
the Menlo School product. "No
one is allowed in there, not family,
not friends, nobody. I just walked
up the steps. To me it showed I
belong here. It was a good omen."

For both parties. This weekend
Cornell will be facing his former
teammates as the Cardinal's lead
off hitter, a man now able to go in
and out of the locker room as he
pleases. Going into the season
ending two-game series with the
Broncos, Cornell is hitting .302
with 11 stolen bases and 36 runs
scored. He went from an almost
no-name walk-on, to a starter on
team for which he dreamt he
might once play. It is the great
athletic fairy tale, but Cornell is
just happy to be at Stanford. You
know this because he will never
stop telling you.
"I'm really glad I got in; I can't
stress that enough," Cornell said.
"I hate to keep harping on this,
but I just love it here. 1 think I
appreciate it more than a lot of
people who get in as freshman,
especially being a junior. It helps
when I get down because I just
remind myself that you can't do
much better (than Stanford), and
you can do a lot worse."
Spending his formative years
on the other side of El Camino
Real, Cornell wanted very much
to go to college on the Farm. He
hit .400 as a senior at Menlo and
was named all-league, but the
phone was not exactly ringing off

David Cornell wanted to go to Stanford coming out of Menlo School, but went to Santa Clara after being
turned down by Admissions. He transfered two years later, however, and has found a niche not only at
Stanford, but also as the baseball team's lead-off hitter.
