# Women's crew bouncing back
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
No matter how good a coach
is, the team is only as good as
every one of its members. Var
sity women's crew coach John
Davis couldn't be happier with
the efforts of his team this sea
son.
After a season of setbacks,
the women have pulled together
and turned up the volume, just
in time for the Pacific Coast
Rowing Championships this
weekend at Lake Natoma in
Sacramento.
"I asked them to give their
best in these last two weeks and
they have," Davis said. "They've
had tremendous practices,
they're excited and rested up
and ready to go."
The team lost an unusually
high number of athletes to
injury or illness this year but
finally things are looking up for
the Cardinal women. "They
could've thrown in the towel
weeks ago," Davis said.
"They're not going through the
motions though; they're out for
a medal."
The varsity women have a
shot at bringin&Jiome some
hardware. They are seeded fifth
behind UCLA, Washington, Cal
and UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal has traded wins with

UCSB this season and was
seven seconds behind Cal in
their last meeting three weeks
ago. Since then, however, Stan
ford has gotten much faster.
The novice eight-man crew is
ranked second and has been
doing well in practice as well.
The varsity four and second
novice eight events do not have
rankings but Davis has high
expectations for both. "They're
both medalist crews," he said.
This season, and the last two
weeks of energizing workouts,
have been particularly special to
Davis because he is retiring.
After 12 years with the program
and half a dozen top-five
national rankings, he is opting
to spend more time at home.
Wendy Davis, his wife and
Stanford's freshman/novice
women's coach of eight years,
will also be leaving the Farm.
"It's difficult to coach at
Stanford and raise a family.
This program needs a real cru
sader for the job, someone in a
different family situation," said
John Davis.
Stanford crew has become an
integral, and very special part of
Davis's life. "I don't know if I
can replace it,"he said. "I love
pushing people, helping them go
faster than they ever thought
they could."
"Crew is the absolute ulti

mate in teamwork," Davis said.
"When you get eight people
blending, working as one unit
it's exhilarating. Phenominal.
That's what these girls have
been doing for the last two
weeks. It's not a job now, it's
just a blast to go out and coach a
group like this."
Despite being a bit under
powered and unexperienced in
comparison with perennial pow
erhouses like California and
Washington, Davis feels the
team has a shot.
"We're doing our best row
ing, but there's a big gap to
close," he said. "It's one of those
things where I don't know if we
can and I don't know if we
can t.
The Stanford women seem to
be doing everything in their
power to cross the line first this
weekend. Davis has been work
ing one-on-one with the varsity
eight boat while Peter Morris,
an assistant coach, has been
solely handling the four-man
boat.
Davis explains his team's
performance like this: "They're
hitting homers now. Every day
for two weeks they've been hit
ting them over the fence. Maybe
Cal and UW are hitting them
out of the ballpark, but at least
we're not bunting and fouling
like we did all season."
