# Bloch ready for Pac-10 meet
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
For many athletes the more
they concentrate on their sports
the better they do. Not so for
senior middle-distance runner
Melanie Bloch.
"I think one of my problems
with running well in college is
that it is hard to run well when
running is the focus of my life,"
Bloch said.
She figured running would
have to be top priority at Stanford
for her to be able to race well while
hundreds of other things were
competing for her interest. The
increased focus on running
brought more pressure.
"I run better when, in the sum
mertime, I come home and I'm
really tired of working and being
around the people I work with and
I just need to get away and go for
a long hard run by myself," Bloch
said.
For her, track is an escape, a
way to relieve stress. It was like
that in high school.
"Running was an outlet for me.
I went to class. I had my friends.
But running was always a way to
blow off pressure and really cut
loose," Bloch said.
After high school, not only did
her focus change, but also the
quality of the field she was up
against.
"In high school you could have
a mediocre competition but still
win the race by leaps and bounds.
A mediocre performance in college
will pretty much give you a
terrible day," she said. "Unless
you have a good day, you'll have a
bad day."
Bloch hasn't had too many bad
days the past two years. She won
the Pacific 10 Conference 1,500
meters title last year in a career
best 4:24.2.
She hopes to defend her title
this weekend at Arizona State.
Her top opposition will probably
come from Arizona's Bridget
Smyth. The Wildcat senior is the
only runner in the conference to
break 4:20 this year.
The hot desert sun in Tempe
should be to Bloch's liking. She

prefers to train in hot and humid
weather. The conditions and com
petition make Pac-lOs a good
opportunity for her to run an
NCAA Championships-qualifying
time of 4:18 or better.
However, she is concentrating
on the win. "I'm trying to take it
one step at a time," Bloch said. If
she makes nationals she hopes to
become an All-American.
Bloch's not sure if she will com
pete after graduation. If she does

"it will be strictly as an aside, as a
complement to my life, as a way to
get out competitive energy I can't
get out somewhere else," she said.
She has set several long term
goals which may or may not
include racing.
"The ideal plan would be to
take off the next couple of years;
to run, to run well, to have a job
that pays the rent and come back
