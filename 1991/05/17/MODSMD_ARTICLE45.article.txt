them short, but growing up
around Stanford you realize it has
a lot to offer."
And not merely a winning base
ball team. The interesting thing
about David Cornell is that
though things have worked out
great for him on the field, he
would be just as happy as if they
had not.
"I decided that, if after getting
in here I found that I couldn't play
ball, it wouldn't crush me," said
Cornell. "I'm having a great time
at Stanford."
After the fall, the coaching staff
was pretty happy as well. Cornell
had gotten into school on his own,
and it was not until after the
acceptence letters went out that
the Stanford coaches knew they
had a new outfielder coming in.
What they got was a pleasant sur
prise.
"We knew he had played pretty

well against us, hut we weren't
expecting much," said Stanford
asst. coach David Esquer. "(But)
just when we were about to count
him out, each time he would come
out and show us something new.
When the fall ended, Cornell
did not think that he had done all
that well, but in his meeting with
coach Mark Marquess he was told
he would see playing time. With
Jeffrey Hammonds having knee
problems at the beginning of the
season, Cornell actually started
the first two games in center field.
But Hammonds came back and
in turn Cornell was transformed
into your basic utility man
("barely a screwdriver" as he puts
it), pinch running and going in
late in the game in defensive
moves. Yet there were problems at
lead-off, and after spring break
Cornell found himself firmly
entrenched as No. 1 in the lineup.
"It was basically his speed that
made you think he could be lead
off," said Esquer. "He and Jeffrey
are the two guys who we feel could

run on anybody. The ability to
send him on every play makes him
a real threat."
Lead-off hitters need to get on
base, and once they are there they
need to do something. Cornell's
speed makes him a threat on the
base paths, and he does a good job
getting himself there in the first
place. His on-base percentage of
.432 is second among Cardinal
starters, and he is not one to get
nervous around the plate.
"A lot of young hitters get
behind on the count and get tenta
tive," Esquer said. "With Dave
you get more aggression, lie
aggressively protects the plate and
usually fouls off a lot of pitches."
Cornell protects the plate
enough to be hit by pitches more
than most would care for, yet it is
only another way to get on base,
another way to do his job and help
the team for which he has wanted
to play for so long. David Cornell
will do what it takes because this
is where he belongs. He has
always known that.
