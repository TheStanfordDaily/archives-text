George "Mr. Sulu" Takei, taking a break from the
filming of "Star Trek VI," addressed a packed Kres
ge Auditorium Wednesday evening about the nega
tive portrayal of Asian-Americans in the media.
Takei's speech, coupled with addresses from
"Karate Kid II" actress Tamlyn Tomita and Univer
sity of Hawaii Law Professor Mari Matsuda, was part
of "Asian Images," presented by the Stanford Asian-
American community.
The program was a Stanford Centennial event
and coincides with Asian/Pacific Islander Heritage
Month.
"Star Trek's" Takei, who has an long list of the
atrical and film credits, particularly focused on the
media's portrayal of Asian-American women as
either "submissive and docile" or "sexy, wanton
whores."
Matsuda echoed Takei's comments and said
Asian-Americans are portrayed as "math nerds,

gangsters and submissive women." She also cited
advertisements for such things as mail-order brides
and "exotic Eastern lands where Asians will wait on
you hand and foot" as part of the problem.
"We've been slashed and bashed by the media,"
said Tomita. "We need to confront these issues and
point out that there are wonderful Asian actors."
Tomita's highly successful film career has taken a
frustrating turn lately. Her recent movie, "Come See
the Paradise," was pulled from theaters in January
because Twentieth Century Fox viewed the film as
"unpatriotic" in light of the Persian Gulf war. The
film focused on the difficulties of being a Japanese-
American during World War 11.
Takei said one of the solutions to the overall prob
lem was getting Asian-Americans into the theaters to
support positive Asian images.
On a lighter note at the end of the evening, Takei
give a hint to the content of December's release of
"Star Trek VI," saying that the Starship Enterprise
may have a new captain.
