## WEATHER ASSU to pay for sexual assault post 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate, compensating for the Univer
sity's inability to fund recommendations of the Sex
ual Assault Task Force, last night overwhelmingly
approved more than $45,000 for sexual assault pre
vention and education projects.
As a result of the action, a temporary coordinator
of sexual assault programs will be hired next year.
The rest of the money will be used for an Orientation
program for incoming students, an office for sexual
assault prevention and weekend self-defense work
shops.
Senate chair Solina Kwan noted for the record
that no senators voted against the bill. However, the
tally is still officially considered a divided voice vote
because there were several abstentions.
The funding — a total of $45,367 — will be taken
from the ASSU's annual and special discretionary
reserves.
The bill commits the ASSU to fund the programs
for one year, after which its sponsor, the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, expects the University to
continue them.
The coalition includes the Rape Education Pro
ject, Project HEAR (Heightened Education on
Acquaintance Rape), Greek Rap, members of the
Sexual Assault Task Force and other students and
administrators involved with sexual assault issues
on campus.
The University released the Sexual Assault Task
Force report Feb. 5 after a year-long study, but has
cited lack of funds as the reason some of the task
force recommendations — including the hiring of a
full-time coordinator — have not yet been imple
mented.
"We are really excited about the improved preven
tion and education efforts that will be made possible
by this vote," said senior Susan Epstein, a member
of the coalition and co-author of the proposals
funded by the bill.
"Now we can begin work on New Student Orien
tation," she added.
Council of Presidents member Jamie Green said
she was "inspired by the work of the coalition (and]
the bipartisan response of the senate." She added
