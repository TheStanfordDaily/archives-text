He estimated that the Univer
sity could face additional short
term health insurance costs of
$600,000 per year if provisions of
the bill were implemented. Long
term costs could run as high as
$2.4 million per year, he said.
"The bottom line on this issue
is that the line for inclusion (and)
exclusion from medical benefits at
Stanford was drawn where it was
for good and substantial reasons
and not out of discriminatory
intent or negligence," Enthoven
said.
"If you want to draw a new

the considerations that went into
this one, be able to afford and to

administer the new line and
explain and defend it to those
excluded, as well as to those previ
ously included who will have to
pay a higher price."
Supporters of the bill produced
documentation claiming Enth
oven's estimates of health costs
were too high. The annual cost
would be closer to $300,000,

O'Hanlan said.
But the real issue is principle
rather than cost, supporters said.
"Please tell us that you will
respect us and the life partners we
have chosen," O'Hanlan urged
the senators.
