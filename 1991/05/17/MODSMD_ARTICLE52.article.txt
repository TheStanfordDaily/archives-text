# U.S. soccer team here Sunday
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
For the second time in 15
months, the U.S. soccer team is
coming to Stanford Stadium.
But when they take the field
against Argentina's national
team Sunday at 1 p.m., the U.S.
team is hoping the site is the
only similarity.
Last February the Americans
lost a contest to the powerful

Soviet Union team, 3-1 at Stan
ford, but many things have
changed since then. For
starters, Bora Milutinovic
recently took over the reigns to
the team in an effort to get them
ready for the 1994 World Cup.
At that time the most
watched sporting event in the
world (over a billion people
watched the 1990 Cup final on
television) will be held in the
United States for the first time,

and the home team wants to be
prepared.
Milutinovic is the man who
turned around the Mexican
national team in time for the
1986 World Cup and led an
unhearalded Costa Rica squad
into the second round of the
1990 Cup.
The game is Sunday at 1 p.m.
and good seats will still be avail
able at the gate.
