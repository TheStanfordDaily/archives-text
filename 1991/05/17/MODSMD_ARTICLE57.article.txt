Munn.
"It's a nice thing to have a
ready source of reference," her
husband adds.
The couple leads Stanford stu
dents to Greece during the sum
mers for archeological research.
This summer, they will take a
group to an Athenian fortress to
begin excavation of several sites
they have discovered.
Mark Munn characterizes their
leadership role as being much like
a hydra — the, water serpent of
Greek mythology that regener
ates two heads for every head cut
off. He says the students benefit
immensely from having a "direc
tor with two heads, two personali
ties" providing both the male and
female perspective and offering
the students a wider range of
approaches to problems.
His wife adds that when "one
becomes weary, the other can take
over."
Mark Munn said the skills they
have mastered as a happily mar
ried couple benefit their academic
work. Although they sometimes
"exchange heated words" over
scholarly issues, they can always
return to the issue the next day
and discover the pluses and
minuses in each other's argu
ments, he adds. "Since we're liv
ing together, we can work things
out."
Unlike the Munns, Dr. Charles

Prober and Dr. Laura Bachrach
say they work "in separate
worlds" and thus rarely see each
other during the day.
The doctors, who came to
Stanford almost six years ago,
share a two-room office in the
Pediatrics Division of the Medical
Center.
Although the arrangement is a
little too close for comfort — he
must walk through her room to
get to the hallway — they have
taken the situation in good
humor. A cartoon hanging outside
their door reads "Working Rela
tionship."
For Bachrach, coming to Stan
ford with her spouse entailed
compromise. The University
offered her husband a position in
infectious diseases but could not
give her a post in her field,
endocrinology. She instead
accepted a position in adolescent
medicine until a opening appeared
in her field.
Although her current job
"couldn't be better," it is not per
manent. "It's been an uphill
battle to politic for a year-by-year
appointment," she explains.
Her husband agrees that work
ing in the same university is dis
advantageous in terms of career
advancement because Stanford
often overcompensates against
one of the spouses to avoid
charges of nepotism.
They say that working within
the same department gives them a
sense of the politics and frustra
tions that one another faces everv

day, but they rarely discuss their
actual work.
"I do not want to think about
the Medical Center when I'm at
home," her husband confirms.
Some couples do take their
work home with them, however. A
day spent together in the English

Department gives Prof. Thomas
Moser and his wife Joyce, a lec
turer, a plethora of conversation
topics for after-school hours.
They discuss issues of the depart
ment, how their classes are going,
students they have in common
and how to arrange all of their

books neatly.
Joyce Moser describes being in
the English Department with her
husband as "lovely" and "terribly
nice." They check in with each
other at least once a day, some
times "just to pass the dog back
and forth."


Al Green — Dally
Married since 1980, Mary Lou and Mark Munn work together and share an office in the Classics Depart
ment. "When you're doing something you love, it is absolutely marvelous to have the person you love
carrying on the same work," Mark says.
