# 'Froshbook' for upperclassmen to debut this fall
## 
### Monica Carpio Staff writer 
Students who find themselves in embar
rassing situations because they can't pair
names with the faces of people they've met
may be helped by a new student-run publi
cation.
Called "Faces in the Crowd," the publi
cation will be released this fall and will be
modeled after the Froshbook, an annual
University publication that contains pic
tures of incoming freshmen.
"Faces in the Crowd," as conceived by
junior Kevin Hartz, will include pictures of
upperclassmen as well as their names,
hometown addresses and majors. This
year's freshmen, sophomores and juniors
will appear in the first issue. He plans to
sell single copies for $8 each.

Hartz said he got the idea from friends
who organized a similar publication at
Dartmouth College, "where it has become a
success." In addition to helping students
look up old friends, he said, the book could
be useful for alumni, faculty members, job
recruiters, coaches and others who need to
identify students quickly.
"It will have a good shelf-life since it will
include permanent home addresses, and it
can be useful even after graduation," said
Hartz. He added that the project has
already received positive responses from
potential advertisers.
The ASSU voted May 2 to endorse the
project, which is self-funding. Hartz said he
wanted to ask the Registrar's Office for
directory information, but University pol
icy prohibits the use of database informa
tion for profit.

Acting Registrar Jack Farrell said his
office "only gives access to public directory
information to offices with legitimate edu
cational needs." He said the stringent rules
are designed to protect student privacy.
Hartz said he will instead be buying the
information from a private firm.
These organizations scan public infor
mation, such as the student directory, and
then put the information on a database and
sell it, Farrell said.
The book will use photos from the
Froshbook unless students send in a more
recent photo, because the cost of setting up
photo sessions would require much more
time and money. Hartz said Froshbook pic
tures will be rephotographed at about 95
percent of their original quality.
Besides the student pictures, the face
book will include three or four campus

event pictures. One will be a photo of the
ASSU Senate.
The book will be divided by class and will
include a first-name directory, school phone
numbers and school calendars.
Hartz, who will be the editor of the pub
lication, plans to have it ready by the begin
ning of fall quarter.
Order-form post cards will be sent to all
upperclassmen before the end of this quar
ter. The post cards will also give students
the option of sending in a different picture
from that of the Froshbook or of not
appearing in the book at all.
Hartz said that at Dartmouth, 40 per
cent of students sent in new pictures and
three out of four students bought the book.
The facebook will only be sold to mem
bers of the Stanford community, Hartz
said.
