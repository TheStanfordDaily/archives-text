# Still Cramming After All These Years

done and really want to do," says
political science major Andrea
Torres.
Echoing the sentiments of
many of her classmates, Torres
adds, "the quarter is going too
fast."
Some seniors are finishing up
their academic requirements,
turning in final drafts of honors
theses. Others are stuck with one
chapter to go. Still others are just
intent on passing their last exams
or fulfilling their distribution
requirements so they can gradu
ate on time.
Some are attending planning
meetings with their lenders and
have nightmares about how
they'll need to sell blood to get out
of debt.
Some are trying to find jobs in
the shrinking "want ads," and
also housing for the future.
Seniors are writing their last
words, giving their last speeches

or singing their last notes at Stan
ford.
Many graduating seniors are
"stressing out," trying to do as
much as they can in the short
time that's left — things like tak
ing trips to Napa Valley, spending
nights in the City, cheering at
Stanford baseball or tennis
games, attending speeches, writ
ing for The Daily or taking classes
that are not related to their
majors.
They want to cram as much of
the Stanford experience as they
can into the remaining month —
going through new experiences or
reliving past thrills.
"I feel pressured to do things I
didn't do (earlier)," admits Ken
White, a political science m^jor.
This is also the last month they
will all be living, sleeping and eat
ing together.
Some fear the cherished night

Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Time is running out for Stan
ford's Centennial graduates.
A little less than a month from
now, a mere 20-something days,
the 100 th graduating class will
leave the Farm, scattering across
the globe.
Some will go to Hong Kong,
some to Africa, some to Hoboken,
some to Palo Alto.
They'll become the next gener
ation of lawyers and teachers, doc
tors and artists, engineers and
politicians.
In between decisions about the
future, though, most of this year's
seniors are trying to make the
most of their last days at Stan
ford, fighting a losing battle
against time.
"There's only one month left
and many things that I haven't

As zero hour approaches, theses, friends, sentimentality

their different outlooks and back
grounds will not survive the real
world. Electrical engineers and
philosophy majors will go their
different ways, possibly not meet

reunion.

A last-ditch effort

good times before

These extraordinary people
who have grown very close over
their years in common must now
say goodbye to boyfriends, girl
friends and just plain friends.
Recent events, such as the
Senior Casino Night, the Senior
Formal, Senior Disorientation and
the pub nights, where soon-to-be
graduates met people they hadn't
seen in years have fanned the
flames of nostalgia.
"It's stressful to leave friends
behind," says Torres.
Many seniors have been
exchanging phone numbers and
addresses, but they won't be talk
ing on the phone for hours at a
time anymore. They won't be able
to walk down the hall and talk to
their friends.
"I hope they won't disappear
completely," says Lisa Garbin, an
English major.
Millie Gong, an RAin Okada,
feels that she won't be in contact
with a lot of her friends, "but it's
a chance for us to grow."
Whether they are going to med
ical school, graduate school or
work, most agree their goofing-off
days are over and they are enter
ing a new phase of their lives.
Many graduating seniors inter
viewed say the recession and the
rapidly shrinking job market are
factors as they decide whether to
go out "in the real world" or con
tinue their studies.
While some students com
mented that they are trying to

"avoid reality," most are glad to
move out of the "Stanford
cocoon," even though this can be
"terrifying" according to Chris
tine Beckman, a psychology and
organizational behavior major.
"I need a change of scenery,"
explains Brenna Moorhead, a lin
guistics major.
"I'll miss knowing the campus
and the people here," adds Torres,
who will attend graduate school at
the University of Texas at Austin
in the fall. "I'll have to deal with a
new community."
John Keller, a senior in biology
who graduated last quarter, says
he believes "it's bad that Stanford
is so sheltered."
Some seniors say they believe
that the impending departure
from Stanford in June influenced
their social lives this year.
"You hesitate to get into a rela
tionship that threatens to be seri
ous. You hesitate to make (new)
friends," says White.
While the seniors typically
don't remember what they
expected Stanford to be like, they
seem generally satisfied by their
experience here.
"I've had a fantastic four
years," says White.
There's no consensus as to
what seniors have achieved here.
Some believe they've learned to
learn, and others hope they have
learned to question conventional
wisdom. Some think they have
received a validation that will get
them better shots at jobs.
Seniors say they value their
diploma for more than the face
value academic accomplishment it
represents. They speak of the
four years of memories it incar
nates.
This last month under the
Farm's palm trees is for many
seniors a time of reckoning, an
opportunity to look back at the
past four years, feel "mellow" and
wonder where all that time went.
It's a last-ditch attempt to recap
ture some of those good times
before taking the next step that
will inevitably catapult the gradu
ates away from each other.
A month from now the future
of the Senior Class will catch up
with it, but right now they can
glance back and enjoy their
achievements.

Rebirth
Vulnerable once again, graduates leave Stanford to attend law school or to work with Mother Teresa.
Leaving the Farm is easy if you have a better place to go.
