## Seniors from India to El Salvador chart their paths

stayed back in India. This was perhaps the
biggest thrill of my Stanford career," he
said.
Bhadury, an economics and electrical
engineering mayor, eventually plans to go
back to India to operate a consulting
agency.

As graduation approaches, many inter
national seniors are planning futures with
the same adventurous spirit that brought
them hundreds (and more often, thou
sands) of miles to Stanford. Others have
decided to settle down and continue at
American universities. Here are a few of
their stories — past, present and future.
• Enrique Orrigi from El Salvador and
Odile Meister from France are going to be
on a plane to Calcutta, India, where they
will work with Mother Teresa's support
teams for the city's homeless for six
months.
"Stanford has been the most powerful
inspiration in changing my initial pre-pro
fessional attitude to a more public service
oriented one," says Orrigi.
Meister credits Stanford's Catholic com
munity for his inspiration to travel to Cal
cutta. The internships are offered under
the auspices of the Stanford Catholic Fel
lowship.
"It is here I have learned of my duty
towards the materially, spiritually and emo
tionally deprived," he said.
Reflecting on his time at Stanford,
Orrigi said there have been ups and downs.
"It took me a little time to adjust here. In El
Salvador, if you call a grown-up woman a
girl, no one minds. Here you are scorned
upon. Besides, people tend to be a little
rational and cold here."
Orrigi plans to work for the Salvadoran
government. He said his last month at
Stanford will be spent fund-raising to sup
port international public service.
• Last summer, Rana Bhadury, a stu
dent from Calcutta, India, worked on Wall
Street with a consulting company. In July
he will start working for a private consult
ing company in San Francisco. For him,
Stanford has been a pre-professional's
dream come true.
"I'm from a fairly middle family in India
and so working in the world's financial cap
ital would have been impossible had I

'Stanford has been the most
powerful inspiration in
changing my initial pre-pro
fessional attitude to a more
public service oriented one.'

But Bhadury's business skills were not
the only things he said were developed dur
ing his time at Stanford. He divided his
economics classes between pre-business
ones and economic development ones.
"I was really taken up by Stanford's
massive range of courses on the Third
World," he said.
Bhadury was accepted at Harvard and
Yale universities for Ph.D. programs in eco
nomic development but has deferred admis
sion for some time.
• "Every time I go back home, I feel
increasingly Amercanized," says Safari
Watanabe, from Yokohama, Japan.
She said her parents sent her to an
American school "mainly because they
wanted my education to be different from
that of an average Japanese girl." She said
her parents are "very liberal" by Japanese
standards.
"I have been taxed to limits that no
Japanese university could ever tax me," she
said.
Watanabe said adjusting to Japanese
society after Stanford will be difficult.
"America is so much more accepting and
offers a lot more freedom, as people encour
age you to think and learn, rather than
accept ideas as they are," she said.
Watanabe has applied to several Califor
nia law schools and is awaiting replies.

stayed back in India. This was perhaps the
biggest thrill of my Stanford career," he
said.
Bhadury, an economics and electrical
engineering mayor, eventually plans to go
back to India to operate a consulting
agency.

As graduation approaches, many inter
national seniors are planning futures with
the same adventurous spirit that brought
them hundreds (and more often, thou
sands) of miles to Stanford. Others have
decided to settle down and continue at
American universities. Here are a few of
their stories — past, present and future.
• Enrique Orrigi from El Salvador and
Odile Meister from France are going to be
on a plane to Calcutta, India, where they
will work with Mother Teresa's support
teams for the city's homeless for six
months.
"Stanford has been the most powerful
inspiration in changing my initial pre-pro
fessional attitude to a more public service
oriented one," says Orrigi.
Meister credits Stanford's Catholic com
munity for his inspiration to travel to Cal
cutta. The internships are offered under
the auspices of the Stanford Catholic Fel
lowship.
"It is here I have learned of my duty
towards the materially, spiritually and emo
tionally deprived," he said.
Reflecting on his time at Stanford,
Orrigi said there have been ups and downs.
"It took me a little time to adjust here. In El
Salvador, if you call a grown-up woman a
girl, no one minds. Here you are scorned
upon. Besides, people tend to be a little
rational and cold here."
Orrigi plans to work for the Salvadoran
government. He said his last month at
Stanford will be spent fund-raising to sup
port international public service.
• Last summer, Rana Bhadury, a stu
dent from Calcutta, India, worked on Wall
Street with a consulting company. In July
he will start working for a private consult
ing company in San Francisco. For him,
Stanford has been a pre-professional's
dream come true.
"I'm from a fairly middle family in India
and so working in the world's financial cap
ital would have been impossible had I

'Stanford has been the most
powerful inspiration in
changing my initial pre-pro
fessional attitude to a more
public service oriented one.'

But Bhadury's business skills were not
the only things he said were developed dur
ing his time at Stanford. He divided his
economics classes between pre-business
ones and economic development ones.
"I was really taken up by Stanford's
massive range of courses on the Third
World," he said.
Bhadury was accepted at Harvard and
Yale universities for Ph.D. programs in eco
nomic development but has deferred admis
sion for some time.
• "Every time I go back home, I feel
increasingly Amercanized," says Safari
Watanabe, from Yokohama, Japan.
She said her parents sent her to an
American school "mainly because they
wanted my education to be different from
that of an average Japanese girl." She said
her parents are "very liberal" by Japanese
standards.
"I have been taxed to limits that no
Japanese university could ever tax me," she
said.
Watanabe said adjusting to Japanese
society after Stanford will be difficult.
"America is so much more accepting and
offers a lot more freedom, as people encour
age you to think and learn, rather than
accept ideas as they are," she said.
Watanabe has applied to several Califor
nia law schools and is awaiting replies.
