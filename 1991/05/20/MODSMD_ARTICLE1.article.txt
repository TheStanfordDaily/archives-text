A couple of years ago, Bill Kambeitz, of
Sunnyvale, could barely swim. But this Sat
urday, he made a big splash at deGuerre,
where he took first place in a medley race
during the 15th Annual Stanford Special
Olympics Swim Meet.
"It felt great. Two weeks of practice really
helped me," Kambeitz said after the race.
His mother Terry added, "He's come a
long way. Special Olympics is really great for
the kids."

Despite overcast skies and the threat of
rain, almost 200 athletes — 7-year-old chil
dren to adults in their fifties — competed in
the meet. Most of the athletes have Down's
syndrome, and several others suffer from
diseases such as cerebral palsy and muscular
dystrophy.
Many of the athletes belong to groups
such as high school teams and swim clubs
for the mentally retarded. Fifty athletes
competed independently, according to event
co-coordinator Dana Meinke, a senior.
Athletes participated in different events

according to their ability, ranging from an
intense 100-meter individual medley in
which the competitor swam four different
strokes — the freestyle, butterfly, back
stroke and breaststroke — to a 15-meter
kickboard race.
The swim meet is only one part of a year
long program sponsored by the Santa Clara
County Special Olympics, which organizes
track and field meets as well as soccer, volley
ball, basketball and gymnastics events for
