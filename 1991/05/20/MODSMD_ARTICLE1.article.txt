# Special athletes make Olympic splash

### Jenny Wash 
A couple of years ago, Bill Kambeitz, of
Sunnyvale, could barely swim. But this Sat
urday, he made a big splash at deGuerre,
where he took first place in a medley race
during the 15th Annual Stanford Special
Olympics Swim Meet.
"It felt great. Two weeks of practice really
helped me," Kambeitz said after the race.
His mother Terry added, "He's come a
long way. Special Olympics is really great for
the kids."

Despite overcast skies and the threat of
rain, almost 200 athletes — 7-year-old chil
dren to adults in their fifties — competed in
the meet. Most of the athletes have Down's
syndrome, and several others suffer from
diseases such as cerebral palsy and muscular
dystrophy.
Many of the athletes belong to groups
such as high school teams and swim clubs
for the mentally retarded. Fifty athletes
competed independently, according to event
co-coordinator Dana Meinke, a senior.
Athletes participated in different events

according to their ability, ranging from an
intense 100-meter individual medley in
which the competitor swam four different
strokes — the freestyle, butterfly, back
stroke and breaststroke — to a 15-meter
kickboard race.
The swim meet is only one part of a year
long program sponsored by the Santa Clara
County Special Olympics, which organizes
track and field meets as well as soccer, volley
ball, basketball and gymnastics events for

the disabled.
The Stanford meet is unique
because it provides "a chance for
the athletes to come onto a cam
pus and meet college students,"
said senior Andrew Reisner, the
event's other co-coordinator.
The athletes themselves were
very enthusiastic and excited.
"I feel great," said Anthony
Scottese, while waiting for his
award. Scottese took third in the
25-meter freestyle. "Now I can go
take a shower and get warm."
About 200 volunteers played a
large role in the event, helping
athletes in the water, keeping
records, distributing awards,
serving lunches or acting as "bud
dies" for the athletes. Buddies

were paired off with an athlete
and provided them with assis
tance and companionship
throughout the day.
"The buddy system is a large
part of the Special Olympics,"
Reisner said. Not only does it give
the athletes the opportunity to
make friends and share their
"energy and warmth," he added,
but it gives volunteers a perspec
tive they do not usually have.
"Every single volunteer comes
away looking differently at the
people they know," said Reisner.
"It's going to change how you
look at all people. It makes you
question your values and assump
tions."
Many volunteers were very
enthusiastic about their experi
ence as a buddy.
"I really gained an apprecia
tion for what it must be like to be

a parent of one of these children,"
said freshman Allison McClain.
"They need so much attention
and encouragement."
Volunteer Roopal Mehta, also a
freshman, said, "It's amazing.
These are people in wheelchairs
who can't even walk, and they're
swimming the backstroke."
Festively decorated with color
ful balloons and banners,
deGuerre was a bustle of activity
all day long. Volunteers and ath
letes registered as early as 7 a.m.,
and the event officially got under
way at 8:45 a.m. with the opening
ceremony.
The ceremony included
speeches by several Special
Olympians and Stanford swim
mer Jeff Rouse. The races began
at 9:30 a.m. and continued into
the afternoon.
Entertainment was provided

on the fields next to deGuerre
throughout the day. The a capella
group Everyday People and the
Stanford Band were among the
groups that appeared.
Stanford students become
involved in the Special Olympics
for "a lot of different reasons,"
Reisner said. Some have family
members who are disabled and
have been involved in a Special
Olympics event. Other students
feel that the experience makes
them "grateful for what they
have."
"I think it's a really important
societal statement," he said. Spe
cial Olympics helps the disabled
build "self-confidence and inde
pendance."
"Society is making an effort [to
say] it's not going to let this seg
ment fall by the wayside," Reis
ner said.
