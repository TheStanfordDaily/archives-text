# Kuwait sentences six Iraqi collaborators

### 
KUWAIT CITY (AP) - Kuwait's martial-law
courts began trials yesterday of accused collabora
tors with the Iraqis, sending six people to jail, includ
ing an Iraqi whose only known crime was wearing a
Saddam Hussein T-shirt.
Defense attorneys, many of them appointed on
the spot, complained that the process was unfair
because much of the evidence against the defendants
was not made public. They also charged that confes
sions had been extracted under torture.
Three civilian and two military judges presided.
The defendants were kept in a metal cage on one side
of the courtroom.
More serious cases that could result in the death
penalty were not scheduled to start until Tuesday.
Lawyers said more than 300 people, mostly foreign
ers, will eventually be brought to trial.
They are charged with aiding the Iraqis during
their seven-month occupation that began with the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, prompting the Gulf war,
and ended in late February when allied forces liber
ated the emirate.
In addition to the five Iraqis and one Jordanian
convicted yesterday, three Palestinians and an Egyp
tian were acquitted and the cases of 12 others were
postponed.
Adnan Ali, an Iraqi, was convicted of wearing a
Saddam Hussein T-shirt the day allied forces drove
Iraqi troops from Kuwait. He told the tribunal the
shirt was given to him at the Iraqi school he attended
before the invasion and that he only wore it around
the house.
Ali's attorney complained that a sentence of 15
years was too severe for such an offense. He said the
case underscored the amount of evidence and
charges the judges were keeping to themselves â€”
suggesting his client might be accused of other
undisclosed offenses.
Ten of the defendants did not appear. Defense
lawyers said some out on bail evidently were afraid
to come. One defendant said two others accused with
him were still in the hospital being treated for
injuries inflicted in torture sessions.
Those convicted will be deported after serving
their jail time.
Though the trials attracted little public interest,
some observers have suggested they are a way for
Kuwait to clear its human-rights reputation, which
has been blackened by repeated allegations of tor
ture of suspected collaborators in custody.
In opening remarks, presiding Judge Mohammed

Ben Naji defended the trials. "This court, headed by
non-partisan and fully independent judges, is the
fundamental guarantee for fair trials," he said.
Under martial law declared after the Gulf war,
there is no higher court of appeal. But Crown Prince
Saad Al-Sabah, the martial law governor, must
review all sentences.
Iraqi brothers Thia and Abbas Sabti Jumaa were
sentenced to 12 years for helping the Iraqis and for
theft. Thia was also fined about $600 for possessing
Iraqi bullets.
Iraqi Sabah Shamki was given a 13 year jail sen
tence for helping the Iraqi forces and possessing

firearms. Shamki told the judges that much of his
confession was given under torture.
Two men were sentenced in absentia. Ahmed
Mir'i, an Iraqi, was given a 3 1/2-year sentence and a
fine of $120 for collaborating and possessing ammu
nition. Jihad Daoud, a Jordanian, was ordered jailed
for five years.
Among those acquitted was an Egyptian,
Mohammed Azouz, who had been charged with col
laboration for allowing a group of Iraqi shoe mer
chants to stay in his house overnight after they ate
in the restaurant where he worked and told him they
could not find an empty hotel room.
