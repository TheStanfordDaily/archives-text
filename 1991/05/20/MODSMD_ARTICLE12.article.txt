KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) — Eleven years
after the bloodiest civil revolt in modern Korean his
tory, the citizens of Kwangju still have anger to vent.
A total of about 80,000 people staged anti-govern
ment, anti-U.S. protests over the weekend, marking
the anniversary of the 1980 uprising. As many as
20,000 others battled riot police in hand-to-hand
combat in some of the worst fighting in three weeks
of nationwide protests.
Kwangju, a city of 800,000 people about 160 miles
south of Seoul, long has been a hotbed of opposition
politics.
On May 18, 1980, Kwangju residents armed with
rifles, machine guns and dynamite seized contol of
the city, driving out police forces. Crack South Kore
an paratroopers, supported by tanks, retook the city
10 days later after fierce street battles. About 200
people were killed and 1,800 others wounded by offi
cial count.
Many Kwangju citizens feel betrayed by the Unit
ed States, which they believe condoned the South
Korean military crackdown.
Terms of a South Korea-U.S. defense pact give the
ranking U.S. commander authority over the majori
ty of 650,000 Korean forces, and many in Kwangju
claim such command made U.S. officials aware of the
10-dav crackdown.
