Women netters make
winning national title
look easier than it is

IT WOULD BE EASY TO write
off the remarkable achieve
ments of the Stanford women's
tennis team.
Because they win the NCAA
Championship year after year, the
Cardinal women make it look easy.
But even the most jaded, spoiled
fan couldn't help but get caught up
in the emotion of the past week.
More eyes than had ever
watched a match at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium were fixed on
Court 7 a week ago Sunday after
noon as junior Kylie Johnson bat
tled UCLA's Cammie Foley.
If Johnson could pull it off,
Stanford would win its sixth
straight national title and its third
in a row without the need of victo
ries in doubles.
Johnson's teammates sat with
rapt attention, cheering every
point and screaming words of
encouragement.
Sure enough, Johnson came
through, and the Cardinal — the
first host school ever to win the
NCAA title — celebrated as if they
had never won the NCAA title
before.
For Stanford, this year was not
like the past two, when everything
came so easily.
The Cardinal was embarrassed
by Florida back on March 3, suffer
ing the first shutout in team his
tory.
That defeat snapped an unbe
lievable 76-match winning streak
dating back to April 15, 1988.
But instead of blaming one
another and becoming divided, the
team pulled together in a most
unusual way.
Although college tennis is a

team sport, it still consists primar
ily of individuals taking the court
and doing their own thing.
To win this time, however, the
Cardinal women knew they would
have to want it for each other.
When the NCAA finals rolled
around, Johnson wanted to win for
herself and Debbie Graham.
Heather Willens wanted it for
Laxmi Poruri.
Teri Whitlinger wanted it for
Emma Woodhouse. And so on
down the line.
Coach Frank Brennan and assis
tant Lele Forood, the brain trust
that keeps the dynasty going year
after year, prepared the players to
perfection.
The one thing they couldn't plan
for was that Sandra Birch would
contract a stomach virus and miss
half the team competition.
The morning individual singles
was set to begin, however, a rain
storm delayed the start of play and
allowed Birch critical extra time to
prepare.
As the matches continued
through Monday and Tuesday,
Birch grew stronger and marched
through the draw.
Last Thursday, Birch again
thrilled the home crowd by crush
ing California's Lisa Albano and
winning the NCAA singles title.
It was her second such crown —
she won the first one in 1989 —
and made Birch just the second
player to win the event twice. Stan
ford's Patty Fendick did it first in
1986 and 1987.
Yes, they do win it every year.
But that shouldn't diminish one's
appreciation for what was truly a
marvelous feat.
To seniors Birch and Whitlinger:
a fond farewell to two of the great
est collegiate tennis players of all
time.
To Brennan and the returnees:
best of luck on winning number
seven next season.
