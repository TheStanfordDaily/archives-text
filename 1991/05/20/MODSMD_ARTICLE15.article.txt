Staff should be able to expose cost practices without fear

The recent scrutiny of
Stanford by various government
agencies has exposed areas of
weakness in the system of accountability
for the use of public funds at universities
throughout the country.
But congressional subcommittees,
government audits, advisory panels and
the media have limitations that cannot
expose all the waste of taxpayers' money
that occurs at universities.
The staff member who works in the
laboratory or at the shop level, where
many of these funds are spent, is in a
unique position to identify instances of
waste, abuse, mismanagement, stupidity,
corruption or fraud related to expendi
tures of public funds.

There is a natural perception among staff mem
bers that if they were to expose misuse of funds,
their employment would be jeopardized.

There is, unfortunately, a natural per
ception by staff members that if they
were to come forward with information
that would expose such misuse of funds,
their position of employment would
become jeopardized for having done so.
If you were to ask any staff members
involved in research, many would be able
to cite instances of waste, abuse, mis
management or even fraud. Many would

like to come forward, but will not, out of
fear of reprisal by the University.
Stanford is now in a unique position
to achieve the goal, as stated by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, "to
become a model for the use of and
accountability for public funds by a
research university."
A crucial element in achieving this
goal would be to extend reprisal protec-

tion, with adequate enforcement, to the
University work force. Such protection
would strengthen the weakest link in the
chain of accountability for the use of tax
payers' money.
Kennedy has stated, "We do not flinch
from strict accountability for public
funds." If this is true, then it is time for
Stanford to expand its initiative to
include reprisal protection for University
staff members.
Without this important element,
achievement of such goals will fall short
of realization, and taxpayers' money will
continue to be wasted.
