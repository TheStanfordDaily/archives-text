# Many groups will face adversity if MEChA isn't funded next year
## 
### 
I find it very important that a number
of clarifications be made concerning The
Daily's May 14 article about MEChA and
the MEChA special fee.
First, it is not MEChA programming
that will be threatened, but that of Casa
Zapata, Ballet Folklorico and El Centro
Chicano.
It is too bad that the history of this
special fee has not been publicized, but
approximately three years ago, the Chi
cano/Latino organization SaLSA, which
had controlled these funds, ceased to
function, and MEChA jumped in to res
cue the fee from being lost.
MEChA has done nothing more than
administer funds which have been Casa
Zapata's mqjor source of funding for
Cinco de Mayo, Zoot Suit Week, Posada
and other activities.

I was not critical of MEChA but stated
that it would be in everybody's best
interest to put the special fee with a
politically neutral organization. The
Daily's story suggested that this could be
done through the Latino Student Associ
ation, as founder Benny Sandoval sug
gests. I don't believe the LSA is political
ly neutral.
Like Cesar Chavez, I support, admire
and appreciate MEChA very much. Some
of us seem to forget that the educational
gains made for Chicanos here at Stan
ford and throughout the Southwest were
largely the work of MEChA activism.
Twenty or more years ago, Stanford
made a commitment to the Chicano and
Mexican-American population of this
state. We can call ourselves whatever we
want: Latinos, generic Hispanics or Chi
canos, but the reality is that now that
MEChA has lost, we all have lost.
This should bring us together, despite
labels and acronyms.
