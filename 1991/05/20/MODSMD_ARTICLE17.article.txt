# Reges is interested in principle, not press, in drug policy issue
## 
### 
The Daily article "Lunch with Reges"
seems to be a classic case of a reporter
using selected quotes to present a biased
point of view in the guise of objective
reporting.
The reporter responsible for the story
appears bent on portraying Stuart Reges
as a "selfish and egotistic" showoff inter
ested in manipulating the media.
I find this attitude baffling. Reges
seems far less egotistic than quite a few
Stanford professors I've encountered,
and his actions seem selfish only in the
sense that he seems to be trying to be
true to himself, rather than playing it
"smart" and collecting easy paychecks.
Reges did spend some time talking
about his recent experiences with the
media, but this was in response to a
direct question about the media coverage

he has received. And why shouldn't he be
interested in this? Anyone involved in a
public issue wants to follow what is being
said about it.
My own impression of Reges is that he
is the rarest of rare things — an honest
man. He has lost his job and seriously
damaged his reputation in pursuit of a
matter of principle. He has chosen not to
mouth hypocritical formulas and not to
remain silent.
Whatever you may think about his
opinions about drugs, Reges deserves a
lot of respect. At the very least, he
doesn't deserve to be accused of lacking
"noble motives."
