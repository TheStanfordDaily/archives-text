# Budget passed at marathon meeting
## Project Motivation gets another chance; sorority charity events will lose funding 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Thursday night's ASSU Senate
meeting was the end of an era and
quite possibly a preview of a new
one, as senators bickered until 3
a.m. before reaching a budget
compromise.
The final meeting of the Peo
ple's Platform-controlled senate
was missing quite a few key play
ers, leading to a smaller, more bal
anced senate that spent hours
arguing without being able to
attain the two-thirds majority
necessary to pass budget resolu
tions.
The seemingly never-ending
debate led several senators to sug
gest that next year's senate may
face similar problems for the
entire year and be unable to allo
cate money for anything.
Next year's senate will be
almost evenly split between Stu
dents First and People's Platform
senators, and the two indepen
dents and one Hammer and Coffin
member will likely hold the swing
votes.
But not every vote in last
week's eight-hour senate meeting
went along party lines.
Extremists on both sides of the
debate over the new ASSU finan
cial aid office delayed passage of
the budget for about two hours.
Students First senators wanted to
cut the office's budget signifi
cantly, while People's Platform
senators wanted to maintain the
$8,325 originally budgeted for the
office.
In the end, the senate agreed to
pay the $2,000 membership dues
to the United States Student
Association, fund the registration
for two national conferences of
the association and pay for some
office costs. The $2,200 in salaries
for office staff was completely
eliminated, leaving senator Naomi

Onaga concerned about staffing
the office.
"The salary cut will hurt the
office because the job is a big task
for anyone," said Onaga, a senior.
"It was only a small compensa
tion, but it will discourage a lot
more people who are on financial
aid and need to work from work
ing in the office."
A committee composed of the
new COR senators, Onaga and
graduate senator-elect Neil
Crellin will soon begin a selection
process for the financial-aid office
staff members.
Senate chair Solina Kwan
maintained her long-standing tra
dition of voting to achieve a two
thirds majority for the People's
Platform. For instance, she cast
the deciding vote to increase Pro
gram Board funding for both Bal
let Folklorico and Club Ujamaa.
The senate did manage to
implement one significant piece of
legislation at a reasonable hour.
The Sexual Assault, Prevention,
Education and Response office
received $45,000 in funding.
A joint committee composed of
senators and University adminis
trators will select a sexual assault
response coordinator. The senate
will pay this person for one year
and expects the University to pay
for the costs of the office and coor
dinator in future years.
The senate also provided Pro
ject Motivation with the chance to
apply for additional funding.
At the request of COP-elect
member and graduate senator
John Overdeck, the senate
reserved $6,000 of community
service funding through the Pro
gram Board for the organization.
The group's special-fee request
was inadvertently left off of the
general-election ballot, and
because of low voter turnout in
