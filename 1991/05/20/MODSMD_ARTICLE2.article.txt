# Budget passed at marathon meeting
## Project Motivation gets another chance; sorority charity events will lose funding 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Thursday night's ASSU Senate
meeting was the end of an era and
quite possibly a preview of a new
one, as senators bickered until 3
a.m. before reaching a budget
compromise.
The final meeting of the Peo
ple's Platform-controlled senate
was missing quite a few key play
ers, leading to a smaller, more bal
anced senate that spent hours
arguing without being able to
attain the two-thirds majority
necessary to pass budget resolu
tions.
The seemingly never-ending
debate led several senators to sug
gest that next year's senate may
face similar problems for the
entire year and be unable to allo
cate money for anything.
Next year's senate will be
almost evenly split between Stu
dents First and People's Platform
senators, and the two indepen
dents and one Hammer and Coffin
member will likely hold the swing
votes.
But not every vote in last
week's eight-hour senate meeting
went along party lines.
Extremists on both sides of the
debate over the new ASSU finan
cial aid office delayed passage of
the budget for about two hours.
Students First senators wanted to
cut the office's budget signifi
cantly, while People's Platform
senators wanted to maintain the
$8,325 originally budgeted for the
office.
In the end, the senate agreed to
pay the $2,000 membership dues
to the United States Student
Association, fund the registration
for two national conferences of
the association and pay for some
office costs. The $2,200 in salaries
for office staff was completely
eliminated, leaving senator Naomi

Onaga concerned about staffing
the office.
"The salary cut will hurt the
office because the job is a big task
for anyone," said Onaga, a senior.
"It was only a small compensa
tion, but it will discourage a lot
more people who are on financial
aid and need to work from work
ing in the office."
A committee composed of the
new COR senators, Onaga and
graduate senator-elect Neil
Crellin will soon begin a selection
process for the financial-aid office
staff members.
Senate chair Solina Kwan
maintained her long-standing tra
dition of voting to achieve a two
thirds majority for the People's
Platform. For instance, she cast
the deciding vote to increase Pro
gram Board funding for both Bal
let Folklorico and Club Ujamaa.
The senate did manage to
implement one significant piece of
legislation at a reasonable hour.
The Sexual Assault, Prevention,
Education and Response office
received $45,000 in funding.
A joint committee composed of
senators and University adminis
trators will select a sexual assault
response coordinator. The senate
will pay this person for one year
and expects the University to pay
for the costs of the office and coor
dinator in future years.
The senate also provided Pro
ject Motivation with the chance to
apply for additional funding.
At the request of COP-elect
member and graduate senator
John Overdeck, the senate
reserved $6,000 of community
service funding through the Pro
gram Board for the organization.
The group's special-fee request
was inadvertently left off of the
general-election ballot, and
because of low voter turnout in
the runoff election, it did not
receive approval from the neces
sary 15 percent of the student
body.
As the senate meeting ran into
early Friday morning, senators
insisted on continuing because
they said they did not want to
"dump the budget on next year's
senate." Jason Snyder, an inde
pendent in next year's senate, said
he did not want the new senate to
consider the budget because "no
one else knows about it."
Last year's senate failed to pass
the budget for this year, and this
year's senate was forced to debate
it. COP-elect member and current
deputy senate chair Beth Morgan
said she did not understand the
budget last year and urged the
senate to continue debating until
a satisfactory budget was agreed
upon.
"We who know should make
the compromise," said Morgan, a
sophomore. After the meeting,
she added that it "was important
that our senate pass the budget
because we understood all of the
different line items."
Most of the budget debate
revolved around two main areas of
the ASSU finances — next year's
budget and Program Board fund
ing.
The 1991-92 budget
The majority of next year's

ASSU budget was passed in com
mittee and left untouched during
the senate meeting. The biggest
argument involved the level of
funding for the financial aid
office.
Several senators' pet projects
received consideration during the
meeting, and one of them made its
way into the budget.
Senator Jason Moore con
vinced the senate to include
$1,000 in the budget to pay XTV
to televise next fall's senate meet
ings on a trial basis in order "to be
open to the student body and
improve the behavior of the sen
ate."
Moore first tried to get the sen
ate to approve the proposal as an
independent amendment but
failed to achieve the necessary
two-thirds majority. The funding
proposal was later attached to the
final budget compromise as a way
for the majority to secure Moore's
vote.
The senate also refused to cut
next year's senate chair salary
despite senate chair-elect Kevin
Warsh's campaign promise to
accept a salary cut. Several sena
tors claimed they did "not want to
set a precedent for cutting salaries
for political purposes."
In addition, the senate failed to
approve senator Doug Bone's
amendment to lower the adminis
trative manager's salary. The
salaries for both this position and
the senate chair will remain at
$5,125 next year.
The recently elected "Students
First" COP slate voluntarily took

a pay cut from $5,125 to $4,100.
Slate members were able to get
senate approval for their lowered
salary by putting the change in
the version of the operating bud
get submitted to the senate for
debate — thus avoiding having to
get the two-thirds majority neces
sary to amend the budget.
Program Board
The difficulty of the two-thirds
majority was most clearly seen in
the Program Board debate.
The senate repeatedly rejected
requests to increase funding for
various cultural events on campus
— often failing to achieve the two
thirds majority by one or two
votes.
For instance, the senate
refused to fund the charity events
of the Delta Gamma and Kappa
Alpha Theta sororities, despite
senator Mike Curry's request for
a "last hurrah and personal
favor."
Graduate senator James Vera
argued against funding these
groups, saying the ASSU money
goes to fund the costs of the
events, which then turn profits
that go to charity groups of the
organizers' choice. He added that
the purpose of the Program
Board's community service funds
is to "allow Stanford students to
do direct community service."
The senate ultimately rejected
Curry's appeal and did not give
either sorority any money because
some senators agreed with Vera's
argument and others expressed
strong anti-Greek sentiments.

The senate also provided Pro
ject Motivation with the chance to
apply for additional funding.
At the request of COP-elect
member and graduate senator
John Overdeck, the senate
reserved $6,000 of community
service funding through the Pro
gram Board for the organization.
The group's special-fee request
was inadvertently left off of the
general-election ballot, and
because of low voter turnout in
the runoff election, it did not
receive approval from the neces
sary 15 percent of the student
body.
As the senate meeting ran into
early Friday morning, senators
insisted on continuing because
they said they did not want to
"dump the budget on next year's
senate." Jason Snyder, an inde
pendent in next year's senate, said
he did not want the new senate to
consider the budget because "no
one else knows about it."
Last year's senate failed to pass
the budget for this year, and this
year's senate was forced to debate
it. COP-elect member and current
deputy senate chair Beth Morgan
said she did not understand the
budget last year and urged the
senate to continue debating until
a satisfactory budget was agreed
upon.
"We who know should make
the compromise," said Morgan, a
sophomore. After the meeting,
she added that it "was important
that our senate pass the budget
because we understood all of the
different line items."
Most of the budget debate
revolved around two main areas of
the ASSU finances — next year's
budget and Program Board fund
ing.
The 1991-92 budget
The majority of next year's

ASSU budget was passed in com
mittee and left untouched during
the senate meeting. The biggest
argument involved the level of
funding for the financial aid
office.
Several senators' pet projects
received consideration during the
meeting, and one of them made its
way into the budget.
Senator Jason Moore con
vinced the senate to include
$1,000 in the budget to pay XTV
to televise next fall's senate meet
ings on a trial basis in order "to be
open to the student body and
improve the behavior of the sen
ate."
Moore first tried to get the sen
ate to approve the proposal as an
independent amendment but
failed to achieve the necessary
two-thirds majority. The funding
proposal was later attached to the
final budget compromise as a way
for the majority to secure Moore's
vote.
The senate also refused to cut
next year's senate chair salary
despite senate chair-elect Kevin
Warsh's campaign promise to
accept a salary cut. Several sena
tors claimed they did "not want to
set a precedent for cutting salaries
for political purposes."
In addition, the senate failed to
approve senator Doug Bone's
amendment to lower the adminis
trative manager's salary. The
salaries for both this position and
the senate chair will remain at
$5,125 next year.
The recently elected "Students
First" COP slate voluntarily took

a pay cut from $5,125 to $4,100.
Slate members were able to get
senate approval for their lowered
salary by putting the change in
the version of the operating bud
get submitted to the senate for
debate — thus avoiding having to
get the two-thirds majority neces
sary to amend the budget.
Program Board
The difficulty of the two-thirds
majority was most clearly seen in
the Program Board debate.
The senate repeatedly rejected
requests to increase funding for
various cultural events on campus
— often failing to achieve the two
thirds majority by one or two
votes.
For instance, the senate
refused to fund the charity events
of the Delta Gamma and Kappa
Alpha Theta sororities, despite
senator Mike Curry's request for
a "last hurrah and personal
favor."
Graduate senator James Vera
argued against funding these
groups, saying the ASSU money
goes to fund the costs of the
events, which then turn profits
that go to charity groups of the
organizers' choice. He added that
the purpose of the Program
Board's community service funds
is to "allow Stanford students to
do direct community service."
The senate ultimately rejected
Curry's appeal and did not give
either sorority any money because
some senators agreed with Vera's
argument and others expressed
strong anti-Greek sentiments.
Thursday night's ASSU Senate
meeting was the end of an era and
quite possibly a preview of a new
one, as senators bickered until 3
a.m. before reaching a budget
compromise.
The final meeting of the Peo
ple's Platform-controlled senate
was missing quite a few key play
ers, leading to a smaller, more bal
anced senate that spent hours
arguing without being able to
attain the two-thirds majority
necessary to pass budget resolu
tions.
The seemingly never-ending
debate led several senators to sug
gest that next year's senate may
face similar problems for the
entire year and be unable to allo
cate money for anything.
Next year's senate will be
almost evenly split between Stu
dents First and People's Platform
senators, and the two indepen
dents and one Hammer and Coffin
member will likely hold the swing
votes.
But not every vote in last
week's eight-hour senate meeting
went along party lines.
Extremists on both sides of the
debate over the new ASSU finan
cial aid office delayed passage of
the budget for about two hours.
Students First senators wanted to
cut the office's budget signifi
cantly, while People's Platform
senators wanted to maintain the
$8,325 originally budgeted for the
office.
In the end, the senate agreed to
pay the $2,000 membership dues
to the United States Student
Association, fund the registration
for two national conferences of
the association and pay for some
office costs. The $2,200 in salaries
for office staff was completely
eliminated, leaving senator Naomi

Onaga concerned about staffing
the office.
"The salary cut will hurt the
office because the job is a big task
for anyone," said Onaga, a senior.
"It was only a small compensa
tion, but it will discourage a lot
more people who are on financial
aid and need to work from work
ing in the office."
A committee composed of the
new COR senators, Onaga and
graduate senator-elect Neil
Crellin will soon begin a selection
process for the financial-aid office
staff members.
Senate chair Solina Kwan
maintained her long-standing tra
dition of voting to achieve a two
thirds majority for the People's
Platform. For instance, she cast
the deciding vote to increase Pro
gram Board funding for both Bal
let Folklorico and Club Ujamaa.
The senate did manage to
implement one significant piece of
legislation at a reasonable hour.
The Sexual Assault, Prevention,
Education and Response office
received $45,000 in funding.
A joint committee composed of
senators and University adminis
trators will select a sexual assault
response coordinator. The senate
will pay this person for one year
and expects the University to pay
for the costs of the office and coor
dinator in future years.
The senate also provided Pro
ject Motivation with the chance to
apply for additional funding.

member and graduate senator
