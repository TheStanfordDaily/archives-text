## Giving in to the government 
### 
SEVERAL LESSONS CAN BE
learned from the University's han
dling of the Stuart Reges contro
versy, but perhaps the most useful is the
one learned by Engineering School Dean
James Gibbons: The best way to deal with
a difficult and complex issue is to avoid it.
As investigator in the Reges case, Gib
bons was apparently going to have to
choose between a victory in this country's
continuing drug war and the First
Amendment right to free speech as it
applies to academia. Reges' recommenda
tion that a student try the drug MDA was
generally assumed to be the pivotal issue.
That's how the public and media shaped
the controversy, and that's the choice
most people assumed Gibbons was mak
ing.
Instead, however, Gibbons avoided the
whole free speech issue by firing Reges
for carrying drugs in his backpack and for
providing alcohol to minors. The MDA
suggestion "didn't even enter into the
decision," Gibbons said afterwards.
No free speech issue, no loss of aca
demic freedom. Controversy over, case
closed.
Not so fast.
The national media attention may be
history, but questions still remain for
Stanford's and the nation's drug policy.
The two charges used to cut Reges loose
are only circumstantially proved by
Reges' claims, and both could be applied
to several other faculty and staff mem
bers.
Does Reges' firing imply dismissal for
similar actions by other faculty or staff
members, or was the firing simply neces

sary to get the federal government off
Stanford's back?
Granted, Reges has been the only fac
ulty and staff member foolish enough to
flaunt his drug use and advocacy in the
faces of Stanford officials and federal
drug czar Bob Martinez. But Gibbons and
other Stanford officials claim government
pressure had nothing to do with the fir
ing.
By claiming that the investigation
started before Martinez intervened, the
University missed an important opportu
nity to expose the government's strong
arm tactics in carrying out its drug war
on campuses. The government's implied
threat to withhold $400 million in aid
inevitably influences the University's
decisions and puts Stanford at the mercy
of Martinez' whims. From the start, the
federal threat forced Stanford to abandon
its previously successful policy emphasiz
ing education and individual responsibil
ity â€” replacing it with the new drug and
alcohol enforcement scare tactics.
I'm not saying that universities should
be a haven from the law. Nor am I saying
that drug use and advocacy should be
ignored. But it's clear that universities
should not be a primary conduit for
enforcement of the government's drug
war.
If police or drug enforcement officials
wanted to attack the problem, they
should have arrested Reges themselves.
Instead, the federal government
prefers the phrase "drug war" to allow
abuse of normally recognized academic
freedoms and civil liberties, forcing other
bodies to carry out the government's drug

enforcement policy. Should the voices of
some of this nation's greatest minds be
silenced simply because they choose to
use drugs in their spare time? Should the
universities be the ones to silence them?
What if publishers throughout history
had refused to publish works by those
who have used drugs? Where would we be
without our Byrons and Shelleys, our
Edgar Allen Poes, our Ken Keseys and
Jack Kerouacs?
What if record companies had refused
to sign artists who had experimented
with drugs? Where would we be without
our Elvises, Little Richards, Jim Mor
risons and John Lennons?
Because of the casualties that fall each
year to the nation's drug trade, our gov
ernment has a responsibility to provide
help for addicted segments of our popula
tion and make neighborhoods safe from
rampant drug violence.
However, no matter how much William
Bennett, Martinez or the U.S. Congress
would like to do so, we can't sweep drug
use or drug users under the national car
pet. At the very least, the government
shouldn't make universities carry the
broom.

Tim Marklein is a senior political science
major who wonders if Stanford has ever
received indirect-cost reimbursements for
alcohol provided to minors.
