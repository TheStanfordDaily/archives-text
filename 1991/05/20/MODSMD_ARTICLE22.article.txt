## Arnold Trebach Government is overstepping its bounds when it tries to run universities 
### 
Students at Stanford have
recently been witness to a chilling
spectacle: the extension of Ameri
can governmental power into a sphere of
personal privacy beyond anything ever
before witnessed.

At first glance it all seems so rational
and just, since the miscreant in question
apparently openly flaunted University
policy and etiquette.
But violations of etiquette are not
necessarily crimes, and not all violations
of campus policies are punished by ter
mination of employment, as happened to
Stuart Reges.
Anyone with a sense of what Ameri
can democracy means should be shocked.
Why was the government so con
cerned about Reges? It wasn't because
he paid for two drinks for underaged stu
dents. Rather, federal drug czar Bob
Martinez and his fellow drug warriors
felt threatened by the heresy that Reges
was espousing.
Particularly with his claim that he is a
"responsible drug user," Reges was chal
lenging some of the central myths that
perpetuate our country's intrusive war
on drugs. It has now become clear that
the federal government considers not
only the use of drugs to be criminal, it
even views discussing drugs without
adopting the party line as tantamount to
high treason.
The government used an interesting

tactic in seeing to it that Reges lost his
job. The drug czar invoked a newly
implemented law, known as the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act of
1989, to put Stanford on notice that it
could lose federal education grants if it
was not sufficiently punitive toward this
award-winning lecturer.
When this law first came into effect,
was it not understood as an effort to
curb drug-abuse problems on campus?
Did anyone among the Stanford student
body or administration expect that it
would be used to stifle, and even punish,
unpopular speech about drugs?
One irony of the fact that this law is
being used to force the firing of Reges is
that it was precisely the implementation
of its strict provisions on the Stanford
campus that prompted Reges to protest
the policy in the first place.
Reges decided that the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act was a seri
ous overstepping by the government of
its rightful powers, and he became an
activist on the issue.
His gravest concern was that campus
officials were being enlisted as police
agents for the government's drug war —
and given Reges' fate, it is difficult to say
Reges was wrong.
I do not object to campuses having
anti-drug policies — in fact, I helped
draft policies for American University.
But I am concerned that the types of

Universities must be intellectual sanctuaries, in
part because of an important truth: that much
good scholarship is heavily laced with heresy.

punitive-oriented policies being pushed
by our modern-day prohibitionists are
not the way to deal with the very real
problems caused by drugs.
Currently campuses are being encour
aged, if not forced, to mete out harsher
and harsher penalties to students
involved with drugs and alcohol, without
regard to the specifics of their situations.
I would submit that by and large,
these kinds of policies do not deal with
drug problems; they merely try to wish
them away by creating a climate of fear
and suspicion — with a dose of coercion
wherever necessary.
All of this smacks rather sadly and
ominously of a creeping totalitarianism
in this country, "justified" by drugs.
Recently I visited the Soviet Union,
and found Soviet citizens were shocked
that our top anti-drug official was called
the drug czar. While Russians are mov
ing away from totalitarianism, bureau
cratic control and the gulag, we seem to
be moving toward adopting some of
these smothering artifacts in the name
of making our nation drug-free, and

therefore safe.
I trust that many at Stanford are as
disturbed by the developments sur
rounding the Reges case as I am. I would
hope that you do not forget this case, for
the precedent it sets puts many people at
risk — even if they do not taunt the drug
czar and publicly criticize the war on
drugs.
The chilling effect of these events will
be widespread and concerns all sectors of
our society. The effect on the sanctity of
the university may be irreparable.
Stanford students should remind
their University that in supinely acqui
escing to the government's questionable
wishes, it has abetted a serious violation
of basic American values.
Universities must be intellectual sanc
tuaries, in part because of an important
truth: Much good scholarship is heavily
laced with heresy.
Perhaps through the efforts of edu
cated young scholars who have seen
firsthand the arbitrary viciousness of the
government's drug war, a real national
opposition can grow. Constant, sustained

and legal protest at Stanford may
encourage other universities — all of
which have to answer to the same gov
ernment and the same new laws — to
join together to cease the expansion of
this domestic war.
Make no mistake: Reges' case is not
about carrying drugs in a backpack, or
using drugs, or serving alcohol to
minors. It is about core American values
in regard to the most important doc
trines of free societies: the rights to free
dom of belief, speech, assembly and peti
tions for grievances.
We at the Drug Policy Foundation find
the new form of McCarthyism which
snared Reges to be repugnant. Because
of that, I have provided legal advice to
him, and we are contemplating helping
Reges in legal action against the Univer
sity, and perhaps against the federal gov
ernment.
We hope student associations will join
us in standing down this anti-drug
fanaticism, while standing up for citi
zens' rights to reasonable privacy and
free expression. After all, who really can
say which individual or what social insti
tution is next?

Students at Stanford have
recently been witness to a chilling
spectacle: the extension of Ameri
can governmental power into a sphere of
personal privacy beyond anything ever
before witnessed.

At first glance it all seems so rational
and just, since the miscreant in question
apparently openly flaunted University
policy and etiquette.
But violations of etiquette are not
necessarily crimes, and not all violations
of campus policies are punished by ter
mination of employment, as happened to
Stuart Reges.
Anyone with a sense of what Ameri
can democracy means should be shocked.
Why was the government so con
cerned about Reges? It wasn't because
he paid for two drinks for underaged stu
dents. Rather, federal drug czar Bob
Martinez and his fellow drug warriors
felt threatened by the heresy that Reges
was espousing.
Particularly with his claim that he is a
"responsible drug user," Reges was chal
lenging some of the central myths that
perpetuate our country's intrusive war
on drugs. It has now become clear that
the federal government considers not
only the use of drugs to be criminal, it
even views discussing drugs without
adopting the party line as tantamount to
high treason.
The government used an interesting

tactic in seeing to it that Reges lost his
job. The drug czar invoked a newly
implemented law, known as the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act of
1989, to put Stanford on notice that it
could lose federal education grants if it
was not sufficiently punitive toward this
award-winning lecturer.
When this law first came into effect,
was it not understood as an effort to
curb drug-abuse problems on campus?
Did anyone among the Stanford student
body or administration expect that it
would be used to stifle, and even punish,
unpopular speech about drugs?
One irony of the fact that this law is
being used to force the firing of Reges is
that it was precisely the implementation
of its strict provisions on the Stanford
campus that prompted Reges to protest
the policy in the first place.
Reges decided that the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act was a seri
ous overstepping by the government of
its rightful powers, and he became an
activist on the issue.
His gravest concern was that campus
officials were being enlisted as police
agents for the government's drug war —
and given Reges' fate, it is difficult to say
Reges was wrong.
I do not object to campuses having
anti-drug policies — in fact, I helped
draft policies for American University.
But I am concerned that the types of

Universities must be intellectual sanctuaries, in
part because of an important truth: that much
good scholarship is heavily laced with heresy.

punitive-oriented policies being pushed
by our modern-day prohibitionists are
not the way to deal with the very real
problems caused by drugs.
Currently campuses are being encour
aged, if not forced, to mete out harsher
and harsher penalties to students
involved with drugs and alcohol, without
regard to the specifics of their situations.
I would submit that by and large,
these kinds of policies do not deal with
drug problems; they merely try to wish
them away by creating a climate of fear
and suspicion — with a dose of coercion
wherever necessary.

ominously of a creeping totalitarianism
