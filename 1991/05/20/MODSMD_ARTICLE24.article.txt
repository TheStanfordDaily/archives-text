## Netters smash their way into NCAA semis 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Up 5-4 in the
third set, Michael Flanagan was
serving for match and team vic
tory at 30-30. Stanford was lead
ing 4-0. Two winners away from
the semifinals.
Arizona State's Ross Matheson
dug in — and broke Flanagan to
even things up at five apiece. No. 3
doubles took to the courts.
Flanagan hung on for the 7-5
victory, but not without a fight.

Men's Tennis

Cardinal 5, Gamecocks 1

Cardinal 6, Sun Devils 0 |

His play was indicative of the
men's tennis team's performance
as a whole during its first two
days at the NCAA team tourna
ment.
Stanford advanced to the
national semis by winning two in
singles — downing South Car
olina in the second-round Satur
day and ASU in the quarters Sun
day — but neither match was as
effortless as the scores indicate.
The Cardinal was gutsy and
tough when it counted, but there
were few gimme matches.
Especially Sunday
Jason Yee mauled Chris Gam
bino at No. 5, 6-2, 6-2 in a little
over an hour. Vimal Patel quickly
followed suit, annihilating Joel
Finnigan two and two at No. 4.
But that was it for the sure
things.
After dowing Brian Gyetko 6-4
in the first, Stanford's No. 1, Alex
O'Brien, lost any advantage he
had had, falling behind 0-I,then 1-
2. On the next court over,
'Jonathan Stark had little trouble
with Dave Lomicky at first, win
ning set number one 6-3 before
Lomicky decided he really wanted
it.
The story was more of the same
on courts three and six. Jared
Palmer never had an advantage
with Dan Marting at No. 3, hold
ing a lead of no more than one
before pulling out a first-set
tiebreaker 7-3. And Flanagan was
down 4-6,0-2 to Matheson.
A victory, much less a win in
singles, was not a given by any
means.
"At least three matches could
have gone either way, and they
have outstanding doubles right
down the line," said Stanford
coach Dick Gould. "The first three
singles could easily have gone
either way — and either team
could have won 5-4."
Stanford, however, is 20-4 on
the season, and three-time
defending national champions for
a reason.
Talent. And Guts.
Every Cardinal player dug in,
giving his match everything he
had, and somehow pulled out a
win.
"I didn't know if we would go to

doubles, but everyone played so
well," O'Brien said. "Everyone
played really clutch matches. Peo
ple weren't on top of their games
but [everyonel played smart ten
nis and came through."
Beginning with 0.8. himself.
Down 1-2 in the second, O'Brien
broke to go up 3-2. Gyetko, how
ever, wasn't through, and tied
things up at four, then again at
five. It looked like a three-setter
was in the making when O'Brien
took his game up a notch to close
out the victory 6-4, 7-5.
Three-love Cardinal, three
tough ones to go.

At No. 3, Palmer appeared to
have the match under control,
going up 4-2 after taking the
tiebreaker in the first. But once
again ASU refused to give in, and
Marting clawed his way back,
evening the set at 5-5.
It was then that Palmer emu
lated 0.8.'s heroics. After losing
serve at 5-4, Palmer pounded his
way to a 6-5 break, then hung on
at 40-30 for the 7-6 (7-3), 7-5 win.
Four wins, however,does not a
team victory make. And the Cardi
nal's remaining singles matches
looked shaky. Not only had Flana
gan lost his first 6-4 before

squeaking out a 7-5 win in the sec
ond set, but after going up 5-3 in
the third he allowed Matheson
back in the match.
And things looked even worse
at No. 2. Stark lost control of the
match, going down 5-7 in the sec
ond and letting Lomicky go up 5-3
in the third.
Doubles after all?
Not when the Cardinal's com
petitors put up the gut-check per
formances of the year. Especially
Stark.
The No. 3 player in the country


Ra)iv Chandrasekaran — Daily
Sophomore Jonathan Stark continues to dominate since his return from a stress fracture. Stark defeat
ed Arizona State's Dave Lomicky 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 yesterday as Stanford shut out the Sun Devils 6-0. The Car
dinal meets No. 1 USC today.
according to the Volvo Tennis/Col
legiate poll earned his ranking
during hour four of his match
Sunday. At 4-5, Lomicky got to
serve for the match. The way
things had been going on Court 2,
Arizona State fans were sure this
one was theirs.
Stark had different ideas.
Lomicky went up double match
point before Stark clawed his way
back to deuce.
The battle was far from over.
Stark hit one wide. Match point
ASU. Fought back to deuce. Stark
volley into net. Match point ASU.
Fought back to deuce. Stark bad
return of serve. Match point ASU.

Fought back to deuce. Stark into
net. Match point ASU. Fought
back to deuce.
Three advantages later, it was
Stark, not Lomicky's point, and
the match was over. After fighting
off five match points, Stark
quickly held his serve, then broke,
and it was 6-0 Cardinal.
"We played a real gutsy match
today. We fought really well. Jon
and my matches were indicative of
the day," Flanagan said.
Saturday wasn't much differnt.
Against the Gamecocks it was
Patel who wrapped things up
quickly, dismissing Andreis
Theron 6-4, 6-1 to give Stanford
an early advantage.
But South Carolina was more
stubborn than the Cardinal —
and certainly than Stanford fans
— thought. Especially considering
the squad was competing without
its No. 1 and 3 players.

"They deserve an awful lot of
credit," Gould said. "It's pretty
hard when you're a six-legged
insect to play I with 1 two legs miss
ing, but they really stayed in the
match."
O'Brien didn't have too much
trouble with David Hopper at No.
1, baselining his way to a 6-3, 6-3
win. And Flanagan never got
behind in his match with Mark
Palus at No. 6 (though the score
was tied at times), breaking for a
6-3, 6-4 victory.
The remainder of the lineup
had a little tougher time. At No. 2,
Stark was leading Johan Sand
berg 5-2 when Sandberg reeled off
three straight points to tie things
up at five. After evening the score
at six, Sandberg repeatedly broke
Mr. Serve himself to take the
marathon tie-breaker 11-9.
But that was it for Sandberg,

and Stark cruised to a 6-7, 6-3, 6-
2 win.
At No. 5 Yee narrowly out
gunned Erick Sydow - who had
never lost two tiebreakers in the
same match — 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2).
Palmer was the only victim.
After downing Dirk Hahneiser
(no, South Carolina doesn't
recruit in the United States) 6-2,
he fell victim to the European's
cross-court returns. Hahneiser
took control with three consecu
tive cross-court forehand winners,
and went on to a 2-6, 6-3, 6-1 vic
tory.
"Hahneiser got a little confi
dence and turned the match
around," Gould said. "He started
serving and volleying and Jared
has been having trouble with his
left volley. It's to the other guy's
credit, not to Jared's fault."
