## Netters smash their way into NCAA semis 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Up 5-4 in the
third set, Michael Flanagan was
serving for match and team vic
tory at 30-30. Stanford was lead
ing 4-0. Two winners away from
the semifinals.
Arizona State's Ross Matheson
dug in — and broke Flanagan to
even things up at five apiece. No. 3
doubles took to the courts.
Flanagan hung on for the 7-5
victory, but not without a fight.

Men's Tennis

Cardinal 5, Gamecocks 1

Cardinal 6, Sun Devils 0 |

His play was indicative of the
men's tennis team's performance
as a whole during its first two
days at the NCAA team tourna
ment.
Stanford advanced to the
national semis by winning two in
singles — downing South Car
olina in the second-round Satur
day and ASU in the quarters Sun
day — but neither match was as
effortless as the scores indicate.
The Cardinal was gutsy and
tough when it counted, but there
were few gimme matches.
Especially Sunday
Jason Yee mauled Chris Gam
bino at No. 5, 6-2, 6-2 in a little
over an hour. Vimal Patel quickly
followed suit, annihilating Joel
Finnigan two and two at No. 4.
But that was it for the sure
things.
After dowing Brian Gyetko 6-4
in the first, Stanford's No. 1, Alex
O'Brien, lost any advantage he
had had, falling behind 0-I,then 1-
2. On the next court over,
'Jonathan Stark had little trouble
with Dave Lomicky at first, win
ning set number one 6-3 before
Lomicky decided he really wanted
it.
The story was more of the same
on courts three and six. Jared
Palmer never had an advantage
with Dan Marting at No. 3, hold
ing a lead of no more than one
before pulling out a first-set
tiebreaker 7-3. And Flanagan was
down 4-6,0-2 to Matheson.
A victory, much less a win in
singles, was not a given by any
means.
"At least three matches could
have gone either way, and they
have outstanding doubles right
down the line," said Stanford
coach Dick Gould. "The first three
singles could easily have gone
either way — and either team
could have won 5-4."
Stanford, however, is 20-4 on
the season, and three-time
defending national champions for
a reason.
Talent. And Guts.
Every Cardinal player dug in,
giving his match everything he
had, and somehow pulled out a
win.
"I didn't know if we would go to

doubles, but everyone played so
well," O'Brien said. "Everyone
played really clutch matches. Peo
ple weren't on top of their games
but [everyonel played smart ten
nis and came through."
Beginning with 0.8. himself.
Down 1-2 in the second, O'Brien
broke to go up 3-2. Gyetko, how
ever, wasn't through, and tied
things up at four, then again at
five. It looked like a three-setter
was in the making when O'Brien
took his game up a notch to close
out the victory 6-4, 7-5.
Three-love Cardinal, three
tough ones to go.

At No. 3, Palmer appeared to
have the match under control,
going up 4-2 after taking the
tiebreaker in the first. But once
again ASU refused to give in, and
Marting clawed his way back,
evening the set at 5-5.
It was then that Palmer emu
lated 0.8.'s heroics. After losing
serve at 5-4, Palmer pounded his
way to a 6-5 break, then hung on
at 40-30 for the 7-6 (7-3), 7-5 win.
Four wins, however,does not a
team victory make. And the Cardi
nal's remaining singles matches
looked shaky. Not only had Flana
gan lost his first 6-4 before

squeaking out a 7-5 win in the sec
ond set, but after going up 5-3 in
the third he allowed Matheson
back in the match.
And things looked even worse
at No. 2. Stark lost control of the
match, going down 5-7 in the sec
ond and letting Lomicky go up 5-3
in the third.
Doubles after all?
Not when the Cardinal's com
petitors put up the gut-check per
formances of the year. Especially
Stark.
