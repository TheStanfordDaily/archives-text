# Cardinal pumped, ready to even score with Trojans
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga — Something's
looking mighty familiar round
this neck o' the woods.
The Cardinal is in the semifi
nals of the NCAA men's tennis
tournament — for the fourth year
in a row, and 18th time in 21 tries.
And Stanford will be looking into
the whites of the eyes of none
other than Pacific 10 Conference
rival USC.
As Stanford was downing Ari
zona State on the McWharter
back courts Sunday afternoon,
the top-ranked Trojans routinely
disposed of Florida 6-0 in front of
thouands in the main stadium to
advance to today's semis.
There will be no surprises
between the squads. Stanford and
the Trojans have met three times
this year already as a team, and
numerous competitors have faced
off in individual tournaments dur
ing the season.
The Trojans hold the advan

tage, but the Cardinal has the
momentum. USC took the first
two meetings, downing Stanford
5-4 in the semifinals of the
National Team Indoors in Febru
ary, and holding off the Cardinal
5-4 in Los Angeles the first week
in April.
The Cardinal, however,
soundly drubbed its southern
neighbors 5-1 in the squads' last
meeting on the Farm.
No one doubts it's going to be a
great one.
"I'm expecting a real good
match. The teams match up real
evenly It should be a close match,
[but] anything can happen," said
Stanford coach Dick Gould. "It
should be a real fine match from
the spectators' standpoint, which
is what it should be."
"I think it's going to be 5-4 one
way or the other," added USC
coach Dick Leach. "I think who
ever plays looser will win the
match, [but] Stanford's probably
got a little more talent than we
do."
In fact, when asked at the
beginning of the tournament,
Leach actually picked the Cardi
nal to go all the way, even though
his squad was ranked No. 1. But
that response may have some
thing to do with USC's previous
performances at the NCAA team
tourney.
In nine trips to the semis the
Trojans have yet to reach the
national final, and Stanford beat
USC the three times the two
squads have met in the final four.
Alex O'Brien, playing at No. 1
singles for the Cardinal, disagrees
with Leach.
"The pressure's on both teams,
but probably a little more on us
since they've beat us two times,"
O'Brien said. "We definitely have
something to prove because
they're the No. 1 seed. We will
have to play really tough to beat
them. It's going to be a dogfight."
Whatever the outcome, all
members of the Cardinal, coaches
included, are ecstatic about the
matchup. Not only is the Cardinal
overjoyed at having the opportu
nity to defend its national champi
onships, but it's also excited to
participate in some great tennis.
"It's going to be really excit
ing," Jonathan Stark said. "It's
going to be great matches all the
way through. Everyone has been
playing real well."
The victor of this morning's
contest will face the winner of the
Cal-Georgia semifinal in the
107 th NCAA team finals tomor
row.
While Stanford's and USC's
quarterfinal matches were chal
lenging and engrossing, they
couldn't touch the excitement of
the other two quarter contests.
The sixth-ranked Golden Bears
had their paws full trying to tame
the LSU Tigers. The favored
Bears were tied at two apiece with
Louisiana State after two and a
half hours of play and No. 3 dou
bles took to the courts. An hour
later Cal closed out the remaining
singles matches to take a 4-2
advantage, but both one and two
doubles were sent into action.
Adding a twist of intrigue to
the plot, a bank of fog moved into
Athens (sound familiar, Northern
Californians?) and matches were
stopped and started (jlependijig on
the intensity of drips- ' Jf
The Bears' Matt Stroyman and
Pete Fitzpatrick eventually sealed
a ticket to the semis with a 6-1, 6-
2 victory at No. 3 doubles.
The UCLA-Georgia match was

one of the all-time great NCAA
tournament contests. Favored
UCLA was almost upset in sin
gles. Even though Bruin Jason
Netter defeated the nation's No. 2
player, A 1 Parker, only one other
Bruin, Fritz Bissell, could pull out
his match.
Four-two Georgia after singles.
however, was not ready
to call it a season. Pour hours into
the match, the Bruin No. 3 dou
bles tandem of Billy Barber and
David Nainkin downed Ivan
Baron and Wade McGuire. 4-3
Georgia. Temperature 50 and
dropping. An hour later Bill
Behrens and Robbie Wendell
pulled off a straight-setter. 4-4.
Down to No.l doubles.
After a 7-6 first-set victory (and
a whole lot of barking), Parker
and partner Patricio Arnold were
downed by Bissell and Mark
Knowles 7-5. One set would deter
mine the victor.
And then it decided to rain.
With Parker and Arnold up 4-1 in
the deciding set, the mist got so
heavy that play was called. 10:00
and counting.
10:10, match resumed. 10:15,
the Bruin duo held serve. Six
hours and 20 minutes — and
three rain delays — after the first
serve, Georgia pulled off the
biggest upset of the tournament,
downing the second-ranked Bru
ins 5-4 with the 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 6-2
victory at No. 1 doubles.
It is the fourth straight year
that UCLA has been defeated 5-4.
In second round action on Sat
urday, USC annihilated Notre
Dame 6-0, Florida downed Ten
nessee 5-2, UCLA demolished
Mississippi State 5-1, Cal barely
survived the Waves of Pepperdine
5-4, Arizona State held off Ken
tucky 5-3, LSU de-horned the
Texas Christian Frogs 5-3 and
Georgia outlasted Miami 5-2 at
12:30 at night. The 4 p.m. match
didn't get underway until 7:30
due to rain, then never ended.
