# World Cup preview? Argentina kicks U.S. nationals, 1-0
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
In what could have been a pre
view of a 1994 World Cup contest,
the Argentine national team
defeated the U.S. 1-0 at Stanford
Stadium yesterday afternoon.
The U.S. team played well
throughout, but was unable to
capitalize on its opportunities.
Argentina, despite playing with
out some of its biggest names, had
more scoring chances and finally
made good on one in the 33rd
minute of the game.
Carlos Alfaro Moreno beat the
defense with a pass to Dario
Franco, who had slipped past the
defenders. Franco controlled the
ball and left-footed it past the
right side of goalkeeper Tony
Meola for the game's only score.
The goal came after a flurry of
several good chances for
Argentina, but the U.S. bounced
back to have a few good chances
before the half. After intermission
Hugo Perez was inserted into the
lineup for the host team and he
made an immediate impact with
his highly developed ball skills.
But the Americans' fate was
basically sealed with 30 minutes
remaining. Alfaro Moreno stole a
sloppy U.S. pass and headed for
the goal. Fernando Clavyo was
able to bring him down to save the
breakaway opportunity but was
given a red card and ejected for
the play. The U.S. then had to go
the remainder of the game with 10
men.
Despite this disadvantage, the
Americans had a few good shots at
scoring late in the game when
Argentina collapsed into a defen
sive posture. The best came on a

free kick with only seconds
remaining when Marcelo Balboa
cracked a shot from 28 yards out
and goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea
was barely able to make a diving
stop.
Balboa, who is a member of the
San Francisco Bay Blackhawks,
was named the MVP for the
United States while speedy for
ward Ariel Boldrini was the MVP
for Argentina.
Argentina played without 1990
World Cup stars Diego Maradona,
who is under international sus
pension due to charges of drug
trafficking, and Claudio Caniggia,
who is playing with a club team in
Italy, but did field international
veterans like Goycochea and
Oscar Huggeri for the contest.
The game was played in front
of 31,761 people, the fifth-largest
crowd to see the national team
play in this country in a non-
Olympic match. The largest crowd
in a non-Olympic match was the
61,000 people who watched the
Soviet Union play at Stanford last
winter, while the crowd of over
78,000 that saw the U.S. beat
Costa Rica in the 1984 Olympics is
the largest ever to see the national
team play in this country.
Because of this fan support,
Stanford Stadium is a likely site to
be selected for competition in the
1994 World Cup, hosted by the
United States. Stanford is one of
33 venues bidding to host
matches; 12 sites will be selected
sometime this year.
While the Rose Bowl is almost
assured of hosting the final
match, Stanford is a strong con
tender for the opener of the
world's most popular sporting
event.
