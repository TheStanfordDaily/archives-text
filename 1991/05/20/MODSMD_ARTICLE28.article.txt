# Baseball earns split with Santa Clara
## NCAA regional pairings due out today 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team is
not exactly blazing its way into
the postseason. Staying true to
the inconsistency that has
plagued it all year, Stanford
bombed Santa Clara Saturday 10-
1, only to lose a ninth-inning lead
yesterday and fall 6-5.

Broncos 6, Cardinal 5

The split ends the Cardinal's
regular season at 37-21, while the
Broncos finish at 34-25. With the
NCAA regional pairings being
announced today, Stanford will
head into the playoffs with a 3-4
record over its last seven games.
Yet according to Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess, these recent set
backs will have little bearing come
the regional.
"[The losses] won't have any
effect on us," Marquess said. "The
regionals are a whole different
level, a whole different experience.
Being there before will help us."
Though the losses may not
affect the team's attitude or play,
it certainly will make a difference
in the minds of the tournament
selection committee. Ranked No.
9 by both Baseball America and
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, Stan
ford's chance to gain a No. 1 seed
was already slim, and after this
weekend it seems highly unlikely
that the Cardinal will be awarded
that lofty regional status.
"This game probably cost us a
No. 1 seed," said assistant coach
Dean Stotz after yesterday's loss,
"but then again you never know
what will happen."
Sort of like the team he
coaches. After Saturday's victory,
Stanford first basemen David
McCarty said that if his team had
not been so inconsistent all season
they would be top five in the coun
try. This is probably true, and this
weekend only served to highlight
the problem.
Stanford entered the two game
home-and-home series with an
eight-game winning streak
against the Broncos. And after
Saturday's beating, it looked like
the Cardinal might never lose
again.
Stanford opened the game with
two runs in the bottom of the first
with the help of a couple of dou
bles from McCarty and Ryan
Turner, and then opened the
home run floodgates to cruise the

rest of the way home. Marquess
had the green light on all after
noon, and his men did not disap
point. Both Turner and McCarty
hit shots over the left field wall
with the count 3-0, turning what
is usually the gimme strike into
some Cardinal runs.
Turner's blast was a three run
job in the third to make it 5-0 in
Stanford's favor, and McCarty fol
lowed with a similiar — albeit solo
— shot the next inning. Roger
Burnett got into the festivities in
the fifth with a solo shot of his
own, but McCarty was not done
yet.
The Houston native would fin
ish the day going 4-for-4, adding
another solo home run in the
sixth to miss hitting for the cycle
by an extra bag. McCarty ended
what could have been his last
game at Sunken Diamond with a
single, a double and two home
runs. The junior is eligible for the
mcyor league draft in June.
"It was a great performance,"
said Marquess of his national
player-of-the-year candidate. "It's
a good way to go out if it is his last
game here."
Stanford's offensive fireworks
were in full force, and starter
Willie Adams made sure that the
Broncos did not follow suit. The
freshman pitched seven shutout
innings, striking out four while
yielding no walks. Adams' record
is now 7-2.
"He pitched really well for us,"
Marquess said. "He didn't have
his good stuff, but he still shut
them out. On the whole he has
had a great season."
The longball came back yester
day to once again dictate the
game, but this time it was the
Broncos' time to shine. Roger
Burnett would hit his 12th homer
of year to make it 4-2 in the top of
the sixth only to see Santa Clara
use a fence beater of its own to get
the last word.
Down 5-4 in the bottom of the
ninth, Bronco leadoff hitter Andy
Solomon took reliever Scott Weiss'
second pitch over the right field
wall to even the score and once
again show why people question
the dependability of Stanford
pitching.
Weiss had a chance to get out of
the inning with two outs and
Howie Kenndy on second, but
Rick Bianchina lined a ball into
left field to score Kennedy and end
the game.
"When this team is on, it can
beat anybody, but when it's not it
can lose to anybody," Marquess
said. "That's the way it has been
all year."

The longball came back yester
day to once again dictate the
game, but this time it was the
Broncos' time to shine. Roger
Burnett would hit his 12th homer
of year to make it 4-2 in the top of
the sixth only to see Santa Clara
use a fence beater of its own to get
the last word.
Down 5-4 in the bottom of the
ninth, Bronco leadoff hitter Andy
Solomon took reliever Scott Weiss'
second pitch over the right field
wall to even the score and once
again show why people question
the dependability of Stanford
pitching.
Weiss had a chance to get out of
the inning with two outs and
Howie Kenndy on second, but
Rick Bianchina lined a ball into
left field to score Kennedy and end
the game.
"When this team is on, it can
beat anybody, but when it's not it
can lose to anybody," Marquess
said. "That's the way it has been
all year."

The Stanford baseball team is
not exactly blazing its way into

the inconsistency that has
plagued it all year, Stanford
bombed Santa Clara Saturday 10-
1, only to lose a ninth-inning lead
yesterday and fall 6-5.

Baseball

Cardinal 10, Broncos 1

Broncos 6, Cardinal 5

The split ends the Cardinal's
regular season at 37-21, while the
Broncos finish at 34-25. With the
NCAA regional pairings being
announced today, Stanford will
head into the playoffs with a 3-4
record over its last seven games.
Yet according to Cardinal coach
Mark Marquess, these recent set
backs will have little bearing come
the regional.
"[The losses] won't have any
effect on us," Marquess said. "The
regionals are a whole different
level, a whole different experience.
Being there before will help us."
Though the losses may not
affect the team's attitude or play,
it certainly will make a difference
in the minds of the tournament
selection committee. Ranked No.
9 by both Baseball America and
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, Stan
ford's chance to gain a No. 1 seed
was already slim, and after this
weekend it seems highly unlikely
that the Cardinal will be awarded
that lofty regional status.
"This game probably cost us a
No. 1 seed," said assistant coach
Dean Stotz after yesterday's loss,
"but then again you never know
what will happen."
Sort of like the team he
coaches. After Saturday's victory,
Stanford first basemen David
McCarty said that if his team had
not been so inconsistent all season
they would be top five in the coun
try. This is probably true, and this
weekend only served to highlight
the problem.
Stanford entered the two game
home-and-home series with an
eight-game winning streak
against the Broncos. And after
Saturday's beating, it looked like
the Cardinal might never lose
again.
Stanford opened the game with
two runs in the bottom of the first
with the help of a couple of dou
bles from McCarty and Ryan
Turner, and then opened the
home run floodgates to cruise the

rest of the way home. Marquess
had the green light on all after
noon, and his men did not disap
point. Both Turner and McCarty
hit shots over the left field wall
with the count 3-0, turning what
is usually the gimme strike into
some Cardinal runs.
Turner's blast was a three run
job in the third to make it 5-0 in
Stanford's favor, and McCarty fol
lowed with a similiar — albeit solo
— shot the next inning. Roger
Burnett got into the festivities in
the fifth with a solo shot of his
own, but McCarty was not done
yet.
The Houston native would fin
ish the day going 4-for-4, adding
another solo home run in the
sixth to miss hitting for the cycle
by an extra bag. McCarty ended
what could have been his last
game at Sunken Diamond with a
single, a double and two home
runs. The junior is eligible for the
mcyor league draft in June.
"It was a great performance,"
said Marquess of his national
player-of-the-year candidate. "It's
a good way to go out if it is his last
game here."
Stanford's offensive fireworks
were in full force, and starter
Willie Adams made sure that the
Broncos did not follow suit. The
freshman pitched seven shutout
innings, striking out four while
yielding no walks. Adams' record
is now 7-2.
"He pitched really well for us,"
Marquess said. "He didn't have
his good stuff, but he still shut
them out. On the whole he has
had a great season."
The longball came back yester
day to once again dictate the
game, but this time it was the
Broncos' time to shine. Roger
Burnett would hit his 12th homer
of year to make it 4-2 in the top of
the sixth only to see Santa Clara

Howie Kenndy on second, but
Rick Bianchina lined a ball into

the game.
"When this team is on, it can
beat anybody, but when it's not it
can lose to anybody," Marquess
said. "That's the way it has been
all year."
