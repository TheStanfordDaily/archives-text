# Just one stroke short
## Golf narrowly nipped in Nike Northwest 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's golf team went
up to Corvallis, Ore., looking for a last
minute tuneup for the NCAA Western
Regionals on Thursday.
And the Nike Northwest Golf Tour
nament provided the linksters with an
opportunity to hone their skills, but it
also raised the ire in many Stanford
players with their second-place finish â€”
one stroke behind Oregon.
Having beaten every team in the tour
ney, the Cardinal entered the competi
tion deservedly confident. But then the
rain came down. It poured and only 18 of
Friday's 36 scheduled holes were played.
And with the rain came the lift, clean
and lie rule initiated by the Oregon State
coach. The rule stipulated that a player
could lift the ball, clean it and lay it a
club length's away from its original lay
ing position.
"Teams weren't getting penalized for
hitting in the rough while we were hit
ting on the fairways," said sophomore
Mike Milliken. "They could hit in the
weeds and lift, clean and lay it a club's
length out of the rough. Players were
hitting behind trees and they were able
to move their balls into decent position.
"I don't mean to bitch and moan
about it, but part of the game of golf is
being able to negotiate bad lies. And the
better teams can do that."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal remained
tough throughout the tourney, turning
out the tournament's best round on Sat
urday when thev shot a one over par,
289.
At the end of 36 holes of play, Oregon
led Stanford. However, Cardinal junior
Christian Cevaer, Oregon State's Juan
Vickers and Oregon's Doug DuChateau
were all tied for the individual lead at
one under par.
So the trio engaged in a sudden-death
playoff. In the first two holes, they all
tied. But in the third, DuChateau three
putted to eliminate himself. It was just
Cevaer and Vickers. If Cevaer won the
playoff, the Cardinal squad would tie
Oregon for first. But because the Cardi
nal's fifth man, freshman Notah Begay,
shot a better 36 holes the Cardinal
would be victorious.
Cevaer and Vickers tied the fourth
hole. And the fifth hole. But on the sixth
hole Vickers birdied while Cevaer
parred. Cevaer had to settle for runner

up with a one under par, and the Cardi
nal team did likewise.
"I couldn't hole out many putts,"
Cevaer said. "Out of the 36 holes, I hit
30 greens, but I missed a lot of birdie
opportunities. If my putting had gone
average, I would have finished a good
five or six strokes under."
"That's just the way it goes," Milliken
said. "Technically, we should have
drummed those teams, but Oregon and
Oregon State are familiar with the
course."
All in all, Cardinal coach Wally Good
win was pleased with his team's perfor
mance considering the two huge rain
delays and the hideous weather condi
tions.
"This tournament did exactly what I
hoped it would do for us," Goodwin said.
"We tuned up and played pretty good in
lousy weather."
The Cardinal received stellar perfor
mances from both sophomores Dave
Rutkowski and Milliken. Rutkowski
drilled a one over par for the two days,
placing him sixth individually.
"I played really solid, but I hit a few
bad shots," said Rutkowski. He went 27
holes without hitting a birdie, then
birdied the 10th, 13th, 14th and 15th
holes before bogeying the 16th and 17th.
"It's disappointing to end the way I did."
Milliken, making his first tournament
appearance after being sidelined for
nearly three weeks with tendinitis in his
knee, shot a 74 followed by a 73 to finish
three over par in seventh place.
"I didn't play as well as I could have,
but I qualified by three shots for Region
al," Milliken said. Milliken beat out
sophomore Brad Lanning, who played as
an individual, to earn the fifth spot on
the squad for Regionals.
"In the back nine Saturday it started
getting really heated," Milliken said. "I
made three birdies, and when I birdied
the putt on the 14th I realized that I
could shoot a really low score."
Freshman Casey Martin shot a 75
and a 73 to finish fourth among the Car
dinal, while Begay rounded out the Card
five with a below average 151.
Maybe Cevaer put this tournament in
the best light.
"It doesn't matter what happened in
Oregon," he said. "It was a good team
effort and we feel good about ourselves.
We should make it to nationals if every
one's on top of their games."
