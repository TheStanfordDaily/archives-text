# Former Soviet foreign minister welcomed by Shultz serenade
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Saturday afternoon, former Secretary
of State George Shultz had Georgia on his
mind. He also had it on his vocal cords.
At a Hoover Institution luncheon in
honor of former Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, Shultz sang
"Georgia On My Mind," much to the
amusement of Georgian-born Shevard
nadze and the professors, Hoover affili
ates, and political and business magnates
at the function.
Political Science Prof. Alexander
George, who accompanied Shultz on the
guitar, also sang several solos, including a

a rousing Georgian drinking song. The
approximately 75 audience members —
Rep. Tom Campbell, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and a sprinkling
of students among them — clapped
along.
Following the music medley and a
short introduction by Shultz, Shevard
nadze delivered a speech praising the
progress in foreign policy since the intro
duction of Gorbachev's reforms in 1985
and outlining some of the difficulties the
Soviet Union is now facing.
The speech was an abridged version of
one he gave Friday night at the San Fran
cisco Marriott Hotel.
Speaking through a translator, She

vardnadze began by citing the "human
factor" as the basis for improved Soviet-
American relations. He confirmed
Shultz's assertion that, by forging a close
friendship, the two men had created an
atmosphere conducive to cooperation.
Shevardnadze, who assumed his post
in July 1985 with little prior foreign ser
vice experience, highlighted his initial dif
ficulties in office. Regarding weapons and
disarmament, he said, "I had never stud
ied these things before."
"I was a mere lightweight compared
with Shultz," said Shevardnadze in his
Friday speech. The Soviet diplomat
recalled how, at their first meeting, he
told Shultz, "You have experience, but we

have the truth on our side."
Shevardnadze added, "George under
stood he was dealing with inexperience,
and replied, 'I won't comment on this
statement.' "
During their tenure, the diplomats
worked to dispel their respective coun
tries' enemy images of one another. She
vardnadze said he was relieved that the
days when the United States viewed the
Soviet Union as the "evil empire" and the
Soviet Union perceived the United States
as "the center of world imperialism" have
come to an end.
On Friday, Shevardnadze called pere
stroika a "true revolution," responsible
for "civilizing the Soviet Union." He said

the "Soviet person has become a free indi
vidual" and the country now has free
speech, free press, freedom of conscience
and an emerging parliamentary system.
"Changes in the Soviet Union are of
highest priority to the Soviets and to all
people worldwide," asserted Shevard
nadze. He said that had it not been for
Soviet reforms, the Eastern European
countries would not be free and Germany
would not have unified.
The decision not to intervene in East
ern Europe was not motivated by "class
principles, not by the Brezhnev Doctrine,
but by principles of absolute free choice
for every country, every people,"
he added.
In his Friday speech, the diplo
mat made the applause-evoking
assertion: "I'm sure our troops
will never again cross the bound
ary of our country again."
Shevardnadze stressed the
need to build a "new world order"
based on common interests such
as improving the environment,
ensuring worldwide military
security and forging closer eco
nomic ties. "As a family, we can
solve problems," he said.
The entrenched military
nature of Soviet society makes a
"revolution in people's thinking
most difficult of all," Shevard
nadze said Saturday. He stressed
the need to counter the conserva
tives, those unwilling to make the
transition to a market economy.
Shevardnadze said the political
situation in the Soviet Union has
improved since last December,
when he resigned and voiced his
fears that a dictatorship was lurk
ing.
The dynamic diplomat con
cluded his Hoover speech, "Long
live freedom and democracy!"
