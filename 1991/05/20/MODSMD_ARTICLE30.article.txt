# Conference crowns
## Four Stanford athletes emerge victorious at Pac-10 Championships 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — Four Cardinal ath
letes won titles as Stanford's best bat
tled for league supremacy at the 1991
Pacific 10 Conference Track and Field
Championships.
The meet opened Saturday with
some key showdowns in the long jump
competitions.
One of the first events at Sun Angel
Stadium was the women's long jump.
Stanford star Jackie Edwards, who has
an NCAA Championships qualifying
mark of 21 feet, 2V* inches, faced
UCLA's Tonya Sedwick, who has
jumped 21 feet, two and V* inches this
year to lead the Pac-10.
Earlier in the week Sedwick won the
heptathlon and, less than an hour from
starting the long jump, qualified for the
100-meter hurdles final.
Each jumper got three leaps in the
preliminaries. The top eight jumpers
advanced to the finals where they got
three more jumps. Leaps in the prelims
counted in the final standings.
With that in mind Edwards soared 21
feet, */ inches on her first jump, putting
the pressure on the rest of the field.
According to Bob Kersee, coach of the
UCLA women, the message this sent to
the competition was, "This is the mark.
If you can't make it, get off the field."
No one else was able to clear 20 feet
on the rest of the preliminary jumps.
Stanford's Alysia Hubbard made the
final cut as did Sedwick, after fouling
her first two jumps.
With Edwards jumping last in the
finals and having two events on Sunday,
the Stanford coaches decided to have
Edwards pass her fifth jump. It proved
costly as Sedwick leaped 21 feet, 3
inches on her sixth and last jump.
"I knew she could do it. I wasn't sur
prised," Edwards said.
Edwards had one last shot to win but
could only muster 20 feet, 6 inches.
Edwards took second, Hubbard fifth.
The fifth jump also proved critical in
the men's long jump, the last event of
the evening to finish. In the finals, Stan
ford's Marcus Hickerson faced stiff chal
lenges from Washington State's George
Ogbeide and California's Chris Huffins.
On his fifth leap, Hickerson sailed 26
feet, V* inch. Ogbeide and Huffins still
had two attempts left. At Big Meet, after
Hickerson had set an identical mark,
Huffins had jumped 26 feet one and V*
inches — tops in the conference.
But this time Hickerson's lead was

'The pace was slow. At 300 [meters out] I could see
everyone start to move so I slowly moved down the
back straight. Everybody just kept coming. I just said,
"Goodbye. I've got to go now." I just gave it the ham
mers. It gave me confidence ...'

permanent. He jubilantly pumped his
arms in the air as Huffins' final distance
was posted, 25 feet, 10 inches. Stan
ford's first 1991 Pac-10 champion was
crowned.
Afterwards Hickerson said he wasn't
worried about Huffins passing him on
his last jump.
"I didn't think it was as far as it was.
I was more worried about Ogbeide. He
fset personal bests] three times."
On Sunday three more Cardinal Pac
-10 champions were crowned, two of
them defending titles won in 1990.
While warming up for the triple
jump, conference leader Jackie Edwards
hurt her leg. On the first hop she was
landing on the long jump take-off board.
"It just hurt my leg when I hit that
board. The pain ran from my foot
straight up my back," Edwards said.
She was able to shake it off and
started the triple jump like she had the
long, with a huge opening leap. She
jumped 41 feet, 2 inches — farther by a
foot and a half than anyone else in the
field had leaped all year.
Unlike her advantage in the long
jump, this lead held. On her last attempt
she extended her winning margin by 6
more inches.
"I really didn't expect too much com
petition," Edwards said.
Also performing well in the triple
jump was freshman Dana Weeks. Tak
ing a cue from Edwards she began the
competition with a strong jump, 39 feet,
6 inches. That leap earned her fourth
place.
Chryste Gaines defended her 100-
meter title, tying her personal best of
11.28 seconds.
"I was mad. I just ran. I didn't think
at all," Gaines said. She was angry
about the women's 4xloo finish. The
Cardinal squad placed fifth in a race
they had hoped to win.
The 200 showdown between Gaines
and NCAA 400-meter champion Maicel
Malone was won by Malone. Gaines
placed second. "I lost the race myself,"
Gaines said.

"I saw her beside me and I tightened
up. I mentally tightened up and then
everything else wouldn't function. I'm
not used to that kind of competition."
Gaines expects more practice in the
200 to help get her times down. "It's not
like the 100. I have to run it over and
over to get used to it," Gaines said.
The fourth Stanford athlete to get
tops in the conference was Dave Strang.
He defended his 1990 800-meter title
with a close 1:49.96.
"The pace was slow. At 300 [meters
outl I could see everyone start to move
so I slowly moved down the back
straight," Strang said. "Everybody just
kept coming. I just said, 'Goodbye. I've
got to go now.'
"I kicked at 200 out. I just gave it the
hammers." Strang was especially
pleased with his kick. "It gave me confi
dence that I have one. I haven't had one
for a while."
The faceoffs Stanford expected in
several races didn't materialize. Mark
Mastalir had a chance against Washing
ton State's Samuel Kibiri in the 1,500.
Mastalir started his kick at 500 meters
out and took the lead but couldn't hold
it and finished fourth. Chris Rae placed
fifth.
Melanie Bloch, the 1990 1,500 cham
pion, wasn't able to challenge Arizona's
Bridget Smyth. Bloch had to pull out
with back problems while Smyth went
on to win.
In the team competition, the Stan
ford men finished eighth with 30 points.
Washington State won with a 135.66
total. Scoring points for the Cardinal
with fifth-place finishes were James
Cramton in the 400 and Dave Scud
amore in the 10,000.
On the women's side, Stanford tied
for fourth with Arizona. Both teams had
54 points. Oregon won the meet. More
scorers for the Cardinal were Debbie
Malueg, who placed sixth in the discus,
and Rhonda Oliver, who finished sixth
in the 400. The 4x400 squad also placed
sixth.

Afterwards Hickerson said he wasn't
worried about Huffins passing him on
his last jump.
"I didn't think it was as far as it was.
I was more worried about Ogbeide. He
fset personal bests] three times."
On Sunday three more Cardinal Pac
-10 champions were crowned, two of
them defending titles won in 1990.
While warming up for the triple
jump, conference leader Jackie Edwards
hurt her leg. On the first hop she was
landing on the long jump take-off board.
"It just hurt my leg when I hit that
board. The pain ran from my foot
straight up my back," Edwards said.
She was able to shake it off and
started the triple jump like she had the
long, with a huge opening leap. She
jumped 41 feet, 2 inches — farther by a
foot and a half than anyone else in the
field had leaped all year.
Unlike her advantage in the long
jump, this lead held. On her last attempt
she extended her winning margin by 6
more inches.
"I really didn't expect too much com
petition," Edwards said.
Also performing well in the triple
jump was freshman Dana Weeks. Tak
ing a cue from Edwards she began the
competition with a strong jump, 39 feet,
6 inches. That leap earned her fourth
place.
Chryste Gaines defended her 100-
meter title, tying her personal best of
11.28 seconds.
"I was mad. I just ran. I didn't think
at all," Gaines said. She was angry
about the women's 4xloo finish. The
Cardinal squad placed fifth in a race
they had hoped to win.
The 200 showdown between Gaines
and NCAA 400-meter champion Maicel
Malone was won by Malone. Gaines
placed second. "I lost the race myself,"
Gaines said.

"I saw her beside me and I tightened
up. I mentally tightened up and then
everything else wouldn't function. I'm
not used to that kind of competition."
Gaines expects more practice in the
200 to help get her times down. "It's not
like the 100. I have to run it over and
over to get used to it," Gaines said.
The fourth Stanford athlete to get
tops in the conference was Dave Strang.
He defended his 1990 800-meter title
with a close 1:49.96.
"The pace was slow. At 300 [meters
outl I could see everyone start to move
so I slowly moved down the back
straight," Strang said. "Everybody just
kept coming. I just said, 'Goodbye. I've
got to go now.'
"I kicked at 200 out. I just gave it the
hammers." Strang was especially
pleased with his kick. "It gave me confi
dence that I have one. I haven't had one
for a while."
The faceoffs Stanford expected in
several races didn't materialize. Mark
Mastalir had a chance against Washing
ton State's Samuel Kibiri in the 1,500.
Mastalir started his kick at 500 meters
out and took the lead but couldn't hold
it and finished fourth. Chris Rae placed
fifth.
Melanie Bloch, the 1990 1,500 cham
pion, wasn't able to challenge Arizona's
Bridget Smyth. Bloch had to pull out
with back problems while Smyth went
on to win.
In the team competition, the Stan
ford men finished eighth with 30 points.
Washington State won with a 135.66
total. Scoring points for the Cardinal
with fifth-place finishes were James
Cramton in the 400 and Dave Scud
amore in the 10,000.
On the women's side, Stanford tied
for fourth with Arizona. Both teams had
54 points. Oregon won the meet. More
scorers for the Cardinal were Debbie
Malueg, who placed sixth in the discus,
and Rhonda Oliver, who finished sixth
in the 400. The 4x400 squad also placed
sixth.
TEMPE, Ariz. — Four Cardinal ath
letes won titles as Stanford's best bat
tled for league supremacy at the 1991
Pacific 10 Conference Track and Field
Championships.
The meet opened Saturday with
some key showdowns in the long jump
competitions.
One of the first events at Sun Angel
Stadium was the women's long jump.
Stanford star Jackie Edwards, who has
an NCAA Championships qualifying
mark of 21 feet, 2V* inches, faced
UCLA's Tonya Sedwick, who has
jumped 21 feet, two and V* inches this
year to lead the Pac-10.
Earlier in the week Sedwick won the
heptathlon and, less than an hour from
starting the long jump, qualified for the
100-meter hurdles final.
Each jumper got three leaps in the
preliminaries. The top eight jumpers
advanced to the finals where they got
three more jumps. Leaps in the prelims
counted in the final standings.
With that in mind Edwards soared 21
feet, */ inches on her first jump, putting
the pressure on the rest of the field.
According to Bob Kersee, coach of the
UCLA women, the message this sent to
the competition was, "This is the mark.
If you can't make it, get off the field."
No one else was able to clear 20 feet
on the rest of the preliminary jumps.
Stanford's Alysia Hubbard made the
final cut as did Sedwick, after fouling
her first two jumps.
With Edwards jumping last in the
finals and having two events on Sunday,
the Stanford coaches decided to have
Edwards pass her fifth jump. It proved
costly as Sedwick leaped 21 feet, 3
inches on her sixth and last jump.
"I knew she could do it. I wasn't sur
prised," Edwards said.
Edwards had one last shot to win but
could only muster 20 feet, 6 inches.
Edwards took second, Hubbard fifth.
The fifth jump also proved critical in
the men's long jump, the last event of
the evening to finish. In the finals, Stan
ford's Marcus Hickerson faced stiff chal
lenges from Washington State's George
Ogbeide and California's Chris Huffins.
On his fifth leap, Hickerson sailed 26
feet, V* inch. Ogbeide and Huffins still
had two attempts left. At Big Meet, after
Hickerson had set an identical mark,
Huffins had jumped 26 feet one and V*
inches — tops in the conference.
But this time Hickerson's lead was

'The pace was slow. At 300 [meters out] I could see
everyone start to move so I slowly moved down the
back straight. Everybody just kept coming. I just said,
"Goodbye. I've got to go now." I just gave it the ham
mers. It gave me confidence ...'

permanent. He jubilantly pumped his
arms in the air as Huffins' final distance
was posted, 25 feet, 10 inches. Stan
ford's first 1991 Pac-10 champion was
crowned.
Afterwards Hickerson said he wasn't
worried about Huffins passing him on
his last jump.
"I didn't think it was as far as it was.
