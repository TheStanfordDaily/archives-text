# Crews close at Pac Coasts
## Women push Huskies in prelim, wind up fifth 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Considering all the problems
that the women's varsity crew
team has overcome this season,
it seems quite an accomplish
ment that they were even m the
running for hardware this
weekend at the Pacific Coast
Rowing Championships.
A fifth-place finish yesterday
afternoon was quite respectable
for a team that has really only
come together in the last two or
three weeks.
In the preliminary heat, the
Cardinal, with nothing to lose,
went head to head with a power
ful pack of Washington Huskies.
They pushed Washington all the
way, coming within 2.5 seconds.
M I told them to make sure
[Washington! earns it," said
varsity coach John Davis. "They
gave it their best shot."
Unfortunately, this valiant
effort probably cost the Cardi
nal a fourth-place finish in the
finals to a strong, but beatable
squad from UC-Santa Barbara.

"The prelims were a real con
fidence booster but the girls
paid a high price," Davis said.
They were real tired on Sun
day. Their legs were just shot,
they just couldn't do it."
The tough preliminaries may
have had an effect on Washing
ton's performance in the finals
as well. The second seeded
Huskies fell to the third ranked
California Golden Bears, while
UCLA beat everyone quite
soundly.
These faster teams had a leg
up on the Cardinal from the
beginning. 44 1 told the girls that
you can't go out and expect to
beat these teams everyday,"
Davis explained.
"You can't slow others down,
you can only speed yourself up. I
think it's nice for the varsity to
know that they were in the
hunt, they're a good crew.
Everyone in the boathouse
thinks real highly of them."
The varsity four-man boat
made a great effort as well. The
Cardinal's 9th through 12th
rowers faced off against Wash

ington State's and Santa Clara's
top four rowers. Stanford was
neck and neck with Santa Clara
until the very end when the
Broncos edged over the finish
line to catch second place.
The novice eight had a great
heat but finished third in the
finals behind Washington and
UCLA. "They rowed with a lot
of guts and spirit," Davis said.
The second novice eight had
a very disappointing finish.
After leading for the entire race,
they lost the lead to California
on the second to last stroke.
"They had a tremendous effort;
it was the best race of the day,"
Davis said. "We've got a good
squad moving up."
The retiring coach had noth
ing but praise and high hopes
for his team. "Whoever's coach
ing has got a great group of kids.
They gave everything they had.
And there are only three of 12
varsity girls graduating."
The nationwide search for a
coach is not over, although
resumes are pouring in every
day, according to Davis.
