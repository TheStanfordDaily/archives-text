# Junior varsity, freshman eights finish strong
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Staff writer 
Although the younger squads
made terrific showings, the var
sity men's crew team did not
quite meet all of their expecta
tions at the Pacific Coast Row
ing Championships in Sacra
mento this weekend.
The junior varsity and fresh
men eight-man boats each cap
tured third-place finishes.
According to split times, the JV
did the last 500 meters faster
than any of the other shells in
Sunday's final.
"The JV stuck it out from the
start," said team captain Tom
Beischer. "The others were sur
prised to have Stanford in there.
The JV walked through a bunch
of other boats." The Cardinal
finished within three seconds of
the winner, California.
The freshmen eight-man also
lost to the Golden Bears,

although they had a strong race.
Unfortunately, the varsity
boats did not fare so well. The
four-man shell looked strong
when it won its heat. Some very
stiff competition in the finals
left the Cardinal with a fifth
place finish.
The eight-man varsity boat
had a similar experience. After a
second-place finish to Washing
ton in the preliminaries, Stan
ford was only 5-6 seconds back
and they were confident that
they could pull out a victory.
"It's hard to tell anything
from the qualifying heat
because teams only pull hard
enough to do just that," Beis
cher said. "We felt like we were
right in there, compared to oth
era.
However, when they took off
Sunday, Washington set a much
faster pace than the Stanford
men were used to rowing. "We
settled down higher than we

had and decided to stick with
them early," Beischer said.
This strategy worked for the
first 800 but then the Huskies
ran away with the race. "We had
a good last 300, but by then it
was too late," said a disap
pointed Beischer. "The middle
was our downfall; usually it's
our strength."
Although their fifth-place
finish was not anything to write
home about, they did improve
their times. "We should've been
up there higher, but we did
rewrite our fastest times," Beis
cher said.
Since he is a senior, this
weekend was a bit disappoint
ing, but Beischer was heartened
by the top performances of his
younger teammates. "It is
encouraging to see the bronzes.
The team has got some real
power coming up, a lot of young
strength."
