Award for Service tonight.
The recipients for spring quar
ter are graduate student David
Bradfute, seniors Cory Booker,
Gared Jones and John Wagner,
junior Angela Hilton, sophomore

teach-in after the Persian Gulf
war began.
The award was created in 1981
by then-Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, who retired last
year, to recognize and applaud
students' contributions to a vari
ety of clubs, departments and
community projects.
Recipients are selected each
quarter based on nominations
from faculty, staff and students.
Bradfute, a biological sciences
graduate student, received the
award for his role in championing

Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
Andrew Lisac, assistant dean of
the summer session and Continu
ing Studies, who nominated Brad
fute, said, "The reason I nomi
nated David is because of his per
sonality. He's a real delight to
work with."
Lisac added that Bradfute is
"intensively consultative. He
spoke to every administrator who
has anything to do with the issue.
[He's) a real model of student
activism."
Booker, a member of the Senior
Class Presidents, was awarded for
his service to several communi
ties. He is a tight end on the foot
ball team, a counselor at The
Bridge and an academic and ath
letic tutor in East Palo Alto.
He said he wished others
involved in public service who are
not as "high-profile" as he is could
also be recognized.
"I feel like I'm accepting on
behalf of all the people I've
worked with and who are just as
deserving as I am," he said.
Chen, a sophomore majoring in
civil engineering, received the
award for organizing the Alterna

students.

something very important and
had fun doing it,"he said.
An award was given to Hilton,
a junior majoring in American
studies, for the links she forged
between campus black student
organizations and community
youth agencies, the "college days"
she arranged that brought hun
dreds of local high school students
to campus, and her leadership at
the Black House.
"I was kind of surprised to get
the award [sincel this was the first
year I was heavily involved [in
public service]," Hilton said. She
added that next year she plans to
be even more involved.
Jones, a senior human biology
major, received an award for his
support of Stanford fraternity life,
multicultural education and com
munity service. Jones is a member
and the resident assistant of
Kappa Sigma, and as a represen
tative of all the RAs in housed fra

ternities, he is responsible for a lot

did more than I should have. ... I
felt very dedicated to the [Stan

Wagner, a senior mqjoring in
political science, received an
award for his reporting of the
indirect-cost controversy for The

Kathy O'Toole, a writer for
Stanford News Service who nomi

did a very professional job report

lot of veteran reporters have trou
ble covering."
A former editor-in-chief of The
Daily, Wagner was one of three
former Daily editors who were
given a Dean's Award for Service
last spring.
The students involved in orga
nizing the teach-in on the Persian
Gulf received the award as a
group "for their quick recognition
that Stanford needed a teach-in
on the Gulf crisis and their ability
to mobilize and focus the energies
of teachers and learners all across
the campus," according to the
award.
Graham Boyd, one of the stu
dent organizers, said, "I think it's
very appropriate that the award
be given to the entire group â€” a
lot of people that came together at
the same time."
The awards will be presented
tonight at Elliott Program Center.
