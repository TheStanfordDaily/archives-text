# Abuse of women focus of conference
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Forty women from countries as distant as
Fiji and Thailand and as disparate as Trinidad
and Taiwan gathered in the Bay Area this
weekend to discuss a common interest they
wish didn't exist.
The participants — 25 grassroots leaders
from the Third World and 15 from North
America — have been taking part in a 10-day
conference, which began May 10, called "Lead
ing the Way Out: a gathering of women work
ing to end violence against women."
This weekend's program, which culminated
in an open forum in Cubberley Auditorium on
Saturday, aimed at ending the silence that
enshrouds one of the most pervasive global
violations of human rights.
Organized by two local institutions, the
Global Fund for Women and the Shaler Adams
Foundation — both of which fund develop
ment projects in Third World countries — in
conjunction with the Haas Public Service Cen
ter, the program focused on grassroots strate
gies for assisting women — especially women
of color — in Third World nations and North
America.
"There are two issues that unify

women worldwide. One is reproductive rights
and the other is violence against women," said
Anne Murray, president of the Global Fund for
Women, one of the organizations that spon
sored the conference.
But, Murray noted, "While reproductive
rights are on the national agenda of many
countries, violence against women is not."
During the past week, the foreign women
joined their American counterparts in visits to
rape crisis centers and support groups
throughout California to observe methods
used to aid women who are victims of physical
or sexual abuse.
Many of the participants said they work in
near-isolation in their home countries, unsup
ported by their governments and cut off from
others doing similar work.
"Violence against women is such a silent
issue," said Sonti Maseko, a South African
journalist active in People Opposing Women
Abuse, a counseling and advocacy group in
Johannesburg.
"As a black South African, I used to think
my suffering was so great," said Maseko in a
speech Saturday afternoon. But she said that
by the end of the conference she felt a great
sense of solidarity with the other participants
and was amazed by "her ability to connect."

Eman Kandaloff also made a powerful
delivery, describing the plight of the Arab
women she works with as coordinator of the
Palestinian Outreach Project at the Haifa
Rape Crisis Center, the only rape crisis pro
gram serving Arab women in Israel.
Family honor is very important in Arab
families, said Kandaloff, and an unmarried
woman's virginity is inextricably tied with this
honor.
If an Arab woman is raped and she tells her
family, they may kill her or marry her to her
rapist in order to regain their family honor.
Ninety percent of the women assisted by
the Haifa center are victims of incest, Kan
daloff said, and most are less concerned with
mental abuse than with obtaining reconstruc
tive surgery for replacement of the hymen, so
they can retain the semblance of virginity.
Most participants found the conference
helpful. Said Claire Gittens, coordinator of the
Rape Crisis Center in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad,
"It's really helped us to network . . . and to
show us wherever our programs are deficient."
And Debbie Lee, a founding member of San
Francisco's Family Violence Project, said she
has realized that American programs are also
deficient in meeting the needs of women of
color.
