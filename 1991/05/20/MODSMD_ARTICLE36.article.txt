# Campus leaders discuss service
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Campus leaders joined
together Friday afternoon for
an off-campus public service
retreat.
About 50 representatives
from organizations as diverse
as the Catholic Community,
Interfraternity Council, Dis
ability Resource Center, ASSU
Senate and various ethnic com
munity centers met for four
hours in small groups to dis
cuss public service, said sopho
more Felix Tsai, one of the
retreat's organizers.
The discussions were bro
ken up into two areas â€” the
philosophies of service and of
cross-cultural understanding,
and the role of public and com
munity service in educational
curriculums, Tsai said.
Various administrators and
campus leaders acted as facili
tators for the discussions,
including Michael Jackson,
associate dean of student
affairs; Catherine Milton,
director of the Haas Public Ser
vice Center; and Goodwin Liu,
a member of the outgoing
Council of Presidents.
"The retreat opened up a
much-needed dialogue that will
facilitate service projects next
year," said Liu, a senior.

Tsai said three groups "with
specific goals" were established
at the retreat. One group will
compile a directory of Stanford
service organizations, another
will meet this week to begin
considering how to integrate
service into the Stanford cur
riculum and a third group will
plan a follow-up meeting next
year, he added.
But the best follow-up will
come from what each individ
ual does with the knowledge
gained from the discussions,
Liu said.
"What needs to happen is
that everybody there has a
responsibility to take what
they learned back to the orga
nizations they represent," Liu
said.
People who attended the
retreat agreed that it was a
productive session.
"Channels of communica
tion for the future were cre
ated," said COP-elect member
John Louie. "My only regret
was that it was too short."
Tsai and Liu agreed that the
retreat was a "tremendous suc
cess."
"It was a good event and was
very inspiring," Liu said. "Any
time you bring together a
group of people with the inten
tion of facilitating public ser
vice, something good is bound
to happen."
