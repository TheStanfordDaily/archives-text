# Malcolm X activities wrapped up by singer

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Chuck D., the lead rapper and
lyricist for the music group Public
Enemy, assessed the state of social
and economic conditions of blacks
in the 1990s before a packed
Kresge Auditorium audience Fri
day.
More than 600 people gathered
to hear Chuck D.'s bitter, some
times vulgar, social message that
also touched on the origins of
modern rap music and the birth of
Public Enemy.
The speech was the keynote
event for Malcolm X Week, an
annual event organized by the
Black Student Union to commem
orate the life and legacy of the
black civil rights leader.
"If we as a black people do the
right thing, we'll be OK,"' Chuck
D. told the multi-ethnic audience.
"We have to work on positive con
tributions to the black community
and get out useful information to
the black community."
Part of the dissemination of
useful information has come
through the medium of rap music,

a brand of fiery social commen
tary set to music that unifies
blacks in cities throughout the
land, Chuck D. said.
Issues germane to black Amer
icans — from police brutality and
lack of father figures to crack
cocaine and materialism — are
either neglected or misrepre
sented by the white-run media,
which misrepresent blacks, the
rapper said.
"When we write songs, it is to
let people know what is happening
in the community. I decided to
write rap music to get certain
things done. It is my responsibil
ity to do what I can to improve the
community."
Chuck D. said the message in
his group's music is often misin
terpreted by the same white
media institutions.
"Life is hard and white
supremacy is hard," he said. "In
our songs we are not saying to
beat the cops . . . but if they have a
foot in your face for no reason,
you have got to get that foot off."
"We have to share what we
have and work together," he said.
"No one else is looking out for us."
