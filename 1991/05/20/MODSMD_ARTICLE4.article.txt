# Flick reflects junior's real life experiences
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
On Sunday evenings, paper
toting students converge on
Memorial Auditorium for purely
non-academic purposes: paper
fights and Flicks.
But at last week's showing of
"Edward Scissorhands" — a
movie depicting society's accep
tance, exploitation and eventual
rejection of a man-like robot with
scissors for hands — one Stanford
student left his paper at home. He
wanted to bring hooks instead —
to get a message across.
"People look at this movie and
think it is a fairy tale," explained
junior Mark Breimhorst, a com
parative literature who has
no hands, his arms extending only
to the wrists.
"For me it is not a fairy tale.
This movie is about me. My life. I
thought of bringing my hooks to
show people there are actually

people out there like Edward."
Breimhorst did not bring the
hooks to the movie. But the mes
sage he wanted to send is one
some have pointed to as an under
lying theme of the film: the plight
of the disabled and other stigma
tized groups in a society that
places them on the fringe.
In the movie, Edward is thrust
into white, middle-class suburbia
with pastel-colored homes and
busybody residents. Accepted by
some, scorned by others, Edward
is treated as an abnormal freak
and novelty by all.
Art imitates life. Breimhorst
said his 21 years have nearly par
alleled the life of the fictional
Edward.
Up to the age of 14, Breimhorst
wore prosthetic plastic sockets
with hooks on the ends. He found
the hooks made it difficult to
interact with people and eventu-
ally stopped wearing them. People's
reactions toward Breimhorst remained
the same, hooks or no hooks, he said.
"The way people treated me when
they saw I didn't have hands was so
close to the way they treated Edward in
the movie I had to laugh," Breimhorst
said.
The bespectacled Breimhorst became
the brunt of jokes and the target of pity
ing stares. Some people said God
couldn't help him and said they were
sorry he had no hands. The brash criti
cized Breimhorst's parents for letting
him out in public. "They said I should
have been locked up," Breimhorst
recalled.
At Stanford, people have been less
cruel and treated him with more
respect. But the painful stabs of dis
crimination and devaluation from the
past still haunt him. "It is hard when
people are not willing to accept me as I
am," he said, his blond ponytail creep
ing over his shoulder.
Breimhorst, like Edward, has grown

in the struggle against the societal
forces that make it hard for people to
accept him as an individual.
"Edward challenged society by say
ing that their ideals are misplaced. He
showed us that society should be
focused on the individual, respecting
them for who they are."
If he could get hands, Breimhorst
wouldn't want them, he said. He added
that he has learned much by not having
hands and built character untold. He
has become resourceful and creative,
proud and sensitive.
"How else could I have survived?" he
asked.
But Breimhorst has not just sur
vived, he has excelled — and not in spite
of his disability. He has become an elo
quent spokesperson for Stanford's dis
abled community.
Edward, through his ornate garden
sculptures, haircuts and ice figures, all
cut with his scissor-hands, showed that
a person without human hands can be a
contributor to society and the human
experience. Breimhorst calls Edward's
skills an allegory for the value of differ
ence.
In real life, Breimhorst admits, peo
ple may not recognize that value.
"People have shunned me when they

could have become good friends," he
said. Although women come to him as a
leaning post and a spiritual source,
physical relationships remain elusive,
he added.
Edward could sing a similar swan
song. In the movie, his own love inter
est, Kim, cannot fully love him because
of society's disapproval of a man with
scissors for hands. Ultimately Edward
must live in isolation in a mountaintop
mansion, ostracized from society.
Breimhorst said the movie's ending
sounds a sad note for society's ability to
embrace people who are different.
"It says that society is fundamentally
not going to accept someone like me.
People have to realize that I am not just
a person with a disability that does nor
mal things, but that it can be normal to
have a disability."
It is a view, he added, that is applica
ble not only to people with disabilities
but all people outside the rubric of soci
etal "normalcy," including people of
color and gays and lesbians.
"My way of life may be different from
a person in a wheelchair, but we are
similar," Breimhorst said. "The world
was not made for people in wheelchairs.
It was not made for people without
hands."

thought of bringing my hooks (to Flicks) to show people there are actually people out
there like Edward."
On Sunday evenings, paper
toting students converge on
Memorial Auditorium for purely
non-academic purposes: paper
fights and Flicks.
But at last week's showing of
"Edward Scissorhands" — a
movie depicting society's accep
tance, exploitation and eventual
rejection of a man-like robot with
scissors for hands — one Stanford
student left his paper at home. He
wanted to bring hooks instead —
to get a message across.
"People look at this movie and
think it is a fairy tale," explained
junior Mark Breimhorst, a com
parative literature who has
no hands, his arms extending only
to the wrists.
"For me it is not a fairy tale.
This movie is about me. My life. I
thought of bringing my hooks to
show people there are actually

people out there like Edward."
Breimhorst did not bring the
hooks to the movie. But the mes
sage he wanted to send is one
some have pointed to as an under
lying theme of the film: the plight
of the disabled and other stigma
tized groups in a society that
places them on the fringe.
In the movie, Edward is thrust
into white, middle-class suburbia
with pastel-colored homes and
busybody residents. Accepted by
some, scorned by others, Edward
is treated as an abnormal freak
and novelty by all.
Art imitates life. Breimhorst
said his 21 years have nearly par
alleled the life of the fictional
Edward.
Up to the age of 14, Breimhorst
wore prosthetic plastic sockets
with hooks on the ends. He found
the hooks made it difficult to
interact with people and eventu-
ally stopped wearing them. People's
reactions toward Breimhorst remained
the same, hooks or no hooks, he said.
"The way people treated me when
they saw I didn't have hands was so
close to the way they treated Edward in
the movie I had to laugh," Breimhorst
said.
The bespectacled Breimhorst became
the brunt of jokes and the target of pity
ing stares. Some people said God
couldn't help him and said they were
sorry he had no hands. The brash criti
cized Breimhorst's parents for letting
him out in public. "They said I should
have been locked up," Breimhorst
recalled.
At Stanford, people have been less
cruel and treated him with more
respect. But the painful stabs of dis
crimination and devaluation from the
past still haunt him. "It is hard when
people are not willing to accept me as I
am," he said, his blond ponytail creep
ing over his shoulder.
Breimhorst, like Edward, has grown

in the struggle against the societal
forces that make it hard for people to
accept him as an individual.
"Edward challenged society by say
ing that their ideals are misplaced. He
showed us that society should be
focused on the individual, respecting
them for who they are."
If he could get hands, Breimhorst
wouldn't want them, he said. He added
that he has learned much by not having
hands and built character untold. He
has become resourceful and creative,
proud and sensitive.
"How else could I have survived?" he
asked.
But Breimhorst has not just sur
vived, he has excelled — and not in spite
of his disability. He has become an elo
quent spokesperson for Stanford's dis
abled community.
Edward, through his ornate garden
sculptures, haircuts and ice figures, all
cut with his scissor-hands, showed that
a person without human hands can be a
contributor to society and the human
experience. Breimhorst calls Edward's
skills an allegory for the value of differ
ence.
In real life, Breimhorst admits, peo
ple may not recognize that value.
"People have shunned me when they

could have become good friends," he
said. Although women come to him as a
leaning post and a spiritual source,
physical relationships remain elusive,
he added.
Edward could sing a similar swan
song. In the movie, his own love inter
est, Kim, cannot fully love him because
of society's disapproval of a man with
scissors for hands. Ultimately Edward
must live in isolation in a mountaintop
mansion, ostracized from society.
Breimhorst said the movie's ending
sounds a sad note for society's ability to
embrace people who are different.
"It says that society is fundamentally
not going to accept someone like me.
People have to realize that I am not just
a person with a disability that does nor
mal things, but that it can be normal to
have a disability."
It is a view, he added, that is applica
ble not only to people with disabilities
but all people outside the rubric of soci
etal "normalcy," including people of
color and gays and lesbians.
"My way of life may be different from
a person in a wheelchair, but we are
similar," Breimhorst said. "The world
was not made for people in wheelchairs.
It was not made for people without
hands."
