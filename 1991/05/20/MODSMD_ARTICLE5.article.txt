# New dean sees self above all as educator
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
In 1964, Michael Jackson was the first black
student to enter Robert Louis Stevenson School,
an upper-class, private high school in Pebble
Beach, Calif.
It was a formative experience for Jackson, who
attended the expensive school on a scholarship.
During his years there, he learned many of the
fundamental values that have guided his life and
will help shape how he approaches his new job as
Stanford's dean of students.
"It exposed me to a world of wealth and power
and privilege that I had never really known
about," Jackson says."I learned a lot about
myself, and I learned how to get along with people
of all different races and backgrounds. And it let
me know that if I was going to compete in this
society with people who had more resources than
I did, I had to work twice as hard."
Hard work is something that Jackson has
thrived upon. He graduated from Stanford in
1972 with a degree in anthropology, then went to
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to
receive his master's and doctorate in educational
administration.

Michael Jackson, recently appointed the new dean of students, says he has had fun
as an educator. He hopes to bring some of that fun to his new job, especially
because the morale of staff and students may be at its lowest point in years.
