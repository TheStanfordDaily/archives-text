# New dean sees self above all as educator
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
In 1964, Michael Jackson was the first black
student to enter Robert Louis Stevenson School,
an upper-class, private high school in Pebble
Beach, Calif.
It was a formative experience for Jackson, who
attended the expensive school on a scholarship.
During his years there, he learned many of the
fundamental values that have guided his life and
will help shape how he approaches his new job as
Stanford's dean of students.
"It exposed me to a world of wealth and power
and privilege that I had never really known
about," Jackson says."I learned a lot about
myself, and I learned how to get along with people
of all different races and backgrounds. And it let
me know that if I was going to compete in this
society with people who had more resources than
I did, I had to work twice as hard."
Hard work is something that Jackson has
thrived upon. He graduated from Stanford in
1972 with a degree in anthropology, then went to
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to
receive his master's and doctorate in educational
administration.

Michael Jackson, recently appointed the new dean of students, says he has had fun
as an educator. He hopes to bring some of that fun to his new job, especially
because the morale of staff and students may be at its lowest point in years.
Returning to Stanford in 1980,
Jackson served first as assistant
director of the Row and fraternity
adviser, and later as assistant
director of the Overseas Studies
program and assistant to Provost
James Rosse.
From 1987 until last week,
when he was named dean of stu
dents, Jackson was an associate
dean of Student Affairs and direc
tor of Campus Affairs. In that
position, he supervised campus
organizations ranging from the
Asian American Activities Center
to KZSU and served on nearly 15
University committees. He will
take his new job at the beginning
of summer quarter.
Jackson credits his family for
much of his success. "If it weren't
for them, I would not be where I
am today," he says. A more recent
inspiration has been his new wife,
Diana Akiyama, associate dean of
Memorial Church. They were
married April 13.
In all of the positions he has
held at Stanford — and as the new
dean of students — Jackson says
he considers himself an educator

more than anything else.
"People in Student Affairs are
really educators in the cloaks of
professionals," Jackson says."In
everything we do, we try to work
with students in an educational
way — letting students take as
much responsibility as possible,
looking to students for problem
solving, looking for opportunities
for students to learn from their
experiences as much as possible."
But the 40-year old Jackson
also likes his role as an educator
for another reason. "It's fun," he
says. "We have an unbelievable
collection of cultures, creative
people and activities on this cam
pus."
Jackson says he hopes to bring
more of that sense of fun to his
new job, especially because the
morale of staff and students may
be at its lowest point in years.
Jackson wants his office to be
involved in helping the campus
recover from what he calls "the
earthquakes of the past 18
months — from Loma Prieta to
the budget cuts to the indirect
cost controversy."
"There's a sense that we've lost
some of that greatness," Jackson
says. "But we can recapture it;
there are a lot of positive things to
build on. We're a place on the

move, and we've got a great
incoming class of students. We
need to settle down as an institu
tion and get through it."
The budget cuts have had a
major effect on Student Affairs,
but Jackson believes in his ability
to deal with the problems.
"What it means is that I have
to work together with staff and
students to set new priorities,
given the financial shape we're
in,"he says. "We will have to
make some very difficult choices
about how we spend money. There
will have to be a lot of coopera
tion."
Jackson hopes to foster cooper
ation on another front: multicul
turalism. He says he thinks there
has been a one-sided treatment of
the issue, and he wants to see
more of a dialogue.
"We need to help people be
open and honest about their feel
ings," Jackson says. "A number of
people are interested in letting
students have discussions about
these issues. I'm concerned that
people are being lectured to —
they're not having a discussion."
There will be tension in these
issues, Jackson notes. "We
shouldn't shy away from that.
That would not be honest."

but Jackson believes in his ability
to deal with the problems.
"What it means is that I have
to work together with staff and
students to set new priorities,
given the financial shape we're
in,"he says. "We will have to
make some very difficult choices
about how we spend money. There
will have to be a lot of coopera
tion."
Jackson hopes to foster cooper
ation on another front: multicul
turalism. He says he thinks there
has been a one-sided treatment of
the issue, and he wants to see
more of a dialogue.
"We need to help people be
open and honest about their feel
ings," Jackson says. "A number of
people are interested in letting
students have discussions about
these issues. I'm concerned that
people are being lectured to —
they're not having a discussion."
There will be tension in these
issues, Jackson notes. "We
shouldn't shy away from that.
That would not be honest."
