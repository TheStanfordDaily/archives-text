Croatians vote on independence
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) — The people of
Croatia voted yesterday on whether their
republic should seek independence, and even
before the results were in the republic's presi
dent said Yugoslavia is finished as a nation.
Hundreds of people lined up at polling sta
tions in a light drizzle to vote on whether Croa
tia should remain part of Yugoslavia or seek
independence and form an association of
sovereign states with other like-minded
republics.
Polling stations were open from 7 a.m. to 6
p.m. (1 a.m. to noon EDT). Initial results are
expected early today.
Opinion polls have indicated that an over
whelming majority of Croatia's 5 million people
favor independence.
Cease-fire appears to hold
after commanders meet
LUANDA, Angola (AP) — The cease-fire in
Angola's 16-year civil war appeared to be hold
ing in the southern African nation yesterday
following a meeting between commanders of
government and U.S.-backed rebel troops.
The government's chief of operations, Col.
Higino Carneiro, and rebel chief of staff Gen.
Arlindo Pena met late Saturday on the out
skirts of the eastern town of Luena.
The city, capital of Moxico province, had
been the scene of heavy fighting from April 1
until last week.
Although both sides have confirmed that
minor clashes have occurred since the cease
fire took effect, they said the incidents did not
threaten the truce.
Government and rebel leaders are to sign
the peace accords, which will establish a multi
party system in Angola, in Portugal on May 31
and free elections are to be held by the end of
next year.
No casualties after 1,200
Japanese evacuate their homes
TOKYO (AP) — More than 1,200 people
were evacuated from their homes yesterday as
torrential rains swept volcanic debris down a
river.
Police said two bridges were washed away
but no casualties were reported in towns along
the Mizunashi River, about 610 miles south
west of Tokyo.
Rain water cascading down a nearby 4,485-
foot volcano, Mount Unzendake, which erupted
Nov. 17 for the first time in 198 years and again
on Feb. 12, picked up volcanic ash. The result
ing debris swept down rocks, including one as
big as 13 feet in diameter, a police official said.
Experts have warned local residents the vol
cano is expected to erupt again.
NYSE wants longer hours
WASHINGTON (AP) — Like the wall that
once guarded Wall Street or the business hours
that bankers once kept, the set trading hours of
the New York Stock Exchange may soon be just
a memory.
The nation's largest stock exchange wants
to begin after-hours trading sessions and the
Securities and Exchange Commission is sched
uled to discuss the matter today.
Founded by gentleman brokers under a but
tonwood tree when George Washington was
president, the NYSE has jealously guarded its
auction-style trading system.
Now the Big Board — another term left over
from a technologically simpler era — will be
cautiously stepping into the push-button age
with trading hours extended an hour beyond
the normal 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. EDT session.
The move is part of a wider plan to recapture
lost business and prevent further erosion of its
market share.
