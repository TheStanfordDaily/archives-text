# Theta Delt house to become self-op for some on wait list
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Fifty-one students on the
waiting list for housing next
year will find themselves
assigned to the newest self-oper
ative on the block: Theta Delta
Chi.
The Theta Delt house will
become a "semi-self-operative"
next year, following the frater
nity's decision to give up its
house to the University housing
system, said Jack Chin, director
of the Row.
The house will be managed
by students, who will hire a
cook, but it will be cleaned by
the University. Storey House
and the academic theme houses
are semi-self-ops with similar
arrangements, according to
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin.
"There will be five student
managers — more than a nor
mal self-op, which has three —
to insure the house is set up and

managed well," Chin said yes
terday. The house will also have
one resident assistant and one
program assistant, like all other
Row houses.
He said administrators
decided that making the house
University-operated would
require hiring extra personnel.
"It just wasn't possible to do
that, considering the current
state" of the Housing and Food
Service budget, he said.
The Theta Delts' announce
ment last Tuesday that they
would give up the house came as
a surprise to administrators
since the fraternity had just fin
ished a long process of proving
to the University that they met
their pledge quota in a fair man
ner.
The University had been
investigating rumors that
pledges of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternity were also joining the
Theta Delts to secure a home for

The Theta Delta Chi house, relinquished to University housing, will be a semi-self-op for 51 stu
dents for the next five years.
