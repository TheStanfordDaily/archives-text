# Theta Delt house to become self-op for some on wait list
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Fifty-one students on the
waiting list for housing next
year will find themselves
assigned to the newest self-oper
ative on the block: Theta Delta
Chi.
The Theta Delt house will
become a "semi-self-operative"
next year, following the frater
nity's decision to give up its
house to the University housing
system, said Jack Chin, director
of the Row.
The house will be managed
by students, who will hire a
cook, but it will be cleaned by
the University. Storey House
and the academic theme houses
are semi-self-ops with similar
arrangements, according to
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin.
"There will be five student
managers — more than a nor
mal self-op, which has three —
to insure the house is set up and

managed well," Chin said yes
terday. The house will also have
one resident assistant and one
program assistant, like all other
Row houses.
He said administrators
decided that making the house
University-operated would
require hiring extra personnel.
"It just wasn't possible to do
that, considering the current
state" of the Housing and Food
Service budget, he said.
The Theta Delts' announce
ment last Tuesday that they
would give up the house came as
a surprise to administrators
since the fraternity had just fin
ished a long process of proving
to the University that they met
their pledge quota in a fair man
ner.
The University had been
investigating rumors that
pledges of the Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternity were also joining the
Theta Delts to secure a home for

the unhoused fraternity and to
prevent the Theta Delt house
from being placed into the Draw.
Chin said he thought it was "a
very wise decision" for the Theta
Delts to give up their house.
"They would have had about 30
boarders in the house next year.
Even with the 15 new pledges
they would only have 20 Theta
Delts in the house."
"I was surprised but glad to see
them take their responsibilities
seriously as a group, to look at the
situation and see what is best for
them and the University," said
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of student affairs.
Theta Delt members will not
be allowed to live in the house,
administrators say. The house
will be placed in the Draw during

the next four years.
"It has to be a clean break,"
said Conklin. "If (the Theta
Delts) are going to be non-resi
dential, then they should not be
living there."
Conklin added that other resi
dents might feel like they were
intruding if members of the fra
ternity were allowed to continue
living in the house.
The Theta Delts "can petition
to get the house back any time
within the next five years," she
said. The University does not
"have all the criteria spelled out
yet, but basically they would need
to demonstrate that they can
come back to the house, that they
have enough members and
they're ready to resume the man
agement of a house.
"At the end of five years, we
must resolve the matter," Conklin
said. "Either they go back in the
house or it becomes property of
the University permanently."
