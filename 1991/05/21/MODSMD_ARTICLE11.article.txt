Soviet lawmakers approve
important emigration bill
MOSCOW (AP) — Shedding centuries of
fear of contact with the West, Soviet lawmakers
voted yesterday to liberalize foreign travel and
emigration, a move that could pave the way for
loosened U.S. trade restrictions.
The law would allow travel abroad for virtu
ally anyone who has permission from another
country to enter, and has no outstanding
alimony obligations, criminal charges or recent
knowledge of state secrets.
The bill — approved by the Supreme Soviet
legislature 320-37 with 32 abstentions — also
establishes appeal procedures for people denied
permission to leave the Soviet Union.
However, the new law may not go fully into
effect until the start of 1993, and emigration
activists said it contains loopholes that could
still bar the departure of some people.
U.N. creates compensation fund
for victims of Iraqi aggression
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Secu
rity Council yesterday voted to set up a com
pensation fund to pay victims of Iraq's aggres
sion against Kuwait. It left to the secretary
general the decision of how much Iraqi oil
money will go into the fund.
The 15-member council voted 14-0, with
Cuba abstaining, to create the fund and to base
its governing council in Geneva.
The council established a committee to con
sider what percentage of Iraq's oil profits will
be set aside to pay claims from individuals, cor
porations and governments. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar will set a ceiling on the
percentage of Iraqi oil revenues for the fund.
The United States has suggested a ceiling of
50 percent, but many Western nations consider
25 percent more likely. Third World countries
say 5 to 10 percent would be reasonable.
Bush threatens to veto House
version of defense budget
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush
threatened a veto yesterday as the House began
debate on a $291 billion military budget tnat
slashes spending on the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative and the B-2 stealth bomber.
"While cutting funding for these and other
crucial programs, the bill funds unneeded
items such as excessive procurement of aircraft
and other weapons systems," Bush said in a let
ter to House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R
-111.
The fiscal 1992 budget, drawn up by the
House Armed Services Committee, terminates
work on the B-2 bomber at the 15 planes in
production and slashes spending on SDI from
the $4.6 billion Bush requested to $2.7 billion.
