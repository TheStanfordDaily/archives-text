# Soviets penalize striking air controllers
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet legis
lature passed stiff penalties against
wildcat strikes yesterday, on the eve of
a threatened walkout by most the
nation's air traffic controllers.
The government said it would send
military controllers to the airports if
civilians defy a decree by Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev and go on
strike today. But the air force said mil
itary specialists were not prepared to
take over.
The strike by controllers and work
ers who direct planes on the ground
would hit many key cities across the
vast Soviet Union, but not Moscow.
Workers at Moscow's four airports,
which handle VI Ps and most foreign

tourists in addition to domestic traffic,
said they would keep working because
many of their demands had been met
by regional airport authorities.
The two sides held last-rninute
negotiations, but Civil Aviation Minis
ter Boris Panyukov said the cash
strapped government had no more
money for the 12,000 controllers, who
seek to triple their salaries.
Pilots for the state-owned Aeroflot
airline, the world's largest, also
planned a one-day warning strike
today for higher wages and pensions.
"If air traffic controllers strike, mil
itary experts will replace them,"
Panyukov told the government news
paper Izvestia. "After all, this strike is

illegal."
The Supreme Soviet legislature
passed amendments to a 1989 labor
law, allowing illegal strikers to be dis
charged and fined up to 3,000 rubles
($5,300).
The amendments called for sen
tences of one year in prison or two
years in a labor camp for anyone who
compels workers to strike, either by
threat or force.
The changes also forbid political
strikes, making it a crime to stop work
while demanding changes in the con
stitution, dissolution of legislative bod
ies or resignation of government lead
ers.
The latter seemed aimed at avoiding

the repetition of job actions like the
two-month-long strike by up to
300,000 miners that was settled earlier
this month.
The new law gives Gorbachev
authority to postpone a strike or sus
pend it for two months. Under tempo
rary presidential powers granted last
year, Gorbachev already has authority
to ban strikes, and did so last week in
key sectors of the economy, including
transportation.
Col. Gen. Pyotr Deinekin, deputy
commander in chief of the Soviet Air
Force, said it would be impossible for
military controllers or pilots to operate
unfamiliar equipment at civilian air
ports.
