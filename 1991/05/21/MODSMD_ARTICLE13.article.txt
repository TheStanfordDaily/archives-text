TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
America's Gulf war hero, formally became Britain's
as well yesterday when Queen Elizabeth II bestowed
an honorary knighthood on him.
"It was marvelous. She is a lovely lady. She just
said 'I would like to present you with this medal,' "
Schwarzkopf said after the private ceremony. "I
think they go out of their way to make sure people
like me don't get nervous."
The royal entourage later flew to Texas.
Schwarzkopf was given a crimson-ribboned, two
cross medallion in his Mac Dill Air Force Base office.
He later beamed through drizzling rain as he dis
played it on the steps of the U.S. Central Command
headquarters.
The four-star general is now Honorary Knight
Commander in the Military Division of the Most
Honorable Order of the Bath. He is the 58th Ameri
can since World War II to receive an honorary
knighthood, which entitles him to use the initials
"KCB" after his name but not the title "sir." That's
reserved for Britons only.
"I don't think anybody is going to call me 'Sir Nor
man.' A few people may call me general, sir,"
Schwarzkopf quipped.
Since his return from Saudi Arabia last month,
Schwarzkopf has been touted as a potential political
candidate, addressed a joint session of Congress,
showered with accolades during a Kentucky Derby
Parade, and was given a Tampa Stadium welcome
featuring marching bands and Mickey Mouse.
The 56-year-old general, who plans to retire this
August, also is fielding book deals offering as much
as $4 million in advance.
The knighting capped a two-hour tour of the city
by the 65-year-old queen, her husband, Prince
Philip, and a royal entourage.
The royal couple sailed into Tampa from Miami
aboard the royal yacht Britannia and were greeted at '
Harbour Island by 200 schoolchildren singing "We
Are The World."
