## Dean of all students 
### 
Michael Jackson has
responsibility to bring
community together

AS AN INCREDIBLY diverse
community, Stanford needs
something more than just a
dean of students. What we need is
a dean for all students.
And in Michael Jackson, we may
have found him.
Currently an associate dean of
student affairs, Jackson was pro
moted to dean of students after a
year-long search. No doubt, his
ability to assess students' feelings
won praise from the search com
mittee.
Jackson is quoted in The New
York Times as saying: "The great
experiment we have is to bring peo
ple together at a community like
Stanford and have them live near
each other and learn from each
other. That will not be without its
stresses and strains."
In his new position, he will be
responsible for limiting those
strains as much as possible.
And it won't be easy.
Many students, from members
of the Greek community to women
to ethnic and sexual minorities,
feel that the University is hostile to
their interests. It will fall to Jack
son to prove that this is a misper
ception.
Moreover, many feel that multi
culturalism has outlived its pur
poses, that it has foolishly set one

group against another, to the detri
ment of all.
Jackson will act as a referee in
the ongoing discussions of race and
ethnicity. In that capacity, he can
help remove the stigma of "politi
cal correctness" — or reinforce it.
Jackson will also coordinate sup
port services for both graduate and
undergraduate students. He will
oversee judicial affairs, fraternal
affairs, the ASSU and the Office of
Student Activities, among other
responsibilities.
A quick succession of controver
sies, from the indirect-cost situa
tion to the prospective budget cuts,
has left both morale and money at
their lowest in years. As Jackson
has realized, he will have to keep
spirits high while pockets are emp
tied.
Fortunately, Jackson is in a
unique position to address all of
these needs.
Over the last decade, he has held
a variety of positions, including
fraternity adviser, assistant to the
provost and director of campus
affairs.
In these and other capacities, he
has shown a dedication to hard
work and a commitment to student
advocacy.
As a Stanford alumnus and a
long-time administrator, Jackson
is well aware of some of the Uni
versity's problems. With his pro
motion, he will be in a position to
help solve many of them.
Hopefully, Jackson will find all
the help he needs to succeed, both
from the University and the stu
dents he serves.
