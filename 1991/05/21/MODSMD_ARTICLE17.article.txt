Reges'detractors assume that the masses are ignorant

THE CONTROVERSY surrounding
the dismissal of Stuart Reges has
prompted consideration of some
interesting issues. The quality of judg
ment exercised by Reges and the moral
weight of his arguments have been much
discussed and debated recently. What I
have found lacking is an attempt by the
various camps to understand each other.
Instead of weighted rhetoric, let's try
to find the underlying assumptions of
each viewpoint. I want to explicitly warn
you that my own bias will emerge, but I
hope to repress it until we have estab
lished a common ground.
I see three main camps — Reges sup
porters, Reges detractors and media
zombies.
The last term is obviously loaded, but
I can think of no other term that more
accurately summarizes the blind pro
gramming exhibited by some people on
this issue. I don't want to get sidetracked
with this group, as its members are blind
to issues and rational discourse. Reality,
like the distinction between MDA and
crack cocaine, takes a back seat to
rhetoric.
But what of the other camps? Many
reasonable people have raised the issue
that, since he made his admission public

and published articles in The Daily,
Reges' claim that he carries drugs in his
backpack constitutes punishable action.
These people draw the analogy to a doc
tor's giving advice outside of the office,
which would certainly constitute action.
Let's ask a silly question: Why bother to
make this point?
It seems like the answer is to provide
accountability.
In our society, we believe that if we
were acted on wrongly, we have the right
to hold the actor accountable. If Johnny
slugs me in the arm, I want him arrested
and fined. Intuitively this concept seems
good, even necessary for society to func
tion.
Of course, once we introduce this
abstract noun, "society," we engender
another issue. What of harm to society?
Surely no one is going to slug society in
the arm, but certain actions like erecting
a roadblock outside your house, which
affects no one in particular, still consti
tutes an affront to society.
I hope that what I have said so far is
palatable to most reasonable people. I
think that Reges supporters and Reges
detractors diverge on the issue of societal
accountability.
By stressing a liberal interpretation of

speech, and by emphasizing civil rights,
Reges supporters apparently seek to
minimize societal concerns. They might
say, "I see him and I acknowledge his
teaching ability; I talk to him during
office hours and I benefit from his pres
ence. Why should I be so concerned with
calling him to talk about an activity that
may degrade this abstract noun 'society'
to an unknown degree?"
Reges detractors may counter, asking
how anyone could claim society is just an
abstraction. Society, they say, is me and
you and the places we live. We don't
want these places to become unpleasant
because of drugs.
Again, I hope a reasonable sketch has
been made. Indeed, it may seem as
though Reges detractors have the upper
hand. However, I believe that Reges
detractors have a hidden assumption —
the Ignorant Masses Assumption.
Concern for community is admirable,
but often, this goal gets confused with
"uplifting" the ignorant masses — mak
ing choices for people who can't do it
themselves.
Instead of having faith that if people
are exposed to something obviously
gross, evil, vile and stupid, they will
reject it, supporters of the Ignorant

Masses Assumption try to remove the
choice from people's hands.
In doing so I believe they unveil their
supposed community concern and reveal
mere condescending control. Often, this
uplifting argument is used when chil
dren are involved. While that issue is
more complicated, I'd like to think that
20-year-old Stanford students have
attained at least a modicum of maturity.
Reges supporters demonstrate true
respect for the community by allowing
individuals to make up their own minds.
Look at the Stanford community,
Reges' home ground. Are his students
forsaking study for a life of non-stop
hedonism? Have any crack babies been
born in Computer Science 109B? Cer
tainly any negative effects Reges' actions
have are even smaller on the United
States at large than on his immediate
community.
It is because I respect people's right to
make decisions for themselves that I
count myself among Reges supporters.
Then again, the ignorant masses
viewpoint is very compelling. After all,
marijuana is illegal and television is not.
