# Stanford president's poor leadership has ruined our reputation
## 
### 
As recent alumni, we are shocked, dis
mayed and truly embarrassed of our
alma mater's leadership. A recent profile
on Stanford University President Donald
Kennedy in The New York Times caught
our eye and proved to us that he should
resign. His comments were inexcusable.
How could he feel as though there is
no serious damage to Stanford? Maybe in

terms of fund raising there is no damage,
but that has nothing to do with
Kennedy. That has more to do with the
fact that alumni realize that Stanford,
the institution, needs our money now
more than ever. After $150 million in
damages from an earthquake, the last
thing Stanford needs is the loss of gov
ernment funding, although the govern
ment has every right to stop awarding
grants after the shameless way Kennedy
has abused the system.
Is it "harsh," as Kennedy describes it?
Perhaps, but what did he expect after
billing the government/taxpayers for a
yacht and a cedar closet?

Since Kennedy's acquisition of the
helm at Stanford, he has done nothing
but bring the school into disrepute. He
shows no real leadership and no vision,
but merely reacts to events as they
unfold.
Perhaps the most troublesome aspect
of this entire fiasco is Kennedy's inability
to accept responsibility. It mirrors Los
Angeles Police Chief Darryl Gates'
refusal to accept responsibility for his
renegade police force. Whether or not
Kennedy or Gates had direct knowledge
of the incidents is not germane — they
were both in charge.
These two men s actions reflect the

decay of honor in our society. Instead of
setting an example as leaders of their
respective organizations, they have set a
terrible standard — don't accept respon
sibility but try to deflect the blame onto
others. That is not the way a leader acts,
but the way a bureaucrat covers his
tracks.
