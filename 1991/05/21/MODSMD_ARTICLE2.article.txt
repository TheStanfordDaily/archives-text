# IFC seeks 'Greek residential lodge'
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
In the words of Interfrater
nity Council president Erik Jor
gensen, the University's unwill
ingness to listen to an IFC pro
posal for the future of the Theta
Delta Chi house "is the straw
that broke the camel's back."
The IFC is planning a
demonstration at 12:40 p.m. in
the Old Union Courtyard
tomorrow to protest Diana Con
klin's refusal to hear a proposal
to make the soon-to-be self
operative Theta Delt house a
"Greek residential lodge."
Such a lodge, the IFC says,
would enable Greek groups to
meet and host philanthropy
events at a central location. The
lodge would have been open to
both male and female residents,
regardless of whether they
belonged to a fraternity or soror
ity"
Conklin, an associate dean of
student affairs, said she refused
to accept the IFC plan because of
its lateness. Proposals for theme
houses are due in January, she
said.
"There just isn't time for them
to design a thoughtful proposal
and for us to make a thoughtful
decision," she added.
But IFC members say that
University officials are dismissing
their idea simply because it is
coming from a Greek organiza
tion.
"They keep telling us they are
'strongly committed' to a Greek
lodge, but basically they just flip
their policy whenever it is conve
nient," Jorgensen said.
The demonstration, which IFC
members are hoping will draw
500 people, will protest the
"injustices" the University has

imposed upon the Greek system.
"We just want it to be known
that we are sick and tired of get
ting a response like 'No, we don't
even want to hear about it,' " he
said.
Jorgensen said the IFC real
ized Wednesday, when it started
to develop the idea of the residen
tial lodge, that getting the pro
posal approved would be difficult
because of the tight time frame.
But, he added, the short time
span for decision-making was not
a good enough reason to dismiss
the idea.
"There is a lot of interest
within the Greek system for this
idea," Jorgensen said. "Even the
housed fraternities, who won't
gain from this specific issue, sup
port it, because they know they
could be on the chopping block
tomorrow."
"Our number one priority was
to get another fraternity in [the
Theta Delt house), but we are
willing to compromise with the
University," Jorgensen said.
But Jorgensen and other IFC
members say they don't think the
University is willing to do the
same.
