## An American education 
### 
AS A WAY OF CELEBRATING
George Bush's "education presi
dency," I want to discuss U.S. gov
ernment sponsorship of some special for
eign students: soldiers. While the appeal
abroad of our excellent academic
research is well-known, too little atten
tion has been focused on the U.S. track
record in teaching oppression or subver
sion.
One might think Washington, D.C. lost
its appetite for training exiles to over
throw their governments after the 1961
Bay of Pigs debacle. Recent news that
U.S. intelligence officials trained a force
of 600 Libyan guerrillas in Chad to over
throw Qaddafi proves the contrary.
Unfortunately, Qaddafi learned about the
existence of these foreign students, so it
was not possible to use them in real com
bat.
Once they had been found out, 350 of
the guerrillas dared not return home. So
when Chad recently refused to host them
any longer, their teachers were forced to
shop around to find them a new home.
The first choice was Zaire, and as an
incentive to convince ruler Mobutu Sese
Seko to accept the guerrillas, Bush
requested millions of dollars in aid for
Zaire, claiming (non-existent) human
rights improvements. When Congress
refused to add to the coffers of one of the
world's richest and most corrupt dicta
tors, this staunch U.S. ally demanded
that the guerrillas leave.
Kenya, another pillar of democracy,
was considered next. This time, Bush did
succeed in obtaining $5 million extra for
Kenya by lying about its human rights
situation. Unfortunately, Nairobi

recently decided that the guerrillas were
no longer welcome, proving the adage
"money isn't everything."
As a last resort, these guerrillas will
now be admitted into the country that
trained them, the United States.
In view of past U.S. efforts at over
throwing unfriendly governments, it
seems unlikely that the Libyan guerrillas
were unique. The next time Bush proffers
a flimsy human rights lie to get money for
a friendly dictator, he might well be trying
to ensure a home for the Libyans or a sim
ilar group of "foreign students" who can
not return to their own country.
Fortunately, teaching soldiers to prop
up rather than subvert their govern
ments need not be done covertly. Hun
dreds of Latin American soldiers are cur
rently receiving a solid American educa
tion at the U.S. Army School of the Amer
icas at Fort Benning, in Columbus, Ga.
Many of them are from El Salvador, mem
bers of one of the most repressive armed
forces in the world.
These soldiers are being trained in
"Low-Intensity Conflict," a euphemism
for using the armed forces domestically to
oppress, terrorize or kill those advocating
change. Since 1980, priests, teachers,
health care workers and many others
have been among the 73,000 killed in El
Salvador's "low-intensity conflict," many
by the armed forces.
The School of the Americas came to
Fort Benning in 1984, after 38 years in
Panama, where it was less visible to the
U.S. public. It has been called the "School
of the Coups" and the "University of
Assassins" for training thousands of
rightist officers from Argentina, Brazil,

Nicaragua and other countries. Its roster
of "prominent" alumni includes Manuel
Noriega and five of the nine soldiers
arrested for the 1989 massacre of six
Jesuit priests, their cook and her 16-year
old daughter in El Salvador.
Although the administration main
tains that students are instructed in
"American values" and human rights
issues at Fort Benning, it refuses to
describe the instruction. From the behav
ior of the graduates, it would seem that
soldiers are trained in the prime "Ameri
can value" of committing the most fla
grant human rights abuses with the least
amount of attendant publicity.
I am certain the school's 15,000
alumni are grateful for their U.S. educa
tion which, similar to the situation in
many academic fields, is among the best
available in their profession. And some
people in Washington, D.C. may well be
proud to observe the intimidation, tor
ture and wanton murder practiced by
those alumni when they return home.
But I sure hope Bush doesn't expect
that to make him the Education Presi
dent.

Mciurits van der Veen wonders if the
School of the Americas has been targeted
in the indirect-cost controversy. His col
umn appears every Tuesday.
