Students should organize and seek national affirmation of diversity

CONGRATULATIONS TO THIS
year's graduates, for they will be
recorded as Stanford's first centen
nial class, and this is an important mile
stone in the University's history.
Special congratulations to those of the
graduating class who are students of
color. This provides an opportunity dur
ing the Centennial to re-examine an arti
cle written 23 years ago. The article,
titled "The Reach of the Submerged,"
was written by Robert Rosenzweig — at
that time associate provost of the Uni
versity — and appeared in the 1968 sum
mer/fall issue of Stanford Today. It is an
article worthy of review by all members
of the University community, especially
students of color, because it sets forth
the rationale at that time for increasing
diversity of the student body.
Rosenzweig informed or reminded the
reader that several kinds of students

were judged by the University to be
"useful" to it: excellent athletes, children
of alumni and children of faculty. Rosen
zweig then noted that "needless to say,
few in the latter two groups are minority
group members."
Later in the article, Rosenzweig
observed to the pain of many that all of
these admission preferences (for out
standing athletes, children of alumni and
children of faculty and staff) have been
and are "... in a sense, 'discriminatory."'
The University was establishing that
ethnic and racial diversity were useful as
well to the University, and it was the
challenge of the University to ascertain
criteria other than the conventional ones
that might be denying the achievement
of this utility.
Phrases and words like "tenacity,"
"overcoming diversity" and "resilience"
began to emerge. More importantly,

these measures have since been per
fected and employed over the years to
the benefit of all applicants, irrespective
of ethnicity and race.
Enunciation and implementation of
these policies brought seismic complaints
from some sectors of the University com
munity and general public. Rosenzweig
put forth their question in his article:
". . . how can the University justify turn
ing away qualified students in order to
accept less well-qualified applicants
because they are of a different racial,
ethnic or class background? Is this not in
fact 'reverse discrimination'?"
Rosenzweig's response was that it is
the wrong question asked; it focuses on
the wrong issue. The real issue is: What
kind of a student body should a univer
sity have? This is a central issue of edu
cational policy which has not been faced
very squarely until now.

Indeed, the integrity and logic of
Rosenzweig's response were more than
the critics deserved.
It is because of that policy change at
Stanford, and at other universities
across the country, that we have wit
nessed some increase in diversity within
student bodies. There are, however,
forces at play at federal and state levels
that are threatening this modest
achievement.
Recent wild pronouncements about
financial aid and minority preferences
from President George Bush's Depart
ment of Education, and fiscal belt-tight
ening at private and public colleges and
universities throughout the country, are
examples of the threats.
With that gloomy backdrop, it might
be of value if Stanford's graduating class
of 1994 considered organizing and host
ing a 25th anniversary convocation of

the University's proclamation on student
diversity. At such an event, student rep
resentatives from around the country
would convene to seek and discuss affir
mation of diversity, need-blind admis
sions and associated issues.
While I applaud the rationale of diver
sity put forth by Stanford and other
institutions 23 years ago, the motive of
many at that time was not that at all.
For many, myself included, the prevailing
motive was the perception and hope that
highly educated and trained students of
color would help communities of color,
and thus others.
As a person of color, this is a rationale
I still embrace. For communities of color
— as well as minds — are terrible things
to waste.
