# Reductionist nature of Daily's phone poll obscured real debate
## 
### 
I am protesting against the utterly
simplistic questions comprising The
Daily's recent telephone poll of Stanford
faculty.
"Do you approve of President
Kennedy . . . ? Yes, no or no opinion."
What if I approve of about 95 percent
of his conduct but not of the 5 percent

(at the very most) that has gotten us into
the current mess? The Daily might at
least have asked for a grade!
"Do you think President Kennedy
should resign?"
When? I think he may choose to
resign eventually, but it would be a first
class public-relations blunder for him to
resign now.
" Do you aj. prove of the advocacy of
illegal drug-taking . . . ?"
Of course not. I don't approve of
breaking the law, period. Whether I
approve of the law that is being broken is
a totally different matter.

Stanford staff and students ought to
debate on a higher level than this.
