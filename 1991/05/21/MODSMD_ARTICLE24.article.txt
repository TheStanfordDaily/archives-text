# Greek RAP advocates the hiring of assault service coordinator
## 
### 
The Greek Rape Awareness Project
(Greek RAP), along with the University's
other rape education programs, regards

hiring a full-time coordinator of sexual
assault services as a crucial issue.
Greek RAP, Project HEAR and the
Rape Education Project are all student
run programs. Each program offers a
unique approach for addressing the issue
of rape on campus. While Project HEAR,
for example, primarily targets freshman
dorms, Greek RAP is a program started
by fraternity and sorority members to
promote rape awareness.
Earlier this year the rape education
groups formed the Coalition Against Sex
ual Assault, a loose alliance of the rape
education programs, women's defense

collective, ASSU members and task force
representatives.
Coalition members feel strongly about
the need for a person to centralize our
resources, coordinate our efforts and
ensure the long-term survival of our
innovative programs.
Hiring a full-time assault service coor
dinator would show that the University
administration not only supports student
efforts, but is similarly willing to meet
the problem.
