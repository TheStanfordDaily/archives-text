## Top-ranked USC ends Stanford's run in semis 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — In the end, Stan
ford proved to be human.
The aura of invincibility associated
with the men's tennis team at the
NCAA tournament disappeared into the
Georgia mist yesterday.
The squad will have no fourth this
year. No fourth day in Athens. No
fourth consecutive national title.
For the Cardinal was ousted by USC
5-2 in the NCAA semifinals, in a match
that was much closer than the score
indicates.
USC meets hometown squad Georgia
in the finals. Up 4-2 after singles, the
Bulldogs held off a tenacious California
comeback to clinch 5-4 in the third set of
No. 3 doubles.
Coming into the contest Stanford
knew its match would not be a day at the
beach. USC was seeded No. 1, had
demolished its first two opponents, and
had taken two of three from the Cardi
nal during the season.
The Trojans' spectacular play and
the inhospitable weather ensured a
challenging outing.
USC hit the courts on fire. They
could do nothing wrong. Even the 50-
degree weather and swirling fog
couldn't deter the driven squad.
Stanford battled every match to a
prolonged death — the team contest
lasted over five hours — but could not
kill the Trojans' resolve. Or disrupt
their execution.
"We knew USC was playing well and
we knew [the matchl would be very
tight," Jared Palmer said. "I don't think
they're so much the better team than
they just played great."
"They really played like a champi
onship team," said Stanford coach Dick
Gould. "We played good, tough matches,
[but] when you get beat by a team that
played better, what can you say?"
USC was playing so well that it
appeared the match was going to be over
in a hurry. The Trojans took five of the
six first sets in singles, in some cases ral
lying from three-game deficits. The lone
opening stanza that went to a player in
Cardinal and White was won in a
tiebreaker. Only Palmer was able to
stave off his driven opponent, getting
the jump on Donny Isaak at No. 3 by the
slimmest of margins, 7-6 (7-4).
The situation was looking grim for
the three-time defending national
champions just an hour into competi-

tion. Stanford had not only fallen into a
hole in five matches, but had also
quickly dropped behind in three second
sets.
It appeared the Trojans might
advance without playing a match of dou
bles.
The Cardinal, however, isn't a
stranger to adversity. Or to comebacks.
With USC leading 1-0 and oh-so-close
to going up 3-0 the press had conceded
victory, but Stanford staged an amazing
run. And in the process turned the con
test into the great match that was
expected.
"Our guys did a great job battling
back," Gould said. "There were some
matches where we were really down and
came back a turned the match around.
"The way the match started it didn't
look like it would be very close but the
guys kept battling back, battling back."
Vimal Patel had already been downed
7-5, 6-1 by Jon Leach at No. 4. Alex
O'Brien - down 2-6, 2-5 to Brian Mac-
Phie at No. 1 - was looking at extinction,
Michael Flanagan was in similar
straights with Andras Lanyi at No. 6
and Jason Yee was down to David
Ekerot 4-6, 5-6 on court five.
And suddenly the Cardinal came
alive.
In one of the most brillant comebacks
of the tournament, O'Brien held serve,
broke freshman phenom MacPhie, then
held again to tie things up at five. A ser
vice break and a comeback from 15-30
later, and set two was OB's, 7-5.
It was in the third stanza, however,
that O'Brien showed his true mettle.
After trading serves evenly for eight
games, O'Brien took the initiative and
broke MacPhie for a 5-4 advantage. It
looked like the set was going to go at
least two more games, however when
MacPhie had break point at add-out.
O'Brien had different ideas. A fantas
tic passing shot brought the game back
to deuce, and MacPhie's next return was
long. Two-six, seven-five, six-four, Stan
ford. In rallying from the grave, the once
unhearalded recruit extended his streak
to 11 straight victories in NCAA team
singles competition. He has never lost in
three years.
"Alex's win at No. 1 symbolizes that
we had a chance to turn it around. The

guys did a really good job," Gould said.
Flanagan tried to emulate O'Brien's
example. Down 4-6, 2-5, he held serve
then broke Lanyi for a 7-5 second set
win. The two traded serves until the
score was 4-4 in the final set, when
Flanagan broke for a 5-4 lead and the
opportunity to serve for the match.
Lanyi, however, responded to the chal
lange. He broke Flanagan, then held
serve to go up 6-5. When serving to tie
things up at six, however, Flanagan dou
ble faulted twice and the set, and match,
was USC's 6-4, 5-7, 7-5.
"I felt really good, and I definitely
thought I could win when I went up 5-4,
but [LanyiJ always plays his best tennis
when he's behind and he took it up a
notch," Flanagan said.
Yee had a similar comeback attempt.
After losing the first 4-6, he was down to
Ekerot 5-6 and the Trojan was serving
for the match. The wily Cardinal senior
broke Ekerot, held serve, then pulled
out an 8-6 tiebreaker.
After falling into an love-five hole in
the deciding set Yee again came back to
life. He won three straight games —
breaking Ekerot once — before the Tro
jan could stop him. But it was too little,
too late. Match USC: 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3,
but not without a fight.
Stanford's final two singles matches
also went to three sets, the first time
that an NCAA semifinal has ever had
five singles three-setters.
Palmer hung tough against a very
hot Isaak. After pulling out a 7-6 (7-4)
first set, Palmer went down volleying 3-
6 in the second. He realised the team's
situation, however, and took his game
up a level to give the Cardinal a much
needed "W".
"I had a feeling we were down, that
we were struggling and it fired me up a
little," Palmer said.
Isaak would give little, but Palmer
found a way to break him anyway, going
up 4-2, and, after Isaak tied things up at
four, breaking at 5-4 for the 7-6, 3-6, 6-4
victory.
Fellow sophomore sensation
Jonathan Stark could not do the same
against Byron Black. After going up 5-2
in the first, Stark was tied by Black at
five, then downed 2-7 in the tie-breaker.
He broke in the second set and hung on
against Black's comeback for a 6-4
advantage, but couldn't do the same in
the third, going down 7-6, 4-6, 6-2.
Four-two Trojans. No exactly a
desireable scenario, but not dead yet.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily file
With an incredible win over Brian MacPhie, junior Alex O'Brien improved to 11-0 in
dual-match play at the NCAA championships. Unfortunately for him, the Cardinal is
now a mere 10-1 over that span. Stanford fell to USC 5-2 in the semifinals yesterday,
dashing hopes of a fourth consecutive NCAA crown.
