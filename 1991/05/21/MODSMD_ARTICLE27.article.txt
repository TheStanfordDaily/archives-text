# Every day in the sun has to come to an end sometime
## 
### 
It's the top of the ninth late on a Satur
day afternoon at Sunken Diamond. In
Stanford's last home game of 1991,
the score is 10-1 Cardinal, and Santa
Clara's Andy Solomon is at the plate fac
ing Scott Weiss.
Two gone. Full count. Nobody on. The
game is long since over, Stanford has
reserves in everywhere except on the
mound, and now Weiss moves into his
windup. As I lie on the grass watching,
the last pitch I'll ever see at Sunken Dia
mond gets ready to leave Weiss' hand. . . .
Whoa!!! Wait! Hey, time out!!!
Weiss, along with everyone else in the
stadium, freezes. The ball, which has
started its trip to the plate, hangs in the
air just beyond his fingers. Gonna be a
curve.
Very weird.
Whew. That's better.

I look around for a few minutes,
slightly amused at all the people who
were doing embarrasssing things the
moment time stopped, but then I start to
get bored. Where's that voice coming
from?
"All right," I ask the Voice, "everyone's
frozen. What do you want?"
Suddenly, I remember that I'm talking
to the air. Mv mom would have a cow.

"Hey! Anyone here?"
Just me.
I spin around, but I still can't see any
thing. Great, I think. I'm in a baseball
field listening to a voice I can't see.
Where's Kevin Costner when you really
need him?
Not funny.
"All right, enough! What's going on?"
I'm not really sure. The last thing I
remember we were in Omaha, down 5-1 to
Georgia in the semis. Roger Burnett was
at the plate with two on, Tim Griffin was
on deck with two out in the ninth . . . and
that's it. What happened?
"You don't want to know."
Come on.
I stare at the players standing in front
of the dugout, not really wanting to
remember that Friday in June 1990. "He
struck out looking," I finally say. "The

last strike was about a foot outside, and
Georgia won the College World Series the
next day."
A very long pause. One of the players
had just spit out a sunflower seed, and
now I notice that it's hovering several feet
above the ground.
"We didn't win? Fifty-two and ten in
the regular season and we didn't win?
Twenty-five school records broken . . .
and we didn't win? Two pitchers taken in
the first round of the draft and we still
didn't win?
"Do we have to talk about this?"
I hear nothing for awhile, so I pass the
time wondering what would happen if I
went on the field and twanged the
umpire's mask on his face.
After several minutes of waiting for
everyone to get moving again — after all,
I had things to do — the Voice came back.

Whatever, he sighed. What's going on
now?
"Well, as I was saying right before you
showed up, this is the last pitch I'm ever
going to see here. The season's just about
over, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to
pass everything (Right — ed.) } so this is
it."
The season's over?! But I missed it!
What's been going on? How are the fresh
men? What's McCarty hitting? How's
J.R. and R.T. and Roger and Jeffrey?
Did we win the Six-Pac? Where are the
regionals? Come on, help me out!
"Easy, champ. Everyone's fine. The
team never really got untracked this sea
son — McCarty went nuts at the plate,
but that's about it — so they're headed to
the regionals in Fresno at 37-21."
