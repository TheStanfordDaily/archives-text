# Every day in the sun has to come to an end sometime
## 
### 
It's the top of the ninth late on a Satur
day afternoon at Sunken Diamond. In
Stanford's last home game of 1991,
the score is 10-1 Cardinal, and Santa
Clara's Andy Solomon is at the plate fac
ing Scott Weiss.
Two gone. Full count. Nobody on. The
game is long since over, Stanford has
reserves in everywhere except on the
mound, and now Weiss moves into his
windup. As I lie on the grass watching,
the last pitch I'll ever see at Sunken Dia
mond gets ready to leave Weiss' hand. . . .
Whoa!!! Wait! Hey, time out!!!
Weiss, along with everyone else in the
stadium, freezes. The ball, which has
started its trip to the plate, hangs in the
air just beyond his fingers. Gonna be a
curve.
Very weird.
Whew. That's better.

I look around for a few minutes,
slightly amused at all the people who
were doing embarrasssing things the
moment time stopped, but then I start to
get bored. Where's that voice coming
from?
"All right," I ask the Voice, "everyone's
frozen. What do you want?"
Suddenly, I remember that I'm talking
to the air. Mv mom would have a cow.

"Hey! Anyone here?"
Just me.
I spin around, but I still can't see any
thing. Great, I think. I'm in a baseball
field listening to a voice I can't see.
Where's Kevin Costner when you really
need him?
Not funny.
"All right, enough! What's going on?"
I'm not really sure. The last thing I
remember we were in Omaha, down 5-1 to
Georgia in the semis. Roger Burnett was
at the plate with two on, Tim Griffin was
on deck with two out in the ninth . . . and
that's it. What happened?
"You don't want to know."
Come on.
I stare at the players standing in front
of the dugout, not really wanting to
remember that Friday in June 1990. "He
struck out looking," I finally say. "The

last strike was about a foot outside, and
Georgia won the College World Series the
next day."
A very long pause. One of the players
had just spit out a sunflower seed, and
now I notice that it's hovering several feet
above the ground.
"We didn't win? Fifty-two and ten in
the regular season and we didn't win?
Twenty-five school records broken . . .
and we didn't win? Two pitchers taken in
the first round of the draft and we still
didn't win?
"Do we have to talk about this?"
I hear nothing for awhile, so I pass the
time wondering what would happen if I
went on the field and twanged the
umpire's mask on his face.
After several minutes of waiting for
everyone to get moving again — after all,
I had things to do — the Voice came back.

Whatever, he sighed. What's going on
now?
"Well, as I was saying right before you
showed up, this is the last pitch I'm ever
going to see here. The season's just about
over, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to
pass everything (Right — ed.) } so this is
it."
The season's over?! But I missed it!
What's been going on? How are the fresh
men? What's McCarty hitting? How's
J.R. and R.T. and Roger and Jeffrey?
Did we win the Six-Pac? Where are the
regionals? Come on, help me out!
"Easy, champ. Everyone's fine. The
team never really got untracked this sea
son — McCarty went nuts at the plate,
but that's about it — so they're headed to
the regionals in Fresno at 37-21."

Thirty-seven and twenty-one?
Another pause. I wonder if every
one's starting to get stiff.
And then it comes, that phrase
that I'd heard so much all season:
That sucks.
Enough. "Oh, shut up. People
have whined all year about this
team and I'm getting sick of it.
When you compare this team to
last year's, you're right. It isn't
nearly as good. No one is that
good.
"But I will tell you one thing,"
I go on. "The 1991 baseball team
probably has a better chance of
winning it all than the 1990
team."
Get out.
"Look, the best team hardly

ever wins the CWS: All that mat
ters is who happens to be hot dur
ing one week in June. You think
Stanford was the best team in the
country in 1988? Not even close.
"This year, if we get hot, we've
got as good chance as anyone —
maybe even more, because this
team has something that the
other 47 in the tournament
don't."
What's that ?
"Last year. Whoever's in
charge of these things owes us
one."
The sun normally would be
on its way down by now, but
it hasn't budged. I figure
it's time to get moving, even
though — to be completely honest
— I'm in no rush to leave.
"So," I say, "you're caught up.
Can we get this thing moving
again?"
Well ...no.

Great, I think. I'm in a baseball field lis
tening to a voice I can't see. Where's
Kevin Costner when you really need
him?

No, he says. Great. "Why not?"
1 don't want the season to be
over. I haven't seen enough, I
haven't relaxed enough, I don't
want to leave. . . .
"So who does? Come on, it's
over. I don't like it either, but it's
time."
No.
"Weiss has been standing on
one leg for 10 minutes. Give him a
break."
Forget it. I'm dealing with a
disembodied 6-year-old.
And then it happens: In spite of
the Voice's protests — and, also,

in spite of mine (but I wasn't
going to tell him that) — Weiss'
arm moves.
The ball moves away from his
hand and floats, slowly, toward
the plate. The other players come
back to life.
We see it at the same time, and
have almost the same reaction:
Oh no. Wait! I haven't seen
enough, darnit! I'm not ready for
it to be over. . . .
"Sorry."
We watch as the ball spins a
few feet closer to home, as the fol
low-through sends Weiss' right

arm down toward the ground, as
Solomon gets a good look at it. . . .
Yup. It's a curve.
No!.. .
Maybe he'll walk him, I think.
The ball, spining crazily, veers
toward the ground. Please walk
him. I don't want to leave either.
The ball bounces almost a foot
in front of the plate. Yes! One
more batter!. . .
. . . and Solomon swings any
way.
Strike three.
Fifteen minutes later, Sunken
Diamond is nearly empty.
The thousand or so fans
have left — they probably don't
even remember what happened —
and the only sound is Jackson
Browne's "Stay" blaring on the
loudspeaker.
The players, too, have no idea.
They hold their last home team

meeting in right field and then
take off. There's one more regu
lar-season game, tomorrow at
Santa Clara, and then the region
als.
After that, who knows?
As I start the walk home, I
notice that the Voice is gone.
Maybe he left; maybe he's
accepted that we have to leave; or
maybe he just doesn't want to
fight it any more.
"Thanks for a great season,"
the HA. announcer says to the
departing fans. "We'll see you in
1992."
The Voice, however, will never
be back — and neither will I.

Cameron Maeky bungee-jumped
headfirst off a 250-foot-high
crane last Friday, but he says
there's no way he'd be dumb
enough to try the Delts' ice slide.
You figure it out.
