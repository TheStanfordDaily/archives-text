# Cardinal nine sent to Fresno State for West II Regional
## 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
If the Stanford baseball team gets to the
College World Series in Omaha, Neb., they
will know they did it the hard way. The
NCAA tournament committee announced
the regional pairings yesterday, and the
Cardinal will be heading inland to Fresno
as the No. 2 seed in the West II Regional.
Stanford begins play Thursday at 3:30 p.m.
against San Diego State in the second game
of a double-elimination tournament that
will be anything but easy.
"The western regionals are by far the
best," Stanford coach Mark Marquess said.
"They are the toughest regionals by far,
there is no question."
The West I Regional is being played at
USC, but starting Thursday the Cardinal's
attention will be focused on Fresno. Joining
Stanford in the hope of championship glory
will be No. 1 seed the University of Miami
as well as host Fresno State (third seed),
CS-Northridge (fourth seed), San Diego
State (fifth seed) and Portland (sixth seed).
Every team except Portland finished the
season in the top 25.
At 45-15, perennial national powerhouse
Miami looks to be the team to beat. The
Hurricanes are ranked sixth by Collegiate
Baseball and ninth by Baseball America,
receiving an at-large bid as an independent.
"I watched them (Sunday) night," said
Marquess. "They are a tough squad; they
have good pitching and solid hitting."
Yet before the Cardinal gets the chance
to face Miami, they will have to get by fifth
seeded San Diego State Thursday. The
Aztecs arrived in Fresno by virtue of win
ning the Western Athletic Conference
Championships, finishing the season at 43-
19.

Stanford beat San Diego State twice last
year at Sunken Diamond to advance to the
World Series, but with a year gone by many
things have changed. The Western Athletic
Conference certainly does not measure up
to the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion, yet with 43 wins the Aztecs are no
gimme win.
"I'm very impressed with (San Diego
State)," said Marquess. "Last year we saw
some good pitching, and they went out to
Hawaii (for the WAC tournament) and beat
them twice, which means they must be
playing well."
The Aztecs are led by the pitching tan
dem Brian Holliday and Rick Navarro. Hol
liday sports a 6-2 record and a 3.09 earned
run average while Navarro comes in at 8-5
with a 3.12 ERA. Supporting these two is a
team that is batting .310, but is way short
on power, having hit only 12 home runs all
year. In comparison Stanford has sent the
ball over the fence 72 times this season.
The differnce, of course, will be the
pitching. Stanford has had trouble with
pitching consistency all year, and if you
struggle in the regionals, it's a quick trip
home. Marquess will be taking 10 pitchers
along to give himself the depth that may be
neccessary for the possible five games that
the team could play. The Stanford skipper
has learned to be prepared for anything
when he looks to the mound.
"Our pitchers can beat anyone, but are
very capable of being beat by anybody at
any time," said Marquess. "They have that
kind of stuff."
If Stanford gets by SDSU Thursday they
will face the winner of the nightcap's
Fresno State/CS-Northridge game, and if
they do not they will play the Miami-Port
land loser. If the seedings hold, Stanford
will meet Miami in game No. 7 Saturday.
