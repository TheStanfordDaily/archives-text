# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While Stanford University has developed
a world-wide reputation for academic excel
lence, those people who are close to the
school also realize athletic excellence exists
here as well.
Stanford produces All-Americans too
numerous to mention, and frequently Cardi

nal athletes are named the best in their
sport. Two of those are Sandra Birch of the
women's tennis team and David McCarty
of the baseball team.
Birch, a 5-foot-6 senior from Huntington
Bay, N.Y., proved herself the nation's best
for the second time in three years. The 1989
NCAA singles champion was nowhere near
100 percent during the NCAA team competi
tion due to a stomach virus.
But a fortuitous rain delay and a good
draw allowed her a chance to recover. She
ended up winning six matches in four days,
losing only one set to Shannan McCarthy
along the way.
When she beat California's Lisa Albano 6-
3, 6-2 in the NCAA final last Thursday at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium, she became only
the second two-time winner in NCAA histo
ry.

McCarty, a 6-5 junior from Houston,
Texas, finished the regular season the way
he started it: on fire.
Going into a two-game series with Santa
Clara over the weekend, McCarty's batting
average dropped below .400 for the first time
since the very start of the year. Saturday at
Sunken Diamond McCarty went 4-for-4,
sending two balls well over the fences for
home runs No. 22 and 23.
He also had a double and a single and
scored four runs, helping the Cardinal to a
10-1 victory.
Sunday McCarty was more mortal, going
a mere 2-for-4. Of course, both the hits were

doubles and he scored once as well as driving
in a run.
McCarty is now hitting .417 with a slug
ging percentage over .800 to lead the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division. He was
named Six-Pac Player of the Year last week
and has a very good shot at winning national
Player of the Year honors as well.
