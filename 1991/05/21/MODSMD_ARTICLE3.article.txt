# Leapfrog completes 400 miles
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As Kermit the Frog could have
told Trancos residents, it isn't
easy being green.
With 400 miles done and only
600 more to go, residents of the
all-freshman house are slowly but
surely approaching the world
record for leapfrogging in an
attempt to raise money for the
Creative Adventures Learning
Center, an after-school program in
East Palo Alto.
When day four was completed
yesterday afternoon, the 14
leapfroggers were slightly behind
their designated pace of 100 miles
per day. Although they pushed
back the completion of the
planned 10-day activity to Sunday,
they still plan to host a giant party
on Wilbur Field Saturday â€” when
they expect to break the current
Guinness Book record of 888
miles.
Donations to the group are also
lagging behind what had been
expected. Although the leapfrog
gers originally planned to raise
$10,000 for the center, organizer
Brian Cook said a more realistic
goal will be about $5,000, based
on the $3,000 already collected.
"Hopefully with our T-shirt
sales and donations we will be able
to raise something like $5,000,"
Cook said. "I would hate to feel
that I killed myself and everyone
else just to raise a little change."
Cook first proposed breaking
the world leapfrog record in a dor
mitory meeting last quarter. In
1988 the senior class of his New
Hampshire high school set the
current record in a similar charity
fund-raising event.
"I would never have proposed
breaking this record if I hadn't
seen it done before," Cook said.
While none of the leapfroggers
have given up yet, some have
found exhaustion and sore mus
cles to be a real problem at times.
"Most people find that
[leapfrogging] is pretty reason
able," Cook said. "It was real
tough the first day or two, espe
cially because no one is used to
running, leaping and squatting
for 16 miles per day."
Freshman Mike Lewis
explained that "weak knees,
ankles and lower backs" have
been the biggest problems.
"Stretching, Ben-Gay and Advil
have been the best treatment for
just about everything," he added.
The freshmen each have shifts
of four hours of hopping and eight
hours of rest. Within a shift, a pair
leapfrogs around the track for 15
minutes and then rotates with
another pair.
To officially leapfrog, both feet

must come close to jumping at the
same time and the person being
leaped over cannot touch his
hands to the ground. A leap must
occur every 10 meters, but "no
one will get pissed off if we do one
or two wrong or take one or two
extra steps," said freshman Justin
Kitch.
At night, Wilbur Field is par
tially lit up as the Trancos resi
dents circle the now well-worn
dirt track, listening to music 24
hours per day. Local companies
have donated supplies, including
tents, generators, food and water.
"Last Thursday and Friday
nights were the worst because of
the wind," said freshman Sam
Scuilli. "At night, it is so much
colder and muscles tighten up a
lot quicker."
With the 14 freshmen basically
eating, sleeping and leapfrogging
full-time, academics tend to get
put on hold. "Once you have con
ceded that you will blow off your
work, it is actually a nice week
off," Kitch said.
But not everyone has adopted
Kitch's work ethic. "Some of us
are still trying to get the work
done," Scuilli said.
Although everyone in Trancos
and many other students have
expressed support, there are still
some "skeptical students," Cook
said. He said has heard of a bet
ting pool organized in another
dorm as to when they will quit.
And even after they break the
record, Cook said he does not
expect it to stand for long. He said
people in his high school at home
are already planning to reclaim
the world leapfrogging record
next year.
