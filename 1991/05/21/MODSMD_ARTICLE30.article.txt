Freshmen 'Prohibition* Ends
Duke University's two-year moratorium
banning freshmen from joining their class
mates at social activities during the first two
weeks of fall semester was recently lifted due
to its ineffectiveness.
Maureen Cullions, assistant to the vice
president of students affairs, said the mora
torium was difficult to enforce and created
an alcohol mystique.
The ban, intended to promote interaction
in a safe environment and class unity, did not
prevent students from drinking, as dozens of
freshmen were placed on probation within
their first two weeks of college.

Student government tries to
fire newspaper's editor in chief
Alleging that The Daily Nexus' coverage
was responsible for the low voter turnout in
UC-Santa Barbara's general election, the
Associated Students Legislative Council
passed a bill calling for the dismissal of Larry
Speer, the paper's editor in chief.
The bill also called for a 38-day advertis
ing boycott of the paper.
"The Nexus specifically said, 'Do not
vote.' My opinion is that the general tone (of
Nexus coverage) was that the election was
pointless," said Associated Students Com
munications Board Co-chair Eric Jensen.
The bill's proponents contend that the

paper violated the American Society of
Newspaper Editors' Canons of Journalism,
the paper's governing guidelines, and
neglected public interest by dissuading stu
dents not to vote for the position of external
president.
"If they had an executive meeting to mali
ciously undermine the elections, they could
not have done a better job," said the Associ
ated Students Adviser, Dulcie Sinn.
Speer was not at the council meeting, but
commented that he is "not going to jump
into the fray of this."

Cal students charge harassment
Two UC-Berkeley students who identify
themselves as "queer," Teddy Nadell and
Ryan Kahl, filed reports with dormitory offi
cials after allegedly receiving repeated verbal
harassment and threats of physical harm
from three football players.
After allegedly starting a fight that
resulted in a chair being thrown across the
room and a cafeteria chase, football player
Eric Mahlum reportedly screamed out, "I'm
not racist, I'm not sexist, but I hate faggots."
Later, Nadell claimed that Mahlum said
he would, "break [Kahl's] jaw if he looked at
him again."
Mahlum defended his right to free speech,
and claimed that "He was smiling at me and
I started yelling at him. It's the third time
that something like that has happened to
me" at the dormitory.

The football players were later told by
Residential Life Coordinator Gypsy Denzine
that they must relocate. Mahlum and Mick
Barsala said they have no plans to do so until
they are forced to.
Students get surprise bill
Under a plan recently approved by
Howard University's Board of Trustees, stu
dents will soon be contributing to the univer
sity's endowment.
The Independence Initiative, which has
been endorsed by student leaders and the
student newspaper, provides that each
semester students will pay a self-imposed
$15 surcharge that will be added to the uni
versity's $85 million endowment. Each pay
ment will then be matched by a contribution
from the federal government. After four
years, the university says the plan will raise
about $2.5 million.
"The Independence Initiative will send a
clear message that, from the day of their
arrival on campus, Howard students can be
counted on to support the greater good of the
university," said M. Kasim Reed, the univer
sity's undergraduate trustee.
The students say they are helping them
selves. In the first semester, the payments
are expected to generate $139,500, totaling
$279,000 after the federal funds. The initia
tive will provide financial assistance to stu
dents and promote academic programs.
