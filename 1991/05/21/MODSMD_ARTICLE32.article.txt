Reclaimed water refills
Stanford Hospital fountain
While other fountains on campus remain
dry, Stanford Hospital's main fountain has
begun spurting reclaimed water from the
city of Palo Alto.
Aesthetic and financial reasons prompted
the refilling of the fountain six months after
it was turned off in order to save water,
Assoc. Hospital Director Louis Saksen said.
The fountain, located in front of the main
entrance on Pasteur Drive, uses water that
is "near drinking quality," said Linda Clerk
son, a city utilities officer. Signs on the foun
tain explain that it uses reclaimed water,
which is allowed and encouraged by the city.
The 150,000 gallons of water, reclaimed
from sewage, were processed in three con
secutive stages before being trucked in and
put into the fountain.
The move cost the hospital about $5,000,
Saksen said. Although officials are unsure
about the cost of replacing some of the water
due to evaporation, the hospital no longer
has to pay for maintaining the dry fountain
or worry about deterioration.
The Medical Center also plans to use
reclaimed water for landscape irrigation.
Two professors elected to
nation's oldest scholarly society
Stanford Professors Patrick Suppes and
Richard Zare have become members of the
American Philosophical Society, the oldest
scholarly society in the nation. The society
supports academic endeavors through
research grants, publications and its library.
Suppes is a professor of philosophy and a
courtesy professor in the School of Educa

tion and in the Departments of Statistics
and Psychology. He is known for using com
puters in his courses and teaches about 12
classes a year, twice as much as the average
professor.
Zare, a professor of chemistry, applies
lasers to chemistry and analyzes mixtures
and chemical reactions.
Including Zare and Suppes, 24 Stanford
faculty members belong to the American
Philosophical Society.
