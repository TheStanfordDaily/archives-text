# School superintendent notes problems in public education

The superintendent of the San
Francisco School District, Ramon
Cortines, spoke last night on the
poor state of public education in
California.
Addressing about 100 students
in the popular political science
class "Civil Rights and Civil Liber
ties," he said the main problems
in public education are inadequate
teacher training, insufficient
funding, a lack of skilled man
agers and few new people entering
the system.
Cortines said public education
should be a major concern for citi
zens since it "represents more
than anything the quality of life
people lead."
He said reform efforts have to
look at student-teacher ratio in
lower grades, rather than focusing
solely on the higher levels, where
the drop-out problem becomes
apparent.
Moreover, he stressed the
importance of having teachers
who teach within their own areas

of specialty. Currently, there are
only 40 teachers in the San Fran
cisco district who teach subjects in
which they majored in college.
"Teachers should have more
intellectual training," Cortines
said. "It's important for [them] to
remain current in the areas they
teach."
Moreover, he said he advocates
early teacher retirement to enable
children to have role models they
can more easily identify with.
Cortines also talked about Gov.
Pete Wilson's plan to try to get
voters to revoke Proposition 98,
which requires that 40 percent of
the state's budget go to education.
The proposition is important
because it ensures stable funding
for the schools, despite Califor
nia's budget constraints, he said.
Voters will decide whether to
retain Proposition 98 in June, and
some educators fear that a two
thirds majority will suspend it.
If the proposition were
revoked, the San Francisco school
district would receive $4 million
in funds, as opposed to the $13
million it currently receives. To

fill the financial vacuum left by
the cuts, Cortines proposed that
the state give 2 percent of its sales
tax to the schools.
Although he is a Democrat,
Cortines was asked to be the
"point person," or advocate, in
California for President Bush's
America 2000 national educa
tional program. The program is
focused on community self-deter
mination and not on providing
money, Cortines said.
He said that although the pro
gram has some good elements, he
refused the position because he
expected to confront many
bureaucratic obstacles.
In the five years that he has
been school superintendent in
San Francisco, Cortines has
implemented various programs
made possible by generating
money from the community.
Some of these include complet
ing libraries at all schools, man
dating Saturday school for stu
dents with low reading skills and
requiring that middle school stu
dents take science courses.
