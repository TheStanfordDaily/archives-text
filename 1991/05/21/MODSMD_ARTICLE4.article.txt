# IRS to probe universities
## Stanford research practices may get more scrutiny 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Yet another federal agency may
soon be combing through Stan
ford's accounting records.
An official from the Internal
Revenue Service said his agency
plans to investigate research uni
versities involved in the nation
wide controversy over indirect
costs to determine if the schools
have violated laws governing non
profit tax organizations.
The IRS will examine whether
research universities have been
claiming as deductions the same
items that have been improperly
included as indirect costs of
research, according to Marcus
Owens, director of the IRS
Exempt Organizations Technical
Division, in an interview appear
ing in the May 22 Chronicle of
Higher Education.
Federal probes have disclosed
that Stanford and several other
universities have included several
improper and questionable
charges in their cost claims,
including flowers, receptions and
foreign travel.
As a matter of policy, the IRS
will not disclose which universi
ties will be investigated, Owens
said.

Stanford officials contacted
yesterday said they were not
aware of any plans by the IRS to
look into Stanford's tax practices.
"I haven't heard anything about
it," said University Counsel Debra
Zumwalt.
But Zumwalt and other Stan
ford officials acknowledged that
any federal review prompted by
scrutiny of indirect-cost policies
would likely include Stanford.
The University was the subject
of a well-publicized seven-hour
hearing in mid-March by the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, chaired
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
The hearing focused heavily on
individual items that had been
erroneously charged to the gov
ernment, including depreciation
on the yacht Victoria and adminis
trative costs of the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
"Certainly there's been a Din-

gell hearing on Stanford,"
Zumwalt said. "But I don't know

The IRS, Owens indicated, will
be examining universities' unre
lated-business income tax. That
tax, known as ÜBIT, is paid by
non-profit organizations on
income they receive that is not
related to their primary missions.
"I am wondering, given the
rather unusual items that are
popping up as (indirect-cost)
expenses, whether and to what
extent the university accounting
systems are putting the same
expenses into the deductions they
use to calculate their ÜBIT,"
Owens told the Chronicle.
Stanford's indirect-cost claims
and ÜBIT payments are prepared
by separate branches of the Con
troller's Office. "It's completely
