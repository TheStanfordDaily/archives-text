# New Stanford Naturists strip away confinements of clothing

### Leo Chu 
Style has always reflected comfort at Stanford.
Students can be seen readily sporting the latest fash
ion trends, from clothes purchased at the Gap to
those bought at a local army-surplus store.
For some students, however, the latest in fashion
and comfort is wearing nothing at all.
If a new Stanford-based nude recreation group
catches on, students may be in for the cheapest fash
ion trend of their lives.
"Nude is not lewd," says Mark Yeager, a second
year doctoral student in chemistry. "Nude is natu
ral."
That is the slogan of the organization he is in the
process of forming â€” the Stanford Naturists. The
group is dedicated to promoting body acceptance
through nude recreation and protecting the right of
individuals to engage in such recreation on appropri
ate public lands, Yeager says.
Yeager peers through his blue-rimmed glasses,
brushing away his hair, which is clumsily held in a
ponytail. He says he wishes to further the naturist
lifestyle on campus.

"Basically, that means being able to go without
clothes when you want to," says Yeager. "It's the idea
of promoting a lifestyle where the only reasons we
wear clothes is out of necessity."
Yeager expects some opposition to his proposal.
"Around the country, people try to force their
ideas of morality on us," says Yeager. "That's not
what a free society is about. Sometimes they are con
fused as to what the community standards really
are."
Yeager laughs at the idea that nudity will promote
sex.
"Just because people are naked, it doesn't mean
that ail they're thinking about is sex," he says."The
idea is not that we discourage sex. We just don't take
a stand on it whatsoever."
He adds that he hopes that the Stanford Natur
ists will be able to change preconceptions of nudity
through education.
"We want to challenge society's idea that the nude
body is shameful. Most people who want to go
skinny-dipping just want to have fun," he savs.
