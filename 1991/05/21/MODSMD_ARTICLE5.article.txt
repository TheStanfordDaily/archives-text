# New Stanford Naturists strip away confinements of clothing
## 
### Leo Chu 
Style has always reflected comfort at Stanford.
Students can be seen readily sporting the latest fash
ion trends, from clothes purchased at the Gap to
those bought at a local army-surplus store.
For some students, however, the latest in fashion
and comfort is wearing nothing at all.
If a new Stanford-based nude recreation group
catches on, students may be in for the cheapest fash
ion trend of their lives.
"Nude is not lewd," says Mark Yeager, a second
year doctoral student in chemistry. "Nude is natu
ral."
That is the slogan of the organization he is in the
process of forming — the Stanford Naturists. The
group is dedicated to promoting body acceptance
through nude recreation and protecting the right of
individuals to engage in such recreation on appropri
ate public lands, Yeager says.
Yeager peers through his blue-rimmed glasses,
brushing away his hair, which is clumsily held in a
ponytail. He says he wishes to further the naturist
lifestyle on campus.

"Basically, that means being able to go without
clothes when you want to," says Yeager. "It's the idea
of promoting a lifestyle where the only reasons we
wear clothes is out of necessity."
Yeager expects some opposition to his proposal.
"Around the country, people try to force their
ideas of morality on us," says Yeager. "That's not
what a free society is about. Sometimes they are con
fused as to what the community standards really
are."
Yeager laughs at the idea that nudity will promote
sex.
"Just because people are naked, it doesn't mean
that ail they're thinking about is sex," he says."The
idea is not that we discourage sex. We just don't take
a stand on it whatsoever."
He adds that he hopes that the Stanford Natur
ists will be able to change preconceptions of nudity
through education.
"We want to challenge society's idea that the nude
body is shameful. Most people who want to go
skinny-dipping just want to have fun," he savs.
Robert Gregg, dean of Memo
rial Church, wishes Yeager well.
"No harm, no foul," says
Gregg. "I hope they don't have a
run-in with the law. For heaven's
sake, anything that promotes a
sense of body and self is not some
thing I want to ping on."
Hilary Jensen, who revived
Aurora, a feminist magazine, says
she approves of Yeager's efforts
only if the group pursues intellec
tual intentions.
"There's nothing wrong with
nudity promoting positive body
imaging," says Jensen. "Our puri
tanical society restrains us in so
many ways. We live in such a mild
climate anyway, that there really
isn't any need for clothes."
Drew Smith, editor of The
Stanford Review, a conservative
campus newspaper, is more cau
tious with his praise.
"If these people offend others,
then we have a problem," Smith
says. " They can do whatever they
like in the privacy of their homes,
but there are guidelines for public
places."
Yeager joined the Naturist
Society, an international organi
zation based in Wisconsin, after
being intrigued by a publication
called the World Guide to Nude
Beaches and Recreation. The
Naturist Society protects the
rights of individuals to practice
the naturist lifestyle on desig
nated public lands.
He thumbs through Nude and

Natural magazine, which special
izes in nude recreation. Pictures
of frolicking nude people of all
ages appear throughout the publi
cation.
"Nudism is very family ori
ented," he says, flipping through
another magazine. "Raising a
child that way frees him or her
from a lot of society's hang-ups."
He urges skeptics and those
who are simply curious to try
stripping off their clothing gradu
ally, when sleeping or when alone
in a room. Once they are more
comfortable, they should try
walking nude down an isolated
stretch of beach. He compares the
experience to a symbolic shedding
of societal values.
"One of the very center ideas of
body acceptance is that we should
be judged on our achievements
and our actions, not on how we
look," says Yeager, placing the
magazine on the table. "When
you strip away the clothing, you
strip away a lot of the rank."
The Stanford Naturists will
sponsor beach trips, hiking excur
sions and "canuding" — nude
canoeing. Winter activities are
also a possibility. Nude ice skating
and sledding might be a little
chilly, but Yeager says they
promise to be a different experi
ence.
Yeager says he is saddened that
his lifestyle is ridiculed or banned
rather than given a chance.
"The single most important
thing is to encourage people who
want to try skinny-dipping or the
naturist lifestyle," he says,
pulling on his yellow sweatshirt.
"Let them have the opportunity."

isn't any need for clothes."
Drew Smith, editor of The
Stanford Review, a conservative
campus newspaper, is more cau
tious with his praise.
"If these people offend others,
then we have a problem," Smith
says. " They can do whatever they
like in the privacy of their homes,
but there are guidelines for public
places."
Yeager joined the Naturist
Society, an international organi
zation based in Wisconsin, after
being intrigued by a publication
called the World Guide to Nude
Beaches and Recreation. The
Naturist Society protects the
rights of individuals to practice
the naturist lifestyle on desig
nated public lands.
He thumbs through Nude and

Natural magazine, which special
izes in nude recreation. Pictures
of frolicking nude people of all
ages appear throughout the publi
cation.
"Nudism is very family ori
ented," he says, flipping through
another magazine. "Raising a
child that way frees him or her
from a lot of society's hang-ups."
He urges skeptics and those
who are simply curious to try
stripping off their clothing gradu
ally, when sleeping or when alone
in a room. Once they are more
comfortable, they should try
walking nude down an isolated
stretch of beach. He compares the
experience to a symbolic shedding
of societal values.
"One of the very center ideas of
body acceptance is that we should
be judged on our achievements
and our actions, not on how we
look," says Yeager, placing the
magazine on the table. "When
you strip away the clothing, you
strip away a lot of the rank."
The Stanford Naturists will
sponsor beach trips, hiking excur
sions and "canuding" — nude
canoeing. Winter activities are
also a possibility. Nude ice skating
and sledding might be a little
chilly, but Yeager says they
promise to be a different experi
ence.
Yeager says he is saddened that
his lifestyle is ridiculed or banned
rather than given a chance.
"The single most important
thing is to encourage people who
want to try skinny-dipping or the
naturist lifestyle," he says,
pulling on his yellow sweatshirt.
"Let them have the opportunity."
