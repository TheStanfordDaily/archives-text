# Film documents young homeless
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Stanford alumna Charlotte Beyers returned yes
terday to belt the campus in the stomach.
Beyers, a documentary film maker, showed
"Shadow Children," a 54-minute documentary
about the plight of homeless adolescents in the Bay
Area, last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
She said she tries to be the voice of the homeless
children, but those featured in the documentary
were able to speak for themselves. "We looked for
articulate, bright kids . . . and we were lucky. Very,
very lucky."
Beyers said her film is called "Shadow Children"
because the children live in the shadows. "They
could be arrested, so we didn't give their names.
Most were rejected by their parents and can't go
home again. And most of them want to get off the
streets and find jobs. . . . They are just real people in
unfortunate situations."
It took Beyers more than eight months to select
the 12 "shadow children," whose ages range from 15
to 20. She emphasized that she did not rehearse the
children. "We just selected them very carefully."
And the selection process was just one of many
trials Beyers said she faced in filming her documen
tary. There is also an element of uncertainty.
"We were never sure if the kids would show up,"
Beyers explained. "It helped, though, spending a
long time getting to know them. I think it's really
important that they trust me — I couldn't take
advantage of them in any way.
"Survival on the streets is very difficult. People
take advantage of kids. They'll mug, rob and rape
them. There are incredible amounts of cruelty
toward kids," Beyers added. "It shows something is
desperately wrong with society
and the disintegration of families.
That's what 'Shadow Children' is
all about."
Beyers graduated from Stan
ford with a degree in English and
a master's in communication. She
is currently a journalist for The

London Times educational sup
plements and the president and
ownef Of Productions.
Her first film, "AIDS in your
school," earned a Silver Apple
award by the National Education
Film and Video Festivals.
Other past films include "A is
for AIDS," which is designed to
teach students about AIDS and
contains an interview with Ryan
White, and "Night Journey to
Crack," a docu-drama about

"three kids who leave a boring
party in suburbia in search of
track."
Beyers said she initially saw
the adolescent homelessness as a
very hopeless situation. "There
were a myriad of problems for
them to contend with. Life on the
streets is rough. Many of them
were on drugs and addicted to
alcohol, to protect them from the
cold. It's very difficult to sleep on
the street at night when you're

dead sober."
Yet Beyers found hope in her
project. "Despite all that, they
have a sense of humor. And they
themselves want to get off the
streets and get back into the
mainstream," she said.
"Shadow Children" is also a
story of success. For example, Jas
mine, one of the featured chil
dren, is now a student at UC-
Berkeley.
And LaVonda, a Native Ameri
can, went back to the reservation.
"She wants to start a clinic for
other homeless," Beyers said.
"She says she doesn't want to be a
drunk. She wants to go to col
lege."
