NeXT Computers give you the power of Unix
running on a I 5 MIPS 68040 processor.
But you can Ignore Unix If you want to:
the NextStep Interface makes the NeXT
as easy to use as a Macintosh. £
With TeX, an Ob|ectlve C++ compiler,
WrtteNow, and Mathematlca, among other
applications, you can do most of your work
on the NeXT without paying a cent for
additional software.
illij] Prices start at $3153
Bullt-ln Ethernet as well as third-party
software for X-Wlndows, DOS emulation,
and Macintosh connectivity allow you to
work together with other computers.
On the other hand, the performance and
functionality of third party software available
for the NeXT tend to run circles around the
same software on other platforms.
