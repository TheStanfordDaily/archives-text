# Fairness priority for senate chair
## 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
From writing speeches in Washing
ton to almost starving in Paris to host
ing XTV's "Lovelinks," new ASSU
senate chair Kevin Warsh brings a
wide variety of experiences to the
most powerful position in the senate.
A junior from Loudonville, N.Y.,

Warsh has also acted in commercials
and movies, founded a business selling
fluorescent bracelets and helped orga
nize the Students First party on cam
pus.
And he has developed a definite
philosophy concerning his new job. He
said he wants to "let senators be
responsible for the substance" while
concentrating his efforts on making

the meetings run smoothly.
Warsh chaired his first meeting last
night at the second meeting of the
22nd senate, immediately becoming
involved in several controversies.
In the election of the deputy senate
chair, Warsh's comments on behalf of
Students First graduate senator Neil

Kevin Warsh, the new ASSU senate chair, relaxes in Room 180 of the Law School, the site of senate meetings. He
says he wants to "let senators be responsible for the substance" while concentrating his efforts on making next
year's senate meetings run smoothly.
Crellin drew criticism. "I think he
was out of line," said senator
Jason Snyder, a freshman. "I hope
he does not speak out again in a
partisan manner."
But Snyder added that he
believes Warsh is doing a good job
administratively and that the
comments "could have been a
slip."
Warsh said he does not think
he spoke in favor of Crellin, who
won the election. It was men
tioned that Crellin might not have
time for the position because of
his graduate studies, and Warsh
said he "wanted to clarify that he
would have time to devote."
Also at last night's meeting,
senators expressed dissatisfaction
with Warsh's committee appoint
ments because there were no stu
dents of color on the appropria
tions committee.
Warsh said he made all of the
appointments according to sena
tor's preferences without consid
eration of race. "I stand 100 per
cent behind the rulings," he said.
"It seems that the bickering is
more the bickering of parties than
of individuals."
The fact that a lot of people are
angry at him, he said, means that
he had to make hard decisions.
But he said he believes he was fair
in his rulings and appointments.
Allowing debate
Warsh's experiences in the
1989-90 senate convinced him
that being fair and not favoring
either party should be the chair's
first priority, he said. In that sen
ate, People's Platform senators
overwhelmingly outnumbered his
own party's senators, and senate
chair Ed Sasaki was affiliated
with the People's Platform.
"The senate chair would do
these things that were completely
arbitrary," Warsh said, adding
that he was "angered by being
excluded from the process and not
being able to speak."
"I was not surprised that my
bills did not win with the makeup
of the senate, but I felt my ideas
were summarily excluded," he
said.
Graduate senator Doug Bone,
who was also in the senate last
year with Warsh, agreed that
some of Sasaki's rulings had been
"designed to stifle those in the

minority." Rules were violated
and changed, Bone said, and he
"came close to resigning over the
process."
But junior Barry Terrance,
who was a senator at the same
time, disagreed that Sasaki was
unfair. "The senate chair gave as
much time to speakers as was pos
sible without prolonging debate,"
he said. "I think he did a fair and
equitable job."
Warsh said that although every
senator will not get everything he
or she wants next year, "at least
they will know the process is cred
ible."
Remaining neutral
While he has ideas about the
direction the senate should take,
"I do not see my role as an active
voice for an agenda," Warsh said.
For example, he said he
believes the senate should limit
itself to working on campus
issues. However, "if the senate
decides they want to chart foreign
policy, I will not close debate. I will
let them do that even if it is con
trary to what I believe is best for
Stanford."
Because senators are chosen by
the students and the senate chair
is not, Warsh said he does not
believe he can speak for students.
"It is the senators' job to author
bills," he said.
Warsh said he ran for the sen
ate originally because of his sur
prise that an organization with
large financial resources and the
ability to serve students was not
well-respected. "I was trying to
respond to the question of 'why is
it such a joke?'" he said.
Senate chair election
Warsh was elected by next
year's senators May 9. The final
vote of 12-8 put him ahead of this
year's chair, Solina Kwan. Sena
tor Jason Moore and senior Keith
Rabois also ran for the position.
At the meeting to elect the
chair, several senators expressed
concern that Warsh would be
biased because of his affiliation
with Students First.
"I am sure that people were
apprehensive at first to vote for
someone associated with a party,"
Warsh said. But "all four (candi
dates] could be broken down that
way," he added.
Warsh said his goals include
"opening up the ASSU" by mak
ing records and information avail
able to students. He also plans to
make sure all senators have copies

of the ASSU Bylaws.
He added that a more relaxed
meeting atmosphere will make
long senate meetings more
tolerable. "If we can make these
meetings a bit more laid back . . .
then perhaps we can bring some
humor to things," he said.
Regarding next year's sena
tors, Warsh said he believes
"everyone seems particularly
motivated to getting the ASSU
back on track."
Widespread involvement
While at Stanford, Warsh has
also been involved as a Stanford
in-Government officer and as an
appointee to Stanford's Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility.
Despite his experiences in cam
pus politics and at Stanford in
Washington last spring, Warsh
said he does not see himself work
ing in the government after col
lege, although "politics may loom
in the distant future."
Instead, after getting a degree
in public policy next year, he plans
to go to law school and become a
trial attorney, he said.
And although Warsh brings
extensive political experience to
his new position, he has had
plenty of other interests. For
example, he hosted XTV's
"Lovelinks" his freshman year,
something he said he has spent
the last two years "trying to for
get."
Or there was his trip to Paris
last summer, when he got off the
airplane with a few friends and
"no jobs, no money and no place to
stay." Warsh spent three weeks
waiting tables and was almost
fired because he barely spoke
French.
He said that after "nearly
starving," he contacted a Stanford
alumnus who found him a "great
job" as a paralegal at a Paris law
firm, where he was able to prac
tice his French.
Warsh spent last spring as an
intern in Washington, D.C., with
the House Subcommittee on Elec
tions working on campaign finan
cial forms and helping write
speeches.
He also has acting experience.
When he was 7 years old, he
started doing local television com
mercials, he said. His biggest role,
however, was in the movie "Iron
weed" with Jack Nicholson and
Meryl Streep. Warsh played a
friend of Nicholson's character in
a flashback to his childhood.
