Syria, Lebanon to sign treaty
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — President Elias
Hrawi is scheduled to sign a sweeping treaty
agreement today with President Hafez Assad of
Syria that ties Lebanon's future to its powerful
neighbor.
Israeli officials, who strongly oppose the
treaty, accused Syria of "swallowing Lebanon."
Israel forces reportedly were bolstered in
southern Lebanon.
The treaty calls for Israel eventually to leave
the strip of land in southern Lebanon it holds
as a security zone to protect from guerrilla
attacks against its northern territories.
The peace plan is aimed at ending 16 years
of civil war and providing a framework for the
Lebanese government to restore its authority
over the country.
ANC unlikely to attend summit
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -
The African National Congress said yesterday
that new laws the government is expected to
issue to reduce black township violence proba
bly will not persuade it to attend a planned
peace summit.
Government officials who refused to be iden
tified said yesterday a new law probably will
bar spears and other "cultural weapons" from
rallies in townships that are declared unrest
areas because of chronic violence.
The ANC, the leading black nationalist
group, said the anticipated law would not meet
its demand for a ban on all weapons in public.
"Our position is that controlling them is not
the issue. They must go altogether," ANC
spokesman Patrick Lekota said.

which specifically exempted the pipeline com
pany from criminal prosecution or civil claims

accident.
