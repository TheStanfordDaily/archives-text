# Bomb kills former Indian prime minister

### 
SRIPERAMBUIHJR, India (AP) - A bomb hid
den in a flower pot yesterday killed former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the son and grandson of
prime ministers, as he campaigned in an election he
hoped would sweep the family dynasty back to
power.
No one claimed responsibility for the assassina
tion, which came about two hours after Gandhi
arrived in Madras, in southeastern India.
The bomb went off as Gandhi, who recently had
been shrugging off security guards, stepped from his
car into a throng of supporters who pressed garlands
of flowers on him in Sriperumbudur, a town 25 miles
southwest of Madras.
An Associated Press reporter saw the bomb
explode. United News of India said it was a remote
controlled device.
When word of the assassination spread, crowds
surged through the streets in Madras. Three buses
and several private vehicles were set on fire. Men
ripped election posters off the walls. Scattered vio
lence also was reported in New Delhi.
The government issued a "red alert," fearing an
eruption of violence like the one that swept parts of
India when Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was murdered by her Sikh bodyguards in
1984.
Smiling and waving to a crowd of 10,000 in a play
ing field, Gandhi had stepped out of his car and was
moving toward the dais when the bomb exploded,
almost at his feet.
The blast threw the 46-year-old leader of the
Congress Party to the ground and killed him
instantly.
Nine other victims lay around him. They included
seven police officers and members of the audience.
The explosion was followed by a small fire, which
was quickly extinguished by security men.
Gandhi's assassination raised immediate ques
tions about whether the election would continue — a
decision in the hands of Election Commissioner T.N.
Seshan. Seshan's deputy, D.S. Bagga, said: "I can't
comment. I can't say a word further to this."
There was no heir apparent to the 46-year-old
leader of the Congress Party, who had been trying to
fashion a political comeback in national elections
that began Monday and were to continue through
Sunday. Nearly 200 people have died in election vio
lence the past three days.
His death left his Congress Party, which has ruled
India for 40 of its 44 years of independence, without
a leader.
Gandhi had recently changed his personal style to
shed an image of aloofness, brushing aside security
guards to wade into crowds of people.
Gandhi knew he was taking a risk. He had sur
vived at least one previous assassination attempt in
1986, when an assailant fired a crude pistol at him

while he was laying a wreath at the monument to
Mohandas Gandhi, the father of the Indian indepen
dence movement and prophet of nonviolence.
In Washington, President Bush expressed shock.
"On a personal basis I mourn the loss," he told
reporters. "But when you look at his contribution to
international order and you think of his decency, it's
a tragedy. When people resort to ... violence of this
nature it's just appalling."
In New Delhi, Gandhi's home was cordoned off as
about 400 people gathered. Men and women sobbed
openly. "Say he's not dead, say it!" a distraught man
cried. Cars stretched a half-mile in both directions.
The body will be returned to New Delhi today.

Law and Justice Minister Subramanian Swamy
called the assassination "a ghastly act by anti
nationalist elements," and pledged to track down the
killers, United News of India reported.
A spokesman for the rival Janata Dal Party, S.
Jaipal Reddy, said the killing was a blow to Indian
democracy. "Indian politics without Rajiv Gandhi
infinitely poorer," he said.
The killing was reminiscent of the slaying of
Gandhi's mother.
Rajiv Gandhi, a former commercial airline pilot
who was then 40, was chosen within hours of his
mother's death to lead her party. In a wave of sympa
thy, Congress swept elections that year, winning a
stunning 92 percent of the seats in Parliament
He had not been groomed for leadership. Mrs.
Gandhi had been training her younger son, Sanjay,
to take over, but he was killed in the 1980 crash of a
small aircraft he was piloting.
John Kenneth Galbraith, ambassador to India
during President John F. Kennedy's administration,
said the assassination marks the end of a political
dynasty.
"The great grandfather, grandfather, mother and
now Rajiv were the dynasty," Galbraith said from his
office at Harvard University. "At least for the short
run, this is the end."
Rajiv Gandhi's great-grandather was Motilal
Nehru, a close associate of Mohandas Gandhi, and
his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was prime min
ister from 1947-64.
When he first took office, Gandhi appeared to
bring youthful energy and fresh, modern ideas to
government. But within a few years he became
entangled in India's notorious bureaucracy. Disillu
sionment and allegations of corruption in his party
contributed to his defeat five years later.
Before arriving at the rally where he was killed,
Gandhi laid a wreath on a statue of his mother, Press
Trust said. And shortly before the bomb attack, he
spoke of the outbreak of violence during the cam
paign for parliamentary elections now under way.
"I told you there will be plenty of violence during
these elections. Already the number of persons killed
is high," Press Trust quoted him as saying.
Even before Gandhi's assassination, the election
was the most violent in India's 44-year history as an
independent nation.
Army troops were called out to control riots in the
towns of Meerut, Varanasi, Kanpur and Deoband in
Uttar Pradesh state, Indian news agencies reported
Tuesday.
The Congress Party and the Janata Dal blamed
much of the violence on the Bharatiya Janata Party,
which campaigned on a platform of Hindu assertive
ness. The Bharatiya Janata Party denied the accusa
tions.

Seshan. Seshan's deputy, D.S. Bagga, said: "I can't
comment. I can't say a word further to this."
There was no heir apparent to the 46-year-old
leader of the Congress Party, who had been trying to
fashion a political comeback in national elections
that began Monday and were to continue through
Sunday. Nearly 200 people have died in election vio
lence the past three days.
His death left his Congress Party, which has ruled
India for 40 of its 44 years of independence, without
a leader.
Gandhi had recently changed his personal style to
shed an image of aloofness, brushing aside security
guards to wade into crowds of people.
Gandhi knew he was taking a risk. He had sur
vived at least one previous assassination attempt in
1986, when an assailant fired a crude pistol at him

while he was laying a wreath at the monument to
Mohandas Gandhi, the father of the Indian indepen
dence movement and prophet of nonviolence.
In Washington, President Bush expressed shock.
"On a personal basis I mourn the loss," he told
reporters. "But when you look at his contribution to
international order and you think of his decency, it's
a tragedy. When people resort to ... violence of this
nature it's just appalling."
In New Delhi, Gandhi's home was cordoned off as
about 400 people gathered. Men and women sobbed
openly. "Say he's not dead, say it!" a distraught man
cried. Cars stretched a half-mile in both directions.
The body will be returned to New Delhi today.

Law and Justice Minister Subramanian Swamy
called the assassination "a ghastly act by anti
nationalist elements," and pledged to track down the
killers, United News of India reported.
A spokesman for the rival Janata Dal Party, S.
Jaipal Reddy, said the killing was a blow to Indian
democracy. "Indian politics without Rajiv Gandhi
infinitely poorer," he said.
The killing was reminiscent of the slaying of
Gandhi's mother.
Rajiv Gandhi, a former commercial airline pilot
who was then 40, was chosen within hours of his
mother's death to lead her party. In a wave of sympa
thy, Congress swept elections that year, winning a
stunning 92 percent of the seats in Parliament
He had not been groomed for leadership. Mrs.
Gandhi had been training her younger son, Sanjay,
to take over, but he was killed in the 1980 crash of a
small aircraft he was piloting.
John Kenneth Galbraith, ambassador to India
during President John F. Kennedy's administration,
said the assassination marks the end of a political
dynasty.
"The great grandfather, grandfather, mother and
now Rajiv were the dynasty," Galbraith said from his
office at Harvard University. "At least for the short
run, this is the end."
Rajiv Gandhi's great-grandather was Motilal
Nehru, a close associate of Mohandas Gandhi, and
his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was prime min
ister from 1947-64.
When he first took office, Gandhi appeared to
bring youthful energy and fresh, modern ideas to
government. But within a few years he became
entangled in India's notorious bureaucracy. Disillu
sionment and allegations of corruption in his party
contributed to his defeat five years later.
Before arriving at the rally where he was killed,
Gandhi laid a wreath on a statue of his mother, Press
Trust said. And shortly before the bomb attack, he
spoke of the outbreak of violence during the cam
paign for parliamentary elections now under way.
"I told you there will be plenty of violence during
these elections. Already the number of persons killed
is high," Press Trust quoted him as saying.
Even before Gandhi's assassination, the election
was the most violent in India's 44-year history as an
independent nation.
Army troops were called out to control riots in the
towns of Meerut, Varanasi, Kanpur and Deoband in
Uttar Pradesh state, Indian news agencies reported
Tuesday.
The Congress Party and the Janata Dal blamed
much of the violence on the Bharatiya Janata Party,
which campaigned on a platform of Hindu assertive
ness. The Bharatiya Janata Party denied the accusa
tions.

Former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, shown
here in a photo taken in April, was killed in an
explosion yesterday during an election rally in
Tamil Nadu in southern India.
SRIPERAMBUIHJR, India (AP) - A bomb hid
den in a flower pot yesterday killed former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the son and grandson of
prime ministers, as he campaigned in an election he
hoped would sweep the family dynasty back to
power.
No one claimed responsibility for the assassina
tion, which came about two hours after Gandhi
arrived in Madras, in southeastern India.
The bomb went off as Gandhi, who recently had
been shrugging off security guards, stepped from his
car into a throng of supporters who pressed garlands
of flowers on him in Sriperumbudur, a town 25 miles
southwest of Madras.
An Associated Press reporter saw the bomb
explode. United News of India said it was a remote
controlled device.
When word of the assassination spread, crowds
surged through the streets in Madras. Three buses
and several private vehicles were set on fire. Men
ripped election posters off the walls. Scattered vio
lence also was reported in New Delhi.
The government issued a "red alert," fearing an
eruption of violence like the one that swept parts of
India when Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was murdered by her Sikh bodyguards in
1984.
Smiling and waving to a crowd of 10,000 in a play
ing field, Gandhi had stepped out of his car and was
moving toward the dais when the bomb exploded,
almost at his feet.
The blast threw the 46-year-old leader of the
Congress Party to the ground and killed him
instantly.
Nine other victims lay around him. They included
seven police officers and members of the audience.
The explosion was followed by a small fire, which
was quickly extinguished by security men.
Gandhi's assassination raised immediate ques
tions about whether the election would continue — a
decision in the hands of Election Commissioner T.N.
Seshan. Seshan's deputy, D.S. Bagga, said: "I can't
comment. I can't say a word further to this."
