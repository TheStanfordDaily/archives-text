# Ethiopia's Marxist president resigns; war, famine persist

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopiu (AP)
— With rebels advancing,
Ethiopia's Marxist President
Mengistu Haile Mariam resigned
and fled into exile yesterday, end
ing an iron-fisted 14-year rule
over his impoverished country.
The White House welcomed
Mengistu's departure. Spokesman
Roman Popadiuk said the Bush
administration hoped "the door is
open for the realization of peace
and democracy" in Ethiopia,
which has been beset by famine as
well as war.
State radio said a former
defense minister, Lt. Gen. Tesfaye
Gebre-Kidan, had taken over as
acting president of this Horn of
Africa nation. The government
said it would try to arrange a
cease-fire with the rebels, who
had long been seeking Mengistu's
ouster and an end to human
rights abuses.
Residents of this capital city
reacted with no outward signs of
glee or panic to the news that the
widely despised Mengistu, 49, had
left power.
Rebel leaders, whose fighters
control the northern third of
Ethiopia, expressed skepticism

about the government's readiness
to change, and vowed to continue
fighting.
But the insurgents said they
would attend U.S.-brokered peace
talks, which were to begin Mon
day in London. The rebels say
they want to negotiate a broad
based transitional government
that would hold elections.
Diplomats in the capital, Addis
Ababa, said Mengistu's departure
improved prospects for the peace
negotiations. "This should give
great impetus to the upcoming
talks," said one, speaking on con
dition of anonymity.
The United States and most
Western European nations had
quietly urged his departure to
help along the peace talks, and the
rebel groups had made his ouster
a virtual pre-condition for an end
to years of hostilities.
In recent months, Mengistu's
army, the largest in sub-Saharan
Africa, has suffered one humiliat
ing defeat after another at the
hands of rebels. Heavy fighting
raged yesterday for a sixth
straight day north and west of the
capital, Addis Ababa, with insur
gents moving to within 40 miles of

the city.
However, the rebels have said
they have no intention of trying to
march on the capital.
A Tigrean rebel spokesman
described Tesfaye, the general
now in charge, as having been
Mengistu's right-hand man and
responsible for government mili
tary strategy.
The spokesman, Asefa Mamo,
said from London that Mengistu's
departure simply removed "one
evil person" and didn't signifi
cantly change the government.
In 1984, he came under heavy
international criticism for ignor
ing a famine in Ethiopia's north in
which tens of thousands of people
died. He finally backed a huge
relief effort supported by rock
stars, the United Nations and
Western governments.
Ethiopia is again battling a
famine, which it estimates threat
ens as many as 7.3 million people.
It has appealed for 1.1 million
tons of emergency food, but only
about half of that has been
pledged. The scarce food supplies
in the country have been halted by
the recent fighting.

by an international relief agency in Towfik. He is one of many villagers displaced by fighting between
government and rebel troops north and west of Addis Ababa, the capital. The resignation of Etiopia's
Marxist president yesterday may facilitate the peace talks scheduled to begin in London Monday.
