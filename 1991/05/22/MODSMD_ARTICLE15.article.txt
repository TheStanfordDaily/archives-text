## 'Res Edual' benefits 
### 
Myth of Res Ed agenda
must be dispelled; RAs
a unique Stanford asset

Everyone loves to bash
the Office of Residential
Education. One of the most
enduring stereotypes at Stanford is
that of the overzealous resident
assistant: someone who pretends to
be everybody's best friend, coerces
residents into attending an endless
stream of only marginally interest
ing programs and shoves a politi
cally correct, "multicultural"
agenda down the throats of unwill
ing freshmen.
Since Res Ed maintains a high
profile and tries to reach literally
every undergraduate on campus, it
is an easy target for such criticism.
But the critics would do well to
pause a moment and consider how
they may have benefited — and
perhaps even learned — from Res
Ed's comprehensive program.
Imagine for a second what Stan
ford's dorm life would be like with
out RAs. How much less would you
learn if there were no RAs to bring
programs into the dormitory and
encourage residents to discuss the
myriad issues they raise? How well
would your dormitory bond
together, and how many dorm trips
and events would occur if it weren't
for the leadership and encourage
ment the RAs provide? And how
less comfortable would dorm life be
without having someone who you
know will listen to you if you just
feel like talking?
At most universities around the
country, these questions are far
from hypothetical. Usually, RAs
are simply seniors with pass keys,
or worse, they are "policemen" who
patrol the dorms watching for
underage drinking and other
infractions of university policy.

Stanford is unique in its
approach: RAs put education and
counseling first and dorm unity
and camaraderie second. Enforce
ment isn't even on the agenda.
These priorities — and the success
with which they are fulfilled —
make Res Ed an exceptional and
admirable organization.
This is not to say the criticism of
Res Ed is completely unfounded.
Officially, RAs are supposed to fos
ter free and open discussion of any
issue and accept all viewpoints as
equally valid. In practice, however,
some RAs occasionally stifle cer
tain opinions and alienate those
who hold them. This suppression
of opinion runs counter to the basic
premise of "residential education,"
since an alienated resident neither
learns from others nor helps others
to learn.
Res Ed's programs should bring
in different points of view that
might not be generally accepted on
campus. It is sometimes too easy
for RAs to be satisfied with "safe"
topics for their programs. While
"standard" programs that bring
the Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual Speak
ers' Bureau to the dorm or teach
responsible drinking are impor
tant, especially in freshman dorms,
the most memorable and educa
tional programs are frequently the
more unusual and innovative ones.
But intolerant RAs and stale
programs are not nearly as com
mon as conventional wisdom would
lead one to believe. RAs work hard
to make everyone in the residence
feel included, and the results are
usually obvious by the end of the
first quarter. Likewise, most dor
mitories have their share of cre
ative programming that attracts a
diverse range of students. If Res
Ed's critics remain unappreciative
of these services, they are being
unfair to an admirable organiza
tion, and they are missing many
invaluable opportunities to grow
and learn.
