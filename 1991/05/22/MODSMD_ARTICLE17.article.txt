## Postcards from the past 
### 
THE POSTCARD CHIDED, gently
but humorously, "Hey man! It's
been tooooo long!" and I agreed. I
hadn't written to Charley, my best friend
from high school, for months, and I owed
him more than a couple of letters. It was
about time I wrote back.
And I really meant to. When I got
home from class that afternoon I started
a letter and managed a paragraph before
I had to go to dinner, then visit some
friends, then study, then sleep. I was too
busy the next day to write anything at all,
but I promised myself I'd get it done as
soon as possible.
Which means, of course, that the letter
is still waiting, patiently, unfinished, in a
heap of books and papers on my floor. I'm
just too busy, I keep telling myself, too
busy to write letters, too busy to keep up
with everybody . . .
It's only in the brief moments when
self-delusion lifts that I admit to myself
that being busy has nothing to do with it
at all.
Sure, I have seven papers due in the
next three weeks. And tests to take. And
meetings to go to. But can I sincerely
plead that I'm too busy to write a two
page letter when I can find six hours to
devote to a conversation in a dorm hall
way on the relative merits of Stuart Reges
and Donald Kennedy?
The truth is that even the mundane
elements of my new life at school have
become more important than almost all
elements of my old one, and that my old
friends, however wonderful they are and
however much I love them, have begun to
slip away.

It could be worse, I suppose. Plenty of
people here have told me that they don't
have any friends left from high school at
all. I at least like to think that there are
three or four people back home I'll always
be able to say anything to.
But my relationships with them have
changed, subtly but fundamentally, and
no amount of wishful thinking can do
anything to alter that fact.
When we talk on the phone, we stum
ble and pause and grope for conversa
tional material we can both relate to. Ivy
League gossip is interesting, in its way,
but how much can I possibly be expected
to care about people, places and events
I've never seen? And what can life at
Stanford mean to someone who's never
been to California?
Actually seeing old friends is better,
but not much. It takes time to pick up
where you left off with someone you
haven't seen for six months. Once awk
wardness has been put aside and old inti
macy regained, it's time again to go your
separate ways.
My friends here have the simple, sig
nificant advantage of being here. I don't
like them any better than my friends back
east, but on a day-to-day basis, they mat
ter more. They're part of my life, of
what's happening now, of what I care
most about; my friends back home just
aren't.
At times, this dual residency in the
worlds of home and college can be almost
schizophrenia-inducing. When friends
from home have visited me at Stanford,
for example, I've been almost completely
lost.

How do I balance my time between my
new friends and the old ones? How do I
bring in an outside person without upset
ting my carefully established social order?
And what do we talk about at the dinner
table? Silly concerns, maybe, but rele
vant.
People say that college friends are the
ones we'll keep for life, that the bonds
made in these four years are somehow
more lasting, but I don't quite see how.
All I can foresee is a repetition of the pro
cess we went through at the end of high
school, with a geographical dispersion
that will turn most of our friendships into
sporadic visits and greeting cards at
major holidays.
My parents, for all their time spent in
school, have regular contact with one
friend from college, and none from high
school. Their closest friends are their co
workers and neighbors — the people who
play a significant role in their day-to-day
lives.
In the end, writing back to Charley
seems almost pointless: We're doomed to
keep drifting apart, so why bother? I
probably wouldn't bother if I didn't
think, somewhere in the back of my head,
that a friendship based on the shared
memories an occasional phone call or let
ter can evoke just might not be all that
bad.

Ed Heinemann's chop stick is bigger than
Andy's and Kofi's combined.
