Dollars better spent helping kids than placing bets

WHILE WORKING ON Operation
Lilypad, I heard that some peo
ple on campus are betting
against the completion of our initial goal
of 1,000 miles. It is unfortunate that
people will wish us to fail just so they
can make a buck; more unfortunate is
that these people are overlooking the
real goal of our efforts.
Breaking the world record is not our
focus; it is merely a means of gaining
support and publicity for our fund-rais
ing effort. We are trying to raise $10,000
for the Creative Adventures Learning
Center. While tutoring for the center,
many of us have realized the poor state
of education in East Palo Alto, especially
when compared to that in its counter-

part, Palo Alto.
We are not the only ones to recognize
the disparity between the two cities; the
San Francisco Chronicle asserted the
same in their April 22 edition. The arti
cle ranked 98 Bay Area communities on
a scale of one to 98, one being the best,
based on health care, business, educa
tion, crime and other criteria. Palo Alto
was ranked first, but East Palo Alto was
ranked 96th, the worst ranking for an
urban community.
Furthermore, East Palo Alto was
98th, the worst ranking, in education,
health care and crime. To rectify this
unjust situation, East Palo Alto schools,
the Creative Adventures Learning Cen
ter included, need all of Stanford's and

Palo Alto's support, not just the backing
of the 80 freshmen in Trancos, a mere
0.5 percent of the Stanford student body.
Our case needs a lot of community
support, both moral and financial. It
doesn't take much money to make a dif
ference, just some effort. If 5,000 stu
dents, faculty members, etc. were to put
just $3 in the jar in front of our tent it
would add up to $15,000. If you are
unwilling or unable to come during the
week to support us, we are having a com
munity party at Wilbur Field on Satur
day, May 25 from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m.
The children of the Creative Adven
tures Learning Center will be present, so
you can see the faces of the people you
will be helping. Our cause is noble, and

our efforts are sincere, so please aid us in
changing the lives of East Palo Alto chil
dren.
For the people betting against us, I
think your efforts would be much better
spent donating the money to the Cre
ative Adventures Learning Center. The
focus should be on the children, not on
our efforts to break the record.
After all, we are the privileged, and
the children we are helping do not have
the same opportunities we have been
afforded. We are just trying to make a
difference in this world, idealistic as it
may seem.

State law regarding psychotherapy unduly intrusive

DIANA CONKLIN'S MAY 16 letter
to The Daily about the confiden
tiality of students visiting Cowell
Student Health Center or Stanford Hos
pital is right, but only up to a point.
Such a visit would not be reported to the
local police, but if it resulted in a hospi
talization for psychiatric reasons, a new
state law requires that the patient's
name and the hospitalization be reported
to the State Department of Justice in
Sacramento.
What Conklin does not know —
indeed, what most local psychiatrists and
psychologists did not know until just a
few weeks ago — is that in January, new
laws concerning background checks for
the purchase of handguns came into
effect. These laws require reporting to
Sacramento all admissions of patients to
mental hospitals or to psychiatric units
in general hospitals, whether the admis
sion is voluntary (with the patient's con
sent) or involuntary (legally enforced
admission under a 72-hour hold on

grounds that the patient is dangerous to
self — usually meaning suicidal — or to
others). In the case of the hospital, this
covers admissions to wards NOB or G-2
or transfers from medicine, surgery or
the emergency room (for instance, after
treatment of an overdose) to either of
those wards.
These laws apply equally to members
of the Stanford community (students,
faculty, staff and their families) or any
one else being admitted to a psychiatric
unit. The hospital, in consultation with
the University legal staff, is formulating
a response to the laws.
Many mental health professionals are
alarmed and outraged by this intrusion
by government into what is basically a
confidential matter between patient and
psychotherapist. Many of us in the
Department of Psychiatry in the Medical
School, at Counseling and Psychological
Services, at Cowell and in private prac
tice in the Palo Alto area are working for
the repeal of these laws, as are members

of the California Psychiatric Association.
The hospital and the University are
also considering the constitutional and
civil rights issues involved, much as the
University recently and successfully
opposed drug testing of student athletes
as an unwarranted invasion of privacy;
neither the University nor the hospital
has yet promulgated a position on these
new laws.
Particularly alarming to a university
community should be the fact that stu
dents in professional schools may be
applying to Sacramento for licensure in
years to come; fitness to practice one's
profession is often part of the licensure
process, and there is no predicting what
misadventures could take place with
information in a computer bank admin
istered by lawyers, police and mail-room
clerks about a student's (or anyone
else's) admission to a hospital psychiatric
unit. Past experience with government
surveillance over private citizens engag
ing in entirely legal activities is hardly

reassuring.
About a year ago, a Stanford profes
sional school student was admitted to
one of our psychiatric units on a 72-hour
hold (the student had been dazed and
confused, and friends feared serious
harm might result). After recovering, the
student asked whether the admission
would be kept confidential, and in good
conscience, I was able to say, "Yes."
Today I would have to say, "No."
I think these laws are obnoxious to
the humane and proper practice of
medicine, psychiatry, psychology and
related professions. I hope both the hos
pital and the University will take a
stand in opposing them. While they are
on the books, however, hospital-based
psychiatric treatment is no longer the
private and confidential matter it used to
be.

conscience, I was able to say, "Yes."
Today I would have to say, "No."
I think these laws are obnoxious to
the humane and proper practice of
medicine, psychiatry, psychology and
related professions. I hope both the hos
pital and the University will take a
stand in opposing them. While they are
on the books, however, hospital-based
psychiatric treatment is no longer the
private and confidential matter it used to
be.

Dollars better spent helping kids than placing bets

WHILE WORKING ON Operation
Lilypad, I heard that some peo
ple on campus are betting
against the completion of our initial goal
of 1,000 miles. It is unfortunate that
people will wish us to fail just so they
can make a buck; more unfortunate is
that these people are overlooking the
real goal of our efforts.
Breaking the world record is not our
focus; it is merely a means of gaining
support and publicity for our fund-rais
ing effort. We are trying to raise $10,000
for the Creative Adventures Learning
Center. While tutoring for the center,
many of us have realized the poor state
of education in East Palo Alto, especially
when compared to that in its counter-

part, Palo Alto.
We are not the only ones to recognize
the disparity between the two cities; the
San Francisco Chronicle asserted the
same in their April 22 edition. The arti
cle ranked 98 Bay Area communities on
a scale of one to 98, one being the best,
based on health care, business, educa
tion, crime and other criteria. Palo Alto
was ranked first, but East Palo Alto was
ranked 96th, the worst ranking for an
urban community.
Furthermore, East Palo Alto was
98th, the worst ranking, in education,
health care and crime. To rectify this
unjust situation, East Palo Alto schools,
the Creative Adventures Learning Cen
ter included, need all of Stanford's and

Palo Alto's support, not just the backing
of the 80 freshmen in Trancos, a mere
0.5 percent of the Stanford student body.
Our case needs a lot of community
support, both moral and financial. It
doesn't take much money to make a dif
ference, just some effort. If 5,000 stu
dents, faculty members, etc. were to put
just $3 in the jar in front of our tent it
would add up to $15,000. If you are
unwilling or unable to come during the
week to support us, we are having a com
munity party at Wilbur Field on Satur
day, May 25 from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m.
The children of the Creative Adven
tures Learning Center will be present, so
you can see the faces of the people you
will be helping. Our cause is noble, and

our efforts are sincere, so please aid us in
changing the lives of East Palo Alto chil
dren.
For the people betting against us, I
think your efforts would be much better
spent donating the money to the Cre
ative Adventures Learning Center. The
focus should be on the children, not on
our efforts to break the record.
After all, we are the privileged, and
the children we are helping do not have
the same opportunities we have been
afforded. We are just trying to make a
difference in this world, idealistic as it
may seem.

State law regarding psychotherapy unduly intrusive

DIANA CONKLIN'S MAY 16 letter
to The Daily about the confiden
tiality of students visiting Cowell
Student Health Center or Stanford Hos
pital is right, but only up to a point.
Such a visit would not be reported to the
local police, but if it resulted in a hospi
talization for psychiatric reasons, a new
state law requires that the patient's
name and the hospitalization be reported
to the State Department of Justice in
Sacramento.
What Conklin does not know —
indeed, what most local psychiatrists and
psychologists did not know until just a
few weeks ago — is that in January, new
laws concerning background checks for
the purchase of handguns came into
effect. These laws require reporting to
Sacramento all admissions of patients to
mental hospitals or to psychiatric units
in general hospitals, whether the admis
sion is voluntary (with the patient's con
sent) or involuntary (legally enforced
admission under a 72-hour hold on

grounds that the patient is dangerous to
self — usually meaning suicidal — or to
others). In the case of the hospital, this
covers admissions to wards NOB or G-2
or transfers from medicine, surgery or
the emergency room (for instance, after
treatment of an overdose) to either of
those wards.
These laws apply equally to members
of the Stanford community (students,
faculty, staff and their families) or any
one else being admitted to a psychiatric
unit. The hospital, in consultation with
the University legal staff, is formulating
a response to the laws.
Many mental health professionals are
alarmed and outraged by this intrusion
by government into what is basically a
confidential matter between patient and
psychotherapist. Many of us in the
Department of Psychiatry in the Medical
School, at Counseling and Psychological
Services, at Cowell and in private prac
tice in the Palo Alto area are working for
the repeal of these laws, as are members

of the California Psychiatric Association.
The hospital and the University are
also considering the constitutional and
civil rights issues involved, much as the
University recently and successfully
opposed drug testing of student athletes
as an unwarranted invasion of privacy;
neither the University nor the hospital
has yet promulgated a position on these
new laws.
Particularly alarming to a university
community should be the fact that stu
dents in professional schools may be
applying to Sacramento for licensure in
years to come; fitness to practice one's
profession is often part of the licensure
process, and there is no predicting what
misadventures could take place with
information in a computer bank admin
istered by lawyers, police and mail-room
clerks about a student's (or anyone
else's) admission to a hospital psychiatric
unit. Past experience with government
surveillance over private citizens engag
ing in entirely legal activities is hardly

reassuring.
About a year ago, a Stanford profes
sional school student was admitted to
one of our psychiatric units on a 72-hour
hold (the student had been dazed and
confused, and friends feared serious
harm might result). After recovering, the
student asked whether the admission
would be kept confidential, and in good
conscience, I was able to say, "Yes."
Today I would have to say, "No."
I think these laws are obnoxious to
the humane and proper practice of
medicine, psychiatry, psychology and
related professions. I hope both the hos
pital and the University will take a
stand in opposing them. While they are
