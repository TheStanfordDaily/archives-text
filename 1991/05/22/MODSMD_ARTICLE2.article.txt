# Indians upset over Gandhi's murder

### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Shocked and saddened by yesterday's
assassination of former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, many Indian
students and faculty expressed concern
that the death would further splinter
the divided country.
Gandhi's assassination marks the
end of a political dynasty that began
with his grandfather, Jawaharlal
Nehru, who was India's first prime min
ister.
Prasad Akella, a graduate student in
mechanical engineering and a former
president of the Stanford India Associa
tion, said his initial reaction was "disbe

lief" and then "concern about the turn
of political events in the country."
"We'll be in a state of limbo," Akella
said. "It means hard times for another
year."
Other students and faculty were con
cerned about the political fragmentation
that may result.
"This is going to create a major
mess," said Mukund Subramanian, a
graduate student in anthropology.
"India is in a state of havoc."
"Gandhi was the closest there was to
a national leader," said History Prof.
Mark Mancall, who is teaching a course
on modern India this quarter. He noted
that all of the other candidates are prod
ucts of "provincial politics, but Gandhi

is a national politician."
One professor compared the Gandhi
family's tragic history to the Kennedy
family's.
"His family has had a very troubled
past. You can draw some parallels with
the Kennedys," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Krishna Saraswat. "I am
really shocked and very sad."
His mother, former Indian prime
minister Indira Gandhi, was assassi
nated in 1984, and his brother Sanjay
was killed in a plane crash in 1980.
Gandhi took over as prime minister
after his mother was assassinated and
served until his Congress Party was
defeated in 1989, largely due to
charges of corruption.
His party had been expected to
win the staggered Indian elec
tions that began Monday and
were to have concluded Sunday.
After the assassination, however,
the government immediately
postponed for three weeks the
remaining two days of the elec
tions.
The Congress Party will proba
bly still win the election,
Saraswat said, although he
expressed concern that candi
dates jockeying for Gandhi's posi

tion may split the party into fac
tions, damaging its ability to stay
at the center of Indian politics.
Gandhi's best asset was his
attempt to modernize India,
Saraswat said. "The good thing
about him was that he was trying
to drive toward modern, high
technology industry. He had some
good ideas."
But Bruce Bueno de Mesquita,
a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, said Gandhi's assassi
nation "will not have a lasting
effect on Indian politics." Bueno
de Mesquita has written two
books and several articles on
issues in Indian politics and has
done extensive field work in the
country.
"He was a weak political

leader," Bueno de Mesquita said.
"He was not someone with strong
political beliefs — he believed
mainly in winning."
Bueno de Mesquita added,
however, "Any assassination is
very horrible and is not the way to
solve differences."
The students and professors
were divided on what the assassi
nation means for democracy in
India.
Saraswat was pessimistic. "I
hope that democracy survives in
India," he said. "Unless there is
strong leadership, the country
can go into a tailspin." He added
that the United States should do
whatever it can to help the coun
try.
Subramanian said the assassi

nation "proves that there wasn't
a democracy in the first place."
He noted the continuing presence
of violence in the process.
This year's elections have been
the most violent in India's 44
years of independence. Nearly
200 people have died in election
violence.
But Bueno de Mesquita and
Mancall said India's democracy
would survive.
"Indian democracy has 40
years of strong tradition," Man
call said. "It won't collapse; it's
pretty deeply embedded in the
culture."
Bueno de Mesquita agreed that
India has "a genuine, functioning
democracy, and that will con
tinue."
