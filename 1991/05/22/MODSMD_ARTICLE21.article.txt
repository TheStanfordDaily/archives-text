## Quake survey may assist studies of trauma 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
"I was in the right spot at the right time,"
says Etzel Cardena about the Earthquake of
1989, the 7.1 earthquake that rocked the Bay
Area.
Sound a little unusual? It would seem to
most people that Stanford was definitely the
wrong place to be on Oct. 17, 1989, when
buildings and nerves shook all over campus.
But for Cardena, the quake provided a rare
opportunity to research people's responses to
disasters.
Cardena, a research fellow in the Depart
ment of Psychiatry, seized the opportunity to
conduct a long-term, multiple-survey experi
ment involving people who experienced the
earthquake.
Cardena co-authored his study with Dr.
David Spiegel, associate professor of psychia
try. They presented their results at last week's
annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association.
"I had just completed a review of the litera
ture about reactions to disasters and had com
piled a checklist of nearly 100 responses to dis
asters," said Cardena. "I had the checklist in
my hand."
According to Cardena, most of the research
about reactions to disasters has surveyed peo
ple months or even years after the event. Car
dena believes that his project is one of the few

tunnel.

investigatiorls to begin to contact subjects
within a week of a disaster.
Many subjects reported feeling detached
from their bodies, and others said that they
experienced unusual sensations such as spin
ning or falling down a tunnel.
Over 50 percent of the subjects felt that
time had slowed down, and 40 percent
reported that personal experiences sometimes
seemed to be happening at a psychological dis
tance, almost as if they were appearing on tele
vision.
"Almost everyone said they were function
ing like robots. That was a very common
response," said Cardena.
"These were mentally healthy people," said
Cardena. People should be assured that these
reactions can "happen to normal people and
they're not crazy."
The study involved 101 graduate students,
50 of them Medical School students. The stu
dents completed two surveys, the first within

one week of the earthquake and the second
four months later. Most of the unusual experi
ences seemed to have subsided by the second
survey.
Cardena feels the findings are important
for several reasons.
"First, it is important to note that normal
people — that is, assuming that Stanford grad
uate students are 'normal' — will experience
many seemingly unusual responses to
trauma," he said.
"Secondly, these findings may help in post
disaster therapy and counseling efforts," Car
dena continued. "By making people aware of
these responses, it may make them feel more
at ease with them."
Cardena suggests that many of these
responses are natural coping mechanisms
which help people overcome their distress and
allow them to avoid being overwhelmed.
Other Stanford researchers were also quick
to investigate responses to the quake. Kent
Harber, a graduate student in psychology con
ducted telephone interviews with nearly 800
people in the area after the quake.
According to Cardena, his "checklist" for
mat should supplement interview investiga
tions because sometimes people fail to volun
teer information about specific experiences
unless they are directly asked.
"I'm not saying that I'm glad Ithe earth
quake] happened, but since it did, I'm glad I
could take advantage of it."
