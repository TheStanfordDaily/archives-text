# Changes in store for biomedical industry

In the highly technological
and fiercely competitive world
of biomedical products, the
United States leads the way,
noted Ray Gilmartin, chief
executive officer at Becton-
Dickinson, in his speech at the
Graduate School of Business
last Thursday night.
But U.S. companies' pri
mary advantage in the biomed
ical industry — ready access to
a large population — will soon
be shared by European com
petitors. With their growing
markets will come increased
revenues, which the European
firms will be able to devote to
higher levels of research and
product development.
Speaking about opportuni
ties for health care companies
in the Soviet Union and East
ern Europe, Gilmartin
described the role of the United

States in such major growth
markets as Europe, Japan,
Latin America and the Soviet
Union, among other areas.
This role varies greatly from
country to country, depending
on the medical progress and
medical needs of each area.
In Europe, the United
States is focusing mainly on
improving its methods of phys
ically distributing medical
products. Smaller companies
are consolidating with larger
ones, minor product differ
ences are disappearing and
manufacturing plants are
developing worldwide-standard
products.
In the Asia-Pacific, the
United States is dealing with a
high demand for health care
products. In Brazil and Mexico,
trade barriers are coming
down.
Meanwhile, the U.S. partici

pation in the Soviet Union and
the Eastern Bloc will involve
relief of medical problems first,
with distribution and sales of
medical supplies following.
Involvement in that region by
U.S. biomedical firms will be rela
tively long-term, Gilmartin pre
dicted.
The U.S. objective to gain
larger shares of international
growth markets will involve
introducing new products simul
taneously in Japan, Europe and
the United States.
The decreased per capita
wealth in the Asia-Pacific, the
decreased trade barriers in Japan
and Latin America and the
decreased political barriers in the

Soviet Union have all brought
new international opportunities.
Returning his focus to the LIS.
health care system, Gilmartin
stressed that its two main bene
fits to the citizens, access and
affordability, are only available to
a certain percentage of the popu
lation.
"For 87 percent of the popula
tion we have the best health care
available in the world, but for the
other 13 percent of t he populat ion
there are real serious problems
with access and affordability,"
Gilmartin revealed.
He cited as incorrect the view
point that biotechnological
advances are causing increases in
the cost of health care.
"I think the real struggle here
is how to preserve all the good
aspects of our health care system
while increasing access and
affordability to the 33 million

Americans who are uninsured.
"It's hard to pick up any argu
ment about health care costs
without a raise in expensive med
ical technology not being flagged
as one of the major contributors
to increases in health care cost . .
. There is very little understand
ing in the role that medical tech
nology plays in cost,"he said
Major improvements in Amer
ica's health care have involved,
among other things, innovation
in.medical techniques for services
such as cataract and gall bladder
surgery. The growth of medical
technology has helped reduce
these operations from large- to
small-scale procedures.
"Advances in medical technol
ogy have offered great advantages
in the quality of life," Gilmartin
affirmed. "The benefits of tech
nology are becoming more and
more apparent."
