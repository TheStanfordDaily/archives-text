# The 						'real thing' for safer sex: Coca-Cola kills sperm on contact
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
You know, it's amazing how lit
tle you can accomplish when you
really put your mind to it.
Not that my procrastination is
entirely my fault. It is spring, you
know — the season of baseball,
blooming flowers, hockey playoffs
(hockey playoffs?) and love. Or
sex, anyway. The Daily's been
filled with columns and articles
about sex for weeks now, ever
since that great survey that tried
to tell me that three-quarters of
Stanford's student body is "sexu
ally active."
Of course, according to the sur
vey, you were sexually active if
you'd had sex within the past aca
demic vear. Come on, if the last

time you'd had sex was in Septem
ber, would you consider yourself
sexually active? Would you still
remember it?
Well, of course you would —
you've probably written a short
story and an operetta about the
experience, not to mention rented
"Ghost" a bunch of times to try
and make yourself feel better.
(You may not be having any fun,
but at least you're not Demi
Moore with a bad haircut.)
And if the last time you really
had sex was in September, what
the hell are you doing sitting
around reading this?
Anyhow . . . one of the best
ways to procrastinate in my hum
ble household is to go into the
kitchen, where other people are
always standing around procrasti

nating. It's so obvious. They have
that I-should-be-in-Meyer-but-it
looks-like-it-might-rain-and-my-
bike-doesn't-have-fenders-and-I-
hate-it-I-just-hate-it-when-I-ride-
in-the-rain-and-all-the-muddy-
splechy-junk-spews-up-all-over-
my-back look, and they're usually
eating something that will imme
diately raise their cholesterol level
by 200 points and possibly cause
their skin to pulse like Jeff Gold
blum's did in"The Fly." (Hey,
remember that I'm a bug — I'm
supposed to like stuff like that.)
Once one person takes the ini
tiative to begin procrastinating in
the kitchen at night, other people
always follow. It's the lemming
philosophy: We might all be in the
kitchen singeing off our body hair
with burning shish kebab spears,

and someone will walk right in,
drop her backpack and join us
without a second thought.
"What's up?"
"We're trying to burn off just
one line of arm hair."
"Oh, I did this once in high
school. Pass me the matches."
Better that than start working on
that computer program.
Last night was no different. We
were talking. We were sharing. We
were bonding as a community.
And then someone (no need to
embarrass her further, at least not
unless the photos come out)
asked, "Hey, do you guys know
that Coke kills sperm on contact?"
Well, we didn't know, naive
fools that we were, and heated dis
cussion ensued. Why would it do
such a thing? What about Diet

Coke? And most importantly, does
this mean it's both an EANAB
and a birth control device? Do we
have to label it as such at our next
party?
I have the forum, and I cer
tainly have the time, so I may as
well throw in my proverbial two
cents on the matter. (Although
Coke might dissolve them, too.)
Somebody at Harvard Medical
School actually got federal fund
ing to study this phenomenon.
(Enter your favorite government
bashing indirect-cost line here.)
Not only that, but the article was
published in the New England
Journal of Medicine.

They did in vitro studies using
Coke and a saltwater control, and
discovered that in all cases, the
Coke had a dramatic effect on
sperm motility. They didn't say
anything about it actually killing
them, however. Maybe it just
caused them to stop, hold hands
(figuratively speaking) and start
singing "I'd Like to Teach the
World to Sing." I don't know.
As for variation between types
of Coke, Classic Coke was five
times as effective as New Coke
and Diet Coke was the most pow
erful of them all, completely oblit
erating everything it touched.
That kind of makes me wonder
what it's doing to my esophageal
lining, but I'll keep those musings
to myself.

The researchers decided it was
the pH of Coke that made it such
an effective spermicide, but since
the different kinds of Coke have
relatively the same pi I, that must
not be all there is to know.
My personal theory is that
Coke dissolves the flagella (tails)
of the sperm just like it dissolves
pennies, false teeth and, say, a
late-model Mustang, if you left it
immersed long enough. But 1
don't have a research grant, so
don't hold me to that.
The studies done so far have
been in the laboratory, where the
sperm are confined to a petri dish.
In real life, they'd be a lot harder
to catch.
So even though in some coun
tries Coke is allegedly used as a
type of contraception, I wouldn't
recommend it. At least not until
someone has done the same study
with Mountain Dew. (What was

their old advertising slogan? Do it
with Mountain Dew? That could
take on a whole new meaning . . .)
The potential for new inroads
into soft drink utility is immense,
nonetheless. Pretty soon someone
will discover that Coke fights
mold and mildew, serves as a rea
sonable alternative to tofu and
removes body hair faster and eas
ier than Nair — without that
abhorrent odor.
Coca-Cola will cease to be a
drink and will become a way of
life.
