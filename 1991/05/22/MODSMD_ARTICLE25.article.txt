# Want power? Trade-Up is for you
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Macintosh, unlike fine
wine, does not get better with
time. Such is the lesson of this
year's Microdisc Trade-Up pro
gram, which provides an oppor
tunity to exchange your old
computer — along with some
additional cash — for a brand
new Mac.
This is the second consecu
tive year the Bookstore is pro
viding this service and, while
the value of your used Mac is
not what it once was, the pro-
Tain still has "good deal" writ
ten on it.
Last time around, you could
have worked a better deal by
haggling with a dealer who spe
cializes in used Macs. Then, you
c.'ild have probably gotten $100
more than the Bookstore was
offering, taken the cash and
imply ordered a new machine.
No more, apparently. A sam
pling of some Bay Area dealers
suggests that the Microdisc
offers which are appreciably
lower than 1990 levels — are
comparable to the open market.
Sometimes you could get an
extra $25; often you could lose
Sr»() by going to an outside
agent.
Monetary detail aside, you
obviously need to decide
whether an upgrade is the right
. hiii: for you at all. As this space
has stated on countless occa
ions: If you're happy with the
way your Mac works now and
don't foresee changing the
things you do with it, don't
worry you can sit tight.
If, however, your computer is
creeping along when you want it
to be racing, you find your win
dows closing too slowly or you
-imply feel you've outgrown
your old friend, an upgrade can
be just the ticket.
Let's assume that if you've
made it this far, you're looking
for newness for the sake of new,
or for a more powerful Mac. In
all probability, you've got a Plus
or an SE, and you're thinking
that maybe a new LC or Ilsi
could fill your world with joy
and color.
1 lere's the skinny: The SE

with the old 800K drives is
worth $525, with the Super-
Drives it'll get you $665. Add
$95 to the value of either
machine if you have an Apple 20
megabyte drive; add $140 if
your Mac has a 40MB drive and
2MB of memory.
The LC goes for $1,517 and
the Ilsi for $2,446 in their base
configurations. Each requires
an external monitor, though,
which will add anywhere from
$189 to $629 to the cost.
Foremost among the benefits
of owning a new machine is that
you'll get a one-year warranty.
Should you hold onto your old
Mac and have it require service,
you could easily require a $200-
500 repair — almost as much as
the trade-in value of the
machine.
Aside from protection
against breakdown, your new
Mac will provide additional pro
cessing power and, therefore, it
will work faster. The LC and Ilsi
also support color without any
additional hardware.
The decision is naturally
going to require a cost-benefit
analysis to determine the value
of that $1,000-$2,000. Natural
ly, you could spend even more
money by jumping up and grab
bing a Ilci or Ilfx. If that's you,
there's a reasonable chance you
know what you're doing. A low
end upgrade, on the other hand,
is the kind of thing a lot of peo
ple should consider.
Advice is available from
Microdisc, Academic Informa
tion Resources, residence com
puter coordinators and the like.
Seek and ye shall find.
Final note: The original Mac
intosh 128K, which originally
cost $2,500-plus, gets a mere
$70 on trade-in. If you invested
in the original $999 upgrade to
make that Mac a 512 Kin 1985,
your $3,500 computer would
net you $95. Keep the machine
as a souvenir, it could be worth
something someday.

Oh where, oh where can I get
System 7.0? Oh where, oh
where is it free?
If you have a dozen 800K
disks — and at least half an

hour — stop by Microdisc and
start copying. Ask first, but ye
shall definitely receive. If you
want manuals, $84 will get you
those same disks plus Apple's
typically excellent documenta
tion.
Computer Corner requested
that we be allowed to hook up
our portable hard drive (it
doesn't even need a power
cable), to cut down the wait time
of copying all the goodies.
Microdisc management said no.
For that reason, System 7.0 is
not yet here, and I have few
observations about the actual
release version.
What I can tell you is that the
new system won't be shipping
with new Macs until sometime
this summer. If you buy a com
puter, you'll get System 6.0.8 —
6.0.7. with new LaserWriter
drives that coexist in a 7.0 world
— and a coupon for a free Sys
tem 7.0.
Part of the reason for that is
that some applications don't
work with the new software and
Apple doubtless fears a flood of
phone calls from novice users
asking why Freehand keeps
crashing. Apple's new support
hotline (7.0 buyers get to use it
free for 90 days) is already
swamped with calls from users
who have upgraded.
Users of Apple's 8*24 GC
graphics card and accelerator
should stay away from 7.0 for
now. Acceleration and 7.0 don't
work together and the fix isn't
due until fall. Same goes for
Appleshare 3.0. The current
fileserver software doesn't
work under 7.0 and the
replacement is behind sched
ule. System 7.0 machines can
access an old Appleshare serv
er running System 6.0.x with
out any trouble.
