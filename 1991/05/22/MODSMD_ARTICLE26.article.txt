ATHENS, Ga. — A fourth-con
secutive national men's tennis
title will not be brought home
from Athens this season, but
Stanford is still very much in the
running for an NCAA crown. Two
to be exact.
Individual action at the
national collegiate championships
gets underway this morning with
the first round of singles, and four
Cardinal competitors have a very
good chance of winning at least
one, if not both, of the season's
remaining tennis titles.
Junior Alex O'Brien and sopho
mores Jonathan Stark and Jared
Palmer each could take the singles
crown, and Stark and Palmer or
O'Brien and partner Jason Yee
could come up victors in the dou
bles competition.
Team action wound up yester
day with USC downing host Geor
gia 5-2 for its 12th national title,
but first since 1969.
O'Brien was rewarded for his
Pacific 10 Conference individual

title and solid season victories
with the No. 3 seed in the singles
event. The baselining slugger
wracked up a 15-7 dual meet
record - which included a 12-0
stretch at midseason - while play
ing at No. 1 for the Cardinal.
0.8. is also undefeated in
NCAA team play. He pulled off all
three of his matches at No. 1 sin
gles in Athens to extend his tour
nament streak to 11-0. While
O'Brien does not have an attack
ing serve-and-volley type game
thought necessary for success in
today's tennis world, he is one of
the most tenacious competitors
around, as evidenced by his vic
tory over Brian MacPhie of USC
in the semis Monday.
Down 2-6, 2-5, 0.8. pulled off
the Comeback of the Tournament,
pounding his way to a 2-6, 7-5, 6-4
win to keep the Cardinal's
chances alive.
Although seeded fifth, Stark is
considered a favorite to capture
the singles crown. After returning
from a year-long stress fracture,

Junior Alex O'Brien's brilliant season would be capped quite nicely by an NCAA singles championship. O'Brien, the reigning Pac-10 cham
pion, is seeded third in the tournament, which begins today.
Stark lost only once in dual match
play — recording a 12-1 record at
No. 2 and No. 3 singles — and
advanced to the finals of the Pac
-10 singles before going down to
O'Brien.
Even though Stark did not
really begin competing this year
until April, he has come on strong
during the past three weeks and is
considered to have regained last
season's level of his potent serve
and-volley game. Stark is also the
possessor of the top serve in colle
giate tennis.
"I consider Jon to be even bet
ter than he was a year ago [when
he was injured while ranked No.
I]. He has a more all-around
game," said Stanford coach Dick
Gould.
Palmer also accumulated
enough points during the regular
season to compete in the singles
event, although he is unseeded.
The aggressive, highly competi
tive player compiled a 16-6 record
while competing at No. 2 and 3
singles in his second year on the
Farm and ended the year ranked
38th according to the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate poll.
Stanford's offensive weapon
known as the Stark and Palmer
doubles team enters competition
— which kicks off tomorrow
morning — as the nation's top
seed. The dynamic duo accumu
lated a 6-3 dual-match record and
zinged their way to the Pacific
Coast Doubles and Pac-10 doubles
titles since Stark's return. They
also won the Volvo/Collegiate dou
bles title last fall.
The Cardinal tandem is seek
ing Stanford's first doubles title
since 1974, when current assis
tant coach John Whitlinger and
Jim Delaney used wooden rackets
to bring back the NCAA plaque.
Stark and Palmer got as far as the
semifinals last year.
"It's about time someone (from
Stanford] won!" chuckled
Whitlinger. "[Seriously] I would
be very pleased to have Jon and
Jared as the next national doubles
titlists from Stanford."

Stark and Palmer are
seeking to become
the first Stanford tan
dem to win the dou
bles title since 1974.

Although ranked seventh in
the Volvo postseason rankings,
O'Brien and Yee are not seeded in
the doubles competition. The
tenacious duo was undefeated in
dual-match play — going 12-0 at
No. 1 and No. 2 doubles — and
won the NorCal Intercollegiate
doubles title. The talented tandem
advanced to the quarterfinals of
last year's NCAA individual tour
nament.
O'Brien bounces into action in
the singles draw against Tony
Bujan of Texas Christian. The
junior Horned Frog competitor is
currently 20th in the Volvo rank
ings after compiling a 22-1 dual
match record. Stark faces off
against Mark Jeffrey of Missis
sippi State, a very talented Aus
trailian, and Palmer opens singles
competition against Duke's Jason
Rubell in the 64-player field.
With their top seeding, Stark
and Palmer will face unhearalded
Kirk Haygarth and Mitch
Michulka of Texas tomorrow.
O'Brien and Yee open action
against Rubell and Geoff Grant,
winners of last fall's Southern
Collegiate Championships.
In the singles competition,
other seeded players include (1)
Conny of Miami, (2) A 1
Parker of Georgia, (4) USC fresh
man MacPhie, (6) David DiLucia
of Notre Dame, (7) Cal's Bent
Pedersen and (8) Bvron Black of
USC.
Following Stark and Palmer in
the doubles seeding are Cal's Ped
ersen and Matt Lucena, Black and
MacPhie and Tim Jessup and
Brice Karsh of Tennessee. DiLu
cia and Chuck Coleman of Notre
Dame, Ellis Ferreira and Rick
Witsken of Alabama, Brian
Gyetko and Dave Lomicky of Ari
zona State and Kentucky's lan
Skidmore and John Yancey are
seeded alphabetically in the fifth
to eighth group.
