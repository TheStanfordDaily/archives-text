ATHENS, Ga. — A fourth-con
secutive national men's tennis
title will not be brought home
from Athens this season, but
Stanford is still very much in the
running for an NCAA crown. Two
to be exact.
Individual action at the
national collegiate championships
gets underway this morning with
the first round of singles, and four
Cardinal competitors have a very
good chance of winning at least
one, if not both, of the season's
remaining tennis titles.
Junior Alex O'Brien and sopho
mores Jonathan Stark and Jared
Palmer each could take the singles
crown, and Stark and Palmer or
O'Brien and partner Jason Yee
could come up victors in the dou
bles competition.
Team action wound up yester
day with USC downing host Geor
gia 5-2 for its 12th national title,
but first since 1969.
O'Brien was rewarded for his
Pacific 10 Conference individual

title and solid season victories
with the No. 3 seed in the singles
event. The baselining slugger
wracked up a 15-7 dual meet
record - which included a 12-0
stretch at midseason - while play
ing at No. 1 for the Cardinal.
0.8. is also undefeated in
NCAA team play. He pulled off all
three of his matches at No. 1 sin
gles in Athens to extend his tour
nament streak to 11-0. While
O'Brien does not have an attack
ing serve-and-volley type game
thought necessary for success in
today's tennis world, he is one of
the most tenacious competitors
around, as evidenced by his vic
tory over Brian MacPhie of USC
in the semis Monday.
Down 2-6, 2-5, 0.8. pulled off
the Comeback of the Tournament,
pounding his way to a 2-6, 7-5, 6-4
win to keep the Cardinal's
chances alive.
Although seeded fifth, Stark is
considered a favorite to capture
the singles crown. After returning
from a year-long stress fracture,

Junior Alex O'Brien's brilliant season would be capped quite nicely by an NCAA singles championship. O'Brien, the reigning Pac-10 cham
pion, is seeded third in the tournament, which begins today.
