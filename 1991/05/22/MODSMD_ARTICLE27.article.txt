# Paying college athletes â€” now is the time
## 
### 
It's time to admit it. It may have taken me
nearly four years of college, but I've finally
come to terms with a notion that has
haunted me the whole time. The fact is, there
is something very wrong with college sports.
Of course, the papers are full of this news.
But you don't need to be a journalist to see the
evidence. It is all around you at Stanford and
other big-time sports schools across the coun
try.
Basically, the problem is this: College sports
have gotten way too big for their britches, and
the resulting damage is spilling out in the
forms of greed, drugs, violence and shameless
abandonment of the true nature of collegiate
athletics.
Or, to be more succinct: Many sports, pri
marily football and basketball, have come to be
essentially a minor league system for the pros.
The other day, you no doubt read about
Cardinal basketball center Adam Keefe's deci
sion not to turn professional. Keefe is coming
back for his senior year instead; the entire
campus, including myself, is ecstatic.
But let's examine the situation and why it
even exists. Keefe is not graduating early, so
why would he leave? The answer is, of course,
that school is not the issue here. The issue, to

be blunt, is one million dollars.
That is how much it is estimated Keefe
could receive as a first-round pick in next
month's NBA draft. That is probably a little
less than how much fellow underclassmen
Kenny Anderson and Billy Owens will be sign
ing for after they are drafted next month.
Anderson is a sophomore, Owens a junior.
But to cut the diatribe before it really gets
going, let's talk turkey. I can complain all I
want about it, and college sports are still going
to continue to sign large TV contracts. They're
going to keep paying recruits. Underclassmen
are going to continue entering the draft
What is needed, then, is a salary system
for college athletes. It's an unholy
thought, I know, but then who is any
position to talk about standards? Not you sea
son ticket holders who support the system.
Think about it, though. On one side, Adam
Keefe has one million in U.S. dollars being
waved under his nose by multimillionaire NBA
owners. On the other, he has Mike Mont
gomery with a whistle in one hand, a textbook
in the other.
Millions versus an education. You decide,
kid.

Keefe chose the education, but he also chose
to take out an insurance policy on his body for
some similarly huge amount of money He's no
sentimentalist when it comes to a business
men's game.
It's time to pay the players because they
have few other options if they wish to make it
to the pros (the exception being baseball), and
the colleges are making lots of money off of
their efforts.
Sure, these athletes are getting full scholar
ships, but that's just not enough. If you dis
agree, then tell me why so many schools are
being punished for paying recruits and ath
letes?
