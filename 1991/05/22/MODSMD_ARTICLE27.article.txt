# Paying college athletes — now is the time
## 
### 
It's time to admit it. It may have taken me
nearly four years of college, but I've finally
come to terms with a notion that has
haunted me the whole time. The fact is, there
is something very wrong with college sports.
Of course, the papers are full of this news.
But you don't need to be a journalist to see the
evidence. It is all around you at Stanford and
other big-time sports schools across the coun
try.
Basically, the problem is this: College sports
have gotten way too big for their britches, and
the resulting damage is spilling out in the
forms of greed, drugs, violence and shameless
abandonment of the true nature of collegiate
athletics.
Or, to be more succinct: Many sports, pri
marily football and basketball, have come to be
essentially a minor league system for the pros.
The other day, you no doubt read about
Cardinal basketball center Adam Keefe's deci
sion not to turn professional. Keefe is coming
back for his senior year instead; the entire
campus, including myself, is ecstatic.
But let's examine the situation and why it
even exists. Keefe is not graduating early, so
why would he leave? The answer is, of course,
that school is not the issue here. The issue, to

be blunt, is one million dollars.
That is how much it is estimated Keefe
could receive as a first-round pick in next
month's NBA draft. That is probably a little
less than how much fellow underclassmen
Kenny Anderson and Billy Owens will be sign
ing for after they are drafted next month.
Anderson is a sophomore, Owens a junior.
But to cut the diatribe before it really gets
going, let's talk turkey. I can complain all I
want about it, and college sports are still going
to continue to sign large TV contracts. They're
going to keep paying recruits. Underclassmen
are going to continue entering the draft
What is needed, then, is a salary system
for college athletes. It's an unholy
thought, I know, but then who is any
position to talk about standards? Not you sea
son ticket holders who support the system.
Think about it, though. On one side, Adam
Keefe has one million in U.S. dollars being
waved under his nose by multimillionaire NBA
owners. On the other, he has Mike Mont
gomery with a whistle in one hand, a textbook
in the other.
Millions versus an education. You decide,
kid.

Keefe chose the education, but he also chose
to take out an insurance policy on his body for
some similarly huge amount of money He's no
sentimentalist when it comes to a business
men's game.
It's time to pay the players because they
have few other options if they wish to make it
to the pros (the exception being baseball), and
the colleges are making lots of money off of
their efforts.
Sure, these athletes are getting full scholar
ships, but that's just not enough. If you dis
agree, then tell me why so many schools are
being punished for paying recruits and ath
letes?

The athletes aren't allowed to
work during the school year, and
oftentimes don't have much
money to buy things that they
need or would like to have. Some
don't even have enough money to
fly home for vacations.
Other athletes have enough
money (usually from their par
ents), but put in long weeks prac
ticing and playing for a scholar
ship that amounts to a few thou
sand dollars or less at most state
schools. It's more at Stanford, but
financial aid often knocks down
the price here, too.
Here's the way to solve the
endless NCAA violations that are
revealed (and the thousands of
others that aren't) each year.
First, require the professional
sports to start supporting these
glorified training grounds with
dollars. No more free rides for big
business sports.
Use the money first of all to
support and further develop the
junior college sports programs in

the country. At these schools, ath
letes who aren't up to university
academic standards can take
remedial classes while honing
their athletic skills.
Then, adopt and enforce
stricter standards for admission
at all schools with Division I foot
ball and basketball programs. No
more "Recruit them, then have
'em fill out the application after
they've decided." This is a deci
sion for admissions deans, not
athletic coaches.
Repeal the Proposition 48 reg
ulations that let subpar athlete
students in and then make them
wait a year. In reality, these ath
letes don't belong at a four-year
school. The current system places
an unhealthy emphasis on stan
dardized tests, anyway.
Then, give each school a fair
salary cap for their revenue-pro
ducing sports. The coaches and
athletic department would then
decide on salaries for the players,
based on what they perceive as
each athlete's value to the pro
gram.
Out of their salary, a player
would have to pay his tuition,
books, room and board — just like

a regular student. Because of this,
salaries at private schools would
be proportionally higher.
This would not be a profes
sional league with astronomical
salaries. There would be a set
limit. At Stanford, a reasonable
maximum annual amount might
be $40-50 thousand.
That's a good chunk of money,
even after tuition, for an 18-year
old kid. But it would teach respon
sibility and maturity and also pre
pare those who do make the pros
to handle the big money later.
Recruiting would be similar. A
coach would decide how much he
needs a particular athlete. He can
lavish as many cash gifts as he
wants on a prized recruit, but
these will come out of a budget.
Some programs may have a few
highly talented athletes. Others
may spend their money with an
aim towards more quality depth.
Finally, any player who
becomes ineligible for academic
failings would lose a portion of his
salary. If adequate progress
towards graduation is not being
made, then more money could be
taken away. Repeated drug viola
tions or sexual offenses: contract

termination and expulsion. These
would be decisions made by aca
demic personnel, not coaches.
Similarly, bonuses for out
standing grades and graduation
would be offered.
A drastic measure, you say.
Well, let the punishment fit the
crimes of abuse that have been
committed in college sports in the
name of the profit margin. The
current penalties the NCAA is
handing down simply don't have
much effect. To reform the sys
tem, you have to speak its lan
guage first. And the exploitation
of athletes would be terminated.
There could be one interesting
side effect. By abandoning the
scholarship policy, there could be
a rash of spending on the best
players, leaving many others
without offers. The result would
be teams of walk-ons who are
there simply for the love of the
sport and nothing else.
Now that would be a change,
wouldn't it?
