# Rumors abound as AD search nears end
## 
### 
Forget the plans to find a
CEO type to fill the athletic
director post. Forget the
rumors that a Stanford man,
like former football coach John
Ralston, was likely to land the
job. And most of all, forget the
list of finalists everyone has
bandied about over the past
several weeks.
According to a report in yes
terday's Peninsula Times Tri
bune, there are indeed four
finalists being considered by
the athletic director search
committee: Ted Leland, ath
letic director at the University
of the Pacific; Donna Lopiano,
women's athletic director at
Texas; Ken Walker, athletic
director at Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo; and McKinley Boston,
athletic director at Rhode
Island.

Leland is the only candidate
with anything resembling
Stanford ties. He served as an
assistant under then-football
coach Bill Walsh in 1978. He
received a doctorate in sports
psychology from Stanford in
1982. Leland is in his second
year at Pacific.
"Being named director of
athletics at Stanford Univer
sity would be a very positive
move in my professional career
and is an opportunity which,
obviously, warrants looking
into," Leland said in a state
ment released Monday.
"I am very fond of my posi
tion at UOP," he added. "I
played football here and
coached here, and my feelings
run deep for Pacific and its ath
letic community.
"I also have fond memories as
a coach and student at Stanford,
and it is with mixed feelings that I
ponder the possibility of moving
my family."
Lopiano is the best known
administrator of Division I
women's athletics in the nation.
She was the subject of an
extended profile in Sports Illus
trated some months ago.
Two of the rumored candi
dates: Minnesota athletic director
Rick Bay and Stanford associate
athletic director Tom Beckett are
apparently no longer in the pic
ture. Bay withdrew from the pro
cess, and Beckett believes the
search committee has decided not
to include him among the final
ists.
