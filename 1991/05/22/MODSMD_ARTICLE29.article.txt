# Now Moore than ever
## Women's golf's star leads Stanford into the national championships 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Today is tee time for the Cardi
nal women's golf team as it makes
a bid to dethrone the powerhouses
of the sport on the first of four
days at the 72-hole NCAA Cham
pionships at Ohio State.
"This is the strongest five
player team I've ever had," said
Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin of
his sixth-seeded team. "Some
years we've had two, three or four
good players, but never anything
like this. We can challenge for the
title provided that all of our five
players play up to their poten
tials."
At the helm for the Cardinal,
junior Adele Moore is attempting
to solidify herself in the top ranks
of collegiate golf. In doing so, she
hopes to lead Stanford in its
attempt to overcome nemeses,
top-ranked San Jose State, sec
ond-ranked Arizona and No. 3
UCLA.
Last season, Moore came off
what she called a "mediocre year"
to be a pleasant surprise in the
NCAA tourney for the Cardinal
when she led the field after two
rounds by shooting a 70 and a 75.
"It was really exciting because
I wasn't in the running for any
thing when we entered the tour
nament," Moore said.
However, she could not main

tain the outrageous pace she had
set in the opening two days as she
shot a 79 to fall to fifth and then
an 82 in final 18 holes to finish
22nd overall.
"It was disappointing to finish
the way I did," she said. "I would
rather have finished strong, but
then again I would not have ever
led."
Nonetheless, she made a state
ment with her two-day lead. "She
showed everybody that she has
the ability to win a tournament of
that magnitude," Baldwin said.
Recruited as the top junior
prospect in the country three
years ago, Moore dominated vir
tually every major junior event. In
1986, her junior year at the Hock
ady School in Dallas, Texas, she
was named the Junior Player of
the Year after winning the PGA
Junior, the Western Junior and
the Tournament of Champions.
In her senior year, she won the
Western Junior for the third time
while being the national junior
runner-up.
"As a junior player, she won
every tournament of importance
except for the USGA, which she
was the runner-up in," Baldwin
said.
However, Moore confronted a
series of frustrations in her tran
sition from junior golf to the colle
giate level. First of all, she
severely injured her ankle playing

basketball during her senior year
of high school.
"I crushed my ankle six days
after verbally committing to Stan
ford, and I refrained from calling
Tim [Baldwinl for two weeks not
knowing if my scholarship would
be in jeopardy. But he told me that
he'd take me in a wheelchair if he
had to," Moore recalled.
For six months thereafter, she
tried competing with a plate and
pins securing the bone, but she
said she "didn't play well and was
in pain." Despite losing a lot of
muscle, Moore overcame pain
during the fall of her freshman
year and churned out a 77.6 scor
ing average en route to being
named an honorable mention All-
American.
During her sophomore cam
paign, back ailments, among
other things, began to take their
toll on her. Not used to subpar
performances after her stellar
junior career, Moore became frus
trated.
"I expected to continue doing
as well in college as I had in high
school," she said.
"The jump from junior to col
lege golf is a good-sized jump,"
Baldwin said. "All of the top
juniors in the world from the ages
of 18 to 22 play in college. And the
courses are a good 1,000 yards
longer."
So she was going up against

stiffer competition than she had
ever encountered before in high
school, and the courses were dif
ferent. However, that was not the
entire story.
"I realized that college life is
more than just my sport and aca
demics," Moore said. "I'm happy
that I broadened myself because I
learned a lot about what others
believe and think. I appreciate
learning about them because 1
came from a sheltered back
ground."
Looking at her junior rankings
in comparison to her collegiate
standings, one could come to the
statistical conclusion that her
game has fallen off in the past few
years. But she won't hear any
thing of it.
"There's more to my life than
just golf and school, but 1 don't
think that anything has suffered
in the process," Moore said. "I
sometimes get frustrated when
other teams are not studying and
others are taking tests for them,
but then I realize that we're really
developing ourselves."
Moore's sizzling performance
in last year's NCAAs lit a spark in
her that has spurred on her top
season yet on The Farm. She fin
ished among the top five in six of
10 tournaments this year, includ
ing fourth in the Pacific 10 Con

ference Championships and fifth
in the California Invitational a
week ago.
"It's remarkable what she's
done this year," Baldwin said.
If Moore is to take last year's
performance two rounds further,
she thinks that the key is her
mental toughness.
"Winning depends on one's
own inner confidence in yourself,"
Moore said. "Before last year's
NCAAs it had been a good three
years before I had felt like I had as
a junior.
"I've been working on my
swing recently. It feels better than
it did last year. Putting is the
thing that has been my downfall."
"Adele can do it," Baldwin said.
"With two practice rounds, she'll
have six days to stay rested and
mentally focused."

top-ranked San Jose State, sec
ond-ranked Arizona and No. 3
UCLA.
Last season, Moore came off
what she called a "mediocre year"
to be a pleasant surprise in the
NCAA tourney for the Cardinal
when she led the field after two
rounds by shooting a 70 and a 75.
"It was really exciting because
I wasn't in the running for any
thing when we entered the tour
nament," Moore said.
However, she could not main

tain the outrageous pace she had
set in the opening two days as she
shot a 79 to fall to fifth and then
an 82 in final 18 holes to finish
22nd overall.
"It was disappointing to finish
the way I did," she said. "I would
rather have finished strong, but
then again I would not have ever
led."
Nonetheless, she made a state
ment with her two-day lead. "She
showed everybody that she has
the ability to win a tournament of
that magnitude," Baldwin said.
Recruited as the top junior
prospect in the country three
years ago, Moore dominated vir
tually every major junior event. In
1986, her junior year at the Hock
ady School in Dallas, Texas, she
was named the Junior Player of
the Year after winning the PGA
Junior, the Western Junior and
the Tournament of Champions.
In her senior year, she won the
Western Junior for the third time
while being the national junior
runner-up.
"As a junior player, she won
every tournament of importance
except for the USGA, which she
was the runner-up in," Baldwin
said.
However, Moore confronted a
series of frustrations in her tran
sition from junior golf to the colle
giate level. First of all, she
severely injured her ankle playing

basketball during her senior year
of high school.
"I crushed my ankle six days
after verbally committing to Stan
ford, and I refrained from calling
Tim [Baldwinl for two weeks not
knowing if my scholarship would
be in jeopardy. But he told me that
he'd take me in a wheelchair if he
had to," Moore recalled.
For six months thereafter, she
tried competing with a plate and
pins securing the bone, but she
said she "didn't play well and was
in pain." Despite losing a lot of
muscle, Moore overcame pain
during the fall of her freshman
year and churned out a 77.6 scor
ing average en route to being
named an honorable mention All-
American.
During her sophomore cam
paign, back ailments, among
other things, began to take their
toll on her. Not used to subpar
performances after her stellar
junior career, Moore became frus
trated.
"I expected to continue doing
as well in college as I had in high
school," she said.
"The jump from junior to col
lege golf is a good-sized jump,"
Baldwin said. "All of the top
juniors in the world from the ages
of 18 to 22 play in college. And the
courses are a good 1,000 yards
longer."
So she was going up against

stiffer competition than she had
ever encountered before in high
school, and the courses were dif
ferent. However, that was not the
entire story.
"I realized that college life is
more than just my sport and aca
demics," Moore said. "I'm happy
that I broadened myself because I
learned a lot about what others
believe and think. I appreciate
learning about them because 1
came from a sheltered back
ground."
Looking at her junior rankings
in comparison to her collegiate
standings, one could come to the
statistical conclusion that her
game has fallen off in the past few
years. But she won't hear any
thing of it.
"There's more to my life than
just golf and school, but 1 don't
think that anything has suffered
in the process," Moore said. "I
sometimes get frustrated when
other teams are not studying and
others are taking tests for them,
but then I realize that we're really
developing ourselves."
Moore's sizzling performance
in last year's NCAAs lit a spark in
her that has spurred on her top
season yet on The Farm. She fin
ished among the top five in six of
10 tournaments this year, includ
ing fourth in the Pacific 10 Con

ference Championships and fifth
in the California Invitational a
week ago.
"It's remarkable what she's
done this year," Baldwin said.
If Moore is to take last year's
performance two rounds further,
she thinks that the key is her
mental toughness.
"Winning depends on one's
own inner confidence in yourself,"
Moore said. "Before last year's
NCAAs it had been a good three
years before I had felt like I had as
a junior.
"I've been working on my
swing recently. It feels better than
it did last year. Putting is the
thing that has been my downfall."
"Adele can do it," Baldwin said.
"With two practice rounds, she'll
have six days to stay rested and
mentally focused."
Today is tee time for the Cardi
nal women's golf team as it makes
a bid to dethrone the powerhouses
of the sport on the first of four
days at the 72-hole NCAA Cham
pionships at Ohio State.
"This is the strongest five
player team I've ever had," said
Cardinal coach Tim Baldwin of
his sixth-seeded team. "Some
years we've had two, three or four
good players, but never anything
like this. We can challenge for the
title provided that all of our five
players play up to their poten
tials."
At the helm for the Cardinal,
junior Adele Moore is attempting
to solidify herself in the top ranks
of collegiate golf. In doing so, she
hopes to lead Stanford in its
attempt to overcome nemeses,
top-ranked San Jose State, sec
ond-ranked Arizona and No. 3
UCLA.
