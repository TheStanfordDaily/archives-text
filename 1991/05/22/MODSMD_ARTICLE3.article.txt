## Spiritual leader tells blacks to harness unconscious mind, like in past societies 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld Staff writer 
Black people can reproduce the
greatness of their past civiliza
tions in Africa and Asia by releas
ing the potential of their minds,
an African spiritual leader told a
crowd of 50 in Ujamaa lounge last
night.
King Shekhem Ur Shekhem Ra
Un Nefer Amen I, leader of the
spiritual Ausar Auset society,
described how the black civiliza
tions that emerged 10,000 years
ago developed complex mathemat
ical and geometrical systems, agri
culture, medicine, libraries, engi
neering and architecture, while
"Europeans were still following
sheep."
He explained his original
"hunch that the spirituality of
Egypt had a lot to do with it,"
because religion permeated every
area of Egyptian society.
The next step in Amen's theory
was the discovery that "the
ancients learned how to get access
to the unconscious mind."
"Most of your behavior is con
trolled by the part of the mind
that operates below the sphere of
consciousness," he said. "The con
scious mind is only a small part of

what you do."
He said subjects placed in mild
states of trance are able to learn
100 times more than the average
student.
He then claimed that the differ
ent uses of the brain's two hemi
spheres partially account for dif
ferences between Western and
African culture.
"The left side," Amen said,
"separates the world into com
partments. The right side brings
everything together in one
moment. It thinks pictorially."
Amen explained how Western
culture fails to understand the
human spirit because it cannot
analyze it. African culture, on the
other hand, has the tools required
to understand the spirit's various
components.
He proceeded to describe in
some detail the symbolic Tree of
Life, the cabalistic organization of
the spirit into 11 spheres.
In his view, Western culture is
limited to the four lowest spheres,
dealing with physical matter, the
animal spirit, imitation and cate
gorizations.
Upon completing the first rite
of passage the initiate can reach
the next three spheres — circum
spection and will, analysis and
synthesis (the use of symbols in
an abstract way).
The second rite of passage
opens the third, second and first
spheres, which enable a person to
affect the functions of the body
and nature itself, use the power of
intuition to learn anything and
feel everything as if it were a part
of the body.
The zero sphere, accessed by a
third rite of passage, is where the
mind can override pain, fear and
illness.

Amen said he believed the
Western educational system needs
to be reshaped to become more
"Afrocentric" and integrate these
concepts.
"The present system doesn't
speak to the fullness of man's
capabilities," he said. "It neglects
to develop a major part of the
human potential."
Amen also said most of the
knowledge and improvements in
Western society were mostly due
to blacks, and he criticized how
"the (Western) man makes sure
you don't get enough money" and
will never share power.
"The knowledge to use the
mind has been methodically hid
den from you," he told the pre
dominantly black crowd.
