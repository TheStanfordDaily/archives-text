ATHENS, Ga. (AP) - Top
seeded Southern California broke
the Athens jinx and ended 15
years of frustration by winning
the NCAA men's tennis champi
onship with a 5-2 victory over
Georgia yesterday.
USC won the title in the first
doubles match when Byron Black
and Brian MacPhie defeated A 1
Parker and Patricio Arnold 6-2, 6-
4.
Georgia has played host to the
NCAA event 14 of the last 15
years — beating USC five times in
Athens — including the 1987
semifinals, when the Trojans were
32-0 and favored to win.
The Trojans had not won the
NCAA title since the dual-match
format was instituted in 1977.
USC had 12 titles from 1946 to
1976 when an open draw tourna
ment with points for each victory
was used to determine the cham

pion.
Since 1977, Southern Cal had
made the semifinals eight times,
but only this year did the Trojans
manage to make it to the finals.
USC took the first two singles
matches, gaining victories from
Black and Donny Isaak. Black
defeated Arnold 6-4, 6-0, and
Isaak downed Ivan Baron 6-2, 6-2.
Georgia's No. 1 player, Parker,
ranked second in the nation, got
the Bulldogs' first victory with a
7-5, 7-5 triumph over MacPhie.
But the Trojans went up 4-1
when David Ekerot defeated Wade
McGuire 6-3, 7-5 and Andres Lanyi
took Hector Nevares 7-5, 6-4.
Georgia freshman Bobby Mari
encheck gave the Bulldogs, and a
sellout crowd of 5,138 at Henry
Feild Stadium, a glimmer of hope
by outlasting Jon Leach 1-6, 7-6,
6-4 and putting it into the hands
of the doubles teams.
