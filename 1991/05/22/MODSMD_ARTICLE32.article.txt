The Students for East European
Democracy program has only existed for
a year, but it already has received
national recognition from the Saturn
Corp. for its contributions to the Stan
ford and international communities.
The group was selected Friday as the
Stanford recipient of the newly created
Saturn Award. The award, which
includes a $1,000 prize, is intended to
honor student groups that illustrate the
qualities embodied in Saturn's nontra
ditional cooperative management phi
losophy.
During its first year, Students for
East European Democracy has sent 300
textbooks to the Prague School of Eco
nomics, brought Romanian student
leader Marian Munteanu to speak at
Stanford and hosted 10 Yugoslavian
university students for two weeks. This
summer, the group will send 30 Stan
ford students to Czechoslovakia to teach
English.
"We were very impressed by the level
of competition for the award," said
senior Matt Eldridge, director of the
group. "We were amazed we won. We
have been a relatively low-key organiza
tion this last year, and it is great to see

that someone has noticed our work."
Students for East European Democ
racy will now compete with organiza
tions from 12 other schools for the
national Saturn Award and $5,000 in
prize money. Seven student organiza
tions were considered for the Stanford
award.
Office of Student Activities assistant
Allison Sandy, a member of the Stanford
award's selection committee, explained
the decision to recognize Students for
East European Democracy. "Their
application and the work they have done
fit Saturn's criteria very well. Other
groups met some of the criteria but not
necessarily all of them," Sandy said.
The award's criteria consist of team
initiative and enterprise, enhancement
of the campus community, achievement
of goals through cooperative effort and
recognition of individual contribution to
the group. "Saturn Corp. is dedication
to the importance of teamwork,"
explained award program coordinator
Cindy Dainsberg.

The award will help the group to con
tinue and expand its activities. "The
award lets people know about our
group, it helps our group's longevity,
and the award money is a lifesaver for
us," Eldridge said.
The group plans to use the money to
buy a fax machine, which will allow
cheaper communication with student
organizations in Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia at more convenient times
than before.
"There are fax machines available on
campus, but they are not available at
hours that we can afford to use them,"
Eldridge said. "Calling East Europe
during business hours is really expen
sive."
The six other groups considered for
the award were the You Can Make a Dif
ference Conference, the Rape Education
Project, the Stanford Project on Nutri
tion, the Stanford Solar Car Project,
Branner Presents and the group respon
sible for computerizing the ASSU elec
tions.
