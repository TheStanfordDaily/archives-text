# Computerized access to student records delayed

Dreams of a world where Stanford stu
dents can access registration records in the
privacy of their rooms without waiting in
snake-like lines will remain unfulfilled for
two more quarters.
The computerized "student access sys
tem" that was scheduled to debut fall quar
ter will not be unveiled until spring quarter,
said acting Registrar Jack Farrell.
The Network for Student Information
and the Stanford Data Center are currently
working on the electronic data system,
which will allow users to perform by com
puter many actions that now must be done
at the Registrar's Office, such as filling out
study lists, declaring majors and filing for
pass/no credit status.
The long-awaited system slipped six
months behind schedule when the pro
grammers realized the complexity of their
task, Farrell said.
A pilot version for about 500 students
will be implemented next winter. By spring
quarter, the system will be ready to service
the entire student body, Farrell said.
Since the Registrar's Office's "reposi

tioning" plan to lay off workers in the fall
hinged on the implementation of the sys
tem, the office is now "faced with a situa
tion of no system and no money to continue
staffing," Farrell said.
Fortunately, attrition has taken care of
most of the layoffs. Only one worker who
will be displaced is still employed, and she is
currently making plans to relocate, he
added.
Farrell insisted that students will not be
inconvenienced next fall by the short
staffed office and the lack of the computer
ized system. "It may make it more difficult
on the remaining staff, but students
shouldn't notice. Our staff has done a super
job, and we have had few complaints."
Other tasks that students will be able to
perform on the network include:
• Updating mailing addresses or health
insurance records,
• Requesting privacy of information,
• Dropping or adding classes,
• Clearing up holds on transcripts or
diplomas,
• Ordering official transcripts, and
