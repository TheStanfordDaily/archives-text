# Computerized access to student records delayed
## 
### Jen Jauquet 
Dreams of a world where Stanford stu
dents can access registration records in the
privacy of their rooms without waiting in
snake-like lines will remain unfulfilled for
two more quarters.
The computerized "student access sys
tem" that was scheduled to debut fall quar
ter will not be unveiled until spring quarter,
said acting Registrar Jack Farrell.
The Network for Student Information
and the Stanford Data Center are currently
working on the electronic data system,
which will allow users to perform by com
puter many actions that now must be done
at the Registrar's Office, such as filling out
study lists, declaring majors and filing for
pass/no credit status.
The long-awaited system slipped six
months behind schedule when the pro
grammers realized the complexity of their
task, Farrell said.
A pilot version for about 500 students
will be implemented next winter. By spring
quarter, the system will be ready to service
the entire student body, Farrell said.
Since the Registrar's Office's "reposi

tioning" plan to lay off workers in the fall
hinged on the implementation of the sys
tem, the office is now "faced with a situa
tion of no system and no money to continue
staffing," Farrell said.
Fortunately, attrition has taken care of
most of the layoffs. Only one worker who
will be displaced is still employed, and she is
currently making plans to relocate, he
added.
Farrell insisted that students will not be
inconvenienced next fall by the short
staffed office and the lack of the computer
ized system. "It may make it more difficult
on the remaining staff, but students
shouldn't notice. Our staff has done a super
job, and we have had few complaints."
Other tasks that students will be able to
perform on the network include:
• Updating mailing addresses or health
insurance records,
• Requesting privacy of information,
• Dropping or adding classes,
• Clearing up holds on transcripts or
diplomas,
• Ordering official transcripts, and
• Printing unofficial lists of
previous courses and grades.
"All of the stuff we now do on
paper will be done electronically,"
Farrell explained. "It's just that
instead of standing in a long line,
you can sit down, log on and get
what you're looking for."
The system will be readily
accessible to students through all
dormitory computer clusters,
Tresidder AlRport, library termi
nals and any computer hooked up
to SUNet or a modem phone line.
Farrell said he did not believe
students would be put off by the
more impersonal registration pro
cess. "How personal is filling out
a commitment form? Registration
has never been a very personal
process. It's been mass hysteria
and standing in lines."
The system will use two
approaches to interact with stu
dents. The first will work through
a list of questions posed to the
user. The second system, whose
complex programming details
have been a partial cause of the
delay, will be a graphic interface
that takes advantage of Macin
tosh menus and options.
Although the system will not
be available 24 hours a day, its
hours will be longer than those of

the current Old Union office. The
system may shut down at mid
night, but there will be access
hours on weekends and as long as
possible during the day.
As a safety precaution, users
will have to enter a personal iden
tification number in addition to
their student ID number before
examining private information.
This five- to eight-digit number
can be changed by the student at
any time to prevent privacy viola
tions.
The system will also prevent
abuse of the drop/add date by dis
allowing the option after the
deadline and blinking nastily at
would-be offenders.
Current Old Union office
workers say they do not feel
threatened by the computer sys
tem and welcome its arrival.
David Arocha, an information
assistant, said he thinks the sys
tem will "mean less of a workload
for us and a lot less stress for stu
dents."
Co-worker Suzanne Gruber
agreed. "I think it will be fabu
lous. When students haven't
accessed study lists properly, it
will tell them right away. Instant
feedback means no surprises later
in the quarter."
Arocha added, "In fact, I think
students like dealing with a com
puter better than a person. They
can just log on, and they don't
need to talk to us."
