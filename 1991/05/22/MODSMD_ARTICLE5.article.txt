# New senate's first meeting full of bickering over rules
## Concerns raised about senate chair Warsh 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The election of a new deputy senate
chair was one of the few decisions that
came out of last night's ASSU senate meet
ing, which was otherwise mostly dominated
by bickering over rules.
In the first real meeting of next year's
senate, graduate senator Neil Crellin, a doc
toral candidate in statistics, was elected the
deputy senate chair for next year by a 13-3
vote. The senate then unanimously voted to
approve his selection.
Crellin was opposed by undergraduate
senator Travis Katz, a freshman, who ran
as a write-in candidate because he failed to
submit an application to senate chair Kevin
Warsh 48 hours before the meeting.
Crellin said he was excited about the pos
sibility of serving as deputy senate chair. He
called the post "mostly an administrative
job to ensure that the senate runs
smoothly."
The deputy senate chair's major respon
sibilities include preparing the agenda
packets for each meeting and serving as
senate chair if Warsh is not at a meeting.
Although questions of partisanship were
generally not raised during the debate over
deputy senate chair, several concerns were
voiced about senate chair Warsh.
Undergraduate senator Jason Snyder,

who is not affiliated with
either party, accused
Warsh, a junior, of being
partisan and expressing
support for Crellin.
Crellin is a Students
First senator, and Warsh
was widely considered the
Students First senate chair
candidate against Solina
Kwan, the candidate gen-

erally supported by People's Platform sena
tors.
"It is out of line for the senate chair to
take a position on the deputy senate chair,"
said Snyder, a freshman. "I now see a big
partisan position in this debate . . . and it
appears that the deputy senate chair will be
a position aligned with one party or the
other."
Warsh did not respond to the accusation
during the meeting, but junior Raphe Beck,
a Hammer and Coffin senator, said he "did
not see much partisan debate" and "would
hate to start that type of thing now."
In other senate action, junior Jason
Moore was confirmed as hearings officer for
next year's election. Moore, who served in
the position this year, was approved unani
mously.
"Based on my work in the last election, I


Crellin
feel I can provide continuity and
experience to the position,"
Moore said. "I plan to help
explore possible campaign
reforms for next year."
The only serious objection to
Moore came from former senator
senior Naomi Onaga, who ques
tioned Moore's "capacity to be
fair as hearings officer."
Moore would only respond
afterward by saying that "a
majority of the senate disagreed
with Naomi Onaga's blatantly
partisan sentiments."

As the meeting ended, several
senators criticized Warsh's selec
tion of committee members
because he did not put a student
of color on the appropriations
committee and because the com
mittee will be heavily dominated
by Students First senators.
Onaga said she questioned the
senate chair's agenda because the
appropriations committee has no
students of color. "There is no
diversity in the control of fund
ing. ... I imagine that the com
munities of color are going to be
very upset by this."
But Warsh defended his com
mittee assignments, saying all
senators received their first or

second choice of committee and
he did not distinguish senators by
their race.
The senate also discussed mak
ing new rules for future debate
based on Robert's Rules of Order.
Senators spent almost 90 minutes
before on the issue passing many
of the new rules and sending
other parts to committee.
Questions about the ASSU
Bylaws and constitution delayed
senate action on funding for char
ity events of the Delta Gamma
and Kappa Alpha Theta sorori
ties.
This year's senate refused to
allocate any money from the Pro
gram Board to fund the expenses

for these events, and several sen
ators are attempting to secure
that funding through senate dis
cretionary funds.
At the end of the meeting,
Council of Presidents member
and former deputy senate chair
Beth Morgan had mixed reactions
about the new senate.
"They had a greater focus on
the rules and procedures, and
that is a step for the better," said
Morgan, a sophomore. "For
tonight it may have seemed that
they got bogged down on rules
because they are not used to rules
in general. . . . But it looks like
that will be able to accomplish a
lot this vear."
