# New senate's first meeting full of bickering over rules
## Concerns raised about senate chair Warsh 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The election of a new deputy senate
chair was one of the few decisions that
came out of last night's ASSU senate meet
ing, which was otherwise mostly dominated
by bickering over rules.
In the first real meeting of next year's
senate, graduate senator Neil Crellin, a doc
toral candidate in statistics, was elected the
deputy senate chair for next year by a 13-3
vote. The senate then unanimously voted to
approve his selection.
Crellin was opposed by undergraduate
senator Travis Katz, a freshman, who ran
as a write-in candidate because he failed to
submit an application to senate chair Kevin
Warsh 48 hours before the meeting.
Crellin said he was excited about the pos
sibility of serving as deputy senate chair. He
called the post "mostly an administrative
job to ensure that the senate runs
smoothly."
The deputy senate chair's major respon
sibilities include preparing the agenda
packets for each meeting and serving as
senate chair if Warsh is not at a meeting.
Although questions of partisanship were
generally not raised during the debate over
deputy senate chair, several concerns were
voiced about senate chair Warsh.
Undergraduate senator Jason Snyder,

who is not affiliated with
either party, accused
Warsh, a junior, of being
partisan and expressing
support for Crellin.
Crellin is a Students
First senator, and Warsh
was widely considered the
Students First senate chair
candidate against Solina
Kwan, the candidate gen-

erally supported by People's Platform sena
tors.
"It is out of line for the senate chair to
take a position on the deputy senate chair,"
said Snyder, a freshman. "I now see a big
partisan position in this debate . . . and it
appears that the deputy senate chair will be
a position aligned with one party or the
other."
Warsh did not respond to the accusation
during the meeting, but junior Raphe Beck,
a Hammer and Coffin senator, said he "did
not see much partisan debate" and "would
hate to start that type of thing now."
In other senate action, junior Jason
Moore was confirmed as hearings officer for
next year's election. Moore, who served in
the position this year, was approved unani
mously.
"Based on my work in the last election, I
