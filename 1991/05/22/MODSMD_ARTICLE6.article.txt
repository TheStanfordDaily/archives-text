# Women's activist decries objectification
## 
### Jen Jauquet 
In the 19705, Ann Simonton
only had to smile and strike a
pose to make hundreds of dol
lars an hour Her picture was
spread across the pages of
numerous magazines, and she
was even a Sports Illustrated
swimsuit cover girl.
Today she spends the major
ity of her hours speaking out
against objectification of
women in the media and the
dangers of this "dehumaniza
tion."
Simonton packed Roble
lounge last night with her pow
erful slide show and narration,
"Sex, Power and the Media —
Rethinking the Myths of the
American Dream Girl." This
marked her 21st visit to the
Stanford campus in seven
years.
She warned students that
apathy toward the media's por
trayal of women is creating a
"dangerous, hateful society."
She said she feels that these
images warp views about both
sexes and are responsible for
much of the violence directed
at women.

Ann Simonton speaks and presents a slide show to a crowd in Roble lounge last night about the dan
gers of objectifying women in the media. The former model said she believes that media images warp
views about both sexes and are a cause of much of the violence against women.
protests and touring campuses,
Simonton publishes a quarterly
publication called Media Watch,
which is "dedicated to empower
ing individuals to take an active
role in improving women's image
in the media."
As a former model, Simonton
said she knows the manipulation
and degradation that models
endure. As a gang-rape victim,
Simonton said she knows too well
the anger and hatred of men who
see women "only as objects or
pretty pictures and fail to see
them as humans."
Simonton discussed her days
as a model and tried to shattered
manv of the mvths about the

world of modeling.
She said she believes models
are selling their bodies and are no
different than prostitutes. She
challenged the audience to recon
sider their perceptions of models
as "glamorous" and prostitutes as
"cheap."
In June 1971, Simonton was
gang-raped by three men on her
way to a modeling assignment in
New York City. She continued her
career until a picture of her in a
suggestive bedding advertisement
appeared in the San Francisco
Chronicle on the eight-year
anniversary of her rape.
Something snapped, she said.
From that day on, she realized
modeling was "taking women's
humanity away" and that "vio
lence often ensued," she said.
Simonton told the audience
that the media dangerously por

trays women as defenseless, lust
ful objects who actually enjoy pain
and maltreatment. Her countless
slides of women in degradingly
provocative positions, of women
helplessly supine and of women
smiling as they are being beaten
or abused supported her strong
statements.
The first 20 minutes of the
slide show consisted of common
advertisements and posters.
"We have become numb to
these images," she said. "We
expose our children to these dam
aging pictures of the supposed
ideal."
Simonton added that she
believes many young girls develop
eating disorders because every
fashion model they see in a maga
zine is lithe and fat-free. The pres
sure to have perfect "parts" drives
them to restrictive dieting.
She also finds the latest
"superwoman" image — the
woman who effortlessly balances
career, family and beauty —
"emotionally, physically and spiri
tually harmful."
As Simonton clicked to slides of
legs, headless torsos and breasts,
she lamented, "Women have come
to look at themselves in pieces.
They rarely experience them
selves as full, complete human
beings."
Many men also encourage this
attitude by frequently compli

menting women on specific parts
of their bodies and rarely consid
ering the entire person, she said.
As Simonton turned to the
hardcore portion of her presenta
tion, some students winched
noticeably. Many looked away
from the full-color, pornographic
slides of women.
One student who left the pre
sentation early remarked, "I
really wanted to hear what she
had to say, but I just don't have
the stomach for those pictures.
They're just too sick."
After showing one particularly
shocking shot from Hustler maga
zine, Simonton apologized to the
crowd for the graphic slides. She
said that although she had no
intention of offending anyone, she
purposely included the startling
pictures for "shock effect."
Simonton added that she
believes people ignore the exis
tence of pornography and will
begin to take action only after
they have been "confronted by
their own hypocrisy."
"Remember, a community
becomes what it tolerates," she
said.

believes many young girls develop
eating disorders because every
fashion model they see in a maga
zine is lithe and fat-free. The pres
sure to have perfect "parts" drives
them to restrictive dieting.
She also finds the latest
"superwoman" image — the
woman who effortlessly balances
career, family and beauty —
"emotionally, physically and spiri
tually harmful."
As Simonton clicked to slides of
legs, headless torsos and breasts,
she lamented, "Women have come
to look at themselves in pieces.
They rarely experience them
selves as full, complete human
beings."
Many men also encourage this
attitude by frequently compli

menting women on specific parts
of their bodies and rarely consid
ering the entire person, she said.
As Simonton turned to the
hardcore portion of her presenta
tion, some students winched
noticeably. Many looked away
from the full-color, pornographic
slides of women.
One student who left the pre
sentation early remarked, "I
really wanted to hear what she
had to say, but I just don't have
the stomach for those pictures.
They're just too sick."
After showing one particularly
shocking shot from Hustler maga
zine, Simonton apologized to the
crowd for the graphic slides. She
said that although she had no
intention of offending anyone, she
purposely included the startling
pictures for "shock effect."
Simonton added that she
believes people ignore the exis
tence of pornography and will
begin to take action only after
they have been "confronted by
their own hypocrisy."
"Remember, a community
becomes what it tolerates," she
said.
