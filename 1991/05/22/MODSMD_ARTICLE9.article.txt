# Prof. explores science and gender

### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
Scientists need to re-evaluate their historically
masculine approach to science and understand the
value of different perspectives, UC-Berkeley Prof.
Evelyn Keller told a 90-member audience in Tresid
der Union's Oak Lounge yesterday.
Keller, professor of Rhetoric and Women's Studies
with a doctorate in physics from Harvard University,
acknowledged that the masculine scientific tradition
has been very successful. "How do you argue with
success?" she asked.
However, scientists need to ask themselves if any
other vision can work as well, she said.
Keller, whose works have been translated into five
languages, has published articles on gender and sci
ence, biomathematics and physics. She edited a book
titled "Reflections on Gender and Science" and
wrote about the work of geneticist Barbara McClin
tock.
In a speech which leaned heavily on feminist the
ory, Keller questioned the validity of equating objec
tivity with masculinity, a practice common through
out the history of science. She also took to task Fran
cis Bacon, who said the mind equals male and that
nature equals woman.
Quoting a 17th-century scientist, Keller
responded, "The mind has no sex. . . . Nature's not a
woman, and should be an 'it.' "
Society's sexist language prevents the inclusion of
other viewpoints, she said. "There is a problem in
the very language which binds us as authors and
readers."
Discussing the different approaches to scientific
research, she said feminists have "undermined the
innocence of the desire to dominate nature without
saying what's wrong with" that desire. Keller said
the drive to dominate nature could lead to the desire
to dominate people.

She said science utilizes different languages,
including one in which domination is seen as appro
priate and useful, and another which espouses "a
kinship and a feeling for organisms.
"Which ends are appropriate?" she asked.
Keller acknowledged that questions concerning
the meaning of gender "might seem fairly ridiculous
to people who are not familiar with the torturous
debates" over the subject.
She noted that different cultures sort people dif
ferently, some by size, some by age, others by color,
wealth or wisdom. However, Keller said, all cultures
sort people by sex.
Even though sex is given to humans by nature,
she said, people need to realize that masculine and
feminine personality characteristics are products of
society, or gender indoctrination.
"Feminism introduced the concept of gender,' she
said, rhetorically asking the audience what gender
differences mean. "One is not born — but rather
becomes a woman," she said.
Keller said a professional and intellectual rift
exists between feminists and women in science, who
currently form a "precarious coalition." Because of
differences over the meaning of gender, the two
groups have been "rendered into alien, noncommu
nicating species."
She concluded by recommending that science be
recast in terms of humanity's survival, rather than
domination of nature.
Responding to a question about what form this
new science would take, she said it was "beyond my
comprehension." Keller said biology has a rich his
tory of multiple traditions, but physics, her own
field, has "too monolithic a history" to understand
what alternate traditions could form.
Keller's speech was the first-ever Deborah Rhode
Lecture. Rhode, who served from 1986 to 1990 as
director of the Institute for Women's Studies, is now
a professor at the Law School.
