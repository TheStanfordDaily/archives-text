# New cost bill sent to House
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A bill limiting the administra
tive expenses universities can
claim as indirect costs of
research was approved yesterday
by the House Committee on Sci
ence, Space and Technology.
The measure, which is similar
to a White House proposal
unveiled last week, represents
an attempt by Congress to put
an end to "misbehavior" by
Stanford and other research uni
versities, Rep. Rick Boucher, D-
Va., said in an interview yester
day.
The proposed legislation caps
at 26 percent the administrative
component of indirect-cost
recovery on grants and contracts
disbursed by the National Science
Foundation. Boucher offered the
measure as an amendment to a
bill reauthorizing funding for the
granting agency.
Prior to last month's drastic
reduction of Stanford's indirect
cost rate, the University received
the equivalent of 27.6 percent of
its direct costs of research in the
form of administrative overhead,
according to University Con
troller Frank Riddle. Paul Biddle,
the Navy regulator who sparked
the controversy over Stanford's
cost recovery, says that figure had
been closer to 34 percent and still
sits above 30 percent.
Whatever the numbers, a cap
on administrative expenses — one
of the largest components of indi
rect-cost recovery — is expected to
be costly for Stanford and other
major research universities.
Boucher's amendment would
apply only to grants and contracts
funded through the National Sci
ence Foundation. The agency
sponsors about 10 percent of fed
eral research at Stanford.
But the passage of Boucher's
amendment by the full science
committee yesterday offered fur
ther evidence of the direction fed
eral indirect-cost reform is mov
ing — both in Congress and in the
executive branch.
Boucher said yesterday he
expected the science committee to
draft additional legislation within
the next several months that

would cap administrative costs on
grants and contracts from all
agencies, lie said his amendment
affecting National Science foun
dation grants was "a step along
the way."
Acting separately, the House
Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment passed a measure
earlier this month that caps
administrative costs on National
Institutes of Health grants at the
same 26 percent level. The bill is
now pending before its parent
committee, Energy and Com
merce.
And last week the White House
offered a similar proposal of its
own. The initiative, announced bv
Richard Darman, director of the
Office of Management and Bud
get, would apply to all federal
granting agencies. Carman's
office is responsible for formulat
ing federal rules on indirect-cost
recovery. His proposal, aimed at
combating university "abuses,"
will be published in the Federal
Register and undergo a period of
review.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, was
reluctant yesterday to assess the
potential impact of the various
proposals on Stanford. The 26
percent cap "does seem too low,"
Horton said.
"But we are in what can only
be called a perilous situation in
this whole matter. . . . It's too
early to be overly critical about
attempts to reform the system."
Higher education lobbyists
estimate that about 75 universi
ties have administrative reim

bursements above 26 percent.
The institutions, they say, stand
to lose $100 million annually if
administrative costs are capped at
that level.
Boucher said his proposed cap
is necessary to restore the
integrity of the funding system in
the eyes of the public. "Universi
ties have misbehaved," he said.
"The public has a deep suspicion
of the process."
Most of the negative publicity
Stanford has received since last
fall has resulted from costs
included in its administrative
accounts, such as flowers,
antiques and catering bills at Lou
Henry Hoover House, the resi
dence of University President
Donald Kennedy.
Boucher is also proposing that
a special committee be formed to
clarify what costs should be con
sidered allowable under federal
rules. The controversy that has
erupted at Stanford and other
universities results largely from
"gray areas" in regulations, he
said.
The committee would be
chaired by the director of the
Office of Science and Technology
Policy and include representatives
from the Departments of Defense,
Energy, and Health and Human
Services; the Office of Manage
ment and Budget; the National
Science Foundation; and up to five
representatives of "the higher
education community."
The Office of Management and
Budget has proposed creating a
similar panel, but its version
would not include university rep
resentatives.
