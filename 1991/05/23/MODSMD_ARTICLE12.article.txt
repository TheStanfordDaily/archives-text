Gandhi's death expected to
cause political realignments
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — The turmoil fol
lowing the death of former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi could usher in a realignment of
forces in India's intensely personal political
arena.
Gandhi's assassination Tuesday could bring
an end to a dynasty that ruled India for 37 of its
43 years of independence. It could unify the
country in a vote of sympathy for Gandhi's wife
and his Congress Party. Or it could bolster the
fortunes of the right-wing opposition.
The death of the former prime minister
came as India was engaged in divisive, bloody
general elections, which the Congress Party
was forecast to win. Now the murder has
unraveled all the theories and consigned pre
dictions to the trash bin.
House approves defense budget
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House yester
day approved a $291 billion defense budget
that makes wholesale cuts in President Bush's
request for the B-2 stealth bomber and the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
The House voted 268-161 for the bill, which
also gives military women and dependents
overseas access to abortions in military hospi
tals if they are willing to pay the costs.
Bush has threatened to veto the bill for not
meeting the money levels he set for strategic
weapons and because it does not cut reserve
forces as much as he wanted.
Proponents of the military blueprint for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 said it reflects the
end of the Cold War and the lessons learned
from the Persian Gulf war.
The abortion provision, which could affect
some 65,000 military women and 400,000
dependents, was approved on a vote of 220-208.
Australian nun among 18 killed
by guerrilla violence in Peru
LIMA, Peru (AP) — An Australian nun and
at least 17 other people were killed by Shining
Path rebels in the worst wave of guerrilla vio
lence in nearly a year, police and news reports
said yesterday.
Following the 24 hours of violence in the
central Andes region, the government placed a
state of emergency on two more provinces in
the popular Arequipa tourist area and extended
the order in eight other mountain provinces.
