ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) —
With rebels pushing toward the capi
tal, Ethiopia's acting president
appealed yesterday night for a cease
fire, pledging to form an interim gov
ernment to halt an "indescribably bit
ter" civil war.
But two main guerrilla armies,
smelling victory the day after Presi
dent Mengistu Haile Mariam fled into
exile, rejected the cease-fire.
The Ethiopian People's Revolution
ary Democratic Front said it would
crush the remnants of Mengistu's bru
tal 17-year dictatorship. The truce also
was rejected by the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front. There was no imme
diate word from a third group, the
Oromo Liberation Front.
But Lt. Gen. Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan
told a nationwide television and radio
audience that his government was

pressing for a favorable response from
the rebels.
"War is indescribably bitter,"
Gebre-Kidan said. "On behalf of the
Ethiopian people who have been shed
ding their blood for so long, I appeal
for peace.
"We are ready to establish an
interim government with all parties,
with third party observers.
"We are ready to go to London for
peace talks on the 27th [of May.]
"We will not stop there. There is
nothing we are not prepared to do."
The London peace talks are to be
presided <sver by the U.S. assistant sec
retary of state for African affairs, Her
man Cohen.
Gebre-Kidan first proposed a cease
fire Tuesday, shortly after taking over
the reins of government from
Mengistu, who resigned the presidency

and fled to Zimbabwe.
Intense diplomatic efforts were
under way in Addis Ababa and Wash
ington, D.C. to arrange a cease-fire.
It appeared the rebels were waffling
on what sources said was a deal
arranged by the United States for
Mengistu's departure in exchange for
a cease-fire and meaningful negotia
tions between the warring parties.
But Tigrean rebel spokesperson
Asefa Mamo said the rebels still
planned to attend the London talks.
The Eritrean rebels have fought for
full independence of the northernmost
Red Sea province for 30 years. They
and the People's Revolutionary Demo
cratic Front, whose original goal was
greater autonomy for Tigre province,
control roughly one-third of northern
Ethiopia. The Oromo people inhabit a
large part of southern and eastern

Ethiopia. They demand greater autor
omy and have engaged govern men
forces in hit-and-run raids.
The Tigrean rebels said they ha
advanced to Addis Alem, 34 miles we. c
of Addis Ababa, and vowed to push o
until a peace agreement was signed <
the government was "completel
wiped out."
In a clandestine broadcast, th
rebels said Mengistu's flight was nc
enough to make them lay down th
arms they took up in 1975.
