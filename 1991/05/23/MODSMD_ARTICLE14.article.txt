NEW DELHI, India (AP) — As her husband's
body lay in state, the Italian-born widow of former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was chosen yesterday
to lead his Congress Party through national elec
tions.
In many parts of India, violence replaced sorrow
over Gandhi's assassination. At least nine people
were killed. The army was called out and curfews
were imposed in several towns after Gandhi support
ers attacked police and members of rival political
parties.
At Gandhi's childhood home in New Delhi, mean
while, hundreds of mourners filed past his body,
weeping and beating their chests.
The 46-year-old former prime minister was killed
in a bomb explosion Tuesday night in the southern
Indian town of Sriperambudur, minutes before he
was to address a crowded election rally. At least 15
other people also died.
Police said Gandhi appeared to have been the tar
get of a suicide assassin who had strapped explosives
to her body and detonated them as she approached
him with a bouquet.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility
that were taken seriously by police. "It's completely
blind," said one officer involved in the investigations.
Congress Party leaders announced they had
unanimously chosen Sonia Gandhi, 43, to lead the
party through the remaining voting for national elec
tions.
Elections for a new Parliament started Monday.
They were to have been completed Sunday but have
been postponed until mid-June.
