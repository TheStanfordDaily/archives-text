ASSU Senators were
consistent well after
their eleventh hour

Last Thursday was the
final meeting of an ASSU
Senate that ended the year
much as it had spent it: with a lot
of hot air, a lot of shaking heads
and a late-night spectacle that
seemed less like an important leg
islative debate than a vaguely
amusing contest of wills.
Few students will shed a tear
that this year's senate has met for
the last time. Even fewer stayed up
until 3 a.m. to see the senate's
marathon meeting to a close.
The senate deserves credit for
trying to finish the 1991-92 budget
at its last meeting, rather than
dumping the work on its succes
sors. But it's hard to get excited
about the compromises that the
senate finally hammered out at the
end of its eight-hour session.
A number of senators made an
attempt to reduce the funding of
the ASSU Financial Aid Office, a
political lobby office with which
most Stanford students are unen
thusiastic.
But instead of eliminating or
reducing the office's financial sup
port of the United States Student
Association — the source of stu
dents' skepticism — the senate
decided to eliminate salaries for
students staffing the office.
In effect, the senate cut the one
part of the Financial Aid Office
with which most students don't
have a problem.
That wasn't all. An equally
determined group of senators,
vowing their antipathy to Stan
ford's fraternities and sororities,
prevented two sorority-sponsored
charity events from getting any
funding at all.

Anchor Splash, a fall campus
event held by the Delta Gamma
sorority to support the blind, and
Theta Breakers, a run-for-charity
event held by the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority, were denied the
funding they have received in
recent years.
The arguments used for remov
ing the ASSU's support for these
campus-wide events just don't
make sense. The claim that such
charity events don't deserve ASSU
funding because they don't involve
"direct community service" — that
is, face-to-face community work —
was applied selectively, to sorori
ties alone.
Fraternity-sponsored events,
like Kappa Alpha's mud volleyball
and the Sigma Phi Epsilon frater
nity's Dish-Dash, were unmolested
by the senate, as were charity
events that aren't sponsored by
members of the Greek system.
Events like Anchor Splash and
Theta Breakers are open to the
entire Stanford community, and
invariably raise much more money
for charity than the ASSU con
tributes as startup costs.
By placing anti-Greek stereo
types at the center of the senate's
debate, senators missed the chance
to fund two meaningful philan
thropic events.
Showing a glimmer of good judg
ment, the senate did manage to
allocate $45,000 to fund the Sexual
Assault Prevention, Education and
Response Office. The office will
provide much-needed sexual
assault services to students next
year.
The senate also allowed Project
Motivation, a volunteer student
group that helps underprivileged
high school students prepare for
college, to apply for additional
funding. Unfortunately the group
will still be far short of its original
fee request, which was inadver
tently left off the ballot in this
spring's general election.
