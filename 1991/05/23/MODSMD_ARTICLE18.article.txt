## Memories of conflict 
### 
My bittersweet memories
of Stanford will include the stan
dard college experiences: dorm
life, academic frustrations, personal
growth and friendships.
But as a woman of color and a person
particularly interested in issues of race, I
will also take away with me a memory of
the violent mood swing of Stanford's
political and racial climate.
The class of 1991 arrived at Stanford
in the fall of 1987 in an atmosphere that
was highly charged. The campus was con
vulsed by the debate of whether or not to
change the Western Culture requirement
to make it more accurately reflect the
experiences and contributions of racial
minorities and women.
The great debate marked the begin
ning, for myself and many other students,
of a re-evaluation of the education that
we had received up until then, and an
understanding of how we had been social
ized to think about racial minorities.
For people of color, it was a more per
sonal dilemma because it concerned the
education we had been receiving about
ourselves. As I saw it, the Faculty Senate
was deciding whether or not we would
continue to be ignored by American soci
ety and education.
The fact that the Western Culture
requirement was actually changed to Cul
tures, Ideas and Values is one of my
favorite memories of Stanford. It gave me
faith in Stanford as an institution. For a
while during those early years, I believed
that multiculturalism at Stanford would
be given a chance.
Student politics at Stanford seemed to

support that conclusion. Events at the
ASSU are seldom as earthshaking as we
like to think. They are, however, the
materialization of students' political
thought.
The creation of a multipartisan politi
cal party in the ASSU marked an impor
tant event in student politics. The Peo
ple's Platform coalesced the various
groups of students of color and soon
became perceived as their primary politi
cal advocate on campus.
The Student's First party, on the other
hand, was seen as the alternative to the
People's Platform — one that, as its name
suggests, wanted to represent students'
needs, not what they saw as a political
agenda.
In my own opinion, Student's First has
an undeniable political agenda of its own;
they are, after all, a political party. Fur
thermore, it was a political agenda that in
many ways countered that of the People's
Platform. It created a political schism
right down the middle of the student
body.
There have been other political mile
stones that stirred the campus, like the
takeover of University President Donald
Kennedy's office during spring quarter of
1989 and Ingrid Nava's fiery "My name is
Ingrid Nava and I have something to say"
speech to freshmen last year.
Four years after the Western Culture
debate, the backlash against multicultur
alism is in full swing. Stanford is not the
liberal bastion that the national media
seems to think.
I still feel that multiculturalism is
important and relevant to Stanford and

that its goals have definitely not been ful
filled here. Multiculturalism has been
truncated before it could even get a good
start.
The most fashionable argument
against multiculturalism today is that it
is "antithetical to the goals of an aca
demic community" or that it has gone too
far. I disagree. It is preposterous to
assume that racism has ceased to exist at
Stanford or that it has taken a violent
turn against the white male.
In retrospect, all involved, including
myself, have reason to be self-critical; we
may even have a regret or two. For
myself, I know that I have spent a great
deal of time at Stanford perplexed and
angry at its various political players.
The personal memories that we will
take from Stanford will be more impor
tant to us 30 years from now than the
names of the political players that are so
prominent at Stanford today. But for
those whose personal memories are inti
mately tied to Stanford's politics because
we felt we had a stake in them, the mem
ories of those controversies will continue
to be a source of inspiration and of chal
lenge.
