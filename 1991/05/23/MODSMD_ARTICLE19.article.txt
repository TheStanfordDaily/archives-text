Stanford students are lazy, content with mediocrity

STANFORD UNIVERSITY HAS
been described as a place where the
nation's finest are pooled together.
If the effort displayed by those at this
university is reflective of the nation's
finest, then I pity the nation. My experi
ences at Stanford have convinced me
that we are falling far short of excel
lence.
My concern lies in the lack of commit
ment to excellence which is displayed by
the staff, the administration and espe
cially by the students.
The examples are numerous: classes
with poor attendance, professors who
aren't interested in teaching, students
who don't attend section or office hours,
etc. This indicates a serious lack of com
mitment, of excellence, of a hard work
ethic.
This is of great concern to me. What

concerns me even more is that we do not
seem to care. There are countless exam
ples of disinterest in academics. During
the ASSU general election the only cam
paign issue even remotely related to aca
demics was the question of better library
hours. Stanford's endless cultural clubs
and various other organizations consis
tently emphasize everything but scholas
tic achievement.
We are far too concerned with all that
is superficial and extra at this university.
Have we forgotten what the heart and
soul of a university is? The root of a uni
versity that wants to be a leader, that
wants to be great, is hard work, commit
ment and the desire to improve in every
capacity, especially in its academic excel
lence.
On this campus, I do see very
admirable desires to make this univer-

sity the most culturally diverse and the
most fun of the nation's major universi
ties. This results in massive amounts of
money being poured into non-academic
and culturally stimulating activities.
These, however, are the secondary fea
tures of the school, its flowers and its
fruit. The root of the university may not
be its prettiest part or its most entertain
ing part, but without it, all of the fruit
and flowers cannot be borne.
Stanford's most important activities
take place in the classroom, in the
library and in the residence where the
student acquires the skills and habits
that will carry him or her through life.
"Getting by" academically shouldn't
be considered enough, because we will
not long be a standard of greatness with
that attitude.
Stanford University should start a

campaign for excellence and get back to
work to stop the apparent decay. Other
wise we will become a university that is
mediocre in academics, but has lots of
great extras.
What would such a campaign do for
us? It would signal to the world that
Stanford believes in the classroom, that
hard work here is considered not a nec
essary evil but a challenge from which
we draw satisfaction.
Renewed academic vigor should go
along with the promotion of fun and
games, multiculturalism and all the
other extras at which Stanford already
excels.
I hope we can rise above this medi
ocrity; we are wasting opportunity,
potential and time.
