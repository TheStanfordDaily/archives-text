# Decision to use drugs is not always one of rational deliberation

In his letter to The Daily, Emmett
Witchell claimed that many who oppose
Stuart Reges hold the paternalistic belief
that laws should be passed in order to
protect tne general populace from mak
ing the "wrong choice" about drugs.
Thus, according to Witchell, many critics
of Reges make the assumption that the
masses are ignorant.
Witchell is wrong in his assumption
that drug use is the product of rational
decision-making. While some individuals,
including Reges himself, choose to use
drugs after clear and rational delibera
tion, the logical reasoning abilities of
others may be clouded by a number of
factors.
Colleges are replete with influences,

such as depression, stress and peer pres
sure, that cloud rational judgment. One
of my friends dropped out of college after
getting involved with drugs in his third
year at school; it was depression and
stress that led him to experiment with
"non-addictive" drugs.
