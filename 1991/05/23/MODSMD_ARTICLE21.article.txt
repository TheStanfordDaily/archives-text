# University is heeding recommendations of Task Force on assault
## 
### 
The following is an open letter to the
members of the Task Force on Sexual
Assault. Previously, I said that I would
write again when I had more definitive
information on how the various recom
mendations would be addressed. Here,
then, is additional information about the
response to those recommendations.
The Committee of 15, which has the

authority to review problem areas in and
to propose changes to the student judi
cial process, has met three times and has
drafted changes to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter in the areas of victim
rights and the cooperation of witnesses
and students accused of misconduct. The
committee is planning a public forum to
discuss these and other possible changes.
The forum will be held on May 28, from
6 to 8 p.m., in the Oak West Lounge of
Tresidder Union.
Progress is being made in developing a
policy statement concerning unaccept
able sexual conduct. The statement,
which we expect will be announced by
the president before the beginning of the
1991-92 academic year, will subsume the
current policy on Sexual harassment, will
cover sexual harassment, sexual assault
and other forms of unacceptable conduct
and will be responsive to federal require
ments on the prevention and reporting of
sexual assault on college and university
campuses. The policy will apply to facul
ty and staff as well as to students.

Gail Nelligan, a psychiatrist at Coun
seling and Psychological Services, has
established a response'team for survivors
of sexual assault that provides support as
well as informed and sensitive referrals
for services both at Stanford and off
campus. The team is working effectively
and is currently helping several survivors
of sexual assault.
Finally, I have established a coordi
nating council, chaired by Pat Fabiano,
director of health promotions for Cowell
Student Health Center and Christine
Griffith, leader of the Rape Response
Group, to pull together the many staff
members and students who are working
in the area of sexual assault education
and prevention. Through its meetings,
the council members will be able to coor
dinate and inform their efforts, identify
ing redundancies and overlooked areas,
and to brainstorm together on the cru
cial challenge of combating rape, assault
and other forms of sexual misconduct.
