The Cardinal men's tennis

After three consecutive NCAA
team titles — 15 straight tourna

It was disappointing, even sad

even get to the quarters.
There isn't a lot of domination in the sport any
more. And there's also just plain luck involved. The
luck of the draw. Of individual rallies. Of line calls.
"There is luck involved. All teams play well but
there are other facts as well as tennis [that count],"
said Turbow. "There are lots of variables, and you
hope for a little luck."
In fact, until they lost this year, Cardinal competi
tors didn't consider how much luck went into win
ning the past three titles.
"We were extremely lucky my freshman year,"
Turbow said. "We were almost down 4-2 after sin
gles but Dave Wheaton came back from match point
and won to even it up at 3-3 [in the semis]. And last
year some guys' matches made it a lot easier. It was
almost 3-3 but Glenn [Solomon] pulled out a three
set, four-hour match and we went up 4-2."
And now that the Cardinal's luck has run out —
it could easily have been 3-3 and maybe even 4-2
after singles if a couple points had gone the other
way Monday — the team realizes it's not the end of
the world.
Winning NCAAs is Stanford's ultimate goal every
season. It's what the team works for every day in
practice, every weekend in matches. But failing to
bring back the title does not mean the season was a
failure, or the team is not talented.
Stanford ended the season 21-5 — not exactly a
shameful record. The Cardinal is still one of the best
teams this year. And going down in the semis does
nothing to affect the fact that Stanford continues to
be the best all-around program with the nation's
leading coaches in Dick Gould and John Whitlinger.
Stanford players are very disappointed — not
about terminating The Streak but over the fact that
they didn't reach their ultimate goal. But now the
team realizes how difficult it is to pile up national
championships.
"There's been lots of disappointment, though
before I never thought of it as a streak. Each one is
special and different," Solomon said. "[But] it
wasn't until we lost for the first time [of my career]
that I looked back and said, 'I've been really lucky to
win three of these things.' "
And because they did not win it all this season
does not mean that Stanford's reign as a perennial
tennis powerhouse is over. So USC won. The Cardi
nal can definitely come back and regain the title next
season.
"The guys are upset, but people who accept the
challenge of Stanford are resilient and the guys on
the tennis team show that year in, year out,"
Solomon said. "We didn't win the national champi
onship — the benchmark we set for success — but
the guys will come back more resolved next year and
try to win again."
Even without a national title, the Farm should be
proud. You can't get much better than Stanford ten
nis.

even get to the quarters.
There isn't a lot of domination in the sport any
more. And there's also just plain luck involved. The
luck of the draw. Of individual rallies. Of line calls.
"There is luck involved. All teams play well but
there are other facts as well as tennis [that count],"
said Turbow. "There are lots of variables, and you
hope for a little luck."
In fact, until they lost this year, Cardinal competi
tors didn't consider how much luck went into win
ning the past three titles.
"We were extremely lucky my freshman year,"
Turbow said. "We were almost down 4-2 after sin
gles but Dave Wheaton came back from match point
and won to even it up at 3-3 [in the semis]. And last
year some guys' matches made it a lot easier. It was
almost 3-3 but Glenn [Solomon] pulled out a three
set, four-hour match and we went up 4-2."
And now that the Cardinal's luck has run out —
it could easily have been 3-3 and maybe even 4-2
after singles if a couple points had gone the other
way Monday — the team realizes it's not the end of
the world.
Winning NCAAs is Stanford's ultimate goal every
season. It's what the team works for every day in
practice, every weekend in matches. But failing to
bring back the title does not mean the season was a
failure, or the team is not talented.
Stanford ended the season 21-5 — not exactly a
shameful record. The Cardinal is still one of the best
teams this year. And going down in the semis does
nothing to affect the fact that Stanford continues to
be the best all-around program with the nation's
leading coaches in Dick Gould and John Whitlinger.
Stanford players are very disappointed — not
about terminating The Streak but over the fact that
they didn't reach their ultimate goal. But now the
team realizes how difficult it is to pile up national
championships.
"There's been lots of disappointment, though
before I never thought of it as a streak. Each one is
special and different," Solomon said. "[But] it
wasn't until we lost for the first time [of my career]
that I looked back and said, 'I've been really lucky to
win three of these things.' "
And because they did not win it all this season
does not mean that Stanford's reign as a perennial
tennis powerhouse is over. So USC won. The Cardi
nal can definitely come back and regain the title next
season.
"The guys are upset, but people who accept the
challenge of Stanford are resilient and the guys on
the tennis team show that year in, year out,"
Solomon said. "We didn't win the national champi
onship — the benchmark we set for success — but
the guys will come back more resolved next year and
try to win again."
Even without a national title, the Farm should be
proud. You can't get much better than Stanford ten
nis.

Debbie Spander's column normally appears Wednes
days. Unfortunately, she was too busy lamenting the
fact she had never covered an NCAA champ.
The volley slammed into the
green, ricocheted off the
court and zipped past the
flailing racket. The doubles part
ners jumped in the air, then
approached the net as teammates
dropped rackets and shouted in
excitement.
The vanquished mumbled con
gratulations while stumbling off
the courts, heads hung low.
For the first time in four years
the guys celebrating in Henry
Feild Stadium weren't wearing
Cardinal and White. Stanford
players were the ones with the
blank looks and drooping shoul
ders.

The Cardinal men's tennis
team was defeated by USC in the
semifinals of this year's national
tournament, halting an amazing
streak and dashing a whole bunch
of expectations.
After three consecutive NCAA
team titles — 15 straight tourna
ment matches — Stanford lost.
It was disappointing, even sad
dening, but not unrealistic. To
win a national men's tennis title
year after year is just not feasible
these days.
Yes, Stanford had won three in
a row, four out of five, and 11 of
19.
v es, Stanford is a veiy talented
squad with tremendous individual
ability and great depth.
Yes, Stanford had a 19-4 dual
match record and a lot of late-sea
son momentum.
But winning the NCAA cham
pionship is really difficult, espe
cially in these days of national
parity. It appears as if tennis fans
