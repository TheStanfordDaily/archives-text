# Stark beaten, two advance in singles

### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
For the second year in a row,
there will be no singles title for
Jonathan Stark.
The collegiate tennis sensation
— a favorite to go all the way both
last season and this week — was
once again ousted from the NCAA
individual draw.
The Cardinal sophomore, the
tournament's fifth seed, was
upset by Mark Jeffrey of Missis
sippi State 6-4, 6-4 in the first
round of singles competition yes
terday.
Coming off a disappointing
team loss in the semifinals Mon
day, Stark played sluggishly and
failed to take advantage of his
usually potent serve-and-volley
game against the senior from Aus
tralia. Stark lost serve early in the
first set and never broke back,
trailing the entire set.
"It was one of those matches
where neither player could quite
take charge," said Stanford coach
Dick Gould. "Mark wasn't over
powering but Jon couldn't get in a
groove to take charge."
After going behind by a set,
Stark stayed in the match, but
never led. Jeffrey was able to mix
up his game — keeping Stark at
the unfamiliar baseline and deny
ing him chances to attack.
"Stark tries to attack so much,
coming in all the time, that I just
wanted to keep the ball on the
baseline and get him frustrated,"
Jeffrey said. "I did that, and he
started coming in on the wrong
balls and I got into a groove."
Jeffrey was able to take the
advantage late in the second set,
and after breaking Stark took his
game up a notch and closed the
match out.
"It was a disappointing loss for
Jon [because] it was a match he
was certainly capable of winning,
though Jeffrey was the better
player today," Gould said.
Stanford's remaining two sin
gles competitors fared signifi
cantly better. Alex O'Brien
downed 20th ranked Tony Bujan

of Texas Christian 6-4, 7-5 and
Jared Palmer held off a tenacious
Jason Rubell 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to
advance to the second round.
O'Brien continued his persis
tent play to down the talented
Bujan. Although 0.8. also
appeared to be playing a little
sluggishly, he stayed in the base
line duel and held on to early
advantages.
The No. 3 seed broke Bujan
early in the first set, then sat back
at the baseline and waited for the
junior to falter.
"I was a little tired but I played
some pretty solid points, kept the
ball deep and kept him running,"
O'Brien said.
Bujan refused to fold, hitting
well-placed shots and fighting up
through the final point, but
O'Brien maintained the upper
hand. "Bujan can be dangerous,"
Gould said. "He has a big, quick
serve and a big forehand, but Alex
was able to stay on him and wait
him out."
Palmer had a little more trou
ble with Duke's doubles specialist
Rubell. Stanford's other sopho
more serve-and-volley talent had
problems returning Rubell's big
serve. When Palmer did get the
ball into play, Rubell attacked
with potent volleys unless Palmer
hit a low shot.
After falling behind 5-7, 1-3,
Palmer adapted to Rubell's style
and got into the match, hanging
on for a 6-4 split in the second set.
"Jared did a really good job of
staying in the match," said asst.
coach John Whitlinger. "Rubell is
a dangerous player, but once Jared
broke [in the second set] he played
pretty well."
Neither player found an advan
tage in the final stanza. Palmer
finally broke Rubell at 4-4 and
was serving for the match at 5-4
when Rubell came back swinging,
winning four straight points to
break back and tie things up at
five. After Rubell held, Palmer
returned the favor and the deci
sion came down to a tiebreaker.
