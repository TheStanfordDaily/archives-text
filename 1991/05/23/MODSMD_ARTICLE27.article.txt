# Women struggle to 11th after day one of NCAAs
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's golf team dug
itself into a hole yesterday in the first day of
the NCAA Championships at the Scarlet
Golf Course at Ohio State. Shooting a com
bined 312, the sixth-ranked Cardinal finds
itself in a three-way tie for 11th with Ken
tucky and Texas, 14 strokes behind the cur
rent leader, seventh-ranked Southern
Florida.
"Each and everyone on our team can
play better than they did today," said Cardi
nal coach Tim Baldwin. "My hope is that we
will tomorrow."
The Cardinal handily beat Lamar, Duke,
Tulsa and New Mexico St. earlier this sea
son, all teams that are leading Stanford
after one round. Top-ranked San Jose State
is two strokes off Southern Florida's pace
with a 300 while third-ranked UCLA
rounded out the top three with a 301.
"Everyone was just flat today, a bit ner
vous," Baldwin said. "We didn't play terri
ble, but we didn't play real well."
Despite tli subpar opening round, the
riinal ' i rw» mtmtwi out of 'on

tention. The linksters are only six strokes
behind the top five teams.
"Sure we're disappointed with our start,
but the field really changes in four days,"
said junior Adele Moore, who led the Cardi
nal with a 76 on the 72-par course. "It's
really a game of consistency."
"We're more than capable of a top-five
finish," said junior Martha Richards. "We
need to go out and attack the course. A 312
isn't great, but it's not too bad. We're capa
ble of a 298 or a 300."
The 17th-seeded Moore set herself up
well for a move into the leader's ranks with
her four-over-par finish. "She played really
solid," said Baldwin. "I anticipate her
either staying where she is or improving."
"I hit the ball really well," Moore said. "I
had a lot of opportunities for birdying, but I
only birdied once. But I did make a lot of
good par putts."
Her 76 is five strokes off the leader's
pace and that's the way she likes it after
having led for two rounds last year and
then fading to finish 22nd. "I would rather
come from behind," Moore said. "I need to
concentrate on every shot and not look to
far into the future."

Senior Jodi Figley, playing in her final
tourney as a Cardinal, set the tone for a
Cardinal comeback tomorrow. After hitting
a 43, seven over par, on the front nine, she
went on a tear drilling the last nine holes
with a one under par to finish with a 78 on
the day.
"Jodi staged one heck of a comeback,"
Baldwin said.
"I played the best that I've played all
year in the practice rounds Monday and
Tuesday, and I didn't expect to hit that bad
on the front nine," said Figley. "I was hit
ting well. It was just one of those things
where I didn't score well. At least I finished
on a positive note."
Stephanie Davis, a junior, turned in yet
another steady performance for the Cardi
nal, shooting a 39 on both the front and
back nine holes to finish with a 78, second
best on the squad.
A big hitch for the linksters came with
junior Audrey Wooding's performance on
the final holes. Wooding, ranked 20th in the
nation, played very consistently until she
went five over par on the last four holes.
"They were really stupid errors," said
Wooding, wh shot an 80 to round out the

top four scores for Stanford. "My concen
tration varied a bit."
"Audrey ran into trouble on the 16th,"
said Baldwin. "She hit over the green into
the bushes. Then over the green again.
Then she chipped it 8 feet and missed the
putt."
The Cardinal is counting on a strong
performance tomorrow from its No. 5
player, Richards. Playing in her very first
NCAA Championship — each of the other
Cardinal four have played at least three
times in the NCAA tourney — Richards
shot an 82.
"Martha did quite well considering that
this round was a learning round for her,"
said Baldwin. "I'm looking for good stuff
from her in the next few rounds."
"I had a few bad breaks that I will elimi
nate tomorrow," Richards said. "It was a
nice feeling, but I really didn't think about
it being my first time here."
The second day of play looks to be a good
one with 10 teams only spanning seven
strokes from fourth to 11th place. "The

"I played the best that I've played all
year in the practice rounds Monday and
Tuesday, and I didn't expect to hit that bad
on the front nine," said Figley. "I was hit
ting well. It was just one of those things
where I didn't score well. At least I finished
on a positive note."
Stephanie Davis, a junior, turned in yet
another steady performance for the Cardi
nal, shooting a 39 on both the front and
back nine holes to finish with a 78, second
best on the squad.
A big hitch for the linksters came with
junior Audrey Wooding's performance on
the final holes. Wooding, ranked 20th in the
nation, played very consistently until she
went five over par on the last four holes.
"They were really stupid errors," said
Wooding, wh shot an 80 to round out the

top four scores for Stanford. "My concen
tration varied a bit."
"Audrey ran into trouble on the 16th,"
said Baldwin. "She hit over the green into
the bushes. Then over the green again.
Then she chipped it 8 feet and missed the
putt."
The Cardinal is counting on a strong
performance tomorrow from its No. 5
player, Richards. Playing in her very first
NCAA Championship — each of the other
Cardinal four have played at least three
times in the NCAA tourney — Richards
shot an 82.
"Martha did quite well considering that
this round was a learning round for her,"
said Baldwin. "I'm looking for good stuff
from her in the next few rounds."
"I had a few bad breaks that I will elimi
nate tomorrow," Richards said. "It was a
nice feeling, but I really didn't think about
it being my first time here."
The second day of play looks to be a good
one with 10 teams only spanning seven
strokes from fourth to 11th place. "The
first 13 teams all have a shot at the title
