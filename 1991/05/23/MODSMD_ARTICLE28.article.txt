# Card's high hopes in Hammerin' Hammonds' helping hands
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Jeffrey Hammonds should be a
jerk, plain and simple.
He should be a tolerable pres
ence only because he plays the
game of baseball well enough to
possess the attitude he could
have. You should see him blazing
down Palm Drive with a scooter
full of high octane airplane fuel,
on his way to visit the newest
mega-star of Gaieties. He should
hold bases over his head and tell
people he is the best of all time.
It might annoy people, but they
would probably accept it. After all,
it's not like he doesn't have the
resume to carry the obnoxious dis
position. Young stud comes out of
high school, with hundreds of
thousands of dollars thrust in his
face from the Toronto Blue Jays,
but goes to Stanford instead and
blows the doors off the place in the
process.
Not knowing that freshman do
not do this kind of stuff, Ham
monds hits in 37 straight games (a
Pacific 10 Conference record), fin
ishing the game with a .355 aver
age and 48 stolen bases. In the end
he was named national freshman
of the year and a first-team All-
American. No one else has made

first-team as a freshman in Stan
ford history —nobody.
Best leadoff man in college
baseball? The newspapers start
calling him the next coming of
Rickey Henderson. Autograph
hounds begin sniffing out the cen
ter fielder as soon as the ump has
called the last out.
This year he gets moved to the
cleanup spot to give the team
some more power after leading off
last year. He struggles a bit, and
heading into today's NCAA
regional game with San Diego
State University, the sophomore is
"only" hitting .322 with 13 home
runs and 53 runs batted in.
Yup, Jeffrey Hammonds has
every reason to possess an annoy

ing ego the size of his home state
of New Jersey. But much like the
maligned Garden State, Ham
monds is not what he seems.
Believe it or not, Jersey can be a
pretty place, and the man some
call Hambone sure ain't no jerk.
"It is remarkable to me how
good a player he is, and how well
he handles it," said Stanford sec
ond baseman Chris Kemper. "He
is very light-hearted and good to
be around."
From the start people could tell
that Jeffrey Hammonds was not
your ordinary freshman. Declin
ing the big money of the majors,
Hammonds came to Stanford and

Jeffrey Hammonds may someday be the next Rickey Henderson. Right now, he's too busy trying to lead
the Cardinal into the College World Series to worry about that. Stanford takes on San Diego State in a
first-round regional game at 3:30 p.m. in Fresno.
became an integral part of what
many consider the greatest Cardi
nal club of all time. He did this
right away, and he did it well.
"Jeff doesn't play cocky," said
designated hitter Ryan Turner,
Hammonds' roommate on the
road. "The most impressive thing
about Jeff is the way he handles
the game — he came in as a fresh
man like he'd already played four
years. He has a maturity that's
rare."
Composure is key here. Look
ing to the outfield, you will see
Hammonds smile to himself a lot.
He could take himself seriously,
but he prefers to grin because he
is enjoying his time on the field.
The guy from Scotch Plains has
the perspective to know what he is
playing out there.
"It is a game," said Hammonds.
"Some days are good, some days
are bad, but you can't let it get to
you. From the last at-bat it's still
a game."
A team game that is. A star
complex can be developed when
people forget individuals can't do
it all themselves. Hammonds
move in the lineup is a good case
in point.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
needed more power in the middle
of the order and did not want to
move perennial No. 3 hitter David
McCarty out of the spot to which
he had grown so accustomed. Not
a natural cleanup hitter, Ham
monds did not make it an issue.
He just played.

"I never felt I was a four batter,
but if it will help the team I'll do
it," said Hammonds. "Without a
doubt it's been a success. I did
what I had to do at the four spot."
At 6-foot, 185, Hammonds does
not have the kind of imposing
stature that will scare anybody
away, but he still manages to hit
for power. Part of his job as
cleanup was to produce runs, and
though his average dropped from
last year, he improved on 1990's
seven home runs almost two-fold.
These runs helped the team
win, but as it turned out, his posi
tion at No. 4 wound up having an
even greater indirect effect on the
team's success.
"Dave McCarty would not have
had the kind of year he has if Jeff
were not behind him," said Mar
quess. "He made people have to
pitch to McCarty."
McCarty will likely be named
National Player of the Year next
week, an honor in which Ham
monds has a share. Would
McCarty really have had such a
great year with Jeff still at lead
off?
"I hope to think that he
wouldn't," Hammonds will tell
you with a healthy laugh. "But
whether or not I did [have an
impact], I'll believe it."
Turner says that Hammonds
has a "subtle" confidence, and you
can tell by watching him play. He
will admit that he is not a physical
giant, yet his leg speed helps gen
erate an explosive bat that makes
him ready for any pitch and hit for
power.
Those same legs stole 48 bases
in 53 attempts last year, and 21 in
25 tries this year, good for an .885

career average. People say he can
do it all because he looks like he
can, but that does not mean he is
perfect.
"Sure he can improve," said
Marquess. "He can improve his
defense, he can improve his arm;
but those are not weaknesses, it's
only a matter of playing more "
Playing more is something
Hammonds has thought about a
lot. He took last summer off
because he thought it was the last
one he would be able to spend off
the field.
This year he is invited to the
U.S. national team tryouts, and
would like to go to the Pan-Amer
ican games over the summer and
then the Olympics next year. If all
works out well, the Major Leagues
will follow with its 162 games.
Being up for every game is a skill
Hammonds thinks he needs to
improve.
"I need to work on my mental
toughness," said Hammonds.
"Once you are mentally tough,
everything takes care of itself."
For now the task at hand is in
Fresno, and you can be sure Ham
monds will have no trouble being
tough for the games he will play
this weekend. Surrounding the
games will be the hoopla that
comes with any path to a national
championship.
The press will no doubt battle
the signature hunters for his
attention, but he should manage
with the smile he brings with him
off the field. For unlike his native
state of Jersey, Jeffrey Ham
monds doesn't make anybody
search for the good parts. They
are all right in front of you.

Jeffrey Hammonds may someday be the next Rickey Henderson. Right now, he's too busy trying to lead
the Cardinal into the College World Series to worry about that. Stanford takes on San Diego State in a
first-round regional game at 3:30 p.m. in Fresno.
became an integral part of what
many consider the greatest Cardi
nal club of all time. He did this
right away, and he did it well.
"Jeff doesn't play cocky," said
designated hitter Ryan Turner,
Hammonds' roommate on the
road. "The most impressive thing
about Jeff is the way he handles
the game — he came in as a fresh
man like he'd already played four
years. He has a maturity that's
rare."
Composure is key here. Look
ing to the outfield, you will see
Hammonds smile to himself a lot.
He could take himself seriously,
but he prefers to grin because he
is enjoying his time on the field.
The guy from Scotch Plains has
the perspective to know what he is
playing out there.
"It is a game," said Hammonds.
"Some days are good, some days
are bad, but you can't let it get to
you. From the last at-bat it's still
a game."
A team game that is. A star
complex can be developed when
people forget individuals can't do
it all themselves. Hammonds
move in the lineup is a good case
in point.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
needed more power in the middle
of the order and did not want to
move perennial No. 3 hitter David
McCarty out of the spot to which
he had grown so accustomed. Not
a natural cleanup hitter, Ham
monds did not make it an issue.
He just played.

"I never felt I was a four batter,
but if it will help the team I'll do
it," said Hammonds. "Without a
doubt it's been a success. I did
what I had to do at the four spot."
At 6-foot, 185, Hammonds does
not have the kind of imposing
stature that will scare anybody
away, but he still manages to hit
for power. Part of his job as
cleanup was to produce runs, and
though his average dropped from
last year, he improved on 1990's
seven home runs almost two-fold.
These runs helped the team
win, but as it turned out, his posi
tion at No. 4 wound up having an
even greater indirect effect on the
team's success.
"Dave McCarty would not have
had the kind of year he has if Jeff
were not behind him," said Mar
quess. "He made people have to
pitch to McCarty."
McCarty will likely be named
National Player of the Year next
week, an honor in which Ham
monds has a share. Would
McCarty really have had such a
great year with Jeff still at lead
off?
"I hope to think that he
wouldn't," Hammonds will tell
you with a healthy laugh. "But
whether or not I did [have an
impact], I'll believe it."
Turner says that Hammonds
has a "subtle" confidence, and you
can tell by watching him play. He
will admit that he is not a physical
giant, yet his leg speed helps gen
erate an explosive bat that makes
him ready for any pitch and hit for
power.
Those same legs stole 48 bases
in 53 attempts last year, and 21 in
25 tries this year, good for an .885

career average. People say he can
do it all because he looks like he
can, but that does not mean he is
perfect.
"Sure he can improve," said
Marquess. "He can improve his
defense, he can improve his arm;
but those are not weaknesses, it's
only a matter of playing more "
Playing more is something
Hammonds has thought about a
lot. He took last summer off
because he thought it was the last
one he would be able to spend off
the field.
This year he is invited to the
U.S. national team tryouts, and
would like to go to the Pan-Amer
ican games over the summer and
then the Olympics next year. If all
works out well, the Major Leagues
will follow with its 162 games.
Being up for every game is a skill
Hammonds thinks he needs to
improve.
"I need to work on my mental
toughness," said Hammonds.
"Once you are mentally tough,
everything takes care of itself."
For now the task at hand is in
Fresno, and you can be sure Ham
monds will have no trouble being
tough for the games he will play
this weekend. Surrounding the
games will be the hoopla that
comes with any path to a national
championship.
The press will no doubt battle
the signature hunters for his
attention, but he should manage
with the smile he brings with him
off the field. For unlike his native
state of Jersey, Jeffrey Ham
monds doesn't make anybody
search for the good parts. They
are all right in front of you.
Jeffrey Hammonds should be a
jerk, plain and simple.
He should be a tolerable pres
ence only because he plays the
game of baseball well enough to
possess the attitude he could
have. You should see him blazing
down Palm Drive with a scooter
full of high octane airplane fuel,
on his way to visit the newest
mega-star of Gaieties. He should
hold bases over his head and tell
people he is the best of all time.
It might annoy people, but they
would probably accept it. After all,
it's not like he doesn't have the
resume to carry the obnoxious dis
position. Young stud comes out of
high school, with hundreds of
thousands of dollars thrust in his
face from the Toronto Blue Jays,
but goes to Stanford instead and
blows the doors off the place in the
process.
Not knowing that freshman do
not do this kind of stuff, Ham
monds hits in 37 straight games (a
Pacific 10 Conference record), fin
ishing the game with a .355 aver
age and 48 stolen bases. In the end
he was named national freshman
of the year and a first-team All-
American. No one else has made
