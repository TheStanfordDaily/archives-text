# Card's high hopes in Hammerin' Hammonds' helping hands
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Jeffrey Hammonds should be a
jerk, plain and simple.
He should be a tolerable pres
ence only because he plays the
game of baseball well enough to
possess the attitude he could
have. You should see him blazing
down Palm Drive with a scooter
full of high octane airplane fuel,
on his way to visit the newest
mega-star of Gaieties. He should
hold bases over his head and tell
people he is the best of all time.
It might annoy people, but they
would probably accept it. After all,
it's not like he doesn't have the
resume to carry the obnoxious dis
position. Young stud comes out of
high school, with hundreds of
thousands of dollars thrust in his
face from the Toronto Blue Jays,
but goes to Stanford instead and
blows the doors off the place in the
process.
Not knowing that freshman do
not do this kind of stuff, Ham
monds hits in 37 straight games (a
Pacific 10 Conference record), fin
ishing the game with a .355 aver
age and 48 stolen bases. In the end
he was named national freshman
of the year and a first-team All-
American. No one else has made

first-team as a freshman in Stan
ford history —nobody.
Best leadoff man in college
baseball? The newspapers start
calling him the next coming of
Rickey Henderson. Autograph
hounds begin sniffing out the cen
ter fielder as soon as the ump has
called the last out.
This year he gets moved to the
cleanup spot to give the team
some more power after leading off
last year. He struggles a bit, and
heading into today's NCAA
regional game with San Diego
State University, the sophomore is
"only" hitting .322 with 13 home
runs and 53 runs batted in.
Yup, Jeffrey Hammonds has
every reason to possess an annoy

ing ego the size of his home state
of New Jersey. But much like the
maligned Garden State, Ham
monds is not what he seems.
Believe it or not, Jersey can be a
pretty place, and the man some
call Hambone sure ain't no jerk.
"It is remarkable to me how
good a player he is, and how well
he handles it," said Stanford sec
ond baseman Chris Kemper. "He
is very light-hearted and good to
be around."
From the start people could tell
that Jeffrey Hammonds was not
your ordinary freshman. Declin
ing the big money of the majors,
Hammonds came to Stanford and

Jeffrey Hammonds may someday be the next Rickey Henderson. Right now, he's too busy trying to lead
the Cardinal into the College World Series to worry about that. Stanford takes on San Diego State in a
first-round regional game at 3:30 p.m. in Fresno.
