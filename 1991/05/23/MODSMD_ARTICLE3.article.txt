# Justice Department files suit against Ivies and MIT

The Justice Department filed a civil anti
trust suit against nine prestigious colleges
yesterday, but Stanford, which has also
been investigated by the government for
fixing tuition charges, is not one of the
defendants.
The eight Ivy League colleges and MIT
were charged for a practice called "over
lap," in which financial aid information of
students admitted to more than one insti
tution is shared. The complaint alleges that
the defendants have been fixing the
amount of money financial aid applicants
have to pay to attend one of these schools.
The Ivy League schools — Brown, Cor
nell, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton and
Yale universities, Dartmouth College and
the University of Pennsylvania — signed a
consent decree yesterday agreeing not to

collaborate in setting financial aid levels
and tuition or faculty salary increases, thus
settling the Justice Department suit.
MIT declined to sign the decree, and
therefore still faces the charge.
Stanford was one of 57 schools nation
wide investigated for tuition-fixing. The
investigation, which began in September
1989, was prompted by a finding that there
was little difference in tuition at the
nation's most prestigious universities.
The investigation created tremendous
paperwork for the University, and Univer
sity Vice President and General Counsel
John Schwartz said he is "pleased that
Stanford was not named in a suit."
While many schools maintain that the
practice of "overlap" saves themselves from
"bidding wars" for the same students,
Schwartz said the suit just filed is "proba-
blv a statement of what the Jus
tice Department believes in"
regarding anti-trust legislation.
Schwartz added that he has
been informed by the Justice
Department that Stanford will
not be named in a similar suit.
Schwartz said Stanford does
not share financial aid informa
tion — particularly the amount of
aid given to students who may be
commonly admitted — with other

schools and does not belong to a
group of schools who engage in

1 le added that Stanford admin
istrators do not feel they are "in a
disadvantage" for not sharing
such aid information.
Attorney General Dick Thorn

burgh, when announcing the suit
and the consent decree settle
ment, strongly condemned any
price competition on financial aid.
"Students and their families are
entitled to the full benefits of
price competition when they
choose a college," he said.
"The revered stature of these
institutions of higher learning in
our society does not insulate
them from the requirements of
the anti-trust laws . . . The choice
of whether to consider price when
picking a school belongs to par
ents and students, not the college
or university," he stated.
