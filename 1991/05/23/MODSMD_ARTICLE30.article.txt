# Cevaer looks to lead golf's postseason charge
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's golf team is young, invigo
rated, hungry. Its two freshmen, two sophomores,
and lone junior provide a dramatic contrast with last
year's experienced and savvy squad of four seniors
and a sophomore.
Last year's team finished 10th in the NCAA West
ern Regionals, two strokes away from advancing to
the NCAA Championships. This year's gregarious
five start the first round of play today in the four
day, 72-hole Western Regionals in Albuquerque,
N.M., not planning on a similar setback. The Cardi
nal needs to finish among the top nine of the 18 com
peting teams to advance to the NCAA Champi
onships at Pebble Beach.
"We've finished third, third, fourth, first, ninth,
eighth, fourth, fifth, third, fourth and second," said
coach Wally Goodwin. "We've only had two bad
rounds all year. For a young golf team, our record
this season is remarkable. We're playing other
teams'juniors and seniors and we're no pushover."
Consistency has been the key to the Cardinal's
success this season. Yet there's only one constant
among last year's team and this year's — junior
Christian Cevaer, who has been compared to the
deity of Cardinal men's golf, Tom Watson.
"Christian is the best player to ever play at Stan
ford," coach Wally Goodwin said without hesitation.
"Tom Watson was not as good of a college player as
Christian is. No one has ever had the type of wins

that Christian has had here."
Cevaer has racked up the lowest scoring averages
of any Cardinal golfer during his collegiate career
thus far: 73.1 as a freshman; 72.6 in last year's
sophomore campaign; and a 73.6 to date this season.
"He's a perfectionist," said Goodwin. "That's not
to say that it is a fault, but it is almost a fault
because perfection in golf has almost never been
attained. Ben Hogan would only hit three or four
perfect shots a round. Golf is a game of mistakes and
how to limit them."
Growing up in the South Pacific French territory
of New Caledonia, Cevaer picked up a golf club for
the first time at the age of 12. In less than two years
he was playing to a 10 handicap.
At 14, he left the shores of Tahiti and its sole golf
course for the altogether foreign territories of
Carmel, Calif., and the Robert Louis Stevenson 1 Ugh
School. "I knew that there were many more great
golfers in the United States than anywhere else,"
Cevaer said. "And I knew about NCAA golf and that
a great percentage of the pros on the PGA Tour
played golf in college."
In his sophomore year, under the tutelage of golf
great Ben Doyle, Cevaer's game took off. He won the
first of his record three Central Coast Section titles.
That same year, 1986, he claimed the laurels to the
French Juniors while playing on the French junior
national team.
"By playing in Europe, I learned how to handle
both the Scottish and American target courses," he
said.

Despite his impressive high school accomplish
ments, Cevaer was not the target of any college
recruiters except for Stanford. He thinks that other
schools overlooked him because he didn't play the
American Junior Golf Association tournaments dur
ing the summer — he was playing with the PYench
national team.
However, Cevaer made sure that everyone in the
United States knew who he was with his outrageous
freshman season on The Farm. He led the team in
scoring average and set the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship record with rounds of 70, 68 and 65.
"It wasn't much of a jump from junior to the col
lege level for me because during the summers I
played in the big tournaments with the French
team," he said. "I wasn't intimidated at all because I
had pretty substantial competition."
He returned to France after his phenomenal first
year at Stanford only to win the the French Amateur
title and represented France in the 1989 World
Championships.
Cevaer's season with the Cardinal team came to a
disappointing end last season with the loss in the
Western Regionals. Nevertheless, he continued as an
individual to the NCAA Championships and earned
All-American honors and an eighth-place finish.
Last fall, he competed in the World Champi
onships in addition to being one of eight male golfers
representing the NCAA in Japan.
"Although the Japanese beat us, it was fun for me
to be on an American team, especially as a French
citizen," he said.
But the traveling took its toll on Cevaer as he was
mired in a slump from October until mid-February.
"I wasn't playing very well," he said. "After lead
ing the team my freshman and sophomore years, 1
enjoyed seeing other teammates lead the team, but
at the same time, I was disappointed to finish second
or third on the team after always leading it.
"But it's always a positive experience to go
through a slump because everyone goes through one.
My focus wasn't absolute. I had my energies scat
tered around in school and other things."
In the last few months, Cevaer's game has
climbed back to the heights it once knew. He won the
Brigham Young Cougar Classic three weeks ago for
his first title this year, and he came up short by one
stroke in a playoff in the Nike Northwest last week
end.
"I'm pretty satisfied with the way that I've been
playing," he said. "I've always been in contention
other than in the Pac-lOs. I feel confident, but I'm
careful not to be overconfident because I feel the
same way that I did before Pac-lOs and for some rea
son I didn't play well there."
Cevaer knows that the only way for him to begin
his professional career in the United States is if he
wins the NCAA Championships. "I need a sponsor
ship if I want to begin here because it will be kind of
expensive," he said
However, he stresses that it's more important for
the team to make :t to NCAAs than for him person
ally. "It's important for me to make it as a team and
not only an individual effort. Basically if we all play
solid, shooting two over or less, we can do it,"he
said.

the team to make :t to NCAAs than for him person
ally. "It's important for me to make it as a team and
not only an individual effort. Basically if we all play
solid, shooting two over or less, we can do it,"he
said.

Christian Cevaer has known much individual glory in his college career. At the NCAA regionals, which
begin today, he'd like to translate some of that personal success into a great team showing for the Car
dinal.
The Cardinal men's golf team is young, invigo
rated, hungry. Its two freshmen, two sophomores,
and lone junior provide a dramatic contrast with last
year's experienced and savvy squad of four seniors
and a sophomore.
Last year's team finished 10th in the NCAA West
ern Regionals, two strokes away from advancing to
the NCAA Championships. This year's gregarious
five start the first round of play today in the four
day, 72-hole Western Regionals in Albuquerque,
N.M., not planning on a similar setback. The Cardi
nal needs to finish among the top nine of the 18 com
peting teams to advance to the NCAA Champi
onships at Pebble Beach.
"We've finished third, third, fourth, first, ninth,
eighth, fourth, fifth, third, fourth and second," said
coach Wally Goodwin. "We've only had two bad
rounds all year. For a young golf team, our record
this season is remarkable. We're playing other
teams'juniors and seniors and we're no pushover."
Consistency has been the key to the Cardinal's
success this season. Yet there's only one constant
among last year's team and this year's — junior
Christian Cevaer, who has been compared to the
deity of Cardinal men's golf, Tom Watson.
"Christian is the best player to ever play at Stan
ford," coach Wally Goodwin said without hesitation.
"Tom Watson was not as good of a college player as
Christian is. No one has ever had the type of wins

that Christian has had here."
Cevaer has racked up the lowest scoring averages
of any Cardinal golfer during his collegiate career
thus far: 73.1 as a freshman; 72.6 in last year's
sophomore campaign; and a 73.6 to date this season.
"He's a perfectionist," said Goodwin. "That's not
to say that it is a fault, but it is almost a fault
because perfection in golf has almost never been
attained. Ben Hogan would only hit three or four
perfect shots a round. Golf is a game of mistakes and
how to limit them."
Growing up in the South Pacific French territory
of New Caledonia, Cevaer picked up a golf club for
the first time at the age of 12. In less than two years
he was playing to a 10 handicap.
At 14, he left the shores of Tahiti and its sole golf
course for the altogether foreign territories of
Carmel, Calif., and the Robert Louis Stevenson 1 Ugh
School. "I knew that there were many more great
golfers in the United States than anywhere else,"
Cevaer said. "And I knew about NCAA golf and that
a great percentage of the pros on the PGA Tour
played golf in college."
In his sophomore year, under the tutelage of golf
great Ben Doyle, Cevaer's game took off. He won the
first of his record three Central Coast Section titles.
That same year, 1986, he claimed the laurels to the
French Juniors while playing on the French junior
national team.
"By playing in Europe, I learned how to handle
both the Scottish and American target courses," he
said.

Despite his impressive high school accomplish
ments, Cevaer was not the target of any college
recruiters except for Stanford. He thinks that other
schools overlooked him because he didn't play the
American Junior Golf Association tournaments dur
ing the summer — he was playing with the PYench
national team.
However, Cevaer made sure that everyone in the
United States knew who he was with his outrageous
freshman season on The Farm. He led the team in
scoring average and set the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship record with rounds of 70, 68 and 65.
"It wasn't much of a jump from junior to the col
lege level for me because during the summers I
played in the big tournaments with the French
team," he said. "I wasn't intimidated at all because I
had pretty substantial competition."
He returned to France after his phenomenal first
year at Stanford only to win the the French Amateur
title and represented France in the 1989 World
Championships.
Cevaer's season with the Cardinal team came to a
disappointing end last season with the loss in the
Western Regionals. Nevertheless, he continued as an
individual to the NCAA Championships and earned
All-American honors and an eighth-place finish.
Last fall, he competed in the World Champi
onships in addition to being one of eight male golfers
representing the NCAA in Japan.
"Although the Japanese beat us, it was fun for me
to be on an American team, especially as a French
citizen," he said.
But the traveling took its toll on Cevaer as he was
mired in a slump from October until mid-February.
"I wasn't playing very well," he said. "After lead
ing the team my freshman and sophomore years, 1
enjoyed seeing other teammates lead the team, but
at the same time, I was disappointed to finish second
or third on the team after always leading it.
"But it's always a positive experience to go
through a slump because everyone goes through one.
My focus wasn't absolute. I had my energies scat
tered around in school and other things."
In the last few months, Cevaer's game has
climbed back to the heights it once knew. He won the
Brigham Young Cougar Classic three weeks ago for
his first title this year, and he came up short by one
stroke in a playoff in the Nike Northwest last week
end.
"I'm pretty satisfied with the way that I've been
playing," he said. "I've always been in contention
other than in the Pac-lOs. I feel confident, but I'm
careful not to be overconfident because I feel the
same way that I did before Pac-lOs and for some rea
son I didn't play well there."
Cevaer knows that the only way for him to begin
his professional career in the United States is if he
wins the NCAA Championships. "I need a sponsor
ship if I want to begin here because it will be kind of
expensive," he said
However, he stresses that it's more important for
the team to make :t to NCAAs than for him person
ally. "It's important for me to make it as a team and
not only an individual effort. Basically if we all play
solid, shooting two over or less, we can do it,"he
said.
