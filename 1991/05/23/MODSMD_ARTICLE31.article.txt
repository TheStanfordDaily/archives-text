## Brockenbrough elected editor of 200th volume 
### 
Touch her monkey. Touch it.
After running on a platform of
"bring-your-own-bone" happy
hours and revealing staff videos,
Martha Brockenbrough was
elected editor in chief of Volume
200 of The Daily last night.
Upon the announcement of her
victory, Brockenbrough engaged
in a graphic verbal exchange with
longtime squeeze and design god
Doug Davis.
"Twist it,"he exhorted.
"I can't," she cried out.
"Just twist it."
Soon, the champagne was flow
ing. "But don't take my picture,"
she said. "I'm not 21.
"I'll end up having lunch with
Stuart Reges."
A junior majoring in English
and classics, Brockenbrough hails
from Bellevue, Wash., where her
dog Riley is facing lip surgery this
weekend.
The dog, along with the rest of
her family, are the most important
people in her life, according to
Brockenbrough, who says her own

lips peel back when she thinks of
eating raw tomatoes.
Brockenbrough, who added
that she feels uncomfortable
when her feet are dirty, is dis
turbed by people who file their

nails on their jeans.

shocked that she won the three
way election without a runoff -
but not as shocked as when Res
Ed officials called her to find out
where they should house Boris,
Nat and Robin.
Brockenbrough plays the vio
lin, viola and Pin-Bot. Her ten
dency to hang out in the Tresidder
game room reached unreasonable
extremes last night when the
announcement of her victory was
delayed because she was playing
air hockey.
When not in the game room,
Brockenbrough is diverted by
other activities.
"She barks a lot. She actually
makes lots of animal sounds," said
Davis, the boyfriend.
"She gives people the finger 30
or 40 times a day. Just to me."
Supporters were worried that
Brockenbrough's campaign
efforts would be hampered by her
tendency to stick a finger in peo
ple's mouths when they yawn.
She refers to this action, accord
ing to Davis, as the "kitten finger
stick."
At The Daily, Brockenbrough
has been an Intermission editor,
Off The Farm editor, news copyed
itor and, for the past year, director
of staff development. In that posi
tion, she has entertained the staff
with antics ranging from staff
impersonations to dumping salsa
on her head.
On Saturday nights, Brocken
brough can be found spending
time with her best friends: Pat,
Wayne, Garth, Hans, Franz and
Dieter.
L ooking to the beginning of the
volume this fall, Brockenbrough
said she is eagerly anticipating
both the challenges of her new job
and its perks.
"I just can't wait to try out the
editor's couch," she giggled.
