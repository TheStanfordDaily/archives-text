Martha Brockenbrough was
elected editor in chief of Volume
200 of The Daily last night.
Upon the announcement of her
victory, Brockenbrough engaged
in a graphic verbal exchange with
longtime squeeze and design god
Doug Davis.

A junior majoring in English

from Bellevue, Wash., where her
dog Riley is facing lip surgery this
weekend.
The dog, along with the rest of
her family, are the most important

Brockenbrough, who says her own
