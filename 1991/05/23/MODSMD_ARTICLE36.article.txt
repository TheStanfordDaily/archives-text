## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S CLASSICAL WEEKLY MOSTLY MOZART San Francisco festival hurls Amadeus into avant-garde 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Do your eyelids droop at the mention of
Mozart's "Requiem"? Do you reach for
your "Magic Flute" compact disc when the
Nyquil bottle runs dry?
Well forget everything you ever thought
about Mozart, because while the 1989 film "Amadeus"
introduced this composer into contemporary culture,
this month's festival brings his work straight into the
avant-garde.
And you won't want to sleep through it.
All of San Francisco will be singing and dancing the
praises of Amadeus during "Mozart and His Time," a
mammoth 40-day festival of events that began yester
day in and around the City.
The festival, which celebrates Mozart's 200 th birth
day, features over 50 events and 150 performances, in
which Mozart's work is adapted for nearly every artistic
medium, including the glass harmonica, a horse ballet,
trapeze acts and contemporary "warehouse theater."
Underwear and high-flying flutists may not be the
images that immediately come to mind with the men
tion of Mozart. Yet "Warehouse Mozart," a bizarre col
lection of experimental theater pieces, manages to
incorporate them within the context of Amadeus' work.
This program, which features such experimental
performance groups as The High Risk Group and Cir
cus Absurdus, uses Mozart's music as the "raw mate
rial" for a number of unusual events.
"Warehouse Mozart" will include a fashion show
titled "Austrian Undergarments of the Late 18th Cen
tury" and a rendition of two arias from Mozart's

"Magic Flute" per
formed while sus
pended in air on a
trapeze.
"Warehouse
Mozart" will be
held June 7 and 8
at 8:30 at 1800
Square Feet, locat
ed at 719 Clemen
tina St.in San
Francisco. Call

773-8706 for more information.
Both two and four-legged Mozart fans can horse
around in style at The San Francisco Festival of the
Horse and Polo in the Park. Equestrian show jumping,
polocrosse, polo, horse ballet, vaulting, carriage driving
and more will be performed to Mozart's music.
Hunting horns and other "horsy" musical instru
ments will be demonstrated, as well as operatic solos
and choral music. This event, presented by the San
Francisco Grand Prix Association, will be held June 15
and 16 at 9 a.m. at the Golden Gate Park Polo Field.
Call 563-5650 for details.
Although he didn't go to Stanford, many people
consider Mozart to have been a genius. What was it like
to be composing at age 5?
As part of the festival, experts in psychology, music
and medicine will present "The Pleasures and Perils of
Genius: Mostly Mozart." Using Mozart's life story, this
symposium will discuss how to recognize and nurture
child prodigies, as well as the possible health risks of
being a superstar. UCSF will host this three-day sympo
sium June 7-9. Call 476-4251 or 476-5808 for details.
Whether you're a kid at heart or a sophisticated
adult who enjoys fine wine and fine music, you
shouldn't miss "Mozart Under Glass," an unusual event
at an unexpected location — the Exploratorium.
A celebration of the glass harmonica, this event fea-
