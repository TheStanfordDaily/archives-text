Poor Larry. Clearly, he's confused. But before you make too much fun
of him, remember this: At least he's got a date.
Which is more than we can say. Our weekends are spent doing
such exciting things as writing this editors' box.
Not that that isn't fulfilling — it is.
But every once in a while, we'd like to do something different, some
thing creative.
Something not involving a computer.
Ah yes, the joy of a Stanford social life.
If you can call it that.
Well, for those of you who are romancing the nights away (all four of
you), keep in mind that summer may be just around the corner, but you
have to get past finals first. So keep your nose to the grindstone and one
foot on the floor. Only three weeks to go. (Divide 3,000 pages by 21 days,
and you get...)
Well, OK, you probably do have time to have a little bit of fun. And you
won't even have to go very far to do it. Plays, concerts and dorm musicals
still abound on campus for the next few weeks.
On Friday and Saturday, "Unspeakable Acts," an original comic musi
cal revue featuring the tunes of the roaring '20s, will be presented by Okada
House in their dorm lounge. The script is original, but the tunes should
strike a familiar note.
Stanford's first a capella group, The Mendicants, want to entertain you
at their annual spring show next Tuesday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8
p.m.
And avant-garde theater, a rarity on the Stanford campus, will be yours
for the pondering tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m. in a play with a title
longer than the show itself, "History of the Avant-Garde, Part I: THE
ATRE IS EVIL, VIDEO IS DEATH, A Fearful Visitation of Perverted
Spiritual Presences from the Other World, or KILL THE DOG, The Cyn
ical Use of Setting and Props to Generate Unthinking Consent." Whew.
There's probably more stuff going on, but we're too tired to write about
it now.
Adieu for now, and let us know if you know of any available Larrys.
