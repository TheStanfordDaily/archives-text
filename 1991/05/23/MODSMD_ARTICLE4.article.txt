# University to join students in battling sexual assault
## 
### Mara Mather Staff writer 
Students and members of the adminis
tration have announced they will meet this
week to coordinate efforts to battle sexual
assault on campus.
"We're interested in forming a partner
ship with the ASSU," said Michael Jackson,
associate dean of Student Affairs.
Students pushing to combat sexual
assault laid the groundwork for increased
prevention and education programs by
prompting an ASSU Senate vote last week
providing $45,000 next year for the admin
istration of these programs.
The student members of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault will meet tomorrow
morning with members of the administra
tion, including representatives from the
Campus Sexual Assault Response and
Recovery Team and the Prevention Educa
tion Coordinating Council.
The response and recovery team is coor
dinated by Gail Nelligan, a psychiatrist at
Counseling and Psychological Services. The
coordinating council is chaired by Pat Fabi

ano, director of health promotion at Cowell
Student Health Center, and Chris Griffith,
assistant director of Graduate Residential
Affairs.
Members of the coalition hope to form a
search committee with representatives
from the three organizations to decide who
will serve as a temporary coordinator of the
ASSU-funded programs.
Jackson said, "I really applaud the
efforts of students, but we need to get
together."
When asked whether the University will
fund the coordinator position in the future,
Jackson said, "We're facing a severe budget
crunch. [I'm] not going to guarantee that
this will be funded."
Nelligan said, "At every meeting I've been
in there's been nothing but support. . . but
no money."
Harvey Weinstein, director of Cowell,
said it is necessary to create a long-term
plan to take care of the needs of students,
not just a temporary position while there is
funding available. He said, "We need to
come up with a structure [to]
combine the ASSU proposal and
what we have been doing to make
a solid foundation for the future."
According to Weinstein, the
main goals now are making sure
there is a place for sexually
assaulted students to go to for
help and heightening awareness
of sexual assault issues.
Nelligan said, "When students
take charge of this need, there's

something very healthy about
that." She added that she will
propose at tomorrow's meeting
that students and administrators
"have a half-day retreat to put
together our vision."
Senior Michelle Finkel, a mem
ber of the coalition, said the coali
tion does not plan to petition the
ASSU for funding in future years.
Finkel said, "We're really hoping
the University will find the fund
ing, or some alums will be willing
to help."
According to John Louie, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents-elect, University President

Donald Kennedy said in a meeting
yesterday with ASSU members
that if students want funding for
the coordinator position, the)
must decide upon a budget cut in
some other area to compensate.
Efforts are being made tr
make reporting incidents of sex
ual assault less traumatic. Ing
letter to The Daily publishec
today, Norman Robinson, acting
dean of Student Affairs, saic
changes have been proposed ir
the student judicial process in the
"areas of victim rights and the
cooperation of witnesses and stu
dents accused of misconduct."
