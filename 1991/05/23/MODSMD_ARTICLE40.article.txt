# Intermission Catches Up With
## THE 						LAW 
### Dan Levitin 
What do you get when you combine
the former lead singer of Free and
the former drummer of The Who?
You get The Law.
The Law is a new group formed by Paul
Rodgers — who was also the lead singer of Bad
Company and The Firm — and Kenney Jones
— who was also the drummer for Small Faces.
An impressive duo, to be sure, one you would
expect impressive music from.
Clearly people did have high expectations
for The Law; their debut album was added to
radio station playlists even before it had been
released.
And people weren't disappointed.
Rodgers does his best singing in 15 years,
spurred by Jones' solid and economical drum
ming and guest appearances by Bryan Adams,
David Gilmour and Chris Rea. Huge guitar
lines tie the songs together, and sound familiar
to the former bands of both members.
That's no surprise, though; the song "Laying
Down The Law" begins with an updated ver
sion of the guitar riff from "Bad Company,"
one of Rodgers' hits with the group Bad Com
pany. And "Nature of The Beast" (written by
Adams and Jim Vallance) features Rodgers' best
singing on the album as he jumps to his high
register, reminiscent of Frees 1969 "All Right
Now." (Which was also Rodgers' first hit sin
gle.)
Rodgers and Jones knew each other for
years before joining forces. At one point, Free
toured with Small Faces and the two musicians
would "jam together at the end of gigs." And in
1983 they both played on the ARMS tour,
which raised money for multiple sclerosis
research, a disease which had stricken former
Small Faces member Ronnie Lane.
Intermission caught up with The Law and
talked to them about their past musical experi
ences, their new album and their plans for the
future.
Intermission: How did The Law come
together?
Paul Rodgers: I had written some songs and I
asked Kenney to come over to my house and
help me record them. I played a bit of bass, a
bit of guitar, just for the sake of filling out the
sounds, and we did some nice things, actually.
Later we thought we really ought to get in a
proper guitarist and a proper bass player if
we're going to do this right. And that's how The
Law was born, just from the two of us messing
about in the studio and then bringing people
in.
I: Kenney, it must have been hard to follow
Keith Moon as drummer for The Who. Your
styles are so different, yours being so much
more understated and subtle. And your sense
of time is so different.
Kenney Jones: I can't think for the life of me
why The Who asked me to join them. All I can
think is that we came up through the same era.
It was the mod era and at one stage, the press
were saying that Small Faces and The Who
were rival bands. When we actually met up we
got along quite well and we became good
friends and toured together. I did a lot of work
with The Who when I was with Small Faces,
when Moonie was completely out of it. I played
on the film music for "Tommy." And I had
some fun with that because there, back in the
'70s, I could see what it was like to actually go
nuts. Got it out of my system then, really.
I: Did you play parts that Moon had written?
KJ: No, I just played myself. When I was in The
Who I played exactly me, but there are obvious
sections in songs where a certain drum pattern
has to be played. I prefer The Law because I can
actually play me without thinking about it. I

just play whatever comes into my head — it's
just natural.
I: Meaning that in The Who you felt self-con
scious about the parts you were coming up
with?
KJ: Oh yeah, absolutely. Because you see, I
wasn't a founding member, I was always a bit of
a substitute for somebody else.
I: That's interesting. So there was this vibe that
you always felt you had to be on your guard?
KJ: Most definitely. It wasn't comfortable. I did
my bit and I was kind of like a sort of helping
hand, really. Because The Who never could
really be The Who without Keith Moon. I don't
know why they didn't stop — that's what they
should have done, really.
I: Like Led Zeppelin.
KJ: Yeah. I mean, when they went out recently,
it wasn't really The Who anyway, it was a 15-
piece band.
I: That's weird.
KJ: Yeah. Anyone can sound great with a 15-
piece band behind 'em. The Who kind of left a
bad taste in my mouth, but I'm not at all bitter
about anything. It was a good experience for
me, like Paul working with The Firm.
I: What did you do between The Who and The
Law?
KJ: Between The Who and The Law, yes ...
hmmm ... what did I do? The last time I went
on the road live was with the ARMS tour in
1986. I spent a long time in my other house
building the studio and I spent a long time

working on my own and playing with other
guys just for fun.
I: What other things did you do? Did you
remodel the house for the studio?
KJ: No, I had the studio put into a big, separate
14th century barn that I've constructed.
I can't think for the life of
me why The Who asked me
to join them. All I can think
is that we came up through
the same era. It was the mod

era and at one stage, the
press were saying that Small
Faces and The Who were
rival hands.
— Kenney Jones
I: I have this vision of you hammering and nail
ing for three years.
KJ: Oh no, I didn't do that. I'm not that tal
ented. All I was doing was riding horses while
they were building my studio — I was having a
good time.
I: Do you own a bunch of horses?
PR: He's got 15 of them.
KJ: Yes, I've got 15. I play polo and you
need ... I always feel like I sound pretentious,
or that it comes off as pretentious, when I say
I've got 15 horses. But it's not because I want to

own 15 horses, it's because I need a lot of horses
to play polo.
I: Kenney, it doesn't seem pretentious to me. It
sounds like great fun. I always like to think that
people with money are enjoying it...
KJ: Yes. As long as you have it and aren't wast
ing it, I agree. And polo is very very fun — it's
a great turn on for me, because I truly love
horses. Being in the music business without a
horse — God knows what would've happened
to me, because the horse is like my psychiatrist.
I: Paul, let me ask you something about The
Firm. Was it aggravating in any sense playing
with Jimmy Page?
PR: It was tough. He's a brilliant guitar
player, and both of us have our roots in the
blues, but he's gone in a slightly different direc
tion now which is much much more technical
and speed-oriented than I would like to work
with, to be perfectly frank.
Although I love the guy, I find that I have a
much more simplistic approach to music, and I
look for more of a ... I don't know what it is. If
I say it's a feel thing, that doesn't really explain
it, because he also has a very strong feel. Per
haps the two of us feel it different ways.
It was a great experience working with him;
we wrote a lot of songs together and that was a
great challenge. We didn't actually sit in a stu
dio and compose a song. It tended to be more
like, he would give me a cassette and say "Hey,
what do you think of this, man, would you have
a listen to it and see if you can come up with
some lyrics?"
And that's the way we wrote songs together
— a sort of "arm's length" approach, in a way.
But it worked. "Midnight Moonlight Lady" was
an enormous challenge for me, and I really

enjoyed doing that. It was enormously satisfy
ing because it's such an epic song to write lyrics
to, and it has a 9/4 chorus — I didn't even know
what that was.
I: Jimmy's the master of that stuff — that's his
thing.
PR: Yes, he did take me into areas where I never
would have gone, but they weren't areas I
wanted really to pursue. I'm pretty much a 4/4
guy, really.
I: The two of you, collectively, have played with
some of the great guitar players ... the thing I
like about your new album is that the guitars
seem to take in bits and pieces of all the gui
tarists you've both worked with. Not in a repet
itive way - none of it sounds old - it just takes
in some of the best of the six or seven guitarists
you've worked with.
PR: That's exactly what we were trying to
achieve; we tried to make an album that would
satisfy all of the people who have followed us
throughout the years and an album that was
true to our real nature.
KJ: And break new ground as well.
PR: It's a fine line to walk, really, 'cause we
wanted it to reflect the past but also to sound
contemporary. Mike Hehir plays some great
stuff on there. He's not a particularly well
known guitarist, but when he gets that guitar
on, boy there's fireworks! Jim Barber and John
Staehely play great guitar on there too. And
Dave Gilmour's guitar on "Stone" is just outra
geous, I think. That's what we like about the
way The Law is working, is that we can do that,
introduce new people and also feature estab
lished people too if they choose to come along.
I: There's been some odd lyrical censorship
going on in this country for the last couple of
years...
PR: I'll tell you what I feel about censorship. If
people abuse their right to freedom of speech
then they deserve to be censored. I think we
have to be responsible to a certain extent. In
lyrics, I don't like to hear — and I don't like to
sing — blatant swearing and stuff like that, I
just find it offensive. I think the 2 Live Crew
stuff is nonsense. It's just street garbage and I
don't like it.
Any sort of sexuality in a lyric I prefer to be
suggested rather than openly stated. I find that
in women, too. I like subtlety. To be attractive,
their sexuality doesn't have to be blatant, I feel.
KJ: Yes, and it's the same in music.
I: When does the tour start?
PR: I th'nk we'll start in the United States in
September and then tour worldwide.
I: Are you going to firm up the membership of
The Law at some point?
KJ: Well it's hard. You can't just go out anymore
and get a permanent band just like that; it just
doesn't happen.
I: Why is that?
KJ: Ifyou go back years to when the Small Faces
started and Free, you realize that those groups
happened naturally; you can't go out and man
ufacture that.
I: You mean that when you've grown up
together and the band forms from just hanging
out together, it's not the same as putting some
thing together.
KJ: Yes, exactly.
PR: It becomes harder later in life to get that
thing where you just are hanging around
together naturally.
KJ: That's right. Now what we're doing is that
The Law is kind of open. We have an open
mind; if somebody comes along and they fit in
with us and we feel good about it, we'll depu
tize them.

it, because he also has a very strong feel. Per
haps the two of us feel it different ways.
It was a great experience working with him;
we wrote a lot of songs together and that was a
great challenge. We didn't actually sit in a stu
dio and compose a song. It tended to be more
like, he would give me a cassette and say "Hey,
what do you think of this, man, would you have
a listen to it and see if you can come up with
some lyrics?"
And that's the way we wrote songs together
— a sort of "arm's length" approach, in a way.
But it worked. "Midnight Moonlight Lady" was
an enormous challenge for me, and I really

enjoyed doing that. It was enormously satisfy
ing because it's such an epic song to write lyrics
to, and it has a 9/4 chorus — I didn't even know
what that was.
I: Jimmy's the master of that stuff — that's his
thing.
PR: Yes, he did take me into areas where I never
would have gone, but they weren't areas I
wanted really to pursue. I'm pretty much a 4/4
guy, really.
I: The two of you, collectively, have played with
some of the great guitar players ... the thing I
like about your new album is that the guitars
seem to take in bits and pieces of all the gui
tarists you've both worked with. Not in a repet
itive way - none of it sounds old - it just takes
in some of the best of the six or seven guitarists
you've worked with.
PR: That's exactly what we were trying to
achieve; we tried to make an album that would
satisfy all of the people who have followed us
throughout the years and an album that was
true to our real nature.
KJ: And break new ground as well.
PR: It's a fine line to walk, really, 'cause we
wanted it to reflect the past but also to sound
contemporary. Mike Hehir plays some great
stuff on there. He's not a particularly well
known guitarist, but when he gets that guitar
on, boy there's fireworks! Jim Barber and John
Staehely play great guitar on there too. And
Dave Gilmour's guitar on "Stone" is just outra
geous, I think. That's what we like about the
way The Law is working, is that we can do that,
introduce new people and also feature estab
lished people too if they choose to come along.
I: There's been some odd lyrical censorship
going on in this country for the last couple of
years...
PR: I'll tell you what I feel about censorship. If
people abuse their right to freedom of speech
then they deserve to be censored. I think we
have to be responsible to a certain extent. In
lyrics, I don't like to hear — and I don't like to
sing — blatant swearing and stuff like that, I
just find it offensive. I think the 2 Live Crew
stuff is nonsense. It's just street garbage and I
don't like it.
Any sort of sexuality in a lyric I prefer to be
suggested rather than openly stated. I find that
in women, too. I like subtlety. To be attractive,
their sexuality doesn't have to be blatant, I feel.
KJ: Yes, and it's the same in music.
I: When does the tour start?
PR: I th'nk we'll start in the United States in
September and then tour worldwide.
I: Are you going to firm up the membership of
The Law at some point?
KJ: Well it's hard. You can't just go out anymore
and get a permanent band just like that; it just
doesn't happen.
I: Why is that?
KJ: Ifyou go back years to when the Small Faces
started and Free, you realize that those groups
happened naturally; you can't go out and man
ufacture that.
I: You mean that when you've grown up
together and the band forms from just hanging
out together, it's not the same as putting some
thing together.
KJ: Yes, exactly.
PR: It becomes harder later in life to get that
thing where you just are hanging around
together naturally.
KJ: That's right. Now what we're doing is that
The Law is kind of open. We have an open
mind; if somebody comes along and they fit in

Kenney Jones
and Paul
Rodgers are
The Law.
Rodgers —
formerly the
lead singer of
Bad Company
and The Firm
— and Jones,
who was the
drummer for
Small Faces,
have recently
joined forces.
What do you get when you combine
the former lead singer of Free and
the former drummer of The Who?
You get The Law.
The Law is a new group formed by Paul
Rodgers — who was also the lead singer of Bad
Company and The Firm — and Kenney Jones
— who was also the drummer for Small Faces.
An impressive duo, to be sure, one you would
expect impressive music from.
Clearly people did have high expectations
for The Law; their debut album was added to
radio station playlists even before it had been
released.
And people weren't disappointed.
Rodgers does his best singing in 15 years,
spurred by Jones' solid and economical drum
ming and guest appearances by Bryan Adams,
David Gilmour and Chris Rea. Huge guitar
lines tie the songs together, and sound familiar
to the former bands of both members.
That's no surprise, though; the song "Laying
Down The Law" begins with an updated ver
sion of the guitar riff from "Bad Company,"
one of Rodgers' hits with the group Bad Com
pany. And "Nature of The Beast" (written by
Adams and Jim Vallance) features Rodgers' best
singing on the album as he jumps to his high
register, reminiscent of Frees 1969 "All Right
Now." (Which was also Rodgers' first hit sin
gle.)
Rodgers and Jones knew each other for
years before joining forces. At one point, Free
toured with Small Faces and the two musicians
would "jam together at the end of gigs." And in
1983 they both played on the ARMS tour,
which raised money for multiple sclerosis
research, a disease which had stricken former
Small Faces member Ronnie Lane.
Intermission caught up with The Law and
talked to them about their past musical experi
ences, their new album and their plans for the
future.
Intermission: How did The Law come
together?
Paul Rodgers: I had written some songs and I
asked Kenney to come over to my house and
help me record them. I played a bit of bass, a
bit of guitar, just for the sake of filling out the
sounds, and we did some nice things, actually.
Later we thought we really ought to get in a
proper guitarist and a proper bass player if
we're going to do this right. And that's how The
Law was born, just from the two of us messing
about in the studio and then bringing people
in.
I: Kenney, it must have been hard to follow
Keith Moon as drummer for The Who. Your
styles are so different, yours being so much
more understated and subtle. And your sense
of time is so different.
Kenney Jones: I can't think for the life of me
why The Who asked me to join them. All I can
think is that we came up through the same era.
It was the mod era and at one stage, the press
were saying that Small Faces and The Who
were rival bands. When we actually met up we
got along quite well and we became good
friends and toured together. I did a lot of work
with The Who when I was with Small Faces,
when Moonie was completely out of it. I played
on the film music for "Tommy." And I had
some fun with that because there, back in the
'70s, I could see what it was like to actually go
nuts. Got it out of my system then, really.
I: Did you play parts that Moon had written?
KJ: No, I just played myself. When I was in The
Who I played exactly me, but there are obvious
sections in songs where a certain drum pattern
has to be played. I prefer The Law because I can
actually play me without thinking about it. I

just play whatever comes into my head — it's
just natural.
I: Meaning that in The Who you felt self-con
scious about the parts you were coming up
with?
KJ: Oh yeah, absolutely. Because you see, I
wasn't a founding member, I was always a bit of
a substitute for somebody else.
I: That's interesting. So there was this vibe that
you always felt you had to be on your guard?
KJ: Most definitely. It wasn't comfortable. I did
my bit and I was kind of like a sort of helping
hand, really. Because The Who never could
really be The Who without Keith Moon. I don't
know why they didn't stop — that's what they
should have done, really.
I: Like Led Zeppelin.
KJ: Yeah. I mean, when they went out recently,
it wasn't really The Who anyway, it was a 15-
piece band.
I: That's weird.
KJ: Yeah. Anyone can sound great with a 15-
piece band behind 'em. The Who kind of left a
bad taste in my mouth, but I'm not at all bitter
about anything. It was a good experience for
me, like Paul working with The Firm.
I: What did you do between The Who and The
Law?
KJ: Between The Who and The Law, yes ...
hmmm ... what did I do? The last time I went
on the road live was with the ARMS tour in
1986. I spent a long time in my other house
building the studio and I spent a long time

working on my own and playing with other
guys just for fun.
I: What other things did you do? Did you
remodel the house for the studio?
KJ: No, I had the studio put into a big, separate
14th century barn that I've constructed.
I can't think for the life of
me why The Who asked me
to join them. All I can think
is that we came up through
the same era. It was the mod

era and at one stage, the
press were saying that Small
Faces and The Who were
rival hands.
— Kenney Jones
I: I have this vision of you hammering and nail
ing for three years.
KJ: Oh no, I didn't do that. I'm not that tal
ented. All I was doing was riding horses while
they were building my studio — I was having a
good time.
I: Do you own a bunch of horses?
PR: He's got 15 of them.
KJ: Yes, I've got 15. I play polo and you
need ... I always feel like I sound pretentious,
or that it comes off as pretentious, when I say
I've got 15 horses. But it's not because I want to

own 15 horses, it's because I need a lot of horses
to play polo.
I: Kenney, it doesn't seem pretentious to me. It
sounds like great fun. I always like to think that
people with money are enjoying it...
KJ: Yes. As long as you have it and aren't wast
ing it, I agree. And polo is very very fun — it's
a great turn on for me, because I truly love
horses. Being in the music business without a
horse — God knows what would've happened
to me, because the horse is like my psychiatrist.
I: Paul, let me ask you something about The
Firm. Was it aggravating in any sense playing
with Jimmy Page?
PR: It was tough. He's a brilliant guitar
player, and both of us have our roots in the
blues, but he's gone in a slightly different direc
tion now which is much much more technical
and speed-oriented than I would like to work
with, to be perfectly frank.
Although I love the guy, I find that I have a
much more simplistic approach to music, and I
look for more of a ... I don't know what it is. If
I say it's a feel thing, that doesn't really explain
it, because he also has a very strong feel. Per

were saying that Small Faces and The Who
were rival bands. When we actually met up we
got along quite well and we became good
friends and toured together. I did a lot of work
with The Who when I was with Small Faces,
when Moonie was completely out of it. I played
on the film music for "Tommy." And I had
some fun with that because there, back in the
'70s, I could see what it was like to actually go
nuts. Got it out of my system then, really.
I: Did you play parts that Moon had written?
KJ: No, I just played myself. When I was in The
Who I played exactly me, but there are obvious
sections in songs where a certain drum pattern
has to be played. I prefer The Law because I can
actually play me without thinking about it. I

just play whatever comes into my head — it's
just natural.
I: Meaning that in The Who you felt self-con
scious about the parts you were coming up
with?
KJ: Oh yeah, absolutely. Because you see, I
wasn't a founding member, I was always a bit of
a substitute for somebody else.
I: That's interesting. So there was this vibe that
you always felt you had to be on your guard?
KJ: Most definitely. It wasn't comfortable. I did
my bit and I was kind of like a sort of helping
hand, really. Because The Who never could
really be The Who without Keith Moon. I don't
know why they didn't stop — that's what they
should have done, really.
I: Like Led Zeppelin.
KJ: Yeah. I mean, when they went out recently,
it wasn't really The Who anyway, it was a 15-
piece band.
I: That's weird.
KJ: Yeah. Anyone can sound great with a 15-
piece band behind 'em. The Who kind of left a
bad taste in my mouth, but I'm not at all bitter
about anything. It was a good experience for
me, like Paul working with The Firm.
I: What did you do between The Who and The
Law?
KJ: Between The Who and The Law, yes ...
hmmm ... what did I do? The last time I went
on the road live was with the ARMS tour in
1986. I spent a long time in my other house
building the studio and I spent a long time

working on my own and playing with other
guys just for fun.
I: What other things did you do? Did you
remodel the house for the studio?
KJ: No, I had the studio put into a big, separate
14th century barn that I've constructed.
I can't think for the life of
me why The Who asked me
to join them. All I can think
is that we came up through
the same era. It was the mod

era and at one stage, the
press were saying that Small
Faces and The Who were
rival hands.
— Kenney Jones
I: I have this vision of you hammering and nail
ing for three years.
KJ: Oh no, I didn't do that. I'm not that tal
ented. All I was doing was riding horses while
they were building my studio — I was having a
good time.
I: Do you own a bunch of horses?
PR: He's got 15 of them.
KJ: Yes, I've got 15. I play polo and you
need ... I always feel like I sound pretentious,
or that it comes off as pretentious, when I say
I've got 15 horses. But it's not because I want to

own 15 horses, it's because I need a lot of horses
to play polo.
I: Kenney, it doesn't seem pretentious to me. It
sounds like great fun. I always like to think that
people with money are enjoying it...
KJ: Yes. As long as you have it and aren't wast
ing it, I agree. And polo is very very fun — it's
a great turn on for me, because I truly love
horses. Being in the music business without a
horse — God knows what would've happened
to me, because the horse is like my psychiatrist.
I: Paul, let me ask you something about The
Firm. Was it aggravating in any sense playing
with Jimmy Page?
PR: It was tough. He's a brilliant guitar
player, and both of us have our roots in the
blues, but he's gone in a slightly different direc
tion now which is much much more technical
and speed-oriented than I would like to work
with, to be perfectly frank.
Although I love the guy, I find that I have a
much more simplistic approach to music, and I
look for more of a ... I don't know what it is. If
I say it's a feel thing, that doesn't really explain
it, because he also has a very strong feel. Per
haps the two of us feel it different ways.
It was a great experience working with him;
we wrote a lot of songs together and that was a
great challenge. We didn't actually sit in a stu
dio and compose a song. It tended to be more
like, he would give me a cassette and say "Hey,
what do you think of this, man, would you have
a listen to it and see if you can come up with
some lyrics?"
And that's the way we wrote songs together
— a sort of "arm's length" approach, in a way.
But it worked. "Midnight Moonlight Lady" was
an enormous challenge for me, and I really

enjoyed doing that. It was enormously satisfy
ing because it's such an epic song to write lyrics
to, and it has a 9/4 chorus — I didn't even know
what that was.
I: Jimmy's the master of that stuff — that's his
thing.
PR: Yes, he did take me into areas where I never
would have gone, but they weren't areas I
wanted really to pursue. I'm pretty much a 4/4
guy, really.
I: The two of you, collectively, have played with
some of the great guitar players ... the thing I
like about your new album is that the guitars
seem to take in bits and pieces of all the gui
tarists you've both worked with. Not in a repet
itive way - none of it sounds old - it just takes
in some of the best of the six or seven guitarists
you've worked with.
PR: That's exactly what we were trying to
achieve; we tried to make an album that would
satisfy all of the people who have followed us
throughout the years and an album that was
true to our real nature.
KJ: And break new ground as well.
PR: It's a fine line to walk, really, 'cause we
wanted it to reflect the past but also to sound
contemporary. Mike Hehir plays some great
stuff on there. He's not a particularly well
known guitarist, but when he gets that guitar
on, boy there's fireworks! Jim Barber and John
Staehely play great guitar on there too. And
Dave Gilmour's guitar on "Stone" is just outra
geous, I think. That's what we like about the
way The Law is working, is that we can do that,
introduce new people and also feature estab
lished people too if they choose to come along.
I: There's been some odd lyrical censorship
going on in this country for the last couple of
years...
PR: I'll tell you what I feel about censorship. If
people abuse their right to freedom of speech
then they deserve to be censored. I think we
have to be responsible to a certain extent. In
lyrics, I don't like to hear — and I don't like to
sing — blatant swearing and stuff like that, I
just find it offensive. I think the 2 Live Crew
stuff is nonsense. It's just street garbage and I
don't like it.
Any sort of sexuality in a lyric I prefer to be
suggested rather than openly stated. I find that
in women, too. I like subtlety. To be attractive,
their sexuality doesn't have to be blatant, I feel.
KJ: Yes, and it's the same in music.
I: When does the tour start?
PR: I th'nk we'll start in the United States in
September and then tour worldwide.
I: Are you going to firm up the membership of
The Law at some point?
KJ: Well it's hard. You can't just go out anymore
and get a permanent band just like that; it just
doesn't happen.
I: Why is that?
KJ: Ifyou go back years to when the Small Faces
started and Free, you realize that those groups
happened naturally; you can't go out and man
ufacture that.
I: You mean that when you've grown up
together and the band forms from just hanging
out together, it's not the same as putting some
thing together.
KJ: Yes, exactly.
PR: It becomes harder later in life to get that
thing where you just are hanging around
together naturally.
KJ: That's right. Now what we're doing is that
The Law is kind of open. We have an open
mind; if somebody comes along and they fit in
with us and we feel good about it, we'll depu
tize them.

Kenney Jones
and Paul
Rodgers are
The Law.
Rodgers —
formerly the
lead singer of
Bad Company
and The Firm
— and Jones,
who was the
drummer for
Small Faces,
have recently
joined forces.
What do you get when you combine
the former lead singer of Free and
the former drummer of The Who?
You get The Law.
The Law is a new group formed by Paul
Rodgers — who was also the lead singer of Bad
Company and The Firm — and Kenney Jones
— who was also the drummer for Small Faces.
An impressive duo, to be sure, one you would
expect impressive music from.
Clearly people did have high expectations
for The Law; their debut album was added to
radio station playlists even before it had been
released.
And people weren't disappointed.
Rodgers does his best singing in 15 years,
spurred by Jones' solid and economical drum
ming and guest appearances by Bryan Adams,
David Gilmour and Chris Rea. Huge guitar
lines tie the songs together, and sound familiar
to the former bands of both members.
That's no surprise, though; the song "Laying
Down The Law" begins with an updated ver
sion of the guitar riff from "Bad Company,"
one of Rodgers' hits with the group Bad Com
pany. And "Nature of The Beast" (written by
Adams and Jim Vallance) features Rodgers' best
singing on the album as he jumps to his high
register, reminiscent of Frees 1969 "All Right
Now." (Which was also Rodgers' first hit sin
gle.)
Rodgers and Jones knew each other for
years before joining forces. At one point, Free
toured with Small Faces and the two musicians
would "jam together at the end of gigs." And in
1983 they both played on the ARMS tour,
which raised money for multiple sclerosis
research, a disease which had stricken former
Small Faces member Ronnie Lane.
Intermission caught up with The Law and
talked to them about their past musical experi
ences, their new album and their plans for the
future.
Intermission: How did The Law come
together?
Paul Rodgers: I had written some songs and I
asked Kenney to come over to my house and
help me record them. I played a bit of bass, a
bit of guitar, just for the sake of filling out the
sounds, and we did some nice things, actually.
Later we thought we really ought to get in a
proper guitarist and a proper bass player if
we're going to do this right. And that's how The
Law was born, just from the two of us messing
about in the studio and then bringing people
in.
I: Kenney, it must have been hard to follow
Keith Moon as drummer for The Who. Your
styles are so different, yours being so much
more understated and subtle. And your sense
of time is so different.
Kenney Jones: I can't think for the life of me
why The Who asked me to join them. All I can
think is that we came up through the same era.
It was the mod era and at one stage, the press
