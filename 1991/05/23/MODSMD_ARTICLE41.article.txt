Singin' the blues
— but with
precision
"Whites Off Earth Now!!"
Cowboy Junkies
When I heard Cowboy Junkies for
the first time, I was in awe. I had never
encountered a band that could pro
duce music so simply and unpreten
tiously (my introduction to the group,
"The Trinity Session," was — like the
recently released "Whites Off Earth
Now!!" — recorded with a single
microphone) and yet achieve a sound
that was at once so rich and original.
My enthusiasm was quickly
damped by a cynical, self-styled, "real"
blues fan with whom I spoke about the
band.
"Men like John Lee Hooker have
been doing this for decades," he said,
"same instruments, same style, same
everything — and it's nothing to get
excited about. But the Junkies are still
gonna sell more records, because they
signed onto a big label and put a pretty
white girl on the mike."
Gulp.
It took me two-and-a-half years —
until the national release of "Whites
Off Earth Now!!" — to discover the
flaws in the blues purist's criticism.
The album, which was recorded in
1986 but not heavily distributed until
earlier this year, contains only one
original tune. The other eight tracks
are covers of music first performed by
masters ranging from Bruce Spring
steen to His Holiness, John Lee.
Consequently, the album serves
both as a tribute to the blues influences
that made Cowboy Junkies possible
and as a perfect illustration of exactly

what makes their music genuinely
original.
By sticking to arrangements of pre
viously recorded songs, "Whites Off
Earth Now!!" confounds uncreative
accusations of musical piracy: Yep,
you're right, they didn't write these
tracks. But even if other bands were
doing the same songs 40 years ago,
they were definitely not doing it as
cleanly or as precisely.
Most superficially, it
strikes me as funny to
imagine the elfin Timmins
roughing up her man.
Purists, calm thyselves. I realize that
precision and clarity weren't key objec
tives of pre-rock blues. That is why
they're new and interesting in "Whites
Off Earth Now!!" Ah-ha.
More importantly, they weren't
singing with Junkies' lead vocalist
Margo Timmins' voice, which by itself
is worth the price of this compact disc.
In an eia when most vocal tracks are
electronically spliced composites of a
dozen takes, Timmins' performance
provides a flattering tribute to human
ability. Recorded along with the rest of
the band on a single microphone, her
voice is nonetheless a treasure: Often
plaintive, sometimes soothing, always
hypnotic and sensual, it makes the
album unique not only within its own
genre but across all types of modern
recorded music.
It's not surprising, therefore, that
one of the best tracks on the album is
the only original, "Take Me." Arranged
to showcase Timmins' voice in a mas
terfully coordinated interplay with her
brother Michael's guitar, "Take Me"

proves that Cowboy Junkies' talents
encompass both synthesis and tran
scendence of their influences.
Because Cowboy Junkies albums
are mood-oriented rather than track
oriented, I would feel silly discussing
other individual songs in depth. I feel
compelled, however, to point out two
tracks that illustrate a novel aspect of
the album.
One of the delightful aspects of
"Whites Off Earth Now!!" — missing
in the two more recently recorded
albums — is the occasional vengeful
ness in Timmins' dark-angel lyrics. In
"Me and the Devil"( Robert Johnson),
Timmins confesses her plans to return

home and batter her boyfriend — a
role reversal I found startling until I
heard the even more severe "Forgive
Me" (originally by Hooker): "I
grabbed my shotgun, I broke down, I
started to mow that man down."
I appreciate her sentiments on sev
eral levels. Most superficially, it strikes
me as funny to imagine the elfin Tim
mins roughing up her man. Deeper,
though, is the pleasure that comes
along with hearing a woman express
feelings that are traditionally consid
ered the exclusive domain of men.
I just hope I never get on her bad
side.

Rock and folk,
but especially
the blues
Uncle Tupelo
"No Depression"
They're desperate, so get used to it.
Uncle Tupelo's first album (available
since the middle of 1990, but only
recently getting the attention it
deserves) is all depression, despite
what the title says. This Illinois trio
drinks of a bitter, bitter cup right from
"Graveyard Shift," the opening cut.
The musical tone of the LP — a
combination of X's early Los Angeles
punk energy and Driving and Crying's
"nouveau rootsiness" — is established
with this first tune and lasts through
out the album to the back-porch har
monic blues cut that closes the record
ing.
Singer Jay Farrar delivers stun-gun
lines regarding troubles, sorrows,
depression and strife, with a country
catch in his voice and a disarming
hoarseness. His pipes are raw and ugly
with a down-home appeal designed
for lyrics about choosing whiskey over
Jesus "not forever, just for now."
They're perfect for making his point:
"there's sorrow enough for all, just go
in any bar and ask."
Many numbers on this album focus
on the pitiful aspect of drinking — I
was reminded of the down-and-out
types who always seem to get arrested
on camera on television shows like
Cops. But the straightforward
approach of Uncle Tupelo avoids
glamorization, achieving instead a wry
realism.
Songs on "No Depression" come in
two basic modes, folk and rock. The
closer-to-folk numbers may, as in
"That Year," incorporate a bluegrass
twang and charm where the guitars are
not outrightly audacious, but manage
an appealing confidence.
Elsewhere, the real folk blues come
out in the crude but effective harmo

nizing of the title track, which incor
porates banjo and upright bass. In this
Depression-era cover song, Farrar's
voice transmits bittersweet hope, "My
home's in heaven, I'm going there."
Sad and beautiful combine again for
the gorgeous waltz of "Whiskey Bot
tle," in which the moan of the pedal
steel is as evocative as the lonesome
cooing of a mourning dove.
Ruggedly up-tempo or
sedately old-fashioned,
Uncle Tupelo makes the
words matter most.
The more rocking side of Uncle
Tupelo emerges in the simple but elo
quent worker song "Factory Belt" and
its weary chorus "Looks like it's time to
lay this burden down," and also in the
youthful exuberance of "Gravevard
Shift" which makes a stab at a Harm
Farm or Camper Van Beethoven-tvpe
chirpiness. Elsewhere, such as on the
cut "Outdone," Uncle Tupelo dips into
the vigorous surf of heartland rock
with the feel of a John Cougar Mellen
camp or Steve Earl. On "Train," the
group pitches full force into a roots
rock roadhouse stompin' pace.
Ruggedly up-tempo or sedately
old-fashioned, Uncle Tupelo makes
the words matter most.
The band's visceral rock is mostly
effective because it frames beautiful
turns of phrase. However, even those
are sometimes out of place. The last
line of "Flatness," "There's darkness in
this life but the brighter side we also
may view," should close the LP. Instead
"No Depression" ends with the self
consciousness of "Screen Door"
"Down here where we're at, everyone
is equally poor."
This is the only place it happens,
but the unfortunate sly smile in Far
rar's voice is a too-cute ending to an
otherwise genuine, if dark, album.

The album title reads "No Depression," but the lyrics seem to declare just the
opposite. The sorrows of love are certainly evident in Uncle Tulipo's rock and
folk-style music. Uncle Tulipo is (left to right) Jeff Tweedy, Mike Heidorn and
Jay Farrar.
