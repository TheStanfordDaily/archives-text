Testing out their
'down home'
sound
"The Ghosts that Haunt Me"
Crash Test Dummies
I learned something this week.
Whereas I had always known you
couldn't judge a book by its cover, I
only recently found out that the same
goes for compact discs.
I mean, the cover of Crash Test
Dummies' debut album, "The Ghosts
That Haunt Me," frightened me — so
much so that I nearly overlooked it
before giving it a listen.
However, my self-proclaimed open
mind forced me to play it. With my
ears covered, I awaited the noise, brac
ing myself for a series of violent
screeches and screaming guitars. I
expected to be startled, and 1 was. My
startlement, however, was at the gentle
keyboard introduction to the senti
mental "Winter Song." and at my own
toe tapping to the upbeat percussion,
tambourine and violin (yes, violin) in
this happy tune.
Crash Test Dummies are not the
heavy metal thrashers that their name
and cover design indicate; they are,
instead, a band that brings listeners the
newest twist on acoustic roots music
from the Canadian Rockies.
The twist is an innovative use of
instruments and vocals in a traditional
foundation of country-influenced
rock. The result is a healthy, "down
home" sound complemented by

instrumental surprises, all presented in
the framework of their straightforward
lyrics, which really hit home.
Guest musicians provide further
twists to the Dummies' style. The use
of the violin in "Winter Song" and
"The Country Life" offers a country
fiddle sound, whereas in "At My
Funeral," the violin adds rich, legato
undertones, countering the high, chill
ing tones of the recorder.
The cello in "Superman's Song"
blends beautifully with the harmonic
vocals in a simple ballad form, empha
sizing the ironic lyrics comparing the
social consciousness of Tarzan and
Superman.
The pedal steel used on "The Voy
age" and the banjo on "Comin' Back
Soon (The Bereft Man's Song)," my
personal favorite, present a true coun
try, bluegrass feel, revealing their Lyle
Lovett tendencies.
Degrees in both English and philos
ophy provide Brad Roberts a literary
foundation for the composition of
eight of the 10 tracks on "The Ghosts
That Haunt Me." The variety of liter
ary allusions, irony and social com
mentary is simply stated without the
gobbledygook of confusing innuen
does or twisted analogies. The lyrics
are meant to be heard and understood
but are absent of didactic or moralistic
tones. The lyrics of the title track, "The
Ghosts That Haunt Me" create simple
imagery which bring to heart senti
ments of pain and memories of lost
love, backed up by a slow, strong,
undulating beat.
"Androgynous," an interpretation
of the Replacements' original, exem
plifies the Dummies' use of wry

humor in proposing a light social
commentary.
If the name Crash Test Dummies is
misleading as to the type of music this
group plays, I don't know that any
other name would have been more
appropriate, in light of the varied
nature of their music. Roberts claims
that the name "[relates] to all of the
styles we play and none at the same
time." I highly recommend that you
test out Crash Test Dummies. . ..
Enjoy the ride!

Less cynical,
more musical,
but no better
"Mighty Like a Rose"
Elvis Costello
When I saw Elvis Costello at the
Bridge concert last fall, it blew me
away. I wasn't really a big fan of his, but
there he was with just his voice and an
acoustic guitar (or, at times, a piano),
giving such a powerful performance
that he stole the show from all the
other artists — including the event's
host, the revitalized Neil Young.
The album progresses
from Costello"s familiar,
venomous sarcasm to a
mature and more
frankly emotional and
confessional tone.
I was hooked.
The reason I mention this is that
two of the songs Costello performed at
the Bridge concert are tracks from his
recently released "Mighty Like a Rose."
The solo performance of those tunes
was compelling enough to turn me
into a fan. A big fan. Unfortunately,
the album wouldn't have done the
same, had I heard it first.
The problem with the album is the
addition of far too many instruments.
The passion and power of the concert
version of the lilting piano ballad,
"Couldn't Call It Unexpected #4," is
dulled by the addition of horns, a
banjo and several keyboards. Instead
of enhancing the song, these additions
give a carnival sound to what was per
fect with just the piano and vocals.
Many of the other tracks on the album
suffer from the same over-instrumen
tation as well, in addition to some
musical overwriting.
However, "Mighty Like a Rose" is,
despite this, a very good album. Open
ing with a sarcastic look at the ecology
and a decaying civilization, the album
progresses from Costello's familiar,
venomous sarcasm and wit to a mature
and more frankly emotional and con
fessional tone.
Closing forcefully with "Couldn't
Call It Unexpected," the album repre
sents new terrain for a man who has
made a career out of spiteful cynicism.
The last words, "Please don't let me
fear anything I can't explain/I can
believe I'll never believe anything
again," is powerful stuff, even with the
extra instrumentation.
Costello shows us he's still adept at
twisted wit and sarcasm. But he also —
for the first time — shows us that he's
not afraid to admit that fear of death
and the matters of love are heavy on
his mind these days. He's not as young
and angry anymore, but he's still got
some things to say and he knows how
to say them well — even if he feels

compelled to prove he's grown up by
tacking on some string arrangements,
horns and extra keyboards.
In essence, "Mighty Like a Rose" is
composed of what are mostly great
songs. But I'm willing to bet they will
sound even better when he plays them
in concert at Berkeley at the end of the
month — without all the studio trap
pings.

'90s pop meets
'50s doo-wop
"Cutting Theii Own Groove"
Big Daddy
Who is Big Daddy and why are they
playing 1950s versions of modern
songs?
Big Daddy was a famous '50s rock
group that disappeared in 1959 when
their tour plane got lost and crashed
on a remote South Sea island. The
band remained there for years, until
they finally figured out how to fix the
plane's engine.
Eventually resurfacing in the
United States, Big Daddy claimed they
had actually written many of the hit
songs currently on the radio — 30
years ago. And they had the cassette
tapes (which they claim to have
invented) to prove it.
If you ask Big Daddy anyway, that's
what they'll tell you.
Now, with their third album, "Cut
ting Their Own Groove," Big Daddy
continues to poke fun at modern hits,
blending them with doo-wops, sh
booms and rang-a-lang-a-ding-dongs.
It's an interesting gimmick, and what
prevents it from being merely that is
the fact that they do it so well. In fact,
Big Daddy does it well enough that
they had a minor hit a few years back
with their version of Bruce Spring
steen's "Dancing in the Dark."
And they may just have another
one with their new version of Vanilla
Ice's "Ice Ice Baby," which is more than
reminiscent of Chuck Berry's "Johnny
B. Goode." Sound weird? Well, it is.
The song starts with Berry's opening
guitar lick and then strangely merges
with the bass line from Queen's
"Under Pressure." The lyrics belong to
Vanilla Ice, but the melody is unmis
takably Berry's and, surprisingly, it

works.
Other highlights on the album
include Guns 'n' Roses' "Welcome To
The Jungle," done to the tune of "The
Lion Sleeps Tonight," and Talking
Heads' "Once in a Lifetime," done & la
Harry Belafonte. B. Daddy also merges
"Nothing Compares 2 U"
with Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" and
gives listeners their interpretation of
Paul Simon's "Graceland," U2's "I Still
Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"
and Springsteen's "Born To Run."
Though all of the tunes are good,
the high point of the album is "Money
For Nothing," which Big Daddy wres
tles to fit into the form of Tennessee
Ernie Ford's "Sixteen Tons," a song
that was also mined by the Stray Cats
for "Stray Cat Strut."
Having a familiarity with '50s
music may enhance your appreciation
of Big Daddy, but you need not possess
the in-depth knowledge of the music
that they clearly do. Listeners with
only a passing acquaintanceship with
'50s tunes should enjoy the rampant
lunacy and incongruity of the album.
"Cutting Their Own Groove" isn't just
a novelty record: The performances
are so good that the tracks stand on
their warped and twisted own.

Parker grows
up and
calms down
"Struck by Lightning"
Graham Parker
Graham Parker has a voice that
invites listeners to turn off their
stereos.
Fortunately, he's stopped yelling
(believe it or not, volume does not
improve a bad voice), and his latest
album, "Struck By Lightning," is sur
prisingly good.
It's not a masterpiece, though. The
songs tend to sound alike, Parker's
voice is still grating — to say the least
— and he apparently suffers from
acute Edie Brickell-itis, mentioning
dogs in far too many tracks. However,
"Struck By Lightning" does include
several very good cuts and, like a wart,
Parker's voice grows on you.
Actually, there is a lot to like about

this album. For one thing, Parker takes
full advantage of the not-so-long-play
ing record's extinction, packing onto
the compact disc 15 songs and just
under an hour's worth of music. For
another, this is genuine rock 'n' roll:
Parker and friends having a good time
playing real instruments. How pass£!
In one of the better songs on the
album, "A Brand New Book," Parker
sings, "The words came out/Not twist
'Struck By Lightning'
does include several
very good songs and y
like a wart, Parkers
voice grows on you.
and shout/'Cause that's not what a
grown man writes about," and the
lines are reflective of the change in
Parker's music over his 15-year career.
He's more secure in his song-writing
ability, willing to let his songs speak for
themselves.
In the past, Parker's hand seemed to
rise out of the turntable and pull your
face toward a speaker so he could belt
his anger into you. Now he's more
sedate.
In fact, nowhere is the change more
evident than in the album's final track,
"The Sun Is Gonna Shine Again." Eas
ily Parker's best effort, this song finds
the singer at ease with his voice —
when he relaxes, it's not all that bad —
looking forward to a future full of
friendship and equality.
Also noteworthy are "Weeping
Statues," a satire about people who
claim to have been visited by UFOs or
to have seen Elvis, "Over the Border
(To America)" and"The Kid With The
Butterfly Net," a poor man's version of
Joni Mitchell's "The Circle Game."
In all, nine or 10 of the tracks on
the album are certainly worth owning,
more than can be said about most
albums, and even the dog song has its
moments: "Now I'm outside freezing
to death/Just walking the dog/Instead
of throwing myself at my wife/I'm
throwing a log."
— Ari Richter
