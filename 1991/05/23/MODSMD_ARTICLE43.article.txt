# A
						very young a capella group
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
There is a significant portion of
the Stanford community that actu
ally enjoys a capella groups.
Inundated with dorm perfor
mances, recitals and albums, these
individuals still can't seem to get
enough. Unable to sing properly
themselves, they have chosen to sub
limate their desires through some
what pathetic idolatry. They are sick
and almost beyond help.
It is these people whom the Men
dicants are trying to cure with the
release of their new album, "Just
Like That." With 19 songs ranging in
style from campy to romantic, the
Mendicants hope to showcase the
group's new talent while satisfying
the a capella that so much of Stan
ford craves.
The group, which was founded in
1962, has changed quite a bit since
their days as the only a capella
ensemble on campus, and they have
tried to document this transition on
their latest album. The songs include
an impressive array of styles that are
— a warning for a capella purists —
occasionally accompanied by
kazoos, sound effects and smatter
ings of bongo drums.
With only sue one-year veterans
and nine new members, the group
has carefully chosen to support their
young sound with a selection of
tunes chosen from the group's long
history. Included are the theme from
"Happy Days" and rap sensation
M.C. Hammer's übiquitous hit "U
Can't Touch This," spiced up (as if it
needed it) with a touch of original

Stanfordian lyrics.
An impressive job is also done on
"Long Train Running," which fea
tures a strong, bluesy solo. "Theft O'
My Heart," an original work written
by Mendicant alumnus Britt Mur
ray, is also included on the album, as
well as traditional favorites "Only
You" and Depeche Mode's "Some
body."

cants album for your very own ($8

preview, the Mendicants will be per

I hope all you a capella fans are
finally satiated.
