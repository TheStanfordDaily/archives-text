As we approached Redwood City, we tried to hide our
ever-increasing anxiety. Singing waiters. What will we do if
they have singing waiters?
This was no pointless concern; it had happened to us
before. We'd go to a real, authentic Italian restaurant. The
menu would look great, the food would taste good, we'd be
trying to avoid cultural faux pas and then BOOM, we'd
accidentally tip our glass and out of nowhere would come
this heavyset, unctuous waiter belting out lines from that
Wagnerian Bugs Bunny episode, "You spilled your
water/Spilled your water...."
But once we entered Cafe Figaro 11, our silent fears were
quelled. The restaurant specializes in personal — and per
sonable — service from the moment you enter and are
greeted by a friendly, three-dimensional version of Mario.
(Or is it Luigi?)
Tony Gundogdu, the restaurant's co-owner, will meet
you at the door with a smile and a welcome. A native of
Turkey, Tony worked at both North Beach Restaurant in
San Francisco and II Fornaio in Palo Alto before bringing
his expertise to Redwood City.
As soon as you are seated, Tony will bring you sour
dough bread, accompanied by a small dish of extra-virgin
(ask him for an explanation) olive oil with several cloves of
garlic and a basil leaf. Then he will explain that the reason
ably priced entrees can easily be adjusted to suit your indi
vidual tastes, whatever they may be.
Our personal tastes led us to pass up the array of original
salads and opt instead for a pricey ($6.95) but elegant appe

tizer: Sue prawns, sauteed in olive oil and garlic, were sur
rounded by mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts,
olives and feta cheese, creating a suitable opening to the
meal, which we continued with an evening special —
Chicken Sorrentino.
The Chicken Sorrentino, prepared with eggplant, moz
zarella and prosciutto ($12.95), was clearly the stand-out
course of the evening. Taking advantage of the "have it your
way" credo of Cafe Figaro, we chose to have the dish sans
prosciutto. However, we imagine you carnivores will appre
ciate the dish just as much with meat as we did without it,
if not more. And, although the dish was a special, Tony
assured us that the restaurant would prepare it (or any other
dish) upon request. Talk about service.
We also ordered the Fettucini Alfredo ($8.25), which,
although not as outstanding as the chicken, was also enjoy
able. The pasta itself was delicious — Cafe Figaro II makes
its own daily — and the alfredo sauce was adequately
creamy without being overbearing.
Though we were fairly full, we couldn't leave this ami
able place without sampling their desserts. We decided to
try both the Tiramisu and the Amaretto Cheesecake. Both
were delicious, but the Tiramisu was exceptional — possi
bly the best offered in this area. The probable reason? Cafe
Figaro II uses real marscapone cheese layered between
ladyfingers soaked in amaretto and espresso, which gives
the dish a creamy consistency. The dish is topped with a
healthy amount of shredded chocolate, which adds an inter
esting touch to the dish without detracting from the flavor
ful cheese.
It isn't often that a restaurant is good enough to make
you want to go further north on El Camino than Safeway,
but Cafe Figaro II is worth the adventure. While the inti
mate restaurant is a perfect place to bring a date or your
parents, Cafe Figaro II is also ideal for a couple of college
kids in search of an affordable homemade Italian meal.
