bargain at $4 for students. ...
Sure. Who doesn't? OK, here's the
secret recipe:
Outfit a talented ensemble of
dancers in a rainbow of layered
clothes. With the breathtaking magnif
icence of a peacock's plumes, vivid col
ors flash.
Take these costumes from diverse
Mexican regions — from el Norte and
Jalisco, from Oaxaca and Colima.
Add the richness of traditional
dance. And a dash of fun.
Mix well with the traditional cul
ture of Mexico.
And what is created?
Another entrancing performance of
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford, an enter
taining group of 30 talented dancers
who strive to expose the community to
the music and folk dance of Mexico.
Living art.
This ensemble of Stanford students
is primarily, but not exclusively, com
posed of Chicano (Mexican-Ameri
can) students, and their repertoire
includes both traditional folk dances

and more contemporary works by
Mexican and Chicano choreographers
of this generation. The group has been
performing and touring throughout
California for the past year.
And now, they're in Dinkelspiel

Auditorium on Friday and Saturday
nights, presenting their annual spring
show.
So if you miss them the first time,
you still have another chance. Don't
blow it.
