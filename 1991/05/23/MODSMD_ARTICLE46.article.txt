You can smell it from The Gap. Its odor teases you; you
forget about the jeans you needed and start thinking about
lunch instead. You follow the scent, weaving quickly past
shoppers at the Stanford Shopping Center until you get to
Babbo's.
And then, you see it. From the restaurant's wood-burn
ing ovens emerges ... Pizza Classico. Or Pizza Ordinario.
Or Pizza Quattro Stagione. Or one of the other numerous
hand-stretched pizzas that Babbo's offers — straight from
the heart of Italy.
The best thing about Babbo's is its variety. Whether
you're a vegetarian or a meat lover, unique combinations of
cheese and toppings will inspire the exotic in you to surface,
as will the entertainment. Priding itself in "funkiness,"
according to owners Paulette and Laszlo Fono, Babbo's
offers live guitar music performed by Stanford medical stu
dents and video screens featuring hit songs with subtitles —
perfect for sing-alongs.
But it's the food that keeps the customers returning.
Tasty, creative and always fresh, the dishes are exceptional.
In the words of Paulette, "the tomatoes never saw a can and
the cheese makes you move."
Aside from pizza, Babbo's offers meat dishes such as
chicken, steak and lamb, as well as fish cooked on a tradi
tional Provencal rotisserie. And sandwich lovers will enjoy
the Foccaccia Robusto, which are made with soft, warm
bread baked fresh each day.
With so many choices, where do you begin?
I recommend starting with a Mediterranean spinach
salad, which looks and smells almost as good as it tastes. All
the salads are made with fresh, varied leaves and are best
topped with a light wine vinaigrette.
For your appetizer, try the hearty Tuscan vegetable soup
with pesto. And for the main course, I suggest the foccaccia
sandwiches, which offer many interesting combinations of
cheeses, herbs and meats. A specialty for vegetarians is the
foccaccia with olives, goat cheese, roasted eggplant and
tomato.
However, you really can't forget the pizza. It's the high
light of any Babbo's meal.
Two interesting selections are the Pizza Marinara —
pizza without cheese — and Pizza Bianco — pizza without

sauce. Both taste great, though different from what you re
used to. Babbo's aims to reform even the staunchest pizza
haters.
My persona] favorite is the Pizza with Four Seasons,
which has everything — tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto,
mushrooms, artichokes, capers and anchovies. Vegetarians,
however, will enjoy the Pizza Verdura and cheese lovers will
be ecstatic over Pizza ai Quattro Formaggi (Pizza with Four
Cheeses), which contains mozzarella, fontina, provolone
and parmesan. And unless you have a real taste for salt, I
would recommend avoiding the Pizza al Pesto.
All the dishes are made on the
premises. Customers can actually
watch their pizzas being prepared
and placed into the authentic log
burning ( ven behind the front
counter of the restaurant.
Babbo's secret to excellence is several-fold. First, they use
fresh ingredients in everything they make. All the dishes are
made on the premises; customers can actually see their piz
zas being prepared and placed into the authentic log-burn
ing oven behind the front counter of the restaurant.
Second, Babbo's uses olive oil, never butter. This is a
"Mediterranean" trick, which adds a delicious touch to piz
zas, salads and breads, while also being a healthier option.
Finally, Babbo's is run with a personal touch that makes
every dining experience special. Laszlo and Paulette wel
come their guests each day into a comfortable interior dec
orated with their daughter's art. The couple enjoys treating
their guests like family. In fact, Babbo's in English means
"Daddy's"
This restaurant is a perfect place to take a date, or to take
your parents the next time they visit. The portions are
hearty and the side dishes exquisite. Though the pizza is
gourmet, don't think this is one of those restaurants that
serve minuscule portions — bring a healthy appetite.
Also, bring a group so you can sample as much as possi
ble. That way, nothing will get by you. Of course, once
you've been to Babbo's, you'll want to return anyway.
