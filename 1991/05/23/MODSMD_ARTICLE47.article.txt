Edge-of-your
seat, fire-fight
ing action
"Backdraft," starring Kurt Rus
sell, William Baldwin, Robert
De Niro, Scott Glenn, Jennifer
Jason Leigh and Rebecca De
Mornay
I have never had to go to the bath
room so badly in my life.
There I was, thoroughly enjoying
"Backdraft," when it hit me: the over
whelming need to relieve myself. God,
it was awful.
"Leave," said my sister, "I'll tell you
what happens."
But I couldn't. There was no way 1
was going to walk out. I shifted posi
tions, crossed my legs, recrossed my
legs and essentially tied myself in
knots. I sat through an hour of dis
comfort.
Why? Two reasons.
One: My sister has a horrible grasp
of movie plots. Really. Ask her to
describe a movie — any movie — she's
seen. She can't. She's not stupid — in
fact, she's quite bright — but when the
lights go down and the film starts
rolling, half of her functional brain
cells become inert. I don't really
understand why; maybe it's something
that happened to her when she was a
child. Maybe it's something I did to her
when she was a child. Whatever.
Two: The film was incredibly capti
vating. I didn't think a movie about
fire fighters could really say much, but
it did. "Backdraft" was dramatic, well
written and had terrific visual effects.
The actors were excellent and they had
a screenplay that utilized the best of
their talents.
Not that "Backdraft" was perfect, of
course. There was a little too much
brother-father-estranged-wife schmaltz
for my taste; at times it weighed the
movie down.
Also, I kept expecting to see
William Baldwin running up the stairs
of the Philadelphia Art Museum to the
theme from "Rocky." (Of course, the
movie was filmed in Chicago, so I

guess I should have figured that wasn't
going to happen.)
And Kurt Russell wore far too
much eyeliner for such a macho guy.
But these slight flaws were erased
from my mind by two things: Donald
Sutherland and Scott Glenn. Suther
land portrayed an incarcerated arson
ist, and did it so well that it gave me the
chills. And Glenn has such a great face;
as my mother would say, "It's got char
acter."
In addition, the movie was both
humorous and touching. I haven't
cried as much — or as frequently —
since I saw Bambi's mother get killed.
(Except for that one haircut...)
Of course, it may have been my
bladder.

Role reversal
and opposite
attraction
"Impromptu," starring Judy
Davis, Hugh Grant and Julian
Sands
There's a famous adage that says
opposites attract; some people believe
it, others don't. But beware disbeliev
ers: "Impromptu" may make you
change your minds.
Based on the real-life love affair of
eccentric novelist George Sand and
virtuoso composer Frederic Chopin,
"Impromptu" chronicles the progres
sion of a relationship between two
people who couldn't be more different.
Judy Davis portrays Sand, the
famous 19th century Bohemian social
critic who was known for breaking
conventions by dressing in men's
clothing and publicizing her torrential
love affairs in her writings. Davis
depicts Sand's audacity with a perfor
mance reminiscent of Katherine Hep
burn: full of inner strength and ageless
beauty.
In contrast, Hugh Grant is the
timid Frederic Chopin. Clearly weaker
than Sand in character, Chopin is the
seduced, rather than the seducer. The

audience sees the humor, but also the
propriety, of the situation in which
Sand dresses as a man in order to
attract Chopin. Grant performs his
role admirably, giving charm to the
meek character.
An added bonus to the film is the
star performance of Julian Sands ("A
Room With A View"), who uses his
debonair style well, giving an exciting
flare to the role of Chopin's fellow
composer Franz Liszt.
"Impromptu" reveals how two
adverse personalities contrast and then
interact, working together to over
come the attempts of "friends" to sep
arate them. Eventually, Sand and
Chopin consummate their relation
ship, proving that love overcomes all
obstacles. One leaves this movie feeling
happy, rejoicing in how beautiful love
can be.
Indeed, "Impromptu" is a celebra
tion of beauty. Paris, the French coun
tryside and the Gothic architecture of
France all make the film pleasurable to
watch, and the music, primarily by
Chopin and Liszt, further enhances the
film's loveliness.
"Impromptu" is truly a fine movie,
in every sense of the word.

Conspiracy, cor
ruption and
colonialism
"Mister Johnson," starring
Pierce Brosnan and Maynard
Eziashi
Nigeria, 1923: Morning is washing
over a landscape of dry red earth,
sparse gnarled trees and a rushing
stream. Suddenly a black man in a very
white suit and a pith helmet rushes
down to the stream, frightening sev
eral women.
"Bamu!" he cries to one. "You are
the most beautiful girl! You have the
most wonderful breasts! God bless you
with them!"
Mr. Johnson is so unabashedly
effusive, everyone in the West Sudan
outpost of Fada thinks he's a little
crazy. Johnson, a clerk for the British
colonial government, is almost as
much a stranger there as is his English
boss, Judge Rudbeck. From the south,
small and very dark, he looks foreign
to the native people, who are very tall
and lighter skinned — as well as more

reserved. Raised in the mission
schools, he is pathetically attached to
the idea that he is English and that
everything English is good.
Even so, he remains essentially
African — or what the screenwriters
believe to be African — and this is
where the film runs into the few prob
lems it has. It succeeds in staying close
to the 1939 novel it is based on, by
Irish writer loyce Cary (a man). But in
doing so, it seems compelled to char
acterize Africans, and in particular,
Mr. Johnson, as happy-go-lucky types
who live only for the present.
Thus Mr. Johnson (played by
English-born actor Maynard Eziashi)
and Rudbeck (played by Pierce Bros
nan, of TV's "Remington Steele" fame)
appear at times to be stuck in typecast
roles — with Rudbeck as almost
relentlessly stiff and flat.
Directed by Bruce Beresford, who
won an Academy Award last year for
"Driving Miss Daisy," this film is also
about race and power. But "Mister
Johnson" never hits you over the head
with obvious or emotional conclu
sions. Rather, it weaves a complex and
subtle story about a man who sacri
fices himself to a world he dreams up.
You sense tragedy coming from afar;

however, the film's overwhelming tone
is not grief, but a sad sort of wisdom.
Both Mr. Johnson and Rudbeck are
caught in Fada by colonialism. Rud
beck tries to dispense British justice, at
one point failing to convince the cor
rupt local ruler that jailing prostitutes
is less cruel than flogging them. He
The film's overwhelm
ing tone is not grief
but a sad sort of wis
dom.
also has a mission — to bring civiliza
tion to Fada by way of a road, since
there are none to speak of. But he runs
out of money — at least, the funds set
aside for the road.
Since Rudbeck has little imagina
tion, Mr. Johnson is glad to step in to
do whatever he can to be liked, and to
advance British culture. A master at
creative accounting, the bright Mr.
Johnson manages to build the road for
"my best friend, Mr. Rudbeck," even
tually linking it to the main Nigerian
roadway and thus, to a prosperous
future for the colonialists.
But he fails to realize that his
beloved British "countrymen" will not
hesitate to use him. Nor does he realize
the contempt many villagers, even his
beloved Bamu, have for him. His is a
life on the surface, of obliviousness to
the machinations going on all around
him.
Strangely, even as the British and
the villagers conspire against him, Mr.
Johnson feels no fear. As he does with
most subjects, he makes up a little
song about it:"I no 'fraid of nothing
— Johnson 'fraid of nothing in the
world." His vision, while not deep, is
wholly optimistic, and therefore
endearing.
The singing and dancing, the cos
tumes — the art of the film — are rea
son enough alone to see it. While con
ditions on the set in Nigeria might
have been difficult, the film's realism
rings true. The actors look hot, sweaty
and dusty because they are.
"Mister Johnson" is the sort of film
that audiences stay to see the credits
for — all the credits. Despite a few flat
moments it is well-acted. Beautifully
filmed, it does a fine job of showing us,
with great subtlety, the complex rela
tionship — and intimacy — between
unlike people caught in the onslaught
of colonial power.
