In"The Rise of Life on Earth," Joyce Carol Oates
takes us into a world of disturbing passivity and
secret violence. The novel is an intimate account of
the life of Kathleen Hennessy, a nurse's aide in
Detroit in the late '60s and early '70s.
The novel's genius lies in its
portrayal of the way lines
between victimization, violence
and pity blur in Kathleens life.
It is the story of the violence done to Kathleen —
beginning on the night her father, in a drunken rage,
severely beats her and her younger sister. Kathleen is
hospitalized and spends the rest of her childhood
moving from foster home to foster home; her sister
dies.
But Kathleen — on one level a quiet, shy, dull
witted girl — responds to the violence done to her
throughout her life with a deadly, quiet violence of
her own.
The shocking revelation of Kathleen's own hand
in her sister's death and the hints (more than hints,

really) of her responsibility for a fire in one of her
foster families' homes, foreshadow the "abruptly
overpowering rage" that frequently overcomes Kath
leen after she is exploited by a young doctor with
whom she has fallen in love.
The novel's genius lies in its portrayal of the way
lines between victimization, violence and pity blur in
Kathleen's life. Oates never judges her heroine; she
merely supplies the whole devastating truth.
Kathleen commits crimes because she is respond
ing to the world as she knows it in the manner she
understands, responding from her most basic
instinct, which is simply to continue.
.. yes it had been done to her too, such deaths leave
no marks, simply a cessation of life: which means
Death: whatever it was that had been done had been
done and Kathleen Hennessy was all right, would
always be all right and would always be invisible thus
excluded from the human world of power and author
ity and responsibility thus she was valued as the most
trusted of workers..
Oates works hard to get and stay inside the mind
of Kathleen. She varies her style from very simple,
uncompromising prose to long, rambling, danger
ously Faulknerian passages when she deems it best.
However, her changing style is not always as effec
tive as it could be. While Oates certainly avoids bla
tant moralizing, her narrative voice and stylistic
techniques frequently get in the way of her character

ization and distract us into searching for the appro
priate message:
.. Rose Ann Dwyer would cherish [the memory] for
who among us can point with absolute unerring confi
dence to a point in time and to a specific agent the
intersection of which resulted in the prolongation of
our existences?"
But Kathleen — on one level a
quiet, shy dull-witted girl —
responds to the violence done to
her throughout her life with a
deadly quiet violence of her
Oates succeeds best when she avoids inserting her
own voice into the narrative, when she is at her sim
plest and most direct. Occasionally, especially when
we are learning of Kathy's secret vengeances (if they
can even be called so), her attempts at more experi
mental styles succeed, but in general, they serve only
to detract from the effect of the story itself.
While Oates frequently gets in her own way, "The
Rise of Life on Earth" has moments of startling
power that depend not on cheaply bought pity for
her main character, but on an insightful understand
ing of the nature of violence itself as it occurs in
Hennessy's life.
