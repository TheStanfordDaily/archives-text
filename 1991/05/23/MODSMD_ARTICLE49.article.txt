"Spiderwoman's Granddaughters," a collec
tion of stories by Native American women, is a
wonderfully original, spiritual effort coming
from a long-neglected and marginalized seg
ment of our society.
The goal of the anthology, which was edited
by Native-American author Paula Gunn Allen,
is clearly laid out in her introduction: "We are
here to testify that our traditions are valuable to
us, and that we continue to resist obliteration
either of our cultures or our personhood."

After two centuries of decimation and deri
sion, Gunn Allen's book reasserts the strength
of the Native-American woman.
In contrast to what Gunn Allen sees as a
Western literary "need for impermeable classi
ficatory boundaries," this book overcomes
racial stereotypes, gender roles and stodgy lit
erary styles through a broad sampling of both
traditional and contemporary writing.
The theme of eliminating boundaries is
apparent in the three sub-categories of the
book: "Warriors," "Casualties" and "Resis
tance." Each section contains a diverse selection
of stories ranging from traditional spirituals
about Yellow Corn Woman to modern-day les
bian Native Americans struggling with their
identity. But all are testaments to the resiliency

and dignity of the Native-American spirit.
One of the most moving contemporary sto
ries, written by Vicki Sears, tells of two Native-
American orphans who have been sexually and
emotionally abused at an orphanage. After they
are adopted by a kind Indian family, they come
gradually to accept love and kindness without
suspecting ulterior motives.
Leanne Howe's ultra-contemporary tale,
"An American in New York," works out the
anger and disillusionment that the author feels
as a Native American in a land full of outsiders.
While she resents the huge influx of immi
grants who have absorbed native lands and cul
ture, she must acknowledge that white people
are partly responsible for her being alive (she is
half white).

Howe finds herself caught on the "edge of
both races," feeling like she's been "split down
the middle." In dealing with her own mixed
heritage, she comes to respect and understand
the wide variety of people she confronts in New
York City.
Along more traditional lines comes the first
story of the Warrior collection, entitled "A
Woman's Fight." Told firsthand to an ethnogra
pher by Pretty Shield, the tale chronicles the
young author's observation of a battle in which
a powerful old woman controls the fate of two
warring tribes.
As warriors and horses fall during the
onslaught, a medicine-woman armed only
with a root-digger rides through the enemy's

shower of bullets and arrows, singing a victory
song. The attackers are so fearful of her
medicine that they turn tail and run.
These and other stories of the collection are
a powerful tribute to the spiritual reserves to
which Native American women have had access
throughout their troubled history. From the
oldest traditional tale to the most modern, all
of life's experiences are represented as an
opportunity for growth.
Never do the women in these stories give up
or hang their heads in despair. Instead, "Spi
derwoman's Granddaughters" portrays the
indestructible strength of Native-American
culture through the works of some of its great
est writers.
