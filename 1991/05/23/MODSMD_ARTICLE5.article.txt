# AIR may disband
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Academic Information Re
sources will likely be disbanded
and its responsibilities distributed
to other areas of the University
next year.
Although there was no one
clear reason for the move, most
University administrators cited
current duplication of services by
AIR and Library and Information
Resources, and the need to
streamline academic computing
as the main justifications.
AIR operates the campus com
puter system and AlRport, and is
a separate division of Libraries
and Information Resources. The
restructuring will likely end AIR
as an independent division.
Ralph Gorin, director of AIR,
said a task force will be estab
lished to look into how academic
computing will be delivered in the
future. "Portions of AIR might be
distributed elsewhere in Libraries
and Information Resources."
Robert Street, vice president of
Libraries and Information
Resources, began appointing task
force members Monday. The task
force recommendation about the
future of AIR is due June 17,
Gorin said.
Street was unavailable for com
ment yesterday. The only task
force member already appointed is
Chair Frederick Biedenweg, assis
tant vice president for Libraries
and Information Resources.
Biedenweg said other members
of the task force will be selected by
Street this week and declined to
speculate on other members.
He added that it is doubtful any
students or faculty will be selected
for the task force because "of the
tremendous time commitment"
the job will involve to meet the
June 17 deadline.

"We will solicit students and
faculty opinions before making
our recommendation," Biedenweg
said.
Bill Yundt, director of network
ing and communication systems,
predicted "there will be substan
tial changes in the structure."
Yundt added that he knows
"practically nothing yet" because
"the process is not yet underway."
He said a meeting on Friday with
the directors of different divisions
will address "the future alterna
tives."
An open session scheduled for
today with Street will allow AIR
personnel to address their con
cerns, Biedenweg said. Gorin said
he does not foresee any immediate
layoffs due to the restructuring
process, but said "the experiment
might be confounded by variables
outside of our control."
"With the budget woes that
beset the University, we are look
ing throughout our organization

and the entire University for ways
to save money and to perform the
necessary functions with fewer
staff," he said.
Biedenweg said the current
budget crisis might force "12 to 15
percent cuts across the board" but
said the task force will not exam
ine this long-term issue.
"The task force will concen
trate only on the short-term,"
Biedenweg said. "It will determine
which functions should go to what
division of the Libraries and
Information Resources.
"The current functions of AIR
won't go away," Biedenweg added.
"The commitment through this
year and most of next year will
continue."
"Ultimately we do expect this
change to be for the better," Gorin
said.
Gorin said two things helped
prompt the decision to form a task
force to restructure AlR's func
tions — a "personal dissatisfac

tion that I was unable to make
any progress toward things neces
sary to improve Stanford comput
ing" and a long-term desire for
academic computing and the
libraries to merge.
"There is a parallel between
academic computing and the
libraries," Gorin explained. "They
serve the same clientele — faculty
and students — and intend to pro
vide access to information.
"It is true that the technologies
are different, but their mission is
the same. We can reap the benefits
and synergies of accelerating the
cooperation by merging together,"
he added.
Gorin said he would like to
work on the "information archi
tecture" of the University when
AIR is disbanded.
