# Hot and heavy at the Hyatt

They pulsate at their very foundations.
They emit red light out of every orifice.
They have strange and unnatural clouds of
human sweat wafting above them.

Guessed the rebus yet?
They are the motels and hotels of El
Camino Real. *
While sick and scandalous things
go on in many of El Camino's pay-
for-bed establishments, one hotel
transcends ordinary illegality to fea
ture the forbidden — Ssss (sultry, jt
cobraesque hissing noise) — LAM- i
BADA. y
That's right: The dance that 4
was outlawed in Brazil (perhaps for
spreading strange forms of venereal
disease?) is going on right around the
corner from wholesome Stanford Uni
versity — every single Saturday night!
From 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., Hyatt Rickey's,
the hotel so close to Sizzler Family
Restaurant physically, yet so far away spiri
tually, features a Brazilian dance band.
Area residents — sick of cultured nights
at the San Francisco Ballet, craving a haven
from the well-lit establishments of Palo
Alto, longing to get back to the wild, unciv
ilized days of the pre-Palo Alto era, flock to
the Hyatt on Saturday nights like wild
beasts going out to graze and mate unin
hibitedly on an open pasture.
The throbbing Afro-Latin sound of the
four-man band transforms people into
pre-apple-sampling Adams and Eves. By
taking one look at any of these flailing,
fused-together men and women, it is clear
that they know no shame. They may have
clothes on, but certainly they are thinking
vtn If ad I

naked!
"Is that your thigh or mine?" whispers
a dancer to her partner.
"1 don't know, but I think I just slid

on that slinky black garment lying on the floor," he
responds.
Their neighbor is attracted to the woman and decides
to break in. He thrusts his hand between the couple to
cleave them apart, but is unsuccessful as there is no space
between them. He bangs his hand on a pair of elbows,
but his loud curse is muted by the robust wail of the lead
singer.
Dancing knee-to-knee, thigh-to-thigh, pelvis-to
pelvis and so on up the body, the space-minimizing cou
ples take two small steps for every beat and wave their
joined together hands sparingly, so as not to take any
couples out.
The four-man, black-dad Brazilian band is very
authentic. They sing in Portuguese and take siestas
between most songs, allowing sweaty couples a chance
to refresh themselves with one of the many revenue-gen
erating bar drinks.
Since there is no cover charge, the hotel depends on
the waitress' success in soliciting drink orders. "Can I get
you a drink?" asks the versatile waitress, in either a flir
tatious tone or a slightly threatening one, depending on
the client. Many people have wanted to say, "I'll just have
water," but none have tried it to date.
"Do you think she's a paid worker?" a man asks his

neighbor, as he watches a tall, spry, blond woman dance
with a catatonic, white-haired man balancing on his toes
to reach her navel.
"Maybe. Do you think he's a married man?" replies
his friend, in a whisper.
Muted speculations of debauchery are rife, yet no
overt accusations are flung.
Lambada, the dance which originated on the north
east coast of Brazil, hit America in 1989, reached its peak
in popularity in mid-1990, then tapered off rapidly. Pro
moters were thus stuck with full warehouses of Lambada
videos, posters, towels, hormone-scented deodorant,
blow-up plastic dance partners, etc.
The Hyatt Rickey's, once a trendsetter among El
Camino's hotels, has featured the dance for two years.
Although Lambada is now basically obsolete in
America, Hyatt Rickey's has not altered its program to
give in to shifting dance trends. Saturday night at the
Hyatt is still the place for all those seeking a sultry
evening spent stuffing onto a small, square dance floor.
Taking part of this dynamic dance experience can
only be compared to a ride on a crowded European bus,
in which moving horizontally is impossible, and getting
stuck in close proximity under a neighbor's sweaty
armpit is par for the course.
