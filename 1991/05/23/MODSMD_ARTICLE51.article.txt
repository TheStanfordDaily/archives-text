Postmodern
fragments ot
Shakespeare
"Hamlet Machine" was pre
sented last weekend by Babak
Ebrahimian, a doctoral candi
date in the Drama Department
It had all of the trappings of tradi
tional avant-garde theater: black cos
tumes, people moving in slow motion,
lines repeated ad nauseum, nudity, vio
lent screen images — it almost made
me think I was James Spader in a
movie-adaptation of a Brett Easton
Ellis novel.
'Hamlet Machin e' bar
raged the audience
with a set of disturbing,
although slow-moving,
images that were effec
tive, but frequently dis
juncted.
Loosely based on William Shake
speare's text, "Hamlet Machine" was
written 20 years ago by East German
playwright Heiner Mtiller. The text
itself is a synthetic fragment of only
five pages and offers nearly infinite
room for interpretation, having been
put on in as short a time as five min
utes, and as long as three-and-a-half
hours. Mtiller himself included it as
the intermission in his own produc
tion of "Hamlet."
The piece was presented sue times
over a three-day period, May 19-21, by
Babak Ebrahimian, a doctoral candi
date in the Drama Department.
Choosing to stage the performance in
a little over an hour, with a small
ensemble cast, Ebrahimian barraged
the audience with a set of disturbing,
although slow-moving images, that
were effective, but frequently dis
juncted.
One of the most effective tech
niques used by Ebrahimian was
accomplished in the seating of the
audience: several large, male guards
dressed entirely in black shouted
"Move" to the audience and silently
ushered them into the theater — creat

ing an ambience somewhere between a
Pol Pot speech and an episode of
"Sprockets."
Hoping to maintain the spirit of the
piece, which he described as "a very
tender piece, a very aesthetic piece,"
Ebrahimian concentrated on the eerie
visual images with which he accosted
the audience. Stressing the importance
of the piece as a performance,
Ebrahimian claimed "I could have pre
sented Neil Simon in the same aesthet
ics."
The effects, however, such as nudity
and two men kissing, were not, he
insists, intended simply as "shock
value."
Ebrahimian chose to present
MQller not only because of his deep
admiration for the playwright, but also
because he felt his own experiences
paralleled those of Miiller. As an Ira
nian who lived through the deposition
of the Shah, Ebrahimian felt his own
experiences were also echoed in the
play. "He went through war, I went
through revolution," he explained.
Unable to get permission to use
either the Nitery or the Little Theater
for the event, Ebrahimian was forced
to present the piece in room 205 of the
department — a room which holds
about 40 people. Due to these con
straints, between 50 and 60 people
were turned away from each perfor
mance.
Frustrated with having to turn away
so many people, including Stanford
classes who were studying Mtiller's
text, Ebrahimian complained that he
"didn't get much support from the
department."
With the exception of costumes and
wooden platforms, the department did
not supply the production with any
thing, Ebrahimian said. Furthermore,
the department only permitted him to
use the small, brown room for three
days and forced him to take down the
set each night.
When asked why more experimen
tal theater does not exist at Stanford,
Ebrahimian commented that Stanford
is "a highly conservative campus, intel
lectually as well as artistically."
Ebrahimian also cited a lack of fund
ing of the department as a problem,
having had to get money from the
ASSU and the Comparative Literature
departments just to put out flyers. He
was particularly worried that the
upcoming budget cuts will hit the
department hard, "contributing fur
ther to 'the death of theater.' "
