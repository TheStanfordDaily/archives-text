# Future of AIRport is yet to be decided

As Academic Information
Resources prepares to undergo
major restructuring and dissolu
tion, the first change students will
notice will likely involve AIRport
AIRport is the large Macintosh
computer cluster located on the
second floor of Tresidder Union,
and AIR administrators are
unsure how it will be affected by
the restructuring.
The two potabilities men
tioned by AIR Director Ralph
Gorin are mergir control of AIR
port with the Macintosh computer
cluster in Meyer Library under
Libraries and Information
Resources and allowing residen
tial computing to take control of
AIRport.
The Meyer computer cluster is
currently under Libraries and
Information Resources, and resi
dential computing is responsible
for the dormitory computer clus
ters throughout campus.
Jeff Merriman, director of resi
dential computing, said he was
told before the AIR restructuring
began to conduct a cost-benefit
analysis of residential computing
taking control of AlRport.
The study was originally due to
be completed mid-summer, but
Merriman said he "was encour
aged" to have it finished in two
weeks.
"It may not be as detailed as it
could have been, but we will be
able to do a good, accurate job,"
Merriman said.
Gorin said AlRport will likely
become part of residential com

puting if the study shows that sav.
ings could be found in the merger
but emphasized that "a decision
has not yet been made.
"It is still very much up in the
air whether AlRport will become
part of residential computing," h e
added.
Merriman declined to predict
the results of the study. "It could
be that we won't be able to find
substantial savings. I am really
not sure," he said.
"We basically want to look at
student involvement in the
operation of AlRport and consider
shifting responsibility to the stu
dents," Merriman said.
Both Gorin and Merriman
emphasized that AlRport will con
tinue to be fully supported by the
University.
"Everything is happening so
suddenly that there is still a lot of
confusion," Merriman said. "A lot
of decisions will have to be made
on a lot of different levels."
