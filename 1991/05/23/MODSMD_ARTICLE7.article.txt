# Junior writes college survival guide
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
To know Greg Gottesman is to
know his stories.
The Stanford junior possesses a
seemingly endless supply of anec
dotes, and he recounts each one with
relish, milking each line for all it's
worth.
So perhaps it isn't surprising that,
at 21, Gottesman has already pub
lished his first book — a college sur
vival guide aimed at helping others
avoid the mishaps that befell him dur
ing his freshman year at Stanford.
And Gottesman, who will be sign
ing copies of "College Survival" at the
Bookstore at 3 p.m. today, said these
misfortunes, while upsetting or even
devastating at the time, are also
exactly what qualified him to write

about the subject.
"I'm just a very, very typical stu
dent who made very, very typical mis
takes," Gottesman said. "And that's
what makes me a very, very good per
son to write this book."
Gottesman's mistakes will ring
familiar to most college students: hav
ing his bike stolen, ending up with
pink underwear after failing to sepa
rate colored clothing in his laundry
and choosing classes by title instead of
by professor.
But typical is not a word most peo
ple would use to describe Gottesman.
Well-spoken and personable, this
straight-A student is also an accom
plished tennis player.
Gottesman insists that his accom
plishments haven't gone to his head,
because attending Stanford keeps him
— as well as everyone else here —

humble.
"Going to Stanford teaches you
that there are much more extraordi
nary people doing much more
extraordinary things than you are,"
Gottesman commented. "You always
feel a little humbled when you hear
about what your peers are doing."
The young author is also quick to
point out that money was not his
objective in writing the book. In fact.
Gottesman said, profits from the book
will not even approach the cost of a
Stanford education.
Gottesman added that he would
even have paid his publisher, Simon
and Schuster, $5,000 to publish it.
"It's just very exciting to have a piece
of work really come to something, to
have a tangible product."


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
Junior Greg Gottesman will be signing copies of his college survival guide at the Stanford Bookstore today at 3 p.m.
Gottesman noted that while there are
books about which colleges are the best and
how to get into them, there were no books
by students on surviving. "So I decided to
write one after freshman year," he said.
Gottesman got his "College Survival"
published without an agent — a feat few
authors have duplicated.
"Maybe it was because I was so naive,
being a college student," Gottesman began.
"I just sent sample chapters directly to
these two huge publishing companies —
and one of them picked it up."
The 235-page book, already in its second
printing, is comprised of both level-headed
advice and amusing anecdotes — not just
from Gottesman, but from students at
more than 75 colleges nationwide.
"The contributors are all friends of
friends of friends," said Gottesman. "And
their stories are what make the book.
They're really funny and they're just about
people who messed up and learned from it."

'I'm just a very, very typical
student who made very,
very typical mistakes. And
that's what makes me a
very, very good person to
write this book.'

Since the book is geared mainly toward
college freshmen and high school seniors,
"college seniors may look at it and say, 'well
that's common sense,' " said Gottesman.
"But it's not common sense when you're a
freshman."
Gottesman collected anecdotes from stu
dents at different universities, but Stan
ford's influence is particularly strong in his
book.
"In a lot of ways, it's a Stanford book,"
said Gottesman. "Since everyone here rides
bicycles, I wrote an entire chapter on
them."
And the best advice in the book? "Be
yourself, unless no one else can stand you,"
Gottesman said.
