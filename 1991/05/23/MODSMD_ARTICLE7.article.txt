# Junior writes college survival guide
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
To know Greg Gottesman is to
know his stories.
The Stanford junior possesses a
seemingly endless supply of anec
dotes, and he recounts each one with
relish, milking each line for all it's
worth.
So perhaps it isn't surprising that,
at 21, Gottesman has already pub
lished his first book — a college sur
vival guide aimed at helping others
avoid the mishaps that befell him dur
ing his freshman year at Stanford.
And Gottesman, who will be sign
ing copies of "College Survival" at the
Bookstore at 3 p.m. today, said these
misfortunes, while upsetting or even
devastating at the time, are also
exactly what qualified him to write

about the subject.
"I'm just a very, very typical stu
dent who made very, very typical mis
takes," Gottesman said. "And that's
what makes me a very, very good per
son to write this book."
Gottesman's mistakes will ring
familiar to most college students: hav
ing his bike stolen, ending up with
pink underwear after failing to sepa
rate colored clothing in his laundry
and choosing classes by title instead of
by professor.
But typical is not a word most peo
ple would use to describe Gottesman.
Well-spoken and personable, this
straight-A student is also an accom
plished tennis player.
Gottesman insists that his accom
plishments haven't gone to his head,
because attending Stanford keeps him
— as well as everyone else here —

humble.
"Going to Stanford teaches you
that there are much more extraordi
nary people doing much more
extraordinary things than you are,"
Gottesman commented. "You always
feel a little humbled when you hear
about what your peers are doing."
The young author is also quick to
point out that money was not his
objective in writing the book. In fact.
Gottesman said, profits from the book
will not even approach the cost of a
Stanford education.
Gottesman added that he would
even have paid his publisher, Simon
and Schuster, $5,000 to publish it.
"It's just very exciting to have a piece
of work really come to something, to
have a tangible product."
