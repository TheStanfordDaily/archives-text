# Greek system's rally does not change University plans for house
##

Despite yesterday's large turnout at a
rally in support of a Greek residential
lodge, University administrators said the
Theta Delta Chi house will most likely
become a self-operative, as they have
planned.
Row Director Jack Chin said the show
of unity by the Greek system "doesn't
make a difference because the time frame
is so short" for considering the Greek
lodge proposal for next year.

"What they're proposing is something
we would like to look at, but not until
next year. . . . There needs to be time to
answer questions that may arise from
such a proposal."
The Theta Delt house, newly given up
by the fraternity, will fill up this fall with
students who are on the waiting list for
housing. A resident assistant has already
been named. The residents will hire their
own cook and the University will oversee
cleaning.
Approximately 350 students — mem
bers of the Greek system and others —

showed up at the rally yesterday after
noon in the Old Union Courtyard. The
rally was punctuated with chants of "We
want justice!"
"I'm hoping that 1 the administration]
was listening," said Alyssa Solomon, a
junior who attended the rally.
Members of both the Interfraternity
and the Intersorority councils stressed
the need for a Greek clubhouse to hold
meetings. The fraternities and sororities
are looking to the Theta Delt house as the
"one spot that [they] could call home,"
said Erik Jorgensen, the IFC president.

"We are the largest organization on
this campus and ... we deserve to be
treated with as much respect as any other
student group," Jorgensen said.
The Greek lodge proposal, which origi
nated from the IFC, provides a guaran
teed meeting place for fraternities and
sororities at the Theta Delt house, in
addition to having regular programming
for the residents.
But Diana Conklin, acting associate
dean of Student Affairs, said the house
will become a self-op in the fall, and "to
have it be anything other than a self-op is

to change the program of the house, and
that requires a lengthy process."
Jorgensen also noted that although the
University has appointed a non-Greek RA
for the house, it has not yet appointed
students to be in charge of programming
in the house.
"We have a bunch of dynamic leaders,"
said Jorgensen. "We'll provide a group of
eight strong leaders and let [the Univer
sity] decide who would be the best from
that pool of prospective officers."
