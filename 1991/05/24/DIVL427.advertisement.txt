Many Have Wondered: What Is Going On!
We opened the eclectic company last November to sell tree ornaments and home decor for the
holiday season. Many, many of you responded enthusiastically to our products and business
atmosphere.
We discussed our future plans with hundred of customers and got a very encouraging response.
These plans Included a ma|or remodel which required closing our business, for what we hoped
was a 45 day period. The reality of designers, architects, contractors, and government agencies
required almost 5 months.
We set out to do two things:
1. create a european-style coffee house with lots of space (about 3700 sq. ft.. plus outdoor
seating) for Informal eating &. drinking (espresso, cappuccino, speciality coffees, tea, other
beverages, sandwiches, salads, desserts, etc.) and people-watching (In the subtle euro
manner, of course).
2. blend an eclectic mixture of coffee house, home accessories, art antique, gift Items,
coffee beans accessories, and paperback books magazines, since these things
seem to "go together" so well. We haven't seen, but like the idea of, a blend this broad.
We re-open on Friday, May 24. so come In to look us over. Our service edges may not be well
smoothed In the first few weeks, and much of our merchandise Inventory hasn't yet arrived, but
we do want your comments on how to meet your needs with this new business Idea.
We hope to see you soon (and we need your patronage, too!) If you bring in the logo section
below, we will reduce your food/beverage bill by 15%.
