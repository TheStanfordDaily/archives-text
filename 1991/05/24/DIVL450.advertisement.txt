WE'LL ERASE YOUR
COLLEGE LOAN.
If you're stuck with a student loan that's
not in default, the Army might pay it off.
If you qualify, we'll reduce your debt
by 73 for each year you serve as a
soldier, so after just 3 years you'll
have a clean slate.
You'll also have training in a
choice of skills and enough
self-assurance to last you
the rest of your life.
