Military-Sponsored Research at Stanford
WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
.. .a public discussion long overdue!!
Should Stanford restructure its policies and priorities regarding mili
tary-sponsored researchâ€”given the budget crisis stemming from
Stanford's relationship to the Office of Naval Research?
Are faculty/student research agendas effectively limited by
federal priorities? If so, how? -
Are we satisfied with the status quo?
What are the elements of a university research agenda responsive
to civilian and environmental needs as well as military ones?
Panelists include:
Robert L. Byer, Dean of Research, Stanford University
Michael Closson, Executive Director, Center for Economic Conversion
Lee Halterman, Sr. Legal Counsel to Congressman Ron Dellums
