# Allies expensive in cost battle
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Stanford administrators dis
closed yesterday the cost of the
platoon of outside accountants
and lawyers it has enlisted to fight
the University's indirect-cost bat
tle — roughly $600,000 a month.
"None of this comes cheap,"
said University Counsel Debra
Zumwalt. "But if you want to con
tinue to do government business,
you have to pay the cost. A lot of
this is stuff we really don't have
much choice on."
For the past several months,
bills from Arthur Andersen and
Co., a Big Six firm hired to
"revamp" the University's
accounting system, have been
running close to $500,000, accord
ing to University General Counsel
John Schwartz.
"The big hit has been for the
accounting," he said. "The legal
work has been relatively limited."
The University is retaining the
services of two Washington, D.C.-
based law firms, Arnold & Porter
and Wunder, Ryan & Cannon.

James Fitzpatrick of Arnold &
Porter represented the University
during its mid-March appearance
before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.
Outside legal fees have cost the
University about $100,000 a
month for the last several
months, Zumwalt said. She indi
cated that expenses had been
somewhat higher during the
period preceding Dingell's hearing
on Stanford's indirect-cost prac
tices.
"Given the unresolved issues
we have no choice but to get help
from the very best to meet our
obligations," said Larry Horton,
associate vice president for public
affairs. "There's not a frivolous
dollar in there."
About 20 Arthur Andersen
employees are providing assis
tance on several fronts, Zumwalt
said. Their efforts include:
• Helping the University pre
pare new cost studies that justify
