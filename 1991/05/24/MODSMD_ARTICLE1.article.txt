# Allies expensive in cost battle
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Stanford administrators dis
closed yesterday the cost of the
platoon of outside accountants
and lawyers it has enlisted to fight
the University's indirect-cost bat
tle — roughly $600,000 a month.
"None of this comes cheap,"
said University Counsel Debra
Zumwalt. "But if you want to con
tinue to do government business,
you have to pay the cost. A lot of
this is stuff we really don't have
much choice on."
For the past several months,
bills from Arthur Andersen and
Co., a Big Six firm hired to
"revamp" the University's
accounting system, have been
running close to $500,000, accord
ing to University General Counsel
John Schwartz.
"The big hit has been for the
accounting," he said. "The legal
work has been relatively limited."
The University is retaining the
services of two Washington, D.C.-
based law firms, Arnold & Porter
and Wunder, Ryan & Cannon.

James Fitzpatrick of Arnold &
Porter represented the University
during its mid-March appearance
before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.
Outside legal fees have cost the
University about $100,000 a
month for the last several
months, Zumwalt said. She indi
cated that expenses had been
somewhat higher during the
period preceding Dingell's hearing
on Stanford's indirect-cost prac
tices.
"Given the unresolved issues
we have no choice but to get help
from the very best to meet our
obligations," said Larry Horton,
associate vice president for public
affairs. "There's not a frivolous
dollar in there."
About 20 Arthur Andersen
employees are providing assis
tance on several fronts, Zumwalt
said. Their efforts include:
• Helping the University pre
pare new cost studies that justify
higher levels of reimbursements
from the government. Last
month, the Navy slashed the Uni
versity's 1990-91 indirect-cost
rate from a proposed 78 percent to
55.5 percent — a $28 million dif
ference. Stanford was unable to
justify the level of recovery it said
it was entitled to, according to
Navy negotiators. The two parties
will look at the rate again before
the books are closed on this year.
• Auditing and reviewing Stan
ford's cost claims from past years.
Navy regulator Paul Biddle has
alleged that Stanford overcharged
the government by $200 million
during the last decade.
• Implementing new account
ing procedures that allow admin
istrators to track individual
expenses that enter the Univer
sity's accounting system. Many of

The government may
pay some of the
costs.

the embarrassing charges that
have surfaced, such as those for
flowers and antiques at Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
residence, were the result of a
"disconnect" in the accounting
system, administrators say.
Zumwalt said yesterday that
she expected Arthur Andersen
employees to be working for the
University for "a considerable
period of time" — at least until
the end of the calendar year. But
the workload may tail off much
sooner than that, she said.
It's possible that the govern
ment will absorb some of the
accounting costs being incurred,
Zumwalt said. That matter is sub
ject to negotiation between Stan
ford and the Navy.
