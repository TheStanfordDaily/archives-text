# House endorses freeze on Mideast arms sales
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A House com
mittee yesterday endorsed an indefinite
moratorium on virtually all U.S. arms sales
to the Middle East amid indications that
President Bush's new weapons-control
package will fall well short of such a step.
The Foreign Affairs Committee adopted
the stringent controls on a voice vote as
part of an emerging foreign aid bill for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
The chairman, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-
Fla., said the move was intended "to chal
lenge ourselves and the international com
munity" to avoid returning to arms busi
ness as usual in the region, which has been
the No. 1 destination for international
weapons sales over the last decade.
At the same time, however, Secretary of
State James Baker 111 signaled that Bush's
arms-control plan, which sources said will
be announced Tuesday, will be less far
reaching and comprehensive on conven
tional weapons than on nuclear, chemical
and biological arms.
Baker declined to detail the proposal, but
administration sources said it would
include new efforts to conclude a chemical
weapons ban, a push to strengthen the cur
rent ban on biological weapons, a ban on
ballistic missiles of more than 90 miles in
range and a ban on production of weapons
grade nuclear material in the Middle East
as a first step toward a nuclear-free zone.
In the area of conventional weapons —
tanks, fighter planes, missiles and rockets,
attack helicopters and the like — Bush's
plan will call only for the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council to
produce a plan of restraint. Those five
countries — the United States, China, the
Soviet Union, Britain and France — are the

leading sellers of conventional weapons.
On Wednesday, Baker forewarned Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., that he likely would be
disappointed by the conventional-arms por
tion of Bush's package. Obey and a group of
House Democrats have been seeking a uni
lateral moratorium on U.S. arms sales to
the region.
And when Baker testified yesterday
before the Senate Appropriations subcom
mittee on foreign aid, the chairman, Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., observed that "a new
arms race is being born even before the
destruction of the Gulf War is repaired. ... If
that happens, we may as well start plan
ning for Gulf War II a few years from now,
because all the instabilities will remain."
Leahy pointed to reports that Saddam
Hussein's army is not as seriously damaged
as at first indicated, and that Baghdad
already is clandestinely seeking to rearm
itself. At the same time Turkey, Egypt and
Syria are seeking new weaponry, he noted.
The bill adopted by the House panel was
seen as largely symbolic because it was
attached to a foreign aid measure given lit
tle chance of ever being enacted into law.
But the gesture was one of a growing list
of indications that many lawmakers believe
the administration is not paying enough
attention to the spread of weapons, espe
cially conventional arms, in the Middle
East.
A similar moratorium has been proposed
by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and others. And a bipartisan
group of senators has written President
Bush asking him to take the lead in forging
a multilateral moratorium on Mideast arms
sales.
