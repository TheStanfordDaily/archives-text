# Supreme Court tightens abortion legislation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A deeply
divided Supreme Court said yesterday
that federally subsidized family plan
ning clinics can be barred from dis
cussing abortion with pregnant
women or from telling them where to
get one.
By a 5-4 vote, the court said a ban
contained in regulations issued by the
administration in 1988 does
notf violate free-speech rights or a
woman's right to end her pregnancy.
The ruling could affect millions of
low-income women served by 4,000
clinics that receive federal money.

Justice David Souter, the court's
newest member, cast the tie-breaking
vote to uphold the ban. His vote under
scored the pivotal role he will play
when the court is next asked to over
turn its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.
Yesterday's decision in no direct
way altered the Roe vs. Wade ruling.
But Harry Blackmun, author of the
1973 decision, accused the court of
depriving low-income women of their
abortion right.
"While technically leaving intact
the fundamental right protected by

Roe vs. Wade," he said, the court had
made the right worthless. "This is a
course nearly as noxious as overruling
Roe directly, for if a right is found to be
unenforceable, even against flagrant
attempts by government to circum
vent it, then it ceases to be a right at
all."
But Chief ice William-Rehn- «
quist, writing fpr the court's majority, 4
said the cditipiy with the
system of family planning clinics
Congress created 21 years ago.
"Congress' refusal to fund abortion
counseling and advocacy leaves a preg

nant woman with the same choices as
if the government had chosen not to
fund family planning services at all,"
he said.
Rehnquist was joined by Souter and
Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia
and Anthony Kennedy.
Faye Wattleton, president of
ParwthocKi Federation of
MAmeiimrsaid4ter organisation s net
work of clinics would continue to coun
sel on abortion and added that "we
don't expect to give up this money
because we expect Congress to over
turn" the decision.
