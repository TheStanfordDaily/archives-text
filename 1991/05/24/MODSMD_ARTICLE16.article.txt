## An old Greek myth 
### 
Anti-fraternity bias
hardly to blame for
rejection of lodge

WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S
refusal to consider a pro
posal recommending a
lodge for fraternities and sorori
ties, many supporters of the idea
are fomenting a new twist on an
old Greek myth.
Whenever things don't go the
way the Greeks want them to,
some members contend Stanford
has an anti-fraternity agenda. And
although this claim, like most
myths, has some truth to it, there
are many times when it is blatantly
false.
Such is the case with the Greek
lodge.
When the Theta Delta Chi fra
ternity decided to relinquish its
house, their hope was that it would
go to another fraternity that could
consistently fulfill their pledge
quota. But since the University has
stuck to a policy of no new frater
nity housing, the house is going to
be used for students currently on
the waiting list for housing, and
next year it will be included in the
Draw.
However, during the process of
deciding what to do with the house,
the Interfraternity Council offered
a plan for turning it into a "Greek
residential lodge," sort of a Greek
theme house.
The proposal would enable fra
ternities and sororities to have a
guaranteed meeting place at the
Theta Delt house, in addition to
regular programming for students.
The house would be open to all stu
dents, regardless of their affiliation
with a Greek organization.
As goofy as it might sound, this
idea is actually worth pursuing.
The proposal marks a compromise

that would benefit all the Greek
organizations, as well as the Uni
versity.
But when Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Diana Conklin refused
to hear the proposal, its propo
nents cried foul. The IFC held a
rally of 350 on Wednesday, asking
for justice.
"We deserve to be treated with
as much respect as any other stu
dent group," said IFC President
Erik Jorgensen.
Obviously. But what makes the
group think that it deserves special
consideration?
The University has a January
deadline for proposals on new
focus and theme houses. At this
late date, no other group could sub
mit an idea for immediate consid
eration.
And while no one could have
guessed that the Theta Delt house
would be opening up, IFC and
Intersorority Council members
could have suggested that the Uni
versity designate another house to
serve as a lodge. For the IFC pro
posal to be considered so late after
the deadline would be unfair to
others interested in creating spe
cialized housing.
As Conklin noted, "To have [the
Theta Delt house] be anything
other than a self-op is to change
the program of the house, and that
requires a lengthy process."
Is it unfortunate that the Uni
versity didn't fully consider the
IFC proposal? Yes. Was it a camel's
back-breaking straw, as some
Greeks would claim? Not on your
life. Administrators have only said
the proposal has come too late this
year. The IFC can always reapply
next year.
Rather than focusing on some
perceived slight or holding rallies
that won't change anyone's opin
ion, the Greek community would
be better off devoting its energy to
making its proposal as compelling
as possible.
