The way the emperor walks through the
imperial courtyard determines the
morality of the nation.
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE discussion
of drugs at Stanford away from the
specifics of the Stuart Reges case and
toward the issue of drugs in general, not
just illegal drugs such as marijuana and
MDA, but also those drugs that would
surely be outlawed today were it not for
a huge population addicted to them and
a huge industry dependent on selling
them. I refer, of course, to alcohol and
nicotine.
A quarter of a century ago, many of
us liberals were pleased when the Uni
versity decided to permit alcohol in cam
pus residences and eating clubs. Yet
today, that liberation from puritanical
restrictions somehow seems hollow.
How many Stanford alumni have
experienced personal tragedies — losing
their jobs or their marriages or even
their lives — because of the effects of
booze? And that number increases dra
matically if you count those who have
endured lackluster careers, mediocre
relationships and impaired heart and
liver functions due to excessive alcohol
usage. And don't forget those individuals
mangled for life because of drunken
drivers.
I was pleased when a recent Univer
sity health survey of students indicated
that in just four years, the number of
sexually active students — most of them
with one partner — has increased by 10
percent, while the number of students
consuming alcoholic beverages has
declined by 10 percent. Probably many
newspapers picked up on this titillating
bit of gossip about the goings-on at the
Farm because it made an eye-catching
headline, but I was intrigued for two
other reasons.
First, it does highlight the need for a
vigorous campaign to encourage safe sex
practices. And second, it may suggest the

beginning of a healthy trend in the
entire country: more wholesome sex and
fewer alcohol-induced problems.
Perhaps as Stanford goes, so go other
elite universities. Let's hope that's also
true with regard to smoking. In the cir
cles I travel, nicotine usage has virtually
disappeared — as have lung cancer and
emphysema.
With so much negative publicity about
political correctness, the indirect-cost
controversy and the perception of exces
sive alcohol at University affairs — in
Greek houses or at faculty gatherings —
here's a splendid opportunity to project a
very different image to the world.
With this in mind, envision an
unusual press release:
Stanford University announces a new
drug policy. While it accepts the fact that
nicotine and alcohol are legal sub
stances, it is doing everything it can to
discourage their use. Thus, these sub
stances cannot be sold anywhere on cam
pus, nor can they be used in interior pub
lic spaces.
However, the usage of these sub
stances in public spaces is not covered by
University policy since Stanford is not
about to invade areas of personal privacy
in a misguided attempt to enforce a pro
hibition of alcohol, nicotine or any other
drug. In embarking on this enterprise,
Stanford asks other universities, as well
as the federal government, to consider a
similar policy.
On reading the above, did you snicker
at the thought of sober members of
Congress or of state functions without
alcohol? Did you conclude that I am out
of touch with reality? Will you discount
anything else I say as the ravings of a
neo-prohibitionist? Such reactions would
say more about how the emperor walks
across the courtyard than about who I
am.
A year ago, I talked to an acquain
tance whose wife had announced a
divorce was imminent because of his

drinking problem. 1 remarked that giving
up alcohol "was no big deal." 1 might as
well have claimed it's not a big deal to
cut off both arms and both legs. For him,
the contemplation of "a life without ever
again enjoying a glass of wine with din
ner or to toast a wedding anniversary"
was unthinkable.
Of course, he may not have to worry
about the anniversary toast because his
wife has been attending Alanon, a sup
port group for the families of alcoholics.
She refuses to take on the role of an
"understanding" wife who accepts the
fact that her husband can promise not to
drink anymore, but then slips because
"in Mexico they had this special beer.
And today, when the pizza parlor had a
grand opening, what else could I do?"
I suppose entertaining an eminent
scholar from Paris would require that an
exception be made to the policy "I could
hardly ask whether my guest wanted
orange or cranberry juice before lunch! I
wouldn't want my sophisticated compan
ion to write me off as a provincial hay
seed."
But then I recall a recent encounter
with a friend I've known for 18 years. He
stepped out of the Faculty Club with
care, but when we started talking, I real
ized he wasn 't all there. His jovial face
was as bright as ever, but his speech was
somewhat slurred, and his mind seemed
to wander.
Sometimes his eyes were actually in
focus. Sometimes. How long before his
liver or his heart or his wife or his
department head gives him the bad
news? "Sir, you have a drinking prob
lem." The sadness I feel is unbearable.
I hesitated to narrate this incident,
but then I realized he wouldn't remem
ber it anyway. If I have to choose
between an incredible sadness about my
old friend and a fear that a colleague
from the continent might smile at my
hayseed ways, I opt for the condescend
ing smile. I can't handle a fine mind

destroying itself with self-deceptions and
excuses.
The rationalizations of the addict are
boring, but what is fascinating is the
nation's inability to think straight about
drugs. I happen to agree with Reges on
one point: Some of the recreational
drugs should be legalized. I say this,
however, not because I want to encour
age their use, but because I'd like to
discourage their use. Does this strike you
as odd?
Ask yourself why criminal elements
are so vigorous in promoting drugs. They
do it because they make so much money
which is related to the drugs' illegality. If
the nation were to legalize drugs, the
immense profits would diminish, and the
pushers would cease to push. The best
way to wage the war on drugs is to
destroy the profit in it.
Further, if all drug advertising — of
the new legal drugs, as well the old ones,
alcohol and nicotine — is banned and if
Stanford demonstrates that it's "no big
deal" to abstain from all drugs, old and
new, then the action moves to where it
should have been all along: not in a legis
lature or courtroom or prison, but in the
courtyard in front of Memorial Church.
University President Donald Kennedy
may not be the emperor of China, but
when he strolls across the courtyard
with a colleague from Paris and men
tions the excellent cranberry juice the
Faculty Club serves, the University gets
the message, the mores change and the
morality of the nation is uplifted.
