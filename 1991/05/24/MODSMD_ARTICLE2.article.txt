# New opinion may spark legal clash
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Navy regulator Paul Biddle has another
weapon in his arsenal.
Lawyers from the Office of Naval Research
have issued a legal opinion stating that the
agency may not have to abide by several of the
accounting agreements it allowed Stanford to
use in the 1980s to calculate indirect-cost reim
bursements.
A copy of the opinion was made available to
The Daily by congressional investigators late
yesterday afternoon.
Biddle has alleged that the University used
dozens of these agreements, known as memo
randa of understanding, to overcharge the gov
ernment by $200 million during the last
decade. Last month, the Navy discontinued use
of all but one of these agreements, but its deci-
sion did not affect prior years.
The new legal opinion, written
by Navy Counsel Sophie Krasik,
appears to bolster Biddle and fed
eral auditors in their efforts to
force Stanford to return money
from past years â€” and may spark
a legal showdown between the
Navy and the University.
"I believe (the opinion) pro
vides great encouragement to
government to proceed aggres
sively in returning substantial
reimbursements to the federal
treasury," Biddle said in a brief
interview last night.
But the Navy opinion stands in
stark contrast to a legal opinion
obtained bv Stanford in late Jan

uary. Lawyers from Arnold &
Porter, which is representing the
University, argue that the memo
randa of understanding are valid,
binding agreements in past years
regardless of what the Navy
thinks of them now.
"As it stands right now, those
agreements are in effect," Univer
sity Counsel Debra Zumwalt said
yesterday.
Were the Navy to terminate
the applicability of the agree
ments to past years, they would
have to reimburse Stanford for
damages, Zumwalt said.
According to the Navy, individ
ual memoranda of understanding
may be terminated if they are
inconsistent with provisions out
lined in federal rules or if the gov
ernment representative who
signed the agreement "acted out
side of his authority."

If the Navy is aggres
sive, it could collect
'even more than $200
million.' If not, 'it
could be nothing.'

When the Navy canceled its
agreements with Stanford last
month, it claimed that some of
the agreements did not comply
with Circular A-21, the govern
ment's regulations affecting
research universities.
"Certain MOUs were canceled
because they were not compliant
with the cost principles in . . . Cir
cular A-21," Navy negotiator
Michael Kuc wrote in May 2 letter
to Stanford's chief financial offi

cer, William Massy.
A copy of the letter was
obtained by The Daily.
According to Biddle, the
amount of money the government
will collect from Stanford depends
upon how doggedly the Navy pur
sues the matter.
If the Navy is aggressive, Bid
die said, he believes it could col
lect "even more than $200 mil
lion." If not, "it could be noth
ing," he said.
The vast majority of the
roughly 100 agreements between
Stanford and the Navy were
signed by Biddle's predecessors.
Biddle arrived as the Office of
Naval Research's resident repre
sentative at Stanford in October
1988.
His allegations of massive
overpayment became public last
fall.
