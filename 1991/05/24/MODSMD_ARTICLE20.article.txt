## Warning: serious column 
### 
WE ADMIT IT - WE TOO HAVE
an agenda. Our columns have
not been written as mindless,
whimsical entertainment. In each week's
column, we have tried to convey some
particular message to this campus.
For close to 15 weeks, we have had
the bully pulpit from which to make our
ideological speeches. We could have
shouted, assailing the irrational, obnox
ious and criminal on this campus.
We realized early on, however, that
this form of preaching only reaches the
ears of the faithful. Ideological speeches
don't change minds; they only give fol
lowers a rallying cry and words to carry
from argument to argument.
We do not see the column as a one
way expression. It should be a dialogue.
With it, we have always tried to start dis
cussion. The column has been our end of
the conversation. We have wanted to
reach both those who would agree and
those who would not. We have wanted to
have an impact on as many people as
possible, regardless of their position.
In order to do this effectively, we have
had to be aware of how our medium
would affect our message. By medium we
mean both the subject and the style of
the column. We have made our choices of
content and style in order to maximize
the impact of the column. Frequently,
the best subject and the best style were
incompatible, (e.g., We were too angered
by the ASSU to discuss it humorously,
without the column sounding nasty.)
In order to form criteria for these
decisions, we have had to observe, dis
cuss and analyze our audience — the

Stanford community. We have attempted
to anticipate our readers' responses, con
stantly assessing which groups we could
reach and which are beyond hope. In the
end, we decided to write to any and all
students that could be convinced by a
rational argument, could laugh at them
selves and could allow themselves to
care.
We accept full responsibility for the
results of our choices and the reaction of
every member of our audience. If any of
our columns alienated anyone we wanted
to reach, we betrayed our message. Any
column that did not invite discussion
violated our responsibility to contribute
to the process of education.
The columns were not written as
pieces of art. They were attempts at com
munication — not simply expression.
Columns do not exist in a vacuum, indif
ferent to the audience. The audience
reaction is as much our creation as the
column.
We all must be held accountable for
the effects of what we say and how we
say it. All choices of style and content
have ramifications. If you alienate any
part of your audience, you have discour
aged dialogue. If this is your purpose, be
honest about it.
If, however, you are trying to commu
nicate, do not point the finger at the
receiver if your efforts fail. Unless you
have done all you can to present your
message as effectively as possible, you
have betrayed it, your intentions and the
integrity of communication in general.
Maybe this explains the results of the
past campus election and the national

response to multiculturalism. We may be
witnessing a response to an ineffectively
presented message.
This is by no means a criticism of the
message. In their ideological blindness,
the most vocal messengers have severed
the bonds that made dialogue possible.
They put all of the responsibility on their
audience, continuing to offend and alien
ate. This has unfortunately damaged
this campus' intellectual and social envi
ronment.
The People's Platform and those they
represent should view the results of this
year's election as a rejection of their
method, and not their message. Now is
the time to establish new bonds and
begin new dialogues.
Students First and those they repre
sent should not take the election results
as license to wipe away the changes of
the last four years. They have been
empowered to give the message a differ
ent medium. Although they have the
ability to seek political revenge, to do so
would be foolish and destructive.
It may be ridiculously idealistic to
assume that partisan differences can and
will fade away. But, if we can't interact
with each other on either a human or
rational level, why are we even here?

Kofi and Andy are now accepting appli
cations to fill out their COP slate.
