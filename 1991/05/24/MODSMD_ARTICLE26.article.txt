# Freshman blues allayed by oily apologies and promiscuous sis
## 
### 
It was just my luck. Coming to Stan
ford was intimidating for me. It
seemed like everyone else started with
246 units and was just three CIV classes
away from graduating. I just tried to keep
in mind that if I had gone anywhere else I
would have received credit for the three I
scored on the Advanced Placement Pen
manship Exam.
My disillusionment really started,
however, on the van ride from the airport,
when I found out my acceptance letter
wasn't the only one Dean Jean had writ
ten a note on. It was, though, the only one
that read "Fantastic, Future Curve Flub
ber!"
I'll always remember how neat it was
to see everyone greeted by her first name
when we entered Otero. Unfortunately,
none of the resident assistants recognized
me from my senior-year picture. Never
can get started on that Freshman 15 too
early, eh?
The sad 'story continued a few days
later. I was standing at the map that has
everyone's picture attached to her geo
graphical place of residence, when a dor
mmate walked up to me.
"I've seen you here a lot. Are you in
this dorm?" she asked.
"Yep," I grinned, pointing to my pic

ture pasted right in the middle of Alaska.
"I haven't been around much the last few
days, though. I've been hanging out at the
square dance, helping to finish all the left
over ice cream."
"Oh, it doesn't look at all like you," she
said. "That picture is really attractive."
They never did figure out who broke the
glass and set my picture on fire that day.
Fortunately, my freshman roommate
and I didn't have normal roommate prob
lems, such as clashing futon covers or two
VCRs and no television. However, there
was that first night when she asked me to

sit down because she needed to tell me
something.
Shaking on the edge of my bed, 1 was
convinced she didn't want me as her
roommate. Though I was still a little hes
itant to sleep in a new environment with
the lights off, 1 hoped we could work
something out. I was willing to get rid of
the halogen lamps by the end of the week.
"I'm sorry," she said, "My dad works
for Exxon." I glowed. She was trying to
open up to me. It was the beginning of our
first real talk.
I stayed up all night telling her about
myself.
She woke up the next morning just
when I was getting to what I did during
my fifth-grade summer. I paused, moving
to turn off some of the spotlights, while
she explained she had told me about her
dad to let me know he didn't have any
thing to do with the oil spill. She thought
I was going to hate her! Silly rabbits.
Isolde and I grew closer, leaving only
the uncertainties spurned by the Office of
Residential Education to conquer. For the
first time, freshmen were forced to con
front who they were and what they were
all about. And more importantly, whether
they were techies or fuzzies.
I just couldn't decide which classes to

take. Around me the premedical students
wrestled with starting with the chemistry
or physics series, and the engineers strug
gled with starting with Math 4056 or
Math 4057.
"Spelling of Applied Technical Genet
ics of Symbolic Humanities Engineering
Astrophysics" looked good to me, but in
the end, I went with "Calculators for Cal
culations." It didn't fulfill a distribution
requirement, but I figured I already knew
how to spell "of." I had promised to chal
lenge myself while I was in college.
I was so excited the night before
classes started, I couldn't concentrate. It
was midnight before I had my lunch
packed, and I hadn't even decided which
color notebook to use for what class. At 4
a.m., after it was too late, I realized I
didn't even know what time the bus was
coming.
But before long, the quarter was well
on its way, and Full Moon in the Quad
rolled around. Though excited to see her,
I was kind of bummed that my little 15-
year-old sister had come to visit that
weekend. I decided to let her tag along,
hoping she wouldn't get in the way. We all
piled into the Quad in a mob, sporting our
groovy new dorm T-shirts.

The Clock Tower sounding the strokes
of midnight, I stood near Memorial
Church, a solitary unpecked Oteran. With
a yawn, I realized it was time to head
home and started searching for my sister.
"Whimsical young lass," 1 thought shak
ing my head, "She must have gone to find
somewhere to play."
Scanning the Quad, 1 tried to imagine
where the nearest sandbox would be.
Then, I saw her across the way. She was
kissing a boy! My little sister had become
a Stanford woman.
Dragging her home by her ear lobes,
she said she would have introduced me to
the guys crowded around her but she
couldn't remember all 20 names. It's a
shame my family doesn't bring that anec
dote up at the dinner table more often.
I must admit, I didn't think I was
going to like Stanford at first. Two years
later, however, I've grown to love it. The
homesickness gone, we've nestled into
our own wonderful little niches. Now I
understand why everyone chooses to
uproot herself and go overseas.
And lor all of you who are overseas
bound next year, may you take mildly
resembling passport pictures and find
welcoming faces wherever you travel. I'll
miss you.

kissing a boy! My little sister had become

Dragging her home by her ear lobes,

couldn't remember all 20 names. It's a
shame my family doesn't bring that anec

I must admit, I didn't think I was
going to like Stanford at first. Two years

homesickness gone, we've nestled into
our own wonderful little niches. Now I
understand why everyone chooses to
uproot herself and go overseas.
And lor all of you who are overseas
bound next year, may you take mildly

Just My Luck
It was just my luck. Coming to Stan
ford was intimidating for me. It
seemed like everyone else started with
246 units and was just three CIV classes
away from graduating. I just tried to keep
in mind that if I had gone anywhere else I
would have received credit for the three I
scored on the Advanced Placement Pen
manship Exam.
My disillusionment really started,
however, on the van ride from the airport,
when I found out my acceptance letter
wasn't the only one Dean Jean had writ
ten a note on. It was, though, the only one
that read "Fantastic, Future Curve Flub
ber!"
I'll always remember how neat it was
to see everyone greeted by her first name
when we entered Otero. Unfortunately,
none of the resident assistants recognized
me from my senior-year picture. Never
can get started on that Freshman 15 too
early, eh?
The sad 'story continued a few days
later. I was standing at the map that has
everyone's picture attached to her geo
graphical place of residence, when a dor
mmate walked up to me.
"I've seen you here a lot. Are you in
this dorm?" she asked.
"Yep," I grinned, pointing to my pic

ture pasted right in the middle of Alaska.
"I haven't been around much the last few
days, though. I've been hanging out at the
square dance, helping to finish all the left
over ice cream."
"Oh, it doesn't look at all like you," she
said. "That picture is really attractive."
They never did figure out who broke the
glass and set my picture on fire that day.
Fortunately, my freshman roommate
and I didn't have normal roommate prob
lems, such as clashing futon covers or two
VCRs and no television. However, there
was that first night when she asked me to

sit down because she needed to tell me
something.
Shaking on the edge of my bed, 1 was
convinced she didn't want me as her
roommate. Though I was still a little hes
itant to sleep in a new environment with
the lights off, 1 hoped we could work
something out. I was willing to get rid of
the halogen lamps by the end of the week.
"I'm sorry," she said, "My dad works
for Exxon." I glowed. She was trying to
open up to me. It was the beginning of our
first real talk.
I stayed up all night telling her about
myself.
She woke up the next morning just
when I was getting to what I did during
my fifth-grade summer. I paused, moving
to turn off some of the spotlights, while
she explained she had told me about her
dad to let me know he didn't have any
thing to do with the oil spill. She thought
I was going to hate her! Silly rabbits.
Isolde and I grew closer, leaving only
the uncertainties spurned by the Office of
Residential Education to conquer. For the
first time, freshmen were forced to con
front who they were and what they were
all about. And more importantly, whether
they were techies or fuzzies.
I just couldn't decide which classes to

take. Around me the premedical students
wrestled with starting with the chemistry
or physics series, and the engineers strug
gled with starting with Math 4056 or
Math 4057.
"Spelling of Applied Technical Genet
