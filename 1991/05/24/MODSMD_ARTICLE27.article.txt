### Paul Lyon 

'aul Lyon, a seventh-grader at Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School, is an aspiring young cartoonist. These selections represent his first published works, a goal toward which he has been striving for over six
ears. Lyon resides in Escondido Village with his mother, a doctoral candidate in English. Although he does find the social scene in Escondido a bit stifling, Lyon harbors no resentment toward his mother for
ailing to draw into Toyon Hall.
