Dear Biig,
Last night, as I was watching "Late
Night with David Letterman," a
HUGE mosquito suddenly flew
straight at me, its jaws gaping. Are all
California mosquitoes over 3 inches in
length? Why?
— Horrified of Huge, Gnarly Bugs
Nestled deep within the bowels of
my Biigcave, I had no idea this simple
yet desperate plea for help would lead
me on one of the most dangerous expe
ditions of my career as super-sleuth.
Quickly I summoned my lovable crime
fighting sidekick, Slug.
"Holy Hemorrhoids!" he shouted

This could only be the
work of one devious
individual: Grouchy
Hasher Man!

upon reading the note. "This could be
trouble!"
"Is it trouble," 1 confided to him.
"Slug, I want you to go out and capture
one of these monstrous mosquitoes,
these immense insects, these . .
"Wait a second," he protested, "Why
is it I always have to run these erratic,
errant errands?"
"Never mind that, my altogether
alarmist alliterating ally, just go."
"Right away, sir."
"And stop tracking yellow-brown
goo all over my cave."
"Yes, sir."

"And don't take so damned long this
time."
"You're a real bastard, sir."
Hours later Slug returned, a speci
men in his possession. But he was on
his last leg (pod, whatever): Some
fiend had thoroughly salted him and,
as he handed over the insect, he
breathed his last breath. A faithful
comrade to the end.
Boy did his shriveled, lifeless body
really stink.
Immediately, I placed the giant
mosquito in my spectro-analyzer.
What I learned from the readout
shocked me: It was not a mosquito, but
a mosquito hawk! Yes, these wondrous
creatures, which look something like a
daddy longlegs with big wings, actually
prey on the traditional mosquito we
are all accustomed to. Someone, it
seemed, had been misinformed.
But who was behind this villainous
deception? And why did someone rub
Slug out to keep it all a secret? This
could only be the work of one devious
individual: my nemesis, my archen
emy, yes, the diabolical Grouchy
Hasher Man!
Suddenly, mysteriously, there he
was, that cunning wrongdoer; he must
have followed Slug to the Biigcave.
"I have you now, Bug," he chortled.
"Do your worst, you deviant hood
lum."
It was then that he used his ill
begotten superpowers: "No, you can't

have two servings," he snarled, driving
me to my knees. He continued his
onslaught, "You forgot your meal card?
I'm afraid you're going to have to go
back and get it." As he cackled with
insidious glee, I collapsed to the
ground, my vision growing dim.
I had to do something, lest this
fiend vanquish me. Where was my
secret weapon when I needed it? I
grabbed at my Biigbelt where I kept all
my crime-fighting "gizmos" — sneez
ing powder, Vaseline, sea monkeys,
marionettes, thermonuclear war
heads, Spam . . .
OK, this is getting really silly. Next
question.
Dear Biig,
Where do Mohawks come from?
— Full-haired and perplexed
The Mohawk is derived from the
hairstyle worn by the Mohican Native
American tribe, a member of the Iro
quois League. The haircut, generally
associated with the "punk" movement
of the late '70s and early '80s, first
became popular around 1960 and still
can be seen today if you ever find your
self trapped at The Edge.

The Bug is convinced the happy little
computer face you see every time you
turn on your Macintosh is a pawn of
Satan and is out to kill him. Somebody
write him, please.

hairstyle worn by the Mohican Native
American tribe, a member of the Iro
quois League. The haircut, generally
associated with the "punk" movement
of the late '70s and early '80s, first
became popular around 1960 and still
can be seen today if you ever find your
self trapped at The Edge.

The Bug is convinced the happy little
computer face you see every time you
turn on your Macintosh is a pawn of
Satan and is out to kill him. Somebody
write him, please.
