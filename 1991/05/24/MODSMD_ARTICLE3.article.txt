When Maria Bernadette Sandoval
was encouraged to apply to Stanford by
the principal of her 217-girl Catholic
high school in Cuernavaca, Mexico, she
never dreamed she would not only be
admitted but be elected as a member of
the Council of Presidents for the 1991-
1992 school year.
Benny, as she is known to all of her
friends, has always taken her major
accomplishments in stride. She says she
accepts the opportunities that "seem to
plop into her lap," such as becoming the
first president of the Latino Student
Association, which she helped start last
fall.
Yet she pursues these opportunities
with the strength and drive of her char
acter and her calm demeanor, according
to some of her friends and co-workers.
Sandoval's serene character reflects a
supportive family that she says is one of
the most important priorities in her life.
She feels her family structure is unique
in Mexico because of her mother's Amer
ican heritage.
"My house is different in that every

one has equal weight," she says. "Our
voices are equal. My dad isn't the stereo
typical macho Mexican man."
She also credits her parents for giving
her freedoms that shaped her character.
"My parents taught me to be individual
istic. They gave me a lot of liberties. I've
learned to be responsible for myself and
independent in my decisions."
Her parents also emphasized the
importance of a strong education — a
lesson Sandoval strongly values.
She says she was able to walk into her
dorm room on her first day at Stanford
and immediately form a close and lasting
friendship with her roommate, Olympic
gold medalist Janet Evans.
"Janet gave me a whole new perspec
tive on life," Sandoval says, as her eyes
wander around the room. "She reaf
firmed in me that the most important
value to a person is who they are inside,
not what they've done." Her eyes finally
rest on the poster hanging over the door
of Evans advocating a "drug-free Amer

look curiously at an enormous poster

Council of Presidents-elect member Benny Sandoval is known for her calm, yet
energetic, nature. "I am strong and determined, because I fight for what I believe,
even though I don't think I'm visibly a fighter," she says.
