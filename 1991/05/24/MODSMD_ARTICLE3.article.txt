# Tranquility gives force to COP member's work

### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
When Maria Bernadette Sandoval
was encouraged to apply to Stanford by
the principal of her 217-girl Catholic
high school in Cuernavaca, Mexico, she
never dreamed she would not only be
admitted but be elected as a member of
the Council of Presidents for the 1991-
1992 school year.
Benny, as she is known to all of her
friends, has always taken her major
accomplishments in stride. She says she
accepts the opportunities that "seem to
plop into her lap," such as becoming the
first president of the Latino Student
Association, which she helped start last
fall.
Yet she pursues these opportunities
with the strength and drive of her char
acter and her calm demeanor, according
to some of her friends and co-workers.
Sandoval's serene character reflects a
supportive family that she says is one of
the most important priorities in her life.
She feels her family structure is unique
in Mexico because of her mother's Amer
ican heritage.
"My house is different in that every

one has equal weight," she says. "Our
voices are equal. My dad isn't the stereo
typical macho Mexican man."
She also credits her parents for giving
her freedoms that shaped her character.
"My parents taught me to be individual
istic. They gave me a lot of liberties. I've
learned to be responsible for myself and
independent in my decisions."
Her parents also emphasized the
importance of a strong education — a
lesson Sandoval strongly values.
She says she was able to walk into her
dorm room on her first day at Stanford
and immediately form a close and lasting
friendship with her roommate, Olympic
gold medalist Janet Evans.
"Janet gave me a whole new perspec
tive on life," Sandoval says, as her eyes
wander around the room. "She reaf
firmed in me that the most important
value to a person is who they are inside,
not what they've done." Her eyes finally
rest on the poster hanging over the door
of Evans advocating a "drug-free Amer

Most people who enter her room also
look curiously at an enormous poster

Council of Presidents-elect member Benny Sandoval is known for her calm, yet
energetic, nature. "I am strong and determined, because I fight for what I believe,
even though I don't think I'm visibly a fighter," she says.
promoting tourism in the Mexican
state of Morales. It takes about 30
seconds before people squeal, real
izing that the beautiful, laughing
Mexican girl holding a clay sun is
actually Sandoval, who modeled
in Mexico before coming to Stan
ford.
She says the transition to Stan
ford was difficult because of her
multi-ethnic heritage. Her
mother is white and her father is
Mexican.
"I was brought into a system
where you have to say, 'I belong to
this ethnic group.' Categories
were a shock to me," Sandoval
says."It made me think twice
about who I was. I knew I came to
Stanford to learn about my Amer
ican side, but I didn't know ques
tioning and doubting would be
such a big part of my life."
Although she says "I'm not
fully Mexican in the way I talk
and act," she identifies strongly
with the Mexican culture.

"I was raised in Mexico so 1
consider myself culturally and
socially Mexican, even though I
learned English first," Sandoval
adds, tilting her head while criti
cally scanning the vibrant Mexi
can ornaments, crafts and color
ful tree-bark paintings that adorn
her room.
"When I came here, I felt I had
to hold on to my Mexican side, or
1 thought I would lose it. Yes, I am
American, too, but I really can't
fit in with American culture," she
says.
Despite the cultural conflicts
that complicate her life, she
remains what fellow Council of
President member-elect, sopho
more Beth Morgan, describes as
"a calming force."
Although Morgan views San
doval as the least aggressive of the
four COP members, she says her
tranquility is valuable: "Benny
can retain energy and not get
overworked by it. The three of us
get riled, fired up and talking over
each other. But Sandoval will sit
back and say, 'Wait a moment,
take your turn.' She can facili
tate."

"1 don't fight back," Sandoval
explains, "Because 1 know who I
am and what I think and what I
believe in."
Sandoval also says that she
doesn't see herself as aggressive.
However, she adds, "I am strong
and determined, because I fight
for what I believe, even though I
don't think I'm visibly a fighter."
Although Sandoval has no pre
vious political experience in the
ASSU, the other COP members
view this as an advantage, espe
cially during the earlier days of
hectic campaigning.
"She's made us stay very pro
active and keep our goals in sight,
not reactive by attacking what
others say," Morgan says. "Some
times political experience detracts
from the ability to have a fresh
viewpoint."
Morgan adds that she feels
Sandoval's way with people
makes her well-suited for the
COP "She's the easiest of the four
of us to talk with. She's accessible,
she's warm, she's thoughtful."
Her extensive experience with
Latino issues is also viewed as an
enormous asset. "Her knowledge

of the Latino community is amaz
ing — unrivaled by anyone on
campus," Morgan says.
"I am very involved with my
Latino community and to a cer
tain extent feel representative of
Latinos," Sandoval says. But "as a
COP member, I feel responsibility
not only to Latinos, but to every
one. Everyone needs to be repre
sented equally."
Sandoval's other goals for next
year include improved communi
cation between the ASSU and stu
dents, hopefully through a
newsletter or another publication.
She also wants to organize a
culture festival that would stand
out from similar events in the
past, as it would focus on partici
pation. "Students would actually
be sharing and experiencing cul
tures, rather than just watching
performances," Sandoval says.
Sandoval's calm nature does
not prevent her from constantly
questioning herself. She says she
is especially concerned about
being over-involved in activities:
Aside from founding the Latino
Student Association, Sandoval
participated in Barrio Assistance

and the Orientation Volunteer
and Student Ambassador pro
grams during the past two years.
"This quarter and last quarter
especially, I've done so many
things I feel I'm stretching myself
too thin, to the extent that I won
der if I'm doing anything right,"
Sandoval says.
Yet she will not allow herself to
give up any of her activities,
which also include being a board
member of the Mexican Student
Association.
"Why don't I just concentrate
on one activity?" Sandoval asks,
smiling. "Because then I wouldn't
be satisfied."
Ironically, the force of her char
acter stems from what she per
ceives as inner weakness.
"Personally, on the very, very
interior, I feel like I'm weak. I've
always felt weak." She frowns
slightly, then firmly raises her
chin. "That's what pushes me, the
desire to overcome weakness."
Sandoval also worries that her
activities leave her little time to
spend with friends. Her upbring
ing in Mexico prioritized the value
of friendship. "In Mexico, people

were more relaxed, but they knew
the importance of relationships. If
you have good relationships with
people, it keeps you happy."
She says she feels it's too easy
to lose contact with friends in
Stanford's overly hectic and self
absorbing atmosphere. "Everyone
here has their own life planned
out and has their own interests.
And it's frustrating and it's
lonely."
One of Sandoval's closest
friends, sophomore Jim Gardner
doesn't feel any neglect in their
relationship. "She'll talk to me for
hours if there's something wrong
even though she has tons of work
to do. She always manages to fit
her friends in,"he says.
Sandoval plans to return to
Mexico after graduation, despite
the difficult prejudices she may
encounter as a woman. She says,
matter-of-factly, "I think I'll have
to work harder to get what I want,
and to achieve personal goals to
prove to myself — and others —
that I'm capable."
But then, the easy way out has
never been Sandoval's style.
