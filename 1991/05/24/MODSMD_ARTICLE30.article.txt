## Stanford stops San Diego State 12-5 to start regional 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
FRESNO, Calif. — David Holbrook
gave and David Holbrook took away. But
he took away first, which in the end
might have been better for the Cardinal.
The Stanford baseball team began
the trek back to Omaha the right way
yesterday, beating San Diego State 12-5
in game No. 2 of the three games played
on the opening day of the West II
Regional at Fresno State's Beiden Field.

Baseball

Cardinal 12
Aztecs 5

Miami opened play with a 13-1 win over
Portland, and Fresno State took the
nightcap 7-2 over Cal State-Northridge
behind the pitching of ace Bobby Jones.
The Cardinal will face Fresno State
tonight at 7:30.
In a game that appeared to he a
thrashing, the Cardinal actually found
itself behind 5-4 in the bottom of the
seventh until a single up the middle by
Holbrook scored two and put the game
out of reach.
Holbrook would finish the game 3-
for-4 with three RBI. That was the the
giving part. The third baseman also had
a two run error in the first inning and a
later third inning fielding hesitation
that cost another run. That was the part
he gave away, but it might not have been
that bad. The second "error" caused
some words to be spoken in the Cardinal
dugout, an argument that managed to
shake up Stanford enough to help pull
out the win.
"There was a lot of built up tension,"
said eventual winner Scott Weiss. "(The
argument) was good for us becaue it
reminded us that it wasn't us who was
the enemy, it was San Diego State. After
that we really relaxed and started
swinging the bat."
The tension was started in the first

inning when starter John Reid loaded
the bases on two singles and a walk and
then Holbrook cleanly fielded a
Marcelino Garcia hopper. In trying to
save a run, however, he threw it wide of
catcher Troy Tallman. Just like that it
was 2-0 in the Aztecs favor.
"I tried to rush the play," Holbrook
said. "I tried to rush the throw to Troy
so that he could get double play. I made
a bad throw."
Stanford would come back to take a
3-2 lead in the bottom of the inning
when Jeffrey Hammonds blasted a
three-run shot over the left-field fence
and Holbrook would breath a sigh of
relief. Or at least for a little while. Find
ing the game tied 3-3 in the third after a
Bill Dtinckel single scored Scott Denni
son, Holbrook's slight hesitation to sec
ond trying to get a force out gave Garcia
the impetus to come home from third
and put SDSU on top. Then came the
words in the dugout.
"It was between me and everybody,"
said Holbrook. "(The team) was trying
ta pick me up and 1 took it the wrong
way. They were saying 'let it fly,' 'get rid
of it,' and I took it the wrong way."
All was forgotten in the seventh
when Holbrook more than made up for
his mistakes. Ironically an error by
Aztec third baseman Steve Boucher
started the inning by putting Mark
Skeels on first. Skeels was advanced by
a Chris Kemper single, and after a David
Cornell sacrifice bunt, Stanford found
itself with men on first and second with
one out.
Holbrook came up already having hit
a single and an RBI triple, but saved his
best for last. His single brought in both
men and started a four-run rally that
took the Cardinal ahead to stay.
"I thought it was only a matter of
time before we would get to (Aztec
stater Brian Holliday), said Holbrook.
"Eventually we would adjust to him try
ing to throw outside and away from us."
Holliday wound up the day with five
strikeouts, all of them coming on the
outside corner of the plate.

"The catcher was sitting far out (on
the plate), and the ump ws giving it to
him," said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "He was consistent though, and
as long as he is consistent you have to
adjust."
The Cardinal wound up getting eight
runs on seven hits over its last two at
bats (as the home team they did not bat
in the ninth), which was a good thing
because up until those last few innings
the Aztecs were looking pretty good as
the spoilers.
The inning before the Cardinal out
burst, SDSU found itself up 5-4 with
men on second and third and two out.
Dennison looped a ball into right that
looked like it would fall, but Steve
Solomon came flying in to make a great
catch and end the threat.
Marquess would say after the game
that along with Hammond's home run
in the first, the catch was one of the two
turning points in the game.
"Solomon's catch was a great effort,"
said the 15th-year head coach. "It ended
a rally that would have put them ahead
by four runs. That play kept us in the
game."
As did the pitching of Scott Weiss.
The Aztecs were having their way with
starter Reid and releiver Aaron Dorlar
que, and it took the all-Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division pitcher Weiss
to close things down. Taking over the
two-men-on situation from Dorlarque
in the sixth, Weiss finished the game by
holding SDSU scoreless over the last
three and two-thirds innings. The right
hander picked up the win to go 8-7.
"My frame of mind was to go in there
and get control of the game," Weiss said.
"You have to go out with that same
approch every game."
The Cardinal now advance into the
winners bracket of this West II
Regional, and with every game being so
important, Weiss' philosophy is a good
one to follow. Like David Holbrook
learned, when you are not in control bad
things happen. But when you are on top
of t he situation the winning comes easv.

seventh until a single up the middle by
Holbrook scored two and put the game
out of reach.
Holbrook would finish the game 3-
for-4 with three RBI. That was the the
giving part. The third baseman also had
a two run error in the first inning and a
later third inning fielding hesitation
that cost another run. That was the part
he gave away, but it might not have been
that bad. The second "error" caused
some words to be spoken in the Cardinal
dugout, an argument that managed to
shake up Stanford enough to help pull
out the win.
"There was a lot of built up tension,"
said eventual winner Scott Weiss. "(The
argument) was good for us becaue it
reminded us that it wasn't us who was
the enemy, it was San Diego State. After
that we really relaxed and started
swinging the bat."
The tension was started in the first

inning when starter John Reid loaded
the bases on two singles and a walk and
then Holbrook cleanly fielded a
Marcelino Garcia hopper. In trying to
save a run, however, he threw it wide of
catcher Troy Tallman. Just like that it
was 2-0 in the Aztecs favor.
"I tried to rush the play," Holbrook
said. "I tried to rush the throw to Troy
so that he could get double play. I made
a bad throw."
Stanford would come back to take a
3-2 lead in the bottom of the inning
when Jeffrey Hammonds blasted a
three-run shot over the left-field fence
and Holbrook would breath a sigh of
relief. Or at least for a little while. Find
ing the game tied 3-3 in the third after a
Bill Dtinckel single scored Scott Denni
son, Holbrook's slight hesitation to sec
ond trying to get a force out gave Garcia
the impetus to come home from third
and put SDSU on top. Then came the
words in the dugout.
"It was between me and everybody,"
said Holbrook. "(The team) was trying
ta pick me up and 1 took it the wrong
way. They were saying 'let it fly,' 'get rid
of it,' and I took it the wrong way."
All was forgotten in the seventh
when Holbrook more than made up for
his mistakes. Ironically an error by
Aztec third baseman Steve Boucher
started the inning by putting Mark
Skeels on first. Skeels was advanced by
a Chris Kemper single, and after a David
Cornell sacrifice bunt, Stanford found
itself with men on first and second with
one out.
Holbrook came up already having hit
a single and an RBI triple, but saved his
best for last. His single brought in both
men and started a four-run rally that
took the Cardinal ahead to stay.
"I thought it was only a matter of
time before we would get to (Aztec
stater Brian Holliday), said Holbrook.
"Eventually we would adjust to him try
ing to throw outside and away from us."
Holliday wound up the day with five
strikeouts, all of them coming on the
outside corner of the plate.

"The catcher was sitting far out (on
the plate), and the ump ws giving it to
him," said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "He was consistent though, and
as long as he is consistent you have to
adjust."
The Cardinal wound up getting eight
runs on seven hits over its last two at
bats (as the home team they did not bat
in the ninth), which was a good thing
because up until those last few innings
the Aztecs were looking pretty good as
the spoilers.
The inning before the Cardinal out
burst, SDSU found itself up 5-4 with
men on second and third and two out.
Dennison looped a ball into right that
looked like it would fall, but Steve
Solomon came flying in to make a great
catch and end the threat.
Marquess would say after the game
that along with Hammond's home run
in the first, the catch was one of the two
turning points in the game.
"Solomon's catch was a great effort,"
said the 15th-year head coach. "It ended
a rally that would have put them ahead
by four runs. That play kept us in the
game."
As did the pitching of Scott Weiss.
The Aztecs were having their way with
starter Reid and releiver Aaron Dorlar
que, and it took the all-Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division pitcher Weiss
to close things down. Taking over the
two-men-on situation from Dorlarque
in the sixth, Weiss finished the game by
holding SDSU scoreless over the last
three and two-thirds innings. The right
hander picked up the win to go 8-7.
"My frame of mind was to go in there
and get control of the game," Weiss said.
"You have to go out with that same
approch every game."
The Cardinal now advance into the
winners bracket of this West II
Regional, and with every game being so
important, Weiss' philosophy is a good
one to follow. Like David Holbrook
learned, when you are not in control bad
things happen. But when you are on top
of t he situation the winning comes easv.

Both Troy Tallman, left, and Steve Solomon had a lot to celebrate about yesterday as
Stanford scored four runs in both the seventh and eighth innings last night to beat San
Diego State 12-5. The Cardinal plays its second game in the West II Regional tonight
at Fresno State.
FRESNO, Calif. — David Holbrook
gave and David Holbrook took away. But
he took away first, which in the end
might have been better for the Cardinal.
The Stanford baseball team began
the trek back to Omaha the right way
yesterday, beating San Diego State 12-5
in game No. 2 of the three games played
on the opening day of the West II
Regional at Fresno State's Beiden Field.

Miami opened play with a 13-1 win over
Portland, and Fresno State took the
nightcap 7-2 over Cal State-Northridge
behind the pitching of ace Bobby Jones.
The Cardinal will face Fresno State
tonight at 7:30.

thrashing, the Cardinal actually found
