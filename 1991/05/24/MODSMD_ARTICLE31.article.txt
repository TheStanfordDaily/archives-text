# Card netters keep winning at NCAAs

### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Day two of NCAA individual play held no
surprises for the Cardinal. No unpleasant
ones, that is.
All four remaining Stanford competitors
advanced to today's third round of singles or
second round of doubles with solid, if unspec
tacular play.

Alex O'Brien 1 ived up to his singles ranking.
The No. 3 seed had little trouble downing
unranked, yet not exactly unnoticeable Bruce
Haddad 6-3, 6-0. The almost unknown Haddad
got O'Brien's attention very quickly when he
strutted onto the court sporting an Aunt
.Jamima headband. So quickly that Stanford's
No. 1 player netted his first serve.
When O'Brien got ready to deliver his sec
ond serve, Haddad continued his antics. The

Florida competitor casually walked up to to
the service line, both hands down, and hung
out for O'Brien's delivery.
"[Haddad] is quite a character," O'Brien
said. "He really tried to intimidate ine, and he
did a really good job of it.
"He was a nut."
Distracted bv Haddad's antics O'Brien lost
his first serve to go down 0-2. But that was the
only time Haddad was to get a break. O'Brien
quickly settled into the match, ignoring the
on-the-court distractions, and controlled the
next set and a half.
"He had me psyched up pretty good, but I
came back and played pretty solid tennis,"
O'Brien said. "The second set I moved the ball
around pretty well, and he got a little frus
trated."
Jared Palmer had no such problems with
his opponent. After pulling out a very tight
three-set tiebreaker Wednesday, the sopho
more was off the court so fast yesterday any
late spectators missed the match. The serve
and-volley specialist made quick work of
Michael Zimmerman, allowing the Harvard
competitor only a game: 6-1, 6-0, match over.
"lie just played right into my game and I
could attack him pretty much whenever 1
wanted," Palmer said. "I was moving well and
setting up well. I hit a couple of good passing
shots early that set the tempo for the match.
"1 felt good today."
Palmer's second match was anything but a
breeze, however. He and partner Jonathan
Stark had their rackets full trying to tame Brit
Haygarth and Mike Michulka in the first
round of doubles play. The Longhorn pair
would not give in to Stark and Palmer's relent
less attack from the net, and hung in the
match until the third set tiebreaker.
After splitting the first two sets and staying
even in the third, Haygarth and Michulka
broke Stark and Palmer to serve for the match
at 6-5. With their back to the baseline, the
tournament's No. 1 seed finally came alive.
Stark and Palmer turned their play up a
notch, hitting great returns and avoiding
unforced errors. The Texas duo, on the other
hand, missed a couple of shots, and the break
was Stanford's.
"We went into the breaker with a second
wind, and just came up with a few big shots at
the right time to squeak by," Palmer said.
The Cardinal duo hung tough when it
counted, and used the momentum from the
equalizing break to take the match 6-3, 3-6, 7-
6(7-5).
The nation's best doubles team isn't very
pleased with its play so far. "We're playing all
right. We've got to pick it up another level as
the tournament progresses," Palmer said.
"It's there but we just have to put our games
together now. It's almost like we're still play
ing singles."
O'Brien definitely left his singles match
behind in the afternoon. He and partner .Jason
Yee had little trouble with the talented tandem
of Jason Rubell and Geoff Grant.
O'Brien and Yee opened the match by
breaking the Duke duo, and held on to their
advantage the remainder of the set by playing
their usual tenacious game. The Cardinal
went up by two breaks before Rubell and
Grant broke back. With O'Brien serving at 5-
4, however, Stanford closed out the first set,
and cruised to the straight-set victory, 6-4, 6-3.
"We played our usual game â€” lots of lobs,
running down balls, scrappy tennis," O'Brien
said. "Jason returned well, which helped us
out a lot."
