# Women's golf team moves to 10th place
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Jodi Figley is sensing that
her time is nearly up as a Car
dinal, and she is determined
not to leave collegiate golf
unnoticed. In the second round
of the 72-hole NCAA Champi
onships yesterday, the senior
veteran spearheaded the Cardi
nal women's golf team attack
on the upper ranks by shooting
a 73 one-over-par.
"I should've shot under par,
but it was (still) one of my best
ball-striking days," Figley said.
Led by Figlev's antics, the
sixth-ranked Cardinal link
sters shot a combined 305 on
the Scarlet Golf Course at Ohio
State after having come up
with a 312 Wednesday. As of
today, entering the third round
of plav, the Cardinal is in sole

possession of 10th place. How
ever, the golfers only trail
sixth-place Duke by two
strokes with two days to go.
"We're only two strokes out
of sixth and we're playing aver
age for us," said junior Martha
Richards, who turned in one of
her best performances in colle
giate competition with a six
over-par 78. "Three-oh-five is
much better than 312 but this
team is capable of much more."
Third-ranked UCLA and
top-ranked San Jose State, the
two so-called "superteams" in
the words of Cardinal coach
Tim Baldwin, are running
away from the competition.
After having shot a 288 yester
day, the Bruins lead the pack at
589 with the Spartans only two
strokes off that hot pace.
With a two-day total of 617,
the Cardinal is well off the lead
but in striking distance of even
fourth place. Second-ranked Ari
zona and No. 4 Georgia are tied in
fourth with 607, 10 strokes lower
than Stanford.
"We knocked off seven strokes
today, and we're looking to knock

off five more tomorrow," said
Figley. "We're looking for a top
five finish."
That is well within reach, espe
cially if Figley continues to shine
like she did yesterday. "Jodi
played beautifully," Baldwin said.
"Her only blemish was a bogey on
the 17th."
Figley's one-over-par placed
her 21st among the individual
competitors, tops on the Cardinal.
"I'm happy with the way that I
played," she said. "I've hit great

the last two days and I'm confi
dent with my swing. I'm trusting
myself."
Richards, the two-sport phe
nom, came alive yesterday,
recording a 78 on the day after
shooting a 12-over-par 82
Wednesday. "I hit the ball great,"
she said. "I had a lot of birdie
putts, and I can't complain with
the way I played. It's the best I've
been hitting the ball."
"Martha is lacking in experi
ence, but I've had the feeling that

she would really help us," said
Baldwin. "She really helped us
out today. She could've scored
even lower. She hit the ball
tremendously."
Richard's 78 rounded out the
top four scores for the Cardinal
along with junior Stephanie
Davis' 76 and junior Adele
Moore's 78. Junior Audrey Wood
ing, ranked 20th in the country,
struggled yet another day with a
10-over-par 82 one day after
shooting an 80.
Richards knew that things
were going her way yesterday
with her stellar performance on
the second hole. After hitting the
driver into the left rough, she hit
the eight-iron and bounced the
ball back onto the green. She then
drilled a 40-foot downhill putt.
"Tim always tells us that the
best way to hit a long downhill
putt is to lag putt," said Richards.
"It went from left to right to left
to right and then went in. I just
laughed at it."
Moore, ranked 17th in the
nation, is tied with Davis for 41st
at 154, 11 strokes behind leader
Christy Erb of UCLA. "I'm not
unhappy with the way that I hit
the ball," Moore said. "Every shot
I hit felt good; it's just that I
didn't hit many birdies and I
didn't get up-and-down very
often."
Richards said that the key to
the Cardinal's game yesterday
was an attacking style of play. "We
went out and tried to attack and
make birdies and not just pars,"
she said.
"We're going to need to try
even harder tomorrow to make
birdies."
