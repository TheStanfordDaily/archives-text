# Women's golf team moves to 10th place

### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Jodi Figley is sensing that
her time is nearly up as a Car
dinal, and she is determined
not to leave collegiate golf
unnoticed. In the second round
of the 72-hole NCAA Champi
onships yesterday, the senior
veteran spearheaded the Cardi
nal women's golf team attack
on the upper ranks by shooting
a 73 one-over-par.
"I should've shot under par,
but it was (still) one of my best
ball-striking days," Figley said.
Led by Figlev's antics, the
sixth-ranked Cardinal link
sters shot a combined 305 on
the Scarlet Golf Course at Ohio
State after having come up
with a 312 Wednesday. As of
today, entering the third round
of plav, the Cardinal is in sole

possession of 10th place. How
ever, the golfers only trail
sixth-place Duke by two
strokes with two days to go.
"We're only two strokes out
of sixth and we're playing aver
age for us," said junior Martha
Richards, who turned in one of
her best performances in colle
giate competition with a six
over-par 78. "Three-oh-five is
much better than 312 but this
team is capable of much more."
Third-ranked UCLA and
top-ranked San Jose State, the
two so-called "superteams" in
the words of Cardinal coach
Tim Baldwin, are running
away from the competition.
After having shot a 288 yester
day, the Bruins lead the pack at
589 with the Spartans only two
strokes off that hot pace.
