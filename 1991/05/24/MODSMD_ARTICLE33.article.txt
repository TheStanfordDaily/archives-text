# Men have fast start

### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Things did not turn out as
planned yesterday for the Car
dinal men's golf team. In fact,
everything went awry for the
Cardinal golfers in the first
round of the 72-hole NCAA
Western Regionals on the
South Golf Course in Albu
querque, N.M.
But in the end the Cardi
nal's mettle was displayed as
Mike Milliken, the No. 5 player
on the squad, paced the team
by shooting a two-under-par 70
on the afternoon in his first
collegiate tourney of major
importance. The linksters fin
ished the day in command of a
potential NCAA tournament
bid at fifth place with a com
bined 289, 10 strokes behind
the current leader, UNLV
Milliken, currently ninth
individually, four strokes
behind the leader Warren
Schutte of UNLV compensated
for Christian Cevaer's rocky
first day outing. Cevaer, the
Cardinal's top player, shot a
four-over-par 76 on an unusu
ally hot day that was capped
with swirling gusts in the after
noon.
However, the young Cardi
nal team's consistency yester
day made Cevaer's higher
than-average score not even
count. "It feels good to be
thrown out," said Cevaer, the
team's captain who regularly
scores among the Cardinal's
top two or three scorers. "This
is the team effort that I've been
looking for."

The Cardinal came out on a
rampage in the morning. Dave
Rutkowski birdied the first
hole. Milliken birdied the first
two holes. And Notah Begay
made good for birdie on the
first three holes.
Milliken remained at two
under-par on the front nine
holes and played the back side
at an even par. "I started off
really strong, and that really
helped me to play the rest of
the day under par," Milliken
said. "It made it a lot more
comfortable for me."
"I played kind of good," said
Begay, who shot four under par
on the front nine holes before
going four over on the back
side to finish even.
Casey Martin also finished
the day with an even 72, 20th
overall individually. And Mar
tin's round was no less roller
coaster-like than Begay's. After
starting off fairly solidly, Mar
tin found himself three over
after 11 holes of play. But he
set off on a mission and birdied
the 14th, 15th and 18th.
"I felt good about birdying
the 14th and 15th because
before that I couldn't get the
putts to fall," he said.
After birdying the initial
hole, Rutkowski went on to
three-putt four times and end
up with a three-over-par 75. "I
hit the ball really well," he said.
"Unfortunately, I three-putted
a lot."
Cevaer, one of the premier
golfers ever to play for Stan
ford, was not phased bv his
