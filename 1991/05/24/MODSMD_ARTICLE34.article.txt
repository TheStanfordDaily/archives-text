# Asian fraternity may get official status
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
Lambda Phi Epsilon, an Asian-
American fraternity introduced at
Stanford this year, may become an
official chapter this weekend at
the fraternity's national conven
tion at UCLA.
Convention representatives
may vote to waive the year-long
colonization period, which is the
initial status of a newly founded
fraternity.
The fraternity is recognized as

an official student organization by
the University, but has not yet
been approved as a permanent
fraternity. It has also not yet
approached the Interfraternity
Council to become a member.
Lambda Phi Epsilon was estab
lished nationally in 1981 at
UCLA, and its chapters are
mostly found in California.
Although predominantly Asian-
American, the fraternity is open
to members of all ethnic back
grounds.
The Stanford chapter con

ducted an informal Rush this
spring, gaining 15 members. The
fraternity now has 21 members,
all of whom are of Asian descent.
Each pledge will play a sub
stantial role in developing the
group, since three of the six
founding members will graduate
this year. Current president Mike
Yun, a sophomore, will be here
next year, however.
"Every day our ideas become
more clear, individually and collec
tively," said senior Hanns Lee,
another of the founding members.

All pledges will become active
members during the fifth week of
fall quarter.
The fraternity's informal Rush
activities in April included an
information meeting, barbecue
and sports day, and an invitation
only party. In addition, the six
founding members met with
interested students during other
lunch and dinner meetings.
"It was hard for the six of us to
get to know 30 guys," said Lee.
But "this allowed us to have more
personal interaction."
