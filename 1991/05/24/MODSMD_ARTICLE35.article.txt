# Mountain climber recounts peak experiences

### Jenny Wash 
P"or Lou Whittaker, what began as a doc
tor's prescription has become a lifelong pur
suit.
Whittaker first began mountain-climbing
with his identical twin brother as a 12-year-old
Boy Scout. The twins, both of whom suffered
from asthma, were told by their doctors that
they could escape the dust and pollen that pol
lutes the air at lower altitudes by hiking in the
hills.
Once they began climbing, they were
hooked. At 16 they reached the summit of Mt.
Rainier in Washington State.
Whittaker, now 62, has conquered the three
highest peaks in the world - Mt. Everest and
Mt. Kangchenjunga in Nepal and K2 in India.
He has also climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa,
Mt. McKinley in Alaska and several peaks in
China.
But Wednesday, Whittaker faced a less diffi
cult challenge â€” climbing the steps at the
Stanford Bookstore.
After the easy ascent, he spoke as part of

the Bookstore's Grand Opening celebration.
From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., he signed copies of
a poster celebrating his most recent climb. At
2 p.m., he gave a slide-show presentation and
shared some of his experiences with an audi
ence of almost 40 people.
Whittaker led his most recent expedition, a
successful climb of Mt. Kangchenjunga in
Nepal. It took the American team a little over
three months to reach the peak, the third
highest in the world at more than 29,000 feet.
"Three months without a bath is a long
time," joked Whittaker.
At the end of Whittaker's climb of
Kangchenjunga, his team remained 10 feet
below the summit to respect the local belief
that the gods live atop the summit. "We didn't
see any gods," Whittaker added, smiling.
Whittaker has made two attempts to scale
Mt. Everest, the highest peak in the world. In
1982, his team climbed for three months,
before the death of one of his teammates
ended the expedition.
"No mountain is worth a life," Whittaker
said.

His next attempt in 1984 was successful
when one team member made it to the summit
of Mt. Everest.
A mountaineering trip is considered suc
cessful even if only one member reaches the
summit, Whittaker said, because the entire
team works so hard setting up camps and giv
ing support to their teammates.
Whittaker cautioned would-be climbers not
to focus too much on reaching the summit and
miss the incredible experience and scenery
along the way.
"Sometimes," he said, "the journey exceeds
the destination."
Whittaker currently lives at the base of Mt.
Rainier. He owns a mountaineering company
that organizes trips to its summit. He said he
is planning another expedition to K2, the sec
ond highest peak in the world.
His slide presentation included breath-tak
ing scenery from all of his major expeditions,
photographs of hazards that climbers must
overcome and even some slides of wildlife that
he encountered in Africa.
