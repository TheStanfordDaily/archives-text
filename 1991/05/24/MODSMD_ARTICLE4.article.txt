# Price of recycled paper decreases
## 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
One of the standard excuses for
ducking the rising tide of environ
mental consciousness has bitten
the dust, as the price of recycled
paper at the University's Central
Stores has now come down below
the cost of virgin paper.
The change, which is expected
to spur wider use of recycled
paper, is a result of growing
demand during the last year as
more academic departments and
campus offices have switched to
recycled paper despite higher
costs.
"Before, it was a personal
choice to use recycled paper,
because the cost was higher," said
Marianne Bithell, a public rela
tions manager at Central Stores,
which supplies paper products to
the University. "But because of
the increased volume in the last
year, now it's a better choice."
Central Stores also changed to
a different brand while renegoti
ating its contract with the sup
plier, which lowered the price. A
ream of the recycled Matrix white
paper now costs $2.91, while vir
gin paper runs $3.09 per ream.
The change may have also been
prompted by research and pres
sure by Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford. The group,
which has worked on the issue for
several years, wrote a letter last
month to Central Stores after
members were able to find recy
cled paper for about 20 cents a
ream cheaper than Central
Stores' prices.
"Before we were trying to con
vince people to pay more for recy
cled paper," said John Elliot, a
SEAS member. "It'll be much eas
ier now."
In May 1990, SEAS released a
report that examined University
product procurement. They noted
the cost of recycled copy paper at
Central Stores was 72 cents more
per ream than virgin paper ($3.72
compared to $3).
The audit also stated that
between April 1989 and March
1990, 213,196 reams of copy paper
were sold by Central Stores. Of
those, just 1,219 were made of
recycled paper.
A further study released by
SEAS in February noted that
since Earth Day 1990, the use of
recycled paper has been steadily
increasing, but only 11 percent of
the paper used by campus depart
ments was recycled paper. It
reported that 26 of 70 academic
departments were ordering recy
cled paper.
"There's a lot of inertia in
paper ordering," Elliot said.
"They often just have a standing

order, and the people that order
often don't feel tney have the
power to make the change."
The Feb. 4 report also revealed
that recycled paper was not avail
able at any of the three copy cen
ters on campus.
An official at the Tresidder
Copy Center said that he was not
aware of the pricing change and
that recycled paper was still not
available there. But in response to
requests from some customers,
the center plans to make it avail
able in the future, according to
the official, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity.
"There's a big call" for recycled
paper, he said. "We've got to find a
way to get it to the customers
cheaper, though."
Bithell said Central Stores
already offers a line of "environ
mentally preferred products," and
is now working on expanding that
line to include such products as
paper towels, paper napkins and
toilet paper.
