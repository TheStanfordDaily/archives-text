One of the standard excuses for
ducking the rising tide of environ
mental consciousness has bitten
the dust, as the price of recycled
paper at the University's Central

to spur wider use of recycled
paper, is a result of growing
demand during the last year as
more academic departments and
campus offices have switched to
recycled paper despite higher
costs.

choice to use recycled paper,
because the cost was higher," said
Marianne Bithell, a public rela

ream of the recycled Matrix white
paper now costs $2.91, while vir
gin paper runs $3.09 per ream.
The change may have also been
prompted by research and pres

tal Action at Stanford. The group,
which has worked on the issue for
several years, wrote a letter last
month to Central Stores after
members were able to find recy

ream cheaper than Central
Stores' prices.
"Before we were trying to con

SEAS member. "It'll be much eas
ier now."
In May 1990, SEAS released a
report that examined University
product procurement. They noted
