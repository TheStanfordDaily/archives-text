# German studies grad students cancel plans to leave Stanford
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
The 19 German studies graduate stu
dents who threatened to leave Stanford if
two faculty vacancies were not filled by
fall quarter have put Marx, Mann and
Goethe back on their office shelves.
"The mass exodus is off," explained
Carl Hill, a spokesman for the formerly
discontented students, who had filed peti

tions for leaves of absence in late January.
The decision not to flee came after stu
dents learned right before spring break
that one of the two professors, Russell
Herman, would be returning to Stanford
next fall after a two-year leave of absence.
Hill said the students "breathed a big
sigh" of relief after learning that Berman
will return. "We're happy now," he added.
But fellow graduate student Ellen
Anderson said, "We're not completely sat

isfied."
The department should ensure thpt
someone will be hired if David Wellbery,
the other Stanford professor on leave,
does not return, Anderson said.
Department Chair Rob Robinson said
the University will fulfill its promise to
replace Wellbery if he does not come back.
But "The administration doesn't give a
damn," Anderson said, adding that it has
not been responsive to student needs. The

situation has been "extremely demoraliz
ing," she said.
She added that she is afraid that the
University could use Wellberv's departure
as an excuse to shrink the department,
which she said should actually be expand
ing.
"If there's no new blood, the depart
ment won't go anywhere," she said,
adding that most of the current German
studies faculty members are more than

50 years old.
Tension has eased in the department
since students learned that Berman will
be returning, Anderson said. She main
tained, however, that "it will take a while
for students to get back on track."
The absence of two prominent profes
sors may have delayed the progress of
some of the students, she said. Herman's
return is especially important
because he advises many students
on their dissertations, Anderson
added.
Robinson, however, said the

absence of Wellbery and Herman
"hasn't held anyone back."
Wellbery, currently teaching at
Johns Hopkins, has not yet
announced whether he will
return to Stanford in the fall, but
must make his decision by
August. "If Wellbery does come
back, things will be as good as you
can imagine," Robinson said.
