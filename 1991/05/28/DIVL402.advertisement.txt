GET
ANOTHER
MONTH OFF
THIS
SUMMER.
No. we're not giving you your own personal time warp
so you can finish perfecting your tan lines. But when you pay
for three months' storage at Shurgard, you get the fourth month
free. Which is almost as good. Because when you go home this
summer you won't have to try roping your plaid sofa and
dayglo bean bag chairs onto the back of your mountain bike.
