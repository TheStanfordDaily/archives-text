# Kimball tops all housing options
## New dorm beats out Toyon, Roble among four-class residences

It's time to pop the champagne or invest in
a few boxes of tissues. Draw results are in.
The new Kimball Hall went to students
with very low Draw numbers, as many people

as the most popular dormitory.
Responses from students who got into the
residence of their choice ranged from "totally
stoked" to "I can't believe it." But people who
missed their cuts tell a different story. Some
calmly said, "I'm going to cry," but others just

below 4,062 and women on or below 4,313

have been assigned on-campus housing.
In addition, all guaranteed graduate stu
dents were assigned space in their separate lot

the cutoff points were 1,582 for men and 556
for women.
Students who did not make it into a resi

said.

who want to live on campus ... in housing by
the beginning of fall quarter" because of 50
