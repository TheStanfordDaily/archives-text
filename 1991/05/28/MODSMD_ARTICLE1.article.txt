# Kimball tops all housing options
## New dorm beats out Toyon, Roble among four-class residences 
### Julie Cantor Staff writer 
It's time to pop the champagne or invest in
a few boxes of tissues. Draw results are in.
The new Kimball Hall went to students
with very low Draw numbers, as many people
expected, and displaced Roble and Toyon Halls
as the most popular dormitory.
Responses from students who got into the
residence of their choice ranged from "totally
stoked" to "I can't believe it." But people who
missed their cuts tell a different story. Some
calmly said, "I'm going to cry," but others just
screamed.
Housing Center Director Rodger Whitney

said everything went extremely well from the
moment nervous people picked numbers to the
time the computer printed out the fate of next
year's residents. This year's placements are
"nothing but good news," he said. "All the
numbers look good."
Ninety-two percent of students who
entered the Draw were assigned to housing, as
opposed to 90 percent last year. Only 289 stu
dents are still unassigned, allowing 51 more
students in to live on campus than last year.
Among the unassigned are 40 students who
had low numbers but made "picky" choices,
Whitney said.
Undergraduate men with numbers on or
below 4,062 and women on or below 4,313

have been assigned on-campus housing.
In addition, all guaranteed graduate stu
dents were assigned space in their separate lot
tery. Among unguaranteed graduate students,
the cutoff points were 1,582 for men and 556
for women.
Students who did not make it into a resi
dence should join the waiting list, Whitney
said.
"I think we'll get most, if not all, students
who want to live on campus ... in housing by
the beginning of fall quarter" because of 50
added spaces from the Theta Delta Chi house
— which was recently given up by the frater-
nity — and spaces from students
stopping out, he said.
This year 3,874 people entered
the Draw, an increase of about
100 over last year. Whitney
attributed the jump to the open
ing of Kimball Hall, which is
scheduled to be completed during

the summer.
"Whenever we open a new
housing piece on campus, there's
always a little bit more interest in
students living on campus," he
said. Kimball Hall cutoffs are also
the lowest — 362 and 347 were
the magic numbers for men and
women, respectively.
Other typically popular resi
dences, like Toyon and Roble,
took low numbers also. Toyon's

cutoffs are 1,003 and 1,397, while
Roble's are 916 and 795. Storey
House was highly coveted at
1,003 for men and 481 for
women.
558 Mayfield cutoffs have been
consistently dropping in recent
years, and this year, 1,366 for
men and 978 for women were the
last Draw numbers assigned
there. Lagunita Court residences
as well as ATO, Theta Chi,

Lambda Nu and Synergy were
also popular.
Changes in the guarantee sys
tem — students could simply
check a box on the Draw card to
designate a guaranteed year —
and in many priority systems
were a major improvement from
previous Draws, Whitney said.
Several houses, like the Ameri
can Studies House, added strin
gent regulations for obtaining a

priority one. "The priority houses
were strong and they generated
interest. . . . We also made the
system more meaningful," Whit
ney said.
He added that although many
thought this change would leave
vacancies in these residences, all
houses were filled.
In the American Studies
House, for example, virtually all
of the women assigned had prior

ity one. In order to qualify for the
priority, students had to propose a
theme project, agree to perform
cooking and cleaning duties and
to attend weekly two-hour semi
nars on American issues.
Competition among women
with priority two for a place in
American Studies House was
tight with a cutoff of 41. However,
the cutoff for men with priority
two reached 2877.
