# Campbell addresses indirect costs, abortion
## 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford, discussed
federal banking policy, a recent Supreme
Court decision on abortion counseling and the
University's indirect-cost situation Saturday
afternoon with nearly 100 of his constituents
at a town meeting.
Speaking in the Palo Alto City Council
chambers, Campbell, a Stanford law professor,
said both the University and the government
should be honest in assessing funding for uni
versity research.
"While some of Stanford's accounting prac
tices were unfair, the House committee made
several unfair and inaccurate statements
about the University, playing to the press," he
said, referring to the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations chaired by
Michigan Democrat John Dingell.
Campbell said he opposes government
"rifle-shot funding," or directing money to
specific major research projects, because such
a practice would not provide funds for the

basic research that occurs at the nation's uni
versities.
A member of the House Banking Commit
tee, Campbell discussed planned changes in
federal banking policy that would ensure that
the nation's banks "would not go the way of
the savings and loan associations."
He said he backs a proposal that will make
banks invest more money in the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the govern
mental body that insures depositors nation
wide. In exchange, banks will gain more pow
ers, including interstate branching, but will be
limited in the amount of risks that they can
take using depositors' money.
The key to this proposal is the creation of
bank holding companies that will ensure that
depositors' money is safe from risky invest
ments. This change will entail the greatest
restructuring of American financial institu
tions in the past 30 years, Campbell said.
Campbell also talked about the recent 5-4
Supreme Court decision upholding federal
restrictions on abortion counseling in federally
funded family-planning clinics. The clinics

cannot give advice about abortion without
risking the loss of federal funding.
The Supreme Court did not consider abor
tion counseling to be protected by the First
Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
Campbell, who is pro-choice, said he thinks
the Supreme Court will probably overturn Roe
v. Wade, the 1973 case that guarantees a
woman's right to abortion.
"It is likely, based on last week's decision,
that the Supreme Court will not allow abor
tion to be a fundamental right," he said.
Campbell went on to discuss the current
recession, forecasting that the nation's econ
omy would be undergoing a slow recovery by
the beginning of next year.
The government has increased the money
supply to the nation's banks in hopes that the
banks will increase lending, making more
money available to the economy. However,
banks have not been lending as much as antic
ipated.
If this trend continues, the nation can
expect inflation within the coming year. Camp
bell said.
