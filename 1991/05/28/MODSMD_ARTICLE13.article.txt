# No survivors found in Thailand air crash

Thailand (AP) â€” Searchers recovered more than
140 bodies yesterday and the vital flight data
recorders from an Austrian jet that blew up shortly
after takeoff from Bangkok with 223 people aboard.
No survivors were found.
In Hong Kong, Francz Karner, the Vienna-based
sales manager for Lauda Air, said a bomb probably
caused the explosion since the crew reported no
mechanical problems after takeoff. He offered no evi
dence, however, and other officials said the cause of
the blast was still a mystery.
The loss of Flight NGOO4 from Hong Kong to
Vienna was the first reported loss of a Boeing 767-
series and the 12th-worst commercial aviation disas
ter.
Somnuk Keetket, governor of Suphanburi
province, over which the explosion occurred, said an
exploding engine, a bomb planted on the plane, or
lightning could have caused the crash. He said a
storm was passing through the area at the time.
Officials in Bangkok earlier reported good weather
conditions.
An official in Bangkok for Lauda, Austria's
biggest air charter line, said yesterday night the
"black boxes" containing flight information were
found, but he did not know when they would be sent
to Bangkok for analysis.
During the Persian Gulf war, Western intelligence
pinpointed Bangkok as a possible staging site for ter
rorism; airport security subsequently was tightened.
At Hong Kong's Kai Tak International Airport, secu
rity has also been tight.
The twin-engine Boeing 767-300ER took off from
Bangkok's international airport at 10:45 p.m. Sun
day
