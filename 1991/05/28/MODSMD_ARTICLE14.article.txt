ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) —
Rebels moved easily into the capital and
attacked the presidential palace at day
break this morning, apparently seizing
control from a government that collapsed
under a three-month offensive.
The rebels entered the city just hours
after the government declared a cease-fire
and the United States, at peace talks it
was sponsoring in London, urged the
insurgents to enter the capital to restore
order.
Addis Ababa fell exactly a week after
the country's longtime Marxist president,
Mengistu Haile Mariam, resigned and
fled to Zimbabwe.
The rebels — some of whom have been
fighting since 1961 — reached the out
skirts of Addis Ababa over the weekend
and had encircled the city as government

soldiers deserted en masse.
It was not known early today if the
rebels had complete control of the city,
and the whereabouts of Lt. Gen. Tesfaye
Gebre-Kidan, the acting presdient, were
not immediately known.
The assault on the presidential palace
began at 5:25 a.m. as the rebels opened
fire with tanks, multiple rocket launchers
and automatic weapons. It could not be
determined if the palace was captured,
although a rebel spokesperson in London
said it was so.
The spokesperson, Assafa Mamo, said
rebels also had taken the radio station.
He said the only substantial fighting was
around the presidential palace.
Indeed, the rebels apparently met little
resistance elsewhere.
At the presidential palace, the rebels

appeared to concentrate their initial fire
on the guard posts and an ammunition
dump within the sprawling complex.
Within minutes, the dump exploded with
a ferocious roar.
Explosions from the ammunition
dump continued for more than an hour,
sending streams of deadly shrapnel hun
dreds of yards. Three large black columns
of smoke rose from the palace grounds.
Several thousand rebels took up posi
tions in an apartment complex two blocks
from the palace, apparently in anticipa
tion of an assault on the grounds, but
withdrew toward the city center an hour
after the assault began.
At least two rebels entered the lobby of
Hilton Hotel, next door to the apartment
complex, looked around, smiled and left.
They were wearing neat, khaki uniforms

with cuffed shorts and a blue sash across
their chests.
The fighting continued for two hours
before it appeared to slacken, the boom
ing of the tank cannons and the swishing
roar of the rockets replaced by scattered
small-arms fire.
The palace had been held by
Mengistu's elite guard, a force estimated
at between 1,500 and 3,000 that appeared
to be putting up the only real resistance
to the rebel takeover.
Reporters saw one government soldier
surrender to the rebels on the hill below
the palace. The insurgents took first his
gun, then his knapsack before leading
him away.
Of the at least half dozen tanks
involved in the assault on the palace,
about five withdrew down the hill toward

city center. One remained sitting in a
broad boulevard about 300 yards from
the palace.
Mamo, whose Ethiopian People's Rev
olutionary Democratic Front had been
sitting on the city's outskirts for about a
week, said the group marched on the city
to restore order.
"The city was out of control; there was
no government," he said. "There were
signs of disorder and looting, so we moved
in."
When asked how the rebels takeover
would affect peace talks in London, he
said: "Peace talks with whom?" He dis
missed Prime Minister Tesfaye Dinka as a
negotiating partner. "That prime minis
ter is no more a prime minister."
Mamo said there would "probably" be
some sort of peace talks today.
