## March of awareness 
### 
Tonight at i0:00 is the
annual Take Back the Night
March. Men and women alike
should join in the march to raise
campus awareness about sexual
assault. Even if you can't march,
you can put a candle in your win
dow to show your support.
Some people may be wondering
why such a march is necessary;
after all, isn't Stanford one of the
safest campuses in the country?
Perhaps, but that doesn't make it a
haven, and it is easy to get lulled
into an overconfident sense of secu
rity.
And although Stanford may
seem like the safest place on Earth,
the facts have proven otherwise.
Many students have already forgot
ten that just last year there were
three incidents of sexual assault
reported in the Foothills and one
near Sterling Quad.
One of the things the Take Back
the Night March is advocating is

more campus lighting and more
security patrols to make the cam
pus a safer place.
The new Council of Presidents
slate has promised to work on the
issue of sexual assault and has
already secured ASSU funding for
the position of Sexual Assault Pre
vention and Education Coordina
tor for next year.
The ASSU could go even farther
than this, promising to match Uni
versity funding in other realms of
assault prevention, like improved
campus lighting. Such a promise
would give the University a strong
financial incentive for making pre
vention and handling of sexual
assault a greater priority.
The Take Back the Night March
sends a powerful message to partic
ipants and non-participants alike
of the need for awareness of the
problem of sexual assault at Stan
ford.
