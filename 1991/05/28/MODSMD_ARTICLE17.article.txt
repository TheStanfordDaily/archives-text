# A 						necessary expense

### 
Nobody ever said that
life was easy ... or cheap.
The fact that Stanford is
paying $600,000 in accounting and
legal fees each month has been met
by stiff criticism from some of
Stanford's faculty. But while the
accounting and legal service costs
are high, they are also necessary.
Ultimately, the University has to
look out for its bottom line. The
administration would like to see
Stanford survive the indirect-cost
investigation with as little financial
fallout as possible. Thus, the nego
tiations concerning the Universi
ty's future recovery rate are of
paramount importance.
The accounting firm of Arthur
Andersen and Co. has experience
dealing with congressional over
seers, a necessary element that the
University must bring to the nego
tiation table.

The University also needs to for
mulate a new accounting procedure
which will not allow a repetition of
the mistakes of the past. Arthur
Andersen is implementing a new
system which will allow the Uni
versity to track individual expense.
The most obvious point is that
the University needs an overhaul
of its accounting practices. To recti
fy the present crisis, the University
would be shortsighted if it hired
anyone but the best.
Stanford should strive to be, in
University President Donald
Kennedy's words, a model for cost
recovery practices at the nation's
universities.
None of these things is cheap.
But the costs may ultimately pay
for themselves if the University
uses the information it gains to
negotiate a higher rate for cost
recovery.
