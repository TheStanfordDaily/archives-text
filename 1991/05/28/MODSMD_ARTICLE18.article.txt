Stanford's excellence is not limited to the classroom

I FEEL SAD FOR PEOPLE LIKE
Jesse Bart Blackwelder, whose letter,
titled "Stanford students are lazy,
content with mediocrity," ran in The
Daily last week. I feel sorry for him not
because I believe there's nothing wrong
with Stanford, but because he is so
trapped by his narrow concept of excel
lence. It's a shame that so many of us
view transcripts and test scores as the
primary indicators of our level of
achievement.
If this is your model of the ideal Stan
ford student, Blackwelder, please allow
me to be proud that I fall short of your
ideal. I don't think I need to apologize
that I won't graduate with a 4.0 grade
point average.
The problem is not Stanford's lack of
excellence, it is your overly limited defi

nition of what excellence is.
Excellence is certainly not limited to
academia, for millions have excelled
without the benefit of a high school edu
cation. Excellence is a pursuit, not an
accomplishment, and it therefore cannot
adequately be measured by a letter
grade.
Excellence is not getting an A+ on a
research paper; excellence is giving your
best effort in order to earn a C+. Excel
lence is taking time out of your own
studies to help someone else with their
homework. Excellence is questioning
institutionalized values and viewing the
world from others' perspectives. Excel
lence is the self-sacrifice one makes in
order to make one tiny niche in the
world a slightly better place for those

who live in it.
Furthermore, the "root of the Univer
sity" is not the classroom and the library,
but the people — the students, staff and
faculty — who constitute the University.
Although there is knowledge to be found
in CIV texts, there is also wisdom in that
food service worker you see every day
but have never spoken to.
If the classroom and the library have
been the primary sources of your educa
tion, you have denied yourself a wealth
of the knowledge and experiences avail
able here at Stanford.
Cultural events and other activities
are not merely "flowers," but indispens
able components of a complete educa
tion. Culture is the tinted window
through which we view everything. It
alters our perception of the world and

therefore must be recognized in order to
understand the inherent biases of the
conclusions we draw in the classroom.
Blackwelder rightfully believes that
students should challenge themselves at
Stanford; I couldn't agree more. In fact,
I have a challenge for him: Set aside
your studies for a while and go out and
live your education. Go talk to that per
son down the hall that you've never spo
ken to. Walk up to the Dish and contem
plate the immensity and fragility of the
Earth. Read the Bible. Listen to the
lyrics of a Public Enemy tape.
But most importantly, open your eyes.
There's a whole world outside that class
room just waiting for your excellence.
