# Let's 'reposition' those responsible for getting us into financial ruin
## 
### 
In my 33 years at Stanford I have
never witnessed such a tragic and outra
geous combination of incompetence and
arrogance in the higher echelons of the
University's administration as I have in
the past few months.
In the University's latest disclosure
we learned that approximately half a mil
lion dollars a month is being paid to an
outside firm to "revamp" Stanford's
accounting system. Lest that seem
"small potatoes" in the big-bucks world
of Stanford, let me elaborate: That's
almost the monthly salary and benefits
for 100 assistant professors.
Outside legal fees are running about
$100,000 a month, and to date we
haven't been told what the public rela
tions consultants, who so effectively pre
pared University President Donald

Kennedy for his congressional appear
ance, are being paid.
All of this, we are assured by Assoc.
Vice President for Public Affairs Larry
Horton, is because "we have no choice
but to get help from the very best to
meet our obligations . . . There's not a
frivolous dollar in there."
Meanwhile, back on the Farm, the
squeeze is on, and an Orwellian "reposi
tioning" is being used to cover up the
reality of layoffs. I would be the last to
quarrel with the idea of layoffs â€” Stan
ford badly needs layoffs. But how about
"repositioning" some of those responsi
ble for this mess?
Why not start with the University's
chief financial officer, then move on
immediately to the general counsel and
the vice president for public affairs?
Then, when the centennial circus has
ended, the last dancing bear has been fed
and watered, and the clowns have doffed
their costumes and removed their make
up, perhaps the University can get back
to what I thought this place was all

about way back in 1958 when I jour
neyed to Palo Alto in search of what used
to be called an education.
