# Senators' attitude of 'bylaws first' hurts efficacy of the senate
## 
### 
The senators who made "parliamen
tary masturbation" the trademark of the
ASSU Senate this year have been re
elected for their perennial terms in
office. These graduate students will be
easy to recognize in the new senate.
They'll be the ones making anal points
regarding procedure, at which even con
servative parliamentarians would scoff.
It was this powerful clique of Students
First senators that made it impossible
for the ASSU to fund its new Financial
Aid Lobby Office as it should have been
funded.

This entrenched clique has subverted
events and programs that students sin
cerely desire. Hiding behind their "stu
dents first" rhetoric, they function under
a "bylaws first" ideology which enables
them to cut funding to community ser
vice projects like the Delta Gamma soror
ity's Anchor Splash and the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority's Theta Breakers.
Furthermore, this clique is not con
tent with denying funds to the Greek
sponsored public service events; they
have also thwarted other efforts to fund
Chicanos in Health Education, BGLAD,
Latino Students Association and
Women's Center events.
The slap in the face to the DGs and
Thetas has served to reinforce what I
already knew about Students First. In
fact, after spending a year as an ASSU
senator, what has become chillingly clear
to me is that the most powerful members
of Students First often put all students
last.
