## Bush's valueless policy 
### 
Most foreign policy is
grounded in realpolitik. Advo
cates of this form of "realistic"
decision-making claim that international
politics is nasty and brutish, & la Hobbes,
and thus, each actor should look after its
own interests. Idealism and altruism
would only be exploited by other coun
tries.
The foreign policy actions of President
Bush's administration fit this paradigm
to a tee. However, in justifying them,
Bush often feigns the very idealism they
deny. Sadly, many people are all too eager
to accept his explanations, even when
they bear little relationship to reality
Many people have found my claims
that the Gulf war was fought mainly for
geopolitical reasons callously cynical. My
mention of oil interests, Bush's desire to
strengthen the United States' (military)
presence in the Middle East and the Pen
tagon's fear of the peace dividend brought
forth impassioned declarations about
bully dictators invading small, vulnerable
countries and innocent Kuwaiti citizens
being tortured and killed.
Despicable though Saddam Hussein
undeniably is, this does little to explain
the rapid escalation of U.S. involvement
and the failure to give sanctions a chance.
After all, to parody a common phrase,
some of Bush's best friends are despica
ble.
It was argued that the United States
was defending democracy and the Ameri
can way of life. In Kuwait's 1985 elec
tions, only 90,000 men out of about 2 mil
lion people were eligible to vote, and an
extension of suffrage does not seem immi

nent. Kuwait's government is now trying
to get rid of "outsiders," especially Pales
tinians, who have lived in the country for
decades.
Last week a man was sentenced to 15
years in prison for wearing a T-shirt
depicting Saddam. The rulers, while
maintaining their opulent lifestyle, so far
have done little to rebuild the country. Is
theirs a "way of life" worth more than
$50 billion to defend?
The vaunted concern for people dying
at the hands of Iraqi troops rings simi
larly hollow. Even disregarding the tens
of thousands of Iraqi soldiers who died in
the war, the number of innocent victims
— Iraqi civilians and Kurdish refugees —
killed since the beginning of the fighting
most likely exceeds the number of
Kuwaitis killed during the occupation.
If human life really were a concern of
the present administration, Bangladesh
would be a better place to spend money.
The recent cyclone claimed the lives of an
estimated 139,000 people. Even without
such natural disasters, more than
260,000 Bangladesh children under the
age of 5 die each year of diarrhea alone,
and hundreds of thousands more suc
cumb to other "innocent" diseases.
Although Bangladesh is more demo
cratic than Kuwait, the U.S. government,
as of last week, had committed only $7
million to help alleviate the suffering, a
paltry fraction of the estimated $2 billion
needed to address the effects of the
cyclone. In contrast, Bush was more than
happy to spend nearly $2 billion per day
fighting the Gulf war.
The Tomahawk missiles launched

against Iraq during the war cost about as
much as the total food aid needed by
Ethiopia in a year. The price of a single
bomb dropped by a B-52 bomber during
the war (one of thousands, most of which
missed their targets) could fund a health
clinic for 4,060 patients in Bangladesh for
a month, or set up a self-running medical
system for a rural population of 100,000.
The cost of the 23 Patriot missiles fired
in the first three weeks of this year equals
Amnesty International's 1990 budget.
And all these are just minute fractions of
the overall cost of the war, which together
with the cost of rebuilding Kuwait and
Iraq runs at about $200 billion.
Bush has ignored democratic and
American values in his foreign policy so
often that it is a wonder anybody still
accepts his explanations. While govern
ments will always pursue geopolitical
objectives, I hope the next election will
bring a government that does so both less
callously and less hypocritically.
