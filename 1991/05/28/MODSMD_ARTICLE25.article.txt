## California tandem stands in the way of doubles double 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Jonathan Stark and Jared Palmer
came the closest of any recent Cardinal
doubles team to putting an asterisk next
to asst. coach John Whitlinger's name.
But Cal's Bent-Ove Pedersen and Matt
Lucena guaranteed the former collegiate
great's place in the Stanford record books
for at least one more year.
Stark and Palmer came within one vic
tory of ending Stanford's 16-year drought
in NCAA doubles titles.
Thanks to Pedersen and Lucena's
spectacular play the championship con
tinues to be beyond Stanford's grasp. And

Whitlinger, with partner Jim Delaney,
remains the last Stanford competitor to
give the Farm a national doubles crown.
The Golden Bear duo's amazing play
in the NCAA doubles final Sunday
evening downed Stanford's talented
sophomore tandem 6-2, 7-5 (8-6).
The loss marred a fantastic week of
tennis by Palmer, a week which almost
made him only the third Stanford com
petitor to win collegiate tennis' doubles
crown.
In fact, the defeat in doubles detracted
from Palmer's excitement over winning
the singles title earlier in the day. But not
because he failed to reach the Cardinal
tennis milestone.

"Losing in doubles really hurts. I
would have really liked to get Jon up
there fin Stanford record books] with
me," Palmer said.
The loss was not a result of Cardinal
ineptitude. Stark and Palmer, winners of
the All-American, Pacific-10 Conference
and Pacific Coast doubles titles earlier in
the season, were playing their best tennis
of the year.
Pedersen and Lucena simply played
incredibly.
"We played a good doubles match; one
that would have beat almost any team in
the tournament" Palmer said. "I can't say
enough about them. They played beauti
fully."

Pedersen and Lucena hit the courts on
fire. Stark and Palmer played well, but
they were no match in the first set for the
flaming Bears. The Cal tandem broke
Stanford early, then broke them again.
Pedersen's serves were bullets, Lucena
volleyed like a madman and both did any
thing they desired with service returns.
They completely eliminated any service
advantage Stark and Palmer should have
had.
"Jon and I could tell from the first
serve they were on top. They were moving
serves around, sticking volleys and hit
ting with confidence," Palmer said. "We
did everything we could and we came up
short."

After going down swinging 6-2 in the
first, Stark and Palmer did manage to get
back in the match in stanza No. 2, almost
sending the match to three sets.
Pedersen and Lucena still held the
advantage, going up on almost every
Stanford serve, but Stark and Palmer
fought back and hung on.
After staying with the Bears the entire
set, Stark and Palmer were broken at 5-5.
Down 5-6, the Cardinal tandem broke
back, sending the set into a tiebreaker.
Stanford even went ahead in the
breaker, but Cal was just too sharp. Stark
served for the set at 6-5, but Lucena hit
an amazing return to swing the
momentum back into the Bears'
court, and the Cal duo won the
next three points to take the
breaker, set and match.
"Jon can't hit a better serve
than that," coach Dick Gould
said. "But they just played too
well. Pedersen played great — as
good of doubles as anyone can
possibly play. He just dominated
the match."
The Cardinal duo played as
well in the semis Satdurday as in

the finals, and had a victory over
another conference opponent to
show for it. Stanford held off a
tenacious Mark Knowles and
Fritz Bissell in the round of four
6-4, 6-3.
UCLA's top doubles team
hung with Stark and Palmer, but
a couple of timely breaks sent
Stanford to the finals.
"It was very close. We both
played well — we just got a lucky
break in each set and held on,
Palmer said.
Alex O'Brien was not as lucky
in his semifinal singles match.
The tenacious baseliner hung
tough all week, but came up short
against fellow slugger Patricio

Arnold Saturday afternoon.
O'Brien played well, but the
sophomore from Georgia played
better. And had more left after a
grueling week of competition.
Arnold dominated the first set,
downing Stanford's No. 1 6-2 in a
classic baseline duel. O'Brien's
fighting spirit once again kicked
in, however, and Stanford's wily
competitor almost sent the match
into three sets.
O'Brien clawed his way back
into the match, serving for set No.
2 at 5-4, but just couldn't hang
on. He double-faulted twice, and
the match was Arnold's.
"0.8. had a tough match. Alex
was a little tired and Patricio

played really well. He was just on
fire," Stark said.
After making quick work of
Alejo Mancisidor of Pepperdine 6-
2, 6-3 in the third round and anni
hilating Arizona State's Brian
Gyetko 6-2, 6-1, O'Brien had been
on track to make it an all-Cardi
nal final.
O'Brien and partner Jason Yee
were also one of Pedersen and
Lucena's victims. Stanford's No.
2 doubles team was unseeded and
ran into the Bear brick wall Fri
day.
O'Brien and Yee's scrappy play
was no match for the attacking
Pedersen and Lucena, and Stan
ford went down easily 6-1, 6-3.
