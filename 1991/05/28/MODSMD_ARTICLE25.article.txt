## California tandem stands in the way of doubles double 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
Jonathan Stark and Jared Palmer
came the closest of any recent Cardinal
doubles team to putting an asterisk next
to asst. coach John Whitlinger's name.
But Cal's Bent-Ove Pedersen and Matt
Lucena guaranteed the former collegiate
great's place in the Stanford record books
for at least one more year.
Stark and Palmer came within one vic
tory of ending Stanford's 16-year drought
in NCAA doubles titles.
Thanks to Pedersen and Lucena's
spectacular play the championship con
tinues to be beyond Stanford's grasp. And

Whitlinger, with partner Jim Delaney,
remains the last Stanford competitor to
give the Farm a national doubles crown.
The Golden Bear duo's amazing play
in the NCAA doubles final Sunday
evening downed Stanford's talented
sophomore tandem 6-2, 7-5 (8-6).
The loss marred a fantastic week of
tennis by Palmer, a week which almost
made him only the third Stanford com
petitor to win collegiate tennis' doubles
crown.
In fact, the defeat in doubles detracted
from Palmer's excitement over winning
the singles title earlier in the day. But not
because he failed to reach the Cardinal
tennis milestone.

"Losing in doubles really hurts. I
would have really liked to get Jon up
there fin Stanford record books] with
me," Palmer said.
The loss was not a result of Cardinal
ineptitude. Stark and Palmer, winners of
the All-American, Pacific-10 Conference
and Pacific Coast doubles titles earlier in
the season, were playing their best tennis
of the year.
Pedersen and Lucena simply played
incredibly.
"We played a good doubles match; one
that would have beat almost any team in
the tournament" Palmer said. "I can't say
enough about them. They played beauti
fully."

Pedersen and Lucena hit the courts on
fire. Stark and Palmer played well, but
they were no match in the first set for the
flaming Bears. The Cal tandem broke
Stanford early, then broke them again.
Pedersen's serves were bullets, Lucena
volleyed like a madman and both did any
thing they desired with service returns.
They completely eliminated any service
advantage Stark and Palmer should have
had.
"Jon and I could tell from the first
serve they were on top. They were moving
serves around, sticking volleys and hit
ting with confidence," Palmer said. "We
did everything we could and we came up
short."

After going down swinging 6-2 in the
first, Stark and Palmer did manage to get
back in the match in stanza No. 2, almost
sending the match to three sets.
Pedersen and Lucena still held the
advantage, going up on almost every
Stanford serve, but Stark and Palmer
fought back and hung on.
After staying with the Bears the entire
set, Stark and Palmer were broken at 5-5.
Down 5-6, the Cardinal tandem broke
back, sending the set into a tiebreaker.
Stanford even went ahead in the
breaker, but Cal was just too sharp. Stark
served for the set at 6-5, but Lucena hit
