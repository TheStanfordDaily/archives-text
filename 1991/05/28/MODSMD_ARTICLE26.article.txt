# Bulldogs down baseball twice in NCAA regionals
## 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Saturday night in Fresno the roller
coaster ride called the Stanford baseball
team closed down for the season. Like the
up-and-down season that had preceded it,
the West II Regional proved the one thing
the Cardinal lacked this season was consis
tancy.
With a 7-5 loss to Fresno State in the
tournament's ninth game, Stanford ended
the regional going W-L-W-L. As was the
:ase during the year, the Cardinal was
unable to string together enough big wins
to enjoy any prolonged sucess.
After beating San Diego State to open
the tournament with a victory, the Cardinal
lost to Fresno 4-2 Friday night, but
rebounded with a 22-hit, 15-7 thrashing of
No. 1 seed Miami on Saturday to earn the
right to face the Bulldogs once again. Yet
symbolic of the year as a whole, the end
proved to be frustrating.
In the bottom of the ninth Roger Bur
nett stepped up to the plate with the bases
loaded and one out. With Stanford only
iown by two, the scenerio was great. The
result, however, was a heartbreaker. The
\II-America shortstop hit the ball hard, but
"ight at his Fresno State counterpart for a
3-4-3 double play to end the game and the
season. The Cardinal finished the year at
39-23.
"We've had some ups and downs this sea
son, but I don't consider this game a down,"

said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
thought it was a great game and I'm proud
of the way we played."
As in all the games they played during
the weekend, the Cardinal was forced into a
frustating game of catch-up. Late in the
game Stanford found itself down 7-1, a
deficit that was not due to a lack of contact
with the ball. Going into the seventh inning
Bulldog starter Jim Patterson had a three
hitter, but had yielded five warning-track
shots, three that were caught at the wall.
Only David McCarty's third-inning 450-
foot monster of a home run managed to
clear the fence.
"We hit the ball well tonight," said
McCarty, who will be named the the Base
ball America Player of the Year on Thurs
day. "We hit it just as hard as we did against
Miami. Fresno State made great plays. We
hit the ball hard and right at them."
Stanford did not get any breaks until the
seventh inning when Patterson loaded the
bases and Fresno State coach Bob Bennett
went to his bullpen and came out with a
godsend for the Cardinal. Tommy Minor
came in to save the day, but instead walked
McCarty on four pitches and brought in the
second Stanford run of the day.
Minor followed this up with a wild pitch
that scored Matt Bokemeier, and then gave
way to Mike Salazar. Salazar got the next
two batters out to end the inning, but not
before David Holbrook scored on a Ryan
