# Bulldogs down baseball twice in NCAA regionals
## 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Saturday night in Fresno the roller
coaster ride called the Stanford baseball
team closed down for the season. Like the
up-and-down season that had preceded it,
the West II Regional proved the one thing
the Cardinal lacked this season was consis
tancy.
With a 7-5 loss to Fresno State in the
tournament's ninth game, Stanford ended
the regional going W-L-W-L. As was the
:ase during the year, the Cardinal was
unable to string together enough big wins
to enjoy any prolonged sucess.
After beating San Diego State to open
the tournament with a victory, the Cardinal
lost to Fresno 4-2 Friday night, but
rebounded with a 22-hit, 15-7 thrashing of
No. 1 seed Miami on Saturday to earn the
right to face the Bulldogs once again. Yet
symbolic of the year as a whole, the end
proved to be frustrating.
In the bottom of the ninth Roger Bur
nett stepped up to the plate with the bases
loaded and one out. With Stanford only
iown by two, the scenerio was great. The
result, however, was a heartbreaker. The
\II-America shortstop hit the ball hard, but
"ight at his Fresno State counterpart for a
3-4-3 double play to end the game and the
season. The Cardinal finished the year at
39-23.
"We've had some ups and downs this sea
son, but I don't consider this game a down,"

said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
thought it was a great game and I'm proud
of the way we played."
As in all the games they played during
the weekend, the Cardinal was forced into a
frustating game of catch-up. Late in the
game Stanford found itself down 7-1, a
deficit that was not due to a lack of contact
with the ball. Going into the seventh inning
Bulldog starter Jim Patterson had a three
hitter, but had yielded five warning-track
shots, three that were caught at the wall.
Only David McCarty's third-inning 450-
foot monster of a home run managed to
clear the fence.
"We hit the ball well tonight," said
McCarty, who will be named the the Base
ball America Player of the Year on Thurs
day. "We hit it just as hard as we did against
Miami. Fresno State made great plays. We
hit the ball hard and right at them."
Stanford did not get any breaks until the
seventh inning when Patterson loaded the
bases and Fresno State coach Bob Bennett
went to his bullpen and came out with a
godsend for the Cardinal. Tommy Minor
came in to save the day, but instead walked
McCarty on four pitches and brought in the
second Stanford run of the day.
Minor followed this up with a wild pitch
that scored Matt Bokemeier, and then gave
way to Mike Salazar. Salazar got the next
two batters out to end the inning, but not
before David Holbrook scored on a Ryan

Chris Kemper receives a hero's welcome at the plate after his three-run homer gave Stanford a 7-4 lead over Miami Sat
urday In the West II Regional. Stanford went on to win that game but a serious knee injury ended Kemper's season a few
innings later.
Turner ground-out to make it 7-3.
With Scott Weiss pitching a
great game in relief of starter
John Reid, the momentum had
swung to the Cardinal. In the bot
tom of the ninth when McCarty
lifted a double to left to score Hol
brook and bring the game within
two, it seemed ike Stanford
might pull it out. iammonds fol
lowed with a single to center, and
then Turner waked to fill the
bases.
The tension was high, but
Salazar got Burrett to hit into the
double play for hs first save of the
year. Fresno SUte would go on to
beat Cal State-<Jorthridge for the
regional title aid the right to go to
the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb.
"You have o give Fresno State
all the credi," said Marquess.
"They got thi key hits and made
the big they needed to.
That was tie difference in the
game. They beat us four out of
five times tlis season so you have
to say this i not a fluke."
The Buldogs took two out
three at Sinken Diamond during
the season and before Saturday's
win, theycontinued their domi
nence ove?Stanford with a victory

in Friday's evening game. Fresh
man Willie Adams was the only
Cardinal pitcher to have beaten
the Bulldogs this year, and he
actually pitched well enough to
win again. Adams put in a com
plete-game eight-hitter, with only
two of the four runs he gave up
being earned. But as would be the
case in Saturday's game, Fresno
Sate got just enough breaks to
win.
"They did a good job of hitting
the ball on the ground," said
Adams. "They only hit a few in
the air all game. They found the
holes in the infield."
They also had some help from
the Cardinal. In the second inning
Hammonds threw wide of catcher
Troy Tallman while trying to
make a play at home, in the pro
cess allowing Chris Falco to
stretch a single all the way to
third base and eventually score.
Holbrook would later throw
wide of McCarty at first, a play
that wound up allowing Todd
Johnson to get on base via a
fielder's choice. Johnson would
then score, and those third and
fourth error-produced runs were
all Fresno State starter Robbie
Saitz needed for the win. Saitz
matched Adams' complete game
with an outing that was not over
powering, but more than got the
job done.
"1 felt that Saitz had control of

the whole game," said Ham
monds. "He set the tempo of the
game early on. In the sixth, he
went more to the curve ball and
we had to respect that. He pitched
a hell of a game."
Stanford rebounded the next
day for a big win over Miami in a
do-or-die situation for both clubs.
Facing elimination, the Cardinal
came back from a 4-1 first-inning
deficit to pound the Miami pitch
ers for 15 runs on 22 hits and the
eventual victory. In a game that
saw Hammonds be the only
starter not to collect at least two
hits, the big blow came in the
fourth when Chris Kemper took a
1-2 pitch over the left-field wall
for a three-run homer.
Kemper's shot put his team
ahead 7-4 and they would never
trail again. Aaron Dorlarque came
in as relief after having pitched in
Thursday's opener and allowed
only one hit over the last four
innings. The win improved Dor
larque to 9-2 on the year.
"I felt I had command of all my
pitches today," said Dorlarque
after the game. "Even though we
fell behind, I think the entire
team knew we could come back."
A feat they unfortunately could
not repeat. Stanford was forced to
be back on the field four hours
after disposing of Miami, only to
find they could not solve the
Fresno State riddle. The Cardinal

beat Cal State-<Jorthridge for the
regional title aid the right to go to
the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb.
"You have o give Fresno State
all the credi," said Marquess.
"They got thi key hits and made
the big they needed to.
That was tie difference in the
game. They beat us four out of
five times tlis season so you have
to say this i not a fluke."
The Buldogs took two out
three at Sinken Diamond during
the season and before Saturday's
win, theycontinued their domi
nence ove?Stanford with a victory

in Friday's evening game. Fresh
man Willie Adams was the only
Cardinal pitcher to have beaten
the Bulldogs this year, and he
actually pitched well enough to
win again. Adams put in a com
plete-game eight-hitter, with only
two of the four runs he gave up
being earned. But as would be the
case in Saturday's game, Fresno
Sate got just enough breaks to
win.
"They did a good job of hitting
the ball on the ground," said
Adams. "They only hit a few in
the air all game. They found the
holes in the infield."
They also had some help from
the Cardinal. In the second inning
Hammonds threw wide of catcher
Troy Tallman while trying to
make a play at home, in the pro
cess allowing Chris Falco to
stretch a single all the way to
third base and eventually score.
Holbrook would later throw
wide of McCarty at first, a play
that wound up allowing Todd
Johnson to get on base via a
fielder's choice. Johnson would
then score, and those third and
fourth error-produced runs were
all Fresno State starter Robbie
Saitz needed for the win. Saitz
matched Adams' complete game
with an outing that was not over
powering, but more than got the
job done.
"1 felt that Saitz had control of

the whole game," said Ham
monds. "He set the tempo of the
game early on. In the sixth, he
went more to the curve ball and
we had to respect that. He pitched
a hell of a game."
Stanford rebounded the next
day for a big win over Miami in a
do-or-die situation for both clubs.
Facing elimination, the Cardinal
came back from a 4-1 first-inning
deficit to pound the Miami pitch
ers for 15 runs on 22 hits and the
eventual victory. In a game that
saw Hammonds be the only
starter not to collect at least two
hits, the big blow came in the
fourth when Chris Kemper took a
1-2 pitch over the left-field wall
for a three-run homer.
Kemper's shot put his team
ahead 7-4 and they would never
trail again. Aaron Dorlarque came
in as relief after having pitched in
Thursday's opener and allowed
only one hit over the last four
innings. The win improved Dor
larque to 9-2 on the year.
"I felt I had command of all my
pitches today," said Dorlarque
after the game. "Even though we
fell behind, I think the entire
team knew we could come back."
A feat they unfortunately could
not repeat. Stanford was forced to
be back on the field four hours
after disposing of Miami, only to
find they could not solve the
Fresno State riddle. The Cardinal

Saturday night in Fresno the roller
coaster ride called the Stanford baseball
team closed down for the season. Like the
up-and-down season that had preceded it,
the West II Regional proved the one thing
the Cardinal lacked this season was consis
tancy.
With a 7-5 loss to Fresno State in the
tournament's ninth game, Stanford ended
the regional going W-L-W-L. As was the
:ase during the year, the Cardinal was
unable to string together enough big wins
to enjoy any prolonged sucess.
After beating San Diego State to open
the tournament with a victory, the Cardinal
lost to Fresno 4-2 Friday night, but
rebounded with a 22-hit, 15-7 thrashing of
No. 1 seed Miami on Saturday to earn the
right to face the Bulldogs once again. Yet
symbolic of the year as a whole, the end
proved to be frustrating.
In the bottom of the ninth Roger Bur
nett stepped up to the plate with the bases
loaded and one out. With Stanford only
iown by two, the scenerio was great. The
result, however, was a heartbreaker. The
\II-America shortstop hit the ball hard, but
"ight at his Fresno State counterpart for a
3-4-3 double play to end the game and the
season. The Cardinal finished the year at
39-23.
"We've had some ups and downs this sea
son, but I don't consider this game a down,"

said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
thought it was a great game and I'm proud
of the way we played."
As in all the games they played during
the weekend, the Cardinal was forced into a
frustating game of catch-up. Late in the
game Stanford found itself down 7-1, a
deficit that was not due to a lack of contact
with the ball. Going into the seventh inning
Bulldog starter Jim Patterson had a three
hitter, but had yielded five warning-track
shots, three that were caught at the wall.
Only David McCarty's third-inning 450-
foot monster of a home run managed to
clear the fence.
"We hit the ball well tonight," said
McCarty, who will be named the the Base
ball America Player of the Year on Thurs
day. "We hit it just as hard as we did against
Miami. Fresno State made great plays. We
hit the ball hard and right at them."
Stanford did not get any breaks until the
seventh inning when Patterson loaded the
bases and Fresno State coach Bob Bennett
went to his bullpen and came out with a
godsend for the Cardinal. Tommy Minor
came in to save the day, but instead walked
McCarty on four pitches and brought in the
second Stanford run of the day.
Minor followed this up with a wild pitch
that scored Matt Bokemeier, and then gave
way to Mike Salazar. Salazar got the next
two batters out to end the inning, but not
before David Holbrook scored on a Ryan

Chris Kemper receives a hero's welcome at the plate after his three-run homer gave Stanford a 7-4 lead over Miami Sat
urday In the West II Regional. Stanford went on to win that game but a serious knee injury ended Kemper's season a few
innings later.
Turner ground-out to make it 7-3.
With Scott Weiss pitching a
great game in relief of starter
John Reid, the momentum had
swung to the Cardinal. In the bot
tom of the ninth when McCarty
lifted a double to left to score Hol
brook and bring the game within
two, it seemed ike Stanford
might pull it out. iammonds fol
lowed with a single to center, and
then Turner waked to fill the
bases.
The tension was high, but
Salazar got Burrett to hit into the

Saturday night in Fresno the roller
coaster ride called the Stanford baseball
team closed down for the season. Like the
up-and-down season that had preceded it,
the West II Regional proved the one thing
the Cardinal lacked this season was consis
tancy.
With a 7-5 loss to Fresno State in the
tournament's ninth game, Stanford ended
the regional going W-L-W-L. As was the
:ase during the year, the Cardinal was
unable to string together enough big wins
to enjoy any prolonged sucess.
After beating San Diego State to open
the tournament with a victory, the Cardinal
lost to Fresno 4-2 Friday night, but
rebounded with a 22-hit, 15-7 thrashing of
No. 1 seed Miami on Saturday to earn the
right to face the Bulldogs once again. Yet
symbolic of the year as a whole, the end
proved to be frustrating.
In the bottom of the ninth Roger Bur
nett stepped up to the plate with the bases
loaded and one out. With Stanford only
iown by two, the scenerio was great. The
result, however, was a heartbreaker. The
\II-America shortstop hit the ball hard, but
"ight at his Fresno State counterpart for a
3-4-3 double play to end the game and the
season. The Cardinal finished the year at
39-23.
"We've had some ups and downs this sea
son, but I don't consider this game a down,"

said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "I
thought it was a great game and I'm proud
of the way we played."
As in all the games they played during
the weekend, the Cardinal was forced into a
frustating game of catch-up. Late in the
game Stanford found itself down 7-1, a
deficit that was not due to a lack of contact
with the ball. Going into the seventh inning
Bulldog starter Jim Patterson had a three
hitter, but had yielded five warning-track
shots, three that were caught at the wall.
Only David McCarty's third-inning 450-
foot monster of a home run managed to
clear the fence.
"We hit the ball well tonight," said
McCarty, who will be named the the Base
ball America Player of the Year on Thurs
day. "We hit it just as hard as we did against
Miami. Fresno State made great plays. We
hit the ball hard and right at them."
Stanford did not get any breaks until the
seventh inning when Patterson loaded the
bases and Fresno State coach Bob Bennett
went to his bullpen and came out with a
godsend for the Cardinal. Tommy Minor
came in to save the day, but instead walked
McCarty on four pitches and brought in the
second Stanford run of the day.
Minor followed this up with a wild pitch
that scored Matt Bokemeier, and then gave
way to Mike Salazar. Salazar got the next
two batters out to end the inning, but not
before David Holbrook scored on a Ryan

Chris Kemper receives a hero's welcome at the plate after his three-run homer gave Stanford a 7-4 lead over Miami Sat
urday In the West II Regional. Stanford went on to win that game but a serious knee injury ended Kemper's season a few
innings later.
Turner ground-out to make it 7-3.
With Scott Weiss pitching a
great game in relief of starter
John Reid, the momentum had
swung to the Cardinal. In the bot
tom of the ninth when McCarty
lifted a double to left to score Hol
brook and bring the game within
two, it seemed ike Stanford
might pull it out. iammonds fol
lowed with a single to center, and
then Turner waked to fill the
bases.
The tension was high, but
Salazar got Burrett to hit into the
double play for hs first save of the
year. Fresno SUte would go on to
beat Cal State-<Jorthridge for the
regional title aid the right to go to
the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb.
"You have o give Fresno State
all the credi," said Marquess.
"They got thi key hits and made
the big they needed to.
That was tie difference in the
game. They beat us four out of
five times tlis season so you have
to say this i not a fluke."
The Buldogs took two out
three at Sinken Diamond during
the season and before Saturday's
win, theycontinued their domi
nence ove?Stanford with a victory

in Friday's evening game. Fresh
man Willie Adams was the only
Cardinal pitcher to have beaten
the Bulldogs this year, and he
actually pitched well enough to
win again. Adams put in a com
plete-game eight-hitter, with only
two of the four runs he gave up
being earned. But as would be the
case in Saturday's game, Fresno
Sate got just enough breaks to
win.
"They did a good job of hitting
the ball on the ground," said
Adams. "They only hit a few in
the air all game. They found the
holes in the infield."
They also had some help from
the Cardinal. In the second inning
Hammonds threw wide of catcher
Troy Tallman while trying to
make a play at home, in the pro
cess allowing Chris Falco to
stretch a single all the way to
third base and eventually score.
Holbrook would later throw
wide of McCarty at first, a play
that wound up allowing Todd
Johnson to get on base via a
fielder's choice. Johnson would
then score, and those third and
fourth error-produced runs were
all Fresno State starter Robbie
Saitz needed for the win. Saitz
matched Adams' complete game
with an outing that was not over
powering, but more than got the
job done.
"1 felt that Saitz had control of

the whole game," said Ham
monds. "He set the tempo of the
game early on. In the sixth, he
went more to the curve ball and
we had to respect that. He pitched
a hell of a game."
Stanford rebounded the next
day for a big win over Miami in a
do-or-die situation for both clubs.
Facing elimination, the Cardinal
came back from a 4-1 first-inning
deficit to pound the Miami pitch
ers for 15 runs on 22 hits and the
eventual victory. In a game that
saw Hammonds be the only
starter not to collect at least two
hits, the big blow came in the
fourth when Chris Kemper took a
1-2 pitch over the left-field wall
for a three-run homer.
Kemper's shot put his team
ahead 7-4 and they would never
trail again. Aaron Dorlarque came
in as relief after having pitched in
Thursday's opener and allowed
only one hit over the last four
innings. The win improved Dor
larque to 9-2 on the year.
"I felt I had command of all my
pitches today," said Dorlarque
after the game. "Even though we
fell behind, I think the entire
team knew we could come back."
A feat they unfortunately could
not repeat. Stanford was forced to
be back on the field four hours
after disposing of Miami, only to
find they could not solve the
Fresno State riddle. The Cardinal
