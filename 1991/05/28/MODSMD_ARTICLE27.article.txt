# Women golfers swing to sixth-place finish at NCAAs
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Jodi Figley came into the NCAA
Women's Golf Championships knowing
that the end of her collegiate was immi
nently near. And when the 72-hole tour
nament concluded Saturday everyone
knew that she had gone out in style.
Figley shot a one-over-par 73 on the
final 18 holes to solidify herself among
the elite of college golf with a share of
eighth place individually and a four-day
total of 298. "I wanted to finish in the top
10 and I did it," she said.
But more importantly, Figley dug deep
to lead the sixth-ranked Cardinal to
within two strokes of a top-five finish.
UCLA outdueled top-ranked San Jose
State in a playoff to take the title. Both
finished 27 strokes ahead of the Cardinal
at 1197.
After having shot a 312 Wednesday, the
Cardinal climbed from 11th to 10th to
sixth place entering the final round. Sixth
place has been a familiar spot for the Car
dinal the last couple years going into the
last 18 holes. Two years ago, in Figley's
sophomore campaign, the Cardinal slid

from sixth to 10th in the final round. And
last year was much of the same as the
Cardinal fell three notches to a ninth
place finish upon entering the final 18 in
sixth.
But the linksters were not about to set
a pattern for themselves. Despite drop
ping off from Friday's 302 to shoot a 305
Saturday, the Cardinal made a move on
the top five, but came up a few strokes
short of Georgia's fifth-place 1222.
"We made up some ground even
though we stayed in sixth," junior
Martha Richards said of the squad's
seven-stroke gain on Georgia. "It's a
move in the right direction and a confi
dence builder for the team."
The women's golf team's sixth-place
finish matched its best performance ever
in the NCAA tourney. "Everyone is pretty
pleased," Figley said. "We played up to
our ranking. Everyone on the team could
think of two shots that they could've
knocked off, but that's the way it goes. We
didn't do anything spectacular, but we did
enough to finish strong."
Figley never really had a bad day with
the exception of shooting a seven-over
par 43 on the front nine holes Wednesday.

She bounced back to record scores of 78,
73, 74 and 73, to finish eight strokes
behind individual winner Annika Soren
stam of Arizona.
"I didn't make many mistakes," Figley
said. "The last three days I could have
easily broken par, but I missed a couple of
putts."
However, the Cardinal could never
have finished anywhere within the neigh
borhood of sixth without Richards. Com
ing onto the golf team in April after com
peting in the Final Four with the
women's basketball team, Richards
struggled for much of the time, but coach
Tim Baldwin continued to believe that it
was just a matter of time before Richards
would make a dramatic impact as a strong
fifth player.
And when it counted, Richards came
alive.
She led off the first round with a 10-
over-par 82, but she felt like she was hit
ting well and needed to just attack more.
And attack she did.
On Thursday, she made up four
strokes to finish with a 78; in the third
round, she drilled her tournament-best
74 to propel the Cardinal from 10th to

sixth; and in the final day of play,
Richards nailed a 76 to finish the tourna
ment with a 310, third-best on the Cardi
nal squad.
"We would have easily finished 10th
without Martha," Figley said.
"Tim [Baldwin] gave me the chance to
play and I was able to capitalize on it,"
Richards said. "I haven't felt like I made
much of a contribution to the team effort,
but it really felt good."
The long course suited the long-driv
ing Richards' game well. "Instead of try
ing to only make par, I wanted to make
birdie," she said. "I didn't birdie or par
every hole, but I executed really well."
Junior Adele Moore, selected as a sec
ond-team Ail-American, was somewhat
disappointed and frustrated with her per
formance, but her 72-hole total of 306 —
after rounds of 76, 78, 76 and 76 — pro
vided the team with steady consistency.
"I had a solid week on the course," said
Moore, who finished 26th overall. "I just
couldn't make my putts. It's difficult to
shave off the last few strokes making the
difference between a 76 and a 73.
"I started off slow with a poor first

round, but I buckled down and put my
mind to short-term goals of improving
every day instead of focusing on the broad
picture."
Juniors Stephanie Davis and Audrey
Wooding felt as though the team could
have done far better had they been on
their games. Davis ended the tourney
with an 83 after having shot quite consis
tently with scores of 78, 76 and 78. She
finished 58th overall at 315.
"The whole week I had problems with
my swing, but I putted really well," Davis
said. "It was kind of a miracle that I shot
so well the first three days — I had to
really rely on my putting.
"This is a real disappointment for me.
I had a couple of good rounds, but I never
put it together for one tournament."
Wooding, ranked 20th in the nation
and named an honorable mention All-
America upon entering the tourney,
struggled throughout, shooting a 326 on
the tournament. She shot an eight-over
par 80 in the first and last rounds.
"Audrey had a really tough week," Davis
said. "It was tough to see her struggle."
