# Linksters impress, finish 3rd at regional
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
They may be young. They may not have a
lot of experience. But they sure know when
and how to crank up the intensity.
The Cardinal men's golf team, now ranked
among the top 25 teams in the nation, steam
rolled through the NCAA Western Regionals
at the University of New Mexico in Albu
querque to clinch with authority and confi
dence a berth in the NCAA Championships
next week at Poppy Hills.
The Cardinal linksters hung with the best
throughout the 54-hole tourney that con
cluded Saturday, shooting rounds of 289, 293
and 288 to finish two strokes behind top
ranked Arizona and No. 2 Arizona State. Stan
ford, needing to finish among the top nine
teams to qualify for the NCAAs, came away
with a tournament total of 870 in a three-way
tie for third with fifth-ranked UNLV and
UCLA.
No one can deny that the Cardinal's two
freshmen, Casey Martin and Notah Begay,
came up huge throughout the three-day
heated affair. Martin topped the Cardinal
squad with a one-under-par 215 and his
fourth-place finish.
"This was my best performance of the
year," Martin said. "I'm thrilled about it. I
finally put in three good days."
Begay, a native of Albuquerque, was not far
off Martin's sizzling pace, shooting a 219 for
the tourney, second-best on the Cardinal.
"For two freshmen, God they're amazing,"
Cardinal coach Wally Goodwin said. "There's
no doubt in my mind that nobody got a better
crop of freshmen than we did this year."
But the two freshmen sensations were not
the entire story for the Cardinal. They were
only a part of it.
Mike Milliken, a sophomore who missed
more than three weeks of action due to ten
dinitis of the knee, lit up the greens in only his
second tournament back. The No. 4 player led

the Cardinal in the first round with a two
under-par 70, only to fall out of contention for
the individual title with his second-day score
of 82. But never one to be counted out, Mil
lion rebounded with amazing guttiness to
drill a 71 on the last day of play to finish 47th
overall.
And then there was junior captain Chris
tian Cevaer, who entered the tourney on a
rampage and was an outside favorite to take
the title. Cevaer didn't finish where he is usu
ally accustomed to ending tournaments (he
finished in a six-way tie for 41st), but his six
over-par 222 provided the Cardinal with a con
sistent score every day.
"Christian didn't quit," Goodwin said of
Cevaer's 76, 72 and 74. "He showed a lot of
pride out there."
Sophomore Dave Rutkowski proved the
importance of his fifth man position on the
team having his score count among the top
four in two of the three rounds. He followed up
Thursday's 75 with a two-over-par 74 on Fri
day to fill the void for the Cardinal and save
eight strokes. Rutkowski's 77 on the final day
put him at 57th overall.
"Rutkowski is one hell of a fifth man,"
Goodwin said. "He's not an accomplished
golfer by any means, but he is one accom
plished athlete. He really took up the slack."
But if anyone played like wildfire it was
Martin. Shooting a 72, 73 and a 70, Martin fin
ished only five strokes behind the individual
champion, Warren Schutte of UNLV and even
with the two-time defending NCAA champ
Phil Mickelson of Arizona State.
"I played really well, but I couldn't get my
putts to fall the first two days," Martin said.
"On the last day I wasn't striking the ball as
well, but I got some putts to fall."
Martin highlighted the tourney with a two
under-par 70 final round that included a two
stroke penalty on the 11th hole when he pulled
a drive into the rough and lost the ball.
Begay, the other side of the freshman tan
dem, shot a 72, 74 and 73 before his hometown

crowd. "Notah played with Phil Mickelson in
front of nearly 200 people," Goodwin said. "He
had his friends out there and so did Mickelson,
but by the end everyone was clapping for
everyone else. It was great."
After a disappointing 10-over-par in the sec
ond round, Milliken didn't think that he was
much better off when he started off the final
18 holes. On the second hole, he triple-bogeyed
the par-3. But he bounced back to play four
under-par for the next 16 holes and finish one
under-par on the day.
"I concentrated on relaxing and making my
motion smooth," he said. "After my 82, I
thought about what I did wrong and I made
sure that my surroundings didn't bother me.
"I played two rounds under par, and I think
that I made a substantial contribution to the
team even though you can't just take a day off
and shoot an 82."
"Mike had a great recovery," Goodwin said.
"All year long he's been one of our better scor
ers and he proved that he can play golf."
Although Rutkowski's scores counted two
of the three rounds, he was not altogether sat
isfied with his performance. "I hit the ball
pretty well, but I putted like I had never
putted before," he said. "I missed every single
putt coming in."
Despite only finishing two strokes off the
pace of the top two teams in the country, the
Cardinal was not at all disappointed with their
performances. "You can't be that greedy,"
Goodwin said. "It doesn't make a difference
where we finished as long as it was among the
top nine teams. But we did it with some glory.
I knew that with three or four holes to play
that we had it made. I wasn't worried about
anyone."
As Rutkowski said, "Our goal was to qual
ify. We didn't think that we could beat either
Arizona or Arizona State, but to shoot even
par in the last round says a lot. We can stay
with the best of them even with all of the pres
sure."
They may be young. They may not have a

and how to crank up the intensity.

The Cardinal men's golf team, now ranked
among the top 25 teams in the nation, steam
rolled through the NCAA Western Regionals
at the University of New Mexico in Albu
querque to clinch with authority and confi
dence a berth in the NCAA Championships
next week at Poppy Hills.
The Cardinal linksters hung with the best
throughout the 54-hole tourney that con
cluded Saturday, shooting rounds of 289, 293
and 288 to finish two strokes behind top
ranked Arizona and No. 2 Arizona State. Stan
ford, needing to finish among the top nine
teams to qualify for the NCAAs, came away
with a tournament total of 870 in a three-way
tie for third with fifth-ranked UNLV and
UCLA.
No one can deny that the Cardinal's two
freshmen, Casey Martin and Notah Begay,
came up huge throughout the three-day
heated affair. Martin topped the Cardinal
squad with a one-under-par 215 and his
fourth-place finish.
"This was my best performance of the
year," Martin said. "I'm thrilled about it. I
finally put in three good days."
Begay, a native of Albuquerque, was not far
off Martin's sizzling pace, shooting a 219 for
the tourney, second-best on the Cardinal.
"For two freshmen, God they're amazing,"
Cardinal coach Wally Goodwin said. "There's
no doubt in my mind that nobody got a better
crop of freshmen than we did this year."
But the two freshmen sensations were not
the entire story for the Cardinal. They were
only a part of it.
Mike Milliken, a sophomore who missed
more than three weeks of action due to ten
dinitis of the knee, lit up the greens in only his
second tournament back. The No. 4 player led

the Cardinal in the first round with a two
under-par 70, only to fall out of contention for
the individual title with his second-day score
of 82. But never one to be counted out, Mil
lion rebounded with amazing guttiness to
drill a 71 on the last day of play to finish 47th
overall.
And then there was junior captain Chris
tian Cevaer, who entered the tourney on a
rampage and was an outside favorite to take
the title. Cevaer didn't finish where he is usu
ally accustomed to ending tournaments (he
finished in a six-way tie for 41st), but his six
over-par 222 provided the Cardinal with a con
sistent score every day.
"Christian didn't quit," Goodwin said of
Cevaer's 76, 72 and 74. "He showed a lot of
pride out there."
Sophomore Dave Rutkowski proved the
importance of his fifth man position on the
team having his score count among the top
four in two of the three rounds. He followed up
Thursday's 75 with a two-over-par 74 on Fri
day to fill the void for the Cardinal and save
eight strokes. Rutkowski's 77 on the final day
put him at 57th overall.
"Rutkowski is one hell of a fifth man,"
Goodwin said. "He's not an accomplished
golfer by any means, but he is one accom
plished athlete. He really took up the slack."
But if anyone played like wildfire it was
Martin. Shooting a 72, 73 and a 70, Martin fin
ished only five strokes behind the individual
champion, Warren Schutte of UNLV and even
with the two-time defending NCAA champ
Phil Mickelson of Arizona State.
"I played really well, but I couldn't get my
putts to fall the first two days," Martin said.
"On the last day I wasn't striking the ball as
well, but I got some putts to fall."
Martin highlighted the tourney with a two
under-par 70 final round that included a two
stroke penalty on the 11th hole when he pulled
a drive into the rough and lost the ball.
Begay, the other side of the freshman tan
dem, shot a 72, 74 and 73 before his hometown

crowd. "Notah played with Phil Mickelson in
front of nearly 200 people," Goodwin said. "He
had his friends out there and so did Mickelson,
but by the end everyone was clapping for
everyone else. It was great."
After a disappointing 10-over-par in the sec
ond round, Milliken didn't think that he was
much better off when he started off the final
18 holes. On the second hole, he triple-bogeyed
the par-3. But he bounced back to play four
under-par for the next 16 holes and finish one
under-par on the day.
"I concentrated on relaxing and making my
motion smooth," he said. "After my 82, I
thought about what I did wrong and I made
sure that my surroundings didn't bother me.
"I played two rounds under par, and I think
that I made a substantial contribution to the
team even though you can't just take a day off
and shoot an 82."
"Mike had a great recovery," Goodwin said.
"All year long he's been one of our better scor
ers and he proved that he can play golf."
Although Rutkowski's scores counted two
of the three rounds, he was not altogether sat
isfied with his performance. "I hit the ball
pretty well, but I putted like I had never
putted before," he said. "I missed every single
putt coming in."
Despite only finishing two strokes off the
pace of the top two teams in the country, the
Cardinal was not at all disappointed with their
performances. "You can't be that greedy,"
Goodwin said. "It doesn't make a difference
where we finished as long as it was among the
top nine teams. But we did it with some glory.
I knew that with three or four holes to play
that we had it made. I wasn't worried about
anyone."
As Rutkowski said, "Our goal was to qual
ify. We didn't think that we could beat either
Arizona or Arizona State, but to shoot even
par in the last round says a lot. We can stay
with the best of them even with all of the pres
sure."
They may be young. They may not have a
lot of experience. But they sure know when
and how to crank up the intensity.
