# Surprising Palmer wins singles crown
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
He was considered the most
unlikely of Stanford's talented
trio to bring Cardinal tennis its
conspicuously absent national
title.
He had had a rocky year,
struggling through numerous
dual matches. He was ranked
only 38th heading into NCAAs,
and was not even seeded for the
tournament.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
had said any of his three play
ers entered into the national
singles draw could win, but
most thought it would be team
mates Jonathan Stark or Alex
O'Brien if any Cardinal player
were to win it all.
Jared Palmer proved many
in the world of collegiate tennis
wrong Sunday. For it was he,
and not his more highly ranked
squadmates, who netted Stan
ford a national title.
The sophomore from Wesley
Chapel, Fla., capped an erratic
season by outgunning Patricio
Arnold 6-2, 6-0 for the NCAA
singles crown.
"To have had the type of
year where he had struggled
and come to the national cham
pionships and play so well is

Jared Palmer capped his sophomore season by winning the NCAA singles title.
phenomenal," Stark said of his
classmate and doubles partner.
"Jared had an unbelievable week.
Once he got rolling no one was
eoinz to beat him."

By demolishing Georgia's
Arnold, Palmer became the first
Cardinal singles titlest since Dan
Goldie went all the way in 1986.
Palmer's lopsided victory gave
him a crown that eluded such
Stanford greats as Jim Grabb,

Derrick Rostagno, Patrick McEn
roe, David Wheaton and Jeff
Tarango.
It was giving Stanford a
national title, however, and not
his place in the record books that
made the win sweet for Palmer.

"It's nice to have come here
and made something positive out
of the trip even though we didn't
do what we came here to do (win
the NCAA team title)," Palmer
said. "It's nice for Stanford to
have won in something."
Palmer's convicing victory was
considered unlikely by many
because after advancing to both
the NCAA singles and doubles
semifinals as a freshman, Palmer
struggled through most of the
dual-meet season. In playing at
No. 2 and No. 3 singles for the
Cardinal, the very talented sopho
more tallied only a 16-6 record.
He had troubles with his returns,
had lapses in mental concentra
tion, and was often disappointed
with his play.
But his potent serve-and-volley
game came together in Athens.
After the first round, that is.
Palmer advanced to the second
round by the slimmist of margins,
barely escaping doubles specialist
Jason Rubell of Duke, 5-7, 6-4, 7-
6 (8-6). It was the narrow victory,
however, which may have put
Palmer in the right frame of mind
to go all the way.
"To get through a match like
that in a big tournament sets up
the rest of the draw for you,"
Palmer said. "I was relieved to get
through, [but] I also felt confi
dence after.
"I saw how close I came to los
ing, and realized I had to just go
for it; that I had no reason to play
tentatively or doubt any of my
shots."
Palmer hit center court in
attack mode Sunday. Arnold could
do little but watch the serve-and
volley machine.
Serving first, Palmer held to
take the early lead, then quickly
broke Arnold to go up 2-0.
Palmer's serve was on, his vol
leys were deadly and nothing
could break his concentration.
Arnold made one run, but
couldn't hold off the potent
attack. The Argentinian native
broke Palmer to make the set 2-1,
then held to even things up at
two-all, but that was to be his only
answer to Palmer's relentless bar
rage.
Palmer easily went up 3-2, and
the day was over for Arnold.
"The early part of a match like
that is very important momen
tum-wise." Palmer said. "I came
out and played a good couple of
points the first game. I didn't give
him the right stuff, but 1 could tell
what I was trving to do was the

right thing.
"I knew if I stayed with it I
would get a percentage of the
points at the net. I did everything
I could to stay aggressive."
Palmer concentrated on spin
ning his serves right to Arnold's
backhand — his weaker side —
getting his first serves in and hit
ting returns to set up net play. He
was successful with all.

'Jared had an
unbelievable week.
Once he got rolling
no one was going
to beat him.'
— Jonathan Stark

Almost 70 percent of Palmer's
first serves were golden, and he
kept Arnold flailing from the
backhand corner. When Arnold
did get the ball into play, Palmer
went to the net — much to
Arnold's displeasure.
"I took him out of his game,"
Palmer added. "He likes to control
the game from the backcourt, but
I didn't give him a chance to find
a rhythm.
"He's a beautiful player, but I
didn't give him a chance to
breathe."
Arnold was suffocating to the
point that he choked most of his
first serves, connecting on a
measely 40 percent. Having to go
to his weaker second serve further
took the seventh-ranked player
out of his game.
"He likes to pound his first
serve and work the baseline,"
Palmer said. "I decided it was
worth the risk of missing returns
to attack his second serve. I just
kept coming at him and kept mak
ing him pass me by."
Arnold was not able to often
complete the pass. Palmer was
deadly at the net, volleying win
ner after winner past the flailing
Arnold.
"Jared played a very good
attacking game," said Gould. "He
played a very controlled game and
Arnold was never able to get a
rhythm."
The difference between
Palmer's success in Athens and
his up-and-down play during the
season, however, was his return of
serve.
Palmer struggled with his

returns in March and April, even
in early May, but had no such
problems during the tournament,
especially against Arnold.
"The biggest single fact in
Jared's success was his return
game," Gould said. "He played
points very well."
After Palmer gave Arnold two
early games to even up things at
2-2, he shut-out the seeded sopho
more. Palmer reeled off 10
straight points, making quick
work of what is supposed to be a
challenging match.
Palmer had a little tougher
time in his semifinal contest Sat
urday. Donny Isaak answered
Palmer's serve and volley with an
attacking net game of his own,
and stayed with Palmer the entire
match.
Palmer outlasted Isaak in three
sets at No. 3 singles during Stan
ford's losing battle with USC in
the team semifinals last Monday
to give the Cardinal one of its two
wins.
Isaak was even tougher in the
individual match-up. Both players
came out smoking, and neither
was able to gain an early advan
tage. Palmer finally broke Isaak,
held on to his edge, and broke
again for the 6-3 first set.
Isaak did not give in in the sec
ond, however, keeping things even
until the very end, when Palmer
closed out the match in a second
set tiebreaker. With the second set
evened up at 6-6, Palmer finally
broke Issak in the tie-breaker for
a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) squeaker.
"Donny played better than in
the team tournament, which was
a very close match," Gould said.
"[But] Jared played very well. He
served and volleyed well, and got a
high percentage of his first serves
in."
Palmer had much less trouble
with his previous two opponents.
In the quarterfinals Friday after
noon he downed alphabetically
seeded Joee Luis Noriega of San
Diego 6-3, 6-4. Earlier in the day
he demolished Georgia's Ivan
Baron 6-0, 6-3.
In fact, it is his consistent play
in the tourrament and not the
national title that Palmer cher
ishes about th* victory.
"I'm just lappy with how I
played — that'i more important
right now than whatever title I
gained," Palmer said. "I had a
couple good matches. Any player
can have that at any time. It's a
lot of luck it happened to me at
this tournament."

After a surprising first-round loss in the NCAA singles championships, Jonathan Stark bounced back to
reach the doubles final with teammate Jared Palmer. There, however, the Cardinal duo fell to the sec
ond-seeded tandem from California.
