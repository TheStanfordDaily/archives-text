# Reges controversy incites professor, student to act
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
When UCLA Philosophy Prof. Michael
Gehman boasted of his use of illegal drugs,
he was only getting high on satire. But
UCLA administrators didn't see it that way.
Gehman, angry over the firing of Stan
ford Computer Science Senior Lecturer
Stuart Reges, wrote a satirical letter to
national Drug Czar Bob Martinez claiming
Reges' drug use was nothing compared to
his.
"Right this minute, in the bottom
drawer of the filing cabinet in my office . . .
I've got a half-pound of Humboldt County
sinsemilla (marijuana), several hits of acid
and (my personal favorite) a brown lunch
sack . . . full of 'shrooms I harvested myself
from a cow pasture the last time I visited
my home in the good, great state of Missis
sippi," he wrote.
"Just last week I delivered a lecture on
the mind-body problem while tripping on
some righteous acid. I was fried, Bob. Sev
eral students have told me that it was the
finest lecture they've attended at UCLA
(Frankly, I can't recall a word I said)."
The letter was reprinted May 16 in The
Daily Bruin, the student newspaper, and
generated immediate controversy on cam
pus.
Many university administrators were
angered by Gehman's letter. UCLA's execu
tive vice chancellor, Murray Schwartz, told
the Los Angeles Times, "I was kind of
shocked and concerned. If any students
took it seriously, that's not a good thing. We

have a very strong anti-drug policy."
Linda Thomas, opinions editor for The
Daily Bruin, said Gehman's letter fooled
the paper's editors. Thomas, who said she
was "miffed" about the letter, added that
the editors would not have printed the let
ter as written if they had known it was
satirical.
The paper would have asked Gehman to
make a few changes and to label the letter
as satire, she said. "This has placed us in a
bad light with the administration," she
added.
Gehman could not be reached for com
ment.
To alleviate public relations fallout,
Gehman allowed UCLA Police Chief John
Barber to search his office under the super
vision of Schwartz and Joseph Mandel, the
school's vice chancellor for legal affairs.
The search uncovered no illegal drugs.
Gehman told the Los Angeles Times that
he experimented with marijuana, LSD and
cocaine as an undergraduate in Mississippi
but abandoned drug use after a year or two.
Although he does not encourage drug use
on campus, Gehman said, "I advocate the
right to use certain drugs, like marijuana."
The professor also said he will leave
UCLA next year for Vassar College with
good feelings.
Stanford sophomore Biard Mac Guineas
also took pen to paper in response to the
controversy surrounding Reges.
Mac Guineas sent a letter last month to ten
college presidents exhorting them to fight
as a group the government's intrusion into
university policy.

'Just last week I delivered a lecture on the mind
body problem while tripping on some righteous
acid. I was fried, Bob. Several students have told
me that it was the finest lecture they've attended at
UCLA (Frankly, I can't recall a word I said).'

Reges had also criticized the University
for implementing a new policy in response
to the 1989 Drug-Free Schools and Com
munities Act, which stipulates that univer
sities must enforce drug and alcohol regula
tions to receive federal aid.
Mac Guineas said he has received no pos
itive responses from the April 25 letter.
"Alone, Stanford can do nothing," he
wrote. But he noted that if the top universi
ties stood together against the government,
it would be impossible for legislators to
remove federal funding due to the public
"backlash."
He said he sent letters to University
President Donald Kennedy and to the pres
idents of the University of Chicago, MIT,
Cal Tech, Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Brown
and Columbia Universities and the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania.
Mac Guineas said he received an
acknowledgement of receipt of the letter
from the MIT president and negative

responses from Princeton and Brown. He
added that he has received no response
from Kennedy.
He also said he aborted another project
in which he had collected two weeks ago a
couple hundred names of students who
admitted that they had violated the drug
and alcohol policy. He added that during the
span of a week he casually gathered signa
tures from friends and other students in
dormitories and fraternities.
"My goal was not to move Stanford to do
anything," said Mac Guineas, who was plan
ning to present the list to the government.
"The list is clear evidence that the govern
ment's asked Stanford to do a ridiculous
thing," he said.
However, Mac Guineas terminated the
project for fear that the government might
decide to crack down on drug and alcohol
use at Stanford. "That's not what I want,"
he said. "I can no longer count on the gov
ernment to act reasonably."
