## Freshman froggers jump into Guinness book 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
It's finally over!
That was the word among Trancos residents Sun
day night as they completed their quest to break the
world leapfrog record and raise money for charity.
After slightly more than 10 days of constant
leapfrogging by the group of 14 freshmen, the 1,000
mile mark was reached Sunday night and the leaping
"stopped right after that," said participant Justin
Kitch.
The previous Guinness Book record was 888
miles, set by the senior class of organizer Brian
Cook's high school in New Hampshire in 1988. Cook
said rumor has it that members of his high school
are considering an attempt to retake the record.
The Trancos residents will now send in a log book
signed by witnesses to the Guinness Book and wait
for their new record to be recognized.
"It feels incredible to be done," Kitch said. "It was
definitely worth it because we gave so much of our
selves to help other people."
Despite some problems collecting donations, the
leapfroggers raised approximately $5,700 for the
Creative Adventures Learning Center, an after

school program in East Palo Alto.
The donation will also help fund a summer pro
gram of the center called Great Excursions, which
allows East Palo Alto children to take field trips in
the Bay Area. The state government recently cut its
funding to the program.
But organizers said much more money could have
been collected had there not been a problem with the
post office: Every donation sent to the designated
post office box was returned to its sender.
"The post office claimed that we were sharing a
post office box and using it for a commercial inter
est," Kitch said. "We have no idea how much more
money was returned."
Cook said the part that "really irritated" him was
that the post office had apparently been sending
back the donations for about a month without noti
fying the post office box owner.
The address had been heavily publicized through
public service announcements on local television and
radio stations and by letters send to many busi
nesses, alumni and parents.
Follow-up letters with a new address were sent
out to everyone, and Kitch said he still hopes to
achieve the original goal of $10,000 for the center.
