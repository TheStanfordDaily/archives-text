# Project motivates 'at- risk' students

### Sonya Martinez Staff writer 
More than 100 local high school students came to
Stanford Friday for Project Motivation's annual
"Day With An Undergraduate," a program designed
to encourage "at-risk" students to apply to college.
The day's events included practical information
sessions on college admissions and financial aid.
High school students also watched presentations on
campus life and attended self-esteem workshops.
The event attempts to give high school students a
better understanding of what college is all about,
said freshman Victor Madrigal, a Project Motivation
member who will be its administrative director next
year.
Many students have misconceptions about col
lege, and often are worried about paying for tuition
and having to leave home. But success is "just a mat
ter of them working hard, making an effort," Madri
gal said.
Project Motivation focuses its efforts on Chicano
and Latino students because they are "the most at
risk students," Madrigal said.
About 50 percent of all high school dropouts in
the United States are Chicanos, he said. In the next
few years, the proportion of Chicanos in U.S. high
schools is expected to increase dramatically.
High school students from other ethnic groups
also participate in the group's programs, but in
smaller numbers, Madrigal said.
An important part of Project Motivation's work is
encouraging self-esteem. In Friday's "Si Se Puede,"
or "Yes, You Can" workshops, students were asked
questions such as "Who are your role models?" and
"What about yourself are you most proud of?" to
encourage them to think about the personal quali
ties they admired and saw in themselves.
Speaking Friday, Project Motivation member
Anita De Lucio told the visiting high school students,
"Once you get into college . . . some people may say,
'Well, you got in because you're Mexican. . . .' It's
important that you know the hard work you put in."
Almost all the students, mostly 10th and 11th
