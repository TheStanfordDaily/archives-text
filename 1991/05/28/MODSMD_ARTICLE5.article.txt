# Incinerator will remain in operation

### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
After a long series of structural and management
"illnesses," Stanford's medical waste incinerator has
been given a clean bill of health and will continue to
serve as the University's primary tool for disposing
of medical waste.
Outside consultants decided last week, after a
year-and-a-half review, that the incinerator is fit to
function. Since it opened in 1987, the facility has
been plagued by structural defects and management
problems and a recent series of explosions.
These problems have combined to prevent it from
burning the 10,000 pounds of bandages, disposable
instruments, petri dishes and other health care and
health research wastes Stanford generates daily.
But in the past year, improvements have made the
incinerator "the safest and cleanest facility in the
Bay Area," according to Joe Slamovich, air quality
engineer at the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District.
The technicians who run Stanford's incinerator
have just become the first biohazard team in the
state to be designated as trained and certified in
incinerator operations, Slamovich said. A new Cali
fornia Air Resources Board regulation requires that
all operators of biohazard waste facilities be certified
by the end of the year.
"Stanford is head and shoulders above other
[facilities] in the area," Slamovich said. He praised
Stanford's training program and suggested that it
may be used as a standard to
judge the programs implemented
at other facilities.
The team was trained by Ted
Malloy, operations manager of
Stanford's Environmental Health
and Safety facility and Mike
Griswald, a representative of the
incinerator's manufacturer. The
program included three days of
classroom instruction on inciner
ation theory and efficient burn
ing, hundreds of hours of hands
on training and troubleshooting
of simulated emergencies.
The program was designed
under standards established by
the American Society of Mechani
cal Engineers.
The training "really opened
our eyes to a lot of different
things," said Rick Dozier, one of
the recently certified technicians.
"The teaching was great.
(Griswald) taught us how to read
our incinerator and how to save
the life of the machine. We also
have a manual of literature that
we're continuing to study."
The training comes in response
to new regulations and not to the
series of explosions which
occurred at the facility late last
year, Malloy said. The incinerator
operators were not at fault in
those incidents, he added.

On five separate occasions in
July, October, November and
December 1990, explosions in the
incinerator forced the facility to
be temporarily shut down. These
explosions were caused by small
gas cylinders that were improp
erly mixed with other wastes.

University officials later deter
mined that the cylinders came
from Stanford Hospital; however,
the original source of the cylin
ders was never discovered.
Shipping medical waste to
other facilities during the shut
downs cost the University "at

least $250,000," Malloy said.
After the incidents, memo
randa reminding hospital employ
ees of correct waste disposal
methods were circulated. "Most
likely it was accidental," Malloy
said. No explosions have occurred
this year.
