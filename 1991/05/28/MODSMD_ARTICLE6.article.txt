# New leaders offer perspectives on Greek life
## IFC head seeks stronger system 
### Robin Mathison Staff Writer 
As the new Interfraternity
Council president, Steve Jar
rett has lofty plans for keeping
fraternities around for Stan
ford's second century.
But his friends still see him
as something of a chump.
"They've taught me the
value of laughing at myself," he
says. Humility is one of the
many qualities Jarrett says he
has learned from his Sigma Nu
fraternity brothers.
"Joining a fraternity is the
best thing I've done at Stan
ford, educationally and recre
ationally," he says."It would be
a shame if the 200 th graduat
ing class doesn't have the same
opportunities as I did."
Jarrett says his main long
term goal is to strengthen the
Greek system, which he credits
as a big factor in making Stan
ford great.
"I want to make sure the
foundations are set for strong
opportunities for growth in the
Greek system and that the
organizations existent right
now prosper," he says.

University is in a state of tran
sition because of budget con
straints. Because the adminis

administrative decisions will be
made, the Greek system has a
"super opportunity to determine
what impact it will have on its
own future," he says.
He hopes to seize this chance
to establish a joint IFC-Inter
sorority Council judicial board
that would pass judgment on mis
conducts committed by Greek
members. The board would con
sider faculty, staff and non-Greek
student input in gathering
diverse and objective opinions.
Jarrett says the board should
be "one in which the administra
tion has a lot of faith, one that is
efficient and fair."
"The administration is more
willing now than ever before to
allow the Greek system to deter
mine punishments for its own
misconduct, as well as to take
steps educationally to assure that
misconduct doesn't occur again in
the future," he adds.
The Greek rally held last
Wednesday demonstrated how
unified the Greek system is, Jar
rett says. This unity is conducive
to holding more inter-Greek phi
lanthropy and social events, as
well as promoting more informal
exchanges between groups, he
adds.
Jarrett says he would also like
to see more interaction with the
African-American fraternities
and sororities.
He advocates the Greek system
as an extremely rewarding experi
ence and says he wants to make

sure everyone has the opportu
nity to become involved. "Stan
ford has the best facilities and the
best faculty, but it's the students
themselves that make Stanford so
outstanding," he says.
When he first arrived at Stan
ford from Tacoma, Wash., Jarrett
was intimidated by the highly
academic environment. He soon
overcame the fear of airing his
opinions and became excited
about the Great Works curricu
lum and art classes that he had
never before encountered, he
says.
His second challenge was
learning how to live in a one-room
double. Jarrett's freshman room
mate, whom he describes as a
super witty, amazing jazz bassist
from Manhattan, forced him to
learn how to live with another
person. "You learn a lot about
yourself when you have to live
with someone else," he says.
Jarrett spent his sophomore
year "coming to grips with what
he really believes in, he says."It
was a real opportunity to chal
lenge who I am."
Having settled comfortably
into his junior year, Jarrett tries
to live according to his favorite
quote, "To seek, to strive, to find
and not to yield," in Tennyson's
"Ulysses."
Jarrett's ultimate goal is to
work at Disney. "I have almost
unending respect for that organi
zation and what they stand for —
making people happy," he says.
"They're a bit like Mercedes-Benz
— everything they do is the very
best. They have the very best peo
ple and they value their people
more than anything else."
