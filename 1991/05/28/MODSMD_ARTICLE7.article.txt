# President wants ISC image shift
## 
### Robin Mathison Staff writer 
As a gymnast who competed
internationally, Adriana Duffy
trained several hours daily to
perfect her floor work and
vaulting skills. Now that she
has been chosen to serve as the
Intersorority Council presi
dent, Duffy is prepared to face
new obstacles.
Duffy says she hopes to
improve the image of the Greek
system, since some people
assume fraternities and sorori
ties only "cater to beautiful
people." Greek life is more
diverse and less oriented
around parties than people
think, she adds.
Close friendships are a
much more important part of
the Greek system than parties,
she says. She credits her
Gamma Phi Beta sorority sis
ters with supporting her, espe
cially when she was in the hos
pital after suffering a serious
accident at the 1989 World
Championships in Germany
that prevented her from com
peting again.
"They were a good, solid
group of friends," she says. "A
lot of people don't see that
aspect" of the Greek system.
Because she is paralyzed
from the waist down, Duffv
often finds attending parties chal
lenging since most fraternity
houses are not wheelchair-acces
sible, she says.
"Since going to parties is diffi
cult, I'm more selective about the
parties I go to," she says.
If a pill were available to elimi
nate her disability, Duffy is
unsure whether she would take it.
Although certain "functional
things are a pain, other things are
gained that are far more valuable

than that," she says.
Duffy's disability has forced
her to re-evaluate her priorities,
giving her a better understanding
of what is important.
"I've gained a certain perspec
tive on things that is impossible
to have otherwise," she says.
"There's a lot you can see about
people that you would never
notice beforehand.
"If you see somebody doing
something really weird, there
might be a reason for it," she
says. For example, a person mak
ing odd movements or holding a
paper very close to the eyes may
have a disability.

"I tend to jump to conclusions
less ... or I catch myself sooner
than other people would," she
adds.
Duffy plans to apply this per
spective to her role as ISC presi
dent by being more sensitive to
other people's differences and
problems. She feels that parallels
between minorities and the dis
abled will allow her to understand
and address problems in other
communities.
She also wants to unify the
Greek system by increasing inter
action between different groups.
She supports the ideas of a joint
Interfraternity Council-ISC judi

cial council and a Greek lodge to
provide a permanent space for
meetings and storage.
A judicial council should
include sororities since many of
the issues discussed involve
women, Duffy says. "If sororities
can be liable, they should have a
part in assessing what hap
pened," she says.
Growing up in Puerto Rico also
gives Duffy a different viewpoint
than many Stanford students.
She says that since there is a
great deal of U.S. influence in her
native country, she feels as if she
straddles both nationalities.
