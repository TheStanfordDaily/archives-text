The MITRE Corporation was founded over 30 years
ago at the request of the U. S. Government to analyze,
design and develop superior C 3! and civil systems
engineering solutions for the toughest, most important
systems engineering challenges. To meet that goal,
we designed a company that possesses unmatched
expertise in both current and emerging technologies.
One that also features an achievement-oriented philos
ophy promoting initiative, creativity, academic inter
action, and project mobility—in a highly desirable,
suburban Washington, DC. location.
Today, our superior accomplishments are working in
literally hundreds of diverse applications around the
world for military and civil clients such as the U. S.
Army and Navy, Federal Aviation Administration,
Defense Communication Agency, Environmental
Protection Agency and many others.
