# The
						Changing Face of
## Multiculturalism After several years of divisive battles, Stanford struggles to decide where it should go next 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Of all the things she has done as a student
leader at Stanford, Ingrid Nava is best
remembered for one speech she made on a
warm fall evening in 1989.
That night, in Memorial Auditorium, she startled
Stanford's newest crop of students with a fiery ora
tion challenging them to fight for progressive
change in the University.
"I am a Chicana from San Antonio, Texas, born to
a single mother who holds a job as a postal clerk,"
she said.
"She gave every day of her life to me, so that I
might one day be here at Stanford. . . . Invested in
this sacrifice was the hope for me to have the oppor
tunities that she was never able to have, so al! of her
hopes and dreams were part of my hopes and
dreams."
With that speech, Nava crystallized the passion
and politics of Stanford's multicultural movement.
And, at the same time, she turned off a large number
of freshmen to a movement that had frequently
challenged the status quo through dramatic actions
and confrontational rhetoric.
Today, largely because of the reactions of the
freshmen in that auditorium and many other stu
dents across campus, the passion is gone. The drama
is rarely seen, the rhetoric rarely heard.
Stanford, the university that placed campus
racial interaction squarely on the national agenda in
the late 1980s, has realized that the road to multi
cultural understanding is longer and blocked by
more obstacles than it once thought. And after a
period of painful, public exploration, the student
community is quietly wrestling with the question of
what to do next while coping with new challenges:
• Student of color organizations, which spurred
the highly charged fight for empowerment and edu
cational rights, have turned their attention inward
in an attempt to strengthen their own communities
and reassess their goals.
