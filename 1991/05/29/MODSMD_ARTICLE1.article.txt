# The 						Changing Face of
## Multiculturalism After several years of divisive battles, Stanford struggles to decide where it should go next 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Of all the things she has done as a student
leader at Stanford, Ingrid Nava is best
remembered for one speech she made on a
warm fall evening in 1989.
That night, in Memorial Auditorium, she startled
Stanford's newest crop of students with a fiery ora
tion challenging them to fight for progressive
change in the University.
"I am a Chicana from San Antonio, Texas, born to
a single mother who holds a job as a postal clerk,"
she said.
"She gave every day of her life to me, so that I
might one day be here at Stanford. . . . Invested in
this sacrifice was the hope for me to have the oppor
tunities that she was never able to have, so al! of her
hopes and dreams were part of my hopes and
dreams."
With that speech, Nava crystallized the passion
and politics of Stanford's multicultural movement.
And, at the same time, she turned off a large number
of freshmen to a movement that had frequently
challenged the status quo through dramatic actions
and confrontational rhetoric.
Today, largely because of the reactions of the
freshmen in that auditorium and many other stu
dents across campus, the passion is gone. The drama
is rarely seen, the rhetoric rarely heard.
Stanford, the university that placed campus
racial interaction squarely on the national agenda in
the late 1980s, has realized that the road to multi
cultural understanding is longer and blocked by
more obstacles than it once thought. And after a
period of painful, public exploration, the student
community is quietly wrestling with the question of
what to do next while coping with new challenges:
• Student of color organizations, which spurred
the highly charged fight for empowerment and edu
cational rights, have turned their attention inward
in an attempt to strengthen their own communities
and reassess their goals.

• Campus discussions of multi
cultural issues have been cur
tailed by an array of obstacles,
ranging from the threat of the
"politically correct" label to a
widespread weariness with pre
dictable, time-worn arguments to
the need to confront urgent finan
cial matters that strike at the very
heart of the University.
• Honest dialogue about multi
culturalism remains elusive at
one of the most critical moments
for the University, as efforts to
create an interactive, pluralistic
community are threatened by an
ever-tightening University bud
get.
"I think there's a lot of com
mitment, but people are confused
about what to do," said Keith
Archuleta, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Black Community Services Cen
ter. "The politics of the People's
Platform and Students First have
gotten in the way of what we are
really talking about: What's the
vision?"
Though attempts have been
made, Stanford has never agreed
on what the vision is. Interviews
with students leaders, adminis
trators and others reveal that two
things keep getting in the way —
emotions and a lack of the lan
guage necessary to fully address
the issues.
Today, the buzzword of the last
four years — "multiculturalism"
— is as vaguely defined as ever,
and no two definitions are the
same.
The modern "multicultural
movement" at Stanford,
broadly defined as the coalition of
groups that have worked to
empower students of color and
increase University support for
their interests, was born of the
civil rights movement of the
19605.
After a period of relative
latency, the movement awoke in
the mid-1980s to stake its claims
in the Western Culture debate.
The coalition of student groups
that fought for changes in the
freshman curriculum won a sig
nificant victory, and the People's
Platform party was created to
institutionalize the new-found
power of students of color.
A second turning point for
multiculturalism, many say, was
the 1989 completion of a study on
Stanford race relations by the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues — a study undertaken
in response to a demand by a
group of student of color organi
zations called the Rainbow Coali
tion.
The UCMI study included one
of the community's few serious
attempts at defining what the
Stanford community would look
like once it became fully "multi
cultural": "Above all else, our
vision is one of an interactive,
multiracial community of stu
dents, faculty and staff who share
a belief in mutual respect and who
view their racial and ethnic diver
sity as a unique asset," the report
reads.
With those battles won, how
ever, the multicultural movement
hit a third turning point in May
1989, when a coalition of groups
calling itself the Agenda for
Action organized the takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The takeover ultimately
spurred the University into agree
ing to some of the coalition's
demands, such as hiring a full
time dean for the Chicano com
munity and a professor of Asian-
American studies. But disagree
ment over the tactic of barricad
ing a building tended to polarize
campus opinion on multicultural
issues.
In 1991, observers point to two
results of that polarization: Stu
dents have tended to avoid discus
sions of multiculturalism rather
than continue to hash them out,
and the general silence has forced
the student of color organizations
to re-evaluate what they're fight
ing for.
Consider the differences
between 1991 and years past:
• While the Western Culture
debate took place over an
extended period of time and
gained national attention, the
Faculty Senate this year
revamped the undergraduate dis
tribution requirements to include
the study of race and gender —
with hardly a comment from stu
dents.
• Freshmnn Orientation,
which once included "The Fire
Within" and other programs
aimed at increasing multicultural
understanding, this year was
toned down to the point that "we
did nothing" on such issues, said
multicultural educator Greg
Hicks.
• The People's Platform, the
party that has championed the
multicultural cause, lost the
Council of Presidents this spring
after holding it for three years.
• While it was once taboo to
express opposition to the multi-

cultural movement, students said,
it is now equally taboo to express
opposition to the movement's crit
ics.
Corey Davis, a senior in drama,
sees the change in the freshman
dorm where he is a resident assis
tant. Comments that would have
been put down as racist or sexist
in years past now get by with a
chorus of snickers, he said.
"People are really getting
quiet," Davis said. "The tide is
starting to swing to where people
who were really vocal about sex
ism and racism are almost afraid
to speak out."

Those interviewed pointed to
several reasons for the compara
tive silence on multicultural
issues:
• The attention given to
"political correctness." The
development of the "PC" label has
given critics of the multicultural
movement automatic legitimacy,
even when their criticisms avoid
substantive evaluation of real
issues, student leaders said.
"I see it as a conservative
attack on progressive change,"
said Mae Lee, a junior who has
been an ASSU senator and ran on
the People's Platform COP slate
this spring. "It's a label thrown
upon people and their work with
out examining the work they do.
People aren't examining the
issues for what they are any
more."
"This campus is so charged
with people feeling attacked for
their ideas," added Davis. "People
don't want to come off as thought
police. There's a stigma against
anyone who advocates traditional
leftist views."
According to Ricks, who coordi
nates multicultural education
programs for the Office of Resi
dential Education, "Some people
think even to talk about it is to
push it, that the only way to be
anti-multiculturalism is never to
mention it."
• The "backlash." Nava's
Freshman Orientation speech is
only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down
our throats." Institutions like the

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went
unspoken by those critical of the
multicultural movement.
"To some extent we have had
multicultural overkill on this
campus," said second-year law
student Peter Thiel, one of the
founders of The Review. "Rather
than just being a commitment to
intellectual diversity, it has
turned out to be a commitment to
a whole agenda. . . . People have
tried to force a cultural integra
tion that is very artificial."
Thiel continued, "I think peo
ple are still [policing thought]
with the same intensity they were
four years ago. Today, there are
people who will speak up and say
these are bad things. The Stan
ford Review has played some role;
it's made it permissible for people
to speak out."
Davis said, "White guilt got the
People's Platform elected. A lot of
white students have not resolved
their guilt, and instead of resolv
ing it, they got angry. Some of the
anger was legitimate; they were
taking a lot of shit from students
of color."
Students First leaders say that
they do not oppose the ideals
of the multicultural movement,
but that student services are the
larger umbrella under which mul
ticulturalism falls — not the
reverse.
"I'd like to think Students
First is a call back to campus,"
said COP-elect member John
Overdeck. "One reason we won is
the fact that student government
has almost exclusively been work
ing in these (multicultural) direc
tions. People are thinking, maybe
there's something more."
Nava, a member of the Council
of Presidents, said the backlash
against multiculturalism and the
success of Students First are part
of the same phenomenon. "Gains
were made," and changes of the
kind Stanford has seen can be a
scary thing, she said.
• Fatigue. "I think for a lot of
people who have been active
there's a lot of fatigue," Nava
said. "It comes from running into
so many obstacles. It makes peo
ple less responsive in some ways."
"Along with struggle, there
needs to be some sense of nor
malcy in people's lives," said
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs. "Students do
need to be students for a while
and not be in a constant struggle,
without losing sight of these ini
tiatives."
Some students active in the
multicultural movement said they
are also tired of constantly carry
ing the burden of teaching others
when they came to Stanford for
an education themselves.
"People are put in the role of
educator, and no one is really com
fortable with that," said Kaydee
Culbertson, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza

tion.
Alex Hoye, a member of Stu
dents First who ran on the party's
first COP slate two years ago, said
the multicultural message also
begins to fall on deaf ears when it
becomes repetitive.
"People get tired of people say
ing the same thing over and over.
What they were saying was sub
stantive, it just wasn't new," he
said.

'We have not really"

political stand on
anything this year. .
It has a lot to do
with where the
community is at.'

=_=!

• A national swing away
from campus political action.
"People know this isn't a big stu
dent activism time right now,"
said Archuleta.
"The way Stanford is now, this
calm, is indicative of the entire
country," Lee added.
• The debate is taking place
in different arenas. That's the
assessment of James Lyons, who
last year retired after 18 years as
dean of Student Affairs. Lyons
notes that multiculturalism is
being discussed with more fervor

in the contexts of curriculum
diversity and faculty recruitment
than in student relations.
But leaders of student of color
groups emphasize that the disap
pearance of discussion among
many students doesn't mean that
the issues, too, have disappeared.
"The heat around these types
of issues is down, but they're still
things people consider impor
tant," said Ed Morimoto, outgoing
chair of the Asian American Stu
dent Association.
While opinions vary widely on
how to achieve many of the ideals
of multiculturalism, there is at
least tentative agreement on what
some of those basic ideals are —
and that some of them have been
integrated into the social fabric of
Stanford student life.
A structure that promotes
equality of educational opportu
nity, a curriculum that reflects the
historical contributions of more
than one culture and an atmo
sphere that supports the efforts of
all students regardless of back
ground are all broadly endorsed
goals.
"There's a much higher level of
awareness now than when I
arrived," said Overdeck, a second
year doctoral candidate who also
attended Stanford as an under
graduate. "There is significantly
more tolerance than there was
before. I feel we have gone some
where."
Though members of the stu
dent of color groups say they feel
some sense of accomplishment for
the gains of the last few years,
much work is left to be done, they
quickly add.
Student of color organizations
have, in the words of one leader,
pulled out of the spotlight and
turned their attention inward in
an attempt to "get a sense of what
we've done and what we're going
to do next." The change includes a
shift in focus from political
activism to cultural expression.
"We're trying to get back to our
earlier values — a sense of com
munity," Morimoto said. "AASA
has had an image dominated by its
politics, and I think the organiza
tion suffered. . . . We're making
sure people realize that's not all
that AASA's about. It's something
all the groups are going to have to
concentrate on."
"We have not really taken a
strong political stand on anything
this year," said sophomore Maria
Peters, outgoing co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "It has a lot to do with
where the community is at. . . .
We're trying to build a more cohe
sive community and get more peo
ple involved and active, so we
haven't been able to work on
broader issues."
Some groups are also attempt
ing to recover from the effects
of The Daily's reports last spring
that a Marxist-Leninist organiza
tion called the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle had recruited
several members of Stanford's
student of color organizations.
"That frightened a lot of peo
ple," said Angelique Jackson, out
going co-chair of SAIO. "They
didn't want to pursue the issues
anymore if they were going to be
personally attacked."
"People are very wary of any
thing we do," said MEChA's
Peters. "People don't know what
we are and what we do. They're
very cautious about whether to
come to our events, whether to
give us funding. I think it's still in
the back of people's minds."
This "down time" for student
of color groups is somewhat dan
gerous for them, however, because
it comes at the same time as the

University searches for places to
cut its operating budget.
"I don't think [student of color
groups] have been doing anything
for the last year and a half," said
Archuleta. "If white students are
tired of having multiculturalism
rammed down their throats,
who's doing the ramming?
"People are bullshitting each
other. Students are fighting
among themselves and allowing
administrators like me to set pri
orities with limited funds. The
institution as a whole is getting let
off the hook as long as students
bullshit each other about their
true feelings."
What's next for the multicul
tural movement? Some
reject the entire approach of the
last several years and question the
current role of the student of color
groups.
"I don't think much is going to
happen," said Thiel. "I'm not even
sure what would be next on the
multicultural agenda. I think it's
going to be a few years until we
get this re-rooted so we make
some real progress on this stuff."
If not everyone agrees with
that assessment, there is a grow
ing recognition that part of the
future of the multicultural move
ment will consist simply of decid
ing what it wants its future to be.
"It's going to be very difficult,
and it's going to be messy,"
Archuleta said. "If you admit
there's been injustice, there are
things that have to be worked out.
We move a little bit, then we give
up the ship."

whole is getting let

— Keith Archuleta 1

Though the student of color
groups and other members of the
multicultural movement are not
certain of what steps to take next,
there is widespread agreement
that the method of deciding on
those steps will have to come
through honest, personal conver
sations between individuals.
"If we keep going at the pace
we're going at now, there will be
that energy again," Davis said. "It
has to be on a personal level. Peo
ple need to start being really hon
est about how they're feeling and
start recognizing the complexity
of issues."
Overdeck said, "One change is
that a lot of people no longer see
the University as the source of
change. The University will no
longer say, 'Let there be equality'
and it will happen. A lot of people
have to realize it's only going to be
multicultural if individuals choose
it and believe it."
Ingrid Nava looks back on her
work at Stanford, including her
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
with few regrets. "There's a lot of
issues that we've won. I feel the
discussion is at a very sophisti
cated level."
"I feel good that I was
involved," she says. "At the same
time, I feel that there's a long way
for it to go. Things are probably
not going to move as quickly in
the next couple of years as in the
years when I was involved. That
can be frustrating "

A second turning point for
multiculturalism, many say, was
the 1989 completion of a study on
Stanford race relations by the
University Committee on Minor

in response to a demand by a
group of student of color organi

The UCMI study included one
of the community's few serious
attempts at defining what the
Stanford community would look
like once it became fully "multi

a belief in mutual respect and who
view their racial and ethnic diver
sity as a unique asset," the report
reads.
With those battles won, how
ever, the multicultural movement
hit a third turning point in May
1989, when a coalition of groups
calling itself the Agenda for
Action organized the takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The takeover ultimately
spurred the University into agree

• The "backlash." Nava's

only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went

"To some extent we have had

While opinions vary widely on
how to achieve many of the ideals
of multiculturalism, there is at
least tentative agreement on what
some of those basic ideals are —
and that some of them have been
integrated into the social fabric of
Stanford student life.
A structure that promotes
equality of educational opportu
nity, a curriculum that reflects the
historical contributions of more
than one culture and an atmo
sphere that supports the efforts of
all students regardless of back
ground are all broadly endorsed
goals.
"There's a much higher level of
awareness now than when I
arrived," said Overdeck, a second
year doctoral candidate who also
attended Stanford as an under
graduate. "There is significantly
more tolerance than there was
before. I feel we have gone some
where."
Though members of the stu
dent of color groups say they feel
some sense of accomplishment for
the gains of the last few years,
much work is left to be done, they
quickly add.
Student of color organizations
have, in the words of one leader,
pulled out of the spotlight and
turned their attention inward in
an attempt to "get a sense of what
we've done and what we're going
to do next." The change includes a
shift in focus from political
activism to cultural expression.
"We're trying to get back to our
earlier values — a sense of com
munity," Morimoto said. "AASA
has had an image dominated by its
politics, and I think the organiza
tion suffered. . . . We're making
sure people realize that's not all
that AASA's about. It's something
all the groups are going to have to
concentrate on."
"We have not really taken a
strong political stand on anything
this year," said sophomore Maria
Peters, outgoing co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "It has a lot to do with
where the community is at. . . .
We're trying to build a more cohe
sive community and get more peo
ple involved and active, so we
haven't been able to work on
broader issues."
Some groups are also attempt
ing to recover from the effects
of The Daily's reports last spring
that a Marxist-Leninist organiza
tion called the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle had recruited
several members of Stanford's
student of color organizations.
"That frightened a lot of peo
ple," said Angelique Jackson, out
going co-chair of SAIO. "They
didn't want to pursue the issues
anymore if they were going to be
personally attacked."
"People are very wary of any
thing we do," said MEChA's
Peters. "People don't know what
we are and what we do. They're
very cautious about whether to
come to our events, whether to
give us funding. I think it's still in
the back of people's minds."
This "down time" for student
of color groups is somewhat dan
gerous for them, however, because
it comes at the same time as the

University searches for places to
cut its operating budget.
"I don't think [student of color
groups] have been doing anything
for the last year and a half," said
Archuleta. "If white students are
tired of having multiculturalism
rammed down their throats,
who's doing the ramming?
"People are bullshitting each
other. Students are fighting
among themselves and allowing
administrators like me to set pri
orities with limited funds. The
institution as a whole is getting let
off the hook as long as students
bullshit each other about their
true feelings."
What's next for the multicul
tural movement? Some
reject the entire approach of the
last several years and question the
current role of the student of color
groups.
"I don't think much is going to
happen," said Thiel. "I'm not even
sure what would be next on the
multicultural agenda. I think it's
going to be a few years until we
get this re-rooted so we make
some real progress on this stuff."
If not everyone agrees with
that assessment, there is a grow
ing recognition that part of the
future of the multicultural move
ment will consist simply of decid
ing what it wants its future to be.
"It's going to be very difficult,
and it's going to be messy,"
Archuleta said. "If you admit
there's been injustice, there are
things that have to be worked out.
We move a little bit, then we give
up the ship."

Though the student of color
groups and other members of the
multicultural movement are not
certain of what steps to take next,
there is widespread agreement
that the method of deciding on
those steps will have to come
through honest, personal conver
sations between individuals.
"If we keep going at the pace
we're going at now, there will be
that energy again," Davis said. "It
has to be on a personal level. Peo
ple need to start being really hon
est about how they're feeling and
start recognizing the complexity
of issues."
Overdeck said, "One change is
that a lot of people no longer see
the University as the source of
change. The University will no
longer say, 'Let there be equality'
and it will happen. A lot of people
have to realize it's only going to be
multicultural if individuals choose
it and believe it."
Ingrid Nava looks back on her
work at Stanford, including her
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
with few regrets. "There's a lot of
issues that we've won. I feel the
discussion is at a very sophisti
cated level."
"I feel good that I was
involved," she says. "At the same
time, I feel that there's a long way
for it to go. Things are probably
not going to move as quickly in
the next couple of years as in the
years when I was involved. That
can be frustrating "


Doug Davis - Daily
Of all the things she has done as a student
leader at Stanford, Ingrid Nava is best
remembered for one speech she made on a
warm fall evening in 1989.
That night, in Memorial Auditorium, she startled
Stanford's newest crop of students with a fiery ora
tion challenging them to fight for progressive
change in the University.
"I am a Chicana from San Antonio, Texas, born to
a single mother who holds a job as a postal clerk,"
she said.
"She gave every day of her life to me, so that I
might one day be here at Stanford. . . . Invested in
this sacrifice was the hope for me to have the oppor
tunities that she was never able to have, so al! of her
hopes and dreams were part of my hopes and
dreams."
With that speech, Nava crystallized the passion
and politics of Stanford's multicultural movement.
And, at the same time, she turned off a large number
of freshmen to a movement that had frequently
challenged the status quo through dramatic actions
and confrontational rhetoric.
Today, largely because of the reactions of the
freshmen in that auditorium and many other stu
dents across campus, the passion is gone. The drama
is rarely seen, the rhetoric rarely heard.
Stanford, the university that placed campus
racial interaction squarely on the national agenda in
the late 1980s, has realized that the road to multi
cultural understanding is longer and blocked by
more obstacles than it once thought. And after a
period of painful, public exploration, the student
community is quietly wrestling with the question of
what to do next while coping with new challenges:
• Student of color organizations, which spurred
the highly charged fight for empowerment and edu
cational rights, have turned their attention inward
in an attempt to strengthen their own communities
and reassess their goals.


Doug Davis — Dally
• Campus discussions of multi
cultural issues have been cur
tailed by an array of obstacles,
ranging from the threat of the
"politically correct" label to a
widespread weariness with pre
dictable, time-worn arguments to
the need to confront urgent finan
cial matters that strike at the very
heart of the University.
• Honest dialogue about multi
culturalism remains elusive at
one of the most critical moments
for the University, as efforts to
create an interactive, pluralistic
community are threatened by an
ever-tightening University bud
get.
"I think there's a lot of com
mitment, but people are confused
about what to do," said Keith
Archuleta, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Black Community Services Cen
ter. "The politics of the People's
Platform and Students First have
gotten in the way of what we are
really talking about: What's the
vision?"
Though attempts have been
made, Stanford has never agreed
on what the vision is. Interviews
with students leaders, adminis
trators and others reveal that two
things keep getting in the way —
emotions and a lack of the lan
guage necessary to fully address
the issues.
Today, the buzzword of the last
four years — "multiculturalism"
— is as vaguely defined as ever,
and no two definitions are the
same.
The modern "multicultural
movement" at Stanford,
broadly defined as the coalition of
groups that have worked to
empower students of color and
increase University support for
their interests, was born of the
civil rights movement of the
19605.
After a period of relative
latency, the movement awoke in
the mid-1980s to stake its claims
in the Western Culture debate.
The coalition of student groups
that fought for changes in the
freshman curriculum won a sig
nificant victory, and the People's
Platform party was created to
institutionalize the new-found
power of students of color.
A second turning point for
multiculturalism, many say, was
the 1989 completion of a study on
Stanford race relations by the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues — a study undertaken
in response to a demand by a
group of student of color organi
zations called the Rainbow Coali
tion.
The UCMI study included one
of the community's few serious
attempts at defining what the
Stanford community would look
like once it became fully "multi
cultural": "Above all else, our
vision is one of an interactive,
multiracial community of stu
dents, faculty and staff who share
a belief in mutual respect and who
view their racial and ethnic diver
sity as a unique asset," the report
reads.
With those battles won, how
ever, the multicultural movement
hit a third turning point in May
1989, when a coalition of groups
calling itself the Agenda for
Action organized the takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The takeover ultimately
spurred the University into agree
ing to some of the coalition's
demands, such as hiring a full
time dean for the Chicano com
munity and a professor of Asian-
American studies. But disagree
ment over the tactic of barricad
ing a building tended to polarize
campus opinion on multicultural
issues.
In 1991, observers point to two
results of that polarization: Stu
dents have tended to avoid discus
sions of multiculturalism rather
than continue to hash them out,
and the general silence has forced
the student of color organizations
to re-evaluate what they're fight
ing for.
Consider the differences
between 1991 and years past:
• While the Western Culture
debate took place over an
extended period of time and
gained national attention, the
Faculty Senate this year
revamped the undergraduate dis
tribution requirements to include
the study of race and gender —
with hardly a comment from stu
dents.
• Freshmnn Orientation,
which once included "The Fire
Within" and other programs
aimed at increasing multicultural
understanding, this year was
toned down to the point that "we
did nothing" on such issues, said
multicultural educator Greg
Hicks.
• The People's Platform, the
party that has championed the
multicultural cause, lost the
Council of Presidents this spring
after holding it for three years.
• While it was once taboo to
express opposition to the multi-

cultural movement, students said,
it is now equally taboo to express
opposition to the movement's crit
ics.
Corey Davis, a senior in drama,
sees the change in the freshman
dorm where he is a resident assis
tant. Comments that would have
been put down as racist or sexist
in years past now get by with a
chorus of snickers, he said.
"People are really getting
quiet," Davis said. "The tide is
starting to swing to where people
who were really vocal about sex
ism and racism are almost afraid
to speak out."

people feeling
attacked for their
ideas. People don't I
want to come off
as thought police.' J

Those interviewed pointed to
several reasons for the compara
tive silence on multicultural
issues:
• The attention given to
"political correctness." The
development of the "PC" label has
given critics of the multicultural
movement automatic legitimacy,
even when their criticisms avoid
substantive evaluation of real
issues, student leaders said.
"I see it as a conservative
attack on progressive change,"
said Mae Lee, a junior who has
been an ASSU senator and ran on
the People's Platform COP slate
this spring. "It's a label thrown
upon people and their work with
out examining the work they do.
People aren't examining the
issues for what they are any
more."
"This campus is so charged
with people feeling attacked for
their ideas," added Davis. "People
don't want to come off as thought
police. There's a stigma against
anyone who advocates traditional
leftist views."
According to Ricks, who coordi
nates multicultural education
programs for the Office of Resi
dential Education, "Some people
think even to talk about it is to
push it, that the only way to be
anti-multiculturalism is never to
mention it."
• The "backlash." Nava's
Freshman Orientation speech is
only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down
our throats." Institutions like the

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went
unspoken by those critical of the
multicultural movement.
"To some extent we have had
multicultural overkill on this
campus," said second-year law
student Peter Thiel, one of the
founders of The Review. "Rather
than just being a commitment to
intellectual diversity, it has
turned out to be a commitment to
a whole agenda. . . . People have
tried to force a cultural integra
tion that is very artificial."
Thiel continued, "I think peo
ple are still [policing thought]
with the same intensity they were
four years ago. Today, there are
people who will speak up and say
these are bad things. The Stan
ford Review has played some role;
it's made it permissible for people
to speak out."
Davis said, "White guilt got the
People's Platform elected. A lot of
white students have not resolved
their guilt, and instead of resolv
ing it, they got angry. Some of the
anger was legitimate; they were
taking a lot of shit from students
of color."
Students First leaders say that
they do not oppose the ideals
of the multicultural movement,
but that student services are the
larger umbrella under which mul
ticulturalism falls — not the
reverse.
"I'd like to think Students
First is a call back to campus,"
said COP-elect member John
Overdeck. "One reason we won is
the fact that student government
has almost exclusively been work
ing in these (multicultural) direc
tions. People are thinking, maybe
there's something more."
Nava, a member of the Council
of Presidents, said the backlash
against multiculturalism and the
success of Students First are part
of the same phenomenon. "Gains
were made," and changes of the
kind Stanford has seen can be a
scary thing, she said.
• Fatigue. "I think for a lot of
people who have been active
there's a lot of fatigue," Nava
said. "It comes from running into
so many obstacles. It makes peo
ple less responsive in some ways."
"Along with struggle, there
needs to be some sense of nor
malcy in people's lives," said
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs. "Students do
need to be students for a while
and not be in a constant struggle,
without losing sight of these ini
tiatives."
Some students active in the
multicultural movement said they
are also tired of constantly carry
ing the burden of teaching others
when they came to Stanford for
an education themselves.
"People are put in the role of
educator, and no one is really com
fortable with that," said Kaydee
Culbertson, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza

tion.
Alex Hoye, a member of Stu
dents First who ran on the party's
first COP slate two years ago, said
the multicultural message also
begins to fall on deaf ears when it
becomes repetitive.
"People get tired of people say
ing the same thing over and over.
What they were saying was sub
stantive, it just wasn't new," he
said.

• A national swing away
from campus political action.
"People know this isn't a big stu
dent activism time right now,"
said Archuleta.
"The way Stanford is now, this
calm, is indicative of the entire
country," Lee added.
• The debate is taking place
in different arenas. That's the
assessment of James Lyons, who
last year retired after 18 years as
dean of Student Affairs. Lyons
notes that multiculturalism is
being discussed with more fervor

in the contexts of curriculum
diversity and faculty recruitment
than in student relations.
But leaders of student of color
groups emphasize that the disap
pearance of discussion among
many students doesn't mean that
the issues, too, have disappeared.
"The heat around these types
of issues is down, but they're still
things people consider impor
tant," said Ed Morimoto, outgoing
chair of the Asian American Stu
dent Association.
While opinions vary widely on
how to achieve many of the ideals
of multiculturalism, there is at
least tentative agreement on what
some of those basic ideals are —
and that some of them have been
integrated into the social fabric of

Though members of the stu
dent of color groups say they feel
some sense of accomplishment for
the gains of the last few years,
much work is left to be done, they
quickly add.
Student of color organizations
have, in the words of one leader,
pulled out of the spotlight and
turned their attention inward in
an attempt to "get a sense of what
we've done and what we're going
to do next." The change includes a
shift in focus from political
activism to cultural expression.
"We're trying to get back to our
earlier values — a sense of com
munity," Morimoto said. "AASA
has had an image dominated by its
politics, and I think the organiza
tion suffered. . . . We're making
sure people realize that's not all
that AASA's about. It's something
all the groups are going to have to
concentrate on."
"We have not really taken a
strong political stand on anything

Peters, outgoing co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "It has a lot to do with
where the community is at. . . .
We're trying to build a more cohe
sive community and get more peo
ple involved and active, so we
haven't been able to work on
broader issues."
Some groups are also attempt
ing to recover from the effects
of The Daily's reports last spring
that a Marxist-Leninist organiza
tion called the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle had recruited
several members of Stanford's
student of color organizations.
"That frightened a lot of peo

Those interviewed pointed to
several reasons for the compara
tive silence on multicultural
issues:
• The attention given to
"political correctness." The
development of the "PC" label has
given critics of the multicultural
movement automatic legitimacy,
even when their criticisms avoid
substantive evaluation of real
issues, student leaders said.
"I see it as a conservative
attack on progressive change,"
said Mae Lee, a junior who has
been an ASSU senator and ran on
the People's Platform COP slate
this spring. "It's a label thrown
upon people and their work with
out examining the work they do.
People aren't examining the
issues for what they are any
more."
"This campus is so charged
with people feeling attacked for
their ideas," added Davis. "People
don't want to come off as thought
police. There's a stigma against
anyone who advocates traditional
leftist views."
According to Ricks, who coordi
nates multicultural education
programs for the Office of Resi
dential Education, "Some people
think even to talk about it is to
push it, that the only way to be
anti-multiculturalism is never to
mention it."
• The "backlash." Nava's
Freshman Orientation speech is
only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down
our throats." Institutions like the

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went
unspoken by those critical of the
multicultural movement.
"To some extent we have had
multicultural overkill on this
campus," said second-year law
student Peter Thiel, one of the
founders of The Review. "Rather
than just being a commitment to
intellectual diversity, it has
turned out to be a commitment to
a whole agenda. . . . People have
tried to force a cultural integra
tion that is very artificial."
Thiel continued, "I think peo
ple are still [policing thought]
with the same intensity they were
four years ago. Today, there are
people who will speak up and say
these are bad things. The Stan
ford Review has played some role;
it's made it permissible for people
to speak out."
Davis said, "White guilt got the
People's Platform elected. A lot of
white students have not resolved
their guilt, and instead of resolv
ing it, they got angry. Some of the
anger was legitimate; they were
taking a lot of shit from students
of color."
Students First leaders say that
they do not oppose the ideals
of the multicultural movement,
but that student services are the
larger umbrella under which mul
ticulturalism falls — not the
reverse.
"I'd like to think Students
First is a call back to campus,"
said COP-elect member John
Overdeck. "One reason we won is
the fact that student government
has almost exclusively been work
ing in these (multicultural) direc
tions. People are thinking, maybe
there's something more."
Nava, a member of the Council
of Presidents, said the backlash
against multiculturalism and the
success of Students First are part
of the same phenomenon. "Gains
were made," and changes of the
kind Stanford has seen can be a
scary thing, she said.
• Fatigue. "I think for a lot of
people who have been active
there's a lot of fatigue," Nava
said. "It comes from running into
so many obstacles. It makes peo
ple less responsive in some ways."
"Along with struggle, there
needs to be some sense of nor
malcy in people's lives," said
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs. "Students do
need to be students for a while
and not be in a constant struggle,
without losing sight of these ini
tiatives."
Some students active in the
multicultural movement said they
are also tired of constantly carry
ing the burden of teaching others
when they came to Stanford for
an education themselves.
"People are put in the role of
educator, and no one is really com
fortable with that," said Kaydee
Culbertson, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza

tion.
Alex Hoye, a member of Stu
dents First who ran on the party's
first COP slate two years ago, said
the multicultural message also
begins to fall on deaf ears when it
becomes repetitive.
"People get tired of people say
ing the same thing over and over.
What they were saying was sub
stantive, it just wasn't new," he
said.

'We have not really"

political stand on
anything this year. .
It has a lot to do
with where the
community is at.'
— Maria Peters
=_=!

• A national swing away
from campus political action.
"People know this isn't a big stu
dent activism time right now,"
said Archuleta.
"The way Stanford is now, this
calm, is indicative of the entire
country," Lee added.
• The debate is taking place
in different arenas. That's the
assessment of James Lyons, who
last year retired after 18 years as
dean of Student Affairs. Lyons
notes that multiculturalism is
being discussed with more fervor

in the contexts of curriculum
diversity and faculty recruitment
than in student relations.
But leaders of student of color
groups emphasize that the disap
pearance of discussion among
many students doesn't mean that
the issues, too, have disappeared.
"The heat around these types
of issues is down, but they're still
things people consider impor
tant," said Ed Morimoto, outgoing
chair of the Asian American Stu
dent Association.
While opinions vary widely on
how to achieve many of the ideals
of multiculturalism, there is at
least tentative agreement on what
some of those basic ideals are —
and that some of them have been
integrated into the social fabric of
Stanford student life.
A structure that promotes
equality of educational opportu
nity, a curriculum that reflects the
historical contributions of more
than one culture and an atmo
sphere that supports the efforts of
all students regardless of back
ground are all broadly endorsed
goals.
"There's a much higher level of
awareness now than when I
arrived," said Overdeck, a second
year doctoral candidate who also
attended Stanford as an under
graduate. "There is significantly
more tolerance than there was
before. I feel we have gone some
where."
Though members of the stu
dent of color groups say they feel
some sense of accomplishment for
the gains of the last few years,
much work is left to be done, they
quickly add.
Student of color organizations
have, in the words of one leader,
pulled out of the spotlight and
turned their attention inward in
an attempt to "get a sense of what
we've done and what we're going
to do next." The change includes a
shift in focus from political
activism to cultural expression.
"We're trying to get back to our
earlier values — a sense of com
munity," Morimoto said. "AASA
has had an image dominated by its
politics, and I think the organiza
tion suffered. . . . We're making
sure people realize that's not all
that AASA's about. It's something
all the groups are going to have to
concentrate on."
"We have not really taken a
strong political stand on anything
this year," said sophomore Maria
Peters, outgoing co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "It has a lot to do with
where the community is at. . . .
We're trying to build a more cohe
sive community and get more peo
ple involved and active, so we
haven't been able to work on
broader issues."
Some groups are also attempt
ing to recover from the effects
of The Daily's reports last spring
that a Marxist-Leninist organiza
tion called the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle had recruited
several members of Stanford's
student of color organizations.
"That frightened a lot of peo
ple," said Angelique Jackson, out
going co-chair of SAIO. "They
didn't want to pursue the issues
anymore if they were going to be
personally attacked."
"People are very wary of any
thing we do," said MEChA's
Peters. "People don't know what
we are and what we do. They're
very cautious about whether to
come to our events, whether to
give us funding. I think it's still in
the back of people's minds."
This "down time" for student
of color groups is somewhat dan
gerous for them, however, because
it comes at the same time as the

University searches for places to
cut its operating budget.
"I don't think [student of color
groups] have been doing anything
for the last year and a half," said
Archuleta. "If white students are
tired of having multiculturalism
rammed down their throats,
who's doing the ramming?
"People are bullshitting each
other. Students are fighting
among themselves and allowing
administrators like me to set pri
orities with limited funds. The
institution as a whole is getting let
off the hook as long as students
bullshit each other about their
true feelings."
What's next for the multicul
tural movement? Some
reject the entire approach of the
last several years and question the
current role of the student of color
groups.
"I don't think much is going to
happen," said Thiel. "I'm not even
sure what would be next on the
multicultural agenda. I think it's
going to be a few years until we
get this re-rooted so we make
some real progress on this stuff."
If not everyone agrees with
that assessment, there is a grow
ing recognition that part of the
future of the multicultural move
ment will consist simply of decid
ing what it wants its future to be.
"It's going to be very difficult,
and it's going to be messy,"
Archuleta said. "If you admit
there's been injustice, there are
things that have to be worked out.
We move a little bit, then we give
up the ship."

— Keith Archuleta 1

Though the student of color
groups and other members of the
multicultural movement are not
certain of what steps to take next,
there is widespread agreement
that the method of deciding on
those steps will have to come
through honest, personal conver
sations between individuals.
"If we keep going at the pace
we're going at now, there will be
that energy again," Davis said. "It
has to be on a personal level. Peo
ple need to start being really hon
est about how they're feeling and
start recognizing the complexity
of issues."
Overdeck said, "One change is
that a lot of people no longer see
the University as the source of
change. The University will no
longer say, 'Let there be equality'
and it will happen. A lot of people
have to realize it's only going to be
multicultural if individuals choose
it and believe it."
Ingrid Nava looks back on her
work at Stanford, including her
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
with few regrets. "There's a lot of
issues that we've won. I feel the
discussion is at a very sophisti
cated level."
"I feel good that I was
involved," she says. "At the same
time, I feel that there's a long way
for it to go. Things are probably
not going to move as quickly in
the next couple of years as in the
years when I was involved. That
can be frustrating "


Doug Davis - Daily
Of all the things she has done as a student
leader at Stanford, Ingrid Nava is best
remembered for one speech she made on a
warm fall evening in 1989.
That night, in Memorial Auditorium, she startled
Stanford's newest crop of students with a fiery ora
tion challenging them to fight for progressive
change in the University.
"I am a Chicana from San Antonio, Texas, born to
a single mother who holds a job as a postal clerk,"
she said.
"She gave every day of her life to me, so that I
might one day be here at Stanford. . . . Invested in
this sacrifice was the hope for me to have the oppor
tunities that she was never able to have, so al! of her
hopes and dreams were part of my hopes and
dreams."
With that speech, Nava crystallized the passion
and politics of Stanford's multicultural movement.
And, at the same time, she turned off a large number
of freshmen to a movement that had frequently
challenged the status quo through dramatic actions
and confrontational rhetoric.
Today, largely because of the reactions of the
freshmen in that auditorium and many other stu
dents across campus, the passion is gone. The drama
is rarely seen, the rhetoric rarely heard.
Stanford, the university that placed campus
racial interaction squarely on the national agenda in
the late 1980s, has realized that the road to multi
cultural understanding is longer and blocked by
more obstacles than it once thought. And after a
period of painful, public exploration, the student
community is quietly wrestling with the question of
what to do next while coping with new challenges:
• Student of color organizations, which spurred
the highly charged fight for empowerment and edu
cational rights, have turned their attention inward
in an attempt to strengthen their own communities
and reassess their goals.


Doug Davis — Dally
• Campus discussions of multi
cultural issues have been cur
tailed by an array of obstacles,
ranging from the threat of the
"politically correct" label to a
widespread weariness with pre
dictable, time-worn arguments to
the need to confront urgent finan
cial matters that strike at the very
heart of the University.
• Honest dialogue about multi
culturalism remains elusive at
one of the most critical moments
for the University, as efforts to
create an interactive, pluralistic
community are threatened by an
ever-tightening University bud
get.
"I think there's a lot of com
mitment, but people are confused
about what to do," said Keith
Archuleta, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Black Community Services Cen
ter. "The politics of the People's
Platform and Students First have
gotten in the way of what we are
really talking about: What's the
vision?"
Though attempts have been
made, Stanford has never agreed
on what the vision is. Interviews
with students leaders, adminis
trators and others reveal that two
things keep getting in the way —
emotions and a lack of the lan
guage necessary to fully address
the issues.
Today, the buzzword of the last
four years — "multiculturalism"
— is as vaguely defined as ever,
and no two definitions are the
same.
The modern "multicultural
movement" at Stanford,
broadly defined as the coalition of
groups that have worked to
empower students of color and
increase University support for
their interests, was born of the
civil rights movement of the
19605.
After a period of relative
latency, the movement awoke in
the mid-1980s to stake its claims
in the Western Culture debate.
The coalition of student groups
that fought for changes in the
freshman curriculum won a sig
nificant victory, and the People's
Platform party was created to
institutionalize the new-found
power of students of color.
A second turning point for
multiculturalism, many say, was
the 1989 completion of a study on
Stanford race relations by the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues — a study undertaken
in response to a demand by a
group of student of color organi
zations called the Rainbow Coali
tion.
The UCMI study included one
of the community's few serious
attempts at defining what the
Stanford community would look
like once it became fully "multi
cultural": "Above all else, our
vision is one of an interactive,
multiracial community of stu
dents, faculty and staff who share
a belief in mutual respect and who
view their racial and ethnic diver
sity as a unique asset," the report
reads.
With those battles won, how
ever, the multicultural movement
hit a third turning point in May
1989, when a coalition of groups
calling itself the Agenda for
Action organized the takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The takeover ultimately
spurred the University into agree
ing to some of the coalition's
demands, such as hiring a full
time dean for the Chicano com
munity and a professor of Asian-
American studies. But disagree
ment over the tactic of barricad
ing a building tended to polarize
campus opinion on multicultural
issues.
In 1991, observers point to two
results of that polarization: Stu
dents have tended to avoid discus
sions of multiculturalism rather
than continue to hash them out,
and the general silence has forced
the student of color organizations
to re-evaluate what they're fight
ing for.
Consider the differences
between 1991 and years past:
• While the Western Culture
debate took place over an
extended period of time and
gained national attention, the
Faculty Senate this year
revamped the undergraduate dis
tribution requirements to include
the study of race and gender —
with hardly a comment from stu
dents.
• Freshmnn Orientation,
which once included "The Fire
Within" and other programs
aimed at increasing multicultural
understanding, this year was
toned down to the point that "we
did nothing" on such issues, said
multicultural educator Greg
Hicks.
• The People's Platform, the
party that has championed the
multicultural cause, lost the
Council of Presidents this spring
after holding it for three years.
• While it was once taboo to
express opposition to the multi-

cultural movement, students said,
it is now equally taboo to express
opposition to the movement's crit
ics.
Corey Davis, a senior in drama,
sees the change in the freshman
dorm where he is a resident assis
tant. Comments that would have
been put down as racist or sexist
in years past now get by with a
chorus of snickers, he said.
"People are really getting
quiet," Davis said. "The tide is
starting to swing to where people
who were really vocal about sex
ism and racism are almost afraid
to speak out."

Those interviewed pointed to

• The attention given to
"political correctness." The
development of the "PC" label has
given critics of the multicultural

even when their criticisms avoid

anti-multiculturalism is never to

• The "backlash." Nava's
Freshman Orientation speech is
only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down
our throats." Institutions like the

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went
unspoken by those critical of the
multicultural movement.
"To some extent we have had
multicultural overkill on this

warm fall evening in 1989.
That night, in Memorial Auditorium, she startled

might one day be here at Stanford. . . . Invested in
this sacrifice was the hope for me to have the oppor
tunities that she was never able to have, so al! of her
hopes and dreams were part of my hopes and
dreams."
With that speech, Nava crystallized the passion
and politics of Stanford's multicultural movement.
And, at the same time, she turned off a large number
of freshmen to a movement that had frequently
challenged the status quo through dramatic actions
and confrontational rhetoric.
Today, largely because of the reactions of the
freshmen in that auditorium and many other stu
dents across campus, the passion is gone. The drama
is rarely seen, the rhetoric rarely heard.
Stanford, the university that placed campus
racial interaction squarely on the national agenda in
the late 1980s, has realized that the road to multi
cultural understanding is longer and blocked by
more obstacles than it once thought. And after a
period of painful, public exploration, the student
community is quietly wrestling with the question of
what to do next while coping with new challenges:
• Student of color organizations, which spurred
the highly charged fight for empowerment and edu
cational rights, have turned their attention inward
in an attempt to strengthen their own communities
and reassess their goals.


Doug Davis — Dally
• Campus discussions of multi
cultural issues have been cur
tailed by an array of obstacles,
ranging from the threat of the
"politically correct" label to a
widespread weariness with pre
dictable, time-worn arguments to
the need to confront urgent finan
cial matters that strike at the very
heart of the University.
• Honest dialogue about multi
culturalism remains elusive at
one of the most critical moments
for the University, as efforts to
create an interactive, pluralistic
community are threatened by an
ever-tightening University bud
get.
"I think there's a lot of com
mitment, but people are confused
about what to do," said Keith
Archuleta, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Black Community Services Cen
ter. "The politics of the People's
Platform and Students First have
gotten in the way of what we are
really talking about: What's the
vision?"
Though attempts have been
made, Stanford has never agreed
on what the vision is. Interviews
with students leaders, adminis
trators and others reveal that two
things keep getting in the way —
emotions and a lack of the lan
guage necessary to fully address
the issues.
Today, the buzzword of the last
four years — "multiculturalism"
— is as vaguely defined as ever,
and no two definitions are the
same.
The modern "multicultural
movement" at Stanford,
broadly defined as the coalition of
groups that have worked to
empower students of color and
increase University support for
their interests, was born of the
civil rights movement of the
19605.
After a period of relative
latency, the movement awoke in
the mid-1980s to stake its claims
in the Western Culture debate.
The coalition of student groups
that fought for changes in the
freshman curriculum won a sig
nificant victory, and the People's
Platform party was created to
institutionalize the new-found
power of students of color.
A second turning point for
multiculturalism, many say, was
the 1989 completion of a study on
Stanford race relations by the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues — a study undertaken
in response to a demand by a
group of student of color organi
zations called the Rainbow Coali
tion.
The UCMI study included one
of the community's few serious
attempts at defining what the
Stanford community would look
like once it became fully "multi
cultural": "Above all else, our
vision is one of an interactive,
multiracial community of stu
dents, faculty and staff who share
a belief in mutual respect and who
view their racial and ethnic diver
sity as a unique asset," the report
reads.
With those battles won, how
ever, the multicultural movement
hit a third turning point in May
1989, when a coalition of groups
calling itself the Agenda for
Action organized the takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
The takeover ultimately
spurred the University into agree
ing to some of the coalition's
demands, such as hiring a full
time dean for the Chicano com
munity and a professor of Asian-
American studies. But disagree
ment over the tactic of barricad
ing a building tended to polarize
campus opinion on multicultural
issues.
In 1991, observers point to two
results of that polarization: Stu
dents have tended to avoid discus
sions of multiculturalism rather
than continue to hash them out,
and the general silence has forced
the student of color organizations
to re-evaluate what they're fight
ing for.
Consider the differences
between 1991 and years past:
• While the Western Culture
debate took place over an
extended period of time and
gained national attention, the
Faculty Senate this year
revamped the undergraduate dis
tribution requirements to include
the study of race and gender —
with hardly a comment from stu
dents.
• Freshmnn Orientation,
which once included "The Fire
Within" and other programs
aimed at increasing multicultural
understanding, this year was
toned down to the point that "we
did nothing" on such issues, said
multicultural educator Greg
Hicks.
• The People's Platform, the
party that has championed the
multicultural cause, lost the
Council of Presidents this spring
after holding it for three years.
• While it was once taboo to
express opposition to the multi-

cultural movement, students said,
it is now equally taboo to express
opposition to the movement's crit
ics.
Corey Davis, a senior in drama,
sees the change in the freshman
dorm where he is a resident assis
tant. Comments that would have
been put down as racist or sexist
in years past now get by with a
chorus of snickers, he said.
"People are really getting
quiet," Davis said. "The tide is
starting to swing to where people
who were really vocal about sex
ism and racism are almost afraid
to speak out."

Those interviewed pointed to
several reasons for the compara
tive silence on multicultural
issues:
• The attention given to
"political correctness." The
development of the "PC" label has
given critics of the multicultural
movement automatic legitimacy,
even when their criticisms avoid
substantive evaluation of real
issues, student leaders said.
"I see it as a conservative
attack on progressive change,"
said Mae Lee, a junior who has
been an ASSU senator and ran on
the People's Platform COP slate
this spring. "It's a label thrown
upon people and their work with
out examining the work they do.
People aren't examining the
issues for what they are any
more."
"This campus is so charged
with people feeling attacked for
their ideas," added Davis. "People
don't want to come off as thought
police. There's a stigma against
anyone who advocates traditional
leftist views."
According to Ricks, who coordi
nates multicultural education
programs for the Office of Resi
dential Education, "Some people
think even to talk about it is to
push it, that the only way to be
anti-multiculturalism is never to
mention it."
• The "backlash." Nava's
Freshman Orientation speech is
only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down
our throats." Institutions like the

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went
unspoken by those critical of the
multicultural movement.
"To some extent we have had
multicultural overkill on this
campus," said second-year law
student Peter Thiel, one of the
founders of The Review. "Rather
than just being a commitment to
intellectual diversity, it has
turned out to be a commitment to
a whole agenda. . . . People have
tried to force a cultural integra
tion that is very artificial."
Thiel continued, "I think peo
ple are still [policing thought]
with the same intensity they were
four years ago. Today, there are
people who will speak up and say
these are bad things. The Stan
ford Review has played some role;
it's made it permissible for people
to speak out."
Davis said, "White guilt got the
People's Platform elected. A lot of
white students have not resolved
their guilt, and instead of resolv
ing it, they got angry. Some of the
anger was legitimate; they were
taking a lot of shit from students
of color."
Students First leaders say that
they do not oppose the ideals
of the multicultural movement,
but that student services are the
larger umbrella under which mul
ticulturalism falls — not the
reverse.
"I'd like to think Students
First is a call back to campus,"
said COP-elect member John
Overdeck. "One reason we won is
the fact that student government
has almost exclusively been work
ing in these (multicultural) direc
tions. People are thinking, maybe
there's something more."
Nava, a member of the Council
of Presidents, said the backlash
against multiculturalism and the
success of Students First are part
of the same phenomenon. "Gains
were made," and changes of the
kind Stanford has seen can be a
scary thing, she said.
• Fatigue. "I think for a lot of
people who have been active
there's a lot of fatigue," Nava
said. "It comes from running into
so many obstacles. It makes peo
ple less responsive in some ways."
"Along with struggle, there
needs to be some sense of nor
malcy in people's lives," said
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of Student Affairs. "Students do
need to be students for a while
and not be in a constant struggle,
without losing sight of these ini
tiatives."
Some students active in the
multicultural movement said they
are also tired of constantly carry
ing the burden of teaching others
when they came to Stanford for
an education themselves.
"People are put in the role of
educator, and no one is really com
fortable with that," said Kaydee
Culbertson, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza

tion.
Alex Hoye, a member of Stu
dents First who ran on the party's
first COP slate two years ago, said
the multicultural message also
begins to fall on deaf ears when it
becomes repetitive.
"People get tired of people say
ing the same thing over and over.
What they were saying was sub
stantive, it just wasn't new," he
said.

'We have not really"

anything this year. .
It has a lot to do
with where the
community is at.'
— Maria Peters
=_=!

• A national swing away
from campus political action.
"People know this isn't a big stu
dent activism time right now,"
said Archuleta.
"The way Stanford is now, this
calm, is indicative of the entire
country," Lee added.
• The debate is taking place
in different arenas. That's the
assessment of James Lyons, who
last year retired after 18 years as
dean of Student Affairs. Lyons
notes that multiculturalism is
being discussed with more fervor

in the contexts of curriculum
diversity and faculty recruitment
than in student relations.
But leaders of student of color
groups emphasize that the disap
pearance of discussion among
many students doesn't mean that
the issues, too, have disappeared.
"The heat around these types
of issues is down, but they're still
things people consider impor
tant," said Ed Morimoto, outgoing
chair of the Asian American Stu
dent Association.
While opinions vary widely on
how to achieve many of the ideals
of multiculturalism, there is at
least tentative agreement on what
some of those basic ideals are —
and that some of them have been
integrated into the social fabric of
Stanford student life.
A structure that promotes
equality of educational opportu
nity, a curriculum that reflects the
historical contributions of more
than one culture and an atmo
sphere that supports the efforts of
all students regardless of back
ground are all broadly endorsed
goals.
"There's a much higher level of
awareness now than when I
arrived," said Overdeck, a second
year doctoral candidate who also
attended Stanford as an under
graduate. "There is significantly
more tolerance than there was
before. I feel we have gone some
where."
Though members of the stu
dent of color groups say they feel
some sense of accomplishment for
the gains of the last few years,
much work is left to be done, they
quickly add.
Student of color organizations
have, in the words of one leader,
pulled out of the spotlight and
turned their attention inward in
an attempt to "get a sense of what
we've done and what we're going
to do next." The change includes a
shift in focus from political
activism to cultural expression.
"We're trying to get back to our
earlier values — a sense of com
munity," Morimoto said. "AASA
has had an image dominated by its
politics, and I think the organiza
tion suffered. . . . We're making
sure people realize that's not all
that AASA's about. It's something
all the groups are going to have to
concentrate on."
"We have not really taken a
strong political stand on anything
this year," said sophomore Maria
Peters, outgoing co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "It has a lot to do with
where the community is at. . . .
We're trying to build a more cohe
sive community and get more peo
ple involved and active, so we
haven't been able to work on
broader issues."
Some groups are also attempt
ing to recover from the effects
of The Daily's reports last spring
that a Marxist-Leninist organiza
tion called the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle had recruited
several members of Stanford's
student of color organizations.
"That frightened a lot of peo
ple," said Angelique Jackson, out
going co-chair of SAIO. "They
didn't want to pursue the issues
anymore if they were going to be
personally attacked."
"People are very wary of any
thing we do," said MEChA's
Peters. "People don't know what
we are and what we do. They're
very cautious about whether to
come to our events, whether to
give us funding. I think it's still in
the back of people's minds."
This "down time" for student
of color groups is somewhat dan
gerous for them, however, because
it comes at the same time as the

University searches for places to
cut its operating budget.
"I don't think [student of color
groups] have been doing anything
for the last year and a half," said
Archuleta. "If white students are
tired of having multiculturalism
rammed down their throats,
who's doing the ramming?
"People are bullshitting each
other. Students are fighting
among themselves and allowing
administrators like me to set pri
orities with limited funds. The
institution as a whole is getting let
off the hook as long as students
bullshit each other about their
true feelings."
What's next for the multicul
tural movement? Some
reject the entire approach of the
last several years and question the
current role of the student of color
groups.
"I don't think much is going to
happen," said Thiel. "I'm not even
sure what would be next on the
multicultural agenda. I think it's
going to be a few years until we
get this re-rooted so we make
some real progress on this stuff."
If not everyone agrees with
that assessment, there is a grow
ing recognition that part of the
future of the multicultural move
ment will consist simply of decid
ing what it wants its future to be.
"It's going to be very difficult,
and it's going to be messy,"
Archuleta said. "If you admit
there's been injustice, there are
things that have to be worked out.
We move a little bit, then we give
up the ship."

, The institution as a
whole is getting let

— Keith Archuleta 1

Though the student of color
groups and other members of the
multicultural movement are not
certain of what steps to take next,
there is widespread agreement
that the method of deciding on
those steps will have to come
through honest, personal conver
sations between individuals.
"If we keep going at the pace
we're going at now, there will be
that energy again," Davis said. "It
has to be on a personal level. Peo
ple need to start being really hon
est about how they're feeling and
start recognizing the complexity
of issues."
Overdeck said, "One change is
that a lot of people no longer see
the University as the source of
change. The University will no
longer say, 'Let there be equality'
and it will happen. A lot of people
have to realize it's only going to be
multicultural if individuals choose
it and believe it."
Ingrid Nava looks back on her
work at Stanford, including her
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
with few regrets. "There's a lot of
issues that we've won. I feel the
discussion is at a very sophisti
cated level."
"I feel good that I was
involved," she says. "At the same
time, I feel that there's a long way
for it to go. Things are probably
not going to move as quickly in
the next couple of years as in the
years when I was involved. That
can be frustrating "


Doug Davis - Daily
Of all the things she has done as a student
leader at Stanford, Ingrid Nava is best
remembered for one speech she made on a
warm fall evening in 1989.
That night, in Memorial Auditorium, she startled
Stanford's newest crop of students with a fiery ora
tion challenging them to fight for progressive
change in the University.
"I am a Chicana from San Antonio, Texas, born to
a single mother who holds a job as a postal clerk,"
she said.
"She gave every day of her life to me, so that I
might one day be here at Stanford. . . . Invested in
this sacrifice was the hope for me to have the oppor
tunities that she was never able to have, so al! of her
hopes and dreams were part of my hopes and
dreams."
With that speech, Nava crystallized the passion
and politics of Stanford's multicultural movement.
And, at the same time, she turned off a large number
of freshmen to a movement that had frequently
challenged the status quo through dramatic actions
and confrontational rhetoric.
Today, largely because of the reactions of the
freshmen in that auditorium and many other stu
dents across campus, the passion is gone. The drama
is rarely seen, the rhetoric rarely heard.
Stanford, the university that placed campus
racial interaction squarely on the national agenda in
the late 1980s, has realized that the road to multi
cultural understanding is longer and blocked by
more obstacles than it once thought. And after a
period of painful, public exploration, the student

A second turning point for

the 1989 completion of a study on

With those battles won, how

hit a third turning point in May

calling itself the Agenda for
Action organized the takeover of
University President Donald

The takeover ultimately
spurred the University into agree

• The "backlash." Nava's
Freshman Orientation speech is
only one source of the backlash to
the multicultural movement.
Students and administrators
said the backlash, much of it by
white students, can also be traced
to the takeover, the labeling that
has accompanied much of the
debate and a sense that "multicul
turalism is being rammed down
our throats." Institutions like the

Students First political party and
The Stanford Review have given
voice to concerns that long went

multicultural movement.
"To some extent we have had
multicultural overkill on this

year doctoral candidate who also
attended Stanford as an under
graduate. "There is significantly
more tolerance than there was
before. I feel we have gone some
where."
Though members of the stu
dent of color groups say they feel
some sense of accomplishment for
the gains of the last few years,
much work is left to be done, they
quickly add.
Student of color organizations
have, in the words of one leader,
pulled out of the spotlight and
turned their attention inward in
an attempt to "get a sense of what
we've done and what we're going
to do next." The change includes a
shift in focus from political
activism to cultural expression.
"We're trying to get back to our
earlier values — a sense of com
munity," Morimoto said. "AASA
has had an image dominated by its
politics, and I think the organiza
tion suffered. . . . We're making
sure people realize that's not all
that AASA's about. It's something
all the groups are going to have to
concentrate on."
"We have not really taken a
strong political stand on anything
this year," said sophomore Maria
Peters, outgoing co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "It has a lot to do with
where the community is at. . . .
We're trying to build a more cohe
sive community and get more peo
ple involved and active, so we
haven't been able to work on
broader issues."
Some groups are also attempt
ing to recover from the effects
of The Daily's reports last spring
that a Marxist-Leninist organiza
tion called the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle had recruited
several members of Stanford's
student of color organizations.
"That frightened a lot of peo
ple," said Angelique Jackson, out
going co-chair of SAIO. "They
didn't want to pursue the issues
anymore if they were going to be
personally attacked."
"People are very wary of any
thing we do," said MEChA's
Peters. "People don't know what
we are and what we do. They're
very cautious about whether to
come to our events, whether to
give us funding. I think it's still in
the back of people's minds."
This "down time" for student
of color groups is somewhat dan
gerous for them, however, because
it comes at the same time as the

University searches for places to
cut its operating budget.
"I don't think [student of color
groups] have been doing anything
for the last year and a half," said
Archuleta. "If white students are
tired of having multiculturalism
rammed down their throats,
who's doing the ramming?
"People are bullshitting each
other. Students are fighting
among themselves and allowing
administrators like me to set pri
orities with limited funds. The
institution as a whole is getting let
off the hook as long as students
bullshit each other about their
true feelings."
What's next for the multicul
tural movement? Some
reject the entire approach of the
last several years and question the
current role of the student of color
groups.
"I don't think much is going to
happen," said Thiel. "I'm not even
sure what would be next on the
multicultural agenda. I think it's
going to be a few years until we
get this re-rooted so we make
some real progress on this stuff."
If not everyone agrees with
that assessment, there is a grow
ing recognition that part of the
future of the multicultural move
ment will consist simply of decid
ing what it wants its future to be.
"It's going to be very difficult,
and it's going to be messy,"
Archuleta said. "If you admit
there's been injustice, there are
things that have to be worked out.
We move a little bit, then we give
up the ship."

Though the student of color
groups and other members of the
multicultural movement are not
certain of what steps to take next,
there is widespread agreement
that the method of deciding on
those steps will have to come
through honest, personal conver
sations between individuals.
"If we keep going at the pace
we're going at now, there will be
that energy again," Davis said. "It
has to be on a personal level. Peo
ple need to start being really hon
est about how they're feeling and
start recognizing the complexity
of issues."
Overdeck said, "One change is
that a lot of people no longer see
the University as the source of
change. The University will no
longer say, 'Let there be equality'
and it will happen. A lot of people
have to realize it's only going to be
multicultural if individuals choose
it and believe it."
Ingrid Nava looks back on her
work at Stanford, including her
speech in Memorial Auditorium,
with few regrets. "There's a lot of
issues that we've won. I feel the
discussion is at a very sophisti
cated level."
"I feel good that I was
involved," she says. "At the same
time, I feel that there's a long way
for it to go. Things are probably
not going to move as quickly in
the next couple of years as in the
years when I was involved. That
can be frustrating "
