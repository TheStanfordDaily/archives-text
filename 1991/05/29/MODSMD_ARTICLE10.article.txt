# Laws may harm patients' privacy
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Administrators at Stanford Hospital
are finding themselves in disagreement
with new state laws that require report
ing the name of any individual hospital
ized in psychiatric wards to the govern
ment.
Starting this year, Cowell Student
Health Center and the Stanford Hospi
tal have been required to send the
names of students, faculty or staff who
are admitted to certain psychiatric
wards to the California Department of
Justice.
Previously, all records have been kept
strictly confidential, administrators
said.
The new laws were passed in January
to enable computerized background
checks of handgun purchasers. People
found to have a record of mental illness
would be prevented from buying a
firearm.
After having discussed the new laws
and their ramifications, hospital admin
istrators have decided to try to take

action against the laws, which they feel
violate a patient's privacy.
All members of the hospital staff
agree "the legislation should be modi
fied, but the strategy has not been
decided yet," said Carol Price, an associ
ate director of the hospital.
This legislation is "poorly thought
out and exceeds the bounds of what
would be necessary to protect the pub
lic," she added.
Few psychiatrists heard about the
laws when they were being formulated.
Because they were attached to the end
of a transportation bill, the laws
"sneaked pass us," said Dr. Kathleen
Unger, immediate past president of the
Northern California Psychiatric Society.
The laws are "obnoxious to the
humane and proper practice of
medicine, psychiatry, psychology and
related professions." said Dr. C. Peter
Rosenbaum, a professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences in the School of
Medicine. He said the database could
easily be unfairly used against individu
als without serious mental problems
who have been temporarily hospitalized

in psychiatric wards.
The laws require reporting to Sacra
mento both voluntary and forced admis
sions of patients to mental hospitals or
to psychiatric units in general hospitals
such as Stanford Hospital, he said.
Also affected are patients who trans
fer from medicine, surgery, or the emer
gency room (for instance, after treat
ment of an overdose), to these wards, he
added.
Asst. University Counsel Margaret
Eaton said, "Anything reported under
this specific statute is confidential" and
can only be used for two purposes:
• Gun shops are obliged to check the
names of people wanting to purchase
firearms against a specific list for
approval or disapproval of the sale, or
• Names can be use for court pur
poses, for example, in criminal proceed
ings.
Eaton also mentioned that there
exist "a number of analogous laws
which place people's names on lists."
For instance, registering for a driver's
license also puts information about indi
viduals onto a roster, she said.
