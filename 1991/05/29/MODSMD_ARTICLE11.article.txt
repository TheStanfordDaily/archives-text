# New dean will inherit smaller budget, office
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
When Michael Jackson takes over as
Stanford's new dean of students June
17, he will inherit an office radically dif
ferent from the one long-time dean
James Lyons left when he retired last
year.
Lyons, who was dean of Student
Affairs from 1977 to 1990, supervised an
office with a budget of $13 million and a
staff of 150; Jackson, who was named
dean of students May 15, will supervise
an office with a budget of only $4 million
and a staff of 70 v
These reductions are the result of two
factors: the streamlining of the office,
which will go into effect when Jackson
takes over; and last year's 15 percent cut
in Student Affairs's budget — a $1.5 mil
lion reduction.
The streamlining of the office was
proposed by acting Vice President for
Student Resources Sally Mahoney in
January.
As a result, many of the office's most
costly services — including the Office of
Residential Education, Cowell Student
Health Center and the Career Planning
and Placement Center — will be
removed from Jackson's supervision and
will instead report to Mahoney.
Jackson, currently associate dean of
student affairs, will also report to
Mahoney, rather than directly to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, as the

dean of student affairs did.
He added that despite the reduction
in the office's scope, he approves of the
changes.
Jackson said they will allow him to
focus on the welfare of students, as the
job intends, rather than dealing with
administrative matters.
"I'll be in closer communication with
students, helping them directly," Jack
son said.
Mahoney agreed. "It's a more focused
deanship," she said. "The dean of stu
dents is now concerned with student
welfare in a hands-on way — he can have
direct contact with students."
The streamlining of the office will
also reduce its complexity, Jackson said.
Before the changes, "We were begin
ning to see what a large job it was," he
said. "Now it focuses less on general
administration. It reduces the complexi
ties within the job."
One of the few responsibilities added
to the office is the Bechtel International
Center, a move intended to aid Jackson's
efforts to develop effective multicultural
programs.
Mahoney and Jackson both said more
budget cuts in student services are
expected next year, as a result of the Uni
versity's $95 million operating deficit
over the next two years.
"We're going to be making some
tough choices," Jackson said.
