Meeting reconciles Syria, PLO
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — President Hafez
Assad met yesterday with a high-ranking PLO
delegation, signaling a possible end to an eight
year rift that has been a major obstacle in the
Middle East peace process.
"A new era has started between Syria and
the PLO," said Farouk al-Kaddoumi, the head
of the delegation and the Palestine Liberation
Organization's "foreign minister."
The PLO under chairman Yasser Arafat has
been at odds with Assad since 1983, when the
Syrians backed Palestinian radicals in a mutiny
against Arafat because of his moves to negoti
ate a peace treaty with Israel.
The PLO and the Arab states want an inter
national peace conference convened under
United Nations auspices, with the participation
of the European Community.
North Korea will apply to join
U.N. simultaneously with South
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In a major
diplomatic turnabout, Communist North
Korea said yesterday it would apply to join the
United Nations simultaneously with longtime
rival South Korea.
The surprise announcement is a break
through in four decades of bitterly hostile rela
tions between the two Koreas and could push
forward dialogue on easing political and mili
tary tensions.
The statement from the North Korean for
eign ministry is seen as North Korea's first
major initiative toward expanding relations
and opening its closed, reclusive society to the
world. Observers see the North's opening as
essential to securing lasting peace and security
in the North Pacific.
