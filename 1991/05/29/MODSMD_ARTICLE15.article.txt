# NATO leaders adopt new strategy

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
other NATO defense chiefs agreed yes
terday to create a rapid reaction corps as
part of plans to redesign the Western
forces in an era of vastly reduced ten
sions.
The force, which will draw together
air, land and sea units, will allow the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
rush troops quickly to danger spots any
where in Europe. A senior U.S. Defense
Department official said the corps would
include U.S. forces.
The decision marks a first step in
NATO's efforts to streamline its forces
and hone a new defense strategy for the
coming years to take into account the
collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the once
mighty Eastern military alliance.
"There will be a million less ... troops
within Eastern Europe against whom
our defensive strategy has been con
structed," said British Defense Secre
tary Tom King.
"There's no longer a need to defend
Europe against a sudden invasion from
the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact,"
said Pete Williams, spokesman for the
U.S. Defense Department. "So NATO is
evolving a new strategy."
The new rapid reaction force.

expected to be in place in the mid-1990s
under British command, would be one
of three components of the future
NATO forces. The others would be the
main defense force able to protect
alliance territory in a conflict, and rein
forcements to bolster the other units.
A senior Pentagon official said the
United States would certainly con
tribute transportation and active forces
to the rapid reaction corps, but that the
character and size of the U.S. forces
have not been determined.
"The United States certainly wants
to contribute and will make a contribu
tion to that corps," the U.S. official said
on condition of anonymity.
Officials said yesterday that the rapid
reaction corps will be composed of at
least four divisions — two British and
two multinational. The United States
might chip in a fifth, King said. A divi
sion is usually about 15,000 soldiers.
The corps' key job will be to deploy to
areas across the NATO territory in
times of crisis.
As examples, officials cited political
unrest in Eastern Europe, most notably
the Soviet Union, the continent's
largest military power.
But the rapid deployment force could
also reinforce NATO's southern flank

that borders the Middle East and was
most recently under threat of an Iraqi
attack during the Gulf War, officials
said.
The unit could become the kernel for
a future European defense force that
could rush to crises outside NATO terri
tory.
Ideas for a European force have been
tossed around in discussions of whether
the West Europeans should have a com
mon defense policy. Interest in a new
defense arrangement has surfaced with
ambitious plans for a political union of
the 12 nations of the European Commu
nity. All but neutral Ireland belong to
NATO.
At a summit last July in London, the
16 NATO leaders called for a revamped
military strategy that would rely less on
nuclear weapons and require fewer
troops in Germany, the strategic center
of Europe.
They were expected to meet again,
possibly in Rome in November, to adopt
their new strategy, now in its sixth
draft.
Fewer troops will be stationed in Ger
many, the front-line country during the
Cold War. The United States plans to
reduce by about half its 300,000 forces
in Western Europe.
