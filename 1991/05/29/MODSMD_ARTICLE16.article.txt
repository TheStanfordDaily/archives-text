ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Saddam
Hussein, in what was described as his
first interview with a foreign newspaper
since the Persian Gulf War, accused the
allies of trying to set up a puppet state in
northern Iraq.
In the interview, published yesterday
in the Turkish newspaper Milliyet, the
Iraqi president also urged that interna
tional sanctions against Iraq be lifted
now that the war is over.
The United States and Britain have
blocked moves to lift U.N.-imposed sanc
tions on Iraq as long as Saddam remains
in power.
" The Kuwait problem is over," Sad
dam was quoted as saying. "Then why is

the United States still following a policy
of starving the Iraqi people? Why is it
still besieging Iraq? We have sustained
so many wounds, so many arrows were
fired at us, but still we did not bow to
oppression."
The interview was conducted over
the weekend in Baghdad by former Pre
mier Bulent Kcevit, leader of Turkey's
small opposition Democratic Leftist
Party.
In it, Saddam denounced the U.S.-led
operation to save Kurds in northern
Iraq, and accused Western troops in
northern Iraq of encouraging a break
away Kurdish state.
Hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled

to the mountains bordering Iran and
Turkey after Saddam's troops cracked
down on their postwar uprising. To
encourage them to return, the allies set
up a "security zone" in northern Iraq
The allies have said they want to
leave the area as soon as the United
Nations and other civilian organizations
ran care for the Kurds.
Ecevit, who was prime minister twice
in the 19705, said Saddam appeared to
have "lost weight and was less ebullient
and more pensive." But he said the Iraqi
leader was "still confident of his people's
support."
Saddam said he looked forward to a
resumption of close ties with Turkey.
