LONDON (AP) â€” Meles Zenawi, the
rebel chief who took over yesterday as
Ethiopia's temporary leader, pledged to
start forming a provisional government
within a month under a U.S.-brokered
agreement.
"We are well on the way to resolving all
our political problems and defining a demo
cratic future for our country," said Zenawi.
36, a onetime admirer of Albania. "We are
not going after retribution."
Zenawi spoke to reporters at the London
offices of his Ethiopian People's Revolu
tionary Democratic Front, the main rebel
group, soon after a U.S. mediator
announced the Front would take over until
the provisional government is formed.
Famine relief aid can now be distributed
smoothly after 30 years of the civil war,
Zenawi said, calling on foreign countries to
step up help.
Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of
state for African affairs, announced the
agreement hours after the forces of the
Front entered the encircled Ethiopian capi
tal, Addis Ababa, early yesterday.
Cohen said the provisional government
will be charged with holding democratic
elections under international supervision
within a year.
"In the meantime the EPRDF will
assume state responsibility in Addis Ababa
pending the formation of a broad-based
provisional government," he said.
Cohen said the rebel groups will "wel
come the presence of the United States and
other international observers."
The takeover of the capital by the
Front's forces marked the final collapse of
the administration one week after the flight
into exile of its president, Mengistu Haile
Mariam. He had headed a dictatorial
regime for 17 years.

The Tigrean-dominated Ethiopian Peo
ple's Revolutionary Democratic Front
(EPRDF) is the largest of three rebel
groups at peace talks in London mediated
by Cohen.
The others are the Eritrean People's Lib
eration Front, whose prime interest in the
peace deal was securing a commitment for a
referendum on independence for the coun
try's northern province, and the Oromo
Liberation Front.
Eritrean independence has been opposed
by the Revolutionary Democratic Front,
but Zenawi said it would stick to its agree
ment on the referendum.
The Eritrean delegation said the agree
ment was "positive." But the Oromos, who
have fought in the south, expressed some
disquiet.
"It seems the Americans have already
decided for the EPRDF to take power in
Addis," said Oromo spokesman Dima
Noggo. "We feel we have been left out."
The prime minister of the defeated
Ethiopian administration, Tesefaye Dinka,
boycotted yesterday's talks. He had walked
out of preliminary sessions with Cohen on
Monday after the U.S. official urged the
Front to send in its forces into Addis Ababa.
Zenawi, speaking against a backdrop of
the Revolutionary Democratic Front's red
flag emblazoned with a Soviet-made
Kalashnikov rifle, said the provisional gov
ernment could include "some members of
the present government who are not
tainted with crimes of the past."
He said "peace and order has now been
reestablished in Addis Ababa" and that he
would be returning to the capital "very
soon."
In recent public statements, the Front
has moved away from its pro-Communist
views as it gained military victories.
