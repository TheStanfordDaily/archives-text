This fall, a panel composed of faculty,
students, and Overseas Studies and Latin
American studies administrators will eval
uate the success of the Santiago program,
said Corbin Smith, deputy director of Over
seas Studies.
Smith said there was a "strong interest
in the program" and feels optimistic that it
will be retained.
"Our feeling now is that it's been a good
program," he said. The question now is,
"how to find funding for it since we do not

gram."
Smith said the center has been depend

overseas fees.
The Chilean center needs to establish a
permanent funding base for administrative
costs, such as communication with main
campus, library materials and professor
visits, Smith said. Salary and living
expenses for the local director of the pro
gram also must be accounted for, he added.
"We're not clear where the funding for
the program will come from," Smith said.
"There is a potential to reallocate money
from existing programs."
Many students who are planning to go to
Chile next spring are just beginning to real

gram is not being canceled indefinitely, the
