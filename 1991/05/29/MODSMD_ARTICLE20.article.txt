Ruling in abortion case
will endanger poor by
cutting off information

THE SUPREME COURT last
week upheld a federal regula
tion that bars employees of
federally financed family planning
clinics from all discussion of abor
tion with their patients.
By a narrow 5-4 ruling, the
court affirmed the constitutional
ity of the regulation. Its wisdom,
however, is another story.
The rule threatens medical care
for low-income women by termi
nating funding for medical clinics
whose doctors and managers pro
vide information to patients about
abortion or mention abortion —
which is legal in 49 states — as a
valid medical alternative.
The regulation encroaches on
the doctor's right to free speech,
prohibiting physicians from men
tioning abortion to patients and
requiring them to respond to ques
tions about abortion by saying
abortion is "not considered ... an
appropriate method of family plan
ning."
The regulation also violates
medical ethics that require doctors
to provide patients with complete
information about their choices.
The regulation puts family plan
ning clinics that provide medical
information and references to low
income pregnant mothers in a
Catch-22. Either they can keep
silent about the existence of abor
tion as a medical alternative, or
they can give up the federal aid
that enables them to operate. Con
sequently, a number of family plan
ning clinics that provide badly
needed health care information are
threatened.
The result is likely to be yet
another blow to the already dismal

health care that is available in the
United States for those with low
incomes.
By making aid for medical care
conditional on doctors' agreeing
with the Bush administration's
stand on abortion, the government
is putting politics ahead of what
should be the goal of federally
financed medical care: adequate
and comprehensive health care for
those who can't afford it.
The federal government seems
increasingly bent on carrying out
this type of policy by the purse
strings, making participation in its
social, educational and medical
programs conditional on compli
ance in other realms.
Thus, the clinics that provide
free medical information to low
income citizens won't be able to
continue to do so unless they keep
silent about a medical procedure
which is legal in almost every state.
Stanford saw the same tech
nique applied when drug czar Bob
Martinez threatened the Univer
sity with loss of education funding
if it didn't agree to fire Stuart
Reges, an award-winning com
puter science lecturer whose
stance on national drug policy
drew Martinez's ire.
Instead of arresting Reges itself,
the federal government forced the
University into a position of tacit
agreement with its policy — by
threatening to cut off funding for
education.
Congress' discussion of the
Hyde bill, legislation that would
regulate the ability of federally
funded universities' to make their
own codes regarding speech and
conduct, suggests the government
may continue to use such tactics.
Sure, such actions are within
the government's legal power. But
it is also an abuse of that power.
The Supreme Court had the
chance to correct that abuse.
Unfortunately, it came one justice
short of doing so.
