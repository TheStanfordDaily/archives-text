The insults put forth by
Jesse Bart Blackwelder in his May
23 letter to The Daily are demean
ing to Stanford students and are wholly
unfounded.
We are inspired that Blackwelder
finds himself so concerned with "the lack
of commitment to excellence displayed b>
the staff, the administration and espe
cially the students" here at Stanford.
While unable to speak for the student
body as a whole, we personally know
many students here that have worked
harder than they ever believed they
could. By all reasonable standards, Stan
ford students are NOT lazy.
Blackwelder's conception of commit
ment to academics is ridiculous. Commit
ment does not require attending every
professor's office hours and spending all
of one's free time in the basement of
Green Library. We can attest to the fact
that "the skills and habits that will carry
fus] through life" will not, as Black
welder claims, be learned in the library.
Blackwelder should also look toward
social interaction for the experiences that
will allow for a satisfying life.

Blackwelder blames Stanford's "cul
tural clubs and various other organiza
tions" for emphasizing "everything but
scholastic achievement." The presence of
ethnic organizations in the Stanford
community does not detract from stu
dents' academic commitment.
Furthermore, we believe many varsity
athletes, student associations and other,
so-called "superficial and extra" organi
zations are insulted by Blackwelder's
denigration of their work ethic and his
belittling of the importance of their soci
eties to the Stanford community. The
mere concept that the rugby team should
strive for scholastic accomplishment
while involved in a ruck is ludicrous.
Many members of such extracurricular
activities participate to escape their
strenuous academic environment.
We are concerned that Blackwelder
assumes every one at Stanford should fit
the same robotic mold: study, study,
study. That is not what life is all about.
