# Quality of Stanford research dependent on survival of AIR
## 
### 
This letter is in response to the
announcement that Academic Informa
tion Resources may disband.
As regular users of AlR's published
materials and consulting services, we
were rather shocked that the University
had even considered this prospect. When
first arriving on campus as graduate stu
dents, we asked how we, as technologi
cally illiterate social science students,
could obtain information about comput
ing on campus, and were directed imme

diately to AIR.
The AIR consultants have proven
invaluable to us and others in our posi
tion. Also, AIR consultants have helped
with orientation to personal computing
packages as well as with glitches experi
enced in word processing.
Users, especially those in the social
sciences, will spend a great amount of
time frustrated, using methods of trial
and error if there is no longer someone
designated to help introduce students to
computing systems.
We also find it surprising that the
assistant vice president for Library and
Information Resources said it is doubtful
any students or faculty will be selected
for the task force in charge of disbanding
AIR "because of the tremendous time

commitment the job will involve." A deci
sion with so much importance should
not be made without including the users
of the system on the task force. Wrong
decisions could prove more costly to fix
than what is in place now.
In its rush to save money, is Stanford
shooting itself in the foot? What else is
one to conclude when the University is
beginning to dismantle the supports for
one of its main "commodities" —
research and information.
Regarding the AlRport Macintosh
cluster at Tresidder Memorial Student
Union, another of the items that will be
affected by the budget cuts, the Univer
sity needs to be equally careful about
how this group of computers is handled.
Considering its heavy use, AlRport is

obviously popular with Stanford stu
dents. Any proposal that in any way
shrinks access to computing will neces
sarily hurt students who cannot afford
to buy computers themselves.
The University needs to proceed care
fully in its budget-cutting. The Univer
sity's reputation is only as good as the
quality of information it generates
through research.
If anything, the University should
spend to improve the quality of informa
tion to which its students and faculty
will have access and then in turn pro
duce.
