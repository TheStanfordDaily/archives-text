# Ed Heinemann
## Ed knows apocalyptic doom 
### 
WELL, THAT WAS A QUICK four
and a half months. Thirteen
columns down, one to go. I've
been told I'd better make the last one a
good one, or I'll end up with a band
named after me; to be totally honest, it's
not a huge worry of mine. "The Ed Heine
mann Experience" just doesn't have a
great ring to it.
Picking an appropriate note to bow out
on wasn't easy; my column topics have
been scattered, to say the least, and I just
couldn't find a decent Common Theme to
bring to glorious resolution. So I decided
to do something I'd managed scrupu
lously to avoid for 13 weeks: I got journal
istic.
I went to my closest and dearest
friends and asked them what they
thought my column was about. After
three people said "Dude! You write a col
umn? No way!" two looked confused and
one burst into laughter, I was almost
ready to give up, but I persisted and
finally elicited a thoughtful answer from
my friend Sal.
Sal scratched his chin. Then his nose.
Then his elbow. He gave me a pensive
stare, then rumbled in an ominous voice:
"It's about apocalyptic doom."
I didn't know quite what that meant,
so I asked for an elaboration. Sal nodded,
scratched himself again and let me have
it: "Yeah, you tell us the world's a mess
and that it's our fault and there's nothing
we can do about it. Doom, basically.
Sometimes you're funny, too."
I've always had a hard time taking a
compliment, so I focused on the doom
part. And reflected. And dissected. And

came to the conclusion that although Sal
had an overdeveloped sense of drama and
a nasty skin problem, he had a point, and
there was no denying it.
I've been unfair. For 13 weeks, I've
complained about the big, ugly world and
its big, ugly social problems and big, ugly
institutions and big, ugly people, and I
haven't offered any decent solutions.
To finish off the volume, I will now
give all the answers. No more cries of
injustice. No more complaints about the
futility of trying to battle the evils of the
world. Just a few simple things that you
can do all by yourself to make the world a
better place — many of them in under
five minutes!
1. The Environment! — Sell your car;
public transportation will get you just
about anywhere you really need to go.
While you're at it, throw away your desk
lamp and your hair dryer.
Stop eating meat; it takes 650 gallons
of water to produce one hamburger, let
alone Wilbur meat loaf. Lose the leather
shoes; burn your Birkenstocks. And pick
up every piece of trash you see on the
ground today.
As for that three feet by two feet by
two feet mound o' trash that's been grow
ing in the corner of your room since you
last took out the garbage three months
ago, do yourself and the environment a
favor: Throw it away.
2. Social Injustice! — Once you have a
job, give 40 percent of your salary to char
itable organizations. Or take a $25,000
public service job instead of a $40,000
"real" job.
The next time someone stops you on

the street and asks you for money, take
some time to talk to her and find out how
she got there; try not to walk away too
quickly.
Let a homeless person sleep on your
floor for a week, then give him $100 and a
change of clothes. Sure, you might need
the money, but who needs it more?
3. Social Oppression! — Go to a meet
ing of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford, and try not to squirm. The next
time you feel the need to reassure some
one that you're heterosexual, even
though you support homosexual causes,
don't.
At your next meal, sit at a table where
no one else is of your race. Eat slowly.
Don't leave until you've had a legitimate
conversation with someone whose cul
tural background you know nothing
about.
Sure, these things are pretty piddling
compared to corporate pollution and a
fractured welfare system and institu
tional racism. They won't counteract a
screwed-up judicial system and a
screwed-up legislature and a screwed-up
chief executive. But they're ours to do.
The world is out there waiting to be
changed, and nobody's stopping us but
us.

"The Ed Heinemann Experience" is look
ing for a good drummer.
