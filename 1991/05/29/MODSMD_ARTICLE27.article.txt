## Electron beams to purify local water 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
As the Cold War thawb and once
alert nuclear missiles molder in their
silos, a technology once envisioned as
part of the "Star Wars" defense sys
tem has found a new enemy: Palo Alto
waste water.
The city of Palo Alto has hired a
local firm, Nutek Corporation, to
install a high-tech water treatment
system that will purify waste water
before it is dumped into the San Fran
cisco Bay. The system will use high
energy electron beams — once
researched by defense planners as a
means of destroying intercontinental
ballistic missiles in flight — to elimi
nate microorganisms and toxic chemi
cals from Palo Alto sewage.
The water treatment setup will be
the first of its kind, said Nutek Opera
tions Manager Jeff Bialy. A smaller
Nutek system already uses the same
principle to sterilize medical waste.
Using a converted X-ray machine as a
source of electrons, Nutek bombards
biohazardous medical garbage — sur
gical gloves and gowns, disposable
syringes, as well as other items —
with electrons that have energies of a
few million electron-volts.
(An electron-volt, or "eY" is a unit
of energy. One eV is defined as the
amount of energy possessed by a sin
gle electron after it is accelerated
through one volt of electric potential.)
The high-energy electron beam
destroys any bacteria or viruses that
might be infecting the medical waste.
The waste water treatment appara
tus will operate along similar lines. A
stream of waste water will pass
through electron beams produced by
two accelerator units. These units are

small compared to their older relative
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center: While the 2-mile SLAC injec
tor produces particles with energies
on the order of 30 billion eY the Palo
Alto units will measure 5 feet long and
accelerate electrons to about 5 million
eV
The large beam energies will
directly destroy most microorganisms
living in the water. Additionally, the
beams' electrons will convert ordinary
water molecules into "free radicals" —
highly reactive compounds that will
attack molecules of organic poisons,
rendering them harmless by turning
them into nontoxic residues.
The free radicals, along with hydro
gen peroxide produced by the electron
beam, also contribute to the destruc
tion of disease-causing microbes.
Nutek's preliminary tests of the
procedure — performed on small sam
ples of contaminated water — indicate
that the method "works very well on
those scales and should be very effec
tive when the full-scale system is
installed," Bialy said. "We're getting
good kills at a relatively low beam
energy level. Mainly, now we're look
ing at how we're going to incorporate
the units into the present system."
Some technical barriers remain to
be overcome. Nutek must determine
the optimal energies for use in the
Palo Alto facility. More importantly,
the company must find an easy and
efficient way to incorporate the beam
generators into the existing water
treatment system without interfering
significantly with the current setup's
operation.
Despite the remaining challenges,
Bialy predicts that if all goes well the
system will be in place before the end
of 1991.

The accelerators may also be used
to process the "sludge," or solid por
tion, of Palo Alto's sewage. Currently,
the sludge is separated from the liquid
effluent and then transported to
Phoenix, Ariz., to be incinerated.
Because the unprocessed sludge quali
fies as toxic waste, such long-distance
shipping is expensive and dangerous.
But after the effluent treatment
system is up and running, Nutek may
help the city avoid its large sludge
bills. Sterilizing the solid waste —
using a variation of the same high
energy electron beam procedure —
will allow safer and cheaper sludge
shipment.
One of the system's main advan
tages over previous waste-treatment
procedures is that it avoids potentially
dangerous chemical processing of con
taminated water. Currently, water
waste from everywhere in the Palo
Alto area is brought to a common
purification plant where it is chlori
nated, allowed to sit for 48 hours and
chlorinated again. Sulfur dioxide is
added to remove some of the chlorine.
"Then," Bialy said, "they just
dump it into the Bay," where remain
ing chlorine and sulfur dioxide
residues may have a detrimental effect
on the Bay ecosystem.
The electron-beam system, how
ever, does not rely on added chemicals
to treat waste water.
"This approach is an ideal system
where it can be an alternative to
chemical treatment with chlorine and
other substances," says Bialy. "In Palo
Alto, for example, heavy chemical
treatment isn't desirable because the
treated water is discharged into the
lower end of the San Francisco Bay,
where there is not much tidal flushing
to remove it."

But after the effluent treatment
system is up and running, Nutek may
help the city avoid its large sludge
bills. Sterilizing the solid waste —
using a variation of the same high
energy electron beam procedure —
will allow safer and cheaper sludge
shipment.
One of the system's main advan
tages over previous waste-treatment
procedures is that it avoids potentially
dangerous chemical processing of con
taminated water. Currently, water
waste from everywhere in the Palo
Alto area is brought to a common
purification plant where it is chlori
nated, allowed to sit for 48 hours and
chlorinated again. Sulfur dioxide is
added to remove some of the chlorine.
"Then," Bialy said, "they just
dump it into the Bay," where remain
ing chlorine and sulfur dioxide
residues may have a detrimental effect
on the Bay ecosystem.
The electron-beam system, how
ever, does not rely on added chemicals
to treat waste water.
"This approach is an ideal system
where it can be an alternative to
chemical treatment with chlorine and
other substances," says Bialy. "In Palo
Alto, for example, heavy chemical
treatment isn't desirable because the
treated water is discharged into the
lower end of the San Francisco Bay,
where there is not much tidal flushing
to remove it."
