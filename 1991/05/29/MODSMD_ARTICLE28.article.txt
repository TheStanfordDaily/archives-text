# Infant-biorhythm study seeks volunteers
## 
### Chris Patil Editorial staff 
Stanford researchers are recruiting
normal, full-term newborn babies for a
study of sleep/wake patterns and the
development of circadian rhythms. The
study will explore the connections
between these natural biological
rhythms and a phenomenon known as
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
Every year, as many as 10,000
healthy babies die in their sleep, without
warning and — despite years of research

on SIDS — without a cause that modern
doctors can identify. For infants
between 1 and 12 months old, SIDS is
the leading cause of death.
The Pediatric SIDS Research Pro
gram at Stanford is seeking parents of
full-term, healthy babies who will allow
researchers to study their infants for
three continuous days at the age of 1
month and again at the age of 3 months.
The infants will be monitored by a
microprocessor that will record biologi
cal data about the infants.
All monitoring techniques to be used

by the study are safe and not intrusive,
researchers say.
"All of these monitoring methods
have been used clinically for many years
and are very safe," says Margaret Boed
diker, R.N., one of the project's coordi
nators. "The tape we use to attach the
sensors is the most uncomfortable
part."
For information, potential volunteers
should call Boeddiker at the Department
of Pediatrics, Stanford Medical Center,
