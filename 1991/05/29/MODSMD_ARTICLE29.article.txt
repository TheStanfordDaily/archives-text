# Bug debunks Coke myths, reveals source of birdsong
## 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
A couple of people have called to tell me
that those uninformed and unsure about
birth control might have read last week's
Science Bug revelation o' fun (the one
about Coca-Cola and sperm), thought, "Oh,
since I read it in The Daily, it must be true"
and then run out and bought themselves a
12-pack of Diet Coke for contraceptive pur
poses.
Since I have my suspicions that anyone
at Stanford really has sex in the first place,
I can't say that I'm completely in accord
with that opinion. My initial reaction to
their concern was that anyone who would
actually think such a thing has no business
risking procreation in the first place. On
the other hand, there are some ignorant
folk out there who know more about the
War of 1812 and the !Kung tribe than they
do about their own reproductive system.
So here's the pitch: Don't use Coke as a
contraceptive. It won't work. That's all
there is to it. And if you don't understand,
there are plenty of people who'd be happy to
explain it.
But I'm just the Science Bug. I answer
questions, and I try to do it in an interest
ing and somewhat humorous manner. I
can't hold myself responsible for anyone
else's stupidity. Jeez, if I did, I'd never get
any work done — and I'm having enough
problems as it is.
And now, the relevant topic. Today's
query comes to us from the Science Bug box
and was written on the back of an inter
departmental envelope (reduce, reuse, recy
cle). It is as follows:
Q. Why do birds sing so gay? And lovers
'.away the springtime play? Why do
they fall in 10-ove?

First of all, I'm pretty sure her name was
Velma — but jinkies, I could be wrong. It's
happened before.
Considering the fact that the general
theme of my column as of late has been sex,
I was not surprised to discover that the rea
son birds sing so gay is pretty much the rea
son anyone does almost anything (except
Oprah Winfrey) — namely, sex.
Many male songbirds attract females by
singing. There's even a special section of the
avian brain devoted to singing. This "song
center" is four times as large in males than
in females, since it's the males that have to
attract the females by impressing them with
song. So females sing very little — after all,
what do they have to sing about? They have
to sit around on eggs, and then take care of
the kids, do the laundry . . .

Sorry.
Anyway, these "song centers" are located
in the left lobe of the brain, and the size of
the center depends on the repertoire of the
bird. So, if there's a species of bird that only
knows one song ("The Lion Sleeps
Tonight," for example), the song center of
that species will be very small.
The region of the brain that controls
song also changes in an individual bird,
depending on the season. In the early
spring, when mating occurs, the region
swells in size due to an increase in testos
terone — the hormone of all hormones,
which also turns sweet little boys into
rebellious hairy glands. (OK, so it happens
to women too . . .jeez, sometimes I feel like
I have to insult everyone equally, or I'll vio
late the Fundamental Standard.)
If castrated male birds (who do not sing)
or female birds are injected with testos
terone, they will also sing, but their musical
repertoires will never become as large or as
varied as that of uncastrated males.
Singing is also used to claim territory; a
male will sing to warn away other males. In
some cases, establishing a territory is one
way a male bird seeks a female. In the case
of the bowerbird, males secure territory
and build bowers, which are nest-like struc
tures decorated with flowers, fruit, shells
and other bright objects.
Some species actually paint their bowers
with crushed plants and charcoal, using
bits of bark as brushes. Males attack other
males' bowers and steal their ornaments
and generally act like a bunch of guys play-

ing touch football "just for fun."
Here's an interesting fact: The
more attractive the bird, the less
attractive his bower is. It's the
plain, everyday, Joe Six-pack
bowerbirds that make the most
beautiful nests. (I sense a univer
sal message in there, but it's not
completely clear yet.)
After building the bower, the
male sings to females who
approach, trying to get them to
enter his territory. Eventually a
female chooses a male, mates
with him and then builds her own
small utilitarian nest near the
bower. She cares for the eggs and
raises the young entirely on her

own.
So that's why birds sing so gay.
As for the other parts of the ques
tion — why lovers away the
springtime play, and why they fall
in love — I must defer. You see,
bugs don't fall in love — for us,
it's all pheromonal. (No need to
feel sorry for me, though — bugs
also have an amazingly short life
span, so usually they don't even
know what they're missing.)
Until next time, all you little
birds on Jaybird Street . . .

fact she can order lunch at Arby's
