# Senate approves money for Greek charity events
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
"This is making last year's senate look like a
paragon of efficiency."
That statement by ex-senator and current hear
ings officer Jason Moore summed up last night's
ASSU Senate meeting.
In the final meeting of the new senate before they
reconvene next fall, three bills were passed during
the first three hours.
The senate approved funding two sorority philan
thropy events that had been rejected by last year's
senate during a marathon, eight-hour budget meet
ing last week.
Delta Gamma's Anchor Splash and Kappa Alpha
Theta's Theta Breakers both received their
requested funding despite concerns about the ASSU
Bylaws and the community service aspect of the
events.
The senate spent almost 45 minutes debating
whether supporting the events
through annual discretionary
funds would be constitutional.
After finally deciding that it was
allowed by the bylaws, the senate
then proceeded to change the
source of money to the commu
nity service board to avoid any
more bylaw questions.
Some senators also argued
that ASSU funding of the events
basically allows the sororities to
write a check to the national char
ity of their choice without allow
ing students to do direct commu
nity service work.
But Delta Gamma member
Katie Nason argued that Anchor

Splash brings out many people in
the Stanford community and
raises awareness about the issues.
She said the sororities
deserved consideration again
because the previous senate had
voted "because of anti-Greek atti
tudes" and was more preoccupied
by "the Greek issue than the mer
its of our event."
The senate also increased the
previous senate allocation to the
Stanford India Project to almost
$2,000. The money will fund four
students who are traveling to
India to work with Mother
Theresa's group in Calcutta.
After the senate ruled that
funding the group would not vio
late the bylaws, the organization
still faced objections from some
senators who questioned funding
a trip for only four students.

Sorority members
said the previous
senate vote was
based on anti-Greek
attitudes.

But graduate senator Jay
Bhattacharya accused the senate
of being hypocritical in funding
the sororities but not the welfare
work in India.
Graduate senator James Vera
also explained at length to the
senate that students would be
going out into the community to
perform service, which is the
exact purpose of the ASSU's com
munity service funding.
Enrique Origgi, who will be

participating in the service,
promised that the group would
make presentations to dormito
ries throughout campus next year
when they return from India.
Before the meeting, adminis
trative manager Sophia Shing
held a barbecue for the senators
to get to know one another.
In other senate action, the sen
ate approved the University com
mittee selections by the Nomina
tions Commission and the board
of directors for the recently
approved financial aid office.
The senate continued debate
early this morning, still consider
ing bills involving the special-fee
refund process and senate clerical
positions.
