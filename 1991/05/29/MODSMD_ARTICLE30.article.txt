# Always ask yourself: Which disk is which?
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The floppy disk has been around since
long before the Macintosh was even a glint in
the eye of Steve Jobs. When Apple first
introduced an external floppy drive for the
venerable Apple 11, it held what was then a
remarkable 143 kilobytes of data.
What a difference a decade makes. Today,
the floppies used by the Mac are encased in
hard plastic shells and are not so floppy any
more. They also hold 1.44 megabytes of data
— 10 times the original amount.
Future floppies will hold about 2.5M8
and other exotic technologies promise to
bring you up to 128MB on disks no larger
than the venerable blue Sony of today. (Yes,
they will cost more.)
All this history and prognostication,
though, does you little good if you're having
problems today. Most of those problems
result from using high-density disks where
they don't belong. High-density floppies, HI)
for short, have an extra hole that has no
switch to open or close and store the afore
mentioned 1.44M8 of data. Standard Mac
disks hold 800 K.
If your Mac doesn't have an FDHI), the
high-density floppy device also known as the
Super Drive, you have no need for HI) disks.
Using them can even be dangerous. Say you
format an HD disk in an 800K drive then
bring it to a machine with a Super Drive.
The Super Drive "sees" the extra hole,
says "Hmmm . . . this high-density disk

looks wrong" — it doesn't
know you formatted it for
800K — and puts up the
dreaded words: "This disk is
unreadable. Do you want to:
Eject/Initialize?"
Always choose eject if you
ever want to see the data on
the disk again. Initializing a
floppy permanently destroys
whatever is stored on it. A
temporary workaround is to

cover the extra hole with a piece of opaque
tape and reinsert the disk. The Super Drive
is now fooled into thinking its reading an
800K floppy and things should work out.
This method is not a good one in the long
term, though. The Super Drive uses a lower
magnetic current to write information on
the concentric tracks of the floppy disk. This
allows information to he packed more close
ly together, hence the name high density.
If a high-density disk, formatted for low
density 800K, keeps being moved between
Super Drives and standard drives the chance
for error increases greatly. By the way, if you
format a disk for high density and try to use
it in an BOOK drive, the "eject/initialize" sce
nario will unfold before your eyes once again.
The upshot of all this is that you should
use the right disks for the right drive —
always — if you want to avoid problems. All
Macs up through the Plus do not have Super-
Drives. Some have 400K drives (even older
than the 800K), which presents even more
problems. But I digress . . .

If you have an SE, it
should have a logo embla
zoned on the front that lets
you know if there is one or
more Super Drives installed.
The SE/30, llx, Ilsi, Ilci,
Hex, LC, Ilfx and Classics all
had HD drives put in at the
factory.
Dorm clusters vary in their
Super Drive capabilities so, if
you're moving your disks

around a lot, buy standard, non-HD disks.
They'll format properly on Super Drive
machines and should work on older Macs as
well.
If you know all your work will be on high
density equipped Macs, but high-density
disks and format them accordingly. (You
know they're high density if it says 1,383K
available, plus or minus a few kilobytes,
after formatting.)
The thing you should avoid is buying HD
disks and formatting them on 800K drives.
The magnetic confusion will result in a lot of
extra errors and crashed disks. And, the extra
hole will confuse Super Drives the world over.
Furthermore, the disks may not be able to
reformat as HD disks ever again because the
Macintosh thinks they're hopelessly
untrustworthy.
If this has raised more questions than it
has answered, consult Academic Informa
tion Resources or your residence computer
coordinator. One way or another, the floppy
is here to stay.
