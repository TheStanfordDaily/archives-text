## Chryste Gaines makes a run at a Championship 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Faster than a speeding bullet, more pow
erful than a locomotive, able to leap tall
buildings in a single bound. Look, up in the
sky. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Chryste
Gaines. . .
Well, maybe not. But she is very fast.
Check out her stats for this year. She has
run a 11.28-second 100 meters and a 23.21
in the 200. Both marks are school records.
The 100 time is second-best in Pacific 10
Conference history. Tomorrow she takes
her credentials into the NCAA Champi
onships at Eugene, Oregon.
"I'd like to win both of them. Realisti
cally I could finish in the top three in the
100 and maybe the top three in the 200,"
Gaines said.
Her goals don't stop there. She'll run in
the senior The Athletic Congress (TAC)
national championships this summer to
qualify for the Pan Am Games. Next sum
mer Gaines will be at the U.S. Olympic Tri
als trying to make the 4xloo squad that is
racing in Barcelona.
Until then she certainly won't be resting
on her laurels. One of the junior sprinter's
aims is to significantly lower her 200 times.
She realizes this will probably require her
to run more 400s.
"I wouldn't mind running the mile relay
if we had some quarter-milers. If I'm going
to be going out at 53 [seconds] and the sec
ond leg runs 58 then there's something
wrong with that picture," Gaines said.
She does agree that, although frustrat
ing, the relay may benefit her. "If that's
what it will take to get my times down,

then, of course, I'll do it," Gaines said.
She thinks it will also take running a lot
more 200's. "The 200 is speed, endurance
and technique. The 100 is speed Technique
plays a little part in it but you can go wild in
the 100 and win.
"But you have to keep your form and be
able to sustain the speed that you would
run in a 100 in a 200 meters. That's why
you have to train a lot harder for a 200 than
a 100," Gaines said.
She will be able to gauge how much more
training she needs this week. Gaines is
looking forward to the NCAA Champi
onships, especially after passing them up
last year in favor of an international compe
tition in Milan.
"fCoachesl Brooks [Johnson] and Scott
[Chisaml were all gung-ho about it. They
said that I could go to NCAAs anytime. I
probably wouldn't have made the national
team [if 1 hadn't gone]," Gaines said.
Although pleased with the drop in her
times this year Gaines knows she can run
much faster.
"I'm still not being trained to capacity.
But Brooks says we do the minimum
amount for college competition because of
our work load," Gaines said. The academic
and other pressures at Stanford also keep
the team from traveling to a lot of meets.
"We have a lot of home meets, and our
track is very slow," Gaines said. She knew
how demanding it was here when she com
mitted herself to the Cardinal, albeit reluc
tantly. Her father wanted her to go to Stan
ford but Gaines was set on Florida.
Eventually she agreed. "I figured my

Junior Chryste Gaines is the fastest sprinter in Stanford history, holding school records in the 100-meters, the 200 and
the 4xloo relay. However, she has yet to win a national title; she hopes to end that drought this week at the NCAAs in
Eugene, Ore.
father knew best, which I still
have my doubts," she said dryly.
Gaines believes she would be run
ning faster if she were at Florida
now, but realizes the value of a
Stanford degree.
Competing at a school which is
not in the chase for a national
team title also keeps her from
being exploited in several events
instead of just running her two
races. She views this as one of the
benefits of coming here.
That her father was able to

convince her to change her college
plans is not surprising consider
ing his role in her life. Gaines see
both her parents as role models.
"My father is a lawyer, and my
mother is a schoolteacher. They
are both strong individuals. They
taught me to work for what I
look for,
hand-outs. 1 trunk that that s
what you have to do in order to
succeed," Gaines said.
She respects other athletes
who take this approach, like Eve
lyn Ashford and Renaldo
Nehemiah. "I have a lot of respect
for them because everything
they've done they've worked hard
for. They haven't tried to take any
enhancers," Gains said. "I met

high school she had
the top marks in the
country in the 100
and 200.

[Ashford] at the [Olympic] Trials.
I think she's a great person, and I
have a lot of respect for her
because of her talents."
Talent is also something
Gaines exhibited at an early age.
She started off a track career bv
racing her sister in the neighbor
hood streets. Then she ran field

days in elementary school.
When she was 12 she tied a
meet record at a national junior
meet and got to meet legendary
Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver
Lynn Swann.
Her senior year of high school
she had the top marks in the
country in the 100 and 200 and
was named Gatorade National
Athlete of the Year.
Since then Gaines has gotten
ever so closer to her goal of mak
ing the Olympics. As she joins
teammates Jackie Edwards, Mar
cus Hickerson, Dave Strang, Deb
bie Malueg and Mark Mastalir in
Oregon she hopes to take another
step towards Barcelona with a
sterling performance at NCAAs.
