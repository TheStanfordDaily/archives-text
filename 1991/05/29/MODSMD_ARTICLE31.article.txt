## Chryste Gaines makes a run at a Championship 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Faster than a speeding bullet, more pow
erful than a locomotive, able to leap tall
buildings in a single bound. Look, up in the
sky. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Chryste
Gaines. . .
Well, maybe not. But she is very fast.
Check out her stats for this year. She has
run a 11.28-second 100 meters and a 23.21
in the 200. Both marks are school records.
The 100 time is second-best in Pacific 10
Conference history. Tomorrow she takes
her credentials into the NCAA Champi
onships at Eugene, Oregon.
"I'd like to win both of them. Realisti
cally I could finish in the top three in the
100 and maybe the top three in the 200,"
Gaines said.
Her goals don't stop there. She'll run in
the senior The Athletic Congress (TAC)
national championships this summer to
qualify for the Pan Am Games. Next sum
mer Gaines will be at the U.S. Olympic Tri
als trying to make the 4xloo squad that is
racing in Barcelona.
Until then she certainly won't be resting
on her laurels. One of the junior sprinter's
aims is to significantly lower her 200 times.
She realizes this will probably require her
to run more 400s.
"I wouldn't mind running the mile relay
if we had some quarter-milers. If I'm going
to be going out at 53 [seconds] and the sec
ond leg runs 58 then there's something
wrong with that picture," Gaines said.
She does agree that, although frustrat
ing, the relay may benefit her. "If that's
what it will take to get my times down,

then, of course, I'll do it," Gaines said.
She thinks it will also take running a lot
more 200's. "The 200 is speed, endurance
and technique. The 100 is speed Technique
plays a little part in it but you can go wild in
the 100 and win.
"But you have to keep your form and be
able to sustain the speed that you would
run in a 100 in a 200 meters. That's why
you have to train a lot harder for a 200 than
a 100," Gaines said.
She will be able to gauge how much more
training she needs this week. Gaines is
looking forward to the NCAA Champi
onships, especially after passing them up
last year in favor of an international compe
tition in Milan.
"fCoachesl Brooks [Johnson] and Scott
[Chisaml were all gung-ho about it. They
said that I could go to NCAAs anytime. I
probably wouldn't have made the national
team [if 1 hadn't gone]," Gaines said.
Although pleased with the drop in her
times this year Gaines knows she can run
much faster.
"I'm still not being trained to capacity.
But Brooks says we do the minimum
amount for college competition because of
our work load," Gaines said. The academic
and other pressures at Stanford also keep
the team from traveling to a lot of meets.
"We have a lot of home meets, and our
track is very slow," Gaines said. She knew
how demanding it was here when she com
mitted herself to the Cardinal, albeit reluc
tantly. Her father wanted her to go to Stan
ford but Gaines was set on Florida.
Eventually she agreed. "I figured my

Junior Chryste Gaines is the fastest sprinter in Stanford history, holding school records in the 100-meters, the 200 and
the 4xloo relay. However, she has yet to win a national title; she hopes to end that drought this week at the NCAAs in
Eugene, Ore.
