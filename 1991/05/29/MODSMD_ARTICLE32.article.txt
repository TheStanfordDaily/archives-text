# It's time for Air to rise to the top

There is only one thing left
for Michael Jordan. He
has every individual
honor basketball has to offer.
NBA Most Valuable Player,
Defensive Player of the Year,
league scoring champion, All
Star MVP But It has eluded
America's guard, and has tar
nished his sterling reputation
in the interim. An NBA Cham
pionship
For the first time in his
closely-followed career, the
man known around the world
for his wondrous basketball
skills has the opportunity to
achieve his ultimate athletic
dream. The Chicago Bulls are
finally in the NBA finals.

Jordan is surely one of the
greatest to grace the parquet of
American arenas. He ranks
right up there with the Wilts,
the Kareems and the Big O's.
He does everything. He takes
the ball to the hoop, shoots
from the perimeter, dunks, sets
up his teammates, shuts down
the opponent, and even consis
tently steals the ball. He pro
vides the scoring, the defense,
the leadership and the motiva
tion necessary to make a suc
cessful franchise.
Since the fall of 1984 Jordan
has won two MVP awards â€”
one in 1987 and one last
month, three All Star Game
MVP's, a Defensive Player of
the Year, a Slam Dunk Champi
onship, has been elected to
seven All Star teams, and has
been league scoring champion
for five consecutive years.
On top of his athletic talent,
Jordan is a great individual:
always courteous to fans and
opponents, communicative
with the press and generous
with his time.
But in today's America of
materialism and Number 1,
Jordan is not a complete suc
cess. His formidable talent is
not enough. In the eyes of fans
he is slightly tainted, not quite
good enough.
In 1991 you need a champi
onship ring to prove you are
the best, and Michael Jordan
does not possess the ultimate
verification.
Almost every other contem
porary sports hero is a proven
winner. Magic has five tro
phies. Joe Montana four. Even
Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain,
Reggie Jackson, Wayne Gret
zky and Terry Bradshaw won
the Big One.
Jordan fears being the next
Ernie Banks, the next Great
One whose team never brings

home the trophy.
A championship is the only
thing Jordan craves. He'd
gladly give back all of his indi
vidual awards for one team vic
tory.
After seven amazing, but
never completely successful
seasons, Winning It All has
become an obsession. When
accepting his second MVP tro
phy, Jordan basically said
"Thanks, but this isn't what I
want. It's the Championship
trophy I want to hold up on
national television."
Now Air Jordan finally
has the chance. After
seven years of spectacu
lar play, plenty of victories,
even playoff success, Jordan
has a supporting cast that can
for the first time help him take
the Bulls all the way.
For though basketball is the
most individual of team sports,
one athlete alone cannot win a
title. Unlike football or base
ball where positions are too
specialized, a basketball player
can dominate a team, lead a
team, even make a team great.
Jordan's amazing talent has
done all of the above. He has
continually taken the Bulls to
the playoffs, and last year to
the seventh game of the East
ern Conference Finals.
But even in basketball one
athlete cannot lead a squad to a
Championship. You need at
least five talented individuals
to that.
As well as cohesion, work
ethic and a bit of luck.
Basketball is ability, but it's
also all five cogs working
together at any given moment,
and playing well together when
the heat is on. Such as in game
seven, or four, or one of the
Conference Finals. It's easy to
get 11 talented players to
gether, but a little more diffi
cult to get them to add to one
another's assets, help neutral
ize one another's liabilities and
work for the best of the unit.
Every Bull other than Jor
dan has taken a lot of grief the
past six years for not winning a
trophy for Michael. Even the
man himself complained about
not being able to do it all after
the Bulls were eliminated in
previous years.
Slowly, the Bulls have been
assembling a competitive,
cohesive body around Jordan
the nucleus.
And it looks as if the king
may finally have his turn on
the throne.
With Scottie Pippen, Bill
Cartwright, Horace Grant, B.J.
Armstrong and John Paxton
giving Jordan the much needed
offensive and defensive aid, the
Bulls have had one of their best
years ever. They won their divi
sion, posted the second-best
record in the NBA and lost only
one game on the road to the


Debbie
Spander
Championships.
The squad has consistently
played good ball and is entering
the series hot, having just swept
Detroit.
Could it finally be The Year?
It's still going to be tough. It
looks like the Bulls will have to
cut down the Lakers in the finals.
After a tumultuous year during
which L.A.'s team underwent a
change of directors and didn't win
the West, the Lakers have been

playing great ball in the playoffs.
And now that Jordan has
Finally reached the spotlight, he is
going to have to share it with
Magic. And is going to have to
outperform Magic to get the cov
eted ring.
You've got to root for Jordan in
this one.
For his production and contri
butions to basketball and society
he truly deserves it, if not just to
earn the final respect of the fans.
But in sport, like life, the best
man doesn't always win.

Debbie Spander isn't exactly a
Bulls fan, but thinks it's time
Michael gets his ring.
