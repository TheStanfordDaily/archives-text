## Men cyclists kick serious back tire to give Card fourth place at nationals 
### Brian Sterling 
"Ycur legs must have been on fire!" and
"You guys must have been on drugs!" were
some of the comments from stunned confer
ence rivals after the Stanford men's team time
trial (TTT) squad blazed to a second-place fin
ish at the National Collegiate Cycling Champi
onships in Cheney, Wash., two weekends ago.
This result, along with Becky Wig
glesworth's outstanding fifth place in the
women's criterium, spearheaded Stanford's
drive to fourth place in the overall team classi
fication. The Cardinal, which had barolv qual
ified for nationals by placing fifth in the con
ference, ended up leaving the other California
teams shaking their heads in disbelief.
San Diego State, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
and conference champions California had all
soundly beaten Stanford in the conference,
and the Stanford men were not exactly
renowned for their time trialing abilities after
placing a poor seventh in the conference TTT.
But when the season's most important race
came, the men were finally ready for a good
performance and posted a time bested only by
Colorado.
The Buffaloes, the defending champs,
repeated as champions with 430 points, fol
lowed by Arizona State with 368, a surprising
UC-Davis with 271 and Stanford with 242.
California schools took five of the top eight
spots. The team scoring is decided by adding
up both men's and women's points from a
TTT, a criterium and a road race.
After a grueling 18 hours of driving, the
Stanford team recuperated by resting and rid
ing around the courses on Friday. They also
kept busy gathering their aerodynamic arsenal
for the next day's TTT assault. Each squad
would be fully tricked out with rear disk
wheels, narrow front wheels with bladed
radial spokes, clip-on time trial handlebars,
skinsuits and teardrop helmets.
The intermittent rain of Thursday and Fri
day let up in time for Saturday morning's
TTTs, lifting the spirits of the Stanford contin-

gent. The women's squad, consisting of Wig
glesworth, former national team swimmer
Julie Martin and grad students Deirdre Con
ley, Lisa Bjerknes and Nicole Calakos, sped to
sixth place, while the Colorado women turned
in the fastest time.
The men's team consisted of law student
and former national team member Frank
Scioscia, grad students Brian Sterling and Lee
Fleming — a silver medalist in the 1980
Junior World Championship TTT — and
juniors Tim Bradford and Rex Jameson. After
getting pumped listening to a Madonna tape,
they earned the silver medals by hammering
over the flat 27-kilometer out-and-back course
at an average speed of 31 mph. "Goddam that
was fast!" Bradford said afterward.
The afternoon's criteriums consisted of 40
one-kilometer laps for the women and 60 for
the men. Both races were marred by crashes in
the last corner. Wigglesworth maintained good
position as the pack dwindled throughout the
women's race. She sprinted to fifth place, over
taking conference champion Kim Applegate of
Cal at the line.
In the men's race, there were several break
away attempts, the last of which was caught
on the last lap. Bradford was the only Stanford
point-getter, placing 15th, while Jameson and
Scioscia were 27th and 30th.
The weekend finished off with road races
around a 10-mile loop of rolling terrain, with
the women doing five laps and the men eight.
In the first race, although many women got
dropped, there were still four in Cardinal and
White in contention when disaster struck with
a half-mile to go. There was a sudden massive
pile-up, taking down Wigglesworth, Bjerknes

— who got back up and finished 29th — and
Calakos, who managed to get back up and ride
across the line despite a punctured lung.
Conley was delayed by the crash and also
ended up out of the points in 28th. Former
Stanford racer Erica Deese-Dobson, now in
grad school at Texas, led out the sprint from
200 meters and held on for third place.
There were 70 women entered in the
nationals races, a field size several times larger
than the largest races of the regular season.
Wigglesworth said that "Ninety-nine percent
of us don't have experience racing in such a
large pack." That, along with the fact that the
relative ease of the courses kept the fields
together, contributed to the carnage.
After a one-and-a-half hour delay, the 140-
strong men's field rolled out for the last race.
It was fairly uneventful for Stanford until
Scioscia got in a small breakaway group with
one and a half laps to go. His move brought his
teammates to the front of the pack to slow it
and cover any counterattacks. Scioscia's group
eventually merged with a previous breakaway
to form an 11-strong group including World
University Games road race champion Paul
King of Georgia, conspicuous in his rainbow
world-champion jersey.
Scioscia finished 10th, just ahead of King.
When the field thundered up to the finish soon
after, Fleming, Sterling and Jameson negoti
ated the hairy sprint well enough to garner
points for 18th, 25th and 30th, respectively.
Stanford consistently has one of the
strongest cycling programs in the country,
attending every nationals since the first one
three years ago, placing seventh, third and
fifth prior to this year's fourth.
