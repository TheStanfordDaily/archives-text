# Athletes of the week
## 
### 
As spring comes to another seemingly pre
mature close and most of us are preoccupied
with preparing for final papers and exams,
many of Stanford's student-athletes find
themselves with the added burden of anoth
er sort of final: NCAA finals.
We at Athletes of the Week are proud to
recognize two of the most successful of these
folks for their hard work: senior Jodi Figley

of the women's golf team and sophomore
Jared Palmer of the men's tennis squad.
Figley and friends entered the NCAA
Tournament with a mission. They wanted to
redeem what had been a somewhat disap
pointing, though not exactly dreadful, season
by capturing the national title, something
that had eluded them the three previous
years.
They did not successfully complete their
mission, but Figley nevertheless could be
proud of her individual performance in the
tournament. She started out slowly, shoot
ing eight over par on the first nine holes, but
after that she rolled. She managed to pull out
a 78 on the first day, and then shot 73, 74
and 73 to finish eight strokes behind the
leader and tie for eighth place in the country.
Figley — and everyone else — knew she
had closed her career with a bang.

Palmer and friends entered the NCAA
Championships with a mission. They wanted
to redeem what had been a somewhat disap
pointing, though nor exactly dreadful, sea
son by capturing the national title, some
thing that they had accomplished the three
previous years.
They did not successfully complete their
mission, but Palmer nevertheless could be
proud of his individual performance in the
singles draw. He started out slowly, losing
his first set by a score of 5-7, but after that he
rolled. He managed to pull out a 5-7, 6-4, 7-6
(8-6) victory over Duke's Jason Rubell on the

first day, and then cruised through the
remainder of the tournament to take the
national singles crown.
He obliterated Georgia's Patricio Arnold
6-2, 6-0 in the finals on Arnold's home court.
Palmer — and everyone else — knew he
had closed his sophomore season with a
bang.
