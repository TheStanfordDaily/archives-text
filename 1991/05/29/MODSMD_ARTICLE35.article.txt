# Ricks works to end the zero-sum game

### 
If Stanford is struggling to
decide what steps it will next
take on the path to multicultur
alism, Greg Ricks may have
some answers.
"Multiculturalism means
bringing every culture to the
table. The zero-sum analysis is
our biggest threat."
That analysis, he says, means
"that to support another cul
ture is to deny your own" — and
breaking down that insecure
conception may be the key to
sparking more honest conversa
tions about multiculturalism at
Stanford.
Since being hired a year and a
half ago to be the multicultural
educator for the Office of Resi
dential Education, Ricks has
conducted more than 100 dorm
discussions on multicultural
understanding. In his career, he
has served as a consultant to
more than 90 universities
nationwide.
When he first arrived at
Stanford, he found the most
diverse campus community of
any he had seen. He also found
serious problems.
"I found the community
pretty polarized — it was a com
munity in a rage with the com-

munity. There was incredible
resistance to discussions of any
thing multicultural," Ricks said.
He went to work developing
residence programs that aim to
get students talking honestly
about ethnicity and other cul
tural differences.
One of the most popular
activities in his programs,
"Cross the Line," shows that
everyone is part of a minority
group in some sense, and that

discovering the diversity in
group distinctions can be excit
ing.
"The messages we've sent
are that the people of color are
the diverse, interesting people
and white people are boring,"
Ricks said. "Cross the Line"
aims to counteract such limiting
conceptions.
"What people are trying to do
is affirm themselves. The idea of
celebrating difference creates
fear in people. Sameness is less
threatening."
Rather than instilling a set of
beliefs in people, Ricks aims to
get them thinking critically
about the issues. And once the
critical thinking starts, he says,
students begin to realize that
multiculturalism has less to do
with political agendas than with
developing relationships that
avoid marginalizing anyone.
"Students are not against the
values of multiculturalism. The
problem at Stanford is method
ology. Students are saying, give
us opportunities to get to know
each other on our own terms.
Stop trying to prepackage every
thing. "
