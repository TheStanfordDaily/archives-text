# Misconduct case rules reviewed
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
Only five students and 11 members of the Com
mittee of 15 showed up for an open forum on pro
posed changes to the University's Legislative and
Judicial Charter last night.
The proposed amendments would protect the
rights of people filing charges, require witnesses and
those accused to cooperate in investigations, and,
most importantly, reduce the standard of proof from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to "by clear and con
vincing evidence."
As committee chair and Law School Prof. Debo
rah Rhode explained, "beyond a reasonable doubt"
means that defendants can only be convicted if there
is a 90 to 99 percent chance of their guilt, while "by
clear and convincing evidence" requires a 65 to 90
percent likelihood.
In its February report, the University's Sexual
Assault Task Force proposed the changes to make
prosecution of sexual assault offenses easier. The
Committee of 15, which can review the charter and
suggest changes, is considering the task force's rec
ommendations.
The charter, which was written in 1968, defines
the judicial process and governs how the University
develops rules on student conduct.
The committee plans to decide on the proposed
amendments by the end of this academic year. If it
recommends the changes, the ASSU Senate, the Fac
ulty Senate and University President Donald
Kennedy will have to approve them to put them in
effect.

Although the difficulty in prosecuting sexual
assault cases prompted the proposed amendments,
any changes to the charter would apply to all student
misconduct cases, said Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole.
"The vast majority [of student misconduct cases]
are not Fundamental Standard cases; they are
Honor Code cases," she said. "Therefore if there is a
change in the standard of proof, it . . . will be easier
for a student to be found guilty of misconduct."
The Fundamental Standard stipulates that stu
dents show respect for "order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others" within and without
the University, while the Honor Code is essentially
the application of the standard to academic matters.
Although some of the students present at the
forum feared a change in the standard of proof
would violate the rights of the accused, Rhode
explained that since the University does not have the
same opportunities as government agencies to
obtain evidence — such as the use of subpoena — it
rarely can prove something "beyond a reasonable
doubt."
She also noted that the committee believes the
high standard of proof deters many people from
bringing cases before the University.
"The hope is that as the Sexual Assault Task
Force recommendations are put in place more cases
will be put forward," she said.
The Committee of 15 has met five times since the
release of the Sexual Assault Task Force report to
review its recommendations, twice with members of
the task force.
