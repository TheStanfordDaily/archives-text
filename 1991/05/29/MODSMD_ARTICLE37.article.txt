A field of candles illuminated
White Plaza last night as 200 peo
ple rallied for a safer campus envi
ronment during the annual Take
Back the Night March.
Senior Katharine Mottley,
whose Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues class in
women's self-defense organized
the event, said the march serves
"to get people together to raise
issues about walking alone at
night and about sexual assault on
campus."
Junior Karin Gaisford added
that the march "can also serve as
an outlet for the anger that

women feel as they are daily
harassed by the threat of rape and
sexual assault."
Among the people who showed
up for the event were members of
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
Evan Nadler, a resident assistant
at the Phi Delt house, said he
wanted to participate in the
march not only to support the
cause but also to prove that the
Greek system is aware of the
problem.
"Basically, fraternities have
been associated with bad things
lately," he said. "We just wanted to
show the University and people
that there are so many positive
things that fraternities can do."
Gaisford said in her opening

remarks that the class organized
the march to channel the fear and
anger of victims, to raise aware
ness on campus of the situation
and to empower both men and
women by walking in certain
unsafe areas.
The march progressed from
White Plaza to Junipero Serra
Boulevard, where sexual assaults
have occurred in the past. It also
went past Memorial Church, the
Physics Tank and the libraries,
stopping at every site to read
poetry and share feelings about
sexual assault.
As they walked around cam
pus, the marchers chanted, "Fight
for the right to walk at night."
