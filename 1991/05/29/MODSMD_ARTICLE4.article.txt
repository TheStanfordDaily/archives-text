# New COP can't get office keys
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The newly elected "Stu
dents First" Council of Pres
idents officially assumed
office Monday. Or that's
what they thought.
The departing COP has
refused to turn over to the
new COP the keys to its
office, according to COP
elect members Beth Morgan
and John Overdeck.
"They are not letting us in, and I
don't know why," Overdeck said. "I
think that they are being a little spite
ful."
Overdeck said he has been unable to
contact any members of the old COP to
get a complete explanation.
But COP member Goodwin Liu said
the new COP does not assume office

until next Monday.
The ASSU Bylaws state that the new
COP takes office on the ninth Monday of
spring quarter — which was Memorial
Day, according to Overdeck.
But Liu said classes actually started
on Tuesday, April 2, giving the current
COP one more week in office.
"We are not intentionally holding the
key," Liu said. "We are just playing by
the rules."
Overdeck said the rules intend for
them to assume office now. "They
accuse us of being pedantic about the

bylaws, but they should just read them
and think about what they are doing. I
don't know why they would want to pre
vent us from starting our work," he said.
Morgan said the old COP has no rea
son to keep the office. "They are not
working on any projects, and there is
nothing on their computer hard drive,"
she explained.
Liu also said that this is "not an
issue" and that the new COP has "no
problem accessing the office." He also
said COP-elect member John Louie has
already obtained a key from a member of
the ASSU office staff.
