# Quake repairs and negotiations with government continue
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
Negotiations between the University
and the federal agency that will reim
burse it for earthquake repairs continue
to drag along as Stanford strives to
reopen buildings closed since the 1989
temblor.
Representatives of the Federal Fmer
gency Management Agency, which is

charged with providing disaster relief
around the nation, have been working
with the University since the earthquake
to determine the cost for each repair pro
ject and negotiate federal reimbursement
for it.
As an example of how slowly negotia
tions are proceeding, Gene Kershner,
assistant director of Facilities Project
Management, cited the current project to
repair Building 370, the Values, Technol

ogy, Science and Society Department
office on the Outer Quad facing the
Physics Tank.
Construction on the office is essen
tially three-quarters completed, but the
federal agency has not yet agreed to a
reimbursement plan for the $1.68 million
project, he said.
There is "still nothing absolute with
FEMA," said Kershner. "They continue
to ask for more documentation and more

clarification and until they stop . . . they
won't sit down and write a final damage
survey report," he said.
Damage survey reports are the cost
estimates for specific repair projects for
which the agency agrees to reimburse
institutions.
Kershner said he had hoped the nego
tiation process would be further along
than it currently is.
Some projects have encountered fewer

problems.
For more than a year, pedestrians and
bicyclists have been forced to take a
detour around the chain-link fences sur
rounding the two ivy-covered towers at
opposite ends of the Quad.
But the so-called "Portals Project" is
well under way and the two towers should
be re-opened to traffic starting in late
summer — in time for next fall's
Centennial Celebration, Kershner
said.
"FEMA has signed off on the
minimum necessary repairs, and
the project is going very well," he
said. Project costs are estimated
at between $850,000 and
$900,000.
As a non-profit organization,
the University is eligible for fed
eral reimbursement of up to 75
percent of the cost of earthquake
repairs, but various restrictions
limit the total amount for which
Stanford is qualified.
Total earthquake repairs are
currently estimated at $141 mil
lion, Kershner said. Many pro
jects, such as the repairs to
Memorial Church, cannot be sup
ported by the government, how
ever, and only $75 million in
repairs are eligible for federal
funds, he said.
Although the University hopes
to be reimbursed about 75 percent
of this figure, it has only received
$2.3 million in commitments from
the agency, said Robert Owens,
manager of the Controller's
Office.
Ultimately, it hopes to receive
from $50 million to $60 million
during the next five years, said
Kershner.
Repairs to both the Stanford
Museum and Green Library have
been "generally approved" by the
agency, Kershner said, although
no funds have been officially
approved for the projects. Repairs
are estimated at $20 million and
$30 million, respectively. Con
struction is scheduled to begin in
April 1992, contingent on the
availability of funding, Kershner
said.
More than $7 million has been
raised bv the University for the

museum, and the remaining $13
million is expected to come from
the federal agency, pending
approval of a damage survey
report, according to John 1 lughes,
vice president for Planning and
Management.
Only $60,000 has been raised
to date to repair the west wing of
Green Library, Hughes said.
Work on Memorial Church,
currently estimated to cost $6
million, is expected to begin in
early July, according to project
manager Olivier Pieron. The
church is scheduled to reopen in
Sept. 1992. More than $8.5 mil
lion has been raised for the pro
ject, he said. The balance will be
put into a maintenance fund. As a
religious building, the church is
not eligible to receive funding
from the agency.
Most of the work on the church

involves reinforcing the existing
structure with concrete and steel,
primarily at the center crossing
where the four arms of the church
converge.
Other work includes reopening
the balconies, which have been
closed for more than 10 years,
Pieron said. A second staircase
and fire sprinklers will be added
to bring the balconies up to cur
rent fire codes.
Although the University and
the federal agency have not yet
reached an agreement on either
Language Corner or Geology Cor
ner, Kershner said that work
should begin next February and is
scheduled to be completed by
August 1993. The costs of the two
projects are estimated at $17.4
million and $16.1 million, respec
tively.

As a non-profit organization,
the University is eligible for fed
eral reimbursement of up to 75
percent of the cost of earthquake
repairs, but various restrictions
limit the total amount for which
Stanford is qualified.
Total earthquake repairs are
currently estimated at $141 mil
lion, Kershner said. Many pro
jects, such as the repairs to
Memorial Church, cannot be sup
ported by the government, how
ever, and only $75 million in
repairs are eligible for federal
funds, he said.
Although the University hopes
to be reimbursed about 75 percent
of this figure, it has only received
$2.3 million in commitments from
the agency, said Robert Owens,
manager of the Controller's
Office.
Ultimately, it hopes to receive
from $50 million to $60 million
during the next five years, said
Kershner.
Repairs to both the Stanford
Museum and Green Library have
been "generally approved" by the
agency, Kershner said, although
no funds have been officially
approved for the projects. Repairs
are estimated at $20 million and
$30 million, respectively. Con
struction is scheduled to begin in
April 1992, contingent on the
availability of funding, Kershner
said.
More than $7 million has been
raised bv the University for the

museum, and the remaining $13
million is expected to come from
the federal agency, pending
approval of a damage survey
report, according to John 1 lughes,
vice president for Planning and
Management.
Only $60,000 has been raised
to date to repair the west wing of
Green Library, Hughes said.
Work on Memorial Church,
currently estimated to cost $6
million, is expected to begin in
early July, according to project
manager Olivier Pieron. The
church is scheduled to reopen in
Sept. 1992. More than $8.5 mil
lion has been raised for the pro
ject, he said. The balance will be
put into a maintenance fund. As a
religious building, the church is
not eligible to receive funding
from the agency.
Most of the work on the church

involves reinforcing the existing
structure with concrete and steel,
primarily at the center crossing
where the four arms of the church
converge.
Other work includes reopening
the balconies, which have been
closed for more than 10 years,
Pieron said. A second staircase
and fire sprinklers will be added
to bring the balconies up to cur
rent fire codes.
Although the University and
the federal agency have not yet
reached an agreement on either
Language Corner or Geology Cor
ner, Kershner said that work
should begin next February and is
scheduled to be completed by
August 1993. The costs of the two
projects are estimated at $17.4
million and $16.1 million, respec
tively.
