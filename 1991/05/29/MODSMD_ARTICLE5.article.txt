# Quake repairs and negotiations with government continue

Negotiations between the University
and the federal agency that will reim
burse it for earthquake repairs continue
to drag along as Stanford strives to
reopen buildings closed since the 1989
temblor.
Representatives of the Federal Fmer
gency Management Agency, which is

charged with providing disaster relief
around the nation, have been working
with the University since the earthquake
to determine the cost for each repair pro
ject and negotiate federal reimbursement
for it.
As an example of how slowly negotia
tions are proceeding, Gene Kershner,
assistant director of Facilities Project
Management, cited the current project to
repair Building 370, the Values, Technol

ogy, Science and Society Department
office on the Outer Quad facing the
Physics Tank.
Construction on the office is essen
tially three-quarters completed, but the
federal agency has not yet agreed to a
reimbursement plan for the $1.68 million
project, he said.
There is "still nothing absolute with
FEMA," said Kershner. "They continue
to ask for more documentation and more

clarification and until they stop . . . they
won't sit down and write a final damage
survey report," he said.
Damage survey reports are the cost
estimates for specific repair projects for
which the agency agrees to reimburse
institutions.
Kershner said he had hoped the nego
tiation process would be further along
than it currently is.
Some projects have encountered fewer

problems.
For more than a year, pedestrians and
bicyclists have been forced to take a
detour around the chain-link fences sur
rounding the two ivy-covered towers at
opposite ends of the Quad.
But the so-called "Portals Project" is
well under way and the two towers should
be re-opened to traffic starting in late
