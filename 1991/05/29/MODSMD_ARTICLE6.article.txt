# Visiting Indian journalist reacts to death of Gandhi
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Having worked as a journalist in India
for nearly 15 years, Nirmal Mitra got used
to assassinations. But he was still "too
shocked for words" by last Tuesday's
killing of former Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
"It's a watershed," Mitra said. "It's a
complete break with the past. For 13 years
I had reported tragic events, but they were
nothing compared with the enormity of the
problem this presents."
Mitra, 34, is a senior correspondent for
Sunday Magazine, India's equivalent of
Time or Newsweek. For the past nine
months, he has been studying economic
issues of developing countries as a Knight
Fellow at Stanford. The Knight Fellowship
Program allows American and foreign jour
nalists to take classes at Stanford for a year
and examine issues from an academic per
spective.
His fellowship will end in June, and he
said he is anxious to return home to New
Delhi shortly thereafter. As a journalist
used to covering key political issues in
India, Mitra is not accustomed to being
away from home during what may be the
greatest challenge to democracy the coun
try will face since it achieved independence
44 years ago.
"I feel quite cut off," he said. "It's quite
strange sitting here while all my friends are
in the middle of things. They're on a 24-

hour vigil."
Gandhi's assassination marks the end of
a political dynasty that began with his
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was
India's first prime minister. Nehru's
Congress Party has ruled India for 40 of its
44 years.
"If you hit the Nehru family, you are hit
ting the stability of India," Mitra said. "It's
a mischievous crime. It took a family like
that to keep India together."
Now, with the last of the adult members
of the dynasty gone, Mitra said he fears
that a window may be opening for the right
wing Hindu movement to take power â€” a
turn of events he would consider disastrous
for India.
"India has 14 languages and more than
300 dialects," Mitra said. "It has many dif
ferent cultures. The problem is trying to
unite them into a common whole. The
Congress Party tried to do that through a
process of accommodation, by giving repre
sentation to minorities."
But he said the Indian People's Party,
the main party of the Hindu movement,
will do quite the opposite. He compared the
party's appeal to the fascism of Hitler and
Mussolini and their attempts to create a
unified state at the expense of minorities.
India is 80 percent Hindu and 12 percent
Muslim, with the remaining 8 percent con
sisting of other ethnic groups. The Indian
People's Party, Mitra said, unites a coalition
