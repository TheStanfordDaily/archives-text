ME99 - Mechanical Dissection
:k=
How does a sewing machine creates stitches? How does a bike shift gears? ME99
allows students to explore answers to these and many other questions through a scries
of mechanical dissection labs. A byproduct of this experience is greater confidence
in "hands-on" skills. Lab time will be spent disassembling various artifacts.
Assignments will include formal and informal oral presentations and a final paper
concerning function and history.
Prerequisites: A keen sense of curiosity. No prior dissection experience required.
