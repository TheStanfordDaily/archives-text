# Assets of $1.3 M embroil ASSU in politics of surplus
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a two
part series on the ASSU's finances.
Tomorrow's story will focus on special
fees.

The ASSU has a big financial problem
these days, but it is one most groups
would like to have.
No matter how hard it tries, the
ASSU keeps making more money than it
can spend.
The current assets of the ASSU are
$1.3 million. More than $540,000 of
those funds cannot even be spent
because the ASSU Bylaws do not recog
nize the accounts.
Profits for next year are budgeted

conservatively at more than $130,000,
and Sunday Flicks alone stands to make
almost $40,000.
But the ASSU profits have not always
been so large. In 1983, the assets totaled
slightly less than $200,000 — less than a
sixth of the current total.
People throughout the ASSU are no w
questioning why the Stanford student
government — a non-profit organization
— continues to let its funds grow
unchecked.
The biggest problem appears to be
one of control — who is responsible for
overseeing the finances of the ASSU?
Everyone agrees that the ASSU Sen
ate is responsible for setting the finan
cial policy and that the financial man
ager's duty is to handle the day-to-d;iy
operations. But few members of the sen

ate appear to have attempted to under
stand the finances and still fewer actu
ally do.
Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck, who chaired the senate's bud
get and finance committee this year, said
that when he first began to examine the
finances he often had to "brush three
inches of dust off of things."
Despite a general lack of interest
within the senate, most people within
the ASSU agree that changes have to be
made, and the big question now is what
has to be done.
Thf money keeps growing
The ASSU assets are in two basic
areas — the reserves from the business
projects and the excess operating funds.
The current reserves from the busi

ness projects total slightly more than
$540,000. Of that, Flicks has $256,000
— enough to operate for four years with
out charging students.
Unfortunately, the ASSU is unable to
spend any of the money unless a busi
ness project loses money because the
accounts were not explicitly created by
the bylaws.
The accounts have apparently existed
for about 20 years, predating the bylaws
by approximately 10 years. The senate
generally cannot spend money from any
account not listed in the bylaws.
Excess operating revenues make up
the remainder of the $1.3 million of
assets. Most of that money is "now in
investments such as stocks, government
bonds and money market accounts,
according to financial manager Mike

Risch.
"The funds are not cash," Risch
explained. "We can't spend them. The
numbers just represent where the
money is and show the financial stand
ing of the ASSU.
"It is not expendable income until it is
liquidated," he added.
The ASSU investments have gener
ally been left to grow on their own since
the early 1980s, Risch said. The funds
have increased due to the tremendous
rise in the stock market and wise deci
sions by past financial managers, he
added.
While few people question the man
agement of the investments, several sen
ators have criticized the large profits
