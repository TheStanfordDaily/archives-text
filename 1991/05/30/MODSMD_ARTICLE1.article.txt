# Assets of $1.3 M embroil ASSU in politics of surplus
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a two
part series on the ASSU's finances.
Tomorrow's story will focus on special
fees.

The ASSU has a big financial problem
these days, but it is one most groups
would like to have.
No matter how hard it tries, the
ASSU keeps making more money than it
can spend.
The current assets of the ASSU are
$1.3 million. More than $540,000 of
those funds cannot even be spent
because the ASSU Bylaws do not recog
nize the accounts.
Profits for next year are budgeted

conservatively at more than $130,000,
and Sunday Flicks alone stands to make
almost $40,000.
But the ASSU profits have not always
been so large. In 1983, the assets totaled
slightly less than $200,000 — less than a
sixth of the current total.
People throughout the ASSU are no w
questioning why the Stanford student
government — a non-profit organization
— continues to let its funds grow
unchecked.
The biggest problem appears to be
one of control — who is responsible for
overseeing the finances of the ASSU?
Everyone agrees that the ASSU Sen
ate is responsible for setting the finan
cial policy and that the financial man
ager's duty is to handle the day-to-d;iy
operations. But few members of the sen

ate appear to have attempted to under
stand the finances and still fewer actu
ally do.
Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck, who chaired the senate's bud
get and finance committee this year, said
that when he first began to examine the
finances he often had to "brush three
inches of dust off of things."
Despite a general lack of interest
within the senate, most people within
the ASSU agree that changes have to be
made, and the big question now is what
has to be done.
Thf money keeps growing
The ASSU assets are in two basic
areas — the reserves from the business
projects and the excess operating funds.
The current reserves from the busi

ness projects total slightly more than
$540,000. Of that, Flicks has $256,000
— enough to operate for four years with
out charging students.
Unfortunately, the ASSU is unable to
spend any of the money unless a busi
ness project loses money because the
accounts were not explicitly created by
the bylaws.
The accounts have apparently existed
for about 20 years, predating the bylaws
by approximately 10 years. The senate
generally cannot spend money from any
account not listed in the bylaws.
Excess operating revenues make up
the remainder of the $1.3 million of
assets. Most of that money is "now in
investments such as stocks, government
bonds and money market accounts,
according to financial manager Mike

Risch.
"The funds are not cash," Risch
explained. "We can't spend them. The
numbers just represent where the
money is and show the financial stand
ing of the ASSU.
"It is not expendable income until it is
liquidated," he added.
The ASSU investments have gener
ally been left to grow on their own since
the early 1980s, Risch said. The funds
have increased due to the tremendous
rise in the stock market and wise deci
sions by past financial managers, he
added.
While few people question the man
agement of the investments, several sen
ators have criticized the large profits
and business project reserves.
Bonuses based on profits
The salaries of business project
managers depend to a large extent
on the profits of their project.
Most managers receive bonuses
ranging from $700 to $3,000. For
instance, the Lecture Notes man
ager makes 6 percent of the first
$4,000 in profit and 10 percent of
everything over that.
But some ASSU officers have
criticized the bonus system, argu
ing that it forces students to pay
high prices for student services.
"The bonus system is a little
corrupt," Overdeck said. "The
project managers should be
encouraged to make services work
as well as possible but should not
have free rein over rates. ... It is
not a profit maximization ser
vice."
Graduate senator Larry
Augustin added that the service
aspect of the business projects has
been lost. "They are now huge
profit-making enterprises," he
said.
But Risch defended the bonus
system as encouraging efficiency
and making managers account
able.
"If a manager makes a mistake,
his salary will suffer for it," Risch
said.
Neither Augustin nor
Overdeck suggested better meth
ods to encourage efficiency within
an office but said something
should be changed.
Risch also said profits generally
have not increased because of
increasing prices — Flicks passes
and lecture notes have cost about
the same amount for the last sev
eral years. Profits have risen in

recent years because waste has
been eliminated from the budgets,
he added.
Too much money
"The ASSU has way too much
money. The senate was not
intended as an organization that
has control over a vast amount of
money. There are no checks on it,"
Augustin said.
In fact, most people within the
ASSU agree that the assets have
grown too large.
"We should have enough oper
ating reserves to ensure the finan
cial health of the organization,
but I believe that we are going
beyond that," said graduate sena
tor Doug Bone. "The ASSU has
become, in fact, a profit-making
enterprise."
Former elections commissioner
Raul Lopez argued that the assets
of a non-profit organization
should not be growing so large.
"A non-profit organization
should not make money," Lopez
said. "This student organization
is not channeling all of its
resources to the students.
"If the ASSU was a Fortune
500 company in Silicon Valley,
everything would be great. But
the ASSU is not supposed to make
money," Lopez added.
The bylaws require the ASSU
to maintain its reserves at certain
levels. For instance, the opera
tions reserves should be at 150
percent of current expenses.
According to this formula,
reserves should be about
$500,000; they currently total
almost $770,000.
"The ASSU reserves were dan
gerously low eight years ago, '
Risch said. "We now have the
reserves required for the organi
zation. We should set the level (at
which) we want our investments
and determine what to do with the
rest of the money."

Because the reserves have
grown so large, consideration is
now being given to formalizing
what in the past has been the
"ASSU endowment."
Risch said the reserves are not
really an endowment because the
ASSU does not operate off of the
investment income. Instead, the
income simply gets reinvested and
the money functions more like a
"large reserve fund."
"It is better to call it an endow
ment than net worth because we
are a non-profit organization,"
Risch said.
In the future, the endowment
income might be used to cover the
loss of some University funding of
the ASSU, which was cut again
this year by about 10 percent, he
said.
The University funds many
administrative and equipment
costs of the ASSU and will give
the ASSU almost $160,000 next
year. In return, the ASSU is
required to perform certain ser
vices for students, such as han
dling the banking services of every
campus voluntary student organi
zation.
The senate's lack of oversight
"The general operation of the
ASSU finances is not sufficiently
understood, controlled or man
aged by the senate," Bone said.
The senate is responsible for
setting the long-term philosophies
of the finances, but Bone and
Overdeck said the senate has
never passed a financial-policy
change during their years in the
ASSU.
"The senate should take
responsibility," Overdeck said.
"The senate needs to expand on
its current policy to allow for
things that we already have, such
as project reserve accounts that
are not mentioned in the bylaws."
Other senators also say the

body has neglected its duty. "The
senate is not following the
finances closely," Augustin said.
"It hasn't been watching over (the
finances) the last few y.ears and it
has gotten out of hand."
Because the senate has never
altered the general philosophies of
managing the ASSU finances, the
financial managers have "simply
run things as they were run
before," Risch said. "There is no
malicious intent."
But Bone claims the potential
for problems exists and could
increase as the reserves.
"Unless appropriate reforms
are made, it is very possible that
the ASSU has the potential to
relapse into operation without
oversight," Bone said.
Augustin said the huge
reserves allow the seriate to spend
large amounts of money without
risking its financial stability.
"When the senate's reserves
were $200,000, it did not have a
whole lot of power," Augustin
said. "Now the senate? could easily
spend $1 million and it would not
put the association in serious
financial jeopardy."
Future financial changes
Risch said three significant
changes will likely occur in the
financial policies of the ASSU
over the next year:
• A revised investment policy.
The ASSU will soon be re-evaluat
ing its philosophy on types of
investments. For example, the
ASSU will determine how much
money should be in certain types
of funds, such as high risk/high
yield vs. more secure,'lower yield
funds.
• A new expendable-income
policy. The senate must decide
what money it is allowed to spend.
This will be especially important
in determining the future makeup
of the endowment fund.

• A more comprehensive
reserve policy. The senate will
decide what level of reserves the
various areas of the budget
such as operating expenses —
should have. The senate will also
have to establish a reserve level
for the $540,000 project reserves
that are not mentioned in the
bylaws.
"I do not think that any of this
will require very difficult negotia

tions because it is not a partisan
issue," Risch said. "Anything that
makes sense and is fiscally
responsible will be acceptable."
Several senators want to see
the ASSU funds put to better use
for the students.
"We should invest in viable
businesses on this campus,"
Overdeck said. "We should not
necessarily be investing in things
that the students aren't using."
