PINE CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Inmates freed three
guards yesterday and agreed to go back to their cells
more than 24 hours after they took over the maxi
mum-security prison for the state's toughest con
victs.
The standoff at the Southport Correctional Facil
ity ended after television reporters interviewed two
inmates and a tape of the interview was played for
the rest of the rebellious inmates, said State Correc
tions Commissioner Thomas Coughlin.
"Once we played their audio tape back, the
inmates freed the hostages and moved back into the
cellblock in an orderly manner," Coughlin said.
"The biggest concern the inmates had was to tell
their story to the outside world," he said.
Inmates complained in the interview that the
guards were abusive, that there wasn't enough
supervision of guards during the recreational period
to prevent abuse, meals were often late and they
were given only five minutes to shower and shave
each morning.
Coughlin said the three released guards walked
out of the prison's yard separately on their own
power, but one had a leg injury and was placed on a
stretcher. All three were taken to hospitals.
Guards said the hostages had been stripped,
chained about the neck and paraded around. Later,
the inmates dressed the hostages in prison greens,
made up beds for them and requested sandwiches
for them, said James Flateau, state corrections
spokesperson.
Early yesterday, prison officials had cut off food,
but not water, to the inmates in an effort to force an
end to the standoff.
In Albany, Gov. Mario Cuomo, congratulated
Coughlin and said there would be an inquiry.
"For now, we can all be satisfied that the con
frontation has been defused without loss of life."
