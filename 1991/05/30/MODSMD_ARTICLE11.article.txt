ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -
Thousands of people marched through
the capital yesterday to demonstrate
against a U.S.-brokered agreement
that gave a major rebel movement
temporary command of the govern
ment.
The rebels fired shots into the air
but could not effectively disperse the
crowds, which stoned the U.S.
Embassy gates and attacked foreigners
during protests that erupted in at least
five parts of the city of 3 million.
One young protester was killed.
Two American journalists suffered
minor injuries when attacked, and two
U.N. officials were roughed up, accord

ing to a diplomat.
The unrest erupted a day after the
country's main rebel movement occu
pied the capital with little resistance at
the behest of U.S. mediators working
to ensure a peaceful transfer of power
at the end of decades of civil war.
Faced with a collapsing army, Presi
dent Mengistu Haile Mariam last week
ended 17 years of brutal Marxist rule
by fleeing the country, setting the
stage for the final rebel push into the
capital.
The Ethiopian Red Cross has esti
mated that about 200 people have died
in unrest in recent days, but there
have been no exact figures.

US. officials, who mediated two
days of talks in London between a
caretaker government and the Tigrean
rebels, sanctioned the occupation and
a rebel administration until a broad
based transitional government could
be formed.
U.S. mediator Herman Cohen, an
assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, also endorsed a referendum for
the secession of the independence
seeking province of Eritrea — a move
that angered the nationalist Ethiopi
ans.
"It's the way it was done that has
got people upset," said one resident of
the capital, who spoke on condition of

anonymity. "They basically think the
script was written before the meet
ing."
Another who witnessed the protests
added: "There has been a lot of talk
that it was a sell-out by the United
States. And that the government dele
gation was shunted aside."
The government delegation to the
talks, in order to protest the rebels'
entering Addis Ababa, boycotted the
negotiations on the last day, Tuesday.
Its absence was dismissed by Amer
ican officials as insignificant, but the
Ethiopian people have long been
known as a conservative people allied
to a strong central government.
