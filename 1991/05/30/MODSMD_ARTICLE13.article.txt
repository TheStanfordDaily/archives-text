## The 						chilly truth 
### 
University didn't use
much foresight in
closing Santiago site

The temporary closing
of Stanford's overseas pro
gram in Santiago, Chile,
while University administrators
decide whether to continue the
program in the long term, raises a
hard-to-answer question:
Why does it take a year to evalu
ate a program it only takes a quar
ter to attend?
University officials have decided
to close the program for the next
school year while a panel of faculty,
students, and Overseas Studies
and Latin American Studies
administrators evaluate the pro
gram's success.
Which brings to mind another
question raised by the Santiago
closing:
Why do University administra
tors have to shut the program
down in order to evaluate it?
It seems reasonable that the
University could have evaluated
the program while students were
actually there or continue running
the program during the evaluation
period.
While the Satiago campus isn't
currently funded by the Univer
sity, the University should be
looking for a way to supplement
the private donations that keep
the campus running. It's true that
overseas studies programs aren't
immune to the hard times
brought about by the budget
deficits the University is facing.
But, there are a number of fac
tors that make Stanford's Santiago
program special.
It is the University's only pro
gram in a Third World country,
enabling students to study first

hand issues of poverty and eco
nomic development.
It is also Stanford's only over
seas program in Latin America.
Corbin Smith, deputy director
of Overseas Studies, feels opti
mistic that the program will be
retained.
It's an optimism many students
don't share.
If the program is closed, Santi
ago would be the second overseas
campus eliminated in a year; the
University decided last fall to cut
the program in Tours, France.
It seems clear that, despite
incredibly strong student interest
in studying overseas, Stanford's
overseas programs are getting
weaker.
That's a shame, especially since
Stanford's traditionally impressive
Overseas Studies program has
been a lure for prospective fresh
men in recent years.
When the University closed the
Tours campus, officials suggested
that the money saved would be
used to strengthen its other Over
seas Studies programs.
That money should be used to
support the Santiago program.
To make matters worse, the
University was not very forward
about the likelihood that the pro
gram would be closed.
The decision to close the Santi
ago site took many students by
surprise. That's unfair, since stu
dents generally have to plan for
their overseas year well in advance.
While the "extras" like Overseas
Studies programs seem like logical
candidates for budget streamlin
ing, it's important to remember
that many graduates look back on
quarters spent abroad as the most
rewarding and most educational
time they spent in college.
The program in Santiago, if can
celed, would be a significant loss
for the University.
