Theta Delts plan to return to their house in a few years

WE THINK THAT IT IS TIME
to set things straight. The Theta
Delta Chi fraternity is not "giv
ing up" its house. We have approached
the administration with a proposition,
they have reacted with great support,
and we are now close to drawing up an
agreement.
What it amounts to is this: The Theta
Delts have decided that we need a fresh
start, a resurrection of the ritual and
tradition that have been with our house
since its inception in 1903. As part of
this revitalization of our fraternity, our
national organization will be coming to
Stanford next year to provide guidance
and support.
Because we realize that this "rebirth"

will require a lot of time and commit
ment, we have decided that it would be
better if we didn't also have to deal with
all the logistics of running a house.
Therefore, we have made an agreement
with the University whereby they will
run our house during an interim period.
At any time during this period, if we
decide that we are ready to reassume the
responsibilities of a housed fraternity, we
simply have to demonstrate our pre
paredness, and the Theta Delts will once
again occupy 675 Lomita. At the end of
this interim period, if we decide that we
wish to relinquish our rights to our
house, then and only then will we "give
up" our house.
As far as the Interfraternity Council

and their proposals for a "Greek lodge"
go, we are astonished that instead of
being supportive of our plans to revital
ize our chapter, they have decided that
our house is suddenly theirs for the tak
ing. We would like to point out to the
IFC that it was the Theta Delts who
raised half the money to originally con
struct 675 Lomita.
If five years from now we decide to
give our house permanently to the
University, and the IFC still wants their
lodge, then more power to them. But for
the next five years it would be more con
structive for them to start looking else
where.
We would like to point out that they
neither bothered to ask us what was

going on nor inquired about what we
thought of their plans for our house.
Perhaps a little more effort toward com
munication on the part of both sides is in
order.
As a final note, we thought it was
interesting that when we called The
Daily to discuss their questionable
reporting about this situation, we were
patronizingly told that "admonishing
The Daily to 'get a clue' will simply not
make a difference in the long run."
Sadly, this is probably the truth.
