# Stanford's treatment of employees' pension plan is unfair, unjust
## 
### 
Stanford is a great academic institu
tion and an innovator of educational
ideas and concepts. When it comes to its
treatment of employees, however, Stan
ford is a throwback to the 19305.
Currently there is a two-tiered pen
sion system at Stanford. Those at the top
— faculty and exempt personnel — are
privileged to have control over their pen
sion plans, which are based on Stanford's
contribution of 5 percent of their income,

less administrative costs, plus matching
contributions that the University makes
on top of that.
Those on the bottom — the staff who
perform the University's services — have
a plan with a significantly lower rate of
funding and no matching contributions
from Stanford.
The pension plan for those staff is
administered by one person chosen by
the Board of Trustees. In the past, Stan
ford has strongly resisted all attempts to
have employees jointly administer the
plan.
The plan, according to most recent tax
documents, is overfunded by approxi
mately $23 million. At any time, the plan
could be terminated, and the $23 million
surplus would be added to Stanford's
treasury, instead of increasing the bene
fits paid out to retired and retiring
employees.
As we enter contract negotiations with
Stanford this summer, let's look for
reforms that are long overdue.
