## The 						girl I might have been 
### 
I WALKED AROUND STANFORD
today in my shiny denim overalls, my
hooded yellow sweatshirt and my
white tennis shoes. I felt much like I was
some 14-year-old East Palo Alto kid who
had accidentally wandered onto campus. I
contemplated borrowing my friend
Celina's black "Los Angeles Raiders" cap
to complete the image.
Part of me has always wanted to be a
street-smart, sassy, rebellious ethnic
youth. Instead, I've become an average
college student, and I usually wear big
Stanford sweatshirts like everybody else.
After Stanford, it is unlikely that I will
ever get the chance to be the inner-citv
guerrilla I've always wanted to be.
When I was going to school in the
inner city with hard-core ethnic rebels, I
was the quiet, proper, "smart," Mexican
girl. The only time I wore overalls was in
kindergarten, when I was strapped into
my blue denim overalls, had my hair
neatly combed back and was walked to
school by my mother.
In a few weeks I will have to find my
own way through the crowded streets of
downtown Los Angeles to the ninth floor
of some obscure building where I will
start my new job. When it comes down to
the bottom line, I am not quite the rebel
I've always wanted to be.
Writing a column for me has been an
attempt to deal with this search for iden
tity. Since I am one of those "underprivi
leged" types, my columns have usually
focused on the "oppressed minority" part
of my experience.
I focus on Chicano issues because, as is
apparent from my columns, my culture,

race and ethnicity are important to me. I
also focus on these issues because, despite
all the talk about "multiculturalism" at
Stanford, people really don't know that
much about Chicanos.
My aim has always been to make the
reader understand where I am coming
from — literally and figuratively.
It is surprising how little Americans
know about Latinos, both those with
whom they share the Western hemi
sphere and those that live in the United
States (and have lived here for centuries).
President Bush, for example, calls his
Mexican grandchildren, "the little brown
ones."
Many, even at Stanford, still have trou
ble figuring out the difference between
Chicanos, Latinos and Hispanics. Most
people still use the terms interchange
ably, without realizing, or caring about,
the political and cultural implications of
those words.
My column has been an attempt to
shed some light on my community and
my culture, as well as to give a forum to
my own political perspective.
People of color like myself shouldn't
have to educate the Stanford community
about Chicanos. But until people learn
about us through more appropriate
means — perhaps, someday, as part of
basic instruction on American society —
the Stanford community will have to
learn about Chicanos and other people of
color through people like me and columns
like this one.
Hopefully, I touched on topics broad
enough that a lot of people could relate to
what I was saying and maybe even under

stand — if not agree.
I tried hard to make my columns rele
vant to the general Stanford community,
but hopefully, the important part of my
message was not lost: The difference
between those of us (Chicanos) at Stan
ford and those outside the University are
really quite imaginary. Because we are
such a minority at Stanford, the few of us
that are here have a greater responsibility
thrust upon us, and because of that, I
ended up writing a lot about Chicanos.
Of course, the identity conflict still
persists: Like many people of color, I
worry about who I am now, who I used to
be and who I want to be someday. That is
why, as I walked around in my blue over
alls this afternoon, thinking I must look
like a rebel, I realized that I actually felt
like the 4-year-old walking to grammar
school.
I wasn't pretending to be something I
never was. I was playing the role of some
thing that I very easily could have been —
and which, in some ways, a part of me will
always be . . . even at Stanford.

Delia Ibarra hopes that she's ruffled a
few feathers and raised a few eyebrows
with her column, but is still glad that it
ended with a whimper rather than a
bang.
