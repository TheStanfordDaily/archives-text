## Graham wins at French-again Star junior moves into third round 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Junior Debbie
Graham is still alive and kicking
at the French Open.
The Stanford star moved into
the third round at Roland Garros
yesterday by defeating Sybile
Niox-Chateau, 6-4, 6-0.
Former Stanford stars were
successful elsewhere as well. Tami
Whitlinger, who left school two
years ago at the end of her sopho
more season, was a second-round
winner. She defeated Kathy
Rinaldi, of Amelia Island, Fla., 6-
4, 6-0.
Patty Fendick and Elise Bur
gin, two of the Cardinal's all-time
greats, were victorious in doubles,
downing Joanne Faull and
Michelle Jaggard of Australia, 6-4,
6-4.
On the men's side, Patrick
McEnroe, who led Stanford in the
late 1980s, was a 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, 6-
4 winner over Aussie Jason
Stoltenberg. His next opponent is
1990 French Open finalist Andre
Agassi.
Naturally, there were countless
non-Stanford stories of note at the
French as well.
Jimmy Connors defied age and
exhaustion to keep alive his
impossible dream, while Boris
Becker overcame a thigh injury
and a two-set deficit to advance
his quest for the world's top rank
ing.
The 38-year-old Connors
shrugged off a mid-match collapse
to defeat Ronald Agenor, a dozen
years younger and nearly 300
places higher-ranked than the
American. Connors, a wild-card
entry in the only Grand Slam
tournament he has not won, cele
brated his 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 0-6, 6-4
victory by tossing his racket sky
ward as the center-court crowd
cheered.
"I don't throw my racket in the
air for just anybody," he said. "I
was in the trenches. I felt once it
got into the fifth and it was a mat
ter of who was going to get down
and dig and grind and do whatever
it would take to win the match.
I'm pretty happy in that position."
Connors' dramatic victory
overshadowed an improbable
comeback by Becker, who also has
won every Grand Slam event
except the French. A victory could
boost him back to the No. 1 rank
ing.
Becker, his mobility limited and
his game in disarray, lost the first
two sets to Australian Todd Wood
bridge and was trailing 3-1 in the
third when he rallied by winning
four straight games.
Then it became a question of
which would last longer —
Becker's leg or Woodbridge's
nerve. The Australian cracked
first, allowing Becker to escape
with a 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 vic
tory.

The German, who has an
uncanny ability to lift his level of
play when threatened, still had to
recover from an early service
break in the fourth and fifth sets
in the four-hour, 25-minute
match.
"He's a champion. Those play
ers have the ability to do that,"
Woodbridge said. "He kept coming
at me, being aggressive. I didn't
expect him to give up."
Becker, who said he did not
want to talk about his injury
because that could help future
opponents, said he's not really
sure how he managed to win.

"I don't know what happened
at all," he said. "It didn't look too
good. And all of a sudden, I think
he got more nervous, he sensed he
had the chance to beat me."
Another German seeking to
regain a No. 1 ranking, two-time
women's champion Steffi Graf,
had a much easier time. The sec
ond-seeded Graf overpowered
Petra Langrova 6-0, 6-1 in 46 min
utes.
Agassi, the men's fourth seed,
rolled to a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory
over Petr Korda but 10th seed
Michael Chang, the 1989 cham

pion, needed five sets to defeat
Lars Jonsson.
Chang, who plays Connors in
the next round, now has won his
last eight five-set matches.
The elimination of Bruguera
and Sanchez cleared the path for
Agassi, who is the only remaining
seed in his quarter of the draw.
Among the winning women's
seeds were No. 4 Mary Joe Fer
nandez and No. 5 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario. Among the losers
were No. 9 Manuela Maleeva-
Fragniere and No. 15 Natalia
Zvereva.

1990 French Open finalist Andre
Agassi.
Naturally, there were countless
non-Stanford stories of note at the
French as well.
Jimmy Connors defied age and
exhaustion to keep alive his
impossible dream, while Boris
Becker overcame a thigh injury
and a two-set deficit to advance
his quest for the world's top rank
ing.
The 38-year-old Connors
shrugged off a mid-match collapse
to defeat Ronald Agenor, a dozen
years younger and nearly 300
places higher-ranked than the
American. Connors, a wild-card
entry in the only Grand Slam
tournament he has not won, cele
brated his 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 0-6, 6-4
victory by tossing his racket sky
ward as the center-court crowd
cheered.
"I don't throw my racket in the
air for just anybody," he said. "I
was in the trenches. I felt once it
got into the fifth and it was a mat
ter of who was going to get down
and dig and grind and do whatever
it would take to win the match.
I'm pretty happy in that position."
Connors' dramatic victory
overshadowed an improbable
comeback by Becker, who also has
won every Grand Slam event
except the French. A victory could
boost him back to the No. 1 rank
ing.
Becker, his mobility limited and
his game in disarray, lost the first
two sets to Australian Todd Wood
bridge and was trailing 3-1 in the
third when he rallied by winning
four straight games.
Then it became a question of
which would last longer —
Becker's leg or Woodbridge's
nerve. The Australian cracked
first, allowing Becker to escape
with a 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 vic
tory.

The German, who has an
uncanny ability to lift his level of
play when threatened, still had to
recover from an early service
break in the fourth and fifth sets
in the four-hour, 25-minute
match.
"He's a champion. Those play
ers have the ability to do that,"
Woodbridge said. "He kept coming
at me, being aggressive. I didn't
expect him to give up."
Becker, who said he did not
want to talk about his injury
because that could help future
opponents, said he's not really
sure how he managed to win.

"I don't know what happened
at all," he said. "It didn't look too
good. And all of a sudden, I think
he got more nervous, he sensed he
had the chance to beat me."
Another German seeking to
regain a No. 1 ranking, two-time
women's champion Steffi Graf,
had a much easier time. The sec
ond-seeded Graf overpowered
Petra Langrova 6-0, 6-1 in 46 min
utes.
Agassi, the men's fourth seed,
rolled to a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory
over Petr Korda but 10th seed
Michael Chang, the 1989 cham

pion, needed five sets to defeat
Lars Jonsson.
Chang, who plays Connors in
the next round, now has won his
last eight five-set matches.
The elimination of Bruguera
and Sanchez cleared the path for
Agassi, who is the only remaining
seed in his quarter of the draw.
Among the winning women's
seeds were No. 4 Mary Joe Fer
nandez and No. 5 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario. Among the losers
were No. 9 Manuela Maleeva-
Fragniere and No. 15 Natalia
Zvereva.
