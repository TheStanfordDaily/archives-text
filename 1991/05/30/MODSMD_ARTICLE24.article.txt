Each week — OK, almost each
week — The Daily honors a man
and woman whose athletic
achievements stand out and
deserve attention. For the past
two years, we here in the sports
department have taken the end of

letes as our Athletes of the Year.
The awards will be presented in
our Dead Week issue next

Wednesday. The following list of
