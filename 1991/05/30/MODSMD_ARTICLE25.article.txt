# Dream, dear daughter

Awhile back, just after the
incredible Big Game Play
11, columnist Cameron
Macky wrote about the far-off
day when he would tell his two
children about the wondrous
events of that game. His kids
would be aptly named Jason
(after Jason Palumbis) and
Glynelda (after Glyn Milburn).
In the same spirit, altbeit
less tongue-in-cheek, I would
like to make my final column
an open letter to my 9-month
old daughter, Kayla Marie.
Born on August 9, 1990, she
has made my senior year jour
ney with me, and I would like
to share with her my thoughts
as I graduate.
Dear Kayla,
You're too young to under
stand this letter now, but I
hope that someday you will.
We've been through quite a lot
this year, you and I.
One of my earliest memories
of being with you, other than
the hospital, was when you
were just a few days old. You lay
on the couch and we watched
the Dodgers game on TV I for
get who they were playing, but I
remember they won. I thought
at the time that it was you who
had brought them good luck.
That was just the start, of
course. I know that you and I
will watch, and attend, many
more games of all kinds
together. And I can hardly wait
for the times when I will be
watching you compete on vari
ous playing fields.
As few as 20 years ago, this
was often not the case. As soon
as the expectant father heard
the words, "It's a girl," his
dreams of star athleticism
would be abandoned. Girls
didn't play sports, was the atti
tude. At least, not at a signifi
cant level.
But when you came into the
world, one fist held defiantly
above your head, I had no such
thoughts. When the doctor told
me you were an even nine
pounds and a perfect 10 on the
scale that measures babies'
health, I thought your mom
and I had produced the first
woman to play in the NFL.
When we took you to Stan
ford women's basketball games
(I covered the team, mom oper
ated the shot clock, and you
watched from the stands), we
pointed out Trisha Stevens and
Val Whiting, sure you would
follow in their large footsteps.
But as the months have passed
and your growth rate has
slowed, those ideas have
seemed less and less accurate.
I guess you'll just have to be
Sonja Henning instead.
Sports were a big part of
my childhood, and con
tinue to play a large role
in my life. I hope you have the
same chance to grow and
mature through them as I did.
That is not to say that you have
to grow up to be a great athlete,
or even to play sports at all.
The important thing is you
are born into a world where
women can experience the same
opportunities in sports that men
have always enjoyed. A world
where, indeed, women are given
a fair chance in all areas of soci
ety, not just athletics.
You are born into a family

that has already reaped the
benefits of that expansion of
opportunity. I hope that some
day you will star on the soccer
field, as your Aunt Michele
does for Pomona College. Or
garner a full scholarship (oh,
how I hope for that!) for volley
ball like your Aunt Heidi has at
the University of Montana.
In fact, if you don't grow up
to do any of these things, it
may be your dad's genes that
are to blame more than any
thing else. Your mom was a
two-sport star in high school
before coming to Stanford and
stands nearly 5-foot-10; your

growth percentile for females
is identical to my male 5-8
stature. Sorry, kid.
But maybe, just maybe,
you'll grow up to play sports
well, and enjoy them. Maybe
the by-then-venerable Tara
VanDerveer will be calling our
home as I once called hers for
interviews, to recruit you for
the Stanford Cardinal. Of
course, your mom and I will be
partial to our alma mater, but
the choice will be yours.
Hut maybe you will take on
the challenge of Stanford, and
succeed. Maybe as you dazzle
with your outside shooting and
tenacious defense, you'll make
them remember another Cardi
nal Ail-American as you assault
her career records. Could you be
the next Jennifer Azzi, Kayla?
Or maybe you'll hit the win
ning shot to bring Stanford
another NCAA tennis title, as I
watched the inspirational Kylie
Johnson do two weeks ago.
Maybe things will be different,
and you'll be a fan like your dad
and mom. Like it or not, though,
you'll be rooting for Stanford.
But who knows what the
future will bring? Certainly not
your mom and I. We'll be tak
ing you to Los Angeles to live
for the next two years. Not the
best place the live, 1 know. But
L.A. does have two things
going for it. It has perpetual
sunshine, which is crucial for
developing those baseball and
tennis skills. We've got to work
on that throw of yours, Kayla.
It also has the Dodgers, the
team that I grew up living and
dying with. My dad, your
Grandpa Paul, passed on his
love of the team to me. I have
already begun to pass it on to
you. Let's catch a few games
this summer, what do you say?
All this 1 wanted to say to
you now, while I'm still young
enough to feel close to the joy
of collegiate athletics. While
you've still got that heart
breaking innocence in your
huge blue eyes.
The future is scary for me,
and even more for you. But I'll
always be your father, Kayla
Marie, and I'll always love you.
That's one thing that the years
can't fade, even if the cheers do.
