# Five Stanford athletes advance as track NCAAs open
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
On a rainy, cold day in Eugene,
Ore., all five Stanford track ath
letes who were in action survived
qualifying rounds at the NCAA
Championships.
According to assistant coach
Scott Chisam, the Cardinal con
tingent did not let the wintery
weather affect them.
"I think the coaching staff
would agree it's great to coach
smart athletes," Chisam said. "(At
the track) they have a wide open
practice field with a heater.
"(At one point) there was only
one athlete warming up by the
heater and it was Jackie
Edwards."
That is only fitting since
Edwards is one of the hottest ath
letes in the long jump field. The
former Bahamian national junior
bowling champion has been both
good and consistent in the past
couple of meets. She jumped over
21 feet in Big Meet a fortnight ago
and at Pacific 10 Conference
Championships last weekend.
Her streak continued as she
soared 21 feet, K inch in the quali
fying round. A 2.03 meter per sec
ond tailwind aided her effort. She

Malueg should feel at
home on the Universi
ty of Oregon campus.
She won the state
championship there
while in high school.

only had to finish in the top 12 of
14 to extend her season a few
more days.
George Mason's Diane Guthrie
was the only person to leap far
ther than Edwards in the qualify
ing round. Guthrie jumped 21
feet, 2'A inches.
The women's long jump final is
scheduled for Friday.
The men's long jump final will
also include a Cardinal competitor
as Marcus Hickerson qualified
with a 25-foot, leap. A
3.57 meter per second wind was at
his back. He made that leap on his
second attempt and then passed
his third and last qualifying jump.
Debbie Malueg moved on to
tomorrow's women's discus final
with a toss of 151 feet, 8 inches.
She finished sixth out of 12 com

petitors in her section and ninth
overall in the preliminaries. Her
section was so strong that all 12
throwers advanced.
Malueg should feel right at
home at Hayward field on the
University of Oregon campus.
That is the oval where the senior
from Corvallis, Ore., won the
state championship in high
school.
Her best throw this year was
171 feet, 9 inches, good for fourth
best in the Pac-10 this year. The
toss came in a last-chance meet
only a week ago.
In the running events Dave
Strang placed second in his heat of
the 800 meters with a time of
1:48.29. By making the eight-man
final he earned All-America sta
tus. The two time Pac-10 cham
pion has been especially pleased
with his kick lately and hopes it
will help him factor in the final on
Friday.
Chryste Gaines did not have to
run a 200 qualifying heat yester
day as all 15 competitors move on
to the semifinals (guess when)
Friday. Gaines will run a prelimi
nary heat in the 100 today. The
Pac-10 100-meter champion has
her best shot for a national crown
in this event.
