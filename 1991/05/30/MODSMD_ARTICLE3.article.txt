# Six vie to be admissions dean
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
When Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter announced her retirement in January, the
question on many people's lips was, "Who could ever
replace her?"
That question has still not been answered — it
won't be until Commencement, June 16 — but the
search committee is in the final stages of deciding.
The final six candidates for the position have been
announced: Donna Lawrence, James Montoya,
Daniel Brenner, Zina Jacque, Carolyn Walker and
Ann Quinley. These six, selected from an original
applicant pool of more than 60, will be making pre
sentations and conducting public interviews on cam
pus during the next week.

development for Stanford. She was the assistant
director of admissions at Georgetown University for
three years and at Hood College in Maryland for four
years. She has also worked as Stanford's acting
director of major gifts and as Georgetown's regional
director of development.
• Montoya has been director of admissions at Vas
sar College and at Occidental College in Los Angeles,
for four years each. He is currently the dean of stu
dent life at Vassar and was previously the associate
dean of students, director of residence, assistant
dean of admission and admission counselor for Chi
cano students at Occidental.
• Brenner, currently the director of the communi

cations law program at UCLA's law school, gradu
ated from Stanford Law School in 1976. He has
served as the senior adviser to the chair of the Fed
eral Communications Commission and has worked

UC-Santa Cruz. She was the dean of admissions and
financial aid at Mills College, associate director of
admissions and financial aid at the University of
Chicago and assistant director of admissions and

ences and School of Education and was also the

the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
received his doctorate in political science from Stan
ford. Quinley was director of admissions and orien
tation services at the University of Connecticut and

University of New York.
Lawrence's presentation will take place this after
noon and Montoya's will be tomorrow. Brenner's will
be held Tuesday, June 4, Jacque's on June 5,
Walker's on June 6 and Quinley's on June 7.
