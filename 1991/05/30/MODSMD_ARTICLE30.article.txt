# Former 'unofficial' member now deputy chair of senate
## Aussie attended more meetings than some senators 
### Miranda Doyle Staff writer 
After almost making it into the
ASSU Senate last year with three
write-in votes, Neil Crellin is
finally a senator — and the new
deputy senate chair.
Crellin, an Australian second
year graduate student in statis
tics, attended almost every senate
meeting this year even though he
held no official ASSU position.
His involvement with student
government began during the
1990 ASSU election when he was
looking at the election handbook
with fellow graduate student John
Overdeck, now a member of the
new Council of Presidents.
"John and I decided to vote for
each other as write-ins, and
another guy in the Statistics
Department also voted for us,"
Crellin said. After the election,
Crellin and Overdeck found them
selves tied with another student
for the last graduate senator posi
tion.
After Crellin withdrew, the sen
ate broke the tie in Overdeck's
favor with a secret ballot.
"We agreed that John would be
the senator and I would come
along as his assistant to the sen
ate meetings," Crellin said, adding
that he missed only two meetings
during the year.
"It is quite remarkable that
even though he was not a member
of the 21st senate ... he attended
most of the meetings," said for
mer senate chair Solina Kwan.
Graduate senator Doug Bone
agreed. "It showed that he is quite
interested in what [the senate]
does," he said. "He should be able
to make sure things are running
properly."
He was elected to the senate
this spring and was chosen as

deputy senate chair over senator
Travis Katz, a freshman, by a vote
of 13-3 at last week's senate meet
ing.
The deputy chair prepares the
agenda packets for senate meet
ings, acts as a liaison between dif
ferent functions of the ASSU and

in the absence of I
the senate chair j
takes over that \
position. Crellin
said he will re
ceive about $2,000
for the job.
During the
deputy chair elec
tion, several sena- 1
tors contended

that as a graduate student, Crellin
would not have time to fulfill the
job's requirements. Senate chair
Kevin Warsh spoke on Crellin's
behalf, drawing criticism for what
some senators perceived as parti
sanship.
Crellin said he wishes the sen
ate would have called him back
into the session to respond to the
comment. "My answer would
have been that as a graduate stu
dent my schedule is very flexible."
Although he is affiliated with
the Students First party, he said
the key point in his presentation
before the senate was that "the
functioning of the position is apo
litical by nature."
Also, he said he believes he has
demonstrated the ability to get
along with both sides through his
work with former People's Plat
form senator Naomi Onaga on the
financial aid office.
"I do not think this is a very
partisan senate," Crellin said.
"These are very independent
minded people who will consider
things on their own merits."
Crellin said he would like to see
some fundamental changes in the

ASSU next year. "One of the
biggest things the senate has to
address is its credibility as a body
which students think does some
thing," he said.
"If we pass a policy about some
thing the administration does, we
need to work on making sure" it
happens, he added. "A lot of reso
lutions said that the senate feels X
about Y and demands Z. . . . But
whenever the association is trying
to affect large-scale change, we
need to have people working on
implementation instead of just
passing resolutions."
Besides working in the senate,
Crellin has been involved with
Project SAVE, a group that orga
nizes dorm presentations about
AIDS. He is also on the graduate
student committee for Cowell
Student Health Center and, along
with Overdeck, co-chair of the
graduate student association in
the Statistics Department.
Crellin, 26, describes himself as
"very much a 'techie' kind of guy."
Growing up in Brisbane, Aus
tralia, he received a bachelor's
degree in mathematical statistics
from the University of Queens
land and then worked as a statisti
cal consultant for three years "to
get real-world experience" before
coming to Stanford.
He arrived at Stanford two
years ago without ever having left
Australia before.
"On the way here, I saw two in
flight movies — 'Field of Dreams'
and 'Major League.' I had never
seen a baseball game before and
the culture shock hit me immedi
ately," Crellin said.
However, "I think I have
adapted to American culture
pretty well," he said.
Crellin said he would like to
work for a research organization
after he receives his doctorate.
