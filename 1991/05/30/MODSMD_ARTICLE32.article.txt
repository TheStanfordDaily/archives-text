## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S NEW YORK WEEKLY When East Meets West East Coasters weigh the advantages of life in California 
### 
Editor's Note: For the purposes of this
article, we have taken a decidedly nar
row view of what constitutes the East
Coast. We are not defining the East
Coast as the entire Eastern seaboard,
but rather, as that fairly narrow cul
tural zone encompassing New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and parts of
Connecticut. Farther north is New Eng
land, with its argyle socks and Currier &
Ives. To the south is the South, with its
characteristic iced tea and Southern
hospitality. Clearly these are all very
different concepts.
By the way, for you West Coasters:
Chicago is not on the East Coast.
By June Cohen
Editorial staff
Geographically, the East Coast is
only 3,000 miles away from the
West Coast. That's a six-hour
plane ride, a three-day train ride or a
six-day car ride. Not far, by most peo
ple's standards.
Realistically, however, the two parts
of the country are worlds apart.
Just ask anyone from the East
Coast.

"There's just a sense of unreality
here," says Dave Adler, a junior from
Rochester, New York. "When you walk
around on the East Coast you get a
sense of things being real. Walk around
here and you start wondering."
This view is echoed by many other
East Coast students, such as sopho
more Pete Jeans. "Things just seem
more real on the East Coast," agrees
the New Jersey native. "Somehow,
when I'm here, even everything on the
evening news doesn't seem quite as
important."
Although perspectives vary drasti
cally among East Coast students, cer
tain recurring themes run through
their comments. Almost everyone
finds the West Coast to be more laid
back and less stressful than the East.
Life on the West Coast is less urgent,
they explain; the pace is slower and
everyone appears to be more relaxed
about life in general.
"There's a qualitative shift in atti
tude" on the West Coast, says Adler.
"The atmosphere is more relaxed,
more laid-back."
"The West Coast is definitely more
laid-back," seconds freshman Jason *

Cohen with characteristic East Coast
decisiveness. "It's more open-minded,
more liberal. Nothing is done to an
unhealthy extreme."
And Cohen, who is from New Jer
sey, likes it that way. He finds himself
more suited to the West Coast than his
native East, and plans to remain in the
after college. "If you like the snow
and skiing and all, then the east is for
you," Cohen says. "But personally, I
love the sunshine."

bread. And I miss thunderstorms. Crazy; wild
thunderstorms
— Amy Whitcomb

However, not everyone shares such
sunny outlooks on life in California.
Or life in general, for that matter.
"The weather here is unimagina
tive," says Alex Gregory, a junior from
Hoboken, New Jersey.
"The only good thing about Cali
fornia is that the cars don't rot," Gre
gory insists. "I'm moving back to
Hoboken as soon as possible. I'm
counting the seconds. Why? Because
it's really close to New York and I like
the smell."
But many East Coasters aren't as
sure. They find themselves torn
between the two coasts, frequently
enjoying the California weather but
missing New York food. Or appreciat
ing the friendliness of Californians
while missing the faster pace of the
East Coast.

And while some assimilate rapidly
to the "mellow" California scene, oth
ers say they still stand out as East
Coasters, either because of their
accents, their attitudes or some other
quality that others perceive as
East Coast.
"People can definitely tell I'm from
the East Coast, but I don't know how"
swears Deborah Shipman, a junior
from Brooklyn, New York. "I guess its
because I'm really forward and I can be

obnoxious — I don't know if that's an
East Coast characteristic or not. But
people seem to think it is."
Adler agrees that people from the
East Coast tend to be more direct and
forthright. So much so, that even for
eigners know about it.
"A friend of mine from China was
telling me how in his country, people
always make very strong statements,"
Adler begins, "it's just the way they
express themselves. But he said people
here are very taken aback by that and
that people here are afraid to make
strong statements.
"Then he turned to me and said,
'But you're not really like that. I think
it's because you're from New York.' "
People can usually place Gregory as

an East Coaster as well. He says he sees
a big difference between people from
the two coasts, and that he can always
recognize fellow East Coasters, because
"they're scowling back at me.
"People out here smile all the time,"
Gregory says with a disapproving
scowl. "It makes me really nervous."
"People here are more friendly, but
they're also more fake," says Jeans, try
ing to express the difference he sees
between the regions. "People are defi
nitely more honest on the East Coast
— you can find out in a shorter
amount of time what they're like."
"In New York, people are a lot more
forward, a lot more direct with you,"
says Shipman. "People are very liberal
in the Bay Area, but somehow it seems
kind of fake.
"I'm used to people being friendly
' now," Shipman continues. "But when I
first came out here I was used to peo
-1 pie stepping on your toes in the sub

way and treating you like garbage; I
just thought that was normal."
"People here are definitely less
obnoxious," agrees junior Jason Gis
che, who's from New Jersey. "But
they're also wimpy drivers. They actu
ally stop for pedestrians."
California drivers are objects of
scorn for sophomore Doug Sims as
well. "People can drive on the East
Coast," begins Sims, who's from New
Jersey. "And pedestrians know their
place. They know cars are bigger than
them; they don't try to challenge cars."
But some people think the suppos
edly real or perceived differences
between the coasts are simply a fabri
cation of our imaginations.
"I think a lot of the difference is
manufactured," says sophomore
Jeremy Moss, who's from New Hyde
Park, New York. "I think East Coasters

come here expecting it to be really dif
ferent. We have the conception that
people are going to be nicer and better
looking, but neither is particularly
true."
Whether Californians are nicer or
faker or no different than people from
the east is difficult to prove; however,
there can be no such confusion about
the Californian weather.

California's mild climate is a big
attraction for students who grew up
shoveling driveways every winter and
listening to relatives complain, "It's
not the heat, it's the humidity" every
summer. However, even the weather is
a point of conflict for East Coast stu
dents.
"If I miss anything, it's definitely
the fall," says Allison Berry, a senior
from Connecticut. "The colors are just
so incredible and we'd always make big
piles of leaves in our backyard and
jump in them."
Amy Whitcomb, a junior from

Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, misses the
fall months as well. "I do miss chang
ing seasons," says Whitcomb. "And
really good rye bread. And I miss
thunderstorms. Crazy, wild thunder
storms."
Of all the things students miss from
home, food definitely tops the list for
most East Coast students, along with
Mom and Dad. Or maybe higher.
Bagels; pizza; cheesesteaks; big, fat
New York-style egg rolls with pink
stuff in the middle. Whatever her per
sonal favorite, everyone said she
missed at least one kind of food that

she hasn't been able to find around
here.
"I miss unhealthy food," complains
Jeans. "Actually, I miss not feeling bad
about eating unhealthy food. Every
thing here is so health-oriented.
"I hate sprouts," he continues. "On
principle I will never put anything
called a sprout on my sandwich.
"And there are no delis out here,"
Jeans goes on, speaking faster and
more aggressively. "If there is a deli, it's
called a nature store. What the hell is a
nature store? You're still killing things."

And pizza, while plentiful, is yet
another source of dismay for some dis
placed East Coasters. "I really miss
New York pizza," says Gische. "There's
no decent pizza out here. Some of it is
OK, but it's all Chicago-style."
And Jeans agrees, pointing out that,
unlike the East Coast, which is replete
with tiny, cheap pizza joints, there are
very few places around here where you
can sit down and order a pizza that
isn't gourmet and expensive. "You
can't find me a single town in New
York or New Jersey that doesn't have at
least three little, cheap pizza shops

supported by someone selling some
thing illegal," says Jeans.
But for all their complaints, East
Coasters, like the pioneers before
them, are still migrating west. For
some, like Jason Cohen, it's the sun
shine that brings them west. For oth
ers, like Darryl Strawberry, it's an esti
mated $5 million a year.
But whatever their reasons, eastern
ers continue to cope with the aggrava
tions of bad pizza, friendly people and
the overabundance of sprouts in order
to live in the laid-back atmosphere of
the Golden State.

you," Cohen says. "But personally, I

7 miss changing seasons. And really good rye
bread. And I miss thunderstorms. Crazy; wild
thunderstorms
— Amy Whitcomb

However, not everyone shares such
sunny outlooks on life in California.
Or life in general, for that matter.
"The weather here is unimagina
tive," says Alex Gregory, a junior from
Hoboken, New Jersey.
"The only good thing about Cali
fornia is that the cars don't rot," Gre
gory insists. "I'm moving back to
Hoboken as soon as possible. I'm
counting the seconds. Why? Because
it's really close to New York and I like
the smell."
But many East Coasters aren't as
sure. They find themselves torn
between the two coasts, frequently
enjoying the California weather but
missing New York food. Or appreciat
ing the friendliness of Californians
while missing the faster pace of the
East Coast.

And while some assimilate rapidly
to the "mellow" California scene, oth
ers say they still stand out as East
Coasters, either because of their
accents, their attitudes or some other
quality that others perceive as
East Coast.
"People can definitely tell I'm from
the East Coast, but I don't know how"
swears Deborah Shipman, a junior
from Brooklyn, New York. "I guess its
because I'm really forward and I can be

obnoxious — I don't know if that's an
East Coast characteristic or not. But
people seem to think it is."
Adler agrees that people from the
East Coast tend to be more direct and
forthright. So much so, that even for
eigners know about it.
"A friend of mine from China was
telling me how in his country, people
always make very strong statements,"
Adler begins, "it's just the way they
express themselves. But he said people
here are very taken aback by that and
that people here are afraid to make
strong statements.
"Then he turned to me and said,
'But you're not really like that. I think
it's because you're from New York.' "
People can usually place Gregory as

an East Coaster as well. He says he sees
a big difference between people from
the two coasts, and that he can always
recognize fellow East Coasters, because
"they're scowling back at me.
"People out here smile all the time,"
Gregory says with a disapproving
scowl. "It makes me really nervous."
"People here are more friendly, but
they're also more fake," says Jeans, try
ing to express the difference he sees
between the regions. "People are defi
nitely more honest on the East Coast
— you can find out in a shorter
amount of time what they're like."
"In New York, people are a lot more
forward, a lot more direct with you,"
says Shipman. "People are very liberal
in the Bay Area, but somehow it seems
kind of fake.
"I'm used to people being friendly
' now," Shipman continues. "But when I
first came out here I was used to peo
-1 pie stepping on your toes in the sub

way and treating you like garbage; I
just thought that was normal."
"People here are definitely less
obnoxious," agrees junior Jason Gis
che, who's from New Jersey. "But
they're also wimpy drivers. They actu
ally stop for pedestrians."
California drivers are objects of
scorn for sophomore Doug Sims as
well. "People can drive on the East
Coast," begins Sims, who's from New
Jersey. "And pedestrians know their
place. They know cars are bigger than
them; they don't try to challenge cars."
But some people think the suppos
edly real or perceived differences
between the coasts are simply a fabri
cation of our imaginations.
"I think a lot of the difference is
manufactured," says sophomore
Jeremy Moss, who's from New Hyde
Park, New York. "I think East Coasters

come here expecting it to be really dif
ferent. We have the conception that
people are going to be nicer and better
looking, but neither is particularly
true."
Whether Californians are nicer or
faker or no different than people from
the east is difficult to prove; however,
there can be no such confusion about
the Californian weather.

California's mild climate is a big
attraction for students who grew up
shoveling driveways every winter and
listening to relatives complain, "It's
not the heat, it's the humidity" every
summer. However, even the weather is
a point of conflict for East Coast stu
dents.
"If I miss anything, it's definitely
the fall," says Allison Berry, a senior
from Connecticut. "The colors are just
so incredible and we'd always make big
piles of leaves in our backyard and
jump in them."
Amy Whitcomb, a junior from

Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, misses the
fall months as well. "I do miss chang
ing seasons," says Whitcomb. "And
really good rye bread. And I miss
thunderstorms. Crazy, wild thunder
storms."
Of all the things students miss from
home, food definitely tops the list for
most East Coast students, along with
Mom and Dad. Or maybe higher.
Bagels; pizza; cheesesteaks; big, fat
New York-style egg rolls with pink
stuff in the middle. Whatever her per
sonal favorite, everyone said she
missed at least one kind of food that

she hasn't been able to find around
here.
"I miss unhealthy food," complains
Jeans. "Actually, I miss not feeling bad
about eating unhealthy food. Every
thing here is so health-oriented.
"I hate sprouts," he continues. "On
principle I will never put anything
called a sprout on my sandwich.
"And there are no delis out here,"
Jeans goes on, speaking faster and
more aggressively. "If there is a deli, it's
called a nature store. What the hell is a
nature store? You're still killing things."

And pizza, while plentiful, is yet
another source of dismay for some dis
placed East Coasters. "I really miss
New York pizza," says Gische. "There's
no decent pizza out here. Some of it is
OK, but it's all Chicago-style."
And Jeans agrees, pointing out that,
unlike the East Coast, which is replete
with tiny, cheap pizza joints, there are
very few places around here where you
can sit down and order a pizza that
isn't gourmet and expensive. "You
can't find me a single town in New
York or New Jersey that doesn't have at
least three little, cheap pizza shops

supported by someone selling some
thing illegal," says Jeans.
But for all their complaints, East
Coasters, like the pioneers before
them, are still migrating west. For
some, like Jason Cohen, it's the sun
shine that brings them west. For oth
ers, like Darryl Strawberry, it's an esti
mated $5 million a year.
But whatever their reasons, eastern
ers continue to cope with the aggrava
tions of bad pizza, friendly people and
the overabundance of sprouts in order
to live in the laid-back atmosphere of
the Golden State.
Editor's Note: For the purposes of this
article, we have taken a decidedly nar
row view of what constitutes the East
Coast. We are not defining the East
Coast as the entire Eastern seaboard,
but rather, as that fairly narrow cul
tural zone encompassing New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and parts of
Connecticut. Farther north is New Eng
land, with its argyle socks and Currier &
Ives. To the south is the South, with its
characteristic iced tea and Southern
hospitality. Clearly these are all very
different concepts.
By the way, for you West Coasters:
Chicago is not on the East Coast.
By June Cohen
Editorial staff
Geographically, the East Coast is
only 3,000 miles away from the
West Coast. That's a six-hour
plane ride, a three-day train ride or a
six-day car ride. Not far, by most peo
ple's standards.
Realistically, however, the two parts
of the country are worlds apart.
Just ask anyone from the East
Coast.

"There's just a sense of unreality
here," says Dave Adler, a junior from
Rochester, New York. "When you walk
around on the East Coast you get a
sense of things being real. Walk around
here and you start wondering."
This view is echoed by many other
East Coast students, such as sopho
more Pete Jeans. "Things just seem
more real on the East Coast," agrees
the New Jersey native. "Somehow,
when I'm here, even everything on the
evening news doesn't seem quite as
important."
Although perspectives vary drasti
cally among East Coast students, cer
tain recurring themes run through
their comments. Almost everyone
finds the West Coast to be more laid
back and less stressful than the East.
Life on the West Coast is less urgent,
they explain; the pace is slower and
everyone appears to be more relaxed
about life in general.
"There's a qualitative shift in atti
tude" on the West Coast, says Adler.
"The atmosphere is more relaxed,
more laid-back."
"The West Coast is definitely more
laid-back," seconds freshman Jason *

Cohen with characteristic East Coast
decisiveness. "It's more open-minded,
more liberal. Nothing is done to an
unhealthy extreme."
And Cohen, who is from New Jer
sey, likes it that way. He finds himself
more suited to the West Coast than his
native East, and plans to remain in the
after college. "If you like the snow
and skiing and all, then the east is for
you," Cohen says. "But personally, I
love the sunshine."

they're also more fake," says Jeans, try
ing to express the difference he sees
between the regions. "People are defi
nitely more honest on the East Coast
— you can find out in a shorter
amount of time what they're like."
"In New York, people are a lot more
forward, a lot more direct with you,"
says Shipman. "People are very liberal
in the Bay Area, but somehow it seems
kind of fake.
"I'm used to people being friendly
' now," Shipman continues. "But when I
first came out here I was used to peo
-1 pie stepping on your toes in the sub

way and treating you like garbage; I
just thought that was normal."
"People here are definitely less
obnoxious," agrees junior Jason Gis
che, who's from New Jersey. "But
they're also wimpy drivers. They actu
ally stop for pedestrians."
California drivers are objects of
scorn for sophomore Doug Sims as
well. "People can drive on the East
Coast," begins Sims, who's from New
Jersey. "And pedestrians know their
place. They know cars are bigger than
them; they don't try to challenge cars."
But some people think the suppos
edly real or perceived differences
between the coasts are simply a fabri
cation of our imaginations.
"I think a lot of the difference is
manufactured," says sophomore
Jeremy Moss, who's from New Hyde
Park, New York. "I think East Coasters

come here expecting it to be really dif
ferent. We have the conception that
people are going to be nicer and better
looking, but neither is particularly
true."
Whether Californians are nicer or
faker or no different than people from
the east is difficult to prove; however,
there can be no such confusion about
the Californian weather.

California's mild climate is a big
attraction for students who grew up
shoveling driveways every winter and
listening to relatives complain, "It's
not the heat, it's the humidity" every
summer. However, even the weather is
a point of conflict for East Coast stu
dents.
"If I miss anything, it's definitely
the fall," says Allison Berry, a senior
from Connecticut. "The colors are just
so incredible and we'd always make big
piles of leaves in our backyard and
jump in them."
Amy Whitcomb, a junior from

Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, misses the
fall months as well. "I do miss chang
ing seasons," says Whitcomb. "And
really good rye bread. And I miss
thunderstorms. Crazy, wild thunder
storms."
Of all the things students miss from
home, food definitely tops the list for
most East Coast students, along with
Mom and Dad. Or maybe higher.
Bagels; pizza; cheesesteaks; big, fat
New York-style egg rolls with pink
stuff in the middle. Whatever her per
sonal favorite, everyone said she
missed at least one kind of food that

she hasn't been able to find around
here.
"I miss unhealthy food," complains
Jeans. "Actually, I miss not feeling bad
about eating unhealthy food. Every
thing here is so health-oriented.
"I hate sprouts," he continues. "On
principle I will never put anything
called a sprout on my sandwich.
"And there are no delis out here,"
Jeans goes on, speaking faster and
more aggressively. "If there is a deli, it's
called a nature store. What the hell is a
nature store? You're still killing things."

And pizza, while plentiful, is yet
another source of dismay for some dis
placed East Coasters. "I really miss
New York pizza," says Gische. "There's
no decent pizza out here. Some of it is
OK, but it's all Chicago-style."
And Jeans agrees, pointing out that,
unlike the East Coast, which is replete
with tiny, cheap pizza joints, there are
very few places around here where you
can sit down and order a pizza that
isn't gourmet and expensive. "You
can't find me a single town in New
York or New Jersey that doesn't have at
least three little, cheap pizza shops

supported by someone selling some
thing illegal," says Jeans.
But for all their complaints, East
Coasters, like the pioneers before
them, are still migrating west. For
some, like Jason Cohen, it's the sun
shine that brings them west. For oth
ers, like Darryl Strawberry, it's an esti
mated $5 million a year.
But whatever their reasons, eastern
ers continue to cope with the aggrava
tions of bad pizza, friendly people and
the overabundance of sprouts in order
to live in the laid-back atmosphere of
the Golden State.
