"Ycupr
That, for you uninitiated Californians, is "Hello, how are you?' in New
York-speak. Eloquent, don't you think? And so intellectual-sounding as
well.
But more than that, it's efficient — you get four words spoken in the
time it would normally take to say two.
That's important if you're from New York — or from most of the East
Coast (as defined in the cover story). Speed is everything. None of this
relaxed, laid-back, sit-in-the-sun stuff for us. No, sir. We're quick like bun
nies.
Besides, we don't have much sun.
But we do have bagels, sweet-and-sour sauce and knishes.
And, of course, big hair.
One thing we don't have on the East Coast, though, is Stanford's lively
arts. Opening tonight and running through Sunday, "His Manner of
Returning," a collage of Tennessee Williams' works adapted and directed
by doctoral student Judith Dolan, will be presented in the Nitery Theater.
And if you're tired of the same old texts, The Stanford Improvisers, the
Drama Department's improvisation troupe, will present an evening of
imaginative, innovative and entirely improvised theater sports in the Little
Theater tonight — for free.
Also tonight, Everyday People will wrap up the a capella performances
for the year at their annual spring concert. It will be held outside in Memo
rial Court in the Quad at 9 p.m. It'll be cool, so bring a blanket.
Peter Jaffe (see interview, page 3) will wrap up his two years as a visit
ing professor as he conducts the Stanford Symphony Orchestra in their
spring concert, which also features violinist Alan Rakov, winner of a 1989-
90 student soloist award.
And if none of this is exciting enough for you, you could always make
like Willy (above) and play pinball. (See story, page 8.)
Word to your mutha,


Try as ho would, Willy simply could not pel the hang of thai dam
pinhall machine.
