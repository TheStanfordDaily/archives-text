Anybody can conduct a symphony, right?
You don't need talent; you don't need musical
ability; all you need is a baton and a tuxedo. Once
you've got those, you just stand on a bleacher,
wave your arms around dramatically for a while, then turn
around and smile at the audience while maintaining a suffi
ciently upward turn of the nose.
Not quite.
Conducting a symphony requires a little bit more than a
nice outfit and an attitude; in fact, it requires a lot more
than a nice outfit and an attitude. And no one has more of
what it takes than Peter Jaffe, conductor of the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra and the Stanford Chamber Orchestra.
At 6 feet 6 inches tall, Jaffe appears formidable, and
when it comes to music, he is. Few match him in talent and
knowledge, just as few match him in leadership and author
ity.
Jaffe — unlike the stereotype some have of conductors
— is not pompous, self-aggrandizing or unapproachable.
His expressive dark eyes and somewhat boyish smile give
him away as a person who simply loves what he does and
loves to share it with other people, especially students.
Jaffe demonstrates that refined conducting requires both
great musical understanding and communicative skill. It is
a position of immense responsibility, both for making mag
ical moments of music happen onstage and for managing
the affairs of the ensemble behind the scenes.
Born in New York, Jaffe grew up nearby in Berkeley. He
earned his bachelor's in both mathematics and music at
Oberlin College in Ohio, and his master's and doctoral
degrees in conducting from Stanford.
During his two-year stint as a visiting professor at Stan
ford, Jaffe has experienced far more than music. He wit
nessed the Earthquake of 1989, the birth of his twin sons the
following day, Stanford budget cuts, the Gulf war and more.
But Jaffe has also made a great deal of wonderful music
here, culminating in the Music Department's production of
Mozart's opera, "Magic Flute," and the orchestra's upcom
ing tour of Eastern Europe.
As his time at Stanford draws to a close, it is clear what a
valuable contribution Jaffe has made to Stanford. Students
and faculty alike, especially musicians and music lovers, will
miss him greatly.
Almost as much as he will miss them.
Intermission: Is your family musical?
Peter Jaffe: Both of my parents are quite musically talented.
My father, a chemical engineer, was very much involved in
the folk music scene. He has one of Woody Guthrie's old
guitars, and he knew Pete Seeger personally.
There was a group of folk singers called the Weavers that
used to have my father play guitar and banjo and call square
dances for them. But when he was asked if he was interested
in joining the group he said no, because he didn't think it
would amount to much. The group actually ended up
becoming very famous, but at that time my father was pre
occupied with his chemistry.
My mother was also extremely talented — as an amateur

singer and pianist. She had a wonderful ear, but she couldn't
read music very well. She had several piano teachers who
never realized this; they would always wonder why she
would have trouble with simple pieces until she heard them.
Once she heard the piece, though, she would be able to play
it.
It was my mother who insured that my brother and I
really learned to read music, when I was 4 or 5 years old. My
brother was also talented in both math and music, but he
did the opposite of what I did. I le is now a high school math
teacher.
I: Did your parents push you toward music?
PJ: I think that my parents struck a healthy balance between
the stereotypical pushy parent and the lax parent, as far as
musical training goes.
When I was 8 or 9 and had been playing the piano for
some time, they told me that 1 really should learn to play an
orchestral instrument like the violin, viola or cello so that I
might have more opportunities to perform with other peo
ple.
So at age 9 I took up the violin. My parents asked that I
try it for six months and then decide if I wanted to continue.
I did, and I've never stopped since. The six months wasn't
too harsh a demand on their part.
I: Did you study strictly classic repertory when you were
growing up?
FJ: No. When I was in my early teens we had one of those
bands that rehearses in a garage on weekends. It was actu
ally full of very talented and proficient musicians. I had an
electric organ ... nobody has an electric organ any more.
We used to go into this small garage, and it was... we 11...
very loud. It was very good music and it was played very
well, but it was extremely loud.
Even then I was an idealist and I wanted to achieve some
sort of balance. I said, "Why don't you try playing a little
softer?" But they would say, "No man, you gotta have it
turned all the way up, its gotta feel right."
I noticed one day that the drummer was wearing
earplugs. I said "This is ridiculous, why don't we just turn it
down?" But they said "Why don't you just turn your ampli
fier up?" So I bought a pair of earplugs too, and we would
go through this ridiculous ritual every Saturday, going into
the garage, plugging in our amplifiers, turning them up all
the way, putting in our earplugs and playing. After a while I
couldn't stand it anymore.
There has always been a soft spot in my heart for rock
and roll and other forms of music like jazz and folk. My
musical taste is by no means limited to "art" music or classic
repertory. But I admit, I haven't kept up with the pop scene.
For me, everything died when disco came along. I went out
with the Doors and Cream and those groups of the '605...
I: What made you decide to pursue music professionally?
PJ: I discovered at the end of my fourth year at Oberlin,
during my double degree program, that while I was very

intrigued by math, I wasn't driven to do it. I didn't love it in
the same way I love music.
I think probably what decided my direction most was
the sharing of summer experiences with my math col
leagues. I would tell them about how I had traveled, playing
in various orchestras under great conductors and having
wonderful musical experiences, and they would tell me
about the proofs they had worked on and problems they
had solved. Upon comparison, given my love for music, I
never felt that I had spent my summer time unwisely.
I've been lucky enough to have a career in the profession
that I really love. I absolutely love music. I have to do it. It's
not an eight-hour job, it's a 24-hour job. I think about
music constantly. I have music in my dreams — sometimes
original, sometimes not.
I absolutely love music. It's not

I: When did you decide to pursue conducting?
FJ: It's something that I actually started relatively late. 1 had
only taken one or two conducting courses during my
undergraduate studies. I didn't really start thinking seri
ously about conducting orchestras until my fist year after
college, when I spent the summer in Halifax, Nova Scotia
[Canada) with the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra.
I had always been interested in conducting, but I also
knew how difficult it was. What both thrilled me and fright
ened me a little bit was the responsibility of leading a large
group of people. Having played with conductors who were
not yet professionals, I realized how much people would
talk about conductors behind their backs and how easy it
was for a conductor to make a mistake or be unclear.
But I chose to pursue svmphonic conducting because it
is the medium and the repertory that 1 really love, and
because the communication that can be established is so
extraordinary. As a conductor, in addition to communica
tion with the composer and the audience, there is also a fan
tastic network that can be established with the group of per
forming musicians. I find that very rewarding.
I: Where have you spent most of your conducting career?
FJ: Well, my wile and 1 have tried to work out a compromise
in today's world of double-career marriages. After she had
finished up her course work in musicology at North Car
olina University, she came out here to Stanford for a year
while 1 finished my last year of course work for my DMA in
conducting. Then she entered a doctoral program at the
University of Chicago, so we went there for two years.
During that time I was the conductor of the chamber
orchestra at the University of Chicago. I also free-lanced

playing the violin and the viola in just about everything
possible in Chicago. I played in the Lyric Opera, all the bal
lets that came through town, several orchestras and many
recording sessions. The recordings were commercials and
radio broadcasts ...
Anyway, at the end of those two years in Chicago, Janie
[his wife] had finished up her doctoral course work and I
had gotten a job at Pomona College in Southern California
as their symphony conductor. So we moved down there,
and during the next five or six years, while I had that full
time job, I finished off my qualifying exams and eventually
did my dissertation and finished my doctoral degree
through Stanford.
My wife and 1 have spent every summer for the last 10 or
11 years at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado. lam a res
ident faculty conductor there during the summers, and
Janie puts together the program book for each week.
Then, in 1989,1 was invited to come up here to Stanford
and audition for the position of visiting professor.
I: What has been most fulfilling for you in your two years
here at Stanford?
PJ: I don't know that I have one favorite thing. But as the
symphony conductor here, I have found that while there are
many very talented student musicians here, what is even
more remarkable is the level of self-motivation in each of
the students.
Morale is very high, ranking up there with the finest stu
dent organizations in the country. The very fact that the
students took it upon themselves to organize a tour is just
incredible. The initiative really comes from them, and their
enthusiasm is infectious. That is the reason that the orches
tra continues to grow ...
It has also been very rewarding to work with the choirs.
I believe that the opera, [Mozart's "Magic Flute"] was a
landmark accomplishment, for the opera program here at
Stanford has been lying dormant for some years, while there
are many wonderful voices here to sing. I have found collab
orating witn Dr. Ramsey, [conductor of the Stanford Cham
ber Chorale], to be an absolute joy ...
I've also really enjoyed teaching classes in conducting
and theory with all levels of students. I try to emphasize
that, for the long run, what I want my students to learn is
how to listen, how their minds should analyze the sounds
they hear and what the relationship is between the musical
notation and the sound.
I: Where do you go from here?
PJ: I'll return to Pomona College, and I'll continue to work
at Aspen every summer. I'm flying straight from Berlin,
which is the last stop on our tour, to Aspen, because I have
six or seven concerts there this summer. In fact I'm arriving
just in time for an afternoon rehearsal...
I've really enioyed being here and I'll be sad to go.
