"Thelma and Louise," starring
Geena Davis and Susan Saran
don
I'd like to apologize to Geena Davis
and Susan Sarandon. I haven't done
them justice.
I've insulted them; I've criticized
them; I've called them nasty names.
Not that they know about it. And not
that they'd lose sleep over it if they did.
But that's not the point.
The point is, I harbored an intense
dislike for Davis and her work — all of
it — and I was under the distinct
impression that Sarandon never did a
movie without taking off her clothes.
In other words, they weren't
Academy Award candidates in my
book.
Until now.
I decided to see "Thelma and
Louise" even though I didn't like the
two main actresses. Why? Because it
looked promising. And my intuition
paid off; "Thelma and Louise" was one
of the best films I've seen all year. Hon
estly.
And it's mainly because of Davis
and Sarandon.
Davis, as Thelma, comes through
with a wonderful — perhaps even an
award-winning — performance. She is
exceptionally ditzy as the submissive,
naive, underappreciated wife of an
inconsiderate, chauvinistic ex-jock,
and is equally convincing as the "born
again" feminist of sorts that her char
acter develops into.
Sarandon, as Louise, excels at tak
ing charge of unexpected situations,
taking charge of Thelma and taking
charge of the movie in general. She
portrays Louise convincingly, making
it clear that behind the "tough" exte
rior is a hidden, fragile side.

Together the two capture the
essence of a true female relationship —
its ups, its downs and its in-betweens.
Their trip across the United States —
on the run from the law — parallels
their journey from a male-centered
world to one of their own, one in
which they are, as Thelma says, "more
awake than ever before."
This may sound like a "men-are
scum-women-are-great-and-underap-
preciated" film, and in a way, it is.
However, all the males in the movie are
such caricatures that it is clear they
represent the negative aspects of a
male-donsunated society, not men in
general. And the women are not as
much underappreciated as they are
underappreciative of themselves.
"Thelma and Louise" has a message
behind it, to be sure, but it doesn't
clobber you over the head with it.
Whether you choose to focus on it or
not is up to you, but either way, the
movie is fulfilling.
Davis, Sarandon: I'm sorry.
