"Hudson Hawk," starring Bruce
Willis, Andie MacDowell,
Danny Aiello and Sandra
Bernhard
Bruce Willis has got it down pat: As
the character who gets the s —t beat
out of him time and time again but
still wins, no one can top him. No one.
In his latest movie, "Hudson
Hawk," Willis plays another one of
these frequently-down-but-never-out
protagonists. This time he is the
world's greatest cat burglar Eddie
Hawkins, who, as the movie opens, has
just been released from a lengthy

prison term. If he's so good at what he
does, how come he got caught?
Though he swears he's had enough
of the prison circuit and wants to be
"rehabilitated," Hawkins is back into
thievery as soon as he is out of jail. He
steals; he stops; he gets his face rear
ranged. He steals again; he gets away;
he gets captured; he gets clocked, etc.
And throughout it all, Hawkins keeps
his sense of humor, his lust for Anna
Baragli (Andie MacDowell) and his
ability to be cool under pressure. If he's
so cool, how come he can't make it to
first base with Anna?
However, Willis hasn't quite got it
all down pat: As a writer, he can be
beat. Willis co-wrote "Hudson Hawk"
with Robert Kraft, and, though the
movie has all the fast-paced adventure
one could ask for, the plot is less than
crisp. Which one's the bad guy?
But, as my companion said to me,
"Shhh, relax; it's just a movie."
And she was right.
"Hudson Hawk" is just a movie,
and to enjoy it you definitely need to
leave your analytical tools at home.
Don't try to figure it out. Don't con
cern yourself with inconsistencies. Just
let it happen.
Because if you agree not to be picky,
"Hudson Hawk" is a lot of fun.
Like the one hysterical scene in
which Willis finds himself on a
stretcher that's been dumped out the
back door of an ambulance. Or
another, equally satisfying moment
when a very annoying dog gets its just
desserts. If they're so funny, how come
I'm not laughing?
Basically, there's no substance to
this movie; it's purely frivolous. But
what else would you expect from a film
featuring Sandra Bernhard as Minerva
Mayflower, a character whose name
might as well be Sandra Bernhard. (If
you've seen her on "Late Night with
David Letterman," you're familiar with
the character.)
Fortunately, just as the viewer can't
take "Hudson Hawk" too seriously, the
actors don't either. Willis and Danny
Aiello, who plays Hawkins' best friend
and partner in crime, probably had a
blast making this movie. They sing;
they dance; they get slapped around;
they do it again, except in a different
part of the world and with bigger toys.
They probably had a better time
making it than you will seeing it. But

go see it anyway. You'll have a good
laugh.
