"Truly, Madly, Deeply" is another
"Ghost," but worse.
"Impossible," you say. Unfortu
nately, it appears to be quite possible.
"Truly. Madly, Deeply" is similar to
"Ghost" in plot, but isn't nearly as sim
ilar in quality. At least the contrived
manipulations in "Ghost" were effec
tive. You laughed, you cried — the
Hollywood formula picture induced a
wide range of emotion. All you'll do
here is yawn.
The movie centers around the
extremely trite story of Nina (Juliet

Stevenson) who is mourning the loss
of her lover, Jamie (Alan Rickman).
Struggling with her grief, Nina imag
ines that she hears Jamie's voice telling
her to lock the back door and walk in
the middle of the road at night.
This life-after- death,
Casper-the-Friendly-Ghost
theme is getting really old.
And then, one magical evening —
surprise, surprise — Jamie returns
from the dead.
Nina, of course, is delighted. The
once-again-happy couple sings, plays
music together and frolics in Nina's
flat for several days.
Eventually, however, Nina becomes
rather irritated with Jamie: He's just
not as exciting dead as he was alive.
The fate of their existential relation
ship is sealed when Nina meets a new
man. The mere fact that this guy has a
heart beat is enough to woo Nina:
Jamie's history, again.
This life-after-death, Casper-the-

Friendly-Ghost theme is getting really
old. We all know the story already:
Relationships where only half of the
couple is alive just don't work. Societal
constraints do not allow for necrophil
ial romances; eventually, the dead
member of the twosome must let the
live one move on with his or her life.
Writer/director Anthony Minghella
has tried to rework the specter theme
without all the glitz. There are no
amazing special effects, no beautiful
people, no loony psychics — just two
plain people in an even plainer movie.
He should have kept the glitz.
The thing is, I feel as if 1 should
have liked this film. It's European.
Everyone in it has an English accent.
It's playing in art houses, for goodness
sake! It must have had some deep,
meaningful message.
But I couldn't find it.
Minghella would have done better
had he taken a few more lessons from
summer blockbuster and undeserving
Oscar nominee, "Ghost." "Truly,
Madly, Deeply" is simply, overwhelm
ingly and pathetically boring.
