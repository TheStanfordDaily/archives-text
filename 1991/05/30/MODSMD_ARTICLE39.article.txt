Dots Will Echo
As far as I'm concerned, Dots Will
Echo will echo. No, I'm not stuttering.
It's just that this new, punk-pop band
has an energetic but comfortable
sound that invites me to play their
record over and over.
You may be wondering what I
mean by punk-pop. Well, the band
reveals a rebellious, near-thrasher
character while maintaining a musical
sense in a framework of poignant, and
at times witty, lyrics. Dots Will Echo
could well be classified as a "garage
band," since they exude the youthful
spirit of a band content to jam at a
campus party or in Dad's garage.
Their instrumental structure is
similar to that of Toad the Wet
Sprocket, with an emphasis on simple
guitar and percussion components.
The anecdotal, humorous lyrics, char
acteristic of Elvis Costello and Lou
Reed, are mostly performed by Nick
Berry, who is credited with "most of
the vocal noises." I, however, am
tempted to call these noises singing.
Though Berry's voice, similar to Sam
ples' singer Sean Kelley's, can be whiny

and annoying, it is rescued from
becoming monotonous by Berry's
conversational side comments and ver
bal experiments.
A particularly good example of
Berry's ability to push beyond the
melodic structure of a tune is evident
on both "Everything In The World"
and "She's A Girl." By grinding his
voice and experimenting, Berry
ignores melodic precision, giving the
songs an appropriately rebellious,
teen-ager feel.
However, other cuts from the
album highlight fewer vocals and more
instrumentation. "Rain," for instance,
features a prominent bass line, which
creates, with the help of Steve Meltzer's
drums, an entrancing beat much like
that of rain beating on the roof.
And the syncopated wooden per
cussion in "Someday" promotes the
image of a three-piece band playing for
dimes on the street. Its Latin-based
rhythm and harmonies make this tune
well-suited for a hot, summer after
noon.
Another song, "I Will Too," strives
for a similar tone but falls short due to
the hyper-intensity of Berry's upper
range voice. Berry's tone fails to con
form to the relaxed swing of the
instrumentals; he needs a more sultry
sound in order to competently achieve
the appropriate mood to accompany
the gentle instrumentals of this ballad.
Despite this, however, Dots Will
Echo deserves a listen. The effort,
energy and clever lyrics of these young
musicians should not be overlooked.

They are not overly concerned with
tonal or rhythmic accuracy; rather,
they express moods with an adventur
ous approach. I guarantee the Dots
will grow on you if you give them a
chance to echo.
