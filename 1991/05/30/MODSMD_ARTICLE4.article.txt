# White Plaza stench attacked
## 
### Anne Hoge Staff writer 
When Mario Sousa began
working for Stanford 22 years ago
as a steam fitter, "wretched smell
rectifier" was not in his job
description.
But Sousa and his co-workers
from the steam fitters shop, a divi
sion of Operations and Mainte
nance in charge of installing and
maintaining boilers and pipes,
have been trying to remedy the
"White Plaza stench" since the
problem began five years ago.
Born in the Azores, Sousa
received his steam fitter training
in the Portuguese Army. "I served
for 20 years and never have had to
deal with something like this,"
Sousa said as he shakes his head
and lifts his hat to brush his silver
hair back.
Before him now rests a steam
manhole under a stairwell outside
the Corner Pocket at Tresidder

Union. Peering inside Sousa said
most of the smell nas come from
this hole. Sousa describes the
smell as "not very pleasant — a lot
like fermenting dairy products."
"A few years ago, a yogurt com
pany began dumping their left
overs into this hole," he said. "We
kept trying to get them to stop,
but they wouldn't. Finally, we had
to go to the big guys."
The Marriott Company, which
catered for Tresidder until 1989,
operated a yogurt shop where the
Corner Pocket is located now.
Tresidder administrators say the
yogurt company dumped its left
over yogurt into the manhole,
thinking it was a sewage drain,
two or three times prior to 1989.
"Look on the walls over here,
and you see the white growing on
the side. This is what causes the
smell," Sousa pointed out. Despite
the darkness, a white film that
covers the inside wall can be seen.
The film, he added, consists of

bacteria that have grown from
cultures in the original yogurt and
other waste dumped there.
The hole is not a sewage drain
but contains pipes carrying hot
water, Sousa said. The waste had
nowhere to go and the pipes make
everything so hot and damp that
the bacteria have stayed alive, he
added.
Sousa begins to chuckle as he
tells the story of when workers
first tried to diagnose the cause of
the smell. "We would go down to
look and the smell was so bad that
we would hold our breath and
then run back up few minutes
later."
He added that after leaving the
manhole, "we just took off our
clothes and threw them away.
They smelled so bad."
The entire manhole has to be
replaced to permanently get rid of
the bacteria film , he said. The
film has found a home both on the
concrete and in the insulation
underneath the concrete in the
hole.
"We tried disinfectant and
everything. It wouldn't go away,"
adds Sousa.
To try to get rid of the smell,
the steam fitters decided to hang
several 12-inch-by-12-inch

cherry-scented wax blocks from
the metal railing.
"It gets so hot that the wax
melts and the smell goes away for
awhile," Sousa said.
The cherry-scented blocks have
been replaced every few months
since then, helping to mask the
smell. The most recent block was
placed in the hole a year ago.
Sousa claims there have been no
complaints of the smell in the last
few months.
Lifting the manhole cover
behind the stage in White Plaza,

near Braun Music Center, Sousa
points out melted wax on the con
crete near the hole.
Sousa quickly scaled down the
ladder and disappeared into the
shadows of the hole.
"Don't worry," he said, the
steam carrying his voice up,
"there aren't rats here. Only
sometimes in the winter, the ones
with the little masks on their
faces, raccoons you call them,
come to live here for the heat."
Within minutes, in the confines
of the tiny concrete underground

room, sweat formed on Sousa's
thin mustache as he explained the
intricate maze of pipes.
He stopped, pointing at a coal
hlack one, about a foot around.
"This is the other cause of the
smell," he sighed. "People would
pour grease down their sinks and
a huge grease ball formed in this
one. All the sewage got backed up
in it, causing everything to rot in
the pipe. We've asked some of the
houses up behind there," he said,
pointing to Braun, "to stop pour
ing the grease. They've been
pretty good about it lately."
Small soiled ropes attached to

the ladder indicate where wax
blocks last hung a few years ago.
The problem was first noticed
when backed-up sewage from the
pipe sent "the smell" wafting
through Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
according to Operations and
Maintenance Director Bruce Wig
gins.
"Leave it to Murphy's Law that
the smell first appeared during a
performance in front of a packed
crowd five years ago," said Wig
gins. The grease ball, which
formed in the pipe as the hot
grease cooled, is a problem that
has corrected itself over the years

as it has slowly eroded away.
However, waste still gets
backed up occasionally, and the
smell returns for a while. "We're
back down here sometimes trying
to see what the problem is," Sousa
said. "The smell may be here for
ever and all we can do is try and
cover it up or replace the entire
manhole and pipes."
Sousa and the steam fitters'
contributions to combating the
problem of the stench in White
Plaza will bring another year of
easier breathing as long as the
community follows the rule of
"No dumping."

"there aren't rats here. Only
sometimes in the winter, the ones
with the little masks on their
faces, raccoons you call them,
come to live here for the heat."
Within minutes, in the confines
of the tiny concrete underground

room, sweat formed on Sousa's
thin mustache as he explained the
intricate maze of pipes.
He stopped, pointing at a coal
hlack one, about a foot around.
"This is the other cause of the
smell," he sighed. "People would
pour grease down their sinks and
a huge grease ball formed in this
one. All the sewage got backed up
in it, causing everything to rot in
the pipe. We've asked some of the
houses up behind there," he said,
pointing to Braun, "to stop pour
ing the grease. They've been
pretty good about it lately."

blocks last hung a few years ago.
The problem was first noticed
when backed-up sewage from the
pipe sent "the smell" wafting
through Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
according to Operations and
Maintenance Director Bruce Wig
gins.
"Leave it to Murphy's Law that
the smell first appeared during a
performance in front of a packed
crowd five years ago," said Wig
gins. The grease ball, which
formed in the pipe as the hot
grease cooled, is a problem that
has corrected itself over the years

as it has slowly eroded away.
However, waste still gets
backed up occasionally, and the
smell returns for a while. "We're
back down here sometimes trying
to see what the problem is," Sousa
said. "The smell may be here for
ever and all we can do is try and
cover it up or replace the entire
manhole and pipes."
Sousa and the steam fitters'
contributions to combating the
problem of the stench in White
Plaza will bring another year of
easier breathing as long as the
community follows the rule of
"No dumping."
When Mario Sousa began
working for Stanford 22 years ago
as a steam fitter, "wretched smell
rectifier" was not in his job
description.
But Sousa and his co-workers
from the steam fitters shop, a divi
sion of Operations and Mainte
nance in charge of installing and
maintaining boilers and pipes,
have been trying to remedy the
"White Plaza stench" since the
problem began five years ago.
Born in the Azores, Sousa
received his steam fitter training
in the Portuguese Army. "I served
for 20 years and never have had to
deal with something like this,"
Sousa said as he shakes his head
and lifts his hat to brush his silver
hair back.
Before him now rests a steam
manhole under a stairwell outside
the Corner Pocket at Tresidder

Union. Peering inside Sousa said
most of the smell nas come from
this hole. Sousa describes the
smell as "not very pleasant — a lot
like fermenting dairy products."
"A few years ago, a yogurt com
pany began dumping their left
overs into this hole," he said. "We
kept trying to get them to stop,
but they wouldn't. Finally, we had
to go to the big guys."
The Marriott Company, which
catered for Tresidder until 1989,
operated a yogurt shop where the
Corner Pocket is located now.
Tresidder administrators say the
yogurt company dumped its left
over yogurt into the manhole,
thinking it was a sewage drain,
two or three times prior to 1989.
"Look on the walls over here,
and you see the white growing on
the side. This is what causes the
smell," Sousa pointed out. Despite
the darkness, a white film that
covers the inside wall can be seen.
The film, he added, consists of

bacteria that have grown from
cultures in the original yogurt and
other waste dumped there.
The hole is not a sewage drain
but contains pipes carrying hot
water, Sousa said. The waste had
nowhere to go and the pipes make
everything so hot and damp that
the bacteria have stayed alive, he
added.
Sousa begins to chuckle as he
tells the story of when workers
first tried to diagnose the cause of
the smell. "We would go down to
look and the smell was so bad that
we would hold our breath and
then run back up few minutes
later."
He added that after leaving the
manhole, "we just took off our
clothes and threw them away.
They smelled so bad."
The entire manhole has to be
replaced to permanently get rid of
the bacteria film , he said. The
film has found a home both on the
concrete and in the insulation
underneath the concrete in the
hole.
"We tried disinfectant and
everything. It wouldn't go away,"
adds Sousa.
To try to get rid of the smell,
the steam fitters decided to hang
several 12-inch-by-12-inch

cherry-scented wax blocks from
the metal railing.
"It gets so hot that the wax
melts and the smell goes away for
awhile," Sousa said.
The cherry-scented blocks have
been replaced every few months
since then, helping to mask the
smell. The most recent block was
placed in the hole a year ago.
Sousa claims there have been no
complaints of the smell in the last
few months.
Lifting the manhole cover
behind the stage in White Plaza,

near Braun Music Center, Sousa
points out melted wax on the con
crete near the hole.
Sousa quickly scaled down the
ladder and disappeared into the
shadows of the hole.
"Don't worry," he said, the
steam carrying his voice up,
"there aren't rats here. Only
sometimes in the winter, the ones
with the little masks on their
faces, raccoons you call them,
come to live here for the heat."
