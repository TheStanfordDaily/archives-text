# White Plaza stench attacked
## 
### Anne Hoge Staff writer 
When Mario Sousa began
working for Stanford 22 years ago
as a steam fitter, "wretched smell
rectifier" was not in his job
description.
But Sousa and his co-workers
from the steam fitters shop, a divi
sion of Operations and Mainte
nance in charge of installing and
maintaining boilers and pipes,
have been trying to remedy the
"White Plaza stench" since the
problem began five years ago.
Born in the Azores, Sousa
received his steam fitter training
in the Portuguese Army. "I served
for 20 years and never have had to
deal with something like this,"
Sousa said as he shakes his head
and lifts his hat to brush his silver
hair back.
Before him now rests a steam
manhole under a stairwell outside
the Corner Pocket at Tresidder

Union. Peering inside Sousa said
most of the smell nas come from
this hole. Sousa describes the
smell as "not very pleasant â€” a lot
like fermenting dairy products."
"A few years ago, a yogurt com
pany began dumping their left
overs into this hole," he said. "We
kept trying to get them to stop,
but they wouldn't. Finally, we had
to go to the big guys."
The Marriott Company, which
catered for Tresidder until 1989,
operated a yogurt shop where the
Corner Pocket is located now.
Tresidder administrators say the
yogurt company dumped its left
over yogurt into the manhole,
thinking it was a sewage drain,
two or three times prior to 1989.
"Look on the walls over here,
and you see the white growing on
the side. This is what causes the
smell," Sousa pointed out. Despite
the darkness, a white film that
covers the inside wall can be seen.
The film, he added, consists of

bacteria that have grown from
cultures in the original yogurt and
other waste dumped there.
The hole is not a sewage drain
but contains pipes carrying hot
water, Sousa said. The waste had
nowhere to go and the pipes make
everything so hot and damp that
the bacteria have stayed alive, he
added.
Sousa begins to chuckle as he
tells the story of when workers
first tried to diagnose the cause of
the smell. "We would go down to
look and the smell was so bad that
we would hold our breath and
then run back up few minutes
later."
He added that after leaving the
manhole, "we just took off our
clothes and threw them away.
They smelled so bad."
The entire manhole has to be
replaced to permanently get rid of
the bacteria film , he said. The
