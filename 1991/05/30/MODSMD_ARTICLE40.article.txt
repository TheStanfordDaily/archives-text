"Unreal World"
The Godfathers
I liked The Godfathers the first time
I heard them, three years — and three
albums — ago. Their music is based
heavily on guitar sounds rooted in '60s
psychedelia. But the band uses their
'60s influence only as a starting point,
building upon it with a freshness and
youthful innocence that is at once
compelling, brash and ingenious.
Ail too often, bands that play upon
influences from other eras, be they
rockabilly or psychedelia, do so with
an irritating and studied self-con
sciousness that creates a barrier to the
music. The Godfathers avoid this by
not approaching their psychedelic
roots from the standpoint of a '90s
band doing '60s music. Rather, they
pick up the '60s sounds and sense of
exploration as though they were still
new, as though no time had elapsed
since they were created.
The Godfathers' 14-year-old star
guitarist has decided to leave the band
to go to high school, but his replace
ment fits in seamlessly. Listening to
The Godfathers gives me the same
sense of excitement I felt when I first
heard The Smiths: The guitar parts are
beautifully intricate and move the

songs along with a great spirit.
Indeed, The Godfathers have a lot
in common with The Smiths. Lead
singer Peter Coyne's voice is easier to
listen to but is just as expressive as
Steven Morrissey's, and he also sings
about gloomy themes. At times
Coyne's voice recalls the stylings of lan
McCulloch, ex-vocalist for Echo and
the Bunnymen, or Richard Butler of
the Psychedelic Furs.

Songs such as "King of Misery,"
"Unreal World" and "Drag Me Down
Again" continue The Godfather saga
— from 1988's "Birth, School, Work,
Death" — of cynical views of life and
relationships. Yet underneath all the
soggy lyrical pessimism, the music is
melodic and inspired. As with The
Smiths, the bouncy guitars and tight
drum beats are the perfect foil for the
lyrics, and Coyne manages to deliver

his lyrics without Morrissey's self-ref
erential whining.
The Godfathers walk the difficult
line between retro and new, using past
influences but not becoming over
whelmed by them. "Unreal World" is
what you might expect to hear if The
Beatles had made another album
between "Revolver" and"The White
Album."
