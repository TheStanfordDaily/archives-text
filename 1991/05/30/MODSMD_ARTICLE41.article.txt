# Soothing symphonic stress relief
## STAGE 
### 
The Stanford Symphony
Orchestra will perform its last
concert of the season tomorrow
and Saturday at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets
are $4 for students.
It's that time again.
What time is it? Time for those pre-
Dead Week blues.
You know, that period during the
quarter when you figure out there is no
time to catch up and it's all a big joke
and you're so behind and you have to
drop all your units and ...
HOLD ON! Relax for a minute.
Chill out.
Stress relief is here, and it's not
spelled R-O-L-A-I-D-S.
Try S-Y-M-P-H-O-N-Y. Better yet,
try symphony visualization.
Here's what you do: Close your eyes
and envision Natalie Wood and the
whole "West Side Story" entourage
dancing and singing.
Why "West Side Story"? Because
our own Stanford Symphony Orches
tra will be performing Leonard Bern
stein's magnificent "Symphonic
Dances" from that very musical. Even
without the Jets and the Sharks, the
work is gorgeous. And, with no visuals
to distract you, you can imagine to
your hearts content, feeling the tension
ease from your body.
Violinist Alan Rakov, giving his last
performance as a Stanford student,
will bring you through the next phase
of this calming concert journey. With
the symphony as his canvas, he will
add his personal touches to Ravel's
"Tzigane."
This is a key opportunity, for more
than one reason. This concert is also a
sneak preview of the repertoire the
symphony will perform in Eastern
Europe.

So if you can't make it Budapest,
Prague, Vienna, Leipzig or Berlin to
see the symphony this summer, you
shouldn't miss them while they're still
on campus.
Saturday night's concert is also the
last performance of conductor Peter
Jaffe, affectionately know to the
orchestra as Peter. He will certainly
leave with a grand finale.
So go. Give yourself a break.
