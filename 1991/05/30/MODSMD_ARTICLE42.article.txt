# Theater-on-the-spot
## 
### 
The Stanford Improvisers will
present an evening of theater
sports in the Little Theater
tonight at 8:30. Free tickets are
available at the door.
"Who's on first?"
"What's on second?"
"How many times have you heard
this?"
Sick of the same old routine?
Well then, it's time for something
completely different.
Tonight, in the Little Theater, the
Stanford Improvisers (SIMPS) will
deliver a final blow to the institution of
line memorization as they create
sometimes witty, often hilarious, but
always entirely unrehearsed scenes on
the spot.
SIMPS, the Drama Department's
improvisation troupe, will compete
among themselves to create the funni
est, most innovative performances
from audience-suggested scenarios.
Trite, overdone scripts will be
nowhere to be found during this
evening of theater sports presented by
the department's aspiring actors.
Under the direction of Drama Lec
turer Patricia Ryan, SIMPS grew out of
the department's advanced improvisa
tion class. In addition to campus the
ater events, the group teaches improvi
sation techniques to students through
workshops in campus residences.
