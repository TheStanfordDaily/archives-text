# 'Toad' headlines campus party's triple-bill

### Kristin Schrader 
It's the dream of every high school
rock-and-roller: form a band, stay
together forever and achieve fame and
fortune. Toad The Wet Sprocket has
fulfilled that dream.
The first and only band in which
Dean Dinning, Randy Guss, Todd
Nichols and Glen Phillips have ever
played, Toad The Wet Sprocket pro
vides a model for all other young
musical dreamers. Attending the same
high school in Santa Barbara, the four
met while working on a production of
"Our Town" and have been together
ever since.
The group, which will be perform
ing on campus this weekend, began
playing at a local dive, the Shack,
where they were forced to compose
original material because the owner of
the place refused to pay the publishing
dues necessary to perform covers.
Boy, was that a long time ago.
Five years ago, to be exact, and
though Toad The Wet Sprocket con
tinues to perform original composi
tions, they no longer play solo at places
called "the Shack." Instead, they now
open for acts such as the B-52s and
Michael Penn. and, they've released
two albums of their own.
They've come a long way and
they've done it together. As a result,
the bonds linking the members of
Toad The Wet Sprocket run deep. All
four musicians credit each other for
writing the songs on their albums; no
one will take credit for a particular
tune.
Technically, the music is written by
lead guitarist Nichols or by lead vocal
ist Phillips, who also writes lyrics. But
Nichols claims the final product, espe
cially the instrumental arrangement, is
definitely collaborative; everyone chips
in so individual recognition is insignif
icant and unnecessary.
This sense of unity and harmony
carries over into Toad's music, which is
lacking the battling instrumental
forces so often heard in alternative
rock music.
Toad's lyrics, although at times
depressing, convey themes of both
social commentary and personal
introspection. This exclusively male
band is surprisingly sensitive to the

sentiments and roles of women, as
expressed in "One Little Girl," "She
Cried" and "Hold Her Down." How
ever, these messages are directed
toward men as well.
"Glen writes about what he sees,"
claims Nichols, and addresses society
as a whole in doing so. One cannot
help respecting the empathy and sensi
tivity in these songs as well as others
concerning such issues as death and
mourning, the constraints of social
roles and the frustration of love (and
perhaps hate) relationships.

Chris Blake, manager of Toad The
Wet Sprocket, guarantees that the
soon-to-be-released album, "Fear," is
excellent. It is a collection of songs the
band has been working on over the
past three years.
Nichols credits the album with a
variety of different directions from
rockin', upbeat tunes — more accessi
ble than their past releases — to weird,
experimental music.
"It's all over the place," he fore
warns, noting that they still maintain
the traditional Toad tone on several of

the 12 tracks.
The album's release is anticipated at
the end of July, but for those of you
who want a sneak preview, Toad will
perform on campus at a fraternity's
party Saturday night, where they will
test out some of their new material.
If you are hoping to hear some
familiar favorites, do not fear, for the
selections should be about equally split
among the three albums.
Although Toad The Wet Sprocket
does not play the typical dance music
heard at most campus parties, it would
be well worth your while to sacrifice a
couple of hours of bump 'n' grind to
take advantage of this concert. Satur
day night is your chance to hear Toad
play live and to preview for yourself
their latest from "Fear."

Toad the Wet Sprocket will be one of
three hands performing at the Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity party in Sterling
Quad on Saturday night.
