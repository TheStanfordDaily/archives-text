# The
						Peanuts gang goes back to grade school in Toyon Hall roadshow

At 9 a.m. yesterday, Jason Sny
der was dressed in a dog suit, crawl
ing on his hands and knees in front
of several hundred elementary
school kids.
And he liked it.
Snyder, you see, is Snoopy. He
— along with Linus, Charlie
Brown, Peppermint Patty, Lucy
and the little red-haired girl — took
Toyon Hall's dorm musical,
"You're A Good Man, Charlie
Brown," on the road.
All the way to East Palo Alto.
Twice.
"You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown" is basically a musical comic
strip. It is a conglomeration of most
of the classic Peanuts themes and
performing it inspires audience
participation, which, according to
the actors, the kids really enjoyed.
At one point in the show, Lucy
asks if Socrates ever became king,
and to the surprise of the actors, the
children answered correctly with an
emphatic no. At another point,
Lucy recites the pledge of allegiance
and all the students in the audience
started saying it with her.
"It was the sort of thing where
your energy gets higher and feeds
off the kids because they're so excit
ed," Snyder said.
"I wanted to do a whole bunch
more performances," he continued,

explaining that the two schools the
troupe visited this week are places
that have "a big need for more
entertainment and fun.
At one point in the
show, Lucy asks if
Socrates ever became
king., and to the
surprise of the actors,
the children answered
correctly with an
emphatic no.
"My favorite part was after the
show, we walked into the audience
and talked to the kids. I really liked
interacting with the kids. They
asked us all kinds of questions like,
'Why does Linus always suck his
thumb?' and 'Did you see the little
red-haired girl?' They were obvi
ously so excited to have us there."
If you feel left out of the excite
ment, don't. "You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown" will be performed
for older kids tonight and tomor
row night at 8:30 in the Toyon
lounge.
But if you come, you have to
know the pledge of allegiance.
