# Dunkin' doughnuts 'round the clock
## 
### 
The 20th century has been witness
to incredible advances of mankind.
We can put a man on the moon. We
can harness the incredible power of the
atom. And, unlike during any other
period in history, we can get a fresh
doughnut at any time of the day or
night.
Clearly, the 24-hour doughnut
shop is a modern miracle.
Think about it. What better sym
bolizes the success of our civilization
than the fact that at any hour you can
not only make a photocopy, but can
also get a doughnut? Few 3 a.m. study
breaks are better than a trip to a 24-
hour doughnut shop for a fresh fried
pastry. In fact, doughnut shops are
great places to study at night because
they're generally quiet and always have
a large supply of cheap coffee.
Of course, there are other places —
such as the supermarket or most bak
eries — to get doughnuts, places that
aren't open 24 hours a day. However,
these shops only make one batch of
dorughnuts daily. To purchase a dough
nut from one of these shops, any time
after, say, 4 p.m., can be quite disap
pointing; it often results in ownership
of an object that should be buried
rather than eaten.
"Yes," I can hear you say, "24-hour
doughnut shops are clearly a boon to
mankind, but is it possible to find
them near Stanford?"
Unfortunately, the answer is no. It
seems that the Palo Alto City Council
has enacted a ordinance forcing all
local doughnut places to close at dusk.
(Well, maybe not, but it seems that
way.)
There are 24-hour shops within
driving range, however, and, having
spent the past year seeking out these
always-open wonders, I have hap
pened across two that meet my stan
dard of approval (i.e., they're open).
But before I review these doughnut
havens, let's get some terminology
straight. There are two basic doughnut

groups: "cake" doughnuts and "raised"
doughnuts. In order to distinguish
between these two types, one only
needs to do a simple test: Press down
on the doughnut. If it is relatively soft,
it is raised; if it is hard, it is cake. (Or a
stale raised.)
The taste of the two doughnut
types differs as well. Cake doughnuts
taste as you would think — like pieces
of cake. This is the kind most super
markets sell (because they can't really
get stale), but 24-hour doughnut
shops sell them as well. Raised dough
nuts taste ... well, ... it's difficult to
describe. Let's just say that the perfect
raised doughnut has such a soft texture
that it melts in your mouth.
OK, now for the review:
Happy Donuts is your basic
doughnut-store chain. The Redwood
City shop looks more like a McDon
ald's than a doughnut store, but beg
gars can't be choosers. Besides, Happy

Ardith Ibaftez — Daily
Donuts is, as the big sign reads out
front, Always Open. And, the dough
nuts are not made but are "created
daily," or so say the doughnut bags
emblazoned with the company logo.
Happy Donuts sells both cake and
raised doughnuts for 50 cents each,
$4.50 for a dozen. Filled doughnuts
(jelly and custard) are slightly more
expensive, at 75 cents. A small coffee is
60 cents and refills are 30 cents. Most
of the doughnuts I tried met my high
standard of approval (they tasted
good). The custard doughnut, how
ever, tasted more like vanilla pudding,
which was fine with me since I like
vanilla pudding better than custard.
True custard aficionados, though, may
be disappointed.
With its plastic tables and chairs,
Happy Donuts looks like a fast-food
joint. I personally don't like that atmo
sphere for a doughnut shop; when I
think of a 24-hour doughnut place, I

think of a hometown coffee shop in
which the owner is back in the kitchen
baking. However, it's got the goods.
Chuck's Donuts, also in Redwood
City, is quite different from Happy
Donuts. It, too, is part of a small chain
(there are three in the area) but it
seems more like a small-town dough
nut place. A little store on Woodside
Avenue, Chuck's has a quaint sign
hanging outside and has those neat
spinning stools inside, the ones I
always associate with small-town cof
fee shops. Whenever I walk in to
Chuck's, I get the feeling that he's
there, making doughnuts just for me.
And what great doughnuts they are!
Whether cake, raised or filled, all of
Chuck's doughnuts are delicious. And
cheap! Chuck's prices are 45 cents for a
doughnut (65 cents for a filled one),
$4.00 for a dozen and 65 cents for cof
fee, which includes a free refill. But the
greatest thing about Chuck's is its reli
ability. You can count on the fact that
at 10 p.m., the first night batch of
glazed, raised doughnuts will emerge
from the side room where they're
baked. And a fresh, glazed doughnut
from Chuck's is the best doughnut
experience ever.
Overall, Chuck's is your better bet.
The prices are cheaper, the atmosphere
is great and doughnuts are delicious
and fresh when you want them to be.
So, the next time you want a study
break, don't just head down to the
soda machine for a Coke. Go to a 24-

tage of a modern miracle.

a large supply of cheap coffee.
Of course, there are other places —
such as the supermarket or most bak
eries — to get doughnuts, places that
aren't open 24 hours a day. However,
these shops only make one batch of
dorughnuts daily. To purchase a dough
nut from one of these shops, any time
after, say, 4 p.m., can be quite disap
pointing; it often results in ownership
of an object that should be buried
rather than eaten.
"Yes," I can hear you say, "24-hour
doughnut shops are clearly a boon to
mankind, but is it possible to find
them near Stanford?"
Unfortunately, the answer is no. It
seems that the Palo Alto City Council
has enacted a ordinance forcing all
local doughnut places to close at dusk.
(Well, maybe not, but it seems that
way.)
There are 24-hour shops within
driving range, however, and, having
spent the past year seeking out these
always-open wonders, I have hap
pened across two that meet my stan
dard of approval (i.e., they're open).
But before I review these doughnut
havens, let's get some terminology
straight. There are two basic doughnut

groups: "cake" doughnuts and "raised"
doughnuts. In order to distinguish
between these two types, one only
needs to do a simple test: Press down
on the doughnut. If it is relatively soft,
it is raised; if it is hard, it is cake. (Or a
stale raised.)
The taste of the two doughnut
types differs as well. Cake doughnuts
taste as you would think — like pieces
of cake. This is the kind most super
markets sell (because they can't really
get stale), but 24-hour doughnut
shops sell them as well. Raised dough
nuts taste ... well, ... it's difficult to
describe. Let's just say that the perfect
raised doughnut has such a soft texture
that it melts in your mouth.
OK, now for the review:
Happy Donuts is your basic
doughnut-store chain. The Redwood
City shop looks more like a McDon
ald's than a doughnut store, but beg
gars can't be choosers. Besides, Happy

Ardith Ibaftez — Daily
Donuts is, as the big sign reads out
front, Always Open. And, the dough
nuts are not made but are "created
daily," or so say the doughnut bags
emblazoned with the company logo.
Happy Donuts sells both cake and
raised doughnuts for 50 cents each,
$4.50 for a dozen. Filled doughnuts
(jelly and custard) are slightly more
expensive, at 75 cents. A small coffee is
60 cents and refills are 30 cents. Most
of the doughnuts I tried met my high
standard of approval (they tasted
good). The custard doughnut, how
ever, tasted more like vanilla pudding,
which was fine with me since I like
vanilla pudding better than custard.
True custard aficionados, though, may
be disappointed.
With its plastic tables and chairs,
Happy Donuts looks like a fast-food
joint. I personally don't like that atmo
sphere for a doughnut shop; when I
think of a 24-hour doughnut place, I

think of a hometown coffee shop in
which the owner is back in the kitchen
baking. However, it's got the goods.
Chuck's Donuts, also in Redwood
City, is quite different from Happy
Donuts. It, too, is part of a small chain
(there are three in the area) but it
seems more like a small-town dough
nut place. A little store on Woodside
Avenue, Chuck's has a quaint sign
hanging outside and has those neat
spinning stools inside, the ones I
always associate with small-town cof
fee shops. Whenever I walk in to
Chuck's, I get the feeling that he's
there, making doughnuts just for me.
And what great doughnuts they are!
Whether cake, raised or filled, all of
Chuck's doughnuts are delicious. And
cheap! Chuck's prices are 45 cents for a
doughnut (65 cents for a filled one),
$4.00 for a dozen and 65 cents for cof
fee, which includes a free refill. But the
greatest thing about Chuck's is its reli
ability. You can count on the fact that
at 10 p.m., the first night batch of
glazed, raised doughnuts will emerge
from the side room where they're
baked. And a fresh, glazed doughnut
from Chuck's is the best doughnut
experience ever.
Overall, Chuck's is your better bet.
The prices are cheaper, the atmosphere
is great and doughnuts are delicious
and fresh when you want them to be.
So, the next time you want a study
break, don't just head down to the
soda machine for a Coke. Go to a 24-
hour doughnut shop and take advan
tage of a modern miracle.

The 20th century has been witness
to incredible advances of mankind.
We can put a man on the moon. We
can harness the incredible power of the
atom. And, unlike during any other
period in history, we can get a fresh
doughnut at any time of the day or
night.
Clearly, the 24-hour doughnut
shop is a modern miracle.
Think about it. What better sym
bolizes the success of our civilization
than the fact that at any hour you can
not only make a photocopy, but can
also get a doughnut? Few 3 a.m. study
breaks are better than a trip to a 24-
hour doughnut shop for a fresh fried
pastry. In fact, doughnut shops are
great places to study at night because
they're generally quiet and always have
a large supply of cheap coffee.
Of course, there are other places —
such as the supermarket or most bak
eries — to get doughnuts, places that
