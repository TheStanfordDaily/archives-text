# Neglected video arcade is Tresidder's forgotten child
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
It is the story of a Utopia gone bad,
a place left in the dust by new trends
and technological breakthroughs.
The dark horse on the Farm, it is a
place you will never see pictured in any
of Stanford's sleek propaganda. It is a
room that will know no Centennial
joys.
Its surroundings offer it no solace,
but rather seem to call attention to its
decrepitude and obsolescence. "Ha
ha!" taunts the obnoxious Coffee
House, "Behold all these patrons pour
ing into me! Ahhh, so many quarters!"
And from the second floor, the
high-tech AlRport brags, "Ponder all
my megabytes! Witness all these peo
ple perched before my screens."
The Stanford Video Arcade is
indeed the black sheep of Tresidder
Memorial Student Union — and
maybe of the entire University.
"I am a loser!" it cries out, and that
sentiment is echoed by its archaic
video games, broken basketball-toss
machine and neglected candy
machines.
Students who enter the arcade
know they are associating with a loser.
They enter the room with their heads
bowed to the ground, apologetic
expressions on their faces.
These students, though they are
spending valuable time and money
senselessly shooting at centipedes or
furiously flapping silver balls with
bumpers, are no fools. As a clever rep
utation-preserving mechanism, they
enter the arcade in dirty clothes. That

way, in case anyone they know sees
them entering the spurned entertain
ment den, they can pull out a dollar
and explain, "Just getting quarters for
laundry!" Or perhaps they wear dirty
clothes to generate the necessary smell
so that potential onlookers will leave
them in peace as they obliterate gor
gons and save the Earth.
A cursory look at the video games
reveals severe neglect. A Star Wars
placard has somehow found its way to
the top of a Centipede game. Appro
priately, the Forgotten Worlds video
game has been condemned to eternal
solitude: "Out of order, play at your
own risk," says the sign above the
screen. Will anyone dare sneak a play
and fondle the knobs of "Forgotten
Worlds"? Yes, but they will be the same
people who stuck metal forks in elec
trical sockets as young children and,
due to a loosening of mental circuits,
have been toying with the forbidden
ever since.
A closer look at the games shows
an even more profound level of disre
gard. The game room, alas, is not mul
ticultural! Combatribes, a friendly
game of gang warfare, pits several
white gang members against one black
man — who is twice the size of the
largest white man.
The object of this racist game is to
punch or kick in the heads of the
opposing gangs members, while tak
ing care not to get flogged to death by
a chain or pancaked under a speeding
car. "Combatribes" is a favorite game
among students hailing from Los
Angeles and has been proven to cause
dangerous levels of aggression in labo

ratory rats.
Next to the gang-war fare game
stands NARC — Say No To Drugs.
This game, in which you "bust" people
by firing at them, was an inspiration of
the Nancy Reagan years and has not
yet been replaced by anything more

current, such as RADIOLOGIST -
This Screen is Emitting Cancerous
Levels of Radiation.
Moonwaiker, featuring Michael
Jackson, is perhaps the least-played
game and one that reveals just how
trendy the arcade was at one time. It is

the only one to feature a "DANCE"
button next to the "SHOOT" button,
for all those who want to do a celebra
tory jig after blowing someone up.
While this may sound warped, it looks
rather benign in animated, graphic
form.
Only those students of the Pac Man
generation will grace the aged
machines with their touch. Raised at a
time when placing a bow on a Pac Man
to form Ms. Pac Man was considered a
major technological breakthrough,
these people don't know any better.
They don't realize that video games
that don't simulate nuclear war, aren't
in 3-D and don't actually talk to you
(instead of just blipping and war
bling), are totally unacceptable to
younger and more hip game players.
While nobody has bothered to
raise the 25-cent price of the neglected
video games to keep up with inflation,
the pinball machines, standing at the
back of the room, now cost a whop
ping 50 cents. For many arcade
patrons, that's a good share of the
allowance they received as 12-year
olds, back in the good old days when
people didn't look at them and
exclaim, "Playing arcade games — at
your age?!"
The prize pinball machine is Dr.
Dude. The Doctor, who charges 50
cents for five balls, is depicted on the
front of the machine saying to his
voluptuous nurse, say "Ahhh-some." A
true California delight, it goes well
with the nearby video game Toobin',
which transforms you into a "cool
dude" and sends you raftin' down the
river. Dude.

usually bustling and the most groans
and "yeahs" are emitted from it,
because people are not as embarrassed
to vocalize their excitement over a pool
game as they are about celebrating the
death of a simulated centipede.
Women especially scorn the video
game section of the arcade, calling it,
among other things, "unsanitary,"
"un-PC" and "full of geeks." Women
do, however, frequent the pool section
of the arcade, but the male-female
ratio is generally 5-1.
The video arcade, as pathetic as it
may look, is an excellent place to get
quarters for laundry. It also allows stu
dents to let off steam by killing people
between classes.
However, be warned that bringing a
pen and paper and taking notes on the
arcade games is not recommended
because it elicits such nervous ques
tions as, "Is this stuff going to be on
the final?" and such desperate pleas as,
"Please don't write my name down,
I'm not really in here!"

of the arcade, but the male-female
ratio is generally 5-1.
The video arcade, as pathetic as it
may look, is an excellent place to get
quarters for laundry. It also allows stu
dents to let off steam by killing people
between classes.
However, be warned that bringing a
pen and paper and taking notes on the
arcade games is not recommended
because it elicits such nervous ques
tions as, "Is this stuff going to be on
the final?" and such desperate pleas as,
"Please don't write my name down,
I'm not really in here!"

It is the story of a Utopia gone bad,
a place left in the dust by new trends
and technological breakthroughs.
The dark horse on the Farm, it is a
place you will never see pictured in any
of Stanford's sleek propaganda. It is a
room that will know no Centennial
joys.
Its surroundings offer it no solace,
but rather seem to call attention to its
decrepitude and obsolescence. "Ha
ha!" taunts the obnoxious Coffee
House, "Behold all these patrons pour
ing into me! Ahhh, so many quarters!"
And from the second floor, the
high-tech AlRport brags, "Ponder all
my megabytes! Witness all these peo
ple perched before my screens."
The Stanford Video Arcade is
indeed the black sheep of Tresidder
Memorial Student Union — and
maybe of the entire University.
"I am a loser!" it cries out, and that
sentiment is echoed by its archaic
video games, broken basketball-toss
machine and neglected candy
machines.
Students who enter the arcade
know they are associating with a loser.
They enter the room with their heads
bowed to the ground, apologetic
expressions on their faces.
These students, though they are
spending valuable time and money
senselessly shooting at centipedes or
furiously flapping silver balls with
bumpers, are no fools. As a clever rep
utation-preserving mechanism, they
enter the arcade in dirty clothes. That

way, in case anyone they know sees
them entering the spurned entertain
ment den, they can pull out a dollar
and explain, "Just getting quarters for
laundry!" Or perhaps they wear dirty
clothes to generate the necessary smell
so that potential onlookers will leave
them in peace as they obliterate gor
gons and save the Earth.
A cursory look at the video games
reveals severe neglect. A Star Wars
placard has somehow found its way to
the top of a Centipede game. Appro
priately, the Forgotten Worlds video
game has been condemned to eternal
solitude: "Out of order, play at your
own risk," says the sign above the
screen. Will anyone dare sneak a play
and fondle the knobs of "Forgotten
Worlds"? Yes, but they will be the same
people who stuck metal forks in elec
trical sockets as young children and,
due to a loosening of mental circuits,
have been toying with the forbidden
ever since.
A closer look at the games shows
an even more profound level of disre
gard. The game room, alas, is not mul
ticultural! Combatribes, a friendly
game of gang warfare, pits several
white gang members against one black
man — who is twice the size of the
largest white man.
The object of this racist game is to
punch or kick in the heads of the
opposing gangs members, while tak
ing care not to get flogged to death by
a chain or pancaked under a speeding
car. "Combatribes" is a favorite game
among students hailing from Los
Angeles and has been proven to cause
dangerous levels of aggression in labo

ratory rats.
Next to the gang-war fare game
stands NARC — Say No To Drugs.
This game, in which you "bust" people
by firing at them, was an inspiration of
the Nancy Reagan years and has not
yet been replaced by anything more

current, such as RADIOLOGIST -
This Screen is Emitting Cancerous
Levels of Radiation.
Moonwaiker, featuring Michael
Jackson, is perhaps the least-played
game and one that reveals just how
trendy the arcade was at one time. It is

the only one to feature a "DANCE"
button next to the "SHOOT" button,
for all those who want to do a celebra
tory jig after blowing someone up.
While this may sound warped, it looks
rather benign in animated, graphic
form.
Only those students of the Pac Man
generation will grace the aged
machines with their touch. Raised at a
time when placing a bow on a Pac Man
to form Ms. Pac Man was considered a
major technological breakthrough,
these people don't know any better.
They don't realize that video games
that don't simulate nuclear war, aren't
in 3-D and don't actually talk to you
(instead of just blipping and war
bling), are totally unacceptable to
younger and more hip game players.
While nobody has bothered to
raise the 25-cent price of the neglected
video games to keep up with inflation,
the pinball machines, standing at the
back of the room, now cost a whop
ping 50 cents. For many arcade
patrons, that's a good share of the
allowance they received as 12-year
olds, back in the good old days when
people didn't look at them and
exclaim, "Playing arcade games — at
your age?!"
The prize pinball machine is Dr.
Dude. The Doctor, who charges 50
cents for five balls, is depicted on the
front of the machine saying to his
voluptuous nurse, say "Ahhh-some." A
true California delight, it goes well
with the nearby video game Toobin',
which transforms you into a "cool
dude" and sends you raftin' down the
river. Dude.

Standing behind a food dispenser
that has eight of its 25 slots empty and
the other 17 filled with an unofficial

able foods," are a couple of pool tables
