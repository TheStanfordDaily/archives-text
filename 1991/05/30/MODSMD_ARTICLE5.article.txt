# Utilities manager helps halve water use

### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
University Utilities Manager David
Kaye doesn't want to be a wet rag.
In fact, he hasn't had to be one, as
substantial reductions in University
water usage have come with relative
ease and cooperation during his first
year in office.
As the official overseeing water con
servation, Kaye has managed to cut
usage in half since he came to Stanford
in April 1990.
That November, the University was
charged $303,000 for using 96,000 cubic
feet more than allotted by the San Fran
cisco Water District, which gets its
water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
near Yosemite.
Within six months, Kaye said he has

"turned this figure around 180
degrees," putting Stanford's water use
120,000 cubic feet under its allotment.
This change in consumption marks a
net reduction of 230,000 cubic feet, or
more than 172 million gallons. One
cubic foot of water equals about 748 gal
lons or 106 toilet flushes.
And on May 21, Kaye took the Uni
versity off of the well water it has hern
using since autumn quarter. "This was
perhaps the most welcome outcome of
these reductions," he said.
The well water was not only poor
tasting but it also created several other
problems, including calcification in hot
water heaters and impure water for
research experiments.
Originally from New York City, Kaye
said he found the concept of a drought
quite foreign, since he rarely encoun

tered uses for water other than drinking
and washing in his treeless Brooklyn
neighborhood. "You'd never see the lush
green landscapes that you see in front of
California homes," he said.
Hut the transition from asphalt to
acacia plants has not been an entirely
difficult one for Kaye, who left his post
as utilities manager at Yale University
after receiving a call from Stanford on a
cold, snowy day in New Haven, Conn.
Drought management sounded
"interesting and challenging, and the
weather was a plus, too," he said.
He added he has had to "learn by
necessity," doing extensive research,
talking with colleagues in water man
agement and attending several Bay Area
meetings regarding water issues.
