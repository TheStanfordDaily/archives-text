# Utilities manager helps halve water use
## 
### Jon Gifford Staff writer 
University Utilities Manager David
Kaye doesn't want to be a wet rag.
In fact, he hasn't had to be one, as
substantial reductions in University
water usage have come with relative
ease and cooperation during his first
year in office.
As the official overseeing water con
servation, Kaye has managed to cut
usage in half since he came to Stanford
in April 1990.
That November, the University was
charged $303,000 for using 96,000 cubic
feet more than allotted by the San Fran
cisco Water District, which gets its
water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
near Yosemite.
Within six months, Kaye said he has

"turned this figure around 180
degrees," putting Stanford's water use
120,000 cubic feet under its allotment.
This change in consumption marks a
net reduction of 230,000 cubic feet, or
more than 172 million gallons. One
cubic foot of water equals about 748 gal
lons or 106 toilet flushes.
And on May 21, Kaye took the Uni
versity off of the well water it has hern
using since autumn quarter. "This was
perhaps the most welcome outcome of
these reductions," he said.
The well water was not only poor
tasting but it also created several other
problems, including calcification in hot
water heaters and impure water for
research experiments.
Originally from New York City, Kaye
said he found the concept of a drought
quite foreign, since he rarely encoun

tered uses for water other than drinking
and washing in his treeless Brooklyn
neighborhood. "You'd never see the lush
green landscapes that you see in front of
California homes," he said.
Hut the transition from asphalt to
acacia plants has not been an entirely
difficult one for Kaye, who left his post
as utilities manager at Yale University
after receiving a call from Stanford on a
cold, snowy day in New Haven, Conn.
Drought management sounded
"interesting and challenging, and the
weather was a plus, too," he said.
He added he has had to "learn by
necessity," doing extensive research,
talking with colleagues in water man
agement and attending several Bay Area
meetings regarding water issues.

University Utilities Manager David Kaye has halved Stanford water usage since he
arrived here in April 1990.
Kaye, who used to only listen
in on these meetings, now takes
an active part in them. "After
going through this year, it has
been hard not to be well-schooled
in water resources management,"
Kaye said.
Despite his accomplishments,
Kaye doesn't believe he is the
source of the cuts in water usage.
He said the campus community is
responsible for the University's
success.
"You guys couldn't have
worked any harder to make me
look good," he said.
Kaye said the most successful
project has been the "Save Water
Now!" campaign, which chal
lenged the campus community to
seriously reduce its water con
sumption in preparation for a con
tinued drought this summer.
The program included general
public-awareness information and
a successful dormitory water
reduction competition.
Although research centers and
homeowners on campus al'e the
heaviest water users, student and
faculty reductions have greatly
helped the University save water,
said Kaye.
Many institutional changes
also made these cuts possible,
including a reduction in landscape
irrigation that will continue this
summer, the installation of water
meters at dormitories and dining
halls, and the retrofitting of
water-saving faucets.
A major change has been the
switch of the irrigation supply
from the San Francisco Water
District to Felt Lake, the Univer
sity-owned reservoir, Kaye said.
Kaye said he believes this
year's water reduction campaign
has been more, effective than
other University efforts because it
has been more "pro-active and
aggressive than previous years."
Earlies conservation efforts were
more public awareness-based, but
were not as intensive as this
year's campaign, he added.
He is proud but not boastful of

'I don't want to be a
hero. I just want to
take the campus
down to acceptable
water levels.'

the University's achievements
this year. "I don't want to be a
hero," he said. "I just want to take
the campus down to acceptable
water levels."
Kaye credits much of his suc
cess to an excellent staff that has
approached the drought problem
as a team.
"It has indeed been a challenge
to get to this point," said Kaye,
who in November received criti
cism for the University's over
consumption of water.
But even now we can't stop and
smell the roses, Kaye said.
He added that he has learned
that the first principle of drought
management is unpredictability.
"The problem with a drought is
that you don't know when you're
in one until you're really in one,"
he said. "And once you're in one,
you don't know when it will end."
For this reason, Kaye believes
that the campus must still be very
careful in the coming months
when water usage will reach its
peak. "Don't let your guard down,
folks," he warned.
Still, Kaye continues to strive
for improvement, planning to
keep summer levels the same as
that of May.
At 52 cents per cubic foot,
Stanford's 61,000 cubic feet of
water use for the May billing
period "is not exactly the $3.25
water bill that you receive at
home," Kaye said. Including ser
vice and meter charges, Stan
ford's water bill for the last 30-
day billing period was more than
$30,000.
Plans for this summer include
decreased landscaping, the possi
ble use of reclaimed water for irri
gation and the distribution of
water conservation packets to
homeowners on campus.
But water management is one
of onlv two major programs Kaye

plans to put forth to the student
community.
Next week, Kaye plans to chal
lenge the University to reduce its
electricity use by 1 to 2 percent of
its peak load, decreasing usage by
one million watts.
"It seems that if we've been
able reduce the University's thirst
for water, we can reduce the Uni
versity's thirst for energy," he
said.
He hopes to achieve this goal
by urging the community to
reduce its use of electrical lights,
to set air conditioner thermostats
to 78 degrees and to minimize hot
water use.
Going beyond the University
level, Kaye said he believes Cali
fornia could make many changes
that would allow for better water
management everywhere.
He foresees the state importing
more water, using ground water
more effectively and constructing
additional reservoirs in the com
ing years. He also believes that
California must look into desalin
ization and reclaimed water as
viable sources for the state's
water needs.
Furthermore, he sees land
scaping philosophy becoming
more creative, using plants native
to California and less water. Stan
ford is currently implementing
this new landscaping philosophy,
Kaye said.
After graduating from high
school, Kaye entered the U.S.
Army, where he served initially as
a power plant technician and later
joined the Officer Corps of Engi
neers, where he served until his
retirement from the Army in 1988
after nearly 25 years of service.
Stationed out of Fort Belvoir,
Va., Kaye traveled worldwide as
an officer, working in Europe, the
Far East, South East Asia and the
Arctic.
"During my tours, I never had
the experience of dealing with
drought conditions," said Kaye.
"The Army is pretty conservative
with its use of of water and
energy," he added, referring more
to his often-empty Army-issue
water bottle than to the condi
tions of the countries he visited.

to his often-empty Army-issue
water bottle than to the condi
tions of the countries he visited.
University Utilities Manager David
Kaye doesn't want to be a wet rag.
In fact, he hasn't had to be one, as
substantial reductions in University
water usage have come with relative
ease and cooperation during his first
year in office.
As the official overseeing water con
servation, Kaye has managed to cut
usage in half since he came to Stanford
in April 1990.
That November, the University was
charged $303,000 for using 96,000 cubic
feet more than allotted by the San Fran
cisco Water District, which gets its
water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
near Yosemite.
Within six months, Kaye said he has

"turned this figure around 180
degrees," putting Stanford's water use
120,000 cubic feet under its allotment.
This change in consumption marks a
net reduction of 230,000 cubic feet, or
more than 172 million gallons. One
cubic foot of water equals about 748 gal
lons or 106 toilet flushes.
And on May 21, Kaye took the Uni
versity off of the well water it has hern
using since autumn quarter. "This was
perhaps the most welcome outcome of
these reductions," he said.
The well water was not only poor
tasting but it also created several other
problems, including calcification in hot
water heaters and impure water for
research experiments.
Originally from New York City, Kaye
said he found the concept of a drought
quite foreign, since he rarely encoun

tered uses for water other than drinking
and washing in his treeless Brooklyn
neighborhood. "You'd never see the lush
green landscapes that you see in front of
California homes," he said.
Hut the transition from asphalt to
acacia plants has not been an entirely
difficult one for Kaye, who left his post
as utilities manager at Yale University
after receiving a call from Stanford on a
cold, snowy day in New Haven, Conn.
Drought management sounded
"interesting and challenging, and the
weather was a plus, too," he said.
He added he has had to "learn by
necessity," doing extensive research,
talking with colleagues in water man
agement and attending several Bay Area
meetings regarding water issues.


Chris Eisonberg — Dally
University Utilities Manager David Kaye has halved Stanford water usage since he
arrived here in April 1990.
Kaye, who used to only listen
in on these meetings, now takes
an active part in them. "After
going through this year, it has
been hard not to be well-schooled
in water resources management,"
Kaye said.
Despite his accomplishments,
Kaye doesn't believe he is the
source of the cuts in water usage.
He said the campus community is
responsible for the University's
success.
"You guys couldn't have
worked any harder to make me
look good," he said.
Kaye said the most successful
project has been the "Save Water
Now!" campaign, which chal
lenged the campus community to
seriously reduce its water con
sumption in preparation for a con
tinued drought this summer.
The program included general
public-awareness information and
a successful dormitory water
reduction competition.
Although research centers and
homeowners on campus al'e the
heaviest water users, student and
faculty reductions have greatly
helped the University save water,
said Kaye.
Many institutional changes
also made these cuts possible,
including a reduction in landscape
irrigation that will continue this
summer, the installation of water
meters at dormitories and dining
halls, and the retrofitting of
water-saving faucets.
A major change has been the
switch of the irrigation supply
from the San Francisco Water
District to Felt Lake, the Univer
sity-owned reservoir, Kaye said.
Kaye said he believes this
year's water reduction campaign
has been more, effective than
other University efforts because it
has been more "pro-active and
aggressive than previous years."
Earlies conservation efforts were
more public awareness-based, but
were not as intensive as this
year's campaign, he added.
He is proud but not boastful of

'I don't want to be a
hero. I just want to
take the campus
down to acceptable
water levels.'

the University's achievements
this year. "I don't want to be a
hero," he said. "I just want to take
the campus down to acceptable
water levels."
Kaye credits much of his suc
cess to an excellent staff that has
approached the drought problem
as a team.
"It has indeed been a challenge
to get to this point," said Kaye,
who in November received criti
cism for the University's over
consumption of water.
But even now we can't stop and
smell the roses, Kaye said.
He added that he has learned
that the first principle of drought
management is unpredictability.
"The problem with a drought is
that you don't know when you're
in one until you're really in one,"
he said. "And once you're in one,
you don't know when it will end."
For this reason, Kaye believes
that the campus must still be very
careful in the coming months
when water usage will reach its
peak. "Don't let your guard down,
folks," he warned.
Still, Kaye continues to strive
for improvement, planning to
keep summer levels the same as
that of May.
At 52 cents per cubic foot,
Stanford's 61,000 cubic feet of
water use for the May billing
period "is not exactly the $3.25
water bill that you receive at
home," Kaye said. Including ser
vice and meter charges, Stan
ford's water bill for the last 30-
day billing period was more than
$30,000.
Plans for this summer include
decreased landscaping, the possi
ble use of reclaimed water for irri
gation and the distribution of
water conservation packets to
homeowners on campus.
But water management is one
of onlv two major programs Kaye

plans to put forth to the student
community.
Next week, Kaye plans to chal
lenge the University to reduce its
electricity use by 1 to 2 percent of
its peak load, decreasing usage by
one million watts.
"It seems that if we've been
able reduce the University's thirst
for water, we can reduce the Uni
versity's thirst for energy," he
said.
He hopes to achieve this goal
by urging the community to
reduce its use of electrical lights,
to set air conditioner thermostats
to 78 degrees and to minimize hot
water use.
Going beyond the University
level, Kaye said he believes Cali
fornia could make many changes
that would allow for better water
management everywhere.
He foresees the state importing
more water, using ground water
more effectively and constructing
additional reservoirs in the com
ing years. He also believes that
California must look into desalin
ization and reclaimed water as
viable sources for the state's
water needs.
Furthermore, he sees land
scaping philosophy becoming
more creative, using plants native
to California and less water. Stan
ford is currently implementing
this new landscaping philosophy,
Kaye said.
After graduating from high
school, Kaye entered the U.S.
Army, where he served initially as
a power plant technician and later
joined the Officer Corps of Engi
neers, where he served until his
retirement from the Army in 1988
after nearly 25 years of service.
Stationed out of Fort Belvoir,
Va., Kaye traveled worldwide as
an officer, working in Europe, the
Far East, South East Asia and the
Arctic.
"During my tours, I never had
the experience of dealing with
drought conditions," said Kaye.
"The Army is pretty conservative
with its use of of water and
energy," he added, referring more
to his often-empty Army-issue
water bottle than to the condi
tions of the countries he visited.
