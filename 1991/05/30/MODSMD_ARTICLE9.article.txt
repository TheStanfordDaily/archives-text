Thousands of U.S. soldiers to be
put under German command
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — Defense Sec
retary Dick Cheney said yesterday that
NATO's sweeping reorganization will place
thousands of American soldiers in Europe in
corps under German, British and possibly Bel
gian command.
Under the plan, one of two U.S. combat divi
sions remaining in Europe will be placed in a
German-led corps, the first time American
forces at that strength will be under another
nation's leadership, U.S. officials said.
Cheney joined his colleagues in formally
unveiling plans for slimmer and more mobile
units under a new military strategy being
drawn up to reflect reduced East-West tensions
in the post-Cold War era.
Administration set to clear
barrier blocking aid to Soviets
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush adminis
tration has decided to extend the Soviet
Union's eligibility for bank and agricultural
credits for another year, U.S. officials disclosed
yesterday.
Unless Congress disapproves, which is con
sidered unlikely, the decision also could set the
stage for a new trade agreement with Moscow
and the lowering of trade barriers to Soviet
exports.
But the officials stressed the administration
had not decided whether to provide any of the
wide range of measures sought by President
Mikhail Gorbachev to assist his perestroika
program of reconstructing the staggering
Soviet economy.
Congress Party chooses Gandhi
loyalist as new party chief
NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The Congress
Party yesterday chose a Rajiv Gandhi loyalist
with decades of political experience to replace
the slain party chief.
PV Narasimha Rao, 69, a former foreign
minister, will guide the 106-vear-old party
through national elections, which were inter
rupted when Gandhi was assassinated last
week.
The elections, which are now scheduled to
be completed June 12 and 15, will decide which
party will govern the world's most populous
democracy for the next five years.
