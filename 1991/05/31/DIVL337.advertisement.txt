The world of political correctness is nothing like it was just
two short years ago. It's no longer as simple as Western Culture
vs. CIV, for or against the storming of University President Don
ald Kennedy's Bastille. Long gone are the days when you could
safely consider yourself PC just because you lived in Terra.
This week, just to demonstrate the complexity of today's PC
world, we are presenting several lists of topics that are being
argued about within the no longer so happy and unanimous PC
community, items that are troubling because they are PC, and
yet unPC.

We hope that these lists serve as a helpful guide to steer you
through these troubling times. Until next week, remember:
Political correctness is not what you say or what you do; it's how
you feel.
