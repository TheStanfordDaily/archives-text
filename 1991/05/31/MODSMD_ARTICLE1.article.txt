# 'Z' marks the spot
## SLAC sculpture is made of parts of the machine it commemorates

A century ago, Auguste
Rodin used bronze to cast "The
Gates of Hell." But through
the years, ideas about artistic
media and what constitutes
"art" have changed.
Stanford graduate Dana
Chodzko, with her sculpture,
"Beyond the Gates of Z," will
employ 500 pieces of steel sci
entific equipment to create the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center's own type of sculpture
garden â€” in the form a giant
letter Z in the hills near the
facility.
The shape and name of the
sculpture honor the labora
tory's goal over the last several
years of producing subatomic Z
particles.
The sculpture will measure
300 feet from top to bottom.
The three segments of the Z
will be a total of 800 feet long.
The highly sophisticated
equipment was used in the
installation of the 4,000-ton,
$60 million Stanford Large
Detector, which is designed to
find the particles. The sculp
ture will intersect in three
places a circular road leading
up to the device.
The detector will undergo
its first radiation tests today as
physicists begin to determine
what elements of the machine
must be fine-tuned before the
real research can begin in the
fall.
The 200-300 tons of equip
ment were left in the brush in
the hills after construction
ended. But the pieces could be
used again if repairs are needed
for the detector, said SLAC
physicist Richard Zdarko, who
has been working on the detec
tor for five years and is primar
ily responsible for making the
sculpture idea a reality.

The linear, colossal sculp
ture is an artistic solution to a
very real problem: SLAC lacks
adequate storage space for
equipment that is not cur
rently in use but may be
needed in the future.
The pieces could be removed
temporarily and replaced, or if
they must be used perma
nently, the sculpture could be
rearranged, Chodzko said.
Although some of the pieces
cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars to build, their current
market value as scrap metal is
three cents a pound.
Zdarko said it is not likely
the pieces will be needed again,
but if they are, "the savings
would be incredible."
He collaborated on the idea
with the 150 physicists who
work at the detector. He said
SLAC officials told him they
did not want "junk" to be
placed in the garden, but only
valuable equipment that
should be preserved.
Chodzko was the first artist
in mind for the project, said
Mona Duggan, an administra
tor in the Art Department who
is on the project's advisory
board.
An experienced environ
mental artist, Chodzko gradu
ated from Stanford in 1989
with a master's in fine arts.
Duggan called her "one of the
most talented graduates" of
the fine arts program, who
"has developed a strong con
cept into a visually beautiful
and compelling work of art."
Chodzko, 39, said she came
up with the idea for the Z shape
when she attended a party
along with a number of physi
cists.
At the party, she wore a
jacket with a symbol painted on
the back that looked like a Z.
