# Bush attacks Democrats' civil rights bill

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush led a stepped-up administration
attack yesterday on the Democrats'
latest attempt to write a civil rights
bill, charging it would encourage racial
discord and hiring quotas.
His attack drew an angry response
from supporters of the bill. House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said
Bush's own presidential campaign had
"sowed the seeds of racial discord."
"Let's start over. Let's make har
mony our goal," Bush told a new class
of FBI special agents at the FBI
National Academy in Quantico, Va.
"Congressional leaders again want
to pass a bill that would lead employers
to adopt hiring quotas and unfair job
practices," said Bush.
The administration's attack came
as Democratic House leaders contin
ued to revise their bill in private nego

tiations with wavering Democratic and
Republican members in an effort to
achieve the maximum vote possible.
In his response to the administra
tion's attack, Gephardt, D-Mo., said
Bush had exploited racial divisions for
political gain in his 1988 campaign, in
his veto of a similar civil rights bill last
year, and in pressuring business leaders
to back away from any compromise with
Democrats on a rights bill this year.
"This is the first president in the
civil rights era who wants to tear us
apart for political gain," Gephardt said.
"Let the president explain how a bill
that outlaws quotas is a quota bill."
Ralph Neas, executive director of
the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, said Bush's remarks "are
almost Orwellian. His assertions turn
the truth upside down."
"There's no way to satisfy the

White House or the Department of
Justice because they are hell-bent on
preventing a strong civil rights bill
from being enacted into law. ... The
White House wants a political issue to
demagogue," Neas said.
The bill is designed to reverse the
effects of a series of Supreme Court rul
ings that have increased the burdens of
proof on plaintiffs in suits charging job
discrimination. In addition, the bill is
intended to expand the rights of women
and others to collect damages.
Bush, in his speech, said supporters
of the Democratic House leadership's
bill "boast their approach makes it eas
ier to prosecute and sue people. Well,
frankly, this is hardly the road to racial
harmony. It's the road to lawsuits and
discord."
House Democrats made still more
adjustments to technical, legal parts of

their bill in an attempt to attract the
support of undecided Democrats, most
from the South and Midwest, and
Republicans.
But as they made concessions to
maximize support, the Democratic
leaders faced revolts from members of
the Congressional Black Caucus and
some women members.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,
and several other women Democrats,
strongly oppose a provision in the lat
est Democratic version that places a
limit on monetary damages that
women and the disabled may receive in
job discrimination suits. Victims of
racial discrimination would still be eli
gible for unlimited damages.
The limit would be $150,000 or the
amount of compensatory damages,
whichever is greater.
