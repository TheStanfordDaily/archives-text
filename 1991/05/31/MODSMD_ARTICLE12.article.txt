ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) â€” The new rebel
government of Ethiopia put down more protests yes
terday by firing on demonstrators, and a number of
ranking officials of the old regime gave themselves
up for possible trial.
At least two people were killed in three demon
strations against what is widely seen in Addis Ababa
as a sellout of the old government by the United
States. Several people also were injured.
Radio Ethiopia, under rebel control, said a large
number of former ranking officials had surrendered
to the new government and would be held for possi
ble trial.
The rebels had been widely rumored for months
to have an execution list of officials of the regime of
former Marxist President Mengistu Haile Mariam,
starting with Mengistu himself.
But in a radio broadcast Wednesday, the rebels
denied they were seeking revenge and said it would
be "up to the people to decide whether these people
should be tried."
Yesterday's demonstrations began in the morning
when crowds of several hundred, mostly young peo
ple chanting anti-American slogans, gathered near
the Defense Ministry, Mexico Square and Revolu
tionary Square.
Soldiers of the rebel govenrnment quickly scat
tered them with gunfire that reporters and photog
raphers said was aimed directly at the protesters.
The demonstrations took place despite a ban on
all protests announced Wednesday during a day of
violent protests, some aimed at the U.S. Embassy.
