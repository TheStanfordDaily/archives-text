Multicultural goals still
worth seeking; don't let
backlash expunge them

THE LAST THING Stanford
needs is a backlash against
multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism at Stanford is
at a standstill. Proponents of mul
ticulturalism have been quiet this
year, intimidated by what students
understand to be a reaction. Stu
dent discussion of the issues sur
rounding Stanford's racial diver
sity is all but nonexistent.
It doesn't have to be that way.
Multiculturalism can — and
should be — a movement that
unites, rather than divides, the
student body.
Its goals — the uniting of a
racially diverse society around an
ethos that values human differ
ences and a structure that pro
motes equality of educational
opportunity — are hard to ques
tion. What has attracted opposi
tion has been the means its enthu
siasts at Stanford have used in
recent years.
The multiculturalism of the past
few years alienated many students
because it emphasized empower
ment of minority groups at the
expense of community.
All too often, campus political
leaders gave the impression they
were less eager to build a multira
cial campus community than to
institutionalize their own political
agenda. Events like the takeover of
University President Donald
Kennedy's office drove many mod
erate students into the anti-multi
cultural camp.
To regain widespread support,
multiculturalism will have to focus
on the people — all the people —
who make up the Stanford commu

nity. While continuing to celebrate
difference, the movement must
begin to emphasize the community
it seeks to bring together.
Multiculturalism must also go
beyond its focus on race to a cele
bration of difference of all kinds,
emphasizing that we're each the
product of a distinct background
and can all benefit from the cele
bration of difference.
Proponents of multiculturalism
must re-examine their emphasis
on confrontation. They'll have to
realize that confrontational poli
tics, while successful at garnering
headlines, rarely garner converts.
Multiculturalism's enthusiasts
should begin to raise issues and
spark discussion in a more open,
less confrontational way.
They'll also have to recognize
that they don't have a monopoly on
truth, that dissenters have equally
valid beliefs and that debate on
multiculturalism at Stanford must
take the form not of a rally of the
most vocal, but of a dialogue
among those who hold different
visions for a multiracial society.
Multiculturalism will be most
successful when it is least strident,
when its goal is not to proselytize
but to persuade.
The enormous majority of stu
dents haven't quite decided what
to think about multiculturalism.
They've joined the ranks of the
temporarily turned-off.
Most can be won back, thought
especially if the movement adopts a
more personal, more positive tone.
It's far too early to give up on a
movement that will help students
at Stanford come to terms with one
of the most important issues of the
next century.
And it's far too early to give up
on the multicultural vision — one
of an interactive, multiracial com
munity of students, faculty and
staff who view their community's
diversity as a unique asset.
