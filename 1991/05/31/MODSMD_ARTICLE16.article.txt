## Overthinkers anonymous

WE ARE WEIRD. (And you thought
we didn't notice!) Many of you
may want to know why we are
the way we are. You may be asking your
selves, "If I were at the Super Bowl and
did not know what Kofi and Andy looked
like, how could I pick them out of the
crowd?"
The K and A Guide to Spotting
Overthinkers
Spotting an Overthinker is not as diffi
cult as one might think. Admittedly,
thinking is not an easily noticeable activ
ity (particularly at Stanford). Over
thinkers, however, think so much that
their actions are severely warped.
1) They write columns; 2) They will
have an experience, analyze it and then
analyze their analysis of it, etc.; 3) They
will be Pathetic — you really gotta work
at it to be that pathetic; 4) They will be
Intellectual Punks — how many normal
people associate Marxism with flatula
tion?; 5) They will take SLE and enjoy it;
and 6) They will discuss everything in
terms of archetypes.
Ah, the archetype, that is the rub.
What is it; why do we use it?
Columnists writing alone can relate
their personal experiences in order to con
vey their message. Readers, in order to
associate and identify with the experi
ences of the columnist, form a generality
that they can apply to themselves and
others.
Ed Heinemann describes his feelings
upon meeting a homeless woman. The
reader generalizes this experience to be
that of the "Sheltered Stanford Student
Seeing Society." Readers then find some

personal experience that also fits under
the generality. They then compare their
experience with Ed's and make certain
judgments about Ed, the human situa
tion and themselves.
Writing a column with another person,
however, makes this method impossible. We
can't write about our reactions to particular
situations, events or issues. Just think of
how stilted every column would sound if we
wrote, "We felt and thought..
Since we cannot reasonably discuss
our experiences as the experience of one
person, we relate the generality in our
columns. When the experience is human
behavior, the generalized version is an
archetype, (e.g., The Pathetic Guy, The
Intellectual Punk, etc.) When the experi
ence is a particular situation, we create a
caricature. (Intellectual Guerrilla War
fare, The Frosh Dorm, The Stanford
Social Scene, etc.) When we write about
our reactions, we are actually discussing
our general reactions to patterns of
behavior or common situations.
These generalities were produced by
many long hours of discussion, some of
which have gone on for the past two
years. Not counting this "friendship
time" we figure that it took us over 15
hours to write each and every column.
Ed's narratives have clocked in at under
two hours on various occasions. Tim
Marklein needs less time because he can
just copy old speeches from last year's
Council of Presidents election. Maurits,
however, spends almost as much time on
every column as we do. After all, he has to
translate everything from Netherlandish.
Although this method requires much

more time and effort, we retain the power
to create the generalization. We lock you
into seeing only the generalization we see.
The drawback, however, is that our
columns may alienate those who would
make different generalizations about the
behavior we discuss.
Some people see "Pathetic Guy"
behavior as "Wimp" behavior regardless
of our intentions. Some have incorrectly
asserted that these generalizations/
archetypes are just fancy names for
stereotypes. We are fully conscious of the
fact that they do not completely describe
any individual.
For us, archetypes are simply personi
fied behavior patterns. To say the Intel
lectual Punk or the Pathetic Guy is
within us is to say that we periodically
exhibit that behavior. Archetypes are not
meant to be restrictive — they should not
represent people or groups.
Our unifying message in each column
and each archetype is that there are cer
tain behavioral patterns and situations
that are common to us all. By communi
cating, we create generalities that give us
all a common ground that we can apply to
ourselves and others. Many times, this
common ground is also a place where we
can come together and laugh — maybe
even laugh at ourselves.

Kofi and Andy's column has appeared
every Friday.
