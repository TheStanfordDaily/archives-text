## Richard Holeton Stanford's drug and alcohol policy: learning lessons 
### 
CASE 1: SEVERAL WEEKS AGO,
two freshmen, returning late one
night from a party on the other
side of campus, were arrested for public
drunkenness fewer than 50 yards from
their dormitory. They weren't yelling or
behaving wildly; they did not provoke
any complaints; one student was helping
the other walk, and a third resident of
the same dormitory accompanied them
but was not arrested.
Case 2: On another late-night occa
sion this year, several students were
drunkenly and noisily climbing statues
far from their dorm, creating both a nui
sance and a danger to themselves. A
police officer told them to climb down
and go home.
Conclusion: Alcohol laws are enforced
inconsistently on the Stanford campus.
Possible conclusion from many other
accounts similar to Case 1: Alcohol
related cases are being enforced more
rigorously since Stanford was "forced" to
adopt a new alcohol policy in response to
federal legislation.
Case 3: A senior lecturer in computer
science was fired for not preventing alco
hol from being served to some underage
undergraduates at a local, off-campus
restaurant and for being suspected of
carrying illegal substances in his back
pack — alleged violations of the Univer
sity drug and alcohol policy.
Case 4: Every night on the Stanford
campus, in every residence, the alcohol
policy is violated on a much larger scale
and much more blatantly than in Case 3
by students, faculty members and resi
dence staff.
Possible conclusions: l)lt's okay to
violate the alcohol policy if you don't tell
people about it and don't get caught;
2)lt's OK to violate the alcohol policy if
you're a member of the Academic Coun
cil, rather than a student or a lecturer;
and 3)To prove the alcohol policy has
teeth and, in the case of the students, to
prove alcohol laws will be enforced, some

people must be made examples of.
Prediction: Next year, or maybe the
year after, some unlucky resident assis
tant — or possibly a resident fellow who
is not a tenured faculty member — will
be "caught" technically violating the
alcohol policy and will be hung out to
dry. Everyone will say that it was a
shame, since the RA or RF was only
doing what most of the other RAs and
RFs do most of the time — finding some
compromise between an unworkable pol
icy and reality.
The lecturer in Case 3 — whom the
Stanford community recognizes as Stu
art Reges — although lacking the protec
tion of the Academic Council, has been
able and even anxious to speak up in his
own defense. Who will speak up on
behalf of the two 18-year-old freshmen
who were handcuffed and sent to North
County Jail for walking home (one,
granted, not very steadily) after a party?
Neither the University administration
nor the police will, to be sure; I asked
representatives of both about the cases
described above.
The University's standard response is
that police matters are police matters,
pure and simple — none of our business.
Yet University officials seek and receive
information (from the police blotter,
which is made available to public media)
about arrested students and then apply
separate, additional punishments to
offenders. Evidently, then, police matters
are also University matters, according to
the new alcohol policy and the federal
legislation that compelled it.
A second component of the standard
answer, offered by both the University
and the police, is: "The University is not
a sanctuary from the law." This was also
part of the old alcohol policy, now
referred to almost nostalgically by every
one. Officials emphasize the campus has
never been such a sanctuary — as if
things haven't changed a bit over the
years, and as if enforcement of alcohol

and drug laws has always been and
remains today totally consistent.
Furthermore, according to these offi
cials, Stanford students will not be "cod
dled" or treated specially by virtue of
their privileged social status; they will be
subject to the same standards as the rest
of the community.
Will anyone seriously argue that a
Palo Alto resident, having drunk too
much, having walked to within 50 yards
of his or her home and being assisted by
two friends, would receive this same
treatment from police? Palo Alto resi
dents are not routinely cuffed and
thrown in jail under these circum
stances.
Perhaps the community standards to
which officials refer are those applied to
residents of East Palo Alto, who may be
thrown in jail under a large variety of
circumstances, near or far from their
homes. Just how drunk was the second
freshman arrested in Case 1, who had
essentially carried his inebriated friend
most of the way across campus? No
blood or Breathalyzer test was adminis
tered; on the other hand, the second stu
dent was a person of color who doesn't
fit the typical Stanford socioeconomic
profile and whom the arresting officer
said he "remembered."
According to the police, the arrested
students posed a potential danger to
themselves or others by virtue of being
drunk; the arresting officer would have
been liable if something bad had hap
pened later that night as a result of his
leniency. This is supposedly standard
police practice. We all know, of course, of
many similar cases when police have not
made arrests, as in Case 2 above. Like
other professionals, then, the police
make judgment calls. Just how these
calls are being made I urge the Stanford
community to observe and to question.
What about the judgment shown by
the students in Case 1? At least one stu
dent showed the bad judgment to get

drunk in the first place (among college
students, hardly a historic decision). Hut
once having made the poor decision to
drink too much, what judgment did they
make next? Heeding the advice they'd
received from their RAs, RFs and fellow
residents, they decided to go home, on
foot; they stuck together and took care of
each other to make sure they got home
safely and directly.
Do people who have made this series
of corrective decisions pose a threat to
themselves or others? How likely is it
that students who have independently
decided to go home in these circum
stances, at 2 a.m., will go back out to
party some more? Especially after the
scare of being caught and warned by a
police officer?
A final component of the standard
answer given by both University and
police officials is that students who get
caught and arrested are taught a lesson.
What "lessons" were learned by these
students? Here are a few: Laws are
enforced unfairly and often randomly; if
you drink too much, don't go straight
home, or, if you do, don't walk out in the
open where anyone can see you; taking
care of your drunk friend can get you
arrested, too.
Surely we can do better than this,
even with an alcohol policy no one seems
to like very much. In any case, the Stan
ford community should not be satisfied
with the "standard answer." It's the
defensive answer of a funding-frightened
bureaucracy. It's a preemptive strike
against thoughtful criticism of Univer
sity policy and police practices. To prove
compliance with government policy, it's
the company line in a place where ideas
are supposed to be challenged and
debated and where students are sup
posed to be educated, not punished.

Richard Holeton is resident fellow in
