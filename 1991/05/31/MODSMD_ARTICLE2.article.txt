# Group fills void for Caribbean students

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Upon arriving at Stanford last
year, Donna Espeut thought she
had the college jitters licked.
A student of Jamaican descent
who grew up in Florida, she never
anticipated the feelings of incom
pleteness, culture shock and
depression she felt during her
freshman year at Stanford.
Espeut's anxieties were natu
ral â€” typically experienced by
many freshmen, transfer students
and international students. But
the University's lack of a formal
network or support group
acknowledging Caribbean stu
dents exacerbated her concerns,
she said.
She added that she felt as if she
were awash in Stanford's wave of
multiculturalism. "I felt like I was
hanging on for my dear life," said

Espeut, now a sophomore. "I
didn't know what to do."
But after two years of battling
anxieties and discovering
Caribbean students with similar
uneasiness here, Espeut this
spring started the Caribbean Stu
dents Association.
Through cultural and social
events slated for next year, the
organization hopes to share the
customs of Caribbean people with
the Stanford community.
"We want to add a new dimen
sion to multiculturalism," she
explained in a Jamaican accent.
"Our goal is to bring together the
Caribbean students and unite
[them| with other campus com
munities."
Just less than one month old,
the organization has already
attracted from 20 to 30 students
