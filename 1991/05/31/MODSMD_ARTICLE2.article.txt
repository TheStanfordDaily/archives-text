# Group fills void for Caribbean students
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Upon arriving at Stanford last
year, Donna Espeut thought she
had the college jitters licked.
A student of Jamaican descent
who grew up in Florida, she never
anticipated the feelings of incom
pleteness, culture shock and
depression she felt during her
freshman year at Stanford.
Espeut's anxieties were natu
ral — typically experienced by
many freshmen, transfer students
and international students. But
the University's lack of a formal
network or support group
acknowledging Caribbean stu
dents exacerbated her concerns,
she said.
She added that she felt as if she
were awash in Stanford's wave of
multiculturalism. "I felt like I was
hanging on for my dear life," said

Espeut, now a sophomore. "I
didn't know what to do."
But after two years of battling
anxieties and discovering
Caribbean students with similar
uneasiness here, Espeut this
spring started the Caribbean Stu
dents Association.
Through cultural and social
events slated for next year, the
organization hopes to share the
customs of Caribbean people with
the Stanford community.
"We want to add a new dimen
sion to multiculturalism," she
explained in a Jamaican accent.
"Our goal is to bring together the
Caribbean students and unite
[them| with other campus com
munities."
Just less than one month old,
the organization has already
attracted from 20 to 30 students
from the graduate and undergrad
uate ranks.
Stanford has about 24 students
from the Caribbean, said John
Pearson, director of Bechtel Inter
national Center. Considering the
number of Caribbean students
with U.S. citizenship or who come
from families with established
roots in this country, that number
could be larger, he said.
Spanish and Portuguese Prof.
Sylvia Wynter said the oversight
of issues pertaining to Caribbean
students, while probably uninten
tional, is understandable.
"It is an issue of classification,"
she said. "There is North Amer
ica, South America and Central
America. The region of the
Caribbean covers so much and the
culture is so penetrating that it
gets overlooked."
For this reason, some U.S. stu
dents need educating on that part
of the world and the people who
live there, Espeut said.
"Many people are ignorant of
culture other than pop culture,"
she added. "I have run into people
who thought Jamaica was just off
the coast of Mexico."
Jamaica and the other coun
tries of the Caribbean form an
archipelago of island nations
along a tropical band located

between North and South Amer
ica.
The English-speaking part of
the Caribbean, known as the West
Indies, is the nucleus of the
Caribbean and consists of Jamaica
and the Bahamas, among others.
Other Caribbean countries Cari
bbean include Haiti, Cuba, the
Dominican Republic and Trinidad
and Tobago.
The region also features a
blend of people of Asian, Indian,
European and African descent.
Espeut said Americans need to
realize that island natives are not
all "Hey mon"-spouting islanders
with dreadlocks and steel drums
who spend days lounging about on
pristine beaches.
"For many students, this orga
nization will play a positive role,"
said Wynter, herself a native of
Jamaica.
Wynter said the voice of
Caribbean students that the orga
nization will provide will make
others realize the diversity of
African peoples.
But the greatest benefit of the
student group, which has received
support from the Black Student
Union and approval from the
ASSU, will go to the Caribbean
students, not all of whom are
black.
"We are trying to embrace
Caribbean culture at a place far
from the source," said Sophia
Williams, a Jamaican graduate
student in operations research.
