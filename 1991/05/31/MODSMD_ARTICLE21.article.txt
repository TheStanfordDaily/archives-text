## Gaines, Mastalir streak forward at NCAA track 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
Everyone is still alive.
On another blustery afternoon
in Oregon, Stanford track stars
shone as the NCAA Champi
onships moved into its second day
of competition.
Junior Chryste Gaines ran the
fastest qualifying time in the
heats of the 100 meters. Her
wind-aided 11.10 seconds is a life
time best.
Her previous best was an 11.28
set at the Longhorn Invitational
three weeks ago. She copied that
mark when she won the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in the
event.
"She felt real good about [her
race yesterday]," said asst. coach
Scott Chisam.
Texas' Carlette Guidry, the
NCAA Indoor champ over 60
meters, won the first heat with an
11.20. Her tailwind was measured
at 4.31 meters per second, com
pared to Gaines' 2.60 meter per
second gust.
The second heat was won by
LSU's Esther Jones in a time of
11.19 seconds. The wind at her
back was 2.42.
Then it was the Cardinal
sprinter's turn to shine. By run
ning nearly two-tenths of a second
faster than she ever had Gaines
sent notice to the rest of the field
that she is peaking at the right

time and is ready to bring home a
national championship.
Racing on neutral turf helped
Gaines according to Chisam.
"She's run against [Guidry and
Jones] before but it's usually been
in Texas."
Also gunning for an NCAA title
is senior Mark Mastalir. He quali
fied for the 1,500 final with a
semifinal time of 3:43.46.
He placed fifth in his section
but ran five seconds faster than
Washington State's Samuel
Kibiri, who won his heat. Kibiri,
the Pac-10 Champion, joins
Mastalir and 10 others in Satur
day's final.
"Mark ran a very smart race.
He lead most of the way and made
sure it was a fast enough heat,"
Chisam said.
One person who won't be join
ing them in the finals is 1990
NCAA champion Bob Kennedy.
The Indiana star finished fifth
in his section but did not make the
finals because his heat, which
Kibiri ran in, was much slower
than the second. Four athletes
survived Kennedy's section while
eight made it from Mastalir's
heat.
Four Stanford athletes are in
finals today. Jackie Edwards, who
had the second best qualifying
leap in the long jump, will try to
be the first Cardinal competitor
since 1984 to win a national
crown.

'Mark ran a very
smart race. He lead
most of the way and
made sure it was a
fast enough heat.'

That year PattiSue Plumer
won the 5,000 and Carol Cady
took top honors in the discus.
Senior Debbie Malueg gets her
shot at the discus title this
evening. The favorites to win
include a talented trio from
UCLA.
Defending NCAA champion
Tracie Millett leads the Bruin con
tingent. Joining her are freshmen
Dawn Dumble and Melisa Weis.
Marcus Hickerson is in the
long jump finals and All-American
Dave Strang races in the 800.
Chryste Gaines runs semifinals
in the 100 and 200 today. She is
expected to move on to the Satur
day's finals in both events.
Mastalir also takes a shot at an
NCAA title Saturday.
Washington State and Ten
nessee are expected to battle it out
for the men's team title. The
women's crown will probably
come down to UCLA, Oregon,
LSU and Texas. The top eight fin
ishers in each event score team
points on a 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis.
