"Time has come for this mutt to take
leave of Stanford, to stray away from the
water dish and go explore the rest of the
backyard."
— Jon Weisman, sports columnist
The Stanford Daily, June 7, 1989
Every dog does indeed have his day,
but it's high time for the sun to go
down on mine.
The light started to fade almost three
months ago, as I stood in the Maples
Pavilion press box and applauded the
men's basketball team's four seniors
before their final home game. (Don't
cheer in the press box, dammit!! Oh, shut
up.) It was a thought that came and left
quickly, a thought I'd been trying my
hardest to avoid:
You will never do this again.
My first reaction, like any semi-ratio
nal human, was to tell the thought to get
the hell out of my head so I could enjoy —
er, report on — the game. My second reac
tion, after thinking about it for awhile,
was to wonder why the thought bothered
me. And today, three months later, I still
don't have an answer.
Why are we so afraid to say goodbye?
It's not like life is over after we graduate,
is it?
Don't answer that.
Maybe we're scared because we've
been told (ad nauseum) that college is the
best four years of our lives. Maybe we're
scared because we don't think we'll ever
have friends as good as the ones we have
now.
Or maybe we're scared because we're
stupid. Look, if you really want to pass
the next 60 years thinking about how fun
life used to be, feel free. As for me, I'm not
going to spend three-fourths of my time
on this planet feeling sad that my "after"

life doesn't compare to my time spent at
Stanford.
In fact, if that thought even remotely
crosses my mind, that'll be a pretty good
sign it's time to change whatever it is I'm
doing.
Besides, when you get right ®swn to
it, I'll never completely leave.
Everything that I've seen, all the
places I've visited and all the people I've
met will stay with me in the back of my
mind, in a little corner of time and space
that I can visit whenever I want. Whether
it's a week from now, 20 years from now
or when I spend most of my time in a
rocking chair, I'll be able to visit that spot,
and I'll remember . . .
... in some small corner of the uni
verse, the time is always spring 1989, and
the Stanford men's tennis team is gearing
up for yet another national title. Barry
Richards is still a machine at No. 6, drop
ping only two regular-season matches.
Glenn Solomon is still the heart of the
team, gutting out a 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 win at
fifth singles in a thrashing of then-No. 1
UCLA, to go along with his several other
heart-stopping wins.
And, only a few weeks later, freshman
Alex O'Brien is once again leading the
Cardinal to its second straight NCAA
crown in Athens, Ga. O'Brien, one more
time, loses no sets in his four singles

matches — and drops exactly one service
game the entire week . . .
. . . while, in another corner not. very
far away, the Stanford baseball team lives
the 1990 season again and again. Fresh
man Jeff Hammonds is still tearing his
way to a school-record 48 steals, still
cruising to a school- and league-record
37-game hitting streak. Roger Burnett,
once again, is playing shortstop like he
invented the position, making dives and
throws that just should not happen.
Paul Carey still hits homers — more,
in his four years as Stanford's greatest
outfielder, than anyone in league history.
Stan Spencer and Mike Mussina, once
again, both tie the school record for sin
gle-season wins with 14 each.
On and on it goes, all the way to
Omaha and the semifinals of the College
World Series. And there, one more time,
there are two outs in the ninth, the score
is 5-1 Georgia and the Cardinal has two
men on. I'm still watching from the
stands as Burnett stands at the plate with
two strikes, and I'm thinking — hoping
— that he'll get on, because then Tim
Griffin will get to bat and I know that
he'll break out of his postseason slump
with a homer to tie it up and we'll win in
the 10th and be in the final and then
But no. The third strike is called, as it
always is — It was outside!! It was a foot
outside!! — and, after one final team
meeting, Carey stands alone in the out
field, his face in his hands — not wanting
to believe his career is over one game
early. . .
. . . and, in another — happier — little
corner of the universe, it's always the
night of March 27, 1991. The Stanford
men's basketball team, led by Andrew
Vlahov — who, for six long, painful reha
bilitative weeks told his injured ankle
that there was no way his career was over

— is in the finals of the National Invita
tion Tournament.
And, one more time, everything works
the way it had for two beautiful weeks,
the way it was supposed to have worked
all season: Passes are crisp; picks are dev
astating; three-pointers are money;
rebounds run yelping to the Cardinal . . .
and the first men's national title in 49
years at last, at last, makes it back to
Maples.
The next afternoon, after a night of
much celebrating and little sleep, as the
team pulls into the parking lot one more
time — as several hundred fans let
Andrew, Adam, Kepny, John,
Marcus how, they
feel — I think how ridiculously lucky I
was to see everything I did.
There are other small corners: Some
where it is still April 1990, and Sonja Hen
ning smiles after scoring 21 points against
Auburn to lead the women's hoops team
to its first NCAA title. Somewhere it is
still February 1988, and Todd Lichti
jumps into Howard Wright's arms at the
end of "Stanford stuns No. 1 Arizona."
Somewhere it is still November 1990,
the water polo team has lost to Cal in the
NCAA finals — and four seniors choke
back tears after becoming the the first
Cardinal players in 15 years to graduate
without NCAA championship rings. And
somewhere, always and always, Kylie
Johnson, flashing the greatest victory
smile ever, clinches the women's tennis
team's sixth straight NCAA title at home.
And, in all those small corners, I'm
watching — and cheering — and smiling.
To the players, coaches and man
agers of the 1989 NCAA champion
men's tennis team, the 1990 Six-
Pac champion baseball team (a team that
was, is and always will be the best in col

lego history) and the 1991 NIT champion
men's basketball team: Thank you for
making this job so much fun.
To The Daily: Thanks for sending me
to Los Angeles (nine times), Athens (Ga.),
Tucson (twice), Tempe (twice), Omaha
during finals, Pullman, Seattle, Madison
(Wis.), Carbondale (111.), New York and
the bottom of the Grand Canyon. And,
yes, most of the receipts I turned in were
authentic.
To the Radio Guys: Thanks for sharing
a fantastic baseball season with me.
To Crader and Rogo: Thanks for stick
ing around.
To KZSU's Brian "Nice nickname, f
—l" Webber: Why are we stupid? — and
thanks for sharing all the trips from hell.
To Mom and Dad, thanks for letting
me come here; to Chris, thanks for always
bringing me down to earth; and to every
one who's ever read anything I've writ
ten, whether you thought it was beautiful
or thought it. was crap: Thank you for
reading. And remember, when it comes
time for you to leave this place . . .
. . . somewhere, in some small corner of
the universe, the sun always shines on
Sunken Diamond; somewhere, in some
small corner of the universe, the Band always
plays and the Dollies always dance . . .
. . . and somewhere, in some small cor
ner of the universe that you can visit any
time you want, the score is always Stan
ford 27, California 25. The ball clears the
uprights over and over and over again;
thousands of kids still dance on the field;
thousands of kids still hug everyone they
see for hours and hours . . .
. . . and, in that same small some
where, I'm still laughing; I'm still crying;
and, again and again, I'm still thanking
Whoever's in charge for letting me be a
part of it all.
Goodbve.
