# McCarty named player of the year; AD list down to two
## 
### 
In the world of collegiate baseball, Stan
ford has become synonomous with success.
The University has produced two NCAA
titles, numerous Ail-Americans and six cur
rent Major Leaguers.
But despite the large number of great
players who have been on the Farm, Stan
ford had never had the nation's best player.
Until yesterday.
As was reported in The Daily earlier this
week, junior David McCarty is the 1991
Baseball America Player of the Year. The
announcement came yesterday in Omaha,
Neb., where the College World Series begins
today.
The first baseman certainly deserved the
award. McCarty hit .420 with 24 home
runs, 66 RBI and an unreal .828 slugging
percentage in leading the Cardinal to a 39-
23 record. Sources at the magazine said
McCarty edged USC outfielder Mark Smith
and Fresno State pitcher Bobby Jones (the
Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year), for
the award.
"David had an unbelievable year," Cardi
nal coach Mark Marquess said. "He has the
ability to hit for power and average, and
that's what makes him such a great player.
His numbers speak for themselves. We've
had some great players at Stanford, but
David's season in 1991 has to rank as one of
the best of all time."
When McCarty graduated from Sharp
stown High School in Houston he was not
selected in the Major League draft. Monday,
however, the junior will almost certainly go
in the first round. He has not announced if
he will return for his senior season, but due
to his likely position in the draft, he will
probably not be back.
McCarty hit .297 as a freshman and .336
last year before becoming the nation's most
feared hitter. He spent last summer leading

the U.S. National team in batting and
posted a 26-game hitting streak this year.
At one point he hit six home runs in four
days against conference rivals.
"He got better and better and better,"
Baseball America editor Allan Simpson
said. "When you combine his statistics with
the fact that he played in what probably
still is the nation's top conference and he
played superb first base and showed great
intelligence, it added up that he should be
Player of the Year."
McCarty led the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division in home runs, batting
average and slugging percentage. Addition
ally he led the team in RBI, hits, runs,
walks, on-base percentage and total bases.
His career fielding percentage is .991.
Collegiate Baseball named McCarty
their first-team All-America first baseman
earlier in the week. Classmate Roger Bur
nett, who also played on the U.S. team last
summer, was named a third-team All-
American at shortstop.
Stanford advanced to the postseason for
the 10th time in 11 years this season. The
Cardinal went 2-2 in the West II Regional at
Fresno State last weekend to be eliminated.
AI) list down to 2
While no official announcement has
been made, the search for an athletic direc
tor appears to be nearly complete. Accord
ing to sources in the athletic department,
the field has been narrowed to Ted Leland
and Donna Lopiano.
Leland, the current athletic director at
the University of the Pacific, met with ath
letic department personnel last week and
seemed to move into front-runner status.
Lopiano, the women's athletic director at
Texas, was in town yesterday.
