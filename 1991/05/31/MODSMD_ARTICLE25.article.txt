# Büg only gets letters from warped friends

The Lord™ works in mysterious
ways. Why, for instance, is there
midget bowling? Why do people find
Bob Hope funny? Why do only the men
with the largest bellies take their
shirts off at baseball games?
But I think you'll agree with me
that, in all of creation, the most won
drous thing of all is the striking simi
larity between the questions of late.
You be the judge:
Dear Bug,
What does the T stand for in Mr. T?
And why does he abbreviate ?
Dear Bug,
Whatever happened to "Face " from
that great show about ex-Vietnam vet
erans who are wanted by the military
police?
Believe it or not, I have in fact
received two separate questions about
"The A-Team" in the last week. Should
this, like many "Time/Life" mysteries,
be Dismissed as Coincidence? Or has
my status as a television junkie unduly
influenced my readership? Most
importantly, why do I insist on asking
myself questions all the time?
But hey, like Samantha Fox says,
nasty girls need love too. (I am well
aware this fits nowhere into this arti

cle, but it just had to be said.)
On to journalistic pillage. Mr. T, per
haps better known in suburban Amer
ica as Sgt. Basco "8.A." Baracus of
"The A-Team," has always had a spe
cial place in this invertebrate's heart.
So let's go with some fun Mr. T. facts:
• Mr. T. has asthma;
• Mr. T. was once Donna Summers'
bodyguard;
• Mr. T., that environment-con
scious nut, recently got into trouble for
cutting down several dozen trees in his
back yard with his chainsaw;
• Mr. T has a daughter, Lesa;
• Mr. T's real name is Lawrence
Tero, which accounts for the T. Why he
abbreviates one can only guess (you go
ask him); and
• Mr. T is much larger than I am
and, given the chance, would squish
me like a . . . well, you know

Another equally devastating
dramatis personae was the "smooth
talkin' ladies-man," Faceman, or Lt.
Templeton Peck (alas, an unfortunate
name), played by an esteemed per
former, Dirk Benedict (yet another ill
fated name).
This dynamic television actor's
repertoire has included a wide range of
roles from spaceship pilot on the short
lived "Battlestar Galactica" to heli
copter pilot on the shorter-lived
"Chopper One."
Why, as a whippersnapper, I myself
owned one of those plastic, disk
shaped Cyclon spaceships. You know,
the ones that shot the little plastic bul
lets that found their way into young
infants' larynxes while big multina
tional toy companies found their way
into all kinds of zany lawsuits.
Tracking our good pal Benedict was
no easy matter. His last appearance in
"TV Guide" in November 1986 would
seem to indicate his illustrious career
has fizzled out, though sources indi
cate he recently made a cameo in an
XTV special. (OK, so he really is fin
ished.)
From what I discovered, it appears
he has cast aside his thespian cloak
and moved back to Montana, where he
was born and raised.
But I'd like to think ("God," you
moan, "more extemporaneous
untruths.") old Benedict has been
keeping himself busy in all sorts of

illicit little ways.
Emotionally and financially
crushed by the fall of the once mighty
A-Team, unable to support a danger
ous and expensive drug habit (heroin,
DentuGrip and Tang), Faceman is eas
ily entrapped by the snares of a local
cult.
After several months of hypnosis,
programming and sensory deprivation,
he becomes a single-minded fanatic
slavishly devoted to a religion which
emphasizes communal living, reincar
nation and marriage to cute, fluffy
bunnies.
He quickly rises in the group's
ranks until he is elected Great Rabbit
Almighty. After a particularly moving
religious experience (PCR corned beef
and Tang), Benedict leads his followers
on a crusade in which he and 34 other
naked "pilgrims" assault and hijack a
neighborhood Arby's.
When their ransom demands ($1
million in nickels, a getaway chopper
and the dead body of Lionel Ritchie)
are not met, Dirk and his comrades
proceed to bludgeon their hostages
with plastic booster chairs until an
undersexed, steroid-dependent SWAI
team arrives on the scene and pumps
84 rounds of armor-piercing ammuni
tion into the ex-actor's body.
So, hey, send some questions to the
Storke Publications Building before I
get carried away.
