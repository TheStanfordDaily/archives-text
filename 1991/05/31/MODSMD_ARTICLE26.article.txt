The Stanford Daily
In the style of the National Enquirer, The Daily
interviewed a student who believed the ancient
Egyptians predicted the Great Depression. Accord
ing to sophomore George Grinnell, hieroglyphics
inside the Great Pyramid foretell the entire histo
ry of mankind, including everything from the dis

covery of America to World War I to the Depres
sion.
What is more amazing, said Grinnell, is that the
symbols predict that the Depression will come to
an end in just one year, ending on Sept. 16, 1936.
Grinnell claimed prior success in forecasting the
rise of Adolph Hitler. "I arrived at this conclusion
over three weeks before he became dictator," he
said.
Although constantly treated like a modern-day
Cassandra, Grinnell did gain fame 30 years later
when he used the hieroglyphics and the cover of
"Abbey Road" to prove that Paul McCartney was
dead.

The Stanford Daily
The Daily ran an ad that read, "Everybody's
playing the UKULELE. You can do it too." The ad

explained that if two subscriptions to the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin were purchased, the cus
tomer would receive "a standard size, top-quality
ukulele. . . . [and] an instruction book, too."
The ad promised, "You'll be playing the uke.
Playing for personal pleasure. Playing for praise.
Playing to become the center of attention wherev
er people gather." Customers were invited to
immediately mail in their order to the Call-Bul
letin, c/o the Ukulele Editor.
If 1 were to pull out my "uke" in class and start
strumming, I do believe I would become "the center
of attention, although not quite as the ad intended.
Little-known fact: During the ukulele craze of
1950, several women sold everything they owned to
move to Hawaii and buy a ukulele, like their idol
Don Ho. When they inevitably failed, they often
turned to prostitution. Thus, the origin of the term
"Ho Hos."
