# ASSU surcharge may be revamped
##

Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part
series on the ASSU finances.

The $99 most students will pay in ASSU
fees next year is one of the least understood
parts of the University bill.
Contrary to the popular misconception that
the money goes to fund the monolithic bureau
cracy of the ASSU, almost every dollar goes
directly to the student organizations approved
for special-fee requests in the spring general
election.
But a small portion of the fee goes to a
"non-refundable surcharge" to fund some
ASSU operating expenses, such as the election
and the fee-refund system. Next year, the
charge will be about $1.50 per quarter â€” a

drop from that of previous years.
While the fee-refund system itself has tradi
tionally received harsh criticism, many people
within the ASSU are now also raising ques
tions about how special-fee money is being
spent. Others believe the surcharge should be
eliminated completely
The non-refundable surcharge
The fee-refund system allows students to
recover their money from organizations that
receive a special fee. For instance, a student
can get back the 81 cents of next year's
autumn special fee allocated to the Stanford
Axe Committee.
But an additional $1.46 of next fall's ASSU
fees will go to the non-refundable surcharge,
paying for the operating costs of Program
Board, Publications Board, the Elections Com
mission and the fee-refund system. Students

are unable to recover this money even if they
request the maximum fee refund.
The ASSU Bylaws require students to pay
for these functions through the non-refund
able surcharge, but some senators claim that
money should instead be allocated from the
$130,000 in profits the ASSU will make from
its business projects next year.
"We could pay for the elections and fee
refund system," said graduate senator Larry
Augustin. "We could make other administra
tive changes and pay for them out of profits,
reduce the amount students pay in their bills
and still have plenty of money left over."
Financial manager Mike Risch also sug
gested that the ASSU "should be able to fund
its own elections" but said only the senate can
make that decision.
