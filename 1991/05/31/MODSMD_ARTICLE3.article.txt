# ASSU surcharge may be revamped
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part
series on the ASSU finances.

The $99 most students will pay in ASSU
fees next year is one of the least understood
parts of the University bill.
Contrary to the popular misconception that
the money goes to fund the monolithic bureau
cracy of the ASSU, almost every dollar goes
directly to the student organizations approved
for special-fee requests in the spring general
election.
But a small portion of the fee goes to a
"non-refundable surcharge" to fund some
ASSU operating expenses, such as the election
and the fee-refund system. Next year, the
charge will be about $1.50 per quarter â€” a

drop from that of previous years.
While the fee-refund system itself has tradi
tionally received harsh criticism, many people
within the ASSU are now also raising ques
tions about how special-fee money is being
spent. Others believe the surcharge should be
eliminated completely
The non-refundable surcharge
The fee-refund system allows students to
recover their money from organizations that
receive a special fee. For instance, a student
can get back the 81 cents of next year's
autumn special fee allocated to the Stanford
Axe Committee.
But an additional $1.46 of next fall's ASSU
fees will go to the non-refundable surcharge,
paying for the operating costs of Program
Board, Publications Board, the Elections Com
mission and the fee-refund system. Students

are unable to recover this money even if they
request the maximum fee refund.
The ASSU Bylaws require students to pay
for these functions through the non-refund
able surcharge, but some senators claim that
money should instead be allocated from the
$130,000 in profits the ASSU will make from
its business projects next year.
"We could pay for the elections and fee
refund system," said graduate senator Larry
Augustin. "We could make other administra
tive changes and pay for them out of profits,
reduce the amount students pay in their bills
and still have plenty of money left over."
Financial manager Mike Risch also sug
gested that the ASSU "should be able to fund
its own elections" but said only the senate can
make that decision.
In fact, it is possible that the
non-refundable surcharge will be
eliminated next year. "I will do
everything I can to hasten its
demise," said graduate senator
Doug Bone, who is the new co
chair of the senate budget and
finance committee.
Council of Presidents-elect
member John Overdeck and this
past year's financial manager,
Torrence Boone, worked this year
to lower the non-refundable stu
dent fees by beginning a five-year
process to liquidate an account
called the "special buffer fund."
The buffer fund was created
because the ASSU fees must be a
whole number; therefore, the fee
gets rounded up to the next full
dollar. More than $81,000 has
accumulated in the account over
the last several years.
Because of this and another
minor accounting change, the
non-refundable part of student
fees will be lowered for the next
five years by about $1 per quarter
to about $1.50. Despite this
change, the overall student fees
will not decrease because many
organizations were allocated
higher special fees in the election.
A lack of oversight
Some senators are also looking

at the past use of the non-refund
able fees and are questioning the
senate and business office's over
sight.
"The elections account and the
Program Board operating account
are disgusting. All the financial
manager's office does is to check
to make sure that the vouchers
and invoices are signed,"
Overdeck said.
When administrative manager
Sophia Shing, a junior, took office
at the beginning of this year, she
had undergone no training and
basically had to redefine her posi
tion. Shing said many internal
ASSU accounts had not been
overseen in the past.
Most criticism of the ASSU
accounts has focused on past
operating expenses, as efforts
have recently been made to
increase oversight.
Former elections commissioner
Raul Lopez said he discovered a
$7,000 deficit in the 1990 election
budget that had "just been cov
ered up when the account was
closed."
"There is not very accurate
accounting and budgets have not
been checked," Lopez said.
Lopez blamed the senate for
many of the accounting problems.
"Last year's senate wanted
expenses but did not care where
the money was coming from,"he
said.
Overdeck alleged that special
fee money sometimes gets spent

erratically by Program Board and
Publications Board because the
senate has generally not kept a
very close eye on the process.
"When money is there, it gets
spent very quickly, such as the
$10,000 spent by Publications
Board on an improved workroom"
in the Storke Publications Build
ing for various student
publications, Overdeck said. "But
other times it is difficult to get
even $100 out of them."
Overdeck said the senate
should take a move active role in
overseeing Program Board and
Publications Board and both
should become "more responsive
to the students."
Undergraduate senator David
Hyatt, who is currently the editor
of the Chaparral and will join
Publications Board next year,
agreed that money sometimes get
spent sporadically but said the
funding tends to be "windfallish."
"I would agree that it is proba
bly frustrating for smaller publi
cations to struggle for $200 and
then see $10,000 spent on com
puters, but they were badly
needed," Hyatt said. "Hopefully
having a senator on Publications
Board will alleviate any past prob
lems."
Augustin said a comprehensive
system needs to be implemented
to solve the problems of the past.
"There needs to be a procedure
for someone to audit the accounts
and compare (actual) expendi

tures to budgeted expenditures.
No one ever does this.
"It might not make much of a
difference in our bottom line, but
money sloshes around and we
don't notice it," Augustin added.
The system will be fixed
Risch acknowledged that prob
lems may have occurred in the
past but said he and Shing will
work together to fix them.
"I have heard stories that peo
ple think they can get away with
anything in our banking services,
but we will be really cracking
down," Risch said. "Nobody real
ized until this year that Sophia
was supposed to keep track of the
internal offices like the elections
commission."
Risch said his office will use its
computer system to track all of
the expenditures, and Shing will
periodically check them.
Shing said she has worked to
"streamline things that have not
been used as well as they could
have been used" and will continue
to improve the office.
"With budget cuts, we need to
use all of our money as efficiently
as possible," Shing said. "I am
now better prepared to make
changes because I know the back
ground of the projects.
Bone said more needs to be
done, such as an oversight mecha
nism for Program Board and Pub
lications Board to prevent a
return to the past problems.
