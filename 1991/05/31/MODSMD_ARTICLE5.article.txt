"Shakespeare," "Dance His

cal Utopian Thought" seemingly
have little to do with one another.
But taking any of these three

The Faculty Senate yesterday
approved lists of courses that can
be taken to fulfill the distribution
requirements it revised in late
November.

"American Cultures," which may

an "asterisked" gender studies

by courses that incorporate the
examination of gender issues.

courses yesterday that will satisfy
the American Cultures require

"Chicano Culture" and "Jews and
Judaism in America" to "The
American 19605: Thought,
Protest and Culture" and
"Anthropological Perspectives on
American Culture."
Courses are nominated by
departments and professors and
reviewed by a faculty committee
