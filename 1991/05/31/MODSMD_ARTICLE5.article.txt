"Shakespeare," "Dance His
tory and Philosophy" and "Politi
cal Utopian Thought" seemingly
have little to do with one another.
But taking any of these three
courses next year — or one of 27
others — will satisfy the recently
created gender studies require
ment.
The Faculty Senate yesterday
approved lists of courses that can
be taken to fulfill the distribution
requirements it revised in late
November.
Next year's entering freshman
face two new requirements:
"American Cultures," which may
be fulfilled by courses that exam
ine racial, ethnic or religious
diversity in the United States, and
an "asterisked" gender studies
requirement that may be fulfilled
by courses that incorporate the
examination of gender issues.
The senate approved 19
courses yesterday that will satisfy
the American Cultures require
ment. The courses range from
"Chicano Culture" and "Jews and
Judaism in America" to "The
American 19605: Thought,
Protest and Culture" and
"Anthropological Perspectives on
American Culture."
Courses are nominated by
departments and professors and
reviewed by a faculty committee
and its subcommittees to deter
mine whether they meet the stan
dards of the distribution require
ments.
Psychology Prof. Amos Tversky
voiced concern at yesterday's
meeting that the list of gender
studies courses lacked "intellec
tual coherence."
"It seems to me entirely arbi
trary what's in and what's out,"
he said.
But History Prof. Peter Stan
skv, who headed the subcommit
tee examining nominated gender
studies courses, defended the list.
"We spent hours and hours
reviewing them," he said.
He added that only courses in
which the study of gender is a
"major aspect" had been included.
"A bit of tokenism .. . was not
enough," he said.
In other business, the senate
discussed new guidelines on train
ing and evaluating teaching assis
tants formulated by the Commit
tee on Graduate Studies.
The senate also renewed two
degree-granting programs:
• The School of Engineering's
undergraduate individually
designed major program, for eight
years; and
• The School of Medicine's pro
gram in Medical Information Sci
ences, for five years.
