# Program makes Stanford, Palo Alto High students 'best buddies'
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
The first time Tracy Jarrett met Becca
Schanberg, they were best buddies.
The two became acquainted when
Schanberg taught Jarrett finger games.
Remembering one of them, Jarrett laced
her hands back to back, retaining free
movement of both middle fingers. Then
she performed a trick with her index fin
ger, bending it vertically and horizontally
to make an "L" shape in repeating
motions.
"This is what Becca taught me," she
certified with a grin as Schanberg sat
across from her, feet apart, smiling and
nodding.
Jarrett and Schanberg met at a picnic

held by Best Buddies — a program that
pairs Stanford students with mentally
impaired students from Palo Alto Hitfii
School.
Out of 13 kids in Palo Alto High
School's special education program, 12
have been matched with Stanford stu
dents.
The Stanford program is part of an
international organization that was
founded about five years ago at George
town University and can be found in
many college campuses across the nation
today. It has been here for about two
years.
"When I became involved with the pro
gram this fall, I was really unsure about
what it would be like to work with some
one like Jarrett and I wasn't sure what I

could give her, if she could learn anything
with me," said Schanberg, a sophomore.
But now the two can he found dancing
in Schanberg's dorm room to music by
Technotronic or enjoying Ren and Jerry's
ice cream at a Best Buddies fund raiser in
White Plaza.
"Just spending time together has been
the best thing for both of us," Schanberg
said. "Tracy's a great person."
Schanberg and Jarrett see each other
several times a month, sometimes here at
Stanford, and sometimes at Jarrett's
house. They easily fill the time with din
ner, a movie, or just conversation.
The two also talk by phone a few times
a week to stay in touch and to keep up on
each other's lives.
After spending an evening with her

buddy, Schanberg said, "It's one of the
best things I've done here." Interacting
with Jarrett has "changed the way I look
at people," she added. "I realized that
what's important about people is not the
way they look, but what's inside."
Jarrett has had many back operations,
yet she still enjoys many sports such as
swimming, soccer and basketball. Her
medals in swimming and track and field
events at the Santa Clara County Special
Olympics this past year illustrate her love
of sports.
Schanberg said Jarrett is also learning
how not to be concerned with what other
people think. "Tracy's learning to be
more assertive all the time. She will say
what she wants and fights for it," Schan
berg said, adding that she learned from

Jarrett that "you can do your own thing."
Others have also noticed the change in
Schanberg after she became involved
with the program. Sophomore Jen Bar
ton, Schanberg's roommate, said, "Becca
would mention more often if I was being
judgmental about others, and she's
become very sensitive to that."
Jarrett's family is very supportive and
encourages her to become involved in
many activities. Besides sports, Jarrett
works at a grocery store stacking and
shelving in the produce department
through another program for mentally
handicapped children.
"Upon meeting someone like Tracy,
people are wary at first," said Schanberg.
But "lots of my friends have gotten to
know her and they really like her."
