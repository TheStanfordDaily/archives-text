YOU'RE ALL EXPECTED HERE FOR CENTENNIAL FINALE

To ensure you receive your registration materials, be sure to file your summer
address with the Office of the Registrar.
From June 14 to Sept. 13, 1991, all University mail will be sent to students' summer addresses, not the local
address. If you do not file a summer address with the Oftice of the Registrar, your university mail, including
Centennial registration materials, bill, ID, and study list for autumn quarter, will be sent to your permanent
address. So please submit a summer address to the Registrar's Office Information Window, Old Union lobby.
Look for your Centennial registration materials in early August.
