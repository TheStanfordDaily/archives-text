TOGETHER, YOU TALKING HEADS RAISED A FEW MORE THAN...
27.2 MILLION CENTS
./HANKS
FOR YOUR HELP WITH THE 9TH ANNUAL STUDENT TELETHON!
NEARLY 380 VOLUNTEERS TALKED TO 4,700 ALUMNI AND FRIENDS ALL OVER NORTH AMERICA.
THERE WERE SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS, WHICH LED TO A PLEDGE TOTAL OF OVER $272,000 (27,200,000 CENTS).
THE TELETHON INCENTIVE PROGRAM (TIP) DREW STUDENTS FROM A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS. TIP WAS ESTABLISHED BY GIFTS FROM
FACULTY, STAFF, AND ALUMNI AS A WAY TO THANK STUDENTS FOR THEIR GIFT OF TIME. EACH VOLUNTEER DESIGNATED $40 OF THE FUND TO AN AREA OF HIS OR HER CHOICE.
