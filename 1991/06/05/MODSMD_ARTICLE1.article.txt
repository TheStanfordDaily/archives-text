# Chinese request regular meetings
## 
### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
An official from the Chinese
Consulate in San Francisco has
quietly asked to use a University
building to meet at regular inter
vals with Stanford's more than
200 Chinese students and schol
ars.
The unusual request has wor
ried administrators who say they
are concerned that Chinese stu
dents could be intimidated by a
new high-level Chinese govern
ment presence on campus.
Campus Chinese leaders said
they fear the consulate is attempt
ing to chill their political freedom
at Stanford. They also said the
proposal is an attempt to under
mine the independent Association
of Chinese Students and Scholars
at Stanford, which was created
after the Chinese government
crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters two years ago this
week.
"The consul would like to come
down every two weeks, to have a
room at the (Bechtel) Interna
tional Center to meet with stu
dents," said John Pearson, direc
tor of the center.
"It's why they're coming that's
the problem. We're not quite sure
why yet," he said.
Pearson said that although the
consulate is a source for informa
tion about family members of Chi
nese students at home and for
extending passports, "I can't see
the rationale or necessity to come
down every two weeks. . . I feel
quite honestly I have to find out
what the consulate would do in
these meetings."
Pearson is currently writing a
letter to the consulate asking for
more details of the request.
Huang Zhu Quan, an official
from the education section of the
consulate, confirmed in an inter
view that he requested the use of
meeting space. "The main idea of
this matter is that I just need
some place to meet with the stu
dents and scholars for conve
nience. For my convenience and
theirs," Huang said.
He added that he would like to
come to the center "maybe twice a
month" but said he has not
received any comment yet from
Pearson. The decision on how
many visits to make would be
made "according to the necessary
situation. If the student wants to
meet me, I can go there."
Huang said there is "no special
purpose" for the meetings. He
suggested that he may be able to
help extend passports, for
instance.
But many students were not
receptive to the idea of consulate
officials visiting campus regularly.
Li Xiaorong, a Chinese gradu
ate student in philosophy and a
member of the elected five-person
board of directors of the student
and scholar association, said, "We
really don't see any need for them
to be here so often. . . . Their pres
ence on campus will be threaten
ing to students," she said.
Judith Polenta, administrative
assistant at the center, received a
telephone call from a Chinese stu
dent at Stanford with a message
from the consulate. Pearson said
the Center has never been
reached like this previously.
Huang admitted he "sent the
message to the International Cen
ter through the student."
The message said the consulate
wanted to help students with
their "bureaucratic paperwork,"
said Polenta. She called the
request "not normal" and said it is
"very unusual" for a consulate to

use I-Center premises.
"It may be legitimate," she
added, but "one tends to think
they're requesting it because they
want to spy on the students."
Student leaders fear
government presence
Zhang Hong, a graduate stu
dent in biophysics who is the pres
ident of the association, disputed
Huang's contention that the con
sulate is only seeking to spend
time on campus to serve the stu
dents.
"Of course they claim this is for
student convenience," said Zhang.
"Many of our members think
there is something else going on
behind it."
Zhang and others leaders say
they think Chinese government
officials are trying to regain influ
ence over students who were
driven away by the crackdown in
China in 1989 and are practicing
democratic politics in their own
organizations.
"I don't like this," said Liu
Yongchuan, past president of the
Independent Federation of Chi
nese Students and Scholars, a
national organization. "If any per
son from the consulate can sit in
the International Center regu
larly it will look like someone is
there to check what Chinese stu
dents are doing at Stanford."
The purpose of the federation,
according to Liu, a sociology grad
uate student, is to advocate

democracy in China and to serve
the more than 40,000 Chinese
students in the United States.
"I believe this will scare some
Chinese students. This will make
them afraid to participate in any
kind of political activities spon
sored by the federation or any
other Chinese student organiza
tion," he said.
According to Li, in the associa
tion's elections during the past
two years, the majority of Chinese
students here have voted against
government wishes to maintain
the organization as an indepen
dent, pro-democratic student
organization. Still, many students
are not willing to show their oppo
sition publicly.
"They want to be apolitical and
[they] have other worries," she
said.
Zhang said the I-Center would
lose its function as a support net
work for Chinese students if a
consulate official was often pre
sent. The association uses an
office in the center, and she said
that pro-democratic political fly
ers and books would not be dis
played if students thought they
would be seen looking at them.
Consulate official says
fear unjustified
Huang said his presence on
campus poses no threat to stu
dents and should not be under
stood as such. Student fears that
having a Chinese government offi
cial on campus regularly would
stifle debate are unfounded, he
said.
"Why they couldn't speak
out?" he asked.
"They needn't worry that I go

'I want to go there to
meet students. This is
my duty.'
— Huang Zhu Quan

to campus. ... I want to go there
to meet students. This is my
duty," Huang said.
Huang also said "the so-called
student leaders" were being "too
sensitive, I think" about his pro
posed presence on campus.
"If they want to meet me, I say
OK. If they don't want to meet
me, also OK. There is no force to
meet me," he said.
Students want I-Center
to limit access
Zhang said she has already
expressed student concerns to
Pearson and Polenta. She added
that she solicited opinions on this
issue from the five elected board
members and from advisory board
members of the association using
electronic mail.
Responses indicate that the
majority of the students are
strongly opposed to Huang's pro
posal, she said. Others said they
would accept consulate presence,
but only if it is limited and actu
ally designed to serve the needs of
students.
Zhang said the association is
taking what she called a "middle
ground" position.
"We are welcoming them here
if they are really concerned for the
convenience of students," she
said. She made three central
requests to administrators at the
I-Center about any future con
sulate visits:
• If a consulate official wants to

meet with students at the center it
should contact the student associ
ation 10 days in advance, and the
association will reserve the room.
Likewise, if students or scholars
here need assistance on paper
work, the association will call and
invite an official to come to the
center.
• All consulate meetings at the
center should be public. Zhang
said there should be "no secrecy"
and there should be demand for
the consulate's services. "It can't
be that they just want to come and
pass out propaganda. If they have
to make it public, they wouldn't
dare to do it."
• All of the association's mem
bers should be treated equally by
consulate officials in meetings at
the center. The officials should
not discriminate against students
who are more politically active
than others.
Some students like Liu have
been denied extensions to their
passports. Liu said he is the top
name on a Chinese government
list of overseas "counter-revolu
tionaries" and that his request for
a passport extension received no
response from the consulate.
"If they are really coming to
serve the students, then they
should extend the passports,"
Zhang said.
Attending "political demon
strations for the democracy move
ment is not a crime," she said.
Pearson said there are a num
ber of Chinese students and schol
ars here in the same predicament
as Liu.
Who serves the
Chinese students?
At the center of the issue, stu

dents leaders say, is that Huang's
proposal is challenging the
authority of the association to
represent Chinese students here.
"The students are not only one
person," Huang said. "We have
more than 200 students [at Stan
ford]. The 200 have 200 different
views, different ideas. ..."
But philosophy graduate stu
dent Li said that because the asso
ciation's leadership is democrati
cally elected, the leaders have the
right to speak for the majority of
Chinese students on the issue of
regular consulate meetings in the
I-Center.
"We will speak up for our
selves," she said.
Liu said the consulate has an
incentive to try to weaken the
association because it is among
the most active in the United
States. Liu.said the association
recently has faxed information to
China that it hopes can help the
democracy movement there and
has worked to help political pris
oners and families of those killed
in the June 1989 crackdown.
The "totalitarian" Chinese gov
ernment seeks to control all
aspects of Chinese life, within
China and also abroad, in an
attempt to prevent democratic
change from occurring in China,
Liu said.
"They don't want to have inde
pendent organizations. They want
to have everything controlled by
them," Liu said.

down every two weeks. . . I feel
quite honestly I have to find out
what the consulate would do in
these meetings."
Pearson is currently writing a
letter to the consulate asking for
more details of the request.
Huang Zhu Quan, an official
from the education section of the
consulate, confirmed in an inter
view that he requested the use of
meeting space. "The main idea of
this matter is that I just need
some place to meet with the stu
dents and scholars for conve
nience. For my convenience and
theirs," Huang said.
He added that he would like to
come to the center "maybe twice a
month" but said he has not
received any comment yet from
Pearson. The decision on how
many visits to make would be
made "according to the necessary
situation. If the student wants to
meet me, I can go there."
Huang said there is "no special
purpose" for the meetings. He
suggested that he may be able to
help extend passports, for
instance.
But many students were not
receptive to the idea of consulate
officials visiting campus regularly.
Li Xiaorong, a Chinese gradu
ate student in philosophy and a
member of the elected five-person
board of directors of the student
and scholar association, said, "We
really don't see any need for them
to be here so often. . . . Their pres
ence on campus will be threaten
ing to students," she said.
Judith Polenta, administrative
assistant at the center, received a
telephone call from a Chinese stu
dent at Stanford with a message
from the consulate. Pearson said
the Center has never been
reached like this previously.
Huang admitted he "sent the
message to the International Cen
ter through the student."
The message said the consulate
wanted to help students with
their "bureaucratic paperwork,"
said Polenta. She called the
request "not normal" and said it is
"very unusual" for a consulate to

use I-Center premises.
"It may be legitimate," she
added, but "one tends to think
they're requesting it because they
want to spy on the students."
Student leaders fear
government presence
Zhang Hong, a graduate stu
dent in biophysics who is the pres
ident of the association, disputed
Huang's contention that the con
sulate is only seeking to spend
time on campus to serve the stu
dents.
"Of course they claim this is for
student convenience," said Zhang.
"Many of our members think
there is something else going on
behind it."
Zhang and others leaders say
they think Chinese government
officials are trying to regain influ
ence over students who were
driven away by the crackdown in
China in 1989 and are practicing
democratic politics in their own
organizations.
"I don't like this," said Liu
Yongchuan, past president of the
Independent Federation of Chi
nese Students and Scholars, a
national organization. "If any per
son from the consulate can sit in
the International Center regu
larly it will look like someone is
there to check what Chinese stu
dents are doing at Stanford."
The purpose of the federation,
according to Liu, a sociology grad
uate student, is to advocate

democracy in China and to serve
the more than 40,000 Chinese
students in the United States.
"I believe this will scare some
Chinese students. This will make
them afraid to participate in any
kind of political activities spon
sored by the federation or any
other Chinese student organiza
tion," he said.
According to Li, in the associa
tion's elections during the past
two years, the majority of Chinese
students here have voted against
government wishes to maintain
the organization as an indepen
dent, pro-democratic student
organization. Still, many students
are not willing to show their oppo
sition publicly.
"They want to be apolitical and
[they] have other worries," she
said.
Zhang said the I-Center would
lose its function as a support net
work for Chinese students if a
consulate official was often pre
sent. The association uses an
office in the center, and she said
that pro-democratic political fly
ers and books would not be dis
played if students thought they
would be seen looking at them.
Consulate official says
fear unjustified
Huang said his presence on
campus poses no threat to stu
dents and should not be under
stood as such. Student fears that
having a Chinese government offi
cial on campus regularly would
stifle debate are unfounded, he
said.
"Why they couldn't speak
out?" he asked.
"They needn't worry that I go

'I want to go there to
meet students. This is
my duty.'
— Huang Zhu Quan

to campus. ... I want to go there
to meet students. This is my
duty," Huang said.
Huang also said "the so-called
student leaders" were being "too
sensitive, I think" about his pro
posed presence on campus.
"If they want to meet me, I say
OK. If they don't want to meet
me, also OK. There is no force to
meet me," he said.
Students want I-Center
to limit access
Zhang said she has already
expressed student concerns to
Pearson and Polenta. She added
that she solicited opinions on this
issue from the five elected board
members and from advisory board
members of the association using
electronic mail.
Responses indicate that the
majority of the students are
strongly opposed to Huang's pro
posal, she said. Others said they
would accept consulate presence,
but only if it is limited and actu
ally designed to serve the needs of
students.
Zhang said the association is
taking what she called a "middle
ground" position.
"We are welcoming them here
if they are really concerned for the
convenience of students," she
said. She made three central
requests to administrators at the
I-Center about any future con
sulate visits:
• If a consulate official wants to

meet with students at the center it
should contact the student associ
ation 10 days in advance, and the
association will reserve the room.
Likewise, if students or scholars
here need assistance on paper
work, the association will call and
invite an official to come to the
center.
• All consulate meetings at the
center should be public. Zhang
said there should be "no secrecy"
and there should be demand for
the consulate's services. "It can't
be that they just want to come and
pass out propaganda. If they have
to make it public, they wouldn't
dare to do it."
• All of the association's mem
bers should be treated equally by
consulate officials in meetings at
the center. The officials should
not discriminate against students
who are more politically active
than others.
Some students like Liu have
been denied extensions to their
passports. Liu said he is the top
name on a Chinese government
list of overseas "counter-revolu
tionaries" and that his request for
a passport extension received no
response from the consulate.
"If they are really coming to
serve the students, then they
should extend the passports,"
Zhang said.
Attending "political demon
strations for the democracy move
ment is not a crime," she said.
Pearson said there are a num
ber of Chinese students and schol
ars here in the same predicament
as Liu.
Who serves the
Chinese students?
At the center of the issue, stu

dents leaders say, is that Huang's
proposal is challenging the
authority of the association to
represent Chinese students here.
"The students are not only one
person," Huang said. "We have
more than 200 students [at Stan
ford]. The 200 have 200 different
views, different ideas. ..."
But philosophy graduate stu
dent Li said that because the asso
ciation's leadership is democrati
cally elected, the leaders have the
right to speak for the majority of
Chinese students on the issue of
regular consulate meetings in the
I-Center.
"We will speak up for our
selves," she said.
Liu said the consulate has an
incentive to try to weaken the
association because it is among
the most active in the United
States. Liu.said the association
recently has faxed information to
China that it hopes can help the
democracy movement there and
has worked to help political pris
oners and families of those killed
in the June 1989 crackdown.
The "totalitarian" Chinese gov
ernment seeks to control all
aspects of Chinese life, within
China and also abroad, in an
attempt to prevent democratic
change from occurring in China,
Liu said.
"They don't want to have inde
pendent organizations. They want
to have everything controlled by
them," Liu said.

For the record

incorrectly reported the total
earthquake repair cost for Memo
rial Church. It is $8.5 million.
An official from the Chinese
Consulate in San Francisco has
quietly asked to use a University
building to meet at regular inter
vals with Stanford's more than
200 Chinese students and schol
ars.
The unusual request has wor
ried administrators who say they
are concerned that Chinese stu
dents could be intimidated by a
new high-level Chinese govern
ment presence on campus.
Campus Chinese leaders said
they fear the consulate is attempt
ing to chill their political freedom
at Stanford. They also said the
proposal is an attempt to under
mine the independent Association
of Chinese Students and Scholars
at Stanford, which was created
after the Chinese government
crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters two years ago this
week.
"The consul would like to come
down every two weeks, to have a
room at the (Bechtel) Interna
tional Center to meet with stu
dents," said John Pearson, direc
tor of the center.
"It's why they're coming that's
the problem. We're not quite sure
why yet," he said.
Pearson said that although the
consulate is a source for informa
tion about family members of Chi
nese students at home and for
extending passports, "I can't see
the rationale or necessity to come
down every two weeks. . . I feel
quite honestly I have to find out

really don't see any need for them
to be here so often. . . . Their pres
ence on campus will be threaten
ing to students," she said.
Judith Polenta, administrative
assistant at the center, received a
telephone call from a Chinese stu
dent at Stanford with a message
from the consulate. Pearson said
the Center has never been
reached like this previously.
Huang admitted he "sent the
message to the International Cen
ter through the student."
The message said the consulate
wanted to help students with
their "bureaucratic paperwork,"
said Polenta. She called the
request "not normal" and said it is
"very unusual" for a consulate to

use I-Center premises.
"It may be legitimate," she
added, but "one tends to think
they're requesting it because they
want to spy on the students."
Student leaders fear
government presence
Zhang Hong, a graduate stu
dent in biophysics who is the pres
ident of the association, disputed
Huang's contention that the con
sulate is only seeking to spend
time on campus to serve the stu
dents.
"Of course they claim this is for
student convenience," said Zhang.
"Many of our members think
there is something else going on
behind it."
Zhang and others leaders say
they think Chinese government
officials are trying to regain influ
ence over students who were
driven away by the crackdown in
China in 1989 and are practicing
democratic politics in their own
organizations.
"I don't like this," said Liu
Yongchuan, past president of the
Independent Federation of Chi
nese Students and Scholars, a
national organization. "If any per
son from the consulate can sit in
the International Center regu
larly it will look like someone is
there to check what Chinese stu
dents are doing at Stanford."
The purpose of the federation,
according to Liu, a sociology grad
uate student, is to advocate

democracy in China and to serve
the more than 40,000 Chinese
students in the United States.
"I believe this will scare some
Chinese students. This will make
them afraid to participate in any
kind of political activities spon
sored by the federation or any
other Chinese student organiza
tion," he said.
According to Li, in the associa
tion's elections during the past
two years, the majority of Chinese
students here have voted against
government wishes to maintain
the organization as an indepen
dent, pro-democratic student
organization. Still, many students
are not willing to show their oppo
sition publicly.
"They want to be apolitical and
[they] have other worries," she
said.
Zhang said the I-Center would
lose its function as a support net
work for Chinese students if a
consulate official was often pre
sent. The association uses an
office in the center, and she said
that pro-democratic political fly
ers and books would not be dis
played if students thought they
would be seen looking at them.
Consulate official says
fear unjustified
Huang said his presence on
campus poses no threat to stu
dents and should not be under
stood as such. Student fears that
having a Chinese government offi
cial on campus regularly would
stifle debate are unfounded, he
said.
"Why they couldn't speak
out?" he asked.
"They needn't worry that I go

'I want to go there to
meet students. This is
my duty.'

to campus. ... I want to go there
to meet students. This is my
duty," Huang said.
Huang also said "the so-called
student leaders" were being "too
sensitive, I think" about his pro
posed presence on campus.
"If they want to meet me, I say
OK. If they don't want to meet
me, also OK. There is no force to
meet me," he said.
Students want I-Center
to limit access
Zhang said she has already
expressed student concerns to
Pearson and Polenta. She added
that she solicited opinions on this
issue from the five elected board
members and from advisory board
members of the association using
electronic mail.
Responses indicate that the
majority of the students are
strongly opposed to Huang's pro
posal, she said. Others said they
would accept consulate presence,
but only if it is limited and actu
ally designed to serve the needs of
students.
Zhang said the association is
taking what she called a "middle
ground" position.
"We are welcoming them here
if they are really concerned for the
convenience of students," she
said. She made three central
requests to administrators at the
I-Center about any future con
sulate visits:
• If a consulate official wants to

meet with students at the center it
should contact the student associ
ation 10 days in advance, and the
association will reserve the room.
Likewise, if students or scholars
here need assistance on paper
work, the association will call and
invite an official to come to the
center.
• All consulate meetings at the
center should be public. Zhang
said there should be "no secrecy"
and there should be demand for
the consulate's services. "It can't
be that they just want to come and
pass out propaganda. If they have
to make it public, they wouldn't
dare to do it."
• All of the association's mem
bers should be treated equally by
consulate officials in meetings at
the center. The officials should
not discriminate against students
who are more politically active
than others.
Some students like Liu have
been denied extensions to their
passports. Liu said he is the top
name on a Chinese government
list of overseas "counter-revolu
tionaries" and that his request for
a passport extension received no
response from the consulate.
"If they are really coming to
serve the students, then they
should extend the passports,"
Zhang said.
Attending "political demon
strations for the democracy move
ment is not a crime," she said.
Pearson said there are a num
ber of Chinese students and schol
ars here in the same predicament
as Liu.
Who serves the
Chinese students?
At the center of the issue, stu

dents leaders say, is that Huang's
proposal is challenging the
authority of the association to
represent Chinese students here.
"The students are not only one
person," Huang said. "We have
more than 200 students [at Stan
ford]. The 200 have 200 different
views, different ideas. ..."
But philosophy graduate stu
dent Li said that because the asso
ciation's leadership is democrati
cally elected, the leaders have the
right to speak for the majority of
Chinese students on the issue of
regular consulate meetings in the
I-Center.
"We will speak up for our
selves," she said.
Liu said the consulate has an
incentive to try to weaken the
association because it is among
the most active in the United
States. Liu.said the association
recently has faxed information to
China that it hopes can help the
democracy movement there and
has worked to help political pris
oners and families of those killed
in the June 1989 crackdown.
The "totalitarian" Chinese gov
ernment seeks to control all
aspects of Chinese life, within
China and also abroad, in an
attempt to prevent democratic
change from occurring in China,
Liu said.
"They don't want to have inde
pendent organizations. They want
to have everything controlled by
them," Liu said.
