# Chinese request regular meetings

### Mike Laris Editorial staff 
An official from the Chinese
Consulate in San Francisco has
quietly asked to use a University
building to meet at regular inter
vals with Stanford's more than
200 Chinese students and schol

The unusual request has wor

are concerned that Chinese stu

Campus Chinese leaders said
they fear the consulate is attempt

consulate is a source for informa

extending passports, "I can't see
the rationale or necessity to come
down every two weeks. . . I feel
quite honestly I have to find out
what the consulate would do in
these meetings."
Pearson is currently writing a
letter to the consulate asking for
more details of the request.
Huang Zhu Quan, an official
from the education section of the
consulate, confirmed in an inter
view that he requested the use of
meeting space. "The main idea of
this matter is that I just need
some place to meet with the stu
dents and scholars for conve

theirs," Huang said.
He added that he would like to
come to the center "maybe twice a
month" but said he has not
received any comment yet from
Pearson. The decision on how
many visits to make would be
