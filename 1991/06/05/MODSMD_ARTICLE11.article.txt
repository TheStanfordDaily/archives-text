tures from Dingell and other con
gressmen dominated the proceed
ings.
"Stanford University has per
formed abysmally when it comes
to accounting for the federal dol
lars it receives," said Rep. Nor
man Lent, R-N.Y.
The message from Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas, was similar: "1
cannot help but conclude there
was an intentional effort on the
part of Stanford University to get
more money out o£ the taxpayers
than Stanford University
deserved," he said. Bryant later
accused Kennedy of "stone
walling" the subcommittee.
But the most biting criticism
came from Oregon Democrat Ron
Wyden, a Stanford graduate
whose mother currently works at
Green Library. "I think this is a
very sad day for one of the world's
great universities," Wyden said.

Indirect-cost rate cut
The Office of Naval Research
delivered a punishing blow to the
University, terminating close to
100 accounting agreements and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost
rate from 78 percent to 55.5 per
cent.
The actions were taken by the
Navy after its negotiations with

the University broke down with
out a settlement.
Provost James Rosse delivered
the financial damage assessment
several weeks later. Due largely to
the Navy's decision, Rosse told

the Faculty Sen
ate, the Univer
sity was facing a
two-year shortfall
of about $95 mil
lion and would
have to reduce its
operating budget
by 10 percent in
1992-93.
The negotia-

tions were prompted by allega
tions made by Navy regulator Paul
Biddle, a rough-and-tumble certi
fied accountant. According to Bid
die, a "cozy" relationship between
Stanford and past Navy officials
had allowed the University to rely
on accounting agreements that
were far too generous to Stanford.
The University had used the
agreements to overcharge the gov
ernment by $200 million during
the 1980s, Biddle asserted.
In response to Biddle's allega
tions, the chief of naval research
sent a special team to Stanford in
December to begin reviewing all
past agreements, known as mem
oranda of understanding. The two
parties agreed that the outcome of
the review would be retroactive to
Sept. 1.
After several delays, the Navy
announced April 26 that it was
taking unilateral action, discon

tinuing use of all but one of the
accounting agreements that had
bound the parties in the past. The
Navy's decision did not affect
prior years — the period Biddle
alleges was the source of impro
priety.
Stanford and the Navy will
review this year's rate again
before the books for this year are
finally closed, but such a review
probably won't take place for
another year. In the interim,
Stanford officials hope to develop
new costs studies that will justify
higher levels of reimbursement.
But the long-term picture
remains clouded. Several propos
als to limit indirect-cost recovery
are currently pending before
Congress, and the White House
plans an overhaul of federal rules
governing research universities.

Change in the ASSU
Students decided it was "time
for a change" during the ASSU
elections this spring.
The Students First slate
defeated the People's Platform
slate, making sophomores Beth
Morgan and Benny Sandoval,
junior John Louie and graduate
student John Overdeck the Coun
cil of Presidents for next year.
"The election signifies that the

students are tired of inaction on
campus," Morgan said. "People
want to see more results."
"It does not signify an end to
multiculturalism. It says that we
might need to redefine it and
rethink the message that is being
sent," she added.

After the Chaparral COP slate
forced a runoff, Students First
won with 64 percent of the vote.
People's Platform COP slate
member Jennifer Pearson
attributed the loss more to her
party's past than to the strength
of the individual candidates.
In fact, both parties moved
closer to the middle on many
issues during the election, agree
ing on the importance of things
such as multiculturalism and
combating sexual assault.
A big issue in the campaign
involved the focus of the ASSU
Senate and whether it should
debate national issues or concen
trate only on Stanford matters.
Two constitutional amendments
were passed limiting the senate to
issues affecting students here.
"Student government can be
effective if it concentrates on
things here," Overdeck said. "We
are very enthusiastic about things
such as the new business project
and the sexual assault task force."
The election also saw a marked
shift in the composition of the
senate, from the two-thirds
majority previously held by the
People's Platform to a balanced
split between the two parties. The
change left independent and
Hammer and Coffin senators with
the swing votes.
And like past elections, this one
also became embroiled in contro
versy. After being defeated in the
general election, MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group, con
vinced the senate to place it on the
runoff ballot, citing election irreg
ularities. It lost again in the
~"noff election.

Reges controversy
Stuart Reges, a computer sci
ence senior lecturer, was fired for
carrying illegal drugs on campus
and buying alcoholic beverages for

underage students.
Another basis for Reges' termi
nation was his refusal to promise
not to carry illegal drugs in his
backpack on campus in the
future, wrote James Gibbons,
dean of the School of Engineering,
in a letter dismissing Reges.

Drug czar Bob Mar
tinez warned Kennedy
that Stanford must
enforce its drug and
alcohol policy.

Gibbons said his decision was
not influenced by Reges' advice to
a student to experiment with the
amphetamine-derived hallucino
gen MDA. But, Gibbons added, "I
personally consider your advice to
students extremely irresponsi
• ble."
In two November letters to The
Daily and in a March letter to
national drug czar Bob Martinez,
Reges admitted that he carried
illegal drugs on campus to protest
U.S. drug policy. Reges also admit
ted he had advised the student to
experiment with MDA.
Martinez wrote a letter to Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy April 12 warning
Kennedy that Stanford must
enforce its drug and alcohol policy
or risk losing federal funds.
Reges' termination came three
weeks after he was placed on paid
administrative leave, during
which an investigation was car
ried out by Ken Down, associate
dean for administration in the
School of Engineering and Kathy
Davis, associate dean for human
resources in the school.
The controversy surrounding
Reges was covered by the national
media, including The New York
Times and CNN. His case raised
questions around campus and
nationwide about drug legaliza
tion, the pros and cons of drug use
and what constitutes free speech
and punishable conduct.
