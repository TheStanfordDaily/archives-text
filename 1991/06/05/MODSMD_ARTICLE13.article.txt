# Editorial
## Editor's farewell 
### 
IT'S FUNNY, BUT I'VE learned
surprisingly little about jour
nalism as editor in chief of The
Daily.
I found myself before the ASSU
Senate a couple of times, explain
ing both the paper's independence
and the rationale for collecting stu
dent fees.
I had to sit down with a reporter
and discuss a near-plagiarized
story.
And a few times I had to go over
the heads of editors to either pull
or demand changes to stories
plagued by a range of problems,
from being tasteless to untimely.
But those and other experiences
taught me little about newspaper
work. Hopefully, I taught others
something, but as editor I usually
relied on knowledge I had gained
and judgment I had developed ear
lier.
What I did learn during my
three-and-a-half month tenure
were seemingly simpler, more uni
versal lessons: the importance of
listening, of working together to
solve problems, and even of clean
ing up messes.
So, borrowing a page from
Robert Fulghum's "All I Really
Need to Know I Learned in Kinder
garten," I'd like to tell "Lots of
Things I'll Need to Know I
Learned as Editor in Chief."
• There just aren't enough
hours in the day;
• Idealism goes out the window
sometime around 3 a.m.;
• You still have to set your sights
high, or you'll never go anywhere;
• Any situation seems easier to
deal with after some sleep;
• You have to let people you
work with make mistakes, so they
can learn from them;
• But sometimes you have to
correct those mistakes. Figuring
out when is the hard part;
• "Off campus" gets farther and
farther away the later and later it

gets at night;
• No one has all the answers;
• Plenty of people think they do;
• You're only human;
• The old way isn't always the
best way;
• Parents know a lot and are
more important than you some
times admit;
• A "things to do" list always
gets longer before it gets shorter;
• But, somehow, it all gets done;
• Trust your instinct;
• People are more likely to point
out negatives than positives;
• Don't take everything person
ally;
• A smile and an encouraging
word go a lot farther than a scowl
and a discouraging one;
• If you're about to explode, go
away for a little while so you don't
hurt something or someone;
• Ice cream always helps;
• So does having someone to talk
to who will just listen and nod occa
sionally;
• It's impossible to please every
one; and
• As much of yourself as you
invest in a place, there's always a
time to leave.
It's often the "little" things that
make the biggest difference. And
though they sound simple, some of
these lessons are the hardest to
learn.
I'd like to thank the staff of Vol
ume 199 for learning along with
me. They've invested a great deal
of time and energy in this organi
zation and that commitment is
what keeps us among the best col
lege newspapers in the country.
