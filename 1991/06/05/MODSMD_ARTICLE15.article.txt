## Seeking middle ground 
### 
"The middle ground seems to have disap
peared as a consequence of ideological
fracas and polarization; whether it can be
restored is an open question."
— Dinesh D'Souza

During my four years at
Stanford, significant changes have
taken place that will shape the
future of American society — a growing
recognition of the importance of non-
Western and non-white cultures, a real
ization that sexual assault happens more
often in the dorm room than off the jog
ging path and an emphasis on the values
of a drug-free and alcohol-safe society.
For better or for worse, national poli
tics have invaded our college campuses
and classrooms, while campus politics
often find their way into the national
media.
Ironically, while all this change has
taken place, many students, faculty and
media observers have lamented the gen
eral lack of student activism on this
nation's campuses. The polarized debate
between the "racist, insensitive" ele
ments and the "politically correct" forces
has largely alienated and stifled all but
the loudest voices at both extremes of
campus politics.
In the midst of these changes, we have
witnessed a continuing loss of two middle
grounds — the middle ground between
conservatism and liberalism, and the
middle ground between thought and
action. Much has been made of the for
mer, but the closely related tension
between the latter concepts has been

largely ignored.
Throughout our education, we are
taught two basic principles: Think before
you act, and act on your convictions.
Unfortunately, the two concepts are often
perceived as a being connected by a linear
equation, assuming that thought will lead
to an unchanging conviction that can be
acted upon until the ultimate objective is
achieved. Once a conviction is formu
lated, thought ends and action begins.
This linear assumption has fostered
much of the polarization of campus
debate in the past four years. Instead of
an open dialogue complete with ongoing
thought and reflection, the campus is left
with dueling monologues that only try to
win over those left in the middle. Com
plex social and political issues are simpli
fied to the point where even Ronald Rea
gan would understand them.
Unfortunately, the campus' vocal and
active groups often work to stifle the
more thoughtful middle ground, which, if
given the chance, would often provide the
better insight. Although the thought of
such compromise is typically considered
as "selling out" or "watering down" cer
tain principles, the political extremists
usually need to oversimplify the issues
themselves to arrive at their convictions.
Why is this tension between thought
and action so important? Well, if Stan
ford's "thoughtful" political debates can
not accept and understand complex issues
and opinions, how can we expect national
policy-makers to recognize and under
stand the complexities of the issues they
face?
Over 150 years ago, the great political

scholar Alexis de Tocqueville made the
following observation: "In the United
States, the majority undertakes to supply
a multitude of ready-made opinions for
the use of individuals, who are thus
relieved from the necessity of forming
opinions of their own."
Stanford students and staff try to be
more enlightened and individualistic than
the masses described by de Tocqueville,
attempting to derive their own theses on
the multitude of issues they face — on
and off campus. Unfortunately, given the
time constraints of the human condition,
many of their opinions fall victim to the
thoughtlessness and simplicity they are
trying to avoid.
Without the time for thoughtful dis
cussion and formulation of ideas, rhetoric
triumphs over reason. Thirty-second
sound bites and one-sentence opinions
win out over hour-long news programs
and book-length treatises.
The issues facing Stanford and the
nation demand more than simple state
ments of ideology. The problems and solu
tions to issues of multiculturalism, sexual
assault and drug abuse are more complex
than our forums for dealing with them
have allowed. It's time to seek a middle
ground.
