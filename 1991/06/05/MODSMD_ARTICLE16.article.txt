Internal problems caused downfall of People 's Platform

TN THE MAY 29 DAILY, the People's
Platform insisted, once again, that
jl. their fall from power was a result of
the fact that students, for some reason,
do not understand the party.
When will the People's Platform fig
ure out that the problem lies with the
party itself, and not with the student
body?
Stanford students are not stupid.
Anyone even remotely interested in cam
pus politics knows exactly what the Peo
ple's Platform has done, and that is pre
cisely why they lost the last election.
The People's Platform has been
responsible for some needed changes on
this campus over the last four years, and
most people realize this. However, it has
also been responsible for myriad actions
contrary to the will of its constituents.

For example, the party's breach of faith
when it promised to be accountable to
the students, and then voted contrary to
the results of every straw poll taken by
The Daily, seems a betrayal of the stu
dents' trust. Its worst offense, however,
was probably its refusal to hold a runoff
election because, as then-Council of
Presidents member Ingrid Nava told me
last year, "We didn't think it would be
democratic."
Even though I agree with many of the
People's Platform's stated goals, I cannot
support such actions. We, the student
body, are not children to be told what is
democratic by Those Who Know in the
People's Platform. When the students
said they did not approve of the new dis
tribution requirements, or ASSU action

on non-campus issues, or holding a
runofT election, or the new fee refund
policy, or granting MEChA, a Chicano/
Latino student group, a second vote,
THEY MEANT IT!
It is unbelievably arrogant of the Peo
ple's Platform to declare that our opin
ions all stem from ignorance and should
therefore be discarded. Do they ever stop
to think that perhaps the students are
right, and they are (gasp) wrong? Or is it
that they believe that straw polls have so
little validity that they should be ignored
in all cases?
I sometimes have to admire the
party's unshakable faith in its own wis
dom; so unshakable that it enables them
to claim all those who do not think as
they do are merely uninformed. Of

course, I can only do so after my con
tempt subsides to the point where I have
ceased throwing up on the description of
the People's Platform's latest abuse of
student trust.
Until the People's Platform realizes
that its own misconduct, rather than
student misunderstanding, is responsible
for the its defeat, the party will not
mend its ways. I fear that until it does,
the progressive movement at Stanford
that has been responsible for so much
needed change will be forced to watch
some of its hardest workers and most
fervent supporters continue to get
slammed in the polls.
