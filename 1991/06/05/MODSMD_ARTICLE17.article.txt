# Student will wear a loaded backpack to protest Reges' firing
## 
### 
During Commencement I will be
wearing my backpack over my gradua
tion robe. I will be doing this to show my
disapproval of the University's firing of
Stuart Reges and to encourage other stu
dents — and people in general — to
think about the issues involved.
In addition, I will be carrying alcohol
in my backpack, though I am under 21
years old. I will do this to show my disre
spect for both the University's drug and
alcohol policy and our government's
enforcement of the war on drugs.
I invite everyone at Commencement
to wear backpacks as a protest of the fir
ing of Reges. I do not advocate breaking
the law (I don't plan to drink the alco
hol), but I do encourage any form of
protest that you feel appropriate.
I also encourage everyone to look at

the issues involved. This incident is not
about a Stanford professor talking him
self out of a job; it is about a government
willing to nullify the Bill of Rights in
order to fight a losing war.
Did you know that the Drug Enforce
ment Agency is asking stores that sell
grow-lamps (indoor lamps used to grow
plants) to provide the addresses of the
people who buy them? Did you know that
a man was recently put in jail for 10
years because a hitchhiker he picked up
was carrying drugs? Did you know that
$1 million worth of fraternity housing
was seized at University of Virginia
because $300 worth of drugs were found,
and no one has even been found guilty in
court? And these are only samples of our
government's actions.
If you find these examples disturbing,
I urge you to look into the issues. There
is no excuse, even drugs, for taking away
this many of our rights. And this is why I
will be disrupting Commencement and
breaking the law.
