# New presidents could have easily called old COP for keys to office
## 
### 
The news just ain't what it used to be.
The Daily's May 29 story about giving
the incoming Council of Presidents our
(the current COP) keys to the COP office
was frivolous at best, politically loaded at
worst. Here's our side of the story:
The ASSU Bylaws state that the new
COP assumes office on the ninth Mon
day of spring quarter. We were under the
impression that the ninth Monday was
June 3, since the quarter began on a
Tuesday. But that is beside the point.
If there were a discrepancy about that
Monday, or even if the new COP wanted
to have access to the office before the
ninth Monday, we would have worked
something out with them — all they had
to do was talk to us about it.
Not one of the new COP called any of

the old COP about this. A simple phone
call would have been the simple solution.
From the article, it appears that we
are the "spiteful" last stalwarts of the
People's Platform, clawing for a hold on
power to the last. That's simply not true,
and John Overdeck knows that.
After a bitter election, he and I were
able to work together with the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault to build multi
party support for the ASSU Sexual
Assault Prevention, Education and
Response Office, an effort which resulted
in an unprecedented unanimous decision
in its favor.
So why didn't he just call? He knew
my number!
To set the record straight, we've
turned in our keys. Our work as COP is
done, and the four of us are ready to
move on. May we never again be wrongly
accused of — fill in the blank — by The
Daily. Hallelujah!
