# The 						Year in Letters
## FALL 
### 
Editor s note: The Daily
received hundreds of letters
this past year as members of the
Stanford community shared
their perspectives with our
readers.
Without a doubt, the war in
the Persian Gulf will forever be
etched in our minds; other,

milder controversies such as
that surrounding the Yell lead
ers will, if they haven't already,
vanish from our thoughts.
Hut so as not to play
favorites, we offer below a look
back at a sampling of all the
concerns that moved people to
write to The Daily this year.

October 1
I have never been more
ashamed to be a Stanford student
than I was at Saturday's football
game against San Jose State. I'm
not talking about the performance
of the football team. I'm not talk
ing about the performance of the
Beach Boys. What is it that chills
my soul?
You guessed it, the Stanford
Yell Leaders. Or, should I say, the
S-T-A-N-O-R-D (sic) Yell Leaders.
A fine example of a bad idea gone
wrong and then turned malig
nant.

Why is it Stanford, or at least a
portion of its students and resi
dent assistants, believes it is
exempt from the laws of the
United States?
I implore Stanford policy-mak
ers to stand strong in their
enforcements of the new alcohol
and drug policy.

Married-student housing is
just that — for married students
— not for a man and woman who
want to live together, nor a man
and a man, nor a woman and a
woman. We would have been very
upset, as would other married
couples, if we were unable to
receive married-couple housing
because it was occupied by un mar

ried heterosexual or homosexual
couples.

Senior, psychology

Stanford does not ignore the
state drinking-age law; the Uni
versity is simply confident its stu
dents can take responsibility for
their own actions. In the past, this
policy has been successful, and
Stanford students have shown
they merit this trust. Strict
enforcement of the new alcohol
policy would be contradictory and
condescending.
Garner Weng
Sophomore, computer science and
economics

It does not make sense that a
marriage certificate is seen by
many to be more important than
love in determining the validity of
a relationship. It does not make
sense that many heterosexuals
cannot or will not believe there
can be just as much love and com
mitment between two women or
two men as there can between a
man and a woman.
And it does not make sense
that young, intelligent people are
willing to let the state of Califor
nia and the U.S. government

decide what is right and what is
wrong.
Jeff Shelton
Senior, biology
October 19
If you don't agree with a law
(e.g., the state drinking-age law),
should you a) Disregard it; b)
Whine that your university won't
institute a means of circumvent
ing it; c) Obey it, but only if
there's a lot of grant money at

stake; or d) Try to change it into
something you respect?
Persons who chose a, b or c
score two points; persons who
chose d may wish to contemplate
why the hell they're at Stanford.

After one year at Stanford, I
thought nothing could shock me
anymore. I was a bit premature in
my assertion, however, for the

infamous "shower scene" in the
Oct. 18 Daily shocked me to my
shoes.
If I want to get a gander at peo
ple au naturel, I'll purchase the
appropriate magazine.

We have pledged to hold the
rate for indirect costs to no more
than 78 percent.

I do not advocate capriciously
disobeying laws.

Senior lecturer, computer science

As I see it, the responsibilities
of a student government extend
no further than student/adminis
tration/faculty relations.

The best — dare I say the most
responsible — question is not "Do
you support a war in the Middle
East?" but "Will you fight in one?"
