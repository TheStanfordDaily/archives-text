I believe an isolationist United
States is inconsistent with the
aims of those who see the United
States as a force for the protection
of human rights and the environ
ment of the world. I am tired of
the simplistic arguments pre
sented in favor of a U.S. with
drawal from the Gulf.
That U.S. soldiers may lose
their lives is an argument against
any war. It could have been used
to argue against U.S. involvement
in World War 11, as well. It
obscures the distinction between
justified and unjustified wars.
For the first time in 40 years,
U.S. troops can do some good in
the world. If not now, then never!

If we do not follow the dictates
of our inner moral compass and
stand up for human life, Saddam
Hussein's lawlessness will

threaten the peace and democracy
of the emerging new world order.
I am determined to do abso
lutely everything possible in the
search for a peaceful resolution to
this crisis — but only if this peace
is genuine, if it rests on principle,
not appeasement.
Together, we can, with our
coalition partners, assure that
this aggression is stopped and the
principles on which this nation
and the rest of the civilized world

are founded are preserved.

War in the Persian Gulf is not
the answer to the many problems
here at home. My friend Peter,
who is himself ravaged by another
war — AIDS — thinks so too, and
I, who also fight in the same
trenches with him, ask you and
the nation to reason and rethink

our options.

The Stanford administration is
losing much more than dollars in
the overhead fight. It is losing
integrity.

We all hope and pray nuclear
weapons will never be used. I
repeat, it is extremely unlikely I
could support their use. I just
would not say absolutely never.

Here on the Stanford campus
we have very safe lives: little
crime, guaranteed meals, money
in our pockets. Walking around
the campus, one does not see any
sense of urgency regarding the
war; it has been objectified,
abstracted and banished to thou
sands of miles away. It becomes
dangerously easy to support an
action whose consequences we

cannot see because of isolation
and objectivity.
However, war is not objective.
Stanford Students for Peace in the
Middle East seeks only to remind
Stanford through the die-ins that
a life lost is a life lost, regardless of
what country it occurs in or the
nationality of those killed.

I'm mad. Mad as hell. It's
absurd — $17,500 for a wedding
picked up by the University
Even if a lot of big donors
showed up at the reception, it cer
tainly wasn't the government's
bar tab. I know many research
labs on campus that would fight
very hard for a mere fraction of
that booze bill.

I find it very troubling that
Stanford Students for Peace in the
Middle East held a massive two
day teach-in and completely
skewed the teach-in so that only a
small percentage of programs pre

sented the pro-U.S. view.
I find it regrettable that some
very insightful Stanford profes
sors do not share their wisdom
because they fear heckling and
unpopularity.

I found it distressing to read in
The Daily's article announcing
the selection of John Gardner as
the 1991 Commencement speaker
that some students wanted more
of a "name" speaker.
It is hard to imagine more of a
"name" speaker than Gardner.
His many contributions to Stan
ford over the years are worthy of
recognition. It is even more diffi
cult to think of a speaker who
might have something more use
ful to say to an audience of Stan
ford graduates and parents.
To the unhappy students, I
would only say, "If you want a
'name' act for entertainment, buy
a ticket to the Circle Star Theater
or the Oakland Coliseum."
