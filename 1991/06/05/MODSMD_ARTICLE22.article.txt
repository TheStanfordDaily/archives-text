The University has made it
clear for some time now there will
be no expansion of the number of
housed fraternal groups.
Norman Robinson
Acting Dean of Student Affairs
April 1
When the University's policy
on subjectively selective housing
was adopted in 1982, there were
13 subjectively selective housed
fraternities, which constituted
10.6 percent of available housing
space. Currently, there are only 10
housed fraternities, which occupy
only 8.2 percent of housing
spaces. Thus the University policy
clearly indicates that more housed
fraternities should be permitted
on campus.

Some say Stanford students

are apathetic; I don't believe
them. Every student is intelligent;
every student cares about some
thing. Together, let's accept the
challenge to probe, to question, to
reconcile, to be not just a critic but
a critical thinker, and to not abdi
cate our responsibility to think
and to act on our beliefs.

In a recent public appearance,
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, looking
for a term to describe "typical"
sexists, arrived at the phrase "frat
boys." No one objected to his word
choice; no one questioned his gen
eralization.
Indeed, it is a fact that many
fraternity boys are sexist. It is also
a fact that an astounding propor
tion of black people are criminals.
Most people at Stanford, however,
do not choose to infer that all
black people are criminals; to do
so would be unfair to those who
are not.
Grey's terminology and his
audience's acceptance of it were
not out of the ordinary. The same
Stanford community that abhors

racial discrimination condones —
even encourages — discrimination
against fraternity and sorority
men and women.

[To University President Don
ald Kennedy:! What is Stanford's
image under your leadership? It is
that of a venal university caught,
red-handed, robbing the Ameri
can people. It is that of a univer
sity that cares more about getting
every last dollar than about moral
issues.
Surely you can see Stanford
desperately needs someone new to
come in and help us restore our
reputation. Surely you can see
that in the best interests of Stan
ford, you should resign.
John Manley
Professor, political science

University President Donald
Kennedy has not only led Stan
ford through an incredibly suc
cessful Centennial fund-raising
campaign; he has also masterfully
articulated a new focus on public

service at Stanford. He has led the
University through the difficult
issues of curriculum reform and
financial restructuring.
At a time when all major
research universities are facing
fiscal difficulties, we look forward
to Kennedy's leadership.
The personal attacks made on
Kennedy should not be miscon
strued as either having any merit
or being widely shared.

Does Stuart Reges suggest
altering the Cultures, Ideas and
Values curriculum to include
drug-induced poetry from
Coleridge and the Grateful Dead?
Or, since he proclaims, "my drug
experiences have been some of the
most important in my spiritual
and intellectual development,"
should resident assistants lead
their residents from glue-sniffing
to tequila shots and on to peyote?
Perhaps Reges himself could
serve as the resident fellow for a
new "Barbiturate Theme House."

MEChA should get its funding
without having to go through any
election process. Democracy is no
magic cure for our social prob
lems; it can also be the source of
our trouble in another guise, the
tyranny of the majority.
Rudolfo Ruiz
Graduate student, Stanford Law
School

May 16
I consider Stuart Reges to be
one of my heroes. In an age when
many of our leaders and educators
fail to reach for the sky and
instead grasp mediocrity, it is
refreshing to see someone willing
to take a stand and live his life
honestly and openly.
