# Science
## From bacteria to biochips, interns run the scientific gamut 
### Lisa Goldman Staff writer 
While soaking up sunshine might be
some students' only plans for this sum
mer, others are setting higher goals for
their vacation. Instead of working on
their tans, these students will be working
in laboratories and — hopefully — dis
covering the secrets of the universe.
Although a summer internship might
appear to be the instrument of an aca
demic masochist, it is, in reality, a prime
chance for students to break out of the
more restrictive atmosphere of classes,
units and grades that dominates the
quarter system.
Summer interns will be afforded the
rare opportunity to find homologues to
bacteria, map the genetic material in RNA
and work on computer programs whose
benefits include helping people solve logic
problems, allowing veterans to mentally
control prosthetic devices and "advising"
physicians on cures for patients.
The Bionic Man
Michael Min, a junior electrical engi
neering major, will try to put a nerve chip
inside the body by designing a manned
machine interface — an electronic inter
face with a peripheral nervous system. The
interface is called "manned" because a pro
cessor on the chip will alleviate the need to

relay impulses to an outside computer.
In this ongoing project, initially
designed to give veterans with prosthetic
devices more control, researchers are try
ing to learn about which materials are
compatible with the human body.
Headed by Electrical Engineering Prof.
Dr. Gregory Kovacs, the project involves
making nerves grow through holes in a
computer chip, which will read the
impulses and quantify them into electron
ic data that could be relayed to the brain.
"We're trying to build on the 'Bionic
Man' concept," Min said. "The sensors in
the limb will send feedback to the brain in
a process that is as natural as possible."
"With a connection to the brain, we
can get data more directly and precisely,
straight from the brain," Min said. "Our
ultimate goal is to build a device that will
program and reprogram itself through
the skin."
Min, who is receiving funding from
the Veterans Administration, got
involved with the project after meeting
Kovacs through his engineering classes.
AIDS workstation
In another effort to explore computer
applications to medicine, junior Richard
Chen will be working in a group that is
trying to design a workstation known as
a T-helper program. The program is to be
used by physicians in AIDS clinics.

The group °112 students — most of
whom are enrolled at the Medical
School — is led by Dr. Edward
Schortliffe, head of the Medical
School Informatics Lab, and Dr. Mark
Musen, assistant professor of
medicine. The team will create an
"information and expert system,"
which will organize doctors' medical
information and give them feedback,
or advice on treatments.
Chen, a computer science major,
became involved in the project
because, "I wanted to do something
with computers in medicine.
"With so much paperwork, doctors
are badly organized . . . it's hard to
access information. The work station
will allow them to enter information
into a computer, organize it and
receive meaningful feedback and
treatment advice."
Still another computer program
mer, symbolic systems major Ken Nor
man, will work on a program called
Hyperproof 11, a reasoning tool built
to help people solve logic problems.
Norman, a junior, will design an
interface that will model logic prob
lems on a computer screen by using
symbols to represent components of
the problems.
Hyperproof I, an already-developed
program, operates on the same concept

but deals with
easier prob
lems. Hyper-

proof II will be
"something you
can carry around
in the future," pre
dicted Norman.
"It's a pocket
reasoner that can
include pictures as
steps to a proof."
Hyperproof II
will mesh visual
representation
with other prob
lem-solving abili
ties. This combi
nation is especially
helpful with math
ematical proofs,
which would take
too much time if
entirely written
out.
"Including pic
tures as part of the
proof reduces it to
10 or so steps,"
Norman said.
Norman became
involved in the pro
ject because I'm
interested in
human problem
solving and would
like to delve into a

big project by spending a whole summer
doing one thing in tremendous detail."
E. Coli homologues
Some students, like junior Barbara
Shang, will simply be continuing current
research that they began much earlier.
This summer, Shang will work with Dr.
Ho Gun Rhie and Dr. Abdul Matin on a
project for her senior honors thesis that
began two years ago.
Shang, a microbiology major, is study
ing a gene called spoOA found in the bac
teria Bacillus subtilis. In B. subtilis, the
gene is essential for sporulation, a differ
entiation process involving cells'
response to stresses such as deprivation
of carbon, phosphorus or nitrogen. While
spoOA responds to harsh conditions by
forming spores, E. coli — another bacte
rial species commonly studied by biolo
gists — does not.
Shang will be studying genetic similar
ities — called "homologues" — between
genes in the two species of bacteria. She
will try to prove her hypothesis that E.
coli possesses certain genes resembling
spoOA, and that these homologues are
critical to the stress response of E. coli.
Viral genetics
Another student — with the help of
Dr. Harry Greenberg and Dr. Suzanne
Matsui of the Department of Medicine,

Gastroenterology Division — will
attempt to map the genome of a small
RNA virus.
Freshman Roger Lo plans to accom
plish this by first cloning the virus, which
involves using a partial sequence to make
a complementary DNA probe that will
screen the genomic material of the virus.
After identifying many segments at
different locations in the genome, Lo will
map the order, sequence and location of
these segments using restriction enzyme
analysis and partial sequencing.
Finally, he will sequence every
nucleotide, or unit of genetic material, in
the genome.
Lo became involved in his year-long
research after working in the division of
gastroenterology at the UC-Irvine Col
lege of Medicine during his last two years
of high school.

For those of you who still haven't
changed your summer plans from restful
vacations to laboratory experiments, rest
assured that others will assume your
neglected burden of intellectual pursuit.
By next September, these science interns
might have solved quite a few of the
world's mysteries.
And, just as a little more encourage
ment, keep in mind that you can't get
sunburned in a lab.

Microbiology major Barbara Shang will be continuing research on the senior honors thesis that she
began two years ago. Shang will be studying similarities between the genetic material of E. coli bacte
ria and that of other bacterial species. The specific genes under examination influence bacterial
responses to starvation and stress.

This summer, junior Richard Chen will be working with a research group at the Stan
ford Medical School Informatics Lab. The group is developing a computer network that
will help physicians at AIDS clinics organize their medical information and obtain feed
back about treatments.
