# Bug says farewell on a self-referential note
## Social hymenoptera draw her attention in final installment 
### Nancy Volkers Staff writer 
Here I sit, getting ready to finish my last
quarter at Stanford (of the whopping three 1
was here), writing my last Science Bug at the
last possible moment before Chris [Editor's
note: She means me.] comes breathing down
my neck with his fire-breathing iguana set on
"stun." ■*
Iguanas don't really breathe fire, in case
you're one of the more impressionable mem
bers of the audience. This column has been
rated G by the Motion Picture Association of
America. All material will be explained for the
densest reader, in hopes that no one will mis
construe anything or — God forbid — Not Get
The Joke.
People don't realize how difficult it is to
write these things. The hardest part is getting
the energy to make the big jump from the "N"
key to the "A" key (Remember, I'm a tiny,
defenseless ladybug, not a grasshopper or any
thing else remotely powerful or intimidating.)
Oh, but ladybugs fiy. So I could simply flit
from key to key, couldn't I? Damn. Another
attempt at humor shot down by the unfailing
rules of logical analysis (a word that, if I may
be so blunt, contains the letters ANAL).
All of you who are thinking, "Hey, she
hasn't said anything scientific yet. She hasn't
even introduced a topic," are right. Boy, are
you quick. Yow.
I was going to answer all the questions I'd
received that I hadn't answered as of this
week, as shortly and as sweetly as possible.
Then I realized that for me, that would take up
about half the Daily. (I'd probably spend a
good 500 words just berating the person who
asked me why the colors on the television do
strange things when you hold a magnet up to
the set. "Get a life" is overused, but it seems
appropriate.)
My topic, then, is bugs, seeing as I am one,
or operate under the guise of one in any case.
Besides, bugs rule the earth. Seventy percent
of all animal species on Earth are insects. (Of
course, we only know about a fifth of the
species on the planet, so there are probably a
lot more out there just waiting for us to slack
off a little. Watch out.)
There are more bugs than anything else,
and (speaking as a human, now) we can't con
trol them, and it pisses us off. (Well, we can
control them, but we wind up killing off other
things and giving ourselves diseases, some of
whicn make people think the San Francisco
Giants still have a shot at doing something
this year.)
Social insects are the most interesting (and

this is a big admission for me, since ladybugs
are not social and I am, in a way, rejecting my
own biology . . . but that's another story).
Lewis Thomas, noted science essayist and co
inventor of the Thomas' English Muffin once
wrote an essay with Danny Thomas (that's a
joke) on social insects. He pointed out that a
social insect works more like a cell in a larger
organism than as an actual autonomous bug.
Being an autonomous bug myself (except
for those rare occasions when something goes
wrong with my car), I can say that he's cer
tainly got a point.
Social insects include termites and a fun
group called hymenopterants — which sounds
vaguely like a reproductive system function
but just means ants, wasps and bees.
"Hymenoptera" means "membrane-winged,"
and yeah, not all ants have wings, but not all
humans have hair, so let's not squabble about
petty definitions.
These insects weren't always social. Social
ization evolved just like everything else. In
fact, most species of bees and wasps are still
solitary, and the other species are in varying
stages of socialization, llmm, kind of like
Stanford. ...
(That was not meant to be offensive. It was
meant to be a pithy and insightful illustration
of campus life.)

Of course, we never hear about the solitary
bees and wasps, because they don't have a
good public relations officer to take care of
things for them. They just build nests, lay
eggs, leave some food for the kids and take off
forever. (Don't worry, they never make it to the
sun-drenched beaches of Bermuda — they die
instead. I get all misty-eyed just thinking
about it.)
Termites, ants and the more popular
species of bees and wasps are "eusocial," which
just means "social," but scientists like to think
they're smarter than other people, so they do
things like add superfluous prefixes and eat
food that is really bad for them so they can
prove that nutrition is all an enormous hoax
perpetrated by the yogurt companies.
(That too was a joke. I don't want any irate
biology professors calling me in the middle of
the night. Laugh a little. Live a little.)
Queenship is the most interesting part of
insect society. That's just my very humble and
individual opinion, but then again, I'm writing
the column. Queenship is not genetically
determined; the difference between the queen
and her subjects rests with the substances
they are fed during the larval stage. (It's possi
ble to use the "you are what you eat" line here,
but it's so banal I'm ashamed I even thought
of it.)
Queen bees, as an example, are raised in
special cells that are larger than regular cells.
They become queens because they are fed a
more nutritious diet that's higher in protein
than other larvae, who basically get a lot of
honey (which is a carbohydrate).
More than one queen is groomed, just to
make sure at least one larva will survive. If
more than one survives, they fight to the
death. (Hopefully only one of them dies, of
course.)
When the queen emerges, she exerts influ
ence over the colony by emitting pheromones,
one of which inhibits ovarian development in
all the worker bees. (The workers are all
female, and come from fertilized eggs; the
drones are all male, and come from unfertil
ized eggs.) This pheromone prevents any of
the workers from getting fertilized on the sly
and perhaps producing a rival queen.
If the queen dies, gets lost or moves to New
Jersey, workers will enlarge some cells to form
queen cells, and the larvae in those cells are
fed the special diet and groomed for queen
dom.

Nancy Volkers wants to know what kind of
diet Queen Elizabeth was fed as a child. There
are no more Science Bugs this year, so don't
send her any more questions.

drones are all male, and come from unfertil
ized eggs.) This pheromone prevents any of
the workers from getting fertilized on the sly
and perhaps producing a rival queen.
If the queen dies, gets lost or moves to New
Jersey, workers will enlarge some cells to form
queen cells, and the larvae in those cells are
fed the special diet and groomed for queen
dom.

Nancy Volkers wants to know what kind of
diet Queen Elizabeth was fed as a child. There
are no more Science Bugs this year, so don't
send her any more questions.

Here I sit, getting ready to finish my last
quarter at Stanford (of the whopping three 1
was here), writing my last Science Bug at the
last possible moment before Chris [Editor's
note: She means me.] comes breathing down
my neck with his fire-breathing iguana set on
"stun." ■*
Iguanas don't really breathe fire, in case
you're one of the more impressionable mem
bers of the audience. This column has been
rated G by the Motion Picture Association of
America. All material will be explained for the
densest reader, in hopes that no one will mis
construe anything or — God forbid — Not Get
The Joke.
People don't realize how difficult it is to
write these things. The hardest part is getting
the energy to make the big jump from the "N"
key to the "A" key (Remember, I'm a tiny,
defenseless ladybug, not a grasshopper or any
thing else remotely powerful or intimidating.)
Oh, but ladybugs fiy. So I could simply flit
from key to key, couldn't I? Damn. Another
attempt at humor shot down by the unfailing
rules of logical analysis (a word that, if I may
be so blunt, contains the letters ANAL).
All of you who are thinking, "Hey, she
hasn't said anything scientific yet. She hasn't
even introduced a topic," are right. Boy, are
you quick. Yow.
I was going to answer all the questions I'd
received that I hadn't answered as of this
week, as shortly and as sweetly as possible.
Then I realized that for me, that would take up
about half the Daily. (I'd probably spend a
good 500 words just berating the person who
asked me why the colors on the television do
strange things when you hold a magnet up to
the set. "Get a life" is overused, but it seems
appropriate.)
My topic, then, is bugs, seeing as I am one,
or operate under the guise of one in any case.
Besides, bugs rule the earth. Seventy percent
of all animal species on Earth are insects. (Of
course, we only know about a fifth of the
species on the planet, so there are probably a
lot more out there just waiting for us to slack
off a little. Watch out.)
There are more bugs than anything else,
and (speaking as a human, now) we can't con
trol them, and it pisses us off. (Well, we can
control them, but we wind up killing off other
things and giving ourselves diseases, some of
whicn make people think the San Francisco
Giants still have a shot at doing something
this year.)
Social insects are the most interesting (and

this is a big admission for me, since ladybugs
are not social and I am, in a way, rejecting my
own biology . . . but that's another story).
Lewis Thomas, noted science essayist and co
inventor of the Thomas' English Muffin once
wrote an essay with Danny Thomas (that's a
joke) on social insects. He pointed out that a
social insect works more like a cell in a larger
organism than as an actual autonomous bug.
Being an autonomous bug myself (except
for those rare occasions when something goes
wrong with my car), I can say that he's cer
tainly got a point.
Social insects include termites and a fun
group called hymenopterants — which sounds
vaguely like a reproductive system function
but just means ants, wasps and bees.
"Hymenoptera" means "membrane-winged,"
and yeah, not all ants have wings, but not all
humans have hair, so let's not squabble about
petty definitions.
These insects weren't always social. Social
ization evolved just like everything else. In
fact, most species of bees and wasps are still
solitary, and the other species are in varying
stages of socialization, llmm, kind of like
Stanford. ...
(That was not meant to be offensive. It was
meant to be a pithy and insightful illustration
of campus life.)

Of course, we never hear about the solitary
bees and wasps, because they don't have a
good public relations officer to take care of
things for them. They just build nests, lay
eggs, leave some food for the kids and take off
forever. (Don't worry, they never make it to the
sun-drenched beaches of Bermuda — they die
instead. I get all misty-eyed just thinking
about it.)
Termites, ants and the more popular
species of bees and wasps are "eusocial," which
just means "social," but scientists like to think
they're smarter than other people, so they do
things like add superfluous prefixes and eat
food that is really bad for them so they can
prove that nutrition is all an enormous hoax
perpetrated by the yogurt companies.
(That too was a joke. I don't want any irate
biology professors calling me in the middle of
the night. Laugh a little. Live a little.)
Queenship is the most interesting part of
insect society. That's just my very humble and
individual opinion, but then again, I'm writing
the column. Queenship is not genetically
determined; the difference between the queen
and her subjects rests with the substances
they are fed during the larval stage. (It's possi
ble to use the "you are what you eat" line here,
but it's so banal I'm ashamed I even thought
of it.)
Queen bees, as an example, are raised in
special cells that are larger than regular cells.
They become queens because they are fed a
more nutritious diet that's higher in protein
than other larvae, who basically get a lot of
honey (which is a carbohydrate).
More than one queen is groomed, just to
make sure at least one larva will survive. If
more than one survives, they fight to the
death. (Hopefully only one of them dies, of
course.)
When the queen emerges, she exerts influ
ence over the colony by emitting pheromones,
one of which inhibits ovarian development in
all the worker bees. (The workers are all
female, and come from fertilized eggs; the
drones are all male, and come from unfertil
ized eggs.) This pheromone prevents any of
the workers from getting fertilized on the sly
and perhaps producing a rival queen.
If the queen dies, gets lost or moves to New
Jersey, workers will enlarge some cells to form
queen cells, and the larvae in those cells are
fed the special diet and groomed for queen
dom.
