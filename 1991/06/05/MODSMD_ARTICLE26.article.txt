# Storing your Macs shouldn't be tough
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The end of the year may not
mean much for the average fac
ulty member's computer. But
for students, what to do with
the old machine is an impor
tant concern that needs to be
addressed.
Foremost on one's mind
should be a simple question:
Where is my computer going to
be this summer and how can I
get it there safely?
Whether your Mac (or other
personal computer) is going
into storage or going on a trip,
the best way of assuring its
health is to put it back in the
box it originally came in.
Hopefully, you kept the box
and all the associated styro
foam parts. If so, it will be easy
(even for non-engineers) to fit
everything back the way it
came. A Macintosh shipped in
its original packing materials
and marked fragile should
stand up to the rigors of a
cross-country jaunt.
If you didn't keep the box
and the Mac is headed for stor
age, you're still OK. Put the
machine in a plastic box. Then
find a large box and some news
paper. Roll the paper up into
balls and start building a cradle
for the computer. The impact
absorption qualities of the
paper balls provide a nice cush
ion against shock.
Unfortunately, it might not
be protection enough to ship
the machine bv United Parcel
Service or Federal Express. If
you need to do that and don't
have your box, find someone
else's. Check around depart
ments and dormitories because
there is no substitute for gen
uine issue Apple or IBM pack
aging.
The next best thing is insur
ance, which comes fairly
cheaply when you ship. Since it

won't set you back much, don't
skimp on coverage. If you're
mailing home a $4,000 Macin
tosh Ilci, insure it for that
amount.
Final note: Be aware of the
status of your disk drives
before you ship. If you have a
hard disk, make sure you
choose "Shut Down" on your
Macintosh before you pack up.
That guarantees that the heads
on the drive will be where they
belong.
The yellow plastic things
that may have come inside your
floppy disk drives are not that
important. Put them in if you
have them, but don't lose any
sleep if you don't.

From the Mea Culpa Dept.: 1
received a letter from Chester
Rice, Microdisc manager, about
why the Bookstore wouldn't let
me hook up a hard disk to copy
System 7.0 from them.
While some of the reasons
were less than compelling,
Rice's overall logic was sound.
He explained that someone
blew out a Mac Ilci by hooking
up a hard drive and that the
proliferation of possible
devices they might encounter
would create needless confu
sion.
I don't disagree. And if my
remarks were in anyway offen
sive to the Microdisc guys, take
this as a public apology. They
do a great job and are very help
ful and knowledgeable.
