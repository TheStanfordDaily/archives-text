It was just my luck.
Actually, luck has very little to
do with it. Seldom do 19 units
mean uncontrollably orgasmic
fun, especially at this time of the
quarter when thoughts like "Gee,
I could drop that class" cross your
mind all too frequently.
All your friends who attend
other schools are having a good
deal of fun at your expense, par
ticipating in orgy after Bacchana
lian orgy, while you get ready for
your 42-page take-home linguis
tics final.
Hygiene took a back seat some
time ago.
What I'm trying to say is that
today, the Bug is going to be half
assed. That is, more half-assed
than usual. Besides, I really don't
have any questions.
Hey! Don't bitch! As a modern
day prophet, I realize many of you
center your view of the world
around my endless pursuit of
knowledge, so I'd thought we'd go
with some "Bug Fun F&cts."
(Please keep in mind that most of
these are word-of-mouth pieces of
useless information that are most
likely true but . .. hey, it's just
some good clean fun, OK?)
11 Great Conversation Pieces:
• Trinidad and Tobago is the
world's leading exporter of natu
ral asphalt;
• Cher has five tattoos;
• Willard Scott of the "Today
Show" was the first Ronald
McDonald. He was replaced,

because he was too fat, by a non-
English-speaking Hungarian
clown from the circus;
• The University of Florida at
Gainesville owns the copyright for
Gatorade;
• Most golf balls have 336 dim
ples;
• Rumor has it Jamie Lee Cur
tis is a hermaphrodite;
• The Disney character Goofy
is not a horse; rather, in his very
first appearances he was supposed
to be a decidedly racist A 1 Jol
sonesque character. That crazv
Walt;
• Over 250,000 pounds of ani
mal excrement are produced every
second in the United States; and
• Natural rye has traces of a
hallucinogen almost identical to
LSD.
I like to look at this list as a
series of answers to questions I
wish someone had asked me. Or
as a big space-filler.
Well, as my editor keeps hint
ing, this is it for me as your Bug.
However, I refuse to get mushy,
attempt to summarize, place my
"work" in a broader perspective or
yell at the campus for making fun
of me.
I mean, what is this, the
Academy Awards?
Well, in that case, I'd like to
thank the Cookie Monster, the
people who make Cornnuts, King
Friday XIII, Gavin McCloud and
the Butthole Surfers as sources of
inspiration. And most of all, I'd
like to thank the good Lord for the
Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash.
I quit.
