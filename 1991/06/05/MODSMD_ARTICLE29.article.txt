# I'm droolin' on a jet plane — I'll be back again

### Anne Hoge Staff writer 
It was just my luck. Everyone here
seems to have extraordinary tal
ents, ranging from being able to
write, star in and produce an original
spring musical, to being able to build a
model of an element out of what looks
like a Lego set. The only thing I'm
really good at is sleeping.
Sometimes my gift seems like a
curse. The problem is, I always fall
asleep when I'm not supposed to.
Worse yet, whenever I nod off I start
twitching. The '70s brought Tennis
Elbow, the '80s, Tetris Finger. I'm
looking to start a '90s fad with
Snoozer's Whiplash.
I try and curb my overt napping
tendencies by setting my clock half an
hour fast so I'm never late to class in
the morning. Usually, however, I end
up missing class completely after hit
ting man's greatest invention — the
snooze button — for an hour.
On those days when I do make it to
class, I always sit in front by the teach
ing assistants, hoping their presence
will deter me from falling asleep. That
doesn't work either. Don't be fooled by
the moron who sits in the front row
nodding and seemingly understanding
everything the professor says. It's
really me doing the whiplash thing — I
do it really quickly.
Usually, I'm able to disguise my
sleeping by acting as if I'm looking
down at my paper, concentrating on
taking notes. I think I had the blanket
pulled over my TA's eyes until the day
I left a big drool spot on her shoulder.
That's when she told me to start com
ing prepared for class.
I figured she was right, so I brought
my own pillow the next time. But I
wouldn't share my blanket, and my

teddy bear was definitely off-limits.
This year I tried sleeping in the
back of the class, too. Problem is, I got
way too comfortable and started
dreaming. It was a bad day when I
drifted off in my astronomy class dur
ing the professor's explanation of cre
ation theories. .. .
I remember dreaming that I had
slept for two months straight and was
about to miss finals.
"Oh, my God!" I shouted as I woke
with a start, grabbing on to the chairs
in front of me, pulling myself up. The
whole class started laughing.
"That's not one of the theories
we're studying in this class," the pro
fessor said. "But, if you'll stay awake,
I'll be happy to explain the others."
Completely embarrassed, I fumbled
with my zipper for a few seconds and
finally made it out of my sleeping bag,
storming out of the room.
The real trouble came when I
started sleeping on the job. Working at
a volleyball game at Burnham Pavil
ion, I got stationed at the worst place
because I was late for waking up from
a nap. My job was to sit in a chair by

the balcony stairs and check for
upstairs passes. Too bad I couldn't
even see past the soles of the shoes of
the volleyball player who stood in front
of me to watch the game. At least I got
to wear one of those cool, yellow jack
ets.
It was the first point of the match
when I started dozing off.
Almost completely asleep, I felt
someone brush past me. Quickly, I
jumped up, chasing the man and
woman up the stairs.
"Look Buddy, let me see your ID," I
said as I put my hands on my waist. A
look of surprise came over his face
while his wife shot me a piercing glare.
What, did he think I wasn't watching
or something?
He spent minutes fumbling for his
wallet, unable to produce his card. I
was just waiting for him to pull the old
"My-wife-ate-my-ID" excuse.
Then he pulled out an ID that read
"Andy Geiger, athletic director" and
had his picture on it.
I was tired and decided to let him go
on up. I'd just like to see him try that
little maneuver in Maryland.
Unfortunately, my habitual sleep
ing is not limited to the protective
seclusion of Stanford. Out in the real
world, I always manage to get stuck in
the worst places during prime sleeping
hours.
Imagine me on the red-eye flight,
just after the flight attendants crack
their whips and scream, "OK, every
one pile in. Three to a seat." (This, of
course, refers to the two large dudes
who always seem to sit on either side of
me in the ultra-econoclass.)
Here's a true-to-life example: On
one flight, after the beverage service —
water, coffee or water — was finished,
I offered to let my "neighbors" put
their drinks on my tray until a flight

attendant came to take the Dixie cups.
That way they could go to sleep.
Waking up a few hours later, I
noticed that each of them had huge
stains on their pants in their groin
areas. Turns out I had knocked both of
their cups of hot coffee on their laps
doing Snoozer's Whiplash.
Worse yet, I slept through the whole
clean-up effort.
I've even turned churches into
snoozevilles. It happened not long ago
when I visited Grandma in Ohio. The
only problem with summer visits there
is having to wake up at 3:25 Saturday
morning to start getting dressed for
Sunday morning mass.
My body still in shock, our entire
extended family entered the church
and assumed the traditional front-row
pew. The whole church rose as the
priest began the Romanian mass. As
the priest continued in his foreign
tongue, I decided to continue my sleep.
Five minutes later, when the 200 other
people sat down, I remained standing
in front of the church, nodding away.
I vaguely remember my grand
mother tugging on my skirt, trying to
get me to sit down. "Just give me a few
more minutes," I shouted as I rolled
my head over.
Some people have told me that
sleeping a lot is a sign of depression.
Let me tell you, sleeping makes me as
happy as a clam. It kind of sucks being
grown up, though. It's always morning
before I wake up in the bike racks,
realizing Dad isn't there anymore to
carry me into my room after I fall
asleep on my bike.

more minutes," I shouted as I rolled
my head over.
Some people have told me that
sleeping a lot is a sign of depression.
Let me tell you, sleeping makes me as
happy as a clam. It kind of sucks being
grown up, though. It's always morning
before I wake up in the bike racks,
realizing Dad isn't there anymore to
carry me into my room after I fall
asleep on my bike.

Just My Luck
It was just my luck. Everyone here
seems to have extraordinary tal
ents, ranging from being able to
write, star in and produce an original
spring musical, to being able to build a
model of an element out of what looks
like a Lego set. The only thing I'm
really good at is sleeping.
Sometimes my gift seems like a
curse. The problem is, I always fall
asleep when I'm not supposed to.
Worse yet, whenever I nod off I start
twitching. The '70s brought Tennis
Elbow, the '80s, Tetris Finger. I'm
looking to start a '90s fad with
Snoozer's Whiplash.
I try and curb my overt napping
tendencies by setting my clock half an
hour fast so I'm never late to class in
the morning. Usually, however, I end
up missing class completely after hit
ting man's greatest invention — the
snooze button — for an hour.
On those days when I do make it to
class, I always sit in front by the teach
ing assistants, hoping their presence
will deter me from falling asleep. That
doesn't work either. Don't be fooled by
the moron who sits in the front row
nodding and seemingly understanding
everything the professor says. It's
really me doing the whiplash thing — I
do it really quickly.
Usually, I'm able to disguise my
sleeping by acting as if I'm looking
down at my paper, concentrating on
taking notes. I think I had the blanket
pulled over my TA's eyes until the day
I left a big drool spot on her shoulder.
That's when she told me to start com
ing prepared for class.
I figured she was right, so I brought
my own pillow the next time. But I
wouldn't share my blanket, and my

teddy bear was definitely off-limits.
This year I tried sleeping in the
back of the class, too. Problem is, I got
way too comfortable and started
dreaming. It was a bad day when I
drifted off in my astronomy class dur
ing the professor's explanation of cre
ation theories. .. .
I remember dreaming that I had
slept for two months straight and was
about to miss finals.
"Oh, my God!" I shouted as I woke
with a start, grabbing on to the chairs
in front of me, pulling myself up. The
whole class started laughing.
"That's not one of the theories
we're studying in this class," the pro
fessor said. "But, if you'll stay awake,
I'll be happy to explain the others."
Completely embarrassed, I fumbled
with my zipper for a few seconds and
finally made it out of my sleeping bag,
storming out of the room.
The real trouble came when I
started sleeping on the job. Working at
a volleyball game at Burnham Pavil
ion, I got stationed at the worst place
because I was late for waking up from
a nap. My job was to sit in a chair by

the balcony stairs and check for
upstairs passes. Too bad I couldn't
even see past the soles of the shoes of
the volleyball player who stood in front
of me to watch the game. At least I got
to wear one of those cool, yellow jack
ets.
It was the first point of the match
when I started dozing off.
Almost completely asleep, I felt
someone brush past me. Quickly, I
jumped up, chasing the man and
woman up the stairs.
"Look Buddy, let me see your ID," I
said as I put my hands on my waist. A
look of surprise came over his face
while his wife shot me a piercing glare.
What, did he think I wasn't watching
or something?
He spent minutes fumbling for his
wallet, unable to produce his card. I
was just waiting for him to pull the old
"My-wife-ate-my-ID" excuse.
Then he pulled out an ID that read
"Andy Geiger, athletic director" and
had his picture on it.
I was tired and decided to let him go
on up. I'd just like to see him try that
little maneuver in Maryland.
Unfortunately, my habitual sleep
ing is not limited to the protective
seclusion of Stanford. Out in the real
world, I always manage to get stuck in
the worst places during prime sleeping
hours.
Imagine me on the red-eye flight,
just after the flight attendants crack
their whips and scream, "OK, every
one pile in. Three to a seat." (This, of
course, refers to the two large dudes
who always seem to sit on either side of
me in the ultra-econoclass.)
Here's a true-to-life example: On
one flight, after the beverage service —
water, coffee or water — was finished,
I offered to let my "neighbors" put
their drinks on my tray until a flight

attendant came to take the Dixie cups.
That way they could go to sleep.
Waking up a few hours later, I
noticed that each of them had huge
stains on their pants in their groin
areas. Turns out I had knocked both of
their cups of hot coffee on their laps
doing Snoozer's Whiplash.
Worse yet, I slept through the whole
clean-up effort.
I've even turned churches into
snoozevilles. It happened not long ago
when I visited Grandma in Ohio. The
only problem with summer visits there
is having to wake up at 3:25 Saturday
morning to start getting dressed for
Sunday morning mass.
My body still in shock, our entire
extended family entered the church
and assumed the traditional front-row
pew. The whole church rose as the
priest began the Romanian mass. As
the priest continued in his foreign
tongue, I decided to continue my sleep.
Five minutes later, when the 200 other
people sat down, I remained standing
in front of the church, nodding away.
I vaguely remember my grand
mother tugging on my skirt, trying to
get me to sit down. "Just give me a few
more minutes," I shouted as I rolled
my head over.
Some people have told me that
sleeping a lot is a sign of depression.
Let me tell you, sleeping makes me as
