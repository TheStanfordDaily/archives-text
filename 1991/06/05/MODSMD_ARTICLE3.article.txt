# Neurosurgeon resigns over 'pervasive sexism'
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford is once again bearing the brunt
of negative national publicity — and this
time it involves the School of Medicine.
In the wake of the resignation of a
prominent female neurosurgeon, Medical
School administrators are now responding
to charges of "pervasive sexism throughout
the entire environment."
Dr. Frances Coniey, who first came to
Stanford 25 years ago as an intern, offi
cially announced her resignation May 23
but did not come forward with charges of
sexual harassment until last Friday.
"I resigned because the behavior of a
person promoted to chairman of my depart
ment has characteristics rooted 25 years
ago," Coniey said. "He devalues women
and, for that matter, anyone whom he per-

ceives to be inferior."
At a press conference
Monday afternoon, Dr.
David Korn, vice president
and dean of the Medical
School, said Conley
resigned after he told her
that Dr. Gerald Silverberg
— the current acting chair
of the neurosurgery
department — would be

promoted to the permanent position. The
decision was made after a national search
for a new chair had to be terminated due to
budgetary constraints.
Silverberg could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
"I was distressed and accepted her resig
nation with a great deal of regret," Korn


Coniey
said. "These charges (of sexual
harassment) came as much as a
surprise to me as others. She had
not previously mentioned it to
me."
But Conley said yesterday that
she had expressed her concerns to
Korn before and felt that the
recent appointment would under
mine the goals of the University.
"If indeed this University
wants to promote the goal of a cli
mate for all students to learn and
(where) they are equal, then it
should not put people who
devalue women in positions of
authority," Conley said. "It
validates his behavioral pattern
and makes him a role model."
Conley refused to identify Sil
verberg by name because it is "a
more general problem" than just
in the neurosurgery department.
She also said she has no interest
in becoming the department chair
and never asked to be considered
for it.
She added that the devaluing of
women "is a pervasive, insidious
problem that is present in every
medical school."
"It is also probably present in
business schools and law schools
too. But I bet that it is less of a
problem in undergraduate
schools," Conley added.
In a viewpoint published yes
terday in the San Francisco
Chronicle, Conley noted several
examples of harassment, includ
ing the use of "slides of Playboy
centerfolds to 'spice up' lectures,"
frequent sexist comments, and
"unsolicited touching and

fondling."
Conley said yesterday that
when a male surgeon enters an
operating room and calls the
women "honey," it changes the
control structure necessary for
surgery.
"It is demeaning to operating
room nurses, who are treated like
handmaidens. It also sets all
women in the operating room as
being equal," even when a female
surgeon should be in control, Con
ley said.
Korn said he was "unaware of
any specific claim of inappropriate
sexual behavior" by Conley and
said only two complaints of sexual
harassments have been filed dur
ing his seven years as dean. One
case was resolved and the other is
currently being reviewed by Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy.
At Monday's press conference,
Korn admitted that "stereotypes
do exist" within the medical pro
fession and "inappropriate behav
ior needs to be cleansed."
"I believe that the medical pro
fession is undergoing a unique
change in terms of its demo
graphic composition," Korn said.
"There is a move away from the
male domination . . . and a good
deal of work needs to be done. "
Korn added that a small com
mittee of the Medical School Fac
ulty Senate has been created to
formalize the complaint process
for sexual harassment and make
it more "hospitable." The chair of
the committee is Dr. Charlotte
Jacobs, senior associate dean for
education and student affairs at
the Medical School.
Conley, who is chair of the sen
ate, said she will continue to help

the committee until Sept. 1, but
added it would be "self-defeating"
for her to stay because she is "so
unhappy."
Others within the Medical
School expressed doubts about
the effectiveness of any change in
the way harassment incidents are
reported.
One female member of the
dean's office who asked not to be
identified said she "hears com
plaints every day, but people are
afraid to express them to the
dean."
"The staff management of the
office is almost completely male,
and women will not talk or com
plain to them because their jobs
are at stake," she said.
Others within the Medical
School supported Conley's allega
tions of "pervasive sexual harass
ment." For instance, one female
physician, who asked not to be
identified, said, "Sexism is some
times subtle, but it is definitely
there."
Most added that it is a problem
not limited to Stanford Medical
School and is one that "must be
solved throughout society."
Within the medical school, 50
percent of the students and 15
percent of the faculty are women,
Korn said. The national aveiage
for female faculty is about 25 per
cent.
"We have added intensity to
our efforts to identify women can
didates," Korn said. "It is a mat
ter of high priority for us."
Jacobs said she "hoped this
would not have a negative
impact" on women choosing
medicine as a career or choosing
to pursue their careers at Stan
ford.
