# Neurosurgeon resigns over 'pervasive sexism'
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford is once again bearing the brunt
of negative national publicity — and this
time it involves the School of Medicine.
In the wake of the resignation of a
prominent female neurosurgeon, Medical
School administrators are now responding
to charges of "pervasive sexism throughout
the entire environment."
Dr. Frances Coniey, who first came to
Stanford 25 years ago as an intern, offi
cially announced her resignation May 23
but did not come forward with charges of
sexual harassment until last Friday.
"I resigned because the behavior of a
person promoted to chairman of my depart
ment has characteristics rooted 25 years
ago," Coniey said. "He devalues women
and, for that matter, anyone whom he per-

ceives to be inferior."
At a press conference
Monday afternoon, Dr.
David Korn, vice president
and dean of the Medical
School, said Conley
resigned after he told her
that Dr. Gerald Silverberg
— the current acting chair
of the neurosurgery
department — would be

promoted to the permanent position. The
decision was made after a national search
for a new chair had to be terminated due to
budgetary constraints.
Silverberg could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
"I was distressed and accepted her resig
nation with a great deal of regret," Korn


Coniey
