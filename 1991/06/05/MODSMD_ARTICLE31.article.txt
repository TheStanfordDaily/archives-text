## McCarty heads list of Cardinal baseball draftees 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
If the results of this week's
Mcyor League draft are any indi
cation, Stanford baseball coach
mark Marquess is going to be
doing a lot of sweating this sum
mer.
In the first two days, three Car
dinal juniors and four high school
seniors who have committed to
attend Stanford were selected
high in the draft. A total of five
players who helped the Cardinal
to its 39-23 record this year were
taken in the draft, led by David
McCarty.
The junior first baseman was
the third pick overall, selected by
the Minnesota Twins. The Base
ball America National Player of
the Year told the Peninsula Times
Tribune, "I'm really happy. I'm
ready to get things going. ... I
think (the Twins) are going to be
fair with me," in negotiating a
contract.
McCarty led the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division with 24
home runs, a .420 batting average
and an .828 slugging percentage.
He had 66 RBI and scored 71
runs.
McCarty is eligible to return
for his senior season but will likely
receive a good offer from the pro
fessional club. Also in the position
of having to decide what to do are
juniors Roger Burnett and Troy
Tallman. All three Stanford play
ers were together on the U.S.

national team last summer.
Burnett, the Cardinal's start
ing shortstop, was chosen in the
19th round by the New York Yan
kees. Burnett hit .315 with 13
home runs, 51 RBI and 49 runs
scored. He has a .957 fielding per
centage and is regarded as a very
good defensive player with a great
arm.
Tallman, the Cardinal catcher,
went nabbed in the 21st round by
the Baltimore Orioles. He hit .235
with six homers, 32 RBI and 30
runs scored. He didn't have as
good of an offensive year as he did
last season but was excellent
defensively. He threw out about
half of all runners attempting to
steal on him this year.
Senior pitchers Scott Weiss and
Jeff Light were also selected.
Weiss was the second current
Stanford player chosen, going in
the 10th round to the Chicago
Cubs. He has been the Cardinal's
bullpen ace the past two years and
was an all-Six-Pac selection this
year.
His seven saves this year puts
him fifth in the single-season list
ings in the Cardinal recordbook
and his 17 career saves is the sec
ond-best figure in school history.
His career average of 9.63 strike
outs per nine innings is fifth in
school history. He was 8-7 with a
3.77 ERA this season.
Light was a surprise pick of the
Oakland A's in the 13th round.
Light has served mostly as a util
ity infielder during his Stanford

career but was drafted as a
pitcher.
But it was his fastball that
impressed the A's. He only
pitched one-third of an inning for
the Cardinal this season, giving
up one hit and no runs, but Oak
land feels he can find a spot along
side their other outstanding
young pitchers.
Incoming freshmen Shawn
Estes and Shawn Green were also
selected in the first round. Estes,
a left-handed pitcher from Min
den, Nev., was taken by the Seat
tle Mariners as the 11th pick over
all. Green, an outfielder from
Tustin, Calif., was tabbed by the
Toronto Blue Jays as the 16th
choice overall.
Pitcher Scott Pisciotta of Mari
etta, Ga., was taken in the second
round by the Montreal Expos and
infielder/pitcher Todd Laßoca of
Atlanta, Ga., was taken by the Los
Angeles Dodgers in the third
round.
All four players have the choice
of signing with the big league
team or enrolling at Stanford. All
four were on Baseball America's
list of the nation's top 25 high
school prospects and if they all
come, Stanford will have the
nation's top class of recruits.
The Cardinal advanced to
regional play for the 10th time in
the last 11 seasons this year. Stan
ford beat San Diego State and
Miami at the regional but lost
twice to Fresno State to be elimi
nated.
