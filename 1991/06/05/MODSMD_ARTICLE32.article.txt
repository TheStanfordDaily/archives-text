# Track puts on fine show at NCAAs
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Staff writer 
This year the Stanford track team
strived to become a stronger dual-meet
team. While they accomplished that
they also proved the squad has star
quality.
Out of the six Cardinal standouts
who traveled to Eugene, Ore. for the
NCAA Championships, five returned as
Ail-Americans. The women scored 17
points; the men tallied seven.
The progress the team has made is
evident when these stats are compared
to last year's. Four became All-Ameri
cans then but the team only managed
three points.
Leading the Cardinal was junior
jumper Jackie Edwards. She started the
season as a solid Pacific 10 Conference
performer and ended it a national star.
Her best leap prior to this year was 20
feet, 8 inches. At NCAAs she soared 21
feet, Bs/*8 s /* inches, an improvement of over
a foot in one season.
Her jump earned her second place;

the highest finishing Stanford competi
tor. The victor was Diane Guthrie, a
freshman from George Mason. She
passed Edwards with a 21-foot, 10-inch
leap.
The NCAAs capped off a terrific sea
son for Edwards. She helped the Cardi
nal women's team to an undefeated
dual-meet season with a 21-point per
formance in Big Meet. The Pac-10 triple
jump title belongs to the psychology
major who hails from Nassau, Bahamas.
She also claimed second in the long
jump in the conference meet.
The All-American will enter her
senior campaign as a national threat in
both the triple and the long jumps. She
hopes to make the Bahamian Olympic
team next summer. Considering the pro
gress she's made this season that goal
appears in reach.
Placing third in the 100 meters was
Edwards' friend and training partner,
Chryste Gaines. The two-time Pac-10
champion won both her heats in the pre
liminaries and the semifinals. She
proved her consistency in the final by

running an 11.11-second race. Her prior
times were 11.10 and 11.09. All the
races were wind-aided.
"I was pleased with all my perfor
mances," Gaines said. Her previous best
was 11.28.
Unfortunately her opponents were
not as consistent After running an 11-
plus first heat Texas' Carlette Guidry
blitzed the final with a 10.91. LSU's
Esther Jones, the 1990 titlist, finished
second with a 10.99.
"They had better starts. I don't think
my start was good but I came on pretty
well. My end was better (than theirs),"
Gaines said.
Gaines made the finals of the 200 but
did not run. She will compete at The
Athletics Congress national champi
onships this summer and hopes to make
either the Pan Am team or qualify for
the World University Games. Gaines
will be the favorite next year to win the
NCAAs in the 100 since Jones and
Guidry are seniors now.

Jackie Edwards finished second in the long Jump at last weekend's NCAA Championships. Overall, the Cardinal contin
gent acquitted Itself quite well at the event In Eugene, Ore.
Another Cardinal Pac-10
champion reaped similar success
at the NCAA Championships.
Senior long jumper Marcus Hick
erson nabbed fourth place and
Ail-American honors with a 26-
foot, 2M-inch leap in the finals.
After winning Pac-lOs Hicker
son claimed the top three finish
ers in the conference rate among
the 10 best in the country. He also
emphasized the parity among the
leapers.
That was made clear when
Washington State's George
Ogbeide won the national crown
with a leap of 26 feet, BZ< inches.
He had placed third behind Hick
erson at Pac-lOs.
Competing on the road obvi
ously did not phase the Stanford
squad but for one competitor it
was a kind of homecoming. Senior
thrower Debbie Malueg returned
to the sight of her high school tri
umphs in the Oregon state cham
pionships to capture sixth place in
the NCAAs.
She earned the spot and the
Ail-American accolades with one
of her best tosses of the year —
169 feet, 3 inches.
Earning more Ail-American
honors was senior Dave Strang,
who hails from South Africa. The
Scottish Olympic hopeful finished
seventh in the 800 meters with a
time of 1:48.79.
After running a "very smart"
race in the trials according to
asst. coach Scott Chisam, senior
Mark Mastalir faltered in the
finals to finish 11th.
