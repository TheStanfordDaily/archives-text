# A 						final journey through the Stanford scrapbook

### 
CC\"W Thy can't my daughters ask
\J\j about normal things? Why
Y Y are they always talking
about baseball!" my mom protested a
couple weeks ago, exasperated.
Even today, in "modern" 1991, it isn't
"normal" for women to eat, sleep and
breathe sports. Sure, they can go to
games, hang out and watch the Super
Bowl, Final Four or playoffs on TV —
even enter rotisserie leagues.
But career-wise, athletics is still con
sidered a male domain.
Sort of like Stanford itself. The Farm
has great athletic programs, great sport
ing traditions. But built on academic
excellence, recognized around the world
for its Nobel laureates and innovators,
Stanford just isn't looked at as a sports
school.
And women are not thought of as
sports writers.
Dating back to when sports writers
and broadcasters were buddies with the
players and the entire profession was
considered part of the good of boy net
work, sports journalism is still thought
of as a men-need-only-apply field. Ath
letes don't want women in the locker
room. Readers and viewers don't want
sports news relayed to them by a girl.
Brought up at basketball arenas, golf
courses and baseball diamonds, however,
it was only normal for me to gravitate to
the world of athletics. And since I just
couldn't hack it on the hardwood, can't
perfect topspin and wasn't quite fast
enough around the track, I ended up in
the press box.
But Cardinal players, coaches, read
ers and listeners have, except for a few
incidents, been quite receptive to having
someone of the female persuasion hang
out on their sidelines, press rooms and
on the pages of their paper for the past
four years. Thanks.
For even though people are great, the
parties were fun, and some of the classes
were even interesting, it's also been
sports which has helped make Stanford
so special.
Defeating the Weenies in the Big
Game, taking the College World
Series, defending national tennis
titles, winning the NIT, beating Notre
Dame, defeating Arizona at Maples,
bringing home the women's national
basketball championship, setting
national swimming records . . . the list
seems endless.
So many amazing contests. So many

memorable moments. Not just at Stan
ford but in Los Angeles, Tucson, Indi
anapolis, South Bend, Athens, and, of
course, Berkeley.
They have already started to blur
together. Jason Palumbis drops back to
pass, the game on the line, and Todd
Lichti — or is it Adam Keefe — takes it
to the hoop.

. . the ball is going, going, Winner! Stan
ford demolishes Cal 8-1 to head to tennis
nationals with the presence and the
momentum to defend its titles. Erik
Blum breaks open in front of the goal,
gets ready to throw . . . and Jeff Rouse
touches the wall for backstroke gold as a
freshman.
Football, tennis, swimming, water
polo, basketball and baseball memories
keep appearing, vying with one another
for for a permanent place in the mental
record book. But looking back, a few
sports moments in particular do stand
out.
November 17, 1990, Memorial Sta
dium, Berkeley, Calif.
There John Hopkins stood, head
down, almost at midfield. His imminent
kick could cap what could go down in his
tory as the most improbable two minutes
of college football. Or it could be forgot
ten instantly.
The clock read :05. The snap was
good. Hopkins' foot made contact. And
everything went into slo-mo. You could
hear the pounding of the players' hearts.
The pigskin headed right, no, it was
straightening, and then it went through.
The timepiece showed :00. And every
one, everyone wearing Cardinal and
White that is, went crazy. The field was a
bobbing sea of red. Stanford 27, Cal 25.
No league or national title lay on the
line, a bowl berth wasn't even for the
taking. It was a game played only for
rivalry, for tradition and for pride. And it
is simply unequivocal in Stanford sports

history.
October 6, 1990, America's sta
dium, South Fiend, Ind..
It just plain couldn't happen.
No way. Notre Dame is America's
team, God's team, not to mention
undefeated and the No. 1-ranked
squad in the nation. Besides, they
always pull out the last-second
'W,' leaving their opponents
heartbroken and Touchdown
Jesus secretly grinning up there
on the library wall.
And they were about to do it
again. Sure, Stanford had just
scored to go ahead 36-31 with only
36 seconds on the clock, but right
back had come the Fighting Irish.
Boom, boom. Just like that they
were on the Cardinal 23. They
had to score a touchdown, there
was only time for one more play,
but they would pull it out with the
luck o' the Irish and leave Stan
ford heartbroken. Again.
Back went Rick Mirer, the
sophomore with the golden arm.
Open went Derek Brown, right in
the left corner of the end zone.
Zing! went the ball. Right into
Brown's hands. And right
through Brown's grasp and onto
the immaculate field. No time left.
"Gasp!" went the press box.
And 59,075 Notre Dame faithful.
Stanford had done it. Upset the
Fighting Irish, on the road.
"Here comes the goddamn
Stanford Cardinal!" coach Denny
Green had said to himself on the
way to the game. And he was
right.
April 1990, Thompson-Boling
Arena, Knoxville, Term..

Academic institutions like
Leland Stanford Jr. University
aren't supposed to win national
titles in basketball, even women's
basketball, in these days of
recruiting violations and athletic
factories. Tennis, swimming, vol
leyball, fine, but not hoops.
"NCAA Champions. Get com
fortable with it" adorned the Car
dinal locker room from day one of
the season. "Just Do It" was the
attitude. They lost only one regu
lar-season game. But still no one
would believe, ranking and seed
ing the squad below Louisiana
Tech.
Which is why Jennifer Azzi,
Sonja Henning, Katy Steding, Val
Whiting and crew tossing the
game ball towards the heavens
and screaming and hugging men
tor Tara VanDerveer when the
game clock ticked out was so spe
cial.
They came out storming, hit
the three-pointers when most
needed, and hung onto the lead —
even after all-everything Azzi
fouled out.
Like any national champi
onship game, there was pandemo
nium on the floor, excitement in
the stands and joy on the players'
faces. But in winning Stanford's
first ever women's basketball title
— and first basketball champi
onship of any sort in 48 years, cut
ting the nets of Thompson-Boling
Arena was that much more mem
orable from the fans' point of view
because most in the world of col
lege basketball doubted the Cardi
nal could do it.
Stanford 88, Auburn 81.
National Champions.
June 11, 1988, Johnny Rosen
blatt Stadium, Omaha, Neb..

Top of the eighth. Nine to four,
Stanford. Steve Chitren goes in
for freshman Stan Spencer.
Strike, strike, ground out. Good
bye Arizona State.
Watching CBS all alone from
the old family easy chair (school
was already out) all I could do was
smile in anticipation. We were
going to do it. The innings fly by.
With two down in the ninth,
Pat Listach sparks a rally, smack
ing a single. John Finn steps to
the plate. And comeback dreams
are squashed. Low pop to the
infield and the season is over.
Players, coaches and trainers mob
Chitren on the mound — for the
second year in a row.
"This must seem like old hat,"
most viewers probably thought as
they listened to Brent Musburger
bumble his way through the Car
dinal's second consecutive NCAA
Championship victory.
Not even close. After a roller
coaster season, a second-place fin
ish to ASU in the Pac-10, a first
game loss in the Northeast
Regional, a Game 2 loss at the
CWS to face elimination, and the
worst record of any baseball vic
tor, Stanford competitors were
more excited, more satisfied by
Win No. 2.
So were Cardinal fans. Even
from 2,000 miles away.
Stanford Athletics. A Winning
Tradition.
Thanks for the excitement.
Thanks for the memories.

squad in the nation. Besides, they
always pull out the last-second
'W,' leaving their opponents
heartbroken and Touchdown
Jesus secretly grinning up there
on the library wall.
And they were about to do it
again. Sure, Stanford had just
scored to go ahead 36-31 with only
36 seconds on the clock, but right
back had come the Fighting Irish.
Boom, boom. Just like that they
were on the Cardinal 23. They
had to score a touchdown, there
was only time for one more play,
but they would pull it out with the
luck o' the Irish and leave Stan
ford heartbroken. Again.
Back went Rick Mirer, the
sophomore with the golden arm.
Open went Derek Brown, right in
the left corner of the end zone.
Zing! went the ball. Right into
Brown's hands. And right
through Brown's grasp and onto
the immaculate field. No time left.
"Gasp!" went the press box.
And 59,075 Notre Dame faithful.
Stanford had done it. Upset the
Fighting Irish, on the road.
"Here comes the goddamn
Stanford Cardinal!" coach Denny
Green had said to himself on the
way to the game. And he was
right.
April 1990, Thompson-Boling
Arena, Knoxville, Term..

Academic institutions like
Leland Stanford Jr. University
aren't supposed to win national
titles in basketball, even women's
basketball, in these days of
recruiting violations and athletic
factories. Tennis, swimming, vol
leyball, fine, but not hoops.
"NCAA Champions. Get com
fortable with it" adorned the Car
dinal locker room from day one of
the season. "Just Do It" was the
attitude. They lost only one regu
lar-season game. But still no one
would believe, ranking and seed
ing the squad below Louisiana
Tech.
Which is why Jennifer Azzi,
Sonja Henning, Katy Steding, Val
Whiting and crew tossing the
game ball towards the heavens
and screaming and hugging men
tor Tara VanDerveer when the
game clock ticked out was so spe
cial.
They came out storming, hit
the three-pointers when most
needed, and hung onto the lead —
even after all-everything Azzi
fouled out.
Like any national champi
onship game, there was pandemo
nium on the floor, excitement in
the stands and joy on the players'
faces. But in winning Stanford's
first ever women's basketball title
— and first basketball champi
onship of any sort in 48 years, cut
ting the nets of Thompson-Boling
Arena was that much more mem
orable from the fans' point of view
because most in the world of col
lege basketball doubted the Cardi
nal could do it.
Stanford 88, Auburn 81.
National Champions.
June 11, 1988, Johnny Rosen
blatt Stadium, Omaha, Neb..

Top of the eighth. Nine to four,
Stanford. Steve Chitren goes in
for freshman Stan Spencer.
Strike, strike, ground out. Good
bye Arizona State.
Watching CBS all alone from
the old family easy chair (school
was already out) all I could do was
smile in anticipation. We were
going to do it. The innings fly by.
With two down in the ninth,
Pat Listach sparks a rally, smack
ing a single. John Finn steps to
the plate. And comeback dreams
are squashed. Low pop to the
infield and the season is over.
Players, coaches and trainers mob
Chitren on the mound — for the
second year in a row.
"This must seem like old hat,"
most viewers probably thought as
they listened to Brent Musburger
bumble his way through the Car
dinal's second consecutive NCAA
Championship victory.
Not even close. After a roller
coaster season, a second-place fin
ish to ASU in the Pac-10, a first
game loss in the Northeast
Regional, a Game 2 loss at the
CWS to face elimination, and the
worst record of any baseball vic
tor, Stanford competitors were
more excited, more satisfied by
Win No. 2.
So were Cardinal fans. Even
from 2,000 miles away.
Stanford Athletics. A Winning
Tradition.
Thanks for the excitement.
Thanks for the memories.

Debbie Spander is a graduating
senior. Yes, her dad is Art Span
der of the San Francisco Exam
iner. Yes, she does love sports. She
claims she'll only give sports writ
ing a one-year trial.
CC\"W Thy can't my daughters ask
\J\j about normal things? Why
Y Y are they always talking
about baseball!" my mom protested a
couple weeks ago, exasperated.
Even today, in "modern" 1991, it isn't
"normal" for women to eat, sleep and
breathe sports. Sure, they can go to
games, hang out and watch the Super
Bowl, Final Four or playoffs on TV —
even enter rotisserie leagues.
But career-wise, athletics is still con
sidered a male domain.
Sort of like Stanford itself. The Farm
has great athletic programs, great sport
ing traditions. But built on academic
excellence, recognized around the world
for its Nobel laureates and innovators,
Stanford just isn't looked at as a sports
school.
And women are not thought of as
sports writers.
Dating back to when sports writers
and broadcasters were buddies with the
players and the entire profession was
considered part of the good of boy net
work, sports journalism is still thought
of as a men-need-only-apply field. Ath
letes don't want women in the locker
room. Readers and viewers don't want
sports news relayed to them by a girl.
Brought up at basketball arenas, golf
courses and baseball diamonds, however,
it was only normal for me to gravitate to
the world of athletics. And since I just
couldn't hack it on the hardwood, can't
perfect topspin and wasn't quite fast
enough around the track, I ended up in
the press box.
But Cardinal players, coaches, read
ers and listeners have, except for a few
incidents, been quite receptive to having
someone of the female persuasion hang
out on their sidelines, press rooms and
on the pages of their paper for the past
four years. Thanks.
For even though people are great, the
parties were fun, and some of the classes
were even interesting, it's also been
sports which has helped make Stanford
so special.
Defeating the Weenies in the Big
Game, taking the College World
Series, defending national tennis
titles, winning the NIT, beating Notre
Dame, defeating Arizona at Maples,
bringing home the women's national
basketball championship, setting
national swimming records . . . the list
seems endless.
So many amazing contests. So many

memorable moments. Not just at Stan
ford but in Los Angeles, Tucson, Indi
anapolis, South Bend, Athens, and, of
course, Berkeley.
They have already started to blur
together. Jason Palumbis drops back to
pass, the game on the line, and Todd
Lichti — or is it Adam Keefe — takes it
to the hoop.

. . the ball is going, going, Winner! Stan
ford demolishes Cal 8-1 to head to tennis
nationals with the presence and the
momentum to defend its titles. Erik
Blum breaks open in front of the goal,
gets ready to throw . . . and Jeff Rouse
touches the wall for backstroke gold as a
freshman.
Football, tennis, swimming, water
polo, basketball and baseball memories
keep appearing, vying with one another
for for a permanent place in the mental
record book. But looking back, a few
sports moments in particular do stand
out.
November 17, 1990, Memorial Sta
dium, Berkeley, Calif.
There John Hopkins stood, head
down, almost at midfield. His imminent
kick could cap what could go down in his
tory as the most improbable two minutes
of college football. Or it could be forgot
ten instantly.
The clock read :05. The snap was
good. Hopkins' foot made contact. And
everything went into slo-mo. You could
hear the pounding of the players' hearts.
The pigskin headed right, no, it was
straightening, and then it went through.
The timepiece showed :00. And every
one, everyone wearing Cardinal and
White that is, went crazy. The field was a
bobbing sea of red. Stanford 27, Cal 25.
No league or national title lay on the
line, a bowl berth wasn't even for the
taking. It was a game played only for
rivalry, for tradition and for pride. And it
is simply unequivocal in Stanford sports
