# A final journey through the Stanford scrapbook

CC\"W Thy can't my daughters ask
\J\j about normal things? Why
Y Y are they always talking
about baseball!" my mom protested a
couple weeks ago, exasperated.
Even today, in "modern" 1991, it isn't
"normal" for women to eat, sleep and
breathe sports. Sure, they can go to
games, hang out and watch the Super
Bowl, Final Four or playoffs on TV —
even enter rotisserie leagues.
But career-wise, athletics is still con
sidered a male domain.
Sort of like Stanford itself. The Farm
has great athletic programs, great sport
ing traditions. But built on academic
excellence, recognized around the world
for its Nobel laureates and innovators,
Stanford just isn't looked at as a sports
school.
And women are not thought of as
sports writers.
Dating back to when sports writers
and broadcasters were buddies with the
players and the entire profession was
considered part of the good of boy net
work, sports journalism is still thought
of as a men-need-only-apply field. Ath
letes don't want women in the locker
room. Readers and viewers don't want
sports news relayed to them by a girl.
Brought up at basketball arenas, golf
courses and baseball diamonds, however,
it was only normal for me to gravitate to
the world of athletics. And since I just
couldn't hack it on the hardwood, can't
perfect topspin and wasn't quite fast
enough around the track, I ended up in
the press box.
But Cardinal players, coaches, read
ers and listeners have, except for a few
incidents, been quite receptive to having
someone of the female persuasion hang
out on their sidelines, press rooms and
on the pages of their paper for the past
four years. Thanks.
For even though people are great, the
parties were fun, and some of the classes
were even interesting, it's also been
sports which has helped make Stanford
so special.
Defeating the Weenies in the Big
Game, taking the College World
Series, defending national tennis
titles, winning the NIT, beating Notre
Dame, defeating Arizona at Maples,
bringing home the women's national
basketball championship, setting
national swimming records . . . the list
seems endless.
So many amazing contests. So many

memorable moments. Not just at Stan
ford but in Los Angeles, Tucson, Indi
anapolis, South Bend, Athens, and, of
course, Berkeley.
They have already started to blur
together. Jason Palumbis drops back to
pass, the game on the line, and Todd
Lichti — or is it Adam Keefe — takes it
to the hoop.

. . the ball is going, going, Winner! Stan
ford demolishes Cal 8-1 to head to tennis
nationals with the presence and the
momentum to defend its titles. Erik
Blum breaks open in front of the goal,
gets ready to throw . . . and Jeff Rouse
touches the wall for backstroke gold as a
freshman.
Football, tennis, swimming, water
polo, basketball and baseball memories
keep appearing, vying with one another
for for a permanent place in the mental
record book. But looking back, a few
sports moments in particular do stand
out.
November 17, 1990, Memorial Sta
dium, Berkeley, Calif.
There John Hopkins stood, head
down, almost at midfield. His imminent
kick could cap what could go down in his
tory as the most improbable two minutes
of college football. Or it could be forgot
ten instantly.
The clock read :05. The snap was
good. Hopkins' foot made contact. And
everything went into slo-mo. You could
hear the pounding of the players' hearts.
The pigskin headed right, no, it was
straightening, and then it went through.
The timepiece showed :00. And every
one, everyone wearing Cardinal and
White that is, went crazy. The field was a
bobbing sea of red. Stanford 27, Cal 25.
No league or national title lay on the
line, a bowl berth wasn't even for the
taking. It was a game played only for
rivalry, for tradition and for pride. And it
is simply unequivocal in Stanford sports
