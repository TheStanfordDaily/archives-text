# Leland expected to be named athletic director this week

### 
According to a report published in yes
terday's San Jose Mercury News, the ath
letic director search is over. Ted Inland,
who currently holds that post at Univer
sity of the Pacific and has been a rumored
candidate for months, is expected to be
named as Andy Geiger's replacement per
haps as soon as tomorrow.
Leland wbb on campus Monday visit
ing with Athletic Department officials.
Numerous attempts to reach him at his
office and home were unsuccessful.
If Leland is selected, it will be the rela
tively safe choice given his ties with Stan
ford and his past work with football coach
Denny Green. The other finalist, Texas
women's athletic director Donna Lopi
ano, has no Stanford connections in her

background.
The search for Geiger's replacement
began in earnest this spring. Geiger left in
October to become athletic director at
Maryland. In the interim, senior associate
athletic director Alan Cummings has
been running the show.
Three hoopsters vie for
spots on Pan-Am team
Of the 19 finalists for the Pan Ameri
can Games women's basketball team,
three were key members of the Stanford
squad that won the 1990 NCAA Champi
onship.
Class of '90 members Jennifer Azzi
and Katy Steding and '91 graduate-to-be

Sor\ja Henning are still alive for berths on
the Pan-Am team. Finalists will partici
pate in a mini-camp June 2-6. Members of
the team will then be chosen on June 7.
If any of the Stanford contingent fails
to make the Pan-Am team, they could still
be selected for the World University
Games squad. That event will be held
July 15-24 in Sheffield, England.
Women's tennis to get
key transfer from East
Kristine Kurth, arguably the top fresh
man in women's tennis, will transfer
fVom William & Map' to Stanford next
year. Since the Tribe is releasing her from
her letter of intent, Kurth will be eligible

to play immediately.
Hailing from Massapequa, N.Y., Kurth
made a nuyor impact on the William &
Mary program in a hurry. In the middle of
the year, she and her coach decided it
would be best for her tennis development
if she went elsewhere.
Stanford, winner of six NCAA titles in
a row, should be a perfect fit. And the tim
ing couldn't be better for the Cardinal.
With the graduation of Teri Whitlinger
and Sandra Birch — two of the greatest
collegians ever — it was feared there
would be a gaping hole in the middle of

the lineup.
Returning stars like Heather Willens
and Laxmi Poruri will now be joined by
Kurth, who will likely play somewhere
between second and fifth singles. She is
also an accomplished doubles player and
could figure into the upper part of the
doubles lineup.
When Pepperdine assistant coach Alan
Hopkins learned Kurth was attending
Stanford, he quickly backed down from
an earlier prediction that the Cardinal
would not make it seven straight in 1992.
While another national crown is never
a guarantee, the addition of Kriatine
Kurth and incoming freshmen Kim
Shasby and Amy Chiminello should make
the Cardinal a formidable force once
again.
