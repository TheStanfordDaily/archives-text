## David McCarty, national player of the year 
### 
There are many advantages
to being a hitter in collegiate
baseball. For one, stadiums are
usually smaller than in the
Major Leagues. Secondly, there
are plenty of teams with
mediocre pitching staffs to play
against.
Additionally, hitters get more
bat speed by virtue of using alu
minum bats. Despite those
adavntages, however, one Stan
ford player put up numbers this
year that just could not be over
looked.
For earning Baseball Amer
ica's National Player of the Year
honors, The Daily names David
McCarty as its male Athlete of
the Year.
McCarty had perhaps the best
season ever in the storied his
tory of Stanford baseball. For
starters he had the second-high
est batting average and the sec

ond-highest home run totals
ever recorded in a single season.
His .420 batting average, his 24
homers and his .828 slugging
percentage led the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division,
widely regarded as collegiate
baseball's best league.
He also led the Cardinal in
several additional categories:
runs batted in, hits, runs, walks,
on-base percentage and total
bases. After a very good sopho
more year, McCarty spent the
summer playing first base for
the U.S. national team and led
that squad in hitting.
When he returned for his
junior year, the Houston, Texas,
native started hot and got ever
hotter. At one point he recorded
a 26-game hitting streak, bat
ting .490 with 10 home runs and
32 RBI. During the streak he
homered in Friday, Saturday

and Sunday games then hit a
total of three home runs in a
Monday doubleheader for six
round-trippers in four days.
McCarty was named Baseball
America's Player of the Year last
week after being selected a first
team All-American by Collegiate
Baseball. He led the Cardinal to a
39-23 season and was the third
selection overall in the Major
League draft Monday. He has not
announced if he will return to
the Farm for his senior season.
"David had an unbelievable
year," Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess said. "He has the ability to
hit for power and average, and
that's what makes him such a
great player. His numbers speak
for themselves. We've had some
great players at Stanford, but
David's season in 1991 has to
rank as one of the best of all
time."
