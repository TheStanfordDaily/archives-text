# Sandra Birch, NCAA singles champion
## 
### 
She thought about skipping
her senior year at Stanford and
heading for the pro tennis tour.
Then she reconsidered and has
many reasons to be thankful she
did.
For leading the Cardinal from
the No. 1 singles spot and for
winning her second NCAA indi
vidual singles titles, The Daily
names Sandra Birch as its
female Athlete of the Year.
Birch started the year by cap
turing the Riviera All-American
Tournament in the fall and
never looked back. She with
stood a strong challenge from
teammate Debbie Graham for
top placement in the lineup and
performed brilliantly all year.
After winning the Pacific 10
Conference title in April, Birch
seemed primed to lead the Cardi
nal into NCAAs. But a stomach
virus attacked her the night

before the tournament began
and sidelined her for the first
two days of team competition.
In the semfinals and finals,
Birch re-entered the lineup.
While she didn't win either
match, her mere presence was
key as the Cardinal sought its
sixth straight national title. She
allowed everyone else on the
team to play in their normal
position and made it possible for
Stanford to clinch both matches
in singles.
Her draining match against
Kimberly Po of UCLA in the
team final seemed to sap any
chance she had of competing in
the individual singles event the
next day. But the heavens
opened and provided a five-hour
rain delay Birch would later call
a "godsend." It allowed her some
critical time to prepare.
Still, many times on the open

ing days of the singles event, she
thought of throwing in the
towel. Birch was weak and didn't
believe she could make it all the
way.
As she scratched and clawed
her way past opponent after
opponent, some of Birch's
strength returned. By semifinal
time, Birch had enough to out
last Georgia's Shannan Mc-
Carthy. In the finals, she was to
face California's Lisa Albano,
who had not beaten Birch in
eight tries.
The ninth time wasn't the
charm, as Birch overwhelmed
the Bears star to win the title.
Her victory made Birch only
the second two-time singles
champ ever. Stanford's Patty
Fendick was the first. In Birch's
brilliant career, she was named a
singles and doubles All-Ameri
can each of her four years.
