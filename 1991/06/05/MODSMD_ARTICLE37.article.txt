## A 						look back at a topsy-turvy year in Cardinal athletics 
### 
r 12 amazing seconds
over Berkeley

The first 92 Big Games pro
duced some of the most exciting
moments in collegiate football his
tory, but none of those games had
anything on what took place this
year.
Going into the game at Califor
nia's Memorial Stadium, things
seemed about even. Cal was bowl
bound while the Cardinal was on a
roll and had a victory over Notre
Dame to its credit. And in the end,
it took all 3,600 seconds before a
winner was decided.
Glyn Milburn had one of the
most amazing performances in
Big Game history, rushing for a
total of 196 yards. He finished the
day with 379 yards of all-purpose
running, a new Pacific 10 Confer
ence record.
Despite that, when Stanford
got the ball on its own 13-yard line
with 1:54 to play, trailing 23-16,
Golden Bear fans were feeling
pretty confident. Jason Palumbis
directed the Cardinal down field
for a touchdown with 12 seconds
remaining, and Cal's fans stood
silent. But when Palumbis' two
point conversion to Ed McCaffrey
was intercepted, the home fans
swarmed the field.
But after a 15-yard penalty for
delay of game, a successful onside
kick and a 15-yard roughing-the
quarterback penalty, Stanford
senior kicker John Hopkins lined
up a 39-yard field goal.
The last snap of senior Chuck
Gillingham's collegiate career was
good enough. The last kick of
Hopkins' collegiate career was
good enough. And the result was
certainly good enough.
Time had expired and Stanford
had won the most truly improba
ble game in a 93-year truly
improbable series of games, 27-25.

finally finds
luck o' the Irish

As of Oct. 5, 1991, the Stanford
football team had not won a road
game since 1987. The Cardinal
was 1-3. And it was traveling to
Notre Dame Stadium to face the
top-ranked Irish.
Given that, it was remarkable
that the Cardinal was leading the
Fighting Irish with only a few sec
onds left in the game the following
day. But the Cardinal had already
seen two victories stolen from
them in the last seconds of games
during the young season.
This time, however, the oppo
nent didn't pull off the miracle.
This time Stanford did the impos
sible, upsetting Notre Dame 36-
31.
Tommy Vardell scored four
touchdowns by plowing over peo
ple like Chris Zorich and Michael
Stonebreaker. Jason Palumbis
threw for 256 yards, including 111
to Ed McCaffrey.
And the Cardinal beat Notre
Dame.

V Resurgent hoopsters
net NIT championship

After a 15-13 regular season

and one victory in its last five
games, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team appeared to be stum
bling into the postseason. In fact,
some people felt the team was
lucky to be in the postseason at
all.
But the Cardinal received a bid
to the National Invitation Tour
nament. And, more importantly,
Andrew Vlahov was back.
The senior was out for the sea
son when he underwent surgery
on his ankle during the middle of
the schedule. Or at least he was
supposed to be out for the season.
But his remarkable recovery and
his desire to play one more game
with his friends brought him back
for the NIT.
For five games in four different
cities in three different time zones
the Cardinal played the way it
knew it could. And five times the
result was the same. Stanford
swept its way past all comers,
finally defeating Oklahoma for
the title. After a 49-year drought,
the Cardinal had earned another
national championship banner to
hang in Maples Pavilion.

W No fence is safe if
McCarty's in town

Those in the know might have
gotten a clue when he hit .336
with 12 home runs a year ago.
More hints were provided when
he batted over .400 with the U.S.
national team last summer. But
even people who had been paying
close attention could have no idea
as to what 1991 would hold for
David McCarty.
In simple terms, McCarty had
perhaps the best season any base
ball player has ever had in a Stan
ford uniform. He was named the
National Player of the Year by
Baseball America. He hit .420. He
sent 24 balls over outfield fences,
usually by a large margin. And he
posted an .828 slugging percent
age.
But those numbers, and the
rest of his stats, can't even
describe the season he had.
McCarty had a 26-game hitting
streak at one point, the third
longest in school history. He
homered in six straight games at
one stretch, going deep six times
in four days. He led the nation's
best baseball conference in
homers, average and slugging per
centage.

V Card's six-peat ends
home-court jinx

After winning five straight
NCAA titles, it would almost seem
winning would lose meaning. But
don't try telling that to the Cardi
nal women's tennis team.
Coming in as the underdog to
top-ranked Florida, Stanford
swept through the competition to
win its sixth consecutive title. And
by the looks on their faces, not one
player on the Stanford team had
taken anything for granted.
With the nation's best player,
Sandra Birch, ailing, every other
player on the team picked her
game up a notch. The result was
four victories during singles play,
culminating in the biggest win the
Stanford Tennis Stadium has ever
seen. Birch and Teri Whitlinger
will now graduate as the third
consecutive class to have won four

NCAA crowns.
Topping it off was the fact that
Birch was able to recover enough
to play in the NCAA singles draw.
Losing only one set in six
matches, she swept to her second
NCAA crown, joining Stanford
graduate Patty Fendick as the
only two-time NCAA champ.

exits to train
for '92 Olympics

After having two of the most
successful seasons in Stanford
women's swimming history,
sophomore Janet Evans dropped a
bombshell. On April 3, the five
time NCAA individual champ
announced she was leaving Stan
ford to train for the 1992 Olympic
Games.
Evans, who won three gold
medals in the 1988 Games, is try
ing to achieve similar success in
the 1992 Olympics. First she cited
new NCAA legislation which
places limitations on the amount
of time an athlete can spend prac
ticing for her decision. But there
are loopholes in the NCAA rules
and only one other collegiate
swimmer left school for that rea
son.
Later Evans softened her
stance, stating that the rules
weren't the only factor. Evans
wasn't happy with the way her
training was going at Stanford
and decided a change would be in
her best interests.
At the NCAA Championships
in March, Evans won the 500-yard
and 1,650 freestyles and placed
second to teammate Summer
Sanders in the 400 individual
medley She also swam a leg on the
champion 800 freestyle relay
team.
But that impressive perfor
mance was not up to the standard
she had set the year before. As a
freshman Evans had won all three
individual events and swam on
the title-winning relay. More
importantly, she was slower in
each of the individual events this
year than she was in 1990.

V The Streak runs out
of spirit after 76

It was the most successful
streak women's collegiate sports
had ever seen. The Stanford
women's tennis team went unde
feated for nearly three full years
by winning 76 straight matches,
most of them in chew-them-up
and-spit-them-out fashion.
But in the finals of the
National Team Indoors in Madi
son, Wis., last March, The Streak
came to a grinding halt.
Not only did the Cardinal lose,
but for the first time ever the
Stanford women's tennis team
was shut out. The Florida Lady
Gators did the shutting out, post
ing a stunning 6-0 victory over the
Cardinal. In fact, most of the indi
vidual matches were not even
close.
But the Cardinal rebounded
and re-established its goals. The
team returned to the pattern of
dominating every opponent. And
two months later, at the NCAA
Championships in the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, it was the Cardi
nal that was holding up the big
trophy. The new streak is up to 15.

r Palmer puts past
behind him in Athens

Stanford and tennis success
have long gone together. Through
out the years, the Cardinal men's
team has produced 10 different
NCAA singles champions. But
none of them did it quite the way
a sophomore from Wesley Chapel,
Fla., did it.
Going into this season Jared
Palmer was ranked 12th in the
nation. But the talented player
had his fair share of ups and
downs throughout the year. Fol
lowing a down period toward the
end of the season, he enterred the
NCAA championships ranked
only 38th nationally and was
unseeded in the singles draw.
But after surviving a third-set
tiebreaker in the first round,
Palmer crushed everyone in his
path. In the end, he beat Georgia's

Patricio Arnold 6-2, 6-0 in the
most lopsided NCAA singles
championship match since the
present format was adopted.

v There's no doubt 'tis
the season of Summer

It may have been in the 60s
with winds gusting up to 75 miles
an hour last March in Indianapo
lis, but there could be no doubt
that Summer had arrived. Sum
mer Sanders, the newest super
star in American swimming
turned the NCAA Championships
at the Indiana University Natato
rium into her own private pool
party.
Sanders, a freshman from
Roseville, Calif., started the meet
off with quite a bang. She broke
Tracy Caulkins' American record
in the 200-yard individual medley.
The following day she bested
another teammate who was a
defending NCAA champion, beat
ing Janet Evans in the 400 IM.
She also broke the NCAA record,
set in 1990 by Evans. Sanders
completed her three-for-three per
formance in individual races by
cruising to victory in the 200 but
terfly on the meet's final day, also
in NCAA-record time.
Despite those titles, however,
Stanford couldn't keep up with
Texas. Still, there was some con
solation for Sanders. In her first
year at the collegiate level she won
three individual NCAA titles, a
relay title and won both high
point and NCAA Swimmer of the
Year awards.
So Stanford swimming fans
can get their shorts, their fan and
their lemonade because Summer's

women
hobble Into Final Four

If 1990 was a season of destiny
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team, 1991 seemed to be just
the opposite. After winning the
school's first-ever NCAA crown in
the sport, three impact players
graduated.

But the cupboard wasn't com
pletely bare. The Cardinal had
Trisha Stevens, the NCAA
champs' top scorer, except when
her sore knees forced her to miss
games. And the team had Julie
Zeilstra, the leading scorer this
year, except when her sore achilles
heels forced her to miss games.
But the Cardinal put together a
very succesful season. Stevens'
season ended in the regional semi
final when she blew out her knee,
but the Cardinal still beat both
Washington and Georgia.
Zeilstra's season ended during
warm-ups prior to the national
semifinal against Tennessee. But,
despite playing without two
superstars, Sonja Henning and
her Cardinal teammates scared
the Lady Volunteers for 40 min
utes before finally seeing their
improbable run come to an end.

r Rouse makes it back
in the nick of time

There was no question Jeff
Rouse was one of the world's top
backstrokers going into 1991.
Under current international
rules, no one had swum the 100-
meter backstroke any faster than
he had.
When he began the year by set
ting two meet records and win
ning two gold medals at the World
Championships — in the 100-
meter backstroke and the 400-
meter medley relay — it seemed
Rouse was going to be even better
this year. Then, midway into the
collegiate season, he broke his
right wrist after slipping on some
steps as his home.
Rouse missed most of the
remainder of the season, although
he swam in the dual meet against
California. But he competed with
his wrist heavily taped.
When the NCAA Champi
onships rolled around, Rouse's
first race was swimming the lead
off leg on the 400-yard medley
relay. He swam the 100 yards in
46.63 seconds, shattering David
Berkoffs American record of
47.02.
For good measure he swam a
46.99 — the second-fastest time
ever — to win the 100 backstroke
the next day.

on his ankle during the middle of
the schedule. Or at least he was
supposed to be out for the season.
But his remarkable recovery and
his desire to play one more game

for the NIT.
For five games in four different
cities in three different time zones
the Cardinal played the way it

swept its way past all comers,
finally defeating Oklahoma for
the title. After a 49-year drought,
the Cardinal had earned another

even people who had been paying

In simple terms, McCarty had
perhaps the best season any base

National Player of the Year by
Baseball America. He hit .420. He
sent 24 balls over outfield fences,
usually by a large margin. And he

four victories during singles play,
culminating in the biggest win the
Stanford Tennis Stadium has ever
seen. Birch and Teri Whitlinger
will now graduate as the third
consecutive class to have won four

NCAA crowns.
Topping it off was the fact that
Birch was able to recover enough
to play in the NCAA singles draw.
Losing only one set in six
matches, she swept to her second
NCAA crown, joining Stanford
graduate Patty Fendick as the
only two-time NCAA champ.

After having two of the most
successful seasons in Stanford
women's swimming history,
sophomore Janet Evans dropped a
bombshell. On April 3, the five
time NCAA individual champ
announced she was leaving Stan
ford to train for the 1992 Olympic
Games.
Evans, who won three gold
medals in the 1988 Games, is try
ing to achieve similar success in
the 1992 Olympics. First she cited
new NCAA legislation which
places limitations on the amount
of time an athlete can spend prac
ticing for her decision. But there
are loopholes in the NCAA rules
and only one other collegiate
swimmer left school for that rea
son.
Later Evans softened her
stance, stating that the rules
weren't the only factor. Evans
wasn't happy with the way her
training was going at Stanford
and decided a change would be in
her best interests.
At the NCAA Championships
in March, Evans won the 500-yard
and 1,650 freestyles and placed
second to teammate Summer
Sanders in the 400 individual
medley She also swam a leg on the
champion 800 freestyle relay
team.
But that impressive perfor
mance was not up to the standard
she had set the year before. As a
freshman Evans had won all three
individual events and swam on
the title-winning relay. More
importantly, she was slower in
each of the individual events this
year than she was in 1990.

V The Streak runs out
of spirit after 76

It was the most successful
streak women's collegiate sports
had ever seen. The Stanford
women's tennis team went unde
feated for nearly three full years
by winning 76 straight matches,
most of them in chew-them-up
and-spit-them-out fashion.
But in the finals of the
National Team Indoors in Madi
son, Wis., last March, The Streak
came to a grinding halt.
Not only did the Cardinal lose,
but for the first time ever the
Stanford women's tennis team
was shut out. The Florida Lady
Gators did the shutting out, post
ing a stunning 6-0 victory over the
Cardinal. In fact, most of the indi
vidual matches were not even
close.
But the Cardinal rebounded
and re-established its goals. The
team returned to the pattern of
dominating every opponent. And
two months later, at the NCAA
Championships in the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, it was the Cardi
nal that was holding up the big
trophy. The new streak is up to 15.

Stanford and tennis success
have long gone together. Through
out the years, the Cardinal men's
team has produced 10 different
NCAA singles champions. But
none of them did it quite the way
a sophomore from Wesley Chapel,
Fla., did it.
Going into this season Jared
Palmer was ranked 12th in the
nation. But the talented player
had his fair share of ups and
downs throughout the year. Fol
lowing a down period toward the
end of the season, he enterred the
NCAA championships ranked
only 38th nationally and was
unseeded in the singles draw.
But after surviving a third-set
tiebreaker in the first round,
Palmer crushed everyone in his
path. In the end, he beat Georgia's

Patricio Arnold 6-2, 6-0 in the
most lopsided NCAA singles
championship match since the
present format was adopted.

It may have been in the 60s

that Summer had arrived. Sum
mer Sanders, the newest super
star in American swimming
turned the NCAA Championships
at the Indiana University Natato
rium into her own private pool
party.
Sanders, a freshman from
Roseville, Calif., started the meet
off with quite a bang. She broke
Tracy Caulkins' American record
in the 200-yard individual medley.
The following day she bested
another teammate who was a
defending NCAA champion, beat
ing Janet Evans in the 400 IM.
She also broke the NCAA record,
set in 1990 by Evans. Sanders
completed her three-for-three per
formance in individual races by
cruising to victory in the 200 but
terfly on the meet's final day, also
in NCAA-record time.
Despite those titles, however,
Stanford couldn't keep up with
Texas. Still, there was some con
solation for Sanders. In her first
year at the collegiate level she won
three individual NCAA titles, a
relay title and won both high
point and NCAA Swimmer of the
Year awards.
So Stanford swimming fans

If 1990 was a season of destiny
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team, 1991 seemed to be just
the opposite. After winning the
school's first-ever NCAA crown in
the sport, three impact players
graduated.

But the cupboard wasn't com
pletely bare. The Cardinal had
Trisha Stevens, the NCAA
champs' top scorer, except when
her sore knees forced her to miss
games. And the team had Julie
Zeilstra, the leading scorer this
year, except when her sore achilles
heels forced her to miss games.
But the Cardinal put together a
very succesful season. Stevens'
season ended in the regional semi
final when she blew out her knee,
but the Cardinal still beat both
Washington and Georgia.
Zeilstra's season ended during
warm-ups prior to the national
semifinal against Tennessee. But,
despite playing without two
superstars, Sonja Henning and
her Cardinal teammates scared
the Lady Volunteers for 40 min

improbable run come to an end.

r Rouse makes it back
in the nick of time

There was no question Jeff
Rouse was one of the world's top
backstrokers going into 1991.
Under current international
rules, no one had swum the 100-
meter backstroke any faster than
he had.
When he began the year by set
ting two meet records and win
ning two gold medals at the World
Championships — in the 100-
meter backstroke and the 400-
meter medley relay — it seemed
Rouse was going to be even better
this year. Then, midway into the
collegiate season, he broke his
right wrist after slipping on some
steps as his home.
Rouse missed most of the
remainder of the season, although
he swam in the dual meet against
California. But he competed with
his wrist heavily taped.
When the NCAA Champi
onships rolled around, Rouse's
first race was swimming the lead
off leg on the 400-yard medley
relay. He swam the 100 yards in
46.63 seconds, shattering David
Berkoffs American record of
47.02.
For good measure he swam a
46.99 — the second-fastest time
ever — to win the 100 backstroke
the next day.

r 12 amazing seconds
over Berkeley

The first 92 Big Games pro
duced some of the most exciting
moments in collegiate football his
tory, but none of those games had
anything on what took place this
year.
Going into the game at Califor

seemed about even. Cal was bowl
bound while the Cardinal was on a
roll and had a victory over Notre
Dame to its credit. And in the end,
it took all 3,600 seconds before a
winner was decided.
Glyn Milburn had one of the
most amazing performances in
Big Game history, rushing for a
total of 196 yards. He finished the
day with 379 yards of all-purpose
running, a new Pacific 10 Confer
ence record.
Despite that, when Stanford
got the ball on its own 13-yard line
with 1:54 to play, trailing 23-16,
Golden Bear fans were feeling
pretty confident. Jason Palumbis
directed the Cardinal down field
for a touchdown with 12 seconds
remaining, and Cal's fans stood
silent. But when Palumbis' two
point conversion to Ed McCaffrey
was intercepted, the home fans
swarmed the field.
But after a 15-yard penalty for
delay of game, a successful onside
kick and a 15-yard roughing-the
quarterback penalty, Stanford
senior kicker John Hopkins lined
up a 39-yard field goal.
The last snap of senior Chuck
Gillingham's collegiate career was
good enough. The last kick of
Hopkins' collegiate career was
good enough. And the result was
certainly good enough.
Time had expired and Stanford
had won the most truly improba

improbable series of games, 27-25.

As of Oct. 5, 1991, the Stanford
football team had not won a road
game since 1987. The Cardinal
was 1-3. And it was traveling to
Notre Dame Stadium to face the
top-ranked Irish.
Given that, it was remarkable
that the Cardinal was leading the
Fighting Irish with only a few sec
onds left in the game the following
day. But the Cardinal had already
seen two victories stolen from
them in the last seconds of games
during the young season.
This time, however, the oppo
nent didn't pull off the miracle.
This time Stanford did the impos
sible, upsetting Notre Dame 36-
31.
Tommy Vardell scored four
touchdowns by plowing over peo
ple like Chris Zorich and Michael
Stonebreaker. Jason Palumbis
threw for 256 yards, including 111
to Ed McCaffrey.
And the Cardinal beat Notre
Dame.

medals in the 1988 Games, is try
ing to achieve similar success in
the 1992 Olympics. First she cited
new NCAA legislation which
places limitations on the amount
of time an athlete can spend prac
ticing for her decision. But there
are loopholes in the NCAA rules
and only one other collegiate
swimmer left school for that rea
son.
Later Evans softened her
stance, stating that the rules
weren't the only factor. Evans
wasn't happy with the way her
training was going at Stanford
and decided a change would be in
her best interests.
At the NCAA Championships
in March, Evans won the 500-yard
and 1,650 freestyles and placed
second to teammate Summer
Sanders in the 400 individual
medley She also swam a leg on the
champion 800 freestyle relay
team.
But that impressive perfor
mance was not up to the standard
she had set the year before. As a
freshman Evans had won all three
individual events and swam on
the title-winning relay. More
importantly, she was slower in
each of the individual events this
year than she was in 1990.

V The Streak runs out
of spirit after 76

It was the most successful
streak women's collegiate sports
had ever seen. The Stanford
women's tennis team went unde
feated for nearly three full years
by winning 76 straight matches,
most of them in chew-them-up
and-spit-them-out fashion.
But in the finals of the
National Team Indoors in Madi
son, Wis., last March, The Streak
came to a grinding halt.
Not only did the Cardinal lose,
but for the first time ever the
Stanford women's tennis team
was shut out. The Florida Lady
Gators did the shutting out, post
ing a stunning 6-0 victory over the
Cardinal. In fact, most of the indi
vidual matches were not even
close.
But the Cardinal rebounded
and re-established its goals. The
team returned to the pattern of
dominating every opponent. And
two months later, at the NCAA
Championships in the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, it was the Cardi
nal that was holding up the big
trophy. The new streak is up to 15.

r Palmer puts past

Stanford and tennis success
have long gone together. Through
out the years, the Cardinal men's
team has produced 10 different
NCAA singles champions. But
none of them did it quite the way
a sophomore from Wesley Chapel,
Fla., did it.
Going into this season Jared
Palmer was ranked 12th in the
nation. But the talented player
had his fair share of ups and
downs throughout the year. Fol
lowing a down period toward the
end of the season, he enterred the
NCAA championships ranked
only 38th nationally and was
unseeded in the singles draw.
But after surviving a third-set
tiebreaker in the first round,
Palmer crushed everyone in his
path. In the end, he beat Georgia's

Patricio Arnold 6-2, 6-0 in the
most lopsided NCAA singles
championship match since the

v There's no doubt 'tis
the season of Summer

It may have been in the 60s
with winds gusting up to 75 miles

that Summer had arrived. Sum
mer Sanders, the newest super
star in American swimming
turned the NCAA Championships
at the Indiana University Natato
rium into her own private pool
party.
Sanders, a freshman from
Roseville, Calif., started the meet
off with quite a bang. She broke
Tracy Caulkins' American record
in the 200-yard individual medley.
The following day she bested
another teammate who was a
defending NCAA champion, beat
ing Janet Evans in the 400 IM.
She also broke the NCAA record,
set in 1990 by Evans. Sanders
completed her three-for-three per
formance in individual races by
cruising to victory in the 200 but
terfly on the meet's final day, also
in NCAA-record time.
Despite those titles, however,
Stanford couldn't keep up with
Texas. Still, there was some con
solation for Sanders. In her first
year at the collegiate level she won
three individual NCAA titles, a
relay title and won both high
point and NCAA Swimmer of the
Year awards.

If 1990 was a season of destiny
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team, 1991 seemed to be just
the opposite. After winning the
school's first-ever NCAA crown in
the sport, three impact players
graduated.

But the cupboard wasn't com
pletely bare. The Cardinal had
Trisha Stevens, the NCAA
champs' top scorer, except when
her sore knees forced her to miss
games. And the team had Julie
Zeilstra, the leading scorer this
year, except when her sore achilles
heels forced her to miss games.
But the Cardinal put together a
very succesful season. Stevens'
season ended in the regional semi
final when she blew out her knee,
but the Cardinal still beat both
Washington and Georgia.
Zeilstra's season ended during
warm-ups prior to the national
semifinal against Tennessee. But,
despite playing without two
superstars, Sonja Henning and
her Cardinal teammates scared
the Lady Volunteers for 40 min
utes before finally seeing their
improbable run come to an end.

r Rouse makes it back
in the nick of time

There was no question Jeff
Rouse was one of the world's top
backstrokers going into 1991.
Under current international
rules, no one had swum the 100-
meter backstroke any faster than
he had.
When he began the year by set
ting two meet records and win
ning two gold medals at the World
Championships — in the 100-
meter backstroke and the 400-
meter medley relay — it seemed
Rouse was going to be even better
this year. Then, midway into the
collegiate season, he broke his
right wrist after slipping on some
steps as his home.
Rouse missed most of the
remainder of the season, although
he swam in the dual meet against
California. But he competed with
his wrist heavily taped.
When the NCAA Champi
onships rolled around, Rouse's
first race was swimming the lead
off leg on the 400-yard medley
relay. He swam the 100 yards in
46.63 seconds, shattering David
Berkoffs American record of
47.02.
For good measure he swam a
46.99 — the second-fastest time
ever — to win the 100 backstroke
the next day.

r 12 amazing seconds
over Berkeley

The first 92 Big Games pro
duced some of the most exciting
moments in collegiate football his
tory, but none of those games had
anything on what took place this
year.
Going into the game at Califor
nia's Memorial Stadium, things
seemed about even. Cal was bowl
bound while the Cardinal was on a
roll and had a victory over Notre
Dame to its credit. And in the end,
it took all 3,600 seconds before a
winner was decided.
Glyn Milburn had one of the
most amazing performances in
Big Game history, rushing for a
total of 196 yards. He finished the
day with 379 yards of all-purpose
running, a new Pacific 10 Confer
ence record.
Despite that, when Stanford
got the ball on its own 13-yard line
with 1:54 to play, trailing 23-16,
Golden Bear fans were feeling
pretty confident. Jason Palumbis
directed the Cardinal down field
for a touchdown with 12 seconds
remaining, and Cal's fans stood
silent. But when Palumbis' two
point conversion to Ed McCaffrey
was intercepted, the home fans
swarmed the field.
But after a 15-yard penalty for
delay of game, a successful onside
kick and a 15-yard roughing-the
quarterback penalty, Stanford
senior kicker John Hopkins lined
up a 39-yard field goal.
The last snap of senior Chuck
Gillingham's collegiate career was
good enough. The last kick of
Hopkins' collegiate career was
good enough. And the result was
certainly good enough.
Time had expired and Stanford
had won the most truly improba
ble game in a 93-year truly
improbable series of games, 27-25.

finally finds
luck o' the Irish

As of Oct. 5, 1991, the Stanford
football team had not won a road
game since 1987. The Cardinal
was 1-3. And it was traveling to
Notre Dame Stadium to face the
top-ranked Irish.
Given that, it was remarkable
that the Cardinal was leading the
Fighting Irish with only a few sec
onds left in the game the following
day. But the Cardinal had already
seen two victories stolen from
them in the last seconds of games
during the young season.
This time, however, the oppo
nent didn't pull off the miracle.
This time Stanford did the impos
sible, upsetting Notre Dame 36-
31.
Tommy Vardell scored four
touchdowns by plowing over peo
ple like Chris Zorich and Michael
Stonebreaker. Jason Palumbis
threw for 256 yards, including 111
to Ed McCaffrey.
And the Cardinal beat Notre
Dame.

After a 15-13 regular season

and one victory in its last five
games, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team appeared to be stum
bling into the postseason. In fact,
some people felt the team was
lucky to be in the postseason at
all.
But the Cardinal received a bid
to the National Invitation Tour
nament. And, more importantly,
Andrew Vlahov was back.
The senior was out for the sea
son when he underwent surgery
on his ankle during the middle of
the schedule. Or at least he was
supposed to be out for the season.
But his remarkable recovery and
his desire to play one more game
with his friends brought him back
for the NIT.
For five games in four different
cities in three different time zones
the Cardinal played the way it
knew it could. And five times the
result was the same. Stanford
swept its way past all comers,
finally defeating Oklahoma for
the title. After a 49-year drought,
the Cardinal had earned another
national championship banner to
hang in Maples Pavilion.

Those in the know might have

More hints were provided when
he batted over .400 with the U.S.
national team last summer. But
even people who had been paying
close attention could have no idea
as to what 1991 would hold for
David McCarty.
In simple terms, McCarty had
perhaps the best season any base
ball player has ever had in a Stan
ford uniform. He was named the
National Player of the Year by
Baseball America. He hit .420. He
sent 24 balls over outfield fences,
usually by a large margin. And he
posted an .828 slugging percent
age.
But those numbers, and the
rest of his stats, can't even
describe the season he had.
McCarty had a 26-game hitting
streak at one point, the third
longest in school history. He
homered in six straight games at
one stretch, going deep six times
in four days. He led the nation's
best baseball conference in
homers, average and slugging per

taken anything for granted.
With the nation's best player,
Sandra Birch, ailing, every other

game up a notch. The result was
four victories during singles play,
culminating in the biggest win the
Stanford Tennis Stadium has ever
seen. Birch and Teri Whitlinger
will now graduate as the third
consecutive class to have won four

NCAA crowns.
Topping it off was the fact that
Birch was able to recover enough
to play in the NCAA singles draw.
Losing only one set in six
matches, she swept to her second
NCAA crown, joining Stanford
graduate Patty Fendick as the
only two-time NCAA champ.

with winds gusting up to 75 miles
an hour last March in Indianapo
lis, but there could be no doubt
that Summer had arrived. Sum
mer Sanders, the newest super
star in American swimming
turned the NCAA Championships
at the Indiana University Natato
rium into her own private pool
party.
Sanders, a freshman from
Roseville, Calif., started the meet
off with quite a bang. She broke
Tracy Caulkins' American record
in the 200-yard individual medley.
The following day she bested
another teammate who was a
defending NCAA champion, beat
ing Janet Evans in the 400 IM.
She also broke the NCAA record,
set in 1990 by Evans. Sanders
completed her three-for-three per
formance in individual races by
cruising to victory in the 200 but
terfly on the meet's final day, also
in NCAA-record time.
Despite those titles, however,
Stanford couldn't keep up with
Texas. Still, there was some con
solation for Sanders. In her first
year at the collegiate level she won
three individual NCAA titles, a
relay title and won both high
point and NCAA Swimmer of the
Year awards.
So Stanford swimming fans
can get their shorts, their fan and
their lemonade because Summer's
here to stav.

hobble Into Final Four

If 1990 was a season of destiny
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team, 1991 seemed to be just
the opposite. After winning the
school's first-ever NCAA crown in
the sport, three impact players
graduated.

But the cupboard wasn't com
pletely bare. The Cardinal had
Trisha Stevens, the NCAA
champs' top scorer, except when
her sore knees forced her to miss
games. And the team had Julie
Zeilstra, the leading scorer this
year, except when her sore achilles
heels forced her to miss games.
But the Cardinal put together a
very succesful season. Stevens'
season ended in the regional semi
final when she blew out her knee,
but the Cardinal still beat both
Washington and Georgia.
Zeilstra's season ended during
warm-ups prior to the national
semifinal against Tennessee. But,
despite playing without two
superstars, Sonja Henning and
her Cardinal teammates scared
the Lady Volunteers for 40 min
utes before finally seeing their
improbable run come to an end.

r Rouse makes it back
in the nick of time

There was no question Jeff
Rouse was one of the world's top
backstrokers going into 1991.
Under current international
rules, no one had swum the 100-
meter backstroke any faster than
he had.
When he began the year by set
ting two meet records and win
ning two gold medals at the World
Championships — in the 100-
meter backstroke and the 400-
meter medley relay — it seemed
Rouse was going to be even better
this year. Then, midway into the
collegiate season, he broke his
right wrist after slipping on some
steps as his home.
Rouse missed most of the
remainder of the season, although
he swam in the dual meet against
California. But he competed with
his wrist heavily taped.
When the NCAA Champi
onships rolled around, Rouse's
first race was swimming the lead
off leg on the 400-yard medley
relay. He swam the 100 yards in
46.63 seconds, shattering David
Berkoffs American record of
47.02.
For good measure he swam a
46.99 — the second-fastest time
ever — to win the 100 backstroke
the next day.
