# Freshman Notah Begay is used to being first
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Notah Begay is used to 'firsts.'
He is the first Native American to go to
Albuquerque Academy in Albuquerque,
N.M. in the sixth grade and continue his
studies all the way through to high school
graduation.
Half Pueblo and half Navajo, Begay is
the only golfer at the Albuquerque
Academy to ever have played five years of
varsity golf en route to being New Mexico
state champion his final two years and first
team All-American his senior campaign. "I
pretty much dominated the high school
level in New Mexico," he said.
The freshman on the Cardinal men's
golf team is the only full-blooded Native
American to be currently playing at the
NCAA level of golf. The only other Native
American golfer that can be compared to
Begay is Rod Curl, who played on the PGA
Tour in the 19705.
"I'm very proud," Begay said. "I'm play
ing a game not meant for minorities, and
there still aren't many playing right now."
And in his first season on the Cardinal
men's golf team, Begay has made an imme
diate impact in making the team competi
tive and hungry. Thanks in part to him, the
team is entering today's NCAA Champi
onships for the first time in coach Wally
Goodwin's four-year career on The Farm.
"He is a boy Cinderella type story,"
Goodwin said. "And he's nowhere near con
cluded with the story."
After last year's squad missed the cut-off
for NCAAs by two strokes, Begay made cer
tain that the Cardinal didn't set a prece
dent in his hometown of Albuquerque last
week. With Begay's 219, second-best on the
team behind fellow freshman phenom
Casey Martin, he led the Cardinal to an
impressive third-place finish, two strokes

behind the two top ranked teams in the
nation, Arizona and Arizona State.
Begay has made the Cardinal believers
that they can turn some heads in the 72-
hole tourney that concludes Saturday.
"This will be a good chance to get some
recognition, some respect for Stanford golf
that has been overlooked," he said. "A top
-10 finish would be great."
When he arrived on The Farm Begay
knew that he was going to be in for a
rebuilding experience. Four seniors gradu
ated last year, and the team was composed
of essentially all rookies with the exception
of junior Christian Cevaer.
"I was recruited by virtually every west
ern school — New Mexico, UTEI} the Ari
zona schools, UNLV and Stanford — that
had a golfing program" Begay said. "But I
liked the fact that I would be playing right
away. I didn't want to redshirt.
"I knew that our program was young,
but with the addition of Casey Martin I felt
that we could turn the program around
over the years here."
He knew that the Cardinal had a solid
foundation with Cevaer, considered the best
linkster ever to play collegiate golf at Stan
ford, and that the team just needed a
"spark plug."
A spark plug he has been. "Youngsters
clear up to the ninth grade want to come
here now because of Notah," Goodwin said.
"He's the perfect kind of athlete to be
coached: He wants to be coached. He can
spend an entire day putting and not get
tired of it. His recognition of his shortcom
ings make him one of a kind."
Begay has always seemed to thrive on
competition. "I don't see myself as a Native
American trying to prove a point, just as
another competitor looking to win," he
said.
"He loves competition," Goodwin said.
"He isn't scared to play right up there with

Phil Mickelson (the two-time defending
NCAA champion) as he did at Regionals."
"I started playing at six, but I just
played, hacking the ball with no real form,"
Begay said. But when he was nine, he won
his first golf tournament. At 10, he won his
first New Mexico state title, and at 14, his
first national crown.
However, Begay was not a one-sport ath
lete in the least. At Albuquerque Academy,
he won two state championships in basket
ball, and played on two state runner-up soc

cer teams. But the 5-foot-11, 175-pounder
realized that "I didn't have the speed or
height to pursue the other two sports."
Begay, proud of the so-called obstacles he
has had to overcome, is always in want of a
challenge. "There are always some people
who feel that I don't belong where I'm
playing, but I've always done my talking
with my golf club,"he said. "There are a lot
more people out there because I can play
golf well and they keep me going along with
myself."

tain that the Cardinal didn't set a prece
dent in his hometown of Albuquerque last
week. With Begay's 219, second-best on the
team behind fellow freshman phenom
Casey Martin, he led the Cardinal to an
impressive third-place finish, two strokes

behind the two top ranked teams in the
nation, Arizona and Arizona State.
Begay has made the Cardinal believers
that they can turn some heads in the 72-
hole tourney that concludes Saturday.
"This will be a good chance to get some
recognition, some respect for Stanford golf
that has been overlooked," he said. "A top
-10 finish would be great."
When he arrived on The Farm Begay
knew that he was going to be in for a
rebuilding experience. Four seniors gradu
ated last year, and the team was composed
of essentially all rookies with the exception
of junior Christian Cevaer.
"I was recruited by virtually every west
ern school — New Mexico, UTEI} the Ari
zona schools, UNLV and Stanford — that
had a golfing program" Begay said. "But I
liked the fact that I would be playing right
away. I didn't want to redshirt.
"I knew that our program was young,
but with the addition of Casey Martin I felt
that we could turn the program around
over the years here."
He knew that the Cardinal had a solid
foundation with Cevaer, considered the best
linkster ever to play collegiate golf at Stan
ford, and that the team just needed a
"spark plug."
A spark plug he has been. "Youngsters
clear up to the ninth grade want to come
here now because of Notah," Goodwin said.
"He's the perfect kind of athlete to be
coached: He wants to be coached. He can
spend an entire day putting and not get
tired of it. His recognition of his shortcom
ings make him one of a kind."
Begay has always seemed to thrive on
competition. "I don't see myself as a Native
American trying to prove a point, just as
another competitor looking to win," he
said.
"He loves competition," Goodwin said.
"He isn't scared to play right up there with

Phil Mickelson (the two-time defending
NCAA champion) as he did at Regionals."
"I started playing at six, but I just
played, hacking the ball with no real form,"
Begay said. But when he was nine, he won
his first golf tournament. At 10, he won his
first New Mexico state title, and at 14, his
first national crown.
However, Begay was not a one-sport ath
lete in the least. At Albuquerque Academy,
he won two state championships in basket
ball, and played on two state runner-up soc

cer teams. But the 5-foot-11, 175-pounder
realized that "I didn't have the speed or
height to pursue the other two sports."
Begay, proud of the so-called obstacles he
has had to overcome, is always in want of a
challenge. "There are always some people
who feel that I don't belong where I'm
playing, but I've always done my talking
with my golf club,"he said. "There are a lot
more people out there because I can play
golf well and they keep me going along with
myself."
