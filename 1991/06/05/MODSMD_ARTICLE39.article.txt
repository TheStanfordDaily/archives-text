# Service thrives under Milton
## 
### Dan Stearns Staff writer 
In the summer of 1983, Catherine Milton came to
Stanford with an idea.
Her plan, sponsored by University President Don
ald Kennedy, was to "research and investigate" the
possibilities of a public service program for Stanford
students. At the time, Milton said Stanford was
known on the East Coast for being a "first class aca
demic university with no reputation for public ser
vice and policy."
After eight years of research and investigation,
Milton sits today in the director's office of perhaps
the busiest building on campus: the Haas Public Ser
vice Center.
Directing hundreds of students and Haas' numer
ous public service programs, Milton works up to 16
hours a day â€” sometimes even on weekends.
"She's the luckiest thing that ever happened to
Stanford," Kennedy said during Haas' annual open
house honoring the John Gardner/Echoing Green
fellowship recipients Friday.
But prior to directing Haas, Milton had little idea
she would get involved in public service.
Milton graduated from Mount Holyoke College in
Massachusetts with a degree in English and political
science. She later moved to Washington, D.C., where
she worked in several parts of the government,
including the Senate and the Department of the
Treasury.
During her 15 years in Washington, she also
wrote five books about criminal justice issues.
It was there that Milton first met Kennedy, who
was then head of the Food and Drug Administration
under President Carter.
Today, Milton and Kennedy have teamed up to
lead Haas to national prominence and acclaim, but
Milton said that in her first meeting with Kennedy
she was not "on his side," so to speak.
Their first meeting was a debate between the FDA

and Department of Treasury as to
whether labels should be put on
alcohol containers warning women
of the dangers of drinking while
pregnant.
The Department of Treasury, which
Milton represented, held the posi
tion that warning labels should not
be put on the containers. "But I
agreed with IKennedyJ, however,
and I was pregnant at the time."

After Kennedy had been at Stanford for several
years, he asked Milton to come to Stanford and
develop a public service program.
"When I first was here I was in my office all alone
with hardly any furniture, but I finally got a desk,"
Milton said. "The phone started to ring off the hook
with both students and community people saying,
'Can I help?'"
During Milton's first few months at Stanford,
several summer fellowship programs, the You Can
Make a Difference Conference, the Gardner fellow
ships, Stanford in Washington and the Stanford Vol
unteer Network were developed.
Milton added that she has high hopes for future
work at Haas. "I'm very interested in having stu
dents ask questions and to really be able to con
tribute to long-term solutions on issues such as
homelessness," she said.
"It is not enough to have students going out to the
homeless and say, 'That's really too bad, and here
let's try to help them out by serving them some
food.'
"That's important but I think it is equally impor
tant for the students to ask, 'Why are there homeless
now, has this problem gotten worse and what can we
do about it?"' she said.
Milton said that for the future she wants to create
a partnership with the faculty that integrates solu
tions to social problems into the Stanford curricu
lum.
