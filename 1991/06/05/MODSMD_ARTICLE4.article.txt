# Use of Stanford name in diet ads leads to lawsuit
## 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld Staff writer 
Stanford filed a lawsuit Monday against
a nationally-advertised diet plan and a
Menlo Park magazine.
The University is suing Nutri-System
for its "unauthorized as well as false and
misleading use of Stanford's name and
seal," said Susan Hoerger, senior university
counsel. One of the latest Nutri-System
advertisements is titled, "Stanford Faculty
Members Rate Nutri-System 1."
The University also took action against
the magazine Healthline, its parent com
pany Healthline Printing Co., and its editor
in chief, Stanford Clinical Assoc. Prof. Paul
Insel, for the use of Stanford's seal and for
a statement claiming that a study on Nutri-
System was published "in collaboration
with the Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention, Stanford University

School of Medicine."
Inset's secretary said yesterday he was
not prepared to issue a statement.
But University officials said the study
had not received official University hacking
or approval.
"Stanford University has not conducted
any research involving Nutri-System and
does not approve of or endorse Nutri-Sys
tem," Hoerger said.
Stanford officials also said Healthline
received $25,000 to feature Nutri-System
on the magazine's cover and in an article
written by "a credible Stanford University
health care professional."
According to the Stanford complaint, the
magazine also granted Nutri-System the
right to "prior review and approval of the
article and all photographs and graphic
materials" appearing in it.
The May 1991 issue of Health
line had a larger distribution than
usual, appearing in grocery stores
nationwide. The magazine fea
tured a cover depicting some
Nutri-System products and an
article written by Dr. Waldon
Roth, a professor in psychiatry at
the Medical School.
The article ranked Nutri-Sys
tem first of 16 diet-plans and
described it as the "preferred pro
gram overall."
Nutri-System's latest national

advertisement campaign was cen
tered around this article.
Roth said yesterday that "the
main controversy is whether
Healthline has the right to use"
Stanford's name and logo.
He added that he believes that
"the Nutri-System ads imply a
much closer relationship with
Stanford than is real."
Roth also said that a psychia
trist writing a story rating diets
could be perceived as unusual,
but he added that he is "inter
ested in diets" and had co
authored with Insel a book on
"health and wellness for college
students in the United States."
While admitting that the arti

cle only reflected his opinion of
the diet programs, Roth said it
was based on "a research-kind of
study where we dealt with written
sources."
The suit is the latest develop
ment in a controversy that has
been building since last Thursday,
when Stanford communicated its
concerns to Nutri-System.
The next day, Hoerger publicly
asked Nutri-System "to correct
the wrong impression its adver
tising has created."
Nutri-System replied Sunday
by threatening to take "appropri
ate action against Stanford and
the attorney involved for the
statements that were made," said

Thym Smith, the company's vice
president for public affairs.
Smith added that Nutri-Sys
tem was "stunned and outraged"
by Stanford's complaint and that
they had received written permis
sion for "every use of the verbiage
in advertising, video and printed
materials."
Jenny Craig Inc. and Weight
Watchers International Inc.,
whose diet plans were rated low
in the article, also filed separate
suits in San Francisco and New
York against Nutri-System.
