# Use of Stanford name in diet ads leads to lawsuit
## 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld Staff writer 
Stanford filed a lawsuit Monday against
a nationally-advertised diet plan and a
Menlo Park magazine.
The University is suing Nutri-System
for its "unauthorized as well as false and
misleading use of Stanford's name and
seal," said Susan Hoerger, senior university
counsel. One of the latest Nutri-System
advertisements is titled, "Stanford Faculty
Members Rate Nutri-System 1."
The University also took action against
the magazine Healthline, its parent com
pany Healthline Printing Co., and its editor
in chief, Stanford Clinical Assoc. Prof. Paul
Insel, for the use of Stanford's seal and for
a statement claiming that a study on Nutri-
System was published "in collaboration
with the Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention, Stanford University

School of Medicine."
Inset's secretary said yesterday he was
not prepared to issue a statement.
But University officials said the study
had not received official University hacking
or approval.
"Stanford University has not conducted
any research involving Nutri-System and
does not approve of or endorse Nutri-Sys
tem," Hoerger said.
Stanford officials also said Healthline
received $25,000 to feature Nutri-System
on the magazine's cover and in an article
written by "a credible Stanford University
health care professional."
According to the Stanford complaint, the
magazine also granted Nutri-System the
right to "prior review and approval of the
article and all photographs and graphic
materials" appearing in it.
