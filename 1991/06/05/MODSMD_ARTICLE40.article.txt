# Bing celebrates anniversary
## Nursery school commemorates 25 years of learning 
### Doug Miro 
During the 25th anniversary
party for Bing Nursery School
last Saturday, two alumnae
crawled among the rungs of the
domed monkey bars and remi
nisced on their years at Stan
ford's laboratory preschool.
They discussed the relevance
of the psychology experiments
in which they had participated
during their years at the school.
"I kind of always wondered
why I did them," 9-year-old
Kimberly Knight said to 8-year
old Natalie Shank.
"I mean, we knew our own
brains," Natalie nodded in
agreement.
Rather than being angered
by this somewhat critical com
ment by alumnae, psychologists
and teachers affiliated with
Bing smiled contentedly. After
all, Bing founder Edith Dowley
made individuality and inquisi
tive thought a goal of the school
in 1966, according to the
school's director, Jean Lepper.
The celebration began in the
morning with a symposium
titled, "Toward a Deeper Under
standing of the Development of
the Young Child." Seven Stan
ford faculty members spoke
gratefully on the importance of
the nursery school and on their
research there.

In addition to the specially
designed "game rooms" where
children perform certain tasks,
the teaching environment
encourages students to express
themselves in as many ways as
possible, providing a unique lab
oratory for the professors.
Assoc. Education Prof. Rob
bie Case said he uses Bing, "not
as much as a place to conduct
studies, but more often, a place
to find new things to study."
Many famous theories devel
oped from research at Bing were
discussed by their authors. Psy
chology Prof. Albert Bandura
talked about his studies of how
television violence affects chil
dren.
"Children who have observed
an adult be aggressive on TV
model this behavior and are less
restrained in terms of their
aggression," he said. He
described one girl who, upon
hearing that her grandmother
had died, asked, "Who shot
her?"
Bandura has testified before
Congress on many of these find
ings and used results of his
studies to help pressure adver
tisers to reduce violence in
advertisements.
Psychology Prof. Ellen Mark
man spoke on her studies about
children's ability to learn words.
She said children are "predis

posed to assumptions that
enable them to learn words."
Children can learn the names of
things without being taught by
narrowing down the possibili
ties, she said. This explains, in
part, how children learn words
at the rate of 8-9 per day.
Psychology Prof. John Flavell
said children at Bing led him to
his widely used theory of chil
dren's intellectual growth.
Other speakers in the sympo
sium included Eleanor Maccoby,
psychology professor emeritus.
Alumni, current students
and researchers congregated for
an afternoon party concluding
the celebration. The "game
rooms" were transformed into
little classrooms where
researchers further described
their studies.
While their parents learned
about the research they had
participated in, children
directed a string quartet and
reminisced on their nursery
school days.
Peter and Helen Bing, who
were honored during the morn
ing symposium for their gener
ous contributions to the nursery
school, conducted an open dis
cussion about how the school
helpa undergraduate education
through interaction with devel
opmental psychology classes.
