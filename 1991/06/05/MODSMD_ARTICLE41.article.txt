# Berkeley professor's article upsets rape education group
## 
### Brad O'Donnell Staff writer 
Neil Gilbert, a UC-Berkeley professor, has
members of the Stanford Rape Education Project
up in arms with a recent article claiming that its
1988 survey exaggerates the number of campus
rapes.
Project members said Gilbert's article, "Sexual
Assault: The Phantom Epidemic," published last
week in a UC-Berkeley social science quarterly, is
insensitive and inaccurate. "He's out of line about
our survey," said project member Kathy Zonana.
While Gilbert maintained that all types of rape
are very serious problems, he accused Mary Koss
of the University of Arizona and the Stanford
Rape Education Project of providing exaggerated
survey information that trivializes rape.
Koss' study indicated that one out of every
four women at the University of Arizona has
experienced either a rape or an attempted rape.
And the 1988 Stanford survey on Attitudes,
Awareness, and Experience of Sexual Violence
found that 29 percent of undergraduate women
and 12 percent of men said they had been forced
into a sexual encounter against their will.
Gilbert wrote that Koss' study did not reflect
the truth because 73 percent of the women Koss
considered rape victims did not consider them
selves victims and 40 percent of them had sex
with the same man again.
Kathy O'Brien, a Rape Education Project

member, disagreed with Gilbert's assessment.
"When asked if they have ever been raped, most
women will say no, but if asked if they have ever
been forced through physical violence or threat of
physical violence to have sex, many will say yes."
Gilbert noted that while a yearly survey of
50,000 households conducted by the U.S. Bureau
of Justice Statistics agreed with both studies'
findings that the majority of rapes are acquain
tance rapes, it reported the frequency of those
rapes as 1 in 1,000.
"The Bureau's survey simply asked people if
they thought they had been raped," he said in an
interview. He added that Koss' survey employed a
much broader definition of rape.
"That strikes me as a researcher's imposition
of a definition upon women," he said.
O'Brien admitted that the Stanford survey's
definition of rape, which includes threatening to
use force, overwhelming someone with argumen
tative pressure or giving them drugs or alcohol,
differs from California state law.
But "just because a rape can't be prosecuted
doesn't mean that it is any less traumatic for the
victim," she said.
Gilbert does not accept this definition of rape.
"How can psychological pressures be included?
That trivializes the crime. It's an injustice to
women who have been forcibly raped, and it
degrades women by portraying them as incompe
tent and helpless creatures who can't say no
under pressure."
