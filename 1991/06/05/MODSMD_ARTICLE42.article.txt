# Women's Center to be moved
## Fire Truck House will become new home starting summer 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
The Office of Student Activities
decided last week that the
Women's Center will move this
summer to the ground floor of the
Fire Truck House.
Groups currently occupying
the space will be moved to the
Knoll Annex and to the room next
to the Toyon Eating Clubs, where
the center is currently located.
"In the context of the Univer
sity as a whole, the move will
make women's issues more cen
tralized, more focused," said
Women's Center coordinator
Quynh Tran. The new center will
facilitate communication between
the groups to be housed there,
including the Society for Women
Engineers, Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority and the Rape Education
Project, she added.
About 20 student groups cur
rently occupy the office space in
the Fire Truck House; however,
students in these groups said
most of the space is not actively
used.
Most of the students in these
groups did not object to the reloca
tion of the Women's Center, but
many said they weren't given an
adequate role in the decision-mak

ing process surrounding the
move.
"On the whole, it was just
unfortunate that the communica
tion didn't work better," said Jen
nifer Fox, a junior involved with
Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford, which is now
located in the Fire Truck House.
"We were never involved in the
process at all."
Groups currently located in the
Fire Truck House must be packed
to move by June 14, according to
Bobbi Braden, director of Tresid
der Union. They will be assigned
to new offices following an assess
ment of their needs.
This assessment will be con
ducted by the Office of Student
Activities, which is responsible for
the office space in the Fire Truck
House, next to the Eating Clubs
and in the trailers behind the
Knoll.
"I think that for the first time
we're really looking at student's
needs, so we can provide for them.
And maintain them — for a
change," said Jeanette Smith-
Laws, building services manager
for Tresidder.
The Fire Truck House will also
be remodeled this summer to pro
vide the Women's Center with
work space, a lounge area and a

conference room large enough to
house the center's library.
Although the student groups
receiving office space in the
Women's Center are involved to
some extent with women s issues,
not all of them define themselves
that way. Jeff Weinstein, a junior
involved with Project HEAR
(Heightening Education about
Acquaintance Rape), said his
group's goal is to show how "sex
ual assault is something that
affects everyone."
Weinstein said he is somewhat
concerned that men who would
otherwise be interested in joining
Project HEAR might not feel com
fortable working in the Women's
Center but does not feel it will be
too great a problem.
The center's organizers say
they are enthusiastic about shar
ing office space with other campus
groups involved with women's
issues and working with the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center, which is located on
the second floor of the Fire Truck
House.
