In addition to the residence
based program, the health educa
tors will maintain a resource cen
ter at Tresidder Union. Hoffman
said the group has received a
$10,000 donation from the Stan
ford Mothers' Club to start the
center.
The purpose of the center will
be to provide a central location
where students can get general
health information as well as
referrals to various student health
services on campus. Hoffman said
the health educators have the sup
port of a number of such student
groups, including Body Image,
Food and Self-Esteem and Risk
Reduction of Intoxicants in the
Stanford Community.
The advisers can coordinate
the activities of these student
groups to give them wider expo
sure on campus, she said.
Senior Kirsten Sword, a volun
teer for Body Image, Food and
Self-Esteem, said such coordina
tion will be "a helpful kind of
thing." The center will provide
more publicity and outreach
opportunities for her group, and
"in turn, we can educate the [edu
cators! on our perspective," she
added.

Next year, harried Stanford
students will be able to get infor
mation on stress relief, referrals
to student health services and
even free condoms from fellow
residents.
A new group of volunteer peer
health educators will act as stu
dent health advisers in campus
residences next year. Program
chair Heidi Hoffman, a junior,
said the students will be like
health resident assistants.
They will be trained in a course
given next fall and will start work
ing in the dorms by winter quar
ter, she said. The course will cover
basic public-health issues such as
sleep and eating disorders, stress
reduction and alcoholism. Car
diopulmonary resuscitation will
also be taught.
Hoffman said the advisers' pri
mary role will be to educate their
dormmates on health issues
through dorm-based program
ming. "We do not want to be like
mini-doctors," she said.
The students will not be able to
dispense anything besides "band
aids and condoms," she added.
