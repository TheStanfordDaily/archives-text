# University's tax firm declared bankrupt
## Stanford, hospital are currently suing Hamilton Taft for breach-of-contract 
### Peter Cousins Staff writer 
A federal judge ordered Hamil
ton Taft and Co. — a payroll-tax
firm currently being sued by the
University and Stanford Hospital
— into bankruptcy Friday
because of a report that shows the
company owes millions of dollars
to clients in lost tax funds.
Senior University Counsel
Susan Hoerger said the order will
not affect Stanford's lawsuit
against Hamilton Taft. She said
that once the firm filed for
bankruptcy there was an auto
matic stay of civil litigation,

meaning that the lawsuit will not
resume until the bankruptcy is
resolved.
The University and hospital —
which are separate legal entities
— are suing Hamilton Taft for
breach-of-contract. Both organi
zations hired the firm to process
the taxes withheld from employ
ees and pay the appropriate
amounts to various government
agencies.
The firm currently owes the
hospital more than $3 million and
the University more than
$200,000.
The court appointed a trustee
of the company to determine

whether its assets are sufficient to
meet its liabilities. The trustee,
attorney Frederick Wyle, reported
that Hamilton Taft owes more
than $90 million in unpaid payroll
taxes but has only $5.8 million in
the bank.
Typical procedure at Hamilton
Taft was for clients to forward
funds each pay day to the com
pany, which was then supposed to
send the appropriate amount to
each tax agency. The firm usually
did not charge for its service but
was allowed to invest the funds
for several days before they were
due and keep the profit.
Wyle reported that Hamilton

Taft owner Connie Armstrong
instead used client money for a
$10 million cattle ranch and
house, real estate investments, oil
and gas leases and a helicopter.
Hoerger said the trustee is con
tinuing to assess the financial
resources of Hamilton Taft, and
this may result in a percentage of
the funds owed to clients being
paid back.
"I don't expect [the civil litiga
tionl will be happening with any
great haste," said Hoerger.
