# Cowell staffers 'in the dark'
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Staff members at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center say they are
facing uncertainty because of
plans for a School of Medicine pro
gram to take over student care
there next fall.
Effective Sept. 1, the Medical
School's Faculty Practice Pro
gram will administer care at Cow
ell, ending the center's 45-year
relationship with the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation.
To continue working at Cowell,
staff members employed by the
foundation will have to apply to
the Medical School's program for
positions similar to the ones they
hold now, Cowell Director Harvey
Weinstein said.
Gene Phillips, director of pri
mary care services at Cowell, said
the guidelines and timetable of
the transition have not been
clearly communicated to employ
ees by the administration.
"We're out in the dark," he
said. "There is definitely a lack of
communication on the adminis
tration's part. None of us has seen
a job description for the new posi
tions, and we're not aware of the
administrative process that will
determine the new jobs."
"I don't have the information
yet to decide whether I'll stay,"
Phillips added. "Most of the staff
feels the same way. The primary
issue is uncertainty."
The foundation is a group of
700 physicians, nurses and sup
port staff, 50 of whom are
employed at Cowell. The Medical

School group will be composed of
faculty members who currently
practice at the Stanford Medical
Center.
Weinstein said he is "puzzled"
that staff members are concerned
about a lack of communication.
"There has been a tremendous
amount of discussion," Weinstein
said. "This has been a year-long
process. More than 20 people were
involved."
Weinstein said he made the
decision to switch to the Medical
School plan based on the recom
mendation of a committee of stu
dents, faculty and staff that con
sidered proposals by the founda
tion and the Medical School dur
ing the past year.
"The Medical School's proposal
was just more creative and imagi
native than Palo Alto's," Wein
stein said.
The new program will provide
"the backup of a rich array of
resources at the Medical School
that we hadn't had before,"
including a new computer system,
improved psychiatric care and
access to the Stanford Center for
Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion, Weinstein said.
"We were not unhappy with
Palo Alto's service," Weinstein
emphasized. "They are probably
one of the best clinics in the coun
try, and they have served Stanford
students and us extremely well.
But in the long run, the Medical
School will give us access to a
wider range of services."
But Irene Cannon, a staff
physician at Cowell for the past
nine years, said she is concerned

about the Medical School's capa
bility to provide normal, everyday
clinical care to students.
"In the past, the Medical
School hasn't been noted for giv
ing good clinical care for normal
cases — they've always been more
specialized," Cannon said.
One non-physician staff mem
ber at Cowell, who wished not to
be identified, said, "We're all con
cerned about the care the Medical
School will provide. For 45 years,
we've used the Palo Alto clinic.
Most of the bugs in the system
had been worked out. I think we
all have our own doubts."
Mary O'Connor, assistant
director of the Stanford Help Cen
ter — where faculty members get
their health care — said that at a
meeting with a group of about 10
Cowell employees on May 14, she
sensed "that employees felt they
weren't being given sufficient
recognition for good work."
"And they said there aren't
enough guidelines for how to com
pete for the new jobs," she added.
Cannon, who participated in
the May 14 meeting, said she is
also concerned with the adminis
tration's lack of communication
about the transition.
"There hasn't been real com
munication in terms of job secu
rity, job descriptions, job benefits,
who will be hired and who won't,"
she said, adding that "there was
no explanation" for the decision to
switch to the Medical School plan.
John Dorman, a physician and
the director of public relations at
Cowell, said the transition "is a
pretty complicated deal."
