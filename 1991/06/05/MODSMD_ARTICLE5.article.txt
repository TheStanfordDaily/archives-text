# Chile may reopen fall '92 as two-quarter program

While the overseas studies program in
Santiago will not accept students for next
spring, it will most likely reopen the follow
ing fall — as a two-quarter program.
The closing of the Chile program has
been entirely misunderstood, said Assoc.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl, a mem
ber of the panel assigned to evaluate the
program.
"There was a sense that this campus is
off the books already, and that is just not
true," said Karl, also director of the Insti
tute for International Studies. "We on the
panel are proceeding on the assumption
that this program is ongoing."

Both Karl and Overseas Studies Deputy
Director Corbin Smith said yesterday that
the closure was never announced formally
because the program has always been con
sidered a two-year pilot. They addecl that
the evaluation does not signify a permanent
end to the Chile program.
Evaluation of the program while it is
closed next spring will allow the nine-mem
ber panel to finalize changes in it, including
the prospective move to fall and winter
quarters.
"You're still just getting used to the pro
gram after (the current length of) nine
weeks. It really ought to be longer," said
senior Namino Glantz, one of two student
panel members.
The program will hopefully be length

ened, Karl said, because student response
has been enthusiastic and because the San
tiago program is the only Stanford center
currently operating in a Latin American or
Third World country.
Also, the current spring program falls
into the colder season south of the equator;
a fall-winter program would coincide with
more pleasant seasons in Chile, Karl said
Suspension of the program has been
viewed by some, in light of the decision last
fall to close the overseas program in Tours,
as a financial move. But Karl disagrees.
"We made the decision Ito close and eval
uate the Santiago program] last year —
before the budget crisis hit. It was not to
save money but to work on expanding the

program," Karl said. However, lack of Uni
versity funding should make finances for
the program relatively tight.
Karl offered two other reasons for the
temporary closure: Administrators could
not easily staff and evaluate the program
simultaneously, and with the proposed
change to a fall-winter schedule the pro
gram would have to run for three straight
quarters if it were not suspended.
Several other changes will also be con
sidered, Glantz said. There will be a
stronger emphasis on providing research
opportunities for students, including better
access to advisers, when the program
reopens. The panel will also try to work
more with other institutions in the area.
