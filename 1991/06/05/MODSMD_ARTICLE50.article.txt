# Medics program under review
## Local paramedics' response times and actions to be studied 
### Gabriel Klarsfeld Staff writer 
Stanford and Palo Alto residents will soon be
the beneficiaries of an improved paramedic pro
gram.
Under pressure by firefighters and concerned
citizens, the Palo Alto Fire Department has com
missioned a study to improve its response time
and coverage.
"While the population has grown and the call
volume has skyrocketed, the program has
changed very little" over the years, said Tony Spi
taleri, president of the local Professional Fire
fighters Union. Simultaneous calls often lead to
long delays in on-scene responses by paramedics,
he said.
"A second call comes in pretty regularly," said
Spitaleri. "We have to wait 18 minutes for the
next unit. If I defibrillate someone I don't want to
have to wait 10 minutes for an ambulance. We
sometimes get as many as three simultaneous
calls."
While the Palo Alto Fire Department responds
to most of the calls at Stanford and in Palo Alto,
30 percent of the calls are answered by neighbor
ing units because the Palo Alto unit is already
responding to a call.
The delay is usually caused by the unavailabil
ity of these units from neighboring zones. The
nearest ones are generally the private Pacmed
units employed by Santa Clara county.
"The city of Palo Alto is an independent
provider of [emergency medical services]," said
Bill Collins, the services' administrator for Santa
Clara County. The county units respond on a
mutual-aid basis. "They are not always ready.
They are not positioned to respond," he said.
Assistant Chief Ruben Grijalva of the Palo Alto
Fire Department said, "The coverage we get from
Pacmed doesn't meet our needs."

In the northern part of the county the Pacmed
units "have problems with response and cover
age. Their average response time is 17 minutes.
Our goal is an average of 6 minutes," Grijalva
explained.
The paramedic program consists of a full-time
unit and, since last month, an interim second unit
when staffing permits.
"I believe responding to at least 95 percent of
the calls is a realistic objective," said Grijalva.
The other calls would be handled by local Pacmed
units.
Some of the possible options to improve the
paramedic program include altering the triage
system to establish response priorities for the
paramedics, creating joint firefighting and
paramedic units, renegotiating the county's cov
erage to include the northern parts, adding a new
fully staffed unit or a combination of any of these.
"We've tried tandem operations, with a fire
fighting unit and paramedic," Spitaleri argued.
"We've tried two paramedic units, but we're short
of people because of injuries and burn-out. The
best system is two vans full-time."
A second van would also be a source of revenue
for the program, enabling the paramedics to
transport more of the patients in their area. The
fire department bills each patient for transporta
tion to a local hospital.
The paramedic program currently employs 18
people. Revenues exceed half a million dollars
while the program's operating cost for the city of
Palo Alto is about $900,000, resulting in about a
$300,000 deficit. The cost of staffing a second
unit would be about $150,000 per year.
"We're not in the profit-making business," said
Spitaleri.
A second draft of a study of the Palo Alto
paramedic program by a consulting firm special
izing in emergency medical services, including
pre-hospital care, will be completed by June 10.
