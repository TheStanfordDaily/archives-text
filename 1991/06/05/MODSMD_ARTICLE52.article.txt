## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S CLIMACTIC WEEKLY THE
						YEAR IN REVIEW 
### Joel Stein 
People are so simple. They want to have everything wrapped
up into neat little Wonder Bread balls that they can throw at
the back of their little brothers' heads whenever Mom looks
the other way.
Well, if that's what you're looking for, you've turned to the
wrong page, bucko. I'm not about to put on my Mary Hart
smile and give you the "Ten Hottest Frat Parties and/or Budget Crises of
the Year." First of all, I ain't got the legs for it.
Second, things just weren't that simple this year. Alas, oh-so- much
has changed since just one short year ago. Sure, we've had our troubles,
but then again, we've also had our troubles. We can handle it, though.
Better yet, we can ignore it. After all, we're Stanford.
For our beloved University, this was the year of the indirect cost. The
year of the jackal. The year of the war that was too short for all those cool
protest demonstrations that we've been waiting for ever since we saw
"Woodstock" on PBS.
But we really can't put a label on it, can we? The best we can say is that
20 years from now, these past nine months will have provided some really
silly videos for VH-1.

And, now, in typical Warner Wolf fashion, the year in review ...
• The New Phone System (Day One) — After years of bitter com
plaints and endless petitions, students are no longer forced to undergo
the ordeal of hitting seven long, tedious numbers each time they wish to
make an on-campus call.
Say student activists, "We thought the movement was going to fall
apart in the early '80s with the virtual disappearance of rotary phones,
but through perseverance we've finally gotten here."
It looks like it's gonna be the best year ever.
• Andy Geiger Gets The Axe, The Axe, The Axe (late, Late September)
— The advent of Andy's Yell Leaders and their luxurious felt costumes
marks the Athletic Department's transition into an Ishtaresque money
sucking pit.
To compensate for the debt, the University decides to make students
use pocket change to pay for smaller sporting events, like volleyball and
White Plaza hacky sack games. Students respond angrily by doing less
laundry.
• Kimball Hall Erected Faster Than That Lego Castle Set With The
Confusing Directions (Accurate Dating Impaired By One of Them Ein
stein Laws) — The newest, neatest, nicest dorm on campus is built next
to the Manzanita trailers — Stanford's own version of Shanty Town.
Class warfare is expected next year in Stanford's own, personal "Tale
of Two Cities" hell. Kimballites will deliver speeches from their balconies
to the wretched unguaranteed masses below them.
• Beach Boys Play on Yom Kippur (Tishre 10) — Jews worldwide miss
a post-football celebration in which overweight, middle-aged men, sur
rounded by a ring of scantily clad, pre-pubescent girls, sing songs about
sports cars. Yell Leaders, both Semitic and not, feel "one-upped."
• WE BEAT NOTRE DAME! {Who Cares?) — No one watches the
game, everyone pretends they did and the "scholar/athlete" myth is rein
voked for all of 24 hours. Leftover "Punish the Irish" shirts from last year
are unloaded on freshman dormitories.
• Domestic Partners (Mid-Mid October) — Students faced with the
prospect of an unguaranteed year at Crothers Memorial Hall try to figure
out how to use the new ruling to their own benefit. Most rationalize that
Res Ed won't actually ask them to prove they are gay. They later suffer the
consequences.
• Theta Chi Shower Scene (Midwest October) — In the journalistic
equivalent of television "sweep week," The Daily prostitutes itself by
printing a picture of coeds showering together. Little do they know that
Disney's Touchstone Pictures will pick up the story and base a new movie
starring Daryl Hannah around it.
• Tours Closes (Mid-Late October) — Embarrassed that they mistook
the immensely popular overseas program in Tours, France for "one of
those cheesy, Hardbodies 11-like boat things," the University tries to cover
its mistake with a bunch of lame excuses. "We're just seeking revenge on
the French for all those confusing sauces Robin can't make," explains one
University official.
• Band Banned (So iMte in October That Small Children Are Going
Door to Door, Begging for Food Like in Some Sort of Stephen King Movie)
— The wacky, irreverent band takes one zany step too far when they
attempt a joke about spotted owls in Oregon. In Oregon. What are they
thinking? They escape with only a hand slap and the provision that in the
future all their public statements must be approved by an Athletic
Department moral majority.

• Stanford Professor Accuses Martin Luther King, Jr. of Plagiarizing
(Deep, Cold November) — The academic equivalent of "there is no Santa
Claus" makes for a dark, dreary day.
• Drug and Alcohol Policy Rammed Down University's Throat
(Conveniently Near Thanksgiving) — Radical reforms are instituted in the
University's alcohol and drug policy. Even more silly signs are displayed
at parties and freshmen go home at night with three or four carcinogenic
ink stamps on their hands.
• BIG GAME (November) — Everyone is drunk despite the alcohol
policies of both schools and frozen fruit is thrown like some angry, post
unseasonable-frost, Floridian-farmer version of Flicks.
• Yacht Costs "Inadvertently" Charged to Federal Government
(Early December) — The otherwise proud Stanford Yacht Club comes to
an abrupt close after a proud and illustrious career, "I knew that putting
the capers down on the bill would be too much," admits one Club mem
ber.
• Food Service Serves Turkey and Mashed Potatoes (December 9) —
Students are both shocked and pleased by the wacky new addition.
"Gravy or sans, it's a heck of a meal," exclaims one senior.
