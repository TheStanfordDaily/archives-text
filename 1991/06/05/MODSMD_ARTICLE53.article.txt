Once upon a time, there were two little bears who worked for a news
paper. (Look, you know and we know that bears don't work for
newspapers, but this is our box, so deal with it.) One day, these
bears had an idea: "Let's make the entertainment section of our paper the
best section ever!"
They had big ideas. Big, BIG ideas. Big, BIG, BIG ideas.
And big hair. But that's not the point.
What is the point? Oh yes, big ideas.
They were going to make their section — called Intermission, ironical
ly enough — the biggest, brightest, most colorful it had ever been. They
were going to write about fads, films and food. They were going to enrap
ture, entertain and enthrall their readers.
And they were going to get tattoos.
And leap out of a hot air balloon.
And do everything they ever wanted to do but couldn't afford.
And?
They did their best to enrapture; they went to see films; they jumped
out of a balloon.
As for the tattoos ... we, uh, they aren't telling.
Sorry.

As for entertainment news: Let's get real. It's Dead Week, or Dead Day,
as the case may be, and even if we were to suggest our cultural events of
choice, you wouldn't listen. Let's face it, it would only depress you more to
see all the fun things you were missing.
As you head off into your summertime sunset, however, keep the lively
arts in mind and capitalize on the outdoor theater and summer festivals
that heat up cities across the United States from June to September. (If
you're on the East Coast, the JVC Jazz Festival in New York City is not to
be missed!)
If you're sticking around over the summer, the Mozart festival is still
going strong in San Francisco. But if Mozart isn't your cup of tea and
you're feeling kind of bored, read The Stanford Weekly. Or better yet, write
for us.

So this is it — our last Intermission. Ever. We hope you've enjoyed the
changes we made and the stories we ran. If not, well, we're sorry. You can't
please all of the people all of the time. And you can't please some of the
people any of the time.
But we tried.
Our last hurrah.
Hurray.
Your eleemonsynary friends,
