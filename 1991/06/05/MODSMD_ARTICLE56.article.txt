# A Friendly Face

Interview by Gabriel Klarsfeld

When Stanford students
are asked to name the
people who had the
biggest effect on their
years here, the responses range from
"Donald Kennedy" to "my freshman
RA" to "my freshman roommate" to
"the person who sat two aisles ahead of
me in Poli Sci 1."
Few — if any — students mention
Dean Seldomridge. In fact, reading
this, you probably have no idea who
she is.
But really, you do. Most students
know her, though hardly any know her
name.
Seldomridge, better-known as "the
Bookstore Lady," is the most familiar
face at the Bookstore. So familiar, in
fact, that Ram's Head asked her to star
in Gaieties — twice. What role did she
play?
The Bookstore Lady, of course.
And it was easy for her; it's a role
she's been playing for 19 years. That's
quite a long run; most of this year's
freshman class wasn't even born when
she got the job.
So why has she stayed as long as she
has, watching things change around
her? Exacdy for that reason — Sel
domridge has spent almost two
decades in a unique position to
observe the people coming and going,
and the changes taking place.
If that weren't reason enough, she
loves her job.
And she's good at it, as anyone who
encounters her will tell you. Seldom
ridge is the ultimate people person;
she's always happy and has a smile or a
kind word for customers and co-work-

ers alike. Though she isn't one of the
"big names" at Stanford who makes
national headlines, she is one of the
people who makes Stanford a home
away-from-home.
In short, she is a special person who
helps make Stanford a special place.
Intermission: How can you be happy
every day?
Dean Seldomridge: Laughs. Believe it
or not, I love this; I love doing this job.
Before I started working for the Book
store I didn't know what I wanted to
do. I still don't — maybe because I
haven't completely grown up yet —
but I love being with people.
I guess it really makes a big differ
ence because if you really enjoy doing
something you're going to put your
best foot forward, and it's going to
show. As trite as that sounds, it's true.
It rubs off.
There are days when I come in the
morning and I just want to be left
alone. I think, "Do I have to smile?" I
swear it's always those days somebody
will say something nice to me. And in
a way I go, "Damn you!" Laughs. I
want to be miserable and it turns out
that I can't be. It's like somebody is
watching out for me. It's really neat,
'cause you really get it back, you really
do.
I: So Stanford students haven't been
too bad?
DS: Oh no, not at all. I've been very
lucky, very blessed.
I: Have you ever had an unpleasant

customer?
DS: Sure. It's a challenge to me — I try
to get them to smile; I try to get them
to laugh.
One of the worst things you can do
is say "Have a nice weekend," when
somebody has lost a relative or just
found out he or she flunked. So I
learned to be more sensitive. Depend
ing on how down a person is, I'll say
something like "Hang tough" and then
he'll look up and smile.
I: What are the things you've enjoyed
most?
DS: I've been in Gaieties twice. And I
had always thought that acting was
something I would enjoy doing. I was
in Gaieties in '87 and '89, and it was so
neat. It really felt great out there.
Most of my best moments come
from here, moments with people.
I: Was it fun working with the students
in Gaieties?
DS: Oh, great. I hadn't acted since
sixth-grade camp and I was virtually
hyperventilating. This girl came up to
me and said "Relax, be calm, it'll be all
right. Take deep breaths and relax."
And I was just fine.
I: How about the students? Have you
noticed any huge changes?

DS: Good question. Actually I would
say not. I haven't. They're one of the
reasons I love working here. They are
not backward about talking to anyone.
They've been very good to me. They
really have.
Occasionally they'll come back and
they'll come by the store and say hello.
Its really neat. Like Brian Holloway, is
that his name? Played for the Miami
Dolphins? He came back and that was
very neat. That's extra-special. From
time to time they'll come by with their
parents at graduation time, to have me
meet their parents. Makes me feel sort
of like a mother hen.
I: Does working 19 years at the Book
store seem like a long time?
DS: Actually it doesn't. It's really
strange because it's a very nice place to
work; the people are very nice to work
with.
I: Do you have any regrets?
DS: Every now and again I get fed up
with the system or things don't go the
way I think they should. But I think by
and large, none. I'd do it again, all 19
years. Honestly. Even the painful stuff.
They've allowed me to mature at this
job. I was a real screw-up at the begin
ning and luckily they let me grow up
and kept me here.

I: Has the Bookstore changed a lot
since 1972?
DS: Yeah. Yeah. We've grown. We've
gotten very large. That's our general
manager's pride and joy. He's always
aspired to being the largest college
bookstore in the country. I think we're
tied for it with ... is it Harvard or
MIT? But we've been getting a lot of
compliments from customers on how
nice the Bookstore looks. It's much
airier now.
We started out like a very small,
close-knit family. There were some
people who had graduated from Stan
ford and stayed so that they were here
for years and years.
Most of the old guard is gone. I'd
say half a dozen of us are still here.
Now we have more people who do this
as a temporary thing because retail
jobs don't pay well.
I: Is it more pleasant to work here?
DS: You mean since we've expanded?
No, I wouldn't have thought about it
like that. To me it's the same; I just
moved locations. I get to see out now,
people coming in and stuff. But it
wasn't bad the other way.
I: How about the management?
DS: I think they've been really fair; in
some cases they've been almost too

fair. In the time when everybody else
was laying off all over the Bay Area,
they haven't been.
here. I think that was the biggest thing
for me. They're not like people in the
real world. Most people in the real
world are not as compassionate. And
they put up with a lot before they fire
you. They really, really care. If it
weren't for that I wouldn't be here. I
used to take half-hour coffee breaks,
an hour-and-40-minute lunches and
they just kept reprimanding, but not
firing, me. Anyplace else would have
fired me.
I: This really feels like a home?
DS: It does, it really does. I thought a
few times what would I do if I got fired
or got laid-off or something; where
would I go? It would be really trauma
tizing.
I think I understand what the peo
ple who have been here 30 or 40 years
and are fired feel like.
I: This basically grows on you?
DS: It does. One year flows into the
other and before you know it you've
been here five years, 10 years. It's sort
of like Never Never Land, sort of mel
low and easygoing.


She may never
make the nation
al media, but
most students
will recognize
Dean Seldom
ridge, affection
ately known as
the Bookstore
Lady.
