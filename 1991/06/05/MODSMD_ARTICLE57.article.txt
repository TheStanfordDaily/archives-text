						KEYS TO HIS SUCCESS

The radio stations seem to blur. You are
listening to piano soloist George Win
ston create a beautiful snow-swept
landscape. Suddenly, Nine Inch Nails
pounder TVent Reznor cuts in with a
dark, sorrowful anti-ballad. The songs blend.
There is no static. So what is going on?
Junior Michael Halaas can give you an idea.
With the release of the first compact disc of his
piano solos, titled "No Disguises," Halaas has
challenged the conventions of the New Age music
format.
Halaas, who has individually designed his
neurobiology major, says he's flattered when peo
ple compare his music to the piano archetype
Winston, whose music helped inspire him to start
piano again once he reached Stanford, after a hia
tus in high school. He began serious classical
study at age 5.
But, he says, "George plays a lot of soft stuff.
Mellow, relaxing stuff. I think mine is more intro
spective. And it's louder."
Several of the solos on "No Disguises" consist
of sustained, deep and pained tones that Halaas
contrasts simultaneously with a harmonious
stream of higher notes.
"The best kind of art makes you think about
things for a while. It's not a split-second thing,"
he says. "I've always liked abstract things. I like
trying to create something that is powerful, that
can grab people a little bit.
"I have this thing with intensity," says Halaas,
who wore a Nine Inch Nails concert T-shirt
underneath an open button-down Oxford in a
recent performance. Halaas says Reznor's perfor
mances are "just raw He gets down to the
bone. There's nothing in front of the music."
For those who don't know, Nine Inch Nails is
a throaty punk and hard rock hybrid of a group,
and Halaas says he hopes his piano solos have the
same intensity as their music.
"There's a stereotype to New Age that no one
really listens to it, that you just put it on at dinner
parties. Hopefully mine is ... not like that," he
says. "You can think about it and not get bored."
Halaas borrowed money from the Stanford

Credit Union to release the disc independently
and distributes it to record stores here and in
Pueblo, Colo., his hometown. Modest and some
what shy, he speaks of his music as if it is a lan
guage, punctuating his statements with dis
claimers warning that his verbal descriptions
sound "corny."
"A lot of people would disagree that you can
express what you are thinking with just music
and no lyrics," he says.
Halaas says he spends the majority of his time
composing.
"I'm really working on my writing skills," he
says. "Right now I'm at an expression stage. I am
working very hard to be able to express what I
want to."
Composing music, he says, is a medium for
him to work through his emotions.
"If I'm feeling a certain way, I'll just improve
until I find something that fits the mood," he
says. "Sometimes I'll sit down and improv on one
theme for two hours.
"I suppose the best things I've ever played no
one will ever hear, including me."
Asked why he doesn't record these sessions so
he can save these private moments, Halaas says,
"I'd go through an awful lot of tape."
Halaas says he molds "snapshots" of improvi
sations into songs.
"I don't disguise the emotions I feel by making
them sound commercial," he says."The whole
theme about 'No Disguises' is about being true to
what you feel."
Neurobiology is as true to Halaas as music.
"I like to keep diversity. I'm not doing neuro
biology in case I fail at music," he says.
Halaas will be doing brain surgery on rats this
summer as part of his research.
Halaas says he is not worried this diversity
may spread him too thin. He says he can't spend
sue hours a day doing scales and practicing with
other people's music. "There are too many other
things I'm wholeheartedly interested in,"he says.
But in the best of all worlds, Halaas says,"I
would like to perform for a living."
