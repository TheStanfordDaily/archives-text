# Time for a little daytime drama
## SCREEN 
### 
'Soapdish," starring Robert
Downey, Jr., Sally Field,
Whoopi Goldberg, Kevin Kline,
Cathy Moriarty and Elisabeth
Shue.
Sally Field. Kevin Kline. Whoopi
Goldberg. Robert Downey, Jr. Cathy
Moriarty. Elisabeth Shue. A cameo
performance by Carrie Fisher.
OK, so I didn't exactly know who
Cathy Moriarty and Elisabeth Shue
were, but nonetheless it was a star
studded cast.
I figured that with this much talent,
the movie was destined to as bad as the
actors and actresses were good.
In other words, I expected
"Soapdish" to be terrible and end up at
Flicks next fall.
Instead, "Soapdish" was a fantastic
comedy that kept me interested — and
laughing — throughout the entire
movie.
As a screenplay, "Soapdish" oper
ates on many levels.
First, it is the story of a motley
group of people who produce and
"act" in a soap opera called "The Sun
Also Sets."
Second, it is the story of the soap
opera itself, complete with Nurse Nan,
husbands named Bolt and comments

such as "I have been to Europe; I have
seen European things."
Third, it is the story of each of the
actors' and actresses' personal lives and
their web of connections, mischevious
doings and plot twists.
And last, "Soapdish" is a critique of
itself, intelligently satirizing soap
operas.
"Soapdish" was produced by Aaron
Spelling, the man who brought you
"The Love Boat," as well as "Dynasty"
and almost every other prime-time
soap opera.
It is obvious that Spelling used per
sonal experiences in making this film.
"Soapdish" is focused around Field,
who portrays Celeste Talbert, an
actress who plays "Maggie" on th'.
aforementioned soap opera. Maggie is
a middle-aged woman beset by
calamity after calamity in typical soap
opera melodrama.
The movie opens with Celeste win
ning the Daytime Television Award for
best actress and being hailed as "Amer
ica's Sweetheart" by loyal fans in New
Jersey.
Montana (played by Moriarty) is an
actress who plays Nurse Nan on "The
Sun Also Sets" and is intensely jealous
of Celeste's celebrity status. Montana
plots with the show's producer, David
Barnes (Downey, Jr.), to get Maggie off
of the show.
Downey, Jr. has finally found a role
suited for him as the slimy plastic go
between who is constantly kissing up
to the television executives upstairs.

He brings Jeffrey Anderson (played by
Kline), to the set to rattle Maggie into
leaving.
Anderson is Celeste's ex-lover
whom she had removed from the show
20 years ago.
And if that weren't complicated
enough, it gets worse when Celeste's
niece, Laurie (Shue), arrives on the set,
cast as a mute homeless person (that
way they can pay her less) in the
Caribbean, who is supposed to attack
Maggie.
Whew!
With plot twists and convolutions
such as switching babies, illegitimate

children, lies, assorted treachery, sex
and references to Terra Del Fuego, the
lives led by the actors and actresses
outstrip the melodrama of "The Sun
Also Sets" and supply "Entertainment
Tonight" and all the tabloids with
enough material to keep in business
forever.
Whether you scorn the soaps or
can't do without your daily dose of
daytime drama, you should go to see
"Soapdish"; it will make you laugh as it
pokes intelligent fun at the world of
soap operas.
