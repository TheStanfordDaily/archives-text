# Centennial Celebration will take to the stage
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Staff writer 
During fall quarter there has always
been one event designed for laughing
at the weenies: Gaieties. Sometimes
there's a second event for laughing at
the weenies as well: Big Game.
Next fall, there will be a third event
centered around weenie-deprecatory
laughter: Gaieties. Again.
Two Gaieties?
Yep. By fall, the Centennial Com
mittee will have put together a special
edition Gaieties with memorable
scenes dating as far back as 1935.
"It will have Dirk McWeenie and all
the other horrible Cal characters we've
created in the past, but it's not going to
be one of those basic Cal-sucks Gai
eties," swore Allen Blue, student enter
tainment coordinator for the Centen
nial Celebration. "It's going to be the
best of Gaieties.
"No doubt it will have one of those
horribly contrived, all-too-complex
Gaieties plots," Blue continued,
explaining that the show will include
two or three scenes written for the cen
tennial edition to give the performance
some sort of a storyline.
Blue has been using Ram's Head's
"woefully lacking" database in order to
contact Ram's Head alumni to ask for
recommendations of outstanding
scenes. According to Blue, alumni have
been sending in Gaieties scripts and
music by the truckload.
And these truckloads — "the scenes
that people remember after they have
left Stanford" — are going to become
part of a theatrical review of Stanford

history.
Blue said he hopes and expects that
some Ram's Head alumni will return
to campus to play their former roles in
the fall. There will be plenty of time for
everyone to catch these command per
formances: Gaieties will be shown five
times.
But Gaieties isn't the only special
performance scheduled for the Cen
tennial; there are many more.
For example, the celebratory week
end will include the "a capella concert
to end all a capella concerts," at which
all six campus a capella groups will
perform.
The Asian-American Theater Pro
ject will be performing "Yankee Dawg,
You Die," a well-known play about the
images of Asian-Americans in Ameri
can film, and the Music Department is
sponsoring several events, including
performances by the Stanford String
Quartet, the Chamber Chorale and the
Stanford Chamber Orchestra.
According to Blue, the perfor
mances that weekend will be "an
opportunity to communicate what's
going on arts-wise at Stanford and an
opportunity for groups to get to know
the alumni pool.
"It will also be a respite from the
constant Stanford rah-rah of the week
end," he added.
All performances, except for the
special Gaieties, will be accessible to
students with the purchase of a per
forming arts pass.

Auditions for the Centennial Gaieties
will be held tonight in Memorial Audi
torium at 6, 8 and 10.
