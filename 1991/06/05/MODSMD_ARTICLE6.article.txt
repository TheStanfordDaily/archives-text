# New $60 million SLAC detector scheduled to be ready by fall
## 
### Jeff Brock Senior staff writer 
The new Stanford Large Detector — a 4,000 ton,
four-story-tall device at the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center — is revving up to study one of the
smallest particles imaginable: the Z.
The $60 million detector, ten years in the making,
is currently being tested and is scheduled to begin its
research into the subatomic world in the fall.
SLAC physicist Marty Breidenbach heads a group
of 150 scientists and 50 engineers and technicians
who will measure the properties of Z particles to test
the validity of the "Standard Model" of physics.
According to the theory, matter and anti-matter
are divided into families of particles, and some mat
ter is composed of particles called quarks. SLAC has
been testing and making additions to the model since
the late 19605.
The detector surrounds the part of the Stanford
Linear Collider where the particles smash into each
other. The collider is shaped like a two-mile-long ten
nis racket.
A pulsed stream of electrons (matter) and
positrons (anti-matter) speed together at nearly the
speed of light down the long, straight "handle" and
are separated by semi-circular arcs that meet at the
top.
At this point, the particles collide and create an
explosion of new exotic particles, simulating condi
tions that existed a fraction of a second after the Rig
Bang, which scientists believe created the universe.
The remnants of the beams pass through each
other, continue to the opposite sides and are dumped

one-quarter of the way back down the handle.
The Z part icle was first detected at SLAC by older
detectors and at a collider in Switzerland in spring
1989. Z particles supposedly carry the weak nuclear
force, one of what scientists consider the four
fundamental forces of nature.
SLAC physicists need to study many Z particles to
obtain useful research information, researchers said.
Though their collider has been a "huge success" as a
prototype — it is the only linear collider in the world
— Breidenbach said it is "not up to our hopes" as a
physics research machine because it has not been
producing enough Z particles.
However, SLAC physicists hope the Stanford col
lider can produce enough Z's to outdo its European
competitor. The circular collider in Switzerland has
been producing more Z's than the Stanford collider,
and its laboratory boasts four detectors of compara
ble size and purpose.
But Breidenbach said the Stanford collider's lin
ear design often allows it to run at the same energy
levels as the Swiss collider but at a much lower cost.
The European lab is attempting to create one mil
lion Z's during the next three to five years. Breiden
bach said he thinks SLAC could get an accurate mea
sure of the weak nuclear force with the new Large
Detector using only 10,000 Z's — in the same
amount of time as the Swiss collider — by employing
a special property of the Stanford beams.
But SLAC physicists don't want to stop at 10,000.
"We'd like a rate of 50,000 Z's per year by a year
from now," said Breidenbach.

Welder Jess Gutierrez works on part of the $60 million Stanford Large Detector. Research using the
apparatus Is slated to start in the fall and will investigate qualities of the minute Z particle.
Physicist Rill Ash, who has
been with SI.AC since 1972, said
SLAC physicists are conducting
three groups of tests on the Large
Detector. One test, completed last
Friday, demonstrated that the
radiation shielding is sufficient.
The second test, finished yes
terday, involved adjusting and

focusing the beam to travel
through the detector and collide
properly in the "interaction
region," where the detector sur
rounds the collider. "The results
are very encouraging," said Ash,
who headed the group that built
the superconducting final focus
for the device.
In the third test, physicists will
determine how much low back
ground visual "noise" exists.
Ash said if the detector works
satisfactorily, the research on Z

particles could be completed in
five to seven years.
The detector "combines a new
generation in particle detectors
with a new generation of accelera
tors," Breidenbach wrote in
SLAC's Fall/Winter 1990 newslet
ter.
Many complex layers surround
the collider tube, and as the parti
cles produced from the collision
pass through them, detailed
information is registered. For

example, a beer-can-sized device
called the vertex detector deter
mines the origin of every particle.
Designing the software that
interprets the shower of particles
was a large task. "For every hour
spent by physicists and engineers
designing, building and testing
the pieces of the detector and elec
tronics, another hour goes into
developing the software to deal
with the information," Breiden
bach wrote.

Welder Jess Gutierrez works on part of the $60 million Stanford Large Detector. Research using the
apparatus Is slated to start in the fall and will investigate qualities of the minute Z particle.
Physicist Rill Ash, who has
been with SI.AC since 1972, said
SLAC physicists are conducting
three groups of tests on the Large
Detector. One test, completed last
Friday, demonstrated that the
radiation shielding is sufficient.
The second test, finished yes
terday, involved adjusting and

focusing the beam to travel
through the detector and collide
properly in the "interaction
region," where the detector sur
rounds the collider. "The results
are very encouraging," said Ash,
who headed the group that built
the superconducting final focus
for the device.
In the third test, physicists will
determine how much low back
ground visual "noise" exists.
Ash said if the detector works
satisfactorily, the research on Z

particles could be completed in
five to seven years.
The detector "combines a new
generation in particle detectors
with a new generation of accelera
tors," Breidenbach wrote in
SLAC's Fall/Winter 1990 newslet
ter.
Many complex layers surround
the collider tube, and as the parti
cles produced from the collision
pass through them, detailed
information is registered. For

example, a beer-can-sized device
called the vertex detector deter
mines the origin of every particle.
Designing the software that
interprets the shower of particles
was a large task. "For every hour
spent by physicists and engineers
designing, building and testing
the pieces of the detector and elec
tronics, another hour goes into
developing the software to deal
with the information," Breiden
bach wrote.
