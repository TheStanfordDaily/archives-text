Chilly Scenes of Winter
Ann Beattie
Vintage Contemporaries, 280 pages, $9.95
Reviewed by Elizabeth Schirmer
Charles' best friend Sam, the Phi Beta
Kappa college graduate, can't keep his job as a
suit salesman. What's worse, Sam's dog just
died — and he really misses that dog. Sam is
mildly depressed and decides to move in with
a friend — Charles.
Charles' ex-lover Pamela can't decide
whether or not she's a lesbian, and she keeps
appearing on his doorstep. One time, flat
broke, she calls Charles in the middle of the
night — during a blizzard — because she's
stranded at some not-too-nearby service stop
on the turnpike. Her lesbian lover, who drove
her to California, had left her by crawling out
of the bathroom window in a San Francisco
bar.
Charles' ex-girlfriend, Laura, with whom
he is completely and hopelessly in love (nearly
every rambling paragraph detailing Charles'
random thoughts contains her name), just left
her husband and moved into an apartment —
without so much as calling Charles.
Things are not going particularly well for
Charles, the narrator of Ann Beattie's novel,
"Chilly Scenes of Winter." His personal life is a
mess, his job in a government office is any
thing but exciting and the '60s are definitely
over. "Janis Joplin is dead," he keeps remem
bering, whenever he hears one of her songs on
the radio, and so are a lot of other people

whose songs he recognizes.
Despite what may seem a rather depressing
plot, "Chilly Scenes" is a pleasure to read.
Beattie does a brilliant job of balancing the
intimacy of a first-person narrative with per
spective and humor as Charles' life reaches a
bleak mid-winter and then begins, little by lit
tle, to thaw.
Beattie has an uncanny knack for captur
ing the exact tone of Charles' thoughts, and
his half-fatalistic, half-sarcastic ramblings
keep us constantly entertained.
. He would run around corners in Bermuda
and collide with her. They would fish, pull
starfish out of the water. ... They would fly to
Paris and eat at the McDonald's because it was
tres amusant... and for a while they would be
as happy as Scott and Zelda. Zelda died in the
bin, and Scott drank himself to death They
were assholes. The fun ended with a bang. He
would be eaten by a shark, and Laura would get
an inoperable melanoma. Bermuda. It probably
rains all the time in Bermuda."
In passages like this one, as in the famil
iarly absurd situations that Charles frequently
finds himself in, his somewhat morbid but
vital sense of humor shines through.
Charles never does make it to the McDon
ald's in Paris, but things aren't all bad. Sam
breaks down and gets a new dog (a really ugly
one, with insomnia no less, but what the
heck).
And Rod Stewart, despite rumors to the
contrary, is still alive and kicking.
