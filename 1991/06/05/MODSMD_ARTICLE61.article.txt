Covering events through the end of 1990,
"Foreign Policies of the Soviet Union" is a
new and timely work that documents and
interprets the recent history of Soviet foreign
policy, emphasizing the dramatic evolution
that has taken place under perestroika.
I use the term evolution, rather than revo
lution, advisedly. The author, Hoover Senior
Fellow Richard Staar, makes clear from the
start the central tenet of his position: that
Soviet global objectives have in fact not
changed fundamentally under Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev.
While recognizing the undeniable and
often spectacular changes of the last few
years, Staar stresses that the "new political
thinking" in international affairs does not
represent a real break with past behavior and
attitudes. As long as the Soviet Union's goal
continues to be "to restore communism's

dwindling credibility rather than to destroy
it," Soviet foreign policy will remain omi
nously tied to its past.

The vast scope of the book is arranged
into three sections: "Foundations," which
outlines the general Soviet world view,
including particularly interesting chapters on
the process of policy formulation and imple
mentation; "Instrumentalities," which details
the roles of propaganda, intelligence activity,

military strategy and foreign trade; and
"Regional Policies," including those toward
Europe, China, the United States and the
Third World.
The short, specific subchapters are
crammed with information — taken largely
from Soviet sources — producing a work
short on theoretical analysis, but long on facts
and figures. The extensive documentation
and efficient organization of the material
makes "Foreign Policies" a valuable research
tool for students of Soviet affairs.
It is not just a reference work, however.
The information presented is not exhaustive,
but is carefiilly selected and interpreted by the
author. Thus, the focus tends toward the his
torical continuity of Soviet behavior — viola
tions of treaties, disinformation campaigns,
involvement in regional conflicts — rather
than on radical positive changes in their
international conduct.
The result is an effective scholarly presen
tation of skeptical conservative thought on
the true extent of perestroika and its meaning
for the international community.
