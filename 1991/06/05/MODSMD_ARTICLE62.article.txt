# Graffiti at Stanford: just another brick in the wall?
## 
### Julie Cantor Staff writer 
It's all over campus.
"Everywhere you turn you'll find it.
It's everywhere that you go."
Clearly, graffiti is vogue. So there,
Madonna.
For centuries, people have scrawled
messages and pictures on walls as a
form of self-expression. Neanderthals
etched giraffes in caves; Egyptians
branded tombs with secret hiero
glyphic messages. And beginning with
his appearance in a bomb factory dur
ing World War 11, Kilroy was every
where.
But Stanford graffiti is different.
And it's all over the place; drawing
boards range from bathroom stalls in
Meyer Library to the Medical School
construction site. Mediums include
pencils, pens, paint brushes and pock
etknives. And topics discussed are
diverse as well: from love poems to
hate messages, from defiant political
stances to absolute apathy.
Perhaps people are searching for
immortality, seeking to permanently
leave their mark on an ever-changing
world through graffiti. But that's IJnd
of philosophical; it sounds like a Cul
tures, Ideas and Values theme and it
probably bears little resemblance to
reality.
Have you missed this trend? Are
you too blind to see the writing on the

wall? Well, even a quick glance at the
graffiti on campus can be an eye
opening experience.
Carefully painted on a decrepit
wood fence near the Chemistry Build
ing, the graffiti reads, "Hanna is my
opium."
This could be a new rehabilitation
program: the "Hanna" approach. Or
just say, "Hanna." What's her secret?
Lengthy commentaries and off
hand remarks are violently scribbled
in the winding East Stacks of Green
Library, a place too many students call
"home." Fraternities are criticized,
President Bush is praised and the "best
pizza in Palo Alto" is identified in
these oft-used cubicles.
Just upstairs in Green, a fabulous
study in graffiti and one of the most
defaced desks on campus can be
viewed: Go to the second floor, turn
left and casually stroll down to those
four desks with the view of the outside
world; the ones near the huge window.
Look carefully; you can't miss it.
A huge, crusty, ancient wad of
already-been-chewed gum.
The gum itself is remarkably dis
gusting, but the comments surround
ing it are hilarious. Over 30 people
have put in their two cents about this
algae-like Hubba-Bubba.
In the immortalized words of one
observant studier, "Very gross."
This seemingly innocent comment
served as the catalyst for a veritable

graffiti orgy; perhaps everyone who
uses this desk responds. These pithy
answers to the previous comment
build on the theme of "very ..."
A brief sample: "Very improper,"
gives way to "Very prudish," which
leads to "Very cynical." The writing
winds around to "Very Keri," back to
"Very plagiaristic" and down to "Very
stupid."
A very interesting way to procrasti
nate.
But graffiti is not limited to study
time alone; the desks of popular lec

ture halls are frequently covered in
messages — some ephemeral, written
lightly, in passing — others etched
deeply in the wood for a more lasting,
even immortal effect.
One such permanent engraving is
carved on the enormous expanse of
desk in Room 161J — the big lecture
hall on the first floor of Building 160
(Political Science Building). In big,
black, bold letters, the infamous mes
sage reads "CAMDOG."
Rumor has it that it once said
"SCAMDOG," but no one can be quite

sure. And no one really knows what
that means, either.
The most telling comments, how
ever, are far less trivial, much more
personal and not quite as easily acces
sible. Particularly if you're male.
Because some of the most revealing
graffiti on campus is scrawled in the
women's bathrooms in Meyer Library.
The walls speak. Really.
Maybe it's the privacy; maybe peo
ple just have more time to think about
what they want to say.
Whatever the reason, the graffiti on
these stalls should be preserved for
posterity. Someone should take a pic
ture of it or cut out a piece of the wall
and nestle it comfortably into the time
capsule.
During the Gulf war, the messages
were entirely preoccupied with the cri
sis. An enormous, silent and com
pletely serious debate raged on those
aluminum walls.
Now, the talk has changed.
For example: middle stall, third
floor, "I have a problem. I stuff myself
with food, and then I go and throw it
up. I hate myself for this. I wish I could
stop. Does anyone else have this prob
lem?"
More than 20 people have
responded to this woman's question.
They identify with her and tell her
about their own struggles with eating
disorders; many women urge her to
get help.

One woman had helpful advice,
but was unwilling to deface property.
She wrote her comments on a Post-it
note and taped it on the door.
Revisiting that stall, this bulimic
woman will find answers. She is not
alone.
Above her, another woman with a
terrible case of acne describes her utter
unhappiness and faltering self-esteem.
This graffiti, too, evokes dozens of car
ing and compassionate responses. One
woman tells her to get counseling.
Another recommends the potent drug
Acutane.
Why are people turning to the
inanimate walls — not for destructive
purposes — but rather, for advice?
Why do they solicit help from
strangers? Is there nowhere else to turn
for solace?
Think about it.
Graffiti has become a pulse on soci
ety.
At Brown University, women began
writing the names of alleged student
rapists on the bathroom walls. Their
goal? To warn other women about
dangerous situations and dangerous
men when they felt the justice system
kept its own hands cuffed.
Maybe the key to understanding
what's really going on campus is not,
after all, in the newspaper or on the
bulletin boards, but rather scrawled on
the bathroom walls, anonymous and
uncensored.

Have you missed this trend? Are

This could be a new rehabilitation

Just upstairs in Green, a fabulous
study in graffiti and one of the most
defaced desks on campus can be
viewed: Go to the second floor, turn

Look carefully; you can't miss it.
A huge, crusty, ancient wad of
already-been-chewed gum.
The gum itself is remarkably dis

have put in their two cents about this
algae-like Hubba-Bubba.
In the immortalized words of one

desk in Room 161J — the big lecture

"SCAMDOG," but no one can be quite

Because some of the most revealing
graffiti on campus is scrawled in the

The walls speak. Really.
Maybe it's the privacy; maybe peo

For example: middle stall, third

More than 20 people have
responded to this woman's question.
They identify with her and tell her
about their own struggles with eating

get help.

One woman had helpful advice,

Revisiting that stall, this bulimic

Why are people turning to the

At Brown University, women began

what's really going on campus is not,
after all, in the newspaper or on the
bulletin boards, but rather scrawled on

It's all over campus.
"Everywhere you turn you'll find it.
It's everywhere that you go."
Clearly, graffiti is vogue. So there,
Madonna.
For centuries, people have scrawled
messages and pictures on walls as a
form of self-expression. Neanderthals
etched giraffes in caves; Egyptians
branded tombs with secret hiero
glyphic messages. And beginning with
his appearance in a bomb factory dur
ing World War 11, Kilroy was every
where.
But Stanford graffiti is different.
And it's all over the place; drawing
boards range from bathroom stalls in
Meyer Library to the Medical School
construction site. Mediums include
pencils, pens, paint brushes and pock
etknives. And topics discussed are
diverse as well: from love poems to
hate messages, from defiant political
stances to absolute apathy.
Perhaps people are searching for
immortality, seeking to permanently
leave their mark on an ever-changing
world through graffiti. But that's IJnd
of philosophical; it sounds like a Cul
tures, Ideas and Values theme and it
probably bears little resemblance to
reality.
