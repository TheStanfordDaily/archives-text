Alcohol policy
The University announced a
new alcohol and drug policy
explicitly prohibiting the unlawful
use or possession of alcohol or
drugs on campus by students, fac
ulty and staff.
The policy also specified that
violations could result in penalties
up to and including expulsion
under the Fundamental Standard
for students or loss of employ
ment for faculty and staff.
Students had barely settled
into their residences and started
classes when University officials
announced in late September that
the federal government was
requiring universities to expressly
prohibit illegal alcohol and other
drug use on campus or face termi
nation of federal funds.
Given that Stanford receives
hundreds of millions of research
dollars from the government,
administrators had little choice
but to comply with the Drug Free
Schools and Communities Act.
They rewrote Stanford's previous
alcohol policy, which stressed indi
vidual responsibility for decisions
about drinking.
But the change appeared to
have little immediate effect on
campus life.
The Daily reported Nov. 30 that
the University's new alcohol and
drug policy would do little to
change drinking behavior on cam
pus, in the opinion of resident
assistants and students, despite
weeks of fierce debate over the
issue.
Administrators actively sought
the opinions of students, faculty
and residence staff members as to
how to implement the new policy.
At a series of meetings with
administrators, many people sim
ply voiced their outrage.
Students argued that without
the opportunity to drink in the
supervised environment of the
dorms, underage students would
be encouraged to drink behind
closed doors or at an off-campus
location, both of which would lead
to more dangerous situations.
Resident assistants and resi
dent fellows said they would
refuse to police the dorms for

stashed alcohol or report policy
violators because that would con
flict with their roles as educators
and counselors.
University officials assured
RAs that they would not be
expected to patrol their dorms,
but added that under the new pol
icy, using dorm funds to purchase
alcohol for underage students
would be a direct violation.
"In my opinion, nothing has
changed," declared one Trancos
RA, who added that the policy
"means nothing."
An RA in Donner echoed that
view, saying he believed "the
drinking is not going to change in
any amount."
One freshman said most people
"aren't taking [the policy] that
seriously" and called it little more
than "an annoyance."

Domestic partners
Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing privileges
to gay and lesbian students as the
result of a controversial decision
Oct. 9.
The change in policy, announc
ed by acting Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson, extended
housing, facilities and health-care
benefits to the domestic partners
of gay and lesbian students, as
well as to committed partners of
heterosexual students.
Under the new policy, students
who say they are in an "estab
lished long-term domestic part
nership" may live in one-bedroom
campus apartments and purchase
health care through Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. Previously,
gay and lesbian students had to
petition to gain the same privi
leges accorded married students.
In addition, domestic partners
may obtain a "courtesy card" from
the Registrar's Office, allowing
them access to libraries, recre
ational facilities and some Univer
sity events.
The decision was considered a
major victory by members of the
gay, lesbian and bisexual commu
nity, but was criticized by some
students and alumni on religious

and ethical grounds.
Partly in response to such con
cerns, the Board of Trustees
reviewed the policy several
months after its implementation
and let it stand.
A more recent effort to extend
faculty spousal benefits to gay
couples is still hanging in the bal
ance. The proposal, which would
carry a much higher price tag
than the student policy, was
tabled by the Faculty Senate until
fall.

New requirements
A divided Faculty Senate voted
to revamp the distribution
requirements that undergradu
ates must complete in order to
graduate, placing a greater
emphasis on the study of race,
religion and gender.
Proponents hailed the changes
as necessary to prepare a diverse
student body for living in an
increasingly global society. But
several faculty voiced concerns
that the increased emphasis on
the study of race and gender
would undercut the require
ments' goal of exposing students
to a wide variety of academic disci
plines. Some complained that the
revisions were a concession to the
"politically correct."
Next year's entering freshman
will face 11 requirements, one
more than currently in place.
Among the requirements they will
have to satisfy before leaving
Stanford are:
• One course in "American Cul
tures" that critically examines
race or religion in the United
States,
• One course in gender studies,
which will be an "asterisked"
requirement like the current non-
Western requirement; and
• One course in "Social and
Behavioral Sciences," which com
bines two current requirements.
In addition, the senate voted to
make "World Cultures" a full
fledged requirement, replacing its
current "asterisked" status.
"Asterisked" requirements are
fulfilled by taking courses that
meet other distribution require

ments but also are denoted by an
asterisk in the Time Schedule.
The remaining requirements
remained unaltered by the senate.

'Dean Jean' resigns
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter announced her
resignation from her highly visi
ble, influential post. Her
announcement came as a com
plete surprise to the campus, even
to her colleagues in the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions.
Fetter, who earned the affec
tionate nickname "Dean Jean"
soon after assuming her position
seven years ago, made her mark
on the campus by admitting top
scholars, artists and athletes in
the most racially diverse classes
the University has ever seen.
She also garnered attention by
participating in various dorm pro
grams as well as appearing annu
ally in Big Game Gaieties.
Fetter said she plans to devote
the next year to writing about her
experiences and serving as a lec
turer in the School of Education.
But the Admissions Office will
continue, "un-Fettered," as a
replacement for 'Dean Jean' will
be announced at Commencement.

Persian Gulf war
When news of the start of the
Persian Gulf war hit Stanford,
students reacted with with both

passion and inattention.
Hundreds of students and com
munity members took part in a
teach-in, dozens of dormitories
held programs on the still
entrenched conflicts in the Middle
East, and several "die-ins" sought
attention in White Plaza.
Many issues were raised, from
whether women should engage in
combat to whether people should
feel guilty studying for midterms
and not thinking about the impli
cations and effects of war.
Announcements of the initia
tion of war came on a warm Jan
uary afternoon. Some students
went to Palo Alto or San Francisco
to protest U.S. actions. Others ate
dinner with their academic advis
ers, as planned, and spoke about
their feelings on the first major
U.S. war they were old enough to
understand.
Some students said they
watched more television during
the war than they had in all of the
rest of their time at Stanford. And
some professors wondered out
loud why students sat watching
television rather than protesting.
Protest, though, was not the
way most students sought to com
municate and convince. The cam
pus heeded University President
Donald Kennedy's prewar call for
a civil, respectful debate. The pri
mary war-related activity on cam
pus during the days of conflict was
personal conversation.

Sexual assault report
The Sexual Assault Task Force
released its long-awaited report,
recommending direct action on

the part of the University to com
bat rape and other sexual assault
on campus.
But many students and admin
istrators expressed concern that
Stanford would have trouble find
ing the money to pay for the task
force's recommendations.
Among the recommendations
were a "highly visible" coordina
tor of sexual assault response ser
vices, a less stringent standard of
proof for Fundamental Standard
cases and developing a formal,
written policy stating that Stan
ford will not tolerate sexual mis
conduct.
Soon after, the University
appointed several committees to
examine ways of achieving the
task force goals.
But months later, several of the
proposals were still unimple
mented, and the University, facing
a huge budget deficit, had no defi
nite plan to hire a new sexual
assault response coordinator.
Frustrated with the Univer
sity's slow response to the task
force recommendations, the
ASSU Senate voted in May to allo
cate more than $45,000 for sexual
assault prevention and education
projects.
The ASSU will pay for a tempo
rary coordinator of sexual assault
programs, an office for sexual
assault prevention and a rape pre
vention workshop during Orienta
tion.
The one-year allocation comes
from the ASSU's annual and spe
cial discretionary reserves. Uni
versity officials have promised to
form "a partnership" with the
ASSU in combating sexual
assault, but as the school year
ended it was still unclear whether
the University would be paying
for the sexual assault prevention
programs when the ASSU's allo
cation ends.

Indirect-cost hearing
University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beating
before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell, the
powerful and feared Michigan
Democrat.
The event marked the climax of
the media hoopla that had sur
rounded the controversy over how
Stanford charges the government
for the indirect costs of federally
sponsored research projects.
Dingell and other subcommit
tee members dwelled on the sen
sational items that government
auditors had discovered in the
University's past cost claims —
depreciation on the 72-foot yacht
Victoria, flowers and antique fur
niture in Kennedy's residence —
and a host of new "abuses,"
including administrative expenses
associated with the "elite" Stan
ford Shopping Center and the cost
of enlarging Kennedy's bed.
"What we will hear today is a
story of taxpayer dollars going to
bloated overhead rather than to
scientific research," Dingell told
the more than 200 spectators and
reporters packed in the hearing
room. "It is a story of excess and
arrogance, compounded by lax
governmental oversight."
The grueling seven-hour hear
ing featured testimony from 10
federal officials and five Stanford
representatives. But scathing lec-
