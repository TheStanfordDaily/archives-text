Urinary Tract
Infection Study
For Women
Did you know that one out of ten
women get urinary tract infections each
year? The common signs of a UTI are a
burning, painful feeling while urinating;
and the feeling that you "have to go' all
the time but only urinate a little amount. If
you experience these symptoms, you
might be eligible to participate in a
research drug study. This study is currently
underway in Redwood City under Dr.
Hector Medina's supervision.
Participants will be treated with study
medication for 7 days and will be
evaluated for 6 weeks. All study
medication and medical care will be free
of charge. In addition, participants will
receive $50 for completing the study.
Please give us a call with questions
about your UTI. Ask for Chrysbe at (415)
