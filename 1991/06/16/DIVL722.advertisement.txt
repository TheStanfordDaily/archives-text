Your Typical Group of Guys

We offer:

• An opportunity to meet and network with other single professionals in the
Bay Area.
• 2 to 3 events per month, including — dance parties with live music and/or
DJ's, theatre, symphony, ballet, tenrus tournaments, backpacking trips to
Yosemite, and Stanford football games.
