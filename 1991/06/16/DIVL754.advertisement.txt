Congratulations..You finally made it as a
Stanford alumni. You've done many great
things and I know that there will be many
more. I also believe that all the late night
(and sometimes over-night) works in the
vapor-phase lab during the past years will
be a great experience for the future.
I'm very proud of you and you're so
precious to me.
