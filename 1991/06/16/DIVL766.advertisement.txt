Congratulations on your first major achievement. We have given you mate
rial support for the past four years, now we offer a little spiritual advice:
Regard every problem as an opportunity; every challenge your partner;
every failure a stepping stone; and every success a proud, yet humble ex
perience.
Ask:
(1) What is my VISION of my future?
(2) What are my PLANS to realize this vision?
(3) What am I DOING to materialize these plans?
Keep asking, and remember ENTHUSIASM is the fuel for action!
Love, Mom & Dad
from Cupertino, CA
CONGRATULATIONS!

can't wait until you're "happy home again"!
