### 
SEPTEMBER
• Two federal agencies began
investigations to determine if
Stanford was overbilling the gov
ernment for overhead costs of fed
erally sponsored research. "I do
not expect a discovery of any
wrongdoing on our part," Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
told The Daily.
OCTOBER
• In response to the govern
ment's recently passed Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act,
the University announced a new
alcohol and drug policy explicitly
prohibiting the unlawful use of
alcohol and drugs on campus by
students, faculty and staff.
• Stanford became one of the
first universities in the nation to
extend married housing priviliges
to gay and lesbian students. The
change in policy extended hous
ing, facilities and health-care ben
efits to the domestic partners of
gay and lesbian students, as well
as to committed partners of het
erosexual students.
NOVEMBER
• A divided Faculty Senate
voted to revamp the distribution
requirements that undergradu
ates must complete in order to
graduate, placing a greater
emphasis on the study of race,
religion and gender.
DECEMBER
• The Interfraternity Council

voted overwhelmingly to require
all campus fraternities to hold an
alcohol-free Rush spring quarter,
a move that the IFC president
described as a "major policy
change." The switch to a dry Rush
was intended to "send a strong
message" that the OFC is com
mitted to "self-regulation,"
according to Jorgensen.
JANUARY
• After seven years as dean of
undergraduate admissions, Jean
Fetter, better known to campus as
Dean Jean, announced resigna
tion from her influential post. Her
announcement came as a surprise
to the campus, even to her col
leagues in the Office of Under
graduat Admissions.
• Students reacted with both
passion and inattention to the
news that the United States had
declared war in the Persian Gulf.
FEBRUARY
• The Sexual Assualt Task
Force released its long-awaited
report, recommending direct
action on the part of the Univer
sity to combat rape and other sex
ual assault on campus. Among the
recommendations were a call for a
coordinator of sexual assault
response services and a less strin
gent standard of proof for Funda
mental Standard cases.
MARCH
• University President Donald
Kennedy and Stanford's indirect
cost practices took a heavy beat
ing before the House Subcommit

tee on Oversight and Investiga
tions, chaired by Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. The event marked
the climax of the media hoopla
that had surrounded the contro
versy over how Stanford chargs
the government for the indirect
costs of federally sponsored pro
jects.
APRIL
• The Office of Naval Research
delivered a punishing blow to the
University, terminating close to
100 accounting agreements and
slashing Stanford's indirect-cost
rate from 78 percent to 55.5 per
cent. The actions were taken by
the Navy after its negotiations
with the University broke down
without a settlement.
MAY
• The Student's First slate
defeated the People's Platform
slate, making sophomores Beth
Morgan and Benny Sandoval,
junior John Louie and graduate
student John Overdeck the Coun
cil of Presidents for next year.
Like past elections, this one
became embroiled in controversy
when MEChA, after being
defeated in the general election,
convinced the ASSU Senate to
place it on the runoff ballot.
• Stuart Reges, a computer sci
ence lecturer, was fired for carry
ing illegal drugs on campus and
buying alcoholic beverages for
underages students. Reges had
written a letter to national drug
czar Bob Martinez admitting he

carried and used drugs to protest
U.S. drug policy. The controversy
surrounding the case was covered
by the national media, and raised
questions on campus regarding
free speech.

Students reacted with both passion and inattention to the news that the United States had declared war
In the Persian Gulf. Hundreds of students took part in a teach-in; dozens of dormitories held programs
on the conflict; and several "die-ins" sought attention in White Plaza.
