# Stanford's third 'earthquake': Toll of indirect-cost battle high
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The first of the seemingly sen
sational headlines appeared in the
local papers in mid-September, a
few weeks before fall-quarter
classes were set to begin.
"$2OO million in Stanford
charges questioned," proclaimed
the San Jose Mercury News in its
Sept. 19 morning edition.
The way The Peninsula Times
Tribune told it a few days later,
the story was even harder to
believe: "Feds may seek $300 mil
lion from Stanford," it thundered
in a bold, black type stretching
across the top of its front page.
If University President Donald
Kennedy took the early media
reports all that seriously, he didn't
let it show. He dismissed the
Times Tribune story as "imagina
tive," even joking at a late-
September meeting of the Faculty
Senate that the headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to
their cardiologists."
The various stories that sur
faced in the Bay Area papers were
based on allegations (it was later
learned) made by Paul Biddle, a
rough-and-tumble, no-holds
barred regulator from the Office
of Naval Research, the federal
agency responsible for overseeing
Stanford's use of government
research funds.
According to Biddle, the Uni
versity had repeatedly over
charged the government for indi
rect costs associated with federal
research conducted at Stanford —

According to Biddle, the University had
repeatedly overcharged the govern
ment for indirect costs associated with
federal research conducted at Stanford.

in essence, Biddle said, Stanford
had made a practice during the
1980s of padding its bills in order
to receive more money from Uncle
Sam than it was entitled to.
While the Navy bureaucracy had
managed to keep a muzzle on Bid
dle for several months, he found an
ardent supporter in Congressman
John Dingell, a powerful, mean and
respected Democrat from Michi
gan. Dingell and his Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations
had perfected the art of exposing
federal waste and abuse, most
notably in the defense contractor
scandals of the mid-'Bos.
In late August — a month
before Biddle's allegations were
leaked to the press — Dingell sent
Kennedy a letter informing him
that his subcommittee would be
looking into rising university
overhead rates. Kennedy was told
that Stanford would be the sub
committee's first "case study."
Biddle and Dingell proved to be
a deadly combination for the Uni
versity. The Navy official's free
wheeling allegations were the
match that ignited the firestorm
of federal scrutiny. Dingell and his
staff provided the fuel.
In the eyes of the media, the

controversy approached "scandal"
status in early December. Federal
auditors discovered that deprecia
tion on the 72-foot yacht Victoria
had been included in Stanford's
indirect-cost billings for several
years.
A beautiful recreational vessel
that had been donated to Stan
ford's Sailing program, the Victo
ria — with its marble counters,
wood-burning stoves and on
board jacuzzi — was for Dingell
and the media the perfect symbol
of all that was corrupt about Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices.
In reality, the yacht and other
sensational audit findings that
dominated press coverage in the
following months — flowers and
antiques in Kennedy's home, a
1987 reception for Kennedy's new
bride and administrative costs of
the Stanford Shopping Center —
had a minuscule impact on Stan
ford's indirect-cost rate.
As the fall and winter months
passed, the controversy over Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices
really became two controversies:
• One over the laundry list of
embarrassing audit findings; and
• The other over the validity of
various formulas Stanford had

been using to charge the govern
ment for the much more costly
but less sexy components of indi
rect-cost recovery — utilities,
building and equipment deprecia
tion and use of Stanford's

libraries by researchers.
The first of the two controver
sies was tailor-made for the
media. The second was much
more esoteric — "stuff for lawyers
and accountants," as one Stanford

researcher put it — and was
largely ignored by the press.
Stanford would lose big on both
counts.
