# Stanford's third 'earthquake': Toll of indirect-cost battle high
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
The first of the seemingly sen
sational headlines appeared in the
local papers in mid-September, a
few weeks before fall-quarter
classes were set to begin.
"$2OO million in Stanford
charges questioned," proclaimed
the San Jose Mercury News in its
Sept. 19 morning edition.
The way The Peninsula Times
Tribune told it a few days later,
the story was even harder to
believe: "Feds may seek $300 mil
lion from Stanford," it thundered
in a bold, black type stretching
across the top of its front page.
If University President Donald
Kennedy took the early media
reports all that seriously, he didn't
let it show. He dismissed the
Times Tribune story as "imagina
tive," even joking at a late-
September meeting of the Faculty
Senate that the headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to
their cardiologists."
The various stories that sur
faced in the Bay Area papers were
based on allegations (it was later
learned) made by Paul Biddle, a
rough-and-tumble, no-holds
barred regulator from the Office
of Naval Research, the federal
agency responsible for overseeing
Stanford's use of government
research funds.
According to Biddle, the Uni
versity had repeatedly over
charged the government for indi
rect costs associated with federal
research conducted at Stanford —

According to Biddle, the University had
repeatedly overcharged the govern
ment for indirect costs associated with
federal research conducted at Stanford.

in essence, Biddle said, Stanford
had made a practice during the
1980s of padding its bills in order
to receive more money from Uncle
Sam than it was entitled to.
While the Navy bureaucracy had
managed to keep a muzzle on Bid
dle for several months, he found an
ardent supporter in Congressman
John Dingell, a powerful, mean and
respected Democrat from Michi
gan. Dingell and his Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations
had perfected the art of exposing
federal waste and abuse, most
notably in the defense contractor
scandals of the mid-'Bos.
In late August — a month
before Biddle's allegations were
leaked to the press — Dingell sent
Kennedy a letter informing him
that his subcommittee would be
looking into rising university
overhead rates. Kennedy was told
that Stanford would be the sub
committee's first "case study."
Biddle and Dingell proved to be
a deadly combination for the Uni
versity. The Navy official's free
wheeling allegations were the
match that ignited the firestorm
of federal scrutiny. Dingell and his
staff provided the fuel.
In the eyes of the media, the

controversy approached "scandal"
status in early December. Federal
auditors discovered that deprecia
tion on the 72-foot yacht Victoria
had been included in Stanford's
indirect-cost billings for several
years.
A beautiful recreational vessel
that had been donated to Stan
ford's Sailing program, the Victo
ria — with its marble counters,
wood-burning stoves and on
board jacuzzi — was for Dingell
and the media the perfect symbol
of all that was corrupt about Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices.
In reality, the yacht and other
sensational audit findings that
dominated press coverage in the
following months — flowers and
antiques in Kennedy's home, a
1987 reception for Kennedy's new
bride and administrative costs of
the Stanford Shopping Center —
had a minuscule impact on Stan
ford's indirect-cost rate.
As the fall and winter months
passed, the controversy over Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices
really became two controversies:
• One over the laundry list of
embarrassing audit findings; and
• The other over the validity of
various formulas Stanford had

been using to charge the govern
ment for the much more costly
but less sexy components of indi
rect-cost recovery — utilities,
building and equipment deprecia
tion and use of Stanford's

libraries by researchers.
The first of the two controver
sies was tailor-made for the
media. The second was much
more esoteric — "stuff for lawyers
and accountants," as one Stanford

researcher put it — and was
largely ignored by the press.
Stanford would lose big on both
counts.

Paul Biddle, a regulator from the Office of Naval Research, the federal agency responsible for over
seeing Stanford's use of government research funds, alleged that the University had repeatedly over
charged the government for indirect costs. In essence, Biddle said Stanford had made a practice dur
ing the 1980s of padding its bills to the government.
The public relations disaster
reached its zenith in mid-March
when Kennedy and other Stan
ford representatives were called to
Washington, D.C., for a hearing in
front of Dingell. Moments after
banging his gavel to open the pro
ceedings, Dingell gave the 200
reporters and spectators packed in
the hearing room a blunt assess
ment of what was to follow:
"What we will hear today is a
story of taxpayer dollars going to
bloated overhead rather than to
scientific research. It is a story of
excess and arrogance, com
pounded by lax governmental
oversight."
Two days later, the ABC News
program "20/20" aired a scathing
segment on Stanford called "Your
tax dollars at work."
The piece aired on the same
broadcast as Barbara Walters'
much-acclaimed interview with
Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf. The
interview with the triumphant
commander of the Allied Forces in
the Gulf netted "20/20" its high
est ratings in five years and Stan
ford its worst publicity in decades.
Scattered calls for Kennedy's
resignation began to surface.
But the most bruising blow
came a month and a half later.
In late April, negotiations

If University President Donald Kennedy took
the early media reports all that seriously, he
didn't let it show. He dismissed the Times Tri
bune story as 'imaginative,' even joking at a
late-September meeting of the Faculty Senate
that the headline was 'enough to send
Trustees off to their cardiologists.'

broke down between the Univer
sity and team sent in by the Navy
to address Biddle's allegations.
The Navy said it no longer
believed the accounting agree
ments, called memoranda of
understanding, that had bound
the two parties in the past were
valid and insisted that the Univer
sity use government "default" for
mulas to determine costs until
new studies could be completed.
The Navy unilaterally imposed
an indirect-cost rate of 55.5 per
cent on Stanford (in contrast with
the 78 percent Stanford had origi
nally proposed for this year). The
rate determines the maximum
amount of indirect-cost reim
bursements Stanford can seek
from federal granting agencies.
The Navy's huge cut in the rate
was retroactive to the beginning
of the academic year.
The financial toll of the Navy's
decision was astounding. Stanford
is now facing a $95 million short-

fall in revenue over the next two
years, due largely to the cancela
tion of the accounting agreements
and their effects. Other factors
unrelated to the controversy over
indirect costs have contributed to
the shortfall as well. Kennedy con
tends it would have been a "bud
get watershed" even without the
indirect-cost "mess."
The tale is by no means over.
The revelations about Stanford
and other schools investigated by
Dingell's staff have set off a flurry
of congressional and executive
activity. Various proposals pend
ing in Congress and the White
House would limit the amount of
indirect-cost recovery universities
nationwide can receive. Given fche
political climate surrounding the
issue, caps on various components
of indirect-cost recovery seem
inevitable.
It is anyone's guess as to where
Stanford's indirect-cost rate will
wind up in a few years. In addition

to regulatory uncertainties, it is
unclear how willing the Navy will
be to accept new Stanford studies
seeking higher levels of reim
bursement.
And the allegations that
sparked the entire controversy —
claims of $200 to $300 million of
overcharges during the 1980s —
have yet to be addressed. Stan
ford, backed by an outside legal
opinion, believes that past agree
ments between the two parties are
legally binding. If the Navy
doesn't like them now, Stanford
officials say, that's too bad.
The Navy takes a slightly dif
ferent view. Any past agreements
entered into by Navy officials that
violated government regulations
may yet be revoked, states a Navy
legal counsel. Biddle views the
decision as a green light to recap
ture federal money channeled to
Stanford during the last 10 years.
Negotiations over the matter
will unfold during the next year or
so. The whole matter could wind
up in the courts.
There have also been allega
tions of possible criminal wrong
doing thrown about by Dingell,
Biddle and federal auditors. The
Naval Investigative Service has
opened a file on the case, but any
evidence of criminal activity has
not come to light. Kennedy has
strongly denounced "loose impli
cations" of criminal wrongdoing
by Stanford officials.

The public relations disaster
reached its zenith in mid-March
when Kennedy and other Stan
ford representatives were called to
Washington, D.C., for a hearing in
front of Dingell. Moments after
banging his gavel to open the pro
ceedings, Dingell gave the 200
reporters and spectators packed in
the hearing room a blunt assess
ment of what was to follow:
"What we will hear today is a
story of taxpayer dollars going to
bloated overhead rather than to
scientific research. It is a story of
excess and arrogance, com
pounded by lax governmental
oversight."
Two days later, the ABC News
program "20/20" aired a scathing
segment on Stanford called "Your
tax dollars at work."
The piece aired on the same
broadcast as Barbara Walters'
much-acclaimed interview with
Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf. The
interview with the triumphant
commander of the Allied Forces in
the Gulf netted "20/20" its high
est ratings in five years and Stan
ford its worst publicity in decades.
Scattered calls for Kennedy's
resignation began to surface.
But the most bruising blow
came a month and a half later.
In late April, negotiations

If University President Donald Kennedy took
the early media reports all that seriously, he
didn't let it show. He dismissed the Times Tri
bune story as 'imaginative,' even joking at a
late-September meeting of the Faculty Senate
that the headline was 'enough to send
Trustees off to their cardiologists.'

broke down between the Univer
sity and team sent in by the Navy
to address Biddle's allegations.
The Navy said it no longer
believed the accounting agree
ments, called memoranda of
understanding, that had bound
the two parties in the past were
valid and insisted that the Univer
sity use government "default" for
mulas to determine costs until
new studies could be completed.
The Navy unilaterally imposed
an indirect-cost rate of 55.5 per
cent on Stanford (in contrast with
the 78 percent Stanford had origi
nally proposed for this year). The
rate determines the maximum
amount of indirect-cost reim
bursements Stanford can seek
from federal granting agencies.
The Navy's huge cut in the rate
was retroactive to the beginning
of the academic year.
The financial toll of the Navy's
decision was astounding. Stanford
is now facing a $95 million short-

fall in revenue over the next two
years, due largely to the cancela
tion of the accounting agreements
and their effects. Other factors
unrelated to the controversy over
indirect costs have contributed to
the shortfall as well. Kennedy con
tends it would have been a "bud
get watershed" even without the
indirect-cost "mess."
The tale is by no means over.
The revelations about Stanford
and other schools investigated by
Dingell's staff have set off a flurry
of congressional and executive
activity. Various proposals pend
ing in Congress and the White
House would limit the amount of
indirect-cost recovery universities
nationwide can receive. Given fche
political climate surrounding the
issue, caps on various components
of indirect-cost recovery seem
inevitable.
It is anyone's guess as to where
Stanford's indirect-cost rate will
wind up in a few years. In addition

to regulatory uncertainties, it is
unclear how willing the Navy will
be to accept new Stanford studies
seeking higher levels of reim
bursement.
And the allegations that
sparked the entire controversy —
claims of $200 to $300 million of
overcharges during the 1980s —
have yet to be addressed. Stan
ford, backed by an outside legal
opinion, believes that past agree
ments between the two parties are
legally binding. If the Navy
doesn't like them now, Stanford
officials say, that's too bad.
The Navy takes a slightly dif
ferent view. Any past agreements
entered into by Navy officials that
violated government regulations
may yet be revoked, states a Navy
legal counsel. Biddle views the
decision as a green light to recap
ture federal money channeled to
Stanford during the last 10 years.
Negotiations over the matter
will unfold during the next year or
so. The whole matter could wind
up in the courts.
There have also been allega
tions of possible criminal wrong
doing thrown about by Dingell,
Biddle and federal auditors. The
Naval Investigative Service has
opened a file on the case, but any
evidence of criminal activity has
not come to light. Kennedy has
strongly denounced "loose impli
cations" of criminal wrongdoing
by Stanford officials.
The first of the seemingly sen
sational headlines appeared in the
local papers in mid-September, a
few weeks before fall-quarter
classes were set to begin.
"$2OO million in Stanford
charges questioned," proclaimed
the San Jose Mercury News in its
Sept. 19 morning edition.
The way The Peninsula Times
Tribune told it a few days later,
the story was even harder to
believe: "Feds may seek $300 mil
lion from Stanford," it thundered
in a bold, black type stretching
across the top of its front page.
If University President Donald
Kennedy took the early media
reports all that seriously, he didn't
let it show. He dismissed the
Times Tribune story as "imagina
tive," even joking at a late-
September meeting of the Faculty
Senate that the headline was
"enough to send Trustees off to
their cardiologists."
The various stories that sur
faced in the Bay Area papers were
based on allegations (it was later
learned) made by Paul Biddle, a
rough-and-tumble, no-holds
barred regulator from the Office
of Naval Research, the federal
agency responsible for overseeing
Stanford's use of government
research funds.
According to Biddle, the Uni
versity had repeatedly over
charged the government for indi
rect costs associated with federal
research conducted at Stanford —

According to Biddle, the University had
repeatedly overcharged the govern
ment for indirect costs associated with
federal research conducted at Stanford.

in essence, Biddle said, Stanford
had made a practice during the
1980s of padding its bills in order
to receive more money from Uncle
Sam than it was entitled to.
While the Navy bureaucracy had
managed to keep a muzzle on Bid
dle for several months, he found an
ardent supporter in Congressman
John Dingell, a powerful, mean and
respected Democrat from Michi
gan. Dingell and his Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations
had perfected the art of exposing
federal waste and abuse, most
notably in the defense contractor
scandals of the mid-'Bos.
In late August — a month
before Biddle's allegations were
leaked to the press — Dingell sent
Kennedy a letter informing him
that his subcommittee would be
looking into rising university
overhead rates. Kennedy was told
that Stanford would be the sub
committee's first "case study."
Biddle and Dingell proved to be
a deadly combination for the Uni
versity. The Navy official's free
wheeling allegations were the
match that ignited the firestorm
of federal scrutiny. Dingell and his
staff provided the fuel.
In the eyes of the media, the

controversy approached "scandal"
status in early December. Federal
auditors discovered that deprecia
tion on the 72-foot yacht Victoria
had been included in Stanford's
indirect-cost billings for several
years.
A beautiful recreational vessel
that had been donated to Stan
ford's Sailing program, the Victo
ria — with its marble counters,
wood-burning stoves and on
board jacuzzi — was for Dingell
and the media the perfect symbol
of all that was corrupt about Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices.
In reality, the yacht and other
sensational audit findings that
dominated press coverage in the
following months — flowers and
antiques in Kennedy's home, a
1987 reception for Kennedy's new
bride and administrative costs of
the Stanford Shopping Center —
had a minuscule impact on Stan
ford's indirect-cost rate.
As the fall and winter months
passed, the controversy over Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices
really became two controversies:
• One over the laundry list of
embarrassing audit findings; and
• The other over the validity of
various formulas Stanford had

been using to charge the govern
ment for the much more costly
but less sexy components of indi
rect-cost recovery — utilities,
building and equipment deprecia
tion and use of Stanford's

libraries by researchers.
The first of the two controver
sies was tailor-made for the
media. The second was much
more esoteric — "stuff for lawyers
and accountants," as one Stanford

researcher put it — and was
largely ignored by the press.
Stanford would lose big on both
counts.
