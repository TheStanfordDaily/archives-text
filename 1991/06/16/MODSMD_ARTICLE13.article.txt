# Pomp, delay and circumstance
## After stopping out for 35 years, senior Margaret Freeman is finally graduating 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
Like many students, Margaret
Freeman took a break between
her junior and senior years at
Stanford. Freeman, however, is
different than most students who
stop out — she did it for 35 years.
On Sunday, Freeman will
receive the bachelor's in English
she started in 1952.
Her 88-year-old mother Helen,
who often goaded her to return to
school, and her nine-month-old
granddaughter Kelsey will be on
campus, along with Freeman's
three children, to watch the grad
uation ceremony.
Freeman, who now lives in
Danville, Calif., left Stanford as a
junior in 1955 to live with her
husband, another Stanford stu
dent, who was graduating that
year.
After participating in Air Force
ROTC while enrolled at Stanford,
her husband was to be stationed

in Europe as a commissioned offi
cer upon graduation. Instead, he
was sent to Sacramento, Calif.,
and Freeman went with him.
Her husband Marshall said he
knew at the time "she was torn
about leaving school."
Freeman, a spunky woman
now in her 50s, raised three chil
dren and taught part-time in pub
lic schools while she was stopped
out. She said she always had a
desire to go back to school and
regretted that she did not finish
her degree earlier.
Her husband agreed. "She
wanted to have the satisfaction of
getting that degree — it gnawed
on her always for 30 years," he
said, adding that studying litera
ture "was always a passion of
hers."
Freeman's decision to come
back to the Farm came after read
ing a recent book by a woman who
had returned to college after being
away for 50 years.
Freeman eventually plans to

earn a graduate degree so she can
teach English in intermediate and
high schools, but encouraged all
people who have left school to go
back for the excitement of it.
She said returning to school
was exciting and absorbing, but
also placed a bit of a strain on her
home life. She was uneasy at first
about having her husband pre
pare meals and maintain the
house while she was in class.
And though her husband sup
ported her decision to go back to
school, he said he missed her
when she wasn't home. "The
hardest part of her being back in
school was not being able talk to
her — she's too busy studying,"
he said, adding that this made him
think about what not having a
mate at home feels like because he
frequently travels for business.
Freeman's husband now runs
Miller-Freeman, a publishing
company based in San Francisco.

Hilary Smith — Daily
mixed feelings, "a combination of
exhilaration and terror," Freeman
said, adding that she was "sur
prised to just be allowed to walk in
the door."
Though she appreciated the
fact that she was treated like a
regular student by professors, she
said she felt other students would
sometimes treat her with "too
much respect" because of her age,
particularly in small discussion
groups.
She felt, for example, some
ideas she talked about in discus
sions were not challenged by stu
dents of traditional college age

because they felt they had to treat
her with greater regard and
respect.
"People in special groups and
cultures have to face the same
thing," she added. "The treat
ment is not hostile, but makes you
feel like you are in a different cat
egory."
On the whole, Freeman said
she is impressed by the caliber of
professors and students at Stan
ford because "it seems to be
higher" than before.

"pace and intelligence of students

In the 19505, Freeman said, women didn't
necessarily think of pursuing their own
careers. It was not that they thought they
couldn't do it,' she said, 'but they would pur
sue careers that are stereotypically occupied
by females, like nursing and teaching.'

pursuing their own careers. "It
was not that they thought they
couldn't do it," she said, "but they
would pursue careers that are
stereotypically occupied by

females, like nursing and teach
ing."
She added that almost every
woman expected to get married
and have children, and many of
them found husbands at Stanford.
Today, Stanford students feel
guilty about getting married and
having children, she said.
"Men are feeling very chal

lenged by women and don't know
what to make of it," she said,
adding that the fact that more
women are feeling they can
achieve their goals often creates
tension.
Citing an instance when a man
in one of her classes said he felt
like the narrator frustrated with
women in James Joyce's "Portrait
of an Artist as a Young Man," she
said she felt sorry for young peo
ple because "dating seems to be so
confusing now."
Regarding multiculturalism
Freeman said, "It's exciting that
these groups have the opportunity
to voice opinions . . . [TJhere are
so many that are trying to be
heard."
In regard to the debate over the
creation of the Cultures, Ideas,

Values track, Freeman said that in
the 1950s students didn't chal
lenge curriculums. "Feelings and
ideas of Western Culture are still
alive and well in the English
Department," she added.
Finally, Freeman criticized the
press for its treatment of Stan
ford's indirect-cost controversy.
She said "they were having a field
day with this issue."
University President Donald
Kennedy "made a very good case"
about Stanford's spending in a let
ter written to all alumni, but he
didn't come across as well in news
reports.
She said she felt the question of
which expenses could be billed to
the government is "not a problem
unique to Stanford, but will be
faced bv all universities."

On the whole, Freeman said
she is impressed by the caliber of

In the 19505, Freeman said, women didn't

She added that almost every
woman expected to get married
and have children, and many of
them found husbands at Stanford.
Today, Stanford students feel
guilty about getting married and
having children, she said.
"Men are feeling very chal

lenged by women and don't know
what to make of it," she said,
adding that the fact that more
women are feeling they can
achieve their goals often creates
tension.
Citing an instance when a man
in one of her classes said he felt
like the narrator frustrated with
women in James Joyce's "Portrait
of an Artist as a Young Man," she
said she felt sorry for young peo
ple because "dating seems to be so
confusing now."
Regarding multiculturalism
Freeman said, "It's exciting that
these groups have the opportunity
to voice opinions . . . [TJhere are
so many that are trying to be
heard."
In regard to the debate over the
creation of the Cultures, Ideas,

Values track, Freeman said that in
the 1950s students didn't chal
lenge curriculums. "Feelings and
ideas of Western Culture are still
alive and well in the English
Department," she added.
Finally, Freeman criticized the
press for its treatment of Stan
ford's indirect-cost controversy.
She said "they were having a field
day with this issue."
University President Donald
Kennedy "made a very good case"
about Stanford's spending in a let
ter written to all alumni, but he
didn't come across as well in news
reports.
She said she felt the question of
which expenses could be billed to
the government is "not a problem
unique to Stanford, but will be
faced bv all universities."
Like many students, Margaret
Freeman took a break between
her junior and senior years at
Stanford. Freeman, however, is
different than most students who
stop out — she did it for 35 years.
On Sunday, Freeman will
receive the bachelor's in English
she started in 1952.
Her 88-year-old mother Helen,
who often goaded her to return to
school, and her nine-month-old
granddaughter Kelsey will be on
campus, along with Freeman's
three children, to watch the grad
uation ceremony.
Freeman, who now lives in
Danville, Calif., left Stanford as a
junior in 1955 to live with her
husband, another Stanford stu
dent, who was graduating that
year.
After participating in Air Force
ROTC while enrolled at Stanford,
her husband was to be stationed

in Europe as a commissioned offi
cer upon graduation. Instead, he
was sent to Sacramento, Calif.,
and Freeman went with him.
Her husband Marshall said he
knew at the time "she was torn
about leaving school."
Freeman, a spunky woman
now in her 50s, raised three chil
dren and taught part-time in pub
lic schools while she was stopped
out. She said she always had a
desire to go back to school and
regretted that she did not finish
her degree earlier.
Her husband agreed. "She
wanted to have the satisfaction of
getting that degree — it gnawed
on her always for 30 years," he
said, adding that studying litera
ture "was always a passion of
hers."
Freeman's decision to come
back to the Farm came after read
ing a recent book by a woman who
had returned to college after being
away for 50 years.
Freeman eventually plans to

earn a graduate degree so she can
teach English in intermediate and
high schools, but encouraged all
people who have left school to go
back for the excitement of it.
She said returning to school
was exciting and absorbing, but
also placed a bit of a strain on her
home life. She was uneasy at first
about having her husband pre
pare meals and maintain the
house while she was in class.
And though her husband sup
ported her decision to go back to
school, he said he missed her
when she wasn't home. "The
hardest part of her being back in
school was not being able talk to
her — she's too busy studying,"
he said, adding that this made him
think about what not having a
mate at home feels like because he
frequently travels for business.
Freeman's husband now runs
Miller-Freeman, a publishing
company based in San Francisco.

fact that she was treated like a
regular student by professors, she
said she felt other students would
sometimes treat her with "too
much respect" because of her age,
