# Nightmares of hors d'oeuvres hell: torture by cocktail party
## 
### 
At night, the wind howls through my
dorm room, rattling the thin panes of
my window A furry, brown squirrel
scurries frantically across the courtyard,
searching for an abandoned tray of food as
a freshman, looking for the pass key, awak
ens a resident assistant. Somewhere, a man
gets out of a white golf cart to put a ticket
on a car as a mosquito finishes eating my
ankle and I suddenly — awake! Shenani
gans, just another nightmare about cocktail
parties.
Yes, cocktail parties. We graduate, go out
into the real world and go to cocktail par
ties. I'm terrified that the future ahead of
us is a lot of politely bored people standing
around for torturous hours talking about
things they don't care about. Our Stanford
education has in no way prepared us for the
reality of small talk and mature social
interaction. Sure, we can write papers, we
can jump and say "woo" on the eighth

count of "All Right Now," but I for one don't
feel at all prepared to flex my gregarious
muscles while standing over finger sand
wiches and celery sticks.
My current experience with cocktail par
ties has been cultivated through attending
soirees that my parents dragged me to
when I was home on vacation. I suppose I
should be proud of the fact that my parents
now consider me mature enough to suffer
through these events with them, but the
ego boost wears off as my plastic smile
wears thin.
The recurring nightmare scenario: They
introduce me to lots of distant acquain
tances as their wonderful daughter who
goes to STANFORD (that little-known
school in California for smart people whose
parents really love them). The acquain
tances smile, shake my hand and tell me I
look just like my mother. I smile and hope
that's the end of it. Can we go now? No, we

have to extend the conversation somewhat.
I sustain the smile.
"Debbie, what are you studying?"
"Music." (My Dad hangs his head in sor
row: I let the family secret out. I'm going to
Stanford and I'm not studying engineer
ing.) Their reply: "Oh, that's nice. I like
music."
Well, I guess they like music. That's a
start.
Can we go now, please? I don't know
these people; they don't know me. We have
nothing in common and I hate mixed
drinks. The only good thing I learned at
cocktail parties is how long I could spend in
a bathroom avoiding older men who find
me interesting to look at and women who
want me to talk to their wonderful sons
about going to college. If I'm really unlucky,
the host will uncover her grandmother's
1950 upright, ivory nightmare that hasn't
been tuned since Ronald Reagan entered

office and ask me to play something. No!
Don't let it happen!
Every passing moment in this cerebral
hell, I realize how much I like my parents.
Alone. At the dinner table talking about
real things. Sitting in front of the hypnotic
box watching old movies. Gossiping about
my brother and sister. But I guess at least
at a cocktail penance the family bears the
heavy social cross together, so that in our
misery we gain at least a little quality bond
ing.
But the real world? When I graduate and
supposedly have my own life, will I tnen be
forced to go these things by myself? Christ
mas parties, Memorial Day barbecues, St.
Patrick's Day potluck dinners, Easter
brunches — a graduate is thrown to the
hors d'oeuvres without any preparation or
warning. The real-world party is the mod-

ern torture rack, where the mun
dane reigns and each pregnant
pause pulls the pegs a little
tighter, lashing you with dead-end
conversation leads like, "Oh, I
like music."
It's a sobering thought. I sup
pose you might venture to say
that a college degree isn't sup
posed to prepare you for the
future; it's supposed to make you

appreciate the past — those good
old college days when everything
was more fun. But you know, peo
ple spill beer on you at college par
ties, and the music is usually so
loud that you couldn't hold an
intelligent conversation with
someone if you tried.
The cocktail nightmare may
come true, but maybe by then I'll
be the one hosting the party. If so,
at least I'll know my piano will be
tuned.
