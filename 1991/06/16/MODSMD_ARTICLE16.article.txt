# 7 been called a faggot, but I ain't got time to sing the blues'

Yy all, after four years at Stanford I
have me a new motto: "(Leave Me
The Fuck Alone) 'Cause You Ain't
Gone Worry Me." Actually, it ain't that
new. My girlfriend Aleta hipped me to this
motto two years ago, and we been livin' the
glamorous life ever since. OK.
Life is rough. I'm speakin' from experi
ence. Life has kicked my ass before and is
going to kick it some more. I ain't but 22
years old (yeah, still wet behind the ears),
but I been on this earth long enough to
know that when it comes to life, it's in the
takin' what it gives you.
If there's one lesson I've learned in life,
it's how to love ME. Now, this ain't none of
that A Me Generation" shit. I'm talkin'
about self-love. I'm talkin' about how to
survive when it look like the whole world is
on your back tryin' to beat you down.
I've learned that folks always gone have
somethin' to say about you. If it ain't one
thing it's another. First, they said I was too

miscellaneous, that 1 wasn't black enough;
then they said I was too black; then they
said I was too gay. And just like Topsy
Washington, I used to get into a rage any
time anybody tried to label and define me.
Now I just give them at-ti-tude, and go
about the business of being me. Ma Rainey
said it best when she said "What you all say
don't count with me. You understand? Ma
listens to the voice inside her. That's what
counts with Ma." That's right, I'm listenin'
to the voice inside my head.
Bobby McFerrin said it too: "Don't
worry be happy." Now, y'all can talk about
McFerrin all y'all want, but he on to some
thin' positive. You might ask, how in the
hell can I be happy in a world plagued with
racism and homophobia? Well, I ain't say
ing I ain't never experienced racism or
homophobia. I been called a nigger. Been
called a faggot. And done had my life
threatened for bein' both. But it's like
Pearl Cleage said, I ain't got time to sing

Don't get me wrong, my motto has its conse
quences: freedom or death. If I can't have the free
dom to live my life as an openly black gay man,
then kill me.

the blues, 'cause if I did, I'd probably spend
the rest of my life cryin' and I've got too
much stuff to do. I can't think about how
many racists or homophobic motherfuck
ers are out there waitin' to gobble me up. I
know I have a right to sing the blues, but I
take racism and homophobia as a given and
keep on keepin' on.
But I didn't really learn how to say
"Fuck You!" until I came to Stanford.
Daddy always said give credit where credit
is due. Well, I got to give Stanford two
snaps up 'cause if it weren't for this place,
I would still be sittin' at home worrin'

about what other folks was sayin' and
thinkin' about me. My Stanford education,
both inside and outside the classroom,
taught me how to survive by bein' me.
Folks may think my motto is anti-com
munity, that's it's just about me me me me
me me me me me. But there ain't nothin'
anti-community about it, 'cause my motto
comes from my felt sense of the black and
gay experience; it comes from the accumu
lated wisdom from my own experience and
from other black and gay people.
