# Finding the future in storm of changing goals, closing doors
## 
### 
What a year! All this time a time
bomb has been ticking away some
where in the depths of my mind.
Since fall quarter, my friends and I have
been counting the months — or weeks —
before graduation. Seniors of past classes
warned me how quickly this year would go,
but it is still unbelievable to me.
I am graduating. Now.
For me, the hardest part about being a
senior in college, as compared to being a
senior in high school, was deciding what I
was going to do after school ended. In high
school, the answer was easy: I knew I
wanted to go to college and I knew the ones
to which I wanted to apply. I didn't have to
go through the arduous process of evaluat
ing what was important to me or what I
was particularly skilled at doing.
One question that never came up in high
school but that I had to deal with for most
of my Stanford career was "What is your
mcyor?" I could appease most of the curious
by saying "I am a human biology major
concentrating in organizations and design,
hoping to work in management consulting
in the health industry." That pat answer

seemed to satisfy most and let me off the
hook from having to say I really didn't
know what I wanted to do.
This year, however, that question was
replaced by, "Sooo, what are you going to do
after you graduate?" Coming up with an
answer wasn't as easy. When I had
wavered, earlier in college, between declar
ing human biology or pursuing product
design, my mother pinpointed the crux of
my dilemma, which continued until my
senior year. For the first time in my life, I
did not have a tangible goal.
I spent a great deal of time at the Career
Planning and Placement Center this year,
hoping that by flipping through material,
the answer to my future would appear.
"What do you want to do?" kept echoing
through my mind. I tried to imagine myself
building schools and latrines in a Third
World country with the Peace Corps, work
ing until 3 a.m. each night as a financial
analyst in New York City, designing and
implementing my own public service pro
ject in San Francisco, or living and study
ing in Hong Kong.
The greatest challenge for me was to

find a job that would enable me to pursue
my public service interests, make enough
money to keep a roof over my head and,
above all, make me happy. The good news is
that this is possible.
I have chosen to work for Carnation, a
division of Nestle USA, a large consumer
products corporation with a strong com
mitment to public service. All employees
are encouraged to donate funds and volun
teer time to United Way programs.
It scares me to know that every action I
take has long-term repercussions on my
life. I wonder what doors I may have closed
with my first career move. I may have
simultaneously opened the door to choco
late chip heaven and closed off the possibil
ity of becoming a firewoman or an
astronomer (two of my childhood dreams).
Despite these misgivings, however, I am
relieved that now I have an answer to the
question, "What are you going to do after
graduation?"
I believe that everything always works
out, even if it isn't as planned. When I came
to Stanford, I thought that my destiny was
to become a female, Asian, electrical engi

neer with a master's in business (although
my dream was to become a television news
anchor). Four years later, I am not an engi
neer; in fact, the fuzzy world won me over
after my first quarter. It is somewhat com
forting to know that nothing is certain and
not knowing what you want in life is OK.
I am grateful that, for the next couple
years of my life, I have a well-prescribed
path. However, by the time we meet again
at our five-year reunion, I am sure that my
goals will have changed another two or
three times. The world would be boring if
goals did not change and our lives were not
shaken up once in a while. I still have much
more learning to do, but I am happy with
the choices I have made and the lessons I
have learned and, above all, the people I
have met here at Stanford.
Congratulations and good luck to the
class of 1991!

people and to laugh.
