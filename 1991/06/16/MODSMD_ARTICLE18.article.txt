# After inspiring 1,200 students, Canul takes show on the road
## 
### Peter Robison Staff writer 
Four years ago, Michael Canul had a dream. It
was a dream of helping his community and helping
Mexican-American students like himself achieve
their own dreams.
So as a freshman at Stanford, Canul decided to do
something about it. He organized Project Motiva
tion, a group that has worked to build the motiva
tion and self-esteem of Mexican-American high
school and junior high school students by encourag
ing them to attend college.
The organization has been successful,"
Canul says. He estimates that Project Motivation
has reached more than 1,200 Mexican-American
children in California during his four years at Stan
ford, in schools as far north as Sacramento and as
far south as San Diego.
Canul says evaluations from students, counselors
and teachers have been positive. "They've all said
we've had an overwhelming impact."
The impact of Project Motivation, according to
Canul, comes from its use of college students to talk
to high school students and educate them about
what choices they need to make to attend college.
"College students are valuable role models,"
Canul explains. "Kids respond really well to them,
differently than they do to teachers or administra
tors."
Canul is graduating with honors in political sci
ence. Project Motivation will continue next year
without Canul as its administrative director.
A funding scare this year — after the organiza
tion was inadvertently left off the ASSU ballot and

then failed to receive the approval of 15 percent of
the student body in a special election — will not pose
a threat to its future operation, Canul says.
The organization, he says, will reach its $15,000
budget requirement through a $1,700 grant from
the Haas Public Service Center, a $6,000 award from
the ASSU Senate and summer fund raising.
And although Canul will not be here next year
leading Project Motivation, he will continue working
to help his community.
For the next two years, as a John Gardner/Echo
ing Green Fellow, Canul will receive a fellowship
stipend to work with Mexican-American students,
encouraging them to attend college.
"I'm on cloud nine," he says about the fellowship.
"I'm so thankful for this opportunity."
Using either San Jose State or San Francisco
State as a base, Canul will begin working with Mex
ican-American high school students next year, in
much the same way he has at Project Motivation.
He says he will "begin small" at first — working
with only one high school and two feeder junior high
schools. But Canul says during the second year he
will double his scope, adding another high school
and two more junior high schools.
Canul says he wants to continue in public service
because the children he works with are members of
his community and face the same challenges he did.
Growing up in East San Jose, attending high
schools with high dropout and pregnancy rates,
Canul says he came to understand how difficult it is
to succeed — or even stay afloat — in such a bleak
environment.
He notes that 50 percent of all Mexican-American

students drop out before finishing high school in
California. Only 12 percent graduate from college
five years after high school.
Canul adds that most Mexican-American children
do not get the information they need to make effec
tive decisions about courses and college planning in
high school. In one poll, 76 percent of Mexican-

American high school students in California did not
know any of the requirements for attending either
the California state or University of California
schools.
Canul thinks Project Motivation has helped to
solve that problem, and he hopes to continue solving
it.
