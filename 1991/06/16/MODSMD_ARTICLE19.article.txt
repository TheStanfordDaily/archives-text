# After seven years and 100,000 applications, Dean Jean will travel, write her memoirs
## 
### Marie Bui Staff writer 
One Saturday morning in June 1984, University
President Donald Kennedy called Jean Fetter to his
office and asked her to take the position of dean of
admissions.
"Immediately after I replied yes, I was thinking,
4 Oh my gosh, can Ido this?'" Fetter recalls.
During the next seven years she read 100,000
applications and individually labeled thousands of
acceptance letters with her trademark "Bravo!" or
"Super!" But that was not the hardest part of the job
for her.
"This is a very complex assignment here. It
involves more than the selection of the best stu
dents. In a very basic sense, it's trying to assess
human character. That's 'mission impossible,"' Fet
ter says, quoting a phrase from her role as Glinda
the Good Witch in Gaieties a few years ago.
When she accepted the position in 1984, Fetter
said she knew it would be difficult for anyone to han
dle such a demanding job for more than five to seven
years.
Sitting in her office overlooking the fountain in
Old Union, Fetter is surrounded by potted plants,
NCAA baseball trophies, old photos of Stanford and
a few postcards of her native South Wales. There,
the attractive 53-year-old dean said she is beginning
to realize that she has already lived two-thirds of her
life. She hopes to make the best of the last third.
Following Commencement, she and her husband
plan to spend 10 days bicycling through the Dor
donnes Valley in France. Then she will trek through
the cathedrals of England with her mother.
Next fall, during a one-year sabbatical at the
School of Education, Fetter hopes to write a personal
reflection about her career as an admissions officer,
possibly examining issues such as affirmative action
and multiculturalism.
In October, she will take a break to visit her son,
Andrew, who is teaching English in Korea.
Following her official resignation Aug. 31, Fetter
will approach one of her favorite responsibilities,
freshman advising, with renewed enthusiasm. She
still keeps in touch with advisees from as far back as
1978.
But after all the trips and time for personal reflec
tion, Fetter will have to start looking for a juu, just
like the graduating seniors, she says.
Fetter says students and faculty who tend to be
high achievers like herself can benefit from her
example. The change of work will give her perspec
tive about the balance between her personal and
professional lives, she explains.
"It's easy to get off-kilter."
"Dean Jean," as she is affectionately known,

tion. Affectionately known as Dean Jean, Fetter has held her job for seven years,
has read over 100,000 applications and has appeared in Gaieties several times.
After a one yaer sabbatical, Fetter will be looking for a lob — just like this year's
graduates.
