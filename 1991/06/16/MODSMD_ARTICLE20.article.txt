# Just as worries of Stanford melted into everyday life, so will worries about future
## 
### 
Remember how we felt at the
end of our high school
careers — almost exactly
four years ago? We had struggled
for weeks trying to convey our
charisma and intelligence through
college application essays, supple
menting those masterpieces with
detailed accounts of our extracur
ricular activities.
But in the end, it was worth it.
After a few long months of wait
ing, we were accepted to Stanford.
We occupied our summers by
trying to picture what college life
would be like. Remembering a few
things from Pro Fro Week and
armed with the stream of mail
flowing from the Office of Under
graduate Admissions, we tried to
imagine how we would spend the
next four years. We conjurcd up
images of dormitories, professors,
parties, exams and — especially —
roommates. We created the whole
campus, a whole typical day, in
our imaginations. The resulting
picture was usually part glossy
photo, part high school in disguise
and part indistinguishable haze.
As we speculated, we also tried
to predict how we would fit into
this picture. Would we end up
with a group of friends just like
our highschool buddies? Would we
flounder or shine in physics, West
ern Culture, freshman English?
Would we start dressing like
stereotypical California surfers,
as our televisions reflected?
In spite of all the time and
energy we collectively spent antic
ipating Stanford, once here we
soon forgot to be self-conscious.
Maybe we posed a little bit during
Orientation, but the demands of
reality soon taught us to be our
selves. Friendships were fairly
spontaneous, classes were chal
lenging but not impossible and
dress was whatever we had in the
closet that fit the weather. The
hopes and worries we had har
bored all summer melted into
everyday life.
College wasn't the first time we
experienced this phenomenon,
nor will it be the last. When we
were 5 years old, our first bus
rides and our first lunch boxes

seemed to be laden with mystery,
but our awe vanished as soon as
the recess bell rang and we began
to be our instinctive, noisy, ener
getic selves. All of the coaxing and
admonitions our parents had used
to prepare us slid into our subcon
scious as we played.
Today, we are all wondering
about different futures. Some of
us are trying to visualize work in
towering office buildings, men
tally hefting briefcases and prac
ticing firm handshakes. Some are
thinking about donning lab coats,
seeing their names at the top of
journal articles and wondering
whether gel electrophoresis and
gas chromatography will lose
their charm after a couple of
years.
Physical moves complicate the
picture: We imagine new cities and
new homes, and wonder how the
people who are important to us
now will ever surface there. Some
of us let our minds wander to
other parts of the world and try to
create images of life as English
teachers or Peace Corps members.
And, of course, many of us are still
juggling all these and other possi
ble alternatives, simply wonder
ing which scenario will become
our own.
No matter what the future


Julia Kazaks
seems to offer, we are preoccupied,
enchanted, concerned about
exactly how we will live it out.
Just as we did in kindergarten,
and just as we did before coming
to Stanford, we are mentally
jumping forward to familiarize
ourselves with the future before it
confronts us as the present. We
are trying to carve out places for
ourselves, supposing our sur
roundings will be a certain way
and deciding how we can best live
among them.
Although it is obviously normal
to wonder about our future, we

can calm our strongest fears and
offset our most hazy uncertainties
by assuring ourselves that this
transition will be no different
than any other. After our imagina
tion is superseded by reality, we
will settle into new lives with little
fuss. We will face obstacles, but we
will also find success. As we begin
new endeavors, the only expecta
tions we should try to hold on to
are the positive ones.
And though we should be
aware that the future is unpre
dictable, it cannot hurt to cling to
our hopes and try to realize them.
Daydreams can still come true
every now and then.
