# Those who can't, don't; those who can, teach
## 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
Driven by an overwhelming
sense of wanting to return some
thing to the community, a small
proportion of Stanford graduates
have decided against entering the
corporate world. Instead, these
soon-to-be alumni have commit
ted themselves to educating the
nation's youth.
"I can't think of a more impor
tant thing to do with my degree....
If I don't do it, then who will?"
said senior Mike Fee, who will be
teaching highschool English in
rural Arkansas next year as a part
of the Teach for America program.
Teach for America is a new
national corps of teachers mod
eled after the Peace Corps. Partic
ipants in the program are
assigned to a specific public school
for two years.
Some students have chosen
Teach for America instead of try
ing to find a teaching job on their
own because the program does not
require a teaching credential and
provides a strong support net
work.
"I chose [Teach for America]
because it allows me to go into
teaching before I'm sure I want to
devote my life to it. If I don't

remain a teacher, I can at least
look back and know that I did
something really good with my
life, " Fee said.
Other students who will be
teaching independently next year
echoed the feeling of not wanting
to devote an entire year to getting
a credential. Liz Perez, who is
teaching high-school physics at a
private school in Los Angeles this
fall, chose to teach at a private
school for just that reason. She
said she also felt the students at a
private school would be generally
more motivated, an important
consideration for a novice teacher.
Teach for America corps mem
bers are sent to either rural or
inner-city school districts suffer
ing from a shortage of qualified
teachers. Fee opted for a rural spot
because he wanted "to become a
force in the community ... beyond
just being a teacher," he said.
Out of the 40 Stanford stu
dents who applied for the pro
gram, seven will be teaching next
fall, according to Catherine Hot
tenrott of Teach for America.
Hottenrott attributed the
increased interest in teaching to
the tight job market as well as to a
general growing interest in public
sector jobs.
Many of the soon-to-be-teach

ers feel that they are becoming
teachers in spite of the prevailing
preprofessional sentiment on
campus.
Perez felt the general attitude
among students is very career-ori
ented. "If anything, Stanford has
discouraged me [from teaching],"
she said.
Another Teach for America
corps member, Ron Young, who
will be teaching elementary school
in Oakland next year, attributed
this to the fact that "teaching
isn't that glamorous." He also
believed that many students feel
that after four years and tens of
thousands of dollars spent at
Stanford, "it is time to start trying
to make up that amount."
Some of the biggest apprehen
sions among the future educators
is fear of the unknown and fear
that they will not be good teach
ers.
"It's definitely one of my
biggest fears, but I think I'll good
at it," Fee said.
Young echoed this sentiment.
"I've never done anything like
this before. It's really frightening
. . . just to think about trying to
keep [my students'] attention . . .
I can see a room full of chaos," he
said.
