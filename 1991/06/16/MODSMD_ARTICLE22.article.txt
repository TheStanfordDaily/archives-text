As a former copywriter for a advertising
agency, I cannot possibly overemphasize the
importance of advertising in our society
What am I saying? Of course I can overemphasize
the importance of advertising in our society. How
about: "Without advertising, every person on Earth
would grow antlers and speak broken Portuguese."

Ahem. Excuse me if I seem just a wee bit sarcas
tic, but that's how you'd feel if you had just spent a
year of your life working in an industry whose major
contribution to modern philosophical thought is
"Where's the Beef?"
To recap: A year ago I was a normal, well-adjusted
Stanford senior. Four easy years of studying linguis
tics, the mtgor equivalent of diet soda ("The Degree
of a Lazy Generation"), had left me tanned, relaxed
and ready to get started in a rewarding career.
Unfortunately, I stumbled into advertising, a pro
fession many young writers fall into, lured by the
promise of easy cash and opportunities to write com
mercials starring famous ex-human Michael Jack
son.
Being in Alaska, however, my agency had none of

the glamorous accounts you associate with advertis
ing. No Budweiser. No Bo Knows. No Calvin Klein's
Obsession For Men Who Have Accents You Would
Ordinarily Associate With A Klingon.
Nope, what we have in Alaska are oil companies,
and their one singular purpose is to convince the
public that they care very, very deeply about the
Earth, notwithstanding the fact that they regularly
drill holes in it, spill oil on it, etc.
Exxon, for instance, has launched a major new
campaign to let the public know that the Prince
William Sound oil spill was actually good for the
environment. Two years after the spill, says Exxon,
you can actually see twice as many salmon as before
the spill, ignoring the fact that the only reason
you're seeing them is that they're floating on the
surface.
But as an advertising copywriter you're not
expected to question whether the companies you're
advertising actually live up to their claims. No, you
simply sit at your computer, cranking out headline
and slogans such as "Exxon: Greasing Alaska."
Yet strangely, copywriters are highly revered in
the advertising industry. Revered to the point that I
would often get into conversations like:
CLIENT: "We need a phrase to explain that our
product is new and improved."
ME: "How about 'New and improved'?"
CLIENT: "You're brilliant!"
And it went on like this, month after month, until
the arrival of the world-famous Oscar Mayer
Wienermobile changed my life forever. The Wiener
mobile is a 23-foot-long hot dog on wheels. A con
verted Ford van, it travels from state to state publi
cizing Oscar Mayer Wieners.
As you might well imagine, the Wienermobile is
