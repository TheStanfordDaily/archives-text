# Speaker Gardner seeks 'judgment in action'
## 
### Larissa Thompson 
Commencement speaker John
Gardner has been called Stan
ford's "designated source of
inspiration and wise counsel" by
University President Donald
Kennedy. A Stanford graduate
and professor of public service,
Gardner served as President
Johnson's Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare and
founded the organizations Com
mon Cause, the Independent Sec
tor and the National Urban
Coalition. He has authored six
books on the subjects of leadership
and education. In 1964, Gardner
received one of the highest civilian
awards in the United States, the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Below are excerpts from an
interview earlier this year which

give a feel for Gardner's perspec
tive.
On how to changc society
I think people make contribu
tions depending on their gifts.
Rachel Carson wrote a book called
"Silent Spring" which had as big
an impact on the environmental
movement as any of the organiza
tional leaders. She was a writer.
That was her contribution. She
was, in her way, a leader.
Other people have great orga
nizational skills [or] are skilled at
serving in political office. . . . But
they all involve a long-term con
ception of what change is and how
it comes about.
On what makes a good leader
I would put . . . number one
what I call judgment in action,

[meaning] judgment that brings
you to the right outcomes when
the data is insufficient for a deci
sion, ... a judgment made when
people are yelling at you and the
time is too short.
The second, I have to say, is
probably physical stamina. . . . I
spend a lot of time working with
leaders in the ghetto and in
unions and in work situations.
They're the ones who can put in a
full day's work and still go to the
union meeting at night, or the
meeting for their ethnic group, or
whatever it is, and spend three
hours being a leader.
There are lots of other things,
such as courage. It does take a cer
tain amount of courage, because a
lot of people don't want to do what
you're trying to talk them into.
You make enemies.
