Hilary Smith — Daily
Give us the S!
This is a replica of one of the two giant sandstone signs given
to the University as a gift from the class of 1991. The pieces, to
salute the first 100 years of Stanford's history, have been con
structed from the same sandstone — quarried in the 1890s —
used to build the Inner Quad and the Palm Drive arches and
will be placed at entrances to Stanford.
