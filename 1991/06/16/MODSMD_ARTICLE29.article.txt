# 'Home Alone' nightmares solved
## Non-graduate gives advice to those on the way out 
### 
So, you're graduating.
Lucky you.
For some of you things won't change much —
you'll either be serving another three to eight at
some institution of higher learning, or spending yet
another year on line with Stuart Reges looking for a
job.
But the rest of you are going to embark upon life's
biggest adventure — the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride of life.
Everything you've done up until now has, in one
form or another, been built up trying to answer this
one great, all encompassing question — "What am I
gonna be when I grow up?" And now you know.

So go ahead, go nuts. Walk into Nordstrom's in
your shorts and "Paloma Coma" T-shirt and order
the salespeople around like some giddy Clearing
house Sweepstakes winner with a purpose. Get one
of those ugly, yet picturesque, Bryant Gumble ties so
you can take your boss's polydactyl cousin out to
Chilis. Heck, after all, you have your very own, per
sonal, private mailbox now, where no one will see you
— so you can subscribe to whatever magazine you
want to, even the National Review. Gosh, it's just
like your parents were going away for a long week
end.
But they're never coming back.
That's right, you've plunged yourself into your
own little Macaulay Culkin-"Home Alone" hell.
You're an adult now.
But don't fear, it's not hopeless. You too can be
helped, with Joel Stein's easy-to-follow, homemade
cure to "the illusion of stability™."
Let me show you an example.
The other day a senior, just about your size, inti
mated to me that he had landed a job.
"Congratulations," 1 wryly squeaked, "What will
you be doing?"

He started to glow. His started to glee. He face
started to light up like Mr. Rogers' does when he
pulls that little trolley out from behind the couch.
"I'm a Market Research Analyst."
He had not yet even started his job, but he already
had a title — a new identity. He was no longer Trace,
the typical Stanford undergraduate known only for
his unusual first name. No. Now he was Trace, the
Market Research Consultant. He was someone to be
reckoned with.
Upon further questioning, it was revealed that
Trace had no idea of what his job consisted. For all he
knew, I thoughtfully pointed out, he could be selling
plastic roses on K1 Camino Real.
But this did not faze him in the least.
He had already bought his market research con
sultant clothes and even had some cool market
research consultant catch phrases down cold, such
as "demographically impotent."
Trace thought he was going to be a market
research consultant forever.
But then I told Trace about the "illusion of stabil
ity™," and how he was letting it ruin his life. Trace
listened to what I was saying and felt a whole lot bet
ter.
And here, in this small space, I am going to give
you the same advice I gave Trace, in easy-to-read,
aphorism format.
• View yourself as a small piece of inedible fruit
amid a large, gooey, yet-unflavored-but-still-liquified
vat of Fruit Roll-Ups. You can become any flavor and
spread yourself over whatever area you like;
• Recognize the ever-changing nature of the uni
verse. One minute you're a big political mover in the
academic world, next minute you're stuffing $50
bills under your mattress. One minute you're a fat,
overaged optimist searching for the world heavy
weight title, next minute you're a fat, overaged opti
mist; and
• Avoid work at all costs. You know those people
who win $20 million in the lottery and say that
they're still going to keep their jobs? Well, they're
stupid. There is absolutely no reason we need to jus
tify our lives through our evolutionized methods of
self-preservation.
With these small pieces of advice, you too can be
like my other disciples. You too can make money off
real estate that doesn't exist and surround yourself
with cheesy, silicone models in bikinis.

Well, maybe not, but at least you'll feel better
about yourself. At least, when you look at yourself in
the mirror, you won't see miniature versions of that
scary guy with the monocle in the "Express Your
self" video, floating around your reflection, defiantly
mocking you. I know how painful that can be.
Things will change during your life, and every so
often the thought "I should have just gone to gradu
ate school" might hit you. But just remember, it's
never too late. You're always welcome here. As long
as you continue to donate lots and lots of money.
(What? Beginning your tithe late? You didn't fall for
that "100 years, 100 dollars" scam?)
I guess, in my own little Mario Thomasesque way,
I'm just trying to say that you're free to be

whomever you want to, whenever you want to. And
if that means working for a multinational firm poi
soning Third World countries with contaminated
carbonated beverages, well, I guess that's just what
it means.
And in the meantime, I will silently mock you as I
wake up for 11 a.m. classes and complain.
Gosh, I sure wish I was graduating.

Joel Stein's editor is graduating and is not too
happy about it. She hopes Joel has a five-times-a
week, 8 a.m. class for the rest of his life. She also
hopes that sometime before he graduates, Joel learns
that the "was' in his closing sentence should be a
"were."
