# Seniors learned a lot at Stanford — much of it outside of class
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Four years ago they were impressionable, naive
teen-agers, bumbling around campus, groping about
for a new set of values, sweating through classes for
a m*yor they would end up dropping two years later.
Today, as sophisticated seniors, they strut about
with decisiveness, they spout great insights and they
speak from perspectives broadened by four years of
new experiences and impressions. Their stomachs
have learned the joys of sushi and frozen yogurt;
their minds have discovered the finer points of Marx,
Milton and Mendel.
While they have enjoyed their four years of intel
lectual and nutritional "grazing" on the Farm, most
seniors say they are ready to face the world beyond
Palm Drive. As they prepare to graduate, they reflect
on the past four years and consider how their per
spectives on life, people and Stanford have evolved.
Not everything is learned in class
"I thought I'd be learning all these great things
from world-renowned Nobel Prize winners and that
people would all be smart," says Garrett Scott. "And
a lot of people here are smart — in the way that they
can figure how to get through classes doing the min
imum and still get good grades."
Scott says he came to Stanford thinking he would
get the perfect university education, but he has real
ized that classes are not for him. However, Scott has
learned a lot — outside of class. He and his "flaky
friends" chose more exotic educational routes,
rather than grinding away to become "model stu
dents." An English Scott says he has come to
realize that his biographer will describe him as hav
ing "a checkered academic past," but he has no
regrets.
Students are 'merely mortals'
Sarah Willburn says she came to Stanford expect
ing everyone to be "superhuman," but found out
that they were like her — merely mortal. She
thought Stanford would be a "much wilder place,
with illicit things going on behind every door," but
has found a lot of people from a background similar
to hers, and with similar morals. "Stanford is much
more wholesome than my high school!" exclaims
Willburn, a native of Modesto, Ca.
Drinking isn't a 'mortal sin'
Libby Feil thought Stanford would be really
intense, "like Harvard and Yale." She expected to see
people "cloistered in halls, studying everywhere."
But she didn't, and figured people didn't study.
Later, however, Feil realized Stanford students really
are intense, they just don't let anybody see it.
Feil, a human biology says that she has
worked hard at Stanford. Bound for Dartmouth
Medical School next fall, Feil believes her years here
have been a good transition between high school and
medical school, which she believes will be even more
rigorous than Stanford.
Feil says that through interaction with other stu
dents she has become knowledgeable about a wide
variety of subjects. "I've learned a lot about the situ
ation in the Baltics," she says with a smile. Her

roommate, senior Marja Lutsep, heads the Stanford
Baltic Alliance and has adorned their room with
Estonian flags.
Living in the dormitory has also caused Feil to
adopt new attitudes toward drinking. "When I got
here," says Feil, "I thought drinking was a mortal
sin." Although she still has yet to sip an alcoholic
beverage, Feil says she no longer condemns drinkers.
"Friends I have now drink, and I realize some of
them are actually pretty nice."

Sarah Willburn says she
came to Stanford expecting
everyone to be 'superhu
man,' but found out that they
were like her — merely mor
tal.

There are lots of cultures on this Farm
Chemical engineering major Erik Hancock says
he thought classes would all be of a "super-high cal
iber" and "require you to be on your toes all the
time," but he found it possible to get by in a more
relaxed manner.
Hancock, who comes from a small farming town
in Oregon, says that being exposed to people from
different cultural backgrounds for the first time has
been a learning experience. "The experience of deal
ing with people from many other cultures has given
me insight into what goes on in American culture.
All I had before was experience with rural America,"
he says.
Hancock, who had encountered few Jewish peo
ple before coming to Stanford, says learning about
the Jewish culture has been particularly interesting
for him. "I've learned a lot about holidays such as
Rosh Hashana and about Kosher eating habits —
the separation of milk and meat, the matzoh for
Passover."
Roommates fought like cats and dogs
Steve Barrera says he came to Stanford with no
preconceived notions, "just waiting for the first
thing to happen." His freshman roommate was his
first impression and he learned quickly what life
could be like in close quarters with someone whose
ideas differed so radically from his own. Coming
from a Catholic high school in conservative Fresno,
Ca., Barrera never had his values seriously ques
tioned.
When his roommate challenged him, Barrera
says, "we'd fight like cats and dogs." He has since
learned to be more open-minded and to accept radi
cally different view points. "I've eased up on my
strong position," Barrera says, adding that, while he
was very impressionable for a couple of years during
college, he's reached an "equilibrium" now.
'Foreign' doesn't mean 'exotic'
Coming to Stanford from Massachusetts, Debbie

Palmer's world has been broadened and her possibil
ities for the future expanded. "The world has become
a, more comfortable place for me. I could pop off
5,000 miles and I wouldn't mind," she says.
Palmer says she came into Stanford looking at
foreign people as "exotic," but that impression
changed after she befriended students from all over
the world. As an anthropology major, she has learned
much about other cultures inside the classroom as
well.
Smart people aren't always smart
For Rachel Oliker, some of the most important
lessons she will take from Stanford relate to people.
"Many people I have met here are wrapped up in
their own lives," says Oliker. "I've learned that it's
important not to think your life is so great that it
deserves all of your attention."
Oliker says many of her preconceived notions
about smart people collapsed after some time at
Stanford. "I couldn't believe that smart people could
be good-looking too!" she says, adding that she still
has difficulty with the concept.
Oliker says she also learned that just because
someone is an excellent student does not mean he is
perceptive about matters in real life. "It's important
to judge people by their worthiness as a person, not

by their GPA," explains Oliker. "Nobody has the
right to he cocky, no matter how smart they are,"
says Oliker, who encountered some very hard-nosed
classmates in her premedical classes.
The future has changed
Many students say that their plans for post-col
lege life have changed since freshman year. If you
had asked Scott four years ago what he was going to
do after he graduated from Stanford, he would have
told you he was going to law school. Now, Scott is
applying for a job with rare book dealerships, is con
sidering applying to chefs school and says his fan
tasy job is to run a bookstore/coffee house.
Willburn thought college would give her a clear
sense of what she would do with the rest of her life.
"In a sense, I'm much more confused now," she says.
"I want to go in moderately different directions. I
want to be a lawyer or a teacher — and I might go to
divinity school."
Palmer plans to be an elementary school teacher
— a decision she made sophomore year — and has
been "receiving flack" from students who ask, "Why
are you wasting your Stanford degree on teaching?
You could have gone to Joe Shmoe Jr. College!" How-

expected on the Farm. Feil decided that drinking isn't a sin, and Oliker realized that smart people could
be good-looking.
