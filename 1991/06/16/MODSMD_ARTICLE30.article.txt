# Big fish in a big pond
## 'Typical' seniors reflect on swimming with the extraordinary 
### Connie Chang Editorial staff 
Among the best and the brightest,
you have to be almost blinding to stand
out.
Well, what if you're not?
No one recognizes your name from
the masthead of the school newspaper
anymore. No one goes to every intramu
ral softball game to see you play any
more. And no one seems to care that you
got into Stanford and are graduating —
except your parents, and they don't
really count.
Overachieving high school seniors
who spent four years in the limelight are
thrust into the swarm of the norm when
they arrive as freshmen at Stanford and
realize they won't give the valedictorian
speech at Commencement. Further
more, they'll graduate as relative
unknowns.
This realization is why many stu
dents say Stanford has been "a hum
bling experience" for them.
After all, not receiving a Dean's
Award for Public Service, winning a
Rhodes scholarship or being initiated
into Phi Beta Kappa (What is that, any
way?) can make the typical Stanford
graduate feel, well, quite typical.
So how does being considered aver
age or ordinary at Stanford feel after a
shining high school career?
Senior Shu Lee thinks it feels fine. In
fact, he said not feeling that other peo
ple considered him extraordinary was
one of the reasons he came to Stanford.
Despite protestations from his dorm
mates that he is "a god" and "more spe
cial than the rest," Lee said he is a typi

cal Stanford student because he doesn't
look different or feel different from
most others on campus.
As a resident assistant in Twain, Lee
said he tries to convey that "nothing is
wrong with being typical" to his dorm
mates, particularly freshmen who talk
to him about Stanford being "a hum
bling experience." He said he tells them
"there is no shame in being an average
Stanford student."
But, he added, the phrase, "typical
Stanford student" is oxymoronic
because "they're only typical compared
to everyone else."
Senior Rob Elhardt said Stanford can
be a humbling experience because peo
ple "feel a little less important here . . .
They're not the big fish in the small
pond anymore." He added that not feel
ing important may make some students
"strive less" because they have less
enthusiasm and drive.
Having always thought he was
"slightly above average," Elhardt said
he has worked hard at Stanford only to
do well enough to satisfy his own stan
dards.
Although he doesn't consider himself
a typical Stanford student, Elhardt has
definite ideas about what a typical Stan
ford student is: "They were all stars in
high school, so they all come from the
same sort of mindset where school and
education is very important. They're
involved in lots of activities and every
body works hard to try and get good
grades, but most find out they can't do
as well as before."
He also said most people here are at
least a little athletic and try to live a
healthy lifestyle, adding that "every

body tries to do their own thing and
tries to be an individual."
Elhardt said other people may con
sider him typical because "most people
here consider everyone else typical,
except people who ... get Rhodes schol
arships." But he's not typical, he said,
because he is a transfer student and not
even a typical transfer student at that.
Most transfer students "are enthused
and kick butt over everybody," he said.
Being a transfer student was hard for
Elhardt because he missed out on being
a freshman here, which is part of the
typical Stanford student experience.
Freshman dorms are the "basis for
friendships, even if they are just
acquaintances," he said, adding that he
had to struggle to form relationships
here because he doesn't have the same
foundation.
David Sacks, a third-year senior, said
he "accepted that [he] was not going to
be a straight-A student" early in his
freshman year, adding that he was not
sure that even if he worked as hard as
he possibly could, he would get straight
As.
But he said he doesn't care about get
ting a B+ rather than an A- because he
does not see grades as a reflection of
himself: "If you're studying so hard that
you're hating life, you have to re-evalu
ate what your purpose is," he said.
Hesitant about defining a typical
Stanford student because "they're so
diverse," Sacks said he sees a typical
student as one "who loves it here and
wants to stay as long as possible." Sacks,
though, said he is "not interested in
staying here longer than I need to."

Shu Lee, a resident assistant in Twain, says he tells his tformmates that there is nothing
wrong with being an average Stanford student, as he considers himself. His dorm
mates, however, think Lee is "a god," regardless of what he claims.
