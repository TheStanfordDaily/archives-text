# Four Years in Sports
## Up, up and... down Looking back on 10 NCAA champions, countless great moments and many bitter disappointments 
### Chris Crader Mark Kogowsky Editorial staff 
When the members of the class of 1991
leave campus Sunday, the diploma they
receive will hardly be all they take away
from Stanford. Ten years from now, a
thought may cross from one neuron to
another and into the conscious part of the
brain.
It will be of sport at Stanford, a
remarkable conglomeration of champi
ons, superstars and could-have-beens.
While a comprehensive list would be a
near impossibility, the following trip back
should jog a few memories.
The Cardinal women had no chance.
Playing without their No. 1 singles
player, Tarni Whitlinger, and facing the
mighty Florida Gators in the NCAA final,
the situation seemed hopeless.
Atop the Lady Gators lineup were
Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford — as
dominant a one-two punch as the sport
had seen. Somehow, someway, Lisa
Green and Teri Whitlinger knocked off
Cioffi and Stafford by identical 6-4, 6-2
scores.
That set the stage for Stanford to take
a 4-2 lead into doubles. There Rossides
and Whitlinger — playing together for
the first time ever — crushed Stafford
and Holly Danforth, 6-0, 6-4 to give the
Cardinal its third straight national
crown.
Over the past four years, Stanford
University has captured 10 NCAA team
titles — more than any other school over
that time span. The 1988 women's tennis
title was perhaps the most dramatic, but
the others were all unforgettable in their
own way.
The first of those four years also saw
the Cardinal win championships in men's
tennis and baseball.
At their home-away-from-home in
Athens, Ga., the men's netters held a 4-2
lead over Louisiana State in the final
match when Jeff Tarango and David
Wheaton had a little competition to deter
mine who would pick up match point and
clinch the title for Stanford.
Wheaton came up rock, Tarango scis
sors and on the very next point hit a top
spin backhand return that Jeff Brown
couldn't handle. The Cardinal would go
on to capture the next two NCAA crowns
as well.
Baseball that year — following the
trend of repeat titlists — successfully
defended the national championship it
had won the year before. No big deal, one
might say.
However, the batsmen that year had
struggled. And when Arizona State's

John Finn popped up a Steve Chitren
pitch to first baseman Ron Witmeyer, the
Cardinal had become the first team to
repeat in a decade and a half.
They also, at 46-23, had the dubious
distinction of holding the worst record a
baseball champ had ever boasted of.
The next season, Stanford produced
more of the same — sort of. Both tennis
team again took titles and were joined by
a former champ that had finally rediscov
ered the magic touch.
Under first-year coach Richard Quick,
who had won five consecutive NCAA
championships at Texas before bolting for
the Farm, the women's swim team outdu
eled the Lady Longhorns in Indianapolis.
After stopping out the year before in a
failed effort to make the U.S. Olympic
team, Michelle Griglione won one event
and placed second in two others to lead
the Cardinal to victory.
Dynasty builder Frank Brennan had
assembled what he eventually would call
his "best team ever." Stanford steam
rolled its way through the NCAA tourna
ment, losing just one match while win
ning 22. The championship streak was at
four.
Dick Gould, who has displayed dynas
tic tendencies of his own, made it two in a
row when his men again rose to the occa
sion. A late-season shuffling of the dou
bles teams and an unheralded freshman
named Alex O'Brien (remember this
name) provided the difference as the Car
dinal defeated the Georgia Bulldogs, and
a woofing crown of 5,000, in their home
stadium.
Last season, Stanford athletics made it
three straight years with a troika of titles.
Again, those magnificent netters both
brought home the hardwood. But hard
wood figured into the picture in another
way as well.
Just five short years earlier, women's
basketball at Stanford was, to put it
kindly, a joke. Fewer than 300 fans
attended a typical home game and Maples
was so empty one could fire a cannon in
the building and not hit anyone.
But at the end of that season an up
and-coming coach named Tara Van-
Derveer was whisked away from Ohio
State and brought to Stanford. A half
decade later, she stood on the sideline as
20,000 people at the Thompson-Boling
Arena in Knoxville, Tenn., watched the
Cardinal take on Auburn with a national
championship on the line.
Behind the lights-out shooting of
seniors Katy Steding and Jennifer Azzi,
along with the superb point-guard play of
Sonja Henning and the devastating post
presence of Trisha Stevens, Stanford
gunned down the Lady Tigers 88-81.
For Azzi, whose hometown was just 20
miles awav from the arena, the end

capped a storybook career in which she
and her teammates went from the base
ment to the penthouse.
Hrennan and Co. were at it again with
"the best team ever." The other best team
ever. Freshman named Meredith
McCirath and Heather VVillens joined
established stars Whitlinger, Green, San
dra Birch and Debbie Graham to once
again decimate all comers. The Cardinal
had picked up one for the thumb.
The venue had moved from Athens to
Indian Wells, Calif., but the outcome was
just the same. O'Brien (we told you to
remember) once again starred at NCAAs
— winning all four of his matches for the
second year in a row.
In the finals, Stanford quashed Ten
nessee's M4-match, season-long winning
streak. The clincher was recorded by the
Pacific 10 Conference champion doubles
team of Jason Yee and, of course, O'Brien.
Only once this past season did the Car
dinal taste NCAA glory. Not surprisingly,
the deed was done by women's tennis.
Well, somewhat surprisingly . . .
In a season marred by the most embar
rassing loss in the history of the program
a 6-0 shutout at the hands of Florida
that ended Stanford's unparalleled 76-
match winning streak — the Cardinal
was not the favorite when NCAAs rolled

around.
Attempting to become the first host
squad to capture the title, Stanford eased
into the finals despite an illness to Birch,
the team's No. 1 singles player. There
they squared off with UCLA, which had
shocked the Gators in the semis.
The Cardinal moved ahead of the Bru
ins 4-1 and everyone's attention shifted
to Court 7, Kylie's Korner. On this nor
mally lonely backwater at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, junior Kylie Johnson,
who typically toils in obscurity, suddenly
found 2,000 people watching her play
Cammie Foley.
Johnson's teammates, who were
almost stoic after winning in '89 and '90,
cheered and screamed with every point.
And when Johnson put away a volley win
ner to finally subdue Foley, she was
mobbed by those very teammates, who
celebrated much like they had in 1988.
Six in a row. And counting.
The crowd of 7,500 roared in unison:
"Three . . . two . . . one ..." In a flash,
Todd Lichti dropped the roundball and
leapt into the arms of teammate and close
friend Howard Wright. Thousands
poured onto the court to join in the cele
bration.
Some, mouths still agape, just stared

at the unbelievable scoreboard — Stan
ford 82, Arizona 74. The No. 1-ranked
Wildcats had waltzed into Maples Pavil
ion expecting another easy victory. But
the upstart Cardinal had a different idea.
With the game knotted at 74-74 and
five minutes remaining, the suffocating
Stanford defense shut down the 'Cats for
good. When the clock showed 1:38, center
Greg Butler tipped in a Wright miss to
give the Cardinal a 77-74 lead they
wouldn't relinquish.
Maples rocked all night long and the
Card was indeed No. 1 for a day.
The moments come back time and
again. Many can see Todd and Howard
embracing like it was only yesterday. But
that win was merely the fourth of five
straight that the Cardinal took from the
Wildcats in the friendly confines of
Maples.
And, perhaps more significantly, it was
but a single snapshot in the scrapbook of
unforgettable Stanford sports moments.
Everyone — even those who didn't
make the trip to Berkeley — claims they
were on the field at Memorial Stadium
after John Hopkins kicked the game-win
ning field goal at the 1990 Big Game. The

It was an ending better than the greatest ending to a collegiate football game ever. In Stanford's answer to The Play, John
Hopkins, 94, kicked the game-winning field goal with no time remaining in the 1990 Big Game. Holder Steve Smith, behind
Hopkins, and fullback Tommy Vardell, 44, join in the rejoicing.
