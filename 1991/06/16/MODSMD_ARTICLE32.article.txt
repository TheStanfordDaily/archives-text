# Volpe sidelined on the path to a great football career
## 
### Debbie Spander Senior staff writer 
It looks like the twilight of a
career. Talented running back
never regains pre-injury form and
closes out his career on the side
lines.
It may be only forced retire
ment.
Jon Volpe is not through. Not if
he has any say in the matter.
"I still have it,"he said. "My
speed is definitely where it was;
I'm the strongest I've ever been.
Physically I'm there."
He's just not carrying the ball.
Two seasons ago the 5-foot-7
fullback was the talk of Northern

California, the rising star of the
Pacific 10 Conference. The then
sophomore rushed for 1,027
yards, caught 20 passes and set a
school record of 220 yards on 20
carries against Washington. He
was named first-team All-Pac-10
and was acknowledged as the
future of the Cardinal ground
game.
Last year he played in only two
games after separating first one,
then the other shoulder and tear
ing up his left knee.
Now?
This season the explosive
player sat on the bench, blocked
for other runners and got his
aggressions out on special teams

play. He opened the season as
third string, but moved up to
backup fullback. He chalked up 42
carries in 11 games this year for a
grand total of 148 yards.
Not exactly what Volpe had in
mind for his senior season.
"It's not what I anticipated,"
he said. "During spring ball I felt
the best that I ever had and said,
'This is going to be my year again
this year.' I felt like I'd be All-Pac
-10 and thought I'd be carrying the
ball a good portion of the time.
"I guess the coaches had differ
ent game plans and I guess I
didn't fit in as much as I thought
I might before the season
started."

The situation was all the more
surprising to Volpe considering he
was the number one fullback all
the way through spring practice,
recovery and all.
Practice began with Volpe,
Miami transfer Ellery Roberts
and Tommy Vardell sharing equal
time. After one week Volpe was
elevated to first string and his car
ries reflected his position.
A week later coach Denny
Green took him aside after a
scrimmage and told him how well
he was doing and explained how
the team was planning on using
the short but powerful back in dif
ferent situations.
Green and staff also suggested
that the still-recovering Volpe cut
down his repetitions so as not to
reinjure his knee, considering his
position was all but solidified.
Roberts' and Vardell's scrim
mage time incresed, but Volpe
remained at the top of the depth
chart.
Until the day before the Cardi
nal and White game, that is.
Roberts had been elevated to
starter. Volpe was listed as second
string.
"During spring Jon was play
ing very well but Ellery was play
ing the best of the group," run
ning backs coach Tyrone Willing
ham said.
That's not what Volpe had been
told.
"I was completely shocked," he
said, "especially the way it hap
pened. I was still number one the
whole way through and they pur
posely limited my playing time.
They didn't even tell me. They
just did it all of a sudden."
The shock continued into the
season. In fact, when training
camp opened in August, Volpe was
listed as third string. He had
undergone another knee surgery
four weeks before the start of
camp, but he ranked among the
top three in conditioning tests the
first day of training.
But he didn't move up. His rep
etitions were limited. And at Col
orado, in the season opener, he
watched Roberts and Vardell
struggle against the Buffaloes'
massive front line from the side
lines.
What happened to the poten

tial? The ability? The accolades?
"Coach Willingham plain out
told me that there are two guys
ahead of me who are playing
ahead of me," Volpe said. "Obvi
ously they were playing ahead of
me because they were playing and
1 wasn't. They were getting all the
reps."
"During preseason there is not
a great deal of time to make
changes (in the lineup)," Willing
ham said. "We had a really short
camp before the first game."
But even after the first game,
and the second game, and the
third game, Volpe continued to be
outside the Cardinal's plans.
Roberts was demoted. Vardell
became the starter. And Volpe
remained a special-teams threat.
Why?
"There's no doubt that all of
our running backs are talented,"
Volpe said. "Everyone could start
for a lot of teams in the Pac-10.
That's hard. Tommy does certain
things he's good at — short
vardage. Ellery has his qualities,
and I have mine too — the quick
traps and draw plays."
"It's all how you look at things
— you don't see a true starter,"
Willingham said. "You see Tommy
in one series and Jon in the next
series. We rotate. On paper there's
one starter for a ballgame and
that's Tommy, but in actually all
are like starters because they're
all good players."
Stanford may use a rotational
system but Volpe continued to
touch the ball infrequently.
Wheareas he averaged 20 carries a
game two seasons ago, the fifth
year player has run with the ball
fewer than four times a game this
year. His high was nine, in the
eighth week of the season against
Oregon.
One of the problems was Stan
ford's lack of a ground game.
Despite the presence of a number
of fabulously talented backs, the
Cardinal spent much of the season
trying to get its running attack
going. Added to the fact that the
team frequently fell behind early,
Stanford has been relying on the
pass to keep in many games.
If you don't run the ball, no one
gets any carries.
"Unfortunately our offense has

not had the productivity that we'd
like to have so his numbers as far
as rushing the football have not
been there, but he's doing a good
job,' Green said. "When he is run
ning the ball he's running hard,
and he's been blocking. If we
could ever hold up defensively and
keep the games in that position
the first half, I think the second
half we could start running the
ball pretty well."
Rut despite the situation, Volpe
kept his head up and tried to make
the best of the opportunities he
was given. If he only got two runs,
they'd be of the same quality as if
they were two of 15 or 20 carries.
He was still going to surprise
defensive linemen when he
blocked; he was still going to give
his all on special-teams play.
Limited playing time didn't
have to equal limited quality. Or
desire.
"I haven't let the depth chart
affect my play," Volpe said. "It's
discouraging, but the times when
I do get in I run the ball well and
block well. I've kept pounding
away all season."
But that didn't make it easy.
"It's hard," he said. "It's like a
time bomb ready to explode, but
someone put a lid on you and you
can't do anything about it. The
coaches are going to play who they
think is best, and you have to sit
and wait.
"Mentally it's hard. You have
the coaches doubting you and
some concern in your own mind.
But I can't believe it. Just given
the opportunity I know I can do
the things I did my sophomore
season."
"There's no doubt that it's dif
ficult for Jon," Green said, "He's a
man and he knows that football's
a tough game. It's been disap
pointing because he hasn't had
the kind of carries that he'd like to
have.
"But Jon is handling it well and
he's continued to work hard.
There's nothing easy about
sports. Football's a really tough
game; it's a gut check every single
day. You just have to go out and
play and try to put the best 11
players on the field."

After rushing for over 1,000 yards as a sophomore, Jon Volpe was being compared to Darrln Nelson. But
Injuries devastated his Junior year and Volpe found himself spending his senior season as a thlrd-strinq
back.
Despite his lack of carries and
his lack of exposure, Volpe is still
aiming to make the NFL. Even if
his collegiate coaches didn't use
him, Volpe knows he has what it
takes. He didn't get drafted,
which makes sense as he hasn't
had anything for scouts to see for
two years, but the industrial engi
neering graduate still has plans to
try out for a team that needs a
runner.
Neither his size nor his meager
statistics dampen his outlook.
"Anybody who's proven himself

in the past, who can run in the
4.4'5, and who has strength will
likely get a shot in the NFL,"
Volpe said.
"1 think there's a strong posi
bility Jon can make the pros,"
Willingham said. "He plays a lot
bigger than his size. He doesn't
play like he's 5-8. His quickness
and strength really are big When
you factor in his mental tough
ness, his attitude and his ability to
play to win, he has the qualities it
takes."
Stanford just didn't think so
this season.

Jon Volpe has signed to play with
the British Columbia Lions of the
Canadian Football League.
