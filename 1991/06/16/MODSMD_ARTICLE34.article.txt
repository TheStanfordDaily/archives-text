# Rewriting the record books
## Sandra Birch and Teri Whitlinger have each earned a permanent place in Stanford tennis history 
### Mark Kogowsky Senior staff writer 
It's 9 o'clock on a Thursday
night at a carrel in Meyer Library.
Sitting there with stacks of books
and notes is Sandra Birch, the
1989 and 1991 NCAA singles
champion. There's an econ
midterm tomorrow morning and
Birch intends to be ready. . . .
It's 9 o'clock on a Thursday
night at a suite in Jenkins.
Standing there surrounded by a
room full of people is Teri
Whitlinger, the 1990 NCAA dou
bles champion. There's a party
tonight and Whitlinger intends to
enjoy it while it lasts. . . .
That is how they are known:
Birch the student, Whit
linger the socialite. But it
really isn't so simple. On a given
night, the roles could easily be
reversed. Whitlinger, too, is an
economics major who takes school
seriously. And Birch's astronomi
cal grade point average did not
come at the expense of spending
time with friends.
But it is when Birch and
Whitlinger are on the court that
their most common denominator
becomes apparent. Both win early,
often and easily and, after they

ended their collegiate careers at
last month's NCAA Champi
onships, both will leave here with
their respective places in history
very much secured.
They have been key contribu
tors to four straight national
crown winners and are perma
nently enshrined in the Ralph
Rodriguez clubhouse at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium after captur
ing their individual titles.
It's true that their personali
ties are very different. Birch has
had to learn to live for the
moment, to avoid looking back at
the past and ahead to the future.
She is constantly striving to find a
balance. "It's been like a roller
coaster ride. . . . Not just the ten
nis — everything. I've never
really found an even keel here,"
she says. "There's always been a
lot of stress, . . . pressure. I put
most of that on myself."
But the results speak for them
selves. She has anchored the Stan
ford lineup from the top for two
straight seasons and is an aca
demic Ail-American. Those look
ing for ideal student-athletes in
the increasingly corrupt and sor
did world of college sports need
look no further than Sandra
Birch.
Whitlinger, by contrast, has

mastered life in the present. She
asks herself "What if?" from time
to time, but is always comfortable
with what actually was. "Once in
a while, I wish I would've given
more to my tennis, but then I
would've missed out fon other
things)," she says."I think I did it
all."
She's right, of course. Like
Birch, Whitlinger will graduate,
on schedule, as a four-time Ail-
American. Her spot in the lineup
moved from No. 3 as a freshman
to No. 5 as a sophomore. Each of
the past two seasons, she's
stepped up one notch to return to
her original position.
It's not that Whitlinger hasn't
improved, it's that her teammates
have been so good. One could
make a strong case that she was
the best four-year player ever who
never played No. 1.
"My goal was one of my four
years to be able to play No. 1,"
Whitlinger says. "But considering
the people who played ahead of
me, I don't feel so bad."
Birch would never had lasted
this long were it not for her rise to
the No. 1 singles position. In her
first season, she actually played
behind Whitlinger as the pres
sures of adjusting to college
affected her game. The next sea
son, she moved to No. 2, but
remained unsatisfied.
Playing first singles for Stan
ford was a mission for Sandra
Birch. The way she accomplished
it was quite simple. First, Teri
Whitlinger's twin sister Tami, who
played ahead of Birch, turned pro
fessional. Then, Birch went out
and won the NCAA singles crown
as a sophomore. When she re
turned for her junior season, a
freshman by the name of Meredith
McGrath pushed Birch for No. 1.
But Birch survived the test and
has been atop the lineup ever
since. McGrath, who has since
moved on to the pro circuit, would
actually end up playing a bigger
role in Teri Whitlinger's career
than in Birch's.
When Tami left school, she
broke up the age-old doubles team
of Whitlinger and Whitlinger.
McGrath became Teri's new part
ner and together they would form
one of the best college doubles
teams of all time. But Whitlinger
credits McGrath with much more
than serving as a doubles team
mate.
Tami and Teri were oil and
water on the court. Though Tami
has always been the better singles
player, Teri was stronger in dou
bles. That didn't stop Tami from
screaming at Teri when things
weren't going well. If Tami was
Night for Teri, McGrath served as
Day.
"Playing with her was probably
the best experience of my life,"
she says."I learned a lot from
Meredith. She has a very confi
dent outlook. That's what you
need to be a great tennis player.
She's a cocky type and that atti
tude rubbed off on me."
If only Birch could have such
self-esteem. A shot-maker extra
ordinaire, Birch's game is a little
Steffi Graf, a little Martina
Navratilova. But sometimes she's
content to sit back and outlast her
opposition. Coach Frank Brennan
explains it this way:

"People walk onto the court
thinking, 'I can beat Birch.' But
after a half hour of playing Sandra
you're down two-love and your
brain has turned to tapioca." She
can "do whatever you can't do,"
he explains.
At times, what she needs to do
is attack relentlessly. She can play
the net, but often sits back on the
baseline. She has worked for a
couple of years to perfect her top
spin backhand, yet will rarely hit
anything but a slice in a match.
One memory stands out
above the rest for Birch and
Whitlinger: the 1988
national Championhsips when the
Cardinal defeated top-ranked
Florida despite playing without its
No. 1 player, Tami Whitlinger,
who was injured at the time.
"I think I'll never forget my
freshman year when we won
NCAAs," Whitlinger says."It was
all new and we had no business
winning with the lineup we had at
the time. To me, that's what being
a part of a team is all about."
Says Birch: "I was thrilled at
how the team got together. . . . We
did become very close. We were
definite underdogs. It was just
awesome; I've never experienced
such a team spirit feeling."
They could both appreciate the
rare moment when tennis — an
inherently individual sport —
became something that could be
shared. Both cited this season's
loss to the Gators as having a sim
ilar bonding effect.
But their greatness will be
remembered as a result of the
individual achievements. Whit
linger's dual-match record over
the past four years is a remark
able 101-6. While no one seems to
be sure about these things, it is
believed the win total is the high
est attained at Stanford.
Birch has won 77 times in team
competition while losing just 15.
In addition to her NCAA singles
crowns, she has captured two
Pacific 10 Conference titles and
has won the Riviera All-American

to my tennis, but then I would've missed out
[on other things]. I think I did it all.'

tournament the past two seasons.
Brennan has particularly fond
memories of the first NCAA tri
umph. "I remember her winning
the NCAAs and being very emo
tional during the match. She
always sort of prided herself on
being Borg-like," he says, likening
her to the silent Swede, Bjorn
Borg, who recently began a come
back effort.
"She was very pumped up emo
tionally. It was quite a thing to see
how she was jumping up and
down, pumping her fist." It was
the kind of expressiveness one
might expect from, say, Whit
linger.
While Whitlinger has won sin
gles events, doubles is clearly her
claim to fame. In that fondly
remembered '88 final, Brennan
paired her with Eleni Rossides at
the last minute, figuring they
might make a good team. There it
was, in a national-championship
match, the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association and NCAA
Coach of the Decade, sent out a
doubles team who had never so
much as practiced together. And it
worked, thanks in no small part to
Whitlinger.
"Teri just said, 'We're going to
be the greatest of all time,' " Bren
nan recalls, remarking about how
unfazed she was by the sudden
switch. Sure enough, Rossides
and Whitlinger won 16 of the first
17 points and scored the clinching
point to give Stanford the title.
Last season, when Whitlinger's
individual doubles title was on the
line, she got tense — like Birch
might. She and McGrath had been
so untouchable all season but
found themselves trailing Birch
and Debbie Graham by a set. It
looked like the superteam would
lose. But that would ruin the

story.
"Meredith and I were a little
nervous after being undefeated
the whole year," Whitlinger would
say after they had come back to
take the title.
Said McGrath at the time:
"Why have one loss . .
. . where it erases our whole
dominant season," Whitlinger
quipped.
It was vintage Teri Whitlinger,
not arrogant but confident.
Sandra Birch is learning to
stop and smell the flowers
now and again. She can now
recognize when she reverts to the
"old ways" and is relaxing more.
Over spring break, she decided to
take a trip with her mother and
put down the racket for a while.
"Oh gosh, I'm not going to be
playing for a few days," a younger
Sandra Birch might have thought
to herself. But the new, improved
model can handle these things
better.
One of the reasons for the
transformation is because she has
learned so much from Teri
Whitlinger, who has always done
it that way.
"We're pretty much very oppo
site in our lifestyles. I kind of live
vicariously though her, she kind of
lives vicariously through me.
She's a very special person in my
life. I sometimes wish I could be as
disciplined as she is," Teri
Whitlinger says of Sandra Birch.
And Sandra Birch sometimes
wishes she could just kick back for
a while. Like Teri Whitlinger.

Sandra Birch will make her pro
fessional tennis debut at a satel
lite event in Evansville, Ind. Teri
Whitlinger will play Team Tennis
in Sacramento this summer.

In the history of NCAA women's tennis, it can be argued that no one
was as successful as Sandra Birch. She led her team to NCAA team
championships in each of her four years, won two NCAA singles
titles and played in two NCAA doubles championship matches. She
also graduates with a 3.8 GPA.

All athletes go to college dreaming of winning an NCAA title. One wasn't enough for Teri Whitlinger,
however, as she led Stanford to four NCAA team titles and won an NCAA doubles crown on the side.
