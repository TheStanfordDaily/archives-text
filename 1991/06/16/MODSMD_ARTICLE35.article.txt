# Dunkin' Deshon took flight with all-around contribution

The play starts innocently enough, as
point guard John Patrick dribbles the
ball past midcourt. Right before Patrick
reaches the top of the key, Andrew Vlahov
flashes from the paint, comes out to the
right wing and takes a short pass. Just
another play.
A slight rumbling comes from the
crowd, though, us a few fans realize
what's about to happen. While they've
been watching Patrick, Deshon Wingate
has waited, patiently, on the left side of
the floor. Now, as the ball goes from

Patrick to Vlahov, center Adam Keefe
conies screaming from the low post to lay
a hellacious pick on the defender guard
ing Wingate. A few more fans start to
realize what's up.
Wingate's defender is toast. Vlahov
turns, knows that Keefe's pick is perfect,
and fires what looks like a shot from
beyond the three-point line. Wingate, all
alone now, takes three steps toward the
hoop and vaults into the stratosphere.
"Hey, was that a shot or. ..."
The ball heads for the hoop, a pair of
outstretched arms fly into the picture . . .
and suddenly the rock is on its way down.
Pandemonium.

The Lob, unfortunately, took much of
the latter part of the season off.
Vlahov watched the last 11 regular
season games from the sidelines due to an
ankle injury, and that means that during
those games the air mail wasn't delivered
on time. But Vlahov returned for the
postseason and the rest was history.
"Andrew was so accustomed to just
turning and throwing every night,"
Wingate said, "whereas these new guys at
that position aren't accustomed to it."
Vlahov was used to it because he and
Wingate had run the Lob for almost two
whole seasons. During Vlahov's injury,
however, and during the drive to the

National Invitation Tournament champi
onship, the rest of the team had to turn
its play up a notch â€” including Wingate.
"I'm definitely trying to be more
involved, (but) whether or not that shows
up in the stats is kind of hard to say,"
Wingate said at the time. "I think that
I'm one of the key pieces in the game in
terms of leadership and calming my team
mates down, making sure they run the
right plays. I get on them about defense, I
bring the huddle together, and try to give
them confidence.
"I'm definitely trying to pick us up in
more than one or two ways: I try to give
(Jim) Morgan a little more confidence in

his shot, so I pass him the ball a little bit,
(and) Keefe and I are doing pretty well
with passing the ball and passing right
back, that sort of thing."
Wingate picked the team up more than
a little the week after Vlahov went out:
Playing against Oregon, he scored a
career-high 23 points and added a career
high 14 rebounds. During Vlahov's
absence, and especially in the postseason,
Wingate was putting up the best numbers
of his career.
Even with all the little things and the
occasional scoring spurts, though, it's
