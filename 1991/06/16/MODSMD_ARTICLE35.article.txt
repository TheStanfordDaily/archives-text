# Dunkin' Deshon took flight with all-around contribution
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
The play starts innocently enough, as
point guard John Patrick dribbles the
ball past midcourt. Right before Patrick
reaches the top of the key, Andrew Vlahov
flashes from the paint, comes out to the
right wing and takes a short pass. Just
another play.
A slight rumbling comes from the
crowd, though, us a few fans realize
what's about to happen. While they've
been watching Patrick, Deshon Wingate
has waited, patiently, on the left side of
the floor. Now, as the ball goes from

Patrick to Vlahov, center Adam Keefe
conies screaming from the low post to lay
a hellacious pick on the defender guard
ing Wingate. A few more fans start to
realize what's up.
Wingate's defender is toast. Vlahov
turns, knows that Keefe's pick is perfect,
and fires what looks like a shot from
beyond the three-point line. Wingate, all
alone now, takes three steps toward the
hoop and vaults into the stratosphere.
"Hey, was that a shot or. ..."
The ball heads for the hoop, a pair of
outstretched arms fly into the picture . . .
and suddenly the rock is on its way down.
Pandemonium.

The Lob, unfortunately, took much of
the latter part of the season off.
Vlahov watched the last 11 regular
season games from the sidelines due to an
ankle injury, and that means that during
those games the air mail wasn't delivered
on time. But Vlahov returned for the
postseason and the rest was history.
"Andrew was so accustomed to just
turning and throwing every night,"
Wingate said, "whereas these new guys at
that position aren't accustomed to it."
Vlahov was used to it because he and
Wingate had run the Lob for almost two
whole seasons. During Vlahov's injury,
however, and during the drive to the

National Invitation Tournament champi
onship, the rest of the team had to turn
its play up a notch — including Wingate.
"I'm definitely trying to be more
involved, (but) whether or not that shows
up in the stats is kind of hard to say,"
Wingate said at the time. "I think that
I'm one of the key pieces in the game in
terms of leadership and calming my team
mates down, making sure they run the
right plays. I get on them about defense, I
bring the huddle together, and try to give
them confidence.
"I'm definitely trying to pick us up in
more than one or two ways: I try to give
(Jim) Morgan a little more confidence in

his shot, so I pass him the ball a little bit,
(and) Keefe and I are doing pretty well
with passing the ball and passing right
back, that sort of thing."
Wingate picked the team up more than
a little the week after Vlahov went out:
Playing against Oregon, he scored a
career-high 23 points and added a career
high 14 rebounds. During Vlahov's
absence, and especially in the postseason,
Wingate was putting up the best numbers
of his career.
Even with all the little things and the
occasional scoring spurts, though, it's
still the dunks — off drives, off
rebounds or off The Lob — that
get the fifth-year senior noticed.
Everyone who wants to talk sky
walking talks to Wingate.
Well, almost everyone. "Did
Deshon tell you that he goes to
bed at night and dreams of my
athletic ability?" interrupts
Keefe, who for some reason has
never been nominated for Leaper
of the Year.
"Adam, did you get paid to say
that?" Wingate asks.
"He dreams of being able to
jump like me," Keefe deadpans.

Dubious. At best.
Wingate seems to be getting
along just fine with his own abil
ity, thank you. "1 do like doing
spectacular things," he says, "but
1 also enjoy taking charges — well,
I don't really enjoy them, but I
don't mind doing it — taking
charges, getting after loose balls,
something like that, or playing
good defense. I really feel good
when my man doesn't score."
Still, it isn't defense that got
Freaky 1) his cherished nickname
— it was his penchant, every now
and then, to pull off something
ridiculously spectacular. Well,
actually, that's the /or-the-record
explanation. Off the record?
"I don't know if I can tell you,"
Wingate says, mock-seriously. "It

tnight be too scandalous." (Look,
if you really want to know, ask
him yourself.)
Anyway, what's that for-the
record story behind the name?
"My freshman year after practice
we were having a mini-dunk con
test," says Wingate. "I was doing
some dunks that I guess were
pretty amazing, and I think it was
(then-guard) Oliver Cunningham
that coined the phrase Freaky D."
Whatever. The name stuck —
"It's a nickname I like," he says.
"All my friends call me Freaky" —
and, as the seasons went by, the
dunks multiplied and the jaws
continued to drop.
"I wish I had his jumping abil
ity," Keefe says. "That's some
thing that would put my game on
a completely different level, as far
as playing above the rim."
Keefe's current level would
probably be fine for just about
anyone else — after all, he's a
two-time all-conference choice
and was the MVP of the NIT. Still,
though, he probably wouldn't
mind being able to jump through
the roof every now and then.
So, Deshon, how high can you
jump?
"I don't really know," Wingate
says."I think [my vertical's]
about 30 or 31 inches."
Let's see . . . 6-foot-7 plus
about two and a half feet for the
arm — oh heck, let's say almost
three feet (the Wingate Wingspan
is longer than the average bear's)
— equals nine feet, seven inches,
plus 30 inches, which gets us to . .
. about 12 feet.
Hold up. Only 12 feet? How
high can you get up on the back
board?
A smile. "Well. . . ."
"We don't know," Keefe inter
rupts again. "It only goes up to 15
feet."
A sage nod. "That's true. That
is true," Wingate says."It only
goes up to 15 feet."
Cut the clowning. How high?
"I'm sure I can get the top of
the square," Wingate says.
(Rumor has it Wingate's elbows
have hit the top of the square.) "1
can get up there pretty high."
All right. Fine. We'll settle for
"pretty high."
And yet . . . "Last year against
Washington," Keefe says,
"[Wingate! took a lob pass and
dunked over Dion Brown, who's
one of the best leapers in the Pac
-10." Brown is only 6-5, but he
spends most games floating over
the rim.
"Things just kind of run
together," Keefe says."I just
think of the 360-degree dunks he
does whenever he feels like it."
"I do like doing spectacular
things," Wingate says."I like to
dunk, I like to dunk on people, I
like to drive and dunk . . . espe
cially with people in my face."
Still, it's the other things that
Wingate does — defense, settling
others down, hitting the medium
range jumper — that help the
team the most. And, as the Cardi
nal to adjust to its new cast,
Freaky D may have had to sacri
fice a few spectacular dunks to
concentrate on other duties —
which is just fine with him.
"I think we are becoming more
comfortable with one another,"
Wingate says. "There's so many
people being used now it's more of
a team effort than not."

Deshon Wingate is readying him
self for professional tryouts in an
effort to achieve his goal of play
ing in the NBA.

When people think of Deshon Wingate, they often think of high
flyin', double-clutchin', in-your-face jams. But the senior forward did
a lot of other things for the Cardinal this year, helping the team to its
second-ever postseason title.
