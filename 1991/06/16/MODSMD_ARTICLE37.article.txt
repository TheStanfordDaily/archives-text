# She pointed the way
## Sonja Henning, a.k.a. 'The Glue,' hangs 'em up 
### David Hirning Senior staff writer 
The word was out in early
March. The Stanford community
would have one final chance to
catch the biggest hit of the season,
a show that drew rave reviews in
city after city up and down the
West Coast. "Mark it on your cal
endar," people were told, "March
16, Maples Pavilion."
The message was clear: Be sure
you don't miss the encore perfor
mance of The Sonja Henning
Farewell Tribute Tour.
On that date Henning brought
her talents to Maples one final
time for a second-round NCAA
tournament game. For Stanford
fans, it was a tearful goodbye. But
for the rest of the league, and the
country, it was more of a great
relief.
Four years of Sonja is enough
for anyone on the other side of the
ball. Toward the end of this sea
son, it almost became a cliche.
Stanford wins, and after the game
the opposing coach and players sit
in the interview room and babble,
"Sonja, Sonja. ..." A few samples:
Harold Rhodes, Washington
State: "I think the difference was
that we didn't have anyone that
could stop Sonja Henning."
Marianne Stanley, after the
Cardinal beat her USC squad: "I
thought that Tammy Story (her
point guard) did a great job
against Henning, who I believe is
the best point guard in the coun
try."
Gooch Foster, California: "In
my estimation, Sonja Henning is
the best point guard in the coun
try. When you're playing against
Sonja, you have to do everything
right."
The coach you see fighting back
tears in the corner is not an oppo
nent but the Cardinal's own Tara
VanDerveer, who will lose perhaps
the best point guard in Stanford
history this year. "I don't like to
think about Sonja and Trisha
(Stevens) graduating, unless I
want to put myself in pain," Van-
Derveer said in March.
When she wasn't in agony, Van-
Derveer was busy stumping for
Henning to be Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Year. The senior
co-captain from Racine, Wis.
eventually went on to win the
award. And the team's video pro
moting her for All-America hon
ors also didn't go to waste as
Kodak selected her as one of the
nation's 10 best.
The signs were everywhere . . .
literally. It was Henning that the
Athletic Department chose as its
cover girl for the Stanford basket
ball billboard on El Camino Real.
She was in demand for auto
graphs after every game. Call her
the spark, the glue, the key . . .
just be sure to call on her when
the game's on the line.
After Henning pulled victory
from the jaws of defeat in a late
season game at California, scoring
18 points and dishing out a con
ference-record 15 assists, Van-
Derveer distilled all the lofty
praise into this simple statement:
"Sonja is the reason our team is
winning. She's carrying this team
on her 5-foot-7 frame."
Henning is Stanford women's
basketball. "She walked on the
court freshman year and became
the starting point guard," Van-
Derveer says, and she has pro
vided a consistency at the position
that is usually only found in the
NBA ranks. This year, Henning
started every game and averaged
36 minutes a contest.
Henning is the epitome of a
"Most Valuable Player" (and,
indeed, has been the Cardinal's
MVP every year the award has
been given during her tenure),
doingjust about everything on the
court: she runs the offense,
orchestrates the fast break,
passes, scores, defends, rebounds.
Rebounds? At 5-7? Don't ask
how, but the senior averaged
nearly six boards a game, third on
the team behind a pair of 6-3 for

wards (Val Whiting and Julie Zei»-
stra) who are supposed to
rebound. But Henning does it,
just as she does everything else:
seemingly without effort.
This is not always to her advan
tage, and VanDerveer thinks it
may be one reason why Henning
has not received the recognition
she deserved before this year.
"Sonja is so smooth out there on
the court that you don't notice
everything she does. She'll get 22
points, and I won't know where
they came from."
Another explanation for past
neglect could have been Hen
ning's scoring. After averaging
10.8 points per game her fresh
man year, Henning's numbers
actually dropped in the following
two seasons, to 10.1 and then to
an 8.8 average last season. After
gathering preseason All-America
honors before her sophomore
year, Henning was virtually
ignored at the national level last
season.
Of course, Henning was sur
rounded by four pretty decent
scorers last year, including
National Player of the Year Jen
nifer Azzi. It's sometimes hard to
shine playing in the same back
court as the brightest star in the
women's game, llenning averaged
nearly seven assists a game last
year dishing to stars Azzi, Katy
Steding, Stevens and Zeilstra.
Oh, ves, Henning also led her
team to a 32-1 season last year
and its first-ever NCAA title. She
was one of only three juniors on
the U.S. National Team the fol
lowing summer. So she must be
doing something right.
This year, Henning turned up
her scoring, but not to garner any
more awards. It was simply that
for the young squad to be success
ful, Henning needed to contribute
more points.
"I'm in a different role this
year," Henning said during the
season. "We've always had
Jennifer and Katy — great outside
shooters — and I didn't need to

Sonja Henning is the
best point guard in
the country.'

shoot. This year, I have to look to
score more."
And just like that, she did:
Henning was second on the team
in scoring this year with a 15.7
average, good enough to be in the
top 10 in the Pac-10.
It could be said that Henning
was not known for her shot when
she came to Stanford, but count
less hours outside practice shoot
ing with Azzi and Steding has paid
off. This year, Henning had a .455
percentage from the field and led
the team's primary outside
threats with 38 percent average
from three-point range.
But setting up her teammates
was still what Henning excelled
at, and she was tops in the Pac-10
in assists at 7.4 per game. "When
you think about what makes a
great player, it's making everyone
else you play with look better,"
VanDerveer said. "Sonja brings
out the best in other people on our
team."
Zeilstra, who scored 20 points a
game this year partly because
Henning got her the ball, testifies,
"Sonja is just an amazing passer. I
don't know what else to say."
Says forward Chris MacMurdo,
"I think we're all getting a little
spoiled playing with Sonja,
because she's so good. When
you're out on the court, you don't
have to think, because she does
the thinking for you. Things just
run smoothly when she's out
there."

Sonja Henning will try to make
the U.S. National Team this sum
mer — again. Last year, she
helped the squad win gold medals
at the World Championships and
Goodwill Games. This year, she
hopes to bring her talents to the
Pan-American Games in Havana,
Cuba.

While she didn't always get the publicity some of her teammates

the team to a pair of final fours and two additional NCAA regional

While she didn't always get the publicity some of her teammates
received, Sonja Henning has always been the leader of the Cardinal
women's basketball team. The four-year starter at point guard led
the team to a pair of final fours and two additional NCAA regional
apperances.
The word was out in early
March. The Stanford community
would have one final chance to
catch the biggest hit of the season,
a show that drew rave reviews in
city after city up and down the
West Coast. "Mark it on your cal
endar," people were told, "March
16, Maples Pavilion."
The message was clear: Be sure
you don't miss the encore perfor
mance of The Sonja Henning
Farewell Tribute Tour.
On that date Henning brought
her talents to Maples one final
time for a second-round NCAA
tournament game. For Stanford
fans, it was a tearful goodbye. But
for the rest of the league, and the
country, it was more of a great
relief.
Four years of Sonja is enough
for anyone on the other side of the
ball. Toward the end of this sea
son, it almost became a cliche.
Stanford wins, and after the game
the opposing coach and players sit
in the interview room and babble,
"Sonja, Sonja. ..." A few samples:
Harold Rhodes, Washington
State: "I think the difference was
that we didn't have anyone that
could stop Sonja Henning."
Marianne Stanley, after the
Cardinal beat her USC squad: "I
thought that Tammy Story (her
point guard) did a great job
against Henning, who I believe is
the best point guard in the coun
try."
Gooch Foster, California: "In
my estimation, Sonja Henning is
the best point guard in the coun
try. When you're playing against
Sonja, you have to do everything
right."
The coach you see fighting back
tears in the corner is not an oppo
nent but the Cardinal's own Tara
VanDerveer, who will lose perhaps
the best point guard in Stanford
history this year. "I don't like to
think about Sonja and Trisha
(Stevens) graduating, unless I
want to put myself in pain," Van-
Derveer said in March.
When she wasn't in agony, Van-
Derveer was busy stumping for
Henning to be Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Year. The senior
co-captain from Racine, Wis.
eventually went on to win the
award. And the team's video pro
moting her for All-America hon
ors also didn't go to waste as
Kodak selected her as one of the
nation's 10 best.
The signs were everywhere . . .
literally. It was Henning that the
Athletic Department chose as its
cover girl for the Stanford basket
ball billboard on El Camino Real.
She was in demand for auto
graphs after every game. Call her
the spark, the glue, the key . . .
just be sure to call on her when
the game's on the line.
After Henning pulled victory
from the jaws of defeat in a late
season game at California, scoring
18 points and dishing out a con
ference-record 15 assists, Van-
Derveer distilled all the lofty
praise into this simple statement:
"Sonja is the reason our team is
winning. She's carrying this team
on her 5-foot-7 frame."
Henning is Stanford women's
basketball. "She walked on the
court freshman year and became
the starting point guard," Van-
Derveer says, and she has pro
vided a consistency at the position
that is usually only found in the
NBA ranks. This year, Henning
started every game and averaged
36 minutes a contest.
Henning is the epitome of a
"Most Valuable Player" (and,
indeed, has been the Cardinal's
MVP every year the award has
been given during her tenure),
doingjust about everything on the
court: she runs the offense,
orchestrates the fast break,
passes, scores, defends, rebounds.
Rebounds? At 5-7? Don't ask
how, but the senior averaged
nearly six boards a game, third on
the team behind a pair of 6-3 for

wards (Val Whiting and Julie Zei»-
stra) who are supposed to
rebound. But Henning does it,
just as she does everything else:
seemingly without effort.
This is not always to her advan
tage, and VanDerveer thinks it
may be one reason why Henning
has not received the recognition
she deserved before this year.
"Sonja is so smooth out there on
the court that you don't notice
everything she does. She'll get 22
points, and I won't know where
they came from."
Another explanation for past
neglect could have been Hen
ning's scoring. After averaging
10.8 points per game her fresh
man year, Henning's numbers
actually dropped in the following
two seasons, to 10.1 and then to
an 8.8 average last season. After
gathering preseason All-America
honors before her sophomore
year, Henning was virtually
ignored at the national level last
season.
Of course, Henning was sur
rounded by four pretty decent
scorers last year, including
National Player of the Year Jen
nifer Azzi. It's sometimes hard to
shine playing in the same back
court as the brightest star in the
women's game, llenning averaged
nearly seven assists a game last
year dishing to stars Azzi, Katy
Steding, Stevens and Zeilstra.
Oh, ves, Henning also led her
team to a 32-1 season last year
and its first-ever NCAA title. She
was one of only three juniors on
the U.S. National Team the fol
lowing summer. So she must be
doing something right.
This year, Henning turned up
her scoring, but not to garner any
more awards. It was simply that
for the young squad to be success
ful, Henning needed to contribute
more points.
"I'm in a different role this
year," Henning said during the
season. "We've always had
Jennifer and Katy — great outside
shooters — and I didn't need to

Sonja Henning is the
best point guard in
the country.'

shoot. This year, I have to look to
score more."
And just like that, she did:
Henning was second on the team
in scoring this year with a 15.7
average, good enough to be in the
top 10 in the Pac-10.
It could be said that Henning
was not known for her shot when
she came to Stanford, but count
less hours outside practice shoot
ing with Azzi and Steding has paid
off. This year, Henning had a .455
percentage from the field and led
the team's primary outside
threats with 38 percent average
from three-point range.
But setting up her teammates
was still what Henning excelled
at, and she was tops in the Pac-10
in assists at 7.4 per game. "When
you think about what makes a
great player, it's making everyone
else you play with look better,"
VanDerveer said. "Sonja brings
out the best in other people on our
team."
Zeilstra, who scored 20 points a
game this year partly because
Henning got her the ball, testifies,
"Sonja is just an amazing passer. I
don't know what else to say."
Says forward Chris MacMurdo,
"I think we're all getting a little
spoiled playing with Sonja,
because she's so good. When
you're out on the court, you don't
have to think, because she does
the thinking for you. Things just
run smoothly when she's out
there."

Sonja Henning will try to make
