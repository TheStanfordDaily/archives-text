# Feels like I got here yesterday
## 
### 
It seems like only yesterday
that I packed up all of my
belongings, gave Dad a sturdy
handshake, kissed Mom goodbye
and stepped on an airplane des
tined for sunny California.
Leaving my home in Allen
town, Pa. (yes, the same town as
in the Billy Joel song), elicited sev
eral emotions. I was extremely
excited to have the opportunity to
play Division I football, to make
new friends and to experience the
freedom associated with college.
But I was also sad to leave my
family and friends, people with
whom I've shared so many happy
moments.
That sadness was eased practi
cally the moment I got here. I was
welcomed heartily and made to
feel that I would soon have new
friends to share happy times. And
I did.
Not that I forgot my old ties; I
didn't. Happily, I managed to keep
in touch with my family and most
of my friends back home while
making lifelong friends here on
the Farm.
From the beginning of my
freshman year to the present, I've
continually received the help, care
and support from friends, coaches
and faculty members (the latter
two groups are often one in the

same) that I've needed to survive
in a world of competitive aca
demics and top-notch athletics.
The friends I've made here and
the memories I have of Stanford
will remain close to my heart for
ever. I may be living in New York
and playing for the Giants after
graduation, but a part of me will
always reside in sunny Palo Alto,
Calif.
Thanks to everyone who helped
me establish a home-away-from
home and God bless all of you who
made the last five years some of
the happiest years of my life. Good
luck.
Go Cardinal!
