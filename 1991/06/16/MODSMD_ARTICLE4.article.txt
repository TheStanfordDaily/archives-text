# Fewer jobs for graduates mean more will stick around
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
After a stint at a Swiss bank
and four years packed with prob
lem sets and computer programs,
senior Chris Williges envisioned a
cushy job at a brokerage house
and a handsome salary to match.
Now, with graduation just days
away, and 30 job interviews
behind him, the quantitative eco
nomics major has found work that
won't involve stocks and bonds
but pots and pans instead.

Career centers at numerous colleges and uni
versities are feeling the ripple effects of job
eliminations. Stanford's Career Planning and
Placement Center reported that of the 1,558
companies scheduled to visit this year, 552,
or 35 percent, canceled, an increase from the
previous year's 32 percent.

"I'm going to work this sum
mer with Stanford Food Service
but I will keep up the job search
on the side," Williges said. "All the
firms that I interviewed with told
me, 'We'd love to hire you if we
could, but we just aren't hiring
anybody.'"
His lament is echoed by stu
dents at Stanford and many of the
estimated one million students
nationwide who will be granted
bachelor's degrees this spring.
Graduating seniors of all
majors, from engineering to eco
nomics, English to biology, are dis
covering that good grades may not
be enough for a good job this year.
With companies forced to slash
expenses, cut personnel and
freeze hiring because of the
slumping economy, even Stanford
students are sweating to peddle
their degree not just to the high
est bidder, but to any bidder.
Joey Feldman, a senior in
humanities from Nebraska, has
sent out 50 applications for teach
ing positions at private high
schools across the country. Thus
far he has received no accep
tances, 40 rejections and has yet
to hear from 10 other prospects.
Feldman said the letters he has
received drone the same refrain of
rejection: You are very qualified

and there is no doubt you would
be an asset but nothing is avail
able at this time.
"It's frustrating," said Feld
man, who wants to teach for one
or two years before studying for a
doctorate. "I thought people
would want Stanford blood and
here it is I have nothing. I thought
employers would eat up a Stan
ford degree."
According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, the 16- to 24-
year-old labor force will level at
23.3 million jobs this summer,

about 400,000 fewer positions
from the same period last year.
Labor officials say the decline is
based on three factors: the shrink
ing number of 16 to 24-year-olds,
lower participation rates in the
work force by people of that age
group and, most importantly, the
elimination of entry-level posi
tions in companies due to the
economy.
Career centers at numerous
colleges and universities are feel
ing the ripple effects of job elimi
nations. Stanford's Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
reported that of the 1,558 compa
nies scheduled to visit this year,
552, or 35 percent, canceled, an
increase from the previous year's
32 percent.
But nearly one-fifth of the can
cellations were because of hiring
freezes brought on by the sluggish
economy, said Rachel Hahn,
recruitment coordinator for the
CPPC. "Of the companies that
came, it appeared that less posi
tions were available and that stu
dents had less opportunity to get
offers," Hahn said.
Large companies such as
American Telephone and Tele
graph Co. canceled in winter quar
ter and informed the CPPC that it
had hired the people it needed in

the fall and was unable to hire
more people come spring.
A handful of other large compa
nies, Hahn said, were reluctant to
spend money to come from the
East Coast to recruit.
But A 1 Levin, director of the
CPPC, said students should not
depend solely on the campus
recruitment services to gain
employment. Only 15 to 20 per
cent of students find jobs by those
means, he said.
Senior Karen Zacarias is heed
ing that advice in her search for a

job in an international develop
ment organization. Although the
international relations major does
not yet have a job offer in her area
of interest, she remains opti
mistic.
"I'm opening up my mind to all
sorts of things," said Zacarias,
who has attended marathon inter
viewing sessions at conferences
both in San Francisco and Wash
ington, D.C. "The doors seem a lit
tle closed right now but they will
open later. They just need a little
bit of oil.

"I just have to change my
expectations around a bit and
realize that my first job is not
what I will be doing for life,"
Zacarias added.
But not all students are having
difficulty planting seeds for their
occupational future. Senior Jen
nifer Mason, a quantitative eco
nomics major, parlayed her sum
mer internships into a full-time
job at Amoco Corp. in Chicago
where she will be a sales represen
tative of plastic resins.
"I feel both guilty and lucky,"

she said. "A lot of my friends don't
have jobs but I do, even though I
will be making less than other
people in my major from previous
years."
Mason also expressed concern
that because she was the last
hired, would she be the first fired,
should the economy not pick up.
During the school year, Nikoa
Evans juggled classwork, her
sorority and a job, leaving her lit
tle time for a well-orchestrated

Chris Williges spends his free time before graduation at the Career Planning and Placement Center, looking for a job. After four years of
problem sets, the quantitative economics major will be working for Stanford Food Service this summer. Williges is just one of the numerous
graduating seniors who didn't get employment as a result of the slumping economy.
