# ROTC graduates head for different adventure
## 
### Jenni Chang 
While many seniors are prepar
ing for work or further schooling,
one group of graduates is headed
for a different sort of adventure.
After graduation, 22 ROTC
seniors will be entering the mili
tary full-time.
These seniors hold at least a
four-year commitment to the mil
itary, depending on their particu
lar division and specialization.
Before beginning actual duty, the
graduates face additional aca
demic training in their fields.
Tom Mondragon, a history
msyor, will attend a Navy nuclear
power school in Orlando, Fla.,
where he will take classes for a
master's in electrical engineering.
After two years, Mondragon will
be in charge of a division, receiv
ing hands-on experience with a
land-based nuclear reactor.
Going directly into the military,
rather than holding a 9-to-5 desk
job, is a "great opportunity. . . .
[It's] a good place to start in life,"
said Mondragon. "I'm pleased I
didn't have to go job hunting," he
added jokingly.
Navy Battalion Executive Offi
cer John Manning, also a history
major, will spend the summer in
San Diego at the Navy's Upward
Bound program, working to pro
vide educational opportunities to
underprivileged children.
Manning is currently assigned
to the U.S.S. Normandy, which
just returned from the Persian
Gulf. Manning said that according
to The New York Times, there is a
chance the Normandy's base at
Staten Island, N.Y., may soon
close. But he is nevertheless
enthusiastic.
"It'll be interesting meeting all

those people," he said.
In the wake of the U.S.-Iraqi
conflict, sensitivity to war
remains high for seniors who face
active duty, especially those whose
specialties would be in immediate
demand if another war were to
break out soon.
Dawn McGuinness, the only
female from Stanford entering
active duty in the Army, has been
assigned to the chemical corps and
expects to work in chemical decon
tamination and defense. An
anthropology mfyor, McGuinness
said she realizes the "danger of
having a chemical specialty,"
which would make her among the
first to be sent to war. But, she
says, "when you sign on, you're
aware of this."
Manning also says he under
stands the "responsibility" of his
position. "We don't make policy
[but] we are prepared to face
[war]."
One graduate will become part
of a naval special warfare team
known as SEAL, which stands for
Sea, Air, Land Team. Eric John
son, an international relations
and quantitative economics major,
is the only SEAL in Berkeley's
ROTC program, a unique position
Johnson sought and attained
despite tough competition. Only a
few dozen students are accepted
into the program nationally.
The program entails an initial
six-month training period John
son expects to be "intense."
Dispelling the "hero" myth
that surrounds the SEALs, John
son says, "They're not supermen.
They're just a group of guys who
have what it takes mentally as
well as physically.
"At this point in my life," he
adds, becoming a SEAL is the

"ultimate challenge" because it
gives him a chance "to prove
something."
Many graduates, all lieu
tenants, express enthusiasm
about their military plans. Man

ning looks forward to the "inten
sity and value of learning to lead
people." He adds that joining the
military gives him the means to
learn from the challenges that
danger brings.
