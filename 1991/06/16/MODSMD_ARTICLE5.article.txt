# Commencement cork nearly collides with Kennedy
## Plus other great moments in 100 years of Stanford graduation history

August 19, 1906
The Daily Palo Alto
Stanford held Commencement early this year
when President David Starr Jordan canceled the
remainder of school on account of the Earthquake of
1906.
Jordan told professors to grant students credit
"as though the year's work was completed." He also
called for immediate "special examinations" for stu
dents of "doubtful standing," and added that "no
one should be reported as passed unless the instruc
tor is certain that such report is deserved."
Jordan said that "Students entitled to degrees on
the basis of the reports received will be granted their
diplomas indue season."
This event marked not only the earliest Com
mencement at Stanford, but the shortest Commence
ment address ever given by a University president.
Which leads us to a dilemma worthy of the Book of
Questions: Would you rather endure a devastating
8.2 earthquake or a long speech in the hot sun?
Hmmm . . . you might have to think about that one
for a while.
May 22, 1916
The Daily Palo Alto
In his Commencement address, University Presi
dent Ray Wilbur told the graduates, "The University
has given you a diploma, not so much as a certificate
of work done as an admission ticket to new opportu
nities and to new possibilities. After one has entered,
the ticket of admission is of but little value."
Little value? Easy for him to say, back when the
"ticket" didn't cost about $100,000. Come to think of
it, if a diploma is a ticket, do you think there are
diploma scalpers? Imagine their sales pitch: "Yo! I
got bachelor's from Stanford. I got master's from
UC-Berkeley. 1 still got one doctorate from Yale left,
but it's gonna go fast. Who needs 'em?"

May 20, 1940
The Stanford Daily
The Daily announced the University will sponsor
a free showing of the movie "Sierra Nevada" for
graduating seniors, their families and their friends
the night before Commencement. According to The
Daily, "The travelogue, accompanied by background
music and spoken commentary, describes spectacu
lar scenes in California's high mountain regions."
Sounds like a party! What did they plan for after
graduation, a seminar on tax shelters? Or maybe a
lecture on the latest census results ? Too much excite
ment for me. . . .
May 30, 1952
The Stanford Daily
The Daily announced that Clark Kerr, chancellor
designate of UC-Berkeley, would give the main
address at the University' 3 Commencement cere
mony.
A weenie giving the Commencement address?
Nice. Did they have the UC-Berkeley coach give a
halftime speech to the Stanford team during Big
Game, too?
June 25, 1985
The Stanford Daily
After a stray champagne cork almost hit Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy in the face during
his introduction of Commencement speaker Mario
Cuomo, Cuomo joked, "If you want to shoot those
things, take your best shot now and then we'll get on
with it."
Cuomo also joked that hot tubs and pina coladas
are two of California's main contributions to the
nation.
Great. Try defending these cracks to your 96-
year-old Republican grandfather who's paid for
your entire education and said he wanted to come to
Commencement, "to see what kind of place I sent
you to." On the other hand, Grandpa always could
appreciate a good pina colada.
