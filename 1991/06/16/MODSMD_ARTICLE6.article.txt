# BROKEN WINGS
## Fixing the angelic landmark, tile by tile, stone by stone 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
A tangle of seemingly chaotic scaffolding domi
nates its vast interior as workers finish final prepa
rations for a major renovation of the most cherished
and historic building on campus. With its lofty
columns and angelic mosaics almost entirely
enshrouded by the skeleton-like webbing, Memorial
Church stands ready for the $8.5 million dollar
reconstruction effort set to begin July 1.
The church's doors have remained closed since
the Loma Prieta Earthquake rocked the Bay Area in
October 1989. The building sustained considerable
structural as well as minor cosmetic damage.
Inquisitive callers to the church's telephone line
have been pleasantly reminded of this fact with a
rendition of "Due to earthquake damage, Memorial
Church will be closed for approximately two years.
No weddings are scheduled."
The goals of the reconstruction effort are fivefold:
• To prevent the four angelical mosaics from col
lapsing by strengthening supports at the top of the
four main arches of the church's crossing. The cross
ing is the central part of the church where the four
main arms converge under the dome;
• To restore the painted stucco cupola — the
dome;
• To repair all the railings and stone masonry;
• To reopen the balconies which have been closed
for over a decade by installing a sprinkler system and
an additional fire exit; and
• To replace the cork flooring.
"We are concerned about the potential stability of
the crossing in a subsequent earthquake and . . .
about the stability of the four triangular mosaics and
the plaster in the dome," said Project Manager
Olivier Pieron.
The majority of the structural work will be done
on the central crossing. This area was most heavily
damaged during the quake because it was the only
section of the church not rebuilt after the Earth
quake of 1906, according to architect Ken Drucker of
the Los Angeles-based firm, Hardy, Holzman and
Pfeiffer.
The towering scaffolding that has been erected is
providing access to portions of the church that have
been inaccessible for over 60 years, Drucker said.
The intricate steel maze leads the intrepid
climber past the balconies, above the vaulted arches
and the four mosaics, all the way to the top of the
dome. From that vantage point, hundreds of feet
above the orderly wooden pews, one can only marvel
at the engineering feat, as well as pray that another
quake doesn't strike.
"I wouldn't want to be up there if another earth
quake hit," Drucker said.
A primary goal of the structural strengthening is
to ensure that in the event of another quake, noth
ing life-threatening would occur, such as falling
debris, he said.
During the last quake, a large portion of one of
the mosaics and several chunks of stone broke loose
and fell to the ground while the church was occupied.
No one was injured.
In order to strengthen the crossing where there is

a 22-inch void between the outer and inner layers of
stone, steel supports will be added and concrete will
be injected into the space, Drucker said.
Three of the triangular mosaics depicting angels
with wings spread sustained minimal visible dam
age, while one, on which an entire wing broke off and
crashed to the floor below, was heavily damaged.
The mosaics were assembled in Italy in the late
19th century and shipped to Stanford in two-foot
sections, said Lesley Bone, a conservator from the I)e
Young Museum in San Francisco who is overseeing
the restoration process.

Work on the mosaics includes securing them to
ensure they will not fall in the future as well as
replacing the fallen pieces and repairing the cracks.
The original tile that fell as a result of the quake will
be restored. However, because many pieces were
apparently taken by souvenir-seekers just after the
quake, Bone said this will not be entirely possible.
"It is worth trying to keep them because there is
very little else that was part of the original building,"
said Bone.
