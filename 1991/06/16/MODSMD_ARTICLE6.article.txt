# BROKEN WINGS
## Fixing the angelic landmark, tile by tile, stone by stone 
### Scott McCormack Staff writer 
A tangle of seemingly chaotic scaffolding domi
nates its vast interior as workers finish final prepa
rations for a major renovation of the most cherished
and historic building on campus. With its lofty
columns and angelic mosaics almost entirely
enshrouded by the skeleton-like webbing, Memorial
Church stands ready for the $8.5 million dollar
reconstruction effort set to begin July 1.
The church's doors have remained closed since
the Loma Prieta Earthquake rocked the Bay Area in
October 1989. The building sustained considerable
structural as well as minor cosmetic damage.
Inquisitive callers to the church's telephone line
have been pleasantly reminded of this fact with a
rendition of "Due to earthquake damage, Memorial
Church will be closed for approximately two years.
No weddings are scheduled."
The goals of the reconstruction effort are fivefold:
• To prevent the four angelical mosaics from col
lapsing by strengthening supports at the top of the
four main arches of the church's crossing. The cross
ing is the central part of the church where the four
main arms converge under the dome;
• To restore the painted stucco cupola — the
dome;
• To repair all the railings and stone masonry;
• To reopen the balconies which have been closed
for over a decade by installing a sprinkler system and
an additional fire exit; and
• To replace the cork flooring.
"We are concerned about the potential stability of
the crossing in a subsequent earthquake and . . .
about the stability of the four triangular mosaics and
the plaster in the dome," said Project Manager
Olivier Pieron.
The majority of the structural work will be done
on the central crossing. This area was most heavily
damaged during the quake because it was the only
section of the church not rebuilt after the Earth
quake of 1906, according to architect Ken Drucker of
the Los Angeles-based firm, Hardy, Holzman and
Pfeiffer.
The towering scaffolding that has been erected is
providing access to portions of the church that have
been inaccessible for over 60 years, Drucker said.
The intricate steel maze leads the intrepid
climber past the balconies, above the vaulted arches
and the four mosaics, all the way to the top of the
dome. From that vantage point, hundreds of feet
above the orderly wooden pews, one can only marvel
at the engineering feat, as well as pray that another
quake doesn't strike.
"I wouldn't want to be up there if another earth
quake hit," Drucker said.
A primary goal of the structural strengthening is
to ensure that in the event of another quake, noth
ing life-threatening would occur, such as falling
debris, he said.
During the last quake, a large portion of one of
the mosaics and several chunks of stone broke loose
and fell to the ground while the church was occupied.
No one was injured.
In order to strengthen the crossing where there is

a 22-inch void between the outer and inner layers of
stone, steel supports will be added and concrete will
be injected into the space, Drucker said.
Three of the triangular mosaics depicting angels
with wings spread sustained minimal visible dam
age, while one, on which an entire wing broke off and
crashed to the floor below, was heavily damaged.
The mosaics were assembled in Italy in the late
19th century and shipped to Stanford in two-foot
sections, said Lesley Bone, a conservator from the I)e
Young Museum in San Francisco who is overseeing
the restoration process.

Work on the mosaics includes securing them to
ensure they will not fall in the future as well as
replacing the fallen pieces and repairing the cracks.
The original tile that fell as a result of the quake will
be restored. However, because many pieces were
apparently taken by souvenir-seekers just after the
quake, Bone said this will not be entirely possible.
"It is worth trying to keep them because there is
very little else that was part of the original building,"
said Bone.

She appealed to anyone who
has a piece of the mosaic to return
it the church so it can be returned
to its proper place.
The church's sandstone cross
visible from Palm Drive will also
be replaced. It has been so weath
ered that the sandstone was
found to have the consistency of
"sugar," Drucker said. The cross'
deteriorated state was discovered
during Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit to campus last
spring, he said.
Although not severely dam
aged during the quake, the
church's stained-glass windows
are also in need of maintenance.
"The windows themselves are
in relatively good shape, but they
need to be taken out and
restored," said Bill Judson of Jud
son Studio, the Los Angeles-based
firm specializing in stained-glass
restoration that conducted a cur
sory investigation of the windows.
"They sustained some buckling
and minor cracking but nothing

catastrophic," he said.
Given their age, the windows
are overall in outstanding condi
tion, Bone said.
The windows were designed at
the turn of the century by Lamb
Studios, one of the nation's most
renowned stained-glass design
ers, said Bone, adding that they
are of comparable quality and
value to anything in Europe.
Judson said the actual glass
painting in the windows is some
of the best in the world. "Stanford
certainly has a treasure in the
church," he said, explaining that
the glass used in them, so-called
"drapery glass," is no longer
available.
Drapery glass, in which
translucent glass is heated and
folded back on itself to look like
the folds of drapery, was invented
in the early 1900s by Tiffany. The
glass is used throughout the win
dows in the garments of the fig
ures depicted.

All work on the windows will
be part of a long-term mainte
nance plan for the church funded
by the remaining $1.5 million of
the church fund not used directly
to cover repair costs, Drucker
said. The chicken wire covering
the outside of the windows will
also be removed to allow more
light to pass through. The wire
was originally installed in the
1960s to prevent vandalism.
The balconies of the church,
which have been closed for over
20 years, will also be reopened
once repairs are complete. Con
struction is scheduled to be com
pleted by September 1992.
"We are very excited about the
[church's] reopening and espe
cially grateful to all the wonderful
people who participated in the
expression of love to the building
that has graced Stanford ... for
so many years," said church
administrator Diane Hill.

ensure they will not fall in the future as well as
replacing the fallen pieces and repairing the cracks.
The original tile that fell as a result of the quake will
be restored. However, because many pieces were
apparently taken by souvenir-seekers just after the
quake, Bone said this will not be entirely possible.
"It is worth trying to keep them because there is
very little else that was part of the original building,"
said Bone.

She appealed to anyone who
has a piece of the mosaic to return

to its proper place.
The church's sandstone cross
visible from Palm Drive will also
be replaced. It has been so weath
ered that the sandstone was
found to have the consistency of
"sugar," Drucker said. The cross'
deteriorated state was discovered
during Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit to campus last
spring, he said.
Although not severely dam
aged during the quake, the
church's stained-glass windows
are also in need of maintenance.
"The windows themselves are
in relatively good shape, but they
need to be taken out and
restored," said Bill Judson of Jud
son Studio, the Los Angeles-based
firm specializing in stained-glass
restoration that conducted a cur
sory investigation of the windows.
"They sustained some buckling
and minor cracking but nothing

catastrophic," he said.
Given their age, the windows
are overall in outstanding condi
tion, Bone said.
The windows were designed at
the turn of the century by Lamb
Studios, one of the nation's most
renowned stained-glass design
ers, said Bone, adding that they
are of comparable quality and
value to anything in Europe.
Judson said the actual glass
painting in the windows is some
of the best in the world. "Stanford
certainly has a treasure in the
church," he said, explaining that
the glass used in them, so-called
"drapery glass," is no longer
available.
Drapery glass, in which
translucent glass is heated and
folded back on itself to look like
the folds of drapery, was invented
in the early 1900s by Tiffany. The
glass is used throughout the win
dows in the garments of the fig
ures depicted.

All work on the windows will
be part of a long-term mainte
nance plan for the church funded
by the remaining $1.5 million of
the church fund not used directly
to cover repair costs, Drucker
said. The chicken wire covering
the outside of the windows will
also be removed to allow more
light to pass through. The wire
was originally installed in the
1960s to prevent vandalism.
The balconies of the church,
which have been closed for over
20 years, will also be reopened
once repairs are complete. Con
struction is scheduled to be com
pleted by September 1992.
"We are very excited about the
[church's] reopening and espe
cially grateful to all the wonderful
people who participated in the
expression of love to the building
that has graced Stanford ... for
so many years," said church
administrator Diane Hill.
A tangle of seemingly chaotic scaffolding domi
nates its vast interior as workers finish final prepa
rations for a major renovation of the most cherished
and historic building on campus. With its lofty
columns and angelic mosaics almost entirely
enshrouded by the skeleton-like webbing, Memorial
Church stands ready for the $8.5 million dollar
reconstruction effort set to begin July 1.
The church's doors have remained closed since
the Loma Prieta Earthquake rocked the Bay Area in
October 1989. The building sustained considerable
structural as well as minor cosmetic damage.
Inquisitive callers to the church's telephone line
have been pleasantly reminded of this fact with a
rendition of "Due to earthquake damage, Memorial
Church will be closed for approximately two years.
No weddings are scheduled."
The goals of the reconstruction effort are fivefold:
• To prevent the four angelical mosaics from col
lapsing by strengthening supports at the top of the
four main arches of the church's crossing. The cross
ing is the central part of the church where the four
main arms converge under the dome;
• To restore the painted stucco cupola — the
dome;
• To repair all the railings and stone masonry;
• To reopen the balconies which have been closed
for over a decade by installing a sprinkler system and
an additional fire exit; and
• To replace the cork flooring.
"We are concerned about the potential stability of
the crossing in a subsequent earthquake and . . .
about the stability of the four triangular mosaics and
the plaster in the dome," said Project Manager
Olivier Pieron.
The majority of the structural work will be done
on the central crossing. This area was most heavily
damaged during the quake because it was the only
section of the church not rebuilt after the Earth
quake of 1906, according to architect Ken Drucker of
the Los Angeles-based firm, Hardy, Holzman and
Pfeiffer.
The towering scaffolding that has been erected is
providing access to portions of the church that have
been inaccessible for over 60 years, Drucker said.
The intricate steel maze leads the intrepid
climber past the balconies, above the vaulted arches
and the four mosaics, all the way to the top of the
dome. From that vantage point, hundreds of feet
above the orderly wooden pews, one can only marvel
at the engineering feat, as well as pray that another
quake doesn't strike.
"I wouldn't want to be up there if another earth
quake hit," Drucker said.
A primary goal of the structural strengthening is
to ensure that in the event of another quake, noth
ing life-threatening would occur, such as falling
debris, he said.
During the last quake, a large portion of one of
the mosaics and several chunks of stone broke loose
and fell to the ground while the church was occupied.
No one was injured.
In order to strengthen the crossing where there is

a 22-inch void between the outer and inner layers of
stone, steel supports will be added and concrete will
be injected into the space, Drucker said.
Three of the triangular mosaics depicting angels
with wings spread sustained minimal visible dam
age, while one, on which an entire wing broke off and
crashed to the floor below, was heavily damaged.
The mosaics were assembled in Italy in the late
19th century and shipped to Stanford in two-foot
sections, said Lesley Bone, a conservator from the I)e
Young Museum in San Francisco who is overseeing
the restoration process.

Work on the mosaics includes securing them to
ensure they will not fall in the future as well as
replacing the fallen pieces and repairing the cracks.
The original tile that fell as a result of the quake will
