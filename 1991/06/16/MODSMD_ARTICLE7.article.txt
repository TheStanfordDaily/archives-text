The fund-raising campaign to restore Memorial
Church is drawing to a close as repairs on the his
toric building are set to begin in July. If all goes
according to schedule, the church will once again be
open for weddings and services in September 1992,
according to Project Manager Olivier Pieron.
A volunteer committee comprised of 23 Stanford
alumni and friends has been working to raise money
since the launching of a $10 million campaign on
Sept. 30 of last year. To date, the committee has
raised $8.9 million.
"It has been an extremely positive and speedy
campaign," said Carolyn Barnes, campaign coordi
nator. Barnes said she was not surprised by the over
whelming response. "As a Stanford graduate, I know
how much people love Memorial Church. I have
been confident from the beginning that it would be
successful," she said.
Over 1,600 individuals have contributed gifts
ranging from $1 to $2 million, Barnes said. The
largest came from alumnus William Hewlett, class of
1934 and co-founder of Hewlett-Packard.
"I consider fthe church J a cornerstone of the Uni
versity, ... part of its social side," Hewlett said. The
most gratifying aspect of the campaign was "to see
people pitch in and provide funding for the chapel,"
he said. "A lot of people who would not necessarily
support Stanford's academic programs came
together to care for the chapel."
The fund-raising committee made direct, formal
solicitations to about 200 people. According to
Barnes, the largest gifts came from this group. The
committee also contacted everyone who has been
married in the church since 1930 â€” a total of nearly
6,000 people, said Barnes, adding that several people
have been married there more than once.
Several of the largest donors were motivated by
the the indelible impression left on them from sit
ting in the church balconies during their undergrad
uate years at Stanford, Barnes said.
The balconies, however, have been closed for over
20 years because of safety reasons. They will be
brought up to current fire codes with the installa
tion of a sprinkler system and the addition of
another fire exit. The balconies will reopen with the
church, according to Pieron.
Barnes attributed the campaign s overwhelming
success to the fact that it offered donors the oppor
tunity "to show their love and appreciation for Stan
ford and to show what the church meant to them."
The recession has not seemed to affect the campaign
adversely, she said, adding that the committee has
every expectation of raising the $1.1 million neces
sary to reach the $10 million goal.
Total repair costs for the project are estimated at
$8.5 million. The remaining $1.5 million from the
campaign will be used to establish a permanent
maintenance fund for such projects as the upkeep of
the stained-glass windows, Barnes said.
