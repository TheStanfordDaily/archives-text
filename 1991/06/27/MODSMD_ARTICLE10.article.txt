# Centennial Commencement spangled with antics, wisdom

### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
When most people think of graduation, they
picture a quiet, solemn ceremony that
marks the passage of students from one
phase of life to another. They envision graduates
dressed in identical robes, marching reverently out
of respect for the importance of the event.
Commencement, they think, is a time for cpntem
plation, for consideration, for subdued celebration.
These people would have found Stanford's 100 th
Commencement, which took place June 16, hard to
believe.
From the blow-up female doll to the bubbles and
the rollerblades, it was clear that this, like those
before it, was a true Stanford graduation. Students
carried teddy bears, played frisbee and cartwheeled
across the field of Stanford Stadium. Mortarboards
were decorated with signs reading "Hire Me" and
"Just Barely," as well as with sequins, low-rise apart
ment buildings and dinosaurs.

ceremony, starting with Commencement speaker
John Gardner's advice to the class of 1991.
"I worry about men and women functioning far
below the level of their possibilities. It need not hap
pen," said Gardner, founder of Common Cause and
the Haas Professor of Public Service. "As you settle
into your adult lives, you cannot write off the danger
of complacency, boredom, growing rigidity, imprison
ment by your own comfortable habits and opinions."
Gardner warned the students of the dangers of
"going to seed," and suggested being interested as a
way to avoid this. "Everyone wants to be interest
ing," he said, "but the vitalizing thing is to be inter
ested. Keep your curiosity, your sense of wonder.
Discover new things. Care. Risk. Reach out."
He urged the graduates to learn and discover
throughout their lives, from their failures as well as
their successes, and never to stop growing.
University President Donald Kennedy also gave
the graduates advice about "life after Stanford,"
telling them not to avoid risks.
