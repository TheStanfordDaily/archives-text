With graduates toting balloons and signs and
cheering at faculty members, flag bearers and each
other, the only thing traditional about this year's
Commencement was that it was untraditional — in
as many ways as possible.
"It was great," said Helene Rabinovitz, aunt of a
graduating senior. "Everyone seemed to be having a
wonderful time, laughing and dancing. "It was
completely different than the graduation at Smith
College, where I teach.... In fact, it was completely
different [from] any college graduation I've ever
seen."
Nick Rosen, a graduating senior, agreed. "I'd
never seen a Stanford Commencement before, and I
was surprised by how free and informal it was. But I
really enjoyed it — it was a lot of fun."
And Beth Earnest, sister of graduating senior
David Earnest, commented on "how unusual the
whole thing was. Very strange."
There were some more "typical" aspects of the

"I urge you not to shrink from the big tasks," he
said. "Don't turn away from them because they are
risky, don't turn away from them because they are
public and don't turn away from them because they
are large. Our society needs the grand ventures, and
the grand ventures need you."
Kennedy encouraged the students to be active,
not passive, participants in society.
"The arena, as Theodore Roosevelt called the
high-risk domain of public life, is a rewarding and
dangerous place. Great forces are at work there —
forces you can barely steer most of the time and can
never control," he said. "Support with all your might
those who elect to enter the arena with you, to share
the joys and the risks. Cultivate a wary indifference
toward those who watch but never play."
Given the behavior of the graduates that Sunday,
Stanford's most recent alumni are definitely ready to
play.
