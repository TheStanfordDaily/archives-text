# THE
						SHULTZ FACTOR
## Without fanfare, George Shultz has quietly brought the world to Stanford 
### ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR 
A few years ago in the middle of a trek through
Indonesia, George Pratt Shultz, at the time out
going secretary of state, was chatting wryly with
a correspondent from the Los Angeles Times.

"I'll be back at Stanford next year. They
offered me a chair," Shultz explained to the
reporter. "But I told them I may not need a
chair. I may need a couch."
In the two years since Shultz traded the
exhausting, hurly-burly world of Washing
ton politics for the quieter confines of
academia, he has been anything but a couch
potato.
Since his return, the professor of inter
national economics and distinguished fel
low at the Hoover Institution has played an
important role in bringing to Stanford
world leaders such as South Korean Presi
dent Roh Tae Woo, who will visit Saturday.
Abroad, Shultz has been an able ambas
sador in the University's international Cen
tennial Celebrations, which were designed
to shore up donor relations and bring 100 th
year festivities to alumni and friends of
Stanford in Canada, England, Hong Kong
and Mexico.
Through it all, Shultz, with an aura of
calm and the trademark self-effacing man
ner of his Reagan cabinet days, has avoided
the media spotlight and quietly observed
the positive influence he has exerted at
Stanford.
University officials have a name for the
influence of the former statesman with
sweeping gray hair and ruddy complexion
— the Shultz difference.
"I have to say George Shultz's return to
Stanford and his loyal and energetic pro
motion of ventures has made all the differ
ence," University President Donald
Kennedy told an audience of alumni in
Mexico City. "It is plain that we would not
have had the kind of access to top officials
in countries if it were not for the fact that
he is such an admired and respected figure
everywhere in the world."
But Shultz is not resting on his laurels.
"He has clearly increased on the reputation
that he brought from Washington," said
Hoover Director John Raisian. "He is just
an incredible asset to the campus and has
been a source of valuable advice to me as
director. Shultz also has this real elegance;
he is unpretentious but commanding, up
front with his views and consistent."
Shultz has a resume that could make a
head of state blush. He has pooled his life
experiences and contacts — from
academia, business and government — to
explore the problems confronting the
world.
In January, he convened current and for
mer world leaders and business heads for
the Advisory Council to the Institute for
International Studies, which is based at
Stanford.
The institute explores ways in which
countries can map out solutions to issues of
international political economy, the envi
ronment and diplomacy with the aid of
Stanford resources.
Members of the Advisory Council read
like a who's who of finance and diplomacy,
including former President Gerald Ford,
Israeli President Chaim Herzog and Cana
dian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
"The Advisory Council has been impor
tant for the profile of the institute and

assisting its international focus," said I
Carol Dressier, associate vice presi
dent for the Office of Development.
Shultz's hope for the institute is
rooted in global responsibility.
"I think the world looks to us for
leadership," he said. "We have to give that
leadership increasingly in terms of working
with our friends and allies ... and fostering
a notion of partnership."
The Stanford community saw hope for
such a partnership last June when Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev visited and
spoke at Stanford as part of a tour of the
United States.

Shultz has a resume that could make a head of state blush.
He has pooled his life experiences and contacts — from
academia, business and government — to explore the prob
lems confronting the world.

At the time of the visit, Kennedy said
Shultz' presence was a primary reason Gor
bachev came to Stanford. During Shultz' six
years as secretary of state he developed
close ties with the Soviet leader and his
aides. The sight of Gorbachev waving to a
sea of students and faculty was a lingering
source of pride for the Stanford community.
Gorbachev's visit also promoted a
detente of sorts between Hoover, a conser
vative pc''cy and research center, and the
University. The institutions are known for
their longtime contentious relationship.
"Shultz was definitely the linchpin to
that process," Raisian said. "He has contin
ued to accentuate a positive relationship
between Hoover and Stanford by being a
part of both. He has even said that both
institutions are stronger for each other."

The art of bringing together opposing
parties and striking compromise is some
thing Shultz has been practicing for most of
his political life.
He graduated with a doctorate in labor
relations from MIT in 1949. His first major
political position was on the President's
Council of Economic Advisers.
Shultz later held various government

posts, including three cabinet positions,
under six presidents of both parties. From
1969-1974 he was secretary of labor, direc
tor of the office of management and budget
and secretary of the treasury, all under
President Nixon.
His association with Stanford began in
1968 as a fellow in the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
In 1982, Shultz was offered the position
of secretary of state when Alexander Haig
unexpectedly resigned.
During his stint as secretary of state,
Shultz became known for his honesty in a
city with more than its share of wayward
politicos. His quiet, let-your-actions-speak
louder-than-words style gave him success in
the Washington world of ladder-climbing
politicians.
This style probably was a throwback to

Shultz's undergraduate days at Princeton,
where he played linebacker on the football
team — a thankless position where players
garner no glory but by working together can
stave off the offense.
"He is not trying to prove himself," a
friend once said of Shultz. "He already
knows who he is."
"He is such a good combination of
things," said George Stigler, a professor at
the University of Chicago at the time of
Shultz' appointment to as secretary of state.
"Richard Nixon referred to him as a Boy
Scout."
But the Boy Scout became became disil
lusioned with the Reagan administration
when he learned of administrative back
stabbing and a series of covert operations of
which he was unaware.
Another low point in his tenure was the
failure of U.S.-sponsored diplomacy to ease
the tensions in the Middle East between
Palestinians and Israelis.
Although Shultz did not leave behind a
highly publicized policy or doctrine, he was
successful in negotiating a U.S.-Soviet ban
on mid-range nuclear weapons, and the
Soviet newspaper Pravda called him a prin
cipal architect of the turning point in U.S.-
Soviet relations. These accomplishments
were done, experts say, in vintage Shultz
style — unspectacular but highly effective.
In 1989, both the Reagan administration
and Shultz' term in the cabinet came to a
close, Shultz could have relaxed and basked
in the glow of years of distinguished service
to his country. Instead he chose to serve his
university — even to the extent of dining in
residences with Stanford undergraduates.
As he enjoys his seventh decade, bring
ing foreign leaders here and carrying Stan
ford's name to foreign lands provides
Shultz with the opportunity to practice a
newly minted form of diplomacy on behalf
of the University. And he is enjoying it.
Just this spring when former Soviet For
eign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited
Stanford, Shultz and others broke out
singing "Georgia on My Mind" at a dinner
for the native of the Soviet Union's Geor
gian Republic.
Shultz has inked a $2.5 million book deal
for two books on his life. A major PBS spe
cial on diplomacy and statecraft that will
receive input from Shultz is also slated for
the future. And to top it off, the high
octane former statesman is preparing for
this fall's Centennial Celebration climax,
which will bring such dignitaries as former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
to campus.
His schedule, chock full of international
visits, meetings, books and classes, could
drive a spouse mad. But don't ask Mrs.
Shultz.
"He's been like this all his life," said
Shultz' wife of 45 years, Helena, known to
friends as O'Bic. "He has those genes to
keep going. It's an exciting life. Not only for
him but for me too."
