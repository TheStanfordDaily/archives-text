## Med School prof. faces charges 
### 
University President Donald
Kennedy brought charges against
a professor of medicine yesterday
for allegedly sexually harassing
two female students.
In response, Prof. Mark Perl
roth, a cardiologist who has been
affiliated with the Medical School
for more than 25 years, said he
"dispute[s] these charges and
plan[s] to contest them vigor
ously."

This case marks
only the second
time in Stanford
history that a Uni
versity president
has filed formal
charges against a
faculty member,
said General Coun
sel John Schwartz.
The two stu-

dents brought separate charges
against Perlroth in December and
February. An ad hoc committee
formed by Medical School Dean
David Korn investigated the alle
gations and forwarded its findings
to Kennedy in late April.
The charges brought against
Perlroth allege that he "refused to
consider the application of a
female medical student for a
teaching assistantship ... because
of his wish to have a romantic or
sexual relationship with her."
"Although immediately on
learning of Dr. Perlroth's wish for
a personal relationship, the stu
dent informed him that she did
not want any such relationship
with him, Dr. Perlroth nonetheless
continued to pursue her through
repeated telephone, written and
personal contact," the charges
state.
In the formal statement of the
charges, Kennedy wrote that Perl
roth's behavior in this case consti
tuted sexual harassment, defined
in University policy as "repeated
and unwanted sexual behavior,
such as physical contact and ver
bal comments or suggestions,
which adversely affects the work
ing or learning environment."
In the second incident, which
allegedly took place last spring,
Perlroth reportedly lowered a

female student's grade so that she
would have to come to his office
to discuss the exam.
During this meeting, Perlroth
"channeled the conversation into
inappropriately personal subjects,

asking her a series
of increasingly in
timate questions
including ques
tions with sexual
overtones," ac
cording to the
charges.
Kennedy said
he found Perl
roth's behavior in

both cases to constitute profes
sional misconduct, as defined in
the 19-year-old Statement on Fac
ulty Discipline. He then privately
notified Perlroth of the allegations
brought against him and
"attempted to resolve the matter
with [him] before" filing charges.
"He did not accept the sanc
tions I proposed, and I have there
fore forwarded a statement of the
charges to Dr. Perlroth and to the
[University] Advisory Board,"
Kennedy said in a statement.
University policy requires that
if such a case cannot be settled by
agreement between the president
and the faculty member, the pres
ident can file charges before the
University's Advisory Board, a
standing committee of seven full
professors elected by the faculty.
The accused faculty member
then has the option of choosing a
public or private hearing.
Perlroth said he is "deeply dis
tressed that the University has
chosen to make public its charges
against me ... By making these
charges public, Stanford has
effectively denied me the right to
a private hearing which is guaran
teed by the University's own
rules."
But Schwartz said, "Perlroth's
statement is intended to confuse
the issues."
Perlroth still has the option of
receiving a private trial and "noth
ing in the Statement of Faculty
Discipline limits the president's
right to tell the community" that
he is filing charges, Schwartz said.
There are about one to two
cases per year in which the presi
dent takes disciplinary action
against a faculty member, but this
is only the second time in Stanford
history that a compromise couldn't

be reached and charges were
brought before the Advisory
Board, Schwartz said.
The charges against Perlroth
also mark the first time sexual
harassment charges were brought
against a faculty member by the
president, he added.
Perlroth suggested that the fil
ing and announcement of these
charges were a result of the nega
tive coverage Stanford has
received in the media recently.
His statement said, "I ask fair
minded observers to reach their
own conclusions as to whether
these harsh sanctions and their
unprecedented and lacerating
publicity ... represent the pru
dent administration of justice, or
whether they are a media
response to the recent embarrass
ing revelations of serious miscon
duct at Stanford."
