ing the last decade.
A statement released by the
Navy did not specify which

the situation said those being dis
ciplined include Tom Dolan,
director of the Office of Naval
Research's university business
affairs division, and Robin Simp
son, the resident representative
assigned to Stanford during the
mid-1980s.
The Navy said that a new acting
director would fill Dolan's posi

The statement also said that an
unnamed employee, who those

proposed action ... pending a
final determination."
The remaining four employees

The Navy statement said that
the performances of the six
employees were "determined to
have collectively contributed to
inadequate management controls
for effective oversight of cost
reimbursement at Stanford Uni
versity."
