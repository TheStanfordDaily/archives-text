# S. Korean leader to visit Hoover
## 
### 
South Korean President Roh
Tae Woo's weeklong sojourn
through North America will begin
Saturday with a three-day visit to
the Bay Area that includes a stop
at the Hoover Institution.
Roh is scheduled to deliver a
major address at the think tank to
an audience of Hoover fellows,
Stanford faculty and invited
guests Saturday afternoon.
The content of his speech has
not yet been disclosed. Officials at
the Institution and experts on
South Korea speculate that Roh's
speech could set the tone for sum
mit meetings next week with Pres
ident Bush and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.
In an interview with the Los
Angeles Times last week, Roh
said that during his visit to the
United States he would present
plans for his country's emerging
role among Pacific Rim countries,
such as Japan and Taiwan, which
are flexing stronger economic and
political muscle.
Roh's decision to speak at
Hoover could have been moti
vated by his membership in the
Advisory Council to the Institute
for International Studies, which is
based at Stanford. The council is
chaired by George Shultz and it
seeks to address global problems.
Observers say the whirlwind
tour is also a valediction of sorts
for the 58-year-old leader. Roh is
in the last year of a five-year pres
idency limited to one term under
the South Korean constitution.

"I feel extremely positive about
the visit," said John Lewis, co
director for the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Con
trol at Stanford. In U.S.-Korean
relations, he added, there have
been periods, when Korea was
ignored in the shuffle of Washing
ton politics. "I am delighted to see
a greater relationship between
Stanford and South Korea."
Despite years of economic
prosperity, which also saw South
Korea host the Summer Olympics
in 1988, Roh's years in office have
also seen turbulent times. His
administration has been shaken
by political scandal and labor
strife. Student demonstrations in
recent years have also frayed the
country's political fabric.
