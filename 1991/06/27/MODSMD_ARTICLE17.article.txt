# Stanford, Soviets to visit Mars
## 
### 
A joint study released yester
day by Stanford and Soviet scien
tists predicts that an international
effort could place astronauts on
Mars and establish a permanent
base there within 21 years.
In response to a call by Presi
dent Bush to establish a perma
nent base on Mars by 2019 — the
50th anniversary of the United
States' first landing on the moon
— a group of Stanford scientists
initiated a joint U.S.-Soviet study
investigating the possibility of an
international space exploration
effort.
The results of the six-month
design study, which was directed
by Assoc. Engineering Prof. Bruce

Lusignan, propose an explorative
mission with a budget of $6 bil
lion, one-tenth the amount of the
highest NASA estimation for a
manned Mars expedition.
According to Larry Colin, visit
ing professor and former NASA
executive, the difference in cost is
due to several expensive aspects
of NASA proposals that the Stan
ford-Soviet team deemed unnec
essary, including preparatory
lunar missions and the establish
ment of permanent space stations
in orbit around Earth.
Colin said another factor that
lowers the cost of.the Stanford-
Soviet project is the complemen
tary nature of U.S. and Soviet
resources. In particular, the Sovi
ets possess a heavy launch vehicle,
the rocket "Energia," which is
capable of lifting 90 to 100 tons
into the air in a single launch. This
technology is necessary for any
Mars expedition carrying humans.
According to NASA estimates,
it would cost the United States an
additional $5 billion and five to 10
years to develop a similar system.
The joint study also proposed
several innovations for the protec
tion of the astronauts. Space
travel presents many health haz
ards, many of which are caused by
the lack of gravity, which causes
the atrophy of the cardiovascular
system and the depletion of cal
cium from the bones.
Colin said it would still be "a
long time before the United
States decides to go ahead on a
project like this." But he adds that
he hopes the project stimulates
further international collabora
tion on space exploration.

The Stanford group plans to
develop further plans for the pro
ject during the next year and to
examine the broader international
political issues involved in such a
collaboration.
