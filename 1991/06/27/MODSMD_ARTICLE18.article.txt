# Name off-limits to Nutri/System
## 
### 
The legal scales tipped in Stan
ford's favor when a federal judge
ruled Monday that the Univer
sity's name and seal is still off-lim
its to Nutri/System advertisers.
The ruling upheld a June 7 ban of
ads that allegedly implied Univer
sity endorsement of the weight
loss program.
The University won the
restraining order against the ad
campaign in early June because
Nutri/System, Inc. was using Stan
ford's logo in its advertisements
without iruthorization.
The can of worms was
reopened last week when officials
from Jenni Craig, Inc., another
weight-loss center, hopped onto
the legal bandwagon, alleging that
Nutri/System had violated the
restraining order and continued
to advertise falsely.
Both Stanford and Jenni Craig
are hungry for financial retribu
tion and seek punitive damages
from Nutri/System, the amount of
which will be determined in a
later trial.
Monday's ruling means
Nutri/System will have to stop the
campaign, correct the advertise
ment and disgorge profits they
may have received from the ads,
Carole Handler, a lawyer for Jenni
Craig said.
The offending advertisements,
which appeared on radio, televi
sion and in newspapers, implied
that the Stanford Center for
Research and Disease Prevention
had co-researched weight loss
centers with Healthline Maga
zine.
Additionally, Nutri/System
paid Healthline $25,000 to be fea
tured exclusively on the cover of
the May issue, after the magazine
and Nutri/System entered an
agreement that falsely stipulated a
"credible Stanford health profes
sional" would write an article
about the program, Hoerger said.

best program in May's issue.
