# Admissions dean search narrowed
## 
### 
Although the new dean of
undergraduate admissions was
not appointed in time for the
planned announcement at Com
mencement, University officials
hope to complete the selection
process by the end of next week.
Three finalists — Zina Jacques,
James Montoya and Ann Quinley
— are now being considered for

It was "a bit of a long shot"
hoping for the new dean to be cho

Norman Robinson, a member of
the search committee and outgo
ing dean of student affairs. "But
we will have ended up missing our
goal by no more than two weeks."
The field of 60 to 70 initial can
didates was narrowed in May to
six by the search committee,
chaired by Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies Tom Wasow. After
conducting public interviews with
the finalists, the committee rec
ommended the three candidates
June 12 to Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney.
Mahoney will make the final
decision.

admissions at UC-Santa Cruz.
Her credentials also include being
dean of admissions and financial
aid at Mills College, associate
director of admissions and finan
cial aid at the University of
Chicago and assistant director of
admissions and financial aid at
Northwestern University.
Montoya is currently dean of
student life at Vassar College and
was director of admissions at Vas
sar and Occidental College for
four years each. He was previ
ously the dean of students, direc
tor of residence, assistant dean of
admission and admission coun
