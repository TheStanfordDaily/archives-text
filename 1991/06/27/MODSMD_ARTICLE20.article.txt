# BLIND AMBITION
## 
### JOHN WAGNER 
Times are tough at Stanford. In addition to present fiscal woes administrators are
facing another budget strain — financial aid. Many say Stanford's need-blind
admissions policy has helped diversify the student body. But as the yearly financial
aid bill rises, Stanford's ability to bear the load is threatened, especially since state
and federal contributions have not increased in the past decade. The question
arises: How can Stanford balance its principles with its pocketbook?

About once each quarter, senior Angela
Hilton invites dozens of local minority
high school students to Stanford to
give them a glimpse of college life.
Many of the students who take part in the
one-day program sponsored by the Black
Student Union have no intention of going to
college, Hilton says. And even fewer believe
they could ever attend Stanford, even if they
wanted to. "The biggest reason they're skep
tical of Stanford is because of how much it
costs," she says.
It's a mindset Hilton understands well.
"That was the one thing that discouraged
me, too," she says. Hilton grew up on the
south side of Chicago, the daughter of a sin
gle mother who raised five children on the
salary of a nurses' assistant. "I didn't really
see college as a possibility because of the
finances," she says.
Hilton will graduate next June with a
degree in American studies and a James W.
Lyons Award for Service. She then hopes to
spend several years teaching fourth- or fifth
graders — "they're still at an age where you
can influence them," she says — before
entering graduate school.
Hilton considers herself lucky. She says
her high school counselor encouraged her to
apply to Stanford and assured her that, one
way or another, she'd be able to afford it.
During her three years at Stanford, Hilton
has worked about 15 hours a week, received
a variety of outside grants and benefited from
a generous scholarship from the University.
She's one of the more than 2,600 Stanford
undergraduates who receive some form of
need-based financial aid each year. The Uni
versity's financial aid program is built on the
philosophy that a Stanford education should
be accessible to qualified students of all
backgrounds, including those like Hilton who
grow up poor.
The policy rests squarely on two princi
ples: "need-blind admissions," which means
that students are admitted without respect to
their financial need; and "need-based aid,"
which means that Stanford is committed to
meet the demonstrated need of its admitted
students through a combination of jobs, loans
and scholarships.
Students and their parents are expected to
pay what federal formulas suggest they can,
and to seek scholarship money from all possi
ble sources. But if a gap still remains between
what a student's family can pay and what a
Stanford education costs, the University will
make up the difference.
The principles are in large part responsi
ble for the increasing diversity of Stanford's
student body in recent years, administrators
say. Stanford's need-blind admissions policy
is often instrumental in convincing talented
lower-income students like Hilton to apply to
Stanford, according to admission officials.

The policy has helped to create "a diverse
student body of color and class," says Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black Community
Services Center.
But the lofty principles behind Stan
ford's financial-aid policy have not
come without a high price.
Stanford will contribute close to $33 mil
lion of its own funds to undergraduate finan
cial aid next year — more than three times
what it did a decade ago. "This is an increas
ingly expensive undertaking," says outgoing
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter, "and an increasingly expensive com
mitment for the University."
In fact, as administrators search for ways
to cope with Stanford's current financial cri
sis, University officials are offering no guar
antees that the need-blind admissions policy
will remain intact in coming years.
"There are deep, important questions that
need to be raised," says Provost James Rosse,
who is guiding the current effort to slash
around 10 percent from the University's $400
million operating budget.
"I wouldn't want to issue any guarantees
right now," Rosse says. "But I don't necessar
ily want to sound an alarm either."
Robert Huff, Stanford's director of finan
cial aids for the past 43 years, strikes a similar
chord. "I think need-blind admissions is
going to be looked at," Huff says."I think
there's little question of that. ... What's
going to happen I can't predict."
Stanford's entire financial-aid program
will be subject to "a year of very careful anal
ysis," Huff says.
The source of the current financial-aid
crunch is fairly easy to trace. As the
cost of attending Stanford spiraled
upward during the 1980s, so too did the
financial aid that Stanford undergraduates
needed to pay for their education. Total need
among Stanford's undergraduates will
approach $50 million next year. In 1979-80,
that figure was only $18.8 million.
During the same period, state and federal
scholarships and loans obtained by Stanford
students have remained stagnant — actually
decreasing once inflation is taken into
account.
A decade ago, Stanford undergraduates
collectively received $2.5 million in state aid.
This year: $2.6 million. The federal picture is
no brighter. In 1980-81, federal aid to Stan
ford undergraduates totaled $9.3 million.
The figure has wavered during the past
decade, but is expected to be close to $9.3
million again next year.
"We're just not seeing an increase in pub
lic aid," Huff laments.
As a result, Stanford has become more

saddled than ever
by the financial
needs of its stu
dents. University
funds accounted for
less than half of
total aid going to
undergraduates a
decade ago. Today
Stanford funds
account for about
two-thirds of total
aid.
By way of con
trast, federal funds
have decreased as a
percentage of total
aid from almost 40
percent in the early
1980s to less than
20 percent this year.
State funds have
dwindled from 10
percent to about 5
percent during the
same period.
About half of the
dollars Stanford
will spend next year
on undergraduate
financial aid will
come from "re
stricted" funds —
endowment income
and gifts that
alumni and other
friends of Stanford

have earmarked for financial aid. Ideally,
Huff and Rosse say, all University aid should
come from these sources.
Even with the success of Stanford's Cen
tennial Campaign — donors have surpassed
the target set for undergraduate scholarships
by nearly 20 percent — the current situation
is far from ideal.
The University has also set aside $16.6
million from next year's beleaguered operat
ing budget to fulfill the University's financial
aid commitment. "It's a big hunk of cash,"
Huff notes. These funds will be competing
for survival along with every other dollar in
the operating budget in the upcoming

months, as the University begins its pruning
process.
The $16.6 million figure represents a stag
gering 27 percent increase over the level of
general funds Stanford spent this year on
financial aid. Much of the increase, adminis
trators believe, is a result of the poor condi
tion of the national economy. Amid a reces
sion, more families have found it difficult to
finance their children's education.
There's no way to quantify the effect of
the recession. Huff says, but there is ample
anecdotal evidence to suggest that "many
families are feeling pinched."

University officials are offering few
specifics as to how the pinch on the
University's funds will be alleviated.
They say they will be searching for policies
which are less costly but still incorporate the
principles of equal access and diversity upon
which the current commitments are founded.
"It may be that we can accomplish those
values in other ways," Rosse says. He says he
is "enormously proud" of the ethnic diversity
Stanford has achieved in recent years.
"There's no way we want to walk away from
that proposition," Rosse says.
University President Donald Kennedy
concurs. "In a budget crunch, everything is

'thinkable,'" he says. "But I want to empha
size the need-blind policy has the status of an
important principle here. We would modify it
only under extreme difficulty."
Stanford has deviated from the need-blind
principle once before in the past.
In 1986, the University Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid set a $375,000 cap on aid that could be
expended by the University on international
students attending Stanford. For the past sev
eral years, the cap has been bumped at
roughly the level of inflation. It now sits at
$450,000.
As a result of the cap, there were "at least

70 or 80 undergraduates from across the
world who would have made the most won
derful additions to the undergraduate popu
lation who could not be admitted because we
could not afford it," Fetter told the Faculty
Senate in a farewell address earlier this
month.
While most administrators agree that
any future change in overall policy
would not include a formal cap,
most concede that Stanford's current diffi
culties will inevitably lead to some tough
choices. It's possible, Rosse acknowledges,
that cost considerations may creep into

admissions decisions in the future.
If, for example, the University must
choose between two students of equal ability,
one from California and the other from the
Midwest, the in-state applicant may get the
nod since he would be eligible for a Califor
nia State Scholarship.
"Parochialism ... may be a price we have
to pay," Rosse says.
Administrators will also be examining
whether the University can continue a three
year-old effort aimed at reducing the amount
students on aid are expected to contribute to
their own education. Until the 1989-90 aca
demic year, Stanford undergraduates were
expected to generate 25 percent of total costs
through jobs and loans — a slightly higher
percentage than comparable institutions in
the East.
Administrators worried that students were
spending too much time working and not
enough time engaging in research and taking
advantage of overseas opportunities.
Accordingly, for the past few years, the
increase in students' "self-help" expectation
has been kept to 20 percent of the increase in
total fees. The ultimate goal of the policy is to
reduce the self-help component to 20 per
cent.
Given current budget realities, that target
may now be in jeopardy. "I wouldn't want to
make a firm prediction," Rosse says.
Currently, Stanford's self-help expecta
tions remain higher than most of its East
Coast "competitors." Stanford freshmen on
financial aid this year were expected to con
tribute $5,450 through loans and jobs; Har
vard freshmen had a $4,100 expectation;
Yale's was $4,000; Princeton's $4,480.
During the next year, administrators at
Stanford will be attempting to bal
ance long-standing principles with
new-found budget realities.
The stakes, many believe, are quite high.
"The roughest times are the worst times to
abandon your principles," says Archuleta,
director of the Black Community Services
Center and a Stanford graduate who bene
fited from the University's financial-aid poli
cies as a student.
According to Archuleta, altering need
blind policies would send a negative message
to poor students — a message that "Stanford
is totally out of the picture."
Fetter articulated similar concerns earlier
this month in her address to the senate. "I am
very concerned about what will happen both
to our applicant pool and to our enrolling
classes if we need to waver on our commit
ment to need-blind admissions," she said,
"but I realize there are some very challenging
choices ahead in the budget considerations."
Rosse says he shares Fetter's concerns and
realizes that a daunting task lies ahead. "It's
going to take a careful look," Rosse says.

tennial Campaign — donors have surpassed
the target set for undergraduate scholarships
by nearly 20 percent — the current situation
is far from ideal.
The University has also set aside $16.6
million from next year's beleaguered operat
ing budget to fulfill the University's financial
aid commitment. "It's a big hunk of cash,"
Huff notes. These funds will be competing
for survival along with every other dollar in
the operating budget in the upcoming

months, as the University begins its pruning
process.
The $16.6 million figure represents a stag
gering 27 percent increase over the level of
general funds Stanford spent this year on
financial aid. Much of the increase, adminis
trators believe, is a result of the poor condi
tion of the national economy. Amid a reces
sion, more families have found it difficult to
finance their children's education.
There's no way to quantify the effect of
the recession. Huff says, but there is ample
anecdotal evidence to suggest that "many
families are feeling pinched."

University officials are offering few
specifics as to how the pinch on the
University's funds will be alleviated.
They say they will be searching for policies
which are less costly but still incorporate the
principles of equal access and diversity upon
which the current commitments are founded.
"It may be that we can accomplish those
values in other ways," Rosse says. He says he
is "enormously proud" of the ethnic diversity
Stanford has achieved in recent years.
"There's no way we want to walk away from
that proposition," Rosse says.
University President Donald Kennedy
concurs. "In a budget crunch, everything is

'thinkable,'" he says. "But I want to empha
size the need-blind policy has the status of an
important principle here. We would modify it
only under extreme difficulty."
Stanford has deviated from the need-blind
principle once before in the past.
In 1986, the University Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid set a $375,000 cap on aid that could be
expended by the University on international
students attending Stanford. For the past sev
eral years, the cap has been bumped at
roughly the level of inflation. It now sits at
$450,000.
As a result of the cap, there were "at least

70 or 80 undergraduates from across the
world who would have made the most won
derful additions to the undergraduate popu
lation who could not be admitted because we
could not afford it," Fetter told the Faculty
Senate in a farewell address earlier this
month.
While most administrators agree that
any future change in overall policy
would not include a formal cap,
most concede that Stanford's current diffi
culties will inevitably lead to some tough
choices. It's possible, Rosse acknowledges,
that cost considerations may creep into

admissions decisions in the future.
If, for example, the University must
choose between two students of equal ability,
one from California and the other from the
Midwest, the in-state applicant may get the
nod since he would be eligible for a Califor
nia State Scholarship.
"Parochialism ... may be a price we have
to pay," Rosse says.
Administrators will also be examining
whether the University can continue a three
year-old effort aimed at reducing the amount
students on aid are expected to contribute to
their own education. Until the 1989-90 aca
demic year, Stanford undergraduates were
expected to generate 25 percent of total costs
through jobs and loans — a slightly higher
percentage than comparable institutions in
the East.
Administrators worried that students were
spending too much time working and not
enough time engaging in research and taking
advantage of overseas opportunities.
Accordingly, for the past few years, the
increase in students' "self-help" expectation
has been kept to 20 percent of the increase in
total fees. The ultimate goal of the policy is to
reduce the self-help component to 20 per
cent.
Given current budget realities, that target
may now be in jeopardy. "I wouldn't want to
make a firm prediction," Rosse says.
Currently, Stanford's self-help expecta
tions remain higher than most of its East
Coast "competitors." Stanford freshmen on
financial aid this year were expected to con
tribute $5,450 through loans and jobs; Har
vard freshmen had a $4,100 expectation;
Yale's was $4,000; Princeton's $4,480.
During the next year, administrators at
Stanford will be attempting to bal
ance long-standing principles with
new-found budget realities.
The stakes, many believe, are quite high.
"The roughest times are the worst times to
abandon your principles," says Archuleta,
director of the Black Community Services
Center and a Stanford graduate who bene
fited from the University's financial-aid poli
cies as a student.
According to Archuleta, altering need
blind policies would send a negative message
to poor students — a message that "Stanford
is totally out of the picture."
Fetter articulated similar concerns earlier
this month in her address to the senate. "I am
very concerned about what will happen both
to our applicant pool and to our enrolling
classes if we need to waver on our commit
ment to need-blind admissions," she said,
"but I realize there are some very challenging
choices ahead in the budget considerations."
Rosse says he shares Fetter's concerns and
realizes that a daunting task lies ahead. "It's
going to take a careful look," Rosse says.

Times are tough at Stanford. In addition to present fiscal woes administrators are
facing another budget strain — financial aid. Many say Stanford's need-blind
admissions policy has helped diversify the student body. But as the yearly financial
aid bill rises, Stanford's ability to bear the load is threatened, especially since state
and federal contributions have not increased in the past decade. The question
arises: How can Stanford balance its principles with its pocketbook?

About once each quarter, senior Angela
Hilton invites dozens of local minority
high school students to Stanford to
give them a glimpse of college life.
Many of the students who take part in the
one-day program sponsored by the Black
Student Union have no intention of going to
college, Hilton says. And even fewer believe
they could ever attend Stanford, even if they
wanted to. "The biggest reason they're skep
tical of Stanford is because of how much it
costs," she says.
It's a mindset Hilton understands well.
"That was the one thing that discouraged
me, too," she says. Hilton grew up on the
south side of Chicago, the daughter of a sin
gle mother who raised five children on the
salary of a nurses' assistant. "I didn't really
see college as a possibility because of the
finances," she says.
Hilton will graduate next June with a
degree in American studies and a James W.
Lyons Award for Service. She then hopes to
spend several years teaching fourth- or fifth
graders — "they're still at an age where you
can influence them," she says — before
entering graduate school.
Hilton considers herself lucky. She says
her high school counselor encouraged her to
apply to Stanford and assured her that, one
way or another, she'd be able to afford it.
During her three years at Stanford, Hilton
has worked about 15 hours a week, received
a variety of outside grants and benefited from
a generous scholarship from the University.
She's one of the more than 2,600 Stanford
undergraduates who receive some form of
need-based financial aid each year. The Uni
versity's financial aid program is built on the
philosophy that a Stanford education should
be accessible to qualified students of all
backgrounds, including those like Hilton who
grow up poor.
The policy rests squarely on two princi
ples: "need-blind admissions," which means
that students are admitted without respect to
their financial need; and "need-based aid,"
which means that Stanford is committed to
meet the demonstrated need of its admitted
students through a combination of jobs, loans
and scholarships.
Students and their parents are expected to
pay what federal formulas suggest they can,
and to seek scholarship money from all possi
ble sources. But if a gap still remains between
what a student's family can pay and what a
Stanford education costs, the University will
make up the difference.
The principles are in large part responsi
ble for the increasing diversity of Stanford's
student body in recent years, administrators
say. Stanford's need-blind admissions policy
is often instrumental in convincing talented
lower-income students like Hilton to apply to
Stanford, according to admission officials.

The policy has helped to create "a diverse
student body of color and class," says Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black Community
Services Center.
But the lofty principles behind Stan
ford's financial-aid policy have not
come without a high price.
Stanford will contribute close to $33 mil
lion of its own funds to undergraduate finan
cial aid next year — more than three times
what it did a decade ago. "This is an increas
ingly expensive undertaking," says outgoing
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter, "and an increasingly expensive com
mitment for the University."
In fact, as administrators search for ways
to cope with Stanford's current financial cri
sis, University officials are offering no guar
antees that the need-blind admissions policy
will remain intact in coming years.
"There are deep, important questions that
need to be raised," says Provost James Rosse,
who is guiding the current effort to slash
around 10 percent from the University's $400
million operating budget.
"I wouldn't want to issue any guarantees
right now," Rosse says. "But I don't necessar
ily want to sound an alarm either."
Robert Huff, Stanford's director of finan
cial aids for the past 43 years, strikes a similar
chord. "I think need-blind admissions is
going to be looked at," Huff says."I think
there's little question of that. ... What's
going to happen I can't predict."
Stanford's entire financial-aid program
will be subject to "a year of very careful anal
ysis," Huff says.
The source of the current financial-aid
crunch is fairly easy to trace. As the
cost of attending Stanford spiraled
upward during the 1980s, so too did the
financial aid that Stanford undergraduates
needed to pay for their education. Total need
among Stanford's undergraduates will
approach $50 million next year. In 1979-80,
that figure was only $18.8 million.
During the same period, state and federal
scholarships and loans obtained by Stanford
students have remained stagnant — actually
decreasing once inflation is taken into
account.
A decade ago, Stanford undergraduates
collectively received $2.5 million in state aid.
This year: $2.6 million. The federal picture is
no brighter. In 1980-81, federal aid to Stan
ford undergraduates totaled $9.3 million.
The figure has wavered during the past
decade, but is expected to be close to $9.3
million again next year.
"We're just not seeing an increase in pub
lic aid," Huff laments.
As a result, Stanford has become more

saddled than ever
by the financial
needs of its stu
dents. University
funds accounted for
less than half of
total aid going to
undergraduates a
decade ago. Today
Stanford funds
account for about
two-thirds of total
aid.
By way of con
trast, federal funds
have decreased as a
percentage of total
aid from almost 40
percent in the early
1980s to less than
20 percent this year.
State funds have
dwindled from 10
percent to about 5
percent during the
same period.
About half of the
dollars Stanford
will spend next year
on undergraduate
financial aid will
come from "re
stricted" funds —
endowment income
and gifts that
alumni and other
friends of Stanford

have earmarked for financial aid. Ideally,
Huff and Rosse say, all University aid should
come from these sources.
Even with the success of Stanford's Cen
tennial Campaign — donors have surpassed
the target set for undergraduate scholarships
by nearly 20 percent — the current situation
is far from ideal.
The University has also set aside $16.6
million from next year's beleaguered operat
ing budget to fulfill the University's financial
aid commitment. "It's a big hunk of cash,"
Huff notes. These funds will be competing
for survival along with every other dollar in
the operating budget in the upcoming

months, as the University begins its pruning
process.
The $16.6 million figure represents a stag
gering 27 percent increase over the level of
general funds Stanford spent this year on
financial aid. Much of the increase, adminis
trators believe, is a result of the poor condi
tion of the national economy. Amid a reces

Many of the students who take part in the
one-day program sponsored by the Black
Student Union have no intention of going to
college, Hilton says. And even fewer believe
they could ever attend Stanford, even if they
wanted to. "The biggest reason they're skep
tical of Stanford is because of how much it
costs," she says.
It's a mindset Hilton understands well.
"That was the one thing that discouraged
me, too," she says. Hilton grew up on the
south side of Chicago, the daughter of a sin
gle mother who raised five children on the
salary of a nurses' assistant. "I didn't really
see college as a possibility because of the
finances," she says.
Hilton will graduate next June with a
degree in American studies and a James W.
Lyons Award for Service. She then hopes to
spend several years teaching fourth- or fifth
graders — "they're still at an age where you
can influence them," she says — before
entering graduate school.
Hilton considers herself lucky. She says
her high school counselor encouraged her to
apply to Stanford and assured her that, one
way or another, she'd be able to afford it.
During her three years at Stanford, Hilton
has worked about 15 hours a week, received
a variety of outside grants and benefited from
a generous scholarship from the University.
She's one of the more than 2,600 Stanford
undergraduates who receive some form of
need-based financial aid each year. The Uni
versity's financial aid program is built on the
philosophy that a Stanford education should
be accessible to qualified students of all
backgrounds, including those like Hilton who
grow up poor.
The policy rests squarely on two princi
ples: "need-blind admissions," which means
that students are admitted without respect to
their financial need; and "need-based aid,"
which means that Stanford is committed to
meet the demonstrated need of its admitted
students through a combination of jobs, loans
and scholarships.
Students and their parents are expected to
pay what federal formulas suggest they can,
and to seek scholarship money from all possi
ble sources. But if a gap still remains between
what a student's family can pay and what a
Stanford education costs, the University will
make up the difference.
The principles are in large part responsi
ble for the increasing diversity of Stanford's
student body in recent years, administrators
say. Stanford's need-blind admissions policy
is often instrumental in convincing talented
lower-income students like Hilton to apply to
Stanford, according to admission officials.

The policy has helped to create "a diverse
student body of color and class," says Keith
Archuleta, director of the Black Community
Services Center.
But the lofty principles behind Stan
ford's financial-aid policy have not
come without a high price.
Stanford will contribute close to $33 mil
lion of its own funds to undergraduate finan
cial aid next year — more than three times
what it did a decade ago. "This is an increas
ingly expensive undertaking," says outgoing
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean
Fetter, "and an increasingly expensive com
mitment for the University."
In fact, as administrators search for ways
to cope with Stanford's current financial cri
sis, University officials are offering no guar
antees that the need-blind admissions policy
will remain intact in coming years.
"There are deep, important questions that
need to be raised," says Provost James Rosse,
who is guiding the current effort to slash
around 10 percent from the University's $400
million operating budget.
"I wouldn't want to issue any guarantees
right now," Rosse says. "But I don't necessar
ily want to sound an alarm either."
Robert Huff, Stanford's director of finan
cial aids for the past 43 years, strikes a similar
chord. "I think need-blind admissions is
going to be looked at," Huff says."I think
there's little question of that. ... What's
going to happen I can't predict."
Stanford's entire financial-aid program
will be subject to "a year of very careful anal
ysis," Huff says.
The source of the current financial-aid
crunch is fairly easy to trace. As the
cost of attending Stanford spiraled
upward during the 1980s, so too did the
financial aid that Stanford undergraduates
needed to pay for their education. Total need
among Stanford's undergraduates will
approach $50 million next year. In 1979-80,
that figure was only $18.8 million.
During the same period, state and federal
scholarships and loans obtained by Stanford
students have remained stagnant — actually
decreasing once inflation is taken into
account.
A decade ago, Stanford undergraduates
collectively received $2.5 million in state aid.
This year: $2.6 million. The federal picture is
no brighter. In 1980-81, federal aid to Stan
ford undergraduates totaled $9.3 million.
The figure has wavered during the past
decade, but is expected to be close to $9.3
million again next year.
"We're just not seeing an increase in pub
lic aid," Huff laments.
As a result, Stanford has become more

saddled than ever
by the financial
needs of its stu
dents. University
funds accounted for
less than half of
total aid going to
undergraduates a
decade ago. Today
Stanford funds
account for about
two-thirds of total
aid.
By way of con
trast, federal funds
have decreased as a
percentage of total
aid from almost 40
percent in the early
1980s to less than
20 percent this year.
State funds have
dwindled from 10
percent to about 5
percent during the
same period.
About half of the
dollars Stanford
will spend next year
on undergraduate
financial aid will
come from "re
stricted" funds —
endowment income
and gifts that
alumni and other
friends of Stanford

have earmarked for financial aid. Ideally,
Huff and Rosse say, all University aid should
come from these sources.
Even with the success of Stanford's Cen
tennial Campaign — donors have surpassed
the target set for undergraduate scholarships
by nearly 20 percent — the current situation
is far from ideal.
The University has also set aside $16.6
million from next year's beleaguered operat
ing budget to fulfill the University's financial
aid commitment. "It's a big hunk of cash,"
Huff notes. These funds will be competing
for survival along with every other dollar in
the operating budget in the upcoming

months, as the University begins its pruning
process.
The $16.6 million figure represents a stag
gering 27 percent increase over the level of
general funds Stanford spent this year on
financial aid. Much of the increase, adminis
trators believe, is a result of the poor condi
tion of the national economy. Amid a reces
sion, more families have found it difficult to
finance their children's education.
There's no way to quantify the effect of
the recession. Huff says, but there is ample
anecdotal evidence to suggest that "many
families are feeling pinched."

University officials are offering few
specifics as to how the pinch on the
University's funds will be alleviated.
They say they will be searching for policies
which are less costly but still incorporate the
principles of equal access and diversity upon
which the current commitments are founded.
"It may be that we can accomplish those
values in other ways," Rosse says. He says he
is "enormously proud" of the ethnic diversity
Stanford has achieved in recent years.
"There's no way we want to walk away from
that proposition," Rosse says.
University President Donald Kennedy
concurs. "In a budget crunch, everything is

'thinkable,'" he says. "But I want to empha
size the need-blind policy has the status of an
important principle here. We would modify it
only under extreme difficulty."
Stanford has deviated from the need-blind
principle once before in the past.
In 1986, the University Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid set a $375,000 cap on aid that could be
expended by the University on international
students attending Stanford. For the past sev
eral years, the cap has been bumped at
roughly the level of inflation. It now sits at
$450,000.
As a result of the cap, there were "at least

70 or 80 undergraduates from across the
world who would have made the most won
derful additions to the undergraduate popu
lation who could not be admitted because we
could not afford it," Fetter told the Faculty
Senate in a farewell address earlier this
month.
While most administrators agree that
any future change in overall policy
would not include a formal cap,
most concede that Stanford's current diffi
culties will inevitably lead to some tough
choices. It's possible, Rosse acknowledges,
that cost considerations may creep into

admissions decisions in the future.
If, for example, the University must
choose between two students of equal ability,
one from California and the other from the
Midwest, the in-state applicant may get the
nod since he would be eligible for a Califor
nia State Scholarship.
"Parochialism ... may be a price we have
to pay," Rosse says.
Administrators will also be examining
whether the University can continue a three
year-old effort aimed at reducing the amount
students on aid are expected to contribute to
their own education. Until the 1989-90 aca
demic year, Stanford undergraduates were
expected to generate 25 percent of total costs
through jobs and loans — a slightly higher
percentage than comparable institutions in
the East.
Administrators worried that students were
spending too much time working and not
enough time engaging in research and taking
advantage of overseas opportunities.
Accordingly, for the past few years, the
increase in students' "self-help" expectation
has been kept to 20 percent of the increase in
total fees. The ultimate goal of the policy is to
reduce the self-help component to 20 per
cent.
Given current budget realities, that target
may now be in jeopardy. "I wouldn't want to
make a firm prediction," Rosse says.
Currently, Stanford's self-help expecta
tions remain higher than most of its East
Coast "competitors." Stanford freshmen on
financial aid this year were expected to con
tribute $5,450 through loans and jobs; Har
vard freshmen had a $4,100 expectation;
Yale's was $4,000; Princeton's $4,480.
During the next year, administrators at
Stanford will be attempting to bal
ance long-standing principles with
new-found budget realities.
The stakes, many believe, are quite high.
"The roughest times are the worst times to
abandon your principles," says Archuleta,
director of the Black Community Services
Center and a Stanford graduate who bene
fited from the University's financial-aid poli
cies as a student.
According to Archuleta, altering need
blind policies would send a negative message
to poor students — a message that "Stanford
is totally out of the picture."
Fetter articulated similar concerns earlier
this month in her address to the senate. "I am
very concerned about what will happen both
to our applicant pool and to our enrolling
classes if we need to waver on our commit
ment to need-blind admissions," she said,
"but I realize there are some very challenging
choices ahead in the budget considerations."
Rosse says he shares Fetter's concerns and
realizes that a daunting task lies ahead. "It's
going to take a careful look," Rosse says.

Times are tough at Stanford. In addition to present fiscal woes administrators are
facing another budget strain — financial aid. Many say Stanford's need-blind
admissions policy has helped diversify the student body. But as the yearly financial
aid bill rises, Stanford's ability to bear the load is threatened, especially since state
and federal contributions have not increased in the past decade. The question
arises: How can Stanford balance its principles with its pocketbook?

About once each quarter, senior Angela
Hilton invites dozens of local minority
high school students to Stanford to
give them a glimpse of college life.
Many of the students who take part in the
one-day program sponsored by the Black
Student Union have no intention of going to
college, Hilton says. And even fewer believe
they could ever attend Stanford, even if they
