## Graham falls to Werdel in first round of Wimbledon 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Rain washed out much of the first three
days of play at Wimbledon and a former
Stanford star washed out senior Debbie
Graham's All-England Club debut yester
day.
Graham, who was coming off an excel
lent French Open that saw her win two
matches, was bested by Marianne Werdel
of Bakersfield 6-3, 6-2 in a first-round
match. Werdel helped Stanford win a
national title back in 1986 — the first of
Stanford's unprecedented six straight
NCAA crowns.

After that season, Werdel decided not to
return for her sophomore year. She strug
gled in her first couple of years on the pro
fessional circuit but has come on recently.
Currently, Werdel is ranked 33rd on the
Women's Tennis Association computer —
the highest placing of any woman who has
played for Stanford.
Just 10 spots behind Werdel is Tami
Whitlinger, who wore the Cardinal and
White for two years, '88 and *89, before
heading to the pros. Whitlinger is very hot
right now having reached the semifinals of
a tournament in Switzerland before
advancing to the third round at Roland
Garros.

Her Wimbledon opener was against the
youngest of the three Maleeva sisters, Mag
dalena. Whitlinger easily subdued the
young Bulgarian, 6-1, 6-3.
Another handful of former Stanford
greats is in action at Wimbledon, although
many have not yet completed first-round
matches due to the weather — Wimble
don's worst in half a century.
Of those who have played their openers
two men from the early '80s, Dcrrick Ros
tagno and the legendary John McEnroe,
have advanced. Rostagno downed Italy's
Renzo Furlan 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 while McEnroe
crushed Brazil's Jaime Oncins 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.
Former champion Pat Cash bested Jeff

Tarango, who starred at Stanford in the lat
ter part of the last decade, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3.
The matches not yet completed involv
ing Stanford names include the following:
Jim Grabb versus Portugal's Nuno Mar
ques; Patrick McEnroe versus Spain's
Emilio Sanchez, the 11th seed; David
Wheaton versus Czechosolvakia's Petr
Korda; Tim Mayotte versus ninth-seed
Michael Chang; and Patty Fendick versus
Austria's Judith Weisner.
Wimbledon is scheduled to be com
pleted a week from Sunday but delays may
push that back by a day or so. The tourna
ment has in the past been forced into a
third week, albeit very rarely.
