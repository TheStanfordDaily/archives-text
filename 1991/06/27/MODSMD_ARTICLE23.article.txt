withdrawal and can't wait for camp

p.m., Maples Pavilion) will benefit
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department and Stanford's Club
Sports program.
Regular participants include

Hello and goodbye
Wendy Davis figures coaching
women's crew is a family affair.
After eight years as an assistant
coach, she is moving up to head the
program.
Who's Davis replacing? Why her
husband John, of course, who is
moving on after captaining the crew

team since 1979.
Wendy Davis has focused pri
marily on the novice crews during
her tenure. In 1984, the novice crew
finished third nationally. In 1988,
they went undefeated and won the
Pacific Coast Championships. No
Stanford novice crew had ever done
that before.
• Sheryl Johnson, coach of the
field hockey team, announced her
retirement from international field
hockey earlier this month. Johnson
played on all three U.S. women's
Olympic field hockey teams and was
one of the best players this country
has ever had. She said an ankle
injury forced her to hang it up.
Johnson joined the national
team in 1978 and won a bronze
medal at the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles. Three times she was
named Athlete of the Year ('B6, '87
and '89) and she played in eight
U.S. Olympic festivals.
Birch's newest title
Sandra Birch, who capped a bril
liant collegiate career by winning
her second NCAA singles crown a
month ago, was named the GTE
Academic All-American of the
Year. The award is given by the
1,600-member College Sports Infor
mation Directors of America.
Birch graduated two weeks ago
with a bachelor's in economics and
a 3.8 grade-point average. In four
years, she contributed to four
NCAA team titles for Stanford. Her
accomplishments, including two

years at No. 1 singles, earned her a
spot on the NCAA all-decade team
and a permanent place in the Stan
ford record books.
Tempted to turn professional
after a disappointing finish to her
junior year, Birch instead returned
to school and led the Cardinal to its
sixth straight national title. She will
make her professional debut in a
couple of weeks at a satellite event
in Evansville, Ind. Regardless of
how well she performs this summer,
Birch is guaranteed a spot in the
main draw of the U.S. Open in
August.
The NCAA champion is given a
wild card entry into the Grand Slam
event and need not qualify even if
her ranking would otherwise
require it.
Some random news
Stanford swimmers made their
presence felt at the Swim Meet of
Champions in Mission Viejo, Calif.,
last weekend. Among the highly
placed finishers were:
Summer Sanders, first in the
200-meter individual medley in
2:21.86; Jill Johnson, first in the 200
breaststroke in 2:38.31; Lori
lleisick, second in the 100 breast
stroke in 1:13.68; Suzy Buckovich,
third in the 100 butterfly in 1:03.81;
and alumna Almee Berzins, third in
the 50 freestyle in 27:36. ...
Eileen Riehetelli was a surprise
qualifier for the Pan Am Games in
10-meter platform diving.
