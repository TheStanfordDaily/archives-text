## The
						world's greatest event 
### 
Andre Agassi says he's fig
ured out what everyone
else has known for some
time: Wimbledon is the most
important tennis tournament in
the world.
Once upon a time, many of the
top players — mostly men —
rejected that notion. They passed
up a fortnight at the All-England
Club for a whole host of reasons.
Ivan Lendl claimed he was allergic
to grass — of all things — and
then proceeded to play golf during
the tournament.
But no more. It's become
increasingly unacceptable to duck
Wimbledon for fear of making a
fool of oneself. In recognition of
this, the seeding committee has
gone almost strictly according to
the computer rankings. Several
clay-court specialists, notably
Spain's Sergi Bruguera, are
seeded highly but aren't likely to
see the light of week two.
Agassi, who had a cup of coffee
at Wimbledon back in 1987 and
hasn't returned since, isn't given
much of a chance despite reaching
the finals of the last three Grand
Slam events he's entered. The
reason cuts to the heart of Wim
bledon's essence — the grass
courts.
The green stuff is the fastest
outdoor surface and thus strongly
favors the big hitters. If a player is
used to long rallies and drawn-out
points, Wimbledon will do him, or
her, in.
A common misconception is
that, to win the tournament, one
has to play scrvc-and-volley ten
nis. People believe that fast courts
mean fast points and serve-and
vollcy is as fast a way to end a
point as any.
Oddly enough, though, the
biggest problem with grass courts
isn't their speed so much as their
unpredictability. The ball doesn't
always bounce true on grass —
sometimes it doesn't bounce much
at all.
What serve-and-volley does for
the would-be Wimbledon winner
is take the surface out of play. Hit
a big serve, which your opponent
will have trouble with as it skids
along the ground, then come in
and take the ball out of the air
with a volley.
No nasty bald spots to worry
about nor any bad hops. But a fel
low named Bjorn Borg won five
Wimbledons from the baseline,
the region Agassi calls home. Borg
was able to accomplish the feat
because he was so smooth and
steady that a tricky bounce just
meant an adjustment, not the end
of the point.
A clay-courter, like Bruguera,
isn't used to the low ball he'll be
receiving at Wimbledon. And he
doesn't possess the lethal ground
strokes needed to make the most
of the slick surface — even from

the baseline.
Given Agassi's dearth of grass
court experience, it is reasonable
to argue that he'd have a tough
time judging the flight of the ball.
But given his incredibly powerful
groundstrokes, and the fact that
he has one of the fastest serves on
the tour, he's the kind of baseliner
who can make some noise at Wim
bledon.
The big flaw with this grand
event is that a serve-and-volleyer
who has a marginal all-around
game can win at the All-England
Club. If it were truly the most
important tournament, only a great
player should be able win it.
In recent years, though, we've
witnessed a number of less-than
great players walk off with the tro
phy. When Boris Becker won his
first of three Wimbledon crowns,
for instance, he was merely a big
hitter who liked to dive on the
grass and roll around. Today he is
a complete player, but back then
he was no more than, say, Pat
Cash.
Cash, a journeyman pro, also
won Wimbledon, back in 1987. He
hasn't won anything since, mind
you, but he is forever the winner
of what is allegedly the Grand
Slam tournament.
The flip side to this mediocre
male-champion phenomenon is
that the women, who can some
times lull spectators to sleep with
soporific baseline rallies, are
forced to play aggressive tennis to
win at Wimbledon.
Even though the tournament
won't be graced by the injured
Monica Seles, the world's No. 1
player, the women are sure to play
spirited tennis.
And, if past is prologue, the
men will provide their share of
thrills as well. Borg's comeback
attempt hasn't yet brought him
back to Wimbledon but John
McEnroe — Borg's old nemesis
— is going to try to spin some of
the old magic once again.
Now, if only someone could do
something about the rain ...
