If you haven't yet begun to hit
the theaters for your annual
summer movie fix, you've got a
lot of catching up to do. Since
Memorial Day weekend — the
traditional start of the Hollywood
summer film season — nearly
one-third of the 60-plus pictures
scheduled for release before
Labor Day have already exploded,
and in some cases fizzled, in the
theaters.
In the interest of helping you
prepare for your summer movie
odyssey, here's a quick recap of
notable films that have already
been released, as well as a preview
of this summer's intriguing yet-to
come pictures.
This summer's movies began
on a worrisome note with "Hud
son Hawk," the Bruce Willis flick
that critics hated and audiences
ignored. "Hawk" is quickly flying
out of the theaters as other films
take their shot at becoming this
year's "Batman," the 1989 mon
ster summer blockbuster.
Another blockbuster that isn't:
"Backdraft," Ron Howard's
homage to firefighters. "Back
draft" features stunning visual
effects in the fire sequences, but
its plot is lukewarm at best.
After the success of last year's
"women-oriented" films, notably
"Pretty Woman" and "Ghost,"
Hollywood is trying to cash in this
year with pictures geared toward
similar female audiences. "Thelnia
and Louise," a smart, entertaining

film starring Susan Sarandon and
Geena Davis, has a definite femi
nist slant that has stimulated
debate among critics and audi
ences alike. Yet despite the con
troversy, it's one of the best movies
released so far.
"Soapdish" also hopes to tap
the female audience by satirizing
soap operas, a traditionally
woman-based market. This comi
cal roller-coaster ride of nearly
slapstick proportions is entertain
ing for anyone who likes to laugh.
Mixing comedy with the search
for self-enlightenment is "City
Slickers," starring Billy Crystal,
Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby as
three men working out their
midlife crises via a fantasy-camp
style cattle drive.
Spike Lee's latest venture,
"Jungle Fever," explores an inter
racial relationship between a
black architect (Wesley Snipes)
and his Italian-American secre
tary (Annabelle Sciorra). (See
review)
"Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves" has been billing itself as
an intense action-drama along the
lines of, well, "Batman." But
unfortunately, Kevin Costner's
turn as the Bandit of Sherwood
Forest is instead a disappointing
jumble that nevertheless has many
audiences cheering. (See review)
Another action picture, but
one marked with the Disney
touch, is Walt Disney's "The
Rocketeer." After its months-long
hype as the potential hit of the
summer, the picture is actually a
let-down. (See review)

Hot on the heels of her broken
engagement with Kiefer Suther
land is Julia Roberts' latest
endeavor, "Dying Young." This
picture has more problems than
Roberts, with worries over the
misleading title, (Who wants to see
Roberts die?) and whether the
ending should be upbeat or sad.
Originally slated as a September
release, Twentieth Century Fox
threw caution to the wind and
released the film last Friday. (See
review)
None of the releases so far has
staked its claim as the Gonzo
Movie Hit of Summer 1991,
although either "Robin Hood" or
"City Slickers" is projected to be
the first summer movie this year
to top $100 million. But with
nearly 50 films still in the wings,
the season may have a few sur
prises left in store for eager audi
ences.
With that, here's a look at more
interesting upcoming films, both
potential box office smashes and
lesser films that may still cause a
stir.
How many films can claim they
are better known by their sequel
number than by their title?
"Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of
Fear," starting to be known simply
as "2 1/2," opens tomorrow. Leslie
Nielsen continues the adventures
of Lt. Frank Drebin, who tries to
foil an energy conspiracy. Look for
lots of slapstick along the way.
In a similar vein is "Hot Shots:
An Important Movie!" directed by
Jim Abrahams, one of the co-cre
ators of "Airplane!" and "Naked

Gun." "Hot Shots" stars Charlie
Sheen in a spoof of Navy pilot
films like "Top Gun."
One of the most eagerly antici
pated films of the summer, "Ter
minator 2: Judgment Day," opens
next Wednesday, just in time for
the Fourth of July weekend. "T2"
stars Arnold Schwarzenegger
reprising his role as the unstop
pable killing machine.
"T2" takes place 10 years after
the time of the original "Termina
tor." Sarah Conner, the woman
stalked by the Terminator in the
first film, has given birth to her
son, John, who is destined to lead
the humans in a rebellion against
the machines that take over the
earth after the nuclear holocaust
on Aug. 29, 1997: Judgment Day.
Rumored to have cost between
$75 and $10() million, "Terminator
2: Judgment Day" is supposedly
the most expensive production in
history. Movie audiences are
eager to see if all that cash and all
the hype is worth their $6.50.
Last year's hot movie couple,
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore
of "Ghost," both have separate
new films coming out this summer.
Moore is continuing in the spiri
tual vein with "The Butcher's
Wife," a film about a clairvoyant
in Greenwich Village. The dark
haired Moore sports a strawberry
blond dye job in this picture, per
haps to make her seem more ethe
real.
Swayze, on the other hand,

does a 180-degree turn from his
role last year as the ultra-nice
dead guy in "Ghost." In "Point
Break," he portrays Bodhi, a
"mystical master surfer" who
helps rebel FBI agent Johnny
Utah (Keanu Reeves) investigate
a series of bank robberies.
Reeves has obviously been a
busy man. In addition to "Point
Break," he is once again donning
his black vest to portray Ted in
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey,"
the sequel to their 1989 "Excellent
Adventure." In this edition, righ
teous dudes Reeves and Alex
Winter take their time-traveling
phone booth "to hell and back."
Party on, dude.
John Candy also does double
duty this season, appearing in
"Only the Lonely," a forgettable
early summer release, and in
"Delirious," scheduled for
August. The second soap opera
based film this season, "Deliri
ous" features Candy as a soap
opera writer who magically ends
up living in his own television
world after a car accident.
The other lovable big guy of the
movies, John Goodman, can be
seen this summer in "Barton
Fink." This film had the dubious
distinction of beating out Spike
Lee's "Jungle Fever" for the top
prize at the Cannes Film Festival
this year. "Barton Fink" also stars
John Tlirturro in the title role as a

screenwriter battling writer's
block in the same seedy hotel as
Goodman.
"Doc Hollywood" is a comedy
starring Michael J. Fox, every
body's favorite little guy. Well,
OK, maybe not everybody's
favorite. He plays a cocky plastic
surgeon headed for California to
make big bucks, but he ends up
stuck in a rural Southern town.
The previews for this one have
featured Fox and a pig, and one
scene reportedly has Fox and
leading lady Julie Warner scatter
ing their urine in the woods to dis
courage deer.
On a decidedly less humorous
note, two movies deal with a pro
fessional man struck down by dis
ease or injury. In"The Doctor,"
William Hurt portrays Dr. Jack
MacKee, a heart surgeon who
contracts cancer. The film is
directed by Randa Haines, who
also directed Hurt in "Children of
a Lesser God."
Harrison Ford stars in the
other struggle-with-adversity flick,
"Regarding Henry." Ford plays
Henry, a lawyer who finds himself
in the crossfire of a robbery. His
injuries force him to examine his
life, from a new perspective, as he
relcarns everything from how to
read to how to be a father.
Adversity of another kind fig
ures prominently in "Boyz N the
Hood," a drama about coming of

age in black urban America. The
film stars rap artist Ice Cube (not
to be confused with Ice-T, who
starred in "New Jack City" earlier
this year), Cuba Gooding Jr. and
Morris Chestnut. Its filming took
place in South Central Los Ange
les, where 23-year-old writer
director John Singleton was

raised.
The award for the most diffi
cult title pronunciation goes to
"V.I. Warshawski," an adaptation
of Sara Paretsky's mystery novel
series. Kathleen Turner stars in
the title role, investigating the
murder of her 13-year-old client's
father.

Finally, no movie preview guide
would be complete without "Sub
urban Commando." Space trav
eler Hulk Hogan's spaceship
crashes, so he moves in with Shel
ley "Popcye" Duvall and Christo
pher "Back to the Future" Lloyd.
Honest, this is a real film, sched
uled to debut in August.


Mlkkl Allen comforts her father, Harrison Ford, in "Regarding Henry," opening July 10. Ford plays a
lawyer who needs to be shot In the head and reduced to the mental state of a child In order to rediscover
what's Important In life.

"Soapdish" also hopes to tap
the female audience by satirizing
soap operas, a traditionally
woman-based market. This comi
cal roller-coaster ride of nearly
slapstick proportions is entertain
ing for anyone who likes to laugh.
Mixing comedy with the search
for self-enlightenment is "City
Slickers," starring Billy Crystal,
Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby as
three men working out their
midlife crises via a fantasy-camp
style cattle drive.
Spike Lee's latest venture,
"Jungle Fever," explores an inter
racial relationship between a
black architect (Wesley Snipes)
and his Italian-American secre
tary (Annabelle Sciorra). (See
review)
"Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves" has been billing itself as
an intense action-drama along the
lines of, well, "Batman." But
unfortunately, Kevin Costner's
turn as the Bandit of Sherwood
Forest is instead a disappointing
jumble that nevertheless has many
audiences cheering. (See review)
Another action picture, but
one marked with the Disney
touch, is Walt Disney's "The
Rocketeer." After its months-long
hype as the potential hit of the
summer, the picture is actually a
let-down. (See review)

Hot on the heels of her broken
engagement with Kiefer Suther
land is Julia Roberts' latest
endeavor, "Dying Young." This
picture has more problems than
Roberts, with worries over the
misleading title, (Who wants to see
Roberts die?) and whether the
ending should be upbeat or sad.
Originally slated as a September
release, Twentieth Century Fox
threw caution to the wind and
released the film last Friday. (See
review)
None of the releases so far has
staked its claim as the Gonzo
Movie Hit of Summer 1991,
although either "Robin Hood" or
"City Slickers" is projected to be
the first summer movie this year
to top $100 million. But with
nearly 50 films still in the wings,
the season may have a few sur
prises left in store for eager audi
ences.
With that, here's a look at more
interesting upcoming films, both
potential box office smashes and
lesser films that may still cause a
stir.
How many films can claim they
are better known by their sequel
number than by their title?
"Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of
Fear," starting to be known simply
as "2 1/2," opens tomorrow. Leslie
Nielsen continues the adventures
of Lt. Frank Drebin, who tries to
foil an energy conspiracy. Look for
lots of slapstick along the way.
In a similar vein is "Hot Shots:
An Important Movie!" directed by
Jim Abrahams, one of the co-cre
ators of "Airplane!" and "Naked

Gun." "Hot Shots" stars Charlie
Sheen in a spoof of Navy pilot
films like "Top Gun."
One of the most eagerly antici
pated films of the summer, "Ter
minator 2: Judgment Day," opens
next Wednesday, just in time for
the Fourth of July weekend. "T2"
stars Arnold Schwarzenegger
reprising his role as the unstop
pable killing machine.
"T2" takes place 10 years after
the time of the original "Termina
tor." Sarah Conner, the woman
stalked by the Terminator in the
first film, has given birth to her
son, John, who is destined to lead
the humans in a rebellion against
the machines that take over the
earth after the nuclear holocaust
on Aug. 29, 1997: Judgment Day.
Rumored to have cost between
$75 and $10() million, "Terminator
2: Judgment Day" is supposedly
the most expensive production in
history. Movie audiences are
eager to see if all that cash and all
the hype is worth their $6.50.
Last year's hot movie couple,
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore
of "Ghost," both have separate
new films coming out this summer.
Moore is continuing in the spiri
tual vein with "The Butcher's
Wife," a film about a clairvoyant
in Greenwich Village. The dark
haired Moore sports a strawberry
blond dye job in this picture, per
haps to make her seem more ethe
real.
Swayze, on the other hand,

does a 180-degree turn from his
role last year as the ultra-nice
dead guy in "Ghost." In "Point
Break," he portrays Bodhi, a
"mystical master surfer" who
helps rebel FBI agent Johnny
Utah (Keanu Reeves) investigate
a series of bank robberies.
Reeves has obviously been a
busy man. In addition to "Point
Break," he is once again donning
his black vest to portray Ted in
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey,"
the sequel to their 1989 "Excellent
Adventure." In this edition, righ
teous dudes Reeves and Alex
Winter take their time-traveling
phone booth "to hell and back."
Party on, dude.
John Candy also does double
duty this season, appearing in
"Only the Lonely," a forgettable
early summer release, and in
"Delirious," scheduled for
August. The second soap opera
based film this season, "Deliri
ous" features Candy as a soap
opera writer who magically ends
up living in his own television
world after a car accident.
The other lovable big guy of the
movies, John Goodman, can be
seen this summer in "Barton
Fink." This film had the dubious
distinction of beating out Spike
Lee's "Jungle Fever" for the top
prize at the Cannes Film Festival
this year. "Barton Fink" also stars
John Tlirturro in the title role as a

screenwriter battling writer's
block in the same seedy hotel as
Goodman.
"Doc Hollywood" is a comedy
starring Michael J. Fox, every
body's favorite little guy. Well,
OK, maybe not everybody's
favorite. He plays a cocky plastic
surgeon headed for California to
make big bucks, but he ends up
stuck in a rural Southern town.
The previews for this one have
featured Fox and a pig, and one
scene reportedly has Fox and
leading lady Julie Warner scatter
ing their urine in the woods to dis
courage deer.
On a decidedly less humorous
note, two movies deal with a pro
fessional man struck down by dis
ease or injury. In"The Doctor,"
William Hurt portrays Dr. Jack
MacKee, a heart surgeon who
contracts cancer. The film is
directed by Randa Haines, who
also directed Hurt in "Children of
a Lesser God."
Harrison Ford stars in the
other struggle-with-adversity flick,
"Regarding Henry." Ford plays
Henry, a lawyer who finds himself
in the crossfire of a robbery. His
injuries force him to examine his
life, from a new perspective, as he
relcarns everything from how to
read to how to be a father.
Adversity of another kind fig
ures prominently in "Boyz N the
Hood," a drama about coming of

age in black urban America. The
film stars rap artist Ice Cube (not
to be confused with Ice-T, who
starred in "New Jack City" earlier
this year), Cuba Gooding Jr. and
Morris Chestnut. Its filming took
place in South Central Los Ange
les, where 23-year-old writer
director John Singleton was

raised.
The award for the most diffi
cult title pronunciation goes to
"V.I. Warshawski," an adaptation
of Sara Paretsky's mystery novel
series. Kathleen Turner stars in
the title role, investigating the
murder of her 13-year-old client's
father.

Finally, no movie preview guide
would be complete without "Sub
urban Commando." Space trav
eler Hulk Hogan's spaceship
crashes, so he moves in with Shel
ley "Popcye" Duvall and Christo
pher "Back to the Future" Lloyd.
Honest, this is a real film, sched
uled to debut in August.


Mlkkl Allen comforts her father, Harrison Ford, in "Regarding Henry," opening July 10. Ford plays a
lawyer who needs to be shot In the head and reduced to the mental state of a child In order to rediscover
what's Important In life.
If you haven't yet begun to hit
the theaters for your annual
summer movie fix, you've got a
lot of catching up to do. Since
Memorial Day weekend — the
traditional start of the Hollywood
summer film season — nearly
one-third of the 60-plus pictures
scheduled for release before
Labor Day have already exploded,
and in some cases fizzled, in the
theaters.
In the interest of helping you
prepare for your summer movie
odyssey, here's a quick recap of
notable films that have already
been released, as well as a preview
of this summer's intriguing yet-to
come pictures.
This summer's movies began
on a worrisome note with "Hud
son Hawk," the Bruce Willis flick
that critics hated and audiences
ignored. "Hawk" is quickly flying
out of the theaters as other films
take their shot at becoming this
year's "Batman," the 1989 mon
ster summer blockbuster.
Another blockbuster that isn't:
"Backdraft," Ron Howard's
homage to firefighters. "Back
draft" features stunning visual
effects in the fire sequences, but
its plot is lukewarm at best.
After the success of last year's
"women-oriented" films, notably
"Pretty Woman" and "Ghost,"
Hollywood is trying to cash in this
year with pictures geared toward
similar female audiences. "Thelnia
and Louise," a smart, entertaining

film starring Susan Sarandon and
Geena Davis, has a definite femi
nist slant that has stimulated
debate among critics and audi
ences alike. Yet despite the con
troversy, it's one of the best movies
released so far.
"Soapdish" also hopes to tap

None of the releases so far has
staked its claim as the Gonzo
Movie Hit of Summer 1991,
although either "Robin Hood" or
"City Slickers" is projected to be
the first summer movie this year
to top $100 million. But with
nearly 50 films still in the wings,
the season may have a few sur
prises left in store for eager audi
ences.
With that, here's a look at more
interesting upcoming films, both
potential box office smashes and
lesser films that may still cause a
stir.
How many films can claim they
are better known by their sequel
number than by their title?
"Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of
Fear," starting to be known simply
as "2 1/2," opens tomorrow. Leslie
Nielsen continues the adventures
of Lt. Frank Drebin, who tries to
foil an energy conspiracy. Look for
lots of slapstick along the way.
In a similar vein is "Hot Shots:
An Important Movie!" directed by
Jim Abrahams, one of the co-cre
ators of "Airplane!" and "Naked

Gun." "Hot Shots" stars Charlie
Sheen in a spoof of Navy pilot
films like "Top Gun."
One of the most eagerly antici
pated films of the summer, "Ter
minator 2: Judgment Day," opens
next Wednesday, just in time for
the Fourth of July weekend. "T2"
stars Arnold Schwarzenegger
reprising his role as the unstop
pable killing machine.
"T2" takes place 10 years after
the time of the original "Termina
tor." Sarah Conner, the woman
stalked by the Terminator in the
first film, has given birth to her
son, John, who is destined to lead
the humans in a rebellion against
the machines that take over the
earth after the nuclear holocaust
on Aug. 29, 1997: Judgment Day.
Rumored to have cost between
$75 and $10() million, "Terminator
2: Judgment Day" is supposedly
the most expensive production in
history. Movie audiences are
eager to see if all that cash and all
the hype is worth their $6.50.
Last year's hot movie couple,
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore
of "Ghost," both have separate
new films coming out this summer.
Moore is continuing in the spiri
tual vein with "The Butcher's
Wife," a film about a clairvoyant
in Greenwich Village. The dark
haired Moore sports a strawberry
blond dye job in this picture, per
haps to make her seem more ethe
real.
Swayze, on the other hand,

does a 180-degree turn from his
role last year as the ultra-nice
dead guy in "Ghost." In "Point
Break," he portrays Bodhi, a
"mystical master surfer" who
helps rebel FBI agent Johnny
Utah (Keanu Reeves) investigate
a series of bank robberies.
Reeves has obviously been a
busy man. In addition to "Point
Break," he is once again donning
his black vest to portray Ted in
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey,"
the sequel to their 1989 "Excellent
Adventure." In this edition, righ
teous dudes Reeves and Alex
Winter take their time-traveling
phone booth "to hell and back."
Party on, dude.
John Candy also does double
duty this season, appearing in
"Only the Lonely," a forgettable
early summer release, and in
"Delirious," scheduled for
August. The second soap opera
based film this season, "Deliri
ous" features Candy as a soap
opera writer who magically ends
up living in his own television
world after a car accident.
The other lovable big guy of the
movies, John Goodman, can be
seen this summer in "Barton
Fink." This film had the dubious
distinction of beating out Spike
Lee's "Jungle Fever" for the top
prize at the Cannes Film Festival
this year. "Barton Fink" also stars
John Tlirturro in the title role as a

screenwriter battling writer's
block in the same seedy hotel as
Goodman.
"Doc Hollywood" is a comedy
starring Michael J. Fox, every
body's favorite little guy. Well,
OK, maybe not everybody's
favorite. He plays a cocky plastic
surgeon headed for California to
make big bucks, but he ends up
stuck in a rural Southern town.
The previews for this one have
featured Fox and a pig, and one
scene reportedly has Fox and
leading lady Julie Warner scatter
ing their urine in the woods to dis
courage deer.
On a decidedly less humorous
note, two movies deal with a pro
fessional man struck down by dis
ease or injury. In"The Doctor,"
William Hurt portrays Dr. Jack
MacKee, a heart surgeon who
contracts cancer. The film is
directed by Randa Haines, who
also directed Hurt in "Children of
a Lesser God."
Harrison Ford stars in the
other struggle-with-adversity flick,
"Regarding Henry." Ford plays
Henry, a lawyer who finds himself
in the crossfire of a robbery. His
injuries force him to examine his
life, from a new perspective, as he
relcarns everything from how to
read to how to be a father.
Adversity of another kind fig
ures prominently in "Boyz N the
Hood," a drama about coming of

age in black urban America. The
film stars rap artist Ice Cube (not
to be confused with Ice-T, who
starred in "New Jack City" earlier
this year), Cuba Gooding Jr. and
Morris Chestnut. Its filming took
place in South Central Los Ange
les, where 23-year-old writer
director John Singleton was

raised.
The award for the most diffi
cult title pronunciation goes to
"V.I. Warshawski," an adaptation
of Sara Paretsky's mystery novel
series. Kathleen Turner stars in
the title role, investigating the
murder of her 13-year-old client's
father.

Finally, no movie preview guide
would be complete without "Sub
urban Commando." Space trav
eler Hulk Hogan's spaceship
crashes, so he moves in with Shel
ley "Popcye" Duvall and Christo
pher "Back to the Future" Lloyd.
Honest, this is a real film, sched
uled to debut in August.


Mlkkl Allen comforts her father, Harrison Ford, in "Regarding Henry," opening July 10. Ford plays a
lawyer who needs to be shot In the head and reduced to the mental state of a child In order to rediscover
what's Important In life.
