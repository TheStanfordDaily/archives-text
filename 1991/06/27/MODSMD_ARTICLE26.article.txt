He's No Tracy
"The Rocketeer," starring Bill
Campbell, Alan Arkin, Jennifer
Connelly, Paul Sorvino and
Timothy Dalton
The folks at Walt Disney don't
want you to compare "The Rocke
teer" with last year's "Dick Tracy."
So allow me to do it for you, since
"The Rocketeer," another adven
ture film based on comics, cries
out for a sadly unfavorable com
parison.
"Dick Tracy" is a wonderful
piece of eye candy. The film is
worth watching because of the
stunning way the production
design captures the feel of a comic
strip, both with its simplistic color
scheme and with the wonderfully
rich villains. When the story bogs
down (as it frequently does),
there's always the great look of the
film to fall back on.
"The Rocketeer" is "Dick
Tracy" without the color. At its
core lies a basically interesting
premise — a down-on-his-luck
pilot finds a top-secret rocket jet
pack and is inadvertently thrust
into the role of hero.
But the Rocketeer, as he is
dubbed by the press, rarely uses
the jet pack in the film, and when
he does it's with such reluctance
that all the fun is taken out of it.
All the wonder he displays when
first trying to figure out how to use
the pack is instantly lost when he
starts to realize that everyone
from the Mafia to the FBI is chas
ing him to recover the pack, stolen
from Howard Hughes.
Here's where the essential
problem arises. Whereas "Dick
Tracy" was in no way embedded in
reality, existing only in the fabri
cated world of the comics, "The
Rocketeer" tries to give us a
detail-perfect period piece of 1938
Los Angeles.
This serves to push the color
palette of the movie heavily into
browns. The Rocketeer himself

could be rendered entirely in
sepia tones. While this may be
faithful to Dave Stevens' original
graphic novel, it doesn't make for
interesting viewing.
By setting "The Rocketeer" in
realistic terms, the film makers
strip away much of the fantasy ele
ment that would heighten the fun
this type of film needs. The sim
plistic dialogue, the 'aw-shucks'
hero (played by puppyish Bill
Campbell), the nastier-than-nasty
Nazi villain (a wonderful romp for
Timothy "James Bond" Dalton)
all become difficult to swallow
when weighed down with the bur
den of reality.
Despite the fact that the film is
essentially a vapid bore, young

kids should get a huge kick out of
it. It would be difficult to name a
picture better suited for today's
children — enough action to keep
Nintendo warriors happy, but
without a lot of baggage to sort
through and certainly none of the
disturbing violence found in most
action films.
There's nothing really wrong
with "The Rocketeer." It's just
that this sort of Disney-purified
science fiction has very little to
offer audiences older than, say, 12
and even that may be pushing it.
I'd suggest renting "Dick Tracy"
and watching it on a screen big
enough to capture the rich pro
duction design instead.

Prince of Confusion
"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"
starring Kevin Costner, Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Morgan
Freeman and Christian Slater
"Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves" is an attempt to create a
new style of Robin Hood movies:
rowdy and action-packed, yet sen
sitive and even somewhat witty
and intelligent. The movie is
beautifully set in medieval Eng
land and both the cinematography
and costuming give the impression
of an epic fairy tale. A wanna-be
"Princess Bride," if you will.

'Robin Hood 9 tries to
set up an action
packed yet intelligent
fairy tale, but loses
itself in the process.
It's a good idea that is
never fully developed
and hence half-baked.

The result, however, is a film
that never quite figures out where
it is going. This confused picture
breaks down into a rock-'em,
sock-'em slugfest with lots of neat
special effects combined with a
New Age, almost "politically cor
rect" message: Follow your
dreams to freedom.
The idea is there, but the focus
is not. The movie's makers failed
to decide whether they wanted
pure action-adventure or a film
that people would take seriously.
Kevin Costner, Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio and Alan Rickman
play the usual clich6 characters of
studly man, vulnerable woman
and evil villain, respectively. The
actors play their parts well —
especially Rickman, who seems
almost comical with his tense, ner
vous behavior — but none of the
characters comes across as believ
able.

able.
Screenwriters Pen Densham
and John Watson could have
developed more interesting,
multi-sided characters instead of
all-good or all-bad stick figures.
The idea of a hero with a dark
side, such as Batman, could have
effectively been applied to Robin
Hood, but this Robin comes
across as perfect to a fault and
therefore empty.
The supporting characters,
including Morgan Freeman as
Robin Hood's humorous Moorish
sidekick and Christian Slater as a
doubting member of Robin
Hood's band, actually have better
roles than the stars themselves.
Freeman is great as a nonchalant
outsider from a foreign culture.
A surprising cameo appear
ance at the end of the movie is
also quite funny, perhaps the sin
gle best moment of the film. On
the whole, the supporting players
provide a welcome relief from the
triteness of the rest of the film,
lending the movie what little cre
ativity it displays.
"Robin Hood" tries to set up
an action-packed yet intelligent
fairy tale, but loses itself in the
process. It's a good idea that is
never fully developed and hence
half-baked. Upon leaving the film,
an audiencc member may feel like
saying "What's the point?"

Lee's new "Fever"
"Jungle Fever," starring Wesley
Snipes, Annabelle Sciorra, Samuel
L. Johnson, Ixmetta McKee and
Spike l^ee
When it comes to love, it can be
a jungle out there. But "Jungle
Fever," Spike Lee's latest film,
does little to cure — or openly
examine — the problems of inter
racial relations in American soci
ety.
Ostensibly a film about interra
cial attraction, "Jungle Fever"
touches also on gender issues,
drug abuse and parent-child rela
tions. And, while it's relieving to
find a thought-provoking film, it's

Bill Campbell stars in the colorless new Disney film, "The Rocke
teer." Here, Campbell is reduced to walking to conserve fuel in his
way-cool Jet pack. What a bummer.
