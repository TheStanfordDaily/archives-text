# Second-Choice Videos
## 
### 
You go to the video store and spot the title of a
new movie you're just dying to see. But when you
scour the shelves, all the copies are checked out.
Now you're faced with the dilemma: What video
should you get instead?
"Second Choice Videos," a new weekly series,
offers up some interesting (if not downright
weird) alternatives.
This week, in honor of Julia Roberts' new
movie "Dying Young," as well as her broken
engagement with beau Kiefer Sutherland, The
Weekly offers the selected Julia and Kiefer Col
lection.

Hers:
• "Mystic Pizza" — Julia's first significant role
and probably still her best.
• "Steel Magnolias" — Julia does her own version
of dying young.
• "Pretty Woman" — Oh, if you must.
• "Flatliners" — Julia and Kiefer dying young
together!
His:
• "The Lost Boys" — Kiefer at his drugged-out,
bleary-eyed best, playing the nasty leader of the
vampire teens.
• "Stand By Me" — Once again, Kiefer's the bad
guy, as one of the nasty older brothers who bullies
Wil Wheaton and friends.
• "Young Guns" and "Young Guns II" — Kiefer
plays the philosophical Doc Scurlock, poet and
outlaw. He's actually not too nasty in these films.
• "Flatliners" — He's still the bad guy, playing a
nasty medical student who talks his pals into tak
ing joyrides into death.
