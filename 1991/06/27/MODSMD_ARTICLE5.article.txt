As I sneak out to hand this
copy in to my editors, I've
survived 72 hours in the
most dangerous place I've ever
been.
By the second day in my new
apartment, I had already started
to feel that I was not completely
safe in my new surroundings.
There was a 230-pound maniac
from Oakland running amok with
a loaded gun in a stolen car. My
Bolivian housemate, Tito, son of
the owner of a "tobacco" company
back home, had been receiving
threatening early morning phone
calls since the moment I arrived.
He got extremely disturbed when
he heard about the Oakland/Hay
ward heroin bust on Friday. I was
eating breakfast with him when
his eyes caught the headline. It
was straight out of "Three's Com
pany": He gagged, sputtered and
screamed the Spanish equivalent
of a slang, "Oh, my goodness!"
To top it off, my room is the
first in recorded history to face
exactly due east and follow the
sun. I have a wall-length sliding
glass window through which I can
witness this process. The phe
nomenon, although interesting
astronomically, ensures that I am
awake every morning as soon as
the sun pokes its head over the
horizon. Its blinding light and
boiling rays have immersed me in
a sea of sweat and caused bub
bling burns to develop on my
back.
These problems could have
been lessened if I had been given
a key to my new place, but as I
arrived half an hour after the time
I had stipulated on the first day of
my "lease," my subleaser had left
(fled?) for vacation, taking my key
with him. As a result, I had to
break into my home on the day I
arrived.
This might be chalked up to my
inherent paranoia, but why did I
feel from the tone of his voice
when he called from Arizona the
next day that he had indeed been
escaping from this place? This
man couldn't even stay in the
same time zone before calling. He
seemed a levelheaded guy, so it
made me nervous when he asked a
second time, "You're sure you're
all right?"
When I drove up the secluded,
windy road with my groceries on
the second day, there were two
San Mateo County Police cars
(complete with two San Mateo
County sheriffs, fully armed and
wardrobed in polyester suits) in
my driveway.
Tito, who was chatting with the
disgruntled-looking officers,
assured me with a smile and a
wink that everything was all right,
so I went inside with my groceries.
I couldn't help noticing one of the
cops giving me a sidelong glance
which hinted of sympathy. I was in
no mood to inquire about it.
Things were getting weird,
true, but I was immersed in that
Chevy Chase/omnipotent opti
mism phase that fathers get into
when they've just bought a new
grill, "This is my new place," I
thought, "and it is beautiful."
So I didn't ask — at least not
right away — why there were
walkie-talkies belching in my
kitchen as the local cops phoned
my landlord, who was away for an
unspecified number of weeks in
Boston, to find out why a man who
had been living in my landlord's

house for four years had stolen his
car along with the biggest gun east
of the Pasadena Freeway, a 22-cal
iber beauty that clearly wasn't reg
istered but certainly was loaded.
I was beginning to feel a little
unsafe.
"Who?" my landlord asked
when I was finally on the phone
with him, after having first gin
gerly mumbling something to the
law about a guy the cops in San
Diego gunned down for lunging at
them with a closed safety pin, and
then snatching the phone in the
ensuing confusion.
"Doug, your new tenant," I
replied with a ray of hope, think
ing that this whole thing had been
a hideous hallucination, that I had
the wrong house, that I could con
fidently tell my parents, "Ha, ha.
No, Mom and Dad, that was not
my house you read about in The
New York Times."
I had only met the transient
landlord once, when I came to
look at the house and put down
the deposit. It seemed like a per
fectly reasonable place — good
location, big rooms, nearby hiking
trails. "Deer sometimes walk in
the backyard," the ad read. He
had told me to show up on the
20th.
"Oh, yeah, listen kid, don't
worry about the law; they and I
have a special relationship. About
your key... yeah, it's probably best
if you lock up all the time, you get
me, son? Make a copy of Tito's,
and I'll give you one, if 1... er ...
when I get back."
I tried to discuss the issue of a
key with Tito, but he appeared
highly nervous and had trouble
focusing on the conversation. He
seemed to be scanning the wall
behind me and wanted to discuss
other subjects.
How could I possibly explain to
the authorities why I was standing
in the kitchen of an apartment for
which I had no written lease, let
alone a key, listening to a lecture
on the pros and cons of Latin
American democracy from a sus
piciously paranoid Menlo College
physics major with a price on his
head?
So now it's the third morning.
After I return from trying to
explain to my frothing editors why
my delay was unavoidable, I will
drive up the driveway, half-expect
ing to see the blood-spattered
remains of my housemates drip
ping on my rug as the cartel boys
and a lunatic from Oakland gun it
out for "Chief Bad Guy" honors.
Should I be worried?

a key to my new place, but as I
arrived half an hour after the time
I had stipulated on the first day of
my "lease," my subleaser had left
(fled?) for vacation, taking my key
with him. As a result, I had to
break into my home on the day I
arrived.
This might be chalked up to my
inherent paranoia, but why did I
feel from the tone of his voice
when he called from Arizona the
next day that he had indeed been
escaping from this place? This
man couldn't even stay in the
same time zone before calling. He
seemed a levelheaded guy, so it
made me nervous when he asked a
second time, "You're sure you're
all right?"
When I drove up the secluded,
windy road with my groceries on
the second day, there were two
San Mateo County Police cars
(complete with two San Mateo
County sheriffs, fully armed and
wardrobed in polyester suits) in
my driveway.
Tito, who was chatting with the
disgruntled-looking officers,
assured me with a smile and a
wink that everything was all right,
so I went inside with my groceries.
I couldn't help noticing one of the
cops giving me a sidelong glance
which hinted of sympathy. I was in
no mood to inquire about it.
Things were getting weird,
true, but I was immersed in that
Chevy Chase/omnipotent opti
mism phase that fathers get into
when they've just bought a new
grill, "This is my new place," I
thought, "and it is beautiful."
So I didn't ask — at least not
right away — why there were
walkie-talkies belching in my
kitchen as the local cops phoned
my landlord, who was away for an
unspecified number of weeks in
Boston, to find out why a man who
had been living in my landlord's

house for four years had stolen his
car along with the biggest gun east
of the Pasadena Freeway, a 22-cal
iber beauty that clearly wasn't reg
istered but certainly was loaded.
I was beginning to feel a little
unsafe.
"Who?" my landlord asked
when I was finally on the phone
with him, after having first gin
gerly mumbling something to the
law about a guy the cops in San
Diego gunned down for lunging at
them with a closed safety pin, and
then snatching the phone in the
ensuing confusion.
"Doug, your new tenant," I
replied with a ray of hope, think
ing that this whole thing had been
a hideous hallucination, that I had
the wrong house, that I could con
fidently tell my parents, "Ha, ha.
No, Mom and Dad, that was not
my house you read about in The
New York Times."
I had only met the transient
landlord once, when I came to
look at the house and put down
the deposit. It seemed like a per
fectly reasonable place — good
location, big rooms, nearby hiking
trails. "Deer sometimes walk in
the backyard," the ad read. He
had told me to show up on the
20th.
"Oh, yeah, listen kid, don't
worry about the law; they and I
have a special relationship. About
your key... yeah, it's probably best
if you lock up all the time, you get
me, son? Make a copy of Tito's,
and I'll give you one, if 1... er ...
when I get back."
I tried to discuss the issue of a
key with Tito, but he appeared
highly nervous and had trouble
focusing on the conversation. He
seemed to be scanning the wall
behind me and wanted to discuss
other subjects.
How could I possibly explain to
the authorities why I was standing
in the kitchen of an apartment for
which I had no written lease, let
alone a key, listening to a lecture
on the pros and cons of Latin
American democracy from a sus
piciously paranoid Menlo College
physics major with a price on his
head?
So now it's the third morning.
After I return from trying to
explain to my frothing editors why
my delay was unavoidable, I will
drive up the driveway, half-expect
ing to see the blood-spattered
remains of my housemates drip
ping on my rug as the cartel boys
and a lunatic from Oakland gun it
out for "Chief Bad Guy" honors.
Should I be worried?

As I sneak out to hand this
copy in to my editors, I've
survived 72 hours in the
most dangerous place I've ever
been.
By the second day in my new
apartment, I had already started
to feel that I was not completely
safe in my new surroundings.
There was a 230-pound maniac
from Oakland running amok with
a loaded gun in a stolen car. My
Bolivian housemate, Tito, son of
the owner of a "tobacco" company
back home, had been receiving
threatening early morning phone
calls since the moment I arrived.
He got extremely disturbed when
he heard about the Oakland/Hay
ward heroin bust on Friday. I was
eating breakfast with him when
his eyes caught the headline. It
was straight out of "Three's Com
pany": He gagged, sputtered and
screamed the Spanish equivalent
of a slang, "Oh, my goodness!"
To top it off, my room is the
first in recorded history to face
exactly due east and follow the
sun. I have a wall-length sliding
glass window through which I can
witness this process. The phe
nomenon, although interesting
astronomically, ensures that I am
awake every morning as soon as
the sun pokes its head over the
horizon. Its blinding light and
boiling rays have immersed me in
a sea of sweat and caused bub
bling burns to develop on my
back.
These problems could have
been lessened if I had been given
a key to my new place, but as I
arrived half an hour after the time
I had stipulated on the first day of
my "lease," my subleaser had left
(fled?) for vacation, taking my key
with him. As a result, I had to
