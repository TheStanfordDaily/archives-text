## University needs need-blind admissions 
### 
In the face of a budget crisis that is forcing excru
ciating fiscal choices upon Stanford University
administrators, Stanford should maintain unwa
vering commitment to one program — its policy of
need-blind admissions — at almost any cost.
Given a fiscal crisis that is forcing Provost James
Rosse to slash about 10 percent from the Univer
sity's $400 million operating budget, Stanford's pro
gram of financial-aid grants to undergraduates —
which will total close to $33 million next year —
seems likely to come under scrutiny.
That could force the University to re-evaluate its
commitment to need-blind admissions, a policy
under which students are admitted regardless of
financial need and provided by the University the
money deemed necessary for them to attend.
It's true that the University's budget crisis is forc
ing some difficult choices upon University adminis
trators. Rosse will have to make a series of unenvi
able decisions — none of which are likely to be pop
ular.
But it's hard to imagine a more valuable asset
( than Stanford's need-blind admissions policy. This
'policy resonates with the fundamental feeling that
Access to education should not be limited to those
whose families can pay for it.
But idealism isn't the only reason for maintaining
the current policy. Stanford should maintain need
blind admissions not only because of what it can pro
vide for economically underprivileged students, but
because of what those students can provide for the
University.
Stanford's admissions and financial aid policies of

the last decade are credited with playing a major role
in the increased diversity of Stanford's student body.
During the last seven years, the percentage of stu
dents of color in Stanford's entering classes has
increased from 24 percent in 1984 to 41.3 percent in
1991.
The diversity of Stanford's entering classes has
made its need-blind admissions program a model for
those at other schools.
Many of the undergraduates admitted under it,
who would not otherwise have have been able to
attend Stanford, have played critical roles in events
at the University.
The demand for a curriculum that pays attention
to issues of race and gender and includes non-West
ern thought has received much influential leadership
from these undergraduates. The diversity of Stan
ford's undergraduate student body can be credited
with much of the dynamism and leadership the Uni
versity has displayed in issues of curriculum reform
and multiculturalism.
During a decade in which issues of economic
opportunity and America's racial diversity are likely
to be the topics of national debate, the students that
Stanford admits from underprivileged backgrounds
will be a unique and important asset.
Many of the nation's universities are now facing
fiscal crises that will force them to reassess their
commitment to financial-aid programs and need
blind admissions policies. Stanford should take the
lead by announcing that, in the face of a budget cri
sis, its commitment to need-blind admissions will
