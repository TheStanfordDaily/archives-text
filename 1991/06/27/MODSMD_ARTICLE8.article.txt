At Stanford, football rules the
roost. That's not news. Everyone
knows it. But in my 11 years at
Stanford, I have never seen any
thing as low as what I observed
last week.
I lift weights for health and fit
ness. Our weightroom at Encina
has never been good, but over the
years it has been getting better
and better — until last week,
when it took a sharp turn for the
worse.
T\vo days after Commence
ment, when most students were
safely away, remodeling began on
the prime lifting area of the
weightroom, to convert it into
conference rooms for the varsity
football team. All the special

heavy-duty flooring that had been
newly installed only last January
was simply built over by this con
struction work and so has been
made entirely useless, a pure
waste of money and effort.
No one in the Athletics
Department's office could tell me
who had authorized the new con
struction. After speaking with the
county building inspector, I
learned that as of Monday, no
building permit had been issued
for the work. It is evident to the
eye that no regard for the health
and safety of the users of the gym
has been taken into account in
the construction layout.
Our gym is open for use by
everyone in the Stanford commu
nity, and many of people use it.
All told, the students, staff, fac
ulty and their families, together
with summer visitors, make up a
family of over 1,000 regular users,

a cross section of the Stanford
community.
Somehow it was decided that
the varsity football team needed
more space and could make bet
ter use of our space than we do.
In cases like this, when compet
ing interests are at stake between
general recreational and health
use and varsity use, there is at
present no procedure, it seems,
to mediate fairly and equitably.
So, two days after Commence
ment, when people were away,
they literally cut a hole into the
wall, went in and took our space.
Everyone loves it when the
varsity team wins. I do. You do.
But Stanford football ought to be
a good citizen within the
Stanford community. That may
happen someday, but unfortu
natly it has not happened yet.
