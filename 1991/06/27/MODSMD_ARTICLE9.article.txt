# Recycling: A little effort makes a big difference
## 
### Justin Hayes 
Let me be the 500 th person to
welcome you to Stanford's sum
mer session. If you're new to the
campus, you may have noticed
that there are large green barrels
near many of the garbage cans.
And while noticing these barrels,
you may have asked yourself:
"What the heck is that green bar
rel for?"
Well, the green barrels are for
recycling.
Each day the average Ameri

can throws away about three and a
half pounds of "garbage." In your
lifetime, that means that you will
have tossed out about 90,000
pounds of trash by the time that
you die. If you recycle just a little
bit of that three and a half pounds
every day, you will make a big dif

ference in the long run.
Recycling saves natural re
sources and energy. Reusing a
product requires less energy than
going out and getting a virgin
resource and refining it. Also, less
pollution is produced when recy
cled material is re-refined than
when virgin material is refined for
the first time.
Since less energy is required in
the re-refining process, less car
bon dioxide, the main greenhouse
gas, is produced. Also, since mate
rials that are being recycled have

already been refined once, fewer
and smaller amounts of chemicals
are need in the re-refining pro
cess. This means that fewer pollu
tants are dumped into rivers and
oceans.
For example, every year the
United States produces about 80
billion aluminum cans. Recycling
aluminum cans not only saves pre
cious resources but also cuts
related air pollution by 95 per
cent. Aluminum recycling also
saves 95 percent of the energy
required to make the material

from scratch.
The benefits of recycling are
easy to see, and the act of recy
cling is nearly effortless. So the
next time you head for the
garbage can, ask yourself if any
thing in your hands can be recy
cled. Even if you have to carry it
around for a minute before you
see the appropriate barrel, it
really is worth the effort.
