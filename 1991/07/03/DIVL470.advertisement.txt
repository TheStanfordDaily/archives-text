THE CHRIST IS HERE
WHO IS HE?
A great World Teacher for people of every
religion and no religion—awaited by
Christians as the Christ; by Jews as the
Messiah; by Buddhists as Maitreya Buddha;
by Muslims as the Imam Mahdi; and by
Hindus as Krishna.
A practical man inspiring people throughout
the world, including many world leaders, to
work for sharing, justice, and peace.
WHAT IS HE SAYING?
"The answers to your problems are simple
indeed... without Sharing and Justice, man will
know no peace. Trust in Sharing to relieve the
agony of the world."
.. why wait for My appearance? Why sit still
when the world groans; when men, women and
children die in misery, cast off by their brothers?
There is no greater aspiration than the desire to
serve. Making your act of service the saving of the
starving of the world and help My Plan."
"1 have not come to found a new religion. I have
come to teach the art of Self-realization. If you
practice honesty of mind, sincerity of spirit, and
detachment, you will know your Self you will
know Me, you will know the Lord."
WHEN WILL WE SEE HIM?
The Christ is planning a series of
appearances along the lines of His
appearance in Nairobi. In this way, more
and more people will have proof of His
presence and demand media response. This
will lead to the Christ's declaration before
the world, and the beginning of His open
mission.
COME HEAR AN EXTRAORDINARY MESSAGE
Benjamin Creme, trained by a close disciple of Maitreya, the Christ, will present the background, and
latest update, on Maitrcya's emergence, including Maitreya's recent contacts with world leaders.
Maitreya will also give a spiritual blessing to the audience through Mr. Creme.

* After speaking briefly to the crowd in their own language, the Christ disappeared as suddenly as he had come,
leaving behind more than 30 people who were completely cured of their illnesses. He appears in various forms to
different groups and individuals—but always in a form that inspires recognition. The event in Nairobi was
subsequently reported by major international media.
