sure sounds appropriate. Holly Hunter, whose
films usually include Richard Dreyfuss, stars with

In honor of the"The Naked Gun 2!4" and "Ter
minator 2: Judgment Day," we'd also like to sug
gest the original "Naked Gun" and"The Termi
nator." If those are checked out, your last resorts
should be "Airplane!", a "Naked Gun"-style com
edy, and "Total Recall," Arnold Schwarzenegger's
last great action flick.
