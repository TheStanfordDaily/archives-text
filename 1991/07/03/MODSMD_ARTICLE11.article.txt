# Rosse: Perlroth can still teach
## 
### 
Students at the School of
Medicine requested last week that
Prof. Mark Perlroth, who has
been charged with sexual harass
ment of a female student, be pro
hibited from teaching until his
case is resolved.
But according to Provost James
Rosse, no punitive measures
against the Medical School pro
fessor can be taken until the
charges, which were brought by
University President Donald
Kennedy last week, are heard by
the University's Advisory Board.
The Advisory Board is a stand
ing committee of seven full pro
fessors clected by the faculty.
In their statement, members of
the Stanford Medical Student
Association said Perlroth "should
not be allowed to continue his
teaching activities until a final
determination has been made in
these cases."
"The University has a responsi
bility to protect and nurture stu
dents," said Ravi Chandra, presi
dent of the association. "Stanford
Medical School should live up to
that responsibility."
But "no process has found
[Perlroth] guilty of violating Uni
versity policy," Rosse said, adding
that the Medical School ad hoc
committee that investigated the
case only determined that there
was enough evidence to warrant a
hearing.
A hearing probably will not be
held for several months.
Kennedy formally brought

charges against Pcrlroth last week
for two cases of professional mis
conduct and one case of sexual
harassment resulting from sepa
rate complaints filed by two
female students.
Perlroth denied the charges
and intends to contest them at the
hearing.
The formal charges were filed
only after Kennedy and Pcrlroth
were unable to agree on an appro
priate punishment. University
policy requires that if such a case
cannot be settled between the
president and the faculty member,
the president can file charges
before the Advisory Board.
This case marks only the sec
ond time in University history that
such charges have been filed.
A date for the hearing, which
may be private or public depend
ing on Perlroth's preference, has
not yet been set. Numerous proce
dural steps must be taken before
the case is heard, making it
extremely difficult to set a date for
the actual hearing, said Iris Brest,
associate general counsel.
However, students and admin
istrators at the Medical School arc
not allowing the issue to die in the
interim. Steps are currently being
taken to revise the procedure for
handling sexual harassment cases
within the Medical School.
Ttoo committees are studying
different aspects of this goal. One
committee, formed by the Medi
cal School Faculty Senate, is
developing a statement —
intended to educate the medical
community — that defines behav
ior constituting sexual harassment
and gives solid examples of unac
ceptable actions and statements.
The Medical School statement
will follow current University pol
icy on sexual harassment but will
give specific examples of inappro
priate conduct.
Another committee, headed by
Charlotte Jacobs, associate dean
for education and student affairs
at the Medical School, is currently
reviewing and clarifying the pro
cedure an individual should fol
low to file a grievance in a sexual
harassment case.
