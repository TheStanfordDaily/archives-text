# Weight lifters protest project
## 
### 
A group of weight lifters at
Encina Gym has gotten all
worked-up about a remodeling
project that is taking up their
workout space.
The weight lifters recently
learned that the Department of
Athletics has decided to convert a
section of the weight lifting area
into three conference rooms for
the varsity football team.
Construction began two days
after Commencement.
The remodeling means that the
weight room will now be more
cramped, with less space devoted
to free-weight equipment.
Some Encina users have taken
the renovations in stride, dis
cussing the reduced recreational
area with casual indifference. "It's
really not that big of a deal," said
senior Josh Peterson, who lifts
three times a week. "It won't kill
us to have a little less space."
Many other iron-pumpers,
however, arc seeing red. "It's too
crowded now," said summer stu
dent David Zuccheim. "It's the
most ridiculous thing."
Wilbur Knorr, a professor of
philosophy who has used Encina
on a regular basis for the past 10
years, was especially indignant
about the change, which he claims
represents a "serious obstruction
to working out." Believing that
other people felt the same way,
Knorr circulated a petition among
Encina users.
Within six days he had gath
ered 591 signatures.
The petition, addressed to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy,
protests the manner in which the
varsity football team has seized
extra space at the expense of the
recreational lifters. It requests
that "equal and equivalent space
be made available for general
training."
But wrestling coach and weight
room manager Chris Horpel said
the weight lifters who use Encina
Gym are a hard-to-plcase lot.
