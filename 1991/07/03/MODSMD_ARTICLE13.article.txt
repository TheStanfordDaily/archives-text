# SMUG may be shortcircuited

The Stanford Macintosh Users'
Group (SMUG) has been told by
the Office of Student Activities
that it must vacate its office space
immediately, according to its pres
ident, Rob Reuther.
In addition, Reuther said Stu
dent Activities informed him that
the organization will probably not
have its charter renewed in
September and therefore will no
longer be considered a Stanford
student group.
Removing SMUG from its
office, said Reuther, means it will
be "automatically destroyed. And
that's not proper — it should get a
fair hearing. The students have a
right to know."
According to Nanci Howe,
director of student activities,
SMUG did not turn in its applica
tion for office space before the
yearly deadline. She said her
office mailed the authorized
SMUG representative a letter
reminding the group of the reap
plication deadline.
Apparently the representative
was changed, and Student Activi
ties was not informed, Howe said.
"We mailed [SMUG] a letter;
we called them; we even put ads in
The Stanford Daily in case any
group didn't receive the letter
about reapplication" for office
space, said Howe.
Reuther, however, said it is not
obvious that Student Activities
tried to contact him or any other
SMUG member.
SMUG has more than 400
members, only 186 of whom are
currently affiliated with Stanford.
For this reason, SMUG's charter
will most likely not be renewed in
September.
"I was told that it was not likely
that the group would be rechar
tered because there are no stu
dents in power," said Reuther.
Student Activities "said there
were no 'real criteria' as to how
many of the group's leaders had to
be students, but students had to
be 'the directive force' of the
group," he added.
The "Handbook of Student
Organizations" states that a Stan
ford student organization must be
"open and limited to members of
the Stanford community . . .
[though] others may participate in
the organization's activities. ...
Only currently registered students
may be the authorized representa
tives and treasurers."
SMUG has been in violation of
this policy for two years, Howe
said.

The group was formed in 1984,
the year the Macintosh was intro
duced. Since then, SMUG has
brought computer industry lead
ers to their meetings to discuss
Macintosh products, has estab
lished a computer bulletin board
and has held special-interest
meetings, such as a "HyperCard
group," said Richard Wingerter,
last year's president.
