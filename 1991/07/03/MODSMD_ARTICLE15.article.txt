# Bush adviser to return to teach
## 
### 
Economics Prof. John Taylor
will return to Stanford this fall
after serving two years on Presi
dent Bush's three-man Council of
Economic Advisers.
Taylor's resignation from the
council, effective Aug. 2, is a sub
stantial loss to the administra
tion's economic team, council
chair Michael Boskin said in a
statement. Boskin, also a Stanford
economics professor, was selected
to the council in spring 1989, the
same year as Taylor.
"I have been on leave to be on
the council and have always
planned on returning to Stan
ford," Taylor said. "I\vo years is
the standard amount of time for
an adviser."
The International Monetary
Fund last month asked Taylor to
serve as its chief economist, but
Taylor declined.

In an interview, Taylor said
being on the council was an excel
lent opportunity to put research
and experience into play in a prac
tical setting, especially in the
extraordinary economic circum
stances, both foreign and domes
tic, of the past two years.
"When you asked me in early

1989 to join your
administration, I,
of course, had no
idea of the re
markable econom
ic changes that
would soon be
occurring around
the world," Tay
lor wrote in his
resignation letter
to Bush June 25.

He said both Stanford's aca
demic atmosphere and the practi
cal aspects of the government sec
tor have much to offer in interest
and experience. But having done
both "is the most rewarding of
all."
Taylor is now eager to return to
teaching. Starting winter quarter
he will teach Economics 1, Intro
duction to Economics and Eco
nomics 210, a graduate course in
macroeconomics.
