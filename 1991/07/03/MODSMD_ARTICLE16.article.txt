# Group trying to save Synergy
## 
### 
A group of staff members and
alumni is hoping to win a minor
victory in an attempt to save three
turn-of-the-century student resi
dences the University plans to
demolish.
The Santa Clara County His
torical Heritage Commission will
evaluate early this month the
group's proposal to have the
earthquake-damaged Synergy
declared a state point of historic
interest. It will then make a rec
ommendation to the state.
While that action by itself
wouldn't save Synergy, members
of the Committee to Save the Hill
Houses, a group of half a dozen
staff members and University
alumni, say it would help their
quest to save the buildings by offi
cially recognizing their claim that
the houses have historic value.
"We want [University officials]
to realize that it doesn't look good
for them to be tearing these
houses down," says committee
member Paul Baer. "The more
people that know about it, the
harder it will be for the University
to do it."
In January, the University
announced plans to demolish the

three buildings and build faculty
housing on the site, the income
from which would be used to
develop more student housing.
The Committee to Save the
Hill Houses formed shortly after
that decision was reached. In the
last five months committee mem
bers have pursued two strategies:
lobbying to have the buildings'
historical importance recognized
and writing to alumni to ask them
to put heat on the administration.
Synergy's main claim to histori
cal importance lies in its architec
tural design. It is an example of
early 20th-century California
architecture and was designed by
architects John Bakewell Jr. and
Arthur Brown Jr., who also
designed Hoover Tower and the
San Francisco City Hall.
There are few remaining exam
ples of that architectural style,
says Nancy Mason, one of the
county commission's 10 members.
The commission will decide on
the proposal at its July 11 meet
ing.
Peter Stansky, a professor of
history, is a vocal supporter of
efforts to repair and preserve the
houses on San Juan Hill. "The
University's plan [to demolish the
houses] amounts to historical van
dalism," he claims.
Stanford Planning Director
Phil Williams disagrees. "These
are hard decisions to make, deci
sions about which some people
are invariably angry," he says.
"There just isn't money avail
able for student housing. The only
way is to find that income from
another source."
