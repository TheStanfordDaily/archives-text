# Scholar: Saturn has 18 moons
## 
### 
Using photographs of Saturn
taken by the Voyager spacecrafts
a decade ago, a Stanford scientist
recently confirmed the existence
of the planet's 18th satellite.
Mark Showalter, a postdoctoral
researcher at the Center for
Radar Astronomy, had predicted
the existence of the tiny moon —
now known as 198 IS 13 — from
wavelike ripples at the edge of
Encke's division, a large "gap" in
Saturn's ring system.
These ripples gave the gap —
which is located within Saturn's
"A" ring — a scalloped appear
ance, said Showalter, whose
research revolves around plane
tary rings.
Working with a colleague from
NASA, Showalter took the infor
mation from the ripples and pre

dieted a probable orbit for the
unknown satellite.
Showalter then conducted a
computer search among 30,000
images from Voyager 1 and Voy
ager 2 in order to locate the moon.
The search employed an extensive
database that identified those pic
tures that the moon — according
to its predicted orbit — should
appear in.
Showalter then examined those
images and identified the satellite
in 23 of them.
Showalter found the satellite's
actual orbit to be very close to the
one predicted. He believes the
satellite may have been responsi
ble for creating Encke's division
and is probably the force that
keeps it open.
Encke's division is the second
largest gap in Saturn's ring system,
located on the outermost one
third of the "A" ring. Cassini's
division is the most prominent
gap, separating Saturn's outer
most "A" and "B" rings.
