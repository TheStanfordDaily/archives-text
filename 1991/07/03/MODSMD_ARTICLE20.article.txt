Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall's retirement her
alds the end of an era, Stanford scholars say. From his
beginnings as a civil rights attorney to his 24-year tenure on
the Supreme Court, Marshall worked to protect those who
were marginalized by the political process. His departure
raises some serious questions — both about the Court's
future role in American society, and about the state of its
relationship to the rest of the political system.

The departure of a justice from the
Supreme Court invariably provokes reflec
tion and controversy.
When that justice is as legendary a fig
ure as Thurgood Marshall, however, it
does much more. Marshall's departure has
provoked soul-searching among scholars of
politics and constitutional law, a question
ing of the way society, politics and the
Court interact. These issues are likely to
become a topic of national discussion as
the confirmation of Judge Clarence
Thomas, Marshall's would-be successor, is
debated in Congress.
Few question the historical contribu
tions of the legendary civil rights leader.
What they do question is the role the
Court has come to play in U.S. politics —
and the role it is likely to play after Mar
shall is gone.
"It's important to understand how sym
bolic an event it is," says Law Prof. Tom
Grey of Marshall's retirement.
Grey, who clerked for Marshall in 1969
and 1970, thinks that Marshall's departure
marks the end of an era in U.S. politics.
And it is precisely that sense — that the
retirement of Marshall and appointment
of a conservative successor will represent a
shifting of gears for the Court — that has

some scholars concerned.
Much of this worry stems from the feel
ing that Marshall played a unique role on
the Court, one his successor is unlikely to

continue.
"Marshall was committed to protecting
those who lacked the resources to navigate
the regular political institutions," says
Lucius Barker, a professor of political sci
ence who has studied Marshall extensively
and written several books about politics
and the courts.
"Though he became a government offi
cial," Barker says, "his commitment to the
poor, to those who remained unrepre
sented or underrepresented [in the politi
cal process], remained uncompromisingly
strong."
Grey agrees. "No one has been as con
sistently a defender of the poor as Mar
shall has been,"he says.
That concern enabled Marshall to play
a leading role on the liberal Warren Court,

where he often shaped the line of consen
sus for the Court's decisions.
In San Antonio v. Rodriguez, Marshall
wrote that Texas school financing laws,
which were based on the collection of local
property taxes, gave schools in affluent
areas more money than those in poor
areas. The Court agreed that such a school
financing system unfairly disadvantaged
those who were born in poverty.
"Marshall would strictly scrutinize laws
that disadvantaged the poor," says Grey.
Even later, as the members of the War
ren Court majority retired and were gradu
ally replaced by conservative appoint
ments, Marshall continued to be what
many considered the Court's conscience.
And though the increasingly conservative
Court proved less sympathetic to his con
cerns, Marshall played a fundamentally
important role as the consistent advocate
for the interests of the underprivileged.
"Voice can be very, very important,"
says Barker. "Marshall gave a voice to
those [discriminated against by] the sys
tem, and because of his background, that
voice was heard [on the Court]. He
thereby forced the majority to come to
terms with that voice.
"I'm afraid that without Marshall, that

different voice in how the Constitution
and laws are interpreted will be lost."
Because the Court's justices are
appointed for life, they have historically
been regarded as occupying a unique posi
tion that can defend the rights of individu
als and minorities.
But this role, says Barker, is more a
constitutional potential than a historical
reality. He points to decades of court sup
port for segregation in the South, as shown
by the now-infamous Plessy v. Ferguson
decision, which endorsed the constitution
ality of segregation under a philosophy of
"separate but equal."
"It's a mistaken notion for people to
believe that the Court is inherently the
protector of minority interests," says
Barker. "The history of the court is mixed.
Marshall was so successful in getting the
Court to protect them that it led some
people to overstate the court's role as pro
tector of individual or minority interests."
Without Marshall's voice on the Court,
few believe the court is likely to play such
a role in the future. In fact, many think th(
conservative Rehnquist Court is likely to
undo the work that Marshall helped
accomplish.

"There is now a really dependable con
servative majority on the Court,"says
Grey. "We can expect to see Roe v. Wade
overruled and affirmative action programs
declared unconstitutional."
In the past year the Rehnquist majority
overturned several of the precedents of
the Warren Court. It ordered an end to
federal supervision of integration in many
school districts and began what some see
as an assault on a woman's right to abor
tion.
"Marshall was a part of the Warren
Court legacy, [a legacy] that never got
entirely carried out," Grey reflects. "I'm
sorry to see their work undone."
Marshall's departure has raised other
questions about the role of the Court in
the political system.
Gerald Gunther, a professor and
scholar of constitutional law, is disturbed
by the increasing use of the Court by
politicians as a political football.
"I breathe a sad sigh about the whole
thing," says Gunther. Court appointees are
no longer distinguished thinkers, but polit
ical hatchet men, he adds.
"I see it as a byproduct of the fact that
both sides have tried to use the Court [for
political gain]," says Gunther. "People
have come to see the Court more and
more as a political institution."
The selection process, Gunther
laments, has become a ridiculous test of
conformity to the party line, rather than a
search for legal brilliance and intellectual
excellence. Previous decisions on contro
versial issues will damn a candidate, rathei
than being a sign of judicial experience.
It is a selection process that leaves "no
room for people who showed some inde

pendence.... [It is] an effort to find peo
ple with the least amount of past thinking
and the least amount of experience" in
what the Court's work will be, he says.
"We've turned the Court into a political
football — both sides.... Liberals really
have nothing to gripe about except for the
fact that they don't like the results," Gun
ther says.
Barker, while agreeing that the selec
tion process does not always produce out
standing jurists, nevertheless finds that
analysis somewhat naive.
"The Court is inevitably a part of the
American policy system," says Barker, cit
ing the Court's consistent frustration of
New Deal legislation in the 19405. "Courts
are inextricably in the legislative process
— not as a matter of choice but a matter
of function. Most major policy issues in
America, sooner or later, end up in the
judicial arena. Court decisions are not
neutral."
Barker says he expects to hear com
plaints in Congress that Bush is politiciz
ing the Court. But "the nature of our polit
ical system is such that the courts have a
role in the political process. Sooner or
later the Court is brought into line with
the dominant conservative governing
majorities."
Gunther disagrees, saying that this is
"not the way it's always been or it has to
be."
Barker maintains that the appointment
of judges who agree with the president's
judicial philosophy has been a common
practice throughout U.S. history.
He said he thinks the political process
would be better served if, instead of
expecting judicial neutrality, voters would

"appreciate the fact that when we vote for
the President, we are voting for the kind of
people that we want to have in our
courts."
Given the fact that Presidents Reagan
and Bush have reappointed more than half
the federal judiciary, Barker believes that
public policy could benefit if voters had
that expectation.
That understanding is absent from
today's electoral politics, says Political Sci
ence Prof. David Brady. He puts little
stock in the notion that Republican presi
dential candidates win in part because
people want a more conservative judiciary.
"They wanted a more conservative
court back in the 1970s or so, but I don't
think that's what they want now/' he says.
What's more, the vague possibility of
Court retirements and appointments is
generally far from voters' minds.
That may change, Barker says, if a vig
orous fight over the Thomas nomination
ensues in Congress. A protracted battle
"will enable people to see the interactions
of law and politics. They will see how
important a role the Court does play, and
that people really do have a stake" in who
is placed in the judiciary.
They may also be alarmed by the new
Court's conservative bent, a shift that has
been going on for some years but is sym
bolically and dramatically captured by
Marshall's departure, some observers say.
Indeed, just as Marshall made some of
his greatest contributions to U.S. legal and
social history before he even joined the
Court, he may strike another blow for his
ideals with his departure.
Says Barker: "We are in for some very
interesting times."
