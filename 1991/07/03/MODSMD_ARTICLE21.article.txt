# Law prof. remembers Marshall
## 
### 
The year after Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Grey graduated from
law school in 1969, he had a job
that was every law student's
dream: clerking for Thurgood
Marshall, justice of the
Supreme Court.
Marshall stood at the frontier
of social change in America,
and Grey had the opportunity to
assist him. As part of the liberal
majority on the Warren Court,
Marshall played a leading role,
engineering dramatic social
change.
The Warren Court abolished
prayer in public schools,
declared that the right of a
woman to have an abortion is
constitutionally guaranteed and
prohibited the use of evidence
obtained through forced confes
sions.
It left a historical and legal
legacy that brings a tear to many
a liberal eye — and that many
conservatives are still trying to
undo.
As Marshall's clerk and per
sonal assistant, Grey often
helped with the decisions and
opinions that Marshall wrote for
the Court.
And while he appreciated the
justice's historical significance,
what Grey most deeply enjoyed
— and most fondly remembers
— was the delightful nature of
Marshall's friendship.
"He was a lot of fun," recalls
Grey. "He was a great story
teller. He had so many stories
about his early days as a civil
rights leader. I have great per-

affection for him."
Grey's yearlong tenure with
Marshall launched him on a
successful career in constitu
tional law and legal history. It is
a career that has brought Grey
to Stanford Law School.
He drew upon his experience
when asked to recraft Stanford's
Fundamental Standard, which
Grey revised to prohibit hate
speech that attempts to "stigma
tize an individual or a small

number of individuals on the
basis of their sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orien
tation or national and ethnic
origin."
Marshall's career took a dif
ferent turn. In the early '70s,
three members of the Warren
Court retired, allowing Presi
dent Nixon to appoint their suc
cessors. During the Reagan
administration, two more jus
tices retired, allowing another
conservative president to fill
their seats.
Last summer, William Bren
nan, Marshall's longtime friend
and fellow liberal, retired as
well, leaving Marshall the only
member of the Warren majority
still on the Supreme Court.
Had he been Marshall's clerk
two decades later, Grey would
probably have helped write very
few decisions. Isolated by the
conservative majority, Marshall
found himself on the dissenting
side of almost every major deci
sion made by the Court.
That isolation, pundits muse,
produced frustration and a feel
ing of alienation from the
Court's work that propelled
Marshall into retirement. Grey
finds such an assessment incred
ibly hard to believe.
"I don't think so," says Grey,
recalling the jurist's good
humored flexibility and the role
that Marshall played, even when
dissenting, in shaping the
Court's opinion. "He was com
fortable with dissenting. He's
just 82 years old."


Law Prof. Tom Grey clerked for
Thurgood Marshall in 1969 and
1970.
