# Barker: Marshall fought for rights
## 
### 
As a black man growing up in small
town Louisiana, Lucius Barker was in a
position to appreciate the imprint the
civil rights movement had made on
American society.
It wasn't until he became a scholar and
teacher, however, that Barker, now the
William Bennett Munro Professor of
Political Science at Stanford, came to
appreciate the genius of Thurgood Mar
shall's approach to social change.
Marshall, Barker says, set the founda
tion upon which future civil rights leaders
would build — an appeal to the highest
law of the country, the Constitution.
"Americans have an incredible rever
ence for the law and attachment to our
institutions," says Barker, who has been
the head of the Political Science Depart
ment at Washington University in St.
Louis and is currently working on a vol
ume about Marshall and civil rights law.
Before Marshall stepped onto the
national scene, those laws and institu
tions were on the side of a racially segra
gated system.
Stalwarts who were solidly against the
aims of black people could portray them
selves as law-and-order men who
solemnly and righteously upheld local
law, Barker says.
Marshall, as counsel for the legal
defense fund of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People,
gradually convinced the Supreme Court
— and the nation — that the law was
indeed on the side of black people.
"Marshall started a revolution in law
which helped to bring about a revolution
in our politics," says Barker of Marshall's
accomplishments in a role that many feel
overshadowed his tenure on the Supreme
Court. "That can't be emphasized
enough."
As counsel for the NAACP, Marshall
argued 32 civil rights cases before the
Supreme Court. He won 29 of them,
including the fabled Brown v. Board of
Education case that desegregated Amer
ica's public schools. As Barker puts it, the
case "opened up an era of inclusion" in
American society.
Most importantly, Marshall convinced

much of the United States that the Con
stitution justified the claims of blacks.
That, says Barker, legitimized the

demands of black civil
rights leaders and
spurred the growing
civil rights movement.
"Some of the ones
who had been stal
warts became the
ones who were dis
obeying the law,"
Barker says. Similarly,
he says, those who had
once felt oppressed by
the system could now
look to it for support.
By bringing these
issues to the national
consciousness, Mar
shall placed civil
rights squarely on the
country's agenda,
according to Barker.
He also set the
stage for an unusual
coalition, between the
Southern blacks who
made up the civil
rights movement and
the Supreme Court —
those most disenfran
chised by the political
system and those most
immune from its con
trol.
"Marshall set the
legal basis through
which subsequent
black political devel
opment occurred,"
Barker says. "[There
was] a kind of devel
oping continuum
between the work of
Marshall and Martin
Luther King.
"By getting the law
on the side of blacks,
Marshall really forced
the nation to live up to
some of its ideals,"
says Barker. Marshall's

tactics convinced America that the strug
gle for civil rights was "consistent with all
of the kinds of democratic principles."
