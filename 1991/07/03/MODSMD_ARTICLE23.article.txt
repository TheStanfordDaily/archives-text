Pacific 10 all-stars
A dozen of the Pacific 10 Con
ference's top women's basketball
players are currently in Taipei,
Taiwan, competing in the presti
gious William Jones Cup Interna
tional Tournament. Representing
Stanford is junior Val Whiting,
who was named the Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year two seasons ago.
Among the other stars are
UCLA's Rehema Stephens, the
Pac-10's leading scorer; USC's
Tammy Story, an offensive and
defensive threat; and Oregon's
Judy Shannon.
The team, under the direction
of Oregon coach Elwin Heiny,
began practice back on June 20
and left for Taiwan on June 25.
Heiny also coached a Pac-10 team
in Hungary during 1989 — the
first time the conference sent a
women's all-star team on the
road.
The tournament began last Sat
urday and continues through Sun
day. The national teams from
Canada and Taiwan, as well as
those from several European and
Asian countries, are competing.
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery will lead a team of men's
all-stars to Spain for 10 days of
play in August against some top
European professional teams.
Prop 48 changes
The powerful Presidents Com
mission has approved a new series
of reforms it hopes to push
through at the coming NCAA
convention in January.
Foremost among those is a
strengthening of academic re
quirements. Proposition 48, which
makes freshmen who fail to
achieve certain minimum stan
dards ineligible, is atop the list.
Under the old rules, students
needed to score 700 on the SAT or
18 on the ACT and receive a 2.0
grade-point average in 11 high
school core courses.
If the presidents have their
way, those same test scores will
need to be combined with a 2.5
GPA in 13 core courses. Students
with GPAs of 2.0-2.5 will need
SAT scores of 900 or ACT scores
of 23.
Not surprisingly, no Stanford
athlete has ever been declared

ineligible through Prop 48.
The other major change —
one that might affect Stanford —
concerns progress toward gradua
tion. Under the proposal, student
athletes would need to complete
25 percent of their work toward a
degree in order to be eligible for a
third year of competition, 50 per
cent to play in a fourth year and
75 percent to compete in the fifth
year.
Furthermore, athletes would
be required to have 95 percent of
the minimum GPA needed for
graduation by the beginning of the
third year and 100 percent of the
minimum by the fourth.
These continuation rules would
be implemented immediately if
approved. The Prop 48 changes
would not go into effect until
1995.
Conference medals
Ed McCaffrey and Sandra
Birch may have graduated, but
that hasn't prevented the pair
from continuing to pile up awards.
Last week, the two received Pac
-10 medals.
Each year the conference gives
the award to one male and one
female at each school who best
combine athletic performance
with leadership and academic suc
cess.
McCaffrey and Birch also
received the A 1 Masters Award,
Stanford's highest athletic honor,
in mid-June.
Odds and ends
UNLV's troubles with the
NCAA are getting even worse.
The school received a supplemen
tal letter of inquiry requesting
information on the recruiting of
former Los Angeles prep-school
star Ed O'Bannon.
O'Bannon went to UCLA
despite what the NCAA feels
were illegal tactics used by UNLV.
The Rebels' basketball program is
already barred from television
and postseason play for 1991-92 as
a result of an ancient battle
between the NCAA and coach
Jerry Tarkanian.
Meanwhile, UNLV is still
responding to a long list of
charges largely stemming from the
recruitment of Lloyd Daniels.
