# Wheaton reaches quarters
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Although David Wheaton's
Stanford tennis career lasted only
one season, the tall Minnesotan
left an indelible impression on
fans here than won't soon be
erased.
Spectators at the All-England
Club have no doubt formed a sim
ilar picture of the 22-year-old
American after his performance
this past week at Wimbledon.
Wheaton shocked No. 3 seed
Ivan Lendl in the third round and
followed that up with a pasting of
Sweden's Jan Gunnarson yester
day to move into the quarterfinals
— Wimbledon's prestigious final
eight.
The Lendl victory, a 6-3, 3-6, 7-
6 (8-6), 6-3 triumph, was scored
on the strength of Wheaton's 60
service winners with his over 120
mph bullets. While Lendl had 55
service winners of his own,
Wheaton's steady play was too
much for the former Czech who
has now failed to win Wimbledon
in 12 tries.

After the match, Wheaton was
ebullient. "This is my best sur
face," he said. "I wouldn't neces
sarily say I'm going to win and go
out on a limb like that. But I think
I have a chance."
But his statement wasn't exces
sively confident after the impres
sive Lendl win, which probably
helped him against Gunnarson.
"It's not like a boxing match
where you knock the guy out and
go celebrate," he said Monday.
"I have another match tomor
row against a good player. If I
don't go out there and play good
tennis tomorrow, I'd be in a lot of
trouble. The big thing is not to get
too up after a win. But still, I'm
going to enjoy a big win like this."
But then Wheaton got back to
business, subduing Gunnarson 6-
4, 6-3, 6-1 yesterday. He will be in
action again tomorrow.
The Stanford connection in the
men's draw saw four former Car
dinal stars reach the final 16: John
McEnroe, who bowed out to top
seed Stefan Edberg 7-6 (7-4), 6-1,
6-4 yesterday, and Derrick Ros
tagno and Tim Mayotte, who both

play today for spots in the quarter
finals.
Rostagno's moment of glory
came when he knocked off Jimmy
Connors Sunday. Mayotte, on the
other hand, is just happy to still be
around. Wimbledon, the one
Grand Slam tournament he
always figured he might win, has
served to rejuvenate his career.
Mayotte had fallen to 92 in the
world after being a fixture in the
top 20 just a couple of years ago.
There was less success among
Stanford women. Tami Whitlinger
fell in the second round to Anke
Huber, the 13th seed, 6-2, 6-1.
Patty Fendick was also a second
round loser, dropping her match
to Linda Ferrando of Italv 4-6, 6-
1, 7-5.
Whitlinger remains alive in the
doubles, however. Teaming with
former Florida star Shuan
Stafford, she reached the third
round with a 6-2, 6-2 triumph over
Clare Wood and Belinda Borneo
of Britain.
Stafford and Whitlinger beat
Fendick and Elise Burgin 2-6, 6-2,
6-4 in the first round.

David Wheaton, who helped lead Stanford to the NCAA men's tennis title in 1988, scored an upset over
Ivan Lendl and has since advanced to the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
