## A 						house of Cards? Failing grades for A's? What gives? 
### 
With the Fourth of July a
day away and the All-
Star break just around
the corner, it's time to take a look
back at the unofficial first half of
the baseball season.
Certainly one the most shock
ing developments of all is the end
of the Oakland A's invincibility.
With three straight American
League pennants in hand, the A's
have run roughshod over the
opposition through the last few
regular seasons.
In 1991, though, Oakland is
just another team competing for a
spot in the postseason, and it's not
incredibly clear as to why. True,
Walt Weiss and Carney Lansford
are out.
But Weiss' contribution is
strictly on defense and Mike Gal
lego fills in just fine. Besides,
injuries never stopped the A's
before — even when Dennis Eck

erslcy and Jose Canseco were the
injured.
No, Oakland's problem is basi
cally that the team's pitching is
mediocre. The A's earned-run
average is the second worst in the
A.L.; the venerable Dave Stewart
is bidding to become one of the
few pitchers in history to throw
200 innings and post an ERA over
5, and the middle relief corps has
displayed cracks in its once-bullet
proof armor.
The misfortunes of the A's pro
vide a stark contrast to the posi
tive performance of the St. Louis
Cardinals. After cleaning house
last fall — trading Willie McGee
and allowing Vince Coleman and
Terry Pendleton to exit via free
agency — the Cards were thought
to be little more than a rebuilding
ballclub headed for a second-divi
sion finish.
But lo and behold, St. Louis is

sitting in second place in the
National League East, just a
handful of games behind Pitts
burgh. An infusion of young out
field talent, in particular Felix
Jose, and the salary drive of Ozzie
Smith have put the Cardinals in
the thick of things. It seems
unlikely that they have the staying
power to make a race of it, but the
Pirates have hardly proven to be
invincible.
Minnesota, likewise, wasn't
given much of a chance. Yet, they
sit atop the A.L. West, largely due
to a rejuvenated starting rotation
led by Scott Erickson.
Jack Morris is a veteran anchor
on the staff and Kevin Tapani has
pitched well, although a lack of
run support has made him a loser.
Minnesota also picked up a true
find in free-agent reject Chili
Davis, whose power surge has
even confounded himself.

For every player exceeding
expectations there's one falling
well short. Take Oakland's Mark
McGwire, for instance. A .289 hit
ter as a rookie, McGwire is bat
tling to keep his average over the
Mendoza line despite having
enough selectivity to be among
the league leaders in walks.
Perhaps the star to end all stars
in 1991 is the inimitable Cal Rip
ken Jr. of Baltimore. A year ago,
the conventional wisdom was that
Ripken's obsession with chasing
Lou Gherig's consecutive-games
played record was wearing him
out. Ripken's diminishing offen
sive production seemed to lend
credence to that theory.
Well, the streak is still alive —
Gherig's record could fall in mid
-1995 — and Ripken is posting
near Triple Crown numbers. And
it certainly isn't the Orioles' posi
tion in the standings that's inspir

ing Ripken. The comparisons to
another shortstop, the great Ernie
Banks, are inevitable.
But despite Banks' desire to
play two, there will only be one
All-Star Game next Tuesday. So
enjoy it while it lasts.
