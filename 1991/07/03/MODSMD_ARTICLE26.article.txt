## Independence Day celebrations light up the Bay Area 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
It's that time of year again.
Time to show your pride for
the United States, time to
express your patriotism. Time to
grill hot dogs and bake apple pie.
Time to invite all the family mem
bers you don't like and never talk to
over to your house to watch Dad
struggle with the barbecue that
hasn't been used since last August.
Yes, it's the Fourth of July.
And what a holidav it is. Food,
fireworks and fun — and much of it
for free. The only bad part about
Independence Day is deciding what
to do and where to do it. Fortu
nately for you, you have this article
to help you out.
Many of the City's "institutions"
are putting on shows for the fourth.
The San Francisco Chronicle, for
example, is planning a whole day of
events at Crissy Field. Hosted by
Michael Pritchard, a local come
dian, the main-stage events will
start at 2 p.m. on Thursday and con
tinue until 9:15. Featured perform
ers include San Francisco's Wu Shu
Troupe, Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band and Little Charlie
and the Nightcats. From 8:25 p.m.
to 9:15 p.m., the Sixth Army Band
will salute the 75th anniversary of
the National Park Service, after
which there will be fireworks.

In addition to its many acts for
adults, The Chronicle is sponsoring
just as many for children. From 2
p.m. to 7:15 p.m., also at Crissy
Field, Gary LaPow will host a slew
of children's events, including a kite
fly-in, a marionette performance
and several comedic skits. And nat
urally, the children are welcome to
enjoy the fireworks as well. Admis
sion to The Chronicle's celebration
is free; for more information, call
777-7120.
If you don't feel like trudging up
to the City (and we don't blame you
if you don't), don't worry — there's
plenty to do nearby. The San Fran
cisco Symphony, for instance, is
hosting a day of entertainment at
Shoreline Amphitheater in Moun
tain View. Festivities begin at 5 p.m.
and include jugglers, clowns, magi
cians and an old-time carnival
arcade for children (we won't tell if
some of you adults join in). At 8
p.m., the symphony will perform a
program of classical and traditional
favorites such as "The Sorcerer's
Apprentice" and, of course, "The
Star-Spangled Banner."
Naturally, there will be fireworks
as well, accompanied by Tfchaikov
sky's "1812 Overture." After the
concert there will be a raffle for a
trip to London, a trip to Lake T&hoe
and tickets to future Shoreline
events. Complimentary dessert and

refreshments will also be served
after the show. All this fun comes at
a price, however; tickets are $19.50
and $22.50 for reserved seating,
$15.50 for lawn seats. To order, call
BASS/Ticketmaster at 762-BASS.
And Great America, always the
center of Bay Area excitement, is
featuring concerts by Paul Revere
and the Raiders at 4 and 8:30 p.m.
At 9:30 p.m., there will be a Sky
Concert of fireworks chore
ographed to patriotic music. Admis
sion to all of these shows is free with
a ticket to the park. For more infor
mation, call (408) 988-1800.
Also in the area is the San Jose
America Festival, which starts on
July 4 and runs through July 7. This
is perhaps the most involved Inde
pendence Day celebration, com
posed of five interconnected events.
Performing arts, arts and crafts,
children's events, food and fire
works will all be featured during
this four-day extravaganza. For
more information, call (408) 287-
4210.
. Less complex, but just as much
fun, are the celebrations at the Con
cord Pavilion, at the Alameda
County Fair and in Milpitas.

The California Symphony will be
performing at 8 p.m. at the Pavilion
on Thursday and fireworks will fol
low. Tickets are $17 for reserved
seats, $15 for lawn seating, and are
available through BASS/Ticketmas
ter outlets.
Pat Boone will be making a few
guest appearances at the Alameda
County Fair on the Fourth, at 6 and
8 p.m. Fireworks are scheduled to
begin after the shows, at 9:15 p.m.,
and the fair will stay open until 10
p.m. Tickets are $6, with special
rates for seniors and children; call
846-2881 for more information.
Milpitas is hosting a different
sort of July Fourth, starting with
five- and 10-kilometer runs from
the city's sports complex at 8:30
a.m. Alter the exercise, however,
there will be fun and games in Car
doza Park, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
with Fireworks at 9:30 p.m.
The only thing more patriotic
than a baseball game is a baseball
game followed by fireworks. The
San Jose Giants will have a display
after their game on Thursday. Tick
ets are $5 for adults, $3 for seniors
and children. Call (408) 297-1435 to
order.

And for those of you with more
refined tastes, the Mirassou Winery
is having a Fourth of July wine-tast
ing at 7 p.m., followed by a pops
concert with the Nova Vista Sym
phony and fireworks. Tickets are
$10 and are available at the winery
or through BASS/Ticketmaster out
lets. Call (408) 274-4000 for more
information.
But what if you don't want to
hear the symphony, go to a baseball
game or taste wine? What if you just
want to sit back, relax and ooh and
aah at some spectacular pyrotech
nics? No problem. In dozens of
locations around the Bay Area —
such as De Anza College, in Cuper
tino (call (408) 865-1384 for details)
— you will be able to find free, no
nonsense fireworks. In fact, there
are so many displays, you may not
be able to decide which will be the
best show. So here's a bit of advice:
Drive down U.S. Highway 280 and
see them all. Or better yet, climb up
to the Dish — you can't get a better
view.
But whatever you decide to do,
remember: Dad never has figured
out how to keep the grill going, so
eat lots of potato salad.
