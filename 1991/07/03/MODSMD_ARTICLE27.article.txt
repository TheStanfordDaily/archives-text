# Music and social consciousness combine for 'Gathering of the Tribes'
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Multiculturalism. Yes, there's
that word again. Although it
sounds cliche, multiculturalism —
in the truly cooperative and open
minded sense of the term — is the
best word to describe the upcom
ing two-day musical festival,
"Gathering of the Tribes 1991,"
slated for July 7 at the Shoreline
Amphitheater.
The Shoreline festival will be
the second in the North American
tour of "Tribes" that kicks off
tomorrow in Redrock, Denver,
before making its way to Moun
tain View and other cities around
the country.
Described by its organizers (Bill
Graham Presents, The Nederlan
der Organization, ICM and Bur
ton Management) as "Music for
the ears, art for the eyes, ecologi
cal information for the soul ... a
festival for the senses," the tour is
designed to celebrate indepen
dence from cultural barriers and
heighten awareness of national
and international issues.
"Tribes" will present a diverse
group of artists, each to some
extent unclassifiable and innova
tive, along with information
booths for various environmental
and activist groups.
With styles ranging from hard
rock to alternative to roots rock to
rap, the cutting edge performing
groups will include Steve Earle,
EPMD, Fishbone, John Wesley
Harding, Hoodoo Gurus, Johnny
Law, Kings X, Mighty Lemon
Drops, Primus, X and YoYo. The

individual groups, as well as this
unique combination of them,
work to break down traditional
barriers formed by the often prej
udicial tastes of musical audi
ences.
"Tribes" seeks to erase restric
tive conventional classifications
that prevent understanding and
enjoyment from crossing cultural
lines.
Social and political awareness
information will be provided by
such groups as Amnesty Interna
tional, Child's Help, Earth First,
Greenpeace, Queer Nation and
Rock the Vote. Since many of the
featured artists address social
issues in their songs, "Gathering
of the Tribes" forms a powerful,
consciousness-raising coalition of
artists and activists.
First presented in 1990, "Gath
ering of the Tribes" was the brain
child of lan Astbury, frontman for
the Cult. According to the Los
Angeles Times, last year's shows
in San Francisco and Los Angeles
"showed that diversity has a con
stituency." The success of the
event resulted in a dramatic
increase in its scope for 1991, but
the integrity of its message
remains intact. The groups fea
tured are a celebration of diver
sity.
Steve Earle, with his band, the
Dukes, is a Nashville country
musician with a love for the power
of rock 'n' roll. During his 18-year
recording career, Earle has con
stantly struggled to retain his
artistic integrity. His most recent
album, titled "The Hard Way,"

features his unique "Power
TVvang" brand of country.
EPMD (Erick and Parish Mak
ing Dollars) and YoYo are both
rap artists with a difference.
EPMD addresses its music to the
business side of the music indus
try, highlighting the struggle for
entry into the inner circles and the

effects of money and fame on
their lives. YoYo, on her debut
album, "Make Way for the Moth
erlode," defies the machismo of
mainstream rap with a strong fem
inist message, focusing on female
education, goals and confidence.
Fishbone presents a unique
brand of metal rock. The band,

composed of seven black musi
cians from South Central Los
Angeles, uses their childhood con
tact with affluent whites — caused
by desegregation busing into the
San Fernando Valley — as their
source of inspiration.
While Johnny Law, from
Austin, Texas, is also classified as
a metal rock band, this group
plays with a strong blues feel. As
group, member Erik Larson
claims, "We're different than any
thing else ... We don't fall into
those stringent categories." The
group prides itself on its unclassi
fiable nature.
John Wesley Harding, with his
London-based folk brand of rock
'n' roll, and The Mighty Lemon
Drops, a sixties-influenced alter
native pop rock group from
Britain, joined forces in 1990 for
their four-month Laughter Tour
of the United States. Both groups
present fresh approaches to rock
by combining elements from
diverse musical traditions. Also
from Britain are the Hoodoo
Gurus, described by the Aus
tralian publication, "On the
Street" as "guitars and garage
land rock 'n' roll at its absolute
best."
Returning to the United States,
Primus is a San Francisco-based
band which uses elements of
thrash funk, heavy metal, complex
percussion and lyrics that tell
what one member calls "Tales
from The Weird Side" to create an
unclassifiable sound that the band
describes as "cartoony." The
group has won several Bammies
(Bay Area Music Awards).

rock to alternative to roots rock to
rap, the cutting edge performing
groups will include Steve Earle,
EPMD, Fishbone, John Wesley
Harding, Hoodoo Gurus, Johnny
Law, Kings X, Mighty Lemon
Drops, Primus, X and YoYo. The

individual groups, as well as this
unique combination of them,
work to break down traditional
barriers formed by the often prej
udicial tastes of musical audi
ences.
"Tribes" seeks to erase restric
tive conventional classifications
that prevent understanding and
enjoyment from crossing cultural
lines.
Social and political awareness
information will be provided by
such groups as Amnesty Interna
tional, Child's Help, Earth First,
Greenpeace, Queer Nation and
Rock the Vote. Since many of the
featured artists address social
issues in their songs, "Gathering
of the Tribes" forms a powerful,
consciousness-raising coalition of
artists and activists.
First presented in 1990, "Gath
ering of the Tribes" was the brain
child of lan Astbury, frontman for
the Cult. According to the Los
Angeles Times, last year's shows
in San Francisco and Los Angeles
"showed that diversity has a con
stituency." The success of the
event resulted in a dramatic
increase in its scope for 1991, but
the integrity of its message
remains intact. The groups fea
tured are a celebration of diver
sity.
Steve Earle, with his band, the
Dukes, is a Nashville country
musician with a love for the power
of rock 'n' roll. During his 18-year
recording career, Earle has con
stantly struggled to retain his
artistic integrity. His most recent
album, titled "The Hard Way,"

features his unique "Power
TVvang" brand of country.
EPMD (Erick and Parish Mak
ing Dollars) and YoYo are both
rap artists with a difference.
EPMD addresses its music to the
business side of the music indus
try, highlighting the struggle for
entry into the inner circles and the

effects of money and fame on
their lives. YoYo, on her debut
album, "Make Way for the Moth
erlode," defies the machismo of
mainstream rap with a strong fem
inist message, focusing on female
education, goals and confidence.
Fishbone presents a unique
brand of metal rock. The band,

composed of seven black musi
cians from South Central Los
Angeles, uses their childhood con
tact with affluent whites — caused
by desegregation busing into the
San Fernando Valley — as their
source of inspiration.
While Johnny Law, from
Austin, Texas, is also classified as
a metal rock band, this group
plays with a strong blues feel. As
group, member Erik Larson
claims, "We're different than any
thing else ... We don't fall into
those stringent categories." The
group prides itself on its unclassi
fiable nature.
John Wesley Harding, with his
London-based folk brand of rock
'n' roll, and The Mighty Lemon
Drops, a sixties-influenced alter
native pop rock group from
Britain, joined forces in 1990 for
their four-month Laughter Tour
of the United States. Both groups
present fresh approaches to rock
by combining elements from
diverse musical traditions. Also
from Britain are the Hoodoo
Gurus, described by the Aus
tralian publication, "On the
Street" as "guitars and garage
land rock 'n' roll at its absolute
best."
Returning to the United States,
Primus is a San Francisco-based
band which uses elements of
thrash funk, heavy metal, complex
percussion and lyrics that tell
what one member calls "Tales
from The Weird Side" to create an
unclassifiable sound that the band
describes as "cartoony." The
group has won several Bammies
(Bay Area Music Awards).
