# Jazzy summer at Stanford
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
The Bay Area jazz scene is
just not happening. Some
would go so far as to say it's
non-existent. All the players
know it. That's why they all
either live in Los Angeles, are
moving there or are building up
a record number of frequent
flier miles.
However, there are a few
havens for jazz in Northern
California. Honest.
Surprisingly, despite its own
struggling jazz program, the
Stanford campus has been one
of those havens for the last 19
summers. Serving as the site
for the non-profit Stanford
Jazz Workshop (unaffiliated
with the University), Stanford
has had the privilege of hosting
such jazz greats as Stan Getz,
Dizzie Gillespie, Joe Hender
son and Jim McNeely.
In addition to its various
programs such as Jazz Camp
and theory programs, the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop features a
Summer Jazz Concert Series
that is remarkably packed with
big-name jazz talent.
The 1991 Stan Getz Memo
rial Stanford Jazz Workshop
Summer Jazz Series will pre
sent a total of 20 concerts given
by both national and Bay Area
jazz artists between June 26
and Aug. 10.
A once-a-year opportunity
for the Stanford community to
hear quality jazz locally in inti
mate concert settings, and at
reasonable ticket prices, this
year's concert series will honor
the late Getz, 11-time Grammy
winning saxophonist and vital
contributor to the Stanford
Jazz Workshop.
This Friday's concert will
feature the Zakir Hussain/Mel
Martin Duo in Campbell

Recital Hall at 8 p.m. Both
experienced jazz players, the
two combine percussion
artistry (Hussain) and multi
reed woodwind virtuosity
(Martin) to produce fresh,
original compositions.
Future series highlights will
include performances by jazz
artists Madeline Eastman, The
TUrtle Island String Quartet,
Hal Gelper Trio, Joe Hender
son Trio, Sheila Jordan and (all
on Aug. 9) Ralph Moore, Hal
Gelper, Reggie Workman and
Adam Nussbaum.
Eastman, who is currently
receiving critical acclaim for
her debut album "Point of
Departure," is one of jazz's
most exciting new female
vocalists. She will take the
stage with the Tootie Heath
Trio on July 26.
Jazz legend Joe Henderson
will blow his masterful saxo
"phone accompanied by bassist
Larry Grenadier and drummer
Adam Nussbaum on Aug. 3.
On Aug. 7, veteran jazz
vocalist Sheila Jordan, a peren
nial Downbeat poll winner, will
display her innovative, Charlie
Parker influenced style.
Finally, Aug. 9 will feature a
dynamic quartet of four jazz
greats: saxophonist Ralph
Moore, who has performed
with the likes of Dizzy Gille
spie and Freddie Hubbard;
pianist Hal Gelper of the previ
ously mentioned Hal Gelper
Trio; bassist Reggie Workman,
veteran of performances with
John Coltrain and Art Blakey;
and drummer Adam Nuss
baum, who is currently per
forming with John Scofield and
Michael Brecker.
