The Schola Cantorum, one of the leading choral
organizations in the Bay Area, will be presenting its
traditional Summer Sings music series at the Moun
tain View Center for the Performing Arts this sum
mer.
On Monday nights through the end of August, the
group will be performing some of the greatest choral
pieces ever written. But the twist is that Schola is
inviting you to sing right along with them.
Show up at the door and you will be handed a
copy of the featured musical selection for the
evening. You don't need to bring anything but your
sight-reading skills, your love for the music and most
of all, your voice.
Stanford faculty member Gregory Wait, Schola's
highly acclaimed music director, will conduct the
group's first performance on July 8. That night, in
honor of the bicentennial of Wolfgang Mozart's
death, you can sing along as Schola performs this
composer's choral masterpieces, including his
"Requiem."
Gabriel Faure's requiem, to be performed on July
29, is one of the most accessible and gentle of its

genre. Giuseppe Verdi's, scheduled for August 5, is
quite the opposite; apocalyptic and full of doom, it is
also quite operatic. Mozart's, the first work in the
series, is characteristically elegant, yet more brood
ing than many of his works.
Johannes Brahms' "Ein Deutsches Requiem" is
widely regarded as the greatest of them all. From the
drama of "Denn alles Fleisch es is l wie Gras" to the
sweet strains of "Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen,"
the composer's beautiful responsiveness to the text
and the sheer artistry of choral expression make the
piece a favorite of all who have sung it.
On July 22, Schola will be singing "Ein Deutsches
Requiem" under the baton of Louis Magor, conduc
tor of the Seattle Bach Chorus.
Other choral works, by composers as diverse as
Johann Sebastian Bach and Carl Orff, will round out
this summer's program.

Schola Cantorum's first Summer Sing will be held
Monday at Foothill College Theater at Bp.m. All other
singalongs will be at the Mountain View Center for the
Performing Arts at 7:30 p.m. Call 903-6000 for more
