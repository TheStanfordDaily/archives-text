'Naked' pleasure
"Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of
Fear," starring Leslie Nielsen,
Priscilla Presley and Robert Goulet
The advertisements for "The
Naked Gun 2/: The Smell of
Fear" seem like they've given
away all the funny jokes in the
film. To some extent, that's true.
Seeing Priscilla Presley's mysteri
ous third hand pop up and slap
Leslie Nielsen after he's grabbed
her other two hands just isn't that
funny after you've seen it in the
ads a million times.
But luckily for movie audi
ences, there are more jokes in
"Naked Gun 2JT than could ever
be revealed in a few 30-second
ads. As expected, the film is prac
tically a non-stop series of sight
gags, one-liners, cliches and dou
ble-entendres that combine to

form a fluffy piece of amusing
entertainment.
The nominal plot revolves
around an attempt by the coal, oil
and nuclear power industries to
influence U.S. energy policy.
Robert Goulet turns in a horribly
boring performance as the head of
this energy cartel, and the film
suffers from the lack of an even
mildly interesting villain. Luckily,
Nielsen and friends (George
Kennedy and O.J. Simpson) pro
vide enough comedy to make up
for some of Goulet's non-pres
ence.
Just about everything in
"Naked Gun pokes fun at
itself and at the film medium in
general. When we first see
Drebin's weeping ex-girlfriend,
Jane Spencer (Presley), there's a
heavy rainstorm outside her win
dow and the violin music is comi
cally melodramatic. These subtle
touches put extra punch in this
not-so-subtle movie, keeping it
from getting bogged down in pure
slapstick.
Many of the jokes revolve

around the clumsiness of
Nielsen's intrepid Lt. Frank
Drebin, who incapacitates more
criminals by accident than most
police officers do on purpose.
Regrettably, Drebin's ineptitude
is never as funny as the rich verbal
humor and subtle sight gags hid
den in the background and on the
edges of every scene in the film.
It would be a crime to spoil any
more moments than the ads
already have, but the love scene in
particular should not be forgot
ten. It starts with a parody of
"Ghost," but soon ends up in a
hilarious sequence of metaphors
for sex. The ridiculously anticli
mactic climax of the film is
absurdly effective.
Overstuffed with images and
inside jokes ranging from ZZ Top
to Batman to the Exxon Valdez oil
spill, "Naked Gun 2W is the kind
of good-natured, guilty pleasure
that intellectuals may avoid.
Unfortunately for them, they'll be
missing a witty film and a darn
good time.
