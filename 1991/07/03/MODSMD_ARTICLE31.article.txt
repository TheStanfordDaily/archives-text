Totally pumped-up
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong
and Robert Patrick
This is it.
This is the film you've been
waiting for. Oh, I know what
you're saying. You don't think
there's any way "Terminator 2:
Judgment Day" could be worth
nearly $100 million in production
costs and all the hype it's been
getting.
You're wrong. 1 spent most of
this film with mouth gaping, heart
pounding and eyes glued to the
screen. Without a doubt, this is
one of the most visually stunning
and action-packed films ever
made.
In "Risky Business," Tom
Cruise pushes all the sliders on
the stereo equalizer to 10 when he
really wants to have a good time.
"T2" (as the film is affectionately
called) is the film equivalent of
having all the equalizer controls at
10: The elements don't always mix
very well and some get drowned
out by others, but it sure is a
rockin' good time.
Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a
cyborg from the future, where
machines have taken over the
world after a nuclear holocaust
claimed 3 billion lives. The leader
of the human resistance, John
Connor, sends Schwarzenegger
back to 1995 to protect his 10-
year-old self from being killed by a
more advanced model of termina
tor, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick).
John's mother, Sarah, was
hunted by the cyborg played by
Schwarzenegger in the first film
(that machine was technically
destroyed at the first film's con
clusion, so this is actually another
version of the same model of
machine). In the 10 years between
the time of the original "Termina
tor" and "T2," Sarah has been
institutionalized for her "delu
sions" about the future.
Unfortunately, Linda Hamil

ton's Sarah has gotten lost in
director James Cameron's drive to
make a point with the film.
Sarah's frenzied, psychotic,
paramilitary personality is disap
pointing considering Hamilton's
ability to play characters with
some sensitivity. But, as men
tioned before, everything about
this movie, including the pressure
and pain embodied by Sarah, is
maxed out.
With a budget as enormous as
"T2's," awesome special effects
are to be expected, and the film
delivers more than you could ever
expect. In particular, the T-1000
Terminator, made of liquid steel,
produces some of the most unex

pected and impressive illusions
imaginable, created by makeup
and effects wizard Stan Winston.
Of course, explosions, gun play
and mayhem abound as well. But
Cameron is trying to make a point
with his film, and although many
audience members will get so
caught up in the action that they
miss the message, it's refreshing
to see an action film that is against
killing. Cameron especially suc
ceeds in making the horrifying
potential of nuclear weapons
strikingly clear.
Schwarzenegger utilizes his
comedic skills in the role of a sup
posedly unfeeling machine, who
nevertheless becomes something

of a father figure to young John
Conner, played surprisingly well by
newcomer Edward Furlong.
Schwarzenegger is often as hilari
ous and touching as he is big and
tough, and the opening sequence
of a naked Arnold securing
clothes, transportation and weap
ons is as good as they come.
From beginning to end, "Ter
minator 2" produces everything
you're expecting from this picture
and much more. To quote Rob
Reiner's "Spinal Tap": "This one
goes to 11."

Straight out of life
"Straight Out of Brooklyn,"
starring Ixtwrence Gilliard Jr.,
Mark Malone and Matty Rich
Perhaps you've heard about
this young black filmmaker. He
grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y. He
spent some time studying film at
New York University. His first film
was made for only $70,000.
No, he isn't Spike Lee.
He's 19-year-old Matty Rich
and with the release of "Straight
Out of Brooklyn" — a film based
in part on Rich's experiences at
the Red Hook housing projects
where he spent much of his life —
he has become the youngest
American director ever to make a
commercially released feature.
Unlike Lee, Rich comes to
filmmaking with little formal
training in the art. But the honesty
with which he portrays life in the
projects compensates for the
film's lack of structure and cine
matography.
Rich tells the story of Dennis
Brown, a young man who is full of
anger and looking for a way out of
Red Hook. Stifled by an alcoholic,
wife-beating father and a neigh
borhood filled with drugs and vio
lence, Dennis tries to convince his
friends to commit a robbery. For
him, money is the only ticket out.
Lawrence Gilliard Jr. as Dennis
is the weak link in a cast of no
frills actors, and his persistent
anger does not compensate for his
lack of natural charisma. Far more
appealing are his comic sidekicks,

The honesty with
which Matty Rich
portrays life in the
projects compensates
for the film's lack of
structure.

Kevin (Mark Malone) and Larry
Love, played well by Rich himself.
The film is most effective when
it isn't angry; one quickly grows
weary of watching characters yell
at one another. Rich's frequent
use of the volume knob does
express his own frustration with
the lives these people are leading,
but too often the tragic turns
comedic with the extreme inten
sity of the emotions on the screen.
When the film works, it works
with great power. George Odom
and Ann Sanders give sensitive
portrayals of Dennis' parents and
the complex lives they lead. They
keep the film from becoming just
another television after-school
special.
Odom's character blames the
white man for "destroying" him by
sending him to Vietnam and by
keeping him in poverty. Not sur
prisingly, neither of the white
characters who appear briefly in
the film can be construed as
remotely redeemable.
Rich's film seems to indicate
that there is hope for a way out of
Red Hook, but he demonstrates
that crime is certainly not the way.
The film offers no indication of
what will become of the charac
ters at the film's end. Rich leaves
the viewer not with an answer, but
only with a challenge: "First
things learned are the hardest to
forget. Traditions pass from one
generation to the next. We need to
change."
"Straight Out of Brooklyn" is
well worth seeing. Simply keep in
mind the other story, the real-life
conditions that brought this film
into being.
Look out, Spike Lee.
