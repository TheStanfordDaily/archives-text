Editor's picks:
Don't miss these films
• "Jungle Fever" — Although Spike Lee's
latest venture is, as expected, difficult to
untangle, it's thought-provoking and brings
up issues well worth discussing. Take your
friends and be prepared for lengthy post
film conversation.
• "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" — Arnold
Schwarzenegger's back as the unstoppable
cyborg from the future in the high-tech
action picture destined to redefine the

genre. The film has humor and emotion,
but most of all, the best visual effects ever
produced.
New film releases:
Opening today:
• "Terminator II: Judgment Day" — Get in
line now.
• "Problem Child 2" — Can you think of a
less deserved sequel? How about "Man
nequin 2"?
• "Europa Europa"
Opening Friday:
• "Dark Obsession" — This one's rated
NC-17 and stars Amanda Donohoe, who
was part of the first prime-time lesbian kiss

on "L.A. Law" last season.
•"Shadows"
