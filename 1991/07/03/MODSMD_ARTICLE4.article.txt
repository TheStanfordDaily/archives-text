## Column A 						new kind of prejudice 
### 
Have you ever thought about
musical prejudice?
Last Christmas Eve when
I opened a gift from my grand
mother and found a Mozart com
pact disc, my relatives teased me
, about how sophisticated I had
become. Not that they ever really
knew what type of music I liked in
the first place; it's just that in my
family, as far as I can tell, no one
listens to or knows much about
classical music.
I'm not saying that my family is
ignorant or tasteless. It's just that,
having never been exposed to
classical music, my relatives have
convinced themselves that it is
somehow too elite or too complex
for them.
They seem to have no idea that
they, too, could derive pleasure
from a Chopin nocturne or a Bach
cantata. Feeling unable to relate
to Mozart, they can only make
jokes.
It's amazing how many people
hold preconceived notions about
entire classes of music. Ask a
Stanford student what type of
music he or she likes and the typi
cal response will be, "Well, I like
all kinds. But definitely not coun
try!"
Now personally, I'd be one of
the last people to start a country
music movement on campus, but
then again, I would not start a rap
group, a Top-40 association, or a
heavy-metal society either.
Admittedly, most of the music
that falls under these genres is
mediocre at best. I would go so far
as to say that the majority of all
music is pretty forgettable. And
yet I have heard some elegant,
tastefully performed country
songs.
My point is that no piece of
music should be dismissed before
it has been heard. By pigeonholing
music into strict categories, we run
the risk of missing out on some
worthwhile musical moments. It
may be argued that some cate
gories are inherently more worth
while than others and it would be
ridiculous to try to compare a
Beethoven string quartet to a Ste
vie Wonder tune, but both do have
artistic merit.
So many people wear blinders
when it comes to choosing music.
I know several people who pride
themselves on their "alternative"
music collections. They rave about
some obscure group, only to aban
don their loyalties as soon as the
group becomes even vaguely well
known.
While I admire such individu
als' initiative in seeking out new
music, I often think they are moti
vated less by the music than by the
need to feel more avant-garde
than the next guy.
These people often say things
like, "I would listen to (such-and
such), but it's just so overdone."
While it can get boring to listen to
music that has been overplayed,
no number of repetitions can
change the fact that a truly great
piece is worth hearing.
On the other hand, some peo
ple go to the other extreme.
Instead of continually seeking out
something new, they are content
with whatever Casey Kasem deals
out.
My old roommate used to lis
ten to the same radio station all
day long. This wasn't so bad in
itself, except that it was one of
those stations that played a grand
total of about eight songs in any
given day. Of course, as the disc
jockey never tired of reminding
us, these were the most popular

songs in the nation! But that was
no consolation.
For my own sanity, I would ask
my roommate why he didn't
change the station occasionally.
He always said he was happy just
listening to whatever "they"
decided to play. Unfortunately,
"they" usually had terrible taste.
I once had a friend who was
very into music. She listened to all
kinds of great classical stuff, but
claimed to despise everything
else. I challenged her:
"Ah, but you must like the Bea
tles!"
No reply.
"Surely you like Paul Simon."
"No. And stop calling me
Shirley ... you can call me Al."
By now, terribly frustrated, not
to mention quite confused, I gave
up. But later that quarter, my
friend announced that she had
found a pop singer whose work
she liked. My mind raced with
plausible possibilities: "Michael
Feinstein? Tracy Chapman? Deb
bie Wicks?"
Now I swear, I'm not making
this up (at least not this part):
"Well, his name is Rick Astley,
with a't', and his songs are really
great," she exclaimed excitedly.
For the uninitiated, Rick Ast
ley is th;i '90s answer to bubble
gum and bobby sox. He actually
has quite a good voice, but his
material is cheesier than a deep
dish pizza. His songs do tend to be
quite catchy, but for the life of me,
I couldn't understand how some
one as musically inclined as my
friend could possibly hold Astley
above all other popular musicians.
Upon further prodding, I dis
covered that my friend had never
really listened to anything except
classical music her whole life.
She hadn't grown up hearing
her mom and dad play Frank
Sinatra or Herb Alpert (and here
I thought everyone's parents
owned that album with the naked
woman on the cover). Her older
brother hadn't been a Beatlema
niac. She hadn't frequented local
jazz clubs. She had missed the
disco craze.
There were entire genres of
music entirely foreign to this
woman. Yet, for some reason, she
had come to assume that she
wouldn't like what she hadn't
even heard. Astley's was the first
"non-serious" music she had
really given a chance.
Well, I'm not sure what music
my friend is listening to these
days. Her folks are probably still
sitting around darting suspicious
sideways glances at the mention of
Gershwin: "He wrote some popu
lar songs, too, you know."
Meanwhile, my family makes
nervous jokes at mere allusions to
counterpoint. If both sides could
strip away their prejudices, maybe
we all could reach some sort of
middle ground.

the last people to start a country
music movement on campus, but
then again, I would not start a rap
group, a Top-40 association, or a
heavy-metal society either.
Admittedly, most of the music
that falls under these genres is
mediocre at best. I would go so far
as to say that the majority of all
music is pretty forgettable. And
yet I have heard some elegant,
tastefully performed country
songs.
My point is that no piece of
music should be dismissed before
it has been heard. By pigeonholing
music into strict categories, we run
the risk of missing out on some
worthwhile musical moments. It
may be argued that some cate
gories are inherently more worth
while than others and it would be
ridiculous to try to compare a
Beethoven string quartet to a Ste

artistic merit.
So many people wear blinders

I know several people who pride
themselves on their "alternative"
music collections. They rave about
some obscure group, only to aban
don their loyalties as soon as the
group becomes even vaguely well
known.
While I admire such individu

music, I often think they are moti
vated less by the music than by the
need to feel more avant-garde

These people often say things
like, "I would listen to (such-and
such), but it's just so overdone."
While it can get boring to listen to
music that has been overplayed,
no number of repetitions can
change the fact that a truly great
piece is worth hearing.

My old roommate used to lis
ten to the same radio station all
day long. This wasn't so bad in
itself, except that it was one of
those stations that played a grand
total of about eight songs in any
given day. Of course, as the disc
jockey never tired of reminding
us, these were the most popular

songs in the nation! But that was
no consolation.
For my own sanity, I would ask
my roommate why he didn't
change the station occasionally.
He always said he was happy just
listening to whatever "they"
decided to play. Unfortunately,
"they" usually had terrible taste.
I once had a friend who was
very into music. She listened to all
kinds of great classical stuff, but
claimed to despise everything
else. I challenged her:
"Ah, but you must like the Bea
tles!"
No reply.
"Surely you like Paul Simon."
"No. And stop calling me
Shirley ... you can call me Al."
By now, terribly frustrated, not
to mention quite confused, I gave
up. But later that quarter, my
friend announced that she had
found a pop singer whose work
she liked. My mind raced with
plausible possibilities: "Michael
Feinstein? Tracy Chapman? Deb
bie Wicks?"
Now I swear, I'm not making
this up (at least not this part):
"Well, his name is Rick Astley,
with a't', and his songs are really
great," she exclaimed excitedly.
For the uninitiated, Rick Ast
ley is th;i '90s answer to bubble
gum and bobby sox. He actually
has quite a good voice, but his
material is cheesier than a deep
dish pizza. His songs do tend to be
quite catchy, but for the life of me,
I couldn't understand how some
one as musically inclined as my
friend could possibly hold Astley
above all other popular musicians.
Upon further prodding, I dis
covered that my friend had never
really listened to anything except
classical music her whole life.
She hadn't grown up hearing
her mom and dad play Frank
Sinatra or Herb Alpert (and here
I thought everyone's parents
owned that album with the naked
woman on the cover). Her older
brother hadn't been a Beatlema
niac. She hadn't frequented local
jazz clubs. She had missed the
disco craze.
There were entire genres of
music entirely foreign to this
woman. Yet, for some reason, she
had come to assume that she
wouldn't like what she hadn't
even heard. Astley's was the first
"non-serious" music she had
really given a chance.
Well, I'm not sure what music
my friend is listening to these
days. Her folks are probably still
sitting around darting suspicious
sideways glances at the mention of
Gershwin: "He wrote some popu
lar songs, too, you know."
Meanwhile, my family makes
nervous jokes at mere allusions to
counterpoint. If both sides could
strip away their prejudices, maybe
we all could reach some sort of
middle ground.

Have you ever thought about
musical prejudice?
Last Christmas Eve when
I opened a gift from my grand
mother and found a Mozart com
pact disc, my relatives teased me
, about how sophisticated I had
become. Not that they ever really
knew what type of music I liked in
the first place; it's just that in my
family, as far as I can tell, no one
listens to or knows much about
classical music.
I'm not saying that my family is
ignorant or tasteless. It's just that,
having never been exposed to
classical music, my relatives have
convinced themselves that it is
somehow too elite or too complex
for them.
They seem to have no idea that
they, too, could derive pleasure
from a Chopin nocturne or a Bach
cantata. Feeling unable to relate
to Mozart, they can only make
jokes.
It's amazing how many people
hold preconceived notions about
entire classes of music. Ask a
Stanford student what type of
music he or she likes and the typi
cal response will be, "Well, I like
all kinds. But definitely not coun
try!"
Now personally, I'd be one of
the last people to start a country
music movement on campus, but
then again, I would not start a rap
group, a Top-40 association, or a
heavy-metal society either.
