## Bush domestic program invisible to the naked eye 
### 
If there is one aspect of "The Naked Gun TA: The
Smell of Fear" that makes it a little less humor
ous than the original, it may well be that the
sequel's plot is too easy to believe.
Of course, no audiences really thought that base
ball player Reggie Jackson would actually shoot
Queen Elizabeth in the middle of a crowded ball
park — the plot of the"The Naked Gun." But there
was something about the sequel's plot — in which
sleazy oil magnates attempt to control President
George Bush's energy policy — that seemed too real
to live up to the outrageous humor that made "The
Naked Gun" a hit.
In fact, reflecting on "The Naked Gun 2'A" and
the current state of national domestic policy, two
and a half years after Bush took office, one can't
help surmising that the Bush energy policy more
closely resembles the one producer David Zucker's
villains tried to foist upon an unsuspecting nation
than the one we got after Lt. Frank Drebin clumsily
saved the day.
After fighting a victorious war necessitated
largely by American dependence on a foreign oil
market, Bush unveiled an energy plan that ignored
energy conservation and failed to look for alternate
energy sources within the nation's borders.
But the administration's blindness to American
needs on this domestic issue is symptomatic of its
general attitude toward domestic affairs — an
approach that even party loyalists are beginning to
question.
This week, Health, Education and Welfare Secre
tary Jack Kemp, a member of that conservative wing
of the Republican Party not generally known for its
enthusiasm for social programs, railed at the Bush
administration for ignoring Cabinet proposals for an
attack on poverty.
The New York Times reported that Kemp was

quietly told by administration officials that they
didn't want to launch any major anti-poverty pro
grams lest the electorate expect results by the 1992
election.
Education isn't faring much better under the
"education president," as Bush has called himself.
This week Congress approved an education budget
that was only 2 percent greater than last year's edu
cation spending — not enough to cover inflation, but
still more than the Bush administration had wanted.
In the face of a need for a bill that will protect
employees from discrimination on the basis of race,
gender and physical handicap, Bush vetoed last
year's civil rights bill and has announced his inten
tion to veto this year's bill as well.
Despite repeated attempts by a group of moder
ate Republicans to broker a compromise with the
White House, the administration has been unyield
ing, seeming more intent on portraying the
Democrats as the party of quotas than on accom
plishing what both sides concede is much-needed
legislation.
And despite language that explicitly forbids quo
tas, Bush still insists on labeling the bill a "quota
bill," capitalizing on a fear of racial quotas that was
exploited with extreme success by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R.-N.C., in his campaign for re-election last fall.
A recent poll shows that the tactic is working: a
majority of Americans believe that the Democratic
Party is in favor of racial quotas.
Riding the crest of post-war popularity and seem
ingly invulnerable to electoral defeat, Bush seemed
capable, four months ago, of commanding broad
congressional support and launching a dynamic pro
gram of domestic policy. It is an opportunity on
which Bush has not even tried to capitalize.
The lesson for Zucker, and other movie produc
ers, should be clear: it's hard to parody something
that is already ridiculous.
