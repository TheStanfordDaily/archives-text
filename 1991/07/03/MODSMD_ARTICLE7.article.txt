USW will bargain
for better pay for
female employees
While vacationing in Boston
recently, I was shocked to see the
following headline in the New
England newspaper: "Surgeon
Quits, Cites Stanford Sexism."
Whereas we all applaud the Med
ical School dean who is attempt
ing to reinstate Dr. Conley, we
have to examine the source that
allows such conditions to fester.
Stanford is becoming infamous
for being run by attorneys who
only seek to limit the University's
liability. The United Stanford
Workers — the union that repre

sents the 1,300 technical, service
and maintenance workers at Stan
ford — has fought an eight-year
battle with Stanford to get a group
of predominantly female, life-sci
ence technicians at the Medical
Center equal pay for equal work.
During that time period, Stan
ford has repeatedly denied these
women equal pay for equal work
during contract negotiations, leav
ing the USW the option of taking
it or going on strike.
During a seven-year arbitration
on this matter, the University has
used every tactic for delay and
legal obstruction of procedural
matters to defeat the case. Stan
ford has never addressed the mer
its of the issue. Now, based on the
arbitrator's encouragement, the
USW will be seeking suit against

the University based on sexual dis
crimination.
As the USW enters contract
negotiations with Stanford this
summer, we still hope to clear this
matter up at the bargaining table
and win pay equity for the life-sci
ence technicians at the Medical
Center. However, we do have to
question, as Conley did, the atmo
sphere that permits such sexism to
exist. We can only hope there will
be higher voices in the University
that will encourage Stanford's
bargaining team to agree to end
sexual discrimination in pay
instead of worrying solely about
the University's "liability."
