# S. Korean leader sweeps through Stanford
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo
last weekend reaffirmed his support for the
spread of democracy and market
economies and suggested that his country
could play an important role among Pacific
rim countries in the future.
Speaking at the Hoover Institution to a
group of 130 fellows, Stanford faculty, busi
ness leaders and other guests, Roh cited
Korea as an example of a developing coun
try's potential for growth and discussed the
success of re-established relations with
China and the Soviet Union.
His address also marked the fourth
anniversary of his June 2 ( ), 1987 Declara
tion of Democratic Reform, which
promised sweeping political changes
including direct presidential elections and
democratization.
The South Korean leader's Hoover
speech kicked off his visit to North Amer
ica. Roh said he was pleased about warming
relations with North Korea and its decision
to enter the United Nations in September
at the same time as South Korea.
In his summit meeting with President
Bush yesterday, Roh said he hoped the two
Koreas would be reunited before the turn
of the century. He is also scheduled to meet
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
before returning to South Korea.
In his Hoover address, Roh also spent
much time broadly discussing Korea's
future as a growing "middle" power. "We
have been seriously reflecting on what con
tribution Korea should make and what
roles the Korean people should play in the
New World Order. I believe that Korea's
unique historical experience and achieve
ments encourage us to play a meaningful
role in this promising world of change," he
said.
After arriving in a motorcade with more
than 20 cars, Roh and his wife, Kim Ock
Sook, were met by former Secretary of
State and Distinguished Hoover Fellow
George Shultz and Hoover Director John
Raisian. He was accompanied by a large
entourage, including the Korean foreign
ministers, commerce ministers and other
government officials.
Roll's son and daughter have both stud
ied at Stanford.
Security for the event was tight, and bar
ricades were set up several blocks from the
Institution. On Friday, a firebomb had been
thrown through the window of the Korean
consulate in San Francisco. Roh was not
staying there and no one was injured in the
attack.
Roh spoke for about 35 minutes in
Stauffer Auditorium after a luncheon with
the invited guests. Speaking through a
translator, he noted the progress during the
past two years in the spread of democracy
and market economies.

He proposed four plans for taking these
reforms further. In order to remove "the
last vestiges of the Cold War," the Pacific
countries, including Korea, must "actively
support China and the Soviet Union in
their pursuit of development, free market
economies and democratic choices," he
said.
At the same time, the United States
needs to maintain a role in the area. "His
tory demonstrates that whenever the role of
the United States was reduced in this
region, the resulting vacuum was quickly
filled by the forces of instability," he added.
Second, he discussed the need to work
for sustained prosperity in the region

through economic cooper
ation and continued free
trade. "Every country in
the region should open its
market commensurate
with its economic ability
and stage of develop
ment," he said.
This cooperation needs
to be based on the "diver
sity of economic structures,
developmental stages, cul
tures and ethnic origins" of
the different states in the
area, he said.
Finally, he suggested
developing a formal
framework to help meet
these objectives. He
warned of the danger of
the fragmentation of dif
ferent groups within the
region "because sub
regionalism tends to cause
friction and rivalry and
contributes to protection
ist tendencies."
Roh also focused on the
student protests that had
occurred during the past
two months in South
Korea. He called the
protesters — who
demanded his resignation
and the formation of a new
government — "oppor
tunistic radicals seeking to
overthrow the democratic
system itself by means of
violent class struggle."
As he criticized the
Korean student rioters,
about 20 people — some
members of a group called
Young Koreans United —
demonstrated behind the
barricades in front of
Encina Hall — as close as
they could get to the South
Korean president.
Protesters, dancing to
beating drums that could
be heard at the entrance to

the Institution, chanted "Free the prison
ers" and "Down with Roh Tae Woo — mur
derer." Others yelled out, "One Korea yes,
two Koreas no!"
The group displayed a number of white,
yellow and blue banners and signs, in
Korean and English. One said: "U.S. troops
and nukes out of S. Korea." Others fol
lowed the theme of the chants: "Down with
the murderer Roh Tae Woo" and "Free
1,500 political prisoners in S. Korea."
Roh entered Hoover on the side of the
building opposite the protesters.
Inside, Roh answered a question posed
by Shultz about the reasons behind the
demonstrations in Korea.

Roh responded with some support for
the original goals of the student movement.
"We have had long periods of dictatorial
and authoritarian rule," which "the major
ity of the Korean people were against," he
said. Students were at the forefront of the
national protest movement and they were
supported by the people.
But given the political reforms since
1987, popular support for the continued
demonstrations has waned, Roh said. In the
recent city and provincial elections. Roh's
ruling party won by landslide.
This shows that the people are satisfied
with the progress of reforms, he said.
As the student movements have become

more visible and violent, the
actual number of protesters has
decreased, he added.
In response to another ques
tion, Roh called the possibility
that North Korea could develop
nuclear weapons a "most dan
gerous situation" but said he was
sure "we can succeed in imple
menting the correct pressures to
[cause] North Korea to renounce
the development of nuclear
weapons."
At the end of the speech,
Shultz presented Roh with a
glass bowl etched as a globe with
an inscription commemorating
the event.
Reaction from Hoover schol
ars who attended the speech was
positive.
It was an "optimistic speech
suggesting that the Republic of
South Korea looks forward to
good relations with regional
neighbors," said Ramon Myers,
curator of the East Asia collec
tion at the Institution.
"His own country is doing
fairly well. He was very proud
that the ruling party had done
well in recent elections."
Hoover Deputy Director
Charles Palm said "he's made
definite progress in terms of cre
ating an open society," although
the Korean people do face some
real challenges.
The event went off "without a
hitch," Palm said, adding that he
thought Roh and his wife
enjoyed their Hoover visit.
After the speech, Roh visited
a special exhibit of items from
three parts of the Hoover
archives — the early Russian,
World War II and Korean col
lections, according to Hoover
Archivist Ann Van Camp.
Roh also gave the Institution
an 11-volume history of the
Korean War prepared by the
Korean defense department.

The South Korean leader's Hoover
speech kicked off his visit to North Amer
ica. Roh said he was pleased about warming
relations with North Korea and its decision
to enter the United Nations in September
at the same time as South Korea.
In his summit meeting with President
Bush yesterday, Roh said he hoped the two
Koreas would be reunited before the turn
of the century. He is also scheduled to meet
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
before returning to South Korea.
In his Hoover address, Roh also spent
much time broadly discussing Korea's
future as a growing "middle" power. "We
have been seriously reflecting on what con
tribution Korea should make and what
roles the Korean people should play in the
New World Order. I believe that Korea's
unique historical experience and achieve
ments encourage us to play a meaningful
role in this promising world of change," he
said.
After arriving in a motorcade with more
than 20 cars, Roh and his wife, Kim Ock
Sook, were met by former Secretary of
State and Distinguished Hoover Fellow
George Shultz and Hoover Director John
Raisian. He was accompanied by a large
entourage, including the Korean foreign
ministers, commerce ministers and other
government officials.
Roll's son and daughter have both stud
ied at Stanford.
Security for the event was tight, and bar
ricades were set up several blocks from the
Institution. On Friday, a firebomb had been
thrown through the window of the Korean
consulate in San Francisco. Roh was not
staying there and no one was injured in the
attack.
Roh spoke for about 35 minutes in
Stauffer Auditorium after a luncheon with
the invited guests. Speaking through a
translator, he noted the progress during the
past two years in the spread of democracy
and market economies.

He proposed four plans for taking these
reforms further. In order to remove "the
last vestiges of the Cold War," the Pacific
countries, including Korea, must "actively
support China and the Soviet Union in
their pursuit of development, free market
economies and democratic choices," he
said.
At the same time, the United States
needs to maintain a role in the area. "His
tory demonstrates that whenever the role of
the United States was reduced in this
region, the resulting vacuum was quickly
filled by the forces of instability," he added.
Second, he discussed the need to work
for sustained prosperity in the region

through economic cooper
ation and continued free
trade. "Every country in
the region should open its
market commensurate
with its economic ability
and stage of develop
ment," he said.
This cooperation needs
to be based on the "diver
sity of economic structures,
developmental stages, cul
tures and ethnic origins" of
the different states in the
area, he said.
Finally, he suggested
developing a formal
framework to help meet
these objectives. He
warned of the danger of
the fragmentation of dif
ferent groups within the
region "because sub
regionalism tends to cause
friction and rivalry and
contributes to protection
ist tendencies."
Roh also focused on the
student protests that had
occurred during the past
two months in South
Korea. He called the
protesters — who
demanded his resignation
and the formation of a new
government — "oppor
tunistic radicals seeking to
overthrow the democratic
system itself by means of
violent class struggle."
As he criticized the
Korean student rioters,
about 20 people — some
members of a group called
Young Koreans United —
demonstrated behind the
barricades in front of
Encina Hall — as close as
they could get to the South
Korean president.
Protesters, dancing to
beating drums that could
be heard at the entrance to

the Institution, chanted "Free the prison
ers" and "Down with Roh Tae Woo — mur
derer." Others yelled out, "One Korea yes,
two Koreas no!"
The group displayed a number of white,
yellow and blue banners and signs, in
Korean and English. One said: "U.S. troops
and nukes out of S. Korea." Others fol
lowed the theme of the chants: "Down with
the murderer Roh Tae Woo" and "Free
1,500 political prisoners in S. Korea."
Roh entered Hoover on the side of the
building opposite the protesters.
Inside, Roh answered a question posed
by Shultz about the reasons behind the
demonstrations in Korea.

Roh responded with some support for
the original goals of the student movement.
"We have had long periods of dictatorial
and authoritarian rule," which "the major
ity of the Korean people were against," he
said. Students were at the forefront of the
national protest movement and they were
supported by the people.
But given the political reforms since
1987, popular support for the continued
demonstrations has waned, Roh said. In the
recent city and provincial elections. Roh's
ruling party won by landslide.
This shows that the people are satisfied
with the progress of reforms, he said.
As the student movements have become

more visible and violent, the
actual number of protesters has
decreased, he added.
In response to another ques
tion, Roh called the possibility
that North Korea could develop
nuclear weapons a "most dan
gerous situation" but said he was
sure "we can succeed in imple
menting the correct pressures to
[cause] North Korea to renounce
the development of nuclear
weapons."
At the end of the speech,
Shultz presented Roh with a
glass bowl etched as a globe with
an inscription commemorating
the event.
Reaction from Hoover schol
ars who attended the speech was
positive.
It was an "optimistic speech
suggesting that the Republic of
South Korea looks forward to
good relations with regional
neighbors," said Ramon Myers,
curator of the East Asia collec
tion at the Institution.
"His own country is doing
fairly well. He was very proud
that the ruling party had done
well in recent elections."
Hoover Deputy Director
Charles Palm said "he's made
definite progress in terms of cre
ating an open society," although
the Korean people do face some
real challenges.
The event went off "without a
hitch," Palm said, adding that he
thought Roh and his wife
enjoyed their Hoover visit.
After the speech, Roh visited
a special exhibit of items from
three parts of the Hoover
archives — the early Russian,
World War II and Korean col
lections, according to Hoover
Archivist Ann Van Camp.
Roh also gave the Institution
an 11-volume history of the
Korean War prepared by the
Korean defense department.

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo

Speaking at the Hoover Institution to a

Korea as an example of a developing coun

success of re-established relations with
China and the Soviet Union.
