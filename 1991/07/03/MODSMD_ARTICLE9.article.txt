## Stanford offers new cost rate 
### 
Stanford has proposed an indi
rect-cost rate of 76 percent for
next year — a rate that would
come close to restoring the level
of reimbursement the University
received on federal research
grants before its troubles with the
government began.
But given ongoing federal
reform efforts and the current
political climate surrounding the
issue, University and government
officials agree it is highly unlikely
that the proposal will survive
upcoming negotiations.
In late August, teams from
Stanford and the Office of Naval
Research will butt heads again to
determine a working indirect-cost
rate for next year as well as a final
rate for the current year.
Stanford will be squaring off
against the same negotiators who
unilaterally cut this year's rate to
55.5 percent — a move that
resulted in a $28 million loss to
the University.
The negotiations will also be
taking place amid several White
House and congressional reform
efforts aimed at limiting the level
of reimbursement universities can
claim for various components of
indirect-cost recovery. Indirect
costs are those expenses such as
utilities, libraries and building
depreciation, which are necessary
for conducting research but are
not easily attributable to a single
project.
"Given the current climate, we
recognize that the number we've
calculated is way out of line with
what is likely to come out of nego
tiations," Dean of Research
Robert Byer said in an interview
yesterday.
"The ground under which

we're doing these
negotiations is
shifting," Byer
said.
The University's
proposal was
submitted to the
Office of Naval
Research on Mon
day, as the naval
office had re-

quested. It was met by extreme
skepticism from several govern
ment officials.
Paul Biddle, the Navy regulator
whose allegations of past wrong
doing sparked the controversy
over Stanford's practices, called
the 76 percent proposal "out
landish."
"People in government I've
spoken to, including some people
back in Washington, are very dis
appointed," Biddle said. Biddle is
expected to be among the negotia
tors representing the Navy in
August.
He said yesterday that he
thought the rate of 55.5 perccnt
imposed by the Navy in April was
"generous."
Reaction to the proposal was
not favorable either from the
House Subcommittee on Over
sight and Investigations, which
held a punishing nine-hour hear
ing on Stanford's cost-recovery
practices in mid-March.
A staff member of the subcom
mittee laughed out loud when
asked about the proposal. "I think
76 percent is ludicrous based on
what we know today," he said,
speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
"Maybe the yacht needs a new
coat of varnish," he added, refer
ring to depreciation charges on
the 72-foot yacht Victoria, which
the subcommittee discovered
Stanford had included in its
indirect cost claims for several
years.
Stanford's proposal was made

with the assistance of Big Six
accounting firm Arthur Andersen
& Co.
Byer stressed that rate of 76
percent was calculated based on
current government regulations.
"We know that changing stan
dards and upcoming negotiations
are unlikely to produce a rate that
fully reimburses our costs," he
said.
The 76 percent rate includes a
base rate of 72 percent, plus a pro
jected 6-point "carryforward" —
reimbursement delayed from pre
vious years — minus a 2-point
"decrement," a safety margin for
audit and negotiation.
Stanford proposed a rate of 78
percent for the current 1990-91
year. Following Biddle's allega
tions of massive overpayment, the
Navy established a temporary rate
of 74 percent last fall. During the
next several months, the rate was
knocked down twice, first to 72
percent, then to 70 percent.
In late April, the Navy unilater
ally terminated close to 100
accounting agreements with the
University and set the rate at 55.5
percent, retroactive to the begin
ning of the academic year.
While the much lower rate has

caused a serious
cash flow prob
lem for the Uni
versity, the rate
for 1990-91 has
yet to be final
ized. That issue
will also be on the
table in late Aug
ust. University
administrators

have said in the past that they
hope to justify a final level of
reimbursement far higher than
55.5 percent.
Each point in the indirect-cost
rate translates into about $1.25
million in revenue for the Univer
sity.
In a related development, the
White House's Office of Manage
ment and Budget formally pro
posed a cap on one of the most
costly components of indirect
costs — administrative expenses
— in the Federal Register. Follow
ing a 30-day comment period, the

proposal, which caps administra
tive costs at 26 percent, is likely to
become law.
Stanford, whose administrative
rate is close to 29 percent, plans to
comment within the next few
weeks.
The Association of American
Universities, a higher education
lobbying group, estimates that a
26 percent administrative cap
would cost universities nationwide
$55 million a year.
