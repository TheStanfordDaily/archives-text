## 'Non-essential' cooling limited 
### 
University officials have
decided to reduce the use of air
conditioning in many buildings
and to try to turn it off entirely in
other areas in order to conserve
energy.
Air conditioning will continue
in so-called priority areas, includ
ing Stanford Hospital and com
puter and research facilities that
need it to operate, said Utilities
Manager David Kaye. He added
that he hopes to reduce the use of
air conditioning in some of these
areas by 50 percent.

In other "non
essential" areas
with working win
dows or other
forms of ventila
tion, Operations
and Maintenance
will try to keep
the air condition
ing off, Kaye said.
Kaye would

not specify which buildings would
continue to have air conditioning,
and the distribution will probably
change as Operations and Main
tenance determines what areas
need more cooling.
Air-conditioning needs will be
examined on a building-by-build
ing basis, Kaye said. In more mod
ern buildings, air conditioning can
be restricted to the areas that
require it.
But many older buildings do
not have this capability, and air
conditioning throughout a build
ing might have to be turned on
because of a particular area, Kaye
said.
Operations and Maintenance
will also try to "make maximum
use" of colder night temperatures
to circulate cold air in buildings
and "keep discomfort levels to a
minimum," Kaye said.
The program is designed to
save money by reducing the need
for chilled water, which is used in
cooling systems in many Univer
sity buildings. The water is chilled
at the Cardinal Cogeneration
Plant, which also produces the
University's electricity and steam.
Producing less chilled water
should reduce fuel costs, Kaye
said.
Kaye said that because the
final level of chilled-water use has
not yet been determined, he is not
certain of the exact savings.
"There's not enough information
to make a prediction," he said,
adding that he plans to try to
make an assessment at the end of
this week.
"I want to see what is practical"
in terms of a cutback, Kaye said.
Vice President for Administra
tive Resources Susan Schaffer,
whose responsibilities include
overseeing Operations and Main
tenance, said "we're trying very
hard to make sure that we're not
overdoing it in places where we
might do harm."
During previous summers,
chilled-water costs have run as
high as $200,000 a month during
the warmer part of the year. "The
University has spent more than $1
million a year just on its chilled
water" in the past, Kaye said.
Schaffer said: "I think it's a
good decision. It's part of trying to
get a handle on our energy costs."
The reduction is part of Univer
sity-wide budget cutting and is
also "good business," she added.
"We've had an energy conser
vation program here but we really
think there's a lot more we can
do," Schaffer said.
The move comes after prob
lems that occurred during last
week's heat wave.
Because two chiller machines
were broken, the chilled-water

system could not accommodate
the rising temperatures, Kaye
said. When temperatures began to
rise, the chilled-water tempera
ture became too high to cool all of
the buildings that are a part of the
system.
Operations and Maintenance
had to prioritize and shut down
cooling in non-essential areas.
The lack of air conditioning
almost forced the shutdown of
many of the campus mainframe
computers, said Sandy Laws, asso
ciate director of operations for the
Stanford Data Center. It also
sparked numerous complaints
from people in warmer-than-nor
mal offices.
Although temperatures have
since dropped and one of the
chiller machines has been
repaired, administrators decided
to "keep things the way they are,"
Kaye said.
Although plans for conserving
energy through cutting back
chilled water had been discussed
before and last week's problems
were not a direct cause of the
decision, "it seemed like an
appropriate time" to cut back,
Schaffer said.
