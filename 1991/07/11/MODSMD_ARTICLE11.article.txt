# USW, Stanford to square off
## 
### 
Tomorrow marks the beginning
of the seventh University-USW
contract negotiations in the last 18
years.
This time around, the theme is
equality, according to Michael
Tatham, the chief negotiator for
the United Stanford Workers.
The USW contract proposal,
which will be presented in detail
tomorrow, requests equal benefits
for all workers and pay raises
where government funds for those
have been allocated, among other
things.
Rough sailing may be ahead for
the negotiators. The University is
in the midst of a major financial
crisis that may make raises diffi
cult.
Tatham acknowledged this.
"We're going through the same
things the government went
through to recover overcharge
costs," he said. "Stanford tries to
use every dirty trick they can to
avoid giving us money."
Tatham said the University has
withheld information on health
and safety that he needed to pre
pare the initial proposal. He said
he had to go to the national labor
relations board for the data.
Michael Vartain, the Universi
ty representative, said the infor
mation has "been a matter of
negotiation."
Vartain remained tight-lipped
about University strategy. He said
"The Stanford negotiating team
and the USW Local 680 by mutu
al agreement have set their first
face-to-face collective bargaining
session for this Friday, July 12."
Tatham said he hopes negotia
tions are over by the Centennial
Weekend in September. "We all
want to be able to enjoy the cele
bration and we won't be able to do
that if we're on strike."
