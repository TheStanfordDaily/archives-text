# Truce reached in parking war
## 
### 
Stanford officials agreed Mon
day night to set up a temporary
parking area for users of the
Foothills, changing a previous
decision to block off the area.
The parking area, situated on a
triangular piece of land next to
Gerona Road, had long been
unofficially used by people who
use the Foothills for jogging, sight
seeing and walking with children.

When the University last
month blocked access to the
"Gerona triangle" after receiving
complaints from residents on the
street, many of the users of the
Foothills, who live in local com
munities such as Menlo Park and
Palo Alto, were livid.
They claimed it was an attempt
by Stanford to deter use of the
Foothills, which are owned by the
University but have been open to
the public since 1986.
"The perception seems to be
that we're trying to close down the
Foothills," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. "That's
not the case at all," he added, not
ing that parking is still available at
Tresidder Union, a quarter mile
away. "We'd like people to use the
Foothills, as long as they don't
misuse the area around them."
Residents along Gerona Road,
mostly Stanford faculty and staff,
had complained of dust and litter
from the unofficial parking area,
which at times contained more
than 100 cars. Herrington said the
cars also often presented a safety
hazard by blocking access for
emergency vehicles.
At Monday's meeting of Stan
ford planning representatives and
the Stanford Homeowners Associ
ation, a compromise was reached
as officials decided to offer limited
parking space in the Gerona area
on an experimental basis .
"We agreed to try and control
the parking without eliminating it
completely," said Charles Carter,
a campus planner. "On a trial
basis, we will move the barriers in
a way that provides a couple of

well-defined spaces."
Andrew Doty, director of com
munity and government relations,
added that the University "will try
some space there on an experi
mental basis, but not to the extent
that it was being used before."

The barriers
preventing access
to the area were
initially erected
after a meeting
between repre
sentatives of the
Departments of
Planning, Real
Estate and Land
Management,

Transportation and Parking, and
the police.
Many people then began to
park along Gerona Road, only to
find their cars ticketed.
The incident aroused ire in
Foothills users like Palo Alto resi
dent Jeff Whitneck, who jogs in
the Foothills several times each
week.
"I'd like to run past those
houses (on Gerona Road) and
shout ... at the residents," he
said, pausing from a jog on a hot
TUesday afternoon. "They should
be happy they live next to a place
like ttys."
Protests from Foothills users
included several phone calls to the
Planning Department and Stan
ford Police, as well as letters to
Campus Report and The Penin
sula Times TYibune. Mark Simon
of The Times TYibune also wrote a
column about the issue. Local res
idents claimed it wasn't very
"neighborly" of Stanford to hin

der access to the Foothills.
University officials deny that
pressure from local communities
caused them to reassess the ear
lier decision. Carter said the move
was motivated by suggestions
from the Foothills Oversight
Group, a body of Stanford staff
members that oversees use of the
Foothills.
"Some members of the Foot
hills Oversight Group thought it
wasn't entirely neighborly" not to
offer parking near the entrance to
the Foothills, said Carter.
However, "we were aware of
the ill will that it created with the
outside community," he added.
