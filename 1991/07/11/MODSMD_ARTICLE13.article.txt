College Bowl is an academic
quiz game that was a weekly televi
sion show for almost 13 years. Its
national popularity declined in the
1960s and 1970s when college stu

people in America that they had
been," said Tresidder Program

The summer tournament, along
with a similar one in the fall, is
used in part to recruit players for
Stanford's College Bowl team,
which competes in regional and
national tournaments in the
spring. This year's team placed
sixth in the country.
