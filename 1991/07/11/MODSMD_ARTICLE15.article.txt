# Cost review expected soon
## 
### 
An outside review of the Uni
versity's cost-accounting system is
expected to be made public within
the next two weeks.
The review, ordered by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy in
the wake of Stanford's indirect
cost controversy, will likely be
released late next week or early
the following week, according to
Larry Horton, associate vice pres
ident for public affairs.
Big Six accounting firm Arthur
Andersen & Co. has been con
ducting the review for the past six
months.
A draft report was reviewed in
June by an external advisory pane!
to Kennedy and by the Board of
Trustees' Audit Committee. But
the report "is not in final form
yet," according to Horton.
In the past, Kennedy and other
administrators have said the Uni
versity's accounting system has a
"disconnect," which allowed Hoov
er House expenses such as flower
arrangements and antiques to be
included in accounts charged in
part to the government as indirect
costs of federal research.

Separately,
Stanford officials
are preparing a
response to fed
eral indirect-cost
regulations re
cently proposed
by the White
House's Office of
Management and
Budget.

Under the proposal, adminis
trative costs — one of several
components of indirect-cost
recovery — would be capped at 26
percent of the direct costs of doing
research. Stanford's administra
tive rate is close to 28 percent,
according to University Controller
Frank Riddle. Each one-point
drop in Stanford's indirect-cost
rate translates into about a $1.25
million loss for the University.
The White House's proposal
was published in the Federal Reg
ister late last month. A comment
period on the proposal runs until
July 29. Horton said he hoped
Stanford's response would be
delivered at least 10 days before
the deadline.
The University's response will
be made public, Horton said.
