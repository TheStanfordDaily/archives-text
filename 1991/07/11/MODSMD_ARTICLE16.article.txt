# SLAC, radiation lab may merge
## 
### 
The University's two major
government-funded physics
research facilities may soon be
linked more closely under a new
contract and may eventually
merge into one organization.
The move would place the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory under the
same contract, simplifying their
administration and allow for more

cooperation between the institu
tions.
The University currently oper
ates both facilities under separate
management contracts with the
Department of Energy, which
funds the research. The depart
ment has asked to place both

under the same
contract.
Although no
definite decisions
have been made,
the directors of
both facilities
said it is likely
that the Univer
sity will agree to
do this.

What remains to be decided is
whether the two laboratories will
remain separate or whether the
radiation laboratory will become a
part of SLAC.
SLAC Director Burton Richter
predicted that a decision on the
issue would be made by the end of
the month.
Regardless of the ultimate
organization of the labs, having
one contract would create several
scientific and administrative ben
efits.
SLAC and the radiation labo
ratory have cooperated closely on
many issues during the past 15 to
20 years, and having one contract
would formalize this relationship.
The closer ties could allow the
radiation laboratory and SLAC to
work together on exploring new
technology. Radiation Laboratory
Director Arthur Bienenstock said,
"SLAC is developing techniques
for building very sophisticated
accelerators ... that will also be
very important to the future of
[investigating] synchrotron radia
tion. We see benefits to joint plan
ning" on these new accelerators.
In terms of administration, the

move would change the contract
structure for the radiation labora
tory. Currently, it operates under
what is known as a research and
development contract, which is
designed for small research
groups.
But the laboratory has grown

and is currently
used by about 600
scientists from
around the coun
try, Bienenstock
said.
Its needs would
be better suited
by the operation
and management
contract that

SLAC has, which is designed for
larger, national facilities, Richter
said.
SLAC's contract also gives it
more freedom in making deci
sions, especially those that must
be made on short notice involving
purchases, Bienenstock said.
Moving to a single contract would
give the radiation laboratory these
same abilities.
In addition, a single contract
would build on the current coop
eration between the two facilities
in environmental, safety and
health concerns, Bienenstock
said.
Discussion among administra
tors and faculty at the centers is
currently focusing on the advan
tages and disadvantages of the
two organizational arrangements
— whether the laboratories will
remain separate or merge.
Richter said having two sepa
rate labs would be preferable if
there were no scientific overlap
between the institutions.
Bienenstock declined to specify
which alternative he preferred.
