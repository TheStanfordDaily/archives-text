# Study calls for more research
## 
### 
More research on how students
learn, how to structure schools
and how best to educate minority
students is needed to combat
problems in U.S. schools, accord
ing to a new report by a Stanford
based education group.
The National Academy of Edu
cation, an organization of 75 edu
cation leaders and researchers,
published the report, "Research
and the Renewal of Education,"
which stressed the need for new,
innovative research.

Education Prof.
Michael Kirst, co
director of the
study, said U.S.
researchers and
education policy-*
makers are facing
very difficult di
lemmas that they
"are not exactly
sure how to deal
with."

In the past 20 years, according
to the report, federal spending
and incentive for educational
research have decreased sharply.
From 1973 to 1986, research fund
ing through the National Institute
of Education (now the Office of
Educational Research and
Improvement) dropped by more
than 80 percent, adjusted for
inflation.
The study blames the lack of
progress in U.S. schools on ineffi
cient leadership, vacillating
national priorities and lack of
funding for field research.
"We are fighting very large
scale problems with small-scale
resources, "Kirst said, referring to
the current lack of federal support

for new educational field re
search.
"Our education system spends
only one-half of 1 percent on
research. It's no wonder our
schools are not making sufficient
progress in improving academic
attainment and that the states and
local districts are struggling to
find answers."
At present, the federal govern
ment spends about 6 cents on
every tax dollar for educational
purposes, mostly geared toward
students with special needs and
development programs.
Kirst said the educational sys
tem could best benefit from
strong, focused research opera
tions, rather that the piecemeal
manner in which the Bush admin
istration has undertaken these
studies. Given a sufficient amount
of support, Kirst said that such
field work could do much to solve
"some very grave problems."
