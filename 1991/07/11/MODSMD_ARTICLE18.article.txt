# Stanford to see 56% of eclipse
## 
### 
From 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
today, the Stanford community
will view the last total eclipse of
the sun that will be visible until
the year 2132.
Since Stanford lies several hun
dred miles north of the prime con
tinental viewing site, located in
Mexico, sunlight in the area will
not be totally eliminated. At most,
the moon will cover 56 percent of
the sun.
For individuals in search of an
ideal method of viewing the solar
phenomena, the student solar
observatory will provide a conve
nient opportunity to safely watch
the eclipse on campus.
According to Ron Maynard, a
doctoral candidate in mechanical
engineering who teaches classes in
observational astronomy, the
observatory will have several tele
scopes available for student use.
The equipment will be set up with
solar filters to protect viewers'
eyes from the damaging effect of
the sun's rays.
To allow more people to view
the eclipse at one time, the obser
vatory will have a telescope set up
that will project the image onto a
screen, said Maynard.
The observatory is located next
to the 18th hole of the Stanford
Golf Course, off Junipero Serra
Boulevard near Campus Drive
West.
For those who do not plan on
visiting the observatory, it is
important to remember not to
look directly at an eclipse. Doing
so can allow the sun's rays to burn
a permanent image of the crescent
sun into the retina.
Safe methods of viewing the
eclipse include projecting the
image through a pinhole in a sheet
of cardboard onto a sheet of white
paper, or watching through a
piece of arc-welder's glass labeled
#14. Most other welder's glasses
will not provide adequate protec
tion.
