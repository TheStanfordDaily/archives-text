Simon and
Barclay recognized
the same need during
their internship at
the well-worn stucco
Santa Clara shelter:
The kids needed
something to do dur
ing the summer to
give their lives some
structure.
Their original
idea, after talking
with school princi
pals and education
professors, as well as
reading books, was to
develop a structured
curriculum that
"would be so fun the
kids wanted to do it,"
Simon says.
After day one,
however, that plan
had to be scrapped.
In the two weeks
since then, Barclay,
Simon and junior

"star volunteer," as

Sally is one of about 60 homeless kids
temporarily housed at the Family Living
Center, a homeless shelter for families in
Santa Clara. Her mother is staying with her
at the center. Her father is somewhere else,
although Sally believes he lives there, too.
The sand castles Sally sculpts on the cen
ter's playground are the closest thing she has
to a home of her own.
As a growing number of families like
Sally's are unable to afford housing, home
lessness has become an important issue for
policy-makers — and for scholars at
Stanford.
The University's Center for the Study of
Families, Children and Youth is in the midst
of "The Homeless Study," a two-year inves
tigation of the problem. Several Stanford
professors offer courses on homelessness.
One such class, taught by History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, requires students to complete an
internship at a shelter.
For Elizabeth Barclay and Mike Simon,
who took Camarillo's class, an internship
wasn't enough. Supported by a grant from
the Haas Public Service Center, the two have
founded a summer school at the Family
Living Center for kids like Sally.
The Haas center distributed 14 other
public service grants, each totaling $1,500.
Other recipients will be doing such things as
offering education about AIDS in the Soviet
Union and producing an educational video
for Latin American refugee women who
have been victims of domestic violence.
Both Barclay and Simon have had past
experience working with the homeless.
Simon, a senior majoring in American stud
ies, is the coordinator of the Stanford
Homeless Action Coalition. He spent spring
vacation working in Los Angeles-area home

less shelters.
Barclay, who recently graduated in
human biology, interviewed subjects for the
Homeless Study. She calls what she learned
from her volunteer experience "mindful
public service." A goal, she says, is to consid
er the complexity of the issues surrounding
homelessness.
"Good intentions without thought are a
scary thing," she says. "You have to know
what your role is and what it shouldn't be."
But Barclay doesn't claim to have all the
answers. "We don't have special knowledge.

well as numerous other volunteers, have
been playing it by ear. "Our strength is our
flexibility," Barclay says.
The day is broken into two segments
punctuated by a raisin break and lunchtime.
Mornings, the children, who range in age
from 5 to 12, rotate through three stations.
Jellinghaus teaches art. Barclay teaches sci
ence. Simon teachers "readers' theater" —
fables in play form where each child reads a
part.
Afternoons begin with 15 minutes of
supervised play, "so they don't degenerate

into violence," Simon jokes. An activity, such
as running a mock radio station, follows for
the children able to function in a group, as
well as individualized tutoring and math
exercises using playing cards.
Rather than focusing on classroom edu
cation, Simon and Barclay's main task has
been instilling social skills as well as provid
ing stability and fun. "A lot of education
must take place before academic learning
can happen," Barclay says, "turn-taking,
learning what behavior is healthy, what is
hurtful."

"You 're making the castle wrong," Sally
cries. "Use the wet sand." Her tears streak the
dirt on her face. A smaller girl, Sulma, throws
sand on Sally. Sulma and another child, Mary,
demolish the castle and laugh.
When children at the shelter are faced
with disappointment or frustration, they
often react in extremes. "The kids respond
to hurt disproportionately," Barclay says.
"When they don't get to go first, they throw
themselves on the floor and cry."
Barclay and Simon, as well as Jellinghaus,
who has volunteered almost every day since

the program began, have had to learn to
handle these and other outbursts. They all
acknowledge that Simon often has to take
the role of disciplinarian.
There is a list of rules written in colored
maimers on the wall. "It hurt to put that up,"
Barclay says, wincing.
No hitting is allowed. Neither are "motor
vehicles" — bikes, trikes and other personal
toys the kids try to sneak onto the play
ground. Respect — for teachers and class
mates — is also an order.
The volunteers try to "model positive
behavior," Barclay says. When someone
crosses the boundaries, he or she is admon
ished. Usually, the negative behavior stops,

if only for a while.

"Retards!" the shelter kids shout. They are
making fun of the mentally retarded people
who live in the next building over. When
Elizabeth hears the jeers, she exj)lains to the
children that "retarded people can't help it —
they were born that way."
She doesn't know whether her words have
had any effect. But the next day, Mike over
hears one girl repeat Elizabeth's defense —
word for word — to another child.
"Words can come back to you," Barclay
says. "I have a little hope — a
very little — that it does do
something."

The worst punishment
Barclay and Simon will inflict
on a child is a day spent in the
office, doing nothing.
Solitude is a terrible pun
ishment for homeless children,
who tend to yearn for attention.
"They're big-time attention
seekers. They crave attention,"
says Simon.
"There's physical contact,"
Simon says."The kids want us
to carry them on our shoul
ders."
Affection isn't necessarily
the motivation behind the con
tact, however. "When they're
showing affection, it's because
they're craving attention and
we're giving it,"says Simon.
The attention-play can
wreak havoc on a naive volun
teer. "They like having us
there," Simon says. But "we
have to distance ourselves in
some way. When they're acting
out, it's not because of us.
"They have emotions and
we're the targets because we're
there."

Often, attention-seeking plays itself out
destructively. The name-calling is brutal.
Nigger" and "Baby Fatso" are among the
milder, says Simon.
Baby Fatso. Baby FATso." The big boys
repent the name until Emily, a plump little girl,
is in tears."
"Hmily doesn't have a very hard shell,"
Barclay says. "She's only 6 years old."
On Family's birthday, the class made her
birthday cards in an art session. Christina
cried when she received them — but for a
different reason. "My mother always cries

when she's happy," she says.
Recognition of milestones is important
for homeless children, who "lead very tenu
ous lives," Simon says. "They don't know
where they're going to be next."
The center doesn't keep tabs on resi
dents, to maintain confidentiality. This poses
problems for researchers trying to keep track
of homeless families.
A proposal from Sandy Dornbusch, the
leader of the University's "Homeless Study,"
would keep track of families using a combi
nation of mothers' and children's birthdates.
While the numbers help researchers compile
demographics on the homeless, volunteers
working with the families lose track once
time runs out at the shelter.
At the Family Living Center, that dead
line is one month — although it can be
extended as long as rules are obeyed. Those
rules forbid the use of alcohol. Rooms must
be kept clean, and they must be occupied
each night.
When children leave the center, Barclay
and Simon never know

what's going to happen.
"What's troubling is
that we don't get to recog
nize [the kids who leave].
It's hard to talk about the
fact that they're gone.
"I want them to know
that when they go, some
one's going to care,"
Barclay says.
Instability is a major
force a homeless child
faces. The effects range
from bad to dreadful.
School is one of the first
things to be disrupted.
Only one child in the sum
mer school program can
divide. Many children
don't learn English. Karen
was dyslexic, but her prob
lem wasn't diagnosed by
regular teachers —
because Karen wasn't in
one school long enough
for the problem to become
apparent.
It wasn't until Barclay
noticed Karen couldn't
write her name after four
months of trying that the
problem was recognized.
Now, though, Karen has
left the shelter. She may
not get the attention she
needs.
Instability can cause
emotional problems, as
well.
Tommy, an overweight
child with a crew-cut, sits in
the corner, scowling. His
arms are crossed.
"Tommy is having a bad
day," Kate says.
Earlier, Tommy said he
wished he had never been
bom. He may be suicidal.
He is only 10 years old.
Barclay is worried
about Tommy. He is bright
— so far he is the only stu
dent at the shelter who has

completed a math book, which he requested
on his own. But he is moody.
On the playground after lunch, he played
an inner-city style of pat-a-cake with
Jellinghaus. The slapping grew faster and
faster, and he never missed a beat. He
seemed to be enjoying himself. But sudden
ly, he stopped, turned and walked away in
silence.
Math may be a key to Tommy's self
esteem, Barclay says. But, she adds, "We are
only with him six hours a day. We have no
control over what happens during the other
18."
The homeless kids don't often turn to
each other for support. The instability makes
peer bonding difficult. "Everyone is yanked
away," Barclay says. "They get reluctant to
form friendships Ongoing relationship
skills are not really that developed."
Tommy is not the only child on the edge
of survival. Sarah, a roly-poly girl of 12, has
been raped. She has not received counseling.
"Children's needs are often neglected in a

situation where parents are struggling to
obtain the most basic necessities," Barclay
says.
One 5-year-old, Barclay says, used to have
screaming tantrums for no apparent reason.
No one knew what was wrong. His mother
happened to mention in a conversation with
Barclay that he had been molested the pre
vious year. He hasn't received any counsel
ing.
"I don't mean to blame parents" for the
problems that affect their children, Barclay
says. "They just don't have enough

resources.

And homelessness isn't easy to under
stand or cure. There is a basic shortage of
low-income housing, she says, but "it's con
troversial why some people become home
less and some don't," she says. "Some people
become homeless because of a one-time
event, but often it's bad luck over a period of
time."
Depression and substance abuse are
often linked with homelessness, but "it's
hard to separate what is a cause and what is
caused by homelessness," she says.
"They love their children — that's why their
children are reaching out for love," she says.
The children have internalized many bad
experiences, says Simon. "The kids are
incredibly perceptive. Even if they can't
speak English or read or write," he says.
"We're hoping to turn the tables so they
internalize the good things."
Despite the obstacles, Barclay, Simon
and the volunteers remain modest in their
goals.
"We're trying very much to be realistic
about what we're doing. All we're doing is
giving them a few weeks of something to do,
and people who care about them," says
Simon.
Both get satisfaction from the struggle.
"A lot of people are helping us," Barclay
says. "Our volunteers are amazing."
"Giving love is uncomplicated," she adds.
"The sum of love in these kids lives is greater
than before we came.
"We hope it's more than they would have
had — it's uncomplicated good."

ence. Simon teachers "readers' theater" —
fables in play form where each child reads a
part.
Afternoons begin with 15 minutes of
supervised play, "so they don't degenerate

into violence," Simon jokes. An activity, such
as running a mock radio station, follows for
the children able to function in a group, as
well as individualized tutoring and math
exercises using playing cards.
Rather than focusing on classroom edu
cation, Simon and Barclay's main task has
been instilling social skills as well as provid
ing stability and fun. "A lot of education
must take place before academic learning
can happen," Barclay says, "turn-taking,
learning what behavior is healthy, what is
hurtful."

"You 're making the castle wrong," Sally
cries. "Use the wet sand." Her tears streak the
dirt on her face. A smaller girl, Sulma, throws
sand on Sally. Sulma and another child, Mary,
demolish the castle and laugh.
When children at the shelter are faced
with disappointment or frustration, they
often react in extremes. "The kids respond
to hurt disproportionately," Barclay says.
"When they don't get to go first, they throw
themselves on the floor and cry."
Barclay and Simon, as well as Jellinghaus,
who has volunteered almost every day since

the program began, have had to learn to
handle these and other outbursts. They all
acknowledge that Simon often has to take
the role of disciplinarian.
There is a list of rules written in colored
maimers on the wall. "It hurt to put that up,"
Barclay says, wincing.
No hitting is allowed. Neither are "motor
vehicles" — bikes, trikes and other personal
toys the kids try to sneak onto the play
ground. Respect — for teachers and class
mates — is also an order.
The volunteers try to "model positive
behavior," Barclay says. When someone
crosses the boundaries, he or she is admon
ished. Usually, the negative behavior stops,

if only for a while.

"Retards!" the shelter kids shout. They are
making fun of the mentally retarded people
who live in the next building over. When
Elizabeth hears the jeers, she exj)lains to the
children that "retarded people can't help it —
they were born that way."
She doesn't know whether her words have
had any effect. But the next day, Mike over
hears one girl repeat Elizabeth's defense —
word for word — to another child.
"Words can come back to you," Barclay
says. "I have a little hope — a
very little — that it does do
something."

The worst punishment
Barclay and Simon will inflict
on a child is a day spent in the
office, doing nothing.
Solitude is a terrible pun
ishment for homeless children,
who tend to yearn for attention.
"They're big-time attention
seekers. They crave attention,"
says Simon.
"There's physical contact,"
Simon says."The kids want us
to carry them on our shoul
ders."
Affection isn't necessarily
the motivation behind the con
tact, however. "When they're
showing affection, it's because
they're craving attention and
we're giving it,"says Simon.
The attention-play can
wreak havoc on a naive volun
teer. "They like having us
there," Simon says. But "we
have to distance ourselves in
some way. When they're acting
out, it's not because of us.
"They have emotions and
we're the targets because we're
there."

Often, attention-seeking plays itself out
destructively. The name-calling is brutal.
Nigger" and "Baby Fatso" are among the
milder, says Simon.
Baby Fatso. Baby FATso." The big boys
repent the name until Emily, a plump little girl,
is in tears."
"Hmily doesn't have a very hard shell,"
Barclay says. "She's only 6 years old."
On Family's birthday, the class made her
birthday cards in an art session. Christina
cried when she received them — but for a
different reason. "My mother always cries

when she's happy," she says.
Recognition of milestones is important
for homeless children, who "lead very tenu
ous lives," Simon says. "They don't know
where they're going to be next."
The center doesn't keep tabs on resi
dents, to maintain confidentiality. This poses
problems for researchers trying to keep track
of homeless families.
A proposal from Sandy Dornbusch, the
leader of the University's "Homeless Study,"
would keep track of families using a combi
nation of mothers' and children's birthdates.
While the numbers help researchers compile
demographics on the homeless, volunteers
working with the families lose track once
time runs out at the shelter.
At the Family Living Center, that dead
line is one month — although it can be
extended as long as rules are obeyed. Those
rules forbid the use of alcohol. Rooms must
be kept clean, and they must be occupied
each night.
When children leave the center, Barclay
and Simon never know

what's going to happen.
"What's troubling is
that we don't get to recog
nize [the kids who leave].
It's hard to talk about the
fact that they're gone.
"I want them to know
that when they go, some
one's going to care,"
Barclay says.
Instability is a major
force a homeless child
faces. The effects range
from bad to dreadful.
School is one of the first
things to be disrupted.
Only one child in the sum
mer school program can
divide. Many children
don't learn English. Karen
was dyslexic, but her prob
lem wasn't diagnosed by
regular teachers —
because Karen wasn't in
one school long enough
for the problem to become
apparent.
It wasn't until Barclay
noticed Karen couldn't
write her name after four
months of trying that the
problem was recognized.
Now, though, Karen has
left the shelter. She may
not get the attention she
needs.
Instability can cause
emotional problems, as
well.
Tommy, an overweight
child with a crew-cut, sits in
the corner, scowling. His
arms are crossed.
"Tommy is having a bad
day," Kate says.
Earlier, Tommy said he
wished he had never been
bom. He may be suicidal.
He is only 10 years old.
Barclay is worried
about Tommy. He is bright
— so far he is the only stu
dent at the shelter who has

completed a math book, which he requested
on his own. But he is moody.
On the playground after lunch, he played
an inner-city style of pat-a-cake with
Jellinghaus. The slapping grew faster and
faster, and he never missed a beat. He
seemed to be enjoying himself. But sudden
ly, he stopped, turned and walked away in
silence.
Math may be a key to Tommy's self
esteem, Barclay says. But, she adds, "We are
only with him six hours a day. We have no
control over what happens during the other
18."
The homeless kids don't often turn to
each other for support. The instability makes
peer bonding difficult. "Everyone is yanked
away," Barclay says. "They get reluctant to
form friendships Ongoing relationship
skills are not really that developed."
Tommy is not the only child on the edge
of survival. Sarah, a roly-poly girl of 12, has
been raped. She has not received counseling.
"Children's needs are often neglected in a

situation where parents are struggling to
obtain the most basic necessities," Barclay
says.
One 5-year-old, Barclay says, used to have
screaming tantrums for no apparent reason.
No one knew what was wrong. His mother
happened to mention in a conversation with
Barclay that he had been molested the pre
vious year. He hasn't received any counsel
ing.
"I don't mean to blame parents" for the
problems that affect their children, Barclay
says. "They just don't have enough

resources.

And homelessness isn't easy to under
stand or cure. There is a basic shortage of
low-income housing, she says, but "it's con
troversial why some people become home
less and some don't," she says. "Some people
become homeless because of a one-time
event, but often it's bad luck over a period of
time."
Depression and substance abuse are
often linked with homelessness, but "it's
hard to separate what is a cause and what is
caused by homelessness," she says.
"They love their children — that's why their
children are reaching out for love," she says.
The children have internalized many bad
experiences, says Simon. "The kids are
incredibly perceptive. Even if they can't
speak English or read or write," he says.
"We're hoping to turn the tables so they
internalize the good things."
Despite the obstacles, Barclay, Simon
and the volunteers remain modest in their
goals.
"We're trying very much to be realistic
about what we're doing. All we're doing is
giving them a few weeks of something to do,
and people who care about them," says
Simon.
Both get satisfaction from the struggle.
"A lot of people are helping us," Barclay
says. "Our volunteers are amazing."
"Giving love is uncomplicated," she adds.
"The sum of love in these kids lives is greater
than before we came.
"We hope it's more than they would have
had — it's uncomplicated good."

Santa Clara shelter:
The kids needed

with school princi

reading books, was to
develop a structured

Sally is one of about 60 homeless kids
temporarily housed at the Family Living
Center, a homeless shelter for families in
Santa Clara. Her mother is staying with her
at the center. Her father is somewhere else,
although Sally believes he lives there, too.
The sand castles Sally sculpts on the cen
ter's playground are the closest thing she has
to a home of her own.
As a growing number of families like
Sally's are unable to afford housing, home
lessness has become an important issue for
policy-makers — and for scholars at
Stanford.
The University's Center for the Study of
Families, Children and Youth is in the midst
of "The Homeless Study," a two-year inves
tigation of the problem. Several Stanford
professors offer courses on homelessness.
One such class, taught by History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, requires students to complete an
internship at a shelter.
For Elizabeth Barclay and Mike Simon,
who took Camarillo's class, an internship
wasn't enough. Supported by a grant from
the Haas Public Service Center, the two have
founded a summer school at the Family
Living Center for kids like Sally.
The Haas center distributed 14 other
public service grants, each totaling $1,500.
Other recipients will be doing such things as
offering education about AIDS in the Soviet
Union and producing an educational video
for Latin American refugee women who
have been victims of domestic violence.
Both Barclay and Simon have had past
experience working with the homeless.
Simon, a senior majoring in American stud
ies, is the coordinator of the Stanford
Homeless Action Coalition. He spent spring
vacation working in Los Angeles-area home

less shelters.
Barclay, who recently graduated in
human biology, interviewed subjects for the
Homeless Study. She calls what she learned
from her volunteer experience "mindful
public service." A goal, she says, is to consid
er the complexity of the issues surrounding
homelessness.
"Good intentions without thought are a
scary thing," she says. "You have to know
what your role is and what it shouldn't be."
But Barclay doesn't claim to have all the
answers. "We don't have special knowledge.

Baby Fatso. Baby FATso." The big boys
repent the name until Emily, a plump little girl,
is in tears."
"Hmily doesn't have a very hard shell,"
Barclay says. "She's only 6 years old."
On Family's birthday, the class made her
birthday cards in an art session. Christina
cried when she received them — but for a
different reason. "My mother always cries

when she's happy," she says.
Recognition of milestones is important
for homeless children, who "lead very tenu
ous lives," Simon says. "They don't know
where they're going to be next."
The center doesn't keep tabs on resi
dents, to maintain confidentiality. This poses
problems for researchers trying to keep track
of homeless families.
A proposal from Sandy Dornbusch, the
leader of the University's "Homeless Study,"
would keep track of families using a combi
nation of mothers' and children's birthdates.
While the numbers help researchers compile
demographics on the homeless, volunteers
working with the families lose track once
time runs out at the shelter.
At the Family Living Center, that dead
line is one month — although it can be
extended as long as rules are obeyed. Those
rules forbid the use of alcohol. Rooms must
be kept clean, and they must be occupied
each night.
When children leave the center, Barclay
and Simon never know

what's going to happen.
"What's troubling is
that we don't get to recog
nize [the kids who leave].
It's hard to talk about the
fact that they're gone.
"I want them to know
that when they go, some
one's going to care,"
Barclay says.
Instability is a major
force a homeless child
faces. The effects range
from bad to dreadful.
School is one of the first
things to be disrupted.
Only one child in the sum
mer school program can
divide. Many children
don't learn English. Karen
was dyslexic, but her prob
lem wasn't diagnosed by
regular teachers —
because Karen wasn't in
one school long enough
for the problem to become
apparent.
It wasn't until Barclay
noticed Karen couldn't
write her name after four
months of trying that the
problem was recognized.
Now, though, Karen has
left the shelter. She may
not get the attention she
needs.
Instability can cause
emotional problems, as
well.
Tommy, an overweight
child with a crew-cut, sits in
the corner, scowling. His
arms are crossed.
"Tommy is having a bad
day," Kate says.
Earlier, Tommy said he
wished he had never been
bom. He may be suicidal.
He is only 10 years old.
Barclay is worried
about Tommy. He is bright
— so far he is the only stu
dent at the shelter who has

completed a math book, which he requested
on his own. But he is moody.
On the playground after lunch, he played
an inner-city style of pat-a-cake with
Jellinghaus. The slapping grew faster and
faster, and he never missed a beat. He
seemed to be enjoying himself. But sudden
ly, he stopped, turned and walked away in
silence.
Math may be a key to Tommy's self
esteem, Barclay says. But, she adds, "We are
only with him six hours a day. We have no
control over what happens during the other
18."
The homeless kids don't often turn to
each other for support. The instability makes
peer bonding difficult. "Everyone is yanked
away," Barclay says. "They get reluctant to
form friendships Ongoing relationship
skills are not really that developed."
Tommy is not the only child on the edge
of survival. Sarah, a roly-poly girl of 12, has
been raped. She has not received counseling.
"Children's needs are often neglected in a

situation where parents are struggling to
obtain the most basic necessities," Barclay
says.
One 5-year-old, Barclay says, used to have
screaming tantrums for no apparent reason.
No one knew what was wrong. His mother
happened to mention in a conversation with
Barclay that he had been molested the pre
vious year. He hasn't received any counsel
ing.
"I don't mean to blame parents" for the
problems that affect their children, Barclay
says. "They just don't have enough

resources.

And homelessness isn't easy to under
stand or cure. There is a basic shortage of
low-income housing, she says, but "it's con
troversial why some people become home
less and some don't," she says. "Some people
become homeless because of a one-time
event, but often it's bad luck over a period of
time."
Depression and substance abuse are
often linked with homelessness, but "it's
hard to separate what is a cause and what is
caused by homelessness," she says.
"They love their children — that's why their
children are reaching out for love," she says.
The children have internalized many bad
experiences, says Simon. "The kids are
incredibly perceptive. Even if they can't
speak English or read or write," he says.
"We're hoping to turn the tables so they
internalize the good things."
Despite the obstacles, Barclay, Simon
and the volunteers remain modest in their
goals.
"We're trying very much to be realistic
about what we're doing. All we're doing is
giving them a few weeks of something to do,
and people who care about them," says
Simon.
Both get satisfaction from the struggle.
"A lot of people are helping us," Barclay
says. "Our volunteers are amazing."
"Giving love is uncomplicated," she adds.
"The sum of love in these kids lives is greater
than before we came.
"We hope it's more than they would have
had — it's uncomplicated good."

Santa Clara shelter:
The kids needed
something to do dur
ing the summer to
give their lives some
structure.
Their original

with school princi

professors, as well as
reading books, was to
develop a structured
curriculum that
"would be so fun the
kids wanted to do it,"
Simon says.

however, that plan

Sally is one of about 60 homeless kids
temporarily housed at the Family Living
Center, a homeless shelter for families in
Santa Clara. Her mother is staying with her
at the center. Her father is somewhere else,
although Sally believes he lives there, too.
The sand castles Sally sculpts on the cen
ter's playground are the closest thing she has
to a home of her own.
As a growing number of families like
Sally's are unable to afford housing, home
lessness has become an important issue for
policy-makers — and for scholars at
Stanford.
The University's Center for the Study of
Families, Children and Youth is in the midst
of "The Homeless Study," a two-year inves
tigation of the problem. Several Stanford
professors offer courses on homelessness.
One such class, taught by History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, requires students to complete an
internship at a shelter.
For Elizabeth Barclay and Mike Simon,
who took Camarillo's class, an internship
wasn't enough. Supported by a grant from
the Haas Public Service Center, the two have
founded a summer school at the Family
Living Center for kids like Sally.
The Haas center distributed 14 other
public service grants, each totaling $1,500.
Other recipients will be doing such things as
offering education about AIDS in the Soviet
Union and producing an educational video
for Latin American refugee women who
have been victims of domestic violence.
Both Barclay and Simon have had past
experience working with the homeless.
Simon, a senior majoring in American stud
ies, is the coordinator of the Stanford
Homeless Action Coalition. He spent spring
vacation working in Los Angeles-area home

less shelters.
Barclay, who recently graduated in
human biology, interviewed subjects for the
Homeless Study. She calls what she learned
from her volunteer experience "mindful
public service." A goal, she says, is to consid
er the complexity of the issues surrounding
homelessness.
"Good intentions without thought are a
scary thing," she says. "You have to know
what your role is and what it shouldn't be."
But Barclay doesn't claim to have all the
answers. "We don't have special knowledge.

well as numerous other volunteers, have
been playing it by ear. "Our strength is our
flexibility," Barclay says.
The day is broken into two segments
punctuated by a raisin break and lunchtime.
Mornings, the children, who range in age
from 5 to 12, rotate through three stations.
Jellinghaus teaches art. Barclay teaches sci
ence. Simon teachers "readers' theater" —
fables in play form where each child reads a
part.
Afternoons begin with 15 minutes of
supervised play, "so they don't degenerate

into violence," Simon jokes. An activity, such
as running a mock radio station, follows for
the children able to function in a group, as
well as individualized tutoring and math
exercises using playing cards.
Rather than focusing on classroom edu
cation, Simon and Barclay's main task has
been instilling social skills as well as provid
ing stability and fun. "A lot of education
must take place before academic learning
can happen," Barclay says, "turn-taking,
learning what behavior is healthy, what is
hurtful."

"You 're making the castle wrong," Sally
cries. "Use the wet sand." Her tears streak the
dirt on her face. A smaller girl, Sulma, throws
sand on Sally. Sulma and another child, Mary,
demolish the castle and laugh.
When children at the shelter are faced
with disappointment or frustration, they
often react in extremes. "The kids respond
to hurt disproportionately," Barclay says.
"When they don't get to go first, they throw
themselves on the floor and cry."
Barclay and Simon, as well as Jellinghaus,
who has volunteered almost every day since

the program began, have had to learn to
handle these and other outbursts. They all
acknowledge that Simon often has to take
the role of disciplinarian.
There is a list of rules written in colored
maimers on the wall. "It hurt to put that up,"
Barclay says, wincing.
No hitting is allowed. Neither are "motor
vehicles" — bikes, trikes and other personal
toys the kids try to sneak onto the play
ground. Respect — for teachers and class
mates — is also an order.
The volunteers try to "model positive
behavior," Barclay says. When someone
crosses the boundaries, he or she is admon
ished. Usually, the negative behavior stops,

if only for a while.

"Retards!" the shelter kids shout. They are
making fun of the mentally retarded people
who live in the next building over. When
Elizabeth hears the jeers, she exj)lains to the
children that "retarded people can't help it —
they were born that way."
She doesn't know whether her words have
had any effect. But the next day, Mike over
hears one girl repeat Elizabeth's defense —
word for word — to another child.
"Words can come back to you," Barclay
says. "I have a little hope — a
very little — that it does do
something."

The worst punishment
Barclay and Simon will inflict
on a child is a day spent in the
office, doing nothing.
Solitude is a terrible pun
ishment for homeless children,
who tend to yearn for attention.
"They're big-time attention
seekers. They crave attention,"
says Simon.
"There's physical contact,"
Simon says."The kids want us
to carry them on our shoul
ders."
Affection isn't necessarily
the motivation behind the con
tact, however. "When they're
showing affection, it's because
they're craving attention and
we're giving it,"says Simon.
The attention-play can
wreak havoc on a naive volun
teer. "They like having us
there," Simon says. But "we
have to distance ourselves in
some way. When they're acting
out, it's not because of us.
"They have emotions and
we're the targets because we're
there."

Often, attention-seeking plays itself out
destructively. The name-calling is brutal.

of survival. Sarah, a roly-poly girl of 12, has
been raped. She has not received counseling.
"Children's needs are often neglected in a

situation where parents are struggling to
obtain the most basic necessities," Barclay
says.
One 5-year-old, Barclay says, used to have
screaming tantrums for no apparent reason.
No one knew what was wrong. His mother
happened to mention in a conversation with
Barclay that he had been molested the pre
vious year. He hasn't received any counsel
ing.
"I don't mean to blame parents" for the
problems that affect their children, Barclay
says. "They just don't have enough

resources.

And homelessness isn't easy to under
stand or cure. There is a basic shortage of
low-income housing, she says, but "it's con
troversial why some people become home
less and some don't," she says. "Some people
become homeless because of a one-time
event, but often it's bad luck over a period of
time."
Depression and substance abuse are
often linked with homelessness, but "it's
hard to separate what is a cause and what is
caused by homelessness," she says.
"They love their children — that's why their
children are reaching out for love," she says.
The children have internalized many bad
experiences, says Simon. "The kids are
incredibly perceptive. Even if they can't
speak English or read or write," he says.
"We're hoping to turn the tables so they
internalize the good things."
Despite the obstacles, Barclay, Simon
and the volunteers remain modest in their
goals.
"We're trying very much to be realistic
about what we're doing. All we're doing is
giving them a few weeks of something to do,
and people who care about them," says
Simon.
Both get satisfaction from the struggle.
"A lot of people are helping us," Barclay
says. "Our volunteers are amazing."
"Giving love is uncomplicated," she adds.
"The sum of love in these kids lives is greater
than before we came.
"We hope it's more than they would have
had — it's uncomplicated good."
