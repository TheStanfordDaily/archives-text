# Under Silicon Valley's shadow
## 
### 
Neither New Yorkers nor Alan Dershowitz
holds the monopoly on chutzpah.
According to Melissa Beacham at Stanford's
Center for the Study of Families, Children and
Youth, two local grassroots coalitions are brim
ming with it — so much so that they demanded
the center undertake a study of homeless in the
area.
Amazingly enough, she said, center Director
Sandy Dornbusch listened — and"The

Homeless Study" was born.
That was two years ago. Since
then, Dornbusch and a slew of
professors from a variety of
departments have donated their
time to what Beacham, the pro
ject director, calls the "first in
depth look at homeless families
and children in suburban areas."
"No one has looked at home
less people in Silicon Valley,"
she said. "This population is in
the shadow of one of the most
affluent communities in the
country."
After a year of fund raising,
the professors and 36 volunteer
students — including Elizabeth
Barclay, a founder of the sum
mer school program — have
peered into that shadow by

interviewing hundreds of parents and children
from families caught in the "cycle of homeless
ness."
The cycle the study has emphasized in its
information-gathering stage, Beacham said, can
be broken down into three stages: at risk, for
merly homeless and homeless. More than demo
graphics, the researchers are looking at what
happened to make people homeless.
And they're looking at how it affects the vic
tims.
Even in their raw form, Beacham said, the
responses, particularly from the children, are
moving.
Homeless 5-year-olds know more than their

share of life's struggles. One said he most want
ed a job, clothes, shoes and a house. A 6-year
old wished that his family were together, that he
could go to school and that he could play
Nintendo.
A 7-year-old worried that his mother would
be set on fire. When he drew "what home meant
to him," he showed a giant claw reared before a
house.
The researchers' observations are equally pow
erful. Beacham described a toddler who wasn't

toilet-trained and couldn't yet
walk. The family had moved so
much that it never had time to
teach the child either. It was eas
ier to pick her up and carry her
than wait, Beacham said.
Another kindergartner had to
transfer three times on a public
bus just to get to school, she
said.
In addition to children and par
ents, service providers and
school personnel were inter
viewed to generate a broad
vision of the problem.
They are now compiling that
information for an analysis
scheduled to be published and
publicized this fall.
Publicity, Beacham said, is cru-

cial. "I want this on the national news, on Oprah
Winfrey," she said.
While she acknowledged that Stanford is a
research university and not an advocacy organiza
tion, she said, "People have a responsibility ... to
get information out to advocates" for the home
less.
She said she hopes to work with both
researchers and advocates for the homeless as a
"translator."
"These are two different cultures," she said of
the researchers and advocates. "They need
someone with the time and energy" to make the
findings understandable and useful, while main
taining their integrity.
