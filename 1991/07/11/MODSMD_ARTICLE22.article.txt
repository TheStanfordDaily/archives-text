## Swimmers shine in Santa Clara 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Last weekend's Santa Clara
swim meet may have marked the
return to prominence of the Sovi
ets, but that doesn't in any way
mean it also demonstrated the
decline of Stanford University.
Cardinal swimmers of the past
and present captured eight events
over the course of the three-day
meet and scored countless other
high finishes.
Jeff Rouse opened with a win
in the 100-meter backstroke Fri
day with a time of 56.59 seconds.
For Rouse, it marked yet another
successful performance with an
injured wrist that still isn't com
pletely healed. "If anything, the
injury gave me another type of
goal — the extra motivation to
overcome this," he said.
Teammate Derek Weatherford
took fifth in the same event, in
58.27.
Summer Sanders was also a
winner on day one, swimming the
400 individual medley in 4:51.14.
The legendary Jenna Johnson
won the 100 freestyle in 58.10.
Right behind was Janel Jorgensen
at 58.24.
The Stanford 800 freestyle
relay team of Jorgensen, Johnson,
Barb Metz and Angie Wester-
Krieg was also a winner , with a
time of 8:23.55.
On Saturday, Jorgensen set a
meet record in the 100 butterfly,
clocking a 1:02.38. Sanders fin
ished second; Wester-Krieg third;
Suzy Buckovich fourth; Johnson
seventh; and Pam Minthorn
eighth.
The 400 freestyle relay
matched the success of the 800
with a win in 3:53.64. The partici
pants were the same as in the
longer relay, with Buckovich
replacing Metz.
Johnson was again a winner
Sunday, in the 50 freestyle. Her
26.77 nosed out Wester-Krieg by
.17 seconds.
In another relay, this time the
400 medley, Stanford was again
victorious. Jorgensen, Lori
Heisick, Wester-Krieg and John
son came in at 4:18.82 for the vic
tory.
Sanders was edged out in the
200 intramural Sunday by the rel
atively unheralded Nancy Sweet
man of Canada. Sanders, who said

she's been bothered by shoulder
tendinitis for a couple of months,
wasn't too upset she didn't defend
the title she won a year ago.
"Would I rather win here or at

the end of the season?" she said.
"I have to look at it that way."
Jorgensen took fourth in the
200 IM and Jill Johnson finished
sixth.

Jeff Rouse, who is still recovering from a wrist injury, was neverthe
less good enough to win the 100-meter backstroke in Santa Clara on
Friday.
