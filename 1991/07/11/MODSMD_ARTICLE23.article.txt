## NCAA's bad news 
### 
An NCAA study released last
Wednesday found that black stu
dent-athletes are only half as
likely to gradaute from college
within five years as whites.
In a survey of 3,288 students
who entered school in 1984 and
1985, only 26.6 percent of blacks
earned degrees from the schools
they originally enrolled in, versus
52.4 percent of whites. For all stu
dents, the graduation rate was
45.7 percent.
Among the most surprising
findings of the survey was that
although blacks scored lower on
standardized tests and had lower
grade-point averages, they were
more likely to graduate than
whites who scored similarly.
The results of the survey seem
to indicate the largest problem
facing blacks is inadequate educa
tional preparation. It will likely
intensify debate over the NCAA's
Proposition 48, which requires a
minimum score on the SAT or
ACT and a 2.0 GPA for participa
tion as a freshman. The NCAA
Presidents Commission recently
proposed strengthening the
requirement to a 2.5 GPA while
keeping the same minimum of 700
on the SAT
