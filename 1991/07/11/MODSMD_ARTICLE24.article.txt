Though he was the least her
alded of the young Americans
entering the tournament, David
Wheaton outlasted his country
men at Wimbledon by reaching
the semifinals.
Wheaton followed up on his
upset of third-seeded Ivan Lendl,
with a defeat of No. 5 seed Andre
Agassi in the quarterfinals.
Agassi's first grass-court action in
four years was impressive, but
Wheaton was slightly better.
He subdued Agassi 6-2, 0-6, 3-
6, 7-6, 6-2. In the fourth set
tiebreaker, Wheaton was two
points from losing the match.
But his remarkable run of vic
tories came to a halWwhen three
time champion Boris Becker
stopped him in the semifinals.
Becker came through in one of
the closer three-setters one is
likely to see, 6-4, 7-6, 7-5.
"I felt like I outplayed Boris,"

Wheaton said. "I had all the
chances, all the break points, but I
didn't convert them."
Indeed, Wheaton failed on all
10 of his break chances. Becker,
on the other hand, broke
Wheaton twice in the match —
converting two of the four break
points he held.
