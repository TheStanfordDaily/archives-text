Janet Evans, whose somewhat
mysterious decision to leave Stan
ford in early April generated
some controversy in the commu
nity, spoke out at a recent meet in
Charlotte, N.C.
Asked whether she'll ever be as
good as she was back in 1988,
Evans replied, "I feel old." But
she's still only 19, if you can
believe it, and training hard to be
the best she can be.
"I don't want to try to recap
ture what I did in 1988," Evans
told the Charlotte Observer. "I
just want to do the best I can, and
I want to put the past behind me.
I can't put it behind me if I'm try
ing to relive it."
Evans also let on that her rea
sons for leaving Stanford were a
little more complex than she first
stated. While the NCAA limits on
practice time no doubt con
tributed, Evans said, "It was hard
to leave. Still, I definitely knew I
had to leave the swim program —
the training just didn't feel cor
rect. I was comfortable at Stan
ford. It was my home away from
home. But I just couldn't stay."
So far, her training with Texas
Aquatics in Austin is going well.
Evans said she wants to keep
swimming until she no longer
enjoys it. "There is life after swim
ming. I mean, it's just a sport."
