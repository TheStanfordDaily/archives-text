## Graduation study means it's time for some NCAA action 
### 
The news from the NCAA
that black athletes are only
half as likely as whites to
graduate from college is disturb
ing but, sadly, not at all shocking.
One of the most frightening
aspects of recently released
study is that black athletes appear
to be on an eligibility track. That
is, they are often completing just
enough work to be allowed to play
and then, when they have played
out their athletic eligibility, are
failing out of school.
No doubt the colleges will lay
the blame on inadequate elemen
tary and secondary education —
and much of it belongs right there.
But the era of big-time athletic
programs wringing their hands
and saying "It's not our fault,"
must come to a close once and for
all.
If these alleged student-ath
letes are going to be admitted to
college, it is up to the schools to
make sure they have a fair chance
to get their degrees.

As superstar performers bring
major dollars into the schools they
play for, it behooves the NCAA to
require that more of those dollars
go to academic support for ath
letes.
It's also high time the organiza
tion reconsiders Proposition 48.
The study seemed to lend cre
dence to the argument that an
index of test scores and high
school grade-point averages
should be used in determining
freshman eligibility. But the
NCAA Presidents Commission
seems bent on keeping the same
SAT cutoff of 700 while increasing
the GPA minimum to 2.5.
Since the NCAA's own study
discovered that blacks who
receive low test scores are more
likely to graduate from college
than whites who achieve similar
results, it seems odd the presi
dents would insist on maintaining
the same minimum score.
While the study failed to
resolve the question of cultural

bias on standarized tests, it
seemed to point out that little
harm would be done in allowing a
sliding scale to determine eligibil
ity under Prop 48.
Part of me feels — strongly —
that anyone who doesn't score 700
shouldn't even be in college. But
another part knows that if that
same someone can combine a 2.7
GPA with a 650, they shouldn't be
forced to sit out as freshmen.

So The Championships are
over and the Germans reign
once again. But surely no
one could have expected relative
unknown Michael Stich would
wear the men's crown instead of
Boris Becker.
Well, certainly not Stefan
Edberg, who was defeated by
Stich in the semifinals even
though his serve wasn't broken
once. Edberg lost three straight
sets in tiebreakers, an innovation
of the recently passed away James

Van Alen.
On the women's side, the
sport's greatest rivalry since Chris
Evert and Martina Navratilova
was renewed once again, also pro
ducing an unexpected result.
Gabriela Sabatini's recent mas
tery over Steffi Graf — the Argen
tine had won five straight matches
entering the Wimbledon final —
came to an end. Graf may have
finally put her troubles behind her
and could be ready to challenge

Monica Seles, whose absence
from the tournament allowed her
to maintain the No. 1 ranking.
Sabatini, too, seems capable of
bidding for the sport's top spot.
The competition is great news for
the women's game, which has
never been played at a higher
level. If an American could join
the elite group (Are you listening
Mary Joe Fernandez and Jennifer
Capriati?), perhaps the women
could set a popularity Record.
The lack of a legitimate threat
to the top ranking is also the only
thing the American men lack. Jim
Courier, Andre Agassi, Pete Sam
pras and Michael Chang have
three Grand Slam titles among
them and have all been ranked in
the top 10.
Joining them in the elite is
Wimbledon semifinalist David
Wheaton, who is ironically the
elder statesman among the group.
