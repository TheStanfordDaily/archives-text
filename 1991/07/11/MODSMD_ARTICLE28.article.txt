Who would have thought the creator
of "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and
"Broadway Bound" would write a
play influenced by Anton Chekhov? The
atre Works opens its 22nd season with just
such a play, Neil Simon's "The Good Doc
tor," adapted and suggested from stories by
Chekhov.
This humorous, at times moving and
always entertaining play is comprised of a
series of vignettes, the first of which dis
cusses the life of a turn-of-the-ccntury Rus
sian writer.
Simon uses this writer, a vague version of
Chekhov himself, to bring out his own rea
sons for picking up the pen. Steve Patter
son, who plays the Writer, clearly expresses
the passion writing embodies for his charac
ter and therefore, for Simon.
Scholars may know that Chekhov's pri
mary profession was as a doctor, but the
excitement in Patterson's face when he first
approaches the audience and discusses
writing is enough to convince anyone that
Chekhov was first, last and always meant to
be an author.
Patterson is a charming and versatile
actor. He switches from the role ot the
Writer to other hilarious roles with great
case and effectiveness. In "Surgery, he
plays a medical student trying to convince a
priest with a toothache to let him perform
oral surgery. The scene quickly becomes a
funny slapstick routine, with Patterson

chasing the patient around the room bran
dishing a huge pair of pliers.
Miriam Babin also gives some scene
stealing performances. In"The Gov
erness," she teaches her governess a lesson
in self-esteem by tricking her.into accepting
measly wages. Babin's wit shines through
her deceptively simple, repetitive lines.
Where Babin excels most, though, is in
"A Defenseless Creature." Babin plays the
title role as she tries to convince a banker to
give her sick husband money. Although her
husband's boss really owes the money, she
manages to persuade the banker to pay her,
and her cries to the banker, though laden
with humor, are cries from the heart. She
goes from desperation to craziness and
from fainting to fighting, but delivers each
action with force.
Set designer Bruce McLcod creates the
boundaries of indoors and outdoors with a
simple yet beautiful log frame that encloses
the stage. Deep green trees occasionally
decorate the set and when accented by soft
lighting, they lend the stage the feeling of
being spied upon — as if the stage was in
another world that the audience could only
watch but not be a part of.
Though hilarious on the surface, "The
Good Doctor" frequently has tragic under
tones. At times Simon seems to be treating
the action a bit too lightly. One scene, "The
Drowned Man," starts off extremely amus
ingly, as a sailor stops the Writer on a dock

and offers to perform a drowning act for
him, for a small fee, of course. But the story
ends on a ironic note when the sailor
plunges into the ocean, never to see land
again. The scene leaves the audience laugh
ing, but the sadder side of the story still
remains.
A similar scene that leaves the audience
in stitches — but for very strange reasons —
is "The Sneeze." Cherdyakov, played by the
very talented Jack Davis, dampens the back
of his superior's head with a great sneeze at
an opera. His persistence at making
amends with his boss comically turns to
indignation when he believes the bureau
crat has been mocking him.
At the close of the scene, he goes home,
lies down on his sofa ... and dies. To
lighten the mood, the Writer proposes an
alternate ending in which Cherdyakov goes
home and inherits 5 million rubles. The
first ending is strangely abrupt, but the sec
ond, though comical, somehow makes the
scene too superficial.
Simon obviously had some difficulty
adapting the complex work of Chekhov into
his own irony-tinged brand of humor, but
"The Good Doctor" — nearly three hours
long — never loses the audience. The cast,
including Amy Resnick and George Ward,
have an impressive acting range and their
performances alone make the play worth
seeing. Fans of Chekhov and Simon alike
will find "The Good Doctor" a good choice.
