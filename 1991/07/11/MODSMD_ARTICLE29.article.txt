# Dobsons make jazz a family matter
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
There's hope for all you
deprived jazz lovers in Northern
California. And The Weekly will
provide you with the inside stories
on the hottest local jazz around
this summer: the Stanford Jazz
Workshop's Summer Jazz Con
cert Series.
This week's featured perform
ers are the Dobson Family Band,
playing tomorrow, and Saturday's
attraction, Jose Bowen and Eric
Rosenquist with the K.A. Wonton
Little Latin Big Band.
The Dobson Family Band,
composed of Smith Dobson on
piano, Smith Dobson V on drums,
and vocalists Gail and Sasha Dob
son, is dedicated to bringing qual
ity jazz to the ears of youths who
otherwise might never know that
there is more to music than
Madonna's attitude and M.C.
Hammer's dance moves.
As part of SPECTRA, an
artists-in-residence program in
the Pajaro Valley School District
in Santa Cruz, the group has given
several performances for
schoolchildren.
Band leader and father Smith
Dobson is dedicated to retaining
the integrity of jazz as an art form.
He believes that jazz education, in
addition to refined performance
technique, is an integral part of a
jazz player's musical background.
The player must understand the
history of the music and be famil
iar with the stylistic contributions
made by the great musicians of
the past.

It is not surprising that in their
school performances the Dobsons
not only entertain the children
with their music, they also edu
cate them about some of the
greats in jazz history, such as
Count Basie, Charlie Parker and
Duke Ellington. Their programs
also encourage the children to
explore music for themselves by
involving them in the perfor
mance with simple instruments.
The Dobsons' performances
provide the children with an
opportunity to hear and learn
about jazz, and demonstrate that
it is never too early to start mak
ing music, as young Smith V and
Sasha do very well.
At 14, Smith V has been drum
ming since he was 2. A gifted
player, he has performed with the
Cabrillo College Big Band and
combos and has worked with the
Stanford Jazz Workshop's 17-
year-old drum instructor Steve
Rossi. The two undoubtedly form
a dynamic young duo.
Sasha Dobson, 12, is a jazz
singer, as is her mother Gail.
Sasha is also quite an accom
plished dancer.
The Dobsons' concert tomor
row is sure to be full of quality

jazz playing and singing, as the
group prepares for its Sept. 22
performance at the highly
acclaimed Monterey Jazz Festival.
Jose Bowen, a Stanford alum
nus, and Eric Rosenquist create
an innovative blend of salsa and
big band jazz with the K.A. Won
ton Little Latin Big Band. The
ensemble has performed in Palo
Alto's Brown Bag Concert Series
and is working to gain recognition
in the greater Bay Area.

Band leader Smith Dob
son believes that jazz edu
cation, in addition to
refined performance tech
nique, is an integral part
of a jazz player's musical
background.

It's only a matter of time
before this outstanding group
starts getting the attention of the
locals, and then (if the general
trend in jazz holds) they'll be
headed south. Better catch them
while you've got the chance.

The Dobson Family Band performs
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Campbell
Recital Hall. Tickets are $10
general and $8 students. Jose
Bowen and Eric Rosenquist and the
K.A. Wonton Little Latin Big Band
perform Saturday at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets are
$8 general and $6 students. Call
386-8535 for more information.
