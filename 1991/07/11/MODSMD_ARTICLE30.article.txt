# Films from the Golden Age
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Editorial staff 
Departing from its normal
practice of devoting festivals to
particular actors, directors or gen
res of film, the Stanford Theatre is
presenting "Hooray for Holly
wood: Classic Favorites from the
Golden Age," which will highlight
37 films from the canon of Holly
wood's greatest over the next two
months.
This week, the festival presents
two classic swashbuckler films,
"The Adventures of Robin
Hood," with Errol Flynn, and
"The Mark of Zorro," starring
Tyrone Power. The Stanford The
atre claims that "Robin Hood ...
provides a perfect opportunity to
compare a masterpiece of the past
with the modern product."
Films shown at the Stanford
Theatre usually provide "a rare
chance to see a film as it was orig
inally released," said David
Packard, board member of the
Packard Foundation, which
restored the Stanford Theatre to
its original glory in 1989.
Until 1950, films were printed
on nitrate film, an unstable
medium that deteriorates fairly
rapidly. Since the Stanford The
atre is equipped with a fire-pro
tected booth for showing such
prints, they are one of the few the
aters able to rent the higher-qual
ity nitrate copies.
In addition, Packard said
Tbrner Entertainment, owner of
the classic libraries for MGM,
RKO and Warner Brothers, fre
quently releases studio prints —
the studio's personal, as opposed
to rental, copies of films — to the
Stanford Theatre.
"They treat us very well. We've
demonstrated that we take good
care of their prints."
Future films in the current fes
tival will include "The Maltese

Falcon," "An American in Paris,"
"The Postman Always Rings
Ttoice" and a rare Technicolor
print of "Giant," which Packard
describes as "absolutely gor
geous."
For the first time in the reno
vated theater's two-year history,
the Stanford Theatre will also
present science fiction films as
part of the current festival. Sci-fi
week begins next Thursday with
"Rocketship X-M" and "Invaders
from Mars."
Those two films, along with
"Destination Moon," will be
shown in their original Techni
color formats. The copy of
"Invaders From Mars" is possibly
"the best print in the world," said
Packard.
The Stanford Theatre, a gor
geous movie palace, is the perfect
setting for the classic films being
offered as part of the current fes
tival. The theater's "mighty Wurl
itzer organ" is played nightly
before and after the 7:30 show,
and on Fridays Nancy Gilliland
supplies live vocals.
The magic of the movies comes
alive as the organ and organist
sink into the orchestra pit and the
beautiful red curtain is drawn to
reveal the big screen. The theater
is decorated with Greek and
Assyrian ornamentation and
painted tapestries, while six chan
deliers light up the high ceilings
and spacious balcony.
Although the original hope was
that profits from the theater could
be used to help preserve and
restore films suffering from dete
rioration, Packard said running
the theater is "extremely expen
sive."
Even so, he continued, the
Stanford Theatre is "just about
the only theater showing classic
films that is breaking even."
In fact, the Stanford Theatre is
responsible for about one-third of

all classic film business in the
United States. During a recent
revival of "Citizen Kane" in 10
theaters across the country, the
Stanford Theatre was pleased to
discover it finished second in box
office revenue, behind the Castro
Theatre in San Francisco.
"We even beat Los Angeles and
New York," Packard said proudly,
noting that Palo Alto was the only
non-metropolitan venue of the 10.
The sumptuous building, low
ticket prices — $5 for a double
feature — and great line-ups of
films combine for a wonderful
movie experience. Occasionally,

the Stanford Theatre provides
even rarer treats, such as the visit
earlier this week of Irene Man
ning, one of the stars of "Yankee
Doodle Dandy," which closed yes
terday. The current festival of
some of the all-time greatest
movies is but one additional rea
son to check out this gem of a the
ater.

The Stanford Theatre is located at
221 University Ave., Palo Alto.
"Hooray for Hollywood: Classic
Favorites from the Golden Age"
runs through Sept. 10. Call 324-

that profits from the theater could
be used to help preserve and
restore films suffering from dete
rioration, Packard said running
the theater is "extremely expen
sive."
Even so, he continued, the
Stanford Theatre is "just about
the only theater showing classic
films that is breaking even."
In fact, the Stanford Theatre is
responsible for about one-third of

all classic film business in the
United States. During a recent
revival of "Citizen Kane" in 10
theaters across the country, the
Stanford Theatre was pleased to
discover it finished second in box
office revenue, behind the Castro
Theatre in San Francisco.
"We even beat Los Angeles and
New York," Packard said proudly,
noting that Palo Alto was the only
non-metropolitan venue of the 10.
The sumptuous building, low
ticket prices — $5 for a double
feature — and great line-ups of
films combine for a wonderful
movie experience. Occasionally,

the Stanford Theatre provides
even rarer treats, such as the visit
earlier this week of Irene Man
ning, one of the stars of "Yankee
Doodle Dandy," which closed yes
terday. The current festival of
some of the all-time greatest
movies is but one additional rea
son to check out this gem of a the
ater.

The Stanford Theatre is located at
221 University Ave., Palo Alto.
