What will be happening at
the Downtown Los Altos Arts
and Wine Festival this week
end? A better question would
be, what won't be happening?
This bigger-than-big festival
will take place Saturday and
Sunday on Main and State
streets in downtown Los Altos.
The event, Los Altos' 12th
annual festival, will feature 360
arts-and-crafts booths, sam
plings from seven Bay Area
wineries, several different
beers, 35 food vendors of
various types, and entertain
ment for both adults and chil
dren.
Radio station KKSF will
sponsor a stage for adults, pre
senting Clint Baker's New
Orleans Jazz Band, Steve
Erquiaga, the Full Faith and
Credit Big Band, the San Jose
Jazz Society and The Jazz
Workshop.
KKSF will also be making a
donation to the Los Altos
Rotary AIDS project. This pro
ject involves the distribution of
a 30-minute film on AIDS,
recently aired nationally on the
FOX network. This film, "The
Los Altos Story," is about
three Los Altos Rotarians with
AIDS. One of the three is a
past president of the Down
town Los Altos Village Associ
ation, the festival's sponsor.
Another stage, sponsored by
the San Jose Mercury News, is

geared especially for kids and
will feature fun acts such as the
Magic Pearl Puppet Show, Jay
the Juggler, a kazoo sing-along,
and Lisa Atkinson and Bethie,
both children's singers.
For all to enjoy will be
Patrick on the Steel Drums all
day Saturday and Sunday, and
country western dancing at 11
a.m. Sunday.
The event is sponsored by
the Downtown Los Altos Vil
lage Association, a non-profit
organization of private mer
chants and professionals that
both supports programs for the
Los Altos community and
works to beautify the down
town Los Altos area.
The association puts on
seasonal events for children
such as Easter egg hunts, Hal
loween parties and Christmas
meetings with Santa Claus. In
addition, the association
finances downtown Christmas
decorations and studies on
urban design in an effort to fur
ther beautify the downtown
area. In this way, the merchants
and professionals who profit
from being in the Los Altos
downtown area also serve the
area, for the benefit of all.
The festival is expected to
attract over 50,000 people and
raise approximately $50,000,
which will then be used by the
association as it continues its
activities benefiting the Los
Altos community and down
town area.
