No Jerry Garcia
concert Sunday

Citing "mounting health prob
lems," Jerry Garcia has postponed
his upcoming tour dates, including
his show scheduled for Sunday at
Frost Amphitheater.
"We certainly intend to keep
the show," said Doug Dorst, pub
lic relations manager for the Stan
ford Concert Network, which had
booked the performance in associ
ation with Bill Graham Presents.
According to Dorst, negotia
tions are underway to reschedule
the concert. Bill Graham Presents
has yet to announce any possible
new dates for the Stanford show,
but a canceled Garcia perfor
mance originally scheduled for
Saturday at French's Camp in
Humboldt County has already
been rescheduled for Aug. 10.
Garcia has a long history of
performing at Frost, both with
The Grateful Dead and the Jerry
Garcia Acoustic Band. The Dead
have been banned from perform
ing at Stanford since 1989, due to
problems caused by the fans —
known as "Deadheads" — who
follow the band from concert to
concert. The last time the Dead
performed at Stanford, 29 people
were arrested for drug- and alco
hol-related offenses outside the
concert.
Although The Grateful Dead is
not allowed to perform at Stan
ford, Garcia is considered a differ
ent act entirely and therefore is
not restricted from performing as
the Jerry Garcia Electric Band.
Ticket holders are advised to
hold on to their tickets, since they
will be good for the rescheduled
concert. Further questions should
be directed to the place of pur
chase.
