'Henry' is a treat
"Regarding Henry," starring Har
rison Ford, Annette Bening and Bill
Nunn
In Mike Nichols' new film,
"Regarding Henry," Harrison
Ford plays a slimy defense attor
ney who stumbles into a robbery
and gets a bullet fired partway
into his brain. "If you're going to
get shot in the head," says the
doctor consoling Henry's wife,
"that's the way to do it."
With "Presumed Innocent" still
lingering in many audiences'
minds, Ford remarkably creates a
character distinct from Rusty
Sabich or any of his other screen
roles. He elegantly pulls off the
comedy of the film without ever
losing sight of its serious and sen
timental tone.
Ford has said he "didn't want
Henry to be childlike," an ironic
claim considering childish inno
cence is what he captures so beau
tifully. Seeing him meander
naively through New York City
high-society life is sometimes rem
iniscent of Penny Marshall's

"Big," but this time there is no
magic. There are only real people
and real-life emotions.

Nichols ("The Graduate,"
"Working Girl") seems to have
the perfect recipe for serving up
this mixture of pathos and comedy
as we see Henry slowly recover his
memory as well as other mental
and motor skills. Henry searches
to rediscover the person he once
was, but ends up disliking who he
finds.

Henry's recovery is not
explored with as much detail as

many other films of this nature
("Awakenings," "Born on the
Fourth of July"), but 24-year-old
screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams
shows great skill in picking the
right moments along the way.
Particularly memorable are the
scenes with Henry's physical ther
apist, Bradley, played by Bill
Nunn. Those who have seen "Do
the Right Thing" may find it diffi
cult to view Nunn as anyone other

than Radio Raheem, but oncc
that is forgotten, it is impossible to
ignore what a wonderful perfor
mance Nunn gives. Regrettably,
his character drops out of the pic
ture far too early.
The film largely belongs to
Annette Bening, who skillfully
underacts the part of Henry's wife
Sarah and her struggle to bring
her brain-damaged husband back
into a family that never really
existed. Bening, Oscar-nominated
for her performance in"The
Grifters" last year, carries the
emotional weight of the picture
with ease and grace.
Even young Mikki Allen gives
an excellent performance, show
ing she can keep up with these
film big shots, playing the daugh
ter who knows more about being
Henry than Henry does.
Heck, even the dog is cute.
"Regarding Henry" is a treat to
watch. It is all the right people
making just the right film.

Charming ( Angel'
"An Angel At My Table," starring
Kerry Fox, Alexia Keogh and Karen
Fergusson
If you don't mind committing
yourself to three hours in a movie
theater, you should definitely see
"An Angel At My Table," an
impressive new film chronicling
the life of celebrated and
influential New Zealand author,
Janet Frame.
This trilogy — the film is
divided into three parts, each
based on one volume of Frame's
autobiography — traces her life
from pauper child to her eventual
destination as an inspiring writer
in her motherland. I expected to
make it through half of the second
segment before wanting to make
my way to the convenient side
exit.
Fortunately, I was mistaken.
"To The Is-Land," the first part
of the trilogy, offers insight into
Frame's shy, serious and with
drawn nature in her early years. It
also helps the viewer understand
why a career as an author is her
perceived destiny.
Growing up on the South
Island of rural New Zealand, the

young Frame develops her sensi
tivity and shyness through her
relationship with her family, par
ticularly her sister Isabel, who
drowns in the local pond before
Frame reaches her teen-age years.
It seems that every time Frame
grows close to someone, that per
son is removed from her life.
In the second segment, "An
Angel At My Table," director
Jane Campion details Frame's
eight emotionally charged years
spent misdiagnosed as a
schizophrenic.
Frame has an emotional break
down while teaching because she
realizes that her life should be
devoted to writing, which would
separate her from her family. She

is released from the mental ward
when her first published work
becomes a critically acclaimed
best seller. That, I suppose, brings
everyone to realize she is a normal
but emotionally inward person.
In"The Envoy From Mirror
City," Frame treks off to Europe
on a literary stipend to escape
from the reality of her dark expe
riences at home. There she settles
into her desired lifestyle as a
writer, until the news of her
father's death separates her from
this nourishing type of life.
After revisiting her home in
New Zealand to reminisce about
her father and her early child
hood, Frame accepts all that life
has dealt her and begins writing

once more. Her prolific literary
life since has been spent success
fully in her homeland, with the
award-winning "The Carpathi
ans" her most recent work.
When the movie ended, I
wanted to see more. Unlike some
of the other long, yet excellent
films that I've seen in the past
year — for example, "Dances
With Wolves" and "Cyrano de
Bergerac" — "An Angel" came
and went like California's rain
season. When "An Angel" ended,
I couldn't believe that the film had
ensnared my attention for nearly
three hours ... until I stood up to
leave and realized certain parts of
my body were asleep.

Mikki Allen, Annette Benlng and Harrison Ford are a not-so-happy family, made even unhappier when
Ford gets shot in the head in "Regarding Henry."
