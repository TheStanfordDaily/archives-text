Editor's picks:
Fun San Francisco sites
• The museums at the Fisherman's Wharf
— Far too expensive to actually pay for,
don't bother buying a ticket. Stand outside
and speculate on just how they measured
the fattest doorman in the world. Or watch
parents discipline their intolerable children
by forcing them to look at the gruesome
and oh-so-realistic decapitated head as it's
dipped into the cauldron outside the

Medieval Dungeon.
• San Francisco Zoo — No explanation
necessary. Just like all zoos, but better.
Don't miss the penguins — they've just
been given new homes — with porches.
Really.
New film releases:
Opened yesterday
• "Regarding Henry"
• "Bright Angel"
Opening Friday
• "Point Break"
• "Boyz N the Hood"
• "101 Dalmatians"
• "Horseplayer"
• "Opening Night"

This week's releases:

Caan
• "Not Without My Daughter," starring
Sally Field
• "Once Around," starring Richard Drey
fuss and Holly Hunter
•"Flight of Black Angel," starring Peter
Strauss
• Walt Disney's "Robin Hood"
New in music:

• Dan Reed Network — "The Heat"
• Meat Puppets — "Forbidden Puppets"

TV this week:
Believe it or not (to quote Stanford
alumnus Jack Palance), it's actually not a
completely hopeless week in television,
thanks to the "alternative" stations around
the Bay Area. While the Big Three net
works trot out tired old reruns and pilots of
shows even they wouldn't buy, FOX pre
sents a brand-spankin'-new episode of "The
Simpsons" tonight at 8 p.m.
If you've seen "Terminator 2: Judgment
Day," you probably spent a large portion of
the film asking, "How'd they do that?"
KBHK-TV 44 answers your questions Sat
urday at 11 p.m. (right after "Star Trek: The
Next Generation") with "The Making of
Terminator 2."
