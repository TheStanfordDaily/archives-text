"Terminator 2: Judgment Day" destroyed the
competition at the box office this past weekend
and it looks like the film will be a runaway success.
So your chances of checking out the original "Ter
minator" are probably pretty slim. Don't count on
getting this week's hot release, "Misery," either.
But in keeping with the spirit of Arnold
Schwarzenegger's time-hopping adventures in
both "Terminator" films, Second-Choice Videos
is happy to suggest several other movies where
one or more characters travel to the future or the
past.
• "The Time Machine" — Based on the novel by

H.G. Wells, this obvious choice stars Rod Taylor
as a time-traveling scientist who journeys to the
future — an ugly world of cannibalism and
destruction.
• "Time After Time" — Also based on the writings
of H.G. Wells, Malcolm McDowell stars as Wells
himself, who travels to modern-day San Francisco
to stop Jack the Ripper. The famous murderer has
used Wells' time machine to escape the police.
• "Star Trek IV" — Captain Kirk and the Enter
prise crew get tossed back to modern-day San
Francisco and end up trying to save — get this —
two humpback whales.
• All three "Back to the Future" films — Michael
J. Fox travels to the '50s, the future and the Old
West in his souped-up De Lorean, with Christo
pher Lloyd trying to catch up.
• "The Philadelphia Experiment" — Two sailors
from World War II end up transported to the pre
sent day as part of a government experiment.
• "Time Bandits" — The title says it all, doesn't
it?
