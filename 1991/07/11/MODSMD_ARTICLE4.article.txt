						bridge to anonymity

People in our culture are
obsessed with the idea of
being unique; everyone
wants to be different from every
one else in society. Western civi
lization deems it glamorous to be
an individual instead of just
another face in the masses of
humanity. Right here at our own
high-powered Stanford, campus
inhabitants tend to idealize peo
ple who freely stand out from the
norm and claim their own niche in
the world.
What do Martin Luther King
Jr. and Albert Einstein have in
common? They both deviated
from worn-out, established ways
with their natural non-conformi
ties, and we revere them for it.
The American spirit of "rugged
individualism" prevails!
However, like it or not, we live
in a world in which we must con
form to certain social standards,
also called manners, in order to
live on a daily basis with other
people. These laws of common
politeness have become so
ingrained into our psyche that
most of us do not even think too
much about them, except under
special circumstances.
People are loathe to associate
with individuals who do not abide
by these unspoken rules. Society
brands them as antisocial, and
ostracizes them from the general
public. But sometimes this neces
sary conformity is a challenge.
Throughout most of my life, I
have had to make a conscious
effort to control certain impulses,
such as speaking unintelligibly or
staggering about wildly, which I
would naturally do if I did not
impose a check on myself. In this
respect I like to compare myself
with James Dean's character in
"Rebel Without A Cause" (except
that I don't smoke).
The all-powerful social estab
lishment imposes difficult norma
tive standards for us all to live by.
I have a condition known as cere
bral palsy, which affects my motor
coordination and often makes it
difficult for me to control my mus
cle movements. Dean had both a
speech impediment and chronic
halitosis, which interfered with his
ability to woo women and carry on
a normal conversation.
Both of us had to find ways of
managing our handicaps and
transforming them into a socially
acceptable mode. We had to
bridge the gap between ourselves
and anonymity, if you will. It took
effort, but we were up to the chal
lenge. No, we are not "overcom
ers." Dean and I hate that word;
we are merely "adapters to our
own circumstances."
You overcome organic chem
istry through much trial and
ordeal, or else you drop the
course, just like I dropped Chem
istry 35 last quarter. But with dis
ability, there is no dropping. You
have to learn to deal. Well, both
Dean and I — after many years of
fine-tuning our abilities — finally
mastered the art of walking, talk
ing and breathing. Now all of our
problems our solved and we lead
full, rich social lives. Not!
One of my earliest memories is
my mother saying to me, "Bryan,
we want you to look as normal as
possible."
What else could be said? Who
wants someone drooling or eating
with his mouth open at the table?
What would the neighbors think?
Jesus, what would my (potential)
date think?
Is it worth it to be lax in con-

trolling maladaptive impulses
when it might make those around
you uncomfortable? Disability
often involves a certain degree of
self-consciousness, especially
when you are growing up. And as
most of us know, college is a pretty
intense time for stuff like that.
This is the type of pressure that
society impresses upon all people
and what disabled individuals —
such as Dean and myself — must
frequently contend with. Wn must
repress the qualities about us that
people might scorn. That ano
nymity bridge again.
The social implications of dis
ability — at times misunderstood
by most people — are quite pro
nounced and often supersede the
more obvious physical difficulties,
such as impaired walking and lack
of balance.
Disability however, entails
many rewards, and it is here
where we may put individuality
into its proper perspective. It is a
source of pride to be able to dis
play a part of yourself that is dif
ferent from other people in a way
that is both friendly and open. To
change that would be ripping off
an integral part of yourself, and
that would be painful.
If you were a woman, would
you take a magic pill to turn your
self into a man? If you were black,
would you undergo surgery to
change your skin color to white?
Some would and some wouldn't.
There are clear advantages to
being one way over the other. But
even though we may not want to
admit it, such a change would
entail a great alteration in the way
we see ourselves and the way oth
ers see us.
Theoretically, race, religion,
color, gender, sexual orientation
and disability (am I missing any?)
should not matter in self-percep
tion, but these factors do instill a
sense of identity within the indi
vidual. This sense of self and fit
ting into the grand scheme of
things is a very powerful force. It
is a question of being comfortable
with yourself so that no such
change in identity is necessary. In
sum, it is not really building a
bridge to anonymity but a bridge
to ... we 11... I don't know. Fill in
the blank yourself.
That is the key to disability.
Hell, that's the key to life. The
rest will follow.
Here's to you Dean!
