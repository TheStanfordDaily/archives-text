## Money is not the answer anymore 
### 
It's inescapable. Time magazine devotes yet
another cover to the national financial crisis.
KCBS radio reports that the California state gov
ernment can't pay its own employees. A huge budget
crisis forces even Stanford, despite its affluent
image, to question its need-blind financial-aid policy,
a principle which forms the foundation of the Uni
versity's diversity ideal.
The money has run out. Throughout the 1980s,
flaws in our nation's economic, education and social
welfare systems were conveniently masked by a veri
table cornucopia of cash — cash in the form of
stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc. The list
goes on and on.
But no more. There is no money to simply write
bigger unemployment checks for impoverished and
often homeless alcoholics, drug abusers, mentally ill
and countless others in need. The financial crises
being faced by our government are making the grave
needs of the disenfranchised in our society increas
ingly clear.
However, was all that money ever really the
answer? Throwing money at a drug addict, without
counseling or any other more comprehensive treat
ment, is not going to solve his unemployment prob
lem.
Giving money to the parents of the homeless chil
dren of the Family Living Center in East Palo Alto is
not going to help 12-year-old Sarah as she deals with
being raped or make 10-year-old Tommy any less sui
cidal.
Bold innovation has been sorely needed for some
time, and maybe now the recession is going to force
it to happen. Stanford researchers are correct in
focusing on the current importance of research on
education. The fact that there has been so little edu
cation research is astonishing, even embarrassing, as

the current system is obviously ineffective.
Finally, there is no money to help patch the flaws,
and it is possible that no amount of money could
save the current system. We have no choice but to
research and be innovative.
Not that a few professors are going to get together
for a few months, talk things over and instantly solve
all the nation's problems, but academic leadership is
definitely needed.
The fact that Stanford students are learning first
hand about the lives of homeless children and their
needs is a step in the right direction. Hopefully those
students will be able to apply what they learn and
formulate new, more effective ways of addressing the
problem.
Outside academia, people must also relinquish
the status quo and be open to innovation. The recent
rejection — according to a reader's poll by The
Peninsula Times Tribune — of the idea of turning
Moffett Field into low-income housing shows the
lack of acceptance of new ideas.
This proposal is a creative effort to address the
problem of increasing homelessness due to a lack of
affordable housing and should be examined.
But people fear change. They arc inherently
threatened by it, no matter how valid the proposal or
how necessary the change. Yet if our society is to
progress toward the goal of making the necessities
and even enjoyments of life reasonably attainable for
all, change must happen. In fact, it must be
embraced.
What should these changes be? Obviously that
question looms. But the point is that now we must
really make them. We must look for real answers, not
rely on quick-cash fixes to cure our social ills. We
must analyze and question, and we can't be closed
minded.
