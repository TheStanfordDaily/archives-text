## 'Bottom up' model better for diverse patrons of Encina 
### 
Your article on Encina Gym in
last week's issue of The Weekly
summarizes very nicely how we
weight lifters got all "worked up"
while working out. The last point
of the article, that "the weight
lifters who use Encina Gym arc a
hard-to-please lot," is entirely cor
rect.
There's a reason for that. The
people who use Encina are
diverse, with a whole spectrum of
different objectives and needs.
Under the the current regime, the
weight room is conceived along

the model of varsity sports. The
nature of the game, football, say,
determines what strengths and
skills must be found and devel
oped. Men try out for positions
and then are trained to perform
their roles with maximum efficien
cy. The "top down" model is natu
ral and it works well.
But you cannot arrange a facil
ity like Encina on that model. You
need a "bottom up" model, which
starts off with the users: Who
comes to Encina? What are their
needs and goals? Only then can
you plan intelligently what equip
ment should be bought and how it
should be laid out.
Places that have developed
good general training facilities,
such as the University of Illinois,
separate the budget for these

facilities from the budget for varsi
ty sports. Perhaps a two-part
structure like that could work for
us at Stanford.
Given that Encina has never
been managed with the "bottom
up" view in mind, I have a serious
lack of confidence in the current
plans being described for the
entirely new facility that is intend
ed to rise within a few years.
No one who talked with me
during the circulation of the peti
tion expressed misgivings with
Encina per se. In fact, the poor
old place actually has lots of
admirers. Is it too outlandish to
suppose that a renovated Encina
could be the nucleus of the
upgraded general training facility?
