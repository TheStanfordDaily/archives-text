## Recycling paper can save the planet and your life 
### 
White paper — the type used
for computers and copy machines
— is omnipresent in the modern
office. Although it is one of the
highest-quality papers available,
this product is unfortunately one
of the most environmentally
harmful substances around today.
To achieve the paper's white
color, the manufacturers use a
type of chloridc bleach on the
pulp. Some of this blcach is
reclaimed and reused by the man
ufacturer, but much of it is
dumped into rivers.
In addition to chloridc blcach,
dioxins are also used in this
bleaching proccss. One of the
most toxic compounds known to

man, dioxins arc believed to causc
cancer. And if you are curious,
these dioxins are still present in
the paper used for most copy
machines.
Now for the good news about
white paper: It is completely rccy
clablc.
This style of paper is made
from long fibers — as opposed to
short-fibcred paper — and can be
recycled to create other high

quality products, such as white
paper and stationery. Since this
type of paper has already been
blcachcd oncc, it requires approx
imately 75 percent less blcach
than it did in the original refining
process.
In addition to decreasing water
pollution, recycling also produces
less air pollution and conserves
energy. Each ton of rccyclcd paper
saves the equivalent of 384 gallons
of oil, which would have been
used in the proccss of obtaining
and refining virgin resources.
On campus there are white
paper recycling barrels near many
of the copy machines and the
computer clusters, in addition to

Each ton of recycled
paper saves the equiva
lent 0f384 gallons of oil

some in other public areas.
But recycling alone just isn't
enough.
Individuals must take the sec
ond step and go out of their way to
buy and use recycled products
whenever possible. It is important
to create a market for products
made from recycled material, and
the easiest way to show manufac
turers that you care about the

future of the earth is to buy these
products.
The quality of products that
are made from recycled — as
opposed to virgin — resources is
identical. Many of you might have
heard store employees say the
reason they don't carry such-and
such recycled product is that the
quality is lower than that of a vir
gin product. This, however is inac
curate.
If a store does not have the
product you want, request it for
next time and buy it somewhere
else for now.
