## 1975 graduate readmitted as admissions dean 
### June Cohen 
W
T ▼ hen Jim Montoya
received his acceptance letter
from Stanford in 1971, he
never dreamed that 20 years
later he would be accepted

1 —
again — this time as dean of
undergraduate admissions.
Montoya, who was selected as

the new dean Tuesday, is follow
ing in the footsteps of one of the
University's most popular public
figures, "Dean Jean" Fetter, who
resigned in January from the posi
tion she held for seven years.
Good-natured and easygoing,
Montoya seems an ideal person to
follow Fetter. The San Jose native

attended Stanford as both an
undergraduate and a graduate
student before going on to a
career in college administration.
He has served as director of
admissions at both Occidental
College and Vassar College,
where he is currently dean of stu
dent life.
During his undergraduate
career at Stanford, Montoya was
a Spanish major focusing on Latin
American culture. He received
the highly esteemed Dinkelspiel
Award for scholarly attainment
and outstanding service to under
graduate students at Commence
ment in 1975.
Sally Mahoney, who headed
the search committee for the new
dean, described Montoya as a
"seasoned pro-

fessional with
roots at Stan
ford and a

national reputa
tion among college and university
admissions professionals. He
brings well-honed skills, strong
commitment to excellence in a
diverse student body [and] fresh
ideas" to Stanford.
Montoya said he is delighted to
be returning to Stanford, adding
that it has been easy to keep up
with Stanford over the years due
to the University's national profile.
But "Stanford is a different
place than it was when I graduat
ed in 1975," Montoya said. "The
school has really made a strong
commitment to undergraduate
education.
"Stanford also has a much
more national student body than
it did when I was a student. I
remember being surprised that
there were two or three New
Yorkers in my freshman dorm," he
said, pointing out that New York
ers now make up the third largest
population of students by state.
After spending six years in
New York himself — at Vassar
College in Poughkeepsie — Mon
toya looks forward eagerly to his
return to California. Good, plen
tiful Mexican food and year
round running are certainly part
of Stanford's appeal, he said, but
even more than the general
appeal of the West Coast, he
looks forward to the opportunity

to work with the University's
exemplary admissions staff.
"I have the luxury of moving
into an admissions office with an
extraordinary staff that will make
the transition smoother," said
Montoya. "Very few admissions
offices can claim such an extraor
dinary staff. I'm very pleased and
honored to be working with
them."
His enthusiasm is not fazed by
the negative media attention
Stanford has received during the
past year from the indirect-cost
controversy.
"I have no reservations about
the recent publicity Stanford has
received," Montoya said. "I think
higher education in general has
been given negative publicity. Not

only higher edu
cation, but in
particular pri
vate or indepen
dent education.

"I think this is a really impor
tant time at Stanford, and I'm
pleased that I'm able to be a part
of the administration for these
next few years," he added.
Commenting that he had never
heard the word "repositioning"
before he came to interview at
Stanford this spring, Montoya
said he believes the University
should stand firm on the issue of
need-blind admissions in the face
of the current budget crisis.
"One of my goals is to make
certain that Stanford is seen as a
viable option for most gifted stu
dents," Montoya said, adding that
a strong financial-aid program is
essential to meeting that goal.
He also said he is pleased that
Stanford combines its committees
on financial aid and admissions
instead of separating them, as
some schools do.
"My commitment has always
been to developing diverse com
munities," Montoya said. "I think
one reason I was selected was for
my experience working with dif
ferent communities — not only in
increasing the number of students
but also in creating an atmo
sphere where diversity can exist
and flourish."
In addition to his current posi
tion at Vassar, Montoya has also
served, at different times, as direc

tor of residence and associate
dean of students at Occidental,
where he was also the chair of the
college's multicultural education
committee and director of the Chi
cano Student Admission Program.
Montoya believes being dean
here will take much more time than
his previous admissions positions,
since Stanford receives at least
three times as many applications as
Vassar. But he said his experience
as a senior officer at Vassar has pre
pared him to gauge the amount of
energy he will need here.
"I have a very strong commit
ment to my professional life," said
Montoya, "and I'm used to work
ing weekends and evenings. 1

wanted this position at this point
in my life because I still have the
energy to give 150 percent."
And Montoya also seems to
have the energy needed to follow
in the footsteps of "Dean Jean," a
veritable icon on the Stanford
campus. He said he, too, enjoys
working with young people and
hopes to have the opportunity to
interact with students the same
way Fetter did.
"1 think Jean Fetter is an
incredible human being," Mon
toya said, "and I am most hon
ored that I was selected to follow
her." Although he would not com
mit himself to reading bedtime
stories in freshman dorms or

making an annual appearance in
Gaieties, as Fetter did, Montoya
did not back down from the chal
lenge either.
He said he "look[s] forward to
being seen as a dean of admis
sions oriented toward students"
and added that he "enjoyed simi
lar popularity as dean of student
life at Vassar."
Montoya explained his popular
ity at Vassar as "having something
to do with the fact that I admitted
all the students I deal with. I don't
have to face the ones that didn't
get in." But his amiable nature,
which was apparent even during a
brief telephone call, probably had
something to do with it as well.

brief telephone call, probably had
something to do with it as well.

W
T ▼ hen Jim Montoya
received his acceptance letter
from Stanford in 1971, he
never dreamed that 20 years
later he would be accepted

1 —
again — this time as dean of
undergraduate admissions.
Montoya, who was selected as

the new dean Tuesday, is follow
ing in the footsteps of one of the
University's most popular public
figures, "Dean Jean" Fetter, who
resigned in January from the posi
tion she held for seven years.
Good-natured and easygoing,
Montoya seems an ideal person to
follow Fetter. The San Jose native

attended Stanford as both an
undergraduate and a graduate
student before going on to a
career in college administration.
He has served as director of
admissions at both Occidental
College and Vassar College,
where he is currently dean of stu
dent life.
During his undergraduate
career at Stanford, Montoya was
a Spanish major focusing on Latin
American culture. He received
the highly esteemed Dinkelspiel
Award for scholarly attainment
and outstanding service to under
graduate students at Commence
ment in 1975.
Sally Mahoney, who headed
the search committee for the new
dean, described Montoya as a
"seasoned pro-

fessional with
roots at Stan
ford and a

national reputa
tion among college and university
admissions professionals. He
brings well-honed skills, strong
commitment to excellence in a
diverse student body [and] fresh
ideas" to Stanford.
Montoya said he is delighted to
be returning to Stanford, adding
that it has been easy to keep up
with Stanford over the years due
to the University's national profile.
But "Stanford is a different
place than it was when I graduat
ed in 1975," Montoya said. "The
school has really made a strong
commitment to undergraduate
education.
"Stanford also has a much
more national student body than
it did when I was a student. I
remember being surprised that
there were two or three New
Yorkers in my freshman dorm," he
said, pointing out that New York
ers now make up the third largest
population of students by state.
After spending six years in
New York himself — at Vassar
College in Poughkeepsie — Mon
toya looks forward eagerly to his
return to California. Good, plen
tiful Mexican food and year
round running are certainly part
of Stanford's appeal, he said, but
even more than the general
appeal of the West Coast, he
looks forward to the opportunity

to work with the University's
exemplary admissions staff.
"I have the luxury of moving
into an admissions office with an
extraordinary staff that will make
the transition smoother," said
Montoya. "Very few admissions
offices can claim such an extraor
dinary staff. I'm very pleased and
honored to be working with
them."
His enthusiasm is not fazed by
the negative media attention
Stanford has received during the
past year from the indirect-cost
controversy.
"I have no reservations about
the recent publicity Stanford has
received," Montoya said. "I think
higher education in general has
been given negative publicity. Not

only higher edu
cation, but in
particular pri
vate or indepen
dent education.

"I think this is a really impor
tant time at Stanford, and I'm
pleased that I'm able to be a part
of the administration for these
next few years," he added.
Commenting that he had never
heard the word "repositioning"
before he came to interview at
Stanford this spring, Montoya
said he believes the University
should stand firm on the issue of
need-blind admissions in the face
of the current budget crisis.
"One of my goals is to make
certain that Stanford is seen as a
viable option for most gifted stu
dents," Montoya said, adding that
a strong financial-aid program is
essential to meeting that goal.
He also said he is pleased that
Stanford combines its committees
on financial aid and admissions
instead of separating them, as
some schools do.
"My commitment has always
been to developing diverse com
munities," Montoya said. "I think
one reason I was selected was for
my experience working with dif
ferent communities — not only in
increasing the number of students
but also in creating an atmo
sphere where diversity can exist
and flourish."
In addition to his current posi
tion at Vassar, Montoya has also
served, at different times, as direc

tor of residence and associate
dean of students at Occidental,
where he was also the chair of the
college's multicultural education
committee and director of the Chi
cano Student Admission Program.
Montoya believes being dean
here will take much more time than
his previous admissions positions,
since Stanford receives at least
three times as many applications as
Vassar. But he said his experience
as a senior officer at Vassar has pre
pared him to gauge the amount of
energy he will need here.
"I have a very strong commit
ment to my professional life," said
Montoya, "and I'm used to work
ing weekends and evenings. 1

wanted this position at this point
in my life because I still have the
energy to give 150 percent."
And Montoya also seems to
have the energy needed to follow
in the footsteps of "Dean Jean," a
veritable icon on the Stanford
campus. He said he, too, enjoys
working with young people and
hopes to have the opportunity to
interact with students the same
way Fetter did.
"1 think Jean Fetter is an
incredible human being," Mon
toya said, "and I am most hon
ored that I was selected to follow
her." Although he would not com
mit himself to reading bedtime
stories in freshman dorms or

making an annual appearance in
Gaieties, as Fetter did, Montoya
did not back down from the chal
lenge either.
He said he "look[s] forward to
being seen as a dean of admis
sions oriented toward students"
and added that he "enjoyed simi
lar popularity as dean of student
life at Vassar."
Montoya explained his popular
ity at Vassar as "having something
to do with the fact that I admitted
all the students I deal with. I don't
have to face the ones that didn't
get in." But his amiable nature,
which was apparent even during a
brief telephone call, probably had
something to do with it as well.
