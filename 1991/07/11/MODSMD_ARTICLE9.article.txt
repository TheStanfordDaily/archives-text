The* task forcc report placed less empha
sis on education and prevention efforts
than Epstein's current job description docs.
After the task force report was released,
the University, unable to allocate funds to
pay for a new coordinator, looked for ways
to be more responsive to the needs of sur
vivors through internal reorganization,
according to Gail Prichard, a psychiatrist at
Cowell.
CSART, the Cowell Sexual Assault
Response Team, was born out of this effort.
A system was arranged by which a sexual
assault victim can come into Cowell or call
the Cowell emergency line and immediately
reach one of the therapists on the 4-mem
bcr team, which is comprised of two medi
cal doctors and two social workers.
The counselors arc now available 24
hours and the team guarantees immediate
response — within 15 minutes — in cases of
assault. In addition, the counselors are pre
pared to guide victims through all aspects
— medical, mental, emotional, spiritual
and judicial — of the healing process,
according to Prichard, who is coordinator
of the response team.
Since this change, which took place in
February, was never publicized, the student
population was largely unaware of the
changes.
ASSU funds position
Unsatisfied that all the Task Force's rec
ommendations were not being met and dis
contented with the perceived lack of
response on the part of the University, the
ASSU — at the suggestion of a student
coalition led by Epstein — voted to fund a
$40,000 one-year project that would imple
ment many of the task force's recommenda
tions.
Of this sum, $20,000 was intended to pay
the salary of a student coordinator filling an
internship position. The job description,
which was co-written by Epstein, called for
a recent graduate who would "provide lead
ership for and coordination of existing and
new sexual assault prevention education
and response efforts."
This job description was changed from

Monday is Susan Epstein's first day at
her new job, but neither she nor anyone
else in the University knows exactly what
her job is.
Epstein, who just graduated, will assume
a newly created position — coordinator of
student sexual assault prevention education
and response — a one-year internship that
is intended to prevent the causes and heal
the effects of sexual assault on campus. But
the exact nature of her responsibilities has
not yet been determined.
"My job will change probably every day
for about six months," said Epstein, who
has been actively involved in issues of sex
ual assault on campus for several years.
A graduate in symbolic systems, Epstein
has taught self-defense classes with the
Women Defending Ourselves Collective for
the past year and coordinated educational
programs on sexual assault for resident
assistants and incoming freshmen last fall.
Among the tasks set out for Epstein in
her job description are expanding and cen
tralizing the various education efforts
undertaken by students and the administra
tion, planning Orientation programs, coor
dinating self-defense workshops, acting as a
University-wide advocate for rape victims
and referring victims to other campus and
community resources.
Which of these responsibilities will take
precedence over the others is unclear at
this time, however. In the Sexual Assault
Task Forcc report that recommcndcd creat
ing the position, the role as advocate and
counselor was stressed. But in the current
job description, emphasis is pflaccd on the
educational and organizational roles.
Allison Berry, another recent graduate
who applied for the job, said she does "not
understand how they can choose a person
for a $20,000 job when they don't know
what the job is. How do they know they
chose the right person?"
Epstein, who participated in the task
force and spearheaded the movement to
have the ASSU fund the student position,
also wrote the job description used by the
ASSU.

Epstein is currently establishing a cen
tral office for such student groups as the
Rape Education Project and Project
HEAR (Heightening Education on
Acquaintance Rape) in Cowcll Student
Health Center and will be directly super
vised by Pat Fabiano, director of the Uni
versity Health Promotion Program.
Since the position is funded by the
ASSU, but positioned within University
structure, Epstein will play something of an
intermediary role — balancing the
demands and needs of students and staff
members.
The Sexual Assault task force report
The Task Force was appointed last year
in response to a growing concern on cam
pus with the issue of sexual assault, par
tially spurred by the findings of a 1988 sur
vey in which one in three Stanford women
and one in eight Stanford men reported
having full sexual activity when they did not
want to.
Included in the Task Force report was
the recommendation that a position be cre
ated for a coordinator of sexual assault
response services on campus.
This position was originally intended to
be filled by an individual with a master's
degree and at least two years experience
working with victims of rape trauma. The
coordinator would be both visible and
accessible to campus community members,
so women would know whom to approach
for help, should they be sexually assaulted.
The primary responsibilities of the coor
dinator, as indicated by the task force, were
to serve as "a University-wide advocate for
victims of sexual assault, offer immediate
crisis-intervention and short-term counsel
ing services to victims, refer them to appro
priate resources, provide them with infor
mation and support and, at their request,
accompany them to meetings with Univer
sity ... officials and police."

the one described in the task force recom
mendations and continued to evolve during
the following weeks.
A search was then conducted for an indi
vidual to fill the coordinator position. The
interview process was conducted by the
University in the same manner that all Uni
versity job searches are conducted, accord
ing to Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck.
Whereas the initial recommendations
had emphasized the need for "victims-sur
vivors of sexual assault [to] have one person
to turn to in order to avoid unnecessary
meetings which may compound the original
trauma," the revised job description dif
fused the responsibilities between the stu
dent intern and the Cowell response team.
Epstein's role in counseling victims is
still unclear.
Although Epstein has two years of infor
mal experience working with assault vic
tims, she has not yet received formal train
ing. She plans to take the counseling course
offered at the Rape Crisis Center at the

Recent Stanford graduate Susan Epstein has
been hired as the University's first coordinator
of student sexual assault prevention and
response. But just what she will do in that posi
tion remains unclear. The task force report
that called for the creation of her position
stressed the need for an advocate and coun
selor to rape victims. But the current job
description calls for an emphasis on educa
tional and organizational roles.

end of the summer.
Most University officials now define
Epstein's role less as an advocate or coun
selor than as an organizer and referral ser
vice for victims.
"1 think the coordinator will spend the
majority of her time on prevention and edu
cation," said Michael Jackson. "The
response team can respond to specific inci
dents, while the coordinator job is more
focused on referral to others and the design
of prevention and education programs."
One potential danger in this procedure
is that some rape victims, if merely given a
referral number when they call for help,
will not call the second number, according
to Allison Berry, a counselor with the
Peninsula Rape Crisis Center.
In addition, many victims are too with
drawn to ask for the information they really
want. For example, some call and ask for
one type of information, such as where they
could obtain an abortion, when they really
want counseling because they have been
sexually assaulted. An untrained individual

may not recognizc important signs of abuse,
she said.
Epstein does not see response as the pri
mary objective of her position either, since
the Cowell response team, which she views
as very promising, already exists.
"I should have a highly challenging job,
what with my office walls still being built in
Cowell, no office furniture or phone, being
funded by the ASSU but working in Uni
versity space and dealing with a controver
sial issue," said Epstein.
But she seems up to the challenge.
Epstein already has multiple goals, such as
arranging weekend self-defense workshops
and coordinating a larger educational pro
gram for freshman orientation.
Undaunted by the vagueness of her role,
Epstein says she has held several jobs in the
past where she determined her own role.
She says she is prepared to be flexible about
the scope of her job, and cheerfully offers
to take on any additional tasks that arise,
such as playing an increased role in advo
cacy or policy formation.
Lauded for her dedication and leader
ship abilities by all of her co-workers,
Epstein has an impressive history of accom
plishments. She organized academic pro
grams as a computer science teaching assis
tant and a resident computer coordinator
and received numerous scholastic awards
including an American Civil Liberties
Union award for investigative journalism in
high school.
"[She] brings to the job exemplary man
agement and organizational skills," said
Prichard, who believes Epstein's contribu
tions will include "creatively coordinating
student's involvement in education."
Prichard pointed out that Epstein pro
vided the response team with a crucial link
to student's experience and added that
their exact roles would develop through the
summer and that for the time being they
would have to be willing to live with "a lot
of blurriness."
