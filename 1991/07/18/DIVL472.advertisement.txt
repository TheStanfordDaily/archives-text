Andrew and Leslie Cockburn
An Important, controversial, eye-opening account of the secret relationship
between Israeli and American Intelligence, from the founding of the state of
Israel to the present crisis In the Gulf. Dangerous Liaison relies on information
from the Israeli intelligence establishment itself to compile a detailed history of the
unique cooperation between the CIA, the Pentagon and Israel's multi-faceted
intelligence system. The Cockburns reveal the inside story of Israeli arms deals and
"anti-terror" training of Medellin Cartel commandos in Colombia, Contras in
Honduras, and military squads in Guatemala. They describe the secret arrangement
by which Israelis gathered intelligence for the CIA in Third \X/orld countries—Turkey,
Iran, Uganda under Idi Amin, Zaire—where the U.S. could not, or didn't want to,
have a direct presence. A gem of investigative journalism
Andrew Cockburn is the author of The Threat: Inside the Soviet Military Machine.
Leslie Cockburn has worked for "CBS News," "60 Minutes," and "West 57th
Street." She is the author of Out of Control. The authors live in Washington, D C.
