The Arrow
of Time
by
Peter Coveney
&
Roger Highfield
A Fawcett Columbine
Book
Published by Ballantine Books
Picking up where Stephen Hawking's A Brief
History of Time left off, Coveney and
Highfield demonstrate that the common
sense view of time agrees with the most
advanced scientific theory. Time does in fact
move like an arrow, shooting forward into
what is genuinely unknown, leaving the past
immutably behind.
