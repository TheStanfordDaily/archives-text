# 'Sensational' brain surgery

### 
A Petaluma woman with an
inquiring mind wanted to know
how she could conquer rare circu
latory disorders that had caused
her to suffer a stroke and re
peated seizures. She found the
answer — in the National
Enquirer, of course.
Barbara Gerwitz said she
tracked down Asst. Prof. Gary
Steinberg, a neurosurgeon with
the School of Medicine, after
reading about him in the sensa
tional tabloid that referred to him
as the doctor who defused time
bombs in people's heads.
Steinberg and Dr. Harry Gold
smith of Boston performed a five
hour operation in which blood
vessels were rerouted from the
woman's belly to her brain.
'As far as we know it was the
first operation of its kind on the
West Coast," Steinberg said on
Tliesday. "There have been five
others in the rest of the nation."
The doctor said there have
been several other such opera
tions in Europe and China "with
good results."
Until the five-hour operation
on June 20, Gerwitz said she was
without hope.
The doctors unraveled a cluster
of blood vessels near the
intestines and routed them up
under her skin, across her chest
and neck and into her skull.
Gerwitz, 43, is recovering at
her home in Petaluma, waiting to
see whether the surgery will
improve blood flow to her brain.
"I'm hoping to be able to do
things like run around the house
with my son," she said Monday.
"This has given me new hope that
I'll be able to keep up with my 4-
year-old boy."
Gerwitz suffers from a condi
tion known as AVM, or arteriove
nous malformation, a throbbing
cluster of blood vessels in her
brain, which causes pounding
headaches and seizures. The ves
sels drew nourishment away from
her brain and could rupture at any
time, killing her.
Doctors told her they could do
nothing.
Then one day a friend sent her
the clipping from the National
Enquirer Gerwitz contacted Stein
berg, who said he could help.
In the meantime, however,
another problem was identified: a
rare blood vessel disease called
Moyamoya that blocks the main
cerebral artery. The condition was
apparently responsible for the
stroke Gerwitz suffered last Jan
uary that paralyzed her left side.
She's been in and out of the
hospital ever since, recovering
from the stroke, having the AVM
treated and, finally, undergoing
the rerouting procedure.
