# Safety policies consolidated
## 
### 
The University has released a
comprehensive new health and
safety policy placing greater
responsibility on supervisors and
researchers and consolidating its
current regulations.
The new regulations do not
represent a major policy shift but
assemble the "bits and pieces" of
current safety practices into a
comprehensive safety program,
said Health, Safety and Environ
mental Program Manager Peter
Burnes.
The guidelines specify that
supervisors, including faculty
supervisors, are responsible for
protecting the safety of employees
and students under their supervi
sion. They have the primary duty
for implementing the University's
health and safety policies.
"What is required is that super
visors know what hazards are in
their workplace, train their
employees to work with these haz
ards and assure that they comply
with Stanford's health and safety
policies," Environmental Health
and Safety Director Tom Mcßride
wrote in a statement.
Burnes said the regulations
might mean more work for some
supervisors but would end up
placing greater emphasis on
health and safety.

The new policy
is in response to
stricter federal
and state regula
tions, including
the California
State Illness and
Injury Prevention
Act, the federal
Laboratory Stan
dard/Chemical

Hygiene Plan and the California
Corporate Criminal Liability Act.
For the most part, these laws
have not required Stanford to
make major changes. Instead,
they "take the elements of good
safety practice and codify them,"
said Burnes.
Creating the new policy has
involved reviewing the safety pro
gram elements currently in place
and fitting them into the mold
required by federal and state
inspectors, he added.
One University policy change is
the requirement for increased
documentation of safety proce
dures. Information and guidelines
about training and inspections
must be written with a greater
level of precision, Burnes said.
In addition, the University has
included formal procedures for
accident investigation, hazard
assessment and training workers.
It also calls for rewarding employ
ees who comply with the practices
and disciplining those who don't.
Mcßride has been working
directly with faculty and supervi
sors in small groups during the
past few weeks on ways to imple
ment the new policies.
Much of the focus is on fitting
the general requirements to the
specific needs of a department or
research group — "How do you
look at your work area and the
program and make the two
merge?" said Burnes.
"These small group discussion
sessions have been very important
in gaining faculty understanding
of their individual responsibility
for health and safety," Mcßride
said in a statement.
Under the new rules, the role
of Environmental Health and
Safety should become more ser
vice-oriented, Burnes said. The
office will spend much of its time
working as an "in-house consul
tantcy" with various departments.
