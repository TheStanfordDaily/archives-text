# A 						contentious confirmation
## 
### 
Susan Epstein — who was
recently appointed the new stu
dent coordinator of sexual assault
prevention education and
response — was confirmed Mon
day night by the ASSU Senate.

J -"O J
But what was
originally thought
to be a mere for
mality turned
into an hour-long
debate about the
job's responsibili
ties and the
amount of con
trol the ASSU

would have over Epstein's work.
When the first vote on the con
firmation was taken, after about
30 minutes of discussion, four sen
ators voted yes, two voted no and
one abstained — two votes short
of the three-fourths majority
needed for approval.
Senator James Vera said he
voted no on the first vote because
the issue "merited more discus
sion." Following a motion to
reconsider and an amendment
giving the ASSU more oversight
responsibility, Vera changed his
mind.
The bill in its final form allows
the ASSU much scrutiny over
Epstein's work during the coming

year. The added restrictions are as
follows:
• Epstein must submit a written
quarterly report to the senate
regarding her job-related activi
ties for the previous quarter;
• She must work with other sex
ual assault response staff at Cow
ell Student Health Center in order
to ensure open communication
and non-duplication of effort;
• Any office-related equipment
that she buys for the program will
be the property of the ASSU and
not the University; and
• The senate will make a quar
terly re-evaluation of the number
of paid hours the director will
receive for the upcoming quarter.
The bill in its amended form
passed the senate on a divided
voice vote.
