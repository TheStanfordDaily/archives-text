# ASSU revokes USSA funding
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate voted 8-0
Monday night to eliminate its
funding for the newly founded
West Coast office of the United
States Student Association.
The move reduces next year's
budget for the ASSU Financial
Aid Office by $1,000.
While the funding for the new
office in Sacramento was under
scrutiny, the issue of ASSU mem

bership in the student organiza
tion was not questioned. The sen
ate voted unanimously to send a
delegation to the student associa
tion's meeting in August.

James Vera,
author of the leg
islation, proposed
a re-evaluation of
the agreement to
fund the new
office after he
wrote that this
decision had been
"rushed through"
in the last meet-

ing of the spring senate.
There was considerable contro
versy surrounding support of the
student association and of its new
office late last spring. The issue
was only settled by the senate
after lengthy debate.
In Monday's meeting, Vera
argued that nobody really knew
what would be done with the
money the ASSU would have
given the student association.
He said he wants to know the
make-up of the student associa
tion's budget and membership
before making a commitment to
fund the new office.
Much of the debate surround
ing the funding of the new office
follows past concern about the
organization's politics.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck said the student
association "helps financial aid"

but also makes many controversial
ideological statements — for
example, that "Defense Depart
ment-sponsored funding of uni
versity research should be elimi
nated."
The senate named sophomore
Vanessa Tapia, along with two
additional people of her choice, to
head the Stanford delegation to
the National USSA Conference
this August in Milwaukee.
