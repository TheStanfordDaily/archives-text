# ASSU backs gym activist
## 
### 
Monday marked a milestone in
Prof. Wilbur Knorr's crusade
against the Department of Athlet
ics for workout space in Encina
Gym, as the ASSU Senate voted
to support his position unani
mously.
Knorr, a professor of philoso
phy, had collected 591 signatures
on a petition arguing that the Ath
letics Department had no right to
impinge upon the exercise space
open to everyone at Stanford. The
ASSU bill, written by Senator
James Brown, calls for a halt to
the expansion of football meeting
rooms into the space previously
set aside for regular gym users.
The text of the legislation also
requests "that the current level of
service provided by Encina gym
(e.g. number of weights, space,
and hours of operation) be main
tained at least at the current levels
(after the construction of the foot
ball meeting rooms and addition
of the currently partitioned sec
tion of the old gymnastics area.)"

Encina man
agers should also
inform members
of the community
well in advance of
any change in the
level of service
provided by the
gym, the legisla
tion states. What's
more, according

to the legislation, available space
for exercise must be expanded to
include at least all of the old gym
nastics area, which the Crew team
plans to vacate.
An amendment that the weight
room not be closed during regular
Encina hours failed to pass Mon
day night.
While the ASSU has no direct
control over Encina gym or the
affairs of the Athletics Depart
ment, senators expect the legisla
tion to reinforce Knorr's position.
In other senate business:
• A bill written by ASSU
Financial Manager Michael Risch
authorizing an upgrade in the
ASSU computer system passed.

• A much-debated bill granting
a $25,000 loan to the ASSU Type
and Design Shop was passed
unanimously. The loan will sup
port plans for an upgrade in the
shop's Postscript typesetting sys
tem.
The bill stipulates a 10 percent
interest rate on the loan, which
must be paid to the ASSU over a
period of 5 years. Senator Dou
glas Bone said this interest rate is
"competitive with open market
loans."
• In legislation written by sena
tor James Brown, the senate
called on the University to main
tain the current level of comput
ing services in light of proposed
budget cuts.
• The senate also allocated
$100 for the ASSU to join the
National Association of Gradu
ate-Professional Students.
