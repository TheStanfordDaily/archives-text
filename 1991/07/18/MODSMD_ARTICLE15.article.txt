■ Harvard has offered early
retirement to 850 of its employees
in an effort to keep administrative
costs down.
Staff members who are at least
55 years old and have 10 or more
years of service at the university
may participate in the early-retire
ment program. The pension
income of employees who take the
offer will be calculated as if they
had worked five more years.
Faculty members are not eligi
ble.
■ Many Soviet institutions of
higher education have decided to
charge tuition for the first time
this fall.
An easing of the country's
tuition-free tradition was autho
rized last year by the Soviet Coun
cil of Ministers.
■ Three members of a banned
fraternity at the University of
Texas were sentenced to jail last
week for their roles in the beating
of a pledge. The sentences were
the harshest ever imposed for a
hazing incident in the state.
Two of the students were sen
tenced to 30 days in prison, while
the third received 15 days. All
three were also fined $500 each.
The students were members of
the university's Sigma Nu chapter,
which was abolished last spring
after investigators learned that
members had been physically and
psychologically abusing pledges.
The charges were filed in con
nection with the hazing last fall of
a student who investigators say
was beaten, humiliated and led
around a room by a claw hammer
that had been placed under his
testicles.
