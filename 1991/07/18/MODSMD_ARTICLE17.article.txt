# Smoke-bomber enters his plea
## 
### 
John Witchel, a recent Stan
ford graduate, plead nolo con
tendere to misdemeanor charges of
arson last week.
Witchel was arrested June 5 in
conjunction with the smoke bomb
ing of several sorority Rush tents
on Wilbur Field in April. Accord
ing to the Stanford Police Depart
ment, smoke bombs, equipped
with timers set for the beginning
of the parties, were tied to the
cross supports of the Pi Phi,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta
Delta Delta sororities' tents.
Only the bomb placed in the Pi
Phi tent went off, however. The
rest were deactivated by people
present, according to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. He said the situation
was "very, very dangerous,"
because people could have had
their fingers blown off.
Police traced the devices back
to Witchel through credit card
receipts.
Witchel's plea of nolo con
tendere, which literally means, "I
do not wish to contend," means
that he is not admitting his guilt,
but is stating he will offer no
defense, according to Niemeyer.
Witchel is subject, therefore, to
being judged guilty and punished
as if he had plead guilty or had
been convicted.
The difference between plead
ing guilty and pleading nolo con
tendere, according to Niemeyer, is
that Witchel's plea cannot be used
as proof of his guilt in another
legal proceeding on the same case,
such as one for punitive damages.
Witchel is scheduled for pre
liminary sentencing in Palo Alto
Municipal Court Sept. 10.
