# 'New tone' in negotiations
## 
### 
Contract negotiations between
the University and the United
Stanford Workers are under way
— and after two preliminary
rounds, negotiators from both
sides remain cautious about the
exchange.
"I detect a new tone" on the
part of the University negotiators,
chief union negotiator Michael
Tatham said. "They don't seem as
arrogant as they have in past
negotiations."
"We are guardedly hopeful," he
added.
University lawyer Michael Var
tain was more circumspect. "It's
too early to say," he said. "All we
have are pieces of paper."
During the first two meetings,
held Friday and Tuesday, the
teams established ground rules for
negotiation.
The face-to-face discussion is
crucial in a labor negotiation, Var
tain said, because "human beings
are being bound to how they oper
ate in the work place."
Also, both sides' intentions
must be clarified in person
because "what looks like an outra
geous proposal" may be reason
able after the rationale behind the
proposal is explained, Vartain
said.
The University will have two
weeks from Friday's meeting to
respond to a USW proposal,
which focuses on job security,
increased pay, better pensions and
more affordable medical insur
ance for the 1,300 workers repre
sented by the union.
At a press conference Friday,
members of the union negotiating
team described their frustration
with the current contract, which
expires Sept. 1.
According to union members,

the University doesn't pay work
ers enough. "We're concerned
we're going to get snookered
again," Tatham said. "Stanford
plays a shell game with money."
Top University administrators,
he said, received a higher raise
than workers in 1988.
He said he wants to make sure
workers receive funds earmarked
for raises, despite the University
wide wage freeze in place until
March. "A lot of money comes
from government sources —
money allocated for pay raises,"
he said.
He also addressed job security,
saying the University contracted
out jobs, causing layoffs of union
members.
Another union negotiator,
Barry Webb, spoke out against the
rising price of medical insurance.
He said insurance costs rose $50
per month this year. The price
hike, he said, meant many workers
couldn't afford to cover their fam
ilies.
During the press conference,
members of Students for the
USW, a group formed during the
tense 1988 negotiations with the
University, waved pro-union ban
ners.
