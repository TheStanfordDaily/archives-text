# Impact of Bush decision slight
## 
### 
The recent U.S. decision to lift
sanctions against South Africa
and President Bush's request for
universities to end divestment
programs will probably not have
an immediate effect on Stanford's
divestment policy.
But changes in the situation in
South Africa may eventually lead
the Board of Trustees to review its
investment guidelines.
Because Stanford's policy is
one of selective divestment and
was not predicated on U.S. sanc
tions, the government's move
"really in itself won't affect the
policy," said Barbara Benjamin-
Trevino, associate director of Uni
versity relations.
As a result, companies will con
tinue to be evaluated on a case-by
case basis, she added.
More changes could come in
the fall, when the two organiza
tions that advise the Board of
Trustees about Stanford's invest
ment policy reconvene. One
group, the Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility is
formed by the board; the other,
the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility, consists of faculty,

students, staff and alumni.
"We need to evaluate our cur
rent policy and see" how the situ
ation in South Africa changes,
said Gary Malone, director of the
advisory panel.
Currently the advisory groups
question investments in compa
nies that have not signed the Sul
livan Statement of Principles,
have not received a high rating for
compliance with them or have
sold goods to apartheid-enforcing
agencies such as the South
African police or military.
The statement of principles for
companies doing business in
South Africa focuses on combat
ing apartheid in two areas. The
first few guidelines deal with in
house desegregation — giving
equal pay for equal work, provid
ing equal benefits and having pro
grams for placing non-whites in
management positions.
The second set involves the
steps companies take to fight
apartheid in the larger commu
nity. This includes opposing
apartheid laws, helping to house
non-whites in traditionally white
areas and providing wages and
benefits for the families of
employees detained by the mili
tary or police because of
apartheid policies.
Despite the repeal of many

apartheid laws, Malone said the
advisory groups remain concerned
about the legacy of apartheid. For
example, the University may con
tinue to be wary of companies that
sell to the police and military
because "there is information to
suggest that the police and mili
tary are still not fully under civil
ian control," he added.
But the changes in South
Africa may require some new
standards for judging companies'
anti-apartheid policies. "How do
we now determine what's a pro
gressive company?" asked Mal
one.
It is also possible that in the
future some companies Stanford
does not invest in could once
again become eligible, Benjamin-
Trevino said.
