# Crime reports may be public
## 
### 
Under a new Department of
Education proposal, colleges
would be allowed to release cam
pus crime reports to the public,
something Stanford has always
been able to do.
The department maintains that
colleges are currently prohibited
from making their crime reports
available to the public under a
1974 privacy protection law, the
Buckley Amendment, which says
a college cannot release informa
tion about its students without
their permission.
The department's proposal for
new legislation comes in response
to mounting pressure from
reporters, judges and lawmakers.
Last March, a federal district
judge ruled in favor of a newspa
per editor at Southwest Missouri
State University who demanded
access to campus crime reports.
In addition, various student
groups and reporters have called
on the Education Department to
reinterpret the amendment. Last
week, the U.S. Senate approved a
crime bill amendment by Sen. Tim
Wirth, D-Colo., that would allow
colleges to make campus crime
reports available to the public.
The bill has yet to come before
the House of Representatives.
Mark Goodman, executive
director of the Student Press Law
Center in Washington, D.C., said
he thinks the Education Depart
ment's recent change of heart
came only after "they realized
they were way out of the main
stream" on the issue.
However, the department
hasn't "done enough as far as
we're concerned," Goodman said,
adding that it wants to keep col
leges from releasing crime reports
until the crime bill becomes law,
which could take several months
or longer.
Stanford is among the few col
leges that permit public access to
campus crime reports. The Stan
ford Police Department is consid
ered a public agency because it is
part of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office. Therefore, it
must make crime records public
under California law, said Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Also, unlike many colleges,
Stanford doesn't keep arrest
records along with scholastic
records.
That's why other schools run
into problems. "If you do choose
to comingle records," Herrington
said, "you cannot release them."
Herrington said he disagrees
with the current policy of keeping
student crime records off-limits to
the public.
It makes no sense to withhold
someone's arrest record only
because he or she is a student, he
added.
