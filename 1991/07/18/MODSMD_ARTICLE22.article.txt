# THE 						POWER PRINCIPLE
## 
### 
When medical student Julie
Switzer's professor described
contractions of the uterus in a
lecture last year, he turned to the class and
said, "You'll probably never feel this, but
your wife will."
A wife herself, Switzer felt her profes
sor's comment missed its mark on her and at
least one-third of her classmates at the
School of Medicine.
"I asked myself, 'Does he not realize that
30 to 40 percent of his students are women?
Is he blind to that? Does he just not see it?'
" Switzer said.
Switzer is one of the many women who
have come forward with accounts of sexist
behavior at the Medical School since Prof.
Frances Conley, a highly respected neuro
surgeon, resigned from a tenured professor
ship six weeks ago citing 25 years of subtle
sexism as her reason for leaving.
Conley's descriptions of demeaning sex
ist remarks and unsolicited fondling and
touching from male co-workers came as a
shock to many in the Medical School. But
many women have said similar experiences
have negatively impacted their experiences
at Stanford.
The national attention and campus dis
cussion sparked by Conley's resignation was
further fueled when University President
Donald Kennedy filed charges June 26
against a medical school professor for
alleged sexual harassment of a female stu
dent.
The debate that followed these events
has brought to the surface underlying sex
ism that experts say is pervasive in academ
ic medicine — not just at Stanford.
In the wake of these events, ongoing
campus debate and extensive national press
coverage, the Medical School is now con
templating its role in preventing sexism and
rethinking its policy on sexual harassment.
In a recent memo to the Medical School,
Dean David Korn stressed the need for the
community to "be in deed, as well as word,
a place where all individuals are respected
and encouraged to do their best work, free
of any discrimination or harassment."
In the memo, he proposed a dual goal of
informing students, staff and faculty of their
rights and responsibilities and also working
"to change deeply ingrained attitudes with
in our community" through "broad discus
sion and education."
No details were given, however, and the

appropriate chan
nels for achieving
these broad goals
have not yet been
determined.
Two committees
have been estab
lished at the
Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass
ment. An ad hoc
committee of the
School of
Medicine's Faculty
Senate is examining
the existing
University sexual
harassment policy
and assessing which
points need further
clarification for the
Medical School.
The other com
mittee, which is
working out of the
Korn's office, is clar
ifying the procedure
students should fol
low if they have been
sexually harassed.

At the same time, the University is for
mulating a new, broad-based policy on
unacceptable sexual conduct, which will
expand on the current sexual harassment
policy. The new guidelines will address a
broader spectrum of objectionable conduct,
ranging from gender-insensitive comments
and off-color jokes to sexual assault and
rape.
At this point, little definite progress has
been made by the newly established
Medical School committees. However, the
flurry of media attention and ongoing cam
pus debate have caused many people to
consider the issues and form their own opin
ions as to what steps the University — and
especially the Medical School — should
take to alleviate the problem of sexism on
campus.
Although outlooks on the severity of the
problem vary greatly, most people believe
the system must be adapted to better serve
those who have been victims of harassment
and sexism while also protecting the rights
of the accused.
Many suggestions and demands have

been laid on the table by concerned mem
bers of the campus community, both male
and female. Among these are requests that
the University:
• Establish a clear, well-publicized sys
tem of managing harassment cases;
• Create a permanent panel to investi
gate and hear sexual harassment cases;
• Establish sensitivity workshops to edu
cate the Medical Center community; and
• Publish clear, precise definitions
explaining the entire spectrum of unaccept
able sexual conduct, ranging from gender
insensitive comments to sexual assault
Since June, many women have come
forward with complaints, not of
harassment, but frequently of more
subtle — and some argue more insidious —
forms of sexism that experts say are perva
sive in medicine.
Academic medicine, due to its rigid hier
archies that define the relationships
between doctors, interns and students — as
well as nurses — lends itself toward the
abuse and misuse of power. This can create

an atmosphere that
fosters sexism and
harassment.
"Medicine is a
power trip for a lot of
people," said medical
student Julie Seav
ello. "It is a profession
based on power rela
tionships and sexual
harassment is an
abuse of power."
White men have
historically dominat
ed Western medicine
and many feel their
continued pre-emi
nence allows tradi
tional rigid hierar
chies — which dis
courage women and
minorities from
advancing — to
remain intact.
"Alleviating the
gender bias in cur
riculum is more a
matter of awareness
than anything else,"
said Conley. Many
students agree, draw
ing on their own
experiences to illus
trate examples of
gender insensitivity in
the Medical School.
The vast majority
of lecturers in the
Medical School are
male and, according
to medical student
Melissa Parisi, the
curriculum they teach
is subtly male-biased.
It ignores women's
health issues and is
based on traditional
methods of teaching
all-male classes, she
said.
Because most
medical research uses
male subjects, female

health problems are neglected and women
are devalued as patients, Switzer said.
In the first two years of medical school,
"lectures are mostly about the human con
dition, about modern disease and health in
people," said Switzer. "Yet the lecturers
speak almost entirely about men" and
examples always employ statistics for an
average 70 kg male. They do not use com
parable figures for female subjects.
"In anatomy, for example, when we cov
ered reproductive anatomy of man and
woman, we spent 45 minutes on male anato
my and the last 10 minutes on the female,"
said Switzer.

"The lecturer just
basically drew in a
vagina over the male
reproductive system
and said it was 'pret
ty much the same
thing,'" she said.
Switzer said she
finds it disturbing
that, as a future doc
tor, she doesn't even
know that much
about female anato
my.
In another inci
dent, medical stu
dent Julie Seavello
was angered when a
professor used a
slide of an inflatable
doll — "the kind of
sex toy that is adver
tised in magazines"
— during lecture to
illustrate respiration.
The following day,
Seavello approached
the professor to
explain why she
found the slide inap
propriate. He told
her that while she
had a right to her
own opinion, he
didn't see a problem
with it, she said.
"I just didn't feel
listened to," said
Seavello. "I find it

BY JUNE COHEN
When Prof. Frances
Conley resigned from
the Medical School six
weeks ago, a heated
debate over sexism in
medicine came to life.
The debate has forced
the University to
consider how to change
the atmosphere that
breeds abuse.

really hard to trust him, to listen to him
now."
Although Seavello is angered by sexist
incidents, she "is not interested in being a vic
tim." Rather, she "see[s] it as a big loss to the
perpetrator when we can't trust our profes
sors, when we no longer have faith in them or
respect them. We think the faculty should
know that, should know that it's a loss to
them when they lose our respect."
"Medicine is a humanistic profession,"
said Seavello. "In order for it to be healthy,
everyone in it has to be healthy. That's why
harassment in medicine is so poisonous.
Harassment compromises the integrity of

the relations between
patient and physi
cian."
But Seavello be
lieves the situation is
improving. "There's a
lot of sincere interest
to make things bet
ter," she said. "I real
ly love it here.... It's
mostly because I love
the place that I want
to make it better."
Others, however,
are less optimistic.
Milton Mills, a sixth
year medical student
and former president
of the Stanford Med
ical Students Assoc
iation, said he was
"not confident at all"
that progress will be
made. "I'm extremely
disturbed by the slow
ness of the response,
the clumsiness of the
response. The Uni
versity always seems to
be reacting instead of
acting.
"They go through
the motions of a
response without ever
giving one. The best
we get is a public
statement saying X, Y
and Z are wrong, but
they never do any-

thing about it,"he said.
Conley also remains skeptical about the
outcome of the current debate. Referring to
Stanford as a large institution that is not
geared for change, she said she "is not overly
optimistic" that long-term changes will be
instituted.
"I've been here too long," she added.
Although opinions vary on the extent of
the problem, an overriding concern of both
students and faculty members is the need
for a well-defined, cogent policy that
defines different levels of unacceptable
behavior and provides clear mechanisms for
victims to come forward with complaints.
Current policy states, "The determina
tion of what constitutes sexual harassment

will vary with the particular
circumstances," but defines it
generally as "repeated and
unwanted sexual behavior,
such as sexual contact and ver
bal comments or suggestions
which adversely affect the
working or learning environ
ment."
This vague definition is
unclear "and unacceptable,
said Ravi Chandra, president
of the Stanford Medical
Students Association.
"The policy is just too gen
eral," said Chandra. "It needs
to explain what constitutes
sexual harassment" and define
the broad spectrum of unac
ceptable behavior, ranging
from gender-insensitive com
ments to sexual assault.
The Faculty Senate com
mittee on sexual harassment
and gender insensitivity is cur
rently confronting this prob
lem. According to Assoc.
Prof. Linda Shortliffe, the
committee chair, they are
examining how well the
University's policy applies to
the Medical School and how
broad a spectrum of sexual
conduct will be addressed by
the policy.
The committee will report
to the Faculty Senate of the
Medical School in September
with its recommendations.

The handling of sexual
harassment complaints
is another point of con
tention at the Medical Center.
The charges filed against
Prof. Mark Perlroth last
month elicited a number of
objections from community
members, including those who

felt the particulars of case — including
Perlroth's identity — should have been kept
confidential and those who felt the female
students filing charges were not treated
respectfully.
"We need a definite statement with defi
nite procedural information," said Switzer.
"In the past it hasn't been easy to get infor
mation on what to do if you think you have
been sexually harassed."
Because the current procedure for filing
a grievance contains a number of ambigui
ties, the committee from the dean's office is
currently "trying to make a procedure with
in the medical center that is user-friendly,"
said Assoc. Dean and committee chair
Charlotte Jacobs.
One solution under consideration is the
creation of a sexual harassment panel that
would "serve as faculty and students' first
line resource," according to committee
member Melissa Parisi.
The creation of such a panel is sug
gested in recent guidelines published by
the American Medical Association for
combating sexual harassment at medical
schools.
"The panel would include two levels of
mechanisms for dealing with formal and
non-formal charges," said Parisi, who also
emphasized the need for panel members to
be trained in harassment issues.
"[Panel members] must understand and
know what is entailed in sexual harass
ment," said Parisi. "They need to know what
to expect," especially since members must
keep their work confidential and will not be
able to confer with individuals outside the
panel about the cases.
Along with clarifying the procedure,
Switzer said the Medical School also needs
to establish an "advocacy program for
female students. It was my observation that

the women in the ongoing sexual harass
ment case weren't treated with a lot of
respect. We need to have someone who can
be an advocate for the students throughout
the process."
Switzer suggested that Susan Epstein,
the University's new student coordinator of
sexual assault prevention, education and
response might be able to fill that advocacy
position.
The Perlroth case was investigated by
an ad hoc committee organized through
the dean's office. Although people were
generally satisfied with the committee's
handling of the case, concern has been
voiced that a more permanent structure
should be established to conduct such

investigations.
However, Assoc. Dean and
Committee Chair Robert Cutler said a
Eermanent committee was not practical
ecause personal friendships could
interfere with a committee member's
evaluation of a co-worker. For this rea
son, he believes it is necessary that for
each individual case an ad hoc commit
tee be formed, comprised of individuals
who are not connected to the alleged
perpetrator and can provide unbiased
opinions.
Cutler also stressed that the primary
consideration in choosing individuals for
such a committee is their investigative
capabilities.
But Mills objects to the use of ad hoc
committees because the members are uned
ucated on the subject of sexual harassment
and are thus unqualified.
"The (Perlroth) investigation was placed
in the hands of people with absolutely no
experience and that is absolutely unaccept
able," he said.
University efforts are primarily
focused on the revision of state
ments and procedures; however,
most people feel it will take far more than a
change in policy to alleviate sexism in the
Medical School.
"The main thing is to maintain an active,
open dialogue about what behavior is
allowed and what isn't," said Conley. "It's
not a female problem, it's not a male prob
lem. It's a societal problem. And the only
way to tackle it is [to allow for open discus
sion.]"
Conlcy's call for open dialogue between
men and women was echoed by many oth
ers, including men who are anxious to get
involved in the issues.

"Many people have turned their atten
tion to the harassment code, which is great,"
said medical student Lee Sanders. "But my
concern is with involving men in the dia
logue. Fifteen years ago sexism was consid
ered a women's issue, but I just think that's
the wrong way of looking at it."
"All of us want to be sensitive co-work
ers in the future," Sanders said. "What I'd
like to see happen is for the Medical School
to set up opportunities for students and
house staff to engage in facilitated discus
sion" involving issues that concern every
one.
And while most individuals agree that
educational efforts are necessary if signifi
cant changes are to be effected in the

Medical School, differences
surface over whether educa
tional workshops — on gen
der and cultural sensitivity —
should be required of faculty,
staff and/or students.
"Ideally — you know in a
fantasy world — it would be a
requirement for everyone
involved" in the Medical
Center to receive some sort of
educational program on gen
der sensitivity, said Parisi. She
added that it would probably
be too difficult to institute
such a program.
Sanders agreed, saying, "It
would be difficult to require
anything else of med stu
dents," but he suggested that
such workshops could be
offered as one- or two-credit
courses for students.
As for faculty, Sanders
said, "Professors are the
roughest issue, but one that
doesn't warrant too much
focus" because they tend to be
set in their ways. Sanders
added that educational efforts
should be focused on the
"next generation."
But Mills disagreed, saying
educational programs are nec
essary for the entire Medical
Center community.
If Stanford is "to maintain
its claim of creating leaders —
it must set the standards....
The administration should
call in a consultant to create a
mandatory training program
for faculty, staff and stu
dents," said Mills. He pointed
out that most major corpora
tions, such as Xerox and
Hewlett-Packard, have al
ready successfully integrated

sensitivity workshops into
training programs for their managerial
staffs.
Shortliffe also said she views education
as an important aspect of combating sexism,
and believes businesses are "way ahead of
the university" in this regard.
While many students agreed that they
would like to require sensitivity workshops
for faculty members, most felt the idea sim
ply wasn't feasible — that professors would
resent being forced to attend them. Many
professors agree.
"Professors hate being forced to do any
thing," and they will resent having to attend
workshops, said Conley.
Conley went on to point out that
"whether or not educational efforts will
work depend on the quality of the work
shop. A mediocre program won't reach
intellectual elite; a mediocre program will
be like going to traffic school," she said.
Unsatisfied with the idea of merely
revising policy, many people are
now looking to the University for a
stronger statement, seeing the current con
troversy as an ideal forum for institutional
change and growth.
"I'd like to see vision from the top," said
Sanders, who thinks the administration
should take this opportunity not to deny
that we have any problems here but to
embrace the changes that are occurring in
the demographics of medicine.
"A dean should come out at Orientation
and speak about the things that individuals
of different backgrounds are bringing to the
face of medicine," said Sanders .
"The dean should excite us about enter
ing the changing face of medicine. That's the
kind of leadership Stanford needs," he said.

resignation last
month brought the
Issue of sexism at
the Medical School
Into the national
media, as well as
under the micro
scope of committees
and Individuals
pushing for reform.
Despite these Inten
tions, Conley Is
skeptical about
progress. "I've been
here too long," she
says.


Medical school students Melissa Paris), left,
and Julie Switzer, hold "Gray's Anatomy," a
standard textbook that epitomizes a subtle
form of sexism in their field. Examples in the
book, as well as in other sources, consistent
ly use a 70-kilogram male rather than a
lighter female.


Second-year medical school student Julie Seavello says sexual
harassment is an insult to medicine. Seavello, who has a one-year
old son, says her love for Stanford makes her want to heal the
wounds of harassment.
When medical student Julie
Switzer's professor described
contractions of the uterus in a
lecture last year, he turned to the class and
said, "You'll probably never feel this, but
your wife will."
A wife herself, Switzer felt her profes
sor's comment missed its mark on her and at
least one-third of her classmates at the
School of Medicine.
"I asked myself, 'Does he not realize that
30 to 40 percent of his students are women?
Is he blind to that? Does he just not see it?'
" Switzer said.
Switzer is one of the many women who
have come forward with accounts of sexist
behavior at the Medical School since Prof.
Frances Conley, a highly respected neuro

many women have said similar experiences

The national attention and campus dis

No details were given, however, and the

appropriate chan

Two committees
have been estab
lished at the
Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass
ment. An ad hoc
committee of the
School of
Medicine's Faculty
Senate is examining
the existing
University sexual
harassment policy
and assessing which
points need further
clarification for the
Medical School.
The other com

unacceptable sexual conduct, which will
expand on the current sexual harassment
policy. The new guidelines will address a

The handling of sexual

is another point of con
tention at the Medical Center.
The charges filed against

objections from community

ment case weren't treated with a lot of
respect. We need to have someone who can
be an advocate for the students throughout
the process."
Switzer suggested that Susan Epstein,
the University's new student coordinator of
sexual assault prevention, education and
response might be able to fill that advocacy
position.
The Perlroth case was investigated by
an ad hoc committee organized through
the dean's office. Although people were
generally satisfied with the committee's
handling of the case, concern has been
voiced that a more permanent structure
should be established to conduct such

investigations.
However, Assoc. Dean and
Committee Chair Robert Cutler said a
Eermanent committee was not practical
ecause personal friendships could
interfere with a committee member's
evaluation of a co-worker. For this rea
son, he believes it is necessary that for
each individual case an ad hoc commit
tee be formed, comprised of individuals
who are not connected to the alleged
perpetrator and can provide unbiased
opinions.
Cutler also stressed that the primary
consideration in choosing individuals for
such a committee is their investigative
capabilities.
But Mills objects to the use of ad hoc
committees because the members are uned
ucated on the subject of sexual harassment
and are thus unqualified.
"The (Perlroth) investigation was placed
in the hands of people with absolutely no
experience and that is absolutely unaccept
able," he said.
University efforts are primarily
focused on the revision of state
ments and procedures; however,
most people feel it will take far more than a
change in policy to alleviate sexism in the
Medical School.
"The main thing is to maintain an active,
open dialogue about what behavior is
allowed and what isn't," said Conley. "It's
not a female problem, it's not a male prob
lem. It's a societal problem. And the only
way to tackle it is [to allow for open discus
sion.]"
Conlcy's call for open dialogue between
men and women was echoed by many oth
ers, including men who are anxious to get
involved in the issues.

"Many people have turned their atten
tion to the harassment code, which is great,"
said medical student Lee Sanders. "But my
concern is with involving men in the dia
logue. Fifteen years ago sexism was consid
ered a women's issue, but I just think that's
the wrong way of looking at it."
"All of us want to be sensitive co-work
ers in the future," Sanders said. "What I'd
like to see happen is for the Medical School
to set up opportunities for students and
house staff to engage in facilitated discus
sion" involving issues that concern every
one.
And while most individuals agree that
educational efforts are necessary if signifi
cant changes are to be effected in the

Medical School, differences
surface over whether educa
tional workshops — on gen
der and cultural sensitivity —
should be required of faculty,
staff and/or students.
"Ideally — you know in a
fantasy world — it would be a
requirement for everyone
involved" in the Medical
Center to receive some sort of
educational program on gen
der sensitivity, said Parisi. She
added that it would probably
be too difficult to institute
such a program.
Sanders agreed, saying, "It
would be difficult to require
anything else of med stu
dents," but he suggested that
such workshops could be
offered as one- or two-credit
courses for students.
As for faculty, Sanders
said, "Professors are the
roughest issue, but one that
doesn't warrant too much
focus" because they tend to be
set in their ways. Sanders
added that educational efforts
should be focused on the
"next generation."
But Mills disagreed, saying
educational programs are nec
essary for the entire Medical
Center community.
If Stanford is "to maintain
its claim of creating leaders —
it must set the standards....
The administration should
call in a consultant to create a
mandatory training program
for faculty, staff and stu
dents," said Mills. He pointed
out that most major corpora
tions, such as Xerox and
Hewlett-Packard, have al
ready successfully integrated

sensitivity workshops into
training programs for their managerial
staffs.
Shortliffe also said she views education
as an important aspect of combating sexism,
and believes businesses are "way ahead of
the university" in this regard.
While many students agreed that they
would like to require sensitivity workshops
for faculty members, most felt the idea sim
ply wasn't feasible — that professors would
resent being forced to attend them. Many
professors agree.
"Professors hate being forced to do any
thing," and they will resent having to attend
workshops, said Conley.
Conley went on to point out that
"whether or not educational efforts will
work depend on the quality of the work
shop. A mediocre program won't reach
intellectual elite; a mediocre program will
be like going to traffic school," she said.
Unsatisfied with the idea of merely
revising policy, many people are
now looking to the University for a
stronger statement, seeing the current con
troversy as an ideal forum for institutional
change and growth.
"I'd like to see vision from the top," said
Sanders, who thinks the administration
should take this opportunity not to deny
that we have any problems here but to
embrace the changes that are occurring in
the demographics of medicine.
"A dean should come out at Orientation
and speak about the things that individuals
of different backgrounds are bringing to the
face of medicine," said Sanders .
"The dean should excite us about enter
ing the changing face of medicine. That's the
kind of leadership Stanford needs," he said.

Frances Conley's
resignation last
month brought the
Issue of sexism at
the Medical School
Into the national
media, as well as
under the micro
scope of committees
and Individuals
pushing for reform.
Despite these Inten
tions, Conley Is
skeptical about
progress. "I've been
here too long," she
says.


Medical school students Melissa Paris), left,
and Julie Switzer, hold "Gray's Anatomy," a
standard textbook that epitomizes a subtle
form of sexism in their field. Examples in the
book, as well as in other sources, consistent
ly use a 70-kilogram male rather than a
lighter female.


Second-year medical school student Julie Seavello says sexual
harassment is an insult to medicine. Seavello, who has a one-year
old son, says her love for Stanford makes her want to heal the
wounds of harassment.
When medical student Julie
Switzer's professor described
contractions of the uterus in a
lecture last year, he turned to the class and
said, "You'll probably never feel this, but
your wife will."
A wife herself, Switzer felt her profes
sor's comment missed its mark on her and at
least one-third of her classmates at the
School of Medicine.
"I asked myself, 'Does he not realize that
30 to 40 percent of his students are women?
Is he blind to that? Does he just not see it?'
" Switzer said.
Switzer is one of the many women who
have come forward with accounts of sexist
behavior at the Medical School since Prof.
Frances Conley, a highly respected neuro
surgeon, resigned from a tenured professor
ship six weeks ago citing 25 years of subtle
sexism as her reason for leaving.
Conley's descriptions of demeaning sex
ist remarks and unsolicited fondling and
touching from male co-workers came as a
shock to many in the Medical School. But
many women have said similar experiences
have negatively impacted their experiences
at Stanford.
The national attention and campus dis
cussion sparked by Conley's resignation was
further fueled when University President
Donald Kennedy filed charges June 26
against a medical school professor for
alleged sexual harassment of a female stu
dent.
The debate that followed these events
has brought to the surface underlying sex
ism that experts say is pervasive in academ
ic medicine — not just at Stanford.
In the wake of these events, ongoing
campus debate and extensive national press
coverage, the Medical School is now con
templating its role in preventing sexism and
rethinking its policy on sexual harassment.
In a recent memo to the Medical School,
Dean David Korn stressed the need for the
community to "be in deed, as well as word,
a place where all individuals are respected
and encouraged to do their best work, free
of any discrimination or harassment."
In the memo, he proposed a dual goal of
informing students, staff and faculty of their
rights and responsibilities and also working
"to change deeply ingrained attitudes with
in our community" through "broad discus
sion and education."
No details were given, however, and the

appropriate chan
nels for achieving
these broad goals
have not yet been
determined.
Two committees
have been estab
lished at the
Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass
ment. An ad hoc
committee of the
School of
Medicine's Faculty
Senate is examining
the existing
University sexual
harassment policy
and assessing which
points need further
clarification for the
Medical School.
The other com
mittee, which is
working out of the
Korn's office, is clar
ifying the procedure
students should fol
low if they have been
sexually harassed.

At the same time, the University is for
mulating a new, broad-based policy on
unacceptable sexual conduct, which will
expand on the current sexual harassment
policy. The new guidelines will address a
broader spectrum of objectionable conduct,
ranging from gender-insensitive comments
and off-color jokes to sexual assault and
rape.
At this point, little definite progress has
been made by the newly established
Medical School committees. However, the
flurry of media attention and ongoing cam
pus debate have caused many people to
consider the issues and form their own opin
ions as to what steps the University — and
especially the Medical School — should
take to alleviate the problem of sexism on
campus.
Although outlooks on the severity of the
problem vary greatly, most people believe
the system must be adapted to better serve
those who have been victims of harassment
and sexism while also protecting the rights
of the accused.
Many suggestions and demands have

been laid on the table by concerned mem
bers of the campus community, both male
and female. Among these are requests that
the University:
• Establish a clear, well-publicized sys
tem of managing harassment cases;
• Create a permanent panel to investi
gate and hear sexual harassment cases;
• Establish sensitivity workshops to edu
cate the Medical Center community; and
• Publish clear, precise definitions
explaining the entire spectrum of unaccept
able sexual conduct, ranging from gender
insensitive comments to sexual assault
Since June, many women have come
forward with complaints, not of
harassment, but frequently of more
subtle — and some argue more insidious —
forms of sexism that experts say are perva
sive in medicine.
Academic medicine, due to its rigid hier
archies that define the relationships
between doctors, interns and students — as
well as nurses — lends itself toward the
abuse and misuse of power. This can create

an atmosphere that
fosters sexism and
harassment.
"Medicine is a
power trip for a lot of
people," said medical
student Julie Seav
ello. "It is a profession
based on power rela
tionships and sexual
harassment is an
abuse of power."
White men have
historically dominat
ed Western medicine
and many feel their
continued pre-emi
nence allows tradi
tional rigid hierar
chies — which dis
courage women and
minorities from
advancing — to
remain intact.
"Alleviating the
gender bias in cur
riculum is more a
matter of awareness
than anything else,"
said Conley. Many
students agree, draw
ing on their own
experiences to illus
trate examples of
gender insensitivity in
the Medical School.
The vast majority
of lecturers in the
Medical School are
male and, according
to medical student
Melissa Parisi, the
curriculum they teach
is subtly male-biased.
It ignores women's
health issues and is
based on traditional
methods of teaching
all-male classes, she
said.
Because most
medical research uses
male subjects, female

health problems are neglected and women
are devalued as patients, Switzer said.
In the first two years of medical school,
"lectures are mostly about the human con
dition, about modern disease and health in
people," said Switzer. "Yet the lecturers
speak almost entirely about men" and
examples always employ statistics for an
average 70 kg male. They do not use com
parable figures for female subjects.
"In anatomy, for example, when we cov
ered reproductive anatomy of man and
woman, we spent 45 minutes on male anato
my and the last 10 minutes on the female,"
said Switzer.

"The lecturer just
basically drew in a
vagina over the male
reproductive system
and said it was 'pret
ty much the same
thing,'" she said.
Switzer said she
finds it disturbing
that, as a future doc
tor, she doesn't even
know that much
about female anato
my.
In another inci
dent, medical stu
dent Julie Seavello
was angered when a
professor used a
slide of an inflatable
doll — "the kind of
sex toy that is adver
tised in magazines"
— during lecture to
illustrate respiration.
The following day,
Seavello approached
the professor to
explain why she
found the slide inap
propriate. He told
her that while she
had a right to her
own opinion, he
didn't see a problem
with it, she said.
"I just didn't feel
listened to," said
Seavello. "I find it

BY JUNE COHEN
When Prof. Frances
Conley resigned from
the Medical School six
weeks ago, a heated
debate over sexism in
medicine came to life.
The debate has forced
the University to
consider how to change
the atmosphere that
breeds abuse.

really hard to trust him, to listen to him
now."
Although Seavello is angered by sexist
incidents, she "is not interested in being a vic
tim." Rather, she "see[s] it as a big loss to the
perpetrator when we can't trust our profes
sors, when we no longer have faith in them or
respect them. We think the faculty should
know that, should know that it's a loss to
them when they lose our respect."
"Medicine is a humanistic profession,"
said Seavello. "In order for it to be healthy,
everyone in it has to be healthy. That's why
harassment in medicine is so poisonous.
Harassment compromises the integrity of

the relations between
patient and physi
cian."
But Seavello be
lieves the situation is
improving. "There's a
lot of sincere interest
to make things bet
ter," she said. "I real
ly love it here.... It's
mostly because I love
the place that I want
to make it better."
Others, however,
are less optimistic.
Milton Mills, a sixth
year medical student
and former president
of the Stanford Med
ical Students Assoc
iation, said he was
"not confident at all"
that progress will be
made. "I'm extremely
disturbed by the slow
ness of the response,
the clumsiness of the
response. The Uni
versity always seems to
be reacting instead of
acting.
"They go through
the motions of a
response without ever
giving one. The best
we get is a public
statement saying X, Y
and Z are wrong, but
they never do any-

thing about it,"he said.
Conley also remains skeptical about the
outcome of the current debate. Referring to
Stanford as a large institution that is not
geared for change, she said she "is not overly
optimistic" that long-term changes will be
instituted.
"I've been here too long," she added.
Although opinions vary on the extent of
the problem, an overriding concern of both
students and faculty members is the need
for a well-defined, cogent policy that
defines different levels of unacceptable
behavior and provides clear mechanisms for
victims to come forward with complaints.
Current policy states, "The determina
tion of what constitutes sexual harassment

will vary with the particular
circumstances," but defines it
generally as "repeated and
unwanted sexual behavior,
such as sexual contact and ver
bal comments or suggestions
which adversely affect the
working or learning environ
ment."
This vague definition is
unclear "and unacceptable,
said Ravi Chandra, president
of the Stanford Medical
Students Association.
"The policy is just too gen
eral," said Chandra. "It needs
to explain what constitutes
sexual harassment" and define
the broad spectrum of unac
ceptable behavior, ranging
from gender-insensitive com
ments to sexual assault.
The Faculty Senate com
mittee on sexual harassment
and gender insensitivity is cur
rently confronting this prob
lem. According to Assoc.
Prof. Linda Shortliffe, the
committee chair, they are
examining how well the
University's policy applies to
the Medical School and how
broad a spectrum of sexual
conduct will be addressed by
the policy.
The committee will report
to the Faculty Senate of the
Medical School in September
with its recommendations.

The handling of sexual
harassment complaints
is another point of con
tention at the Medical Center.
The charges filed against
Prof. Mark Perlroth last
month elicited a number of
objections from community
members, including those who

felt the particulars of case — including
Perlroth's identity — should have been kept
confidential and those who felt the female
students filing charges were not treated
respectfully.
"We need a definite statement with defi
nite procedural information," said Switzer.
"In the past it hasn't been easy to get infor
mation on what to do if you think you have
been sexually harassed."
Because the current procedure for filing
a grievance contains a number of ambigui
ties, the committee from the dean's office is
currently "trying to make a procedure with
in the medical center that is user-friendly,"
said Assoc. Dean and committee chair
Charlotte Jacobs.
One solution under consideration is the
creation of a sexual harassment panel that
would "serve as faculty and students' first
line resource," according to committee
member Melissa Parisi.
The creation of such a panel is sug
gested in recent guidelines published by
the American Medical Association for
combating sexual harassment at medical
schools.
"The panel would include two levels of
mechanisms for dealing with formal and
non-formal charges," said Parisi, who also
emphasized the need for panel members to
be trained in harassment issues.
"[Panel members] must understand and
know what is entailed in sexual harass
ment," said Parisi. "They need to know what
to expect," especially since members must
keep their work confidential and will not be
able to confer with individuals outside the
panel about the cases.
Along with clarifying the procedure,
Switzer said the Medical School also needs
to establish an "advocacy program for
female students. It was my observation that

the women in the ongoing sexual harass
ment case weren't treated with a lot of
respect. We need to have someone who can
be an advocate for the students throughout
the process."
Switzer suggested that Susan Epstein,
the University's new student coordinator of
sexual assault prevention, education and
response might be able to fill that advocacy
position.
The Perlroth case was investigated by
an ad hoc committee organized through
the dean's office. Although people were
generally satisfied with the committee's
handling of the case, concern has been
voiced that a more permanent structure
should be established to conduct such

investigations.
However, Assoc. Dean and
Committee Chair Robert Cutler said a
Eermanent committee was not practical
ecause personal friendships could
interfere with a committee member's
evaluation of a co-worker. For this rea
son, he believes it is necessary that for
each individual case an ad hoc commit
tee be formed, comprised of individuals
who are not connected to the alleged
perpetrator and can provide unbiased
opinions.
Cutler also stressed that the primary
consideration in choosing individuals for
such a committee is their investigative
capabilities.
But Mills objects to the use of ad hoc
committees because the members are uned
ucated on the subject of sexual harassment
and are thus unqualified.
"The (Perlroth) investigation was placed
in the hands of people with absolutely no
experience and that is absolutely unaccept
able," he said.
University efforts are primarily
focused on the revision of state
ments and procedures; however,
most people feel it will take far more than a
change in policy to alleviate sexism in the
Medical School.
"The main thing is to maintain an active,
open dialogue about what behavior is
allowed and what isn't," said Conley. "It's
not a female problem, it's not a male prob
lem. It's a societal problem. And the only
way to tackle it is [to allow for open discus
sion.]"
Conlcy's call for open dialogue between
men and women was echoed by many oth
ers, including men who are anxious to get
involved in the issues.

"Many people have turned their atten

said medical student Lee Sanders. "But my
concern is with involving men in the dia
logue. Fifteen years ago sexism was consid
ered a women's issue, but I just think that's

ers in the future," Sanders said. "What I'd

No details were given, however, and the

appropriate chan

Two committees
have been estab
lished at the
Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass
ment. An ad hoc
committee of the
School of
Medicine's Faculty
Senate is examining
the existing
University sexual
harassment policy
and assessing which

clarification for the
Medical School.
The other com
mittee, which is

At the same time, the University is for

expand on the current sexual harassment

broader spectrum of objectionable conduct,
ranging from gender-insensitive comments

woman, we spent 45 minutes on male anato
my and the last 10 minutes on the female,"
said Switzer.

"The lecturer just
basically drew in a
vagina over the male
reproductive system
and said it was 'pret
ty much the same
thing,'" she said.
Switzer said she
finds it disturbing
that, as a future doc
tor, she doesn't even
know that much
about female anato
my.
In another inci

dent Julie Seavello
was angered when a
professor used a
slide of an inflatable
doll — "the kind of
sex toy that is adver
tised in magazines"
— during lecture to
illustrate respiration.
The following day,
Seavello approached
the professor to
explain why she
found the slide inap
propriate. He told
her that while she
had a right to her
own opinion, he

with it, she said.

BY JUNE COHEN
When Prof. Frances
Conley resigned from
the Medical School six
weeks ago, a heated
debate over sexism in
medicine came to life.
The debate has forced
the University to
consider how to change
the atmosphere that
breeds abuse.

really hard to trust him, to listen to him
now."
Although Seavello is angered by sexist
incidents, she "is not interested in being a vic
tim." Rather, she "see[s] it as a big loss to the
perpetrator when we can't trust our profes
sors, when we no longer have faith in them or
respect them. We think the faculty should
know that, should know that it's a loss to
them when they lose our respect."
"Medicine is a humanistic profession,"
said Seavello. "In order for it to be healthy,
everyone in it has to be healthy. That's why
harassment in medicine is so poisonous.
Harassment compromises the integrity of

the relations between
patient and physi
cian."
But Seavello be
lieves the situation is
improving. "There's a
lot of sincere interest
to make things bet
ter," she said. "I real
ly love it here.... It's
mostly because I love
the place that I want
to make it better."
Others, however,
are less optimistic.
Milton Mills, a sixth
year medical student
and former president
of the Stanford Med
ical Students Assoc
iation, said he was
"not confident at all"
that progress will be
made. "I'm extremely
disturbed by the slow
ness of the response,
the clumsiness of the
response. The Uni
versity always seems to
be reacting instead of
acting.
"They go through
the motions of a
response without ever
giving one. The best
we get is a public
statement saying X, Y
and Z are wrong, but
they never do any-

thing about it,"he said.
Conley also remains skeptical about the
outcome of the current debate. Referring to
Stanford as a large institution that is not
geared for change, she said she "is not overly
optimistic" that long-term changes will be
instituted.
"I've been here too long," she added.
Although opinions vary on the extent of
the problem, an overriding concern of both
students and faculty members is the need
for a well-defined, cogent policy that
defines different levels of unacceptable
behavior and provides clear mechanisms for
victims to come forward with complaints.
Current policy states, "The determina
tion of what constitutes sexual harassment

will vary with the particular
circumstances," but defines it
generally as "repeated and
unwanted sexual behavior,
such as sexual contact and ver
bal comments or suggestions
which adversely affect the
working or learning environ
ment."
This vague definition is
unclear "and unacceptable,
said Ravi Chandra, president
of the Stanford Medical
Students Association.
"The policy is just too gen
eral," said Chandra. "It needs
to explain what constitutes
sexual harassment" and define
the broad spectrum of unac
ceptable behavior, ranging
from gender-insensitive com
ments to sexual assault.
The Faculty Senate com
mittee on sexual harassment
and gender insensitivity is cur
rently confronting this prob
lem. According to Assoc.
Prof. Linda Shortliffe, the
committee chair, they are
examining how well the
University's policy applies to
the Medical School and how
broad a spectrum of sexual
conduct will be addressed by
the policy.
The committee will report
to the Faculty Senate of the
Medical School in September
with its recommendations.

The handling of sexual
harassment complaints
is another point of con
tention at the Medical Center.
The charges filed against
Prof. Mark Perlroth last
month elicited a number of
objections from community
members, including those who

felt the particulars of case — including
Perlroth's identity — should have been kept
confidential and those who felt the female
students filing charges were not treated
respectfully.
"We need a definite statement with defi
nite procedural information," said Switzer.
"In the past it hasn't been easy to get infor
mation on what to do if you think you have
been sexually harassed."
Because the current procedure for filing
a grievance contains a number of ambigui
ties, the committee from the dean's office is
currently "trying to make a procedure with
in the medical center that is user-friendly,"
said Assoc. Dean and committee chair
Charlotte Jacobs.
One solution under consideration is the
creation of a sexual harassment panel that
would "serve as faculty and students' first
line resource," according to committee
member Melissa Parisi.
The creation of such a panel is sug
gested in recent guidelines published by
the American Medical Association for
combating sexual harassment at medical
schools.
"The panel would include two levels of
mechanisms for dealing with formal and
non-formal charges," said Parisi, who also
emphasized the need for panel members to
be trained in harassment issues.
"[Panel members] must understand and
know what is entailed in sexual harass
ment," said Parisi. "They need to know what
to expect," especially since members must
keep their work confidential and will not be
able to confer with individuals outside the
panel about the cases.
Along with clarifying the procedure,
Switzer said the Medical School also needs
to establish an "advocacy program for
female students. It was my observation that

the women in the ongoing sexual harass
ment case weren't treated with a lot of
respect. We need to have someone who can
be an advocate for the students throughout
the process."
Switzer suggested that Susan Epstein,
the University's new student coordinator of
sexual assault prevention, education and
response might be able to fill that advocacy
position.
The Perlroth case was investigated by
an ad hoc committee organized through
the dean's office. Although people were
generally satisfied with the committee's
handling of the case, concern has been
voiced that a more permanent structure
should be established to conduct such

investigations.
However, Assoc. Dean and
Committee Chair Robert Cutler said a
Eermanent committee was not practical
ecause personal friendships could
interfere with a committee member's
evaluation of a co-worker. For this rea
son, he believes it is necessary that for
each individual case an ad hoc commit
tee be formed, comprised of individuals
who are not connected to the alleged
perpetrator and can provide unbiased
opinions.
Cutler also stressed that the primary
consideration in choosing individuals for
such a committee is their investigative
capabilities.
But Mills objects to the use of ad hoc
committees because the members are uned
ucated on the subject of sexual harassment
and are thus unqualified.
"The (Perlroth) investigation was placed
in the hands of people with absolutely no
experience and that is absolutely unaccept
able," he said.
University efforts are primarily
focused on the revision of state
ments and procedures; however,
most people feel it will take far more than a
change in policy to alleviate sexism in the
Medical School.
"The main thing is to maintain an active,
open dialogue about what behavior is
allowed and what isn't," said Conley. "It's
not a female problem, it's not a male prob
lem. It's a societal problem. And the only
way to tackle it is [to allow for open discus
sion.]"
Conlcy's call for open dialogue between
men and women was echoed by many oth
ers, including men who are anxious to get
involved in the issues.

"Many people have turned their atten
tion to the harassment code, which is great,"
said medical student Lee Sanders. "But my
concern is with involving men in the dia
logue. Fifteen years ago sexism was consid
ered a women's issue, but I just think that's
the wrong way of looking at it."
"All of us want to be sensitive co-work
ers in the future," Sanders said. "What I'd
like to see happen is for the Medical School
to set up opportunities for students and
house staff to engage in facilitated discus
sion" involving issues that concern every
one.
And while most individuals agree that
educational efforts are necessary if signifi
cant changes are to be effected in the

Medical School, differences
surface over whether educa
tional workshops — on gen
der and cultural sensitivity —
should be required of faculty,
staff and/or students.
"Ideally — you know in a
fantasy world — it would be a
requirement for everyone
involved" in the Medical
Center to receive some sort of
educational program on gen
der sensitivity, said Parisi. She
added that it would probably
be too difficult to institute
such a program.
Sanders agreed, saying, "It
would be difficult to require
anything else of med stu
dents," but he suggested that
such workshops could be
offered as one- or two-credit
courses for students.
As for faculty, Sanders
said, "Professors are the
roughest issue, but one that
doesn't warrant too much
focus" because they tend to be
set in their ways. Sanders
added that educational efforts
should be focused on the
"next generation."
But Mills disagreed, saying
educational programs are nec
essary for the entire Medical
Center community.
If Stanford is "to maintain
its claim of creating leaders —
it must set the standards....
The administration should
call in a consultant to create a
mandatory training program
for faculty, staff and stu
dents," said Mills. He pointed
out that most major corpora
tions, such as Xerox and
Hewlett-Packard, have al
ready successfully integrated

sensitivity workshops into
training programs for their managerial
staffs.
Shortliffe also said she views education
as an important aspect of combating sexism,
and believes businesses are "way ahead of
the university" in this regard.
While many students agreed that they
would like to require sensitivity workshops
for faculty members, most felt the idea sim
ply wasn't feasible — that professors would
resent being forced to attend them. Many
professors agree.
"Professors hate being forced to do any
thing," and they will resent having to attend
workshops, said Conley.
Conley went on to point out that
"whether or not educational efforts will
work depend on the quality of the work
shop. A mediocre program won't reach
intellectual elite; a mediocre program will
be like going to traffic school," she said.
Unsatisfied with the idea of merely
revising policy, many people are
now looking to the University for a
stronger statement, seeing the current con
troversy as an ideal forum for institutional
change and growth.
"I'd like to see vision from the top," said
Sanders, who thinks the administration
should take this opportunity not to deny
that we have any problems here but to
embrace the changes that are occurring in
the demographics of medicine.
"A dean should come out at Orientation
and speak about the things that individuals
of different backgrounds are bringing to the
face of medicine," said Sanders .
"The dean should excite us about enter
ing the changing face of medicine. That's the
kind of leadership Stanford needs," he said.

Frances Conley's
resignation last
month brought the
Issue of sexism at
the Medical School
Into the national
media, as well as
under the micro
scope of committees
and Individuals
pushing for reform.
Despite these Inten
tions, Conley Is
skeptical about
progress. "I've been
here too long," she
says.


Medical school students Melissa Paris), left,
and Julie Switzer, hold "Gray's Anatomy," a
standard textbook that epitomizes a subtle
form of sexism in their field. Examples in the
book, as well as in other sources, consistent
ly use a 70-kilogram male rather than a
lighter female.


Second-year medical school student Julie Seavello says sexual
harassment is an insult to medicine. Seavello, who has a one-year
old son, says her love for Stanford makes her want to heal the
wounds of harassment.
When medical student Julie
Switzer's professor described
contractions of the uterus in a
lecture last year, he turned to the class and
said, "You'll probably never feel this, but
your wife will."
A wife herself, Switzer felt her profes
sor's comment missed its mark on her and at
least one-third of her classmates at the
School of Medicine.
"I asked myself, 'Does he not realize that
30 to 40 percent of his students are women?
Is he blind to that? Does he just not see it?'
" Switzer said.
Switzer is one of the many women who
have come forward with accounts of sexist
behavior at the Medical School since Prof.
Frances Conley, a highly respected neuro
surgeon, resigned from a tenured professor
ship six weeks ago citing 25 years of subtle
sexism as her reason for leaving.
Conley's descriptions of demeaning sex
ist remarks and unsolicited fondling and
touching from male co-workers came as a
shock to many in the Medical School. But
many women have said similar experiences
have negatively impacted their experiences
at Stanford.
The national attention and campus dis
cussion sparked by Conley's resignation was
further fueled when University President
Donald Kennedy filed charges June 26
against a medical school professor for
alleged sexual harassment of a female stu
dent.
The debate that followed these events
has brought to the surface underlying sex
ism that experts say is pervasive in academ
ic medicine — not just at Stanford.
In the wake of these events, ongoing
campus debate and extensive national press
coverage, the Medical School is now con
templating its role in preventing sexism and
rethinking its policy on sexual harassment.
In a recent memo to the Medical School,
Dean David Korn stressed the need for the
community to "be in deed, as well as word,
a place where all individuals are respected
and encouraged to do their best work, free
of any discrimination or harassment."
In the memo, he proposed a dual goal of
informing students, staff and faculty of their
rights and responsibilities and also working
"to change deeply ingrained attitudes with
in our community" through "broad discus
sion and education."
No details were given, however, and the

appropriate chan
nels for achieving
these broad goals
have not yet been
determined.
Two committees
have been estab
lished at the
Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass
ment. An ad hoc
committee of the
School of
Medicine's Faculty
Senate is examining
the existing
University sexual
harassment policy
and assessing which
points need further
clarification for the
Medical School.
The other com
mittee, which is
working out of the
Korn's office, is clar
ifying the procedure
students should fol
low if they have been
sexually harassed.

At the same time, the University is for
mulating a new, broad-based policy on
unacceptable sexual conduct, which will
expand on the current sexual harassment
policy. The new guidelines will address a
broader spectrum of objectionable conduct,
ranging from gender-insensitive comments
and off-color jokes to sexual assault and
rape.
At this point, little definite progress has
been made by the newly established
Medical School committees. However, the
flurry of media attention and ongoing cam
pus debate have caused many people to
consider the issues and form their own opin
ions as to what steps the University — and
especially the Medical School — should
take to alleviate the problem of sexism on
campus.
Although outlooks on the severity of the
problem vary greatly, most people believe
the system must be adapted to better serve
those who have been victims of harassment
and sexism while also protecting the rights
of the accused.
Many suggestions and demands have

been laid on the table by concerned mem
bers of the campus community, both male
and female. Among these are requests that
the University:
• Establish a clear, well-publicized sys
tem of managing harassment cases;
• Create a permanent panel to investi
gate and hear sexual harassment cases;
• Establish sensitivity workshops to edu
cate the Medical Center community; and
• Publish clear, precise definitions
explaining the entire spectrum of unaccept
able sexual conduct, ranging from gender
insensitive comments to sexual assault
Since June, many women have come
forward with complaints, not of
harassment, but frequently of more
subtle — and some argue more insidious —
forms of sexism that experts say are perva
sive in medicine.
Academic medicine, due to its rigid hier
archies that define the relationships
between doctors, interns and students — as
well as nurses — lends itself toward the
abuse and misuse of power. This can create

an atmosphere that
fosters sexism and
harassment.
"Medicine is a
power trip for a lot of
people," said medical
student Julie Seav
ello. "It is a profession
based on power rela
tionships and sexual
harassment is an
abuse of power."
White men have
historically dominat
ed Western medicine
and many feel their
continued pre-emi
nence allows tradi
tional rigid hierar
chies — which dis
courage women and
minorities from
advancing — to
remain intact.
"Alleviating the
gender bias in cur
riculum is more a
matter of awareness
than anything else,"
said Conley. Many
students agree, draw
ing on their own
experiences to illus
trate examples of
gender insensitivity in
the Medical School.
The vast majority
of lecturers in the
Medical School are
male and, according
to medical student
Melissa Parisi, the
curriculum they teach
is subtly male-biased.
It ignores women's
health issues and is
based on traditional
methods of teaching
all-male classes, she
said.
Because most
medical research uses
male subjects, female

health problems are neglected and women
are devalued as patients, Switzer said.
In the first two years of medical school,
"lectures are mostly about the human con
dition, about modern disease and health in
people," said Switzer. "Yet the lecturers
speak almost entirely about men" and
examples always employ statistics for an
average 70 kg male. They do not use com
parable figures for female subjects.
"In anatomy, for example, when we cov
ered reproductive anatomy of man and
woman, we spent 45 minutes on male anato
my and the last 10 minutes on the female,"
said Switzer.

"The lecturer just
basically drew in a
vagina over the male
reproductive system
and said it was 'pret
ty much the same
thing,'" she said.
Switzer said she
finds it disturbing
that, as a future doc
tor, she doesn't even
know that much
about female anato
my.
In another inci
dent, medical stu
dent Julie Seavello
was angered when a
professor used a
slide of an inflatable
doll — "the kind of
sex toy that is adver
tised in magazines"

illustrate respiration.

ly use a 70-kilogram male rather than a
lighter female.


Second-year medical school student Julie Seavello says sexual
harassment is an insult to medicine. Seavello, who has a one-year
old son, says her love for Stanford makes her want to heal the
wounds of harassment.
When medical student Julie
Switzer's professor described
contractions of the uterus in a
lecture last year, he turned to the class and
said, "You'll probably never feel this, but
your wife will."
A wife herself, Switzer felt her profes
sor's comment missed its mark on her and at
least one-third of her classmates at the
School of Medicine.
"I asked myself, 'Does he not realize that
30 to 40 percent of his students are women?
Is he blind to that? Does he just not see it?'
" Switzer said.
Switzer is one of the many women who
have come forward with accounts of sexist
behavior at the Medical School since Prof.
Frances Conley, a highly respected neuro
surgeon, resigned from a tenured professor
ship six weeks ago citing 25 years of subtle
sexism as her reason for leaving.
Conley's descriptions of demeaning sex
ist remarks and unsolicited fondling and
touching from male co-workers came as a
shock to many in the Medical School. But
many women have said similar experiences
have negatively impacted their experiences
at Stanford.
The national attention and campus dis
cussion sparked by Conley's resignation was
further fueled when University President
Donald Kennedy filed charges June 26
against a medical school professor for
alleged sexual harassment of a female stu
dent.
The debate that followed these events
has brought to the surface underlying sex
ism that experts say is pervasive in academ
ic medicine — not just at Stanford.
In the wake of these events, ongoing
campus debate and extensive national press
coverage, the Medical School is now con
templating its role in preventing sexism and
rethinking its policy on sexual harassment.
In a recent memo to the Medical School,
Dean David Korn stressed the need for the
community to "be in deed, as well as word,
a place where all individuals are respected
and encouraged to do their best work, free
of any discrimination or harassment."
In the memo, he proposed a dual goal of
informing students, staff and faculty of their
rights and responsibilities and also working
"to change deeply ingrained attitudes with
in our community" through "broad discus
sion and education."
No details were given, however, and the

appropriate chan
nels for achieving
these broad goals
have not yet been
determined.
Two committees
have been estab
lished at the
Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass
ment. An ad hoc
committee of the
School of
Medicine's Faculty
Senate is examining
the existing
University sexual
harassment policy
and assessing which
points need further
clarification for the
Medical School.
The other com
mittee, which is
working out of the
Korn's office, is clar
ifying the procedure
students should fol
low if they have been
sexually harassed.

At the same time, the University is for
mulating a new, broad-based policy on
unacceptable sexual conduct, which will
expand on the current sexual harassment
policy. The new guidelines will address a
broader spectrum of objectionable conduct,
ranging from gender-insensitive comments
and off-color jokes to sexual assault and
rape.
At this point, little definite progress has
been made by the newly established
Medical School committees. However, the
flurry of media attention and ongoing cam
pus debate have caused many people to
consider the issues and form their own opin
ions as to what steps the University — and
especially the Medical School — should
take to alleviate the problem of sexism on
campus.
Although outlooks on the severity of the
problem vary greatly, most people believe
the system must be adapted to better serve
those who have been victims of harassment
and sexism while also protecting the rights
of the accused.
Many suggestions and demands have

been laid on the table by concerned mem
bers of the campus community, both male
and female. Among these are requests that
the University:
• Establish a clear, well-publicized sys
tem of managing harassment cases;
• Create a permanent panel to investi
gate and hear sexual harassment cases;
• Establish sensitivity workshops to edu
cate the Medical Center community; and
• Publish clear, precise definitions
explaining the entire spectrum of unaccept
able sexual conduct, ranging from gender
insensitive comments to sexual assault
Since June, many women have come
forward with complaints, not of
harassment, but frequently of more
subtle — and some argue more insidious —
forms of sexism that experts say are perva
sive in medicine.
Academic medicine, due to its rigid hier
archies that define the relationships
between doctors, interns and students — as
well as nurses — lends itself toward the
abuse and misuse of power. This can create

an atmosphere that
fosters sexism and
harassment.
"Medicine is a
power trip for a lot of
people," said medical
student Julie Seav
ello. "It is a profession
based on power rela
tionships and sexual
harassment is an
abuse of power."
White men have
historically dominat
ed Western medicine
and many feel their
continued pre-emi
nence allows tradi
tional rigid hierar
chies — which dis
courage women and
minorities from
advancing — to
remain intact.
"Alleviating the
gender bias in cur
riculum is more a
matter of awareness
than anything else,"
said Conley. Many
students agree, draw
ing on their own
experiences to illus
trate examples of
gender insensitivity in
the Medical School.
The vast majority
of lecturers in the
Medical School are
male and, according
to medical student
Melissa Parisi, the
curriculum they teach
is subtly male-biased.
It ignores women's
health issues and is
based on traditional
methods of teaching
all-male classes, she
said.
Because most
medical research uses
male subjects, female

health problems are neglected and women
are devalued as patients, Switzer said.
In the first two years of medical school,
"lectures are mostly about the human con
dition, about modern disease and health in
people," said Switzer. "Yet the lecturers
speak almost entirely about men" and
examples always employ statistics for an
average 70 kg male. They do not use com
parable figures for female subjects.
"In anatomy, for example, when we cov
ered reproductive anatomy of man and
woman, we spent 45 minutes on male anato
my and the last 10 minutes on the female,"
said Switzer.

"The lecturer just
basically drew in a
vagina over the male
reproductive system
and said it was 'pret
ty much the same
thing,'" she said.
Switzer said she
finds it disturbing
that, as a future doc
tor, she doesn't even
know that much
about female anato
my.
In another inci
dent, medical stu
dent Julie Seavello
was angered when a
professor used a
slide of an inflatable
doll — "the kind of
sex toy that is adver
tised in magazines"
— during lecture to
illustrate respiration.
The following day,
Seavello approached
the professor to
explain why she
found the slide inap
propriate. He told
her that while she
had a right to her
own opinion, he
didn't see a problem
with it, she said.
"I just didn't feel
listened to," said
Seavello. "I find it

BY JUNE COHEN
When Prof. Frances
Conley resigned from
the Medical School six
weeks ago, a heated
debate over sexism in
medicine came to life.
The debate has forced
the University to
consider how to change
the atmosphere that
breeds abuse.

really hard to trust him, to listen to him
now."
Although Seavello is angered by sexist
incidents, she "is not interested in being a vic
tim." Rather, she "see[s] it as a big loss to the
perpetrator when we can't trust our profes
sors, when we no longer have faith in them or
respect them. We think the faculty should
know that, should know that it's a loss to
them when they lose our respect."
"Medicine is a humanistic profession,"
said Seavello. "In order for it to be healthy,
everyone in it has to be healthy. That's why
harassment in medicine is so poisonous.
Harassment compromises the integrity of

the relations between
patient and physi
cian."
But Seavello be
lieves the situation is
improving. "There's a
lot of sincere interest
to make things bet
ter," she said. "I real
ly love it here.... It's
mostly because I love
the place that I want
to make it better."
Others, however,
are less optimistic.
Milton Mills, a sixth
year medical student
and former president
of the Stanford Med
ical Students Assoc
iation, said he was
"not confident at all"
that progress will be
made. "I'm extremely
disturbed by the slow
ness of the response,
the clumsiness of the
response. The Uni
versity always seems to
be reacting instead of
acting.
"They go through
the motions of a
response without ever
giving one. The best
we get is a public
statement saying X, Y
and Z are wrong, but
they never do any-

thing about it,"he said.
Conley also remains skeptical about the
outcome of the current debate. Referring to
Stanford as a large institution that is not
geared for change, she said she "is not overly
optimistic" that long-term changes will be
instituted.
"I've been here too long," she added.
Although opinions vary on the extent of
the problem, an overriding concern of both
students and faculty members is the need
for a well-defined, cogent policy that
defines different levels of unacceptable
behavior and provides clear mechanisms for
victims to come forward with complaints.
Current policy states, "The determina
tion of what constitutes sexual harassment

will vary with the particular
circumstances," but defines it
generally as "repeated and
unwanted sexual behavior,
such as sexual contact and ver
bal comments or suggestions
which adversely affect the
working or learning environ
ment."
This vague definition is
unclear "and unacceptable,
said Ravi Chandra, president
of the Stanford Medical
Students Association.
"The policy is just too gen
eral," said Chandra. "It needs
to explain what constitutes
sexual harassment" and define
the broad spectrum of unac
ceptable behavior, ranging
from gender-insensitive com
ments to sexual assault.
The Faculty Senate com
mittee on sexual harassment
and gender insensitivity is cur
rently confronting this prob
lem. According to Assoc.
Prof. Linda Shortliffe, the
committee chair, they are
examining how well the
University's policy applies to
the Medical School and how
broad a spectrum of sexual
conduct will be addressed by
the policy.
The committee will report
to the Faculty Senate of the
Medical School in September
with its recommendations.

The handling of sexual
harassment complaints
is another point of con
tention at the Medical Center.
The charges filed against
Prof. Mark Perlroth last
month elicited a number of
objections from community
members, including those who

felt the particulars of case — including
Perlroth's identity — should have been kept
confidential and those who felt the female
students filing charges were not treated
respectfully.
"We need a definite statement with defi
nite procedural information," said Switzer.
"In the past it hasn't been easy to get infor
mation on what to do if you think you have
been sexually harassed."
Because the current procedure for filing
a grievance contains a number of ambigui
ties, the committee from the dean's office is
currently "trying to make a procedure with
in the medical center that is user-friendly,"
said Assoc. Dean and committee chair
Charlotte Jacobs.
One solution under consideration is the
creation of a sexual harassment panel that
would "serve as faculty and students' first
line resource," according to committee
member Melissa Parisi.
The creation of such a panel is sug
gested in recent guidelines published by
the American Medical Association for
combating sexual harassment at medical
schools.
"The panel would include two levels of
mechanisms for dealing with formal and
non-formal charges," said Parisi, who also
emphasized the need for panel members to
be trained in harassment issues.
"[Panel members] must understand and
know what is entailed in sexual harass
ment," said Parisi. "They need to know what
to expect," especially since members must
keep their work confidential and will not be
able to confer with individuals outside the
panel about the cases.
Along with clarifying the procedure,
Switzer said the Medical School also needs
to establish an "advocacy program for
female students. It was my observation that

the women in the ongoing sexual harass
ment case weren't treated with a lot of
respect. We need to have someone who can
be an advocate for the students throughout
the process."
Switzer suggested that Susan Epstein,
the University's new student coordinator of
sexual assault prevention, education and
response might be able to fill that advocacy
position.
The Perlroth case was investigated by
an ad hoc committee organized through
the dean's office. Although people were
generally satisfied with the committee's
handling of the case, concern has been
voiced that a more permanent structure
should be established to conduct such

investigations.
However, Assoc. Dean and
Committee Chair Robert Cutler said a
Eermanent committee was not practical
ecause personal friendships could
interfere with a committee member's
evaluation of a co-worker. For this rea
son, he believes it is necessary that for
each individual case an ad hoc commit
tee be formed, comprised of individuals
who are not connected to the alleged
perpetrator and can provide unbiased
opinions.
Cutler also stressed that the primary
consideration in choosing individuals for
such a committee is their investigative
capabilities.
But Mills objects to the use of ad hoc
committees because the members are uned
ucated on the subject of sexual harassment
and are thus unqualified.
"The (Perlroth) investigation was placed
in the hands of people with absolutely no
experience and that is absolutely unaccept
able," he said.
University efforts are primarily
focused on the revision of state
ments and procedures; however,
most people feel it will take far more than a
change in policy to alleviate sexism in the
Medical School.
"The main thing is to maintain an active,
open dialogue about what behavior is
allowed and what isn't," said Conley. "It's
not a female problem, it's not a male prob
lem. It's a societal problem. And the only
way to tackle it is [to allow for open discus
sion.]"
Conlcy's call for open dialogue between
men and women was echoed by many oth
ers, including men who are anxious to get
involved in the issues.

"Many people have turned their atten
tion to the harassment code, which is great,"
said medical student Lee Sanders. "But my
concern is with involving men in the dia
logue. Fifteen years ago sexism was consid
ered a women's issue, but I just think that's
the wrong way of looking at it."
"All of us want to be sensitive co-work
ers in the future," Sanders said. "What I'd
like to see happen is for the Medical School
to set up opportunities for students and
house staff to engage in facilitated discus
sion" involving issues that concern every
one.
And while most individuals agree that
educational efforts are necessary if signifi
cant changes are to be effected in the

Medical School, differences
surface over whether educa
tional workshops — on gen
der and cultural sensitivity —
should be required of faculty,
staff and/or students.
"Ideally — you know in a
fantasy world — it would be a
requirement for everyone
involved" in the Medical
Center to receive some sort of
educational program on gen
der sensitivity, said Parisi. She
added that it would probably
be too difficult to institute
such a program.
Sanders agreed, saying, "It
would be difficult to require
anything else of med stu
dents," but he suggested that
such workshops could be
offered as one- or two-credit
courses for students.
As for faculty, Sanders
said, "Professors are the
roughest issue, but one that
doesn't warrant too much
focus" because they tend to be
set in their ways. Sanders
added that educational efforts
should be focused on the
"next generation."
But Mills disagreed, saying
educational programs are nec
essary for the entire Medical
Center community.
If Stanford is "to maintain
its claim of creating leaders —
it must set the standards....
The administration should
call in a consultant to create a
mandatory training program
for faculty, staff and stu
dents," said Mills. He pointed
out that most major corpora
tions, such as Xerox and
Hewlett-Packard, have al
ready successfully integrated

sensitivity workshops into
training programs for their managerial
staffs.
Shortliffe also said she views education
as an important aspect of combating sexism,
and believes businesses are "way ahead of
the university" in this regard.
While many students agreed that they
would like to require sensitivity workshops
for faculty members, most felt the idea sim
ply wasn't feasible — that professors would
resent being forced to attend them. Many
professors agree.
"Professors hate being forced to do any
thing," and they will resent having to attend
workshops, said Conley.
Conley went on to point out that
"whether or not educational efforts will
work depend on the quality of the work
shop. A mediocre program won't reach
intellectual elite; a mediocre program will
be like going to traffic school," she said.
Unsatisfied with the idea of merely
revising policy, many people are
now looking to the University for a
stronger statement, seeing the current con
troversy as an ideal forum for institutional
change and growth.
"I'd like to see vision from the top," said
Sanders, who thinks the administration
should take this opportunity not to deny
that we have any problems here but to
embrace the changes that are occurring in
the demographics of medicine.
"A dean should come out at Orientation
and speak about the things that individuals
of different backgrounds are bringing to the
face of medicine," said Sanders .
"The dean should excite us about enter
ing the changing face of medicine. That's the
kind of leadership Stanford needs," he said.

Two committees
have been estab

Medical School to
consider the issues
of sexual harass

committee of the
School of

to expect," especially since members must
keep their work confidential and will not be
able to confer with individuals outside the
panel about the cases.
Along with clarifying the procedure,
Switzer said the Medical School also needs
to establish an "advocacy program for
female students. It was my observation that

the women in the ongoing sexual harass
ment case weren't treated with a lot of
respect. We need to have someone who can
be an advocate for the students throughout
the process."
Switzer suggested that Susan Epstein,
the University's new student coordinator of
sexual assault prevention, education and
response might be able to fill that advocacy
position.
The Perlroth case was investigated by
an ad hoc committee organized through
the dean's office. Although people were
generally satisfied with the committee's
handling of the case, concern has been
voiced that a more permanent structure
should be established to conduct such

investigations.
However, Assoc. Dean and
Committee Chair Robert Cutler said a
Eermanent committee was not practical
ecause personal friendships could
interfere with a committee member's
evaluation of a co-worker. For this rea
son, he believes it is necessary that for
each individual case an ad hoc commit
tee be formed, comprised of individuals
who are not connected to the alleged
perpetrator and can provide unbiased
opinions.
Cutler also stressed that the primary
consideration in choosing individuals for
such a committee is their investigative
capabilities.
But Mills objects to the use of ad hoc
committees because the members are uned
ucated on the subject of sexual harassment
and are thus unqualified.
"The (Perlroth) investigation was placed
in the hands of people with absolutely no
experience and that is absolutely unaccept
able," he said.
University efforts are primarily
focused on the revision of state
ments and procedures; however,
most people feel it will take far more than a
change in policy to alleviate sexism in the
Medical School.
"The main thing is to maintain an active,
open dialogue about what behavior is
allowed and what isn't," said Conley. "It's
not a female problem, it's not a male prob
lem. It's a societal problem. And the only
way to tackle it is [to allow for open discus
sion.]"
Conlcy's call for open dialogue between
men and women was echoed by many oth
ers, including men who are anxious to get
involved in the issues.

"Many people have turned their atten
tion to the harassment code, which is great,"
said medical student Lee Sanders. "But my
concern is with involving men in the dia
logue. Fifteen years ago sexism was consid
ered a women's issue, but I just think that's
the wrong way of looking at it."
"All of us want to be sensitive co-work
ers in the future," Sanders said. "What I'd
like to see happen is for the Medical School
to set up opportunities for students and
house staff to engage in facilitated discus
sion" involving issues that concern every
one.
And while most individuals agree that
educational efforts are necessary if signifi
cant changes are to be effected in the

Medical School, differences
surface over whether educa
tional workshops — on gen
der and cultural sensitivity —
should be required of faculty,
staff and/or students.
"Ideally — you know in a
fantasy world — it would be a
requirement for everyone
involved" in the Medical
Center to receive some sort of
educational program on gen
der sensitivity, said Parisi. She
added that it would probably
be too difficult to institute
such a program.
Sanders agreed, saying, "It
would be difficult to require
anything else of med stu
dents," but he suggested that
such workshops could be
offered as one- or two-credit
courses for students.
As for faculty, Sanders
said, "Professors are the
roughest issue, but one that
doesn't warrant too much
focus" because they tend to be
set in their ways. Sanders
added that educational efforts
should be focused on the
"next generation."
But Mills disagreed, saying
educational programs are nec
essary for the entire Medical
Center community.
If Stanford is "to maintain
its claim of creating leaders —
it must set the standards....
The administration should
call in a consultant to create a
mandatory training program
for faculty, staff and stu
dents," said Mills. He pointed
out that most major corpora
tions, such as Xerox and
Hewlett-Packard, have al
ready successfully integrated

sensitivity workshops into
training programs for their managerial
staffs.
Shortliffe also said she views education
as an important aspect of combating sexism,
and believes businesses are "way ahead of
the university" in this regard.
While many students agreed that they
would like to require sensitivity workshops
for faculty members, most felt the idea sim
ply wasn't feasible — that professors would
resent being forced to attend them. Many
professors agree.
"Professors hate being forced to do any
thing," and they will resent having to attend
workshops, said Conley.
Conley went on to point out that
"whether or not educational efforts will
work depend on the quality of the work
shop. A mediocre program won't reach
intellectual elite; a mediocre program will
be like going to traffic school," she said.
Unsatisfied with the idea of merely
revising policy, many people are
now looking to the University for a
stronger statement, seeing the current con
troversy as an ideal forum for institutional
change and growth.
"I'd like to see vision from the top," said
Sanders, who thinks the administration
should take this opportunity not to deny
that we have any problems here but to
embrace the changes that are occurring in
the demographics of medicine.
"A dean should come out at Orientation
and speak about the things that individuals
of different backgrounds are bringing to the
face of medicine," said Sanders .
"The dean should excite us about enter
ing the changing face of medicine. That's the
kind of leadership Stanford needs," he said.

Frances Conley's
resignation last
month brought the
Issue of sexism at
the Medical School
Into the national
media, as well as
under the micro
scope of committees
and Individuals
pushing for reform.
Despite these Inten

skeptical about
progress. "I've been
here too long," she
says.


Medical school students Melissa Paris), left,
and Julie Switzer, hold "Gray's Anatomy," a
standard textbook that epitomizes a subtle
form of sexism in their field. Examples in the
book, as well as in other sources, consistent
ly use a 70-kilogram male rather than a
lighter female.


Second-year medical school student Julie Seavello says sexual
harassment is an insult to medicine. Seavello, who has a one-year
old son, says her love for Stanford makes her want to heal the
wounds of harassment.
