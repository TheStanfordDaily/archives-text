## Column The 						wild, wild West 
### 
Fans in six states across the
nation can already see it.
Though there are still 70
games left in the season, it is
apparent that a six-team race is
shaping up in the American
League West that could go
down as one of the best in the
history of the game.
For the last few years, the
division belonged to the A's.
Oakland merely had to trot out
the big bats and the endless
bullpen, sit back, relax and
waltz into the playoffs.
But the A's have been
betrayed this season by medi
ocrity among their starting
pitcher, dismal relief and
injuries to Carney Lansford
and Walt Weiss.
What's bad news for Oak
land is, of course, good news
for everyone from Seattle to
Chicago to Arlington, Texas.
Each of the six teams in con
tention is somehow flawed,
which should prevent anyone
from pulling too far in front
and turning the race into a
rout.
Front-running Minnesota,
which ran off a remarkable 15-
game winning streak, wasn't
supposed to contend at all this
season, according to the pun
dits. What no one knew in
April, though, was that Scott
Erickson would have a a first
half worth of a Cy Young
Award.
But Erickson recently came
off the disabled list and has
been quite mortal since. If he
returns to form, Erickson joins
the resurgent Jack Morris and
the gifted Kevin Tapani to form
a big three worthy of any team
in the bigs.
While Rick Aguilera hasn't
been a dominant closer, he's
done the job most of the time.
But the T\vins could still use a
lift and may get one from left
hander David West. Recently
recalled from the minors, West
has a world of talent but a dis
astrous major-league record to
date.
As always, Minnesota's
offense is led by Kirby "God, I
love this game" Puckett. But a
key has been third baseman
Mike Pagliarulo, who is having
a career season. The T\vins
have filled the void left by Gary
Gaetti.
Texas has been nipping at
Minnesota's heels after holding
first place briefly earlier in the
year. The Rangers will not win
it on the strength of there start
ing pitching. Even Nolan Ryan,
who continues to amaze, has
not been a consistent winner.
What the Rangers do have is
an unbelievable offense.
Rafael Palmeiro, Ruben Sierra
and Julio Franco earn their
paychecks by producing any
time and all the time. Sierra, he
of the leg kick on his swing,
seems destined to wind up in
Cooperstown someday. The
question is: Can he guide the
Rangers to the promised land
along the way?
One Stanford note on Texas:
Third baseman Steve Buechele,
a Cardinal product, is, like
Pagliarulo, having the season of
his life.
The White Sox chased the
A's almost down to the wire last
season. After a slow start, they
seemed poised to do it again.

Perhaps the biggest reason is
another Stanford connection
— pitcher Jack McDowell.
Sporting an 11-4 record and
3.06 ERA, McDowell is one of
the league's best and certainly
the Sox' most consistent win
ner. If he can keep up the pace.
Chicago has a shot.
Frank Thomas is establish
ing himself as one of the best
young sluggers in the game and
Robin Ventura has shown signs
of coming around despite the
influence of Walt Hriniak.
Chicago's hitting coach,
Hriniak believes everyone
should hit the same way —
swing down, hit through the
middle, let go of the bat with
one hand.
It's ugly and of dubious
merit, especially for Ventura,
whose sweet swing led to a 58-
game hitting streak in college.
(A streak stopped, incidentally,
by none other than McDowell.
Carlton Fisk provides the vet
eran leadership and Scott
Fletcher combines with Ozzie
Guillen to form an airtight
middle infield for the Sox.
California was given the best
chance to stop the A's early in
the season. Though they've
stumbled of late, don't count
out these wily veterans.
The return to prominence of
Dave Winfield proves that you
just can't keep a good man
down. Despite George Stein
brenner's attempts to ruin the
man's life, Winfield, as he will
gladly point out, is still in the
game and George — well —
isn't.
Wally Joyner, too, has recap
tured the magic that made him
one of the most promising first
basemen in the league during
the middle and late '80s. But it
would be foolish to discount
the importance of some lesser
known players.
Luis Polonia, who still can't
field to save his life, provides
steady offense and speed on
the base paths. The guy may be
a bum, but at least he's a bum
who can hit big-league pitch
ing. Dick Schofield still does
his job well, and quietly, at
short.
But the Angels strong suit is
their "Fab Four" of Mark
Langston, Chuck Finley, Jim
Abbott and Kirk McCaskill.
The quartet forms a great four
man rotation. Unfortunately,
most hurlers these days need
the extra day's rest. (Aside: Oh
to return to the days of Charles
"Old Hoss" Radbourne, who
once pitched the last 27 games
of the season — and won 26 of
them.)

getting a Mariners hat to avoid

A's almost down to the wire last
season. After a slow start, they
seemed poised to do it again.

Perhaps the biggest reason is
another Stanford connection
— pitcher Jack McDowell.
Sporting an 11-4 record and
3.06 ERA, McDowell is one of
the league's best and certainly
the Sox' most consistent win
ner. If he can keep up the pace.
Chicago has a shot.
Frank Thomas is establish
ing himself as one of the best
young sluggers in the game and
Robin Ventura has shown signs
of coming around despite the
influence of Walt Hriniak.
Chicago's hitting coach,
Hriniak believes everyone
should hit the same way —
swing down, hit through the
middle, let go of the bat with
one hand.
It's ugly and of dubious
merit, especially for Ventura,
whose sweet swing led to a 58-
game hitting streak in college.
(A streak stopped, incidentally,
by none other than McDowell.
Carlton Fisk provides the vet
eran leadership and Scott
Fletcher combines with Ozzie
Guillen to form an airtight
middle infield for the Sox.
California was given the best
chance to stop the A's early in
the season. Though they've
stumbled of late, don't count
out these wily veterans.
The return to prominence of
Dave Winfield proves that you
just can't keep a good man
down. Despite George Stein
brenner's attempts to ruin the
man's life, Winfield, as he will
gladly point out, is still in the
game and George — well —
isn't.
Wally Joyner, too, has recap
tured the magic that made him
one of the most promising first
basemen in the league during
the middle and late '80s. But it
would be foolish to discount
the importance of some lesser
known players.
Luis Polonia, who still can't
field to save his life, provides
steady offense and speed on
the base paths. The guy may be
a bum, but at least he's a bum
who can hit big-league pitch
ing. Dick Schofield still does
his job well, and quietly, at
short.
But the Angels strong suit is
their "Fab Four" of Mark
Langston, Chuck Finley, Jim
Abbott and Kirk McCaskill.
The quartet forms a great four
man rotation. Unfortunately,
most hurlers these days need
the extra day's rest. (Aside: Oh
to return to the days of Charles
"Old Hoss" Radbourne, who
once pitched the last 27 games
of the season — and won 26 of
them.)

Fans in six states across the
nation can already see it.
Though there are still 70
games left in the season, it is
apparent that a six-team race is
shaping up in the American
League West that could go
down as one of the best in the
history of the game.
For the last few years, the
division belonged to the A's.
Oakland merely had to trot out
the big bats and the endless
bullpen, sit back, relax and
waltz into the playoffs.
But the A's have been
betrayed this season by medi
ocrity among their starting
pitcher, dismal relief and
injuries to Carney Lansford
and Walt Weiss.
What's bad news for Oak
land is, of course, good news
for everyone from Seattle to
Chicago to Arlington, Texas.
Each of the six teams in con
tention is somehow flawed,
which should prevent anyone
from pulling too far in front
and turning the race into a
rout.
Front-running Minnesota,
which ran off a remarkable 15-
game winning streak, wasn't
supposed to contend at all this
season, according to the pun
dits. What no one knew in
April, though, was that Scott
Erickson would have a a first
half worth of a Cy Young
Award.
But Erickson recently came
off the disabled list and has
been quite mortal since. If he
returns to form, Erickson joins
the resurgent Jack Morris and
the gifted Kevin Tapani to form
a big three worthy of any team
in the bigs.
While Rick Aguilera hasn't
been a dominant closer, he's
done the job most of the time.
But the T\vins could still use a
lift and may get one from left
hander David West. Recently
recalled from the minors, West
has a world of talent but a dis
astrous major-league record to
date.
As always, Minnesota's
offense is led by Kirby "God, I
love this game" Puckett. But a
key has been third baseman
Mike Pagliarulo, who is having
a career season. The T\vins
have filled the void left by Gary
Gaetti.
Texas has been nipping at
Minnesota's heels after holding
first place briefly earlier in the
year. The Rangers will not win
it on the strength of there start
ing pitching. Even Nolan Ryan,
who continues to amaze, has
not been a consistent winner.
What the Rangers do have is
an unbelievable offense.
Rafael Palmeiro, Ruben Sierra
and Julio Franco earn their
paychecks by producing any
time and all the time. Sierra, he
of the leg kick on his swing,
seems destined to wind up in
Cooperstown someday. The
question is: Can he guide the
Rangers to the promised land
along the way?
One Stanford note on Texas:
Third baseman Steve Buechele,
a Cardinal product, is, like
Pagliarulo, having the season of
his life.
The White Sox chased the
A's almost down to the wire last
season. After a slow start, they
seemed poised to do it again.

Perhaps the biggest reason is
another Stanford connection
