# O'Brien makes point at Pilot Pen
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
No one will confuse the Pilot
Pen Open with a Grand Slam
tournament and no one will con
fuse senior Alex O'Brien with one
of the world's top players, yet, but
together the two seemed made for
each other last weekend in New
Haven, Conn.
O'Brien, who got into the
$50,000 tournament as a qualifier,
defeated Frenchman Stephane
Simian, 6-4, 6-4 Sunday to take
the title on the Yale campus.
The top prize in the event was
$7,200, which O'Brien declined in
order to retain his amateur status.
NCAA rules permit athletes to
keep only enough winnings to
cover their expenses for attending
the tournament. Before leaving
Stanford in June, O'Brien said he

intended to return for his senior
season.
O'Brien reached the finals by
defeating Steve Bryan of Katy,
Texas, in the semis, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.
Bryan reached the final four with
a defeat of former Stanford star
Martin Blackman, by a score of 6-
4, 6-2. In the quarterfinals,
O'Brien downed Sandor Noszaly
of Hungary, 6-2, 6-3.
Women's update
This week, the big tennis news
is on the women's side, as Sandra
Birch and Debbie Graham both
played at the Pathmark Classic in
Mahwah, N.J.
Graham won a first-round
match Monday, defeating Vin
cenza Procacci of Yardley, Pa. 6-3,
6-0. Tuesday, Birch rallied to
defeat Penny Barg-Mager 0-6, 7-6

(7-5), 6-2. The day before she was
named the Tennis Magazine/
Colvo Tennis College Women's
Player of the Year.
In yesterday's second round,
former UCLA star Jessica
Emmons beat Graham 6-3, 6-2.
San Francisco's Peanut Harper
eliminated Birch 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
The Pathmark event includes
28 players but is not an officially
sanctioned Women's Tennis Asso
ciation tournament. Because it is
essentially an exhibition, wins do
not count toward the WTA rank
ings.
But for both Graham and
Birch, that matters only in the
long term. Both will be able to
play at U.S. Open in Flushing
Meadows, N.Y., in late August.
Graham gets in by virtue of a
world ranking just over 100 and
Birch received a wild card.
