Keefe to Cuba?
Senior Adam Keefe is one of 16
players vying for 12 spots on the
basketball team that will repre
sent the United States at the Pan
American Games in Cuba early
next month.
Beginning yesterday, Purdue
coach Gene Ready assembled the
team for a series of practices
designed to find the best talent
and chemistry. The group, training
at the Purdue campus in West
Lafayette, Ind., will play an exhi
bition Sunday against an Indi
anapolis AAU team. They will
work out with the Canadian team
on July 23-24 and leave for
Havana on July 28.
Among others, Keefe is com
peting with Duke's Christian
Laettner at the power forward
spot.
Regional redux
Stanford will host the 1994

NCAA West Regional women's
basketball tournament, hoping, in
part, to rediscover the magic that
led to the University's only
national title back in 1990.
"We're delighted the commit
tee accepted our invitation to
come back to Stanford in '94,"
said Associated Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick. "No doubt our fan
support has made Stanford a
viable option in the eyes of the
NCAA committee."
The Cardinal hosted the
regional last year and went on to
take the NCAA crown. Stanford
has averaged well over 3,(XX) fans
per game over the past two sea
sons.
Merger mania
• The Pacific 10 Conference
was left out of a new alliance of
college bowls designed to guaran
tee a national championship game
each year. The Orange, Cotton,
Sugar and Fiesta bowls agreed to

arrange a game between the top
two teams in the nation on New
Year's Day. Five conferences —
the Big East, Atlantic Coast, Big
Eight, Southeastern and South
west — along with Notre Dame
are involved in the deal. The Pac
-10 champ will still meet the Big
Ten champ in the Rose Bowl.
• Sports Channel Bay Area and
the Pacific Sports Network have
merged to form Sports Channel
Pacific. Stanford basketball and
football games telesvised by PSN
will still be available free on the
new station. Warriors games, how
ever, will now be on pay-TV along
with the Giants and A's. The chan
nel, which costs $9.95, will be
unscrambled except when the pro
sports teams are on.
Sweet swim
•At Sheffield, England, swim
mer Karen Kraemer won the 200-
meter freestyle at the World Uni
versity Games. She swam a
2:02.23, her best time ever.
