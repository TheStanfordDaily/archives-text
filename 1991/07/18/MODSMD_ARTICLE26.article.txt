## where the wild things are 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
In the month since graduation, I have
learned a remarkable amount — per
haps more than in my four years of
collcgc. I've learned that the job market is
as bad as everyone said, that my parents
did mean it when they said I had to sup
port myself and that money doesn 't grow
on trees. (I've looked.)
I've also learned that youth is wasted
on the young.
Well, maybe not completely wasted,
but it's true, you do appreciate many
"childish" things more as an adult (which
they tell me I now am). Like Slinkies, Silly
Putty and stuffed animals.
And the zoo.
I remember not wanting to go to the
zoo when I was young because "We
already went there this year!" 1 remember
not wanting to go to the zoo because "The
animals don't do anything!" I remember
not wanting to go to the zoo because "I'd
rather go to the mall."
What an idiot I was.
The San Francisco Zoological Society
(which is the fancy name for the zoo in the
Citv) is now one of my favorite places to
go. Why? Well ~ .
The bears: Big brown bears, big white
polar bears and little spectacled bears.
Granted, they don't often do much but
sleep, but occasionally you'll catch them
playing in their pool. And, if you're really
lucky, you'll get to sec them being fed. You
may never go camping again.
the gorillas: These guys arc a riot! A
family of about five or six, the gorillas live
in a large area full of trees, rocks and
grass. And burlap bags — they love burlap
bags. I'm not sure why. No one is. Vou can
watch these (alleged) ancestors of ours
fight, play, sleep and eat. It's almost like a
live episode of "Roseanne," but better.
And cuter.

The penguins: I used to think the pen
guins were incredibly stupid because they
wandered around in circles and walked
into glass partitions. However, since
they've gotten their new homes, the pen
guins have shown much more intelligence.
Each penguin couple (penguins arc
monogamous, you know) has its own hut,
complete with a front porch. As my friend
said. "I think the extra responsibility was
just what they needed." Maybe we should
try this with my little sister.
The cats: Not the meowing kind, but
the roaring kind. These animals appear to
be some of the least comfortable at the
zoo; they're all in cages that seem far too
small for their bodies, lint they seem
happy anyway. I guess. I'm not really sure
how you can tell if a lion is happy,
The capybaras: Never heard of these,
have you? Neither had I. The world's
largest rodent, the Capvbara looks like a
giant rat without a tail. Gives you an idea
of what may someday happen in the New
York City sewer systems.
The koalas: My personal favorite. The
koala is not much to watch, since it sleeps
20 hours a day, waking only to eat. (I'm so
jealous.) Every once in a while, though,
you'll get to sec one do something really
cool. Like move, for instance.
The hedgehogs: You can't actually see
them yet; they're still in incubation. How
ever, I've , seen a picture of one, and
they're destined to be a key feature of the
zoo. Trust me. I'm an expert.
The mountain goats: Big fur balls.
With legs and horns. Thcv make you crave
fondue.
The slow loris: If you've never seen
one, you have to go. Now. This monkey
like animal is nocturnal and moves v-c-r-y
s-l-o-w-l-y. Hence, its name. But it's got to
be seen to be believed.
The children's zoo: For just $1, you can
pet, feed and play with the animals (some
of them). You can also try to feed your sis-

i
ter to. the animals, but the employees
aren't too keen on that. Seems the ani
mals are on special diets. Oh well.
The carousel: True, it costs a little extra
(75 cents), but it's a carousel. Need I say
more? t
The seagulls: They're not actually a zoo
exhibit, but they're one of the most visible
attractions there. The seagulls are primar
ily located near the snack bars where they
swoop down and swallow your htit dogs.
Whole. Really. It's pretty amazing.
The San Francisco Zoo also has vari
ous programs going on all year. For exam
ple, you can have breakfast with the koala
keeper or lunch with the pachyderms.'
And on Valentine's Day — I'm not joking
here — you can take a tour and learn
about the "birds and bees" at the zoo. Use
your imagination.
But here's the best part: For just 535
you can become a zoo member. This
means that you get unlimited free admis
sion, two passes to the children's zoo. dis
counts on all the tours and a subscription
to "Zoo Views." the zoo's magazine. And
a really cool Animal Express card.
For an additional $10 you can join as a
family, which entitles you to all of the
above plus unlimited free admission to
the children's zoo and two free carousel
passes. I'd say it's worth the extra cash,
wouldn't you? Especially because if you
join as a family, you get the title of "Hon
orary Zoo Keeper." Pretty impressive.
But wait, there's more. If and only if
you become a member, you can take a
night tour. This is when they open the zoo
after hours and let you feed the giraffes
and the rhinos and walk behind the bear
grotto. There's a barbecue and entertain
ment and lots of fun stuff. It's so exciting,
I can't begin to tell you. 1 mean that.
The San Francisco Zoological Society is
open seven days a week, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

already went there this year!" 1 remember
not wanting to go to the zoo because "The
animals don't do anything!" I remember
not wanting to go to the zoo because "I'd
rather go to the mall."
What an idiot I was.
The San Francisco Zoological Society
(which is the fancy name for the zoo in the
Citv) is now one of my favorite places to
go. Why? Well ~ .
The bears: Big brown bears, big white
polar bears and little spectacled bears.
Granted, they don't often do much but
sleep, but occasionally you'll catch them
playing in their pool. And, if you're really
lucky, you'll get to sec them being fed. You
may never go camping again.
the gorillas: These guys arc a riot! A
family of about five or six, the gorillas live
in a large area full of trees, rocks and
grass. And burlap bags — they love burlap
bags. I'm not sure why. No one is. Vou can
watch these (alleged) ancestors of ours
fight, play, sleep and eat. It's almost like a
live episode of "Roseanne," but better.
And cuter.

The penguins: I used to think the pen
guins were incredibly stupid because they
wandered around in circles and walked
into glass partitions. However, since
they've gotten their new homes, the pen
guins have shown much more intelligence.
Each penguin couple (penguins arc
monogamous, you know) has its own hut,
complete with a front porch. As my friend
said. "I think the extra responsibility was
just what they needed." Maybe we should
try this with my little sister.
The cats: Not the meowing kind, but
the roaring kind. These animals appear to
be some of the least comfortable at the
zoo; they're all in cages that seem far too
small for their bodies, lint they seem
happy anyway. I guess. I'm not really sure
how you can tell if a lion is happy,
The capybaras: Never heard of these,
have you? Neither had I. The world's
largest rodent, the Capvbara looks like a
giant rat without a tail. Gives you an idea
of what may someday happen in the New
York City sewer systems.
The koalas: My personal favorite. The
koala is not much to watch, since it sleeps
20 hours a day, waking only to eat. (I'm so
jealous.) Every once in a while, though,
you'll get to sec one do something really
cool. Like move, for instance.
The hedgehogs: You can't actually see
them yet; they're still in incubation. How
ever, I've , seen a picture of one, and
they're destined to be a key feature of the
zoo. Trust me. I'm an expert.
The mountain goats: Big fur balls.
With legs and horns. Thcv make you crave
fondue.
The slow loris: If you've never seen
one, you have to go. Now. This monkey
like animal is nocturnal and moves v-c-r-y
s-l-o-w-l-y. Hence, its name. But it's got to
be seen to be believed.
The children's zoo: For just $1, you can
pet, feed and play with the animals (some
of them). You can also try to feed your sis-

i
ter to. the animals, but the employees
aren't too keen on that. Seems the ani
mals are on special diets. Oh well.
The carousel: True, it costs a little extra
(75 cents), but it's a carousel. Need I say
more? t
The seagulls: They're not actually a zoo
exhibit, but they're one of the most visible
attractions there. The seagulls are primar
ily located near the snack bars where they
swoop down and swallow your htit dogs.
Whole. Really. It's pretty amazing.
The San Francisco Zoo also has vari
ous programs going on all year. For exam
ple, you can have breakfast with the koala
keeper or lunch with the pachyderms.'
And on Valentine's Day — I'm not joking
here — you can take a tour and learn
about the "birds and bees" at the zoo. Use
your imagination.
But here's the best part: For just 535
you can become a zoo member. This
means that you get unlimited free admis
sion, two passes to the children's zoo. dis
counts on all the tours and a subscription
to "Zoo Views." the zoo's magazine. And
a really cool Animal Express card.
For an additional $10 you can join as a
family, which entitles you to all of the
above plus unlimited free admission to
the children's zoo and two free carousel
passes. I'd say it's worth the extra cash,
wouldn't you? Especially because if you
join as a family, you get the title of "Hon
orary Zoo Keeper." Pretty impressive.
But wait, there's more. If and only if
you become a member, you can take a
night tour. This is when they open the zoo
after hours and let you feed the giraffes
and the rhinos and walk behind the bear
grotto. There's a barbecue and entertain
ment and lots of fun stuff. It's so exciting,
I can't begin to tell you. 1 mean that.
The San Francisco Zoological Society is
open seven days a week, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
For more information, call 753-7080.

In the month since graduation, I have
learned a remarkable amount — per
haps more than in my four years of
collcgc. I've learned that the job market is
as bad as everyone said, that my parents
did mean it when they said I had to sup
port myself and that money doesn 't grow
on trees. (I've looked.)
I've also learned that youth is wasted
on the young.
Well, maybe not completely wasted,
but it's true, you do appreciate many
"childish" things more as an adult (which
they tell me I now am). Like Slinkies, Silly
Putty and stuffed animals.
And the zoo.
