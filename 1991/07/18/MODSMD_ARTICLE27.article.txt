## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Faye Carol fills a stage with her energy,
charisma and wonderful musicality, not to
mention her fingernails, each more than an
inch long. She is an entertainer, a vibrant
personality who specializes in relating to
her audience, allowing them to share in her
passion for music and feel the excitement
she feels while singing.
Carol is a highly versatile singer of jazz,
blues and soul, performing everything from
the classic standards of Cole Porter to T-
Bone Walker blues to Billy Joel's "New
York State of Mind."
"I don't like labels," she says. "I'd like to
be known as a damn good singer. Then you
can call me anything else you want."
During her more than 25 years as a per
former, it seems that Carol has appeared in
every kind of venue: black nightclubs, gay
clubs, upper-crust parties, county jails, and
everything from nightclubs to concert halls
while on tour in Germany.
In her first performance at Stanford,
through the Stanford Jazz Workshop's
Summer Jazz Series, Carol hopes to reach
yet another audience: college communities.
A dynamic talent and warm personality, she
is sure to be well received.
A Berkeley resident, Carol has strong
ties to the Bay Area. Although many have
encouraged her to leave and seek a more

national profile, Carol only cares about
being able to share her music with audi
ences who appreciate it, and she feels she
has that in the Bay Area.
"The Leaning Tower of Pisa don't get up
and go no place. People go to it. As long as
I'm here and I can still be heard ... it's the
same thing to me," she says.
As winner of three Cabaret Gold Out
standing Jazz Vocalist Awards, Carol is
considered one of the finest blues and jazz
performers around.
In addition to Carol's singing, tomor
row's concert will also feature her daughter,
Kito Gamble, on piano as well as saxophon
ist Joshi Marshall. At 19, Gamble is a
remarkably skilled pianist, while Marshall,
20, blows a surprisingly mature saxophone.
The two have been performing with Carol
for several years and are featured as
soloists in her show.
Born in Meridian, Miss., Carol came to
Pittsburg, Calif, with her family at age 10.
After attending Mt. Diablo College she
decided to become a professional per
former and has been singing up a storm all
over the Bay Area ever since.

"The Dynamic Miss Faye Carol and her
Quartet, featuring Kito Gamble" performs
tomorrow at Bp.m. in Campbell Recital Hall.
Tickets are $10/$8 students. Call 723-4317
