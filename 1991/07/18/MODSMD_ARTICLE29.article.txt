# Composers use computers to make sweet music under the stars

### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Yee On Lo, in describing his
musical composition for com
puter-generated tape, "River
Through Time," writes, "The
approach is realized in a program
which uses four types of data
objects: a motion file which
describes timbral variation at all
levels ... a list of timbral frames;
a global amplitude function; and a
period trajectory (encoding pitch
and fine timbral information.)"
Are these really program notes
for a concert? They are indeed,
and they're from the program for

tonight's computer music festival
presented by Stanford's Center
for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics.
This intellectually challenging,
yet expressive form of music has
become the main focus of many
remarkable, innovative musicians.
Although highly technical, it
retains the sensitive, expressive
nature of traditional music. The
pieces deal with the experience of
being human and the state of our
modern, global society, and the
composers seek to use this new
technical medium to broaden the
range of what can be expressed.
Mari Kimura, one artist per

forming tonight, says her picce,
"U (The Cormorant)," is a
response to her "constant feeling
of urgency about the global envi
ronment."
Yet another piece, Gareth
Loy's "Nekyia," derives its name
from the 11th chapter of Homer's
"The Odyssey" and deals with
images of enchantment and dae
monic confrontation.
Loy holds a doctorate in com
position from Stanford and is cur
rently a computer music re
searcher at UCâ€”San Diego and a
senior audio software engineer.
Kimura, a Japanese violinist, is
only 16 years old, but holds a mas

ter's degree in performance from
Boston University and is currently
pursuing a doctorate at Juilliard.
While this technological form
of music is different and challeng
ing, it is not outside the realm of
what constitutes music. The con
cert promises to be more than just
a display of randomly organized
computer sound tricks. These
technical artists, as Kimura states,
are "stepping out from the usual
boundary extending the aural
experience into an unknown
dimension."
Among the other composers
featured in tonight's concert are
Daniel V. Oppenheim of Jeru

salem, holder of degrees in music
theory and composition from the
Rubin Academies in Jerusalem
and Tel-Aviv and past teacher of
electroacoustic music; and Argen
tinean Mario Davidovsky, profes
sor of music at Columbia Univer
sity and a 1971 Pulitzer Prize-win
ner for his composition, "Synchro
nisms 6."

The Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics presents its
annual outdoor computer music
festival tonight at 8:15 p.m., Frost
Amphitheatre. Gates open at 7p.m.
for picnicking. Tickets are $7/$4
students. Call 723-4317.
