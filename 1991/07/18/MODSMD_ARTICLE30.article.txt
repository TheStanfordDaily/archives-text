# S.F. whodunit

### Raphe Beck 
A detective begins the second
act of "Bar None" with a claim to
instill fear in the hearts of the
other characters. He insists he has
a witness who saw every detail of
the murder that took place in Act
1. Then the house lights come on.
"You are my witnesses," he says
directly to the audience, and what
began as traditional theater
becomes an improvisational inves
tigation where almost anything is
possible. The results are hilarious.
"Bar None," now in its third
year of performance at the Cable
Car Theatre, is a different show
every night. There are as many
possible endings as there are char
acters in this comical whodunit,
which features audience interac
tion as an integral part of the per
formance.
The action takes place late at
night in a San Francisco bar where
a group of extravagant people
convene to prepare for a political
assembly the next day. As one
character notes, the eclectic deco
rations make the bar look like
"Liberace on acid."
The characters themselves
could have been collected from
one of those How-to-Host-a-Mur
der dinner party games; everyone
has a motive and everyone has
something to hide. If "Twin
Peaks" had been set in the Bay
Area, this might have been the
result.
Co-writers Rich Baker and
Terry Ward, who sometimes grace

the stage as alternates for the
usual cast, say they wanted to
explore theater as a medium that
cannot be duplicated by film or
television. While the script is not
particularly subtle, it allows the
actors to do what they do best:
improvise.
At first, the audience is timid
and the detective's first question
goes unanswered. "This is not
cable," he demands. "I can see
you!"
A little playful interaction
warms them up. Martha, the lech
erous, "user-friendly," wife of the
bar owner, invites herself onto an
elderly man's lap. "Dump the
bimbo " she says referring to the
man's wife.

One audience member mis
takes a prop for a toy lamb, and
the actors have a field day with
lamb jokes, showing off their
quick wit in top form. When the
actor playing the deceased returns
in the guise of a policeman, the
audience protests. "Give me a
break," he says, "it's a goddamn
two-line walk-on!"
"Bar None" is a gem. It is the
successful crossbreed of script and
improvisation and is not to be
missed. Come ready to laugh.

Theatre, 430 Mason St., SF. Gen
