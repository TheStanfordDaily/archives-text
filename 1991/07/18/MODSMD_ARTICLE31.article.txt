'Dutch' is no treat
"Dutch," starring Ed O'Neill,
Ethan Randall and Joßeth Williams
Recently, a sneak preview of
"Dutch" was shown as a double
feature with "Dying Young," the
faltering Julia Roberts film. The
logic behind this marketing bril
liance escapes me, considering
"Dutch" will be lucky to draw big
ger audiences than "Dying
Young."
"Dutch" stars Ed O'Neill, bet
ter known as A 1 Bundy on TV's
"Married ... With Children." He
plays Dutch Dooley, the blue-col
iar boyfriend of Joßeth Williams,
who is divorced from the rich pig
who got her pregnant.
Williams' son, Doyle (Doyle?),
hates her. He's been brainwashed
by Daddy to be a stuck-up, hateful
little jerk, and he doesn't even
want to visit Mom at Thanksgiv
ing.
So good old Dutch offers to go
fetch the lad. And of course, the
down-to-earth goodness of the
working-stiff Dutch transforms
the kid into a paragon of virtue.
The movie has its moments; in
fact, it would best be described as
a hodgepodge of moments,
thrown together with no pacing or
any sense of transition. This film
feels like it's three hours long, but
only because it seems like four or
five different movies are happen
ing at once.
The film tries to set itself up as

a class conflict, much along the
lines of screenwriter/producer
John Hughes' earlier film,
"Planes, Trains and Automo
biles."
But whereas John Candy was a
lovable working stiff in that film,
Dutch comes across as nothing
more than a big bully who feels
insecure about his own wealth and
physical prowess.
Doyle, played by Ethan Ran
dall, is a wonderfully vicious viper
of a character, but his transforma
tion takes place in such fits and
starts that it's impossible to see
when or why he turns into such a
good-hearted young lad.
Is it when Dutch throws him
out of the car in the middle of the
night and forces him to walk for
miles in the snow to a motel?
Is it when Dutch refuses to buy
him breakfast to discipline him?
Or is it when they hitch a ride
with two hookers and Doyle falls
asleep drooling on one girl's
breasts?
Some of these moments have a
bit of humor to them, but all too
frequently, Dutch's acts smack of
child abuse, and laughing at them
seems a bit sick.
At times, the movie seems to be
catering to supposedly blue-collar
tastes by making fun of everything
about the rich. Doyle's cleanliness
and personal dignity are too often
portrayed as humorous faults.
The best thing that can be said
about "Dutch," however, is that it
sure makes "Dying Young" look
good. Perhaps this is what 20th
Century Fox had in mind the
whole time.
