A call for peace
"Boy/. N the Hood," starring Cuba
Gooding Jr., Ice Cube and Morris
Chestnut
The publicity surrounding
"Boyz N the Hood" could cause
you to miss a great film.
Maybe you've just seen the title
and heard that the movie features
rap artist Ice Cube ("Ameri-
KKKa's Most Wanted") in his act
ing debut. Admittedly, this might
not send you running to the the
ater.
Maybe you've seen the pre
views where a woman asks "Can't
we have one night where there
ain't no fight and nobody gets
shot?" right before Ice Cube's
character pulls a gun and shots
are heard.
It's almost as if studio execu
tives at Columbia Pictures didn't
believe people would come see a
film about blacks in South Central
Los Angeles unless it featured
violence rivaling that in "Termina
tor 2."
Or maybe you've read that over
30 people have been injured and
one person killed at screenings
across the country.
Some theaters have canceled
the film in fear of violence erupt
ing. Writer and director John Sin
gleton has called this "artistic
racism," and he is right. Violence
is the backdrop, not the focus of
"Boyz N the Hood," a beautiful
film about three young men com
ing of age.
At the center of the film is Tre
(Cuba Gooding Jr.), an intelligent
young man with a chance to go to
college and get out of a dangerous
community. He is contrasted with
his friends Ricky (Morris Chest
nut) and Doughboy (Ice Cube),
who are very different half-broth
ers. One is trying to use football as
a way into college, while the other
seems hopelessly lost in a world of
drugs and alcohol.
Unlike other movies about
young people trying to survive in

the ghetto ("Do the Right Thing,"
"Straight Out of Brooklyn"), this
is a film with answers. Almost
every five minutes another mes
sage is conveyed about survival.
Some of the messages are
familiar: Say no to drugs and yes
to condoms. But Singleton goes
deeper into the problems of South
Central.
In one scene Tre's father, Furi
ous Styles, played with great
integrity by Larry Fishburne

("King of New York," "School
Daze"), explains the idea of land
gcntrification to the boys. Unlike
Tre's mother, who has taken an
academic track out, Furious stays
in the neighborhood to help other
blacks finance their homes.
In this way the movie is com
plex, though it speaks with clarity.
"Boyz N the Hood" was one of
five American films screened at
this year's Cannes Film Festival
(Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever" was

another), and Singleton appears
to be a welcome addition to the
array of fresh, young filmmakers.
Singleton's work is inspiring
and uplifting, even with its tragic
turns. It makes one wonder why a
film with such positive messages
about growing up black was not
made sooner.
The answer may have some
thing to do with those Hollywood
executives. Prove them wrong,
and treat yourself to a wonderful
film with "Boyz N the Hood."

Give me a break
"Point Break," starring Patrick
Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Gary Busey
and Lori Petty
When I agreed to review "Point
Break," the new Patrick
Swayze/Keanu Reeves surfer
movie, I didn't think it would be
that hard to find someone to
accompany me. After all, I'm a
stunning conversationalist and a
witty companion. High society has
nothing on me; I can entertain
with the best of them. Besides, the
movie was free.
Little did I know.
"Forget it," said one friend.
"Like, no way dude," said
another.
"A movie about an FBI agent
going undercover as a surfer so he
can catch other surfers who exe
cute near-perfect bank robberies
in their spare time?" my last
attempt at a date said incredu
lously when I asked him. "That's a
joke, right?"
Sadly, it wasn't.
Well, it wasn't supposed to be.
But the movie was pretty funny.
Without trying to be. I should
have known better.
The first clue that "Point
Break" was going to be as ridicu
lous as it looked came with the
billboards — erected over a
month before the movie's debut.
They looked like Power Burst
ads. Every time I drove down U.S.
Highway 101,1 got thirsty.
Clue two came with the press
packet. Swayze plays a surfer
(OK, I can buy that) who calls
himself Bodhi — short for Bod

hisattva. For those of you who
have forgotten what you learned
in Western Culture (or Cultures,
Ideas and Values, as the case may
be), bodhisattva means "a person
who has achieved great moral and
spiritual wisdom and is a potential
Buddha."
A surfing Buddha? I can't buy
that.
Clue three, also from the press
packet (I know, you're thinking,
"If she got all these clues ahead of
time, why did she see the movie?"
I was wondering that myself.), was
Bodhi's "most important lesson":
If you want the ultimate thrill, you
have to be prepared to pay the
ultimate price.
This was, I believe, supposed to
be the theme of the film. I, how
ever, am pretty sure it's the slogan
for a BMW ad.
"Point Break," as you can prob
ably tell, was pretty pointless.
However, like all other truly bad
movies, it had its moments.
For example, hearing Reeves'
big-shot FBI boss call him "young,
dumb and full of cum" was pretty
entertaining, as was watching
Reeves jump out of an airplane
with no parachute in order to
tackle an escaping Swayze. In all
honesty, Reeves does a pretty
good job as the football-star
turned-FBI-agent who gets a little
too involved in his case. But good
acting can only take a dumb
premise so far.
And the true kudos for acting
go to Swayze. Even with long,
blond hair that makes him look
kind of foolish to begin with, he
manages to deliver lines like, "It's
not a sin to die doing what you
love" and "We reaffirm to those
people on the freeway in their
metal coffins that there is some
thing worth living for," without
cracking a smile. I know I couldn't
have done it. Heck, I'm smiling
just thinking about it.
In case you haven't figured it
out by now, "Point Break" was
very hard to take seriously (and I
think that's what the writers
wanted). But hey, it's only a
movie.
Dude.

Keanu Reeves, undercover FBI agent, has blown his cover in this
shot from "Point Break." How can you tell? He's fully clothed and
there's no surfboard or waves in the picture.
