Editor's picks:
Regression to childhood
• "101 Dalmatians" — Sing along to the
"Cruella De Vil" song. Cry when the pup
pies get stolen — like the movie's really
going to have a sad ending. And twist and
squirm in your seat when the big climatic
car chase ensues. Don't forget your "101
Dalmatians" Happy Meal either.
• Playgrounds — Rather than choose
something that actually costs money (which

kids, after all, do not have), we opt for a
good old-fashioned playground, complete
with swings, monkey bars and a jungle gym.

In addition, Frank Zappa is releasing a
box set (on tape and vinyl only) titled "Beat

bootleg albums. He figured he might as well
make some money off them himself. ...

Glover and Willem DaFoe

TV this week:
Blech. It's definitely summer in TV Land
this week, with little to offer on any station.
Even KHBK. ("The Movie Station") is
hopeless, rerunning "Shaka Zulu" for the
one millionth time this week.
On Monday, however, you can say good
bye to one of the finest shows in recent
years, as "China Beach" ends its run with a
two-hour final episode. Titled "Hello-
Goodbye," inside sources say this is a show
not to be missed.
