Kcanu Reeves is everywhere this week, or so it
seems. The Reeve-meister's two summer pictures
are going head-to-head, as "Bill and Ted's Bogus
Journey" opens tomorrow to take on "Point
Break," last Friday's release starring Reeves and
Patrick Swayze.
So just who is this young buck that he deserves
two hot summer roles? Second-Choice Videos
suggests you check out some of these past titles to
familiarize yourself with the definitive Keanu
Reeves.
• "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" — Of
course, this one will probably be as hard to come
by as the original "Terminator," but it's worth a

shot. Reeves stars as Ted "Theodore" Logan, des
tined to attend an Alaskan military school if he
doesn't ace his history final.
• "Parenthood" — Reeves stars as the aimless
boyfriend of Dianne Wiest's daughter. The real
star is Steve Martin, of course, but Reeves does
pose a poignant moral dilemma: Should he be a
race car driver or a painter?
• "Dangerous Liaisons" — Keanu Reeves is in
"Dangerous Liaisons"?!? Yes, it's true. He drops
his surfer boy accent, puts on some 18th century
finery, and plays the young lover of Uma Thur
man. He's the guy who shoots John Malkovich at
the end, remember?
• "I Love You to Death" — Reeves and William
Hurt (William Hurt?!?) play two grubby thugs
who double as inept hired killers. Whatever.
• "Tune In Tomorrow" — He's in love with his
aunt and Peter Falk turns it into a radio soap
opera.
• "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" — Oops.
That's not Keanu Reeves. It's Sean Penn doing his
surfer boy impression.
