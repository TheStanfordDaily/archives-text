## Column Halting sexism's spread 
### 
As a student at the School of
Medicine, I was recently
distracted from studying
for finals by a catastrophic event
that in many ways paralleled the
Earthquake of 1989, in which I
watched pieces of the Anatomy
Building crumble around me.
Prof. Francis Conley's sudden
resignation, after 25 years as a
highly respected neurosurgeon
and chair of the Faculty Senate of
the Medical School, literally
shook the entire Medical School
and felt like a great mixture of loss
and triumph.
One of the main reasons Con
ley resigned was that after 25
years at Stanford, she could no
longer tolerate the sexist com
ments, jeers and all-too-frequent
illicit caresses she received at the
hands of her colleagues.
When Conley stood before a
large audience of students to
explain her resignation, a woman
challenged her as to why she did
not stay at Stanford and confront
her colleagues. Conley admitted
she had handled the harassment
poorly and that now, at 50, she
wished to be happy and regain the
self-respect and dignity that had
eroded in the Stanford medical
community.
I interpreted the woman's com
ment as a plea for Conley to stay. I
and many of my peers felt a deep
sense of loss and even abandon
ment for the woman we had con
sidered one of our strongest
female role models in an institu
tion where there are so few.
In a student's eyes, her depar
ture deprived the community of
an eloquent and outspoken poten
tial advocate for women's rights.
Many of us felt perplexed by the
discordant picture of a strong
female neurosurgeon on the one
hand and a woman incapable of
defeating sexism in her own life
on the other. In fact, it might have
been this contradiction that
spurred Conley finally to resign.
Many of us now view Conley's
resignation as an invaluable gift to
women at the Medical School and
elsewhere. Had she chosen to
"fight" sexism under the current
policy, or more accurately, non
policy, her formal complaint
would probably have resulted in
the creation of yet another inter
nal committee.
This committee's findings,
should there be an investigation,
might then circulate indefinitely
in the largely male-dominated
bureaucratic maze, eluding reso
lution and action. In resigning,
Conley made a public statement
that was impossible to ignore.
Conley took a risk by publicly
explaining the nature of her
grievances, but her risk has helped
many people to understand sex
ism and its effects on women. For
women who have endured sexism
or sexual harassment, her action
allowed them to recognize it as
such, to stop blaming themselves
and to start talking openly about
their experiences.
In some cases, Conley inspired
and empowered women to lodge
formal complaints with their supe
riors. Her resignation created a
climate in which men and women
could join together to denounce
sexism and pressure the adminis
tration to redouble its efforts to
draft a policy and protocol for
dealing with complaints of sexism
and sexual harassment.
Unfortunately, at the Medical
School, sexism and sexual harass
ment are everyday occurrences.

Because of my experiences and
those of others, I could under
stand how it was possible for Con
ley and others to endure sexism
for years without reporting it.
Reporting sexual harassment
entails overcoming several barri
ers, which may be particularly dif
ficult for women in male-domi
nated fields.
First, a woman must be able to
recognize when she has been sex
ually harassed or insulted. When a
professor, male superior or col
league whom a woman has come
to respect and like suddenly
approaches her in a sexual man
ner, she may often find it difficult
to admit that he has acted inap
propriately.
I would speculate that for most
women, it is far less upsetting psy
chologically to deny illicit sexual
behavior than it is to acknowledge
it. Moreover, when a woman lacks
self-esteem she is not very likely to
trust her own intuition that tells
her she has been harassed or sex
ually insulted; she may be plagued
with doubts as to whether she pro
voked the incident in some way. In
many cases, women ultimately
blame themselves and misdirect
their anger not at the aggressor,
but at themselves.
Lack of self-esteem is a barrier
to reporting sexual harassment,
and it is generally recognized that
self-esteem does not come as eas
ily to women as it does to men.
When a woman experiences
sexual harassment, she does not
feel flattered. Sexual harassment
is not an expression of love or
even sexual attraction. It is a form
of violence in which men inappro
priately exert their power over
women.
Women subjected to repeated
sexism or harassment often feel a
loss of personal power and con
trol. These humiliating experi
ences engender an even lower
sense of self-esteem, which makes
it even more difficult to muster
the courage needed to fight the
injustice suffered.
A final barrier to a woman's
reporting sexism or sexual harass
ment is her desire to gain a
foothold or to be a "team player"
in a male-dominated profession.
Since speaking up about issues
of sexism might jeopardize a
woman's chances of professional
or economic advancement, she
might opt for silence. As medical
students, we often feel unable to
report cases of sexual harassment,
as we are afraid that coming for
ward might destroy our chances of
obtaining good recommendations
and future residency positions.
If we are ever to see an end to
sexism and sexual harassment, it is
very important that schools, busi
nesses and firms create clear poli
cies condemning these injustices.
Possibly even more important is a
well-publicized protocol that
begins by defining sexual harass


Karen Seal
mcnt and then describes the steps
a woman can take if she feels she
has been violated sexually.
Any action she chooses should
be designed to protect her, not vic
timize her further. There should
be a person appointed to serve as
an advocate for women, assisting
them in determining whether they
have experienced sexual harass
ment and guideing them through
the process of filing a formal com
plaints if necessary.
These measures are necessary

to combat existing sexism, but it
would be optimal to prevent sex
ism and sexual harassment from
occuring in the first place. An
effective way to discourage sexism
would be to sensitize the Stanford
community to gender issues.
Sensitization of the Stanford
community was certainly one of
the most valuable results of Con
ley's resignation, as it sparked a
great deal of discussion about sex
ism. Individuals began to explore
definitions, to recognize examples
of sexism in their own lives and to
propose strategies to eradicate it
from the learning environment at
Stanford.

In such a climate, men would
be willing to criticize other men
who are guilty of sexism and
women would not accuse their sis
ters of being weak, thereby mak
ing it even more difficult for those
who complain about harassment.
When the student challenged
Conley's decision to leave, she was
expressing an ideal. It is currently
very uncommon for a woman to
counter an act of sexism or harass
ment with a swift response that
both tells the aggressor she will
not tolerate such behavior and
allows her to recover her self
respect.
Much more commonplace is

the woman who takes the abuse
and later feels she has been vio
lated. Why should we assume that
just because a woman graduates
from a professional school that
she also knows how to cope with
sexism? Because women are not
trained to verbally confront men
who threaten them, I suggest that
they need specific training in
defending themselves against sex
ism.
Conley's resignation has shown
that if sexist structures and hierar
chies are to topple, we must not
be afraid to state the truth and to
demand that justice be done. If, as
women, we experience sexism or

harassment and remain silent, we
are accomplices in the debase
ment and humiliation of ourselves
and other women.
If, instead, we wish to create a
healthy environment in which to
learn and work, we must not allow
ourselves to be oppressed by
virtue of our sex, race, religion or
sexual preference. Ultimately,
oppression hurts everyone, as we
have seen at Stanford, which now
feels the loss of one of the finest
neurosurgeons, teachers and lead
ers in the country.

In such a climate, men would
be willing to criticize other men
who are guilty of sexism and
women would not accuse their sis
ters of being weak, thereby mak
ing it even more difficult for those
who complain about harassment.
When the student challenged
Conley's decision to leave, she was
expressing an ideal. It is currently
very uncommon for a woman to
counter an act of sexism or harass
ment with a swift response that
both tells the aggressor she will
not tolerate such behavior and
allows her to recover her self
respect.
Much more commonplace is

the woman who takes the abuse
and later feels she has been vio
lated. Why should we assume that
just because a woman graduates
from a professional school that
she also knows how to cope with
sexism? Because women are not
trained to verbally confront men
who threaten them, I suggest that
they need specific training in
defending themselves against sex
ism.
Conley's resignation has shown
that if sexist structures and hierar
chies are to topple, we must not
be afraid to state the truth and to
demand that justice be done. If, as
women, we experience sexism or

harassment and remain silent, we
are accomplices in the debase
ment and humiliation of ourselves
and other women.
If, instead, we wish to create a
healthy environment in which to
learn and work, we must not allow
ourselves to be oppressed by
virtue of our sex, race, religion or
sexual preference. Ultimately,
oppression hurts everyone, as we
have seen at Stanford, which now
feels the loss of one of the finest
neurosurgeons, teachers and lead
ers in the country.

Karen Seal is a third-year medical
student.
As a student at the School of
Medicine, I was recently
distracted from studying
for finals by a catastrophic event
that in many ways paralleled the
Earthquake of 1989, in which I
watched pieces of the Anatomy
Building crumble around me.
Prof. Francis Conley's sudden
resignation, after 25 years as a
highly respected neurosurgeon
and chair of the Faculty Senate of
the Medical School, literally
shook the entire Medical School
and felt like a great mixture of loss
and triumph.
One of the main reasons Con
ley resigned was that after 25
years at Stanford, she could no
longer tolerate the sexist com
ments, jeers and all-too-frequent
illicit caresses she received at the
hands of her colleagues.
When Conley stood before a
large audience of students to
explain her resignation, a woman
challenged her as to why she did
not stay at Stanford and confront
her colleagues. Conley admitted
she had handled the harassment
poorly and that now, at 50, she
wished to be happy and regain the
self-respect and dignity that had
eroded in the Stanford medical
community.
I interpreted the woman's com
ment as a plea for Conley to stay. I
and many of my peers felt a deep
sense of loss and even abandon
ment for the woman we had con
sidered one of our strongest
female role models in an institu
tion where there are so few.
In a student's eyes, her depar
ture deprived the community of
an eloquent and outspoken poten
tial advocate for women's rights.
Many of us felt perplexed by the
discordant picture of a strong
female neurosurgeon on the one
hand and a woman incapable of
defeating sexism in her own life
on the other. In fact, it might have
been this contradiction that
spurred Conley finally to resign.
Many of us now view Conley's
resignation as an invaluable gift to
women at the Medical School and
elsewhere. Had she chosen to
"fight" sexism under the current
policy, or more accurately, non
policy, her formal complaint
would probably have resulted in
the creation of yet another inter
nal committee.
This committee's findings,
should there be an investigation,
might then circulate indefinitely
in the largely male-dominated
bureaucratic maze, eluding reso
lution and action. In resigning,
Conley made a public statement
that was impossible to ignore.
Conley took a risk by publicly
explaining the nature of her
grievances, but her risk has helped
many people to understand sex
ism and its effects on women. For
women who have endured sexism
or sexual harassment, her action
allowed them to recognize it as
such, to stop blaming themselves
and to start talking openly about
their experiences.
In some cases, Conley inspired
and empowered women to lodge
formal complaints with their supe
riors. Her resignation created a
climate in which men and women
could join together to denounce
sexism and pressure the adminis
tration to redouble its efforts to
draft a policy and protocol for
dealing with complaints of sexism
and sexual harassment.
Unfortunately, at the Medical
School, sexism and sexual harass
ment are everyday occurrences.

Because of my experiences and
those of others, I could under
stand how it was possible for Con
ley and others to endure sexism
for years without reporting it.
Reporting sexual harassment
entails overcoming several barri
ers, which may be particularly dif
ficult for women in male-domi
nated fields.
First, a woman must be able to
recognize when she has been sex
ually harassed or insulted. When a
professor, male superior or col
league whom a woman has come
to respect and like suddenly
approaches her in a sexual man
ner, she may often find it difficult
to admit that he has acted inap
propriately.
I would speculate that for most
women, it is far less upsetting psy
chologically to deny illicit sexual
behavior than it is to acknowledge
it. Moreover, when a woman lacks
self-esteem she is not very likely to
trust her own intuition that tells
her she has been harassed or sex
ually insulted; she may be plagued
with doubts as to whether she pro
voked the incident in some way. In
many cases, women ultimately
blame themselves and misdirect
their anger not at the aggressor,
but at themselves.
Lack of self-esteem is a barrier
to reporting sexual harassment,
and it is generally recognized that
self-esteem does not come as eas
ily to women as it does to men.
When a woman experiences
sexual harassment, she does not
feel flattered. Sexual harassment
is not an expression of love or
even sexual attraction. It is a form
of violence in which men inappro
priately exert their power over
women.
Women subjected to repeated
sexism or harassment often feel a
loss of personal power and con
trol. These humiliating experi
ences engender an even lower
sense of self-esteem, which makes
it even more difficult to muster
the courage needed to fight the
injustice suffered.
A final barrier to a woman's
reporting sexism or sexual harass
ment is her desire to gain a
foothold or to be a "team player"
in a male-dominated profession.
Since speaking up about issues
of sexism might jeopardize a
woman's chances of professional
or economic advancement, she
might opt for silence. As medical
students, we often feel unable to
report cases of sexual harassment,
as we are afraid that coming for
ward might destroy our chances of
obtaining good recommendations
and future residency positions.
If we are ever to see an end to
sexism and sexual harassment, it is
very important that schools, busi
nesses and firms create clear poli
cies condemning these injustices.
Possibly even more important is a
well-publicized protocol that
begins by defining sexual harass


Karen Seal
mcnt and then describes the steps
a woman can take if she feels she
has been violated sexually.
Any action she chooses should
be designed to protect her, not vic
timize her further. There should
be a person appointed to serve as
an advocate for women, assisting
them in determining whether they
have experienced sexual harass
ment and guideing them through
the process of filing a formal com
plaints if necessary.
These measures are necessary

to combat existing sexism, but it
would be optimal to prevent sex
ism and sexual harassment from
occuring in the first place. An
effective way to discourage sexism
would be to sensitize the Stanford
community to gender issues.
Sensitization of the Stanford
community was certainly one of
the most valuable results of Con
ley's resignation, as it sparked a
great deal of discussion about sex
ism. Individuals began to explore
definitions, to recognize examples
of sexism in their own lives and to
propose strategies to eradicate it
from the learning environment at
Stanford.

In such a climate, men would
be willing to criticize other men
who are guilty of sexism and
women would not accuse their sis
