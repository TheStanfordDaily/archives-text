## Diagnosis: Condition critical but not terminal 
### 
Combating the entrenched sexist attitudes that
predominate the medical field will present an
imposing challenge to the students, faculty
and administrators who hope to reform the School of
Medicine.
Those patterns of behavior are deeply ingrained
in the medical community. Many on the faculty of
the school learned those attitudes during their own
education, and, often without malicious intentions,
transmit them to another generation of doctors.
That discrimination can take the form of overt
sexual harassment, as alleged against Prof. Mark
Perlroth last month. More often, however, those atti
tudes are subtle and insidious, taking the form of a
gentle condescension or a lack of respect for
another's abilities.
A strategy for combating harassment and other
forms of gender insensitivity must clearly involve a
reform of policy and a change in the Medical
School's institutions.
One much-needed change is an overhaul of the
University's policy on sexual harassment. That policy
must provide, above all, a clear mechanism for vic
tims to come forward with complaints.
Victims must be assured that the system will
address their concerns in a sensitive way that
respects their privacy and provides them with an
advocate in an institutional structure dominated by
men.
The American Medical Association has suggested
the creation of a sexual harassment panel at univer

sities, to serve as faculty and students' first line of
recourse.
Such a panel should not be created on an ad hoc
basis, however; it should be permanent and consist
of members who are well-trained in harassment
issues.
The Medical School must also establish an advo
cacy program for female students; this need may
possibly be filled by Susan Epstein, the University's
new coordinator of sexual assault prevention educa
tion and response.
Educational programs are clearly needed, but if
attended with reluctance and closed-mindedness on
the part of male doctors and students, such programs
are likely to accomplish little.
Commanding the attention and the willingness to
change of doctors and students in one of the nation's
best medical schools will require a program of
superb quality, one that spares little expense and
includes top experts on issues of gender, harassment
and hierarchical relationships.
Events like those of the last month can be dis
missed by the University as an unfortunate embar
rassment or embraced as indicators of the need for
change.
Stanford is surely not alone among medical
schools in possessing deeply entrenched sexist atti
tudes. What could set it apart at this juncture is a
willingness to change, an enthusiasm for reform that
becomes a model for other institutions.
