Stanford needs to
adapt and respond
to changing world
It is time for change at Stan
ford. An era has ended. At the
conclusion of World War 11, Fred
erick Terman foresaw the coming
scientific and technological revo
lution and realized this was the
vehicle that could drive a strong
regional university to become a
leading international university.
Terman recognized that finan
cial leverage would be provided by
a federal government that needed
more excellent science and engi
neering than was available to it.
He saw that further strength could
be obtained by properly pioneer
ing new industry that would
embody, carry forth, provide civil
ian application for and give a new
staying power to this scientific and
technological revolution.
Terman's vision, supported by
Sterling and carried forward by
successive Stanford administra
tions, has built a premier univer
sity. Yet today, the reputation and
finances of that university are

under external siege as an internal
grassroots faculty revolt is grow
ing. Why?
Because the present adminis
tration has not recognized that
the world that nourished Ter
man's Stanford has changed.
Stanford's success energized
100 imitators. Other universities
saw the Silicon Valley grow and
enrich a region, so they poured
their resources into duplicating
Stanford's success. Because of this
and other factors, the number of
excellent engineers and scientists
grew exponentially, while federal
funds did not.
Finally, a situation developed
in which the diversion of govern
ment's research funds, via over
head, into support of Stanford's
— as well as other universities' —
broader objectives became in
creasingly unacceptable.
If Stanford is to survive as a
great research university, it must
recognize the changed world
around it. The problem has been
compounded by the creation of an
abnormally large university legal
staff which increasingly controls
the University.
The legal staff have neither an

appreciation of how the faculty
must function if Stanford is to be a
great university nor of the differ
ence between legally defendable
and publicly acceptable behavior.
For example, after over a year of
faculty, government and media
attacks on its outdated and ques
tionable overhead policies, this
month Stanford replied by saying
it deserved a huge increase in
overhead — to a historic high of
76 percent.
Stanford is a wonderful place.
It has much to give to the nation
and the world and yet, because of
a failure of leadership, it is
approaching self-destruction. The
administration appears worn and
out of touch with reality.
We often hear that nothing can
be done to disturb the Centennial
Celebration, that it must pass
before any changes can be made.
But is this true? Should not the
Centennial Celebration be the
very mechanism to dedicate Stan
ford to a new birth of excellence
and service?
