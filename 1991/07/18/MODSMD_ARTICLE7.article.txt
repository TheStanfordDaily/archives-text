## Hoover celebrates 50 years 
### Tracy Shinn 
Birthdays are a time
for celebration,
reflection and look
ing to the future.
When former President
Herbert Hoover in 1941
dedicated what was then
called the Hoover Library,
the $600,000 structure was
to be home to a collection
of 5 million documents —
an enormous collection for
the time.
Hoover had begun his collection — of
maps, films, photographs, posters, pam
phlets, books and secret reports — in 1914
and added to it throughout his years of
relief work in Europe after World War I.
Today, as Hoover Tower celebrates its
50th birthday, Hoover's institution holds
more than 38 million items, including 1.6
million books and 4,000 special collec
tions.
The 50th birthday of Hoover Tower
coincides with a time of transition for the
Hoover Institution — one which scholars
hope may allow it to continue its growth
free of the conflict with the University that
has characterized recent years.
Hoover's past and future will be the

focus of today's festivities, which
will feature speeches and presen
tations by Gov. Pete Wilson, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy,
Hoover Director John Raisian,
Hoover Board of Overseers Chair
Robert Malott and Herbert
Hoover 111, the former president's
grandson. More than 500 people
are expected to attend.
Hoover 111 will present a 90-
second taped excerpt of his grand
father's 1941 dedication address.

In his dedication of the tower in 1941,
Hoover stressed the uniqueness of the col
lections. He said, "Here are not alone pub
lished books. They are easy to obtain. But
here are the fugitive documents which
quickly disappear. Here are the inner
records "
In 1938 The New York Times pointed
out the sensitivity of the Hoover records,
highlighting the fact that the Institution
had many "secret bundles" that may not be
opened for a specified number of years,
because their contents could seriously
endanger either individuals or entire
nations.
But to the "layman," The Times wrote,
the most interesting document in the
Hoover collections was likely a report from
the famous female spy, Mata Hari, on the
actions of the French Foreign Ministry.
In his opening address, President
Hoover said he did not seek to expose
secrets or to generate any kind of sensa
tionalism with the Institution and its
archives. Rather, he hoped to contribute to
greater understanding and to defeat
rhetoric and propaganda.
Hoover hoped future generations
would benefit from the archives and think
tank. As he stated in his dedication, "Out
of these files the world can get a great
warning of what not to do when it next
assembles around the peace table."
For the Institution's 200 researchers
and staff members, the archives and col
lections, representing every corner of the
globe, are not mere curiosities.
As the Institution has continued to add
to the records of 20th century war and
peace, its fellows have made remarkable
academic contributions. Hoover fellows
include five Nobel Prize winners.
But the Institution has not always
peacefully coexisted with the University.
Particularly during the last 10 years, the
Stanford-Hoover relationship has had seri
ous problems.
Many Stanford professors disputed the
value of the Institution's affiliation with
the University and openly questioned its
traditionally conservative bent, its appoint
ment procedures and its internal govern
ment.
The controversy made collaborative
research or teaching efforts awkward if not
impossible, prompting some professors to
favor a complete separation of the Institu
tion from the University.
However, Director John Raisian, who
took over in 1989 after W. Glenn Camp

bell, director of 30 years, stepped down at
age 65, appears to have ushered in a new
era of cooperation between Stanford and
the Institution.
A labor economist, Raisian holds a doc
torate from UCLA. He said he finds his
position as director particularly fulfilling
because it allows him to incorporate ele-

ments of all of his previous jobs in
academia, public policy and financial man
agement.
His research and management experi
ence speaks for itself, but Raisian's success
as director of the Institution speaks even
louder. As Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson pointed out, stepping into the

director's position was no small task.
Raisian had large shoes to fill and was fac
ing the formidable challenge of bringing
the mutual interests of the Institution and
Stanford to the fore.
He immediately defied a 22-year prece
dent by attending a Faculty Senate meeting
on Feb. 22, 1990. Although he wore a

World War I fighting helmet as he
made his entrance, his presenta
tion was not confrontational.
Rather, he sought to be informa
tive and communicative. Raisian
discussed the Institution's merit as
both a historical archive and a
think tank.

One year and four months later,
Raisian said his current position
has presented the "greatest chal
lenge I've ever experienced,"
given his responsibility for "fueling the
Institution" through fund raising and pub
lic relations as well as his involvement in
the Institution's research programs.
Raisian said he has made a concentrat
ed effort to show that the Stanford-Hoover
relationship is mutually beneficial. He
added, "I think that we add another
dimension to the intellectual climate at
Stanford."
He also said that while one may deem
the individual stances of Hoover scholars
conservative, the think tank as a whole
does not have an ideological mission.
Raisian said, "We're really not an insti
tution dedicated to an ideological stance.
We are focused on studying social changes
as they relate to public policy formation."
Senior fellow and curator of the African
and Middle East Collection Peter Duignan
said Raisian's strictly administrative, non
ideological approach to the Institution
directorship is an important factor in his
success thus far. He praised Raisian for
"leaving it to the individual scholars to put
forth their own opinions."
Duignan also commented on Raisian's
efforts to cooperate with the University
and end the adversarial relationship of the
past. Like Anderson, he noted the fellows'
support for Raisian, saying, "He has every
one's support here, I'm sure."
Raisian said he has felt considerable
support from the Hoover fellows because
he rose to his position from within their
ranks.
Deputy Director Charles Palm also
praised Raisian's accomplishments, saying,
"His ability to communicate the mission of
the Institution and implement programs
has impressed all of us." Palm spoke of
Raisian's innate ability to work well with
other people and develop a team-like
unity.
Palm also gave insight into the future of
the Institution under Raisian, stressing the
continued independence of the fellows in
their research as well as Institution pro
grams addressing contemporary issues
such as democratization and the develop
ment of market economies in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.
All of the fellows who commented felt
that Raisian would continue in his cooper
ation with Stanford in the pursuit of mutu
al benefit.
When asked about his future plans,
Raisian responded in his amiable manner,
"I'm really very happy doing what I'm
doing and I plan on doing it for a long
time. And the weather's not bad either."

more than 38 million items, including 1.6
million books and 4,000 special collec
tions.
The 50th birthday of Hoover Tower
coincides with a time of transition for the
Hoover Institution — one which scholars
hope may allow it to continue its growth
free of the conflict with the University that
has characterized recent years.
Hoover's past and future will be the

focus of today's festivities, which
will feature speeches and presen
tations by Gov. Pete Wilson, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy,
Hoover Director John Raisian,
Hoover Board of Overseers Chair
Robert Malott and Herbert
Hoover 111, the former president's
grandson. More than 500 people
are expected to attend.
Hoover 111 will present a 90-
second taped excerpt of his grand
father's 1941 dedication address.

In his dedication of the tower in 1941,
Hoover stressed the uniqueness of the col
lections. He said, "Here are not alone pub
lished books. They are easy to obtain. But
here are the fugitive documents which
quickly disappear. Here are the inner
records "
In 1938 The New York Times pointed
out the sensitivity of the Hoover records,
highlighting the fact that the Institution
had many "secret bundles" that may not be
opened for a specified number of years,
because their contents could seriously
endanger either individuals or entire
nations.
But to the "layman," The Times wrote,
the most interesting document in the
Hoover collections was likely a report from
the famous female spy, Mata Hari, on the
actions of the French Foreign Ministry.
In his opening address, President
Hoover said he did not seek to expose
secrets or to generate any kind of sensa
tionalism with the Institution and its
archives. Rather, he hoped to contribute to
greater understanding and to defeat
rhetoric and propaganda.
Hoover hoped future generations
would benefit from the archives and think
tank. As he stated in his dedication, "Out
of these files the world can get a great
warning of what not to do when it next
assembles around the peace table."
For the Institution's 200 researchers
and staff members, the archives and col
lections, representing every corner of the
globe, are not mere curiosities.
As the Institution has continued to add
to the records of 20th century war and
peace, its fellows have made remarkable
academic contributions. Hoover fellows
include five Nobel Prize winners.
But the Institution has not always
peacefully coexisted with the University.
Particularly during the last 10 years, the
Stanford-Hoover relationship has had seri
ous problems.
Many Stanford professors disputed the
value of the Institution's affiliation with
the University and openly questioned its
traditionally conservative bent, its appoint
ment procedures and its internal govern
ment.
The controversy made collaborative
research or teaching efforts awkward if not
impossible, prompting some professors to
favor a complete separation of the Institu
tion from the University.
However, Director John Raisian, who
took over in 1989 after W. Glenn Camp

bell, director of 30 years, stepped down at
age 65, appears to have ushered in a new
era of cooperation between Stanford and
the Institution.
A labor economist, Raisian holds a doc
torate from UCLA. He said he finds his
position as director particularly fulfilling
because it allows him to incorporate ele-

ments of all of his previous jobs in
academia, public policy and financial man
agement.
His research and management experi
ence speaks for itself, but Raisian's success
as director of the Institution speaks even
louder. As Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson pointed out, stepping into the

director's position was no small task.
Raisian had large shoes to fill and was fac
ing the formidable challenge of bringing
the mutual interests of the Institution and
Stanford to the fore.
He immediately defied a 22-year prece
dent by attending a Faculty Senate meeting
on Feb. 22, 1990. Although he wore a

World War I fighting helmet as he
made his entrance, his presenta
tion was not confrontational.
Rather, he sought to be informa
tive and communicative. Raisian
discussed the Institution's merit as
both a historical archive and a
think tank.

One year and four months later,
Raisian said his current position
has presented the "greatest chal
lenge I've ever experienced,"
given his responsibility for "fueling the
Institution" through fund raising and pub
lic relations as well as his involvement in
the Institution's research programs.
Raisian said he has made a concentrat
ed effort to show that the Stanford-Hoover
relationship is mutually beneficial. He
added, "I think that we add another
dimension to the intellectual climate at
Stanford."
He also said that while one may deem
the individual stances of Hoover scholars
conservative, the think tank as a whole
does not have an ideological mission.
Raisian said, "We're really not an insti
tution dedicated to an ideological stance.
We are focused on studying social changes
as they relate to public policy formation."
Senior fellow and curator of the African
and Middle East Collection Peter Duignan
said Raisian's strictly administrative, non
ideological approach to the Institution
directorship is an important factor in his
success thus far. He praised Raisian for
"leaving it to the individual scholars to put
forth their own opinions."
Duignan also commented on Raisian's
efforts to cooperate with the University
and end the adversarial relationship of the
past. Like Anderson, he noted the fellows'
support for Raisian, saying, "He has every
one's support here, I'm sure."
Raisian said he has felt considerable
support from the Hoover fellows because
he rose to his position from within their
ranks.
Deputy Director Charles Palm also
praised Raisian's accomplishments, saying,
"His ability to communicate the mission of
the Institution and implement programs
has impressed all of us." Palm spoke of
Raisian's innate ability to work well with
other people and develop a team-like
unity.
Palm also gave insight into the future of
the Institution under Raisian, stressing the
continued independence of the fellows in
their research as well as Institution pro
grams addressing contemporary issues
such as democratization and the develop
ment of market economies in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.
All of the fellows who commented felt
that Raisian would continue in his cooper
ation with Stanford in the pursuit of mutu
al benefit.
When asked about his future plans,
Raisian responded in his amiable manner,
"I'm really very happy doing what I'm
doing and I plan on doing it for a long
time. And the weather's not bad either."

Birthdays are a time
for celebration,
reflection and look
ing to the future.
When former President
Herbert Hoover in 1941
dedicated what was then
called the Hoover Library,
the $600,000 structure was
to be home to a collection
of 5 million documents —
an enormous collection for
the time.
Hoover had begun his collection — of
maps, films, photographs, posters, pam
phlets, books and secret reports — in 1914
and added to it throughout his years of
relief work in Europe after World War I.
Today, as Hoover Tower celebrates its
50th birthday, Hoover's institution holds
more than 38 million items, including 1.6
million books and 4,000 special collec
tions.
