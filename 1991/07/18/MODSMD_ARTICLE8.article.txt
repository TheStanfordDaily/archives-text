## New hope for old Row houses 
### 
The University may try to
repair earthquake-damaged Phi
Psi, rather than carry out previous
plans to demolish it, said Planning
Director Phil Williams.
Officials had stated that they
would raze Phi Psi along with Syn
ergy and the Delta Tau Delta
house as part of a plan to build
new faculty housing on the site.
"If it can be used for apart
ments or something that we need,
then it will be part of the faculty
housing," said Williams. "We are
committed to try — because it's a
building of historical value."
In a related development, the
Santa Clara County Historical
Heritage Commission unani
mously voted to recommend that
turn-of-the century Synergy be
designated a state point of histor
ical interest. The University still
intends to demolish the house.
Former residents of the houses
and admirers of the buildings'
architecture have been critical of
the University's decision to raze
the houses and replace them with
revenue-generating faculty hous
ing.
In a memo he submitted to the
commission Thursday, Williams
wrote, "We will be conducting fur
ther study on ways we can keep
and repair the Cooksey House
(Phi Psi) and use it as part of the
faculty housing project."
After submitting his memoran
dum, Williams told the commis
sion that Synergy was not impor
tant enough historically to justify
point-of-interest status but added
that the University is trying to
make possible the preservation of
Phi Psi.
The University has maintained
that repairing the three San Juan
Hill houses — Synergy, Phi Psi
and the Delta Tau Delta house —
cost as much as $4.5 million. If
Stanford builds faculty housing on
the sites and student housing at a
new location closer to other stu
dent housing, the net cost would
be around $1.7 million, according
to Williams.
"You have to establish priori
ties when you have a limited
amount of money," said Williams.
"We're repairing a lot of buildings
that have much more legitimate
claims to historical importance."
The plan Williams is consider
ing would involve the conversion of
Phi Psi to apartments for use by
visiting professors and scholars
who are at the University for a

short time. The
revenue gener
ated would be
used to construct
more student hous
ing on other parts
of the campus.
Williams' state
ment pleased some
critics of the Uni
versity's plans.

"That's terrific news," said History
Prof. Peter Stansky, who has
described the University's intention
to demolish the houses as "histori
cal vandalism."
"Those buildings should be
preserved," Stansky said. "It
would be a mistake to tear them
down."
Both events have encouraged
members of the Committee to
Save the Hill Houses, a group of
Stanford alumni that is fighting to
protect the earthquake-damaged
houses on San Juan Hill from the
wrecking ball.
"That was news to us," said
committee member Barry Lake,
who said he was delighted but
skeptical about the statement that
Phi Psi might be saved. If sincere,
Lake said, it represents an impor
tant concession.

However, Lake said he won
ders whether the statement was
merely an attempt to "display
some sensitivity" on the Univer
sity's part and affect the county's
decision on Synergy.
Even if that was the intent of
the statement, it wasn't enough to
sway the Santa Clara commis
sion's recommendation. The Cali
fornia Historical Resources Com
mission will decide Aug. 2
whether to follow that recommen
dation by making the house a state
point of historical interest.
Such a designation wouldn't
save the brown-shingled Synergy.
It would, however, draw more
attention to the University's plan
to demolish the buildings this
summer, which committee mem
bers say would invite negative
publicity, the only thing that they
believe will change the Univer
sity's mind.

Williams said
that he appreci
ates the group's
efforts but finds
their thinking
somewhat naive.
"The money just
isn't there," he
said.
"If we don't
raise the money

to build student housing else
where on campus, then students
will end up having to find apart
ments in Palo Alto," he added.
The University uses a process
for evaluating historic buildings
known as the Historic Values
Index, which evaluates buildings
based on age, aesthetic quality,
unusualness at Stanford, impor
tance to Stanford history and cul
ture, and importance to the exter
nal community.
Synergy and the Delt house
have index ratings which Williams
describes as "moderate"; Phi Psi's
rating is higher in almost every
category.
The three houses were severely
damaged in the Earthquake of
1989.
Lake and the committee plan
to continue a campaign of writing

letters to alumni of the resi
dences, alerting them of the Uni
versity's plan to demolish the
houses and soliciting their assis
tance in preventing it.

Phi Psi, one of three earthquake-damaged houses on San Juan Hill
slated for destruction by the University, may yet be repaired and pre
served among newer faculty housing.
