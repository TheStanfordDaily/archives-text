# House passes research cap
## 
### 
In the latest setback for Stan
ford and other research universi
ties, the U.S. House of Represen
tatives voted last week to limit the
indirect-cost recovery that univer
sities can receive from grants and
contracts awarded by the National
Science Foundation.
The measure, added to an NSF
reauthorization bill, caps the
administrative component of indi
rect-cost recovery at 26 percent.
Stanford, which receives about
one-tenth of its research funds
from the NSF, has an administra
tive-cost rate of about 28 percent,
according to University officials.
Administrative costs are one
component of indirect-cost recov
ery. Under government policy,
universities are reimbursed for
the direct costs of doing research
as well as for the indirect costs —
those expenses necessary to con
duct federal research but not eas
ily attributable to a single project.
The measure passed by the
House last week is similar to a
White House proposal published
in the Federal Register late last
month. The White House pro
posal caps administrative costs at
26 percent, but is far broader,
applying to grants and contracts
from all federal agencies.
In a related move, the Senate
Appropriations Committee last
week rejected a proposal that
would have capped the adminis
trative rate applied to grants from
the National Institutes of Health
at 23 percent.
The measure, dubbed by one
senator as the"the Donald
Kennedy — Stanford University
Memorial Provision," was deemed
too draconian by the committee.

Sen. Brock Adams, a Washing
ton Democrat, suggested that lim
its on indirect-cost recovery
should be phased in so that uni
versities don't suffer "too big a
bite in the first year."
The flurry of legislative and
executive activity is largely in
response to allegations of massive
overcharging of the government
by Stanford and audits showing
the University had included sev
eral inappropriate items in its
cost-recovery claims.
Ongoing audits at other
research universities are produc
ing similar findings.
Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., who
sponsored the House measure,
said the provision was necessary
to correct the "misbehavior" of
Stanford and other research uni
versities.
