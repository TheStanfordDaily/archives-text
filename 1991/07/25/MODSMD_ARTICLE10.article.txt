# Stanford strives for accountability
## 
### John Wagner 
In an effort to restore credibility with the
public, the University announced plans
Monday for sweeping changes in the way it
manages federal research funds.
The reforms, developed over the past six
months with help from Big Six accounting firm
Arthur Andersen and Co., are intended to
strengthen the University's accounting system
and prevent inappropriate expenses from
being inadvertently charged to the government
as indirect costs of research.

The University's reputation has taken a
beating since last fall, when federal audi
tors began a string of embarrassing disclo
sures about what had been included in
Stanford's bills to the government during
the last decade. Questionable expenses
included depreciation on the University
owned 72-foot yacht Victoria, administra
tive costs from the Stanford Shopping
Center, and flowers and antiques at Lou
Henry Hoover House, the home of
University President Donald Kennedy.
"We are confident that, once this reform
program has been implemented, Stanford
will be able to avoid the errors and inap
propriate submissions that have been the
subject of so much attention," University
officials said in a statement released to the
public.
Several hundred copies of the reform
proposals were distributed to congressmen,
Navy representatives and other federal
officials in Washington, D.C., at the end of
last week. Hundreds of copies were also
delivered to all Stanford faculty during the
past few days and will be mailed to
University alumni shortly.
Total distribution of proposals is expect
ed to reach 170,000, according to Stanford
spokesman Rich Kurovsky.

The wide distribution reflects
an effort "to reassure people
that the University is taking its
problem seriously," Kurovsky
said.
Planned reforms include cre
ating a more sophisticated sys
tem of classifying expenses,
developing a comprehensive
code of ethics and conduct for
employees, and hiring a
Compliance Support Officer to
"help facilitate compliance by all
Stanford employees with appli
cable laws and regulations."
Arthur Andersen's report
contained 35 detailed recom
mendations. Some reforms arc
to begin on Sept. 1 while others
are expectcd to take up to two
years to implement, according to
University officials.
The reforms will be costly.
Peter Van Etten, the
University's new chief financial
officer, said in an interview yes
terday that the Arthur Andersen

study alone had cost the
University $1 million.
The initial implementa
tion of the reforms will cost
an additional "several mil

lion" dollars, Van Etten
said. And the annual cost of maintaining
the new system, he said, will run "several
hundred thousand dollars" higher than the
current system.
"It will be expensive," Van Etten said.
"There's no question about it."
But he said University officials were
"not looking at this from a dollars-and
cents point of view." Rather, the senior
administrators responsible for developing
the reforms felt the need "to restore faith
and integrity in the management of
Stanford," even at a very high price.
Upon the implementation of reforms,
Stanford's accounting system will more
closely resemble that of a major defense
contractor than of a research university,
Van Etten said.
Administrators felt such a sophisticated
system was necessary to comply with evolv
ing federal standards of accountability.
"There is a change in expectations," he
said, "especially at Stanford. We are seen

more as a defense contractor than a uni
versity."
That notion has caused some concern
among the members of an outside, blue
ribbon advisory panel assembled by
Kennedy. In a report to the Board of
Trustees earlier this month, the panel,
which includes former Deputy Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency Bobby
Inman, endorsed the University's course of
action but said it feared the plan could rep
resent "overkill."
"Our concern is that the University, in
responding to justified criticism may have
developed an accounting system that is
excessive and far too expensive for the
value sought," the panel report said. "The
accounting tail may well now wag the
research dog."
The panel said it did not believe
Stanford's costly reform efforts were an
ideal model for other universities seeking
to improve its accounting systems.

According to Van Etten, Stanford's
main concern was developing a system that
would meet the University's immediate
need to restore its credibility. "First and
foremost, Stanford needed to take strong
steps to address its own problems," he
said.
Response from government officials to
the University's reform proposals has been
mixed.
Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat who held a punishing hearing on
Stanford's research practices in March,
said the University's reform efforts
appeared "to be sincere."
But he criticized the University for not
going far enough in identifying its prob
lems. "How can you prescribe cures if you
have not identified the disease?" Dingell
asked.
In a prepared statement, Rear Adm.
William Miller, the chief of naval research,
said he was "encouraged" by the

University's efforts. Miller's
agency has oversight responsibili
ty for all federal research done at
Stanford.
"The planning looks good,"
Miller said of the University's
reform proposals, "but we cannot
declare 'victory' until after the
plan is fully implemented and the
results can be measured."
Stanford and Navy officials
will face off at the negotiating
table again in August to deter
mine a final indirect-cost rate for
fiscal year 1991. Negotiations
between the two parties broke
down in April, at which time the
Navy unilaterally cut Stanford's
rate from 78 to 55.5 percent
because it said Stanford's formu
las for determining costs were not
reliable.
The Navy's decision cost the
University about $28 million in
revenue this year.
Stanford will attempt to
recoup some of that loss next
month.

cable laws and regulations."
Arthur Andersen's report
contained 35 detailed recom
mendations. Some reforms arc
to begin on Sept. 1 while others
are expectcd to take up to two
years to implement, according to
University officials.
The reforms will be costly.
Peter Van Etten, the
University's new chief financial
officer, said in an interview yes
terday that the Arthur Andersen

study alone had cost the
University $1 million.
The initial implementa
tion of the reforms will cost
an additional "several mil

lion" dollars, Van Etten
said. And the annual cost of maintaining
the new system, he said, will run "several
hundred thousand dollars" higher than the
current system.
"It will be expensive," Van Etten said.
"There's no question about it."
But he said University officials were
"not looking at this from a dollars-and
cents point of view." Rather, the senior
administrators responsible for developing
the reforms felt the need "to restore faith
and integrity in the management of
Stanford," even at a very high price.
Upon the implementation of reforms,
Stanford's accounting system will more
closely resemble that of a major defense
contractor than of a research university,
Van Etten said.
Administrators felt such a sophisticated
system was necessary to comply with evolv
ing federal standards of accountability.
"There is a change in expectations," he
said, "especially at Stanford. We are seen

more as a defense contractor than a uni
versity."
That notion has caused some concern
among the members of an outside, blue
ribbon advisory panel assembled by
Kennedy. In a report to the Board of
Trustees earlier this month, the panel,
which includes former Deputy Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency Bobby
Inman, endorsed the University's course of
action but said it feared the plan could rep
resent "overkill."
"Our concern is that the University, in
responding to justified criticism may have
developed an accounting system that is
excessive and far too expensive for the
value sought," the panel report said. "The
accounting tail may well now wag the
research dog."
The panel said it did not believe
Stanford's costly reform efforts were an
ideal model for other universities seeking
to improve its accounting systems.

According to Van Etten, Stanford's
main concern was developing a system that
would meet the University's immediate
need to restore its credibility. "First and
foremost, Stanford needed to take strong
steps to address its own problems," he
said.
Response from government officials to
the University's reform proposals has been
mixed.
Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat who held a punishing hearing on
Stanford's research practices in March,
said the University's reform efforts
appeared "to be sincere."
But he criticized the University for not
going far enough in identifying its prob
lems. "How can you prescribe cures if you
have not identified the disease?" Dingell
asked.
In a prepared statement, Rear Adm.
William Miller, the chief of naval research,
said he was "encouraged" by the

University's efforts. Miller's
agency has oversight responsibili
ty for all federal research done at
Stanford.
"The planning looks good,"
Miller said of the University's
reform proposals, "but we cannot
declare 'victory' until after the
plan is fully implemented and the
results can be measured."
Stanford and Navy officials
will face off at the negotiating
table again in August to deter
mine a final indirect-cost rate for
fiscal year 1991. Negotiations
between the two parties broke
down in April, at which time the
Navy unilaterally cut Stanford's
rate from 78 to 55.5 percent
because it said Stanford's formu
las for determining costs were not
reliable.
The Navy's decision cost the
University about $28 million in
revenue this year.
Stanford will attempt to
recoup some of that loss next
month.

Peter Van Etten, the University's new chief financial officer, is looking to improve
Stanford's reputation by strengthening Its accounting system. Reform will be costly,
however. Van Etten estimates the price tag on new-forged integrity to be several mil
lion dollars.
In an effort to restore credibility with the
public, the University announced plans
Monday for sweeping changes in the way it
manages federal research funds.
The reforms, developed over the past six
months with help from Big Six accounting firm
Arthur Andersen and Co., are intended to
strengthen the University's accounting system
and prevent inappropriate expenses from
being inadvertently charged to the government
as indirect costs of research.

The University's reputation has taken a
beating since last fall, when federal audi
tors began a string of embarrassing disclo
sures about what had been included in
Stanford's bills to the government during
the last decade. Questionable expenses
included depreciation on the University
owned 72-foot yacht Victoria, administra
tive costs from the Stanford Shopping
Center, and flowers and antiques at Lou
Henry Hoover House, the home of
University President Donald Kennedy.
"We are confident that, once this reform
program has been implemented, Stanford
will be able to avoid the errors and inap
propriate submissions that have been the
subject of so much attention," University
officials said in a statement released to the
public.
Several hundred copies of the reform
proposals were distributed to congressmen,
Navy representatives and other federal
officials in Washington, D.C., at the end of
last week. Hundreds of copies were also
delivered to all Stanford faculty during the
past few days and will be mailed to
University alumni shortly.
Total distribution of proposals is expect
ed to reach 170,000, according to Stanford
spokesman Rich Kurovsky.

The wide distribution reflects
an effort "to reassure people
that the University is taking its
problem seriously," Kurovsky
said.
Planned reforms include cre
ating a more sophisticated sys
tem of classifying expenses,
developing a comprehensive
code of ethics and conduct for
employees, and hiring a
Compliance Support Officer to
"help facilitate compliance by all
Stanford employees with appli
cable laws and regulations."
