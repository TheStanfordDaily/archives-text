scaffolding on the arch

leading into the west side of the

Quad. Repair work has begun in earnest this summer, especially
on Memorial Church. The church roof will be removed, tile by tile,
and strengthened with plywood sheeting.

Sometime in the next few weeks, the
serenity of the Inner Quad is going
to be shattered — by a crane.
As the long task of rebuilding
Memorial Church begins in earnest, con
struction workers will lift heavy metal
structural supports for the church.
They will also begin removing sections
of the roof, tile by tile.
The work on the church is only one of
the major repair and new construction
projects that have shifted into high gear
this summer.
"We've had a number of projects, and
a number are just getting to the point
where they're going into construction,"
said Facilities Project Management
Director Curt Williams.
Construction has been stepped up on
several earthquake-damaged buildings,
the portals in the Quad and the Graduate
School of Business.
In addition, repair work on Buildings
310 and 300 — on either side of the
church — and Building 500 — behind the
Quad — began recently.
The work on the church may be the
most involved and visible of this summer's
projects.
"We are almost building a new build
ing," said Williams.
Removing the roof will allow workers
to install a new fire sprinkler system and a
roof diaphragm.
The roof diaphragm consists of ply
wood sheeting and is designed to bind
together the walls on the roof, said
Olivier Pieron, project manager for the
church construction. He described it as
putting "a lid on the box."
The tiles will be replaced on top of the
plywood sheeting, Pieron added. This
part of the project will probably be com
pleted by November.
The crane will be used to begin the
structural repairs to the church. Pieron
said it will be used to place the very
heavy metal frame for reinforced con
crete inside the walls of the Church's
crossing.
None of the reinforcements will be vis
ible after the project's completion, sched

uled for early next year, Pieron said.
After the major structural reinforce
ments are complete, the University also
plans to replace the church's old mecha
nized heating system and install a new
sound system.
In addition, some of the artwork and
painted surfaces in the church, which
Pieron said are cracked and"in fairly bad
shape," will be repaired under the super
vision of Leslie Bone of the De Young
Museum in San Francisco.

Williams said the church
reconstruction is on schedule and
will be completed by the start of
school in 1992. It may even be
sooner, he added.
The Quad portals will definit
ley be completed much sooner —
by September. "The portals were
key" because of their involvement
in the Centennial Celebration,
Williams said. The project
involves repairing and strengthen
ing the structure inside the walls.
Some foundation work also has to
be done, he added.

The Centennial Celebration will put a
short brake on the construction projects.
Williams said his office is "planning
around" the festivities and "construction
activity will shut down during this peri
od."
At the Graduate School of Business,
work continues on the second part of a
two-year seismic strengthening project.
Although the initial earthquake damage
to the building was repaired last year, the
University is upgrading the building's
structure so it will resist further earth
quake damage.
The repairs involve adding shear walls
to the side of the building that faces Serra
Street. The other end has already been
completed. The area under construction
is currently closed off.
Facilities Project Management is tak
ing the damage to Buildings 30() and 310
as an opportunity to remodel the build
ings' interiors. The entire inside of
Building 300 has been gutted, said Shirley
Chen, the project manager.

Half of the building used to be a two
story lecture hall; the rest consisted of
offices. During the remodeling, workers
are extending the second floor across the
entire building to create more office
space, Chen said. The ground floor will
contain a smaller lecture hall and a semi
nar room.
In Building 310, which consisted of
offices before the earthquake, a second
floor is being added for more office space.

walls will be taken down so they can be
reinforced. The sandstone will be
replaced.
The repair process will be slightly dif
ferent for some of the columns in the
arcade. Some columns in the arcades
have been replaced with pre-cast rein
forced concrete. Chen said, "It will look
like sandstone" and will be "molded to
match the texture and color" of the origi
nal.
Work on the earthquake-damaged
Language and Geology corners has not
yet begun because the University still has
not concluded its negotiations with the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which is responsible for disaster
relief.
But there are some preliminary indica
tions that they will agree with the general
plans for reconstructing Green library —
one of the largest repair projects,
Williams said.
"I think that by another three months
we will pretty much know where we
stand" in terms of what the federal agen-

cy will pay, he added.
Williams also said he expected that
there would be several areas in which the
University might not easily reach an
agreement with the federal agency, par
ticularly in the cases of Language and
Geology corners.
The issue concerns which building
code will govern the repair of the two cor
ners. The University wants to follow the
Uniform Building Code, but the federal
agency wants to use a more lenient Santa

Clara County ordinance that
would "allow a less costly fix,"
Williams said.
While the Santa Clara rules
would provide an adequate
life-safety level and the build
ings wouldn't fall down in
another severe earthquake, the
University fears they might
have to be closed for repairs in
that event, Williams said.
He added that buildings
repaired under the stricter
Uniform code could probably

be reoccupied much sooner after an
earthquake.
Williams said there is an appeal pro
cess if the federal agency does not accept
Stanford's plans for the corners.
The University is also continuing its
new construction programs. Kimball Hall
is still scheduled to open on time in early
September. Currently workers are
"scrambling to finish" the building, said
Pieron.
What remains to be completed are
some of the interior furnishings and other
work on the outside of the building. The
county must also make its final inspec
tion.
On the nearby Manzanita II project,
demolition of the current site has begun.
All of the trailers at the location have
been removed, and Pieron said he expects
digging to begin toward the end of
August.
He added that he does not anticipate
any difficulty in meeting Manzanita ll's
scheduled opening date of September
1992.

structure so it will resist further earth
quake damage.
The repairs involve adding shear walls
to the side of the building that faces Serra
Street. The other end has already been
completed. The area under construction
is currently closed off.
Facilities Project Management is tak
ing the damage to Buildings 30() and 310
as an opportunity to remodel the build
ings' interiors. The entire inside of
Building 300 has been gutted, said Shirley
Chen, the project manager.

Half of the building used to be a two
story lecture hall; the rest consisted of
offices. During the remodeling, workers
are extending the second floor across the
entire building to create more office
space, Chen said. The ground floor will
contain a smaller lecture hall and a semi
nar room.
In Building 310, which consisted of
offices before the earthquake, a second
floor is being added for more office space.

walls will be taken down so they can be
reinforced. The sandstone will be
replaced.
The repair process will be slightly dif
ferent for some of the columns in the
arcade. Some columns in the arcades
have been replaced with pre-cast rein
forced concrete. Chen said, "It will look
like sandstone" and will be "molded to
match the texture and color" of the origi
nal.
Work on the earthquake-damaged
Language and Geology corners has not
yet begun because the University still has
not concluded its negotiations with the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which is responsible for disaster
relief.
But there are some preliminary indica
tions that they will agree with the general
plans for reconstructing Green library —
one of the largest repair projects,
Williams said.
"I think that by another three months
we will pretty much know where we
stand" in terms of what the federal agen-

cy will pay, he added.
Williams also said he expected that
there would be several areas in which the
University might not easily reach an
agreement with the federal agency, par
ticularly in the cases of Language and
Geology corners.
The issue concerns which building
code will govern the repair of the two cor
ners. The University wants to follow the
Uniform Building Code, but the federal
agency wants to use a more lenient Santa

Clara County ordinance that
would "allow a less costly fix,"
Williams said.
While the Santa Clara rules
would provide an adequate
life-safety level and the build
ings wouldn't fall down in
another severe earthquake, the
University fears they might
have to be closed for repairs in
that event, Williams said.
He added that buildings
repaired under the stricter
Uniform code could probably

be reoccupied much sooner after an
earthquake.
Williams said there is an appeal pro
cess if the federal agency does not accept
Stanford's plans for the corners.
The University is also continuing its
new construction programs. Kimball Hall
is still scheduled to open on time in early
September. Currently workers are
"scrambling to finish" the building, said
Pieron.
What remains to be completed are
some of the interior furnishings and other
work on the outside of the building. The
county must also make its final inspec
tion.
On the nearby Manzanita II project,
demolition of the current site has begun.
All of the trailers at the location have
been removed, and Pieron said he expects
digging to begin toward the end of
August.
He added that he does not anticipate
any difficulty in meeting Manzanita ll's
scheduled opening date of September
1992.

Marty Belea,

Richards dismantle

scaffolding on the arch

leading into the west side of the

Quad. Repair work has begun in earnest this summer, especially
on Memorial Church. The church roof will be removed, tile by tile,
and strengthened with plywood sheeting.

Sometime in the next few weeks, the
serenity of the Inner Quad is going
to be shattered — by a crane.
As the long task of rebuilding
Memorial Church begins in earnest, con
struction workers will lift heavy metal
structural supports for the church.
They will also begin removing sections
of the roof, tile by tile.
The work on the church is only one of
the major repair and new construction
projects that have shifted into high gear
this summer.
"We've had a number of projects, and
a number are just getting to the point
where they're going into construction,"
said Facilities Project Management
Director Curt Williams.
Construction has been stepped up on
several earthquake-damaged buildings,
the portals in the Quad and the Graduate
School of Business.
In addition, repair work on Buildings
310 and 300 — on either side of the
church — and Building 500 — behind the
Quad — began recently.
The work on the church may be the
most involved and visible of this summer's
projects.
"We are almost building a new build
ing," said Williams.
Removing the roof will allow workers
to install a new fire sprinkler system and a
roof diaphragm.
The roof diaphragm consists of ply
wood sheeting and is designed to bind
together the walls on the roof, said
Olivier Pieron, project manager for the
church construction. He described it as
putting "a lid on the box."
The tiles will be replaced on top of the
plywood sheeting, Pieron added. This
part of the project will probably be com
pleted by November.
The crane will be used to begin the
structural repairs to the church. Pieron
said it will be used to place the very
heavy metal frame for reinforced con
crete inside the walls of the Church's
crossing.
None of the reinforcements will be vis
ible after the project's completion, sched

uled for early next year, Pieron said.
After the major structural reinforce
ments are complete, the University also
plans to replace the church's old mecha
nized heating system and install a new
sound system.
In addition, some of the artwork and
painted surfaces in the church, which
Pieron said are cracked and"in fairly bad
shape," will be repaired under the super
vision of Leslie Bone of the De Young
Museum in San Francisco.

Williams said the church
reconstruction is on schedule and
will be completed by the start of
school in 1992. It may even be
sooner, he added.
The Quad portals will definit
ley be completed much sooner —
by September. "The portals were
key" because of their involvement
in the Centennial Celebration,
Williams said. The project
involves repairing and strengthen
ing the structure inside the walls.
Some foundation work also has to
be done, he added.

The Centennial Celebration will put a
short brake on the construction projects.
Williams said his office is "planning
around" the festivities and "construction
activity will shut down during this peri
od."
At the Graduate School of Business,
work continues on the second part of a
two-year seismic strengthening project.

to the building was repaired last year, the
