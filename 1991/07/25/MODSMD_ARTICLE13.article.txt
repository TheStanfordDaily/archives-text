## Sexual conduct policy in works 
### 
The University is creating a
broad new policy on unacceptable
sexual conduct that will cover a
wide range of objectionable
behaviors and will replace the cur
rent sexual harassment policy.
The new policy will accord with
the recommendations put forth in
the Sexual Assault Task Force
report. It will also comply with
state law, which — as of last Jan
uary — requires post-secondary
schools to implement clear and
consistent assault policies and
adopt written procedures ensur
ing that students, faculty and staff
who are victims of sexual assault
receive appropriate treatment
and information.
Unacceptable sexual conduct,
as defined by the report, can
range from gender-insensitive
comments to sexual harassment to
rape. It is unclear, however,
whether such actions will be
specifically described and defined
in the policy.
University officials working on
the policy have not yet addressed
whether it will be outlined by spe
cific illustrations or by general
description, according to Acting
Vice President for Student
Resources Sally Mahoney.
University Counsel Susan
Hoerger and Judicial Affairs Offi
cer Sally Cole began formulating
the new policy soon after the task
force recommendations were
released in February. They com
pleted the draft statement last
week and passed it on to Mahoney
and Vice President for Human
Resources Barbara Butterfield,
who will review and possibly
revise the policy before presenting
it to University President Donald
Kennedy for approval.
The first section of the new
policy will closely resemble that of
the existing sexual harassment
policy, stating Stanford's commit
ment to maintaining an environ
ment free of sexual harassment
and other forms of unacceptable
sexual conduct, she said.
Hoerger added that the policy
will probably use a definition of
unacceptable sexual behavior sim
ilar to the one put forth in the task
force report, which recognizes
that "there is a range of sexual
conduct that is unacceptable in
the Stanford community."
The second, procedural section
of the policy will be designed to
insure that victims of sexual
assault or harassment get infor
mation about the resources avail
able to them — including counsel
ing, legal assistance and medical
help, both on and off-campus —
as specified in Assembly Bill No.
3098, which was passed one year
ago and took effect Jan. 1.
Although the University
already fulfilled many of the act's
requirements, no single policy
existed that contained all the nec
essary information.
Hoerger said the University
also intends to make information
on procedures, such as filing a
grievance, more widely available
so students "won't need to know a
special password to find out about
resources."
She added that sexual harass
ment can have the same kind of
debilitating effect on a woman's
ego as sexual assault.
The exact procedure by which
the policy will be approved has
not been determined, Mahoney
said. The document may be pre
sented to the University cabinet
for review before Kennedy
approves it. However, it is unclear
whether the cabinet's approval is
necessary.
