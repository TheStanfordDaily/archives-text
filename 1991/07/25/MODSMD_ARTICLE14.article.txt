# Hoover toasts its 50th year
## 
### 
Hoover scholars, distinguished
visitors and more than 500 invited
guests celebrated Hoover Tower's
50th birthday last Thursday with
an afternoon of champagne toasts
and commemorative speeches.
Sitting under a giant tent
before the steps of the 285-foot
sandstone tower that has become
a symbol of the University, the
guests feasted at buffet tables and
heard speeches by Gov. Pete Wil
son, Hoover Director John
Raisian, University President
Donald Kennedy and the grand
son of former President Herbert
Hoover, Herbert Hoover 111.
Among the guests were Distin
guished Hoover Fellow and for
mer Secretary of State George
Shultz and former Gov. George
Deukmejian.
Wilson addressed the cele
brants in a 20-minute speech filled
with grim humor about Sacra
mento politics. He discussed the
utility of compassionate and cre
ative conservatism.
Recalling Hoover's campaign
to save the starving children of
Europe after World War I, Wilson
outlined the challenge of meeting
the needs of today's children. "We
can, as compassionate conserva
tives like Herbert Hoover, alter
the conditions of our children and
shape California's future."
Kennedy praised the work of
Hoover scholars, saying, "The
Hoover Institution is helping to
make Stanford a pioneering insti
tution It is an incalculable
asset to the University commu
nity."
He also extended his personal
gratitude to Raisian, who has
been Hoover director since 1990.
Raisian has been credited by
many scholars with improving
relations between Hoover and the
University.
But Raisian's predecessor, the
controversial W. Glenn Campbell,
also received attention. Wilson
said, "What you've done for the

Hoover Institution is no less than
what Wallace Sterling did for
Stanford — you brought it great
ness."
The afternoon's speeches
included extensive discussion of
Hoover's role in organizing and
directing the relief and recon
struction efforts for the victims of
war and revolution throughout
Europe and Russia.
Herbert Hoover 111, grandson
of the president who was a mem
ber of Stanford's first class, intro
duced an original tape recording
from the 1941 dedication cere
mony. He discussed his grandfa
ther's commitment to alleviating
the suffering caused by violence.
"We must study and restudy the
lessons assigned by war," he said,
"if we are to make meaningful
progress towards achieving a last
ing peace."
Hoover founded the library at
Stanford in 1919 as a specialized
collection of books and docu
ments on World War I and inter
national humanitarian aid. He
intended the Institution to be a
center for the study of the causes
and consequences of war and rev
olution and the problems of
peace.
Hoover Tower was built in 1941
to house the Institution's office,
library and growing archives.
