# Quake experts to gather here

### 
In the event of an earthquake,
two buildings with identical archi
tecture — standing equidistant
from the epicenter — can sustain
vastly different levels of damage.
While this phenomenon is not
completely understood, re
searchers can now identify many
of the factors contributing to such
discrepancies. By passing on such
information, they can better equip
policy-makers and engineers to
minimize the death tolls and eco
nomic costs of earthquakes.
The latest research in this area
will be discussed at Stanford Aug.

25-30, when scientists and urban
planners from around the globe
gather for the Fourth Interna
tional Conference on Seismic
Zonation.
Sponsored by the Earthquake
Engineering Research Institute of
Oakland and funded by the
National Science Foundation, the
conference will give researchers
an opportunity to exchange infor
mation on better ways to plan
cities based on the latest earth
quake research.
"Today, we know why earth
quake damage occurs in one area
of a city and not another. If we can
get that information to cities and
other governments, they can bet
ter decide where to put a play
ground and where to put a hospi
tal," said Civil Engineering Prof.
Haresh Shah, co-chair of the con
ference.
The research is based on seis
mic zoning, a practice that draws
upon various technical fields to
identify areas at particular risk in
earthquakes. A number of factors
— such as subsurface soil condi
tions — can determine the extent
of damage to a building and
explain why buildings with identi
cal architecture can sustain widely
disparate levels of damage.
This information can aid urban
planners and policy-makers in
determining which buildings are
in greatest need of structural rein
forcement to prevent earthquake
damage.
The Marina district in San
Francisco, which sustained major
damage in the Loma Prieta earth
quake of 1989, is an example of a
neighborhood that could have
been identified as a hazard zone,
said Civil Engineering Prof. Hel
mut Krawinkler, co-chair of the
committee organizing the confer
ence.
The five major temblors in
recent years — in Mexico City in
1985, Armenia, Australia and the
Bay Area in 1989 and the Philip
pines in 1990 - left virtually no
doubt that earthquake damage is
highly localized and dependent on
numerous factors, said conference
co-chair Roger Borcherdt, an

engineering seismologist at the
United States Geological Survey.
This shows that damage could
be reduced by more precise seis
mic hazard mapping, he added.
As part of the International
Decade for Natural Hazard
Reduction, the United Nations
and many individual countries are
investing considerable resources
into reducing earthquake risk.
