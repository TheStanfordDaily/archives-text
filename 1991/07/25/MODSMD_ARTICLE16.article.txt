# Police recover stolen stereos
## 
### 
A Palo Alto informant has led
to the recovery of computer and
stereo equipment stolen from
Stanford, San Jose State Universi
ty and various locations in Palo
Alto, according to Stanford Police
Detective Sgt. Del Bandy.
Based on the informant's
knowledge, police obtained a
search warrant for the Palo Alto
home of former San Jose State
student Brian Caldwell, where
they found stolen stereo and com
puter equipment, Bandy said.
During questioning, Caldwell
told police that additional stolen
goods were at the San Jose home
of Wallace Lee and Lester Fong,
Caldwell's former roommates.
A search of Lee and Fong's
home uncovered more equipment,
also allegedly stolen from Stan
ford and San Jose State.
The police are currently
attempting to match the serial
numbers of the recovered goods
with those reported stolen in past
cases. Until this process is com
pleted, there is no way of knowing
exactly what equipment has been
found, Bandy said.
In addition, many of the stolen
goods have already been sold.
However, Caldwell admitted to
stealing equipment from several
Stanford departments, such as
Electrical Engineering and Aero
nautics and Astronautics, police
said. He also confessed to burglar
izing a Stanford fraternity, though
he could not remember which
one, Bandy added.
