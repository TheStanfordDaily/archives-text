Business School Lecturer
Richard Pascale has admitted that
parts of his recent book on corpo
rate management were copied
without permission from a 1986
magazine article.
In two chapters of his 1990
book, "Managing on the Edge:
How the Smartest Companies Use
Conflict to Stay Ahead," Pascale
lifts several passages almost verba
tim from a 1986 Washington
Monthly article by Gregg Easter
brook, a Newsweek and Atlantic
magazine correspondent. Excerpts
of Pascale's book containing
copied material were printed in
the September 1990 issue of the
Stanford Business School Maga
zine.
Pascale, who is also a San Fran
cisco-based management consul
tant, did not return phone calls
yesterday. But he told The Wash
ington Post last week, "I made a
major, major mistake.
"I did not mean to deceive the
reader.... I thought very highly of
Easterbrook's writing and I used
it as a guideline."
The works in question concern
management and institutional
changes at Ford Motor Company
and particularly focus on Donald
Petersen, the company's president
at the time.
Chapter 5 of Pascale's work
begins, "On a dark day in 1980,
Donald Petersen, the newly cho
sen president of Ford Motor Com
pany, visited the company's
Detroit design studios. That year,
Ford would lose $2.2 billion, the
largest loss in a single year in U.S.
corporate history. Petersen could
see no light at the end of the tun
nel."
Easterbrook's article, titled
"Have you driven a Ford lately?
Thanks to Donald Petersen you
may want to," opens with an
almost identical statement, "On a
very dark day in 1980, Donald
Petersen, newly chosen president
of Ford Motors, visited the com
pany design studios. Ford was in
the process of losing $2.2 billion,
the largest single-year corporate
loss in U.S. history. The future
seemed equally bleak."
The University was notified of
the copying in April by Robert
Levering, co-author of the "100
Best Companies to Work For in
America," after he noticed the
similarities in the Business School
Magazine article and Easter
brook's article.
"The Business School immedi
ate began an investigation as spec
ified by University rules," accord
ing to a statement. A faculty com
mittee has made a preliminary
investigation of the issue and sub
mitted its report to Dean A.
Michael Spence.
Spence is out of town and will
review the report when he
returns, officials said.
Easterbrook described the
extent of the copying as "about
three pages.
"I was pretty surprised by the
extent of his plagiarism," he said.
"It's the kind of thing you'd be
very surprised to see from a stu
dent" and wouldn't expect to see
in a commercial book.
He said Pascale called him to
explain that the copying was a
misunderstanding and that he
thought the article was going to
run with footnotes.
Easterbrook said he was
"almost tempted to believe" the
explanation that the credits in the
article were deleted. There are
footnotes referring to Easter
brook in the book, but he is not
mentioned in the text.
Furthermore, "footnotes have
nothing to do with it," Easter
brook said.

It appears that Pascale knew
that the article would run without
footnotes. The magazine's "usual
policy is that we show the writer
when we excerpt" from a larger
work, said editor Cathy Castillo.
"We followed this policy."
Easterbrook said he was also
skeptical of Pascale's claim
because much of the copied text
was subtly altered, something that
wouldn't be done if credit were
inadvertently omitted.
After reviewing Pascale's text,
Easterbrook originally asked for
an admission of what happened
and requested that Pascale
promptly notify the publisher,
Simon and Schuster, so the pur
loined text would be either
deleted or properly credited.
He said Pascale did call him to
apologize.
Since then, Easterbrook has
changed his mind. Last week, he
asked Simon and Schuster Vice
President Dan Farley for a mone
tary settlement. _ _ ,,
