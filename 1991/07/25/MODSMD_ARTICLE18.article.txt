Petersen had come to the
design center to review pro
posals for a new Thunderbird.
Once a breath of fresh air in
Ford's line, the Thunderbird
had become about as exciting
as a cement truck.
"He was shown the cus
tomary sketches of the big
boring boxes," said one
source. "Ford designers, truth
be told, hated their own
designs. Year after year they
had championed daring ideas
and been shot down by top
management. There was only
one kind of car that headquar

Last Year's."

Petersen had come to
review proposals for a new
Thunderbird — the model had
been Ford's flagship but
through the 1970s had grown
about as exciting as a tuna
trawler. He was shown the
customary sketches of big,
boring boxes. Ford designers,
truth be told, hated their own
designs. Often they had tried
to propose interesting cars
like the Europeans and
Japanese were building. Top
management always shot
them down. There was only
one kind of car headquarters
wanted to hear about: A Car
Just Like Last Year's.
