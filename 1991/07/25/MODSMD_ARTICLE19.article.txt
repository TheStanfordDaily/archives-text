# University too slow, says USW
## 
### 
Controversy is beginning to
bubble in the University-United
Stanford Workers contract negoti
ations.
University negotiators are
dragging their feet on responding
to the July 12 USW proposal, said
Michael Tatham, the union's
negotiator.
"We hemmed and hawed and
yelled" before they agreed to have
it done by Saturday, he said. The
University response was due
tomorrow, he added.
But according to chief Univer
sity negotiator Michael Vartain,
the actual deadline is Sunday, or
"15 days after the USW team sub
mitted" its proposal.
"We are adhering to the
agreed-on schedule," Vartain
said. He chose not to comment
further, in order to "keep negotia
tions at the table" and out of the
media, he said.
Tatham said the delay displeas
es him. "We feel they may be slip
ping back into their old pattern of
arrogance," he said.
"The University has a whole
history of not moving until the gun
is pointed at its head."
Josie Saldana, a graduate stu
dent on the USW bargaining
team, said the three meetings
before Tuesday's had gone
smoothly. She added that she
missed the Tuesday session, in
which the conflict over the Uni
versity's counterproposal deadline
arose.
Vartain had implied that the
union would receive the Universi
ty's counterproposal Tuesday, she

said. But, "Vartain speaks very
evasively," she added.
The USW has been preparing
for a possible strike since 1988,
Tatham said. So far, $250,000 sits
in a fund for that purpose. But a
strike is a last resort, he said.
Job security was the main issue
in last Friday's meeting.
Both sides say it is too early to
predict the outcome of negotia
tions.
