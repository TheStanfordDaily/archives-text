# Weightlifters get an apology
## 
### 
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom
Beckett and Encina Weight Room
Manager Chris Horpel last night
apologized for not communicating
with weightlifters about current
remodeling in Encina Gym.
Many weightlifters have com
plained about the Department of
Athletics* decision to convert part
of the Encina weight room into a

conference area for the football
team. They said the work was
begun without warning and with
out attention to their opinions and
suggestions regarding the change.
Speaking to a crowd of about
20 recreational weightlifters in the
weight room, Beckett gave a run
down of recreational weightlift
ing's history at Stanford, saying
that manager Horpel has been a
persistent advocate for improved
maintenance, new equipment and
increased space for recreational
lifting.
Since the gymnastics teams'
facilities were moved to the Ford
Center and Burnham Pavilion, the
Athletics Department has been
deliberating about how to best use
the space made available, Beckett
said. Some of it has gone to the
crew team, and some was occu
pied by recreational weightlifters,
he added
However, Beckett said that the
department has decided to sup
port the football team as much as
possible and that providing the
team with a place to meet is a
necessity. The team has long
lacked a meeting place and has
met in such odd places as the
Education Building in 1983 and a
tent behind Maples Pavilion just
last year, he said.
Horpel and Beckett also spoke
of the Athletics Department's
long-term plans to construct a
new building with improved recre
ational weightlifting and fitness
facilities.
For the meantime, however,
they noted several changes
planned for Encina by fall quarter,
including such improvements as
three-quarter-inch plywood rein
forcement and new rubber mat
ting for Encina's free weight
areas. Beckett and Horpel dis
played a copy of the plan for the
new layout.
The reason for the allocation of
space to the football team was
clarified by Political Science Prof.
David Brady, chair of the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation. He

said money from student and fac
ulty fees for recreational athletics
are spent largely on intramural
athletics, not on facilities such as
Encina.
Because the Athletics Depart
ment is largely self-supporting,
relying on donations and ticket
sales revenue for the majority of
its budget, the success of the foot
ball team is critical to the depart
ment's financial survival.
