# Webb receives eight trailers

The University has donated
eight mobile homes from Man
zanita Park for migrant-worker
housing at Webb Ranch, a pri
vately owned farm which leases
Stanford land.
The trailers had to be removed
to make room for the the first of
two planned dormitories adjacent
to Kimball Hall, the University's
newly completed student housing
project, which is scheduled to
open this fall.
The University offered the
mobile homes free of charge to
anyone who would pay their trans
portation cost, and all of the 41
trailers removed this summer have
been claimed.
This contrasts with a similar
program last summer, which
offered 21 motor homes that had
to be cleared before work on Kim
ball could begin. Few trailers were
taken, however, and all but three
of the units were demolished.
Beside the eight trailers taken
to the ranch, 11 were taken by the
Anderson Valley Housing Associ
ation, three by the Colusa Farm
Bureau, six by Glenn Curtice
Trucking and 12 by Vivitech of
San Leandro.
One more mobile home will be
moved across campus to the
Equestrian Center as a home for
its caretaker.
