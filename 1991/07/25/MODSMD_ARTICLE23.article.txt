# Coming soon to a stadium near you...
## 
### Steve McCarroll 
Barnett Lipton thinks big.
At the age of 39, the energetic, red-haired
entrepreneur has had a hand in some of recent
memory's largest spectacles. Lipton managed the opening
and closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in
Los Angeles. He produced the ticker tape parade in New
York City for the soldiers returning from the Gulf war. He
traveled to San Diego in 1988 to design the gala halftime
show for Super Bowl XXII.

But Stanford has
been the focus of
Lipton's attention
for much of the last
year. Flying between
his Madison Avenue
office in New York
and the University's
Centennial head
quarters, Lipton has
planned an event
that may overshadow
anything in the
school's 100-year
history for sheer
spectacle: the Sta
dium Spectacular
that will culminate
Stanford's Centen
nial Celebration.
Lipton, the presi
dent of Eventures,
an event-planning
company, has lined
up an impressive
cast of entertainers
and public figures
for the stadium
show, which will take

place Monday, Sept. 30. Ted Koppel will be
the master of ceremonies. Whoopi
Goldberg, Bobby McFerrin, flutist James
Galway, Joan Baez, the Doobie Brothers and
others will perform.
The spectators who will fill Stanford
Stadium can expect a celebration in trade
mark Lipton style: with drama, flair and
plenty of fireworks.
"The event will provide a level of drama
and pageantry that people won't soon for
get," says Centennial Celebration Director
Stephen Peeps.
But the big names and the dramatic agen
da mask the attention to detail and depth of
study that characterize Lipton's work.
For Lipton has studied Stanford for near
ly a year now. Conducting focus groups and
interviews with students, alumni, faculty and
staff, Lipton has tried to understand how
people at Stanford see.the University.
Lipton says he wants to create a show that
will resonate with all that people find special,
interesting and real about Stanford. More
than produce a gala event, he wants to cap
ture a moment in Stanford's history.
"Fifty and 100 years from now, people will
look back and say, 'How did Stanford see
itself at that point in its history?'" Lipton
says. The tone of Stanford's Centennial

Celebration will
leave an archival
message that Lip
ton wants "to be as
meaningful as pos
sible."
So Lipton be
gan the year by sub
scribing to campus
publications and
doing research,
studying the issues
and ideas that dom
inate campus dia
logue and the
themes that run
through the Un
iversity's history.
That's taken a
fair amount of
reading.
But more im
portant, Lipton says,
it has taken a lot of
listening to the feel
ings of those who
make up the Stan
ford community.
"What's impor

tant to you about Stanford?" he pressed par
ticipants in the 15-person focus groups that
he and an assistant have conducted at the
University this year. "What's important for
people to know about this university?"
The responses have surprised and fasci
nated Lipton, who has done a number of his
torical commemorations. For one thing,
Lipton has found, Stanford students and fac
ulty view the University's histo

ry with a realism unaffected by
their desire for celebration.
"People at Stanford don't
want a glorified version of their
history," he says.
In particular, Lipton says,
minority students don't want a
production that glosses over
either Leland Stanford's use of
Asian-American laborers on
the railroad or eras of racial
discrimination in Stanford's
history.
Nor will the show gloss over
the University's present prob
lems. "We want to try to cap
ture what's on people's minds
right now," says Lipton, men
tioning financial austerity and
the federal investigation of the

University's indirect-cost practices.
"People at this university give hard looks
at things," he continues, "and acting like the
University had somehow reached a state of
perfection would come across as hollow."
Instead, Lipton plans for the production
to celebrate the challenges that the
University has confronted in its 100-year his
tory — difficulties, Lipton says, that put
today's situation in perspective.
"Stanford has weathered a lot in 100
years," Lipton says."It will weather this. The
point is to learn from it and move on. You

face adversity and you
grow to meet the chal
lenge."

Star-studded cast
Looking through his
reframed tortoise-shell
glasses, with a gold
Centennial pin glisten
ing on the lapel of his
blue, pin striped, dou
ble-breasted suit,
Lipton seems undaunt
ed by the challenges of
putting on such a large
event.
With enthusiastic
confidence, Lipton

describes the night's lineup. Folk legend
Joan Baez, cabaret performer Michael
Feinstein and the jazz fusion group
Hiroshima will perform. Flutist James
Galway will play a duet with Grammy-win
ning singer Bobby McFerrin. Former San
Francisco 49ers and Stanford coach Bill

Walsh, two-time Olympic decathlon champi
on Bob Mathias, and former Stanford and
49er quarterback Frankie Albert also will
make appearances.
But Lipton is quick to point out that he
doesn't measure success in names and that
what he is striving to create is not a gala line
up of stars but a commemoration that is
uniquely Stanford's own.
"It will not be a 'show,' " Lipton says."It
will be an event that in the most literal sense
is of and by Stanford."
The choice of entertainers reflects

For one thing, Lipton has found, Stanford
students and faculty view the University's
history with a realism unaffected by their
desire for celebration. 'People at Stanford
don't want a glorified version of their history.'

Lipton's desire "to best express certain
aspects of the history of the University."
A long and carefully studied decision
making process went, for example, into the
selection of Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg will
perform a dramatic reading about Jane
Stanford's life.

"Jane Stanford was an interesting woman,
someone way ahead of her time," Lipton says
of his research on the life of the University's
co-founder. For this performance Lipton
wanted "someone who was a feminist, who
came from nowhere, who has a history of
supporting the same kinds of causes."
Goldberg stood out.
Koppel, a Stanford graduate, was an obvi
ous choice for master of ceremonies, he says.
Stanford's diverse student body and con
cern for multiculturalism also made the
selection of a multi-ethnic cast a priority.

The challenge,
Lipton says, was not to
line up a series of big
names, but to weave per
formers into the history
of the University — a
history which Lipton
enjoyed studying.
"The history of this
university is just abso
lutely fascinating — a
very, very colorful histo
ry. A lot got done here
that probably could have
been done only here."
The focus groups
also gave Lipton a sensi
tivity for the desire of var

ious groups to play a part in the celebration —
in particular Stanford's staff and alumni.
"It is important for the alums to have the
sense that they are involved and presented by
the University," says Lipton. And that, Lipton
says, does not mean just the famous alumni.
"There arc lots of alums who have done a

lot but who don't have name recognition,"
Lipton says. So the event will include a
speech by Dana Winters — an alumnus who
graduated "sometime in the '30s — no one
remembers exactly when," Lipton jokes.
In a humorous presentation, Winters will
talk about "what it's like to come back after
50 years and have done nothing," he says.
Events with a message
That's not a problem that Lipton would
have if he returned to his alma mater today.
After graduating from New York University,
where he majored in scenic design, Lipton
began his career as an event organizer by
producing small concerts in New York and
New Jersey.
He went on to produce a number of sports
and music festivals and two World's Fairs.
After his work with the Olympics, he was
hired as a senior producer for Radio City
Music Hall.
But the gala events didn't quite satisfy

Lipton, who started Eventures two years ago.
"What started to appeal to me were things
that had a message," he says.
Since then, Eventures has produced the
largest tickertape parade in New York City's
history, the opening ceremonies for the
Goodwill Games and the "We the People"
parade in Philadelphia, which commemorat
ed the bicentennial of the Constitution.
This summer the corporation is also work
ing on Polaroid's tribute to Edwin Land, its
founder. Revealing the thorough research
that is his trademark, Lipton discusses
Land's background, his accomplishments, his
corporate philosophy.
And Lipton has a corporate philosophy of
his own. "Our goal is to bring a little light to
people," he says."The best part about events
is that they bring people together.
"Things that bring large numbers of peo
ple together create an enormous amount of
energy," adds the energetic Lipton.
They also make money — a concern which

has not dominated planning of the celebra
tion but isn't far from Lipton's mind.
"This event is designed to raise money for
the University, not to cost it money," he says.
The money will be raised through corporate
sponsorship and through the sale of tickets,
which will cost $15 for Stanford students,
faculty and staff, and $25 for the outside
community.
"At a time when money's tight, we do not
want to be adding more strain" to the
University's finances, Lipton adds.
In the next few months, Lipton will face
an imposing organizational challenge.
Eventures will have to coordinate the crew
that will translate Lipton's blueprint and pull
off the Stadium Spectacular.
"Big moments grow out of a lot of little
things," says this orchestrator of big events
who hasn't lost his fascination with detail.
"If it's realized as well as it should be,
Stanford will understand itself a little bet
ter."

"Things that bring large numbers of peo
ple together create an enormous amount of
energy," adds the energetic Lipton.
They also make money — a concern which

has not dominated planning of the celebra
tion but isn't far from Lipton's mind.
"This event is designed to raise money for
the University, not to cost it money," he says.
The money will be raised through corporate
sponsorship and through the sale of tickets,
which will cost $15 for Stanford students,
faculty and staff, and $25 for the outside
community.
"At a time when money's tight, we do not
want to be adding more strain" to the
University's finances, Lipton adds.
In the next few months, Lipton will face
an imposing organizational challenge.
Eventures will have to coordinate the crew
that will translate Lipton's blueprint and pull
off the Stadium Spectacular.
"Big moments grow out of a lot of little
things," says this orchestrator of big events
who hasn't lost his fascination with detail.
"If it's realized as well as it should be,

The Stadium
Spectacular and the
opening ceremony of
the 1984 Olympics
have creative
entrepreneur Barnett
Upton in common.
Lipton also produced
the largest ticker tape
parade in New York
City's history for veter
ans of the Persian Gulf
war, the opening cere
monies for the
Goodwill Games and
Philadelphia's "We the
People" parade, which
commemorated the
Constitution's bicen
tennial.

The set of the Stadium Spectacular fea
tures three Centennial logo-shaped video
screens that will project images from
Stanford history, as well as performers on
stage who will present dramatic readings,
musical performances and anecdotes
chronicling the University's past.
Barnett Lipton thinks big.
At the age of 39, the energetic, red-haired
entrepreneur has had a hand in some of recent
memory's largest spectacles. Lipton managed the opening
and closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in
Los Angeles. He produced the ticker tape parade in New
York City for the soldiers returning from the Gulf war. He
traveled to San Diego in 1988 to design the gala halftime
show for Super Bowl XXII.

But Stanford has
been the focus of
Lipton's attention
for much of the last
year. Flying between
his Madison Avenue
office in New York
and the University's
Centennial head
quarters, Lipton has
planned an event
that may overshadow
anything in the
school's 100-year
history for sheer
spectacle: the Sta
dium Spectacular
that will culminate
Stanford's Centen
nial Celebration.
Lipton, the presi
dent of Eventures,
an event-planning
company, has lined
up an impressive
cast of entertainers
and public figures
for the stadium
show, which will take

place Monday, Sept. 30. Ted Koppel will be
the master of ceremonies. Whoopi
Goldberg, Bobby McFerrin, flutist James
Galway, Joan Baez, the Doobie Brothers and
others will perform.
The spectators who will fill Stanford
Stadium can expect a celebration in trade
mark Lipton style: with drama, flair and
plenty of fireworks.
"The event will provide a level of drama
and pageantry that people won't soon for
get," says Centennial Celebration Director
Stephen Peeps.
But the big names and the dramatic agen
da mask the attention to detail and depth of
study that characterize Lipton's work.
For Lipton has studied Stanford for near
ly a year now. Conducting focus groups and
interviews with students, alumni, faculty and
staff, Lipton has tried to understand how
people at Stanford see.the University.
Lipton says he wants to create a show that
will resonate with all that people find special,
interesting and real about Stanford. More
than produce a gala event, he wants to cap
ture a moment in Stanford's history.
"Fifty and 100 years from now, people will
look back and say, 'How did Stanford see
itself at that point in its history?'" Lipton
says. The tone of Stanford's Centennial

Celebration will
leave an archival
message that Lip
ton wants "to be as
meaningful as pos
sible."
So Lipton be
gan the year by sub
scribing to campus
publications and
doing research,
studying the issues
and ideas that dom
inate campus dia
logue and the
themes that run
through the Un
iversity's history.
That's taken a
fair amount of
reading.
But more im
portant, Lipton says,
it has taken a lot of
listening to the feel
ings of those who
make up the Stan
ford community.
"What's impor

tant to you about Stanford?" he pressed par
ticipants in the 15-person focus groups that
he and an assistant have conducted at the
University this year. "What's important for
people to know about this university?"
The responses have surprised and fasci
nated Lipton, who has done a number of his
torical commemorations. For one thing,
Lipton has found, Stanford students and fac
ulty view the University's histo

ry with a realism unaffected by
their desire for celebration.
"People at Stanford don't
want a glorified version of their
history," he says.
In particular, Lipton says,
minority students don't want a
production that glosses over
either Leland Stanford's use of
Asian-American laborers on
the railroad or eras of racial
discrimination in Stanford's
history.
Nor will the show gloss over
the University's present prob
lems. "We want to try to cap
ture what's on people's minds
right now," says Lipton, men
tioning financial austerity and
the federal investigation of the

University's indirect-cost practices.
"People at this university give hard looks
at things," he continues, "and acting like the
University had somehow reached a state of
perfection would come across as hollow."
Instead, Lipton plans for the production
to celebrate the challenges that the
University has confronted in its 100-year his
tory — difficulties, Lipton says, that put
today's situation in perspective.
"Stanford has weathered a lot in 100
years," Lipton says."It will weather this. The
point is to learn from it and move on. You

face adversity and you
grow to meet the chal
lenge."

Star-studded cast
Looking through his
reframed tortoise-shell
glasses, with a gold
Centennial pin glisten
ing on the lapel of his
blue, pin striped, dou
ble-breasted suit,
Lipton seems undaunt
ed by the challenges of
putting on such a large
event.
With enthusiastic
confidence, Lipton

describes the night's lineup. Folk legend
Joan Baez, cabaret performer Michael
Feinstein and the jazz fusion group
Hiroshima will perform. Flutist James
Galway will play a duet with Grammy-win
ning singer Bobby McFerrin. Former San
Francisco 49ers and Stanford coach Bill

Walsh, two-time Olympic decathlon champi
on Bob Mathias, and former Stanford and
49er quarterback Frankie Albert also will
make appearances.
But Lipton is quick to point out that he
doesn't measure success in names and that
what he is striving to create is not a gala line
up of stars but a commemoration that is
uniquely Stanford's own.
"It will not be a 'show,' " Lipton says."It
will be an event that in the most literal sense
is of and by Stanford."
The choice of entertainers reflects

For one thing, Lipton has found, Stanford
students and faculty view the University's
history with a realism unaffected by their
desire for celebration. 'People at Stanford
don't want a glorified version of their history.'

Lipton's desire "to best express certain
aspects of the history of the University."
A long and carefully studied decision
making process went, for example, into the
selection of Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg will
perform a dramatic reading about Jane
Stanford's life.

"Jane Stanford was an interesting woman,
someone way ahead of her time," Lipton says
of his research on the life of the University's
co-founder. For this performance Lipton
wanted "someone who was a feminist, who
came from nowhere, who has a history of
supporting the same kinds of causes."
Goldberg stood out.
Koppel, a Stanford graduate, was an obvi
ous choice for master of ceremonies, he says.
Stanford's diverse student body and con
cern for multiculturalism also made the
selection of a multi-ethnic cast a priority.

The challenge,
Lipton says, was not to
line up a series of big
names, but to weave per
formers into the history
of the University — a
history which Lipton
enjoyed studying.
"The history of this
university is just abso
lutely fascinating — a
very, very colorful histo
ry. A lot got done here
that probably could have
been done only here."
The focus groups
also gave Lipton a sensi
tivity for the desire of var

ious groups to play a part in the celebration —
in particular Stanford's staff and alumni.
"It is important for the alums to have the
sense that they are involved and presented by
the University," says Lipton. And that, Lipton
says, does not mean just the famous alumni.
"There arc lots of alums who have done a

lot but who don't have name recognition,"
Lipton says. So the event will include a
speech by Dana Winters — an alumnus who
graduated "sometime in the '30s — no one
remembers exactly when," Lipton jokes.
In a humorous presentation, Winters will
talk about "what it's like to come back after
50 years and have done nothing," he says.
Events with a message
That's not a problem that Lipton would
have if he returned to his alma mater today.
After graduating from New York University,
where he majored in scenic design, Lipton
began his career as an event organizer by
producing small concerts in New York and
New Jersey.
He went on to produce a number of sports
and music festivals and two World's Fairs.
After his work with the Olympics, he was
hired as a senior producer for Radio City
Music Hall.
But the gala events didn't quite satisfy

Lipton, who started Eventures two years ago.
"What started to appeal to me were things
that had a message," he says.
Since then, Eventures has produced the
largest tickertape parade in New York City's
history, the opening ceremonies for the
Goodwill Games and the "We the People"
parade in Philadelphia, which commemorat
ed the bicentennial of the Constitution.
This summer the corporation is also work
ing on Polaroid's tribute to Edwin Land, its
founder. Revealing the thorough research
that is his trademark, Lipton discusses
Land's background, his accomplishments, his
corporate philosophy.
And Lipton has a corporate philosophy of
his own. "Our goal is to bring a little light to
people," he says."The best part about events
is that they bring people together.
"Things that bring large numbers of peo
ple together create an enormous amount of
energy," adds the energetic Lipton.
They also make money — a concern which

sense that they are involved and presented by
the University," says Lipton. And that, Lipton
says, does not mean just the famous alumni.
"There arc lots of alums who have done a

lot but who don't have name recognition,"
Lipton says. So the event will include a
speech by Dana Winters — an alumnus who
graduated "sometime in the '30s — no one
remembers exactly when," Lipton jokes.
In a humorous presentation, Winters will
talk about "what it's like to come back after
50 years and have done nothing," he says.
Events with a message
That's not a problem that Lipton would
have if he returned to his alma mater today.
After graduating from New York University,
where he majored in scenic design, Lipton
began his career as an event organizer by
producing small concerts in New York and
New Jersey.
He went on to produce a number of sports
and music festivals and two World's Fairs.
After his work with the Olympics, he was
hired as a senior producer for Radio City
Music Hall.
But the gala events didn't quite satisfy

Lipton, who started Eventures two years ago.
"What started to appeal to me were things
that had a message," he says.
Since then, Eventures has produced the
largest tickertape parade in New York City's
history, the opening ceremonies for the
Goodwill Games and the "We the People"
parade in Philadelphia, which commemorat
ed the bicentennial of the Constitution.
This summer the corporation is also work
ing on Polaroid's tribute to Edwin Land, its
founder. Revealing the thorough research
that is his trademark, Lipton discusses
Land's background, his accomplishments, his
corporate philosophy.
And Lipton has a corporate philosophy of
his own. "Our goal is to bring a little light to
people," he says."The best part about events
is that they bring people together.
"Things that bring large numbers of peo
ple together create an enormous amount of
energy," adds the energetic Lipton.
They also make money — a concern which

has not dominated planning of the celebra
tion but isn't far from Lipton's mind.
"This event is designed to raise money for
the University, not to cost it money," he says.
The money will be raised through corporate
sponsorship and through the sale of tickets,
which will cost $15 for Stanford students,
faculty and staff, and $25 for the outside
community.
"At a time when money's tight, we do not
want to be adding more strain" to the
University's finances, Lipton adds.
In the next few months, Lipton will face
an imposing organizational challenge.
Eventures will have to coordinate the crew
that will translate Lipton's blueprint and pull
off the Stadium Spectacular.
"Big moments grow out of a lot of little
things," says this orchestrator of big events
who hasn't lost his fascination with detail.
"If it's realized as well as it should be,
Stanford will understand itself a little bet
ter."

musical performances and anecdotes
chronicling the University's past.
Barnett Lipton thinks big.
At the age of 39, the energetic, red-haired
entrepreneur has had a hand in some of recent
memory's largest spectacles. Lipton managed the opening
and closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in
Los Angeles. He produced the ticker tape parade in New
York City for the soldiers returning from the Gulf war. He
traveled to San Diego in 1988 to design the gala halftime
show for Super Bowl XXII.

But Stanford has
been the focus of
Lipton's attention
for much of the last
year. Flying between
his Madison Avenue
office in New York
and the University's
Centennial head
quarters, Lipton has
planned an event
that may overshadow
anything in the
school's 100-year
history for sheer
spectacle: the Sta
dium Spectacular
that will culminate
Stanford's Centen
nial Celebration.
Lipton, the presi
dent of Eventures,
an event-planning
company, has lined
up an impressive
cast of entertainers
and public figures
for the stadium
show, which will take

place Monday, Sept. 30. Ted Koppel will be
the master of ceremonies. Whoopi
Goldberg, Bobby McFerrin, flutist James
Galway, Joan Baez, the Doobie Brothers and
others will perform.
The spectators who will fill Stanford
Stadium can expect a celebration in trade
mark Lipton style: with drama, flair and
plenty of fireworks.
"The event will provide a level of drama
and pageantry that people won't soon for
get," says Centennial Celebration Director
Stephen Peeps.
But the big names and the dramatic agen
da mask the attention to detail and depth of
study that characterize Lipton's work.
For Lipton has studied Stanford for near
ly a year now. Conducting focus groups and
interviews with students, alumni, faculty and
staff, Lipton has tried to understand how
people at Stanford see.the University.
Lipton says he wants to create a show that
will resonate with all that people find special,
interesting and real about Stanford. More
than produce a gala event, he wants to cap
ture a moment in Stanford's history.
"Fifty and 100 years from now, people will
look back and say, 'How did Stanford see
itself at that point in its history?'" Lipton
says. The tone of Stanford's Centennial

Celebration will
leave an archival
message that Lip
ton wants "to be as
meaningful as pos
sible."
So Lipton be
gan the year by sub
scribing to campus
publications and
doing research,
studying the issues
and ideas that dom
inate campus dia
logue and the
themes that run
through the Un
iversity's history.
That's taken a
fair amount of
reading.
But more im
portant, Lipton says,
it has taken a lot of
listening to the feel
ings of those who
make up the Stan
ford community.
"What's impor

tant to you about Stanford?" he pressed par
ticipants in the 15-person focus groups that
he and an assistant have conducted at the
University this year. "What's important for
people to know about this university?"
The responses have surprised and fasci
nated Lipton, who has done a number of his
torical commemorations. For one thing,
Lipton has found, Stanford students and fac
ulty view the University's histo

ry with a realism unaffected by
their desire for celebration.
"People at Stanford don't
want a glorified version of their
history," he says.
In particular, Lipton says,
minority students don't want a
production that glosses over
either Leland Stanford's use of
Asian-American laborers on
the railroad or eras of racial
discrimination in Stanford's
history.
Nor will the show gloss over
the University's present prob
lems. "We want to try to cap
ture what's on people's minds
right now," says Lipton, men
tioning financial austerity and
the federal investigation of the

University's indirect-cost practices.
"People at this university give hard looks
at things," he continues, "and acting like the
University had somehow reached a state of
perfection would come across as hollow."
Instead, Lipton plans for the production
to celebrate the challenges that the
University has confronted in its 100-year his
tory — difficulties, Lipton says, that put
today's situation in perspective.
"Stanford has weathered a lot in 100
years," Lipton says."It will weather this. The
point is to learn from it and move on. You

face adversity and you
grow to meet the chal
lenge."

Star-studded cast
Looking through his
reframed tortoise-shell
glasses, with a gold
Centennial pin glisten
ing on the lapel of his
blue, pin striped, dou
ble-breasted suit,
Lipton seems undaunt
ed by the challenges of
putting on such a large
event.
With enthusiastic
confidence, Lipton

describes the night's lineup. Folk legend
Joan Baez, cabaret performer Michael
Feinstein and the jazz fusion group
Hiroshima will perform. Flutist James
Galway will play a duet with Grammy-win
ning singer Bobby McFerrin. Former San
Francisco 49ers and Stanford coach Bill

Walsh, two-time Olympic decathlon champi
on Bob Mathias, and former Stanford and
49er quarterback Frankie Albert also will
make appearances.
But Lipton is quick to point out that he
doesn't measure success in names and that
what he is striving to create is not a gala line
up of stars but a commemoration that is
uniquely Stanford's own.
"It will not be a 'show,' " Lipton says."It
will be an event that in the most literal sense
is of and by Stanford."
The choice of entertainers reflects

For one thing, Lipton has found, Stanford
students and faculty view the University's
history with a realism unaffected by their
desire for celebration. 'People at Stanford
don't want a glorified version of their history.'

Lipton's desire "to best express certain
aspects of the history of the University."
A long and carefully studied decision
making process went, for example, into the
selection of Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg will
perform a dramatic reading about Jane
Stanford's life.

"Jane Stanford was an interesting woman,
someone way ahead of her time," Lipton says
of his research on the life of the University's
co-founder. For this performance Lipton
wanted "someone who was a feminist, who
came from nowhere, who has a history of
supporting the same kinds of causes."
Goldberg stood out.
Koppel, a Stanford graduate, was an obvi
ous choice for master of ceremonies, he says.
Stanford's diverse student body and con
cern for multiculturalism also made the
selection of a multi-ethnic cast a priority.

The challenge,
Lipton says, was not to
line up a series of big
names, but to weave per
formers into the history
of the University — a
history which Lipton
enjoyed studying.
"The history of this
university is just abso
lutely fascinating — a
very, very colorful histo
ry. A lot got done here
that probably could have
been done only here."
The focus groups
also gave Lipton a sensi
tivity for the desire of var

ious groups to play a part in the celebration —
in particular Stanford's staff and alumni.
"It is important for the alums to have the
sense that they are involved and presented by
the University," says Lipton. And that, Lipton
says, does not mean just the famous alumni.
"There arc lots of alums who have done a

lot but who don't have name recognition,"
