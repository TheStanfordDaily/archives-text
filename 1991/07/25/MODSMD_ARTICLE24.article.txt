# Disaster 101: What happens if it rains
## 
### 
If everything that can go wrong does,
the Centennial Celebration may become
Lois Wagner's nightmare.
Wagner, the director of University
Events and Services, regularly has bad
dreams about major events under her
direction — although the nightmares come
after the shebangs have occurred.
Bad dreams or no, contingency plans
are in the works for disasters that could
strike on Centennial Weekend in
September.
There could be another earthquake. Or
a fire, a bomb threat or food poisoning of
the masses who go to the formal dinner in
the Quad.
Heck, it might even rain.
"It can't rain. It just can't rain," Wagner
said.
Her team consists of representatives
from facilities, transportation, operations,
police and grounds departments. If disas
ter strikes, it will be handled through nor
mal University channels.
Should, for example, scores be food poi
soned at the dinner in the quad, victims
will be transported to the Stanford
Hospital for treatment. The hospital will
soon be notified of how many people will
attend the dinner, Wagner said.
If there isn't room at the local hospital,
surplus victims can be shuttled to other
area facilities, she said. "The chances of
food poisoning are very slim," she added.
And if the dreaded drops fall during the
stadium celebration, the show will go on,
Wagner said. "We'll do a radio cast in
Maples for those folks who don't want to
be out in the. rain," she said.
Security and parking are other points of
concern, although contingencies can't be
hammered out until the events are fully
planned, said Stanford Police Sgt. Nick
Bruno. He said he expected planning to
take about two or three more weeks.

"If you bring M.C. Hammer [to the
Celebration], security will be different than
if you bring someone else," he said.
Parking and travel will be a problem
according to Tom Auer, a transportation
facilities project manager. "Everyone
ought to be realistic — it's going to be
harder to get around campus during the
celebration," he said.
But inconvenience is the worst-case sce
nario, according to Auer.

Tents will be set up on a number of
parking sites, he said. Replacement park
ing for employees will be available near the
stadium, he added, and a Marguerite shut
tle will be available to transport people
closer to the center of campus.
Students won't lose any parking. Some
won't be able to move their cars, however,
because Escondido Road will be closed
down, he said.
