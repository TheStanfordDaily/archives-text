While Los Angelenos virtually ignored
the Olympic Festival as it played in their
backyard, gymastics observers couldn't help
but watch the show Stanford's Jair Lynch
put on in the gymnastics competition.
Lynch, 19, won six medals — including
five golds — last Friday and Saturday. He
won gold in the team competition, the indi
vidual all-around, the pommel horse, high
bar and parallel bars. A silver in the floor
exercise made him one of three festival ath
letes to pick up six medals.
"I knew I had a strong chance in my best
events, the pommel horse and the parallel
bars, but taking all of them was a surprise,"
Lynch said.
■ The finest sprinter in Stanford history
made her mark at the World University in
Sheffield, England on Sunday. Chryste
Gaines clocked a 11.27 to win the 100-
meter dash. Gaines, a native of Dallas,
broke her personal record by one one-hun
dredth of a second in the race The
women's basketball team, coached by Tara
VanDerveer and including 1990 graduate
Katy Steding won the gold medal at the
games. They routed Spain 88-62 in the
final, prompting Spanish coach Jose Buceta
to say: "Who could have beaten them
today? I don't know, perhaps the USA
men's team."
Comings and goings
Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, the third
round draft choice of the New York Giants,
signed a contract reportedly worth $800,000
and reported to camp TUesday.
He Nad missed eight days of camp and
coach Ray Handley said, "He looked lost.
We'll try to settle him down and get him
going."
But Handley was quick to add, "He
didn't get enough work, but he showed us
he's a auick learner. We feel he'll catch on
quickly.
Said McCaffrey: "Everyone's been help
ing me with the plays and spending extra
hours with me. It feels great. I have been
anxious to get to camp all week." ... Cor

nerback Kevin Scott, the Detroit Lions'
fourth selection in the draft also signed and
is in camp trying to earn a starting spot.
■ Forward Andrew Vlahov, whose return
from injury helped sparked Stanford to the
NIT title, has been offered a tryout by the
Los Angeles Lakers. Vlahov had been play
ing basketball in his native Australia since
leaving school in April.
■ Player of the Year David McCarty, the
third overall selection in the baseball draft,
signed with the T\vins. Sources say he
received a $385,000 bonus. Teammates
Troy Tallman and Roger Burnett also
signed pro contracts, Tallman with the Ori
oles and Burnett with the Yankees.
Tennis roundup
Senior Debbie Graham is seeded eighth
in the $100,000 Westchester Ladies Open at
