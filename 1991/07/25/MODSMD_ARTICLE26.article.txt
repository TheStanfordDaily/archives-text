# Keefe a Wooden finalist
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Adam Keefe has had some pretty heady
stuff come his way this past week. And it could
get better still.
Last Saturday, Keefe was named as one of
20 finalists for the John Wooden Award, col
lege basketball's highest honor. Keefe, who
passed up a chance to enter the NBA after
last season, averaged 21.5 points and 9.5
rebounds as a junior. He is projected as a lot
tery pick in the 1992 draft.
Meanwhile, Keefe is in West Lafayette,
Ind., trying to earn a spot on the Pan Ameri
can Games team that will be competing in
Havana, early next month. Seventeen finalists
were invited to the Purdue University campus
by Gene Keady.
Monday, three of those finalists — Pepper
dine's Doug Christie, Alabama's Robert
Horry and UNLV's Elmore Spencer — were
sent packing. Horry and Spencer are big men
and were in direct competition with Keefe.
Two cuts remain, but the odds look good.
Keefe certainly didn't hurt his chances
when the U.S. squad scrimmaged with the
AAU Lafayette Huskers on Sunday. The 6-
foot-9 redhead scored 15 points, helping his
team to a 114-100 victory.

The leading candidates for the Wooden
Award are LSU center Shaquille O'Neal and
Duke power forward Christian Laettner.
More than 1,000 sports writers and broadcast
ers will vote on the Wooden award during the
NCAA basketball tournament.
