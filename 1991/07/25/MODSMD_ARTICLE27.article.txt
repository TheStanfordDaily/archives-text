## Stop the scourge of sport 
### 
I see Lyle Azado a lot on television these
days. He's talking about how two
decades of steroid use gave him inoper
able brain cancer.
It's quite sad to see. Alzado, once one of
the most feared men in the National Foot
ball League, wears a bandana to cover his
bald head — a side effect of the chemother
apy. He tells his story, often approaching
tears, and respectfully answers nearly all
questions thrown his way.

He is dying, slowly but
surely. There is little
chance the cancer will go
into remission. He tells of
the pain he has suffered. It
is likely to get much worse
as the cancer continues to
rage.
What a waste. All for a
few years of glory.
Several years back, ath
letes were asked if they
would use performance
enhancing drugs knowing
that wouldn't live as long.
An overwhelming majority

said yes. Surely, they would've answered dif
ferently had they known they could wind up
like Alzado. Right?
Alzado certainly regrets his steroid use
and would gladly trade his bygone football
career for a few more years with his new
wife. He is speaking out loudly about the
dangers of steroids and human growth hor
mone — the new wonder.
The NFL says Alzado exaggerates the
prevalence of steroid use. They say only
about one-third of the league uses the
drugs, not more than half.
Only one-third? Only a few cancers per
decade? What a relief.
Let's get real for a minute. Even if
Alzado's cancer wasn't caused by the drugs
— doctors are divided on the issue —
there's little doubt steroids destroy the liver,
can cause clotting that eventually forces
limb amputation, cover the face and back
with acne, and generally screw up your
health.
Yet countless athletes take them every
day, looking for that extra edge. We know
about the Ben Johnsons and the Lyle Alza
dos. Johnson's been caught; Alzado's fate is
obviously far worse. Their performances are
now tainted in our minds to the point that it
seems they shouldn't count.
The tragedy is worsened by the fact that
many other great performers exist in the
shadow of doubt: Do they use steroids?
While the following shouldn't be viewed as
an indictment of anyone, consider:
• Florence Griffith Joyner abruptly calls

its quits. She is sitting atop the track world
at the time and cries hysterically at her
retirement announcement. Was a positive
drug test in the offing?
• Bo Jackson misses most of a season
with a degnerative hip ailment. His joint is
being destroyed in a manner consistent with
steroid use.
• Mark Bavaro, injured many times, suf
fers a similar fate to Jackson. Something
called vascular necrosis. Could the need to

rehabilitate have sent him
to the bottle?
• Mike Tyson loses
his title to Buster Douglas.
He comes back bigger and
stronger, like a chiseled
hulk. Boxing doesn't do
much as far as steroid test
ing goes.
• Evander Holyfield
knows that, doesn't he?
Once a meek, weak light
heavyweight, he now
resembles Adonis. Or Her
cules. Or both.
Again, don't read the

above as accusatory. But these thoughts
keep creeping up. And not just in my mind.
The juxtaposition of the Alzado case and
these items seem to trivialize a man's life in
some ways, I confess. But if anything good
comes out of this tragedy it will be a refocus
ing of attention on the steroids plague that
threatens the integrity of everything from
baseball to weightlifting.
Most of the battle today is being fought
between those who develop drugs that help
athletes avoid detection and those who fig
ured out that these new drugs are masking
the presence of others. It's high time that the
drug-free athletes join forces with the vari
ous athletic governing bodies and go on the
offensive to find a way to clean up sports.

We shouldn't have to have a record book
for those who used steroids and those who
didn't. We shouldn't have people dying
because they felt they had to take drugs to
be big enough and fast enough. The mes
sage is unhealthy for all the young athletes
out there who are trying to get ahead.
I recognize that in a world where no one
cheats, the one cheater gains the greatest
advantage. It's like when everyone sits at a
stadium, the one guy who stands up can see
everything. That will no doubt make it diffi
cult to convince everyone to buy in to the no
drugs deal. The solution is stricter punish
ment and better detection.
Something has got to give. And sooner
rather than later. If you don't think time is
running out, ask Lyle Alzado. He'll give it to
you straight.
