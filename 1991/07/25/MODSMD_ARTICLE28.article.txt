## The
						Green Project: Dance for the'90s 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
Three women in dated polyester
dresses take blankets and umbrellas
out of brown paper bags. They lay
their blankets on the grass next to Green
Library and open dark umbrellas over their
heads. It is a sunny day.
A man lays out his blanket and slowly
walks around its edges as if in a trance.
Slow, eerie music plays from a synthesizer.
The man then walks up to the women and
hands each one a piece of paper on which a
name is inscribed. They call out the name,
one at a time.
Thus begins "Roll Call," one of the
beautiful and moving performance pieces
put together by the Green Performance
Project, which began its summer series of
performances earlier this month.
The Project is a group of Bay Area
dancers, singers and musicians working
together this summer to connect art and life
through the mediums of dance, drama,
music and popular culture.
"[lnfluenced] by the Happenings and
Events of the late '60s and the personal-as
political approach of performance artists of
the '70s and early '80s," the Project's aim
for the '90s "is the engagement of the mind
and heart through the eyes and cars to
make us more aware of the beauty and the
horror of the world around us," according
to the Project's statement of purpose.
Drawing from different modern dance
schools and techniques, the influence of
Artistic Director and Choreographer

Richard Green — a recent graduate in
drama and Italian — and the personal cre
ativity of the individual dancers, the group's
performances take on a very innovative
style.
The dancers filled the space around
Green Library, dancing in the fountain, up
and down steps and on ledges.
Dancers and dance aficionados alike will
notice movement influenced by Merce
Cunningham and Isadora Duncan tech
niques, but not without some added twists.
In one piece, two women don brightly col
ored toga-styled gowns and perform a
dance reminiscent of Duncan technique,
but with a few added touches. For instance,
the women, wearing large black boots, per
form a ballet-influenced modern dance
while Green delivers a speech about dying.
"I'm dying," said Green, bringing up the
plight of the black male, "twice as fast as
any man between the ages of 18 and 35....
Every day I wake up, and it's a wonder that
I am still alive."
In another dance piece, the three
women dancers, Jill Antonides, Kimberly
Hoskins and Lily Wong, take part in a game
show. After Antonides wins, the other
dancers leave and begin their own dance
movements. Antonides stares out into
space and tells the tale of a woman with
bleeding fingers dangling from a window
ledge. Her voice is deep and resonant, and
each sentence paints a somber picture.
Although the performance seemed to
focus particularly on loss and dying. Green
said he and the dancers were not trying to
convey any single point of view.
"It is about loss, but it also concerns the
aspects of a performance," said Green.
To illustrate, Green pointed out the
words spoken by keyboardist and singer
Dan Phillips toward the end of the perfor

mance. Phillips had noted the influence of !
the audience on the performer and how 1
leaving in a way is like dying.
Green added that the interpretation of !
the performance was up to the dancer as I
well as the viewer. :

"[The movement and
the words] create a per
sonal meaning for each
dancer.... [The viewers]

create their own connec
tion as well," he said.
Green wants to

"blend visuals
and themat
ics," while at

the same time
striving to

have "a striking
image apart from sig-

nification."
The dialogue in the per-

formance was mostly extracted
from Karen Finley's work titled
"Constant State of Desire." The

dancers received words and 1
speeches, internalized them and |
danced according to how they inter
preted them. A certain dance phrase
was choreographed, but the move
ments of each dancer differed, if even
slightly, from one another. Green
explained that words were used as a
basis to encourage movement which

he described as "non-linear."
Hailing from Milwaukee, Green
began his study of dance with musical
theater courses at age 13 and later
learned modern, jazz, African and bal
let dance styles and forms. He has

taught dance classes and created
movement for dance and theater

groups both in the United

States and in Italy and has performed in
Florence, Italy; Paris; and San Francisco.
In the fall, Green will be attending Tisch
School of the Arts at New York University
for graduate work in performance studies
and for further dance training at local stu
dios.

The Green Performance Project concludes its
summer series with performances on Aug. 2
and 3 in the Little Theater in Memorial Hall.
