# 'Striking and exceptional' concert
## 
### Marc Booth 
Lollapalooza is a Spanish
term for "something very strik
ing or exceptional." And this
weekend's seven-band concert
at Shoreline Amphitheatre is
appropriately named the Lolla
palooza Tour.
Among the groups perform
ing at this outdoor concert are
such popular college bands as
Jane's Addiction and Nine Inch
Nails, as well as Siouxsie and
the Banshees and Living
Colour. Each group has done
some touring within the past
year or two, so expect them all
to put on an energetic show.
This may be the last chance
to catch Jane's Addiction in
concert. The group's vocalist,
Perry Farrell, recently said in
the San Francisco Chronicle
that Lollapalooza will be the
group's "sprint to the finish."
Farrell seems to promise a great
show for those attending the
concert, saying he wants to end
his Jane's Addiction stint "with
the most amount of energy pos r
sible."
In addition to the musical
extravaganza, there will also be
exotic food tents, tie-dye dis
plays and other arts exhibits.
Plus, various organizations,
ranging from environmental
groups to the National Rifle
Association, will operate infor
mation tents in order to get
their particular messages out.
One of the organizers behind
the Lollapalooza Tour, Jane's
Addiction booking agent Marc
Geiger, said the purpose of this
event was to create an environ
ment where "kids can come,
spread their blankets out and

spend the whole day."
Living Colour, which toured
with the Rolling Stones on the
Steel Wheels tour last year, is
known for its ability to animate
the audience when it takes the
stage.
Nine Inch Nails, which per
formed at The Warfield in San
Francisco earlier this year, is
another incredible group to see
live. Most of their music at Lol
lapalooza will probably be from
their dark and ominous album,
"Pretty Hate Machine."
Ice-T, the rapper v/ho
recently starred in the movie
"New Jack City," will demon
strate why he is considered one

of the most hard-core rappers.
Hard truth is what you'll hear in
his work; don't expect Ice-T to
be dishing out any nursery
rhymes.
Rounding out the wide range
of music represented in this all
day extravaganza are Butthole
Surfers and the Henry Rollins
Band.

The Lollapalooza Tour, featur
ing Jane's Addiction, Siouxsie
and the Banshees, Living Colour
and four other bands, comes to
Shoreline Amphitheatre tomor
row and Saturday. Call 762-
