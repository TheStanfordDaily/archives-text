# Garlic capital celebrates
## 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
When people think of Califor
nia, they think of everlasting sum
mers, of the bright, yellow sun
beating down on hundreds of
healthy, tanned bodies. They think
of beaches, of pure, white sand
stretching for miles until it meets
the deep blue ocean. They think
of surfers and sunsets, of blondes
and bean sprouts.
They think of garlic.
OK, maybe they don't. But they
should. California, and more
specifically, Gilroy, is the nation's
garlic capital: Almost all of the
country's garlic is processed here.
And boy, are the residents of
Gilroy proud of it.
So proud that they host a festi
val every summer to celebrate.
Now in its 13th year, the festival
was originally designed to boost
the image of both the plant and
the town that is best known for its
scent on U.S. Highway 101. Judg
ing from attendance, however, it
seems that most people now rec
ognize the merits of both.
Last year, over 142,000 people
came to celebrate garlic; this year,
even more are expected. For a
town of less than 31,000, that's
pretty impressive.
But even more impressive is
the festival itself. Organized by
the Gilroy Garlic Festival Associa
tion, which is composed solely of
volunteers, the festival takes
32,000 hours to put together and
profits over 140 charities.
And let's not forget the food —
lots of it.
The main attraction of the gar
lic festival is Gourmet Alley, the
association's food showcase.
Here, garlic is added to everything
from bread to vegetables to pasta
to calamari by talented chefs who

know their stuff. You can watch as
over a ton of garlic is used to make
the seven dishes featured in the
alley alone.
The versatility of this potent
herb is proven by some of the
other culinary booths, not orga
nized by the association, where
independent vendors take a more
liberal approach to garlic, combin
ing it with fried cheese, egg rolls,
beer, ice cream and even choco
late. Some of the concoctions
have to be seen — and smelled —
to be believed.
Even more unbelievable, how
ever, are the recipes submitted to
the cook-off, which takes place at
the festival itself. Eight finalists
are chosen from the hundreds
who submit original, unpublished
garlic recipes to cook their mas
terpieces.
But there's more to the festival
than just food. Four stages, featur
ing continuous entertainment
such as puppeteers, mimes, belly
dancers, clowns and music —
ranging from country to big band
— are set up to give visitors a
break from eating. And further
distractions are provided by the
roving entertainment, such as
mariachi dancers, and the dozens
of booths selling garlic souvenirs.
All in all, the Gilroy Garlic Fes
tival is quite an event, put
together by the community that
Will Rogers once described as
"the only town in America where
you can marinate a steak by hang
ing it on the clothesline."

The 13th Annual Gilroy Garlic Fes
tival takes place at Christmas Hill
Park tomorrow through Sunday,
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets are
$7 for adults, $2 for children and
senior citizens on Friday; $8 for
adults on Saturday. For more infor
mation, call (408) 842-6436.
