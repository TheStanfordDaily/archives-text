New isn't better
"Into the Great Wide Open," Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers

Have you ever heard a young
child — about 3 or 4 years old —
sing to himself? He doesn't actu
ally sing a song; he just puts what
ever he feels like saying to music.
Like this: "My mo-ther is goooo
ing to the store, and she buys
fooooood and I go too-oo ..."
Tom Petty's new album, "Into
the Great Wide Open," is very
much like that: It often sounds
like Petty is just putting random
words to music. For example, the
track "All or Nothin' " begins with
the verse, "Your daddy was a
sergeant major/You didn't wanna,
but he made you/Wipe his brass
from time to time/It left a picture
in your mind/You know? You
know?"
And "All the Wrong Reasons,"
another track on the compact
disc, contains the lines, "Well she
grew up hard and she grew up
fast/In the age of television/And
she made a vow to have it all/It
became her new religion."
What do these songs mean?
I've listened to them several times
and I'm still not sure. But, as
strange as they are, they do have
one thing going for them: At least
they don't repeat the same line
over and over six or seven times,
as do many of the other tracks on
the album. It's almost as though
Petty came up with the title for a
song, and then sang it repeatedly.
Of course, many hit recordings
these days make no sense and
repeat themselves. And that's
OK. Even I can deal with it, as

long as the music accompanying
them is decent.
In this case, it isn't.
The Petty I know and love
writes fast, rocking songs like
"You Got Lucky," "American
Girl" and "Don't Do Me Like
That." His music gets me to tap
my feet and sing along. Even his
slower songs, like "Breakdown"
and "Runaway Train" have an
'oomph' that keep them going.
However, the Petty of "Into the
Great Wide Open" slowly whines
his way through ballad-attempt
after ballad-attempt, some of
which sound like "Free Fallin',"
and most of which sound alike.
The only song on the album that
has even a spark of originality is
the title track, "Into the Great
Wide Open." Granted, it also
makes little sense, but at least it
didn't make me yawn. And it con
tains what I consider a great line,
"A rebel without a clue."
Those who became Petty fans
recently and who liked "Full
Moon Fever" will probably accept
"Into the Great Wide Open."
However, those who can remem
ber back to the days of "Damn the
Torpedoes" will be as disap
pointed as I was.

Back to the future
"Pour in the Sky," liquidjesus
When you call something a
throwback, it is labeled not just as
an anachronism, but also as a revi
sion. Ergo, to call liquid jesus'
MCA debut album, "Pour in the
Sky," a throwback means it is a
creative, if not visionary, blend of
'60s psychedelia and modern rock
formula lyrics. In other words, liq
uid jesus is a visionary throwback,
not an anachronistic one.
After proving themselves time

and time again in Los Angeles
nightclubs, liquid jesus has finally
made it big, sort of. Yet, even with
a major record contract under
their belts, this band has created a
peculiar dilemma for themselves.
While the paradox of liquid jesus'
sound is what makes them inter
esting, it may also be what ends
their run at the big time.
Unlike their first effort — a live
album on Triple X Records —
"Pour in the Sky" is too main
stream for college radio, hearken
ing back too heavily to those heav
ies-of-heavy, Jimi Hendrix and
Led Zeppelin. Problem is, com
mercial radio's notorious reluc
tance to play anything but sure
fire hits will blind it to the new
direction this album points to for
album rock.
Music biz critique aside, "Pour
in the Sky" is certainly head-bob
bing music. Though not particu
larly innovative, the many influ
ences that resonate throughout
the album weave a many-voiced
guitar narrative. Not really a
"sludgefest," as it has been
described, the metal edge comes
through loud and clear.
Much ado has been made
about the Judeo-Christian spiritu
ality of this band. Although the
information they provide the
press is rife with denial of this
influence, Christian iconography
distinctly permeates both the
lyrics and cover art of "Pour in the
Sky."
Songs like "Finding My Way"
and"The Light" stress the human
struggle to find a guiding life-plan.
Lyrically, light indicates turning
points in this struggle. They open
new horizons and suggest a
"right" direction.
This beating of the tired horse
of soul-searching and metaphysi
cal correctness does not condemn
liquid jesus to forgettability.

Indeed, by the second or third lis
ten the lyrics become intriguing.
This may work in the band's favor
on album-oriented radio — by the
time a listener sinks her teeth into

a song's meanings the psychedelic
bass line or the blues rock chords
have already seduced her ears.

Liquid Jesus, playing today at the l-Beam in San Francisco, original
ly wanted to title their latest album "Mellifluous." They opted instead
for "Pour In the Sky."
