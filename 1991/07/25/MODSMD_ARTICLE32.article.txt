Most triumphant
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey,"
starring Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter
and William Sadler
I can be a real pain in the butt
sometimes.
No, seriously. Let me give you
some examples: I won't eat fruit
with my food, I won't go shopping
after I eat, and I won't see the
same movie more than once.
Ever. No matter how good it is.
(Except for "Grease," which I
saw seven times, but I was young
then and much easier to get along
with.)
Until now.
Until "Bill and Ted's Bogus
Journey."
I realize that sounds strange. I
won't see movies like "Dances
With Wolves" or "Rain Man"
again, but halfway into "Bogus
Journey" I decided I was coming
back. It was that funny. I liked it
that much.
Not that it was good. I mean,
let's face facts: The first Bill and
Ted movie was stupid; the second
one is just as (if not more) stupid.
I know it, you know it, even they
know it.
So what? What good is a movie
if it has to be realistic? Who wants
to pay money to find out that life
doesn't work out as you want, and
you can't always have your way?
I certainly don't. I learn that
every day.
Bill and Ted, however, have
never figured that out. That's
what makes them so entertaining.
Stupid, but entertaining.
Then again, things always do
work out for Bill and Ted. For
example, in the first movie they
passed history without doing any
work. Granted, they had help
from the future, but still. When's
the last time you passed a class
without doing any work? (Actu
ally ... never mind.)

In "Bogus Journey," it happens
again. Bill and Ted are killed by
two robot look-alikes (the Evil Bill
and Ted) that were designed by a
power-hungry man of the future,
Chuck De Nomolos (Rufus' for
mer gym teacher). De Nomolos
wants to recreate history, wiping
out the legacy of Bill and Ted and
replacing it with the legacy of him
self (typical gym teacher ego).
But that's OK. Bill and Ted are
two bodacious dudes. They can
overcome all. And they do.
In order to save the present,
the future and the babes (the
princesses brought from the past
in the first Bill and Ted movie),
Bill and Ted meet with Death,
God, the Devil, the Easter Bunny
and Martians.
And have children. (This is
perhaps the most unrealistic part
of the film.)
So the movie is far-fetched. I
admit it. But I am still going to see
it again.

Hidden identity
"Europa Europa," starring Marco
Hofschneider. In German and Rus
sian with English subtitles
If "Europa Europa" wasn't the
true story of Solomon Perel's sur
vival through World War 11, then
the script might be accused of
lacking realism. But because
writer and director Agnieszka
Holland tells this tale using
Perel's own autobiography as the
source, this suspense-filled chron
icle of his youth insists on being
believed.
Born in Germany, Perel's
seven-year odyssey begins on the
eve of his bar mitzvah in 1938,
when soldiers invade his father's
shoe store. His sister is killed, and
the family moves to Poland, where
they believe they will be safe.
As he will remain throughout
the film, young Solly is unaware of
the catastrophic events around
him. His father, however, knows
that a German invasion is near
and sends Solly and his brother,
Isaac, off to Russian-controlled

Poland. Solly makes it, but Isaac is
left behind.
Solly is placed in a orphanage
where he becomes "a good Com
munist" and a star pupil, but there
is some question as to whether he
has actually relinquished his Jew
ish past or is merely pretending to
be indoctrinated.
When the Germans invade
again, he is captured but survives
by hiding his papers and claiming
to be pure-bred Aryan. Impressed
by his control of the German lan
guage, the soldiers believe him
and adopt Solly as a good-luck
charm after Stalin's son is cap
tured in his presence.
The charade continues, and
Solly progresses from a war hero
to a member of the Hitler Youth,
masterfully assimilating like
Woody Allen's frightened Leon-

The film is both painful and exciting, often exploring
deep ironies through Solly's masquerade.

ard Zelig.
Not a minute passes in this film
without a miraculous twist of fate.
Solly's only hurdle as a human
chameleon is the physical evi
dence that he is circumcised,
which presents problems in show
ers, with doctors and in his bud
ding love affairs.
The film itself is both painful
and exciting, often exploring deep
ironies through Solly's masquer
ade. One dream sequence fea
tures a dance duet between Hitler
and Stalin a la Chaplin's "The
Great Dictator," certainly an

influence at work in much of the
film.
While Holland does not place
any blame for Perel's assimilation,
neither does she disregard it.
Repeated images of immersion in
water clue the viewer to question
the institutions which protect
Solly's identity, and the Russian
orphanage is not visually distinct
from the Hitler Youth school.
Holland has created a rare
item, an ironic adventure film
about a Jew escaping the Nazis.
