Editor's picks:
Bookstores
• Kepler's — With its convenient location
on El Camino in Menlo Park, carpeted
floors, wood bookcases and a vast assort
ment of books, this store is a definite
crowd-pleaser.
• Printers, Inc. — This Palo Alto establish
ment on California Ave. is a cafe and book
store in one — what more could you ask for
on a Sunday morning?
• Two Sister's — This beautiful little shop,
tucked away on Cambridge Ave. in Menlo
Park, offers a huge selection of women

centered books, traditional instruments
and goddess figures.
• City Lights — This unique triangular
bookstore, located on Columbus Ave. in
North Beach, was founded by Beat Gener
ation writers in the '50s and is now a very
dense shop.
New film releases:
Opening Friday
• "Mobsters" — "They had what it took to
build an empire ... They just built it on the
wrong side of the law."
• "Life Stinks" — "He had it all. He bet it
all. He lost it all."
• "V.I. Warshawski" — "A private detective
with a name as tough as she is."

One is professional. The other is patholog

• Mary's Danish — "Circa"
• Kitaro — "Live in America"
• Squeeze — "Play"
The nice folks at Compact Disc World
would like all Guns N' Roses fans to know
that the new album has been delayed until
September. Guess all those court cases
take up a lot of the band's time ...

This week's releases:
• "Lionheart," starring Jean-Claude Van
Damme

• "Sleeping with the Enemy," starring Julia
Roberts
• "Alice," starring Mia Farrow and William
Hurt
• "Hamlet," starring Mel Gibson and
Glenn Close
TV this week:
You know it's a pretty dry week in TV
when The Stanford Weekly recommends a
program about Berkeley. But "Berkeley in
the Sixties," airing tomorrow at 10 p.m. on
PBS, was nominated for an Oscar, so it
must be pretty good.
Next week, however, KBHK broadcasts
three Alfred Hitchcock movies in a row:
"Rear Window" on Monday, "The Man
Who Knew Too Much" on Hiesday and
"Vertigo" on Wednesday.
