Wait! Don't let this hap
pen. This can't happen.
Not this time. What is
this, The Stanford Weekly, right?
Okay, it's accessible to 40,000 peo
ple or so. Now if I send this to The
New York Times and hope for a
"Voices of a New Generation"
spot on the Editorial Page, I could
reach millions, but I feel even that
would not be enough. I and we are
battling a tougher and heretofore
undefeated enemy: time.
Please, political gods — or
maybe Walter Lippman — just
this once, put some sense into the
collective mind of the public and
some real accountability in some
one important (senatorial level or
higher) in Washington D.C. and
let the issue be faced now. Today.
People, let's deal with the accu
sations against President George
Bush and others — claiming they
delayed the release of U.S.
hostages from Iran until after
Ronald Reagan won the 1980
election — now. Not after the
election. Not tomorrow. It's that
serious. If I robbed a house
tomorrow and got caught next
week, would they delay the trial
until after I've graduated from
Stanford Law School?
This time, let's not let them get
away with it. We allowed Richard
Nixon to be re-elected in 1972 by
what was then the greatest land
slide in U.S. history without
Watergate becoming an issue.
Guess which election beat
Nixon's for the greatest lopsided
victory ever? Reagan's first suc
cessful presidential bid, after his
thugs/brains directly violated the
Constitution and codified law by
illegally arming the contras with
stolen money, not to mention
chatting and dealing with our
then-number-one enemy, the
recently dethroned and decaying
King of Evil, Ayatollah Khomeni.
Change the "n" in Iran to a "q"
and what do you get? It's straight
out of George Orwell's "1984."
Now to the crux of the matter:
I can't drive down the freeway
without becoming bleary-eyed
from the sea of U.S. flags in every
one's windshield. We whooped
their butts! No more Vietnam
guilt. Buy Lee lacocca's 20-year
overdue-airbag-equipped cars.

I'm scared because people don't
care. Not about multi-billion dol
lar savings and loan scandals (too
boring). And not about possible
wrongdoings by our most popular
president ever 12 years ago.
And that's what it is right now:
possible. But the facts must come
out now, not when they are moot,
sometime in 1994. And the truth
is, I don't buy the information I'm
fed about how unconcerned "the
people" are about issues other
than war and strength. It was just
75 short years ago, one lifetime,
that the United States was so iso
lationist that Woodrow Wilson
almost saw his presidency collapse
when it appeared he advocated
entering the "Europeans' War."
The future of our society may
hang in the balance. Slowly but
surely, we are becoming immune
to the shocks of a government that
openly breaks the laws and vio
lates the document upon which
the republic is based. A few more
of these after-the-fact revelations,
and we won't even notice them
anymore. Stop the madness now.
"But we love our country now,"
they say. I love it, too, but it's
crumbling around us. "Mild reces
sion from which we are emerg
ing?" That's doublethink. And
unless someone acts to pull the
plug on it now, we may soon go the
way of Oceania.
And now as I write this admo
nition, I hear the NBC anchor
woman announcing, "President
Bush prepares for another mili
tary strike against Iraq." Hail, Big
Brother.
