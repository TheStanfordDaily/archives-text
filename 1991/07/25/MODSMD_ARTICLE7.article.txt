## Celebrating a birthday in anxious times 
### 
Birthdays and anniversaries are often a time
when we stop to realize what we have accom
plished, how we have erred and what our
future holds in store. The Stanford Centennial is
certainly no different. Stanford is well-recognized
and respected as an international leader in research
and education. But amid the hoopla and revelry of
its successes, the University must contend with
sobering facts about its recent past. We approach
this great 100-year milestone at a pivotal point in our
history.
It is a time for excitement. Stanford is a dynamic
university that draws its strength from faculty,
administration, students, alumni and cooperation
with outside institutions. The University's precedent
of serious academic study with an underlying current
of friendliness and openness is perhaps the key to
Stanford's numerous achievements.
But it is also a time when Stanford must face some
serious mistakes it has committed and try to remedy
them. We all know about such issues as the indirect
cost scandal, the charges of sexual harassment at the
Medical School and the impending budget cuts.
These are grave problems, the impact of which loom
low over the tremendous party the University will
soon be throwing. This is not the first time Stanford
has been in the negative limelight, but the present
difficulties come at a time when they might counter
act Stanford's tremendous potential for positive
achievement.
In its celebration, Stanford should not become so
aloof or decadent as to ignore negative aspects of the

present situation. Stanford will best remedy its "fall
from grace" if the University as a whole clearly works
together to implement needed reform, whether it is
by heightening sensitivity to the problems faced by
female and minority students or making the Univer
sity budget more efficient.
Stanford and its worldwide reputation as a lead
ing institution of higher education will be under
much scrutiny in the coming months. Soon, Stanford
will show itself off to the entire world, like a city
hosting the Olympics. With every major newspaper
in the country from the San Francisco Chronicle to
The New York Times covering the event, the Stan
ford Centennial will be a veritable media circus. The
way Stanford conducts itself during the Centennial
weekend will be a reflection on the University as a
whole.
In some ways, the Stanford Centennial closely
parallels the American bicentennial 15 years ago.
Even though most people were disillusioned with
America's leaderships and scandals such as Vietnam
and Watergate marred people's image of the country,
the nation could still celebrate itself.
Similarly, Stanford now prepares for its own birth
day party extravaganza. And the University must
decide how to venture into its next century.
True, Stanford has many dilemmas and problems
to solve, but the University also has an unqualified
right to be proud of itself after its century of great
endeavor. An event like this only happens once every
100 years. Enjoy it.
Happy Birthday, Stanford! (And many more.)
