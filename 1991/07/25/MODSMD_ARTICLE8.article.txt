Gym's space crunch
must be addressed
Here's a lesson in gym manage
ment: When overcrowding makes
it difficult to train in the gym, take
steps to increase the space and
bring in more equipment.
The Athletics Department,
however, is taking a different tack.
According to a spokesman, one
solution under active considera
tion is to restrict access during
peak periods by setting a limit on
how many are allowed to train or
how long they are permitted to
train.
Some background: Over the
past 10 years, as use of the Encina
Gym has greatly increased, no
efforts have been made by the
department to address problems
of overcrowding and only minimal
efforts have been made to
increase equipment or replace old
equipment with new.

Last January, a good step to
settling the space problem was
taken when the gymnastics team
transferred into the newly opened
Ford Center, and the Encina
training area expanded into the
vacated gymnastics room. Every
one expected that the next step
would be to begin adding new
equipment, since there suddenly
was space for it.
The department decided
instead to cut back on the space
for training by turning 15 percent
of it — one-half of the area spe
cially designed for heavy weight
training — into football confer
ence rooms. At the same time that
the remodeling began, the Ford
Center and Burnham Pavilion
were both closed for recreational
and intramural use, so Encina
became the only indoor athletic
facility open in that area of cam
pus.
The current state of over
crowding, which is likely to
become worse as fall quarter

begins, is the result of the depart
ment's recent decisions. Instead
of correcting those decisions, they
have chosen to punish the users of
Encina by proposing further
restrictions on access.
This is no way to design and
run a gym. Stanford students, who
contribute about $100 each per
year from their tuition toward the
budget of the Athletics Depart
ment, should rightly feel cheated
when their interests in fitness and
training are so held in contempt.

Alumnus desires
better leadership
for the University
During the past year, I have
written several letters to The
Stanford Daily that have been
extremely critical of University

President Donald Kennedy and
his administrators. I had hoped
that my doing so would motivate
the Stanford community, includ
ing the Board of Trustees, to wake
up and act decisively. This does
not appear to have occurred.
The indirect-cost decisions, as
well as other administrative
"problems" brought out recently,
have made matters worse for
Stanford instead of better. The
past few months should have been
enough to convince anyone and
everyone that Stanford's leaders
are incorrigible. Therefore, in one
last attempt, I have decided to
take matters into my own hands.
I will be attending football
games at Stanford Stadium this
fall. In tribute to Stanford's fine
tradition of the scholar-athlete,
which has taken a beating in
recent years, I will be wearing the
colors and logo of the Stanford
Indians. Since a suitable present
day logo (or mascot) for Stanford
does not exist, I may be forced to

design one myself.
The Stanford community
should be advised that I have no
desire to be a part of campus func
tions, nor will I become a member
of the Alumni Association as long
as Kennedy is Stanford's presi
dent. The day he is no longer in
charge is the day that I will
become a lifetime member. I will
not make any monetary contribu
tions to Stanford until the Univer
sity leadership changes.
My actions may seem a little
harsh. Some may even be amused
because, at the present time, my
company is small and inconse
quential. However, I am a man of
my word, and I say this to the
Stanford community: If the
actions required to make Stanford
a better place are not taken soon,
rest assured that if RTM Interna
tional ever becomes a major com
pany, we will be making our cor
porate contributions to USC.
