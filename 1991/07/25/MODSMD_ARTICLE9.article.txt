# Conserving water is simple, free and necessary
##

The mighty Colorado River,
the river that carved out the
Grand Canyon, no longer
reaches the ocean. Why? Because
we drink it.
By now everybody should know
that California is having another
dry year. In fact, California has
had a number of consecutive dry
years â€” about five, going on six, if
you're counting. The drought has
caused some very real water short
ages around the state, and there
doesn't seem to be any quick fix in

sight.
But there is something you can
do to make the situation better.
You can conserve water.
The word "conservation"
makes a lot of people squirmy.
Well, it shouldn't. Somehow "con
servation" got linked to the words
"don't shower." To relieve all of
you, I'll come out and say it: Con
serving water does not mean not
taking showers. It means using the
water you do use wisely.
There are a lot of simple things

you can do to save water.
The bathroom is the place
where the greatest percentage of
water in the home gets used. If
you brush your teeth with the
water running, you can use as
much as 10 gallons of water. But if
you wet your toothbrush and then
turn off the water while brushing,
you will only use about one gallon.
If you brush your teeth twice a
day in this manner, you will save
6,935 gallons a year.
Another area of high water

waste is the toilet. In fact, an
amazing 30 percent of the water
used in the average home gets
flushed down the toilet. Depend
ing on the size of your toilet's
tank, as much as seven gallons can
be used with each flush.
One simple thing you can do at
home to curb water waste is put a
water displacement container in
the tank. Toilets work perfectly
well with a gallon or so less water.
Simply get a plastic bottle, such as
a two-liter pop bottle, and put

some rocks in it to weight it down.
Then fill it all the way up with
water and put the cap on.
Now lift off the tank cover and
put the bottle in. Simple and free,
this two-liter bottle will save the
average home of three over 1,100
gallons of water a year.
A little common sense will save
a lot of water, and by doing your
part you can make a difference.
