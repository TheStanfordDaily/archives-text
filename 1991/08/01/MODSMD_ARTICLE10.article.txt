# Kennedy's letter of resignation
## 
### 
Dear Friends:
Our meeting tomorrow finds
Stanford at an important
historical moment. We face
many problems, some of which —
like earthquake repair and admin
istrative organization — were rec
ognized a year ago. We knew that
the solutions would take time and
concentrated effort. And entirely
new difficulties have burst upon us
suddenly, with unexpected ferocity
and potentially severe conse
quences.
As a result, we face formidable
challenges: to reshape the instiiu
tion and rebalance its budget, to
restore the faith of its several
publics, and to replace confusion
and doubt inside the Stanford
family with the usual confident
energy. As you know, we have been
working very hard at these chal
lenges — and as you also know,
much remains to be done.
The announcement last week of
our reform program on the indi
rect-cost issue will move us inex
orably forward to resolve our
problems with the government on
Stanford's accountability for feder
al funds. The resolution of these
problems will be neither swift nor
easy, but 1 believe it will be sure.
As we have engaged these prob
lems during the recent months, I
have been acutely conscious of
how distressing and difficult it is
for my colleagues to labor con
structively in an environment that
is so uncertain and so permeated
by critical outside attention. I have
also been fully aware of the pain
and uncertainty felt by members of
this Board, and by so many others
to whom this institution is so
important. The Stanford family is
an inclusive and nurturing congre
gation, and during the past months
it has suffered. You must know
that I have shared this pain in a
very personal way.
At this critical moment, it
will not be surprising to you
that I have been asking
myself hard questions about the
institution's leadership. What
actions on my part are most likely
to relieve ambiguity about our
direction, to heal internal differ
ences, and thus add to the momen
tum for change and improvement?
I have used the time since our
Commencement meeting to gather
views on this subject. I have sought
the advice of many thoughtful peo
ple, including especially some of
my wisest colleagues on the
Stanford faculty and members of
this Board. I am deeply grateful
both for the loyalty and the candor
that have characterized these con
versations. The warmth of the
expressions of support and the
astringent frankness of the criti
cism have both helped to form my
views.
Over the past six weeks, as I
reflected on this advice, my
own thinking shifted. With
great reluctance at first, but with
growing confidence, I reached the
conclusion that I share with you
now: I intend to step down as
President of Stanford University at
the end of the academic year 1991 -
1992.
I believe in change — and the
refreshing excitement that follows
the recognition that change is
coming. At present we are talking
too much about our problems and
too little about our opportunities.
And, to be quite frank about it,
there is entirely too much specula
tion about my future at Stanford.
It is very difficult, I have conclud
ed, for a person identified with a
problem to be the spokesman for
its solution.
We need to banish ambiguity
and to look to the future as we
resolve the problems of the past.
The prospect of new leadership
for our new direction will help lift
our gaze and renew our spirit.
And, knowing the lead-time that it
takes to select new leadership and
make an orderly transition, I think
we should begin that process at
once.
In the meantime, there is much
work to do. I want this to be a
productive year, one that
engages with the difficult work of
repair and finishes it, leaving a
clear track for my successor. I do
not intend it to be a lame-duck
assignment; I am going to make it
a labor of love, and I ask your
enthusiastic support in ensuring
that it produces the results we all
expect.
When that is done, I plan to
begin another venture about
which I am very excited. You prob
ably know that in my career as a
biologist, in government, and in
my few pro bono commitments
outside Stanford, environmental
concerns have loomed large. I
want to help make Stanford the
university for academic and policy
studies in this arena — a realistic
prospect given the extraordinary
human resources already repre
sented on this faculty and the
enthusiastic interest of its student
body. It is a great opportunity.
I look forward to realizing that
ambition — after I have done my
best to help form a new Stanford,
trimmed and reconfigured for its
second century, imbued with new
optimism, and faithful to its tradi
tions of excellence, of innovation
and of community.

and to look to the future as we
resolve the problems of the past.
The prospect of new leadership
for our new direction will help lift
our gaze and renew our spirit.
And, knowing the lead-time that it
takes to select new leadership and
make an orderly transition, I think
we should begin that process at
once.
In the meantime, there is much
work to do. I want this to be a
productive year, one that
engages with the difficult work of
repair and finishes it, leaving a
clear track for my successor. I do
not intend it to be a lame-duck
assignment; I am going to make it
a labor of love, and I ask your
enthusiastic support in ensuring
that it produces the results we all
expect.
When that is done, I plan to
begin another venture about
which I am very excited. You prob
ably know that in my career as a
biologist, in government, and in
my few pro bono commitments
outside Stanford, environmental
concerns have loomed large. I
want to help make Stanford the
university for academic and policy
studies in this arena — a realistic
prospect given the extraordinary
human resources already repre
sented on this faculty and the
enthusiastic interest of its student
body. It is a great opportunity.
I look forward to realizing that
ambition — after I have done my
best to help form a new Stanford,
trimmed and reconfigured for its
second century, imbued with new
optimism, and faithful to its tradi
tions of excellence, of innovation
and of community.
