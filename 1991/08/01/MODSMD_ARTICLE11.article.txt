## Medical School cuts 20 jobs 
### 
The School of Mcdicine last
week announced that 20 adminis
trative staff positions would be
eliminated during the next year as
part of a six-year budget-cutting
and deficit-reduction plan.
The cutback represents 16 per
cent of the work force of the
school's central administrative
services. Sixteen of the 20 posi
tions will be eliminated through
layoffs. The remaining four will be
accomplished through attrition.
Most of the layoffs will take
effect Sept. 1, but a few will be
staggered throughout the aca
demic year, said Karl Gray, direc
tor of the Medical School's
Human Resources Group. All will
be completed by the end of
August 1992.
The overall budget cutting plan
is in response to a projected $77.7
million cumulative deficit for the
next five years resulting from the
Navy's April reduction of the Uni
versity's indirect-cost rate to 55.5
percent. The University had origi
nally proposed a 78 percent rate,
which was used for budget plan
ning.
Federally funded research
accounts for about half of the
Medical School's annual budget,
said Dean David Korn. By con
trast, indirect costs account for
about 29 percent of the operating
budget of the University as a
whole.
As the Medical School has
grown in recent years, it has
become "exceedingly dependent
on federal funds," Korn said.
The expansion of the school
has also led to a set of multi-year
plans and commitments that "can
not be shut off as you would a
faucet," Korn said. In addition,
income projections were unrealis
tic, he added.

The Medical
School plans to
eliminate the
deficit through
expense reduc
tion, including
the staff layoffs,
and through the
use of University
reserves.

The Board of Trustees
approved spending up to $50 mil
lion from budget reserves over the
next five years to reduce the
deficit, Korn said. He added, "We
will do our best to stay under" that
figure.
The Medical School "cannot
keep running a deficit operation,"
Korn added.
The remainder of the deficit
will be eliminated through budget
reduction and administrative
reorganization similar to the Uni
versity's "repositioning" effort.
Gray said the Medical School
wants and will try to achieve the
reductions through elimination or
consolidation of programs, or
through attrition rather than lay
offs. However, there is some
"inevitability" about cutting the
work force, he added.
Some of the workers whose
positions are being eliminated
may be able to find other jobs
within the University through a
process developed as part of
"repositioning," Gray said.
"As of this .... time we are not
contemplating further reductions
in the work force," Gray said.
But as the budget-review pro
cess continues in the Medical
School's individual departments,
further layoffs are not necessarily
ruled out, he said.
The overall budget-reduction
plan, drafted by Korn, also calls
for:
• A seven percent cut in oper
ating budget expenses by aca

demic and administrative depart
ments,
• Canceling external searches
for chairs for the Departments of
Pharmacology and Neurosurgery,
• Delaying until March 1992
the implementation of next year's
salary increases, following the pol
icy set for the rest of the Univer
sity after the indirect-cost rate was
cut, and
• Canceling of plans to con
struct a new building to house the
Department of Anatomy.
Korn's plan would balance the
Medical School's budget by 1996.
But that depends on several fac
tors.
First, "we need to get back on a
rational standing with the govern
ment," he said. Stanford and the
federal government need to have
a reasonable, businesslike rela
tionship, he added.
The strength of the health-care
market will also affect the budget.
An economically robust clinical
care program is important to help
ing eradicate the deficit, he said.
The layoffs have been fairly
evenly distributed among the dif
ferent departments of central
administrative services according
to their sizes, Gray said.
Most of the directors in the
individual departments said the
layoffs would not cause major dis
ruptions in their services.
However, some minor effects,
particularly delays, can be
expected, officials said.
In the Lane Medical Library, a
total of seven positions were elim
inated, one through attrition. This
is about 10 percent of the library
staff.
Even with the reductions, the
"overall mission" of the library
will not change, said Library
Director Peter Stangl.
As part of last year's "reposi
tioning," the library had to cut
$40,000 from its budget for jour
nals. It plans to cut an additional
$35,000 this year.
Most of the ones that have
been cut are foreign languages
journals or are available in other
libraries on campus, Stangl said.
The library was able to comply
with most requests to keep jour
nals, he added.
"We're hoping that we don't
have to do much more" in terms
of service cutbacks, he said.
But the next few years will
require a "more conservative
approach to budgeting," he said.
Stangl added that he plans to sub
mit smaller expense and capital
purchase budgets than in the past.
The layoffs were the "most
painful and most difficult thing I

have had to do in my time at Stan
ford," he said.
Gerald Weitz, head of the
information systems group, said
his office probably won't cut back
on any of its essential services —
including management systems,
networking, maintenance and
development training.
His department's computer
consulting services may have to be
reduced, he said.

Despite efforts by the Historical Heritage Commission to designate it a state point of historical interest,
Synergy awaits demolition. The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday
to overturn the commission's recommendation to save the former fraternity house, which was damaged
in the Earthquake of 1989.
