# Synergy status overturned
## 
### 
The Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors voted unanimously
Tbesday to overturn the county
Historical Heritage Commission's
recommendation that Synergy be
designated a state point of historic
interest.
The decision was a victory for
University planning officials, who
plan to demolish the building, and
a blow to the small group of staff
and alumni that has lobbied to
save the earthquake-damaged,
turn-of-the-century residence.
County Supervisor Dianne
McKenna said the University's
decision to demolish Synergy
"best assesses the competing
interests and overall benefits" of
the various courses of action pos
sible. She also questioned the
county commission's decision that
Synergy is historically significant.
The Historical Heritage Com
mission had voted unanimously
July 11 to recommend that Syn
ergy be designated a state point of
historic interest. While that status
would not have prevented demoli
tion of the brown-shingled former
fraternity house, the six members
of the Committee to Save the Hill
Houses had hoped it would create
more opposition to the demoli
tion, scheduled to be completed
before the fall.
The University plans to replace
Synergy and the nearby Delta Tau
Delta house with revenue-gener
ating faculty housing. The income
would be used to finance the con
struction of new student housing
elsewhere on campus.
Last month, Planning Director
Phil Williams said the University
had decided to repair Phi Psi, the
third earthquake-damaged house
on San Juan Hill.
With regard to Tuesday's vote,
committe member Paul Baer said,
"We think the board just suc
cumbed to political pressure." He
adding that the board's decision
was the result of financial argu
ments presented by Williams

rather than a fair examination of
Synergy's historical merits. "The
board's decision was based on
considerations that it should not
have included."
Baer had argued before the
board that its vote "should be on
the merits of the claim of histori
cal status." To overturn the com
mission's recommendation, he
added, would be "to short-circuit
your historical judgment process."
But in a statement he read
before the board, Williams said,
"The building is not a great histor
ical design." He also argued that
the University's decision "serves a
greater public interest than can be
served by rebuilding the houses."
In an interview before the
board meeting, Williams called
the actions of the committee
"counterproductive" and said
opposition to the demolition is
confined to a very small but vocal
group. "If it was a groundswell, we
would know it,"he added.

Baer maintains the University
has not seriously explored other
ways to raise funds to repair the
damaged houses, ineluding asking
house alumni for support. He said
Stanford has several other poten
tial sites for constructing revenue
generating faculty housing.
Demolition of the houses is
scheduled to begin this month
Baer said the committee will
continue a letter-writing campaign
directed at alumni of the houses
and plans to challenge the envi
ronmental impact reports that the
University must have approved
before it can begin demolition.
