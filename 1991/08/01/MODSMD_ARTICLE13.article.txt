Egon Scotland, a German joui

Stanford in 1989-90, was killed
last Friday while reporting on the
fighting in Yugoslavia. He was 42.
He was severely wounded when
Serbian fighters shot at his car. He
died shortly afterward at a hospi
tal.
Scotland, a reporter for Siid
deutsche Zeitlung, a Munich
newspaper, had been reporting on
Yugoslavia for two weeks. He had
previously covered the Persian
Gulf war and been a parliamen
tary correspondent.
"Egon Scotland was a brilliant
man and a sensitive, compassion
ate, dedicated journalist," Knight
Fellowship Program Director
James Risser said in a statement.
"When I phoned his wife,
Christiane, after hearing of his
death, she told me that 'Egon's
Stanford year was so important to
him and gave him new ideas for
things he wanted to do and was
trying to do as a journalist.' " Riss
er said.
Scotland told The Daily in 1990
that he didn't believe having sepa
rate nations for different ethnic
groups would be successful.
Attempts at cultural and border
segregation are producing tension
that will soon force antagonists to
cooperate, he said.
