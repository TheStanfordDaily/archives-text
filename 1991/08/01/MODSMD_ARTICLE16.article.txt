# Committees tackle budget
## 
### 
Finding ways of solving the
University's budget crunch is the
focus for several University com
mittees this summer.
The Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning,
chaired by Provost James Rosse,
is looking at ways to manage the
budget and the strategic planning
process. It is examining areas such
as early retirement, cross-institu
tional issues, tuition-remission
and long-range vision.
It has also set up two task
forces, one on organizational
decentralization and one on cost
and income. The committee con
sists of 16 people, including
administrators, deans, faculty and
students.
The budget process is also
being monitored by a Trustee Sub
committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning made up of five
trustees.
The Faculty Senate Committee
on Education and Scholarship,
which consists of eight professors,
is designing its overall view of
what Stanford should be. It is also
advising on the budget and strate

gic planning process.
It has established five special
task forces on issues ranging from
undergraduate education to rev
enue enhancement.
In response to the indirect-cost
controversy, a special faculty com
mittee is making recommenda
tions on methods used in deter
mining cost allocations.
The Faculty Advisory Group on
Indirect Cost Studies, led by Dean
of Research Robert Byer, also
reviewed the policy of full-cost
recovery and recommended
changing to a cost-sharing system.
A group called the Vice Presi
dents Initiative has been examin
ing the relationships between
organizations and is trying to find
ways to improve administrative
efficiency. Led by Vice President
for Administrative Resources
Susan Schaffer, the committee
consists of Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Bob Freelen, the chief
financial officer, and several other
vice presidents.
The Faculty Senate is also look
ing at its own internal organiza
tion. Its Ad Hoc Committee on
the Structure and Function of
Standing Committees of the Aca
demic Council is looking to see if
committees need to change to
reflect new structures.
