# Stanford gets water refund
## 
### 
The San Francisco Water
Department last week reimbursed
Stanford for $244,697.75 in fines
accumulated for excess water use
last fall.
The University received the
credit because it has used less
than its monthly allotment from

the water department during the
past few months.
From August to November
1990, Stanford was fined more
than $300,000 for failing to com
ply with a 25 percent cut in water
consumption from 1987-88 levels.
The total credit was about
$302,000, but the University
applied part of it to the June
water bill.
Currently, Stanford is fined for
every gallon it consumes in excess
of its water allowance and is cred
ited for every gallon it saves.
The reduction in water use was
accomplished by decreasing the
University's water dependence on
San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy
reservoir system through in
creased use of well water and sys
tematic implentation of conserva
tion programs, said David Kaye,
Stanford's utilities manager.
He credited the cutback to "the
help of the entire Stanford com
munity and helpful hints on how
to conserve water."
Further water conservation
strategies include switching to
types of landscaping that require
less water than current methods,
installing meters in all faculty,
staff and student residences,
reducing such institutional use as
washing of university vehicles and
maintaining a high-profile public
awareness program.
"This problem (the drought) is
critical all over the state," added
Kaye. The Bay Area has been in
drought conditions for at least
four years. Kaye said water usage
should increase back to pre
drought levels only when the
water department believes that
reservoir water holdings have
returned to normal.
Kaye also stressed caution
about water use in the future. He
said even though people may be
aware of the water situation now,
they may begin to waste water
again if we get a significant
amount of rainfall.
"Even if we come out of it by
winter, the potential still exists for
future problems of this sort. In
California, droughts are a con
stant problem," Kaye said.

Utilities Manager David Kaye credits Stanford's water use cutback to
the entire community, but cautions that the drought is not over.
