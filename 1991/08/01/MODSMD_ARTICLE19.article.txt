# Stanford, Navy to meet Aug. 20
## 
### 
Officials from the University
and the Office of Naval Research
will return to the negotiating table
on Aug. 20, according to Larry
Horton, Stanford's associate vice
president for public affairs.

The two sides
will attempt to
reach a final
agreement on the
current year's in
direct-cost rate.
In April, the Navy
terminated close
to 100 accounting
agreements with
the University

and temporarily slashed Stanford's
indirect cost rate from a proposed
78 percent to 55.5 percent. The
Navy said it could no longer rely
on Stanford's cost formulas to
determine expenses.
The two parties had originally
been scheduled to negotiate a rate
for fiscal year 1992 at the same
August meeting, but it now
appears that won't happen, accord
ing to Horton. The University has
proposed a rate of 76 percent for
1992. Navy negotiator Paul Biddle
said he considers the proposal
"outrageous."
Stanford and the Navy must
also negotiate final rates for sever
al years from the past decade.
Biddle has alleged the University
overbilled the government by as
much as $200 million during that
period.
