# Spence verdict expected soon
## 
### 
Business School Dean Michael
Spence is expected to issue a judg
ment early this month on charges
that Lecturer Richard Pascale
plagiarized portions of his recent
book from an earlier magazine
article.
Pascale has admitted that his
book, "Managing on the Edge:
How the Smartest Companies Use
Conflict to Stay Ahead," contains
passages lifted from a 1986 Wash
ington Monthly article by Gregg
Easterbrook, a Newsweek corre
spondent. Excerpts from Pascale's
book appeared in the September
1990 Stanford Business School
Magazine.
The University was notified of
the similarities between Pascale's
and Easterbrook's work in April
by a reader. As part of the Busi
ness School's investigation, a fac
ulty committee has prepared a
preliminary report on the case for
Spence.
