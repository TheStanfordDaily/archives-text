# Highlights of Donald Kennedy's presidency
## 
### 
Financial
Growth of endowment. During Kennedy's tenure, Stanford's endowment tripled to
almost $2 billion.
Centennial Campaign. The University's five-year fund-raising campaign was launched
in February 1987. It passed its $1.1 billion goals ahead of schedule, in June 1991.
Loma Prieta earthquake. On Oct. 17, 1989, a 7.1 earthquake rocked the Bay Area
causing $160 million in damage to the Stanford campus.

$22 million budget cuts. In
February 1990 the University
announced an 18-month
"repositioning" program
intended to balance Stan
ford's operating budget.
More than 100 employees
were laid off.
indirect-cost hit. After
negotiations between the
Office of Naval Research
and Stanford broke down in
April 1991, the Navy termi
nated close to 100 account
ing agreements and
slashed the University's
indirect cost rate from a pro
posed 78 percent to 55.5
percent. The University is
facing a two-year shortfall of
$95 million as a result.
Academic

Western Culture/CIV. A
two-year debate on the future of the Western Culture program was resolved in March
1988 when the Faculty Senate adopted a compromise program called Cultures, Ideas
and Values. Beginning in fall 1989, freshmen would study — in addition to the tradi
tional "great works" — women, minorities and class issues, and works from at least
one non-European culture.
Stanford In Washington. A new Stanford campus was dedicated in the nation's cap
ital in May 1988.
Overseas campuses. During Kennedy's tenure, Stanford added overseas campuses
in Kyoto, Japan, and Oxford, England. Financial constraints later forced the University
to close its campus in Tours, France.

Teaching initiative. In a
landmark speech on
"Stanford in its Second
Century," Kennedy called on
faculty members to renew
their commitment to teaching
as "first among our labors."
$7 million in new pro
grams. Following up on his
speech from the previous
spring, Kennedy unveiled a
package of initiatives to
improve undergraduate edu
cation in March 1991.
Included were measures
were financial rewards for
outstanding teachers and
controversial proposed mod-

ifications to the promotion and hiring process.
Diversity
UCMI report Following an 18-month study, the University Committee on Minority Issues
released a 240-page report containing more than 100 recommendations it said could
help fulfill the University's commitment to become a "genuinely pluralistic community."
Office takeover. More than 50 students were arrested in May 1989 for occupying
Kennedy's office. The students, who called themselves the Agenda for Action coali
tion, pressed demands for more minority faculty and full-time ethnic deans.
Domestic partners. In October 1990 the administration announced a new policy
putting unmarried student domestic partners on the same footing as married couples
for university housing and other privileges.
Expansion
Center for Integrated Systems. Ground was broken for this joint venture between 20
industry sponsors and Stanford faculty and students in May 1983.
Center for the Study of Language and Information. A $21 million gift in November 1983
led to the creation of the center, a major institution for the development of integrated the-

ories of language, informa
tion and computation.
Near West campus. In
June 1985 the Board of
Trustees approved the con
cept of redeveloping a 41-
acre science and engineer
ing complex at an estimated
cost of $250 million. Budget
cuts and the earthquake led
the University to scale down
those plans significantly.
Stanford University
Hospital. Kennedy oversaw
the separation of the hospi
tal into a more autonomous
organization, and was
behind a number of pro
jects, including the $53 mil
lion Beckman Center for
Molecular and Genetic

medicine and the $100 million Lucille Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.
Political
Reagan Library. In April 1985 the Trustees selected a site in the Foothills for the pro
posed Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. In April 1987 the Faculty Senate urged the
Trustees to scale down the facility or move it from the center of campus. A few weeks
later, Reagan Presidential Foundation officials informed the University of their intention
to build the library in Southern California.
Gorbachev. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev swept through campus on June 4,1990.
Relations with Hoover. John Raisian was named to succeed W. Glenn Campbell as
director of the Hoover Institution in August 1989. The move warmed relations between
the University and the think tank.
