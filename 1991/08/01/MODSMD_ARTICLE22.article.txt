# When to say When
## Kennedy shares lessons of leadership 
### John Wagner 
In his address last month at Stanford's
100 th Commencement, a battle-weary
University President Donald Kennedy
shared five lessons he said he had learned
from the University's much-publicized trou
bles with the federal government.
Trust your own values, he told the more
than 30,000 spectators and graduates gath
ered in Stanford Stadium that day under a
cloudless blue sky, treasure your friend
ships, learn from your pain, hold on to your
dignity and — most importantly — don't let
the embarrassment and hardship he had
suffered during the year deter you from
seizing leadership opportunities.
Yesterday, in the solitude of his campus
office, Kennedy shared a sixth lesson
learned from the ongoing controversy over
Stanford's indirect-cost policies:
"A part of leadership really is knowing
when to say when," he said.
On Monday, after weeks of consultation
with faculty, fellow administrators and close
friends, Kennedy decided it was time to "say
when."

He announced to the Board of Trustees
that he would serve only one more year as
Stanford's eighth president.
"I believe in change — and the refreshing
excitement that follows the recognition that
change is coming," Kennedy wrote in his let
ter of resignation.
"At present we are talking too much
about our problems and too little about our
opportunities. And, to be quite frank about
it, there is entirely too much speculation
about my future at Stanford We need to
banish ambiguity and to look to the future
as we resolve the problems of the past."
Kennedy's decision follows a year during
which the University was widely ridiculed in
the press for charging the government for
depreciation on a yacht and other inappro
priate items; during which Kennedy
received several scathing lectures from
members of a congressional panel for his
mismanagement of federal funds; and dur
ing which the Office of Naval Research first
claimed Stanford was using unreliable for
mulas to justify its research expenses and
subsequently slashed annual indirect-cost

reimbursements to the University by close
to $28 million.
In an hour-long interview with The
Weekly yesterday, Kennedy spoke openly
about his reasons for resigning, his plans for
the final year of his presidency, and the con
troversy over indirect-cost recovery that has
enveloped both Stanford and his presiden
cy. ,
"I wasn't going to be president much
longer than this under the best of circum
stances," said Kennedy, who, at 59, is begin
ning his 12th year in the position.
"The question that was before me this
summer was how can 1 most effectively wind
up this presidency," he explained. "Was it
with a more prolonged but very uncertain
period in charge? Or is it with a year . ..
with the doubts clarified and everybody
pulling together? I think I can create the
second situation, and I think we can do a lot
in the next 12 months.
"I expcct to walk out of this office feeling
a lot better about things."
The financial fallout from the controver
sy has left the University with a
Herculean task for the coming year
— the need to reduce its $400 mil
lion operating budget by about 10
percent. Doing so will inevitably
involve academic program cuts and
a re-evaluation of the University's
priorities. It's a process too impor
tant to be hampered by speculation

about his future, Kennedy said.
"What I learned during the past few
weeks is that ambiguity and uncertainty arc
destructive to any organization, but abso
lutely corrosive to one that is organization
ally and politically diffuse," Kennedy said.
"People were beginning to do things like
identify one another in terms of who wants
me to stay and who doesn't want me to stay.
That's not a question that should have to be
asked.... I thought it was time to get things
clear."
By announcing his intention to resign,
Kennedy said, he hopes the University com
munity will be able to pull together and
tackle the budget situation. "In a way I feel
a new energy for the task," he said. "I think
people will feel more focused n0w.... It's
very important to get a good consensus on
some of these tough choices and hard choic
es.
"One of the things I'm sorry about in the
context of there having been so much con
tention in this past year is that it's going to
endanger the sense of community that we
have and should always treasure. I think

some of the criticism within [the University]
has had a tone of nastiness that I hope we
can now stop."
Kennedy has accepted responsibility for
the controversy and its tarnishing of the
University's reputation, but he contends
there is little that could have been done to
head off the problem when it arose in the
fall.
"There is no episode in life that I could
not repeat more productively or better if I
knew in advance how it was going to come
out," he told reporters at a crowded press
conference Tuesday morning. "But I don't
think that, in general, a very different strat
egy with respect to the indirect-cost prob
lem would have yielded a very different
result."
According to Kennedy, the fallout at
Stanford has resulted from the unforeseen
melding of "many elements."
"1 don't think there is a brief explana
tion," he told The Weekly. "For various rea
sons — the presence of [the outspoken on
campus federal regulator] Paul Biddle, the
complaints of faculty members, Stanford's
prominence and importance — there has
been very intense scrutiny, far more intense
than any other university has had.
"Our [accounting and internal control]
systems were found wanting — there's no
question about it. And we have paid a very
heavy price for that. I'm not here to say that
it's inappropriately heavy, but it was very

heavy."
Looking back, Kennedy said, there
were some occasions earlier in his presi
dency when steps could have been taken
that might have prevented this year's
"mess."
"There was a point in 1984 or 1985," he
said, "when we were getting political pres
sure from the [federal granting] agencies
about indirect-cost rates, about which 1
might have said, 'Let's get a distinguished
visiting panel to come in and ask some
hard questions and give us some advice
about how we can improve our account
ability.'
"I could have asked harder questions
about why internal audit wasn't doing more
in the area (of indirect-cost recovery). Or
why our external auditors didn't have that in
their audit plan. I'm not trying to put blame
on anybody here. I've tried to mention all
the elements that go into guarding in the
area of accountability.
"It certainly wasn't that we weren't pay
ing attention to indirect-cost recovery,"
Kennedy said. "I asked the controller ...

what I thought were hard questions.... I
was very comfortable with the answers we
were getting. And indeed I thought the con
troller was very conscientious.
"The error-level was low, but plainly not
low enough to be acceptable under the kind
of standard we're talking about now."
Kennedy and other University officials,
including Peter Van Etten, the
University's new chief financial offi
cer, contend that Stanford's accounting sys
tem is not substantially different than that
of any other research university.
Stanford, however, was selected as the
first case study of Rep. John Dingcll, the
powerful Michigan Democrat whose sub
committee spent a blustery mid-March day
grilling Kennedy about the University's
accounting practices. Dingell has since
moved on to other universities, but
Stanford's name continues to appear promi
nently in the media.
"We were the first penguin off the ice
flow," Kennedy said, "and it wasn't a lot of
fun."
In an effort to regain public trust, the
University unveiled a comprehensive set of
accounting reforms last week. The measures
will cost Stanford millions of dollars to

implement. When completed, the
University's accounting system will more
closely resemble that of a major for-profit
defense contractor than that of a research
university, Stanford officials say.
Kennedy, however, is worried that the
reforms go to far. "If we and everyone else
have to do cost-accounting at that level, it's
an unfortunate science policy," he said. "I
think it's overkill.
"Nothing that has happened at Stanford,
none of the costs that we've returned, none
of the costs that MIT has returned for most
of the same things, or CalTech or Harvard,
indicates that universities don't deserve to
maintain a relationship with the government
of trust. If rules are clear, universities are
going to abide by them.
"We've all learned a lesson," Kennedy
said, "and we'll all be more scrupulous. But
ensuring that by imposing the paperwork
and accounting requirements of the defense
contracting industry is, in my opinion, a very
unfortunate outcome — bad for the nation's
science."
A year from now, Kennedy plans to
return to his roots as a scientist.
Though his plans are not yet con
crete, he said he hopes to take a year-long

working sabbatical and then contribute in
some capacity to the development of envi
ronmental studies at Stanford.
"1 really think the environmental crisis
that we're facing is so compelling," Kennedy
said, "that anybody who has the training,
experience, credentials and influence to
make a difference on it just has to pay some
attention to it, and I have paid some atten
tion to it, but not nearly as much as I should
have."
Kennedy said he is considering a num
ber of ways of making such a difference,
ranging from teaching courses for the new
Earth Systems core to helping establish
an environmental policy institute at
Stanford.
"What I want Stanford people to under
stand," Kennedy said, "is that I'm not going
to step out the presidency and take charge
of something that other people have already
developed.... I want to play a really con
structive role, but for awhile I'll need to be
directed by other people. I'm going to be a
foot soldier."
In some ways, Kennedy said, he'll be glad
to be getting out of his general's uniform.
"But in some ways I liked it,"he said. "In
some ways it was a great opportunity to
speak up for things I really believed in."

that he would serve only one more year as
Stanford's eighth president.
"I believe in change — and the refreshing
excitement that follows the recognition that
change is coming," Kennedy wrote in his let
ter of resignation.
"At present we are talking too much
about our problems and too little about our
opportunities. And, to be quite frank about
it, there is entirely too much speculation
about my future at Stanford We need to
banish ambiguity and to look to the future
as we resolve the problems of the past."
Kennedy's decision follows a year during
which the University was widely ridiculed in
the press for charging the government for
depreciation on a yacht and other inappro
priate items; during which Kennedy
received several scathing lectures from
members of a congressional panel for his
mismanagement of federal funds; and dur
ing which the Office of Naval Research first
claimed Stanford was using unreliable for
mulas to justify its research expenses and
subsequently slashed annual indirect-cost

reimbursements to the University by close
to $28 million.
In an hour-long interview with The
Weekly yesterday, Kennedy spoke openly
about his reasons for resigning, his plans for
the final year of his presidency, and the con
troversy over indirect-cost recovery that has
enveloped both Stanford and his presiden
cy. ,
"I wasn't going to be president much
longer than this under the best of circum
stances," said Kennedy, who, at 59, is begin
ning his 12th year in the position.
"The question that was before me this
summer was how can 1 most effectively wind
up this presidency," he explained. "Was it
with a more prolonged but very uncertain
period in charge? Or is it with a year . ..
with the doubts clarified and everybody
pulling together? I think I can create the
second situation, and I think we can do a lot
in the next 12 months.
"I expcct to walk out of this office feeling
a lot better about things."
The financial fallout from the controver
sy has left the University with a
Herculean task for the coming year
— the need to reduce its $400 mil
lion operating budget by about 10
percent. Doing so will inevitably
involve academic program cuts and
a re-evaluation of the University's
priorities. It's a process too impor
tant to be hampered by speculation

about his future, Kennedy said.
"What I learned during the past few
weeks is that ambiguity and uncertainty arc
destructive to any organization, but abso
lutely corrosive to one that is organization
ally and politically diffuse," Kennedy said.
"People were beginning to do things like
identify one another in terms of who wants
me to stay and who doesn't want me to stay.
That's not a question that should have to be
asked.... I thought it was time to get things
clear."
By announcing his intention to resign,
Kennedy said, he hopes the University com
munity will be able to pull together and
tackle the budget situation. "In a way I feel
a new energy for the task," he said. "I think
people will feel more focused n0w.... It's
very important to get a good consensus on
some of these tough choices and hard choic
es.
"One of the things I'm sorry about in the
context of there having been so much con
tention in this past year is that it's going to
endanger the sense of community that we
have and should always treasure. I think

some of the criticism within [the University]
has had a tone of nastiness that I hope we
can now stop."
Kennedy has accepted responsibility for
the controversy and its tarnishing of the
University's reputation, but he contends
there is little that could have been done to
head off the problem when it arose in the
fall.
"There is no episode in life that I could
not repeat more productively or better if I
knew in advance how it was going to come
out," he told reporters at a crowded press
conference Tuesday morning. "But I don't
think that, in general, a very different strat
egy with respect to the indirect-cost prob
lem would have yielded a very different
result."
According to Kennedy, the fallout at
Stanford has resulted from the unforeseen
melding of "many elements."
"1 don't think there is a brief explana
tion," he told The Weekly. "For various rea
sons — the presence of [the outspoken on
campus federal regulator] Paul Biddle, the
complaints of faculty members, Stanford's
prominence and importance — there has
been very intense scrutiny, far more intense
than any other university has had.
"Our [accounting and internal control]
systems were found wanting — there's no
question about it. And we have paid a very
heavy price for that. I'm not here to say that
it's inappropriately heavy, but it was very

heavy."
Looking back, Kennedy said, there
were some occasions earlier in his presi
dency when steps could have been taken
that might have prevented this year's
"mess."
"There was a point in 1984 or 1985," he
said, "when we were getting political pres
sure from the [federal granting] agencies
about indirect-cost rates, about which 1
might have said, 'Let's get a distinguished
visiting panel to come in and ask some
hard questions and give us some advice
about how we can improve our account
ability.'
"I could have asked harder questions
about why internal audit wasn't doing more
in the area (of indirect-cost recovery). Or
why our external auditors didn't have that in
their audit plan. I'm not trying to put blame
on anybody here. I've tried to mention all
the elements that go into guarding in the
area of accountability.
"It certainly wasn't that we weren't pay
ing attention to indirect-cost recovery,"
Kennedy said. "I asked the controller ...

what I thought were hard questions.... I
was very comfortable with the answers we
were getting. And indeed I thought the con
troller was very conscientious.
"The error-level was low, but plainly not
low enough to be acceptable under the kind
of standard we're talking about now."
Kennedy and other University officials,
including Peter Van Etten, the
University's new chief financial offi
cer, contend that Stanford's accounting sys
tem is not substantially different than that
of any other research university.
Stanford, however, was selected as the
first case study of Rep. John Dingcll, the
powerful Michigan Democrat whose sub
committee spent a blustery mid-March day
grilling Kennedy about the University's
accounting practices. Dingell has since
moved on to other universities, but
Stanford's name continues to appear promi
nently in the media.
"We were the first penguin off the ice
flow," Kennedy said, "and it wasn't a lot of
fun."
In an effort to regain public trust, the
University unveiled a comprehensive set of
accounting reforms last week. The measures
will cost Stanford millions of dollars to

implement. When completed, the
University's accounting system will more
closely resemble that of a major for-profit
defense contractor than that of a research
university, Stanford officials say.
Kennedy, however, is worried that the
reforms go to far. "If we and everyone else
have to do cost-accounting at that level, it's
an unfortunate science policy," he said. "I
think it's overkill.
"Nothing that has happened at Stanford,
none of the costs that we've returned, none
of the costs that MIT has returned for most
of the same things, or CalTech or Harvard,
indicates that universities don't deserve to
maintain a relationship with the government
of trust. If rules are clear, universities are
going to abide by them.
"We've all learned a lesson," Kennedy
said, "and we'll all be more scrupulous. But
ensuring that by imposing the paperwork
and accounting requirements of the defense
contracting industry is, in my opinion, a very
unfortunate outcome — bad for the nation's
science."
A year from now, Kennedy plans to
return to his roots as a scientist.
Though his plans are not yet con
crete, he said he hopes to take a year-long

working sabbatical and then contribute in
some capacity to the development of envi
ronmental studies at Stanford.
"1 really think the environmental crisis
that we're facing is so compelling," Kennedy
said, "that anybody who has the training,
experience, credentials and influence to
make a difference on it just has to pay some
attention to it, and I have paid some atten
tion to it, but not nearly as much as I should
have."
Kennedy said he is considering a num
ber of ways of making such a difference,
ranging from teaching courses for the new
Earth Systems core to helping establish
an environmental policy institute at
Stanford.
"What I want Stanford people to under
stand," Kennedy said, "is that I'm not going
to step out the presidency and take charge
of something that other people have already
developed.... I want to play a really con
structive role, but for awhile I'll need to be
directed by other people. I'm going to be a
foot soldier."
In some ways, Kennedy said, he'll be glad
to be getting out of his general's uniform.
"But in some ways I liked it,"he said. "In
some ways it was a great opportunity to
speak up for things I really believed in."

In his address last month at Stanford's
100 th Commencement, a battle-weary
University President Donald Kennedy
shared five lessons he said he had learned
from the University's much-publicized trou
bles with the federal government.
Trust your own values, he told the more
than 30,000 spectators and graduates gath
ered in Stanford Stadium that day under a
cloudless blue sky, treasure your friend
ships, learn from your pain, hold on to your
dignity and — most importantly — don't let
the embarrassment and hardship he had
suffered during the year deter you from
seizing leadership opportunities.
Yesterday, in the solitude of his campus
office, Kennedy shared a sixth lesson
learned from the ongoing controversy over
Stanford's indirect-cost policies:
"A part of leadership really is knowing
when to say when," he said.
On Monday, after weeks of consultation
with faculty, fellow administrators and close
friends, Kennedy decided it was time to "say
when."

He announced to the Board of Trustees
that he would serve only one more year as
Stanford's eighth president.

about his reasons for resigning, his plans for
the final year of his presidency, and the con
troversy over indirect-cost recovery that has
enveloped both Stanford and his presiden
cy. ,
"I wasn't going to be president much
longer than this under the best of circum
stances," said Kennedy, who, at 59, is begin
ning his 12th year in the position.
"The question that was before me this
summer was how can 1 most effectively wind
up this presidency," he explained. "Was it
with a more prolonged but very uncertain
period in charge? Or is it with a year . ..
with the doubts clarified and everybody
pulling together? I think I can create the
second situation, and I think we can do a lot
in the next 12 months.
"I expcct to walk out of this office feeling
a lot better about things."
The financial fallout from the controver
sy has left the University with a
Herculean task for the coming year
— the need to reduce its $400 mil
lion operating budget by about 10
percent. Doing so will inevitably
involve academic program cuts and
a re-evaluation of the University's
priorities. It's a process too impor
tant to be hampered by speculation

about his future, Kennedy said.
"What I learned during the past few
weeks is that ambiguity and uncertainty arc
destructive to any organization, but abso
lutely corrosive to one that is organization
ally and politically diffuse," Kennedy said.
"People were beginning to do things like
identify one another in terms of who wants
me to stay and who doesn't want me to stay.
That's not a question that should have to be
asked.... I thought it was time to get things
clear."
By announcing his intention to resign,
Kennedy said, he hopes the University com
munity will be able to pull together and
tackle the budget situation. "In a way I feel
a new energy for the task," he said. "I think
people will feel more focused n0w.... It's
very important to get a good consensus on
some of these tough choices and hard choic
es.
"One of the things I'm sorry about in the
context of there having been so much con
tention in this past year is that it's going to
endanger the sense of community that we
have and should always treasure. I think

some of the criticism within [the University]
has had a tone of nastiness that I hope we
can now stop."
Kennedy has accepted responsibility for
the controversy and its tarnishing of the
University's reputation, but he contends
there is little that could have been done to
head off the problem when it arose in the
fall.
"There is no episode in life that I could
not repeat more productively or better if I
knew in advance how it was going to come
out," he told reporters at a crowded press
conference Tuesday morning. "But I don't
think that, in general, a very different strat
egy with respect to the indirect-cost prob
lem would have yielded a very different
result."
According to Kennedy, the fallout at
Stanford has resulted from the unforeseen
melding of "many elements."
"1 don't think there is a brief explana
tion," he told The Weekly. "For various rea
sons — the presence of [the outspoken on
campus federal regulator] Paul Biddle, the
complaints of faculty members, Stanford's
prominence and importance — there has
been very intense scrutiny, far more intense
than any other university has had.
"Our [accounting and internal control]
systems were found wanting — there's no
question about it. And we have paid a very
heavy price for that. I'm not here to say that
it's inappropriately heavy, but it was very

heavy."
Looking back, Kennedy said, there
were some occasions earlier in his presi
dency when steps could have been taken
that might have prevented this year's
"mess."
"There was a point in 1984 or 1985," he
said, "when we were getting political pres
sure from the [federal granting] agencies
about indirect-cost rates, about which 1
might have said, 'Let's get a distinguished
visiting panel to come in and ask some
hard questions and give us some advice
about how we can improve our account
ability.'
"I could have asked harder questions
about why internal audit wasn't doing more
in the area (of indirect-cost recovery). Or
why our external auditors didn't have that in
their audit plan. I'm not trying to put blame
on anybody here. I've tried to mention all
the elements that go into guarding in the
area of accountability.
"It certainly wasn't that we weren't pay
ing attention to indirect-cost recovery,"
Kennedy said. "I asked the controller ...

what I thought were hard questions.... I
was very comfortable with the answers we
were getting. And indeed I thought the con
troller was very conscientious.
"The error-level was low, but plainly not
low enough to be acceptable under the kind
of standard we're talking about now."
Kennedy and other University officials,
including Peter Van Etten, the
University's new chief financial offi
cer, contend that Stanford's accounting sys
tem is not substantially different than that
of any other research university.
Stanford, however, was selected as the
first case study of Rep. John Dingcll, the
powerful Michigan Democrat whose sub
committee spent a blustery mid-March day
grilling Kennedy about the University's
accounting practices. Dingell has since
moved on to other universities, but
Stanford's name continues to appear promi
nently in the media.
"We were the first penguin off the ice
flow," Kennedy said, "and it wasn't a lot of
fun."
In an effort to regain public trust, the
University unveiled a comprehensive set of
accounting reforms last week. The measures
will cost Stanford millions of dollars to

implement. When completed, the
University's accounting system will more
closely resemble that of a major for-profit
defense contractor than that of a research
university, Stanford officials say.
Kennedy, however, is worried that the
reforms go to far. "If we and everyone else
have to do cost-accounting at that level, it's
an unfortunate science policy," he said. "I
think it's overkill.
"Nothing that has happened at Stanford,
none of the costs that we've returned, none
of the costs that MIT has returned for most
of the same things, or CalTech or Harvard,
indicates that universities don't deserve to
maintain a relationship with the government
of trust. If rules are clear, universities are
going to abide by them.
"We've all learned a lesson," Kennedy
said, "and we'll all be more scrupulous. But
ensuring that by imposing the paperwork
and accounting requirements of the defense
contracting industry is, in my opinion, a very
unfortunate outcome — bad for the nation's
science."
A year from now, Kennedy plans to
return to his roots as a scientist.
Though his plans are not yet con
crete, he said he hopes to take a year-long

working sabbatical and then contribute in
some capacity to the development of envi
ronmental studies at Stanford.
"1 really think the environmental crisis
that we're facing is so compelling," Kennedy
said, "that anybody who has the training,
experience, credentials and influence to
make a difference on it just has to pay some
attention to it, and I have paid some atten
tion to it, but not nearly as much as I should
have."
Kennedy said he is considering a num
ber of ways of making such a difference,
ranging from teaching courses for the new
Earth Systems core to helping establish
an environmental policy institute at
Stanford.
"What I want Stanford people to under
stand," Kennedy said, "is that I'm not going
to step out the presidency and take charge
of something that other people have already
developed.... I want to play a really con
structive role, but for awhile I'll need to be
directed by other people. I'm going to be a
foot soldier."
In some ways, Kennedy said, he'll be glad
to be getting out of his general's uniform.
"But in some ways I liked it,"he said. "In
some ways it was a great opportunity to
speak up for things I really believed in."
