In the 1980s, there were 14 no
hitters. Roughly average for a
decade of baseball since the
turn of the century.
These days, it seems like some
one is throwing one every other
day. Sometimes, it's the worthy,
like Nolan Ryan. Oftentimes its
the weird, like Tommy Greene.
This past week it was the wonder
ful, Dennis Martinez, and the
"Will it go in the record books?"
Mark Gardner.
What's going on? No one
seems to know for sure. Logic
would dictate that in this era of
mediocre pitchers, the most sub
lime of pitching performances
would be as rare as a hot, sunny
day in San Francisco.
Instead, the Associated Press
sends out what it calls a "no-hit"
advisory more than ever. It goes
like this. "Dennis Martinez has a
perfect game through sue innings.
The Expos lead the Dodgers 2-0."
For most of those, the AP fol
lows up with something along
these lines: "Brian Harper singled
off Nolan Ryan with two outs in
the seventh. The Rangers lead the
-Rvins 1-0."
After last year's eight "no-nos"
— as in no-hit, no-run games —
people expected things would
quiet down this season. Perhaps,
the odds seemed to indicate, it
would be a no no-no year.
But no. The season is not yet
two-thirds gone and five no-hit
ters — or four, depending on who
you believe — are already in the
books. While Johnny Vander
meer's back-to-back no-hitters
remain the one record in baseball
that will absolutely never be bro
ken — tied maybe — the Dodgers
did manage to get no-hit twice in
the same weekend. Sort of.
When Gardner threw nine hit
less innings against Los Angeles
on Friday night, his Expo team
mates failed to do something crit
ical — score a run. He got
touched in the 10th for a single
run and, instead of getting cred
ited with a no-hitter, all he got was
a loss. Sort of.
The Elias Sports Bureau, offi
cial purveyor of statistics for
major-league baseball, says that
Gardner will be placed on a spe
cial list of pitchers who tossed
nine innings of no-hit ball but
didn't win it in regulation. Histor
ically, said hurlers have been
losers.
Like Harvey Haddix, who was
on the mound in history's second
most famous no-hitter. Haddix
spun 12 perfect innings on May
26, 1959, facing the minimum 36
batters along the way. A finer
game had never been pitched,
before or since. If you eliminate
the 13th inning, in which Haddix
lost the game.
The Sporting News, keepers of
baseball records separate from
those of Elias', includes Haddix
on its all-time no-hitter list.
They'll probably list Gardner as
well. Major League Baseball, for
its own part, knows not what a no
no is — there is no rule to refer to.
Martinez doesn't have Gard
ner's problem. He faced just 27
Dodgers, retired each one, and
had the good fortune of a little
run support. T\vo runs worth in
fact, and neither was earned.
Alfredo Griffin made a pair of
errors in the seventh to help Mon
treal out.
Almost unbelievably, the
Dodgers' Mike Morgan was no
hitting the Expos that day as well.
The Expos first base hit came in

the sixth, when Ron Hassey sin
gled. Up to that point, it was five
innings without a batter taking
affirmative action to reach base.
Take that, rotisserie leaguers.
For the 36-year-old Martinez,
the gem was the ultimate cap on
his return from alcohol problems.
In 1987, he was in the minor
leagues, trying to make it back.
Since then, he's gone 66-47 —
with one perfecto.
As a matter of fact, one of only
15 nine-inning perfect games ever
thrown. The one for the ages —
Don Larsen in the 1956 World
Series. Not that great a pitcher,
but certainly one-of baseball's
greatest moments.
The greats that have been per
fect: Sandy Koufax, who domi
nated an era like no other; Catfish
Hunter, a great player who played
for some great teams; and Cy
Young, who recorded 511 wins
and has some award named after
him.
But the Gods of Pitching Per
fection have smiled on several
lesser lights. The "What the hell
are these guys doing with Koufax,
Catfish and Cy?" list — Len
Barker, Cleveland, parlayed the
game into a robbery of the Braves;
Tom Browning, who won 20 as a
rookie but isn't exactly on an
express train to Cooperstown; and
Mike Witt, the American
League's most feared right-han
der — for about two months in
the mid-'Bos.
Finally, there's the Imperfect
Perfect Game. "Hey Elias, this
counts?" — Ernie Shore retired
27 straight Washington Senators
for the Boston Red Sox on June
23, 1917. Only he wasn't the
starter. A big guy named Babe
Ruth was. Ruth put the first guy
on and then was tossed by the
umpire for, shall we say, a few dis
couraging words.
Shore came in, the runner was
caught stealing, and the rest, as
they say, was history.
My favorite no-hit story is, like
Gardner's, about one that wasn't.
A rookie named Dwight Gooden
took the hill on Monday Night
Baseball and a certain brother of
mine said, "He's going to pitch a
no-hitter."
Remarkably, Gooden did just
that. Sort of.
The only "hit" was a slow roller
to Ray Knight that the third base
man threw away. Incredibly, this
error was ruled a hit and Gooden
settled for the one-hitter. In the
seven years since that game, the
Mets, with their vaunted pitching
staff, have been unable to just say
no.
As a matter of fact, in their 30-
year history, New York has never
thrown a no-hitter. Tom Seaver
tossed his gem for Cincinnati. Go
figure.

umpire for, shall we say, a few dis
couraging words.
Shore came in, the runner was
caught stealing, and the rest, as
they say, was history.
My favorite no-hit story is, like
Gardner's, about one that wasn't.
A rookie named Dwight Gooden
took the hill on Monday Night
Baseball and a certain brother of
mine said, "He's going to pitch a
no-hitter."
Remarkably, Gooden did just
that. Sort of.
The only "hit" was a slow roller
to Ray Knight that the third base
man threw away. Incredibly, this
error was ruled a hit and Gooden
settled for the one-hitter. In the
seven years since that game, the
Mets, with their vaunted pitching
staff, have been unable to just say
no.
As a matter of fact, in their 30-
year history, New York has never
thrown a no-hitter. Tom Seaver
tossed his gem for Cincinnati. Go
figure.

In the 1980s, there were 14 no
hitters. Roughly average for a
decade of baseball since the
turn of the century.
These days, it seems like some
one is throwing one every other
day. Sometimes, it's the worthy,
like Nolan Ryan. Oftentimes its
the weird, like Tommy Greene.
This past week it was the wonder
ful, Dennis Martinez, and the
"Will it go in the record books?"
Mark Gardner.
What's going on? No one
seems to know for sure. Logic
would dictate that in this era of
mediocre pitchers, the most sub
lime of pitching performances
would be as rare as a hot, sunny
day in San Francisco.
Instead, the Associated Press
sends out what it calls a "no-hit"
advisory more than ever. It goes
like this. "Dennis Martinez has a
perfect game through sue innings.
The Expos lead the Dodgers 2-0."
For most of those, the AP fol
lows up with something along
these lines: "Brian Harper singled
off Nolan Ryan with two outs in
the seventh. The Rangers lead the
-Rvins 1-0."
After last year's eight "no-nos"
— as in no-hit, no-run games —
people expected things would
quiet down this season. Perhaps,
the odds seemed to indicate, it
would be a no no-no year.
But no. The season is not yet
two-thirds gone and five no-hit
ters — or four, depending on who
you believe — are already in the
books. While Johnny Vander
meer's back-to-back no-hitters
remain the one record in baseball
that will absolutely never be bro
ken — tied maybe — the Dodgers
did manage to get no-hit twice in
the same weekend. Sort of.
When Gardner threw nine hit
less innings against Los Angeles
on Friday night, his Expo team
mates failed to do something crit
ical — score a run. He got
touched in the 10th for a single
run and, instead of getting cred
ited with a no-hitter, all he got was
a loss. Sort of.
The Elias Sports Bureau, offi
cial purveyor of statistics for
major-league baseball, says that
Gardner will be placed on a spe
cial list of pitchers who tossed
nine innings of no-hit ball but
didn't win it in regulation. Histor
ically, said hurlers have been
losers.
Like Harvey Haddix, who was
on the mound in history's second
most famous no-hitter. Haddix
spun 12 perfect innings on May
26, 1959, facing the minimum 36
batters along the way. A finer
game had never been pitched,
before or since. If you eliminate
the 13th inning, in which Haddix
lost the game.
The Sporting News, keepers of
baseball records separate from
those of Elias', includes Haddix
on its all-time no-hitter list.
They'll probably list Gardner as
well. Major League Baseball, for
its own part, knows not what a no
no is — there is no rule to refer to.
Martinez doesn't have Gard
ner's problem. He faced just 27
Dodgers, retired each one, and
had the good fortune of a little
run support. T\vo runs worth in
fact, and neither was earned.
Alfredo Griffin made a pair of
errors in the seventh to help Mon
treal out.
Almost unbelievably, the
Dodgers' Mike Morgan was no
hitting the Expos that day as well.
The Expos first base hit came in

the sixth, when Ron Hassey sin
gled. Up to that point, it was five
innings without a batter taking
affirmative action to reach base.
Take that, rotisserie leaguers.
For the 36-year-old Martinez,
the gem was the ultimate cap on
his return from alcohol problems.
In 1987, he was in the minor
leagues, trying to make it back.
Since then, he's gone 66-47 —
with one perfecto.
As a matter of fact, one of only
15 nine-inning perfect games ever
thrown. The one for the ages —
Don Larsen in the 1956 World
Series. Not that great a pitcher,
but certainly one-of baseball's
greatest moments.
The greats that have been per
fect: Sandy Koufax, who domi
nated an era like no other; Catfish
Hunter, a great player who played
for some great teams; and Cy
Young, who recorded 511 wins
and has some award named after
him.
But the Gods of Pitching Per
fection have smiled on several
lesser lights. The "What the hell
are these guys doing with Koufax,
Catfish and Cy?" list — Len
Barker, Cleveland, parlayed the
game into a robbery of the Braves;
Tom Browning, who won 20 as a
rookie but isn't exactly on an
express train to Cooperstown; and
Mike Witt, the American
League's most feared right-han
der — for about two months in
the mid-'Bos.
Finally, there's the Imperfect
Perfect Game. "Hey Elias, this
counts?" — Ernie Shore retired
27 straight Washington Senators
for the Boston Red Sox on June
23, 1917. Only he wasn't the
starter. A big guy named Babe
Ruth was. Ruth put the first guy
on and then was tossed by the
umpire for, shall we say, a few dis
couraging words.
Shore came in, the runner was
caught stealing, and the rest, as
they say, was history.
