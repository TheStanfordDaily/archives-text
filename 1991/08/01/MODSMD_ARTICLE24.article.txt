# Mussina in majors
## But Orioles send Ballard to minors 
### 
The number of former Stan
ford players in the major leagues
increased by one — almost. The
Baltimore Orioles called up Mike
Mussina from their Triple-A affil
iate in Rochester, N.Y., on Tues
day.
At the same time, though, they
sent down struggling Jeff Ballard.
The Orioles have been out of the
race since April and decided to go
with a youth movement. Mussina,
22, fits right in.
After a disappointing finish to
his college career in the 1990 Col
lege World Series, Mussina was a
first-round draft pick of the Ori
oles. This season, he has posted a
10-4 record with a 2.87 ERA for
Rochester in 19 starts.
Ballard, who won 18 games a
couple years back, has struggled
mightily. He was 6-11 and had a
5.34 ERA. Worse still, he allowed
141 hits in 118 innings.
The Orioles have not made
clear their plans for Mussina, but
he is likely to have a spot in the
starting rotation indefinitely.

Mike Mussina's fast track to the majors ended Tuesday when Balti
more called him up to The Show. He's part of the also-ran Orioles
youth movement.
