Keefe in Cuba
There was doubt. There was
opportunity for disappointment.
There was a very real possibility
that coach Gene Keady could
somehow be foolish enough to
leave Adam Keefe when he took
the Pan American Games basket
ball team to Havana.
But none of that matters any
more. Keefe made the club,
despite the presence of four addi
tional big men: Eric Montross of
North Carolina, Christian Laet
tner of Duke, Clarence Weather
spoon of Southern Mississippi and
Mike Peplowski of Michigan
State.
Making the Pan Am team was
one of the reasons Keefe passed
up the NBA draft in June and
chose to remain at Stanford for
his senior season. He will attempt
to help the U.S. team make up for
an embarrassing defeat to Brazil
in the '87 Pan Am Games.
It is not known weather Keefe
will start for the team, or whether
he'll even get much playing time.
But given his ability to play the
up-tempo game, his rebounding
skill and his willingness to take a
pounding down low, it's likely
Keefe will see significant action.
The U.S. team opens play Sat
urday against Cuba. The squad
meets Venezuela on Monday and
Argentina on Tuesday. ABC will
provide weekend coverage from
Havana and Ted Tlirner will han
dle the mid-week action on cable.
Worlds of wonder
So many people, so many to
places. So easy to leave someone
out.
The World University Games
and Olympic Festival are over, but
that doesn't mean everyone with a
Stanford connection has gotten
his due. Here then, is a non
comprehensive list of notables
that haven't made it into The
Weekly yet:
Bev Oden, Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper were starters on the

bronze-medal volleyball team at
the World University Games in
Sheffield, England. Canyon
Ceman was a halftime setter for
the men's silver-medal team.
Goalkeeper Kyle Krpata helped
his team to a silver medal at the
Olympic Festival soccer event in
Los Angeles. David Sacks won a
silver in 68-kilogram Greco-Roman
wrestling at the festival.
• In addition to Keefe, many
present and former Stanford ath
letes will head to Havana: Jeffrey
Hammonds (baseball); Jennifer
Azzi and Sonja Henning (basket
ball); Eileen Richetelli (diving);
Suzy Buckovich, Barb Metz, J.T.
Toton, Dede Trimble and Alex
Kostich (swimming); Rhett Harty
and Randy Mann (soccer); Pam
Dukes, Chryste Gaines and Ceci
St. Geme (track and field); Dan
Hanan, coach Don Shaw, Klein,
Cooper and Oden (volleyball);
Erich Fischer, Craig Klass and
David Imbernino (water polo);
and Ted Huang (yachting).
NCAA news and notes
Those wizards in Shawnee Mis
sion, Kan., at the NCAA are in for
some changes if Rep. Tom
McMillen, D-Md., has his way.
McMillen has proposed legisla
tion that would restructure the
NCAA by handing control over to
a new Board of Presidents. It
would also exempt the organiza
tion from antitrust law, allowing it
to negotiate television deals and
enforce its rules without outside
interference. Finally, postseason
revenue would be distributed
evenly, without regard to winning
and losing.
• The NCAA, meanwhile, is
considering a radical proposal to
allow athletes to enter a profes
sional draft, negotiate with agents
and then return to school. Cur
rently, any contact with profes
sional sports costs athletes their
eligibility. That's become a major
issue in recent years since under
classmen have been allowed to
enter the NFL draft. Dozens of

football players have been left
with no pro contract and no schol
arship after going undrafted.
Tennis takes
The college tennis future of
Debbie Graham is increasingly in
doubt Graham is continuing her
second straight successful summer
on the tour this week at the
Mazda Classic in Carlsbad, Calif.
Graham won a first-round match
Tuesday over Erika deLone of
Lincoln, Mass., 6-0, 6-1. Yesterday
she beat Barbara Paulus of Aus
tria, the tournament's seventh
seed, by a score of 6-3, 6-4.
Last week, Graham reached
the quarterfinals of the $100,000
Westchester Ladies Cup in Pur
chase, N.Y., before falling to Lori
McNeil, 7-5,6-1. She is 94th in the
world on the latest Women's Ten
nis Association computer rank
ings.
• At the California Open in
Aptos, the big story was sopho
more Emma Woodhouse, who
reached the final of the women's
event. Seeded second, she lost to
Maggie Cole of Santa Cruz, 6-1, 3-
6, 6-3. On the men's side,
Jonathan Stark reached the quar
terfinals with a victory over
Brazil's Fernando Roese, the
129th-ranked player in the world,
6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4. Alex O'Brien
was narrowly nosed out of a quar
terfinal berth by Chuck Adams of
Pacific Palisades, Calif., 5-7, 6-4,
6-4.
Odds and ends
• Men's tennis coach Dick
Gould was named to the Northern
California Tennis Hall of Fame.
• California announced plans
to hold a major college basketball
tournament at the Oakland Coli
seum, beginning no later than
1993. That ends hopes for a Bay
Area event featuring Stanford,
Cal, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, USF
and San Jose State. Stanford will,
however, play its road game with
Cal at the Coliseum this year
