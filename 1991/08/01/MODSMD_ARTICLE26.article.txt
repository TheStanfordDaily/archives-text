## Mister Butterfly Stanford grad David Henry Hwang finds success on Broadway 
### Raphael Zeno Beck 
Tout plays are like kids. 'M. But
terfly' is my kid that everybody
A- likes, and 'Rich Relations' is the
kid who always gets sent to reform school."
T\velve years after graduating from Stan
ford, Asian-American playwright David
Henry Hwang is back in the Bay Area to
show off his kids. And there's quite a bit to
show.
"M. Butterfly" is indeed one that every
body likes. After earning Hwang a Tony
Award for Best Drama in 1988, the show
hits San Francisco next week, enjoying what
the author claims is the longest tour ever of
a non-musical production.
Inspired by a true story, "M. Butterfly"
tells the tale of a French diplomat who has
an affair with a Chinese opera singer. After
20 years, the birth of a child and the passing
of many political secrets, the diplomat is
accused of treason. At his trial, it is
revealed to him that the opera singer is a
man.
The remarkable play wrestles with issues
of politics, sexuality and East-West culture
clash, and catapulted Hwang immediately
into a position as the foremost Asian-
American dramatist.
"The success of 'M. Butterfly' is some
what intimidating," says Hwang. "I've dealt
with that over the past few years by concen
trating on a lot of film projects, feeling that
if I have a movie come out and it's a mod
erate success, it's still an interesting step
forward for me."
"Rich Relations" is a kid with a less
glamorous report card. "It just got really
bad reviews," says Hwang humbly of its
recent West Coast premiere. Written
before "M. Butterfly," the show debuted in
New York City in 1986 "where it got really
bad reviews." Some kids never change.
Hwang says that despite its disappoint
ing reception, "it has a real special place for

me. It's a play about resurrection, and it
helped me resurrect the reasons that I
wanted to be a writer.
"When it failed in New York City, that
was my first big flop, and that turned out to
be really liberating. Up until that point, I'd
never really had a big failure. Conse
quently, my dedication to being a writer had
never been tested. I still believe in the play,
and I'm still glad I did it. It was the first
time I realized that I would always be a
writer."
It was at Stanford where Hwang "not
only became interested in theater, but
became interested in Asian-American
issues. Of any institution, Stanford's the
one that contributed the most to my ability
to do what I do today.
"When I came to Stanford, I had no idea
I was going to be a writer. I think that as I
started to write plays, there was always a lit
tle part in the back of my mind that said, 'if
this doesn't work out, I can always go to law
school.'"
As the record shows, law school lost out
on this talented Stanford graduate, and the
decision was the right one for Hwang. "This
is what I do," he says plainly. "This is what
I love to do, and I'm really happy to be
working in the theater, and that's that."
As for the future, Hwang seems to have
enough new kids to fill a nursery. His
prospects include three film projects: a
movie of "M. Butterfly" due out no sooner
than the end of 1992; a film titled "Golden
Gate" which will mark Hwang's debut as a
movie director; and an adaption of Dosto
evsky's "The Idiot," updated and set in
New York City, to be directed by none other
than Martin Scorsese.
In addition, Hwang has just finished a
draft of his first new full-length play since
"M. Butterfly," currently titled "Face
Value." "I haven't shown it to anyone yet,"

confesses the playwright.
"It's a farce of mistaken racial identity,"
says Hwang, who views the new play as "a
way to deal with some of the unresolved
healings that came out of the brouhaha last
summer with 'Miss Saigon.' "
The "brouhaha" was nothing less than
the greatest philosophical battle that ever
raged on Broadway and resulted in the
temporary cancellation of one of the most
expensive theatrical productions ever
waged.
"Miss Saigon's" central character,
described as "Eurasian" in the script, was
to be played by accomplished Caucasian
actor Jonathan Pryce ("Brazil"). Hwang
was a vocal opponent to this casting and
convinced the Actor's Equity Union to
demand that an Asian-American actor be
used in place of Pryce. Although the deci
sion was later retracted, producer Cameron
Mackintosh pulled the show for several
months in protest of Equity's actions.
"I sometimes felt that I had become a
character in 'Bonfire of the Vanities,' " says
Hwang of the experience. "All the short
term goals were completely failed. All we
did was give the show some publicity and
increase the presale [of tickets.]
"But to me, the short-term goals were
never that much the point. I did think it
would be sad if this kind of casting came
about in 1991 and nobody commented on it.
I'd like to feel that a director has the right
to cast whomever he wants, but also that
people who don't like it have the right to
complain as loudly as they want and expect
a reasonable hearing. I think that's the best
way to balance everyone's civil liberties.
"Ultimately, we're all working toward a
day where acting is acting, where Jonathan
Pryce should be able to play anything he
wants, and James Earl Jones should be able
to play an Englishman, and Edward James

Marin Metchkx â€” Weekly
Olmos should be able to play a Jewish per
son or whatever."
But Hwang feels that goal is very far
away. "We're still at a place where 90 per
cent of all productions employ all-white
casts," he notes. "If you look at the statistic
that Caucasians are about to become a
minority in this country, I think that's a
really bad minority hiring record.
"It gets to the point where we're playing
with some sort of artistic apartheid. So at
this point, I'd like to feel that when roles
come along for minority actors that they are
cast with minority actors."
Despite his involvement with "Miss
Saigon," Hwang does not view himself as a
trailblazer for Asian-Americans in the the
ater. "It's not like I do this to open doors for
other people," he admits. "I'm basically an
artist out of selfish reasons; there are things
that I want to do and say and express and
explore, and that's why I do it.
"If one of the side effects is that I hap
pen to create roles for Asian actors and I
happen to open doors for other writers, I
think that's great, but I wouldn't want to
pretend that's my motivation."
Still, Hwang expects an awareness of
ethnicity from everyone. "All of us have the
responsibility to fight exclusion within the
arts we work," he says, "but I don't know if
that applies more to artists than to other
people or applies more to 'ethnic artists.'
"We should all be trying to expand our
boundaries, and that's true if you work in
an engineering plant. It all applies."

"Rich Relations " closes Sunday at the Cowell
Theatre in Fort Mason, SF, 751-2600. "M.
Butterfly" opens Wednesday at the Curran
Theatre in San Francisco and runs through
Sept. 10. Call 762-BASS for ticket informa
