# Dull script dims 'Miami Lights'
## 
### Lisa Lawrence Staff writer 
It promised to be sizzling — a
Latin, dance-filled musical set
underneath the Florida sun.
Unfortunately, the prospect of
steamy Latin rhythms and an
innovative production that entices
one to see Theatre Works' "Miami
Lights" is the most sizzling part of
this disappointing show.
Set in the Florida Keys circa
1938, "Miami Lights" tries to give
a unique slice of Cuban life in
America. The show's heart is in
the right place but it doesn't
deliver on its promise to dazzle
and excite.
The show does deliver strong
acting and singing by a talented
and energetic cast, but the per
formers are faced with too many
obstacles to make the show work.
With seemingly little direction

and a poor story line, added to
dance and music that both need to
be more vibrant, the show leaves
unsettling results.
Adapted from J.M. Synge's
Irish play, "The Playboy of the
Western World," "Miami Lights"
tries to take an Irish rogue and
turn him into a suave, macho
Latino. But the casanova, Cristo,
played by Angelo Pagan, is not
very suave and gets by more on
muscle than wit.
Pagan, though, is a talented
performer, and his powerful "Gui
tar/Moon" duet with Margarita,
played feistily by Illana Zauderer,
is one of the few beautifully writ
ten songs in the play. Pagan and
Zauderer both have incredible
voices that harmonize well.
Margarita is sexy, headstrong
and independent throughout the
play. Zauderer, a Stanford junior,
was last seen as the Witch in the

Ram's Head Theatrical Society
production of "Into the Woods."
In "Miami Lights," she rein
forces her reputation as a per
former who can really grab the
audience's attention.
Unfortunately, Jacque Levy's
lyrics for those songs contradict
much of the plot. Margarita sings
of her desire for "A Simple Honest
Man," and yet after learning of
Cristo's deceptions, her desire to
be with him seems unrealistic.
Their relationship throughout the
play seems to be one of purely
physical attraction.
Other parts of "Miami Lights"
continue in similar fashion. It
seems as if author Levy wanted a
happy, no-loose-ends finale,
despite the fact the body of the
production in no way points to the
show's conclusion.
"Miami Lights" does hold your
attention for a while. Theatre-

Works deserves respect for their
casting of talented actors and
their use of innovative material.
Unfortunately, it isn't often during
"Miami Lights" that this talent

and innovation is revealed

Theatre Works' "Miami Lights"runs
through Aug. 10 at the Mountain
View Center for the Performing Arts.
