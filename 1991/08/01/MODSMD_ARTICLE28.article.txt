# Jazz greats melt Frost
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
If the Stanford Jazz Workshop
Concert Series were the only
music event this week, it would
still be a hot week for jazz at Stan
ford. But The Gathering 11, Sun
day's blockbuster afternoon of
jazz at Frost Amphitheater, defi
nitely makes this a week for jazz
fans to remember.
The Gathering II will feature a
remarkable assembly of some of
the hottest names on the main
stream jazz scene: Bobby Cald
well, Larry Carlton, Stanley Jor
dan, Hugh Masekela and the Rip
pingtons with Russ Freeman.
Caldwell, nominated for 24
awards in 1979 by Cashbox and
Billboard for his self-titled debut
album, spent several years as a
guitarist for rock legend Little
Richard before embarking on a
solo career. Caldwell has since
moved to Los Angeles and gotten
more involved with songwriting,
working up tunes for such artists
as A 1 Jarreau, the Commodores,
Brenda Russell and others.
Carlton, a two-time Grammy
Award winner, has played on
countless studio sessions, includ
ing more than 100 gold albums.
One of the most widely respected
and sought-after jazz guitarists
around, he has worked with the
group Steely Dan and jazz vocal
sensation Jarreau, in addition to
producing his own albums, includ
ing "Sleepwalk," "Strikes I\vice,"
"On Solid Ground" and "Discov
ery."
Innovative New York guitarist
Jordan, a Grammy-award nomi
nee, will also be featured Sunday.
His technique of playing his guitar
with both hands on the finger
board, keyboard style, is distinc

tive and revolutionary.
Masekela, a South African
trumpet player of international
renown, will present his brand of
music for the '90s: a socially con
scious blend of the township jazz
he heard as a child in Whitbank,
South Africa, with the rhythm
and-blues ballads and Motown
sounds he loved as a student dur
ing the '60s at the Manhattan
School of Music.
Masekela was co-writer and
composer of the musical score for
the Broadway hit "Sarafina," a
performer on Paul Simon's Grace
land tour, and has his own band,
Kalahari, which features four
Graceland tour alumni.
The Rippingtons, with guitarist
Russ Freeman, are a Los Angeles
based band. Freeman founded the
group in 1986, when he and a
group of fellow studio musicians
got together and recorded an
album of their own; hence the
name of that first Rippingtons
release, Moonlighting.
That album featured popular
saxophonist Kenny G., while later
releases featured the jazz saxo
phone wizardry of Brandon
Fields. Jeff Kashiwa currently
blows the saxes for the group,
which now has four albums to its
credit and will soon release a fifth.
The Gathering II will be hosted
by actor/comedian Franklyn
Ajaye, Emmy award nominee for
his writing during the first season
of the Fox hit, "In Living Color."
With Ajaye as master of cere
monies, there shouldn't be a dull
moment between performances.

The Gathering II takes place Sun
day at Frost Amphitheater from I
p.m. to dusk. Call 762-BASS or
723-4317f0r ticket information.
