# Sax legend Henderson blows magic sounds
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Joe Henderson has done it all. With more
than 20 albums as a band leader — and count
less others as a sideman to his credit, he has
played bebop, rhythm and blues, soul, rock,
Latin jazz and — believe it or not — polkas.
This tenor-saxophone legend can blow
improvised solos with a razor-sharp tone,
filled with quick bursts of notes, shakes and
double-time figures. But he can also lay down
a sweet, warm ballad with sensitivity and musi
cality, the way only players with years of expe
rience and a rare musical gift can.
Appearing Saturday at Stanford, Hender
son will contribute to the Stanford Jazz Work

shop for the fifth consecutive year. He has par
ticipated in the past by giving concerts big and
small, teaching master classes and serving as a
member of the workshop faculty.
Saturday's performance will be a rare
opportunity to hear Henderson in an intimate,
acoustic setting. The concert will showcase
Henderson's virtuosity, as he will perform in
the challenging trio format, with bassist Larry
Grenadier and drummer Adam Nussbaum.
Henderson enjoys playing in the trio for
mat, the difficulty of which defeats many play
ers. It allows him to display his highly devel
oped harmonic sense and his rhythmic skill.
The trio format also allows each of the players
to speak on his own, in addition to demanding
that they communicate on a high musical level

and work together in order to produce a com
plete group sound.
Although many try to characterize Hender
son's musical style, saying that his playing was
influenced by saxophonists Sonny Rollins and
John Coltrane, Henderson has developed a
unique style and has influenced an entire gen
eration of saxophone players. His playing goes
far beyond the combining of other players'
styles into the realm of invention.
Stanford Jazz Workshop co-founder Jim
Nadel said it was modest to call Henderson
"one of the greatest saxophone players alive."
