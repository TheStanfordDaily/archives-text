They're all wrong
"Life Stinks," starring Mel Brooks,
Leslie Ann Warren and Jeffrey
Tambor
Either:
a) I had a lobotomy and no one
told me;
b) Aliens took over the minds
of all movie reviewers in the
United States and happened to
miss me; or
c) I saw the wrong movie by
mistake.
These are the only possible
reasons, as far as I am concerned.
Everybody — and I do mean
everybody — loved Mel Brooks'
new film, "Life Stinks."
Except me. I hated it.
The San Jose Mercury News
gave it three stars; the San Fran
cisco Chronicle gave it a clapping
man. I haven't checked the Los
Angeles Times yet, but they prob
ably gave it their equivalent of
"She's nuts; see this marvelously
funny and poignant film."
And I just don't get it.
"Life Stinks" is the story of
Goddard Bolt (Brooks), one of
the richest — if not the richest —
man in the world. Bolt wants to
buy a section of a downtown Los
Angeles slum in order to destroy it
and turn it into Bolt City. How
ever, his competition, played by
Jeffrey Tambor, also wants the
land.
Consequently, the two make a
deal: If Bolt can survive in the
slum for 30 days with no money,
credit cards or identity, he gets the
land. If not, he loses.
The movie, while trying to
make the point that money isn't
everything and love and friend
ship are more important, etc., etc.,
was not serious enough to be a
good drama, but not funny
enough to be a Brooks movie.
Actually, it was not funny at all.
It was downright stupid.
Or so I thought. Everyone else,
however, seems to think differ
ently.
The Chronicle reviewer wrote,
"['Life Stinks''] plea for economic
equality is well taken. And
Brooks, after years of lousy
movies, finally seems back on sure
footing."
Sure footing? "Life Stinks" is
one of the worst movies I've ever
seen. What's even more pathetic
is that it was written by the same
man who gave us "Young
Frankenstein" and "History of the
World Part I," two of the funniest
movies ever.
