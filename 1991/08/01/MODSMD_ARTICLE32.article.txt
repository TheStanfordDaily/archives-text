The abridged 'V.l.'
"V.I. Warshawski," starring Kath
leen Turner, Jay O. Sanders and
Angela Goethals
1 haven't read the Sara Paret
sky detective novels that inspired
the new Kathleen TUrner film,
"VI. Warshawski," but I think I
might pick one up after seeing the
film.
But not because I loved the
film so much that I now have to
see where it came from. Rather, I
want to get to know the title char
acter who seemed so intriguing in
the previews but never made it
into the film.
Turner's V.1., or Vic, as her
friends call her, is a sloppy
attempt to create the kind of
"sturdy" female character that
seems to be the current rage in
films. The idea seems to be that
she succeeds in a man's world by
combining leggy sexuality, intelli
gence in the face of male stupidity,
staunch independence and, most
importantly, the ability to take a
punch.
Unfortunately, all these ideas

seem to contradict each other.
Her resistance to "male" methods
of investigation — namely carry
ing a gun — goes right out the
window after neither her sexuality,
her wit nor her akido skills can
save her from being beaten sense
less by mafia thugs.
Vic's strong character, which
should have been the fun part of
this film, only flashes through in
tiny spurts. Director Jeff Kanew,
whose biggest previous credit is
"Revenge of the Nerds," proves
himself inept at teasing out the
finer points of Vic's personality.
Her independence is also seri
ously undermined by the plot,
which has the detective agreeing
to investigate the murder of a man
she met hours before his death.
Her reasons for taking on this
dangerous case for essentially no
pay seem to revolve around her
latent maternal feelings for the
dead man's daughter, played with
typical wise-beyond-her-years
smart-ass furor by Angela
Goethals.
It's a shame that a wonderful
actress like TUrner couldn't get a
better-defined character out of
this script, considering the charac
ter has such possibilities. In the
hands of say, "Thelma and
Louise's" Ridley Scott, "VI. War

shawski" might have been a simi
lar tribute to the independent
woman. Here's hoping the real
V.I. dwells within the pages of
Paretsky's novels.

The magic's gone
"Another You," starring Richard
Pryor and Gene Wilder
In their 15 years working
together, Richard Pryor and Gene
Wilder have made a couple of
great films.
"Another You" isn't one of
them.
Not that these two veteran
comic actors don't give the
impressive performances audi
ences have come to expect from
them. Quite the contrary.
Wilder is on the mark as
George, a psychiatric outpatient
who has barely overcome his bout
with compulsive lying, and Pryor
is as crude as ever playing Eddie,
a criminal who will do anything
for money. Regrettably, a finer
vehicle was not made to accom
modate them.
The setup is that Eddie is
assigned to supervise George as
his parole community service pro
ject. While he fully intends to
ditch George as soon as possible,
his plans change when George is
mistaken for a wealthy man who
has been missing for several
months.
Under Eddie's money-making
plan, years of therapy go out the
window and George thrives on the
chance to assume the rich man's
persona, not to mention his home
and wife. But the two men do not
realize they are part of a larger
scam that has put them both in
great danger.
For a brief moment, the script
is complex, intriguing and even
gives a suggestion of Hitchcock's
"North by Northwest," but it pro
ceeds to go nowhere slowly for the
rest of the film.
The fault seems to lie with
writer Ziggy Steinberg, who, not
surprisingly, is far more successful
as a television writer than he has
ever been as a filmmaker.
"Another You's" most memorable

scene is when the missing man's
supposed wife joins George in a
ridiculous yodeling courtship song
that falls somewhere between
funny and dumb.
In addition, Mercedes Ruehl
and the rest of the supporting cast
do a better job at being bad actors
than they do at playing them as
part of the scam. Former Miss
America Vanessa Williams gives
the kind of performance that
could embarrass even Penthouse
magazine. -
The coup de grace here is that

the climactic scene takes place in
a beer factory where, wouldn't
you know it, somebody ends up in
a big vat of foam. To my knowl
edge, no film that ends in a beer
factory has ever won an Academy
Award. There may be a connec
tion.
If you would like to see the
wonderful chemistry between
Pryor and Wilder at work, then
rent "Stir Crazy" or "Silver
Streak." Don't waste your time or
money on "Another You."
