Ice cream delights
• Ghirardelli Fountain and Candy — Some
people might think it strange to drive all
the way to San Francisco just for ice cream,
and well, it is. But it's worth it, especially if
you get hot fudge.
• The Fountain Restaurant — In the lavish
San Jose Fairmont Hotel, the Fountain's
old-fashioned ice crcam parlor serves sun
daes that are not to be believed. Working

with what seems to be more than 100 fla
vors — and just as many toppings — the
striped-shirted workers at the Fountain
dish out far more than you could ever eat.
• Double Rainbow — Though it may seem
common, Double Rainbow has a wide vari
ety of ice cream and cakes that are sure to
please.
New film releases:
Opening Friday
• "Doc Hollywood" — Michael J. Fox, snot
nosed plastic surgeon
• "Return to the Blue Lagoon" — Same
story, different kids
• "Body Parts" — No relation to the Mil
waukee case

• "The Doctor" — William Hurt as patient
of a lesser doctor
New in music:
Courtesy Compact Disc World, Palo Alto
• Psychedelic Furs — "World Outside"
• Color Me Bad — "Color Me Bad"
• Mudhoney — "Every Good Boy Deserves
Fudge"
• Wynlon Marsalis — Three-disk anthology
New in videos:

This week's releases:
• "Teenage Mutant Ninja TUrtles 2: The
Secret of the Ooze," starring Donatello,
Leonardo, Michaelangelo and Raphael

TV this week:
'Tis a most abysmal week in television.
The highlight of the week seems to be —
believe it or not — football, with one game
on each of the three major networks.
Luckily, ABC follows the Monday night
Bills-Giants matchup with the delightful
comedy "All of Me," starring Lily Tomlin
and Steve Martin (with the Oscar).
Summer is also the perfect time to get
acquainted with some great series you may
have missed during the regular season. For
example, Wednesday's "Anything But
Love" rerun on ABC features clever paro
dies of "Twin Peaks," "A Streetcar Named
Desire," "The Front Page" and more. Look
for some witty sexual repartee as well.
