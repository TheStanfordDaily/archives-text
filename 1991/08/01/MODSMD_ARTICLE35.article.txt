For the eighth time since 1950, Elizabeth Tay
lor will be getting married. This time she plans to
wed Larry Fortensky, a 39-year-old construction
worker, on Oct. 5. The happy couple met while
both were undergoing treatment for drug abuse at
the Betty Ford Clinic and Singles Resort.
In honor of Elizabeth Taylor-Hilton-Wilding-
Todd-Fisher-Burton-Burton-Warner-Fortensky,
Second-Choice Videos suggests you rent one or
more of these matrimonial movies when "Sleeping
with the Enemy" — itself an ode to wedded bliss
— is all checked out.
• "The Princess Bride" — Always a good second
choice video (and often a first-choice one at that),
Rob Reiner's fairy tale parody features perhaps

the greatest wedding scene of all time: "Mawiage
... wove, twue wove ..etc., etc.
• "Peggy Sue Got Married" — Even if Kathleen
Turner's new movie, "V.I. Warshawski," is bomb
ing at the box office, you can still enjoy classic
Turner in this "Back to the Future"-esque movie
that asks the question, "What if you never married
the bum you're married to now?"
• "Betsy's Wedding" — Alan Alda is the nervous
dad and Molly Ringwald is the reluctant bride in
this overlooked comedy from last summer.
• "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" — Envious
of their older brother's marriage, six brothers kid
nap six women to be their brides. Countless
dances later, the women are won over; in this not
exactly enlightened musical tale from 1954.
• "Bride of Frankenstein" — Hey, if the big ugly
dude can find true love — granted, it's custom
built for him — then there's hope for everyone.
• "Father of the Bride" — Ironically enough, this
one stars Elizabeth Taylor as a young bride, a role
she was obviously born to play. Spencer Tracy is
the bumbling, worn-out dad in the title.
