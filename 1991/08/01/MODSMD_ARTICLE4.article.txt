## Column Trouble in the garden of medicine 
### 
I am a weed.
I am a free-flying weed,
blowing in the wind. A ram
bling piece of shrubbery detached
from the roots which once held
me in bondage. Aimless. Shiftless.
Carefree.
T\vo years ago, I was a virile
seedling planted in Stanford's fer
tile soil, ready to burst out and
become a mighty oak tree of sci
ence and medicine. A veritable
giant sequoia of knowledge,
geared toward the betterment of
the human condition through
technical means.
In this frenzy of selfish altru
ism, I set my roots down among all
the other baby plantlife in the
nursery and anxiously awaited the
first round of gardening treat
ment. But I was young and naive.
I never expected that these would
be times that would separate the
flowers from the mulch.
This era of studying stupefac
tion and joyless cramming is what
I call "the premedical years." The
following is a description of my
own experiences during this
period, but it is just one example
of stories told by countless other
weeds in colleges and universities
all over the country, indeed, all
over the world. While no two
weeds are exactly the same, this
example demonstrates the prob
lems and frustrations common
among all of us.
We begin with innocent ideal
ism and progress onward:
Fall quarter freshman year, the
Jolt-O-Rama: Yes! I made it to
Stanford and have received my
calling in life! I really, really, really
wanna be a doctor! Classes will be
awesome! Life will be a blast! I
will do really well and still have a
great social life! And why not? I
love chemistry and biology! I love
to learn! I love college! I love
everything! I can't wait to begin.
Let me at it! Let me at it!
Winter quarter freshman year,
the Mellowing: Being but a
sapling in this premedical garden,
I have many years of hard work
ahead of me. I, however, feel
myself certainly up to the task at
hand. True, Chemistry 31 was
tough, but I am confident in my
abilities. I will prosper and fulfill
all of my expectations. Remem
ber, when the going gets tough,
the tough get going.
Spring quarter freshman year,
the Shockaroo: Whoa! What the
hell was that?! What was that all
about? Did I miss something? Did
I have fun? This organic chemistry
stuff sure is hard! Well, maybe if I
take it again I will be more clued
in. Yeah! Yeah! That was just an
aberration! I really do love this
stuff, don't I?
Summer after freshman year,
the Renewal of Determination:
Now listen to your superego, are
you going to tell me you're going
to let one bad class spoil your
entire future career? You've got to
be kidding yourself! Get back in
there and strike hard! You've got
what it takes and you know it!
Quit feeling sorry for yourself and
take that biology core in Septem
ber! You'll be a star! Go! Go! Go!
Fall quarter sophomore year,
the Struggle: OK! Here I am! This
is the moment of truth! Thou shalt
not falter! I did great in biology in
high school! Hell, I loved it! I will
plug and chug and chug and plug
until I burn all this stuff into my
brain! It will be a grind, but I'm
interested in all this stuff burned
into my brain! It will be a grind,
but I'm gonna do it, by golly!
Genetics, phospholipids, sugar

metabolism... this is great stuff!
My professors are awesome, and I
have nothing to worry about! God
is on my side! Oh, by the way I am
kind of liking this economics class
I'm taking too.
Winter quarter sophomore
year, the Crash: Oh my God! I
don't believe it! I'm gonna turn
into a weed! I am not blossoming
into the beautiful flower I have
aspired to be! I don't like this
@% A #s% anymore! I don't want
to do this @#$% A anymore!
Arraguugh! The world is coming
to an end! My life has no meaning
now! Boy, that class sucked!
Spring quarter sophomore
year, the Last Gasp: All right!
This is your conscience speaking!
Forget about this hmmm stuff.
Get back into it while there is still
time! Come on! I believe more
chemistry is the order of the day.
You can make a glorious come
back and everything will turn out
as you had originally planned...
well, maybe not. Gosh, I enjoyed
that psychology course.
Summer after sophomore year,
the Release: (Deep sigh) The self
torture is finally over. I am confi
dent in my decision to abandon
this road to nowhere. There are
other things in life. I shall enjoy
my college existence! Hey, maybe
I can write for a newspaper! Yeah,
how about that! That's something
I've always wanted to do! Maybe I
can even write a snotty, little col
umn about the turbulent experi
ences of my premedical career!
Wow, what a wonderful idea!
Herein lies the testimony of a
weed. A bitter struggle, but in the
end you can say "Dude! Thanks
but no thanks! 1 am my own
(wo)man! I can be whatever I
want to be (given enough time)
and it just so happens that I
choose not to be a doctor. Word!"
Going premedical is right for
some people and not so right for
others. To tell you the truth, it
really sucks for others. It is all a
question of finding out what you
truly like and what you truly want
to pursue. It is a waste of time to
chase down a faraway, elusive
dream without allowing yourself
to have fun in the process. To live
life on fast-forward while you are
agonizing in the present is majorly
uncool. Personal suffering will not
impress anyone. Believe me, from
first-hand experience, most peo
ple don't go for the martyr type.
So if in the great flower garden
of premedical, you find yourself
not developing into the beautiful
daffodil or honeysuckle rose you
had hoped to become — perhaps
you feel a little withered and
worse for the wear — don't stress.
You are still a viable form of
botanical life. Stand up and
announce to world, "I am a weed
and proud of it, man!"
