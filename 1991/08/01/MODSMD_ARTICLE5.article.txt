## Kennedy has been an able, courageous leader 
### 
Donald Kennedy will be missed.
The able and affable administrator has
presided over an impressive decade in Stan
ford's history: one in which the University grew to
international prestige and was the center of some of
higher education's most vigorous debates.
Enthusiastic and open-minded, Kennedy provid
ed the kind of leadership that enabled the Universi
ty to establish itself as a leader in the development of
a culturally diverse student body, in the facilitation
of public service by students and in confronting the
disparity between teaching and research.
With the ability to charm donors through his
vision of the University's role and his faith in Stan
ford's mission, Kennedy increased the University's
facilities and financial stability, doubling the value of
its physical plant and raising $1.1 billion for the Uni
versity's Centennial.
He commanded the esteem of his fellow educa
tors and the affection of the student body.
Then came the indirect-cost controversy.
Kennedy defended the University's cost-recovery
practices with well-reasoned arguments about cost
accounting rules and the University's accounting
practices.

But Kennedy was caught in a new and unsympa
thetic arena: one in which appearances matter more
than details; in which a few well-timed Washington
leaks count more than solid arguments about
accounting philosophy; one in which something as
luxurious-sounding as a yacht can cost millions of
dollars per foot.
It is an arena in which Kennedy was understand
ably uncomfortable; it provided the only significant
blemish on an otherwise glorious career.
Kennedy has been gracious throughout the
ordeal. Acknowledging that "victory has many par
ents: defeat is an orphan," Kennedy has shouldered
the responsibility of accounting for federal research
funds.
History will likely give a positive and generous
view of Kennedy's presidency. But for the time
being, the announcement of Kennedy's resignation is
framed by the one controversy that has proven too
much for him.
For one who has devoted so much of his life to
solving the University's problems, it is courageous of
Kennedy to realize that the University may have
problems which are beyond his capacity to fix.
