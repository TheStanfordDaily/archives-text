Historical houses
will be destroyed
Within a month, two of Stan
ford's oldest, most historic houses
may be nothing more than a pile
of rubble and memories. Synergy
and the Delta Tau Delta house,
which stand together on San Juan
Hill, are slated to be demolished
in August and replaced with fac
ulty housing.
Synergy and the Delt house are
located on San Juan Hill, which,
according to the Stanford Histori
cal Society, is "the only neighbor
hood of the early Stanford campus
still intact."
We are writing to issue a final
plea for a halt to the demolition
plans. We do not disagree that the
administration's plan to replace
the residences with faculty hous
ing addresses two important
needs of the University — addi
tional income and faculty housing
— at a time of serious financial
difficulty.
However, we do not believe the
administration has given complete
consideration to either the conse
quences of its actions or the possi
ble alternatives.

The administration has
claimed that these houses are not
of sufficient historical or architec
tural merit to justify the expense
of preservation.
Yet, while additional evidence
has been presented to supplement
the incomplete Historical Values
Index survey done after the Earth
quake of 1989, the response of the
administration has not been to
embrace or supplement this
research but to contest it.
An application for point of his
torical interest status for the
houses is currently pending before
the California Historical Re
sources Commission.
Rather than use the historical
pedigree of the houses to help
raise funds for there repair, the
Stanford administration has cho
sen to lobby the county and the
state to oppose the historic desig
nation of the houses and is rush
ing to tear them down as quickly
as possible.
Members of the Committee to
Save the Hill Houses and other
unsolicited alumni have offered
either to contribute directly or to
assist in raising funds for the
reconstruction of the houses.
While the administration claims
that money for this reconstruction
is not available, it has not

attempted to follow up on these
offers.
The administration has also
claimed that only by converting
the land in question to faculty
housing can it afford to build
additional student housing.
Furthermore, it has been
claimed that building faculty
housing on these sites will help
alleviate the general shortage of
affordable housing. Early plans
for the sites include building
medium-density housing, possibly
providing as many as 40 units or
more.
Yet the surrounding area is
zoned for low-density housing
only. We question whether this
many units could indeed be built
without violating either the exist
ing zoning or the character of the
neighborhood.
In a bulletin published in early
1990 detailing Stanford's earth
quake recovery project, University
President Donald Kennedy is
quoted as saying, "We don't have
enough history to let any of it get
away." Now we are within weeks
of losing a part of that history for
ever. We urge the administration
to reconsider the demolition
before it is too late.
