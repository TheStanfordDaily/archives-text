# Stopping junk mail: a fast and easy way to save trees
## 
### 
Each year the average Amer
ican gets 248 pieces of junk
mail, most of which never
gets opened. Of the 4 million tons
(that's 8 billion pounds) of junk
mail that gets sent annually, most
ends up in landfills.
The fact that companies are
spending the money to send 4 mil
lion tons of junk mail to us is
obscene. The cost for this must be
astronomical.
The fact that some company
wants to spend its money to send
me mail doesn't really bother me.
What does bother me is that

somewhere, someone is cutting
down a tree to make an envelope
to put my future junk mail in.
Worse yet, when it gets to me, or
you, it is going to be thrown away
into an already overflowing land
fill.
If you feel as I do, you can
breath a sigh of releaf (pun
intended) â€” there is something
you can do about it.
I know that its fun to get mail,
even if it is junk mail, but think of
the greater good and take the first
step towards eliminating it. When
you get junk mail, send back the

"Business Reply" card with some
thing like, "Please take me off
your mailing list" written on it.
Personally, I love doing this
because the company has to pay
for it.
You can also write to a service
called Direct Marketing Associa

tion, Attn. Mail Preference Ser
vice, 6 E. 43 St., New York, NY
10017. This service will put out the
word that you want to be taken off
of stupid mailing lists.
Stopping junk mail before it
gets to you is the best way to deal
with the problem, but unfortu
nately, you will never be able to
stop all junk mail. So, to help curb
the landfill problem, recycle what
you get.
At Stanford, recycling junk
mail is amazingly easy.
In front of the post office, there
are several barrels especially for

junk mail. Please use them. It is
incredible how many people toss
their junk mail into the garbage
cans that are sitting right next to
the recycling barrels.
Not only does recycling keep
your mail out of landfills, it also
means that your lowly junk mail
can be turned into something else,
sparing a tree's life.

human biology and would like to
remind people to go out of their way
to buy products made from recycled
material.
