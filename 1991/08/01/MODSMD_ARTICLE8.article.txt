# Kennedy conies down to Earth
## 
### June Cohen 
It may be getting easier for University
President Donald Kennedy to be
green.
In his resignation letter to the Board of
Trustees, Kennedy announced his intention
to "help make Stanford the university for
academic and policy studies in [the environ
mental] arena."
And environmentalists couldn't be more
thrilled.
"It may well be that Stanford's loss is the
Earth's gain," said alumnus Denis Hayes,
who founded the original Earth Day in 1970.
Hayes stressed the need to increase at
least basic environmental awareness
through education and said he was enthusi
astic about the statement from Kennedy, for
whom he has an enormous amount of
respect.
"We would be hard-pressed to recruit
someone of his quality if we had an open
mandate to do so," said Biology Prof.
Jonathan Roughgarden. "He is one of the
most talented and innovative administrators
and scientists I've ever encountered."
A Harvard graduate and Stanford faculty
member since 1960, Kennedy chaired the
Biology Department from 1965-72 and
headed the Human Biology Program in the
early '70s.
Kennedy has mentioned the possibility of
establishing an environmental policy insti
tute here and teaching biology or environ
mental policy courses. And although he has
not made any commitments to specific pro
grams, he will soon find his services under
great demand within the environmental
community.
"I don't want to be Pollyanna," said Prof.
Gary Ernst, dean of the School of Applied
Earth Sciences. "But I'm really delighted
that he'll be a prime mover for environmen
tal studies at Stanford."
While Ernst said he "was wounded by
[Kennedy's] resignation,"he is unabashedly
enthusiastic about the prospect of working
with him to strengthen Stanford's environ
mental program.
"I think he was a visionary and academic
leader and he would be an extremely pivotal
member of our group," said Ernst.
For several years now, Ernst and a hand
ful of other University faculty members and
students have been designing an interdisci
plinary environmental program, called Earth
Systems, which will be launched from the
School of Applied Earth Sciences this fall.
The program, which combines natural
and hard sciences with economics, recog
nizes the interdisciplinary nature of environ
mental issues and is designed to grant stu
dents a broader understanding of environ
mental problems and their global conse
quences.
While Earth Systems has yet to be
approved by the Faculty Senate as a degree
granting program, the coordinators of the
new major expect to receive that approval by
the end of fall quarter.
The program's deficiency, however, lies
in the area of social sciences — the policy
aspect of global environmental issues. And
according to Ernst, it is crucial to address
the political side of environmental issues.
It is within the public policy arena that
Kennedy feels he could contribute most to
an environmental studies program. A for

mer commissioner of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration and current board
member for the World Research Institute,
Kennedy has more than a few years experi
ence in this field under his belt.
"I'm too far away from biology right now,
after 13 years away from a lab, to requalify
myself as any kind of expert," Kennedy said.
"But I do have a lot of requisitive basic
knowledge and lots of interest and a history
of some involvement on the policy side," he
added.
"It is relatively easy to study and perhaps
understand the global effects of environ
mental problems, but it is more difficult to
figure out how to take effective action,"
Ernst said, adding that Kennedy would be a
great asset to this aspect of the program,
since he is "adroit at dealing with policy
issues."
"He can speak the language of social sci
cnces and natural sciences. No one can
speak them better," said Roughgarden.
"I've known Don for years, and he's always
been one of — if not the — best lecturers in
the Biology Department.
"It's hard to say whether Kennedy was
better serving academia as an administrator
or a teacher," Roughgarden said.
Roughgarden pointed out that Kennedy
was instrumental in obtaining funds for
course teaching assistants in the Earth
Systems core and that he could provide
invaluable guidance in the program's orga
nization and administration.
"If Kennedy came and joined this effort
he would quickly assume a leadership role
and could be active in getting it started,"
Roughgarden said.
But Kennedy, while fully supporting the
Earth Systems program, is not out to steal
the show from anyone.
"Gary Ernst has already asked me to

teach in that core, at least briefly. And if I
can learn fast enough 1 will," Kennedy said.
"I want to be a part of that to the extent that
they can use me. All I'm doing at this point
is offering myself. I'm not trying to take
charge of anything."
Ernst, however, is enthusiastic about any
role that Kennedy chooses to play within the
program. "I already asked him to lecture
winter quarter," Ernst said. "He was an inte
gral part of my plans for the Earth Systems
program, but I didn't realize how integral he
could be."
Ernst said that in recent years, people
have become more aware of the intercon
nected natures of the earth and its ecosys
tems, and this concern is timely. If popula
tion and consumption rates continue at cur
rent rates, "the impact on the environment
will be enormous unless we deal with it in an
effective way."
And Ernst is enthusiastic to begin the
new program for addressing these problems.

"It's so exciting I can hardly wait for fall to
begin," he said.
Ernst believes that once the program is
established, it will quickly grow in size and
quality. "The trick is to build up expertise ..
. If you can provide resources you can attract
faculty and students."
Ernst pointed out that many local organi
zations are involved in environmental issues,
including the NASA Ames Laboratory at
Moffett Field. "We can be the focus for that.
We could be the magnet for others," said
Ernst. "We have the resources, we just need
to link it all together."
"I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to
put together an attractive program,"
Roughgarden said, adding that the size of
the program will "depend on what kind of
fundraising we get."
Ernst plans to direct fundraising efforts
to the outside world — to appeal to individ
uals and private corporations, "which are
just beginning to recognize environmental
problems and see the need for global solu
tions."
The program has enough money for its
first year, according to Ernst, but "down
stream, we'll need to secure outside fund
ing."
"We are prepared to lead the country
with what we have," said Roughgarden.
"But there's a limit to what 10 people can
do."
It is difficult, he continued, for faculty
members who are busy with teaching and
research to find the time to pull together a
large program.
The lack of credibility in some interdisci
plinary programs present another barrier to
faculty involvement in environmental stud
ies, according to Hayes.
Hayes pointed to Stanford's Human
Biology Program as an example of such a sit
uation. Because professors and graduate
students cannot easily obtain credit in their
own departments for teaching human biolo
gy classes, participation in the program is
discouraged.
Hayes said that other schools, such as
UC-Bcrkcley and UCLA have more estab
lished and accredited interdisciplinary envi
ronmental programs.
As another example of a university's
commitment to environmental principles,
