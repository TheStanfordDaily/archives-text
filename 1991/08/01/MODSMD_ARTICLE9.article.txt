## Kennedy's resignation brings regret, admiration to Stanford 
### Steve McCarroll 
For Brown University President Vartan
Gregorian, Donald Kennedy has been "a
fearless spokesman for higher education."
For Dean of Students Michael Jackson,
he has been"the inspirational leader
whose leadership provided the context for
great change to take place."
But for 11 classes of Stanford students,
Kennedy has been the accessible president
who visited them in their residences,
answered their questions and could be
seen jogging in the Foothills and riding his
bike to work.
When the 59-year-old president on
Monday announced plans to resign next
year, many students, administrators and
national education leaders praised the
career of the man who has been Stanford's
president for the last 11 years.
An inspirational leader
University officials, expressing regret
about the president's departure, conceded
that circumstances had made Kennedy's
resignation all but inevitable.
However, they characterized Kennedy's
decision to resign from the presidency as
courageous, saying he was acting on his
devotion to the University.
"The leader's natural reaction to prob
lems is to try to solve them," said James
Gibbons, dean of the School of
Engineering. "That's why I think it was
especially thoughtful of the president to
realize, as he put it, that it is difficult for
one who has been identified with the prob
lem to be the spokesman for its solution."
"I think he's expressing the leadership
that we've come to expect," said Provost
James Rosse. "The decision was clearly
and carefully made ... based on his assess
ment of what was best for the University.
That takes a great deal of leadership and

statesmanship."
Dean of Research Robert Byer praised
the form of Kennedy's resignation."It was
done in style, and in a way that will allow
Stanford to think about its future without
worrying about its past."
"It is impossible to overestimate Don's
devotion to the University," agreed
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch.
Jackson said Kennedy's resignation will
"change the debate over what Stanford is
doing right now."
"He's been an inspirational leader for a
lot of people on campus," Jackson said of
Kennedy's tenure. Jackson cited
Kennedy's contributions in helping diversi
fy the student body. "He articulated the
vision that allows people of color, women,
lesbian, gay and bisexual students (and)
students with disability all to feel comfort
able."
Kennedy, according to Jackson, has pro
vided the kind of intellectual leadership
that facilitates progressive change. "He
helped create an environment" where such
changes as curricular reform could take
place, said Jackson.
Jackson added that he hopes Stanford's
next president "is a kindred spirit in these
areas."
A fearless spokesperson
Education leaders across the country
praised Kennedy's accomplishments.
Princeton University President Harold
Shapiro called Kennedy's tenure "a period
of enormous accomplishment."
"Probably no university in the United
States has made as broad a level of contri
bution" as Stanford under Kennedy's
tenure, Shapiro said. "I have a tremen
dously high opinion of what has been
accomplished at Stanford in this decade."

"In scholarship, Stanford has made
accomplishments in just about every area,"
Shapiro said, citing advances in the medi
cal sciences, engineering and Stanford's
innovative program in human biology,
which Kennedy helped create. "I also think
the student body at Stanford during this
period has continued to improve."
Gregorian said Kennedy "opened up
Stanford to both international and nation
al diversity."
"President Kennedy is a great national
leader, a man of integrity, a man of vision,
a man of honesty. He was a fearless
spokesman on behalf of higher education,"
Gregorian said.
Kennedy is "one of a handful of people
willing to speak out on even the most con
troversial issues," he added.
For example, Kennedy once appeared
on the MacNeil-Lehrer Report to debate
then-Education Secretary William Bennett
on the curriculum reform that was taking
place at Stanford and at other schools.
Gregorian said Kennedy has lifted
Stanford to the status of a world-class uni
versity, developing its financial status and
international prestige. "He will be remem
bered as one of the builders of Stanford
University rather than as one of its man
agers," he added.
Robert Rosenzweig, president of the
Association of American Universities,
echoed that sentiment, saying Kennedy has
brought the school a strength that many
take for granted.
"It's easy for people to lose sight of the
fact that Stanford is today a very strong
institution. It's a fundamentally healthy
university that has some problems to
solve."
Rosenzweig said he sees in Kennedy's
resignation a great loss both to Stanford

and to the education community. "His con
tribution to the national discourse on high
er education and on science policy has
been of the highest caliber — the loss of
that voice will be a great loss to the nation."
Unfairly criticized
Peers in education and fellow University

officials also said Kennedy
has been unfairly criticized
for the indirect-cost contro
versy and become the rep
resentative of a problem
for which he didn't deserve
the blame.
Gregorian emphasized
that Stanford, and
Kennedy in particular,
have taken the blame for
accounting problems that
are chronic at major
research universities. "I'm
sorry that Stanford had to
be a lightning rod for many
institutions," Gregorian
said.
Kennedy has unfairly
been the victim of misper
ceptions and of the public's

failure to understand the real issues,
Gregorian said. "Unfortunately, percep
tions are very important. Instead of looking
at structural changes, people usually look
at who's in charge."
Gregorian added that Kennedy has
shown great leadership by refusing to point
fingers. "He did not blame anyone," he
said.
"It's unfortunate that out of 30 million
transactions with federal research money,
accounting could bring out the kind of
aberrations that we've seen in the news,"
Gregorian said.
Rosenzweig said the attention drawn to
cost-recovery practices at Stanford was out
of proportion to the errors committed by
the University.
"My sense is that Stanford was the first
[to be investigated] and therefore the most
exposed. Stanford also had the misfortune
of having a yacht, [which became] a disas
trous symbol of the whole controversy."
University officials agreed.
"I was kind of wounded by his resigna
tion," said Gary Ernst, dean of School of
Applied Earth Sciences. "I think he's got
ten a bad rap and bad press — it got blown
out of proportion.
"I'm very sad that he's stepping down. I
wish he hadn't But he's given this a
great deal of thought and he thinks it's
best. The man is totally dedicated to this
university — the fact that he's stepping
down shows that." .
A 'fearless asker of money'
Kennedy was also praised for his accom
plishments as a fund raiser. He tripled the

University's endowment during his tenure
and led Stanford's $1.1 billion Centennial
campaign.
It was a role, University officials said, for
which Kennedy, an effective communicator
with enthusiasm for Stanford's mission,
was perfectly suited.
"Don has been a driving force behind

our success," said John
Ford, vice president in the
Office of Development.
Ford, who previously
worked with the develop
ment office at the School of
Medicine, has worked with
Kennedy through all 11
years of his presidency.
"The president is the
public spokesman for the
University," Ford said. "He
articulates the goals of
Stanford and the objectives
of the campaign."
Ford added that
Kennedy is "a fearless
asker of money. Some peo
ple get nervous in such situ
ations, but Don can just
look at someone across a

table and ask for $1 mil
lion. Don docs that exceed
ingly well."
Kennedy has been such a
successful fund raiser in
part because he "has a mar
velous vision of what
Stanford should be.... I've
never run into anyone who
could speak — with great
specificity — to a wider vari
ety of subjects," Ford said.
Ford said he is delighted
that Kennedy will remain
president for another year.
"We will benefit a great
deal from having him stay
around," he said. "There's
probably no one else who
understands complex issues
as Don does There are
still seven months left in the

(Centennial) campaign, and he still has an
important role to play."
He added that Stanford's next president
will need fund-raising skills to match
Kennedy's. "The demand for fund raising
money is only going to increase," he said.
Bill Stone, president of the Stanford
Alumni Association, agreed.
"In many ways, he was the personifica
tion of the institution and its values," said
Stone. "He was a dream president for the
Alumni Association."
Kennedy "tackles crowds well" and
"knows everything going on in the
University," Stone said. "He is an extraor
dinary salesman for Stanford."
Stone added that the next president

should, like Kennedy, "have
Stanford in the heart as well as
the head."
Loss of confidence
But Kennedy is not with
out his critics, and the faculty
members who called for his
resignation this spring have
become no less strident now
that Kennedy has announced
his plan to leave.
"He had really lost the
confidence of the faculty," said
Engineering Prof. William
Spicer. The faculty, Spicer
added, were faced with "how
to try to attack the problems as
long as he is still in office."
Spicer added that Kennedy
should bow out before the end
of next year.
Political Science Prof.
John Manley said, "His posi
tion had become increasingly
untenable." Manley, who has
been a vocal critic of the pres
ident, called for Kennedy's
resignation at a Faculty
Senate meeting in May.
"For a long time he tried
to present himself to the
media as the solution to the
problem," he added. "I think
he lost his credibility and was
hurting Stanford."
Manley also maintains
that Kennedy's plan to remain
for one more year is not in the
University's best interest.
"The sooner he leaves, the
better," he said.
"Under Kennedy, Stanford
has been a roaring financial

success and a dismal moral failure," Manley
said. Stanford needs a president who will
place "emphasis on the institution as a moral
institution, not how much we can extract
from the government or alumni," he added.
For example, Manley wants the next
administration to confront the issues
brought out by Webb Ranch. "We need
someone who will go up there and take a
look at the squalor and realize there's
something wrong with it. Kennedy refused
to go up — to look at anything."
Student regret
Although student reaction is difficult to
gauge during the summer, when most stu
dents are away from campus, those inter
viewed expressed regret at the news, saying
they will miss the amiable and accessible
president.
"He's a great guy, and he's done a lot for
Stanford during his term," said John Louie,
a member of the Council of Presidents.
"He's really personable and has done an
excellent job reaching students," said Louie,
citing the accessibility that has been a trade
mark of Kennedy's tenure. Kennedy often
visits student residences, invites students to
his house and has served as an undergradu-

ate adviser.
"It will be interesting to
see if his replacement can
do as good a job" with stu
dents, Louie added.
"He was able to relate to
students on a level that you
wouldn't expect of a univer
sity president," said Allen
Thorpe, a senior majoring in
public policy. Kennedy was
Thorpe's freshman adviser.
"He had a good sense of the
concerns of students,"
Thorpe said.
"It's sad," said Shelagh
Sandstedt, a sophomore. "I
agree with those who say he
was blamed unfairly" for the
indirect-cost controversy.
"A new name will bring

a new air to Stanford, at
least in the public's eyes," added Sandstedt.
"It will be like a new start."
In the long run, Rosenzweig said, the
controversy that dominated the last year
will be only a footnote in assessments of
Kennedy's career. "I just don't think it will
be that important."
Instead, "He will be remembered for
articulating and focusing attention on the
disparity between teaching and research
that's grown up over the last decade,"
Rosenzweig said.
"I regret his leaving — we'll be the poor
er for it," Gregorian said, "He is a wonder
ful man."
