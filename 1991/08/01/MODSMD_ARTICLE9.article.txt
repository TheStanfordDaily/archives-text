## Kennedy's resignation brings regret, admiration to Stanford 
### Steve McCarroll 
For Brown University President Vartan
Gregorian, Donald Kennedy has been "a
fearless spokesman for higher education."
For Dean of Students Michael Jackson,
he has been"the inspirational leader
whose leadership provided the context for
great change to take place."
But for 11 classes of Stanford students,
Kennedy has been the accessible president
who visited them in their residences,
answered their questions and could be
seen jogging in the Foothills and riding his
bike to work.
When the 59-year-old president on
Monday announced plans to resign next
year, many students, administrators and
national education leaders praised the
career of the man who has been Stanford's
president for the last 11 years.
An inspirational leader
University officials, expressing regret
about the president's departure, conceded
that circumstances had made Kennedy's
resignation all but inevitable.
However, they characterized Kennedy's
decision to resign from the presidency as
courageous, saying he was acting on his
devotion to the University.
"The leader's natural reaction to prob
lems is to try to solve them," said James
Gibbons, dean of the School of
Engineering. "That's why I think it was
especially thoughtful of the president to
realize, as he put it, that it is difficult for
one who has been identified with the prob
lem to be the spokesman for its solution."
"I think he's expressing the leadership
that we've come to expect," said Provost
James Rosse. "The decision was clearly
and carefully made ... based on his assess
ment of what was best for the University.
That takes a great deal of leadership and

statesmanship."
Dean of Research Robert Byer praised
the form of Kennedy's resignation."It was
done in style, and in a way that will allow
Stanford to think about its future without
worrying about its past."
"It is impossible to overestimate Don's
devotion to the University," agreed
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch.
Jackson said Kennedy's resignation will
"change the debate over what Stanford is
doing right now."
"He's been an inspirational leader for a
lot of people on campus," Jackson said of
Kennedy's tenure. Jackson cited
Kennedy's contributions in helping diversi
fy the student body. "He articulated the
vision that allows people of color, women,
lesbian, gay and bisexual students (and)
students with disability all to feel comfort
able."
Kennedy, according to Jackson, has pro
vided the kind of intellectual leadership
that facilitates progressive change. "He
helped create an environment" where such
changes as curricular reform could take
place, said Jackson.
Jackson added that he hopes Stanford's
next president "is a kindred spirit in these
areas."
A fearless spokesperson
Education leaders across the country
praised Kennedy's accomplishments.
Princeton University President Harold
Shapiro called Kennedy's tenure "a period
of enormous accomplishment."
"Probably no university in the United
States has made as broad a level of contri
bution" as Stanford under Kennedy's
tenure, Shapiro said. "I have a tremen
dously high opinion of what has been
accomplished at Stanford in this decade."

"In scholarship, Stanford has made
accomplishments in just about every area,"
Shapiro said, citing advances in the medi
cal sciences, engineering and Stanford's
innovative program in human biology,
which Kennedy helped create. "I also think
the student body at Stanford during this
period has continued to improve."
Gregorian said Kennedy "opened up
Stanford to both international and nation
al diversity."
"President Kennedy is a great national
leader, a man of integrity, a man of vision,
a man of honesty. He was a fearless
spokesman on behalf of higher education,"
Gregorian said.
Kennedy is "one of a handful of people
willing to speak out on even the most con
troversial issues," he added.
For example, Kennedy once appeared
on the MacNeil-Lehrer Report to debate
then-Education Secretary William Bennett
on the curriculum reform that was taking
place at Stanford and at other schools.
Gregorian said Kennedy has lifted
Stanford to the status of a world-class uni
versity, developing its financial status and
international prestige. "He will be remem
bered as one of the builders of Stanford
University rather than as one of its man
agers," he added.
Robert Rosenzweig, president of the
Association of American Universities,
echoed that sentiment, saying Kennedy has
brought the school a strength that many
take for granted.
"It's easy for people to lose sight of the
fact that Stanford is today a very strong
institution. It's a fundamentally healthy
university that has some problems to
solve."
Rosenzweig said he sees in Kennedy's
resignation a great loss both to Stanford
