# Cost proposal appears costly
## 
### 
Stanford would lose about $10
million a year if a White House
reform proposal on indirect-cost
recovery is adopted, according to
Peter Van Etten, the University's
new chief financial officer.
Under the proposal, which was
issued in late June by Richard
Darman, director of the executive

branch's Office
of Management
and Budget, the
administrative
component of
universities' indi
rect-cost rates
would be capped
at 26 percent.
Administra
tive costs are one

category of expenses for which the
government reimburses research
universities.
In a letter sent to OMB offi
cials last week, Van Etten calls the
proposed cap "a dramatic depar
ture from the sound, longstand
ing policy of cost-based reim
bursement" and says the proposal
"would damage the research
capacity of universities."

Stanford contends that the
OMB's definition of administra
tive costs is "overly broad."
According to Van Etten, Stan
ford's "pure" administrative-cost
rate is close to 26 percent, but the
University's rate as defined by
language in the OMB proposal is
closer to 33 percent.
The difference would cost
Stanford $10 million annually,
Van Etten says.
A comment period on the
OMB proposal, which is aimed at

limiting "abuses"
at Stanford and
other research
universities,
closed late last
month. Van
Etten's letter
served as Stan
ford's official
comments on the
reform proposal.

OMB officials are currently
reviewing the comments they have
received, and will decide within
the next several weeks whether or
not to alter their proposal. The
proposed rules are currently
expected to be incorporated into
existing regulations on Sept. 1.
In his letter, Van Etten objects
to the government making policy
changes that quickly. "This date

gives too little notice for universi
ties to respond to the severe bud
get impacts that would be caused
by a 26 percent cap," he says.
Stanford has found an unlikely
ally on this issue in Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich.
The powerful chair of the Sub
committee on Oversight and
Investigations held a punishing
one-day hearing on Stanford's
indirect-cost policies in mid-
March. During the hearing, Din
gell castigated the University for
mismanagement of federal funds.

The proposed regula
tion is \particularly
unwise y 9 Van Etten
says.

But Dingell, according to a
spokesman, feels the OMB pro
posal is premature. The 26 per
cent cap "could be too high or too
low," the spokesman said. "The
facts just aren't in."
Dingell is expected to hold
more hearings on universities'
indirect-cost practices in the fall.
In his letter to OMB, Van
Etten also objects to another part
of the White House reform pack
age. The OMB proposal calls for
federal reimbursements to univer
sities for building and equipment
depreciation to be placed in a sep
arate fund, to be used only for
building replacement or renova
tion.
That provision, Van Etten
argues, unfairly punishes universi
ties active in raising private funds
to build facilities. Under the pro
posal, universities could not be
reimbursed for depreciation on
buildings financed by private
funds.
That change, Van Etten says,
"represents an enormous
departure from years of govern
ment practice." The proposed
regulation is "particularly
unwise," he says.
