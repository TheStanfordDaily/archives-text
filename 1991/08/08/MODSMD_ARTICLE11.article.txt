Two-year-old Justin Cox is
breathing on his own and recover
ing rapidly after a heart-lung
transplant performed at the
Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital, according to David Cox,
the boy's father.
The Texas youngster suffered
from a rare congenital heart dis
ease that was diagnosed when he
was 10 days old. The disease also
damaged his lungs. After waiting
six months for a donor, Justin
underwent approximately three
hours of surgery Friday.
"He's doing really great. Every
thing is going ahead of schedule,"
said Justin's father. "We've still
got a lot of hurdles ahead of us,
but the biggest one is over."
Justin will stay in the hospital
for three weeks but will remain in
the area for observation for
another three months, he said.
The family should be back
together in Dallas in time for
Christmas, he said.
David and Diana Cox brought
their son to the children's hospital
in February after doctors in Texas
were unable to perform the
needed surgery.
The Coxes established the Save
A Heart Foundation in Texas to
raise funds for Justin's surgery
and for other children who need
heart or heart-lung transplants.
Justin's transplant was the first
such surgery at the new children's
hospital, which opened in June.
