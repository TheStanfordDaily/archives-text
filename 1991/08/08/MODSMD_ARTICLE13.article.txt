# The 						death of communism?
## 
### 
First the fall of the Berlin Wall,
and now this. What would Lenin
say if he knew?
The Hoover Institution Press
has announced that the 25th vol
ume of its annual "Yearbook on
International Communist Affairs"
will be the last published.
Described in its press packet as
"a must for anyone interested in
keeping abreast of global commu
nism," the 1991 yearbook profiles
the decline of a world political sys
tem.
Editor Richard Staar was
unwilling to comment about the
final yearbook until September,
when it is due out. However, he
told The Chronicle of Higher
Education that changing times
were a reason for the discontinua
tion of the book.
"President Bush just announced
again in Moscow that the Cold War
is over," he said.
So is communism dead? Buy
the book and find out.
