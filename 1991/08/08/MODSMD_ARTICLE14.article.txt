# Prof. publicly apologizes

Material Science and Engi
neering Prof. William Tiller has
publicly apologized to former stu
dent Robert Beyers for not giving
him credit for work included in
Tiller's new book.
Beyers, now a researcher at the
IBM research center in south San
Jose, contacted Tiller as soon as
he was aware of the plagiarism.
He said he came across the mate
rial while browsing through the
book in his company's library.
In a July 24 letter to Tiller, Bey
ers wrote, "Your new book, 'The
Science of Crystallization: Micro
scopic Interfacial Phenomena,'

reproduces one
table, two figures
and about a full
page of text from
three articles
previously pub
lished by me."
Beyers said he
was surprised by
Tiller's omission
because other

students had told him that Tiller
always credited him properly in
class. This fact, and Tiller's quick
response and apology, supported
Beyers' belief that the plagiarism
was an error.
"Given the many other refer
ences contained in your book, I
assume that the lack of a proper
citation of my work was just an
oversight on your part," wrote
Beyers.
However, Beyers requested
that he receive public credit for

the work.
"It is a mistake that should be
corrected," he wrote.
In a responding letter, Tiller
said, "Please accept my apologies
for not having referenced your
material that appears on pages
254-8 of my book. It was indeed an
oversight on my part and I feel
terrible about the slip-up."
Tiller also agreed to revise
future editions of the book and
has asked his publisher to add an
"erratum" sheet in unsold copies.
He is currently waiting for word
from his publisher.
Beyers said he was satisfied
with Tiller's response to his
requests. In a July 29 letter, he
wrote, "If the publisher agrees to
include the erratum sheet in
unsold copies, then I will consider
this matter resolved to our mutual
satisfaction."
But the case may not quite be
over. University policy calls for the
dean of the appropriate school to
conduct an initial inquiry into any
allegation of plagiarism "or other
practices that seriously deviate
from those that are commonly
accepted within the scientific
community for proposing, con

ducting or reporting research."
Engineering Dean James Gib
bons was unavailable for com
ment, but is expected to conduct
an inquiry into the issue, accord
ing to officials in the School of
Engineering.
This is the second case of pla
giarism to affect Stanford
recently. In July, a Business School
Lecturer Richard Pascale was
accused of copying a 1986 article
from the Washington Monthly for
his book on corporate manage
ment.
Like Tiller, Pascale admitted
his mistake but denied charges of
intentional plagiarism.
