# Credit Union plea changed
## 
### 
Maurice St. James, one of the
three gunmen involved in holding
up the Medical Center branch of
the Stanford Federal Credit
Union last February, pleaded
guilty to all charges Monday.
According to the Palo Alto
Police Department, St. James and
two unidentified males entered

the credit union from a rear stair
well that connects the Stanford
Hospital basement to the parking
lot adjacent to Quarry Road. One
of the robbers pointed a gun at an
employee's head while another
stole cash from the drawers and
the safe.
The sum of money stolen was
initially estimated between
$50,000-$60,000, but that figure
was later found to be inaccurate,
according to Credit Union Presi
dent Warren Marshall. He
declined to say how much was
actually stolen.
After the heist, the thieves
escaped into two waiting cars.
However, St. James was involved
in a car accident in East Palo Alto
minutes later. He was then
arrested by police.
The other perpetrators
escaped.
St. James, an East Palo Alto
resident, pleaded not guilty when
the trial began, according to Palo
Alto Police Detective Brad Zook,
who has been in charge of the case
since February.
On the third day, however, St.
James changed his plea to what
Zook called "straight up." This

means St. James pleaded guilty to
all of the charges against him,
including robbery and the use of
firearms.
The change in plea will not
affect St. James' punishment,
Zook said. "When sentencing,
they take into consideration the
seriousness of the offense and
prior record and such," said Zook,
"so this will make no difference —
except to shorten the trial."
St. James is scheduled for sen
tencing Sept. 5.
