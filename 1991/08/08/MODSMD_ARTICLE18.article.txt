# THE 						UNEASY TRUCE BETWEEN STANFORD AND PALO ALTO TOWN & Gown
## 
### STEVE MC CARROLL 
Five o'clock traffic on
Palm Drive, where
cars spill out from
Stanford's campus
into Palo Alto. Traffic
is the number one
complaint of Palo
Alto officials, who
say that Stanford
develops its property
without mitigating the
effects of traffic on
the city.

Colleges and college towns
don't always make good
neighbors. For example,
residents of Chapel Hill,
N.C., occasionally awaken to
find the town's main street painted
Carolina blue — an indication that the
University of North Carolina won the
basketball game the night before.
Residents of Amherst, Mass., look
forward to what they call the "summer
serenity," when the town's streets are
no longer mobbed with partying college
students on weekend evenings.
Stanford and Palo Alto, separated by
the mile-long Palm Drive, are spared
many of the antagonisms that
characterize most college-college town
relationships. But the University and
the city have found plenty of other
things to quarrel about in a relationship
that participants describe as, in its
better moments, an uneasy truce.
"Whenever a major university
borders on an enlightened community,
there are bound to be flare-ups," says
Andrew Doty, Stanford's director of
community relations.
Students aren't generally the source
of acrimony in relations between the
University and the city. In fact,
residents have praise for the
undergraduates who tutor
underprivileged students in nearby East
Palo Alto and for the law students who
help many Palo Alto senior citizens with
their tax returns.
Palo Altans are more likely to be up
in arms about the University's
development policies and ongoing
construction — problems that city
officials say are all the more important
because of their permanent effect on
the surrounding community.
A city of some 55,000, Palo
Alto is known for its tree
lined streets, its well
educated and active
citizenry and a quality of
living that has placed it on several lists
of the nation's best places to live.
Palo Alto's public schools are among
the best in the country, esteemed and
studied by other school districts. Palo
Alto was also one of the first cities in
the nation to introduce restrictions on
smoking in public areas.
The site of the headquarters for the
Earth Day organization, Palo Alto also
maintains a rather unique street-tree
policy, under which it keeps an
inventory of the trees that line the city's
curbs and enforces strict guidelines on
planting and removal. More than a
quarter of the city is preserved as parks
and open space.
On maps of electoral behavior, Palo
Alto is a liberal island surrounded by a
sea of suburban conservatism. It was
one of a handful of California

communities that voted against
Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that
launched a nationwide tax revolt.
Residents foresaw the effect that the
measure would have on local
government and schools, observers say.
It is also a city that has tried hard in
the last 15 years to control its growth,
fighting urbanization with measures
that some have praised as effective and
others have criticized as "too little, too
late."
For example, the city has grappled
with what Palo Alto City Council
members describe as an enormous
traffic problem — one that, despite
attempts at control worsen seems to
each year.
Palo Alto also has a chronic housing
shortage that drives up the price of
housing and is increasingly squeezing
young and middle-class families out of
the community.
Stanford contributes to both of these
problems, says Emily Renzel, a City
Council member. Renzel, who has
fought urbanization from various levels
in city government for 15 years, says
Stanford's lack of consideration for the
city has contributed to the city's
dilemmas.
"Stanford does little to mitigate the
effects of its development on Palo
Alto," says Renzel. The University, she
adds, sends 5,000 students off-campus
to compete with local residents for
housing and brings thousands of cars
through Palo Alto every day.
Although some of the cars are faculty
and staff, most are attracted to
commercial developments on Stanford
land. About 24,000 people work in
Stanford Research Park, a University
owned development that includes
offices of Hewlett-Packard, Syntex and
the Wall Street Journal.
Stanford Shopping Center is visited
by an average of several thousand
shoppers daily.
The University's commercial
developments do bring the city tax
revenue. A 1984 study estimated that
Palo Alto received $17.4 million in
property taxes, sales taxes and net
utility income from Stanford property.
But that's not enough for Palo Altans
like Renzel, who claim Stanford's
development is injuring the community.
"Stanford keeps making itself bigger
and bigger," says Renzel. "The
University has to start limiting its
growth."
Doty disagrees with the
claim that the University
has contributed to the
area's urbanization. "The
question that I like to
propose is, what if the University
weren't here," Doty says. He speculates
that the University's 8,200 acres would
have been developed much like the

surrounding area, adding to the
Peninsula's urban sprawl and bringing
in an additional 80,000 people.
Some of the clashes between
Stanford and Palo Alto have been
longstanding. For example, the
University has been trying to extend
Sand Hill Road for many years.
Hundreds of cars each day use Sand
Hill Road to cut across the western
edge of the University, creating a
bottleneck in the parking lot of Stanford
Shopping Center. To end the traffic
jams there, Stanford wants to extend
Sand Hill Road to HI Camino Real
where it intersects with Alma Street.
Palo Alto residents near Alma Street
have successfully opposed the extension
for several years. They claim the
extension would send hundreds of cars
past their homes every day, despite
University assurances that Sand Hill
Road traffic could he diverted away
from Alma Street. The University plans

to continue to seek
permission to extend Sand
Hill Road this year.
A more recent conflict
has developed over
Stanford's planned
construction on several
parcels of land on Quarry
Road, across the street
from Saks Fifth Avenue.
The University plans to
build a psychiatric hospital
on one of the parcels and
expand the Medical Center
complex onto another.
When Stanford asked
the county to rezone the
parcels, Palo Alto officials
insisted Stanford also be
required to build

residential housing on the site.
Stanford officials reached a
compromise with the city by agreeing to
build residential housing elsewhere on
campus if the University expands the
Medical Center by more than 175,000
feet.
Palo Alto residents also
protested last month when
Stanford prohibited parking
near the entrance to the
Foothills, which many local
residents use for jogging and other
recreation. The residents claimed the
parking prohibition in fact prevented
their use of the Foothills.
Stanford officials said they acted in
response to complaints from residents
of Gerona Road, where the
rccreationists were parking their cars.
Though the last few years have seen
something of a detente between the
University and the city, antipathy
remains. The resentment has at times
spilled over into a general suspicion
bordering on contempt for the
University's activities.
"People in Palo Alto were not crazy
about Stanford getting the Super Bowl
(in 1985), and they made a point of
saying the Super Bowl was in Stanford
and not in Palo Alto,

says Marc Simon, a
columnist for the
Peninsula Times
Tribune. "They
studiously tried to
ignore the Super
Bowl's presence."
Simon says many
Palo Altans have a
parochialism that
comes out of a deep
confidence that they
know better.
"It must frustrate
Palo Alto, which loves
to tell people the
correct way to organize
their lives, to be next
to so much privately
owned land" that is
outside the city's
jurisdiction, says
Simon. "It's a conflict
between somebody
who can't tell people
what to do, and
somebody who
wouldn't listen anyway

The 97-year relationship between the
city and the University has been marked
by alternating periods of accord and
acrimony.
Stanford faculty played an important
role in many of the accomplishments
that marked the city's early history: its

self-owned municipal utility system, its
library system and its city charter.
After World War IF, the value of land
on the Peninsula started to increase
dramatically. As property values
increased, so did taxes, and the
University found its 8,20<) acre site —
which its founding grant prohibited it
from selling — to be a tax liability.
So University officials sought ways to
raise money from the land, to turn that
liability into an asset. The result was the
lucrative commercial development of
1,000 acres of Stanford's land. The
subsequent decades saw the
construction of Stanford Shopping
Center, the dozens of medical office
buildings along Welch Road and the
Stanford Research Park.
The development provided
handsome income for the University —
and for the City of Palo Alto, which
quickly annexed the developed sites in
exchange for providing municipal

services.
Palo Alto officials welcomed these
developments, pleased that Stanford
was developing a tax base.
But as the town became more
affluent, in the 1960s and early 19705,
many Palo Altans came to worry about
the University's growth. Increasingly the
city began to challenge Stanford's
development projects, claiming that they
brought traffic to the city and
contributed to the region's urbanization.
The "residentialist" movement —
which stressed the concerns of residents
about urbanization and opposed
commercial growth — became the
central issue in city politics. And it
wasn't a pleasant era for relations with
the University, which considered its
development of much of the
surrounding area to be well within its
rights. Doty recalls that "there was a fair
amount of bitterness in the anti-growth
campaign."
The concerns reached a boiling point
over the Oregon Expressway, which was
built in 1964 to bring employees to
Stanford Research Park. The project
required that dozens of Palo Alto
houses be torn down.
"Stanford was perceived as rich,
selfish and secretive," Doty says, adding
that Palo Altans
thought decisions
about their

community s
future were being
made at the San
Francisco
meetings of
Stanford's Board
of Trustees.
"People were
suspicious of the
University's
autonomy."
But the cold
war began to thaw
in the early '70s,
when Stanford
and the city
reached a series of
compromises.
First, in 1972,
the trustees
declared that the
University's
outlying lands
were to be held as
an academic "land

bank" and were not to be developed for
commercial purposes. "That decision
was quite reassuring to our neighbors,"
Doty says.
Then the parties reached an
agreement, under which Palo Alto
gained what Doty calls "a good deal of
influence" in county decisions about the

University's land use. Since 1972, plans
for development are referred by the
County Board of Supervisors to the
County Planning Commission. The
commission routinely solicits input from
Palo Alto.
Finally, the University made an
effort to become more open in its
relations with its neighbors. Doty says
Stanford undertook a policy "to try to
take into consideration the feelings of
our neighbors.... It has paid off in the
long run."
In recent years, for example,
when the University formulated
plans for the development of the
western areas of Stanford's
property, officials set up a series
of open planning meetings, where Palo
Alto residents came to voice their
concerns.
But that's not enough to head off all
of the sources of conflict, and officials

traffic congestion.

expect disagreements to continue.
"We will continue to have
differences of opinion," says Palo Alto
Mayor Jack Sutorius, who describes the
Stanford-Palo Alto relationship as
"symbiotic" and emphasizes that both
sides have much to gain. "But I would
say that the benefits of the relationship
are well-recognized and well
appreciated."
"I like to think people feel a little less
threatened by the University," Doty
says. "I'm pleased at the progress we've
made — which isn't to say something
couldn't hit the fan tomorrow morning."
