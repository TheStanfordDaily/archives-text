The family of Palo Alto City
Council member Emily
Renzel jokes that she
considers Stanford "the
Evil Empire."
But Renzel doesn't laugh when
she describes the problems that she
says the University creates for the
community — problems that she has

fought hard to
prevent in her 12
years on the City
Council.
"Traffic.
Stanford creates
huge amounts of
traffic," she says.
"The major
congested
intersections are
like a necklace
around Stanford."
So Renzel
opposes any
development of
Stanford land that
is likely to worsen
Palo Alto's traffic
problem. And
when she can't
block it altogether,
she often forces

some kind of concession from
Stanford officials — such as the
construction of new roads and
expansion of existing ones within the
University.
"The commercial part (of the
University) has become a thing in
itself," says Renzel. "Palo Altans feel
a lot of resentment for the unbridled
growth."
Now in her third term on the City
Council, Renzel has spent much of
her tenure fighting urbanization.
Stanford's research centers,
professional buildings and shopping
center have turned the University
into "a major urban center," she says,
But her complaints aren't limited
to Stanford's development policy.
She also accuses the University of

duplicity and says she finds
administrators excruciating to deal
with.
"Stanford officials come to the
council three or four times a year
with some big thing," she says. "We
have to sit through an hour-long
presentation by Stanford officials."
Then, Renzel says, after the

University gets
preliminary
approval for an
innocuous-sounding
project, "Stanford
changes its mind"
and develops a
monstrosity.
Renzel
denies Stanford
officials' claim that
the City Council is
dominated by
"residentialist"
forces like those she
represents.
"There's great
reluctance on the
City Council to
oppose what
Stanford wants,"
she says. "This City
Council has not

made Stanford jump through one
hoop."
She also says she finds Stanford
officials overly aggressive, citing the
struggle over the zoning of three
lots on Quarry Road. "They just
push and pull until they get exactly
what they want," she says.
"They also act like it's a fait
accompli," adds Renzel, who says
she finds Stanford somewhat
arrogant in pursuing its
development plans.
Now serving the last year of her
current term, Renzel plans to
continue opposing Stanford's
projects. "God knows what Stanford
has in mind for those Quarry Road
parcels," she says.
