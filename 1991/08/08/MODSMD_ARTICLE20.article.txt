# Good fences make good neighbors
## 
### 
Being neighborly is
Andrew Doty's job.
"You have to
demonstrate that
Stanford cares, that
Stanford is really interested in its
neighbors," says the University's
director of community relations. "I
try to contribute to what they want
to make for a better community."
Doty describes himself as an
antenna. "Much of my job is just
listening," he says.
He adds that he spends much of
his time going to Palo Alto City
Council meetings, having lunch
with city officials and thoroughly
reading local newspapers. "I
report back to the University what
feelings are out there," Doty says.
A Palo Alto resident, Doty also
tries to be active in a variety of
community organizations, serving
on the Chamber of Commerce
board, the Red Cross board and
the Neighbors Abroad board.
As an advocate for the
University, he represents and
defends Stanford's point of view on
a variety of issues, from the use of
the Foothills to the development of
Stanford Medical Center.
Doty is also part strategist,
lobbying before city and county
governments. "I have to answer
objections on a daily basis."
"I guess I'm a bit of an archivist,
too," says Doty, who started in the
Office of Public Affairs in 1963 and
moved into community relations in
1972. "I'm sort of an institutional
memory."
Doty remembers a number of
flare-ups between "the town and th
gown," his way of refering to Palo
Alto and the University.

His memories include everything
from the student protests of the '60s,
which spilled out into the city's quiet
suburban streets, to theseveral-year
long struggle to extend Sand Hill
Road through to El Camino Real.
The situations that cross Doty's
desk can be at times amusing.
Recently the University decided to
put a fence around Searsville Lake,
which is on Stanford property west of
Interstate 280.
A fair amount of study went into
the question of whether to paint the
fence green, so it would be less visible
in the winter, or brown, to hide it in

the summer, Doty said. But despite
this consultation, the University
received complaints.
"Any other developer would go out
and put up their fence and be done
with it," Doty says.
"There are people to this day that
think that Stanford is basically an evil
force," says Doty. His job is to
appease them — and, if he can't get
them to join, to beat them when they
oppose Stanford's plans.
Still, Doty is conciliatory. "I think
we bend ourselves over backward to
accommodate," he says.
