## International hoops test has a tinge of Cardinal 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
The Pan American Games men's bas
ketball team is hot, but the women are just
angry.
With Adam Keefe starting for the men
and Jennifer Azzi and Sonja Henning con
tributing on the women's side, hoops in
Havana has a decidedly Stanford flavor.
In its opener, the men's team was singu
larly unimpressive against host Cuba, but
got the job done, 92-88. That was followed
by a 91-66 win over Venezuela on Monday

and an 87-81 defeat of Argentina on Tues
day.
While the U.S. team has been played
close by its opponents, it nevertheless ran
its record to 3-0 and assured itself a berth
in the quarterfinals.
For his part, Keefe has been a steady, if
unspectacular, performer in the middle. He
had his best game against the Argentines,
going five-for-five from the field and hitting
both his free throws for a total of 12 points.
Keefe also tied for team-honors with five
rebounds. Keefe scored eight against
Venezuela and 10 against Cuba.

The women were stunned by Brazil on
Saturday, losing their first game in interna
tional competition since the 1982 World
Championships final. In the interim, the
U.S. squad had won 42 straight.
But, the Brazilians scored an 87-84 vic
tory. Fortunately for the U.S. women, their
defeat was sandwiched by two wins. In its
opener, the United States downed Canada
87-70. The defeat was followed by a 97-40
thrashing of Argentina.
Coach Vivian Stringer was ready to pre
sent a list of what they needed to do to
bounce back when she walked into a team

meeting before the Argentina game. As
soon as she saw the determination etched
on the players' faces, though, she dispensed
with the list.
"They recognized what needed to be
done," Stringer said. "I asked if anyone
wanted to share what was said (amongst
the players), and they said they preferred
to demonstrate by their actions. I didn't
think there was anything more to say. It
showed on their faces."
The result was a dismantling of the
Argentines and a strong statement that the
United States is still the team to beat.
