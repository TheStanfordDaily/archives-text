## Havana good time? Wish you were here 
### 
Those tuning in to the early
stages of the Pan American
Games on ABC last week
end could easily have been left
wondering.
Wondering why the Olympic
theme was being used to segue
into and out of commercials when
the event clearly was anything but
Olympian. Wondering why finan
cially strapped Cuba would spend
millions of dollars to build brand
new athletic venues — and fail to
finish them on time.
And, indeed, simply wondering
why they were watching at all.
Let me set the record straight
before I go careening out of con
trol: I watched the Goodwill
Games last summer (and am will
ing to admit it in print). Indeed, I
spent the better part of a fort
night's evenings in front of the
television, despite the presence of
Larry King leaning forward and
craning his neck over his shoulder
so he could talk to me.
But even though the Goodwill
Games are a made-for-TV extrav
aganza without much history, Ted
Turner and Co. were able to
entice many of the world's best to
Seattle.
Leroy Burrell raced Carl Lewis
in the 100 meters — and beat him.
Summer Sanders swam against
Janet Evans in the 400 individual
medley — and beat her. Those
four are all Americans, to be sure,
but they're also the best in their
respective events.
And they are definitely not in
Havana seeking Pan Am gold at
the moment.
That wouldn't be as much of a
problem if, say, the best European
and Asian competitors were on
hand to fill the quality gap. But
notice that silly word American in
the title of the games.
North Americans, South
Americans, Central Americans.
That's all, folks. And, if the best of
them stay away in droves — which
they have — there won't be too
much world-class competition.
Fortunately for the host
Cubans, this doesn't present a
problem. Instead, it's an opportu
nity to rack up lots of medals and
even more national pride. The
Cubans, you see, wouldn't dare
disappoint Fidel Castro by seek
ing better competition elsewhere.
As a result, the Cubans arc
dominating all comers in the early
going at the games and our fair
United States is left looking like a
second-rate athletic power.
(Jingoism warning: The follow
ing contains flag-waving and may
cause dizziness or nausea. Preg
nant women and anyone being
treated for a heart ailment are
advised to seek a doctor's permis

sion before continuing.)
Aren't you getting just a little
tired of seeing these two-bit
"nations" stomp all over the good
oP U.S. of A. in international
competition? It's bad enough we
can't win a gold medal in basket
ball (invented here) anywhere
these days. Now, we're losing the
long jump and the 100 meter (tra
ditional U.S. mainstays) and
blaming the officials.
It wasn't long ago that we
didn't have to complain about the
conditions or blame improper lac
ing techniques in our shoes. We
just won, baby. Now we just whine.
George Steinbrenner, the con
troversial New York Yankees
owner who drove his baseball
team into the ground, is now the
noisemaker-in-residence for the
U.S. Olympic Committee. He says
he doesn't like the fact that Lewis,
Burrell, et al. are gallivanting
around Europe, collecting
appearance fees, while there's this
important thing going on in Cuba.
But hey, wait 'til Barcelona,
Spain, Georgie boy. The Soviets
will out-run, out-jump and out
swim our best. The new, united
German team will blow our doors
like the East Germans did for
years before. We're at best a dis
tant third in the Summer Games
of 1992.
What about the Winter Games,
you say? Worse, for sure. Don't
make plans for Albertville, France
if you want to see Old Glory and
hear the Star Spangled Banner.
Our last snow-covered success
story, written at Sarajevo in '84,
consisted of few golden moments,
a little silver and a large distance
between us and the top of the
medal-count table.
Alas, this is our lot in life,
America. We no longer build the
best cars. We no longer build any
video cassette recorders. Our
biggest banks couldn't afford to
make a deposit at Japan's finan
cial institutions.
These days, it seems, we just
aren't much good at anything any
more.
Except complaining.

will out-run, out-jump and out
swim our best. The new, united
German team will blow our doors
like the East Germans did for
years before. We're at best a dis
tant third in the Summer Games
of 1992.
What about the Winter Games,
you say? Worse, for sure. Don't
make plans for Albertville, France
if you want to see Old Glory and
hear the Star Spangled Banner.
Our last snow-covered success
story, written at Sarajevo in '84,
consisted of few golden moments,
a little silver and a large distance
between us and the top of the
medal-count table.
Alas, this is our lot in life,
America. We no longer build the
best cars. We no longer build any
video cassette recorders. Our
biggest banks couldn't afford to
make a deposit at Japan's finan
cial institutions.
These days, it seems, we just
aren't much good at anything any
more.
Except complaining.
