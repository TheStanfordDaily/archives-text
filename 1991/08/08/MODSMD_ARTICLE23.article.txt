Senior Debbie Graham, for
three years one of the best players
in college tennis, is well on her
way to becoming one of the best
players in the world.
That's right, the world.
Graham jumped better than 20
spots to No. 64 on the Women's
Tennis Association computer
rankings after her performance at
the Mazda Classic last week. She
reached the quarterfinals before
falling to Conchita Martinez, the
world's seventh-ranked player, 6-
0, 7-5. In doubles, Graham
teamed with former UCLA star
Jessica Emmons. The duo lost to
Martinez and Isabelle Demongeot
6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
This week, Graham has taken
off for the $600,000 Players Chal
lenge in Toronto. Thus far, she has
scored a 6-0, 6-1 thrashing of Aus
tralia's Elizabeth Smylie and a 6-
3, 6-4 defeat of Emmons, who
makes her home in Phoenix.

Junior guard Marcus Lollie is a
member of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence select team that is touring

Holland and Belgium, the Pac
10's seventh such trip since 1983.
The Cardinal is also repre
sented on the squad by coach
Mike Montgomery and assistant
coach Willis Wilson. Trainer
extraordinaire Dake Walden
rounds out the Stanford contin
gent.
The team left the country yes
terday for a series of roughly six
games. They will return to the
United States Sunday, Aug. 18.
TV talk
An administrative law judge of
the Federal Trade Commission
dismissed a complaint lodged by
the FTC against Capital
Cities/ABC. At issue was whether
ABC's monopoly rights to college
football broadcasts constitutes an
illegal restraint of trade.
The judge, James Timony, said
that because the College Football
Association is a non-profit organi
zation, it is exempt from antitrust,
even though its $300 million deal
with ABC would make a profit.
Stanford, which is not part of
the CFA, is involved in a separate
Pac-10/Big Ten deal with ABC.
This ruling virtually guarantees

that contract will remain invalid.
Odds and ends
■ Pan Am potpourri: Sprinter
Chryste Gaines might have won
the 100 meters were it not for a
controversial false start. Gaines
had a huge lead 20 meters into the
race when the officials waved it
off and ordered a restart.
Gaines then was defeated by
Cuba's Liliana Allen. "If we'd
gone with the first one, I'd have
won," Gaines said. "We didn't
false start."
■ In baseball, Jeffrey Ham
monds and the U.S. squad are off
to a good start in their drive for
gold. The team moved to 3-0 with
a 12-0 rout of Aruba last night.
That strong showing followed up
on a 12-4 pasting of Mexico in
which Hammonds drove in two
runs and also scored twice. He is
the leadoff man and center fielder
for the United States.
■ Both preseason volleyball
polls, the AVCA coaches rankings
and the Volleyball Monthly rat
ings, place the Stanford women
second. Needless to say, UCLA is
No. 1.
