## HA HA HA... Bay Area comedy clubs put laughter in the spotlight 
### Mara Winokur Editorial staff 
Before you go to a comedy club,
there is something you should
know:
Almost all of them are alike.
I'm sorry to be telling you this,
but it's true. Here's the deal: All
clubs have a small stage, frequently
decorated with a brick wall or, if the
place is extravagant, a rendition of
the San Francisco skyline. Sur
rounding the stage — in an area
barely larger than it is — are 30 or
so little tables and chairs. Packed
closely. Very closely.
Five or six waitresses (and yes, I
do mean waitresses), squeeze
between the tables to get you your
drinks, which you have to order to
fulfill the two-drink minimum that
is not included in the cover charge
you paid at the door.
The First person to speak to you
(besides your waitress) is an
announcer of some sort, followed by
an opening act and then the head
liner. All three of these people are
comedians, and it's very difficult to
tell why one is the "opener" while
the other is the "headliner." But
they're all funny.
Hopefully.
The most amazing thing about
Bay Area comedy clubs, however, is
their decor. Nearly every one of
them looks like a cellar. But, as my
friend pointed out, "A very neat cel
lar, with the tables neatly positioned
in a row. No cobwebs. A pseudo-cel
lar."
But fear not. Not all comedy
clubs are exactly alike, though the
basics are the same. There are some
differences — slight as they may be
to the untrained eye — that make
some clubs "better" than others. Or
worse. Depending.
Rooster T. Feathers: Like me,
you may have heard of Rooster T.
Feathers before. Also like me, you
may have confused it with D.B.
Cooper's, a well-known sleazy pick

up spot in San Jose. Then again,
maybe you didn't. In any case, I
did and was, therefore, quite
hesitant about going.
Good thing my friend won half
price tickets for his entire company.
(You drop a card in a bowl at the
entrance, and if it's picked, you win.
This is common at many clubs.)
Located on El Camino Real, in
Sunnyvale, Rooster T. Feathers is a
little bit bigger than other clubs and
has a much wider variety of drinks,
which makes it more pleasant to
drink those necessary two bever
ages. 1 personally suggest the Ice
Cream Sundae.
The Last Laugh: Until recently
(quite recently) with two locations in
San Jose, The Last Laugh is quite
convenient. However, the surviving
club is the one that prompted the cel
lar comment. And, for reasons
unknown, it smells like butter. Which,
if you like butter, I suppose could be
pleasant. But if you don't...
Yet The Last Laugh does manage
to attract top-name comedians on a
fairly consistent basis. For example,
Elayne Boosler will be appearing in
November. And, just like Rooster T.
Feathers, The Last Laugh has a
drawing for 25 free tickets. I have
yet to see anyone not win.
The Punchline: This is my
favorite of all the comedy clubs in
the area. I've been there three or
four times, and every time the come
dians were hysterical. Really. Of all
the clubs I've been to, the Punchline
has the most consistently humorous
acts. And you don't have to be 21 to
go-
Located at 444 Battery St., the
Punchline takes a while to get to,
and is difficult to park near, but is
definitely worth it.
The Improv: Perhaps one of the
most famous comedy clubs in the
Bay Area, The Improv has been the
location of many comedy specials
on HBO and other cable stations.
However, one might say that this
fame has gone to The Improv's

I
head, so to speak. A black-and- |
white, sterile club, The Improv J
made me feel as though I wasn't in i
a sufficiently elevated social class. I
felt underdressed as well, since j
most people there looked as though <
they were headed to a ball. I
The Improv is located at 401 1
Mason St. J
Cobb's Comedy Club: Looking j
perhaps the least like a cellar, J
Cobb's resembles a restaurant jj
instead. This means it's a little big- I
ger, a little more roomy and a little j
brighter. But it's still got that great j
wood-paneled look.
Cobb's is located near Fisher- j
man's Wharf, at 2801 Leavenworth 1
St. J
The Planet: In all honesty, I've J
never tried this one. But, it's in San- \
mateo's Dunfey Motel, across the j
street from Shane's Jewelers. What t
more could you want?
The one thing The Planet has >
that most other clubs don't, how- J
ever, is an open mike night for j
comedians, on Wednesdays, j
Advance sign-up is required, so if /
you think you can make people i
laugh, go for it! And better yet, 2
there is no cover charge for patrons j
on these nights.
So go ahead, laugh. After all, life t
is funny. ;

Before you go to a comedy club,
there is something you should
know:
Almost all of them are alike.
I'm sorry to be telling you this,
but it's true. Here's the deal: All
clubs have a small stage, frequently
decorated with a brick wall or, if the
place is extravagant, a rendition of
the San Francisco skyline. Sur
rounding the stage — in an area
barely larger than it is — are 30 or
so little tables and chairs. Packed
closely. Very closely.
Five or six waitresses (and yes, I
do mean waitresses), squeeze
between the tables to get you your
drinks, which you have to order to
fulfill the two-drink minimum that
is not included in the cover charge
you paid at the door.
The First person to speak to you
(besides your waitress) is an
announcer of some sort, followed by
an opening act and then the head
liner. All three of these people are
comedians, and it's very difficult to
tell why one is the "opener" while
the other is the "headliner." But
they're all funny.
Hopefully.
The most amazing thing about
Bay Area comedy clubs, however, is
their decor. Nearly every one of
them looks like a cellar. But, as my
friend pointed out, "A very neat cel
lar, with the tables neatly positioned
in a row. No cobwebs. A pseudo-cel
lar."
But fear not. Not all comedy
clubs are exactly alike, though the
basics are the same. There are some
differences — slight as they may be
to the untrained eye — that make
some clubs "better" than others. Or
worse. Depending.
Rooster T. Feathers: Like me,
you may have heard of Rooster T.
Feathers before. Also like me, you
may have confused it with D.B.
Cooper's, a well-known sleazy pick

up spot in San Jose. Then again,
maybe you didn't. In any case, I
did and was, therefore, quite
hesitant about going.
Good thing my friend won half
price tickets for his entire company.
(You drop a card in a bowl at the
entrance, and if it's picked, you win.
This is common at many clubs.)
Located on El Camino Real, in
Sunnyvale, Rooster T. Feathers is a
little bit bigger than other clubs and
has a much wider variety of drinks,
which makes it more pleasant to
drink those necessary two bever
ages. 1 personally suggest the Ice
Cream Sundae.
The Last Laugh: Until recently
(quite recently) with two locations in
San Jose, The Last Laugh is quite
convenient. However, the surviving
club is the one that prompted the cel
lar comment. And, for reasons
unknown, it smells like butter. Which,
if you like butter, I suppose could be
pleasant. But if you don't...
Yet The Last Laugh does manage
to attract top-name comedians on a
fairly consistent basis. For example,
Elayne Boosler will be appearing in
November. And, just like Rooster T.
Feathers, The Last Laugh has a
drawing for 25 free tickets. I have
yet to see anyone not win.
The Punchline: This is my
favorite of all the comedy clubs in
the area. I've been there three or
four times, and every time the come
dians were hysterical. Really. Of all
the clubs I've been to, the Punchline
has the most consistently humorous
acts. And you don't have to be 21 to
go-
Located at 444 Battery St., the
Punchline takes a while to get to,
and is difficult to park near, but is
definitely worth it.
The Improv: Perhaps one of the
most famous comedy clubs in the
Bay Area, The Improv has been the
location of many comedy specials
on HBO and other cable stations.
However, one might say that this
fame has gone to The Improv's

I
head, so to speak. A black-and- |
white, sterile club, The Improv J
made me feel as though I wasn't in i
a sufficiently elevated social class. I
felt underdressed as well, since j
most people there looked as though <
they were headed to a ball. I
The Improv is located at 401 1
Mason St. J
Cobb's Comedy Club: Looking j
perhaps the least like a cellar, J
Cobb's resembles a restaurant jj
instead. This means it's a little big- I
ger, a little more roomy and a little j
brighter. But it's still got that great j
wood-paneled look.
Cobb's is located near Fisher- j
man's Wharf, at 2801 Leavenworth 1
