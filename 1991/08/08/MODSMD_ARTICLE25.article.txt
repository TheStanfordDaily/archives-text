# New York City's best come together for Jazz Series final weekend
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
While there are many incredible jazz musi
cians in Los Angeles — the commercial cen
ter for many of the arts — New York City is
still widely regarded as the place where jazz is
truer to both its history and modern artists'
intents. It's the place to really get "inside"
jazz.
All the greats — such as Charlie Parker,
Duke Ellington, Dizzie Gillespie, John
Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson
— no matter where they came from, paid
their dues in New York City, playing the clubs
and refining their craft. They wrote an unde
niably rich history of jazz in that city, a history
that is now being studied by those who are
continuing it.
Four of the New York City players now
carrying the jazz torch will be playing
together for the first time tomorrow in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The concert, which

will feature Hal Gelper on piano, Reggie
Workman on bass, Adam Nussbaum on
drums and Ralph Moore on tenor saxophone,
will be the second to last concert in the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop's Summer Concert
Series, which concludes Saturday with the
Regi Oliver Quartet.
Pianist Gelper has been on the jazz scene
for 20 years. Having toured with Cannonball
Adderly and his own quintet during the '70s,
Gelper joined the Grammy award-winning
Phil Woods Quintet, an acoustic be-bop jazz
group, in 1980 and remained with them for 10
years.
Gelper has played on over 30 recordings,
and 75 of his original compositions have been
recorded. A devoted acoustic pianist, Gelper
threw his Fender Rhodes electronic keyboard
into Hudson Bay in 1975. He is now touring
as band leader of the Hal Gelper Trio.
Workman is a legendary jazz bassist who
has been playing since the '50s. He worked
with Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Sonny Stitt,

Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, and
many other greats. Classified by some musi
cians as an avant garde player, Workman has
always been on the cutting edge of jazz as an
art form. He currently performs in a progres
sive trio and teaches music at the acclaimed
New School of Social Research at New York
University. This will be his first appearance in
the Stanford Jazz Workshop Concert Series.
Drummer Nussbaum has been involved

with the Workshop for three years. Also a
music instructor at NYU, Nussbaum has been
on the New York City jazz scene since the '70s
and has played with Michael Brecker, Lee
Konitz and Henderson, among others. An
accomplished player, Nussbaum has recently
been touring Europe.
Tenor saxophonist Moore is a London
born New Yorker who came to the United
States at age 15. A graduate of the Berklee
School of Music in Boston, Moore toured for
four yearffwith Horace Silver in the early '80s
and then played with the Freddie Hubbard
quintet in 1988.
After playing on a recording with Land
mark Records artist Bobby Hutcherson,
Moore joined the label's artist roster. He has
since recorded two albums, which The New
York Times described as "mainstream jazz at
its best." When asked to comment on Friday's
concert and the prospect of working with
Gelper, Workman and Nussbaum for the first
time, Moore replied, "I can't wait."
