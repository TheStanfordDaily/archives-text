# Comedians stand up and fight

Everyone's a comedian. Or so
they say.
Maybe not, but it sure seems that
way, especially during August.
That's when 40 of the country's best
comedians get together to compete
in the 16th Annual San Francisco
Comedy Competition.
If you've never been to one of the
competition rounds, you should go.
You're almost guaranteed to laugh
— a lot. Literally thousands of
comedians audition for the limited
number of spots in the competition;
it takes two months to narrow the
group down. These people are not
just funny, they're the funniest of
the funny.
The 40 comedians are divided
into two groups of 20. This week,
the first group will begin round one,
with each comedian performing a
five-minute skit for a different
group of judges every night except
Thursday. Next week, the second
group does the same.
The top 10 scorers from the two
weeks will then meet the week of
Aug. 19 for the semi-finals. The
competition concludes with the
finals on Labor Day Weekend (Aug.
30 - Sept. 1).
Former competition winners
include Dana Carvey, Jake
Johannsen, Dexter Madison and
Marsha Warfield. Robin Williams
was a contestant in the first compe

And this year promises to pro
duce some big names as well.
Among the competitors are local
comedians Steve Carey, Dan
Chopin, Jim Harris, Mickey Joseph,
Margaret Cho, and San Carlos
native Greg Proops, who has per
formed at Stanford during orienta
tion. In addition, Don McMillan —
a former Stanford student — will be
competing.
The competition will be held at
sites all around the Bay Area, rang
ing from the Punchline in San Fran
cisco and Walnut Creek to the Paul
Masson Winery in Saratoga. For the
first time in the competition's his
tory, two of the three final rounds
will be held outside San Francisco,
at the Masson Winery and the
Marin Civic Auditorium in San
Rafael, in addition to the Warfield
Theatre in the City.
Aside from being given a shot at
fame, the competitors have a shot at
fortune as well: The grand prize is
$10,000, plus enough bookings to
pay the rent for months to come.
And that's nothing to laugh at.

Tickets are available through the
individual locations. For more

Headquarters at 383-8394.
