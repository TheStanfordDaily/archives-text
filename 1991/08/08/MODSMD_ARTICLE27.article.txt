It's tough on the concert
scene these days. With most
concert-goers tightening their
economic belts and staying
home, ticket sales are down,
promoters are wary and bands
are having hard times booking
tours.
But for those of us who con
sider live music worthy of our
disposable income, there are
some huge concerts featuring
multiple bands joining forces to
combat audiences' restricted
budgets.
Now, instead of paying for
four separate concerts to see
groups like ZZ Top, Extreme,
Eric Johnson and the Steve
Miller Band, you can buy one
ticket and see them all. That's
exactly the opportunity that Bay
Area music fans will have Satur
day at San Jose State Univer
sity's Spartan Stadium.
The Texas band ZZ Top has
enjoyed gold and platinum lev
els of success with five LPs —
"La Grange," "Fandango,"
"Tejas," "Deguello" and "El
Loco." These albums included
such hits as "TUsh," "Arrested
While Driving Blind," "Legs"
and "Sharp Dressed Man." The
band — Billy Gibbons, Dusty
Hill, and Frank Beard — has
been together for 17 years
developing a loyal following for

its unique brand of rock 'n' roll.
Opening Saturday's show is
Extreme, a Boston rock band
that recently released its second
album, titled "Extreme II
Pornograffiti." The album fea
tures the No. 1 hit single "More
Than Words."
Guitarist Eric Johnson will
also be featured at Spartan Sta
dium. Johnson received a
Grammy award nomination for
the single "Zap," a cut from his
1986 debut album "Tones," and
was recently nominated a sec
ond time for his 1990 album "Ah
Via Musicom."

And there's more. The Steve
Miller Band will add its wealth
of musical talent to the San Jose
bill, playing its big hits "Fly Like
an Eagle,""The Joker," "Jungle
Love" and "Abracadabra." With
his 20-year Capitol Records
recording career, 18 albums and
star on the Hollywood walk of
fame, Miller alone should be
enough to make this concert a
must-see.

ZZ Top, Extreme, the Steve Miller
Band and Eric Johnson will be per
forming Saturday at San Jose State
University's Spartan Stadium.

Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill are the almost-identical members of
ZZ Top. Ironically, Frank Beard is the beardless one.
