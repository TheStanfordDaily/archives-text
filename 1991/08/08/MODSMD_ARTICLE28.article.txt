"Hot Shots," starring Charlie
Sheen, Lloyd Bridges and Cary
Elwes
With so many summer movies
out at one time, it's important to
be choosy about which ones to
catch and which ones to let go by.
Jim Abrahams' new film "Hot
Shots!" is truly one worth seeing.
When it comes out on video.
In the same vein as other spoof
movies Abrahams has made with
brothers David and Jerry Zucker
— "Kentucky Fried Movie," "Air
plane!" "Top Secret!" and"The
Naked Gun" "Hot Shots!" — is
aimed at every Air Force flyboy
movie made between Pearl Har
bor and the release of "Top Gun."
While the satire is as accurate
as in those other comedy block
busters, the pacing is off in Abra
hams' solo effort, reducing their
"laugh-a-minute" quality down to
a laugh every few minutes. This
film gives you time to breathe.
Sure, all the same wonderful
material is here. The soldiers use
fake code words, shouting "Alpha ...
Velveeta ... Knuckle ... Under

wear" over the radio. Lloyd
Bridges, who brought "I guess 1
picked the wrong week to quit sniff
ing glue" alive in "Airplane!" still
delivers lines like "What I wouldn't
give to be 20 years younger... and
a woman," with deadpan expertise.
Bridges, whose resume boasts
material ranging from "High
Noon" to "Cousins," plays a dete
riorating admiral on a comic level
that could teach a thing or two to
a cast still wet behind the ears.
Cary Elwes, so memorable as
Westley in"The Princess Bride,"
is disappointingly bland as the

egotistical Kent Gregory.
The crime of the film, though,
lies with star Charlie Sheen as a
pilot suffering from "Paternal
Conflict Syndrome," the inability
to leave his father's tarnished fly
ing record behind him.
The problem is that Sheen is
too good at making bad films to
make fun of himself. "Hot Shots!"
lacks the great straight man as
comic lead that "The Naked Gun"
found in Leslie Nielsen.
Why Abrahams decided to sit
out that film's sequel is a mystery.
Bat if you are looking for a quality

picture, you'd do better with "The
Naked Gun 2 »/*." Save "Hot
Shots!" until you see it at Block
buster Video. It won't be long.

" Thousand Pieces of Gold," starring
Rosalind Chao, Dennis Dun, Michael
Paul Chan and Chris Cooper
In Chinese custom, "thousand
pieces of gold" is a term of
endearment, especially between a
father and a daughter. But in the
film "Thousand Pieces of Gold,"
that term takes on a bitterly ironic
meaning when Lalu (Rosalind
Chao) is sold into slavery by her
father and shipped to America
There, she experiences the life of
a slave in a Western gold-mining
town before earning her freedom.
Although "Thousand Pieces of
Gold" doesn't have much action
or suspense, it holds one's interest
in a way that many recent movies
fail to — by being unpredictable.
Halfway through the movie, you
may find yourself wondering
exactly who the main characters
are.
The unfolding of events, writ
ten by Anne Makepeace and
remarkably directed by Nancy
Kelly, seems to lead in one direc
tion, but then inexplicably, yet
somehow logically, turns the other

way. This complexity makes the
movie undeniably interesting, yet
it may also cause frustration.
For example, at one point in
the movie, Lalu seems destined to
be the willing wife of Jim (Dennis
Dun). Jim arranges to purchase
her from Hong King, the
entrepreneurial Chinese man who
bought and enslaved her after she
refused to be a prostitute for him.
Hong King agrees to sell Lalu to
Jim, but two days later loses her to
Charlie, played by Chris Cooper
("City of Hope"), in a poker
game.
Months later when Jim, having
earned the money to buy Lalu,
returns to the village, he immedi
ately leaves after seeing that Lalu
now lives with Charlie. He never
reappears in the film.
But other aspects of the movie,
such as setting and costumes, are
quite impressive. The rough,
unrefined appearances of the
extras, as well as much of the
background action, enhance the
mood of the story.
While some of the plot twists in
"Thousand Pieces of Gold" are
unsettling, the inspiring story of a
Chinese slave girl who gains her
freedom and becomes a successful
wife and manager (of her own
boarding house) is enough to
make this a film well worth seeing.

Treasure chest
" Thousand Pieces of Gold," starring
Rosalind Chao, Dennis Dun, Michael
Paul Chan and Chris Cooper
In Chinese custom, "thousand
pieces of gold" is a term of
endearment, especially between a
father and a daughter. But in the
film "Thousand Pieces of Gold,"
that term takes on a bitterly ironic
meaning when Lalu (Rosalind
Chao) is sold into slavery by her
father and shipped to America
There, she experiences the life of
a slave in a Western gold-mining
town before earning her freedom.
Although "Thousand Pieces of
Gold" doesn't have much action
or suspense, it holds one's interest
in a way that many recent movies
fail to — by being unpredictable.
Halfway through the movie, you
may find yourself wondering
exactly who the main characters
are.
The unfolding of events, writ
ten by Anne Makepeace and
remarkably directed by Nancy
Kelly, seems to lead in one direc
tion, but then inexplicably, yet
somehow logically, turns the other

way. This complexity makes the
movie undeniably interesting, yet
it may also cause frustration.
For example, at one point in
the movie, Lalu seems destined to
be the willing wife of Jim (Dennis
Dun). Jim arranges to purchase
her from Hong King, the
entrepreneurial Chinese man who
bought and enslaved her after she
refused to be a prostitute for him.
Hong King agrees to sell Lalu to
Jim, but two days later loses her to
Charlie, played by Chris Cooper
("City of Hope"), in a poker
game.
Months later when Jim, having
earned the money to buy Lalu,
returns to the village, he immedi
ately leaves after seeing that Lalu
now lives with Charlie. He never
reappears in the film.
But other aspects of the movie,
such as setting and costumes, are
quite impressive. The rough,
unrefined appearances of the
extras, as well as much of the
background action, enhance the
mood of the story.
While some of the plot twists in
"Thousand Pieces of Gold" are
unsettling, the inspiring story of a
Chinese slave girl who gains her
freedom and becomes a successful
wife and manager (of her own
boarding house) is enough to
make this a film well worth seeing.
