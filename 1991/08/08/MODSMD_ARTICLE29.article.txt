Local cafes
• Cafe Borrone — Located in Menlo Park
on El Camino Real, Borrone is one of the
best in the area. Aside from great coffee,
scones, soup and sandwiches, Borrone has
location going for it — it's right next door
to Kepler's Bookstore.
• Cafe Verona — This downtown Palo Alto
cafe captures the essence of Europe per
fectly. With outdoor seating and servers
with Italian accents, Verona makes you feel
as though you've left the country.

• Saint Michael's Alley — Also located in

is small, dark and has a small selection of

cafe does have a wide selection of bands
playing frequently.

TV this week:
OK, so most of television seems to be
geared toward the brain-dead. And during
the summer, it's more like material for
brain-dead lab rats.
Then there's public television: bald
eagle specials, British comedy and endless
hours of pledge drives.
Until "The Civil War," the most-watched
series in PBS history, which begins reruns
tomorrow night at 9 p.m. on KQED. Enter
taining yet educational: what a concept.
Also of note is KTVU's Monday airing
of the 1988 movie "Madame Sousatzka,"
starring Shirley MacLaine as a master
piano teacher.
