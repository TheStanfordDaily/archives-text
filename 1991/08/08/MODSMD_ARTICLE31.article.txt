A significant trend appeared among the vari
ous films released last week; one so monumental,
so cosmic, so amazing, that we couldn't help but
use it for the topic of this week's Second-Choice
Videos.
"The Doctor." "Doc Hollywood." See what we
mean? And another film is called "Body Parts."
That's medical, isn't it?
In the chronicles of film history, many films
have had the word "Doctor" in the title, and some
of them are actually good enough to rent when
you can't find "Awakenings" — another doctor
film — this week.

• "Doctor Zhivago" — The Russian Revolution is
just the perfect setting for a romantic triangle, isn't
it? Omar Sharif stars as the doctor.
• "Dr. No" — James Bond films are always good
second choices, and this one was the first. Joseph
Wiseman is the doctor battling Sean Connery as
Bond.
• "Doctor Doolittle" — "Talk to the Animals"
with Rex Harrison as the doctor.
• "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" — A classic from
1932, this film stars Fredric March as the doctor
and the mister.
• "Doctor Detroit" — Dan Akroyd stars as the
doctor, who's actually a professor talked into
impersonating a criminal.
• "Dr. Strangelove: or How 1 Learned to Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb" — This one's reg
istered with the Library of Congress as a national
treasure. Peter Sellers is the doctor, as well as
numerous other characters.
