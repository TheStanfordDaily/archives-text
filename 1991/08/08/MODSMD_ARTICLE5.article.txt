## Column Computers and me 
### 
Oy gevalt! (Yiddish expres
sion of frustration and
despair).
What a drag it is to be clueless
about high-tech equipment in the
computer age. It all seems so con
fusing and pointless.
I really don't think computers
and I communicate very well. We
always seem to have a difference
of opinion about how to proceed
in a given situation. A sample sce
nario should illustrate the type of
computer problems I have:
I was in the process of writing a
lengthy term paper for my fresh
man English class two years ago. I
had been working very hard on
the project and it was finally near
ing completion. I was using a com
puter to record my thoughts for
future printing, and it was reas
suring to see my words embla
zoned upon a Macintosh screen; I
was feeling good about myself.
Ah, the sense of accomplishment
you feel when you are almost at
the end of an arduous task! Life
was good.
But, as we all know, things
often go wrong when we least
expect them to, and, to my utter
astonishment, disaster struck. To
this day, I am not exactly sure
what happened; everything went
by so quickly.
All I remember is that the
monitor I was using to pour out all
my literary ideas suddenly had a
major freak attack, got very blurry,
cried out what I can only describe
as a metallic scream and spewed
forth a barrage of strange little
numbers and symbols.
It soon became very apparent
to me that the situation was not
good. No, I had not saved my files
on a disk (although I did learn my
lesson thereafter). Indeed, at that
moment, life really sucked.
This was my first, but unfortu
nately not my last, experience with
a computer getting sick and pass
ing out on me. I could only stare
pathetically at the jumbled screen,
mouth agape. All my work was
lost.
The thing was, I really didn't
know what to do. I made a mental
list of my options. Do I start ran
domly tappity-tapping on the key
board in the desperate hope that I
will somehow push a button or
series of buttons that will set
everything straight?
Do I dismantle the computer in
order to discern any mechanical
difficulties the machine might be
suffering from? Do I tell the com
puter that I had put a great deal of
effort into the paper it just obliter
ated?
Do I beseech the nearest avail
able computer god-expert to come
to my aid? Do I scream and yell at
the computer?
Do I hit the computer the way
the Fonz hits the jukebox on
"Happy Days" in order to make it
work right? Or do I just give up,
turn the computer off and take a
study break?
I opted for the study break and
retyped the whole thing later.
I couldn't help but feel kind of
dumb telling off a machine. I
mean, it can't hear me. Or can it?
It won't respond to me. Or will it?
It doesn't have any feelings. Or
does it? It's just a silly, little
machine. An insignificant piece of
plastic and silicon! Or is it?
I don't know. Or should I?
People tell me that I am of the
computer generation. They are
probably right. By virtue of the
fact that I was born after 1965, I

should have some sort of knowl
edge ingrained in my psyche about
how to interact with computers on
a close, personal level. I should be
able to maintain a oneness of
spirit with these incredible
machines.
We should be able to under
stand each other completely — a
veritable symbiosis between bio
chemical and electromechanical
beings. Human and machine in
peaceful, mutually beneficial
coexistence: Bryan and Macintosh
working as one in perfect bliss and
harmony.
Well, I am under the impres
sion that I was born too late.
Maybe it would have been better
if I had been born in a simpler
time period — perhaps 50,000
years ago, or something like that.
Back then, people did not rely on
machines, let alone computers, to
fulfill their every need.
There was no dependence on a
non-human device that does
things for you. No automated
electronics to break down on you
when you needed them most.
Everything you did was a result of
your own efforts.
Yes, it was all very plain and
straightforward during that era, of
which I should have been part. If
you wanted to go somewhere, you
used the most reliable form of
transportation there was — your
feet. If you wanted to eat some
thing, you went out and got it from
the land, without being entirely
dependent on anyone or anything
to get it for you. If you wanted to
write something down, you used
chalk rocks and the ground, not a
Macintosh SE, or even an IBM.
But this is 1991. My options
today are limited to accepting
computers as they are or exiling
myself to a desert island and
becoming a hermit.
To tell you the truth, it's not
really all that bad to live in a world
of computers. I have a feeling
that, like it or not, I will be around
computers for the rest of my life.
In fact, they will probably enter
into almost every facet of my
future existence, from home life
to occupation (whatever those
may be). That's cool. I can deal. I
mean, far be it from me to stand in
the way of technological progress.
But for now, I have established
a truce with computers. Since you
are reading this right now, I will
assume that none of the comput
ers in the vast array of machines
needed to get this column on The
Daily pages went berserk. I thank
the computers and the engineers
who designed them for that. But I
still think it would behoove me to
take Computer Science 1C next
year.
