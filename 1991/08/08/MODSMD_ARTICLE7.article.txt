## Boy Scouts need a lesson in tolerance 
### 
It's time for the Boy Scouts to
go out in the woods and do
some serious thinking.
The United Way recently
decided to rescind $9000 of its
funding for Scout activity in the
Bay Area, because the Boy Scouts
discriminate against gays, main
taining a policy which prohibits
homosexuals from becoming
Scout leaders.
Acting well within its bounds,
United Way announced that the
scouts would have to go exploring
for other sources of funding until
they reconsidered their discrimi
natory policy.
The Boy Scouts claim that, as a
private organization, it is their
right to exclude whomever they
choose — on the basis of gender,
religion or sexual preference. But
the Scouts may want to consider
the message that they are sending
to a generation of American
youth.
For the Scouts' anti-gay policy
legitimates a stereotype: that gay
men do not make good role mod
els.
That policy ignores the contri
butions that gay men have made
in the public and private sectors,

discounts their ability as leaders
and assumes that their sexual ori
entation precludes their having
any other desirable virtues.
Scouts could learn a number of
lessons from having a scout leader
who is gay.
They might come to under
stand, for example, the falsity of a
number of stereotypes about gay
men. Learning this, they might
even come to doubt other stereo
types and characterizations of
groups.
The Scouts could learn lessons
which they might go on to use in
their lives, in their relationships
with their peers, and in coming to
terms with their own sexuality.
They might also learn how to
build fires, read a compass and
make S'mores — lessons a gay
scout leader is every bit as able,
and as willing, to teach.
The Boy Scouts' policy is also
founded on, and supported by, a
ridiculous and sinister stereotype:
that gay men cannot help being
attracted to young boys.
This characterization of gays as
oversexed, as automatically
attracted to other men and boys,
is blatantly unfair, another stereo

type whose falsity Boy Scouts
might have the opportunity to
learn, were their present leader
ship a little more visionary.
In clinging to such notions, the
Boy Scouts also ignore a recog
nized statistical fact: that hetero
sexual men are much more likely
than homosexual men to be
molesters of children.
They are ignoring another
thing, too, which is the resource
available to them in a group of
men whose leadership abilities
society has largely, by virtue of
unfounded prejudice, failed to
tap.
And while they're sitting
around that campfire, the scouts
might also want to consider
whether some of their other dis
criminatory policies are really
sending an appropriate message
to youth about living with those
who believe and act differently
from themselves.
If the Scouts want young boys
to "be prepared" for life in today's
society, they may want to begin
teaching them a novel and impor
tant lesson: one of tolerance and
open-mindedness.
