# Turning off lights saves money and fuel
## 
### 
If a tree falls in the woods and
no one is around to hear it,
does it make any noise? I don't
know.
If you turn the lights on and
then leave the room, do they still
use electricity? Yes. How do I
know? I just got my electrical bill.
Most of us at Stanford lose sight
of the fact that electricity is expen
sive because of the way that dor
mitories are set up — we never
have to pay a power bill. Well,
here's the truth: Electricity costs
money and producing it is gener
ally bad for the environment.
There are a couple of little
things you can do to cut electricity
use and thus help curb the warm
ing of the planet and the deple
tion of fossil fuels. Additionally,
the energy you conserve will help
ease the financial burdens on both
you and the University.
First, when you leave a room,
turn off the light. Remember

when you were a little kid, and
someone told you that it took
more electricity to turn lights back
on than to just leave them that
way? Brace yourself: They lied to
you. TUrning off the lights makes
sense.
Second, don't overlight a room.
There is really no need to have
several lights on in one room.
If you don't mind spending a
little money now to save money
later, you can replace some of
your normal light bulbs with com
pact fluorescent lights. Compact
fluorescent lights are fluorescent
lights (like the tubes) that can be
screwed into incandescent (stan
dard household) fixtures.
Compact, fluorescent lights

provide the same quality of light
as bulbs do. While they do cost
more ($l5-$25 each), they use less
energy than a normal bulb and
last 10 times longer. This means
that in the long run, the money
you save on your electric bill will
pay for the extra cost of the light.
Every compact fluorescent
light bulb that you use in place of
an incandescent bulb will save the
electrical equivalent of 770
pounds of coal and keep 1,600
pounds of carbon dioxide (the
major greenhouse gas) and 18
pounds of sulfur dioxide (a pri
mary cause of acid rain) out of the
atmosphere.
Conserving electricity isn't
about sitting in the dark. It's
about using energy wisely and effi
ciently. If you do that, you can
make a big difference.
