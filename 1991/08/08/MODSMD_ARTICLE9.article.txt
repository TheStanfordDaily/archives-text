# Audit denies SLAC charge
## Newslines 
### 
The University released an
internal audit report Monday
rejecting claims by a former
employee that SLAC officials fal
sified estimates of earthquake
damage and misused government
funds.
The report comes as a House
subcommittee and the Depart
ment of Energy, which owns the
facility, are continuing to look into
the case.
Tim Axe, who worked in the
facilities department of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
has claimed that he was fired for
refusing to "pad his estimate" of
damage from the 1989 Loma Pri
eta Earthquake.
SLAC director Burton Richter
denied that the facility committed
fraud and that Axe was fired in
retaliation for not falsifying his
estimate.
Axe was fired "for just cause
unrelated to the earthquake,"
Richter said. He would not specify
the exact reason for Axe's termi
nation.
The Energy, Environment and
Natural Resources Subcommittee
of the House Government Opera-

tions committee
is currently mak
ing a preliminary
examination of
the charges and
Stanford's response
"to determine if
there is something
we should look
into," said an inves
tigator who spoke

on condition of anonymity.
A decision as to whether to
pursue a full investigation will be
made during the next few months.
"We are just starting to look" at
the evidence and don't know what
all the numbers mean, the investi
gator said.
Sources said one of the sub
committee staff members examin
ing the case was also a principal
investigator for Michigan Demo
crat John Dingell's Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations,
which has been probing Stanford's
indirect costs of research.
SLAC director Burton Richter
said he told the staff director of
the subcommittee Monday that
the facility would cooperate fully
with any investigation. "The ball is
in their court,"he added.
Richter said the Energy
Department has also received
Stanford's internal audit and is
considering whether any further
action is required.
Axe could not be reached for
comment yesterday. But according
to the internal audit, he made two
specific charges.
First, he claimed that he and
another employee were asked, as
a team, to provide "a detailed esti
mate that would support a previ
ous estimate by their supervisor."
Axe also charged that some of
the items placed in repair cost
estimates were not in fact related
to the earthquake. He cites sev
eral instances of damage that
occurred before the earthquake,
according to the audit.
But Axe's supervisor and the
other employee have disputed his
first claim. They say the supervi
sor asked the two employees to
prepare separate estimates.
Richter said the supervisor
simply decided to take the esti
mate of the other employee, who
was more experienced.
According to the internal audit,
"No knowingly incorrect factual
information was used to obtain
additional funding ... for the
repair of earthquake damage to
facilities."
Richter also noted that Axe did
not bring up his complaint until

last December — 10 months after
the estimate was made.
In response to Axe's second
claim, Richter said the Depart
ment of Energy funding was ear
marked for two purposes — earth
quake repair and enhancing the
operations of the facility.
The allocation was left to the
discretion of SLAC officials. As a
result, "there are no grounds for
considering a misappropriation of
funds," the internal audit states.
Although the internal audit
said officials should not pursue
Axe's allegations further, it did
suggest revised ways of handling
emergency repair costs.
Following one of these sugges
tions, SLAC will set up a special
account from which to pay for all
emergency repairs. This should
make it easier to monitor exactly
what is spent, said Reed Brimhall,
director of the internal audit.
Richter said that after the
earthquake he told other officials
to begin fixing the damage imme
diately without setting up special
accounts for the repairs. As a
result, funds were spent from
many different accounts, and in
some cases it was difficult to track
down individual items.
