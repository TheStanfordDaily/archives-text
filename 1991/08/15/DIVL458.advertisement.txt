After you're done with
school, you face one of
the hardest lessons in life:
Without experience, it's
tough to get a job. And with
out a job, it's tough to get
experience.
At The Wall Street
Journal, we recognize that experi
ence is something you don't start
earning until after graduation.
But while you're waiting, we can
give you a head start by providing some
of the same competitive advantages that
experience brings.
For instance, our wide-ranging news
coverage gives you a clearer under
standing of the whole complex world of
business.
Our tightly focused feature report
ing prepares you for your more specific
ambitions - whether in management,
accounting, finance, technology, market
ing or small business.
And our in-depth analysis helps you
formulate your ideas in a sharper and
more persuasive way.
Mail the coupon - and start
your subscription to The Wall
Street Journal at student savings
of up to $64.50 off the regular
subscription price.
That's a pretty generous
offer. Especially when you con
sider what it actually represents.
Tuition for the real world.
