Perhaps We Can Help
If you suffer from severe stress, anxiety, or feel nervous most of the time, you may be
interested in participating in a combined STANFORD UNIVERSITY & ADMINISTRATION
research study investigating the usefulness of a new medication for the treatment of
anxiety. If you are 18-65, and are diagnosed as having generalized anxiety disorder, or we
find that you have generalized anxiety disorder, you may be eligible to participate in our
study. If you are pregnant or have certain medical conditions, you will not be eligible to
participate. Free medical evaluation and medical care will be provided.
If you think you may be eligible, or would just like more information about the study,
