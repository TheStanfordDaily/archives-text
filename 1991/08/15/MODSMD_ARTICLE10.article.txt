## Spence to punish lecturer 
### 
Business School Dean A.
Michael Spence has decided to
take disciplinary action against a
lecturer who failed to properly
credit parts of a book taken from
another article.
Richard Pascale, a part-time
lecturer at the Graduate School
of Business, admitted last month
that parts of his 1990 book,
"Managing on the Edge" were
lifted from a 1986 Washington
Monthly article by Gregg
Easterbrook, a correspondent for
Newsweek and Atlantic
magazines.
Excerpts from the book also
appeared in the September 1990
Stanford Business School
Magazine.
In a statement, Spence wrote,
"It is clear from the similarity in
the . . . passages . . . that the
footnotes in Mr. Pascale's book
do not give adequate or
appropriate credit to Mr.
Easterbrook."
Pascale should have placed
the material within quotation
marks or somehow indicated
"with precision what text and
content was taken from another's
work," Spence wrote.
"In view of these conclusions,
I have determined that sanctions
are appropriate," Spence wrote.
He would not specify what form
the punishment would take,
because Pascale can still appeal
the action.
Pascale was out of town
yesterday and could not be
reached for comment. In a
prepared statement, he said, "I
do not believe that sanctions are
called for."
He wrote that he had taken
appropriate action by apologizing
to Easterbrook and agreeing to
make changes in future versions
of the book.
Spence also wrote, "I extend
to Mr. Easterbrook my sincere
apology on behalf of the
magazine and the school" for the
publishing of the article in the
Business School magazine.
In an interview, Easterbrook
said he accepted Spence's
"gracious" apology and bears no
ill will toward Stanford.
Easterbrook has asked Pascale
for monetary damages and said
he had hoped the issue could be
handled amicably. But it is now
"more likely that there will be
litigation," and he will probably
hire a lawyer within a few days,
he said.
He has also reduced his
original demand for damages to
about $15,000.
Stanford could be a target of a
potential copyright infringement
lawsuit because of the magazine
article, but Easterbrook said he
has "no desire to embroil
Stanford in a suit."
He has not asked Stanford for
any monetary settlement.
Easterbrook said he has
decided to pursue the case
because Pascale recently
attacked his professional
reputation. He said Pascale's
lawyers approached Newsweek
executives about two weeks ago
and accused him of being an
"unethical journalist" for writing
a Newsweek article about this
and other cases of unauthorized
copying.
The article was written at
Newsweek's invitation, was
factually accurate and "fairer and
gentler than what others have
written about him," Easterbrook
said.
