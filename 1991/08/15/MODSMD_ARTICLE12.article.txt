# Cost review pushed back
## 
### 
Negotiators from Stanford and
the Office of Naval Research had
planned to meet next week to re
evaluate the 55.5 percent
indirect-cost rate imposed on the
University in April.
But there's been a change of
plans, according to Peter Van
Etten, the University's chief

financial officer.
Stanford and
the Navy have
now agreed to
continue using
the 55.5 percent
billing rate for
the remainder of
the University's
fiscal year, Van
Etten said. The

two parties will then meet
sometime after February to
determine a final indirect-cost
rate for 1991.
If Stanford and the Navy agree
upon a final rate that is higher
than 55.5 percent, the difference
will he made up by increasing the
rate the University charges the
government in future years. Van
Etten said he expects the final
rate for 1991 to be "significantly
higher" than 55.5 percent.
Indirect costs are those
expenses, such as utilities and
maintenance, necessary for
conducting federal research but
not easily attributable to a single
project. A university's indirect
cost rate is a ratio of these
expenses to the "direct costs" of
the research.
Stanford originally proposed
an indirect-cost rate of 78
percent for 1991. During the
course of multiple federal
investigations of the University's
billing practices, the rate was
bumped down to 70 percent.
In April, the Navy then said it
could no longer rely on the cost
formulas Stanford was using to
calculate its expenses and imposed
an indirect-cost rate of 55.5
percent. The move, which was
accompanied by the termination
of close to 100 accounting
agreements, cost the University
about $28 million this year.
University officials are hoping
to recoup some of that loss when
the final rate for 1991 is
determined. Under the previous

plan, the rate would have been re
evaluated next week and adjusted
for the current year. Now the
parties have agreed to apply any
difference to future years.
Separately, the Navy has
determined that Stanford can
continue to use the only
accounting agreement it did not
terminate in April.
That agreement, which deals
with how the University charges
the government for tuition of
graduate students conducting
research, is currently under
review by the Office of
Management and Budget, the
federal agency that formulates
regulations on indirect costs.
• Van Etten said he was "very
pleased" by the Navy's decision.
