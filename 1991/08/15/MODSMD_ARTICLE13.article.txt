### 
North America will be well
represented at Stanford's Cen
tennial Celebration this fall, as
Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney has been selected to

deliver the key
note speech at
the first of the
three Centennial
Finale Weekend
Convocations.
Mulroney
joins Mexican
President Carlos
Salinas de
Gortiari on the

list of speakers. Mulroney is
scheduled to speak Sunday, Sept.
29; Salinas will give his address
the following day.
No keynote speaker has been
chosen for the final day of the

convocations, ac
cording to Susan
Wolfe, assistant
director of public
affairs for the
celebration.
However, rum
ors have circu
lated that Presi
dent Bush may be
the third speaker.

When asked if Bush would be
making a guest appearance at the
celebration, Wolfe said, "I really
can't say. All I can confirm is
Mulroney is speaking and Salinas
is speaking. That's it."
