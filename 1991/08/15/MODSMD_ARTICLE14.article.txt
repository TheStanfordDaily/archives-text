# Demolitions could be costly
## 
### 
Stanford could lose more than
$200,000 in federal money if it
pursues its current plan to
demolish the Synergy and Delta
Tau Delta houses this month.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency grants, which
were awarded to the University for
repairs or replacement of damaged
student residences following the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, face
two threats.
First, the grants may be
terminated if the State
Historical Preservation Office
determines that the turn-of-the
century buildings are historically
or architecturally significant.
The federal agency routinely
allows the preservation office to
review, amend and possibly
refuse grants for work that will
affect historically significant
structures.
The office is expected to
review the grants for replacing
Synergy and the Delt house
within the next week.
The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors this month
overturned a recommendation
that the houses be designated
state points of historic interest.
Second, the federal agency
may not allow the grant money to
be used for what is known as an
"alternate project" — such as
building condominiums or faculty
homes on the site instead of
repairing the old houses. The
University plans to use the money
raised from the faculty housing to
construct more student resi
dences elsewhere on campus.
University and federal officials
will meet Aug. 21 to negotiate
whether Stanford's plan for the
site constitutes an acceptable
alternate project.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency grants
money for the repair and
replacement of buildings
damaged in disasters like the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The University hopes to receive
as much as $50 million in these
federal grants to repair and
replace earthquake-damaged
campus property, said Director
of Facilities Project Management
Curt Williams.
