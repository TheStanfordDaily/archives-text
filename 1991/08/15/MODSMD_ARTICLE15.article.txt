# USW, Stanford have far to go
## 
### 
University and USW
representatives have a long row
to hoe before they reach middle
ground in the ongoing contract
negotiations — and it is
questionable whether a bargain
can be struck before the current
contract expires Sept. 1.
Representatives from both
sides agree that progress has
been made in the monthlong
process. But progress has been
slowed by the teams' different
negotiating strategies.
According to United Stanford
Workers' chief negotiator
Michael Tatham, the University
team has ignored a number of
issues important to workers,
including pay equity and
improved pension and health
care plans. .
"We're very concerned that the
University hasn't put all their
proposals on the table," Tatham
said. "They'd better start moving
before the Centennial," he added.
But according to chief
University negotiator Michael
Vartain, his team hasn't ignored
those concerns.
Unlike the USW negotiators,
the University team has
categorized negotiable issues as
economic and non-economic.
The University team won't
discuss economic issues until the
non-economic ones are resolved.
Both sides declined to say
where they have reached
concord. Job security, which falls
into the non-economic category,
is a point of contention.
If negotiators fail to reach
agreement before Sept. 1, a
strike during the Centennial
Celebration is a possibility. "It's
going to be very hard to work
without a contract," Tatham said.
