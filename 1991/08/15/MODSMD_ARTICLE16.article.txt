# Rosse plans return today
## 
### 
Provost James Rosse was
hospitalized last week for a
severe strep infection while on
vacation in Nebraska but expects
to return to campus today.
In a telephone interview
yesterday, Rosse said he has been
feeling "quite well" for the past
several days and does not expect
there will be any lasting effects
from the illness. He will probably
return to his office Monday and
work half-days for at least one
week.
Rosse said he probably got the
infection through an open sore
on his left foot. It's a case of
"old-fashioned blood poisoning
that went like lightning through
my body," he said.
By the time he entered
Methodist Hospital in Omaha
last Thursday, the infection had
affected his heart and lungs, and
he had to spend four days in
intensive care while those
problems were cleared up.
Rosse said the condition is not
related to his diabetes.
Doctors are currently giving
him intravenous antibiotics to
"make sure that all the bacteria
are gone," he said. The kind of
bacteria that infected his leg
could not be exterminated with
pills or shots, he added.
Rosse had gone to Nebraska
for his parents' 60th wedding
anniversary and other family
events.
