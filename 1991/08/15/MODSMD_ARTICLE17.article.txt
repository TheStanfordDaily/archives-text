Ted Leland
still hasn't
gotten
settled in.
Six weeks into his
tenure as Stanford's
athletic director,
Leland hasn't had
much time to
decorate his corner
office. Two empty
picture hooks hang
on the wall next to
his desk.
The only real
decoration adorning
the place is a
burlwood clock,
which Leland doesn't
think much of. He's
even offered
inquisitive visitors
the opportunity to
take it with them on
their way out.
"I'm trying to spend as much time
as I can listening to people right now,"
Leland says. "It's a very complicated
program, so it's going to take me a
while to get acclimated."
To make matters worse, he hasn't
yet gotten his family down to the area.
They're still up in Stockton, near the
University of the Pacific, where
Leland last worked before making his
return to the Farm.
But he has had time to form some
impressions, especially in regard to the
differences between Stanford, Pacific
and Dartmouth — another stop on the
peripatetic Leland's long journey.
"The difference between here and
Dartmouth is the emphasis on
national excellence," he says. "At
Dartmouth, we tried to be very good
in the Ivy League and occasionally we
were good nationally. Here, there's an

imperative to be good nationally —
that's your starting point."
Versus Pacific, Leland says
Stanford provides the challenge of
magnitude. After working with a staff
of under 50 at UOP, Leland now has
over 150 people to oversee. He'll
readily admit he doesn't yet know
everyone in the department.
Ideally, Leland could take the next
six months to do nothing more than
figure out what's going on. Real
istically, that's impossible. After Andy
Geiger's departure from the post last
October, senior associate athletic

Even before settling in
to his new job as
Stanford's athletic
director, Ted Leland
has had to face serious
problems.

director Alan Cummings filled the top
spot on an interim basis.
With no real desire to take over
permanently, Cummings chose to steer
the ship capably without really plotting
a new course. That would be up to the
new man.
And right now that new man has to
find a way out of some pretty muddy
waters. The Department of Athletics
has been living beyond its means for
several years. Leland estimates that
spending has outstripped revenues by
an average of $300,000 to $400,000 for
several years now, resulting in an

accumulated debt of $2.1 million.
"In one sense, the deficit is a very
big problem because it's just not good
practice to have this debt hanging over
us," Leland says. "On the other hand,
it's a $2.1-million accumulated debt
versus a $60-million endowment . . .
We're certainly not ready to run up
the bankruptcy flag.
"It's a critical issue and one we
intend to solve, but it's certainly not
catastrophic."
For the 1990-91 year, the deficit is
projected at a frightening $700,000.
But the tide will turn in '91-92. Thanks
in large part to a dream home football
schedule, which includes Notre Dame
and California among its seven games,
Leland is projecting a surplus of $1
million for the coming year.
But make no mistake, the plan being
worked won't be based solely on the
vicissitudes of the scheduling. Leland
wants to get the economic house in
order — and seems prepared to make
hard choices to do just that. Program
and staff cuts remain on the table.
"I think we're in a university
environment right now where a lot of
people are going to be cutting,"
Leland says. "There's not going to be
much sympathy in the faculty and
administration if we're cutting
academic programs while athletics
continues to run a deficit."
Leland admits he is short on
specifics at this time. Asked whether
some sports are in danger, he says:
"That's really hard, it's way too early
to tell. I think one of the things you
want to avoid, when you have a
program that's producing as well as
ours both in terms of excellence and
broad participation, is to panic and
make month-to-month and even year
to-year decisions. You've got to spend
some time and plan."
The fact remains, though, that
when the planning is all said and done,
there is likely to be a reshuffling of the
status of several sports. When the
magnitude of the crisis became
apparent in the spring of 1990, the
result was the creation of a three
tiered varsity sports system.
Football, basketball and tennis,
among others, will forever have
Varsity I status, which guaran
tees full funding and administrative
support. Synchronized swimming,
wrestling and such, fall into the
Varsity 111 classification, receiving
little, if any, funding. What they do get
is enough papers pushed to allow them
to compete as full-fledged NCAA
sports.
The tri-layered system was a
masterstroke of Geiger in the sense
that it prevented the demotion of
sports to the club level, which would

have jeopardized standing
with the NCAA. As a
matter of fact, it created
the remarkable situation
Of increasing the number
of sports technically
classified as varsity at a
time when everyone
assumed there would be a
decrease.
Leland likes the model.
"I think keeping as many
varsity sports as you can is
one of the highest cri
teria," he says."The
amount of administrative
services you're able to give
those teams, the amount
of money you're able to
give those teams, the
amount of coaches you're
able to give those teams
may vary.
"Here, you have some
varsity programs that
receive very little uni
versity funding. To me
that's a very attractive
model — certainly better
than the alternative, which
is dropping them."

Another potential pitfall is making
marginal cuts in all programs, thereby
degrading everyone's ability to be
successful. Leland knows it will be
tough balancing that against the
possibility of eliminating a sport
altogether. "If it was real easy [to solve
the problem], we would've done it long
ago," he says.

Still, he will seize the opportunity.
"We're in an environment right now
on campus when people realize we
have to trim," Leland explains. "If
we're ever going to get the ship
uprighted, now's the time to do it."
Especially while the honeymoon is
still in full swing. Boosters are giving
the kid a chance to flourish and
offering their help. "The biggest
surprise I've had has been the amount
of alumni interest and the quality of
that interest," he says. "It's really
incredible how many Stanford people
are interested in this program and
willing to commit time and money to
it."
Leland knows that raising money
for deficits is a tricky proposition.
"F'eople have very little interest in
paying for pieces of paper and athletic
trips you've already taken," he says.
"They want to make things better."
Ty°k Whitfield throws a devastating
block that flattens two defensive
JLJ lineman. Glyn Milburn, who has
just taken an inside handoff from Jason
Palumbis, explodes through the area
where, a split-second earlier, Whitfield
had done his demolition.
Milburn is quickly into the secondary
and beyond. There's nothing but green
field between him and the end zone.
Another easy score for the Heisman
Trophy candidate and another easy win
for the Cardinal. That should sew up the
bowl bid...
A far-fetched scenario? Maybe not.
Coach Dennis Green is entering his
third year as Stanford football's head
man and there are reasons for
optimism.
"I've worked with Dennis Green
before," Leland says,"and I've found
him to be very reasonable in his
assessments — and he's excited.
"There are some coaches who come
out every year and feel compelled, for
certain reasons, to declare they're
going to win the national
championship. You learn not to
believe those people after a while.
Dennis certainly isn't like that."
Green is committed to winning and
Leland believes that this year can be

the first of many successful
ones, i.e. winning records.
"I think we're going to have
a good football team every
year — we've done it
before," he says.
"With our admissions
standards, we have to do
everything right to be
successful in football,"
Leland says, restating the
well-known reality that
Stanford recruits from a
small pool of those who can
play as well as pass muster
with the Office of Under
graduate Admissions.
"I think our admissions
standards for athletes are a
positive for us overall, but it
does cost us some athletes
that end up playing against
us."
So where's the positive?
"We can recruit nation
ally," Leland says. "We can
go back in the Midwest and
East and recruit some
students who are great
athletes and excellent
students. They'll pass up a
lot of great schools to come
here because of our image,
because they come to
Stanford tfrul get stamped
on their forehead tor the
rest of their lives the idea
that they are able to
combine both the academic
and athletic worlds.'
Leland relates a story
from his days as an
assistant coach here in the
late '70s. Brian Holloway,
who would go on to an All-
Pro career with the New
England Patriots, passed
up countless offers to come
to Stanford. "Everybody in
the world wanted him,
Leland recalls. "He was so
obviously a great athlete in
high school. He was state
discus champ, played
basketball, was 6-foot-7,

and a great prospect on the offensive
line.
"He was attracted by the Stanford
image. USC, UCLA, other people with
just as good football programs couldn't
get through the front door with the
guy because of that image."
These days, that image is tainted
by charges of ripping off govern
ment dollars, sexism at the
Medical School and the like. Leland
says that doesn't mean much to
prospective student-athletes.
"When I worked here before, we
were the hot school in the country," he
says. "We're still there. Sure, there's
been a little bit of a brush. From what
I'm hearing from the coaches when

they go to talk to recruits, indirect-cost
recovery's not on the tip of everybody's
tongue."
And, the truth is, Green has had a
top-20 class nationally in each of his
recruiting years. But so far there have
been thrilling moments — Notre
Dame and Cal in 1990 — and more
losing seasons.
The braintrust believes this year
could be the breakthrough. From
there, Leland thinks it's going to get
even better. "Can we be in contention
year in, year out for the Rose Bowl?
Yeah, that's a reasonable goal for
Stanford.
"Nobody but a fool would say they
have to go to the Rose Bowl every year
to be successful, but I think we'd like to

play, in the latter part of the season,
for a chance to go — to have that game
where if you win you're in the driver's
seat. That's a reasonable goal for us."
If Stanford can even come close, a
lot of ills would be cured. Football
contributes $7-8 million of the $24
million Athletics Department budget.
If attendance, which waned a great
deal in the '80s, begins to wax in the
'90s, the debt could be nothing more
than a bad memory by mid-decade.
It would be yet another success
story for the pairing of Leland and
Green, who twice have done it before.
First they hooked up here when a
fellow named Bill Walsh presided over
the last glory era in Cardinal football.
Green worked as a backfield coach,

Leland with the linebackers.
The two met up again at
Northwestern, with Leland as an
assistant athletic director and Green
as the turnaround magician — a
similar situation to the one at
Stanford. Green helped the Wildcats
end what was then the longest losing
streak in Division I college football
history and earned Big Ten Coach of
the Year honors.
While Green denies taking an
active role in bringing Leland back to
Stanford, the new athletic director
does say, "Dennis was one of the
reasons I found the job attractive."
But if the Ted and Denny show is
a hit, won't Green be off to
bigger and better things? "I
think Dennis will stay here as long as
he believes we have a chance to be
successful," Leland says.
"If you see the number of times he's
come back to Stanford, if you've heard
him talk about having the best of both
worlds — great athletics and great
academics — I think that's important
to him.
"You never know what's going to
happen in the future," Leland adds.
"But I don't feel from him that he's
looking for the next NFL job."
For his own part, Green concurs,
noting, "If that's what I wanted, I
would've stayed in the NFL and been
on offensive coordinator."
Green says he will stay around as
long as success on the field is possible
and as long as he has the support to
make success possible. The re
lationship between Green and Leland
should help to guarantee that remains
the case.
They do, of course, need one
another. While Leland tops the
organizational chart, Green is, to some
extent, the boss. "Does the football
coach work for me? Really?" Leland
says. "It's a lot like when you've got
your sales manager and your top
salesman. Who works for who?
"With a lot of our coaches, their
success is my success. We've got to be
able to work together." And that's what
they plan to do.
If Green gets what he needs from
Leland and puts a winner on the field,
Leland can get from Green the
revenue he must have to put the
house in order. Whether it will all
come together will only be known in
time. But the '91 season should
provide some clues. Signs that its
working out will include fewer empty
seats at Stanford Stadium and more
"W's" on the ledger. Maybe even that
bowl bid.
In the meantime, maybe Ted's old
pal Denny can get him a poster to
hang on one of those empty walls. A
photograph of a single rose might do
the trick.


More scenes like this
one, with filled bleachers
at a Saturday football
game, would go a long
way toward alleviating the
Athletics Department's
budget woes.

Keeping the Axe is all
well and good, but
having a winning season
would be even better.
Ted Leland believes Big
Game can have Rose
Bowl implications for
Stanford In the not-too
distant future.


Ted Leland has only been on the job for
six weeks, but already he has big plans.
Foremost among them is retiring the
Athletics Department's $2.1-million debt
without compromising success on the
playing field. Coming off stints at
Dartmouth and University of the Pacific,
Leland is impressed by both the size of
the department here and the imperative
to succeed on a national level.
