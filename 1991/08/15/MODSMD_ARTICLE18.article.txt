## Tennis exodus: Graham, Stark and Palmer turn pro 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It always seemed the dynasty
would come to an end on the
court. Somehow, someday,
someone would defeat the
Stanford women's tennis team at
the NCAA Championships and
end the sport's most remarkable
string of national titles.
Instead, the Cardinal women
have been presented with their

biggest challenge by a not
altogether-unexpected decision
made this week: Debbie Graham
has renounced her final year of
eligibility and decided to turn
professional.
The senior-to-be has had a
phenomenal summer, rocketing
to No. 52 in the world.
Last Thursday, she was
eliminated from the Player's Ltd.
Challenge in Toronto one step
short of the quarterfinals. Amy

Frazier, ranked 19th in the word,
defeated Graham, 6-3,1-6, 6-1.
This week she is in action at
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles
and has already reached the third
round by crushing Holland's
Petra Kamstra yesterday, 6-1, 6-
0. In the first round, Graham
knocked off American Susan
Sloane 6-1, 2-1 (retired).
Men's coach Dick Gould
could be in even more dire straits
than women's coach Frank

Brennan. Juniors Jonathan Stark
and Jared Palmer are apparently
both headed onto the pro circuit.
Stark played in the U.S.
Hardcourts at Indianapolis
Monday but lost to Aaron
Krickstein, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. He and
Palmer teamed up Tuesday to
win a doubles match over sixth
seeded Guy Forget and Jakob
Hlasek, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2).
Teammate Alex O'Brien, who
is expected back for his senior

season, won a first-round match
at the Volvo International in
New Haven, Conn., downing
Johan Kriek, 7-5, 6-2. He lost
yesterday to Derrick Rostagno,
the ninth seed.
Amy Chiminello, who joins the
women's team next season, has
advanced to the finals of the U.S.
National Amateur Tennis
Championships in Kiamesha
Lake, N.Y. Chiminello faces Kristi
Meola for the singles crown.
