## Let it begin — again 
### 
Renewal. When the cobwebs
and dust are brushed
aside, a little polish is
applied and the effects of time
arc nothing but a memory.
In sport, renewal comes each
year when the season begins
anew, washing away the
disappointments of last year. It
also arrives in the form of new
talents who display a love for the
game and inspire us with their
great performances.
John Daly and Wilson Alvarez
brought renewal to golf and
baseball, respectively, this past
week.
Heading into the PGA
Championship, everyone was
muttering about how golfs final
major tournament of the year was
invariably a yawner. "Sit back,
relax and watch the pros shoot
high scores because the Crooked
Stick course is really, really long."
Enter Daly, who crushes golf
balls the way Mickey Mantle once
bashed the horsehide. Six
hundred-yard par 5s don't seem
so menacing when you average
303 with your driver.
While Nick Faldo pulled out
his 4-iron to approach the green,
Daly was asking "Squeaky," his
caddy, for an 8. As any duffer can
tell you: the shorter the club, the
more likely the chance for
success.
After seizing the lead during
the second round, Daly played
"Catch me if you can" with the
rest of the field and all they could
do — Faldo, Kenny Knox, Jack
Nicklaus — was shrug their
shoulders and watch in
wonderment.
The best part of the Daly story
is that he wasn't supposed to be in
the field. Selected as the ninth
alternate, he had to drive all night
to reach Crooked Stick on time.
He'd never won a PGA event
before. As a matter of fact, he's
played in very few, honing his
game on the lesser Ben Hogan
Tour and hoping for a break.
Now he's such a celeb that he'll
get to kick an extra point for the
Indianapolis Colts on Saturday if
he fails to make the cut at The
International this weekend. Says
it's a lifelong dream of his. Likely,
though, he'd trade in a chance to
kick a thousand field goals for the
magic of last weekend.
Alvarez is also an overnight
success — of sorts. He
made his major-league
debut two years ago and failed to
record a single out. Tony
Fernandez, the former Toronto
shortstop, homered off Alvarez
that day and said he felt guilty
about it.

Fernandez was worried that he
caused the demotion of a fellow
Latin player and that he didn't
know if Alvarez would ever get
another chance.
Sunday he got that chance and
certainly made the most of it by
tossing a no-hitter. As followers
of this space know, no-hitters
aren't as rare as they used to be
but, hey, the odds are still 666-to
-1 against (Could it be ... Satan?).
The chances of a rookie
throwing a no-no? How about
7,454-to-l. That qualifies as
special in this book.
Other no-hit rookies have gone
on to nowhere. Bobo Holloman
threw a no-no in his big-league
debut with the St. Louis Browns
in 1953. He posted a 3-7 lifetime
mark in the majors.
But Alvarez need not worry
about that. His team is in a
pennant race and, if he does a
decent job next time out, Alvarez
could be a key cog in the White
Sox pennant chase.
The Windy City isn't used to
winning much on the baseball
diamond, but these Sox are for
real. Whether they can overtake
the Twins and hold off the A's is
unclear, but they're certainly a
legitimate contender.
With the likes of young stars
such as Jack McDowell and
Robin Ventura, the White Sox
can win it — and Alvarez can play
a key role. Chicago, Seattle and
Atlanta are three of baseball's
most exciting clubs not only
because they win, but because
they're doing it with unspoiled
youth.
Someday, these talents will
turn into prima donnas like Jose
Canseco and Rickey Henderson.
Today, though, Wilson Alvarez is
thrilled to back in the bigs, to
have pitched a no-hitter, to be in
a pennant race.
John Daly won't have to worry
about being ninth alternate
anytime soon again. He's one of
the guys now. One of the big guys.
Someday, they'll doubtless be
corrupted by big money. Today,
they are just the tonic that their
respective sports need.

can win it — and Alvarez can play
a key role. Chicago, Seattle and
Atlanta are three of baseball's
most exciting clubs not only
because they win, but because
they're doing it with unspoiled
youth.
Someday, these talents will
turn into prima donnas like Jose
Canseco and Rickey Henderson.
Today, though, Wilson Alvarez is
thrilled to back in the bigs, to
have pitched a no-hitter, to be in
a pennant race.
John Daly won't have to worry
about being ninth alternate
anytime soon again. He's one of
the guys now. One of the big guys.
Someday, they'll doubtless be
corrupted by big money. Today,
they are just the tonic that their
respective sports need.
