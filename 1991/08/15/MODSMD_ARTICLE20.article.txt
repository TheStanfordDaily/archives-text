Hoops in Havana
Adam Keefe and the American
men are looking strong as they
commute from Miami to Havana
during their hunt for Pan
American Games gold. The
squad crushed Uruguay Monday,
114-68, and has earned a
semifinal meeting with Puerto
Rico today.
• Jennifer Azzi and Sonja
Henning saw their U.S. women's
team fail to win gold at a major
international competition for the
first time since 1982. Cuba, which
was routed by the Americans 91-
71 Thursday, used the presence of
Fidel Castro to inspire themselves
to an 86-81 victory Saturday in the
semifinals. The U.S. salvaged a
bronze by crushing Canada, 92-61.
Pitch, kick and spike
Though the baseball team lost
to Cuba 3-2 in one of the games'
most gripping moments Sunday,
the United States is very much
alive in the battle for the gold
medal. Jeffrey Hammonds and
recruit Shawn Greene have been
key performers for the squad.
• Randy Mann and Rhett
Harty, along with coach Colin
Lindores, were members of the
gold-medal winning U.S. soccer
squad. The team's 2-1 overtime
defeat of Mexico was one of the
nation's top soccer wins of all
time.
• The U.S. men's volleyball
team, which includes Canyon
Ceman and Duncan Blackman,
needs a win tomorrow to avoid
facing Cuba in the semifinals. But
even with a defeat, they're still in
the medal round.
Bev Oden, Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper are playing for the 1-
3 U.S. women's team. The squad
must defeat Canada tomorrow to
have a chance for a medal.
Platform phenom
Sophomore Eileen Richetelli,
who began diving from the lO
meter platform a year ago, won
the gold medal at the Pan Am
Games, edging American Alison
Maisch on the final dive.
"As long as the U.S. went 1-2,1
wouldn't care which way it went,"
Richetelli said. But the 19-year
old came out on top in her first
major international competition.
In other Pan Am swimming,
Barb Metz was on the U.S. 4 x
200-meter freestyle relay team
which won the gold in record
shattering time. The foursome
swam an 8:11.47, nearly two
seconds better than the previous
Pan Am mark.
"I got hold of a copy of the
records, and said, 'This looks do
able,' " said Jane Skillman, who
teamed with Metz, Natalie
Norberg and Lisa Jacob. Consider
it done.
Metz also won silver medals in

the 200 and 400 freestyle. Suzy
Buckovich won a gold medal in
the 4 x 100 relay. Alex Kostich
took the 400 individual medley
gold with a 4:23.96.
• With the action in Havana,
it's been easy to overlook the
goings on at the Phillips 66
Swimming Championships. Until
now.
Eva Mortensen took third
place in the 800 freestyle at the
event in Fort Lauderdale
Monday. The next day, Derek
Weatherford finished third in the

200 back with a personal best time
of 2:00.90. Yesterday, he won the
400 IM in 4:22.39.
• The U.S. Pan Am water polo
squad was upset by Cuba and
settled for a silver medal. Among
the team members were Stanford
grads Erich Fischer, Craig Klass
and David Imbernino.
Odds and ends
• Andrew Vlahov was selected
in the eighth round of the
Continental Basketball Assoc
iation draft by the Rapid City
Thrillers.
