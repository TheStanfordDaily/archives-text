## Discover the Farm 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Editorial staff 
Jane and Leland Stanford pulled out all the stops to
honor their deceased son when they donated their entire
8,200 acre Palo Alto Stock Farm to create the Leland
Stanford Junior University. At the time it was considered
an enormous expanse of land and, thanks to a clause in
the founding grant prohibiting sale of any land, it still is
enormous.
Understandably, first time visitors find it daunting to
figure out where to start in exploring this "Disneyland of
the North."
Heck, even seniors, who have had at least four years to
get to know the place, still leave without having seen
various campus attractions. Many recent alumni are
probably wishing they'd taken those extra 15 minutes to at
least breeze through the Stanford Museum of Art, now
closed until 1994 due to earthquake damage.
Like most schools, Stanford has the typical points-of
interest, like a student union and a bookstore (a darn fine
bookstore, I might add).
But several other lesser-known sites offer visitors and
residents alike a chance to learn more about everything
from art to horses.
Although the Art Museum is no longer open, art lovers
can still experience the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery. The Gallery was funded by one of Leland
Stanford's brothers, who, before the gallery was
constructed, had traveled to Australia and gotten so
seasick on the voyage that he vowed never to return to
America.
Thomas Stanford never got to see the art gallery he
paid for, but you have a few days left to see it yourself.
The current exhibit, "Jennifer Bartlett and Elizabeth
Murray: Works from the Anderson Collection," closes on
Sunday. New exhibits rotate into the gallery every few
months, and the next one opens in September.
The Art Museum also coordinates campus sculpture
walks on the first Sunday of each month, lead by a docent
from the Art Museum's Educational Services. This tour
shows off the numerous outdoor sculptures Stanford
owns, including a few pieces from the Rodin collection,
like "The Thinker" in front of Meyer Library.
Most of Stanford's Rodin sculptures — the second
largest collection in the world and the largest open to the
public — are kept in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden next to the Art Museum.
Since the garden is outdoors, it's open 24 hours a day
and is especially interesting at night, when the directed
lighting illuminates sculptures like "The Gates of Hell" in
striking fashion.
The Art Museum offers guided tours of the garden on
Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. For more
information on the various Art Museum offerings, call
723-3469.

Memorial Church used to be a very popular campus
building to visit, until the earthquake in October 1989
forced its closure. Although you can't see its interior, with
its beautiful mosaics and stained glass windows, you can
get a great view of the repair work from the observation
platform atop Hoover Tower.
Come to think of it, you can see most of the campus
and a good chunk of the Bay Area from the tower.
Standing 285 feet tall, the tower is the tallest building
between here and Los Angeles, although there isn't much
of anything between here and Los Angeles.
For $1, you can take the elevator to the platform,
located at the 250-foot level, and not only get an aerial
view of Stanford, but also see the 35-bell carillon housed
in the tower. The platform is open from 10 a.m. to 4:30
p.m., seven days a week until Sept. 6. Call 723-2053 for
more information.
The tower also sports a brand-new set of lobby
displays, installed for the landmark structure's 50th
birthday. One display room highlights the life of Herbert
Hoover, featuring his fishing pole, his Stanford report
card and numerous items relating to his humanitarian
efforts.
Another room features mementos of Hoover's wife,
Lou Henry Hoover, who met her husband when both
were attending Stanford. The Herbert Hoover Room and
the Lou Henry Hoover Room are free and open to the
public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week.
The Hoover display rooms include mineral samples
collected by each Hoover — both graduates in geology —
during trips overseas. These rocks are on loan from the
School of Earth Sciences Mineral Collection, another
little-known campus attraction.
A mineral collection doesn't sound very interesting, to
be sure; you're probably thinking, "What, a few rocks in a
display case, right?" Wrong.
Try a whole lot of amazingly beautiful and fascinating
rocks in four floor-to-ceiling display cases on the second
floor of the Ruth Wattis Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building.
The best part of the display is the spiral staircase
leading up to the main exhibit. The stairs wrap around a
two-story vertical glass case containing pieces from the
collection.
The collection is on display Monday through Friday
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
With Stanford's 100 th birthday rapidly approaching,
the University Archives have been very busy preparing
special exhibits relating to Stanford's history.
The Archives, coordinated by the Stanford University
Libraries Department of Special Collections, regularly
feature exhibits at the Herbert Hoover Memorial
Exhibition Pavilion, located at the foot of Hoover Tower,
and in the lobby of Cireen Library.
The Hoover Exhibition Pavilion currently houses "A
Lasting Impact: A Century of Collections in the Stanford

University Li
braries." If
you're even re
motely inter
ested in the
history of the
University, this
exhibit is not to
be missed, since
it contains selec
tions from the
University's enor
mous archives.
The Green
Library summer
exhibit, also

sponsored by Special Collections, is titled "Exploring the
West: Selections from the Collection of Edward J.
Redmon." In late September, the exhibit will change to
honor Stanford's Centennial with "The Academic
Cornerstone: Faculty and Students in Stanford's First
Year."
For more information on exhibits sponsored by the
Department of Special Collections, call 725-1022.
The University's history is, of course, alive and well in
the campus itself. The Inner Quad and other original
University buildings turn 100 this October, but they're not
the oldest buildings at Stanford.
The Red Bam originally served as the center for the
Stanfords* horse-breeding operations — 19 world
champion trotters came from the original Stanford farm.
These recently renovated beautiful Victorian stables, now
the home of the Stanford Equestrian Center, offer a slice
of the University's pastoral history.
A monument to Electioneer, the greatest of Leland
Stanford's horses, stands near the Red Barn, located on
Electioneer Road off Campus Drive West.
The Barn is always open, but remember the horses
need their sleep too. On Saturday the Barn is having its
Red Barn Festival; call 322-5713 for more information.
The Stanfords themselves are still a part of the
campus, since their final resting placc is on the grounds of
the University. The Stanford Family Mausoleum, site of
the annual senior class Halloween party, contains the
crypts of Leland Stanford, Jane Lathrop Stanford and
Leland Stanford Junior.
Once a year, on Founders' Day, the mausoleum is
opened so the three large marble coffins can be viewed.
During the rest of the year, however, the mausoleum,
located in a quiet tree-filled grove west of Palm Drive
between Campus Drive and Arboretum Road, provides a
opportunity for serene reflection on the lasting gift the
Stanfords gave in honor of their deceased son.

Most campus attractions require advance resen'ations for
groups of 10 or more.

Since the garden is outdoors, it's open 24 hours a day
and is especially interesting at night, when the directed
lighting illuminates sculptures like "The Gates of Hell" in
striking fashion.
The Art Museum offers guided tours of the garden on
Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. For more
information on the various Art Museum offerings, call
723-3469.

Memorial Church used to be a very popular campus
building to visit, until the earthquake in October 1989
forced its closure. Although you can't see its interior, with
its beautiful mosaics and stained glass windows, you can
get a great view of the repair work from the observation
platform atop Hoover Tower.
Come to think of it, you can see most of the campus
and a good chunk of the Bay Area from the tower.
Standing 285 feet tall, the tower is the tallest building
between here and Los Angeles, although there isn't much
of anything between here and Los Angeles.
For $1, you can take the elevator to the platform,
located at the 250-foot level, and not only get an aerial
view of Stanford, but also see the 35-bell carillon housed
in the tower. The platform is open from 10 a.m. to 4:30
p.m., seven days a week until Sept. 6. Call 723-2053 for
more information.
The tower also sports a brand-new set of lobby
displays, installed for the landmark structure's 50th
birthday. One display room highlights the life of Herbert
Hoover, featuring his fishing pole, his Stanford report
card and numerous items relating to his humanitarian
efforts.
Another room features mementos of Hoover's wife,
Lou Henry Hoover, who met her husband when both
were attending Stanford. The Herbert Hoover Room and
the Lou Henry Hoover Room are free and open to the
public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week.
The Hoover display rooms include mineral samples
collected by each Hoover — both graduates in geology —
during trips overseas. These rocks are on loan from the
School of Earth Sciences Mineral Collection, another
little-known campus attraction.
A mineral collection doesn't sound very interesting, to
be sure; you're probably thinking, "What, a few rocks in a
display case, right?" Wrong.
Try a whole lot of amazingly beautiful and fascinating
rocks in four floor-to-ceiling display cases on the second
floor of the Ruth Wattis Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building.
The best part of the display is the spiral staircase
leading up to the main exhibit. The stairs wrap around a
two-story vertical glass case containing pieces from the
collection.
The collection is on display Monday through Friday
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
With Stanford's 100 th birthday rapidly approaching,
the University Archives have been very busy preparing
special exhibits relating to Stanford's history.
The Archives, coordinated by the Stanford University
Libraries Department of Special Collections, regularly
feature exhibits at the Herbert Hoover Memorial
Exhibition Pavilion, located at the foot of Hoover Tower,
and in the lobby of Cireen Library.
The Hoover Exhibition Pavilion currently houses "A
Lasting Impact: A Century of Collections in the Stanford

University Li
braries." If
you're even re
motely inter
ested in the
history of the
University, this
exhibit is not to
be missed, since
it contains selec
tions from the
University's enor
mous archives.
The Green
Library summer
exhibit, also

sponsored by Special Collections, is titled "Exploring the
West: Selections from the Collection of Edward J.
Redmon." In late September, the exhibit will change to
honor Stanford's Centennial with "The Academic
Cornerstone: Faculty and Students in Stanford's First
Year."
For more information on exhibits sponsored by the
Department of Special Collections, call 725-1022.
The University's history is, of course, alive and well in
the campus itself. The Inner Quad and other original
University buildings turn 100 this October, but they're not
the oldest buildings at Stanford.
The Red Bam originally served as the center for the
Stanfords* horse-breeding operations — 19 world
champion trotters came from the original Stanford farm.
These recently renovated beautiful Victorian stables, now
the home of the Stanford Equestrian Center, offer a slice
of the University's pastoral history.
A monument to Electioneer, the greatest of Leland
Stanford's horses, stands near the Red Barn, located on
Electioneer Road off Campus Drive West.
The Barn is always open, but remember the horses
need their sleep too. On Saturday the Barn is having its
Red Barn Festival; call 322-5713 for more information.
The Stanfords themselves are still a part of the
campus, since their final resting placc is on the grounds of
the University. The Stanford Family Mausoleum, site of
the annual senior class Halloween party, contains the
crypts of Leland Stanford, Jane Lathrop Stanford and
Leland Stanford Junior.
Once a year, on Founders' Day, the mausoleum is
opened so the three large marble coffins can be viewed.
During the rest of the year, however, the mausoleum,
located in a quiet tree-filled grove west of Palm Drive
between Campus Drive and Arboretum Road, provides a
opportunity for serene reflection on the lasting gift the
Stanfords gave in honor of their deceased son.

Most campus attractions require advance resen'ations for
groups of 10 or more.

Jane and Leland Stanford pulled out all the stops to
honor their deceased son when they donated their entire
8,200 acre Palo Alto Stock Farm to create the Leland
Stanford Junior University. At the time it was considered
an enormous expanse of land and, thanks to a clause in
the founding grant prohibiting sale of any land, it still is
enormous.
Understandably, first time visitors find it daunting to
figure out where to start in exploring this "Disneyland of
the North."
Heck, even seniors, who have had at least four years to
get to know the place, still leave without having seen
various campus attractions. Many recent alumni are
probably wishing they'd taken those extra 15 minutes to at
least breeze through the Stanford Museum of Art, now
closed until 1994 due to earthquake damage.
Like most schools, Stanford has the typical points-of
interest, like a student union and a bookstore (a darn fine
bookstore, I might add).
But several other lesser-known sites offer visitors and
residents alike a chance to learn more about everything
from art to horses.
Although the Art Museum is no longer open, art lovers
can still experience the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery. The Gallery was funded by one of Leland
Stanford's brothers, who, before the gallery was
constructed, had traveled to Australia and gotten so
seasick on the voyage that he vowed never to return to
America.
Thomas Stanford never got to see the art gallery he
paid for, but you have a few days left to see it yourself.
The current exhibit, "Jennifer Bartlett and Elizabeth
Murray: Works from the Anderson Collection," closes on
Sunday. New exhibits rotate into the gallery every few
months, and the next one opens in September.
The Art Museum also coordinates campus sculpture
walks on the first Sunday of each month, lead by a docent
from the Art Museum's Educational Services. This tour
shows off the numerous outdoor sculptures Stanford
owns, including a few pieces from the Rodin collection,
like "The Thinker" in front of Meyer Library.
Most of Stanford's Rodin sculptures — the second
largest collection in the world and the largest open to the
public — are kept in the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden next to the Art Museum.
Since the garden is outdoors, it's open 24 hours a day
and is especially interesting at night, when the directed
lighting illuminates sculptures like "The Gates of Hell" in
striking fashion.
