# Confusion succeeds in 'M. Butterfly'
## 
### Raphe Beck 
Just to clear up any confusion, "M.
Butterfly," which opened last weekend in
San Francisco, is not an abbreviated form
of "Madame Butterfly."
Here's the difference: "Madame
Butterfly" is an opera written by Giacomo
Puccini in 1904; "M. Butterfly" is a

spectacular play by Stanford
graduate David Henry
Hwang, who captured a
1988 Tony award for Best
Play.
Superficially, "M.
Butterfly" is inspired by the
true story of a French

diplomat stationed in China in the 19605.
He falls in love with a Chinese opera
singer who also happens to be a spy. After
a 20-year affair that produces a child, the
diplomat finds out she's not the woman he
thought she was; in fact, she's a man.
Hwang has no pretensions of
recounting the real-life story, and "M.
Butterfly" is instead his attempt to explain
how this unbelievable tale could possibly
occur. He presents a psychological
deconstruction of Puccini's opera that
might leave even Sigmund Freud double
checking his cigar.
Gallimard, the diplomat, explains that
his own delusion results from his
identification with Pinkerton, the hero of
"Madame Butterfly." His desire to find
the perfect Oriental "lotus blossom," as
Pinkerton did, leads him to his blindness.
After reading a draft of "M. Butterfly"
in 1986, the late director John Dexter
("Equus") called it the best play he had
read in 20 years. The current tour
recreates his excellent original direction,
moving fluidly through the play's three
acts. Of particular note is a scene in the

Chinese opera in which the spy, Song
Liling, is joined by two performers in an
impressive display of baton-throwing
combat choreography.
A. Mapa as Song, perhaps one of the
most challenging roles ever written for an
actor, deserves a standing ovation for his
remarkable performance. Not only do his
every word and gesture as the disguised

singer intoxicate the
audience into belief, but his
transformation into the true
character merits nothing
short of an audible gasp and
applause.
Somewhat upstaged by
Mapa is Philip Anglim —

seen 12 years ago on Broadway as "The
Elephant Man" — as a campy Gallimard.
While his portrayal makes Gallimard's
Butterfly fantasy believable, it has an
adolescent quality that detracts from
Hwang's attempt to make him
uncomfortably familiar, as if his tragic
fault lies within us all.
Also of note is the set design by
internationally renowned graphic artist
Eiko Ishioka. A single ramp sweeps down
around the entire stage, conveying at once
the simple and all-encompassing quality
of Gallimard's delusion.
Several beautiful drops are awe
inspiring. One appears to be a butterfly
until closer inspection reveals it to be a
deceiving collection of flowers and birds,
paralleling the nature of the play.
"M. Butterfly" is not to be missed. Its
discussion of sexism, racism, sexual
orientation and the "international rape
mentality" leaves much to be pondered.
You may have to dig deep into your
pocket for this expensive ticket, but the
rewards are great.
