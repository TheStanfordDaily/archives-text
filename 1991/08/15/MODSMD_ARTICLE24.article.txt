# Get in touch with science at the Exploratorium
## 
### Erin Jordan 
Now don't get me wrong. I can
possibly stomach a computer
science class or two; I'll even take
a little bit of calculus when
extreme duress is applied. But
put me in the middle of a physics
or chemistry class and I'll
probably run screaming and run
from the scene. I'm sorry, but
science just isn't my thing.
"Then how on earth," some
would say, "could you spend a
whole day at a museum that is
dedicated soley to scientific
research and natural
phenomena?"
"Well, that's simple," I'd say.
"This place is different!" But
"different" is hardly an adjective
that does justice to this place.
"This place" is The
Exploratorium Museum of
Science, Art and Human
Perception, and the best
adjective to describe it is fun. Out
of the more than 650 exhibits
displayed, there isn't a single one
in the whole building that doesn't
wholeheartedly, if not
mandatorily, encourage
participation. There isn't a single
sign in the whole museum that
reads "DO NOT TOUCH."
Instead you read signs like
"Take such and such and do so

and so" and "Try this" and "Test
that." And judging by the
multitude of rambunctious kids
testing them, these exhibits are
prepared to take quite a beating.
At the Exploratorium, visitors
are treated to a vast array of
really neat, awesomely cool and
totally tripped-out experiences.
Pardon the sophomoric
adjectives, but there just are no
other words that properly
describe these things.
Mechanical engineers — leave
your analytical intellect at the
door and resist the temptation to
quote the relevant laws of matter
and motion demonstrated by
each exhibit. Just this once, be
enchanted by the beauty of it or
amused by the simplicity. Let
your jaw drop and say, "Wow!"
As for those of you who think
Newton's law has something to
do with fig cookies, have no fear.
You're not about to get a lecture
on the properties of sound waves.
You will, however, get to spend
as much time as you want playing
in the grand echo chamber, or
creating computer music or
identifying the different
frequencies of sound that you
make when you whistle.
With whole sections dedicated
to topics like electricity, weather,
color, sound, motion, touch,

light, vision and color, you're
bound to find something that
fascinates you. One could spend
hours in just a single section of
museum.
And if you think you've seen
it, then visit the famous Tactile
Dome. With reservations made a
week in advance, you can grope
around in total darkness feeling
the different textures of tile and
other assorted substances while
making your way through a
human maze.
The entrance to the Palace of
Fine Arts, the home of the
Exploratorium, features romantic
architecture, a grassy landscape
and a misty, swan-filled pond
surrounded by graceful trees. It's
the perfect atmosphere for a
picnic (weather permitting, of
course), but, if you carelessly
forgot your potato salad
sandwiches at home, a brief stroll
along the pond on your way to
the Exploratorium entrance will
do quite nicely.
Now if I could only get this to
count for DR 7

The Exploratorium is located at
3601 Lyon St.in the Palace of Fine
Arts, SF, and is open six days a
week. Call 563-733 7 for more
information.
