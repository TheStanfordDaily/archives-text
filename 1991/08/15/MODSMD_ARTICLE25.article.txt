Burning in Harlem
"Paris is Burning," documentary
directed and produced by Jennie
Livingston
When Jennie Livingston
began filming "Paris is Burning"
in 1985, Madonna hadn't yet
recorded "Vogue," and"In
Living Color" hadn't yet
introduced "Men on ..with its
two black gay "snap queens."
The topics of voguing and the
drag balls of Harlem were
unknown to mainstream Amer
ica, and Livingston's docu
mentary was meant to bring to
light a fascinating subculture.
Six years later, many people
are at least aware of with the
world of black and Latino gay
men in New York.
But to Livingston's credit,
"Paris is Burning" is still
provocatively enlightening, yet
without being lurid. The
sociological implications of this
alternate world created by a
suppressed, scorned and
oftentimes hated part of society
are enough to fill volumes, but
the film attempts to present
much more than commentary. It
tries to give the audience a sense

of what the balls mean to those
who "walk" in them.
Many of the people presented
in the film have lost their real
families because of their sexual
orientation, and the "houses,"
led by "mothers," provide a
surrogate family and a means of
identification.
The goal of the "house
children" is to become
"legendary," to achieve a status
of awe and respect in the ball
community. What Livingston
illustrates, however, is that their
desire for fame and acceptance is
no different from the hopes and
dreams of the heterosexual
members of society.
Especially revealing are the
interviews intercut with the ball
footage. Walkers like Pepper
Labeija, Legendary Mother of
the House of Labeija, are
articulate and honest about what
it means to have "three strikes
against you," namely being black,
male and gay.
The depth of the psychological
impact the balls have on the
walkers is staggering. At once,
they feel "completely right about
being gay," receiving cheers and
trophies instead of taunts and
jeers. Indeed, you can't help but
agree with aging drag queen
Dorian Corey, who notes that if
everybody went to balls instead
of doing drugs, the world would
be a better place.
