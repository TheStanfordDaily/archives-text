Daytime dream
"Delirious," starring John Candy,
Emma Samms and Mariel
Hemingway
John Candy's new film,
"Delirious," has a great premise:
A soap opera writer ends up in
the world of his own show, and he
is able to control events by simply
scripting them on his trusty
typewriter.
But this film should have taken
a lesson from "Soapdish," this
summer's hilarious "other" film
about the soaps. Because soap
operas are inherently parodies of
themselves, it takes the over-the
top kind of humor illustrated in
"Soapdish" to even begin to make
fun of them.
"Delirious" just doesn't go far
enough in mocking the soaps to
provoke more than a few
chuckles. Candy, as a frustrated
writer who's in love with the
leading lady and at war with his
executive producers, doesn't
inspire the kind of pity needed to
make the audience say, "Good for
you!" when he finally gets to live
out his fantasies in the mythical
town of Ashford Falls.
Candy can't even script his
dreams correctly, and his
ineptitude at properly controling
events gets tiresome rather

quickly. One minute he's the
dashing, Lone Rangerish figure
rescuing Rachel — the soap
character played by Laura (Emma
Samms) — but the next minute he
can't even ride his horse back to
the stables because he neglected
to write himself back.
At times, the logic of the soap
world begins to break down,
further bogging down the movie.
Who exactly controls the people
in "Beyond Our Dreams"? Is it
Candy or the new writer brought
in by the executive producers? Or
do the characters actually have
some self-determination?
The entire film comes across as
superficial and ill-conceived.
Candy falls in love with Janet, a
minor character he considers a
throwaway. But the actress
(Mariel Hemingway) who plays
Janet in his dreamlike experience
in reality wasn't cast for the part.
There seems to be no rhyme or
reason for their romance.
Equally frustrating is that the
soap characters are almost
indistinguishable from the actors
who portray them. The major
fault of the film seems to be that
it's more a gloss on soaps than a
spoof of them. Even without
comparing it to the infinitely
superior "Soapdish," "Delirious"
simply has little to laugh at and
certainly no one to root for.
Without those things, even the
best premise in the world can't
possibly succeed.

Bitter medicine
"The Doctor," starring William
Hurl, Christine iMhti and
Elizabeth Perkins
With the possible exception of
Robert DeNiro, Hollywood's top
actor these days is William Hurt.
"The Doctor" does nothing to
knock Hurt from his lofty perch.
Hurt portrays Dr. Jack Mac-
Kee, an obnoxious, overbearing
cardiac surgeon, who finds the
tables turned on him when he
contracts throat cancer. From that
point on, MacKee learns just how
screwed up and uncaring the
medical profession can be.
The movie is based on Dr. Ed
Rosenbaum's autobiographical
"A Taste of My Own Medicine,"
which would have been a fine
movie title. But no matter, Hurt
is delightful when he's a jerk and
equally terrific as his character
transmogrifies into a caring
family man.
Elizabeth Perkins steals the
show with her portrait of June. A
victim of brain cancer, June
befriends Jack and their interplay
forms a delicate thread which
carries "The Doctor."
One of the true delights of the
film is its surprising sense of
humor. A drama, to be sure, "The
Doctor" is also funny whenever it
tries to be — and that's pretty
often. Hurt delivers one-liners
with aplomb and the singing in the
operating room is sure to please,
even though Nancy, a nurse,

refuses to join in the reverie.
With all the concern over
inadequate health care in the
United States these days, "The
Doctor" should be skipped by
those preparing to enter a
hospital anytime soon. The
endless bureaucracy, lack of
concern for patient welfare and
occasional delivery of inap
propriate treatment displayed in
the movie is hardly reassuring.
Everyone else is advised to
check out this summer sleeper. It's
been playing on a limited number

of screens since it opened, but has
one of the best per-theater grosses
of the summer.
Watching Hurt ply his trade is
always a treat. In"The Doctor,"
he is at the top of his craft. Laugh
with him when he's on top, worry
with him as he confronts his
disease, cry with him as he
suffers loss — and smile as he
learns countless lessons in life.
And if you're really, really
nice, maybe Nancy will hum a
few bars for you.

can't even ride his horse back to
the stables because he neglected
to write himself back.
At times, the logic of the soap
world begins to break down,
further bogging down the movie.
Who exactly controls the people
in "Beyond Our Dreams"? Is it
Candy or the new writer brought
in by the executive producers? Or
do the characters actually have
some self-determination?
The entire film comes across as
superficial and ill-conceived.
Candy falls in love with Janet, a
minor character he considers a
throwaway. But the actress
(Mariel Hemingway) who plays
Janet in his dreamlike experience
in reality wasn't cast for the part.
There seems to be no rhyme or
reason for their romance.
Equally frustrating is that the
soap characters are almost
indistinguishable from the actors
who portray them. The major
fault of the film seems to be that
it's more a gloss on soaps than a
spoof of them. Even without
comparing it to the infinitely
superior "Soapdish," "Delirious"
simply has little to laugh at and
certainly no one to root for.
Without those things, even the
best premise in the world can't
possibly succeed.

Bitter medicine
"The Doctor," starring William
Hurl, Christine iMhti and
Elizabeth Perkins
With the possible exception of
Robert DeNiro, Hollywood's top
actor these days is William Hurt.
"The Doctor" does nothing to
knock Hurt from his lofty perch.
Hurt portrays Dr. Jack Mac-
Kee, an obnoxious, overbearing
cardiac surgeon, who finds the
tables turned on him when he
contracts throat cancer. From that
point on, MacKee learns just how
screwed up and uncaring the
medical profession can be.
The movie is based on Dr. Ed
Rosenbaum's autobiographical
"A Taste of My Own Medicine,"
which would have been a fine
movie title. But no matter, Hurt
is delightful when he's a jerk and
equally terrific as his character
transmogrifies into a caring
family man.
Elizabeth Perkins steals the
show with her portrait of June. A
victim of brain cancer, June
befriends Jack and their interplay
forms a delicate thread which
carries "The Doctor."
One of the true delights of the
film is its surprising sense of
humor. A drama, to be sure, "The
Doctor" is also funny whenever it
tries to be — and that's pretty
often. Hurt delivers one-liners
with aplomb and the singing in the
operating room is sure to please,
even though Nancy, a nurse,

refuses to join in the reverie.
With all the concern over
inadequate health care in the
United States these days, "The
Doctor" should be skipped by
those preparing to enter a
hospital anytime soon. The
endless bureaucracy, lack of
concern for patient welfare and
occasional delivery of inap
propriate treatment displayed in
the movie is hardly reassuring.
Everyone else is advised to
check out this summer sleeper. It's
been playing on a limited number

of screens since it opened, but has
one of the best per-theater grosses
of the summer.
Watching Hurt ply his trade is
always a treat. In"The Doctor,"
he is at the top of his craft. Laugh
with him when he's on top, worry
with him as he confronts his
disease, cry with him as he
suffers loss — and smile as he
learns countless lessons in life.
And if you're really, really
nice, maybe Nancy will hum a
few bars for you.
