Editor's picks:
Required summer reading
• Danielle Steele — Full of romance,
tragedy and happily-ever-after endings,
Steele's novels are perfect for a day at the
beach or an afternoon in the backyard.
They're cheesy, but they're entertaining,
and they require very little brain power.
• Stephen King — King has been called
the master of horror, and reading any of

his novels will prove it is an appropriate
title. His novels are well-written and, more
importantly, they're riveting.
