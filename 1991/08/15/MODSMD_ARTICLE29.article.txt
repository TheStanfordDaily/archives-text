You know the old saying, "This'll separate the
men from the boys?" In today's society, it's often
difficult to separate the men from the women.
Drag balls in Harlem feature the category of
"Realness," where men try to look as much like
women as possible. In the play "M. Butterfly," a
Chinese spy pretends to be a woman for 20 years,
tricking his male lover into believing they have a
child together.
When you can't find "He Said, She Said," a
gender-based comedy, on the video shelves (as if
you really wanted it), consider some of
Hollywood's takes on transvestism, varying from
the comic to the serious.

• "Tootsie" — A great film featuring Dustin
Hoffman as an out-of-work actor who dresses as a
woman to land a choice role on a soap opera.
• "Some Like It Hot" — Tony Curtis and Jack
Lemmon are on the run from the law and hook up
with an all-female band. Of course, this requires
they become all-female, at least in appearance.
• "Victor/Victoria" — How's this for confusing:
Julie Andrews plays a female impersonator who is
secretly really a woman.
• "Yerttl" — In turn-of-the-century Eastern
Europe, opportunities for women were limited to
marrying well and making great meals. In this
innovative musical, Barbra Streisand masquerades
as a man so she can get a religious education.
• "Rocky Horror Picture Show" — Although it's
much more entertaining in a theater with a large
audience, this film, with Tim Curry as a "Sweet
Transvestite," is a cult classic recently made
available on video.
