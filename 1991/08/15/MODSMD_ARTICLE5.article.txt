## Column On the road again 
### 
I'm sitting in my current car,
an '86 Toyota Celica, on 18th
Street in San Francisco. I'm
gripping the steering wheel,
shaking and thinking, "God, not
again. I hate driving." I had just
been broadsided, at about 15
miles per hour, by a woman — in
a huge, '76 Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme — who decided to deal
with a stop sign the quick way.
It turned out she didn't have
insurance. In fact, she didn't
even have a driver's license. The
address and phone number she
gave me were false, and the
license plate number I wrote
down for her Olds matched a
Honda in Los Angeles. But
fortunately, my uninsured
motorist coverage took care of
the damage to my passenger
door. I just recently got my car
back, and it looks great. No
problem, right?
Not quite. You see, I've just
about reached my maximum
tolerance for driving and all of
the headaches that go with it,
like accidents, breakdowns and
other things that I file away as
"miscellaneous."
In my accident file, I have six
items: a dented front corner, a
dented back corner, two totals
(yes, two), a rear-ender and the
latest, a broadside.
In my breakdown file, I've got
six items, too: three flat tires —
the first in East Palo Alto at 9
p.m., the second in front of
Toyon Hall and the third at
Applewood Inn, where I took my
roommates for pizza freshman
year, because I was the lucky
one who had a car.
Then there was my dead
battery (in the middle of an
intersection on University
Avenue), the bad alternator that
caused my dead battery and a
broken timing chain (which left
my boyfriend stuck in a San
Francisco financial district
intersection ... at lunch hour).
In my miscellaneous file I've
got two (just two, isn't that
great?) memorable experiences.
The first happened just two
weeks after I got my license. I
ran out of gas on the freeway at
10 p.m. Fool that I was, I ran
along the freeway toward home
(five miles away). Luckily, about
three miles into my run, a cop
picked me up, scolded me and
took me home. My second
miscellaneous disaster was
discovering, at 3 a.m. in San
Francisco, that my car had been
towed. It cost me $80 and a
night of sleep, but at least there
were no freeways involved.
Sometimes I think I was
cursed at birth by the driving
god. I've never had any sense of

direction, so I get lost
everywhere I go. This seems to
happen whether I have car
trouble or not. This directional
problem of mine often means I
spend about twice as much time
in the car as I would otherwise
need to, which for me is a very
bad thing because it just gives me
more time to have an accident.
But I am starting to think that
the problem is not really with
driving; it's with stopping and
starting. Both of my totals were
caused by red lights that people
ran; the rear-ender happened
because I stopped for a red light
and the person behind me didn't;
the broadside was a stop sign
problem; all of the flat tires were
discovered in parking lots; and
my battery problem happened at
an intersection. So maybe the
driving god is just trying to tell
me not to stop.
Some good things have come
of all of this. I can change a tire
pretty well — my roommates
were astonished at how fast I
could change it when we were at
the Applewood Inn. And I think
my car problems have brought
me closer to my dad, because,
you know, dealing with insurance
companies can be a real bonding
experience. He's got this theory
now that maybe if I drive red cars
people will see me and not hit me
as often. I like it.
But when I'm driving, I really
feel like an accident magnet. I'm
just waiting for the next one.
Since it's saved my life twice now,
I'm a big seat belt fan.
Sometimes I wish I could wear
two of them.
There is a guaranteed bright
spot in my driving future, though.
I'm going to Stanford at Oxford
next year, and I won't have a car
at all. I'm sure I'll still get lost,
but at least I won't be driving. I
can just picture it: no wrecks, no
gas bills, no oil changes, no flat
tires, no battery problems . . .
beautiful, huh?
