## Stanford is not accessible to all of its students 
### 
For the past couple of years, construction
and renovation of everything from
classroom buildings to residence halls has
been occuring on all parts of the Stanford
campus. These undertakings are designed to
expand University facilities and make them
available to all members of the Stanford
community.
But in some of the projects, Stanford should
take a closer look at a large, yet often
unacknowledged, section of its population —
people with disabilities. Indeed, many areas on
campus remain inaccessible to individuals in
wheelchairs.
For example, both entering the platform at the
top of Hoover Tower and accessing the Hoover
library in the tower's lobby present difficulties
for disabled people.
In order for individuals in wheelchairs to
reach this area, all regular visiting activities at
the tower must stop while that person and
student guides go far out of their way — around
the tower to the Hoover Memorial Building,
down the elevator of that building, through the
underground tunnel connecting the two
buildings, and finally to the basement of the
tower.
Only from there may they take the tower
elevator to the first floor or platform. This
inefficiency and confusion could be alleviated if
ramps were added up the steps of the Tower's
entrance.
Many graduate and undergraduate
dormitories on campus also lack effective
wheelchair access. Residence staff members try
to create a sense of openness and community
spirit among dorm residents. However, when
students can not get to each other's rooms due to
a physical impediment, this togetherness is hard
to achieve.
One recent graduate with a mobility impairment

said she did not keep in touch with most of the
people from her freshman dorm because they lived
in areas she could not easily get to.
Even in new buildings, wheelchair access is
often incomplete. Kimball Hall, the
undergraduate dormitory currently under
construction on the east end of campus, has first
floor rooms accessible to individuals in
wheelchairs, but rooms on other floors are not.
The estimated cost of an elevator in Kimball is
about $100,000, roughly one percent of the entire
building project. Granted, University budget cuts
have made it difficult for Stanford to afford such
luxuries as elevators, however, their inclusion in
Kimball and other buildings would make these
buildings much easier for all to use.
Many campus buildings share these problems
with disability access. It is very difficult, for
instance, for members of the Stanford
community in wheelchairs to go swimming at
deGuerre or to attend athletic events at the
Stanford Stadium. Likewise, these individuals
can not easily attend meetings in the Old Union
Clubhouse or the Fire Truck House, which
ironically houses student organizations
associated with multiculturalism.
In light of*these difficulties, it would be a
positive, reflection on the University if it made
the changes in its building policies that are
needed to accommodate disabled individuals.
This goal is especially important as Stanford
prepares for its Centennial Celebration, a time
when the University should be learning from its
past and making plans for its future.
The Stanford campus and community should
be an open and welcoming place for everyone,
free from barriers which might limit their
enjoyment of all the University has to offer.
Making all campus buildings and structures as
wheelchair-accessible as possible is a good place
to start in achieving this goal.
