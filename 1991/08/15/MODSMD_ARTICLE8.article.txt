# Conservation and recycling do have their rewards
## 
### 
OK, you've been good all
summer. You've recycled
all of your glass,
aluminum, newspaper, other
paper and junk mail. You've
conserved both energy and water,
and you've encouraged all of your
family and friends to do the same.
Why? With just a little extra
effort, you have saved natural
resources and kept pollution out
of the environment.
Every once in a while, it's nice

to get outdoors and see what it is
that you are working to preserve.
Stanford is surrounded by diverse
environments, and getting out to
see some of them can be both fun
and informative. From the
Foothills to the Bay, there is lots
to see and do.
If you want to take a trip to the
Bay and see what a "wetland area"
is like, the Palo Alto Baylands
Nature Preserve is an easy bike
ride from campus — just follow

Embarcadero Road out beyond
U.S. Highway 101 for a mile or so.
This preserve is great, and there is
an interpretive center there to
teach you a thing or two about it.
If you feel like heading for the
hills, the Foothills are a pretty nice
place to start. If you want to see
animals other than cows, you can
go to the Arastradero Preserve.
Arastradero is also an easy ride
from campus — take Page Mill
Road to just beyond U.S. Highway

280 and turn right on Arastradero
Road. The preserve is on the right
side of the road, about half a mile
from Page Mill Road.
If you what to go a little farther
away from Stanford, you can visit
one of the many Open Space
Preserves that are located on
Skyline Boulevard. To get there,
follow Page Mill Road out past
U.S. Highway 280 all the way to
Skyline Boulevard. You can turn
either left or right on Skyline

Boulevard — there are preserves
in both directions. Some of these
preserves allow mountain biking,
but be sure to check the signs
carefully.
Wherever you go, take a lunch
and enjoy yourself in the natural
beauty of the environment that
you've helped to protect and
preserve.
