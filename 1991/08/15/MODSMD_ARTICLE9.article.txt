# WHEN EAST MEETS WEST

Maki Kosaka, a university student
from Tokyo, always wanted to
know what it would be like to
visit the famous country she only
knew through its entertainment
and the media. She wanted to experience
the United States and learn about its
culture firsthand, not just in the cliche
forms of McDonald's, Coca-Cola and
Madonna.
"I have been learning English for six
years, and I wanted to come to America,"
Kosaka said. In Japan, "I often heard the
name of America in movies and
newspapers and have some knowledge" of
the United States, she added.
This summer, Kosaka got what she
wished for.
Kosaka and about 100 other college
students from East Asia are spending their
summer vacations at Stanford as part of a
program called the Transpacific Exchange.
The program is run by the Stanford-based
Volunteers in Asia organization.
Volunteers in Asia is an independent,
non-profit program that brings Asian
students to the United States to study U.S.
culture. In return, U.S. students are able
to teach English in East Asia.
This summer, two consecutive groups of
around 50 Asian students and six
American hosts, most of them Stanford
students, are visiting Stanford. Each group
lives in University dormitories for four
weeks and then visits Los Angeles and
Hawaii before returning home.
Many students said that before coming
to Stanford, most of what they knew of the
United States came from Western forms
of music, movies and fashion that have
become prevalent in their countries along
with American businesses and industry.
Richard Chuo, a Korean student, said
that at home in Seoul, he constantly listens
to a radio station that plays mostly U.S.
music. "I love jazz very much," he said.
Christopher Kim, another Korean
student, said U.S. movies are one of the
most popular types of cinema in Korea. In
addition, many Koreans get their
knowledge of the United States through
such news magazines as Time and
Newsweek, Kim said.
Many Asian students also come to the
United States with glorified expectations
of what it will be like. In many East Asian
countries, the United States is always
identified with freedom and success.
"America is full of hope," Chuo
explained. "Maybe if you are poor today,
you might be rich tomorrow."
After only a few days at Stanford,
Yashuhiro Ito, a Japanese student, said, "I
had never been to a foreign place. All my
information comes from TV and

newspapers. The United
States is a country of
accepting and welcome.
Everybody will accept
me.
While in the United
States, the Asian students
take a language class and a
course in U.S. cultural and
political issues. The aim of
the course is to enhance
their understanding of
U.S. culture and lifestyle
using the English skills
they learned at home and
are studying here.
"The program is great,
and the English lessons
are very interesting," said
Ito.
Organizers say the
program is designed to
reflect the diverse nature
of U.S. society. Among
other activities, the
students visit everything
from gospel churches in
San Francisco to homeless
shelters in Berkeley to
baseball games in
Oakland.
Clifford Chan, a
Stanford graduate and one
of the directors of the

Volunteers in Asia program, said, "We
want to show them as much American
culture as we can. Showing those things
helps dispel some of the myths they might
have."
The program also draws heavily on the
social and academic atmosphere of

at home.

Stanford. Program
coordinators try to expose
the Asian students to
issues such as interracial
relationships and homo
sexuality, which are often
not as openly discussed in
East Asian countries as
they are on U.S. college
campuses.
"The type of res
idential education program
that we have in the
dormitories is a new thing
for them. It is one aspect of
Stanford that is special,"
Chan said. "Students here
do extracurricular activities
and have such programs as
the peer counseling center,
which are not even
conceivable in Asia."
Students come to the
program full of wonder and
expectation, Chan said.
Everything is a new
experience. "They see
America through a child's
eyes. Things like kissing in
public [are] entirely new.
The energy and enthusiasm
of the participants is
comparable to that of
(Freshman) Orientation."

Chan said he remembered vividly one
incident in which a Korean visitor went to a
frozen yogurt stand. "The first time she had
frozen yogurt, she said 'Oh my God! I want
to live in Amcrica!"'
Stanford sophomore Carolyn Baek,
another Volunteers in Asia coordinator,

said mutual communication of different
experiences and the interaction between
Asians and Americans are beneficial to
everybody. "It is not just a one-way thing"
Baek said. "There is an exchange of
learning. You learn about all societies."
She added that she had many
interesting discussions with Asian students
about student issues as well as political
and cultural issues. This is valuable
"especially since Asia is becoming more
and more important in the world," Baek
said.
Program coordinator and Stanford
graduate Dean Orfanedes said
lightheartcd conversation is also an
effective way of talking to people and
establishing mutual understanding. "Jokes
and laughter are a good way to
communicate," Orfanedes said.
But what do the Asian students take
away from the program? And what are
their impressions of the United States and
Americans?
Many say they have a favorable
impression of the entire experience, but
there have been times when the novelty of
everything has been a bit shocking, or at
least unsettling.
Kim Younge, a Korean student,
described Americans as having a
"consuming lifestyle."
Kazutoh Ishida was struck by the very
large portions of food served in America
compared to those served in Japan.
Christopher Kim, a Korean student,
said Americans sometimes are oblivious to
what is going on in the outside world
because the United States, by its
geographic location and its status in the
world, is somewhat detached from other
nations.
As a result, Americans often are
unaware of the cultural backgrounds and
the political and economic natures of
other areas around the globe, said Kim.
"If America wants to become great, it
should become interested in other
countries," he added.
But in many respects, the Asian
students find the United States to be a
dynamic, incredible place. "Everything
here is new, exciting and live," Kosaka
said. "You can do anything!"
Beyond the Hollywoodish images sent
abroad to East Asia, the Asian students
find a wide diversity of people and a multi
faceted nation. "America is a very rich
country. I want to see different areas.
Stanford is very beautiful," Kim Younge
said.
When asked what he would want to
take back with him from the United States
to Japan, Ishida replied, "I want to bring
back everything here."
