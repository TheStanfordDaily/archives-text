## Judge delays demolitions 
### 
University officials were hit
with a temporary restraining
order yesterday that brought to a
stop their plan to demolish
Synergy and the Delta Tau Delta
house just as the demolition was
beginning.
The order, issued by Judge
Read Ambler of the Santa Clara
County Superior Court, will stay
demolition of the houses until
the court holds a hearing to
decide whether or not to grant a
temporary injunction prohibiting
the destruction of the turn-of
the-century residences. That
hearing will take place Sept. 10, a
court official said.
The Committee to Save the
Hill Houses sought the
restraining order on the ground
that the demolition permit issued
by the county last month was in
violation of the California
Environmental Quality Act,
which, among other things,
protects the integrity of historic
structures. *
That act requires that, if there
exists some element of judgment
in the issuance of a demolition
permit, the seeker of the permit
must submit either an
environmental impact report or a
document called a negative
declaration.
Environmental impact reports
can take several months to
prepare. A negative declaration
— a statement that a project will
not have adverse effects — is
open to public review and
challenge. If it can be argued that
there may be a negative effect on
the historical resources of
California, then a negative
declaration is insufficient to
allow demolition.
Members of the committee
have contended since January
that the buildings are historically
significant because of their
architecture. University officials
have disputed this claim.
The county Historical
Heritage Commission voted in
July to recommend that the
brown-shingled Synergy be
designated a state point of
historic interest. The county
Board of Supervisors, however,
overturned that recommendation
two weeks later.
University officials plan to
build faculty housing on the site
and then use the income from
that housing to construct
student residences elsewhere on
campus.
The University estimates that
repairing the former student

residences would cost $1.4
million, and that th'; University
could raise as much as $5 million
from the construction of faculty
residences, which could be
anything from single-family
residences to condominiums.
Demolition of the buildings
had been in its early stages;
workers were in the process of
removing doors and windows
from the buildings when the
restraining order was issued
yesterday morning.
Members of the committee
had kept a 24-hour vigil at the
site and conducted a reunion of
Synergy alumni there Saturday
afternoon.
Susan Schaffer, vice president
for administrative resources, said
that the restraining order is
"simply a delay" and does not
change the University's plan to
demolish the houses. She added,
however, that the setback might
cause the University to delay
demolition of the houses until
after the Centennial Celebration
in late September.
"This kind of stuff just
distracts us from some of the
bigger projects" the University is
pursuing, Schaffer said. "The

long-range interest that we're
after is securing money for
student housing."
John Hackmann, the attorney
employed by the Committee to
Save the Hill Houses, called the
University's intention to
demolish the houses short
sighted. "Anybody who sells his
capital to pay daily expenses
doesn't stay ii) business very
long," he said, saying that the
University is "assaulting its
historical heritage" in the face of
a short-term budget crisis.
Stanford Planning Director
Phil Williams has called the
efforts of the committee "selfish"
and "unproductive," saying that
spending money to repair the
houses would deprive students of
much-needed on-campus hous
ing. The University's decision, he
says, best addresses the interests
of all of those in the Stanford
community.
The Stanford Historical
Society gives both buildings a
"moderate" rating on its index of
historical significance and has
concurred in the University's
decision to demolish the
structures.

Members of the Committee to Save the Hill Houses stake out Synergy House, which was scheduled to be demolished this week. The
committee sought — and received — a restraining order to stop the destruction of both Synergy and the Delta Tau Delta house. The order
will halt demolition of the houses until a court hearing, scheduled for Sept. 10.
