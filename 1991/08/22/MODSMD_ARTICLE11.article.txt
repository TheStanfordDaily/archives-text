# USW inches toward strike
## 
### 
United Stanford Workers
passed a measure yesterday
demonstrating their willingness to
strike if the union is unable to
come to terms with the University
in current contract negotiations.
The measure, which was
approved by 88 percent of those
who attended yesterday's meeting,
authorizes the USW bargaining
team to call at any time for a vote
to strike.
Yesterday's action represents
the first in a two-step process that
would lead to a strike by the USW.
Now, if the bargaining unit calls for
a strike vote, workers may approve
the measure and walk out
immediately.
According to chief USW
negotiator Michael Tatham,
yesterday's meeting, attended by
350 of the 1,000 voting USW
members, was indicative of the
union's frustration with the
University. "People arc pissed," he
said. "We feel this is garbage."
Tatham said the University has
failed to respond to economic

issues important to the union. His
team has put its ideas "on the
table," he said, while the
University team "hasn't shown any
economic" proposals.
The University team's has not
put forth any acceptable reasons
for ignoring the USW's economic
proposals, Tatham said.
But, according to the Univer
sity's chief negotiator Michael
Vartain, "all economic items have
been discussed at some point."
"Complaints from the union
on this topic when made at the
bargaining table will be
addressed at the bargaining
table," Vartain added.
Union members at yesterday's
meeting said issues such as benefits
and job security were important.
According to David Mata, an
Operations and Maintenance
worker, "The University can't
afford to give us some of the things
we are demanding. But takeaways
— benefits and job security — are
most on our minds."
If the USW chooses to strike, it
would most likely occur during
Centennial Weekend. "That's a
time when we can get the
maximum effect," Tatham said.
