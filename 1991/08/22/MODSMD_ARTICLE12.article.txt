# New dish will aid researchers

### 
A new satellite dish purchased
by the University promises to
bring a great deal more than
cable television to Stanford
researchers.
The satellite-receiving facility,
which will be installed at Hopkins
Marine Station, will pick up
transmissions from weather
satellites, providing scientists
with crucial data on cloud cover
and underwater weather, ac
cording to Biology Prof. Jonathan
Roughgarden.
The $70,000 antenna dish
should be operating by the end of
the month, according to
Roughgarden.
The satellite dish will transmit
up to four images per day, which
will be readily available for
scientists at Hopkins.
In the past, Stanford re
searchers had to purchase such
transmissions from other
facilities, paying up to $1,000 for
a single image.
Researchers would only
receive the pictures sporadically,
and the total of 35-50 images
they received per year was not
enough to provide statistically
significant data, according to
Roughgarden.
"When you only receive about
40 images per year, you can't do
much but look at them like
snapshots," said Roughgarden.
"We kept running into
bureaucracy and we had a lot of
problems getting images." He
added that with the new satellite
dish, Stanford would not only be
saving money but would be
receiving images "correctly and
promptly."
The images will display cloud
formations and underwater
weather conditions for at least
the central California region and
will probably extend north to the
Washington border and south
almost to Los Angeles.
This information will be of
enormous importance in
Roughgarden's research, which
centers around marine popu
lations, particularly barnacles.
Using these satellite images,
researchers will be able to track
and possibly predict underwater
weather and its effects on marine
ecosystems.
By the end of the quarter,
Roughgarden hopes to put these
images on-line so they will be
accessible to the entire Stanford
community via personal com
puters.
But first, they "have to figure
out how to get the information to
people. We also have to figure out
what people want to receive,"
Roughgarden said.
Opportunities exist for

students to assist in the process
of creating software to both
interpret the incoming data and
transmit it via computer to the
community.
Two weather satellites will
pass over the antenna twice daily,
sending down four separate data
streams.
The incoming data is
collected by the satellite dish,
which — unlike regular TV
antennas with fixed positions —
has gears that allow it to move
and change direction to track
the satellite as it moves across
the sky.
Once the information is
collected, software in the
computer system separates out
the cloud data from the ocean
data by range.
The data is then arranged to
form pictures that represent
something intelligible, Rough
garden said.
After the picture is assembled,
it is still not readily under
standable because the image is
distorted.
Since satellites do not move
straight across the sky from north
to south, the incoming data may
look like it was written on rubber
and then stretched, said
Roughgarden.
Through a process called reg
istration, the picture is adjusted
so it fits onto a standard carto
graphers coordinate system and
can be more readily analyzed.
To perform these picture
assembling and interpretive
functions, the computers
attached to the satellite must be
supplied with appropriate soft
ware, much of which will be
created in-house, according to
Roughgarden.
Roughgarden said he hopes
to also develop feature
recognition functions that will
allow the computer to easily
identify underwater weather
conditions such as eddies, which
are circular currents.
This feature would greatly
reduce the amount of time
needed to analyze the data.
Funds for the satellite came
from a variety of donors,
including Roughgarden, who is
the principal investigator of the
project, Dean of Research
Robert Byer, Dean of the School
of Earth Sciences Gary Ernst,
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Ewart Thomas, Civil
Engineering Prof. Bob Street,
Civil Engineering Asst. Prof.
Jeffrey Koseff and Biology Prof.
Harold Mooney.
The satellite facility will be
attached to a computer system
given to the University by
Hewlett-Packard as a Centennial
gift. The system was chosen with
the needs of oceanographic
research in mind.
