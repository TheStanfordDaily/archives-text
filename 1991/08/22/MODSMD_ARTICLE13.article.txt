# Subcommittee probing SLAC
## 
### 
A congressional subcommittee
has asked Stanford for additional
information about allegations
that it padded claims for
earthquake damage at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla. 112
chair of the House Subcommittee
on Environment, Energy and
Natural Resources, last week
asked the University for
documentation of the earth
quake-damage claims, including
memos, notes, estimates and
itemizations.
In an Aug. 14 response,
University President Donald
Kennedy assured Synar that
Stanford would cooperate and
provide the information.
The allegations were made by
Tim Axe, a facilities engineer at
SLAC who claimed he was fired
for refusing to "pad his estimate"
of damage from the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake.
SLAC Director Burton
Richter has denied the charges of
fraud and said Axe was fired "for

just cause unrelated to the
earthquake." He has declined to
specify exactly why Axe was
terminated.
University officials ordered an
internal audit in March in
response to the charges. It was
released earlier this month and
concluded that there was no
fraud or misappropriation of
funds for earthquake repairs. It
did recommend several changes
in the way the SLAC handles
emergency repair costs.
Copies of the internal audit
have been given to the
subcommittee and to the
Department of Energy, which
owns the facility and is also
investigating the charges.
