# Foothill fire burns 12 acres
## 
### 
The Foothills came alive
Saturday when a brush fire
damaged about 12 acres of
Stanford land near the Dish.
The fire, which originally
covered three acres, was
reported at 12:45 p.m., and
about 40 firefighters were

required to put it out.
By digging a ditch around the
fire and removing shrubs and
grass from its path, firefighters
were able to control the fire
about two hours later, according
to Palo Alto Fire Chief Robert
Wall.
One firefighter suffered a
scratched cornea. He was treated
by paramedics and taken to the
hospital "for precaution," but
was sent home soon after, Wall
said. There were no other
injuries and no structural damage
to any buildings.
The cause of the fire is under
investigation. Wall said it was
probably started by a faulty
power line.
"A faulty power line gets hit or
blown by the wind and shorts
itself out, causing molten metal
or other material to fall onto the
grass and ignite," he said.
Wall added that this is a fairly
rare occurrence, especially
during the summer. "This usually
happens during winter storms,
when the wind and rain whip the
power lines around. It's rare that
it happens during the summer
calm," he said.
