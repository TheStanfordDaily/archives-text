# BLOWING THE COUP
## Stanford scholars debate the state of the Soviet Union 
### Geoff Goldman Steve McCarroll 
Mikhail Gorbachev may be back in Moscow, but the
struggle for reform in the Soviet Union is far from over,
according to many Stanford and Hoover Institution
scholars.
Many reasons for the failure of the hard-liners' coup are fairly
clear, analysts say. The ability of the people to rally to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's call was unprecedented in modern
Soviet history. Even more important, many say, was the
incompetence and lack of preparation of the coup leaders.
But what remains less certain is how the aftermath of the coup
will affect the future of Soviet domestic politics. Some scholars
see its failure as a sign of the end of communism and the
beginning of a new system of government.
Others, however, are quick to point out that the problems that
existed before the coup still remain, and that they must be
solved before reform can continue.

One cause of the coup's collapse on
which almost all the analysts agree was
the ineptitude of the coup leaders —
particularly their inability to deal with
Yeltsin.
"The coup ran out of steam," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Richard Staar.
"It didn't move immediately on the
Russian parliament" even though it had
the military power to do so, he said.
The leaders didn't think through
what was necessary to successfully
seize power, he added.
"Given the political equation in the
Soviet Union today, nobody who's
really brilliant would have attempted
the coup," said Hoover Senior Fellow
John Dunlop. "Either you have to be
Stalin — ruthlessly violent — or you
can't succeed."
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Robert Conquest said, "The only clear
thing is that it was a very primitive
coup, run by very second-rate
politicians." More important pol
iticians did not get involved because
they were "not that stupid or perhaps
not that wicked," he said.
"They could have won only by
extreme ruthlessness," Conquest said.
The coup leaders' actions were "very
ill-thought-out," he added.
Staar described the conspirators as
"Keystone Kops" who lacked the
experience they needed to pull off a
coup.
Another factor was the split in the
military, said History Prof. Alexander
Dallin. Some of the soldiers refused to
go along with the coup leaders' edicts.

The scholars consulted by
The Weekly disagreed on
the extent to which popular
resistance was a factor.
Dallin said Yeltsin's
ability to rally people in
front of the Russian
Parliament helped bring
about the coup's failure.
Dunlop agreed. "I think
[the coup leaders] mis
calculated. I don't think
they expected the strength
of the people's reaction.
Yeltsin's role was pivotal,"
he said.
Staar also praised
Yeltsin's bravery in re
sisting the coup. He "be
haved in an admirable
way," Staar said. Yeltsin
could have been killed for
calling a general strike or
saying that the coup
leaders had to be hunted
down and brought to
justice.
"This guy has guts,"
Staar added.
But Staar attributed the
coup's failure more to the

internal problems of its leaders. In
particular, he said, the leaders were
very timid. "Even the tough guys (of
the group) resigned," he added.
There was even more disagreement
among the scholars on the effec
tiveness of foreign reaction to the coup.
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill said, "International
diplomacy played an enormously
important role" in thwarting the coup.
"The coup leaders clearly thought
their action would be accepted" by the
international community, Hill said.
Along with the internal reaction of
citizens, the external response of
leaders by the Western Europe and
the United States was critical in the
undoing of the regime, Hill said.
"When I heard them trying to
convince the world-at-large of their
legitimacy, I knew they were in
trouble," he said. The coup leaders
"did not want to exclude themselves
from the larger world," he added.
For example, they "needed foreign
loans of grain to get them through the
winter," Hill said.
He said he thinks some of the coup
leaders quit when they realized they
would not get the international
recognition they thought they needed.
"The coup leaders decided that they
had to have it both ways — they had to
seize power and retain the affirmation
of the outside world," he said.
Dallin holds a different view. He
called the influence of the United
States and Western Europe marginal.
Even though "we did the right thing
and had the right kind of impact,"
there is a tendency to "exaggerate the
extent to which the outside world can
really turn the tide," he said.
"We shouldn't exaggerate the
diplomatic role," he added.
Staar also minimized the influence
outside countries may have had on the
coup leaders.
"We have very little leverage. [The
coup leaders] couldn't care less about
aid," Staar said. Furthermore, they
were already very wary of U.S.
influence on the Soviet Union.
For instance, the military was
unhappy with the recent Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty agreement to

rcducc nuclcar missiles. It felt that it
had lost prestige because of the
accord.
Both Dallin and Hill said they felt
that Bush should have spoken out
sooner to denounce the coup leaders.
Hill said, "He should have said the
coup leaders would never be accepted"
as the legitimate government of the
Soviet Union.
Overall, Hill gave the Bush
administration an "A-" for its foreign
policy conduct during the past few
days.
The end of communism?
Many analysts felt the failure of the
coup represents a serious setback for

communism in the Soviet Union.
Dorothy Atkinson, executive
director of the Stanford-based
American Association for the
Advancement of Slavic Studies, said,
"The Soviet people have had a history
of authoritarian regimes. This is
evidence of the democratic principles
that have taken hold in the Soviet
Union."

"Wc have never witnessed any type
of popular reaction on this scale" in
the Soviet Union, she added.
Dallin said the Soviet people's
desire for the return of Gorbachev to
power despite their dislike of many for
his policies showed "a remarkable
degree" of political sophistication.
The people called for him because
they wanted the legitimate govern
ment, he said. The coup leaders had
not counted on this. "They thought
they could capitalize on a general
sense of unease" due to crime and lack
of food, Dallin said.
Staar said the Communist Party is
finished in the Soviet Union. The
conspirators didn't even consider it

important enough to bring it in on the
coup, he added.
Senior Hoover Fellow Charles
McLure, who advised Yeltsin and his
aides this spring on economic policy,
said that even if the coup had
succeeded politically, it would
eventually have been brought down by
the economic forces that plagued
Gorbachev.

"The Soviet Union must
eventually abandon a planned
economy or it will spiral
downward," he said. McLure
also predicted that the failed
coup might actually hasten
reform.
"This may be very salutary
because it may speed the
process of political and
economic reform, he said. The
events of this week "remove the
threat from the right. ... I
think it will be somewhat . . .
positive.
Atkinson added: "I had the
feeling all along that this
setback (the coup) would be
temporary. The [democratic]
process would continue
inevitably."
The aftermath of the coup
But despite the potential
importance of the coup's
failure, the road to continued
reform remains full of
obstacles, analysts say.
A major problem is dealing
with the coup leaders. Many
scholars agree that Gorbachev

now has an opportunity to get rid of
some of the hard-liners.
"Without doubt there will be a
purge of the army, the KGB, the
police. . . . Some of the top guys may
just run away," Dunlop said.
"Events like this tend to trigger a
very strong reaction the other way," he
added.
Staar said he thinks there will now
be some kind of special military
tribunal to try the conspirators.
Dallin said he is surprised that
leaders of the coup weren't arrested
immediately. At the moment,
Gorbachev's power is strong enough to
get rid of people like KGB head
Vladimir Kryuchkov and Interior

Minister Boris Pugo, he added.
Several analysts said that if
Gorbachev does not take quick action
against the coup leaders, he could face
more popular opposition.
If Gorbachev starts politicking and
trying to placate some of the hard
liners, there could be "as much
hostility toward Gorbachev as before,"
Dallin said.
Even if he does take action, the fact
that six of the eight principal
committee members were appointed
by Gorbachev says something about his
judgment, Staar said.
In fact, some have speculated that
Gorbachev may have had a hand in
planning the coup. But Dunlop said, "I
doubt that very highly."
Staar said, "I don't believe it was
staged — these guys were for real."
Another major issue is the new
union treaty, which was to have been
signed Tuesday. The treaty will
transform the Soviet Union from a
centralized state to more of a
federation or confederation.
Under the new system, the central
government will be less powerful. For
example, it will not have the ability to
tax, although it will retain control over
the defense industry.
"It makes for a very fundamental
change in Soviet government,"
Atkinson said. As a result, many
consider the treaty to be the
precipitating event for Monday's coup.
Analysts agree that the union treaty
is likely to go through now. If so, they
say, a new constitution will be drawn
up within six months, and popular

elections would probably be held the
next summer.
If Yeltsin runs — and it is not clear
that he would be interested — he will
most likely defeat Gorbachev, Staar
said. It would be the "end of
[Gorbachev's] career," he added.
Staar also said Gorbachev would
probably quit the Communist party if
he decided to run in the national
election.
Even so, once the situation quiets
down, the same problems that existed
before the coup will remain, Staar said.
"The shelves are still bare."
If the union treaty goes forward,
Gorbachev will be more dependent on
the opinions of people like Yeltsin,
Dallin said. "The center will be freer
to act" but will also be permanently
weakened by the treaty.
Another change may be full
independence for the Baltic republics.
In the wake of the coup's failure,
Estonia and Latvia each declared their
independence yesterday.
While independence for the Baltics
is not a fait accompli, it is likely that
they will achieve it in the foreseeable
future, Dallin said. However, some
hard-line elements in the Supreme
Soviet may try to slow the process
down, he added.
U.S.-Soviet relations
The changes in the Soviet Union
may also have an impact on U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Dallin suggested the need for lower
level diplomacy between the two
countries. It might be helpful to
establish some kind of U.S. presence
— on a consular or trade
representative level — in the
individual republics, he said.
In addition, potential U.S. investors
will probably be more cautious about
ventures in the Soviet Union, Dallin
said. People will wait to see how stable
the government remains, he added.
The failure of the coup will also
allow a new era in arms reduction by
the superpowers to continue, said
Sidney Drell, former co-director of the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
The coup leaders were not likely to
live up to the reduction in long-ranged
Soviet missiles required under the
recently negotiated START treaty,
said Drell.
Drell now sees "a lot of reason for
optimism" for the future of U.S.-Soviet
relations and the prospect of greater
arms reduction.
"START includes a very elaborate
and comprehensive infrastructure for
verification, one that was negotiated
for over a decade," Drell said.
It is that system of verification —
even more than the missile reductions
themselves — that Drell sees as the
most important accomplishment of the
accord.
The superpowers "can now have
more arms control because the
infrastructure for verification exists.
Further reductions should be relatively
easy to come by.
"The creation of that system
depended on the building up of a
tremendous personal confidence"
among Soviet and U.S. leaders, Drell
said, calling it a relationship
characterized by "candor, honesty and
constructiveness."
"Working this out is an enormous
achievement," Drell said.

"We shouldn't exaggerate the
diplomatic role," he added.
Staar also minimized the influence
outside countries may have had on the
coup leaders.
"We have very little leverage. [The
coup leaders] couldn't care less about
aid," Staar said. Furthermore, they
were already very wary of U.S.
influence on the Soviet Union.
For instance, the military was
unhappy with the recent Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty agreement to

rcducc nuclcar missiles. It felt that it
had lost prestige because of the
accord.
Both Dallin and Hill said they felt
that Bush should have spoken out
sooner to denounce the coup leaders.
Hill said, "He should have said the
coup leaders would never be accepted"
as the legitimate government of the
Soviet Union.
Overall, Hill gave the Bush
administration an "A-" for its foreign
policy conduct during the past few
days.
The end of communism?
Many analysts felt the failure of the
coup represents a serious setback for

communism in the Soviet Union.
Dorothy Atkinson, executive
director of the Stanford-based
American Association for the
Advancement of Slavic Studies, said,
"The Soviet people have had a history
of authoritarian regimes. This is
evidence of the democratic principles
that have taken hold in the Soviet
Union."

"Wc have never witnessed any type
of popular reaction on this scale" in
the Soviet Union, she added.
Dallin said the Soviet people's
desire for the return of Gorbachev to
power despite their dislike of many for
his policies showed "a remarkable
degree" of political sophistication.
The people called for him because
they wanted the legitimate govern
ment, he said. The coup leaders had
not counted on this. "They thought
they could capitalize on a general
sense of unease" due to crime and lack
of food, Dallin said.
Staar said the Communist Party is
finished in the Soviet Union. The
conspirators didn't even consider it

important enough to bring it in on the
coup, he added.
Senior Hoover Fellow Charles
McLure, who advised Yeltsin and his
aides this spring on economic policy,
said that even if the coup had
succeeded politically, it would
eventually have been brought down by
the economic forces that plagued
Gorbachev.

"The Soviet Union must
eventually abandon a planned
economy or it will spiral
downward," he said. McLure
also predicted that the failed
coup might actually hasten
reform.
"This may be very salutary
because it may speed the
process of political and
economic reform, he said. The
events of this week "remove the
threat from the right. ... I
think it will be somewhat . . .
positive.
Atkinson added: "I had the
feeling all along that this
setback (the coup) would be
temporary. The [democratic]
process would continue
inevitably."
The aftermath of the coup
But despite the potential
importance of the coup's
failure, the road to continued
reform remains full of
obstacles, analysts say.
A major problem is dealing
with the coup leaders. Many
scholars agree that Gorbachev

now has an opportunity to get rid of
some of the hard-liners.
"Without doubt there will be a
purge of the army, the KGB, the
police. . . . Some of the top guys may
just run away," Dunlop said.
"Events like this tend to trigger a
very strong reaction the other way," he
added.
Staar said he thinks there will now
be some kind of special military
tribunal to try the conspirators.
Dallin said he is surprised that
leaders of the coup weren't arrested
immediately. At the moment,
Gorbachev's power is strong enough to
get rid of people like KGB head
Vladimir Kryuchkov and Interior

Minister Boris Pugo, he added.
Several analysts said that if
Gorbachev does not take quick action
against the coup leaders, he could face
more popular opposition.
If Gorbachev starts politicking and
trying to placate some of the hard
liners, there could be "as much
hostility toward Gorbachev as before,"
Dallin said.
Even if he does take action, the fact
that six of the eight principal
committee members were appointed
by Gorbachev says something about his
judgment, Staar said.
In fact, some have speculated that
Gorbachev may have had a hand in
planning the coup. But Dunlop said, "I
doubt that very highly."
Staar said, "I don't believe it was
staged — these guys were for real."
Another major issue is the new
union treaty, which was to have been
signed Tuesday. The treaty will
transform the Soviet Union from a
centralized state to more of a
federation or confederation.
Under the new system, the central
government will be less powerful. For
example, it will not have the ability to
tax, although it will retain control over
the defense industry.
"It makes for a very fundamental
change in Soviet government,"
Atkinson said. As a result, many
consider the treaty to be the
precipitating event for Monday's coup.
Analysts agree that the union treaty
is likely to go through now. If so, they
say, a new constitution will be drawn
up within six months, and popular

elections would probably be held the
next summer.
If Yeltsin runs — and it is not clear
that he would be interested — he will
most likely defeat Gorbachev, Staar
said. It would be the "end of
[Gorbachev's] career," he added.
Staar also said Gorbachev would
probably quit the Communist party if
he decided to run in the national
election.
Even so, once the situation quiets
down, the same problems that existed
before the coup will remain, Staar said.
"The shelves are still bare."
If the union treaty goes forward,
Gorbachev will be more dependent on
the opinions of people like Yeltsin,
Dallin said. "The center will be freer
to act" but will also be permanently
weakened by the treaty.
Another change may be full
independence for the Baltic republics.
In the wake of the coup's failure,
Estonia and Latvia each declared their
independence yesterday.
While independence for the Baltics
is not a fait accompli, it is likely that
they will achieve it in the foreseeable
future, Dallin said. However, some
hard-line elements in the Supreme
Soviet may try to slow the process
down, he added.
U.S.-Soviet relations
The changes in the Soviet Union
may also have an impact on U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Dallin suggested the need for lower
level diplomacy between the two
countries. It might be helpful to
establish some kind of U.S. presence
— on a consular or trade
representative level — in the
individual republics, he said.
In addition, potential U.S. investors
will probably be more cautious about
ventures in the Soviet Union, Dallin
said. People will wait to see how stable
the government remains, he added.
The failure of the coup will also
allow a new era in arms reduction by
the superpowers to continue, said
Sidney Drell, former co-director of the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
The coup leaders were not likely to
live up to the reduction in long-ranged
Soviet missiles required under the
recently negotiated START treaty,
said Drell.
Drell now sees "a lot of reason for
optimism" for the future of U.S.-Soviet
relations and the prospect of greater
arms reduction.
"START includes a very elaborate
and comprehensive infrastructure for
verification, one that was negotiated
for over a decade," Drell said.
It is that system of verification —
even more than the missile reductions
themselves — that Drell sees as the
most important accomplishment of the
accord.
The superpowers "can now have
more arms control because the
infrastructure for verification exists.
Further reductions should be relatively
easy to come by.
"The creation of that system
depended on the building up of a
tremendous personal confidence"
among Soviet and U.S. leaders, Drell
said, calling it a relationship
characterized by "candor, honesty and
constructiveness."
"Working this out is an enormous
achievement," Drell said.

Dorothy Atkinson, executive
director of the American
Association for the
Advancement of Slavic Studies,
calls the resistance to the coup
"an event of historic
proportions." She says that the
unprecedented scale of the
resistance movement is
"evidence that democratic
principles have taken hold in the
Soviet Union."
Mikhail Gorbachev may be back in Moscow, but the
struggle for reform in the Soviet Union is far from over,
according to many Stanford and Hoover Institution
scholars.
Many reasons for the failure of the hard-liners' coup are fairly
clear, analysts say. The ability of the people to rally to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's call was unprecedented in modern
Soviet history. Even more important, many say, was the
incompetence and lack of preparation of the coup leaders.
But what remains less certain is how the aftermath of the coup
will affect the future of Soviet domestic politics. Some scholars
see its failure as a sign of the end of communism and the
beginning of a new system of government.
Others, however, are quick to point out that the problems that
existed before the coup still remain, and that they must be
solved before reform can continue.

One cause of the coup's collapse on
which almost all the analysts agree was
the ineptitude of the coup leaders —
particularly their inability to deal with
Yeltsin.
"The coup ran out of steam," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Richard Staar.
"It didn't move immediately on the
Russian parliament" even though it had
the military power to do so, he said.
The leaders didn't think through
what was necessary to successfully
seize power, he added.
"Given the political equation in the
Soviet Union today, nobody who's
really brilliant would have attempted
the coup," said Hoover Senior Fellow
John Dunlop. "Either you have to be
Stalin — ruthlessly violent — or you
can't succeed."
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Robert Conquest said, "The only clear
thing is that it was a very primitive
coup, run by very second-rate
politicians." More important pol
iticians did not get involved because
they were "not that stupid or perhaps
not that wicked," he said.
"They could have won only by
extreme ruthlessness," Conquest said.
The coup leaders' actions were "very
ill-thought-out," he added.
Staar described the conspirators as
"Keystone Kops" who lacked the
experience they needed to pull off a
coup.
Another factor was the split in the
military, said History Prof. Alexander
Dallin. Some of the soldiers refused to
go along with the coup leaders' edicts.

The scholars consulted by
The Weekly disagreed on
the extent to which popular
resistance was a factor.
Dallin said Yeltsin's
ability to rally people in
front of the Russian
Parliament helped bring
about the coup's failure.
Dunlop agreed. "I think
[the coup leaders] mis
calculated. I don't think
they expected the strength
of the people's reaction.
Yeltsin's role was pivotal,"
he said.
Staar also praised
Yeltsin's bravery in re
sisting the coup. He "be
haved in an admirable
way," Staar said. Yeltsin
could have been killed for
calling a general strike or
saying that the coup
leaders had to be hunted
down and brought to
justice.
"This guy has guts,"
Staar added.
But Staar attributed the
coup's failure more to the

internal problems of its leaders. In
particular, he said, the leaders were
very timid. "Even the tough guys (of
the group) resigned," he added.
There was even more disagreement
among the scholars on the effec
tiveness of foreign reaction to the coup.
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill said, "International
diplomacy played an enormously
important role" in thwarting the coup.
"The coup leaders clearly thought
their action would be accepted" by the
international community, Hill said.
Along with the internal reaction of
citizens, the external response of
leaders by the Western Europe and
the United States was critical in the
undoing of the regime, Hill said.
"When I heard them trying to
convince the world-at-large of their
legitimacy, I knew they were in
trouble," he said. The coup leaders
"did not want to exclude themselves
from the larger world," he added.
For example, they "needed foreign
loans of grain to get them through the
winter," Hill said.
He said he thinks some of the coup
leaders quit when they realized they
would not get the international
recognition they thought they needed.
"The coup leaders decided that they
had to have it both ways — they had to
seize power and retain the affirmation
of the outside world," he said.
Dallin holds a different view. He
called the influence of the United
States and Western Europe marginal.
Even though "we did the right thing
and had the right kind of impact,"
there is a tendency to "exaggerate the
extent to which the outside world can
really turn the tide," he said.
"We shouldn't exaggerate the
diplomatic role," he added.
Staar also minimized the influence
outside countries may have had on the
coup leaders.
"We have very little leverage. [The
coup leaders] couldn't care less about
aid," Staar said. Furthermore, they
were already very wary of U.S.
influence on the Soviet Union.
For instance, the military was
unhappy with the recent Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty agreement to

rcducc nuclcar missiles. It felt that it
had lost prestige because of the
accord.
Both Dallin and Hill said they felt
that Bush should have spoken out
sooner to denounce the coup leaders.
Hill said, "He should have said the
coup leaders would never be accepted"
as the legitimate government of the
Soviet Union.
Overall, Hill gave the Bush
administration an "A-" for its foreign
policy conduct during the past few

example, it will not have the ability to
tax, although it will retain control over
the defense industry.
"It makes for a very fundamental
change in Soviet government,"
Atkinson said. As a result, many
consider the treaty to be the
precipitating event for Monday's coup.
Analysts agree that the union treaty
is likely to go through now. If so, they
say, a new constitution will be drawn
up within six months, and popular

elections would probably be held the
next summer.
If Yeltsin runs — and it is not clear
that he would be interested — he will
most likely defeat Gorbachev, Staar
said. It would be the "end of
[Gorbachev's] career," he added.
Staar also said Gorbachev would
probably quit the Communist party if
he decided to run in the national
election.
Even so, once the situation quiets
down, the same problems that existed
before the coup will remain, Staar said.
"The shelves are still bare."
If the union treaty goes forward,
Gorbachev will be more dependent on
the opinions of people like Yeltsin,
Dallin said. "The center will be freer
to act" but will also be permanently
weakened by the treaty.
Another change may be full
independence for the Baltic republics.
In the wake of the coup's failure,
Estonia and Latvia each declared their
independence yesterday.
While independence for the Baltics
is not a fait accompli, it is likely that
they will achieve it in the foreseeable
future, Dallin said. However, some
hard-line elements in the Supreme
Soviet may try to slow the process
down, he added.
U.S.-Soviet relations
The changes in the Soviet Union
may also have an impact on U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Dallin suggested the need for lower
level diplomacy between the two
countries. It might be helpful to
establish some kind of U.S. presence
— on a consular or trade
representative level — in the
individual republics, he said.
In addition, potential U.S. investors
will probably be more cautious about
ventures in the Soviet Union, Dallin
said. People will wait to see how stable
the government remains, he added.
The failure of the coup will also
allow a new era in arms reduction by
the superpowers to continue, said
Sidney Drell, former co-director of the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
The coup leaders were not likely to
live up to the reduction in long-ranged
Soviet missiles required under the
recently negotiated START treaty,
said Drell.
Drell now sees "a lot of reason for
optimism" for the future of U.S.-Soviet
relations and the prospect of greater
arms reduction.
"START includes a very elaborate
and comprehensive infrastructure for
verification, one that was negotiated
for over a decade," Drell said.
It is that system of verification —
even more than the missile reductions
themselves — that Drell sees as the
most important accomplishment of the
accord.
The superpowers "can now have
more arms control because the
infrastructure for verification exists.
Further reductions should be relatively
easy to come by.
"The creation of that system
depended on the building up of a
tremendous personal confidence"
among Soviet and U.S. leaders, Drell
said, calling it a relationship
characterized by "candor, honesty and
constructiveness."
"Working this out is an enormous
achievement," Drell said.

Dorothy Atkinson, executive
director of the American
Association for the
Advancement of Slavic Studies,
calls the resistance to the coup
"an event of historic
proportions." She says that the
unprecedented scale of the
resistance movement is
"evidence that democratic
principles have taken hold in the
Soviet Union."
Mikhail Gorbachev may be back in Moscow, but the
struggle for reform in the Soviet Union is far from over,
according to many Stanford and Hoover Institution
scholars.
Many reasons for the failure of the hard-liners' coup are fairly
clear, analysts say. The ability of the people to rally to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's call was unprecedented in modern
Soviet history. Even more important, many say, was the
incompetence and lack of preparation of the coup leaders.
But what remains less certain is how the aftermath of the coup
will affect the future of Soviet domestic politics. Some scholars
see its failure as a sign of the end of communism and the
beginning of a new system of government.
Others, however, are quick to point out that the problems that
existed before the coup still remain, and that they must be
solved before reform can continue.

One cause of the coup's collapse on
which almost all the analysts agree was
the ineptitude of the coup leaders —
particularly their inability to deal with
Yeltsin.
"The coup ran out of steam," said
Hoover Senior Fellow Richard Staar.
"It didn't move immediately on the
Russian parliament" even though it had
the military power to do so, he said.
The leaders didn't think through
what was necessary to successfully
seize power, he added.
"Given the political equation in the
Soviet Union today, nobody who's
really brilliant would have attempted
the coup," said Hoover Senior Fellow
John Dunlop. "Either you have to be
Stalin — ruthlessly violent — or you
can't succeed."
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Robert Conquest said, "The only clear
thing is that it was a very primitive
coup, run by very second-rate
politicians." More important pol
iticians did not get involved because
they were "not that stupid or perhaps
not that wicked," he said.
"They could have won only by
extreme ruthlessness," Conquest said.
The coup leaders' actions were "very
ill-thought-out," he added.
Staar described the conspirators as
"Keystone Kops" who lacked the
experience they needed to pull off a
coup.
Another factor was the split in the
military, said History Prof. Alexander
Dallin. Some of the soldiers refused to
go along with the coup leaders' edicts.

The scholars consulted by
The Weekly disagreed on
the extent to which popular
resistance was a factor.
Dallin said Yeltsin's
ability to rally people in
front of the Russian
Parliament helped bring
about the coup's failure.
Dunlop agreed. "I think
[the coup leaders] mis
calculated. I don't think
they expected the strength
of the people's reaction.
Yeltsin's role was pivotal,"
he said.
Staar also praised
Yeltsin's bravery in re
sisting the coup. He "be
haved in an admirable
way," Staar said. Yeltsin
could have been killed for
calling a general strike or
saying that the coup
leaders had to be hunted
down and brought to
justice.
"This guy has guts,"
Staar added.
But Staar attributed the
coup's failure more to the

internal problems of its leaders. In
particular, he said, the leaders were
very timid. "Even the tough guys (of
the group) resigned," he added.
There was even more disagreement
among the scholars on the effec
tiveness of foreign reaction to the coup.
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill said, "International
diplomacy played an enormously
important role" in thwarting the coup.
"The coup leaders clearly thought
their action would be accepted" by the
international community, Hill said.
Along with the internal reaction of
citizens, the external response of
leaders by the Western Europe and
the United States was critical in the
undoing of the regime, Hill said.
"When I heard them trying to
convince the world-at-large of their
legitimacy, I knew they were in
trouble," he said. The coup leaders
"did not want to exclude themselves
from the larger world," he added.
For example, they "needed foreign
loans of grain to get them through the
winter," Hill said.
He said he thinks some of the coup
leaders quit when they realized they
would not get the international
recognition they thought they needed.
"The coup leaders decided that they
had to have it both ways — they had to
seize power and retain the affirmation
of the outside world," he said.
Dallin holds a different view. He
called the influence of the United
States and Western Europe marginal.
Even though "we did the right thing
and had the right kind of impact,"
there is a tendency to "exaggerate the
extent to which the outside world can
really turn the tide," he said.
"We shouldn't exaggerate the
diplomatic role," he added.
Staar also minimized the influence
outside countries may have had on the
coup leaders.
"We have very little leverage. [The
coup leaders] couldn't care less about
aid," Staar said. Furthermore, they
were already very wary of U.S.
influence on the Soviet Union.
For instance, the military was
unhappy with the recent Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty agreement to

rcducc nuclcar missiles. It felt that it
had lost prestige because of the
accord.
Both Dallin and Hill said they felt
that Bush should have spoken out
sooner to denounce the coup leaders.
Hill said, "He should have said the
coup leaders would never be accepted"
as the legitimate government of the
Soviet Union.
Overall, Hill gave the Bush
administration an "A-" for its foreign
policy conduct during the past few
days.
The end of communism?
Many analysts felt the failure of the
coup represents a serious setback for

communism in the Soviet Union.
Dorothy Atkinson, executive
director of the Stanford-based
American Association for the
Advancement of Slavic Studies, said,
"The Soviet people have had a history
of authoritarian regimes. This is
evidence of the democratic principles
that have taken hold in the Soviet
Union."

"Wc have never witnessed any type
of popular reaction on this scale" in
the Soviet Union, she added.
Dallin said the Soviet people's
desire for the return of Gorbachev to
power despite their dislike of many for
his policies showed "a remarkable
degree" of political sophistication.
The people called for him because
they wanted the legitimate govern
ment, he said. The coup leaders had
not counted on this. "They thought
they could capitalize on a general
sense of unease" due to crime and lack
of food, Dallin said.
Staar said the Communist Party is
finished in the Soviet Union. The
conspirators didn't even consider it

important enough to bring it in on the
coup, he added.
Senior Hoover Fellow Charles
McLure, who advised Yeltsin and his
aides this spring on economic policy,
said that even if the coup had
succeeded politically, it would
eventually have been brought down by
the economic forces that plagued
Gorbachev.

"The Soviet Union must
eventually abandon a planned
economy or it will spiral
downward," he said. McLure
also predicted that the failed
coup might actually hasten
reform.
"This may be very salutary
because it may speed the
process of political and
economic reform, he said. The
events of this week "remove the
threat from the right. ... I
think it will be somewhat . . .
positive.
Atkinson added: "I had the
feeling all along that this
setback (the coup) would be
temporary. The [democratic]
process would continue
inevitably."
The aftermath of the coup
But despite the potential
importance of the coup's
failure, the road to continued
reform remains full of
obstacles, analysts say.
A major problem is dealing
with the coup leaders. Many
scholars agree that Gorbachev

now has an opportunity to get rid of
some of the hard-liners.
"Without doubt there will be a
purge of the army, the KGB, the
police. . . . Some of the top guys may
just run away," Dunlop said.
"Events like this tend to trigger a
very strong reaction the other way," he
added.
Staar said he thinks there will now
be some kind of special military
tribunal to try the conspirators.
Dallin said he is surprised that
leaders of the coup weren't arrested
immediately. At the moment,
Gorbachev's power is strong enough to
get rid of people like KGB head
Vladimir Kryuchkov and Interior

Minister Boris Pugo, he added.
Several analysts said that if
Gorbachev does not take quick action
against the coup leaders, he could face
more popular opposition.
If Gorbachev starts politicking and
trying to placate some of the hard
liners, there could be "as much
hostility toward Gorbachev as before,"
Dallin said.
Even if he does take action, the fact
that six of the eight principal
committee members were appointed
by Gorbachev says something about his
judgment, Staar said.
In fact, some have speculated that
Gorbachev may have had a hand in
planning the coup. But Dunlop said, "I
doubt that very highly."
Staar said, "I don't believe it was
staged — these guys were for real."
Another major issue is the new
union treaty, which was to have been
signed Tuesday. The treaty will
transform the Soviet Union from a
centralized state to more of a
federation or confederation.
Under the new system, the central
government will be less powerful. For
example, it will not have the ability to
tax, although it will retain control over
the defense industry.
"It makes for a very fundamental
change in Soviet government,"
Atkinson said. As a result, many
consider the treaty to be the
precipitating event for Monday's coup.
Analysts agree that the union treaty
is likely to go through now. If so, they
say, a new constitution will be drawn
up within six months, and popular

elections would probably be held the
next summer.
If Yeltsin runs — and it is not clear
that he would be interested — he will
most likely defeat Gorbachev, Staar
said. It would be the "end of
[Gorbachev's] career," he added.
Staar also said Gorbachev would
probably quit the Communist party if
he decided to run in the national
election.
Even so, once the situation quiets
down, the same problems that existed
before the coup will remain, Staar said.
"The shelves are still bare."
If the union treaty goes forward,
Gorbachev will be more dependent on
the opinions of people like Yeltsin,
Dallin said. "The center will be freer
to act" but will also be permanently
weakened by the treaty.
Another change may be full
independence for the Baltic republics.
In the wake of the coup's failure,
Estonia and Latvia each declared their
independence yesterday.
While independence for the Baltics
is not a fait accompli, it is likely that
they will achieve it in the foreseeable
future, Dallin said. However, some
hard-line elements in the Supreme
Soviet may try to slow the process
down, he added.
U.S.-Soviet relations
The changes in the Soviet Union
may also have an impact on U.S.-
Soviet relations.
Dallin suggested the need for lower
level diplomacy between the two
countries. It might be helpful to
establish some kind of U.S. presence
— on a consular or trade
representative level — in the
individual republics, he said.
In addition, potential U.S. investors
will probably be more cautious about
ventures in the Soviet Union, Dallin
said. People will wait to see how stable
the government remains, he added.
The failure of the coup will also
allow a new era in arms reduction by
the superpowers to continue, said
Sidney Drell, former co-director of the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
The coup leaders were not likely to
live up to the reduction in long-ranged
Soviet missiles required under the
recently negotiated START treaty,
said Drell.
Drell now sees "a lot of reason for
optimism" for the future of U.S.-Soviet
relations and the prospect of greater
arms reduction.
"START includes a very elaborate

verification, one that was negotiated
for over a decade," Drell said.
It is that system of verification —
even more than the missile reductions
themselves — that Drell sees as the
most important accomplishment of the
accord.
The superpowers "can now have
more arms control because the
infrastructure for verification exists.
Further reductions should be relatively
easy to come by.

depended on the building up of a
tremendous personal confidence"
among Soviet and U.S. leaders, Drell
said, calling it a relationship
characterized by "candor, honesty and

"Working this out is an enormous
