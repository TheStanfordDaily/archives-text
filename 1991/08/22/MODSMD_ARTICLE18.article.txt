## Tennis tour teaches Graham it's time to go 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Debbie Graham has learned a
lot in school over the past three
years. But it's what she learned on
the professional tennis tour this
summer that convinced her it was
time to say farewell to NCAA
competition
"I weighed the pros and cons
and figured out what 1 could get out
of college tennis," Graham says."I
don't know if it would make a
difference for me."
Actually, she adds, her main
concern was that, after working to
compete against top competition all
summer, she might lose ground.
"I'm on such an upswing right
now," Graham says."I didn't want
to go back and regress.
"It would be really difficult to
return to that level. I'd be basically
looking at Lisa Albano as my
competition." Albano, an NCAA
singles finalist in 1991 and the
player who defeated Graham in her
last collegiate match, is a fine
college player but could hardly
challenge Graham the way, for
instance, Gabriela Sabatini has.
There has also been a significant
change in the way Graham
approaches matches. At Stanford,
she played defensively; now, she's
on the offensive. "I'm the person
everyone is after (in college
tennis)," she says. "I'm going to be
playing not to lose." On the pro
circuit, though, she's the upwardly
mobile youngster trying to make a
name for herself.
"I go out and get to use
everything I have," Graham says. In
particular, she is employing the
serve-and-volley game she worked
so hard on at school. Graham says
she uses the attack style about two
thirds of the time.
The results have been
astounding. After cracking the top
100 at the French Open, Graham
began a solid climb that has her
ranked 49th in the world entering
the U.S. Open, which begins Mon
day in Flushing Meadows, N.Y.

Emotionally, she is flying high.
But that doesn't mean the
decision to turn pro was an easy
one. "For sure, if I had not won a
team title and an individual title, I
would have come back," Graham
says. "But we've already won three
team titles and I've won an
individual title. No one is going to
take that away."
Still, she says she was concerned
with "letting the team down. That
was the biggest thing on my mind. I
felt I had made this commitment to
Stanford to play for four years."
While coach Frank Brennan would
have loved to have her back, he is
expressing only best wishes for her.
Brennan says he's concerned
about three things when players
turn pro: their health, their pro
potential and the fact that they
won't have their degree. In
Graham's case, none present a
problem, Brennan says.
Graham is going to attend
school in the fall and should
graduate by the end of autumn
quarter, she had a shoulder
problem which is almost completely
healed, and, as Brennan has noted
in the past, she has a legitimate
shot at reaching the top 10.
Interestingly enough, that's the
ranking Graham hopes to attain by
the end of 1992. She has made it
her "major goal. "It's something I
have to do to make myself work
hard," she says.
In the meantime, she's enjoying
being right where she is. Her first
pro tournament, last week in Los
Angeles, ended with a 6-3, 6-1,
third-round loss to Sabatini but she
calls it a "confidence booster."
She learned in the Sabatini
match, "I hit the ball harder than
her. I serve so much harder than
her," Graham says. "She's not that
good." Nerves cost Graham,
though, who at point was a point
away from taking a 4-3 lead.
Sabatini instead won nine of the
last 10 games.
If Graham heeds the lesson,
maybe next time she'll do the
teaching.
