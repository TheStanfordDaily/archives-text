Sports writers often fail to
understand that they aren't
the story. Constantly, they tell
you about their work experiences
â€” as if you could care less. That
said, I have a sports writing story to
tell.
Hopefully, it will provide you
with some insight and avoid the
trap of self-indulgence. (If not, too
bad.)

The idea was to look forward a few
years to a time when some of our
fellow students, in this case a few
select athletes, had become
famous. One of the segments read
something like this:
The young upstart removes
her visor to wipe the
perspiration from her brow.
It's 90-plus degrees in Flushing
Meadows today and the humidity is
unbearable.
New York is always a miserable
place to be around Labor Day.
Still, there's not a single empty seat
in Louis Armstrong Stadium. It's
the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open
and the crowd has begun to cheer
for the underdog.
Across the net is Monica Seles,
the No. 2 seed. She's already
fought off two match points and is
about to face another. The upstart
has a half-dozen aces on the day
and could reach the semis if she
can serve up one more.The ball

boy bounces one ball to the server,
then another. She tosses, rocks and
smashes a bullet straight up the
middle. Seles lunges but can barely
put a racket on it. The upset it
complete. Debbie Graham has
defeated Monica Seles.
Debbie Graluim. I knew her when
she played No. 4 singles for the
Cardinal.
When those words were
written, Graham was due
to play two more years of
college tennis. She had just won an
NCAA singles championship and
seemed fully capable of winning
two more.
About the farthest thing from
her mind at the time was turning
professional and leaving school
early. She had a successful summer
that year and improved her ranking
impressively. Still, she was in no
hurry. Pro tennis could wait.
This spring, though, things
began to change. Graham reached
the third round of the French
Open and entered the top 100 in
the world. Two weeks later, she
lost her first match at Wimbledon
and her ranking dropped.
That would prove to be a
temporary setback, however.
Graham started to win early and
often in regular tour events. Her
ranking moved into the 90s . . .
then the 80s . . . then the 60s.
Before turning pro at the Los
Angeles Slims event last week, she

was up to No. 52 in the world.
If Graham beats Seles two
weeks from now, it will still be an
upset. It will not, however, be the
dramatic moment I envisioned
back then. Graham is an up-and
comer, to be sure, but in a sense
she has already arrived.
For those who have watched
her, none of this comes as a real
surprise. It is obvious that Graham
is a dangerous force on the tennis
court: big serve, powerful
groundstrokes, great height,
excellent speed.
Actually, that last one is
somewhat controversial. Because
she's so tall and takes such big
strides, people assume Graham
isn't that fast. They're wrong, of
course. Her nickname on the
Stanford team was "The Claw,"
earned by the fact that no shot

escapes her grasp.
See the ball hit to the right. See
Debbie run and return it. See the
ball hit to the left. See Debbie run
and return it. And so on. Many a
frustrated opponent can tell you
just how quick Graham is.
Everyone knows how strong. I
remember back in Gainesville,
Fla., at the NCAA Championships
in 1989. Graham was playing
doubles with Sandra Birch.
One of their opponents hit a
soft shot midway down the alley.
Graham wound up her racket, met
the ball and simply crushed it.
Almost before she had completed
her follow through, the ball was
banging into the fence on the other
side of the net.
Just another winner for
Graham. Just maybe as hard as any
woman has hit a ball anywhere.
Ever.
In three days, she will turn 21.
That makes her a late bloomer in a
tennis world dominated by teens.
But that won't keep her out of the
top-10.
And if Graham wins a few
matches next week at Flushing
Meadows a lot of people are going
to be asking a lot of questions.
"Who is this Graham kid?"
"Where did she come from?"
Me, I'll be sitting there,
watching my friend Debbie
Graham on her climb toward the
top, thinking to myself, "1 knew her
