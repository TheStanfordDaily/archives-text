## Take a break from the high-tech world at the Palo Alto arts festival 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Dare to waste a little time this
weekend at the Palo Alto
Celebrates the Arts Festival on
University Avenue.
With technological advances
and the fast pace of life today, it
seems like certain things just
aren't important anymore. Like
talking to people face to face,
sitting down for a carefully
prepared meal, appreciating
hand-crafted goods and taking
time to ponder original artwork.
We don't need to see
performers live anymore. Their
compact discs and music videos
are better. And who needs
theater when you can go to the
movies or rent a video?
I disagree. I think my time will
be well spent at the Palo Alto
Arts Festival, because I like to
deal with people in person.
That's what this fair is all about:
getting to know artists while you
enjoy their work. You'll also find
things like slow-cooked spaghetti
sauce, hand-knitted sweaters and
sculpted objects you can't
identify but that somehow
remind you of something. And
don't forget the live jazz.
Thousands of people attend
the arts festival each year. So it's
no secret that this is not some
small-time, snoozer of a county
fair where, while you may meet a
few interesting people and maybe
find a funky earring or two, the
most exciting thing around is the
giant cow — and even it's
sleeping.
Now in its 10th year, the arts
festival is traditionally an
extravaganza, with nearly 300
artists and craftspersons
displaying their work, continuous
musical entertainment, outdoor
garden cafes and wine tasting.
Hailed by many as one of the
finest outdoor arts and crafts
exhibitions on the West Coast,
Palo Alto's festival is sure to have
something for everyone to enjoy.

Both innovative and
traditional arts and crafts will be
on display, including sculpture,
paintings, jewelry, stained glass,
weavings, ceramics, photographs,
textile designs, masks, leather
work, pottery, lithographs and
handcrafted woodworking —
definitely a wide variety of high
quality, unique finds for
collectors, decorators and
gift-seekers.
But even more valuable is the
rare opportunity the festival
presents to talk to the artists and
craftspersons displaying their
work. You can hear their stories
about what inspires them, their
special techniques, and more. For
example, Saratoga photographer
Jan Young will tell interested
festival-goers of her annual trips
to the Australian outback and
how she has been caught in flash
floods and quicksand while
pursuing the perfect angle.
These dedicated artists and
craftspersons want to share their
work and ideas. Interesting
conversations with them are
guaranteed. Young says, "It's
nice when people see my work,
and they feel something. Nature
photography is my way of seeing
the world . . . that it's a
wonderful place to live."
The festival will also be "an
excellent place to order custom
work," as Monte Pfyl, a stained
glass artist, points out. Many
artists are glad to discuss special
requests, so if you like someone's
style and have a particular thing
in mind, don't be shy. There will
be artists and craftspersons from
all over California, in addition to

a select few from Seattle,
Portland, Ore., and Phoenix.
The festival's lineup of live
entertainment is equally worth
coming out for. Featuring a
number of jazz artists —
performing their unique brand of
music that simply must be heard
live — and a musical theater
presentation, these performances
are sure to make the festival
memorable.
Daniel "Stickman" Kane will
open up on the main stage
Saturday at 10 a.m. He will be
followed by Steve Seskin and
Friends, singing duo Body &
Soul, jazz vocalist Madeline
Eastman — recently a featured
performer and faculty member at
the Stanford Jazz Workshop —
and the San Francisco All-Star
Big Band with vocalist Sweetie
Mitchell. The big band will play
from 3 to 6 p.m. for the annual
Tea Dance,which includes an
open swing dance competition at
4 p.m. Trophies will be awarded
to the best ballroom/swing
couple.
Sunday will start out with
guitar duo Bartron/Tyler,
followed by the Peter Lamson
Quartet. Jazz vocalist Diane
Withcrspoon will take the stage
at noon, and then dynamic jazz,
blues and soul singer Faye Carol
will keep the music coming.
Carol, a popular Bay Area

performer, also recently
appeared at Stanford through the
Stanford Jazz Workshop.
Closing the festival will be
accomplished jazz saxophone
player/singer Joe Askew and the
Dick Whittington Trio.
The Theatre Works cast of "O'
Pioneers!" — a musical theater
adaptation of Willa Cather's
classic novel of the American
prairie — will perform selections
from that show at 2:45 p.m.
Sunday.
It's a good idea to plan on
coming hungry, as there will be
five outdoor cafes along the
University Avenue festival route,
several Palo Alto restaurants
nearby and booths with gourmet
fair food vendors. The cafes,
complete with sun umbrellas, will
feature cuisine ranging from
Peking prawns to blackened
shrimp, pizza to pasta and beef
kebabs to Korean barbecue beef.
The cafes will also showcase
special wines from six different
vintners, and the Webster Street
Cafe will feature the jazz piano
playing of Palo Alto native Dick
Fregulia, regular entertainer at

San Francisco's Washington
Square Bar and Grill.
There will even be a spot just
for kids at the festival: Berryland.
Located at Tasso Plaza,
Berryland will feature the happy
Miss Strawberry Shortcake and
her best friend Blueberry Muffin
frolicking in their world of
sunbeams, berries and friendly
animals.
So leave your telephone,
computer, microwave, CD player,
television and VCR, and come
have some impractical fun with
real people. And hey, if you feel
insecure about it, maybe we can
start a support group....

University Avenue will be closed to
traffic from 2 a.m. on Saturday
until midnight Sunday. Cross
streets Emerson, Bryant, Ramona
and Cowper will be closed at
University to through traffic from 9
a.m. to 9 p.m. each day. Waverly,
Kipling and Florence streets will be
closed at University for the entire
weekend. High and Webster streets
will be open to traffic.
