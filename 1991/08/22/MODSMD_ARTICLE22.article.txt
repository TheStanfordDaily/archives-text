# Energetic 'Broadway' shines
## 
### William Thomas Staff writer 
The best one can expect from
Broadway these days is cardboard
glamour. The actors are all
hurrying to Hollywood and to
their Yale reunions. Not only
that, but all the fairy tales have
Freudian undertones, and all the
love stories deal with either cross
dressing espionage or deformed,
pedophilic organists. It certainly
is easy to think that the whole
damn thing is a little frayed
around the edges these days.
Maybe the first 15 minutes of
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway"
would concur with this, but I was
busy discussing the bankruptcy of
the Daily Californian, UC-
Berkeley's paper, and missed
out. This was clearly a mistake.
Robbins, the show's director
and choreographer, has been
working with Broadway shows for
longer than my 21 years. He has
received five Tony awards, two
Academy Awards and the
National Medal of Art (one of
Rockin' Ron Reagan's better
moves).
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway"
showcases the range of
experience and humor that led to
these honors. From acrobatic
timing in "Comedy Tonight" (the
overture to "A Funny Thing

Happened on the Way to the
Forum") to graceful jazz-ballet
dancing in "Suite of Dances from
West Side Story," to the slapstick
schtick of "On a Sunday by the
Sea," Robbins' effervescence
pervades the venue.
Perhaps the biggest shocker of
the show is the risque "You
Gotta Have A Gimmick," in
which a naive female singer is
taught the how-to's of stripping
by her more experienced co
workers.
A stunning solo performance
of "Mr. Monotony" by Leilani
Jones provides an unexpected
and welcome break from the fast
paced, action-packed leaping and
dancing of the other Broadway
fragments. Before "Jerome
Robbins' Broadway," this
number had actually never been
performed on Broadway.
And the list goes on and on
and on. This show gives the work
of an all-time great of the
Broadway musical an
opportunity to be shown all at
once. It goes without saying that
Broadway is cardboard glamour.
Indeed, "Jerome Robbins'
Broadway" never claims to be
anything but the highest, most
enjoyable form of such kitsch. As
for fraying around the edges,
well, maybe that's somebody
else's Broadway.


The cast of "Jerome Robbin's Broadway" salutes the talent and experience of Robbins, whose
countless Broadway shows are represented by the marquees in the background.
