# Comedian defends the misunderstood male
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Editorial staff 
It used to be that when you
went to a comedy club, you could
count on seeing a mediocre-to
bad MC, a fairly funny opening
act and a slightly funnier
headliner.
But these days, a new rage is
sweeping the comedy scene: the
one-man or one-woman show.

And the Improv comedy club in
San Francisco has led the way,
featuring Rick Reynold's "Only
the Truth is Funny," Sheri
Glaser's "Family Secrets" and
now Rob Becker's "Defending the
Caveman."
"Defending the Caveman," like
most one-person shows, is a
hybrid of theater and comedy that
allows the comedian to tie jokes
together with more serious, and

often more intelligent, overtones.
Becker's premise in this
delightful show is explaining why
"men are such assholes," or
rather, why men and women
behave so differently. The typical
jokes are all there: why men watch
football, why women like to shop,
why men aren't "sensitive," etc.
But the difference is Becker
isn't blaming anyone. It's all the
fault of evolution and sex roles in
the cave times. The funniest
aspect of Becker's show isn't the
jokes, but rather the indisputable
logic of his explanations. Couples
in the audience have the most fun,
recognizing each other's faults
and being reassured that they're
not so bad after all.
With his broad face and shaggy
hair, Becker resembles the
caveman he discusses, and the
fairly elaborate set by John
Cowan lends to the caveman
motif. But Becker seems
uncomfortable in his big
Flintstones-style chair, and the
stories he tells often betray their
scripted nature, losing the feeling
of spontaneity.
Becker's strength, though, is
his timing and his wonderfully
expressive face. Whenever he
begins an imitation of an
exchange between two people, he
slides so effortlessly and
completely into the characters
that the results are hysterical and
truly enchanting.
While not uproariously funny,
"Defending the Caveman"
maintains such a constant level of
enjoyment that it's impossible not
to love it. Women appreciate his
genuine love and respect for the
female half of the species, and
men take heart in realizing why
their efforts to become more
"sensitive" often fail. You just
have to keep reminding yourself
that this is comedy, not
necessarily great factual rev
elations.
