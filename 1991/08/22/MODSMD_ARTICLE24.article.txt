# Spit roasting comes to town
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Town and Country Village is
a far cry from France, no matter
what any Palo Alto matron with
a groomed poodle might
pretend.
But France just got a little
closer with Tuesday's opening
of Cafe Rotisserie — though its
owners are quick to point out
that the cafe is not a French
restaurant.
It looks French, with blue
and yellow walls painted a iittle
darker than a Swedish kitchen,
but a little lighter than a Cal
jersey.
"Rotisserie" sounds French
— and, in fact, it is a style of
cooking that meshes particularly
well with traditional Provencal
olive oil, garlic and rosemary
seasoning.
And it tastes French. The
restaurant's dishes — variations
of spit-roasted chicken
slathered in olive oil, garlic and
rosemary — are tangy, delicious
and elegant.
The naturally grown chicken
absorbs the rosemary seasoning
beautifully as it spins in the
hefty rotisserie visible from the
cafe entrance.
Better yet, it is moist and less
fatty than most other
restaurant's dishes, where flavor

is considered before fat content.
There are a few key things
that set Cafe Rotisserie apart
from most French restaurants,
however.
It has a more casual
atmosphere, due in part to a
large pig-and-cow mural
painted on one wall.
And its prices are more
palatable to students. Entrees
range from $8.95 to $12.95,
which is reasonable given the
quality of the food.
A half-chicken served with
fresh vegetables and rosemary
spiked potatoes makes a good
sized meal. Roasted duck is also
available, as is salmon filet in a
creamy pesto sauce, among
other treats.
Take-out chicken and
sandwiches will also be available
— a sure winner for a weekend
picnic or an easy dinner at
home.
Although it's hard to predict
how any new eatery will do in
the restaurant-heavy Peninsula,
Cafe Rotisserie comes with a
good pedigree — its owners are
also behind Hobce's.
More important, the food is
indisputably delicious.
The next time the line for
Hobee's stretches out the door,
or you crave food with an
affordably French flavor, Cafe
Rotisserie is well worth a try.
