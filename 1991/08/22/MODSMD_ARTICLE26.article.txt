Down-home fun
"Doc Hollywood," starring
Michael J. Fox, Julie Warner and
Woody Harrelson
If you've been watching a lot
of television reruns lately, you'll
feel right at home in the audience
of Michael Caton-Jones' new film
"Doc Hollywood." The familiar
faces of Michael J. Fox ("Family
Ties"), Woody Harrelson
("Cheers"), and David Ogden
Stiers ("M*A*S*H") grace the
screen in this feel-good romantic
comedy.
The script itself is a rerun of
sorts. A Hollywood-bound plastic
surgeon (Fox) finds himself
stranded in a small town where a
good hog and a slice of apple pie
are major material possessions.
During his stay, he walks
barefoot on the earth, falls in love
and — get this — rethinks his
lifetime priorities. I wouldn't want
to give away the ending, but...
While the script isn't
particularly novel, the film is
done well, and its peaceful South
Carolina setting is a welcomed
presence in a summer cinema
Filled with gunshot wounds to the
head. Don't worry about seeing
this doctor; it won't hurt a bit.
The joy of "Doc Hollywood" is
in its country characters. This
little town features a yellow
squash festival, a couple who go
to the doctor to get their mail
read to them and an old
deteriorating physician who
prescribes Coca-Cola as a cure
all medicine.
Harrelson, who stands out
from the crowd along with co
hick Bridget Fonda, is more or

less indistinguishable from his
TV character. "Hey, isn't that
Ted Danson?" he teases in one
scene.
Fox shows he can be funny
playing someone post-tee-nage
— no small feat. And speaking of
small, he finds a dancing partner
in Julie Warner, a romantic
interest who is actually shorter
than he is.
Warner, in a role that was
surely written for Julia Roberts,
plays her character well, despite
the fact that it is poorly written.
Her character's combination of
urban and rural, angry and
playful, and commanding and
weak ends up being unreal
instead of complex.
One strong note, however, is a
surprising scene in which she
engages Fox to urinate around a
hunting sight to help ward off
innocent deer.
Aside from this fresh moment,
the film is cliched. But for all of
its predictability, it is a return to
down-home family happiness
that is to be celebrated. Go
ahead, bring your mom. What
the heck, bring your hog.

Pathetic youth
"Slacker," a film by Richard
Linklater
Oh, to be young, unemployed
and pathetic.
I should know, being young
and unemployed myself. As for
pathetic, well, I used to think I
was. But that was before I saw
"Slacker," the new low-budget
cult film directed, written and
produced by Richard Linklater.
Talk about pathetic.
"Slacker" is a glimpse into the
lives of over 100 residents of
Austin, Texas (which, based on
the film, is clearly a swinging

town). There is no plot, there is
no theme; the camera simply
rests on one person for a while
and then moves on. For the first
few minutes it's intriguing; after
that it's dull.
And very weird.
The "characters" in "Slacker"
are not your everyday people.
Rather, they are a group
composed of people, mostly in
their mid-20s, who spend all day
doing nothing. That's right —
nothing. These people have no
jobs and no responsibilities. For
the most part, they also have no
money. Which brings up the
question: How are they all
surviving?
And the answer is: barely.

However, they're not aware of
it. Or at least not as aware as
they are of UFOs, government
conspiracies and Madonna's pap
smear, which one character is
trying to sell.
No, I'm not kidding.
The most important thing to
this group of "neo-beatniks," as
The New York Times called
them, is getting on the guest list
for the band on Friday.
Now there's something to
strive for. I wish I had such lofty
goals.
I realize I sound a little harsh;
I apologize. It's just that I'm sick
of artsy movies made by recent
film school graduates being
worshiped just because they are

anti-Hollywood. It's one thing if
they're good, but usually they're
just different.
Then again, the stuff my
classmates produced in a film
and video seminar last year was
different also.
"Slacker" isn't horrible; in
fact, it has some funny moments.
The humor is reduced slightly,
however, when you read the
press packet and find that much
of the conversation in the film is
based on reality. There are
actually people who believe the
stuff that's being said in this
movie.
Incredible.
And pathetic.

The humor is reduced slightly,
however, when you read the
press packet and find that much
of the conversation in the film is
based on reality. There are
actually people who believe the
stuff that's being said in this
movie.
Incredible.
And pathetic.

Down-home fun
"Doc Hollywood," starring
Michael J. Fox, Julie Warner and
Woody Harrelson
If you've been watching a lot
of television reruns lately, you'll
feel right at home in the audience
of Michael Caton-Jones' new film
"Doc Hollywood." The familiar
faces of Michael J. Fox ("Family
Ties"), Woody Harrelson
("Cheers"), and David Ogden
Stiers ("M*A*S*H") grace the
screen in this feel-good romantic
comedy.
The script itself is a rerun of
sorts. A Hollywood-bound plastic
surgeon (Fox) finds himself
stranded in a small town where a
good hog and a slice of apple pie
are major material possessions.
During his stay, he walks
barefoot on the earth, falls in love
and — get this — rethinks his
lifetime priorities. I wouldn't want
to give away the ending, but...
While the script isn't
particularly novel, the film is
done well, and its peaceful South
Carolina setting is a welcomed
presence in a summer cinema
Filled with gunshot wounds to the
head. Don't worry about seeing
this doctor; it won't hurt a bit.
The joy of "Doc Hollywood" is
in its country characters. This
little town features a yellow
squash festival, a couple who go
to the doctor to get their mail
read to them and an old
deteriorating physician who
prescribes Coca-Cola as a cure
all medicine.
Harrelson, who stands out
from the crowd along with co
hick Bridget Fonda, is more or

less indistinguishable from his
TV character. "Hey, isn't that
Ted Danson?" he teases in one
scene.
Fox shows he can be funny
playing someone post-tee-nage
— no small feat. And speaking of
small, he finds a dancing partner
in Julie Warner, a romantic
interest who is actually shorter
than he is.
Warner, in a role that was
surely written for Julia Roberts,
plays her character well, despite
the fact that it is poorly written.
Her character's combination of
urban and rural, angry and
playful, and commanding and
weak ends up being unreal
instead of complex.
One strong note, however, is a
surprising scene in which she
engages Fox to urinate around a
hunting sight to help ward off
innocent deer.
Aside from this fresh moment,
the film is cliched. But for all of
its predictability, it is a return to
down-home family happiness
that is to be celebrated. Go
ahead, bring your mom. What
the heck, bring your hog.

Pathetic youth
"Slacker," a film by Richard
Linklater
Oh, to be young, unemployed
and pathetic.
I should know, being young
and unemployed myself. As for
pathetic, well, I used to think I
was. But that was before I saw
"Slacker," the new low-budget
cult film directed, written and
produced by Richard Linklater.
Talk about pathetic.
"Slacker" is a glimpse into the
lives of over 100 residents of
Austin, Texas (which, based on
the film, is clearly a swinging

town). There is no plot, there is
no theme; the camera simply
rests on one person for a while
and then moves on. For the first
few minutes it's intriguing; after
that it's dull.
And very weird.
The "characters" in "Slacker"
are not your everyday people.
Rather, they are a group
composed of people, mostly in
their mid-20s, who spend all day
doing nothing. That's right —
nothing. These people have no
jobs and no responsibilities. For
the most part, they also have no
money. Which brings up the
question: How are they all
surviving?
And the answer is: barely.

However, they're not aware of
it. Or at least not as aware as
they are of UFOs, government
conspiracies and Madonna's pap
smear, which one character is
trying to sell.
No, I'm not kidding.
The most important thing to
this group of "neo-beatniks," as
The New York Times called
them, is getting on the guest list
for the band on Friday.
Now there's something to
strive for. I wish I had such lofty
goals.
I realize I sound a little harsh;
I apologize. It's just that I'm sick
of artsy movies made by recent
film school graduates being
worshiped just because they are

anti-Hollywood. It's one thing if
they're good, but usually they're
just different.
Then again, the stuff my
classmates produced in a film
and video seminar last year was
different also.
"Slacker" isn't horrible; in
fact, it has some funny moments.
The humor is reduced slightly,
however, when you read the
press packet and find that much
of the conversation in the film is
based on reality. There are
actually people who believe the
stuff that's being said in this
movie.
Incredible.
