Editor's picks:
The Emmy Awards
• Best Drama: "China Beach" — "L.A.
Law" always wins this one, but the nod
this year should go to the recently
canceled "China Beach." Powerfully
written and well-acted, the show tackled a
difficult topic — the Vietnam War — with
dignity and pathos.
• Best Comedy: "Murphy Brown" — A
tough call between "Cheers" and "Murphy
Brown," but the performance of Candice
Bergen tips the scales in favor of this
intelligent and witty comedy about a

successful journalist who's fiercely
independent yet hopelessly insecure.
New film releases:
Opening Friday
• "Dead Again" — "How many times can
you die for love?"
• "Hariey Davidson and the Marlboro
Man" — "Summer's last blast!"
• "True Identity" — "The most dangerous
thing Miles Pope ever did was to discover
a mobster's true identity. And the funniest
thing he ever did was to hide his own."
• "Defenseless" — "The only thing more
shocking than the killing was the motive."

Lingers"

TV this week:
Television celebrates itself on Sunday
with the 43rd Annual Emmy Awards on
FOX. The Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences honors 40 years of comedy
on television at this year's ceremony,
hosted by Jamie Lee Curtis, Dennis Miller
and Jerry Seinfeld.
Some oddities to note: "The Simpsons"
can't win for Best Comedy Series, because
the Academy rules place it in the
Outstanding Animated Program category,
against "The Smurfs" or something like
that. "The Civil War" competes in the
Outstanding Informational Series category
against "Entertainment Tonight." But the
producers of "Northern Exposure" got to
choose their own category, opting for Best
Drama Series. Go figure.
