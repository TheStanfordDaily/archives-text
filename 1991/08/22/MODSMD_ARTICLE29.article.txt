No matter how many copies of "Home Alone"
your favorite video store orders, you're not going
to be able to find a rental copy. Don't even
bother trying.
Of course, with recent world events, you
might feel guilty trying to watch something
other than the evening news. You wouldn't
want Mikhail Gorbachev to be watching the
antics of an 8-year-old if you were in his
shoes, would you?
There's a compromise, of course, and Second-
Choice Videos offers the following Russian
flavored titles for your consideration.
• "The Russia House" — Even though it's still a
fairly new title, you can probably pick up this spy
thriller based on John Le Carre's novel and
starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Sean Connery.

• "Red Heat" — Arnold Schwarzenegger is
hotter than ever right now, and his turn as a
Soviet cop paired with American James Belushi
puts his Austrian accent to good use, even if it
isn't accurate.
• "From Russia with Love" — James Bond never
fails as a second-choice selection, and this is one
of the best. Sean Connery stars as Bond, James
Bond, in a struggle to capture a Russian
decoding machine.
• "Red Dawn" — A rather implausible picture
about a Russian invasion of the United States,
this film nevertheless features a lot of good
looking teenagers transforming into guerrillas
capable of defeating Soviet soldiers — all
because they've got the American spirit.
• "The Hunt for Red October" — Sean Connery
stars as a Soviet submarine commander trying to
defect to the United States, but both sides are
trying to blow him out of the water.
