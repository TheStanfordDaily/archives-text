Determining the subject for
an open-topic essay takes
longer than writing the
essay itself! In the end I decided
to share with The Weekly's
readership five quotations and
why they are favorites of mine.
"There are no such things as
hang-ups — only self
indulgences." [author unknown]
The late 1960s and early 1970s
were a time of upheaval here. All
sorts of crass and gross behavior
were justified as alleged "hang
ups." The best example I can
remember was the habit, then,
for students to keep scraggly,
smelly, generally unwashed dogs
as pets.
Those dogs went everywhere
— even to my office when the
animal's owner came in. I would
often ask a student to leave the
dog outside, but the student
would say, "Oh, this dog goes
everywhere with me; it's a
hang-up of mine." The dogs
themselves had hang-ups, too,
including doing nasty things to
the carpet. In that and in many
other contexts, "hang-up" was
the name for some personal
whim, and the term carried with
it a blanket expiation for just
about any behavior.
"Obeying your own will is not
freedom; it is slavery to your own
will." [author unknown] Most of
us seek a force in our lives that
can lead us: something to follow,
to give life meaning. That
something should also allow us to
be free.
But what happens when that
force leads one into conflict with
the law or the convenience or
rights of others? Unqualified,
unquestioned obedience to
anything isn't freedom. Neither
an individual nor a group of
individuals nor society should
reign unimpeded, for the rights of
each have to be protected.
"The world will not change if I
change, but the change in myself
is the premise." [Karl Jaspers]
Few would dispute that both
human nature and human beings
are imperfect. An age-old
argument is "It's hypocritical to
strive for something one can't
attain; therefore, why bother?"
No one is free of a whole host of
blemishes, and hypocrisy is just
one of the plethora of
undesirable characteristics we all
have to live with.
But it isn't hypocritical to
strive toward something that is
unattainable. Or, even if that is
hypocritical in the strict sense, it
still isn't evil. Not to strive
because one can't get what one is
striving for is a pretty bleak
surrender to the imperfections of
human nature. There may be
other valid reasons for not
striving, but a resulting hypocrisy
isn't one of them.
"Those who want freedom
must remember that every
demand for freedom is also a
demand that society curtail the
freedom of others to deprive them
of their freedom." [Sidney Hook]
Once one has plowed through the
intricacies of pronominal
reference in that sentence, the
point is clear: Unless a person
lives in total isolation, the
behavior of that person is going
to affect others in some way.

Hook asserts that there
cannot be absolute freedom for
any individual or any subset of
individuals without impingement
on the freedom of others, and his
implication is that such
impingement can often be
negative in its effect on those
others.
"There is room for
disagreement among honorable
people." So far as I know, this
quotation is mine. I first coined it
while working with freshman
advisees and advising associates
to emphasize that it is definitely
possible, eminently respectable
and sometimes even desirable for
an advisor and an advising
associate to disagree on some
question.
The essence here is that
disagreement, even on heady
issues, need not impugn the
dignity of either party or make
their relationship less close.
I lament the notion that
disagreement automatically
offends. In meaningful human
relationships, there ought to be a
foundation of respect strong
enough to allow, support and
even encourage disagreement,
thereby letting it enrich those
relationships further.
There are central themes
pervading these five quotations.
One is clearly the premise that
freedom for an individual doesn't
carry with it the tread
untrammeled upon the freedom
of others. I would argue that
neither the individual nor society
can function productively
without limits on both of their
behaviors.
I deplore some noticeable
trends in our world: the
significant deterioration of
public and private comity and
the seemingly epidemic
unwillingness to grant that a
communal, harmonious society
requires each of us sometimes to
subjugate ourself to its laws. But
"unqualified, unquestioned
obedience" accorded to the laws
of society isn't, as I noted above,
freedom either.
Contemplating these questions
has sensitized me, I hope, to the
imperative in Jaspers' quotation:
You can't expect anyone else to
change if you're unwilling to
change yourself.
All of that leads to another
eternal question: To what
degree can and does society put
into place deterrents to tame
aggravating behavior? But that's
the subject of another essay. In
the meantime, it would do all of
us good to think more about the
consequences for others of what
we do.

degree can and does society put
into place deterrents to tame
aggravating behavior? But that's
the subject of another essay. In
the meantime, it would do all of
us good to think more about the
consequences for others of what
we do.

Determining the subject for
an open-topic essay takes
longer than writing the
essay itself! In the end I decided
to share with The Weekly's
readership five quotations and
why they are favorites of mine.
"There are no such things as
hang-ups — only self
indulgences." [author unknown]
The late 1960s and early 1970s
were a time of upheaval here. All
sorts of crass and gross behavior
were justified as alleged "hang
ups." The best example I can
remember was the habit, then,
for students to keep scraggly,
smelly, generally unwashed dogs
as pets.
Those dogs went everywhere
— even to my office when the
animal's owner came in. I would
often ask a student to leave the
dog outside, but the student
would say, "Oh, this dog goes
everywhere with me; it's a
hang-up of mine." The dogs
themselves had hang-ups, too,
including doing nasty things to
the carpet. In that and in many
other contexts, "hang-up" was
the name for some personal
whim, and the term carried with
it a blanket expiation for just
about any behavior.
"Obeying your own will is not
freedom; it is slavery to your own
will." [author unknown] Most of
us seek a force in our lives that
can lead us: something to follow,
to give life meaning. That
something should also allow us to
be free.
But what happens when that
force leads one into conflict with
the law or the convenience or
rights of others? Unqualified,
unquestioned obedience to
anything isn't freedom. Neither
an individual nor a group of
individuals nor society should
reign unimpeded, for the rights of
each have to be protected.
"The world will not change if I
change, but the change in myself
is the premise." [Karl Jaspers]
Few would dispute that both
human nature and human beings
are imperfect. An age-old
argument is "It's hypocritical to
strive for something one can't
attain; therefore, why bother?"
No one is free of a whole host of
blemishes, and hypocrisy is just
one of the plethora of
undesirable characteristics we all
have to live with.
But it isn't hypocritical to
strive toward something that is
unattainable. Or, even if that is
hypocritical in the strict sense, it
still isn't evil. Not to strive
because one can't get what one is
striving for is a pretty bleak
surrender to the imperfections of
human nature. There may be
other valid reasons for not
striving, but a resulting hypocrisy
isn't one of them.
"Those who want freedom
must remember that every
demand for freedom is also a
demand that society curtail the
freedom of others to deprive them
of their freedom." [Sidney Hook]
Once one has plowed through the
intricacies of pronominal
reference in that sentence, the
point is clear: Unless a person
lives in total isolation, the
behavior of that person is going
to affect others in some way.

Hook asserts that there
cannot be absolute freedom for
any individual or any subset of
individuals without impingement
on the freedom of others, and his
implication is that such
impingement can often be
negative in its effect on those
others.
"There is room for
disagreement among honorable
people." So far as I know, this
quotation is mine. I first coined it
while working with freshman
advisees and advising associates
to emphasize that it is definitely
possible, eminently respectable
and sometimes even desirable for
an advisor and an advising
associate to disagree on some
question.
The essence here is that
disagreement, even on heady
issues, need not impugn the
dignity of either party or make
their relationship less close.
I lament the notion that
disagreement automatically
offends. In meaningful human
relationships, there ought to be a
foundation of respect strong
enough to allow, support and
even encourage disagreement,
thereby letting it enrich those
relationships further.
There are central themes
pervading these five quotations.
One is clearly the premise that
freedom for an individual doesn't
carry with it the tread
untrammeled upon the freedom
of others. I would argue that
neither the individual nor society
can function productively
without limits on both of their
behaviors.
I deplore some noticeable
trends in our world: the
significant deterioration of
public and private comity and
the seemingly epidemic
unwillingness to grant that a
communal, harmonious society
requires each of us sometimes to
subjugate ourself to its laws. But
"unqualified, unquestioned
obedience" accorded to the laws
of society isn't, as I noted above,
freedom either.
Contemplating these questions
has sensitized me, I hope, to the
imperative in Jaspers' quotation:
You can't expect anyone else to
change if you're unwilling to
change yourself.
All of that leads to another
eternal question: To what
degree can and does society put
into place deterrents to tame
aggravating behavior? But that's
the subject of another essay. In
the meantime, it would do all of
us good to think more about the
consequences for others of what
we do.
