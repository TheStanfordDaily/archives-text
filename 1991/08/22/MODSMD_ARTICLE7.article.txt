## Muscovites unite in a time of trouble 
### 
This letter was written on Aug. 20, at 7:40 p.m.,
Moscow time.
I have just been at the White House, the Russian
parliament, which is surrounded by barricades
and hundreds of thousands of Muscovites who
have come to protect their president, Boris Yeltsin,
from the encroachment of the putschists, who have
issued a warrant for his arrest.
At this moment, tanks and armored transports
are sitting in central Moscow and, according to a
report on independent radio (the only source we
have, as all but the official newspapers have been

closed), they
have not moved.
Yet the mood
outside the
White House is
festive. No one
knows what the
next hour will
bring, but now
strangers smile
at one another.
Women bring
food, cigarettes
and money for
those who will
remain here
through the
night. The men
have divided
themselves into
groups of 100 in
order to defend
the building, or
ganizing them
selves as an
army would.

Perhaps for the first time in many years, each
person here feels that he is not simply a part of the
masses, blindly obeying leaders; rather, he is a part
of the people, who are sick and tired of not having
the freedom they deserve, and who will no longer
put up with it.
No one has suggested that all this is happening
for the better, for now the true face of the power
that has oppressed the people for so many years is
showing itself. There are no more illusions — this is
the mood of those gathered.
How many people have gathered outside the
walls of the Parliament? By most conservative
estimates there are no fewer than half a million.
And if you take into account the fact that they are
changing all the time (people come to replace those
who go home to sleep), the figure doubles.
In the last few days something has changed our
lives.
Never before have students in the Soviet Union
been so active; never have I seen so many young
faces at meetings and demonstrations.
lulia Shepelkova, a member of the Confederacy
of Anarcho-Sindakists said, "We anarchists are
opposed to all forms of power, but at this time we
support Russian power over the power of the

hunta. There are many students among the
anarchists. If by the first of September — the first
day of classes — the putsch has not been stopped,
then we will not attend classes."
And Egor, a student at the Saratovskii
Theatrical Institute, added, "There are many
students here but there is no central student
movement. Unfortunately, we are not organized.
But I am sure that the situation will change due to
recent events. When threatened by the army,
students here have all come out on the streets to
protest."
There is yet another unexpected development

out of all this
— parts of the
army have
come over to
the side of the
people. Ac
cording to the
radio, tanks in
the Tamanskii
division have
avowed their
allegiance to
Yeltsin.
Everyone
who has ap
peared here be
fore the people
has expressed
the same sent
iment: "We
love our army!
The army will
not fire upon
the people!"
The people

at the White
House have treated the crews of the first 10 tanks
that came to the defense of the lawful Russian
leadership with special kindness.
The foremost demand of the gatherers (or, more
correctly, the protesters) has been to "produce"
Gorbachev, but all eyes have been turned to
Yeltsin. He is seen as the stronghold of democracy
and law in our country.
This is another new development in our lives —
an unprecedented unity among the people and the
lawful leadership.
When members of the Parliament appear at the
rostrum, they are met with long ovations. The
official cars driving through the square outside the
White House are accompanied by guards with
machine guns, defending them from the
overwhelming expressions of sympathy and support
by the people.
At this time the defenders are building fires
around the metro station near the Parliament, a
station that, by an ironic twist of fate, is named
"Barricade." And at this time believers are praying
the night will pass without bloodshed. •
