# STANFORD GAINS LEVERAGE IN STUDENT LOBBY
## 
### HOWARD LIBIT 
MILWAUKEE — Stanford's rocky
relationship with the United States Student
Association appeared to take a turn for the
better during last week's summer national
congress as one Stanford delegate was
elected to the group's board of directors.
But significant questions still remain
about how "representative the national
student lobby organization can be of a
private West Coast university like Stanford.
More than 250 students from universities
and community colleges nationwide
attended the 44th annual summer congress
held here at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee. Stanford was one of only two
private universities that sent delegates.
Although debate was expected to center

on education and finan
cial aid, the legislative
meetings often focused
on unrelated issues such
as abortion and U.S.
foreign relations —
something opponents to
Stanford's membership
in the organization have
cited as a reason for the
ASSU to withdraw.
But by the conclusion
of the week-long meet
ing, Stanford represen
tatives Vanessa Tapia
and Amy Richard said
they came away with a
better understanding.of
the financial aid issues
vital to beginning the new
ASSU financial aid lobby

office, which is scheduled to open this fall.
Tapia also garnered the spot on the
organization's board of directors reserved
for a representative of a private university.
A top priority
The top priority for the USSA lobbying
efforts in the next year will be to increase
federal financial aid.
Congress must reauthorize government
funding of federal financial aid during the
upcoming school year, and the plan
submitted by President George Bush calls
for significant cuts in aid and a shift from
grants to loans. These actions would hurt
students nationwide.
"There is no question that the re
authorization of financial aid is the
number-one issue," said Tapia, a
sophomore. "The many workshops have
taught us how to plan for next year and do
grassroots lobbying work that will help all
Stanford students relying on financial aid."
Association officials said results of their
lobbying efforts can be seen in changes
congressmen have proposed to the re
authorization bill.
For instance, it is likely that Pell grants
— made available to students whose
parents' income falls below certain levels —
will be changed to an entitlement program
during the next legislative session,
according to outgoing USSA President
Julius Davis.
This would prevent Congress from
automatically cutting the funds in the future
and guarantee that all deserving students
receive the money necessary for higher
education, Davis said.
Stanford students also plan to work with
the national association on the financial aid
issue through a new office created for that
purpose in the ASSU.
During last spring's ASSU runoff
election, students passed a referendum
calling for the creation of a financial aid
office within the ASSU to lobby for
increased funds at both the state and
federal levels.
Tapia, who is co-director of
intercollegiate relations for Stanford's new
financial aid office, said Stanford students

will be able to make a difference in the
financial aid re-authorization. Last March,
re-authorization several Stanford students
testified at a congressional hearing on
financial aid.
Controversial stands
Last week's USSA summer congress also
passed bills on many issues unrelated to
education.
Most critics of the national association
agree that the group's lobbying efforts on
behalf of financial aid arc worthwhile but
express concern about the organization's
positions on other issues.
For instance, the association decided ii
should lobby in favor of a woman's right to

an abortion, and many
members debated wheth
er the federal govern
ment should suspend all
aid to Israel until the
Jewish state grants
Palestinian refugees a
homeland.
Perhaps the most
unique action taken by
the group was to call on
the federal government
to begin an inquiry into
the origin of AIDS.
One unidentified
delegate claimed that
the federal government
actually created the
AIDS virus as a
biological weapon and
first tested it on gay

white males in the early 19705. She claimed
she had researched the subject extensively
and discovered secret congressional
hearings, but she refused to specify when
they occurred.
Despite skepticism from some delegates,

a resolution blaming the Defense
Department for creating the AIDS virus
passed by a large margin in the congress.
"It is true that everything is not always
focused on financial aid, but most of it does
relate," said Richard, a sophomore elected
to the senate last spring. "Some of the other
issues are still very important."
Representatives from other schools
agreed that the conference often became
distracted by unrelated issues but insisted
that financial aid is the focus of the national
association's lobbying efforts.
"The congress is an important
opportunity for students to discuss issues,
both educational and political," said
sophomore Spenser Insolia of the
University of Arizona. "But 51 weeks of the
year and 95 percent of USSA's resources go
to work on higher-education issues.
"That is where the true value of USSA
can be found," he added.
But while delegates said that the
organization is essential to lobbying on
financial aid, most also admitted that it is
not yet representative of or responsive to
private universities.

Only two private universities sent
delegates to the summer conference —
Marquette University and Stanford.
And although officials from the
association will not release a list of member
schools, Tapia said she believes there are
fewer than 10 private institutions in the
United States Student Association.
With so few private universities
represented, many financial aid resolutions
concentrated on federal funds to states —
money allocated only to public universities
and community colleges.
"It is hard to get private schools
involved," said senior Matt Miszewsky of
Marquette. "Historically USSA has only
represented public schools."
But the national association has begun
making efforts to give private schools more
of a say in the lobbying efforts.
One position of the USSA board of
directors is reserved for a representative of
a private school — the spot to which Tapia
was elected.
Several recent Stanford graduates have
also risen to high positions within the
national association. For instance, former
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Stacey Leyton ran unopposed for vice
president in last week's election for
leadership of the organization.
But representatives from private schools
are rarely elected to the board of directors
by their regional schools and must rely on
the board position guaranteed to private
universities for representation in the
association's leadership.
"USSA should be doing more recruiting
of private universities, and private schools
should get more involved," Tapia said. The
association did pass a resolution introduced
by Tapia calling for better recruitment of
private schools nationwide.
Questionable attitudes
Nevertheless, the attitudes of some
public-school representatives remain a
cause for concern, according to Richard
and Tapia. Some delegates at the
conference made sweeping generalizations
about private universities and said they
preferred not to focus on them.
"The problem with private universities is
that they do not support Latinos and other
minorities," said Jose Esteva, a student from
San Francisco State. "They are wealthy
whites who do not need financial aid."
Esteva was elected by the schools in
California and is supposed to represent
Stanford as well as public schools.
Although all 106 California junior
colleges as well as several of the University
of California schools belong to the national
association, only San Francisco State, UC-
Davis and Stanford sent representatives.
Because San Francisco State sent 11
representatives, it dominated the regional
meetings and elected its delegates —
including Estava — to both positions on the
board of directors.
Other member schools could not afford to
send anyone due to budget constraints, and
UC-Davis was only able to send one person.

Stanford's membership
in the organization have
cited as a reason for the
ASSU to withdraw.
But by the conclusion
of the week-long meet
ing, Stanford represen
tatives Vanessa Tapia
and Amy Richard said
they came away with a
better understanding.of
the financial aid issues
vital to beginning the new
ASSU financial aid lobby

office, which is scheduled to open this fall.
Tapia also garnered the spot on the
organization's board of directors reserved
for a representative of a private university.
A top priority
The top priority for the USSA lobbying
efforts in the next year will be to increase
federal financial aid.
Congress must reauthorize government
funding of federal financial aid during the
upcoming school year, and the plan
submitted by President George Bush calls
for significant cuts in aid and a shift from
grants to loans. These actions would hurt
students nationwide.
"There is no question that the re
authorization of financial aid is the
number-one issue," said Tapia, a
sophomore. "The many workshops have
taught us how to plan for next year and do
grassroots lobbying work that will help all
Stanford students relying on financial aid."
Association officials said results of their
lobbying efforts can be seen in changes
congressmen have proposed to the re
authorization bill.
For instance, it is likely that Pell grants
— made available to students whose
parents' income falls below certain levels —
will be changed to an entitlement program
during the next legislative session,
according to outgoing USSA President
Julius Davis.
This would prevent Congress from
automatically cutting the funds in the future
and guarantee that all deserving students
receive the money necessary for higher
education, Davis said.
Stanford students also plan to work with
the national association on the financial aid
issue through a new office created for that
purpose in the ASSU.
During last spring's ASSU runoff
election, students passed a referendum
calling for the creation of a financial aid
office within the ASSU to lobby for
increased funds at both the state and
federal levels.
Tapia, who is co-director of
intercollegiate relations for Stanford's new
financial aid office, said Stanford students

will be able to make a difference in the
financial aid re-authorization. Last March,
re-authorization several Stanford students
testified at a congressional hearing on
financial aid.
Controversial stands
Last week's USSA summer congress also
passed bills on many issues unrelated to
education.
Most critics of the national association
agree that the group's lobbying efforts on
behalf of financial aid arc worthwhile but
express concern about the organization's
positions on other issues.
For instance, the association decided ii
should lobby in favor of a woman's right to

an abortion, and many
members debated wheth
er the federal govern
ment should suspend all
aid to Israel until the
Jewish state grants
Palestinian refugees a
homeland.
Perhaps the most
unique action taken by
the group was to call on
the federal government
to begin an inquiry into
the origin of AIDS.
One unidentified
delegate claimed that
the federal government
actually created the
AIDS virus as a
biological weapon and
first tested it on gay

white males in the early 19705. She claimed
she had researched the subject extensively
and discovered secret congressional
hearings, but she refused to specify when
they occurred.
Despite skepticism from some delegates,

a resolution blaming the Defense
Department for creating the AIDS virus
passed by a large margin in the congress.
"It is true that everything is not always
focused on financial aid, but most of it does
relate," said Richard, a sophomore elected
to the senate last spring. "Some of the other
issues are still very important."
Representatives from other schools
agreed that the conference often became
distracted by unrelated issues but insisted
that financial aid is the focus of the national
association's lobbying efforts.
"The congress is an important
opportunity for students to discuss issues,
both educational and political," said
sophomore Spenser Insolia of the
University of Arizona. "But 51 weeks of the
year and 95 percent of USSA's resources go
to work on higher-education issues.
"That is where the true value of USSA
can be found," he added.
But while delegates said that the
organization is essential to lobbying on
financial aid, most also admitted that it is
not yet representative of or responsive to
private universities.

Only two private universities sent
delegates to the summer conference —
Marquette University and Stanford.
And although officials from the
association will not release a list of member
schools, Tapia said she believes there are
fewer than 10 private institutions in the
United States Student Association.
With so few private universities
represented, many financial aid resolutions
concentrated on federal funds to states —
money allocated only to public universities
and community colleges.
"It is hard to get private schools
involved," said senior Matt Miszewsky of
Marquette. "Historically USSA has only
represented public schools."
But the national association has begun
making efforts to give private schools more
of a say in the lobbying efforts.
One position of the USSA board of
directors is reserved for a representative of
a private school — the spot to which Tapia
was elected.
Several recent Stanford graduates have
also risen to high positions within the
national association. For instance, former
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Stacey Leyton ran unopposed for vice
president in last week's election for
leadership of the organization.
But representatives from private schools
are rarely elected to the board of directors
by their regional schools and must rely on
the board position guaranteed to private
universities for representation in the
association's leadership.
"USSA should be doing more recruiting
of private universities, and private schools
should get more involved," Tapia said. The
association did pass a resolution introduced
by Tapia calling for better recruitment of
private schools nationwide.
Questionable attitudes
Nevertheless, the attitudes of some
public-school representatives remain a
cause for concern, according to Richard
and Tapia. Some delegates at the
conference made sweeping generalizations
about private universities and said they
preferred not to focus on them.
"The problem with private universities is
that they do not support Latinos and other
minorities," said Jose Esteva, a student from
San Francisco State. "They are wealthy
whites who do not need financial aid."
Esteva was elected by the schools in
California and is supposed to represent
Stanford as well as public schools.
Although all 106 California junior
colleges as well as several of the University
of California schools belong to the national
association, only San Francisco State, UC-
Davis and Stanford sent representatives.
Because San Francisco State sent 11
representatives, it dominated the regional
meetings and elected its delegates —
including Estava — to both positions on the
board of directors.
Other member schools could not afford to
send anyone due to budget constraints, and
UC-Davis was only able to send one person.

MILWAUKEE — Stanford's rocky
relationship with the United States Student
Association appeared to take a turn for the
better during last week's summer national
congress as one Stanford delegate was
elected to the group's board of directors.
But significant questions still remain
about how "representative the national
student lobby organization can be of a
private West Coast university like Stanford.
More than 250 students from universities
and community colleges nationwide
attended the 44th annual summer congress
held here at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee. Stanford was one of only two
private universities that sent delegates.
Although debate was expected to center

on education and finan

meetings often focused
