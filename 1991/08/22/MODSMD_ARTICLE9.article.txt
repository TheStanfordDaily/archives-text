# Quiet beginnings, recent rumblings
## 
### 
Although few students noticed it at
the time, Stanford first joined the
United States Student Association
about six years ago.
Former Council of Presidents
member Stacey Leyton quickly and
quietly rose within the ranks of the
national student lobby organization,
serving in Washington, D.C., and as the

West Coast repre
sentative of the organ
ization.
It was not until this
past spring that people
within the ASSU start
ed making noise about
the association — and
much of the publicity
was negative.
In conjunction with
the association, five
Stanford students par
ticipated in a confer*
ence on the reauthor
ization of federal finan
cial aid, and senior
Brian Hooker testified
at a joint congressional
hearing on the subject.

In the wake of the hearing, several
ASSU senators questioned the
affirmative action policy in effect at the
conference, describing it as a quota
system designed to discriminate against
white males.
That criticism was withdrawn after a
statement from the Office of
Multicultural Development, but it still

appeared to have a major effect on the
ASSU's spring general election.
Several senators proposed a special
fee request for the creation of a new
ASSU lobby office to work in
conjunction with the national
association.
Students overwhelmingly rejected
the fee request by one of the largest

margins in recent
election history amid
concerns about the wide
scope of the office and
the issues it would lobby
for.
But senators then
resurrected the proposal
— this time in the form
of a referendum calling
on the ASSU to create a
financial aid office to
work strictly on financial
aid.
Students passed this
referendum in the COP
runoff election and the
ASSU Senate comp
romised to provide

some funding for the
office. No positions within the office are
salaried and other funds are limited.
But supporters of the Stanford
membership in the USSA say they will
work hard to demonstrate the value of
the new financial aid office and hope
the relationship between the University
and the association improves during the
upcoming year.
