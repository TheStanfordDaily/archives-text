## Contract policy being probed 
### 
The Small Business Adminis
tration is examining charges that
Stanford has not followed federal
requirements for giving govern
ment-funded contracts to small
and minority-owned businesses.
The University is required to
set aside 5 percent of govern
ment-funded contracts of more
than $500,000 for small and mi
nority-owned businesses.
Several businesses have com
plained that University policies
make it difficult for them to win
bids for government-funded con
tracts. But University officials say
they are following the law and are
making special efforts to do busi
ness with small and minority
owned contractors.
The investigation is part of the
Office of Naval Research's con
tractor procurement system re
view, which takes place every two
or three years. Paul Biddle, the
office's resident representative at
Stanford who has led the investi
gation into the University's indi
rect-cost practices, asked the
Small Business Administration to
review the allegations about the
set-aside program.
Biddle organized a meeting
this week between business own
ers with complaints and officials
at the Small Business Associa
tion.
"From what we're hearing, it
appears Stanford could improve
its performance markedly," Bid
dle said. If the allegations are
true, Stanford could be required
to take corrective action, or, if the
problems are severe enough, be
forced to pay damages, he added.
In a statement, Stanford Pro
curement Director Jim Gallaher
said the University might not
meet the set-aside requirement
on every individual contract be
cause some services are not avail
able from small businesses. But
this year, 5.5 percent of Universi
ty purchasing as a whole went to
small and minority-owned con
tractors, he added.
"I don't think you could say
anybody has lived up to the law
100 percent. We have made an
honest, good effort to comply,
and that's what the law says you
have to do," he said.
