# Sexism charge to be reviewed

Allegations of sexist behavior
raised against Neurosurgery Prof.
Gerald Silverberg, the acting
chair of the Neurosurgery De
partment, will be investigated by
a University committee before he
is promoted to the permanent po
sition.
Silverberg's suitability for the
position came under fire when

Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Con
ley resigned in June, citing Silver
berg's pending promotion and
pervasive sexism as her reasons
for leaving.
Although Conley did not iden
tify Silverberg by name, she said in
an interview following her resigna
tion that she "resigned because
the behavior of a person promot
ed to chairman of my department
has characteristics rooted 25 years
ago. He devalues women and, for
that matter, anyone whom he per
ceives to be inferior."
A four-member committee, or
ganized through the office of
Medical School Assoc. Dean
Robert Cutler, has been appoint
ed to investigate these claims and
recommend appropriate Univer
sity action, depending on their
findings.
Recommendations will be
made to Medical School Dean
David Korn.
Cutler, who is a committee
member, said the recommenda
tions would be issued in about
three months and their content
will "depend on the severity and
correctness of the allegations."
The exact method by which the
committee will conduct its inves
tigation has not been clearly de
fined, said Cutler.
The decision to promote Sil
verberg to the permanent posi
tion was made spring quarter
when a nation wide search was
terminated due to budgetary con
straints. The search committee is
still extant, but inactive, Cutler
said.
