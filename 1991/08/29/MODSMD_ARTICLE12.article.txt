# Biddle wins recognition
## 
### 
Paul Biddle, the federal regu
lator whose allegations of massive
overcharging sparked the indi
rect-cost controversy at Stanford,
will receive the Navy's Meritori
ous Civilian Service Award at a
conference late next month.
Biddle is the campus-based
representative of the Office of
Naval Research, the federal
agency responsible for overseeing
how federal research money is
spent at Stanford.
Biddle has alleged that, prior
to his arrival at Stanford in Octo
ber 1988, the University and the
Navy enjoyed a "cozy" relation
ship that allowed Stanford to
overbill the government for indi
rect costs of research by as much
as $200 million during the 1980s.
Indirect costs are those ex
penses necessary to conduct fed
eral research, such as utilities and
maintenance, that are not easily
attributable to a specific project.
A Navy report released in Feb
ruary dismissed Biddle's most se
rious allegations, but said the
possibility of overcharging existed
due to lax oversight. Several Navy
officials who had been responsi
ble for regulating Stanford have
since been disciplined.
In April, the Navy said Stan
ford's current billing rate was far
too high and terminated close to
100 accounting agreements with
the University. The action, which
threw Stanford into a budget crisis,

did not effect prior years, however.
Negotiators from Stanford and
the Navy will be reviewing the
University's cost submissions from
the last decade in upcoming
months. Biddle, who will likely be
one of the negotiators, still con
tends that the University over
billed the government by close to
$200 million.
The Navy's Meritorious Civilian
Service Award is presented by the
Secretary of the Navy. It does not
include monetary compensation.
During the last decade, 57 Of
fice of Naval Research employees
received the service award, ac
cording to Mark Whetstone, a
Navy spokesperson.
