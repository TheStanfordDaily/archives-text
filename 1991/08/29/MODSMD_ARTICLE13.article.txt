# Search begins for next prez

### 
A group of trustees and facul
ty members has formed to study
and propose ways to search for a
replacement for University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who last
month announced he would re
sign in August 1992.
The ad hoc committee, assem
bled at the request of Board of
Trustees President James Gaither,
is scheduled to make its recom
mendations at the Board's Sep
tember meeting.
The actual search process will
probably begin in early October,
Gaither said. He added that it
will be nationwide and will prob
ably take about six months. By
early spring, it will be "getting

pretty close to the end."
The committee's job is to look at
the process of finding a new presi
dent, Gaither said. "There arc no
prescribed rules as to how it should
be done. We're looking at all the
[possibilities] to find the best way."
As part of its work, the com
mittee is examining previous
search methods at Stanford as
well as at other universities.
During the process that culmi
nated in the hiring of Kennedy,
there were two search committees
— one of trustees and the other of
faculty, alumni and students. The
latter committee made recommen
dations to the trustee committee.
One of the issues the ad hoc
committee must address is
whether the University should
staff the search committee entire
ly itself or hire an outside "head
hunter" organization to look for a
new president, Gaither said.
The Board as a whole will
make the final decision on
Kennedy's replacement.
Because its focus is solely on
the search process, the ad hoc
committee has not had any discus
sions on the qualifications for can
didates. But in general, Gaither
said, universities like Stanford are
seeking "a person of all seasons."
