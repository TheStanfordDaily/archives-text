# Shultz reflects on Soviet coup
## 
### 
Last week's attempted coup in
the Soviet Union failed because
of "people power," former U.S.
Secretary of State and Distin
guished Hoover Fellow George
Shultz said Tuesday.
"The people of the Soviet
Union have made this their revo
lution," Shultz said before a
group of about 400 earthquake
scientists and engineers attending
the Fourth International Confer
ence on Seismic Zonation at
Stanford this week.
Among the factors responsible
for the coup's collapse were the
"abject failure" of the existing
system, firm and defiant reaction
from the Soviet people and the
rest of the world, ambivalence in
the armed forces and the impact
of information technology that
galvanized "a reaction from the
[Soviet] people, which they ex
pressed massively," he said.
Shultz speculated the remain
ing Soviet republics would form a
confederal structure, with the in
dividual states contributing to a
central government.
He also called for the United
States to recognize the breakaway
Baltic states.
Shultz predicted that other
Communist regimes, notably Cuba
and China, would also soon fall.
As for aid from the West, he said
assistance should only be given
when "there is genuine change in
place, both politically and eco
nomically," such as in Poland.
