As their contract's expiration
date draws near, members of the
United Stanford Workers are
making tangible strike prep
arations.
The preparations, which come
on the heels of last week's strike
authorization vote, include open
ing up an 1,800-square-foot strike
headquarters located in the
Whiskey Gulch section of East
Palo Alto and filing serious
grievances with the University, ac
cording to chief USW negotiator
Michael Tatham.
He said his bargaining unit is
frustrated that the University
hasn't addressed USW pension,
health care and job security pro
posals.
Chief University negotiator
Michael Vartain was unavailable
for comment.
