# Bones found in end zone
## 
### 
Groundskeepers discovered
what appear to be the cremated
remains of a living creature yes
terday morning when they were
installing a goal post in the north
end zone of Stanford Stadium.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said the groundskeepers
were unable to insert the post into
the ground and began digging to
see what was blocking the way.
They found material that is "a
mixture of ashes with chips of
bone in it,"he said.
"It's definitely some living
creature, be it animal or human,"
he added.
The groundskeepers informed
the police, who, in turn, notified
the Santa Clara County Coro
ner's Office. A permit is required
to dispose of cremated remains.
Very few people obey this law,
however, Niemeyer said.
Neither the coroner's office
nor the police is interested in
prosecuting the owner of the re
mains, Niemeyer said. They will
be kept by the police for 90 days
and then disposed of.
Anyone wishing to claim the
remains should contact the Stan
ford Police.
