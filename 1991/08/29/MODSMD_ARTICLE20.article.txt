# Campus Drive awaits repairs
## 
### 
Two sections of Campus Drive
will be closed for about five days
early next month for road main
tenance.
The work will likely take place
between Sept. 3 and 13 and will
seal off Campus Drive West from
Welch Road to Junipero Serra
Boulevard. Campus Drive East
between Galvez and Serra streets
will also be closed. Motorists will
be re-routed from these areas to
side streets.
The Maples Pavilion parking
lot and Bonair Siding will still be
accessible from Campus Drive,
but cars will have to take Serra
Street to reach the Serra Parking
Lot and Arguello Way.
Michael Kuntz, Civil and
Landscape Manager for Facilities
Services, said the work on Cam

pus Drive East will involve an
"overlay" — placing a new sur
face of asphalt on top of the cur
rent one.
The section of Campus Drive
East has been developing cracks,
Kuntz said. If the repaving is not
done, rain could create potholes.
The problems on Campus
Drive West involve slight road
wearing known as "drying out."
Road workers will use a "chip
seal" technique in which a coat
ing of oil and crushed pavement
reseals the surface of the asphalt.
A chip seal costs about half as
much as an overlay and is being
used on Campus Drive West to
ensure that an overlay will not be
needed there in the near future.
All the road work should be
completed by Sept. 19 and should
not interfere with Orientation,
the Centennial Celebration or
any academic activity. All roads
will be open for the football
game Sept. 7.
No other road work is planned
for the near future. However, the
stretch between Campus Drive and
El Camino Real on Serra Street
may be chip sealed next spring.
