# Hard lessons for a former God
## 
### 
It has been a summer of lessons for
Illana Zauderer.
A junior music major and star of
several Stanford dramatic produc
tions, Zauderer performed with a
semiprofessional theater company this
summer, and says she has learned a lot
about the dramatic career she intends
to pursue after The Farm — enough,
in fact, to have second thoughts.
"It's a scary field," says the difficult
to-intimidate Zauderer. "There isn't
anything distinct in terms of what steps
you have to take."
One thing that Zauderer, who still
hopes to perform in London after she
graduates, learned is how important
connections are in that line of work.
"The people I worked with told me it's
true that it's who you know that mat
ters," said Zauderer.
And Zauderer, who is the first in
her family to pursue acting and says
she feels utterly unconnected in the
dramatic world, doesn't find that en
couraging.
But Zauderer was encouraged by a
number of her experiences at Theatre-
Works, which produced "Miami
Lights," in which she played the fe
male lead. For one thing, she finally
had the opportunity to work with pro
fessionals.
"I worked with people who've been
in the business for a number of years,"
says Zauderer. "It showed me that
they're real people. It makes my plans
feel real."
Zaud' rer, who played God in this
winter'' Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety pioduction of "One Bad Apple,"
says that acting with professionals this
summer also helped her develop as an
actress and singer. "I worked with a di
rector and a musical director who blew
me away," she says.
"One thing that was really eye
opening was that all the things that go
on behind the scenes [at Stanford pro
ductions] also go on [in professional

productions]. We became such close
friends. It was nice to know it's not
real impersonal."
Another lesson was harder to learn,
and newer to Zauderer: receiving crit
icism from reviewers. Reviews of
"Miami Lights" were generally nega
tive, sometimes strongly so.
"It was hard," acknowledges the re
silient Zauderer. "After I read one re
view it took me a day to snap out of it.
But you have to learn to take the crit
icism as something real without letting
it affect your self-esteem."
At school, Zauderer finds it chal
lenging to balance classwork with act
ing commitments. Rehearsals occa
sionally go well past midnight. And
Zauderer spends much of her free
time working on what she perceives to
be her weaknesses. "If there's some
thing that I think I'm having a problem
with, I work on it," she says.
"It's a huge time commitment," says
Zauderer, who remembers having two
papers due the same week during
freshman year, and beginning both
late into the night, after rehearsals.
Surprisingly, performing hasn't

been a lifelong dream for Zauderer,
who came to Stanford — instead of a
more professionally oriented acting
school — because she has many aca
demic interests.
"1 wasn't really sure I wanted to go
into it.... I wanted to go someplace
that's really good at a lot of things."
Zauderer hadn't even had voice
lessons before she started at Stanford,
where music lecturer Judith Bettina
began giving her instruction. "She sort
of took me under her wing," Zauderer
says.
For next year, Zauderer is looking
forward to more work with Ram's Head.
But her plans may also take her away.
"I would like to do some more stuff
with Theatre Works," says Zauderer.
"I don't want to be completely out in
the world with no connections."
Zauderer says that getting experi
ence in professional acting has "given
me some food for thought." But it
hasn't deterred her determination.
"I'm still hoping to dive headfirst into
a completely unstable lifestyle," she
says.
