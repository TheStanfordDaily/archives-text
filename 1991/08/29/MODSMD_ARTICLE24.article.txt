When Krista Hoeppner went
home to Colorado this summer, she
had her heart set on being a carpen
ter's apprentice. And when her
woodworking aspirations did not pan
out, she doubted she would find an
equally fulfilling job.
Hoeppner, a Stanford junior who
has performed in several Drama De
partment productions, decided to try
out for a major community theater
production "on a fluke. I figured,
'well, at least it will get me out of the
house,'" said Hoeppner, who saw the
audition notice in a newspaper short
ly after her opportunity for a wood
working apprenticeship fell through.
"After the audition, I didn't think
I did well," Hoeppner said, but a
week later she was cast in "Crimes of
the Heart," playing the lead role of
Babe, a 24-year old victim of domes
tic violence who kills her husband
after years of abuse.
The role should present a chal
lenge for Hoeppner, whose serenity
and thoughtfulness stand in stark
contrast to Babe's impulsive emo
tionality.
"Babe doesn't think about things
too much, and of course I think a lot
— more than I should," Hoeppner
said.
An English major with an empha
sis on feminist studies, Hoeppner
said she has never seriously consid
ered majoring in drama, but specu
lates that she "could have been a
drama major. A lot of people think
I'm a drama major."
And it's clear where they got that
idea. For the past two years, Hoepp
ner's dramatic flair has been show
cased on Stanford stages, performing
in"The Seagull" in 1989, "The Dis
pute" last fall and"The Physicists"
this spring.
But while Hoeppner plans to con
tinue auditioning for Stanford drama
productions, she doesn't see herself
taking to professional stages after
college.
"I imagine I will do a significant
amount of community theater," but
pursuing a career in show business is
just too competitive and unstable, she
said. "It's a hard business, and I'd
need to have opportunities kind of
fall into my lap to pursue it as a ca
reer."
And Hoeppner is more than
thrilled that the opportunity to do
"Crimes of the Heart" fell into her
lap this summer. "I can't believe I'm
getting paid to do it," said Hoeppner,
who is receiving a substantial salary
for the play. It will be performed at
the Littleton Town Hall Theater, a
100-120 seat theater-in-the-round
outside of Denver.
With three weeks left before
opening night, Hoeppner said things

are going pretty much as planned.
"Right now we're in the thick of the
worst part of rehearsals," Hoeppner
said. "We're just starting to get our
lines down, and we're just starting to
push it. People arc also just starting
to worry."
Somewhat nervous about bringing
out Babe's personality, Hoeppner
spends around half an hour before
each rehearsal getting into character
— and trying not to think too much.
"I try to let go of that control, that ra
tional way of behaving," Hoeppner
said. "But letting go of that can be
very hard."
Babe "lurches back and forth be
tween emotions, and it's interesting
to play that type of role because she

is so far removed from the people you
come across at Stanford.
"At Stanford, people try to control
their emotions. People are encour
aged to be rational and strength is as
sociated with a lack of emotion. As a
woman, you always want to present a
calm, controlled persona" so people
will take you seriously.
In playing any role, Hoeppner says
you "sort of have to integrate the
character into your life." To do this,
Hoeppner said she's become a little
bit like Babe in the past month. This
summer I've been a little more spon
taneous. I'm laughing a little louder
and sobbing a little louder."
