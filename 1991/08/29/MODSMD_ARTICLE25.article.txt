# Songwriter lays down bottom line

### 
Ay ay ay a: n. Consciousness of and devo
tion to one's personal beliefs and goals.
Stems from introspection and results in
the manifestation of said ideals. Self-es
teem, integrity and educated conviction
that, when made outward, is beneficial
to all.
Adjo Amekudzi, a Stanford junior
majoring in chemical engineering, in
vented the word "Ayayaya" to embody
the spirit of her summer project: an
album, titled "Ayayaya," of West
African high-life music.
She plans to make five albums
total, one per year, and use any prof
its toward her long-range goal of
helping improve the agricultural and
food distribution systems of her na
tive country, Ghana. Approximately
30 percent of Ghana's food goes to
waste each year, due in part to inade
quate food-processing systems.
Amekudzi hopes to make improve
ments by entering Ghana's food-pro
cessing industry.
But she is also doing the Ayayaya al
bums out of a personal love for music
— a love for creating it with energy and
expressiveness, and a love for dancing
to it.
Producer and sound-engineer Her
shel Yatoviz, a Russian-American
who plays a hot African guitar, has
helped Amekudzi make her songs into
showcases for clever melodic ideas
and percussive rhythms that make it
hard to sit still. And at the same time,
Amekudzi's lyrics send thoughtful
messages about both individuality and
cooperation.
Her album project is her Ayayaya,
as defined above: her personal goal
that she developed, looking within
herself for her desires and beliefs, and
then brought out for all to see and
enjoy. It is both something she enjoys
and something that has a larger mean
ing and purpose.
Amekudzi spells out the spirit of
Ayayaya in her song "Bottom Line."
She sings, "You should listen/To your
own true heart/Your soul/Never give
up." She encourages independent
thinking, despite the plethora of doc
trines, categories and classifications
that often seem to decide what we
think for us.
"The bottom line is you and what
you think," she says. "There are so
many opinions in the world, but the
bottom line is you yourself, and you
should go out there, find your one pas
sion and make it real."
As "Bottom Line" continues, "Un
derstand yourself them all ...

In a world so full of opinions/Move up
your ladder/Push at your distance/De
fine your own yard/And make it live to
work and tell its version."
But while she believes in introspec
tion and independence, Amekudzi is
also dedicated to cultural education,
understanding and cooperation.
She learned about the difficulty of
finding common ground across cul
tures during her last two years of high
school, spent in Wales at the United
World College of the Atlantic. There
is one United World College on each
continent, and each is focused on the
goal of international understanding
through education. The Wales college
has approximately 350 students from
over 70 different countries, so obvi
ously there are many markedly differ
ent outlooks to contend with, and
common ground is hard to find.
Amekudzi says, "You had to re-think
your values ... to begin to find a new
base.... It was very trying, but very
worthwhile."
In her song, "Think About the
Children," she finds common ground
for adults in their shared hopes for
their children. She calls parents to
work toward the peaceful world they
want their children to live in by instill
ing in them the open-mindedness nec
essary for cross-cultural understand
ing and international cooperation.
She sings, "No no it doesn't matter
the color of your skin/And it doesn't
matter the language of your
country/It's time we got together/To
celebrate the beautiful moments/In
our life/In our future/International/
For the better/ With each other/And
the children .. ./Ma ma m ma m moth
ers go get together/A da da da d da
das come together/And get to know
one another/Through the children"
Amekudzi will be the general sec
retary of the Stanford African Stu
dents Association for the coming
school year, and she will be working in
many ways to "bring more of the
African experience onto the Stanford
campus." But while she believes
knowledge of a culture's roots is im
portant, she wants to focus on what
African culture is today, despite West
ern influences.
"I think we should start accepting ..
. both sides (Western and African),
there is so much there. ... Then, you
look at all the different aspects which
have become the melange of African
culture today, and you take it from there
and see how you can best use it "
While the African culture has been af
fected by contact with the West, it still

retains its definite identity. As
Amekudzi says, "There are elements of
Westernism in me. But African I am."
Her album and live performances
of her music in the fall will make a
valuable contribution to multicultural
ism at Stanford. She has already
scheduled a Tresidder noon concert
for Nov. 22, and more performances
are being planned. In addition,
Amekudzi will share her knowledge of
African dance in performances with a
dance troupe she founded in the
spring of last year, Four African
Women. The troupe performed at last
year's Bechtel International Festival
and during Africa Week.
While she is dedicated to interna
tional cooperation and peace,
Amekudzi maintains that different
cultures must retain their distinct na
tures. She asks, "How can you truly
have multiculturalism if you are not
strongly cultural too?" Hence, she
seeks to highlight the unique qualities
that differentiate cultures — even
closely related ones like the African
and African-American cultures.
She says,"I think African-Ameri
cans have a distinct identity. They are
African-Americans. Their roots are
African, but they are Americans too..
.. So I would like to see the African
culture and the African-American cul
ture — which arc both very rich —
standing side-by-side."
For example, Amekudzi hopes to
organize a performance that would
feature Four African Women and
Kumbaa, an African-American dance
troupe, and hopefully others, so that
people could observe the similarities
and differences between the two cul
tures and learn about both.
She hopes to see cultures "stand
side-by-side" and interact positively,
but not fuse. Amekudzi recognizes the
difficulty of this proposition, and says,
"How do you compromise without los
ing it all and becoming one big melted
mass of so many cultures fused as
one? I think it is a bigger problem
than many people see, or accept."
Individuality yet cooperation and
understanding, on both the personal
level and the societal level — that's
what she hopes for. Individuals who
respect and accept those around
them, but who also know themselves
and pursue their own dreams. And, in
the same way, educated, interactive
cultures that also retain their distinct
identities. This is Amekudzi's mes
sage, or at least part of it. She defi
nitely has even more to say.
