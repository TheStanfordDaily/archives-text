## Graham meets Navratilova today at U.S. Open 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. - Today
the moment arrives for Debbie Graham. It is
a moment she's been waiting for since she
was in her early teens and first showed signs
of greatness on the tennis court.
Back then, she idolized Martina
Navratilova, perhaps the greatest woman
player of all time. When Graham steps onto
the stadium court in the USTA National
Tennis Center today, she will be going
against Navratilova in a second-round match
at the U.S. Open.

Graham, who turned professional just two
weeks ago, scored a decisive win in her first
round match over 15 year-old junior
sensation Lindsay Davenport. With an
erratic but often untouchable serve, Graham
downed the girls' 18-and under, 6-3, 6-2.
The 6-foot-2 Davenport is one of the few
players who stands taller than Graham but
the height didn't help her against a serve
that moved at better than 100 miles per
hour.
With that first victory under her belt,
Graham now looks ahead to Navratilova,
whom she played last summer in Los
Angeles. Navaritlova won easily.

"I remember when I played her, I was
completely in awe of her," Graham said.
"They introduced me as the NCAA
champion and her as a living legend."
But Navratilova has lost a step, is
suffering emotionally over the breakup of
her relationship with Judy Nelson, and is
coming off a summer in which she skipped
playing tournaments to compete in
Team Tennis.
Yesterday, Graham played a first-round
doubles match with Georgia senior Shannan
McCarthy. The duo bested Anke Huber and
Julie Halard 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. Next up for
Graham and McCarthy are the 12th-seeded

pair of Mary Lou Daniels and Lise Gregory.
Tami and Teri Whitlinger also won a
doubles match yesterday, scoring a 7-6 (7-5),
7-5 decision over Ginger Helgeson and Rene
Alter.
Sandra Birch fell in the first round of
singles to Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, 6-3,
6-1.
On the men's side, NCAA singles
champion Jared Palmer lost a titanic
struggle to Rodolphe Gilbert, 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 1-
6, 7-6 (7-4).
Palmer is still alive in doubles, though, as
he and partner Jonathan Stark eliminated
Jorge Lozano and Joey Rive, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
