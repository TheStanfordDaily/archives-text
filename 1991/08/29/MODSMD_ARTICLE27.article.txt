## A 						tour of the Open 
### 
Flushing Meadows, N.Y.
The U.S. Open provides
such delighful juxtaposi
tions: the sublime and the
ridiculous, the ritz and the glitz,
the giants and the little people.
Seeing Aaron Krickstein
bounce Andre Agassi almost
before the tournament even got
started, watching Ivan Lendl
come back from two sets down to
defeat a 19-year-old unknown
named Richard Krajicek,
observing Jimmy Connors' heroic
effort against Patrick McEnroe
— this is what the Open is
supposed to be. CBS said it best,
calling the tournament "The
World's Toughest Tennis."
At the same time, one can't
help but laugh at time. Hear
Monica Seles ramble on about
how she'd like to wear some
radical new clothes on the court
to contribute something to the
game and you might need a sick
bag.
Monica, whatever you've got
in store (my guess is she'll wear
her ridiculous outfit in the third
round) will not advance your
sport. Playing great tennis is the
way to do that.
Of course, when you're 17 and
worth millions, you can do and
say pretty much whatever you
want. You could even afford to
attend the Open if you weren't a
player. Otherwise, a mortgage
might be in order.
Cheap tickets are $30-40 —
you almost have to buy them
from scalpers unless you're an
IBM vice president — and food
prices are beyond belief. Three
dollar hot dogs. Only $2.50 for a
bagel with cream cheese.
Bud Collins of The Boston
Globe and NBC-TV doubtless
doesn't pay for his food, but
that's OK. I always figured
Collins would be a jerk in person,
but he really isn't. Watching
Collins eagerly grant an
autograph to a young boy who
recognized him made me realize
that the shtick he does on the
tube is his real personality. Sure,
he's downright goofy, but
basically a good guy.
Also earning personality
points: Wimbledon champ
Michael Stich. Speaking
impeccable English, Stich
demonstrates an intellect and
down-to-earth sensibility that
suggests a successful, stable life.
That doesn't mesh well with the
pro tour, though, so Stich may
well realize he should move on
before too many years. Enjoy him
while he lasts.

Question this reporter
couldn't ask but wanted to:
Arantxa, why do you think you're
as good as Steffi, Monica and
Gaby when you aren't in that
group?
Positive fashion trend:
Gabriela Sabatini's new black
baseball cap. Tres chic.
Negative fasion trend: Black
shoes on the tennis court. Give
us a break, Reebok.
The parity in the men's
game has never been
greater; while the women,
meanwhile, are still neatly
clumped into three groups: best,
very good, everyone else.
So few dramatic upsets occur
in the women's game. Among the
reasons why are challengers'
inability to hold serve and a
tendency to view the top five or
so as unbeatable. Krajicek knew
Lendl would have trouble
breaking him so he figured he
had a chance; Andrea Temesvari
wasn't figuring on overpowering
Steffi Graf with a rocket serve
and never had a prayer.
Mary Joe Fernandez sits on
the fringe, mentally prepared but
physically incapable of matching
the power of Seles and Graf.
Jennifer Capriati is crossing over
into the elite. She caught
Martina Navratilova when she
was down at Wimbledon and
beat her. She caught Seles
coming back from injury and beat
her, too.
Eventually, she likely would've
beaten both of them, for while
she is no surefire No. 1 in the
world, Capriati is a definite top-5
fixture for the '90s.
For Capriati, reaching
greatness is almost inevitable.
Her impeccable timing just
means it might arrive sooner
than planned.

they'll soon find him in a real
newspaper. Thanks for the ride.
