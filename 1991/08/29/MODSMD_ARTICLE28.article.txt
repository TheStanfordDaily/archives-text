# Cardinal readies to open season
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Every football team starts the
season with questions, and the
Stanford Cardinal is no
exception. Most important
among those questions is: can the
Cardinal produce its second
winning season in 11 years, with
one of the nation's toughest
schedules?
The answers won't begin
rolling in for another nine days,
when the Cardinal opens at
Stanford Stadium with a
nationally televised contest
against Washington. But if
advance reports are any
indication, 1991 should be a good
season for the men in Cardinal
and White.
For starters, Stanford returns
18 of them, the most in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The top
returning starter is none other
than Glyn Milburn, the nation's
leader in all-purpose running last
year.
Milburn averaged over 200
yards a game of running, catching
and returning, and is a preseason
Ail-American according to most
major publications.
Stanford also returns fullback
Tommy Vardell and quarterback
Jason Palumbis to complete the
starting backfield. Stanford's
offense will also boast of 1,500
pounds of linemen.
So while scoring points
shouldn't be a big concern,
stopping other teams presents
more questions. Outside
linebackers Dave Garnett and
Ron George may prove
themselves to be the best tandem
in the nation at that spot.
The defensive line is an
unknown, as the Cardinal had
problems getting a consistent
pass rush last season. But most of

the Cardinal linemen are back
this year and a couple freshman
should also help out.
The secondary, which
struggled early last year before
stabilizing for the stretch run,
was hurt by the loss of Kevin

Scott, to the NFL, and Jimmy
Klein, to a knee injury. Seyon
Albert is solid at free safety, but
the two-deep contains.
The biggest problem is the
schedule that is the stuff that
keeps coaches awake at night.

opener Sept. 7.
