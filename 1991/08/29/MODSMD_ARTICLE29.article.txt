# Rouse breaks world backstroke record

This year has hardly been an ordinary one for
senior Jeff Rouse. The star backstroker started by
breaking his wrist in late January.
Despite the injury, he came back to smash the
American record in the 100-yard backstroke at the
NCAA Championships in March. Sunday, Rouse
shattered the world record in the 100-meter
backstroke, becoming the first person to break the 54-
second barrier.
Rouse's record capped a strong performance at the
Pan-Pacific Championships in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada. The four-day meet, which ran Thursday
through Sunday, featured the top two U.S. swimmers
in each event competing against the best swimmers
from the Pacific Rim.
Rouse and sophomore Summer Sanders each
brought home three gold medals to help the U.S. team
dominate the meet. Incoming fresahman Jenny

Thompson also captured a gold medal, winning the
50-meter freestyle, while junior Lea Loveless and
graduate Jill Johnson took fourth-place finishes in the
100-meter backstroke and the 200-meter breaststroke,
respectively.
But Rouse was the big story.
In the 100-meterbackstroke Thursday, he missed
Berkoffs mark of 54.51 by .16 seconds. He did win the
event by half a second, however, and took home his
second gold medal Saturday by winning the 200-meter
backstroke.
Then, in Sunday's 400-meter medley relay, Rouse's
leadoff time of 53.93 destroyed the world record.
Teammates Mark Henderson, Mike Barrowman and
Matt Biondi continued to run away from the field, and
Rouse picked up a third gold.
Sanders, perhaps America's finest female swimmer
these days, started her meet with a one-second victory
in the 200-meter butterfly Thursday. She then won the
400-meter individual medley by nearly four seconds
Friday, and the 200 1M bv 2.5 seconds Sundav.
