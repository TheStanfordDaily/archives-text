## Splish splash, having a blast at San Jose's Raging Waters 
### Erin Jordan 
Sitting at the top of a 30-foot, almost
vertical drop awaiting the plunge I'm
about to take, I can't help but find the
same words repeating themselves over
and over in my mind.
"1 can't believe I'm doing this. I don't
believe I'm doing this. I must be crazy!!"
But then the suntanned guy in the
lifeguard T-shirt gives me the signal, and
off I go into the wet, blue yonder.
I'm at Raging Waters water theme
park, and as I barrel down the terribly
steep runway on the slick water sled that
was ever so kindly provided for me, the
term "holding on for dear life" gains new
meaning. And then, just as I am running
out of air for screaming, the drop ends
and I'm skating across the pool getting
drenched by the various strategically
placed water fountains in my path. Before
I know it, I'm coming up for air with a
huge smile on my face and racing to get in
line for another slide.
At Raging Waters, there's plenty of fun
for everyone to choose from. The over 30
different water attractions at the park
range from the fierce and furious curves
and drops of "White Lightning/Blue
Thunder" and the long, winding inner
tube ride of "Serpentine" to the simple,
quiet peace of the "Endless River." All of
you thrill-seekers out there are bound to
be pleased.
And for those of us who can't help but
revert to childhood when confronted with
a glorious jungle gym, there are a number
of smaller play-pools in which all mature,
adult tendencies can be ignored and the
water wars can begin. The elaborate
"Wacky Water Works" is more than
adequately equipped with the squirt-gun
fountains and tunnel slides required for
any respectable playground.
I can't think of a better way to beat the
summer heat. (If the sun and water ever
get to be too much, then you can always

take a break from frying your body and fry
your mind instead in the video arcade
located in the park.)
Unfortunately, we're not the only ones
who know about Raging Waters, but don't
let the occasionally long lines intimidate
you. They move faster than you'd think.
And besides, you'll be able to work on
that tan you've been trying to get all
summer.
At $14.95 for admission, this kind of
water fun may be a bit too dear, but the
$5 discount after 3 p.m. may set it in a
more reasonable price range for those of
us watching our pennies. Open daily from
10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Raging Waters is the
perfect place to spend a hot summer day,
or even a cool one.
And if you decide to spend a day
splashing around in the sun, remember
to:
• Bring food for a picnic. There are
plenty of places to sit and enjoy a
homemade lunch, or you can take a
chance at one of the many concession
stands located at the park.
• Bring a friend. You'll need someone
to splash around with in the "Endless
River," but more importantly, you'll need
someone to sit with on Raging Waters'
newest ride, "The Great White Shark." It
features a double inner tube, a wild ride
and the sea-faring menace himself, the
great white shark. It all starts out
innocently enough, but as you round the
second turn you are plunged helplessly
into the jaws of the beast and treated to
the rest of the ride in pitch blackness. An
interesting experience, if nothing else.
• Bring your suntan lotion and don't
forget your towel, but most of all, bring all
your playful personality and have a great
time.

Raging Waters is located in San Jose's Lake
Cunningham Regional Park, 1 'A miles east
of U.S. Highway 101 at the Tully Road exit.
