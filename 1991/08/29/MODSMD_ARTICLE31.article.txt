# Western frontier re-opens in 'O Pioneers!'
## 
### Lisa Lawrence Ben Winkes 
One dark and stormy night,
the cast of "Les Miscrables" left
the theater for a Broadway bar
and grill. Then out of nowhere
came a cyclone that swept them
to the heart of Nebraska.
Well, not exactly. But some of
their pathos and passion has
taken root in the cornfields and
prairies of Theatre Works' latest
production, "O Pioneers!"
Adapted by Darrah Cloud
from Willa Cather's novel of the
same title, "O Pioneers!" is a
resounding musical and dramatic
exploration of the immigrant
experience on the American
frontier. Through the Bergsons, a
Swedish immigrant family living
in late 19th century Nebraska,
the show reveals the financial
and psychological struggles of
immigration.
The family, anchored by the
plucky and steadfast Alexandra
Bergson, must first conquer the
dry, stubborn land of their
homestead. After years of
hardship they achieve success,
only to face the problem of
reconciling the profound values
of their humble past with the
emptiness of their present lives.
For two of Alexandra's
brothers, social status, gramo
phones and brand-new bathtubs
crowd out their dead father's
love of family and the land.

Alexandra retains her father's
dreams, but grows weary of
carrying the burden of keeping
those dreams alive.
The youngest brother, Emil,
cannot even remember his father
and can't appreciate the current
good times because he lacks a
sense of earlier hardship
"O Pioneers!" captures their
stories in a poignant blend of
stirring drama, powerful music
and bittersweet romance. Ingrid
Gerstmann exhibits great range
in portraying both the tender and
tough sides of Alexandra.
The music, composed by Kim
Sherman, is sensational. Jeffrey
Alons sings a particularly moving
"Ave Maria/Gloria" in a church
scene that beautifully symbolizes
the cycles of life and death.
Robert Kclley's direction
complements the individual
performances by orchestrating
scenes crisply. And, despite its
simplicity, the set adds a
consistently authentic air to the
acting.
If you're interested in this
colorful portion of the American
experience, if you want to hear a
youth say "1 don't want to go to
law school" or if you just like
good theater, you should find the
time to go see "O Pioneers!"

"O Pioneers!" is playing through
Sept. 14 at the Mountain View
Center for the Performing Arts. For
