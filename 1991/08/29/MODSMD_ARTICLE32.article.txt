Hitchcock lives
"Dead Again," starring Kenneth
Branagh, Andy Garcia and Emma
Thompson
Wow.
After seeing "Dead Again,"
that's all I can say. It was that
exciting. It was that suspenseful.
It was that original.
It was that good. It would
have to be if it left me speech
less.
"Dead Again," directed by
and starring Kenneth Branagh
— who also held the dual title of
director/actor in last year's
"Henry V" — is a film about
reincarnation. But that's not all.
The story begins in the past —
the 1940s, to be exact — with the
sensational murder case of
pianist Margaret Strauss. A
series of newspaper clips flash by
chronicling the murder and the
trial that found her composer
husband Roman guilty of the
crime.
The next scene is of Roman
on his way to the electric chair.
As he marches down the hall, the
pair of scissors he has stolen
becomes evident. And as he
approaches the figure at the end
of the hall, he raises the weapon
up to kill her.
Fifty years in the future,
Grace wakes up screaming.
I realize that sounds a little
confusing, but really, it's not.
Grace (Emma Thompson) was
found trying to climb over the
gate of a Los Angeles Catholic
home for boys. Since then, she
has had these recurring night
mares of — you guessed it —
Roman and Margaret. Only, she
doesn't know that's who she's
dreaming of. No one does.
Mike Church (Branagh) is a
private investigator called in by
the head of the boys' school to
find Grace's family because, at
the opening of the film, Grace
can't talk. In fact, we don't even
know her name which, as it later
turns out, isn't really Grace. But
I digress.
The long and the short of it
— without giving too much away
— is that Grace seems to be hav
ing visions of a past life. Through
hypnosis, Grace uncovers bits
and pieces of this past, as does
Mike.
And that's all I'm going to tell
you. But it's only the beginning.
"Dead Again" has been billed
as a Hitchcock-like thriller, and
believe me, it lives up to that rep
utation. I doubted it would, being
a huge Hitchcock fan, but
Branagh does the master of sus
pense proud. I (not to toot my
own horn or anything) can usu
ally figure out where a movie is
leading. Not this time. Not even
close.
Wow.

Black and white
"True Identity," starring Lenny
Henry, Frank Langella and
Charles Lane
"True Identity" is one of those
simple pleasures in life: a film with
a stupid-sounding premise that sur
prises you by being an entertaining
and well-crafted piece of work.
Lenny Henry, an enormously
popular comedian in his native
England, stars as Miles Pope, a
struggling black actor who acci
dentally learns the true identity of
a major mobster. In order to hide
from the killer sent to rub him out,
he disguises himself as a white man.
While this sounds like an ex
ceedingly dumb idea for a film,
it's to the credit of Henry, direc
tor Charles Lane, and makeup
designers John Caglione Jr. and
Doug Drexler that Miles' charade
is not only believable, but hilari
ous and engaging as well.
Henry's makeup is so convinc
ing that it takes a good 10 min
utes before you realize it's not a
different actor portraying the
white Miles. After that, though,
it's the character beneath the
makeup that holds your attention,
not the prosthetics and paint.
Henry, a skilled performer
with chameleon-like impression
ist skills and a great sense of
comic timing, could have carried
the film on his own. When he gets
mistaken for his own hit man, his
ease in sliding into the manner
isms and speech patterns of the
stereotypical Italian Mafioso is a
genuine treat.
Luckily for Henry, the film's
script also gives him some great
material to work with. Director
Lane, who also stars in the film

as the makeup artist responsible
for Miles' disguise, worked for
months to improve Andy Breck
man's script, which originally con
tained more slapstick elements.
Both Henry and Lane felt Miles
needed to be more human, to feel
fear and a little bit of contempt
at having to hide his true self.
The film succeeds admirably in
this area. When Miles is white,
he never flaunts the newfound
ease with which he can conduct
his daily life. His biggest indul
gence at being free from racism
is to hail a cab for a black man
who's been passed by three times.
While the obligatory romantic
interest, embodied in Anne-Marie
Johnson, is a pointless plot twist,
Lane's character has a refreshing
fondness for "women with curves,"
and his numerous encounters with
larger women are played with as
much subtlety and tact as the sit
uations can possibly allow.
James Earl Jones also turns in
a wonderful performance as him
self which makes one wonder why
this man doesn't do more come
dy. I can only imagine it's because
films as surprisingly likable as
"True Identity" don't come along
very often.

A date to forget
"Mystery Date," starring Ethan
Hawlce, Teri Polo and B.D. Wong
While I am certain that
Jonathan Wacks' new film "Mys
tery Date" is a thorough waste of
time for anyone over the age of
13, I can't say a pre-teen wishing
to spend $7 wouldn't enjoy it.
But the film clearly isn't de
signed for such a young audience;

that should give you an idea of
how bad it is.
"Mystery Date" is an uneasy
mixture of dark comedy and ado
lescent fantasy that never
achieves the stable tone of such
cult classics as "Heathers" and
"After Hours." While "Mystery
Date's" cast rivals the casts of
those other films, its script gets
left standing on the front porch.
The story is about Tom
Mchugh (Ethan Hawke), a young
man who looks like he's ready to
enter high school but is suppos
edly college age and visiting
home. Aided by his older broth
er, he prepares for a date — ap
parently his first — with the
woman of his dreams, his next
door neighbor Geena.
While on the date, Mchugh is
mistaken for his older brother,
who has been pretending to be
away at Stanford Law School, but
instead has secretly been involved
with crooked cops and Chinese
gangsters at home. This puts the
innocent couple in a whole lot of
trouble, but helps them have a
spectacular first date on the run.
The preparation for the date is
an excruciatingly long exposition,
hampered by the moronic por
trayal of Tom's brother by Brian
McNamara ("Anachrophobia").
Hawke, however, is quite good as
the younger Mchugh, and the role

allows him to show his talents
more than the sentimental one he
played in "Dead Poet's Society."
Writers Parker Bennett and
Terry Runte try to save the char
acter of Geena by making her in
telligent instead of just good
looking, but they only embarrass
themselves by demonstrating they
have no idea how an intelligent
person acts. "I find you attractive
in a very real and a very hormonal
way," says Mchugh of her.
Teri Polo as Geena does not
help matters much, as she lacks
the appeal of someone like Re
becca DeMornay in the similar,
but far better, "Risky Business."
By contrast, B. D. Wong —
who won a Tony award for his
performance in "M. Butterfly" in
1988 — plays the very appealing
villain Mr. Lew, a Chinese-Amer
ican godfather. Unfortunately,
the performance is lost in a some
what racist interpretation of
"mystic" Chinatown.
Fisher Stevens also puts in a
notable performance as the flow
er boy who turns violent after
being refused a tip. The joke,
though, is clearly a rip-off from
"Better Off Dead," a fair movie
that looks good by comparison.
If someone asks you to go see
"Mystery Date," politely tell them
you'll be washing your hair.

A date to forget
"Mystery Date," starring Ethan
Hawlce, Teri Polo and B.D. Wong
While I am certain that
Jonathan Wacks' new film "Mys
tery Date" is a thorough waste of
time for anyone over the age of
13, I can't say a pre-teen wishing
to spend $7 wouldn't enjoy it.
But the film clearly isn't de
signed for such a young audience;

that should give you an idea of
how bad it is.
"Mystery Date" is an uneasy
mixture of dark comedy and ado
lescent fantasy that never
achieves the stable tone of such
cult classics as "Heathers" and
"After Hours." While "Mystery
Date's" cast rivals the casts of
those other films, its script gets
left standing on the front porch.
The story is about Tom
Mchugh (Ethan Hawke), a young
man who looks like he's ready to
enter high school but is suppos
edly college age and visiting
home. Aided by his older broth
er, he prepares for a date — ap
parently his first — with the
woman of his dreams, his next
door neighbor Geena.
While on the date, Mchugh is
mistaken for his older brother,
who has been pretending to be
away at Stanford Law School, but
instead has secretly been involved
with crooked cops and Chinese
gangsters at home. This puts the
innocent couple in a whole lot of
trouble, but helps them have a
spectacular first date on the run.
The preparation for the date is
an excruciatingly long exposition,
hampered by the moronic por
trayal of Tom's brother by Brian
McNamara ("Anachrophobia").
Hawke, however, is quite good as
the younger Mchugh, and the role

allows him to show his talents
more than the sentimental one he
played in "Dead Poet's Society."
Writers Parker Bennett and
Terry Runte try to save the char
acter of Geena by making her in
telligent instead of just good
looking, but they only embarrass
themselves by demonstrating they
have no idea how an intelligent
person acts. "I find you attractive
in a very real and a very hormonal
way," says Mchugh of her.
Teri Polo as Geena does not
help matters much, as she lacks
the appeal of someone like Re
becca DeMornay in the similar,
but far better, "Risky Business."
By contrast, B. D. Wong —
who won a Tony award for his
performance in "M. Butterfly" in
1988 — plays the very appealing
villain Mr. Lew, a Chinese-Amer
ican godfather. Unfortunately,
the performance is lost in a some
what racist interpretation of
"mystic" Chinatown.
Fisher Stevens also puts in a
notable performance as the flow
er boy who turns violent after
being refused a tip. The joke,
though, is clearly a rip-off from
"Better Off Dead," a fair movie
that looks good by comparison.
If someone asks you to go see
"Mystery Date," politely tell them
you'll be washing your hair.

"Dead Again," starring Kenneth
Branagh, Andy Garcia and Emma

Wow.
After seeing "Dead Again,"
that's all I can say. It was that
exciting. It was that suspenseful.
It was that original.
It was that good. It would
have to be if it left me speech
less.
"Dead Again," directed by
and starring Kenneth Branagh
— who also held the dual title of
director/actor in last year's
"Henry V" — is a film about
reincarnation. But that's not all.
The story begins in the past —
the 1940s, to be exact — with the
sensational murder case of
pianist Margaret Strauss. A
series of newspaper clips flash by
chronicling the murder and the
trial that found her composer
husband Roman guilty of the
crime.
The next scene is of Roman
on his way to the electric chair.
As he marches down the hall, the
pair of scissors he has stolen
becomes evident. And as he
approaches the figure at the end
of the hall, he raises the weapon
up to kill her.
Fifty years in the future,
Grace wakes up screaming.
I realize that sounds a little
confusing, but really, it's not.
Grace (Emma Thompson) was
found trying to climb over the
gate of a Los Angeles Catholic
home for boys. Since then, she
has had these recurring night
mares of — you guessed it —
Roman and Margaret. Only, she
doesn't know that's who she's
dreaming of. No one does.
Mike Church (Branagh) is a
private investigator called in by
the head of the boys' school to
find Grace's family because, at
the opening of the film, Grace
can't talk. In fact, we don't even
know her name which, as it later
turns out, isn't really Grace. But
I digress.
The long and the short of it
— without giving too much away
— is that Grace seems to be hav
ing visions of a past life. Through
hypnosis, Grace uncovers bits
and pieces of this past, as does
Mike.
And that's all I'm going to tell
you. But it's only the beginning.
"Dead Again" has been billed
as a Hitchcock-like thriller, and
believe me, it lives up to that rep
utation. I doubted it would, being
a huge Hitchcock fan, but
Branagh does the master of sus
pense proud. I (not to toot my
own horn or anything) can usu
ally figure out where a movie is
leading. Not this time. Not even
close.

Black and white
"True Identity," starring Lenny
Henry, Frank Langella and
Charles Lane
"True Identity" is one of those
simple pleasures in life: a film with
a stupid-sounding premise that sur
prises you by being an entertaining
and well-crafted piece of work.
Lenny Henry, an enormously
popular comedian in his native
England, stars as Miles Pope, a
struggling black actor who acci
dentally learns the true identity of
a major mobster. In order to hide
from the killer sent to rub him out,
he disguises himself as a white man.
While this sounds like an ex
ceedingly dumb idea for a film,
it's to the credit of Henry, direc
tor Charles Lane, and makeup
designers John Caglione Jr. and
Doug Drexler that Miles' charade
is not only believable, but hilari
ous and engaging as well.
Henry's makeup is so convinc
ing that it takes a good 10 min
utes before you realize it's not a
different actor portraying the
white Miles. After that, though,
it's the character beneath the
makeup that holds your attention,
not the prosthetics and paint.
Henry, a skilled performer
with chameleon-like impression
ist skills and a great sense of
comic timing, could have carried
the film on his own. When he gets
mistaken for his own hit man, his
ease in sliding into the manner
isms and speech patterns of the
stereotypical Italian Mafioso is a
genuine treat.
Luckily for Henry, the film's
script also gives him some great
material to work with. Director
Lane, who also stars in the film

as the makeup artist responsible
for Miles' disguise, worked for
months to improve Andy Breck
man's script, which originally con
tained more slapstick elements.
Both Henry and Lane felt Miles
needed to be more human, to feel
fear and a little bit of contempt
at having to hide his true self.
The film succeeds admirably in
this area. When Miles is white,
he never flaunts the newfound
ease with which he can conduct
his daily life. His biggest indul
gence at being free from racism
is to hail a cab for a black man
who's been passed by three times.
While the obligatory romantic
interest, embodied in Anne-Marie
Johnson, is a pointless plot twist,
Lane's character has a refreshing
fondness for "women with curves,"
and his numerous encounters with
larger women are played with as
much subtlety and tact as the sit
uations can possibly allow.
James Earl Jones also turns in
a wonderful performance as him

this man doesn't do more come
