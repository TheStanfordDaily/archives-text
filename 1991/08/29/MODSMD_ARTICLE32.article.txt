Hitchcock lives
"Dead Again," starring Kenneth
Branagh, Andy Garcia and Emma
Thompson
Wow.
After seeing "Dead Again,"
that's all I can say. It was that
exciting. It was that suspenseful.
It was that original.
It was that good. It would
have to be if it left me speech
less.
"Dead Again," directed by
and starring Kenneth Branagh
— who also held the dual title of
director/actor in last year's
"Henry V" — is a film about
reincarnation. But that's not all.
The story begins in the past —
the 1940s, to be exact — with the
sensational murder case of
pianist Margaret Strauss. A
series of newspaper clips flash by
chronicling the murder and the
trial that found her composer
husband Roman guilty of the
crime.
The next scene is of Roman
on his way to the electric chair.
As he marches down the hall, the
pair of scissors he has stolen
becomes evident. And as he
approaches the figure at the end
of the hall, he raises the weapon
up to kill her.
Fifty years in the future,
Grace wakes up screaming.
