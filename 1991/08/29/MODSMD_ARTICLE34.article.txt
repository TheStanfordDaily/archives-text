Editor's picks:
Cookie corner
• Mrs. Fields — Sure, it's a chain, but Mrs.
Fields still has some of the best cookies
around. With a choice of milk or dark
chocolate, nuts or no nuts, and even
cholesterol or no cholesterol, this cookie
lover's haven is sure to please.
• Cookie Habit — Located in the Stan
ford Shopping Center, Cookie Habit is
where the cafes around campus (i.e., the
Poli Sci Cafe) get their cookies. And
they're even better when you buy them
from the source.
• Blue Chip Cookies — Constantly voted

"Best Cookie in the Bay Area," Blue
Chip's cookies are practically a staple in
the area. Unfortunately, the closest loca
tion to Stanford is the Valley Fair Shop
ping Center in San Jose.

TV this week:
The powers-that-be in television seem
to be taking it easy this week, as the air
waves are dominated by college football
and the usual summer reruns.
But some original programming can be
found in the various tributes surrounding
the 25th anniversary of "Star Trek," such
as this weekend's edition of "Entertain
ment This Week."
Reruns of note include the final episode
of "thirtysomething" on Tuesday and
tonight's entertaining "Cheers" rebroad
cast, in which Lilith's favorite lab rat goes
to that big maze in the sky.
