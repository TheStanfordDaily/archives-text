						midsummer nightmare 
### 
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
things didn't quite go my
way this summer.
My dog — a deaf, dyspeptic,
and prodigiously diarrhetic
spaniel of advanced age — fell
down the stairs, broke a mess of
ribs and ended up in a portable
ventilator that made her look like
a cross between Lassie and a
Toyota. Then Michael Landon
died.
And then, when I realized,
after seven years of working at
the same summer camp in Rhode
Island, that I not only don't like
kids, but rather took particular
glee in watching them make each
other cry, I quit my job, scraped
together what little cash I had,
and drove west, hoping for better
luck at Stanford.
When I got news that Hurri
cane Bob had done the Texas
Two-Step through the camp,
draining the Idyllic Little Lake in
the Woods and drowning a good
ly number of 12-year-olds, I
almost thought about going back,
but I couldn't. It was too late. I'd
forged my way across the nation,
to make a new life for myself,
and now I had to do the manly
thing, as my Uncle Crusty would
say, and get a job.
Uncle Crusty is a farmer, of
course. Even as a wee tyke I'd
had qualms about a man who
squeezed cow nipples for a living
and annointed himself my Model
of Machismo, but the lesson
stuck. Without a job, I was lower
than the mud on a piglet's belly,
and smellier.
Lots smellier.
So early one morning I set out
from my pad in Escondido Vil
lage to scour the campus, figur
ing that Stanford employers
would be kind to one of their
own. I headed straight for the
Bookstore, figuring I had
pumped enough cash into its cof
fers in the last two years to keep
a formerly federally subsidized
researcher on a satisfactory
salary, let alone a lowly Book
store clerk.
AH of these dreams, of course,
were predicated upon the assump
tion that I was qualified to be a
lowly Bookstore clerk.
My mistake.
As I entered the personnel
office, a woman in six-inch heels
with comparable nails clamped her
hands to her hips, looked me over
from head to toe and asked me if I
had a Ph.D. I told her that I was
working on my 8.A., and was
already known for my 8.5., but
that didn't seem to cut it. Then she
asked me for five references that
weren't relatives or former
employers, which left my friends
Zeb and Harvey, who just aren't
that reliable, especially since the
big hubcap deal went bad.
I thought about giving the
woman a peek at my Ninja Turtle
boxers, which reduce most mem
bers of her gender (OK, just the
one woman I've actually shown
them to) to ga-ga eyes, but she
didn't seem the type. So I did the
next best thing: I threw a
tantrum. A ranting, raving,
spoileder-than-thou tantrum. I
threw books, and jumped up and
down, and pulled my hair, and to
top it all off, stomped out of the
office and out of the store.
Or so I intended. I made the
oft-fatal error of trying to go out

through the In door, and paid
dearly. I slammed into the glass,
ricocheted into a grad student
and had to pick myself up off the
floor and walk all the way over to
the registers to find the Out
door.
This only made me angrier, by
reminding me of the beef I had
with the people who remodeled
the place. Sure, the cafe looks
great, even if it's a little out of
place next to the science text
books, but the positioning of the
Out door is a serious inconve
nience to those of us who like to
shoplift.
(That was a joke, by the way.
Yes, you with the beady eyes and
the cheap suit, who gets paid $15
an hour to lurk by the greeting
cards for five hours at a stretch
and tackle anyone who walks out
with a pencil. I'm kidding.)
At this point, I was despon
dent. If the Bookstore was too
good for me, what did I have to
look forward to? Food Service?
Tresidder Express? Making sure
that Don Kennedy's rosewood
commode keeps its spiffy shine?
My spirits were at their nadir
when I happened across a copy
of The Weekly, tossed carelessly,
shamelessly, disgracefully in the
trash. If I could only lay hands on
the fiend who had perpetrated
the foul deed, I told myself, I
could die content, but that satis
faction was denied me. So I did
what I could, retrieving the mal
treated gem of journalism and
beginning to read. And there,
before my eyes, praise the gods, I
found a "Help Wanted" section.
Here were jobs, jobs and yet
more jobs, each one more tanta
lizing than the next. Stanford
Wax Museum Assistant. ("Help
us make a life-size model of Stu
Reges out of candle stubs!")
Cheerleading Camp Counselor.
("Teach impressionable 16-year
old girls to make every sentence
they utter for the next two years
rhyme!") Literary Researcher for
Prof. Diane Wood Middlebrook.
I almost applied for that one,
until I developed reservations
about breaking into famous peo
ple's houses to steal their diaries.
In the end, I applied for the
job that my destiny seemed to
demand: Personal Assistant to
former Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell. I was a white
male, dammit, and it was time to
live up to my ethnic heritage. I'd
have to disarm the Democrat
Detector in the Hoover elevator,
of course, but it would be worth
it. It would make my Uncle
Crusty proud.

Ed Heinemann isn't thrilled about
the resurrection of the photo at the
top of this column, but there isn't a
hell of a lot he can do about it.
