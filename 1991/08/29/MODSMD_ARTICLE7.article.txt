## A 						summer of upheavals 
### 
This has been a monumental summer, no
doubt about that. We are in the middle of a
story, several stories in fact, to which nobody
really knows the ending.
On the local level, Stanford is losing a well-liked
and well-respected president amid much turmoil and
controversy, but the University is still gaining interna
tional prestige as a model for higher education.
On the national level, people are grappling with
many confrontational social issues, while the face
of government is rapidly changing.
On the global level, the entire infrastructure of
the Soviet Union and its entrenched political sys
tem is falling apart at the seams.
But is there a way we can encapsulate the events
of the summer of 1991 into a neat little package?
Should we find the essence of these past three
months and assign a label to it?
In one way, the summer of 1991 was the Summer
of Controversy. Many issues that had loomed over
Stanford for many years brought negative ramifica
tions to the University. Administration and faculty
became divided over how best to put the indirect
cost controversy, and the allegations of negligence
associated with it, behind them.
A confrontation between the Department of
Athletics and community members who use Encina
Gym has put both sides at odds over the use of

recreational facilities. Reports of sexual harass
ment and unfair treatment at the Medical School
are causing embarrassment for the University at a
time when openness and multicultualism are at the
forefront of what the administration is trying to
achieve on campus.
All these problems are creating acrimony at a
time when Stanford is preparing itself for a jubilant
Centennial Celebration.
And in yet another way, the summer of 1991 is
the Summer of Hope. Stanford looks to its 100 th
year with well-earned optimism for its future. Stan
ford approaches its second century with many prob
lems to solve, but it has every reason to believe that
the work it produces will continue to have profound
influence all over the world.
It is a gross oversimplification to assign any one
brand to a given season, year or decade in history.
There are simply too many facets to take into con
sideration and too many complexities involved to
boil everything down into a single concept.
The summer of 1991 at Stanford has been no
different. We can only say that a mixture of reflec
tion on past mistakes, the need and the will to pol
ish its tarnished reputation, and the optimism with
which it proceeds towards the future have placed
Stanford in an exciting, pivotal position at this time
in its history.
