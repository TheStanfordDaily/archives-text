Synergy program
won't flourish in a
different location

I am outraged at the Universi
ty's decision to demolish Synergy
and other Row homes. As a
Stanford alumna, but more
importantly, a Synergy alumna, I
am deeply disturbed by the casu
al destruction of the place in
which I grew and learned the
most during my college experi
ence — not a series of class
rooms, but the brown, shingled
house on top of the hill, with its
living rooms, bright hallways,
wild garden, happy kitchen and
yes, even a sun-drenched roof.
Living at Synergy was not only
what made my years at Stanford
rich and culturally alive, but it
was the beginning place for my
whole life as it now is.
Without Synergy, there would
have been no place for me at
Stanford — I am certain of this.
If the University chooses to

destroy Synergy, 1 will have no
choice but to withdraw any sup
port — financial or otherwise —
from the University, and 1 will
encourage all of my associates to
do so as well.
Moving the "Synergy pro
gram" to another building is not
an acceptable solution. Only Syn
ergy as is it now stands (a recog
nized historical landmark) can
offer the physical and psychic
sanctuary for that unique group
of students who have made alter
native choices in their lifestyles
and who, each year, come togeth
er to be "the whole which is
greater than the sum of its
parts."
I ask that the University seri
ously consider the impact this
destruction will have on the cam
pus. Synergy is a truly unique
place in an environment of ever
increasing diversity. To end its
existence would be to extinguish
one of the last architectural and
cultural refuges left at Stanford.

Stanford should
rethink its priorities

Our government has a tenden
cy to invest in organizations in a
way that makes them dependent
on government. The vagaries of
government funding have driven
many a small contractor to the
wall and forced many an institu
tion to compromise its principles.
Stanford's mandate to teach
young people has been depreciat
ed by its readiness to dance to the
government's tune.
It seems opportune to allow Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
to resign just as he sets the course
toward more teaching and away
from government control. It seems
unwise for Stanford to resolve its
identity crisis by allowing one of the
family to volunteer as sacrificial
lamb so the process of integration
with the government can continue.
The tree is still standing, but
the wind of freedom isn't blow
ing around it.
