# An ounce of prevention
## Health Library helps stressed-out shoppers understand illness 
### Yvette Fernandez 
Nestled between Macy's and Empo
rium department stores is a
unique part of the Stanford Shop
ping Center — a place where you can't
buy a single thing.
"It's the best kept secret in the mall,"
says librarian Mary Beth Train of the
Health Library. "After a whole day of
going in and out of stores and spending a
whole lot of money, people can finally
find a place where they can get something
for nothing.
"Over here, they can get a lot of infor
mation on just about anything they need
to know about their health, and it's all for
free, too. They can just sit down, relax
and take a breath from all that stress from
shopping all day."
In fact, the Health Library, which cel
ebrated its second birthday yesterday, has
information on prevention, diagnosis and

treatment of any dis
ease you can think of.
Visitors can pour
through shelves of
books, articles, jour
nals, clipping files and
audio and video cas
settes.
Suppose you want to
discover why you
sneeze a dozen times
every morning. Look
ing through the books,
you learn that it might
be due to allergic rhini
tis, the swelling of the
nasal mucous mem
branes caused by of hy
persensitivity to foreign
substances.
Visitors can also ac
cess the Health Refer
ence Center, a comput
er system that indexes
more than 110 health
publications and
health-related articles
from about 3,000 maga
zines and newspapers.
It also stores back-

ground information, definitions of medi
cal terms, the full text of 80 publications
and indexed articles from more than 40
professional and technical journals.
Open since August 1989, the Health
Library is a non-profit community service
of the Stanford University Hospital. It is
also sponsored by the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation, Menlo Medical Clinic, Chil
dren's Hospital at Stanford, the Chil
dren's Health Council and the Stanford
Family Studies Center.
The Stanford Shopping Center gave
the library a free 5-year lease valued at
$225,000 for the 1,100 square-foot space.
Center director Rosemary McAndrews
said that although the shopping center
produces income for Stanford University,
it is also committed to public service.
With the help of 40 volunteers, the li
brary has already helped more than

24,000 people learn a little more about
their health, organizers say.
On a particular afternoon, one patron
yawned over volumes of books and files of
clippings of sleep disorders. A couple
came in with their four little sons in tow.
The information they wanted? About
birth control.
Relatively few students visit the health
library, Train said. Those that do are gen
erally interested in nutrition, exercise,
mood disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse,
relationships, sexuality, the struggle for
intimacy, family secrets, smoking and
sports medicine.
Train said she hoped more Stanford
students would "discover the library" in
the future.
Library directors Kristine Erving and
Linda Romley-Irvine said they didn't
want to leave anyone out when planning
the library. So they also created an area
for kids.
Alongside from little doctor bears and
colorful building blocks, there's also a
special set of literature for children, with
titles like, "From Head to Toe: No More
Secrets for Me," "A Visit to the Hospi
tal?" and "How Babies Are Made?" The
library encourages parents to go through
these informational books as well.
Many of the people who come to the li
brary, said Train, are people who have just
consulted or are about to consult a doctor.
"They don't understand what's going
on, they want to know what has hap
pened," she said. "They may be afraid, or
too embarrassed to see a doctor, or else,
they have been told by a doctor that their
father or mother has this or that disease.
"And they want to find more about
that sickness. A lot of them rest easier
when they get more information from the
library."

Jasmine Kuen, a volunteer, recalls one
such case.
"One afternoon, a gentleman in his 50s
came to the library," she said. "He want
ed to express his sincere thanks to the li
brary staff.
"Last year he came to the library to
find information about his cancer and
proposed surgery. 'I was in the dark be-

fore I came here,
the information I
found gave me the
confidence to deal
with my disease,'
he said. Although
I hadn't been the
one who helped
him, I was glad to
be part of the pro
ject that had."
The library also
has information to
help people shop
around for a doc
tor. They have a
set of Physicians'
Practice Profiles,
which gives the
specialties of most
of the doctors in
the area.
In fact, you might
even get to meet
some of those doc
tors at the library.
Many go there to
read the latest is
sues of their favorite
medical journals.
