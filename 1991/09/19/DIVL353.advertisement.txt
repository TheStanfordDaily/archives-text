THIS YEAR A LOT OF COLLEGE
SENIORS WILL BE GRADUATING
INTO DEBT.
Under the Army's
Loan Repayment
program, you could get
out from under with a
three-year enlistment.
Each year you serve
on active duty reduces
your indebtedness by one
third or $1,500, which
ever amount is greater.
The offer applies to Perkins Loans, Stafford Loans,
and certain other federally insured loans, which are not
in default.
And debt relief is just one of the many benefits
you'll earn from the Army. Ask your Army Recruiter.
