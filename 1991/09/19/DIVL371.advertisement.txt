BEFORE TRUSTING TOUR FUTURE
TO ANY COMPANY ASK FOR
SOME LETTERS OF REFERENCE.
You put more than just your savings
into a retirement company. You put
in vour trust and hopes for the future,
too. So before you choose one, ask some
questions. How stable is the company?
How solid are its investments? How sound
is its overall financial health?
A good place to start looking for answers
is in the ratings of independent analysts.
Three companies, all widely recognized
resources for finding out how strong a
financial services company really is, gave
TIAA their top grade.
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, TIAA
IS LETTER-PERFECT.
TIAA received A + from A.M. Best Co.,
AAA from Standard & Poor's and Aaa
from Moody s Investors Service. I hese
ratings reflect TIAA's reliable claims-paying
ability, exceptional financial strength,
superior investment performance, and low
expenses. With its guaranteed rate of retui n
and opportunity for dividends, l IAA is
one of less than ten companies, out of
2,200 nationwide, that received these
highest marks.
