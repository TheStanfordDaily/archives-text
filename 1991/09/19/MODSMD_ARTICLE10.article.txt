# Budget under control says new AD Leland
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As the University enters its
most recent — and perhaps most
drastic — round of budget cuts,
the Department of Athletics is
also undergoing an intense period
of budget scrutiny.
Athletic Director Ted Leland,
on the job for only a few months,
is learning about Stanford athlet
ics the hard way as he examines
the budget for areas to cut.
But the Athletic Department's
budget deficit is not as severe as
the deficit for the remainder of
the University, which is current
ly looking to slice a large portion
from its operating budget.
To put things in perspective,
Leland emphasized that the cur
rent budget deficit of $2.1-million
has accumulated over a period of
years. But compared to the
Athletics department's $25-mil
lion annual budget and $60-mil
lion endowment, it is "certainly
not a crisis," Leland said.
"We are not ready to run up
the bankruptcy flag and sell off
all of our paperclips to make ends
meet," he added.
Due mostly in part to an lucra
tive home football schedule
including Colorado, Notre Dame
and Big Game, the Athletic De
partment is expecting a $1-mil
lion surplus this year that will
retire a large portion of the accu
mulated debt.
"In the best of all worlds, we
could wait and rely on our foot
ball schedule for several years
and end up with a surplus. But
we must also look to cut our
expenses," Leland said.
Although he cannot offer any
guarantees, Leland said it is
unlikely any sports would be
dropped from Stanford.
"It would be our last choice to
cut sports," Leland said. "The
ones you generally cut rarely save
much money."

Leland said he hopes to have a
final budget proposal by
December but is not yet far
enough into the process to specu
late on vulnerable areas.
But cuts in the Athletic
Department will not be limited to
resolving the $2.1-million deficit.
Activities supported by the
University will also be forced to
undergo scrutiny.
Funds from the University are
used for a variety of non-varsity
athletic activities, including
intramural athletics, recreational
sports, activity centers and club
sports, Leland said.
The Athletic Department,
along with all other areas of the
University, submitted a budget
proposal to the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning for an informational
retreat meeting held last week.
All non-academic units,
including the Athletic De
partment, were told to develop a
contingency plan for cutting 15
to 21-percent from their opera
tional budgets.
A final target for budget reduc
tions will not be set until mid-
October, and at that time the
Athletic Department will prepare
its final plan to reduce spending.
That process is likely to be con
ducted through committees with
in the Athletic department and
include student and faculty input.
The University has not re
leased the speculative budget
cutting proposals submitted by
departments and Leland declined
to discuss any specifics of the
Athletic Department's ideas for
budget cuts.
Leland said that while budget
cuts are not the most pleasant
way to enter a new position, he
still believes it is a "great job that
presents fantastic opportunities."
"Stanford has some budgetary
problems, but everybody has
them," Leland said. "It is part of
athletics."
