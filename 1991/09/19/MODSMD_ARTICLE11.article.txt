### George Malone Staff writer 
As the Stanfo.'d women's volleyball
team prepares fcr its home and Pacific
10 Conference opening games at
Burnham Pavilion this weekend against
Arizona and Arizona State, the players
and coaches are debating whether being
the No. l-ranke4 team in the nation is a
blessing or a curie.
Stanford from No. 2 to No. 1
last week as a rtßult of UCLA's road loss
to Hawaii. After securing their spot at

the top of the pack by trouncing No. 8
Texas on Sept. 10, the Cardinal knows
that everyone else will be scrambling to
oust them from position.
Stanford faces their first challenge
tomorrow night, Sept. 20, against the
Arizona Wildcats, followed by the
Arizona State Sun Devils on Saturday
night, Sept. 21. Both matches are at 7:30
p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
In preparing for the first home games
of 1991, Coach Don Shaw is not taking
either team lightly.
"The Arizona schools really have

given us problems in the past," Shaw
said.
The Stanford players are aware that
any team in the Pac-10 can pull off an
upset. No one is becoming complacent
about the young Arizona squad, even
though the Wildcats have lost several
key seniors from last year. And, Arizona
State, ranked third in the Pac-10, has
some experience coming back on their
front line, so neither match should be a
walkover.
"You can't look ahead too far — teams
will surprise you," said senior Nicole

Appleman.
In addition, the incentive to upset
the No. 1-ranked team in the country
will give both opponents extra motiva
tion to play hard. With all this extra
pressure, does anyone at Stanford like
being No. 1?
"All [being No. 1] means is that we
won't ever be an underdog," Shaw said,
"But it is something to be proud of when
you consider who'd like to be there.
There are probably five or six teams who
could be No. 1 in the country, including
UCLA and Pacific, and it's flattering

that the coaches honored us.
"Some players see the ranking as an
incentive for them to step up their play."
Junior setter Carrie Feldman thinks
the ranking will help. "The fact that
everyone is after us makes me more
intense," she said.
After 10 days off since beating Texas,
the Stanford players will certainly not be
lacking in enthusiasm tomorrow night
against Arizona.
"It's a big break between games, so we
should be pumped up," said junior
Laurie Sawin confidently.
