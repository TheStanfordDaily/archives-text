# Water polo inconsistent in early season play
## 
### Laurie Wackier 
As the summer dwindled to a few short weeks,
and the prospect of school loomed around the cor
ner, many of us fantasized about suntans and swim
ming pools. Perhaps a lucky few even got to bag
those last days of work and indulge in such luxu
ries. But for the general population, spending the
summer at the pool is something you did back in the
days when mowing the lawn once a week qualified
as a summer job.
However, one group of Stanford athletes did just
that, meeting at deGuerre Pool throughout the
summer. Except their activities differed a bit from
the relaxing scenario we envision: they were actual
ly in the pool. And these dedicated water polo play
ers weren't exactly relaxing.
The Cardinal, a perennial powerhouse of colle
giate water polo, started the season strong, claiming
victories in their first three contests. However, in
their next three games, Stanford lacked the offen
sive punch, as the team skidded to a three game los
ing streak.
In last Friday's season opener at UC Santa
Barbara, Stanford claimed its first victim, in a 12-3
rout over the Gauchos. Stanford's defense dominat
ed in the contest, as sophomore goalkeeper Larry
Bercutt recorded nine saves. Offensively, the

Cardinal overwhelmed Santa Barbara with goals
from nine players. The balancql attack was led by
sophomore Brian Clemens, &nd juniors John
Matarangas and Chip Blankinhorn, who each
scored twice.
The Cardinal carried this momentum into their
first two games of a weekend tournament at UC
Irvine. A convincing 14-3 victory over UC San Diego
foreshadowed a 10-4 blowout against UC Santa
Barbara. Stanford appeared to he on a roll when
they ran into defending NCAA chanpion California.
The Golden Bears virtually shut cnwn the Cardinal
offense, allowing only four goads, and handing
Stanford their first loss. In their next two games,
the team continued to falter dropping games to
UCLA, 7-4, and Cal State Long Beach, 7-5.
Last weekend's inconsistenciej and seemingly
mediocre 3-3 record may be inaccurate indicators
for the season to come. Although the Cardinal grad
uated four Ail-Americans last year, the abundance
of young talent should place them among the elite
contenders in the NCAA.
The early games showcased the Cardinal defense,
which is stronger and more experienced than last
year's squad. Stanford allowed only 32 goals in six
games. Leading the defensive effort is Bercutt,

A tenacious defender, junior J.T. Matarangas is also a major cog in Stanford's lightning-quick offense.
After graduating four All-Americans from last year's NCAA runner-up team, Matarangas will be looked
to for leadership as well as goals.
