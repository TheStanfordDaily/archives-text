# Cross country team ready for long haul

Talent but not depth; speed
but not endurance. Those have
been traits of the Stanford
men's and women's cross coun
try squads over the past few
years.
But this season the pieces are
coming together. Both teams
may challenge for the top spots
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"The big change (in the
men's squad) has been from a
miler team to a distance-orient
ed team. In the past the majori
ty of the top five have been mil
ers or 1,500-meter runners who
could stretch to run cross coun
try. We have more pure distance
runners now," said Scott
Chisam, Stanford men's cross
country coach.
At Saturday's Fresno State
Invitational the squad proved
they could stay with the leaders
over a five-mile course. Senior
Dave Scudamore placed fourth
in 25:15.8. Senior Fred Carter
finished sixth, less than three
seconds behind Scudamore.
Because of a hamstring
cramp red-shirt sophomore
Gary Stolz had to miss the race.
The Cardinal placed fifth overall
with Mike Reilly, Brian
McCaffery and Todd Lewis also
scoring. UC Irvine won the
Invitational with five runners
placing in the top fourteen fin
ishers.
Carter, Scudamore and Stolz
are expected to be the top three
harriers on the men's team. All
have run well in important

meets.
Carter won the Ohio State
Invitational last fall while Stolz
and Scudamore finished third
and fourth respectively. All
three helped the Cardinal to a
fourth-place finish in the Pac-10
Championships last year. Stolz
also placed 16th at the NCAA
District-8 Championships.
"Dave and Gary are out
standing 10,000-meter runners.
That gives us better strength (in
cross country). Many of the
teams we compete against do
well in cross country but not in
track," Chisam said.
Unlike track scoring, the
cross country contingent with
the lowest tally wins. The top
five finishers of the seven run
ners on the team get points
equal to their placements in the
overall standings.
Stanford has a talented group
of young athletes to compete for
scoring positions and push the
top three. The harriers who will
probably see varsity action
include juniors Brett Allsop,
Todd Lewis and Greg Shryock,
sophomore Brian McCaffery and
freshman Eric Spayde.
"Freshmen usually have a
difficult time adjusting to run
ning at the Division I level. One
out of about every three years
I'll run a freshman on varsity
and Spayde may be it," Chisam
said.
The Cardinal will face stiff
competition from Pac-10 foes
Oregon, Washington, Arizona
and Washington State.
