# And what did YOU do during the summer?
## Keefe starts for U.S. basketball team in Cuba

Unlike the Pan Pacific Championships,
which only allow competition between the top
swimmers from the United States and the
Pacific Rim nations, the Pan American Games
include a wide array of events and competitors
from North, Central and South America.
Cardinal athletes (naturally) made a
strong showing in everything from basketball
and baseball to windsurfing and fencing.
Stanford's red-headed giant, Adam Keefe,
earned a starting spot on the United States
basketball team. The All-American candidate
joined other big names like Duke's Christian
Laettner and Eric Montross of North
Carolina to win a bronze for the U.S.
Keefe had a slam dunk on a fast break in
the Venezuela game which brought the
Cuban crowd to its feet. After that, the
Americans went on to rout the Bahamas, 116-
58, in which Keefe contributed 14 points.
Keefe passed up the NBA draft in June
and will be back on The Farm this fall for his
fourth season under Coach Mike Mont
gomery.

In other ballgames, Stanford also showed
talent. Junior Jeffrey Hammonds helped the
U.S. baseball team trample the Dominican
Republic, Aruba, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
They came home from Cuba with a bronze.
Hammonds, the lead-off man and center
fielder for the national team, had two hits and
scored twice against Mexico.
On the track, senior Chryste Gaines
placed second in the 100 meters. Gaines had
a sizable lead when officials decided there
had been a false start. Had the runners not
been called back, Gaines probably would have
won.
In the Havana heat, swimmer Alex Kostich
blazed his way to two gold medals in the 400
meter Individual Medley and the 1500
freestyle. He successfully defended his 1987
title in the 1500 by finishing with a time of
15:21.36.
Two top recruits also captured gold
medals. Clay Tippins, who should bring in big
points for the Cardinal this year, swam the
third leg for the victorious 800 free relay
team. Eric Diehl, a high school senior who has
signed to attend Stanford next year, won the
200 free.

Eight medals were awarded to current or
former members of the women's swimming
team. Sophomore Eileen Richetelli, a surprise
qualifier, stole the gold in platform diving.
Senior Dede Trimble left Cuba with a gold
medal in the 200 back while classmate J.T.
Toton packed up a bronze for her 200 IM per
formance.
Recent graduates Suzy Buckovich and
Barb Metz collected two golds, two silvers and
a bronze in fly and free events.
In other sports, Ted Huang sailed away
with the gold medal in windsurfing.
Fencer Nick Bravin clinched third in indi
vidual foil. His lone victory in the team title
match against Cuba boosted the U.S. to a sec
ond-place finish. Bravin also outscored the
competition at the U.S. Nationals in Chicago
earlier in the summer.
Senior Rhett Harty and junior Randy
Mann contributed to the soccer team's wins
over Surinam, Canada and Honduras.
Volleyball powerhouses Kristin Klein, Amy
Cooper and Bev Oden set and spiked for the
women's team while recent graduate Dan
Hanan gave a boost to the men's volleyball
effort.

Sophomore sensation Christy Hedgpeth played point guard for the
West team at the U.S. Olympic Festival. She led the team to a
bronze medal. Hedgpeth will see a lot of action this winter as the
Card tries to make its third straight trip to the Final Four.
