## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial staff 
From Canada to Cuba,
Stanford athletes led the pack in
international competition this
summer.
At the Pan Pacific
Championships in Edmonton,
Alberta, senior Jeff Rouse busted
through the 54-second barrier to
set a new world record in the 100-
meter backstroke, shattering
Dave Berkoff's time set at the
Seoul Olympics in 1988.
Swimming the first leg of the
400 medley relay, his time of
53.93 helped teammates Mark
Henderson, Mike Barrowman and
Matt Biondi capture a victory.
After breaking his wrist in March,
Route's race proved he has made
a full recovery.
This tremendous effort came
after Rouse had already struck
gold twice in individual events.
He found victory in the 100 back
and 200 back in 54.67 and 2:00.85
seconds, respectively.
Victory came in threes for
Stanford sophomore sensation
Summer Sanders as well. She
brought home gold in the 200
butterfly, 400 individual medley
and 200 IM.

Also collecting hardware in
Canada was freshman Jenny
Johnson, with a gold medal in the
50 free.
Sophomore Lea Loveless and
graduate Jill Johnson had fourth
place finishes in the 100 back and
200 breast, respectively. Loveless,
who was ineligible for competition
last year after transferring from
Florida, should be a big asset for
the Cardinal this year.
While Rouse was breaking a
world record in Canada, sopho
mores Derek Weatherford and
Trip Zedlitz were making waves
in Fort Lauderdale at the United
States Swimming Nationals.
Weatherford won the 400 IM
and the 100 back while Zedlitz
ran away with the 100 fly and 200
IM. Stanford sophomores swept
the 100 back; behind Weatherford
was Zedlitz and teammate Brian
Retterer.
The new freshmen also showed
their stuff in Florida. Julie Kole
hit the jackpot with gold medals
in the 200 fly and the 400 free.
Mary Ellen Blanchard also out
touched the competition with a
top-notch performance in the 200
IM. Dan Kanner was a finalist in
the 400 free while Ray Carey fin
ished sixth in the 100 fly.
