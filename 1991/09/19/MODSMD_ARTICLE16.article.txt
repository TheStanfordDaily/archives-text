# Hedgpeth points team to bronze at Olympic Fest
## 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES - The 1991
United States Olympic Festival
features outstanding athletic per
formances, many of which were
given by athletes from Stanford.
The festival, which took place
from July 12-21, is designed as a
showcase for top amateur talent
in the United States.
Stanford had three players in
the women's basketball competi
tion, which took place at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
Guards Christy Hedgpeth, a
sophomore, and freshman
Tanya Rucker played for the
West squad, and center Anita
Kaplan, also a freshman, played
for the East team.
Athletes were broken up into
four teams representing the
North, South, East and West
regions of the country based upon
the team that they most recently
played for.
Of the three players, Hedgpeth
had the best tournament. In four
games, she averaged 6.3 points
per game, 2.3 rebounds, 2 assists
(fifth best in the Festival) and 2.3
steals per game (tied for second
best in the Festival).
West team coach Jacqueline
Hullah of Dartmouth gave
Hedgpeth the role of team leader,
and Hedgpeth adapted easily.
Accustomed to playing the off
guard in college, she was often
playing the point guard spot.
When asked if she knew that
she would play this new position,
Hedgpeth responded, "Actually,
it was a big surprise for me
because I didn't know that I was
going to be playing it. I think
they just wanted someone to han
dle the ball and not to make too
many mistakes. I thought I did
pretty well and I wouldn't mind
playing some next year if I work
on my point guard skills in the
summer."
What was impressive about

Hedgpeth was the way her college
experience showed as the floor
leader, calling out support to her
teammates.
"I think sometimes I'm a natu
ral leader," she said. "But I also
have played the foliower-type role
at Stanford, which I'm pretty
comfortable with. Whatever my
coaches need me to do is fine with
me. I think the reason that
maybe I play that role on this
team is that I have more college
experience than anyone, going to
the Final Four last year."
For Rucker, the Festival pro
vided a transition from the high
school to the college game. One of
Coach Tara VanDerveer's prize
recruits and a leading candidate
to fill Sonja Henning's slot at the
point, Rucker found the game
rougher than what she had been
used to. "The competition is way
different from high school," she
said. "I find myself playing a little
harder, more aggressive. It's
[more] physical."
Yet Rucker had an added
bonus in having future teammate
Hedgpeth on her side. She liked
being on the same team because
"it's a way of getting to know
each other on the court as well as
off the court. I think it's an
advantage to us [when we] play
next year because we will have
already played together in this
Festival."
Kaplan also felt that the
Festival was a preview of things
to come. "I thought it was a great
experience. There's a lot of great
players, and it's really going to
help me for when I get to college.
There were a lot better players
here than I'm used to playing
with on the high school level. [It
was] an eye opener."
The East team finished with a
2-2 record; the West 1-3. The two
teams met twice, with the East
winning 70-54 on July 14, but the
West gained revenge in the
rematch on July 16. The West
team's nine point lead, 69-60 was

enough to capture the bronze
medal.
Even though it wasn't a gold,
Hedgpeth liked her medal.
"They're cool," she said. "We'll
just say it's a little tarnished."
In men's volleyball, Stanford's
powerhouse hitter Dave Goss
dominated. In guiding the North
squad to the bronze medal, the
senior finished with a tourna

ment-leading 106 kills.
His classmate, Greg Morris,
played as a fielder for the North
team in the men's waterpolo com
petition. This was Morris' second
consecutive U.S. Olympic
Festival.
Freshman Scott Pisciotta, a
right-handed pitcher from
Marietta, Ga., played hardball for
the South team.

point, Rucker found the game
rougher than what she had been
used to. "The competition is way
different from high school," she
said. "I find myself playing a little
harder, more aggressive. It's
[more] physical."
Yet Rucker had an added
bonus in having future teammate
Hedgpeth on her side. She liked
being on the same team because
"it's a way of getting to know
each other on the court as well as
off the court. I think it's an
advantage to us [when we] play
next year because we will have
already played together in this
Festival."
Kaplan also felt that the
Festival was a preview of things
to come. "I thought it was a great
experience. There's a lot of great
players, and it's really going to
help me for when I get to college.
There were a lot better players
here than I'm used to playing
with on the high school level. [It
was] an eye opener."
The East team finished with a
2-2 record; the West 1-3. The two
teams met twice, with the East
winning 70-54 on July 14, but the
West gained revenge in the
rematch on July 16. The West
team's nine point lead, 69-60 was

enough to capture the bronze
medal.
Even though it wasn't a gold,
Hedgpeth liked her medal.
"They're cool," she said. "We'll
just say it's a little tarnished."
In men's volleyball, Stanford's
powerhouse hitter Dave Goss
dominated. In guiding the North
squad to the bronze medal, the
senior finished with a tourna

ment-leading 106 kills.
His classmate, Greg Morris,
played as a fielder for the North
team in the men's waterpolo com
petition. This was Morris' second
consecutive U.S. Olympic
Festival.
Freshman Scott Pisciotta, a
right-handed pitcher from
Marietta, Ga., played hardball for
the South team.

Sophomore sensation Christy Hedgpeth played point guard for the
West team at the U.S. Olympic Festival. She led the team to a
bronze medal. Hedgpeth will see a lot of action this winter as the
Card tries to make its third straight trip to the Final Four.
