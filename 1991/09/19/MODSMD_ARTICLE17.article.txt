# Card rower competes in World Championships

The World Rowing Championships
made a splash over the summer in
Vienna, Austria, and Stanford graduate
Diana Olson helped set the pace for the
U.S., rowing the stroke of the eight
boat.
Olson completed her Stanford educa
tion in 1990, finishing with a degree in
biology and a particular interest in
marine biology.
After rowing Varsity Crew close to
several championships over her four

years, Olson spent the year after gradu
ation training in Boston and Seattle
with the U.S. Women's National Team.
All the preparation came to fruition for
Olson this summer at the World Rowing
Championships.
Perched on the New Danube in
Vienna, the rowing regatta boasted a
true media spectacle — even for a typi
cally non-spectator sport. With televi
sion crews following the boats from
start to finish and the races announced
alternately in French, German, and
English, the rowers had the interna

tional ink running and the cameras
rolling.
On the day of the final race, the spec
tacle got a little added exposure when a
nudist colony saw fit to display them
selves in the water. In all her experience
with water sports and marine biology,
Olson still probably wasn't prepared for
a bunch of fat, naked men splashing and
sunning themselves; few were.
The focus quickly shifted away
from the whales and back to the
boats, as the races got underway.
Rowing 2,000 meter courses, teams of

two, four and eight participated in the
racing regatta.
The coaches participated in the race
in their own way, biking on a path along
the water and creating safety hazards
because they were watching the rowers
instead of the path.
In the eight's race, a final field of six
boats pushed themselves to the
extreme, with the Canadians taking
first in a time of six minutes, 41 sec
onds. Olson's American squad, resplen
dent in their red, white and blue boat,
came in forth — just half a second

behind the Romanians.
Despite the disappointment at miss
ing a medal by a split second,
Olson and her teammates now set their
sights on the Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain. As a resident of Anchorage,
Alaska, Olson represents a rarity in the
rowing world; should she make it to the
Olympics, she would almost certainly be
the first female rower from Anchorage
to compete in the Games.
Bailing any further outbursts from
the European nudist community, there
should be few surprises in her path.
