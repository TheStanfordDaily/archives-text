### George Malone Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team knows how to come out
punching.
In the fight for the NCAA
Championship, the Cardinal is
off to a strong start, racing to a
5-0 record with road victories
over Colorado State, Houston,
Colorado, Northwestern and No.
8 Texas.
Starting the season at No. 2 in
all preseason polls, Stanford
crushed the Colorado State Rams
in three games on Sept. 4.
Ignited by 1990 NCAA Player of
the Year junior Bev Oden's
fourth career triple-double (13
kills, 12 digs, 10 blocks) and
senior Amy Cooper's phenome
nal .667 hitting percentage, the
Cardinal burned through a fal
tering Ram defense. The Rams,
led by Carrie Appleman, younger
sister of Stanford's Nicole
Appleman, collapsed under the
sharp shots of the Cardinal.
Next for Stanford came the
Colorado Invitational at the
University of Colorado on Sept. 6
and 7. The Cardinal did not drop
a game during the entire tourna
ment and Coach Don Shaw was
able to insert a variety of players
throughout the weekend as
Stanford rolled over Houston,
Colorado, and Northwestern.
Oden was named the tour
ney's MVP and senior captain

Kristin Klein and Cooper were
also selected to the all-tourna
ment team. Colorado had been
ranked No. 25 and Houston No.
28 in the preseason AVCA/
Tachikara Coaches' poll. Shaw
was pleased with his team's per
formance.
"For most of the Colorado
tournament I was pleasantly sur
prised with our blocking. ... We
got a good look at a lot of peo
ple," Shaw said.
On Sept. 10 Stanford faced its
first test against a strong team
when they traveled to Austin,
Texas to face the Lady Long
horns. Earlier in the day, Stan
ford had moved up to No. 1 in
the polls after UCLA's loss to
Hawaii on Sept. 8 — the first
time the Cardinal had been
ranked No. 1 since Sept. 9,
1986. Meanwhile, No. 8-ranked
Texas was coming off an impres
sive 31-4 season last year and
was 3-1.
"I didn't know how we would
play against a tough team," said
athletic junior Nicole Appleman.
Stanford won the first game,
15-11, but lost the second 15-8.
Game three provided the first
critical test of how the Cardinal
would react under pressure.
Down 5-1, Shaw inserted sopho
more setter Piper Hahn to
change the tempo, and the team
responded, fighting back to knot
the score at 12-12.
With the score tied, the teams

traded sideouts several times.
"Whoever won the next point
would have the momentum to
win the game 15-12 and go on to
win the match," said junior
Laurie Sawin.
Stanford got the next point,
went on to win 15-12, and
cruised easily through game
four, 15-4, for an impressive vic
tory against a strong Texas team
at Austin.
Shaw was happy to get the
win, but he saw things to work
on. "We didn't play exceptionally
well at Texas, at least at first. We
kept our focus and they didn't.
We've improved from last year in
a lot of areas, but we're not
where we need to be yet," Shaw
said.
Klein registered 20 kills for
the match, moving her to within
one kill of second place on the
Stanford career kill list. Teresa
Smith (1984-87) is second with
1465 and Kim Oden (1982-85) is
first with 1751.
Other highlights for the
Cardinal included the play of
athletic junior Jennifer Jackson,
who recorded a career high 15
kills against the Lady
Longhorns, five more than her
previous high, and Cooper's con
tinued vicious hitting — .400 for
the season so far.
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
team opens Pac-10 play at home
in Burnham Pavilion at 7:30
p.m. on Sept. 20 against Arizona.
