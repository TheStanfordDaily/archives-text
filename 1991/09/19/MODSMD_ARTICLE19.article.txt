# Washington, turnovers beat Cardinal, 42-7
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
On paper Stanford has a better football
team than it had a year ago. The problem
Sept. 7 was that Washington proved on the
field that they had not gotten any worse.
Last year's Rose Bowl champions began
their quest for consecutive invitations to
Pasadena in convincing fashion, beating the
Cardinal 42-7 in front of 45,273 people who
probably expected a better game.
Though the Huskies came into the game

ranked No. 4 in the country, Stanford had
enough confidence from their strong finish
last year (three straight wins to finish at 5-6)
to prompt offensive tackle Bob Whitfield to
say the Cardinal would prevail by 60 points.
In fairness, Whitfield was probably just kid
ding around as the University of Washington
football team is no joke.
"They're not as good as they were last
year," Heisman Trophy hopeful Glyn Milburn
said, "they're better."
This year Milburn managed 128 yards on
the ground, but only got 16 of those yards
coming out of the backfield. Milburn had
some electric punt and kick-off returns, yet
was stifled consistently enough by the
Washington defensive line to keep Stanford
coach Denny Green's wide open offensive
attack from ever unfolding. The result for
Stanford was 238 total yards, six turnovers,
and a big embarrassment on opening day.
"We played like it was the first game of the
year, and Washington didn't," Green said.

"We were clearly outmatched."
Yet as rough as the Huskies got, Stanford
definitely suffered a case of self-flagellation.
The six turnovers included three fumbles and
three interceptions (at least they were consis
tent), with one of the misplaced passes effec
tively ending the game just as it started to get
good.
Down 14-0 near the end of the second
quarter, Stanford orchestrated a nice 41-yard
drive that climaxed with what has become a
Stanford trademark over the last two years
— "Touchdown" Tommy Vardell plunging in
the end zone from the one. Stanford then
held Washington on downs and got the ball
back.
With the momentum finally shifting
towards the El Camino side of Stanford
Stadium, the Cardinal decided not to run the
clock out, instead making a strong run at a tie
ball game. The run ended with a pass, howev-

Paul Stonehouse barely gets a punt off in the face of the oncoming Husky rush. He was one of the few Cardinal who exited the game
unscathed. Eight of 11 defensive starters were knocked out of the contest
er, as Cardinal quarterback Jason
Palumbis battled a headwind and
lost.
Throwing from his own 18,
Palumbis ignored tight end Ryan
Wetnight open over the middle
and instead tried to find Jon
Pinkney streaking down the left
sideline. The fans hopes soared
with the spiral, but ended in a
collective groan as the under

thrown ball landed in the hands
of Huskie cornerback Walter
Bailey at the 50.
"We thought we had a safe
play on," Stanford offensive coor
dinator Ron Turner said. "The
corner had been jumping the
(down-and-out patterns) all day,
and we thought Jon could get
behind him, but that time
[Bailey] turned and ran."
With 1:19 left in the quarter,
Washington had time for one
more series, and they ended their
drive with a throwing mistake as
well, but this one resulted in a

touchdown. On first-and-10 from
the 26 with 16 seconds left,
Huskie quarterback Billy Joe
Hobert saw his primary receiver
Mario Bailey covered and tried to
throw the ball away over the left
side of the end zone. As Stanford
luck would have it, according to
Hobert the ball "slipped" and
was caught by a prevailing wind
that lofted it over defender
Vaughn Bryant's mistimed jump.
As Stanford fans looked on with
incredulity, the ball was cradled
in by the surprised Huskie
receiver.

"The defender said 'You were
lucky.' Bailey said. "I told him
'Yeah, you're right.'
Vaughn, a wide receiver con
verted to the defense last spring,
could only lament.
"I just misjudged the ball. The
wind took it right over my head,"
Bryant said. "I didn't even expect
[Hobert] to throw it, because I
had [Bailey) covered."
Stanford found itself suddenly
down 21-7 when a minute before
only a touchdown separated
them from their opponents. It
was a crushing blow from which

the Cardinal never recovered and
the Huskies never forgot.
"That was a real key score for
us," Washington coach Don
James said. "With Stanford
you've got to get ahead by more
than seven points."
Things went from bad to worse
for the Cardinal as they endured
a sloppy, scoreless third quarter,
blowing scoring opportunities
with fumbles and seeing
Palumbis go down with a twisted
knee in the fourth quarter as the
Huskies blew the game open.
Hobert started the rout with a

20-yard pass to Joe Kralik to
make it 28-7, and Palumbis was
injured — straining a muscle on
the side of his left knee — on the
very next possession after being
hit by Washington defender
Paxton Tailele. Steve Stenstroin
came in to take over the offense,
but Stanford's only scoring
threat in the last quarter ended
when Milburn fumbled at the
Huskie 31.
Washington got its last two
touchdowns on the ground, with
Joe Barry's 23-yard run and Leif
Johnson's 12-vard run.
