On paper Stanford has a better football
team than it had a year ago. The problem
Sept. 7 was that Washington proved on the
field that they had not gotten any worse.
Last year's Rose Bowl champions began
their quest for consecutive invitations to
Pasadena in convincing fashion, beating the
Cardinal 42-7 in front of 45,273 people who
probably expected a better game.
Though the Huskies came into the game

ranked No. 4 in the country, Stanford had
enough confidence from their strong finish
last year (three straight wins to finish at 5-6)
to prompt offensive tackle Bob Whitfield to
say the Cardinal would prevail by 60 points.
In fairness, Whitfield was probably just kid
ding around as the University of Washington
football team is no joke.
"They're not as good as they were last
year," Heisman Trophy hopeful Glyn Milburn
said, "they're better."
This year Milburn managed 128 yards on
the ground, but only got 16 of those yards
coming out of the backfield. Milburn had
some electric punt and kick-off returns, yet
was stifled consistently enough by the
Washington defensive line to keep Stanford
coach Denny Green's wide open offensive
attack from ever unfolding. The result for
Stanford was 238 total yards, six turnovers,
and a big embarrassment on opening day.
"We played like it was the first game of the
year, and Washington didn't," Green said.

"We were clearly outmatched."
Yet as rough as the Huskies got, Stanford
definitely suffered a case of self-flagellation.
The six turnovers included three fumbles and
three interceptions (at least they were consis
tent), with one of the misplaced passes effec
tively ending the game just as it started to get
good.
Down 14-0 near the end of the second
quarter, Stanford orchestrated a nice 41-yard
drive that climaxed with what has become a
Stanford trademark over the last two years
— "Touchdown" Tommy Vardell plunging in
the end zone from the one. Stanford then
held Washington on downs and got the ball
back.
With the momentum finally shifting
towards the El Camino side of Stanford
Stadium, the Cardinal decided not to run the
clock out, instead making a strong run at a tie
ball game. The run ended with a pass, howev-

unscathed. Eight of 11 defensive starters were knocked out of the contest
