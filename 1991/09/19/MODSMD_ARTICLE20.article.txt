# Rafanelli tallies trio in victory

### Kevin Jeffery Editorial staff 
It was one of the finest moments in
Stanford women's soccer history.
A hat trick from leading scorer Sarah
Rafanelli, brilliant ball control from Ail-
American Julie Foudy and a dominating
defensive performance anchored by one of
the nation's best sweepers, Heather
Mclntyre, highlighted the Cardinal's 3-1
upset of nationally-ranked UC Santa
Barbara Sunday at Maloney Field.
The fact that the Gauchos handed
Stanford (now 2-0-0) two of its three losses
last season, including one that knocked
them out of the NCAA tournament, made
the victory that much sweeter.
"This is definitely a big win for us
because we proved to ourselves that we
could play well in an important game. Last
year we didn't play well (against UCSB) and
they beat us twice. Now we've got confi
dence, we need to concentrate on playing
well consistently," said a jubilant Rafanelli.
The 5-3 sophomore forward put on an
incredible offensive show, scoring all three
Cardinal goals, recording the third hat trick
of her young career. She opened the scoring
midway through the first half, and scored her
second goal on a perfect sliding center pass
from Denise Denney just five minutes into
the second half to give Stanford a 2-0 lead.

But the third goal, which increased the
lead to 3-0 with 28 minutes to play and basi
cally iced the game, provided a true taste of
Rafanelli's athleticism. Taking a high
bouncing pass just past midfield, Rafanelli
raced down the left sideline around two
would-be Gaucho defenders, turned to the
middle, and fired a screaming cross-cage
shot for the clinching breakaway score.
While Rafanelli was putting the ball
away, Ail-American Foudy was controlling
the game at midfield. Foudy herself would
have scored an easy breakaway goal late in
the first half, if not for a flagrant Gaucho
shirt-grabbing tackle from behind that
made a Lawrence Taylor sack look tame.
Throughout the match, especially when
Stanford made their run in the early second
half, Foudy dominated the middle. Her
steals and flawless decision-making on
touch passes ignited the Cardinal offense
and helped keep the ball on Stanford's
offensive end.
If not for a defensive mental lapse in the
game's waning moments, sophomore goalie
Leslie Garrard would have recorded the
Cardinal's second shutout in two games.
Instead Julie Bushman scored Santa
Barbara's lone goal with 2:25 to play.
The Cardinal defense thwarted the
Gauchos the entire afternoon. Even during
the final 30 minutes of the second half,
when the UCSB offense maintained control

of the ball, Mclntyre and a trio of Stanford
fullbacks (Melinda Minstrell, Kristen Wair,
and Kerry Stivaletti) kept the pressure off
Garrard, holding Santa Barbara to only a
handful of shots on goal.
"In my opinion, and she played like it
today, Heather Mclntyre is the best
women's sweeper in the college game
today," said fifth-year Cardinal coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
"If the national team played under any
other system, she would be the national
team's sweeper. Heather just gives everyone
such confidence out there. All of our full
backs can play without worry, because they
know Heather does such a great job backing
them up. It's hard for me to fathom the
intangible benefits of having a player of her
caliber as our sweeper," Andeberhan said.
Entering the match Stanford was ranked
No. 12, but the Cardinal's commanding vic
tory over perennial power UCSB will cer
tainly enhance that standing.
"We've been building this program grad
ually over the last two years, trying to reach
that echelon of elite teams. With this win, I
think we showed that we belong there. Now
we have to start believing that we are an
elite team, and continue to play at that
level," Andeberhan said.
After their performance Sunday, the
Cardinal have more than a few believers
already.
