# Graham turns pro, hits top 50 Palmer and Stark also leave Stanford for pro tour
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
As Stanford was preparing to wel
come a new freshman class several
undergraduates said an early goodbye
to join the professional tennis tour.
Senior Debbie Graham, who returns
this fall to complete work towards a
bachelor's degree, turned pro this sum
mer along with two would-be-juniors:
Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark.
Graham had already found success
on the tour before renouncing her ama
teur status. She reached the quarterfi
nals of the Westchester Ladies Cup,
Lori McNeil stopped Graham's run with
a 7-5, 6-1 victory.
At the Mazda Classic Graham
demolished Erika deLone 6-0, 6-1 and
seventh-seeded Barbara Paulus 6-3, 6-4.
She eventually fell to the world's No. 7-
ranked player, Conchita Martinez 6-0,
7-5.
Then she made the decision. "I go
out and get to use everything I have,"
Graham said in an interview with the
Stanford Weekly. "I'm on an upswing
right now. I didn't want to go back and
regress," Graham said.
Although the decision was a difficult
one it doesn't appear to be one she will
regret. In her first tournament as a pro,
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles,
Graham lost to the 1990 U.S. Open
champion Gabriela Sabatini in the third
round 6-3, 6-1.
"I hit the ball harder than her,"
Graham said. "I serve so much harder
than her. She's not that good."
Graham had a similar experience at
the U.S. Open where she met Martina
Navratilova on Stadium Court.
If there was ever a sign that Graham
had hit the big time, this was it.
Navratilova, the nine-time Wimbledon
champion, had been making Centre

Court her backyard when Graham was
learning her multiplication tables.
Although the two had met before it
was never on such a grand stage. At a
tournament in Los Angeles last year the
Czech-born southpaw pummeled the
newly crowned NCAA singles champ.
The moment was not lost on
Graham. She was visibly nervous
through the early stages of the Stadium
Court match and dropped the first set
6-1 after winning her first service game.
Graham played inconsistently
throughout the set. She hit some win
ners but reached double digits in
unforced errors. Graham overhit sever
al passing shots and appeared to be try
ing to break the sound barrier on
almost every shot.
She settled down in the second set
and regained her touch with several
perfectly placed topspin lobs lofted over
the net-crowding Navratilova.
Graham's serve gave Navratilova
some trouble. Her first serve was
clocked at 105 miles per hour, the
fastest serve by a woman recorded on
Stadium Court during the first week of
the Open.
But Navratilova was too much. She
used her bread-and-butter- lefty-serve
wide-to-the-righthander's-two-handed-
backhand to set up her backhand volley
into the open court. Navratilova won
the second set 6-4.
With her results in the tournaments
leading up to the Open, Graham's rank
ing skyrocketed from the mid-nineties
to 49th in the world.
Also joining Graham in the pro ranks
were two of the most talented players on
the Stanford men's team, Jared Palmer
and Jonathan Stark. Palmer's decision
came as a surprise to some people.
In a story by Steve Flink in the
August issue of World Tennis Palmer
was quoted as saying, "I'm thinking of

myself less and less as just a tennis
player and more and more as a student
athlete, athlete-student.
"Before I came to Stanford I debated
with myself and members of my family
about whether I should have joined the
pro tour instead of going to college. But
after being here for two years, I feel this
is where I should be," Palmer said.
He and Stark were injury-plagued
during their two-year stints wearing
cardinal and white. Palmer capped a
mediocre 32-11 season last year with an
NCAA singles title.
Stark never fulfilled his potential in
collegiate play, making early round exits
from the NCAA Championships in 1989
and 1990. They both possess solid
serve-and-volley games which may give
them an advantage over more defense
minded players on the tour.
As NCAA champion, Palmer received
an automatic berth in the main draw of
the U.S. Open. He lost a five-set battle
in the first round to Frenchman
Rodolphe Gilbert 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, 7-6
(7-4). Palmer and Stark, former
Wimbledon junior doubles champs,
made it to the second round in doubles.
Earlier in the summer Stark and
Palmer reached the semifinals of the
U.S. Hardcourts by beating Stanford
alums Patrick McEnroe and David
Wheaton 6-4, 6-3.
Graham, Palmer and Stark are fol
lowing a well-established pattern of for
mer Stanford stars finding success on
the pro tour. David Wheaton reached
the semis at Wimbledon this year and
Derrick Rostagno and Tim Mayotte
reached the round of 16.
Tami Whitlinger spent some time
this summer in the top 50 in the
women's world rankings. She was one
of at least five former Stanford players
to make the women's main draw in the
U.S. Open.

wide-to-the-righthander's-two-handed-
backhand to set up her backhand volley
into the open court. Navratilova won
the second set 6-4.
With her results in the tournaments
leading up to the Open, Graham's rank
ing skyrocketed from the mid-nineties
to 49th in the world.
Also joining Graham in the pro ranks
were two of the most talented players on
the Stanford men's team, Jared Palmer
and Jonathan Stark. Palmer's decision
came as a surprise to some people.
In a story by Steve Flink in the
August issue of World Tennis Palmer
was quoted as saying, "I'm thinking of

myself less and less as just a tennis
player and more and more as a student
athlete, athlete-student.
"Before I came to Stanford I debated
with myself and members of my family
about whether I should have joined the
pro tour instead of going to college. But
after being here for two years, I feel this
is where I should be," Palmer said.
He and Stark were injury-plagued
during their two-year stints wearing
cardinal and white. Palmer capped a
mediocre 32-11 season last year with an
NCAA singles title.
Stark never fulfilled his potential in
collegiate play, making early round exits
from the NCAA Championships in 1989
and 1990. They both possess solid
serve-and-volley games which may give
them an advantage over more defense
minded players on the tour.
As NCAA champion, Palmer received
an automatic berth in the main draw of
the U.S. Open. He lost a five-set battle
in the first round to Frenchman
Rodolphe Gilbert 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, 7-6
(7-4). Palmer and Stark, former
Wimbledon junior doubles champs,
made it to the second round in doubles.
Earlier in the summer Stark and
Palmer reached the semifinals of the
U.S. Hardcourts by beating Stanford
alums Patrick McEnroe and David
Wheaton 6-4, 6-3.
Graham, Palmer and Stark are fol
lowing a well-established pattern of for
mer Stanford stars finding success on
the pro tour. David Wheaton reached
the semis at Wimbledon this year and
Derrick Rostagno and Tim Mayotte
reached the round of 16.
Tami Whitlinger spent some time
this summer in the top 50 in the
women's world rankings. She was one
of at least five former Stanford players
to make the women's main draw in the
U.S. Open.

Senior Debbie Graham has taken her power game on the road. Graham turned pro
in August and has leapt up the world rankings to land at her current spot, no. 49.
Happy trails also to Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark.
As Stanford was preparing to wel
come a new freshman class several
undergraduates said an early goodbye
to join the professional tennis tour.
Senior Debbie Graham, who returns
this fall to complete work towards a
bachelor's degree, turned pro this sum
mer along with two would-be-juniors:
Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark.
Graham had already found success
on the tour before renouncing her ama
teur status. She reached the quarterfi
nals of the Westchester Ladies Cup,
Lori McNeil stopped Graham's run with
a 7-5, 6-1 victory.
At the Mazda Classic Graham
demolished Erika deLone 6-0, 6-1 and
seventh-seeded Barbara Paulus 6-3, 6-4.
She eventually fell to the world's No. 7-
ranked player, Conchita Martinez 6-0,
7-5.
Then she made the decision. "I go
out and get to use everything I have,"
Graham said in an interview with the
Stanford Weekly. "I'm on an upswing
right now. I didn't want to go back and
regress," Graham said.
Although the decision was a difficult
one it doesn't appear to be one she will
regret. In her first tournament as a pro,
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles,
Graham lost to the 1990 U.S. Open
champion Gabriela Sabatini in the third
round 6-3, 6-1.
"I hit the ball harder than her,"
Graham said. "I serve so much harder
than her. She's not that good."
Graham had a similar experience at
the U.S. Open where she met Martina
Navratilova on Stadium Court.
If there was ever a sign that Graham
had hit the big time, this was it.
Navratilova, the nine-time Wimbledon
champion, had been making Centre

Court her backyard when Graham was
learning her multiplication tables.
Although the two had met before it
was never on such a grand stage. At a
tournament in Los Angeles last year the
Czech-born southpaw pummeled the
newly crowned NCAA singles champ.
The moment was not lost on
Graham. She was visibly nervous
through the early stages of the Stadium
Court match and dropped the first set
6-1 after winning her first service game.
Graham played inconsistently
throughout the set. She hit some win
ners but reached double digits in
unforced errors. Graham overhit sever
al passing shots and appeared to be try
ing to break the sound barrier on
almost every shot.
She settled down in the second set
and regained her touch with several
perfectly placed topspin lobs lofted over
the net-crowding Navratilova.
Graham's serve gave Navratilova
some trouble. Her first serve was
clocked at 105 miles per hour, the
fastest serve by a woman recorded on
Stadium Court during the first week of
the Open.
But Navratilova was too much. She
used her bread-and-butter- lefty-serve
wide-to-the-righthander's-two-handed-
backhand to set up her backhand volley
into the open court. Navratilova won
the second set 6-4.
With her results in the tournaments
leading up to the Open, Graham's rank
ing skyrocketed from the mid-nineties
to 49th in the world.
Also joining Graham in the pro ranks
were two of the most talented players on
