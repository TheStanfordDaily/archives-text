# Club sports: definitely diverse
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial staff 
By now you may have noticed how much
Stanford likes to emphasize the great "diversity" at
this fine institution. In fact, maybe you are sick of
the term. But "diverse" is the best way to describe
Stanford's club sports.
Over 2,000 people compete in 24 sports ranging
from badminton to ice hockey to ultimate frisbee.
Some sports have Varsity Division 111 status and
compete at a national level, while others just com
pete locally.
Varsity sports include women's field hockey, and
synchronized swimming, men's rugby lacrosse and
wrestling and co-ed sailing. They abide by national
collegiate sports regulations and usually demand
rigorous training and a high level of commitment.
Others clubs involve less of a time commitment.
People participate on a more casual basis. Everyone
from first-timers to athletes training for spots on
national teams can compete in club sports.
Participants can choose from a wide variety of
sports like polo, squash and judo, and also choose a
commitment level that suits their personal sched
ule.
While many compete just to stay in shape or to

learn a new sport, others train intensely. The level
of Stanford's athletic programs, both varsity and
club, is reflected by the fact that more members of
the 1988 United States Olympic Team were affiliat
ed with Stanford (athletes and coaches) than any
other college or university in the nation.
Club sports director Shirley Schoof acts as a liai
son between Stanford Athletics and each of the club
sports.
These teams are generally more relaxed than
varsity sports because no one has the pressure of
performing at a scholarship level. Athletes have the
opportunity to learn about sports management and
the intricate politics and funding issues that are
related to managing a team.
Funding, separate from the Athletic
Department, is allocated according to the need and
fund-raising efforts of each team. Ushering and
ticket-taking at football and basketball games
accounts for much revenue. The main fund-raiser,
however, is a benefit basketball game featuring the
Harlem Globetrotters.
Other sports include windsurfing, equestrian,
cycling, men's field hockey, women's rugby and
Softball. The list goes on and on. For more informa
tion check the club sports brochure in the club
sports office in Roble Gym.
