# Blood, guts, U-locks and bollards: Survival cycling tips for Stanford
## 
### Sean Etigson 
Looking to be one of the
streamlined men and women bik
ing their way to nirvana this
year? Be warned that Stanford
represents the cycling communi
ty's equivalent of O'Hare, and
since no one on campus has time
to work as a ground-traffic con
troller, collisions and catastro
phies continue to mount.
Consider this article preflight

preparation.
Ride to the right. Some consid
er it a lunch-time activity to sit
by the Clock Tower and watch
the carnage. With people coming
from eight directions, there's no
room for spontaneous inventions
or conversations. After years of
wipe-outs and head-on collisions,
grad students have a reason to
wear helmets, mirrors, and velcro
ties around their pant legs.
Staying in your lane and to the

right will minimize the chance of
unsightly bike tread on your face.
Watch those bollards. The uni
versity has this strange preoccu
pation with these brown posts;
they pop up in the most inconve
nient places — like chains and
tires and knees. Supposedly, they
contain the places cars can go on
campus, but they end up monkey
wrenching a lot of cyclists too.
Keep your brakes tuned nice
and tight. Even the best of cam

pus kamikazes need to bail out
sometime, and it helps to be able
to stop when you need to rather
than when you realize you should
have.
Give pedestrians slightly more
space than the width of your fin

gernail. While the urge bites to
strike terror into the hearts of all
your fellow stress-o-matics, exer
cise restraint; one of them may be
carrying a bat.
Find a friend who can change
flat tires. With all the curb-jump
ing and bumping that the campus
ride demands, you can't afford to
be going to a bike shop every time
you get a flat. In addition,
remember that riding on your
rim just adds another thirty or so
dollars into the bargain by bend
ing it.
Get a lock for your bike. Make
sure that you lock the frame and
one of the tires to a bar or a rack.
No need to contribute to the
Stanford scavenger hunt any
more than the hundreds of other
students who let their bikes be
reduced to parts for other peo
ple's wheels.
Wear a helmet for major cam
pus commuting. We don't want
you leaving here with any more
dain bramage than you're paying
for this year.
