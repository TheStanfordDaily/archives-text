# Blood, guts, U-locks and bollards: Survival cycling tips for Stanford
## 
### Sean Etigson 
Looking to be one of the
streamlined men and women bik
ing their way to nirvana this
year? Be warned that Stanford
represents the cycling communi
ty's equivalent of O'Hare, and
since no one on campus has time
to work as a ground-traffic con
troller, collisions and catastro
phies continue to mount.
Consider this article preflight

preparation.
Ride to the right. Some consid
er it a lunch-time activity to sit
by the Clock Tower and watch
the carnage. With people coming
from eight directions, there's no
room for spontaneous inventions
or conversations. After years of
wipe-outs and head-on collisions,
grad students have a reason to
wear helmets, mirrors, and velcro
ties around their pant legs.
Staying in your lane and to the

right will minimize the chance of
unsightly bike tread on your face.
Watch those bollards. The uni
versity has this strange preoccu
pation with these brown posts;
they pop up in the most inconve
nient places â€” like chains and
tires and knees. Supposedly, they
contain the places cars can go on
campus, but they end up monkey
wrenching a lot of cyclists too.
