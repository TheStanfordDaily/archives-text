# Experience may steer Card soccer to victorious season

For a club that last year put
together only its second winning
season since 1985, a pair of ties
against the nation's No. 9 and
No. 14-ranked teams would fig
ure to be a great start to the 1991
campaign.
Not so, says second-year men's
soccer coach Colin Lindores.
Junior goalkeeper Kyle Krpata
agreed, and said that the best
aspect of Stanford's trip to
Indianapolis was that his team
isn't one bit satisfied with the
result.
"You would think we'd be
happy to come away from one of

the toughest collegiate tourna
ments with two ties. But the fact
is, we know we didn't play our
best — we could have, and should
have, won both of those games. I
think that (this feeling) is good
for us, and should help drive us
later on," Krpata said.
The Cardinal blew leads in both
matches of the early September
Indiana Classic, and ended up
tying both St. Louis University (1-
1) and Indiana (2-2).
Despite their early dissatisfac
tion, Lindores and his squad do
have plenty of reasons for opti
mism about the '91 season.
Most importantly, the Card
inal returns ten starters from its
9-6-6 1990 team. Even more

encouraging is the fact that three
freshman have played to the level
of the veterans, and cracked a
starting lineup that might have
seemed set in stone last
November.
Indeed, freshman forward
Ryan Collins and midfielder Greg
Wilson accounted for two of the
team's three goals at the Classic.
And fellow rookie Jeff Kogl has
manned the important sweeper
position from the season's outset.
Lindores has been pleasantly
surprised by the play of the new
comers, and said that Kogl, espe
cially, has not seemed at all fazed
by a starting role in the center of

Junior Jim Taliuto led the Cardinal with 10 goals last season and hopes to spearhead the offense again
this year. The starting forward's skillful play helped the team recently tie two top-15 squads.
defense.
"Considering that Jeff had to
play his first collegiate game at
one of the country's top tourna
ments, against teams like Indiana
and St. Louis, I think he's played
very well. If he was nervous, he
sure didn't show it," Krpata said.
Kogl said he was surprised
that he landed a starting position
so swiftly, but he has accepted
the role of sweeper in stride.
"Sure, there's added pressure
because it's a central position —
if I screw up people are going to
notice. But I played sweeper
throughout my high school
career, so I'm used to the posi
tion. I actually feel more comfort
able there than I would anywhere
else," Kogl said.
The anchor of the Cardinal
defense, goalkeeper Krpata, is
coming off a strong sophomore
season in which he started all 21
games.
Perhaps more impressive was
Krpata's summer, in which he
started for the West team in the
Olympic Festival. And after an
injury claimed its second string
goalie, the national team sum
moned Krpata's services for a
brief stint, including a tourna
ment in Haiti.

"Last year was a good growth
year for me. Now I've got one
year under my belt, and I want to
raise my game to a higher level,"
Krpata said.
He got off to a great start in
Indiana. In giving up only three
goals in two games against top-15
schools, Lindores said Krpata
"was brilliant, without his great
play we would have come away
with two losses instead of two
ties."
Krpata's performance earned
him a spot on the Classic's all
tournament team. Teammate
Lance Killian, a junior forward,
was also named to the team.
Killian is just one of the
Cardinal's top seven scorers
returning from last season. Top
scorer Jim Talluto had 10 goals
and three assists last year for 23
points.
The man recognized as the
Cardinal's top player, however,

won't be found atop last year's
scoring list. And because Rhett
Harty is still drawing more than
his share of defenders, he proba
bly won't finish among this sea
son's leaders' either. He did, how
ever, just finish a successful off
season competing for the national
team.
"Harty has demonstrated a lot
more confidence so far this sea
son as a result of his playing on
the national team. But it will be
difficult for him to adjust moving
down a level of play. He'll have to
approach the game different
mentally and guard against com
placency," Lindores said.
"My experience with the
national team was definitely a
confidence builder. But at the
same time I found out I still have
a lot to learn about the sport,"
Harty said.
If last year is any indication,
Cardinal opponents still have a
lot to learn before they'll be able
to slow down Stanford's offensive
attack.
But when a team comes home
angry after tying with two tradi
tional powers like Indiana and St.
Louis, you get the feeling their
sights are set a bit higher.
"We've come a long way since
I've been here," Krpata said. "We
definitely have a chance to make
the NCAA tournament and do
well there. If we don't, it's
nobody's fault but our own."
