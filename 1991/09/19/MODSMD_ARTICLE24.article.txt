# Experience may steer Card soccer to victorious season

For a club that last year put
together only its second winning
season since 1985, a pair of ties
against the nation's No. 9 and
No. 14-ranked teams would fig
ure to be a great start to the 1991
campaign.
Not so, says second-year men's
soccer coach Colin Lindores.
Junior goalkeeper Kyle Krpata
agreed, and said that the best
aspect of Stanford's trip to
Indianapolis was that his team
isn't one bit satisfied with the
result.
"You would think we'd be
happy to come away from one of

the toughest collegiate tourna
ments with two ties. But the fact
is, we know we didn't play our
best — we could have, and should
have, won both of those games. I
think that (this feeling) is good
for us, and should help drive us
later on," Krpata said.
The Cardinal blew leads in both
matches of the early September
Indiana Classic, and ended up
tying both St. Louis University (1-
1) and Indiana (2-2).
Despite their early dissatisfac
tion, Lindores and his squad do
have plenty of reasons for opti
mism about the '91 season.
Most importantly, the Card
inal returns ten starters from its
9-6-6 1990 team. Even more

encouraging is the fact that three
freshman have played to the level
of the veterans, and cracked a
starting lineup that might have
seemed set in stone last
November.
Indeed, freshman forward
Ryan Collins and midfielder Greg
Wilson accounted for two of the
team's three goals at the Classic.
And fellow rookie Jeff Kogl has
manned the important sweeper
position from the season's outset.
Lindores has been pleasantly
surprised by the play of the new
comers, and said that Kogl, espe
cially, has not seemed at all fazed
by a starting role in the center of

Junior Jim Taliuto led the Cardinal with 10 goals last season and hopes to spearhead the offense again
this year. The starting forward's skillful play helped the team recently tie two top-15 squads.
