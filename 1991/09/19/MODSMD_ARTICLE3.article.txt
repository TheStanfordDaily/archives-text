# Sensational frosh expected to make mark at Stanford
## 
### Laurie Wackier 
Every freshman dorm has them, whether they're
All-Conference, All-American, All-World, or All of
the Above.
They're those highly touted, highly recruited ath
letes who chose the Farm and have arrived for their
induction into the world of collegiate athletics. From
the football player, to the gymnast, to the swimmer,
these freshmen rank among the nation's elite in
their respective sports.
Stanford's unique combination of academic and
athletic excellence has traditionally attracted top
recruits. This year's entering class is no exception,
featuring athletes with the potential to contribute
immediately, as well as in future years.
Standout Justin Armour, perhaps the most her
alded rookie on the Farm, will sport both a helmet
and high-tops this year. Armour — a native of
Manitou Springs, Colorado — arrives as a highly
sought-after quarterback.
His size (6-foot-6, 225 pounds) as well as his high
school stats are impressive for a quarterback. In his
senior season Armour passed for 27 touchdowns and
rushed for 25 touchdowns, leading his high school to
the state championship, with a 13-0 record.
However, his stellar football stats are rivaled by
those he amassed on the basketball court: as a power
forward, he averaged 26 points and 13.5 rebounds in
his senior year.
Although Armour anticipates that he may have to
choose between football and basketball sometime in
the future, for the time being, he will participate in
both. Armour will redshirt in football this season
and will be released from practice on Oct. 1, in order
to participate in pre-season basketball workouts.
Joining Armour on the field are two football lega
cies, defensive lineman Nathan Olsen and linebacker
Coy Gibbs. Olsen, son of broadcaster and former
Rams star Merlin Olsen, and Gibbs, son of Redskins
coach Joe Gibbs, may both see significant playing
time as the injury-ridden Cardinal looks to its
reserves.
There is no shortage of freshman talent in other
fall sports. Both the men's and women's soccer
teams boast a crop of promising young players.

Notably, midfielder Greg Wilson scored
Stanford's only goal in a 1-1 tie against No. 12-
ranked St. Louis University. The women's volley
ball team also has several top athletes, who will
have an opportunity to learn from a group of talent
ed veterans.
Freshmen are making a big splash on the water
polo and swimming teams this year. Two rookies on
the men's water polo team have already contributed
to several victories. Two-meter man Frank
Schneider and driver Wolf Wigo each accounted for
several goals in Stanford's offensive attack in last
weekend's season openers.
International competition is no stranger to the
freshmen swimmers. At the Pan American Games,
Clay Tippins, a recruit from Georgia, swam the third
leg of the 800 freestyle relay, capturing the gold
medal. He is expected to play a significant role on
the men's team.
Meanwhile, at the Pan Pacific Championships,
Jenny Johnson sprinted to a gold in the 50 freestyle.
Teammates Julie Kole and Mary Ellen Blanchard
claimed firsts at the U.S.S. Nationals.
As Justin Armour laces up his shoes to join the
men's basketball team, the women hoopsters will
welcome some outstanding freshmen. Among these
are two women who played in the Olympic Festival
this summer.
Guard Tanda Rucker, who has the chance to fill
star guard Sonja Henning's shoes, competed for the
West, along with sophomore Christy Hedgpeth.
Competing against the tandem was freshman center
Anita Kaplan, who played for the East.
By the time baseball season rolls around in the
spring, the freshmen will know all the ropes.
Of the recruits, three — Shawn Green (outfield),
Scott Pisciotta (pitcher), and Todd Laßocca (short
stop) — were drafted in June, but chose college base
ball over the pros. Pisciotta, a right- handed hurler
from Georgia, was one of Stanford's many represen
tatives in the Olympic Festival.
Once again, some of the finest young talent will
be inducted into both the men's and women's tennis
teams. Amy Chiminello, U.S. National Amateur
Champion, will join Stanford's defending NCAA
championship team.
