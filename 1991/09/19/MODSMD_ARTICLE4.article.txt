# Injury-riddled Cardinal faces tough schedule
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Don't panic!
This is key. Remember it.
By starting the season with
consecutive Pacific 10 Conference
losses, the Stanford football team
has turned fan hopes of a bowl
bid into fear of ever seeing the
.500 mark this year. The confi
dence generated around The
Farm from last season's three
win finish (climaxed by the
improbable/slightly unbelievable
Big Game win) is gone now, a sit
uation made even more sad
because it all happened before the
students even finished summer
vacation.
But for the sake of our boys
in cardinal and white, and the
general sanity of the entire
Stanford community, let us be a
little realistic for a moment:
I)The season is only two
games old. There are nine more
games to be played and anything
can happen.
2)Being 0-2 in the Pac-10 does
mean that Stanford is effectively
out of the Rose Bowl race, but
(being optimistic realists) a 7-2
record in their remaining games
will still send the Cardinal into
the post-season. If head coach
Denny Green cannot do that,
then have heart in the scary
thought that even 6-5 teams have
gone to bowl games before.
With these things in mind it is
time to look at what exactly we'll
be seeing in Stanford Stadium this
year. The main thing is that fans
will be at no loss for entertaining
football. The scheduling powers
that be have graced the Cardinal
with one of the toughest groups of
opponents in the country.
After having to open the sea
son against No. 4 Washington,
Stanford has the dubious honor
of presenting itself to the general
student population for the first
time this year against No. 19
Colorado and No. 11 Notre Dame
on consecutive weekends. Even
knowing that a home game
against Cornell follows Notre
Dame is only empty satisfaction;
this is the first year that the
NCAA requires six victories
against Division IA opponents to
qualify a team for a bowl game,
and sorry to say it folks, but the
Big Red of Cornell are Div. IAA
Whoops! (forget what I said about
6-5 teams going to bowl games)
This all of course does not
even include the remaining six
games in the Pac-10 schedule
(which sadly does not include
lowly Oregon State), games
which are never easy. What this
boils down to is that Stanford
football has its work cut out for
it, but possessing a very big, fast,
talented group of individuals
means that this squad is capable
of surprising a few people, and

will always show the fans quality
football. With that in mind, this
is what we g0t....
SPECIAL TEAMS:
You have to start here because
this the real home of Heisman
Trophy (given annually to the
finest collegiate player in the
land) hopeful Glyn Milburn. Last
year as a red-shirt sophomore
Milburn led the nation with
2,222 all-purpose running yards,
and 861 of those came on some
very exciting punt and kickoff
returns. Stacking this up against
his 729 rushing yards and 632
receiving yards, it is easy, to see
why Milburn was last years most
complete all-purpose player.
But break it into individual
skills, and his returning skills
shine as his greatest contribution
to the team. If Milburn can dupli
cate his average of 24.8 yards per
kick-off return, then Stanford
will find itself with good field
position all year. On the kicking
side, both junior punter Paul
Stonehouse and sophomore kick
er Aaron Mills have something to
prove. Mills must fill the shoes of
Stanford all-time points scored
leader John Hopkins, and
Stonehouse must rebound from a
disappointing 1990 season that
saw him average 38.2 yards a
punt. Seniors J.J. Lasley and
Vince Otoupal lead an excellent
defensive coverage team.
OFFENSE:
Offense Backfield: Fifth
year senior quarterback Jason
Palumbis is only one of many
headliners in a very talented
group. A strong 1990 saw
Palumbis finish first in the Pac
-10 in passing efficiency (137.5
rating) largly on his school record
.686 completion percentage.
Palumbis finished the year com
pleting 234-of-341 passes for
2,579 yards and 11 touchdowns
while leading Green's short, con
trolled passing attack.
On the ground Stanford pos
sesses a group of running backs
that is highlighted by Milburn
and fullback "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell. Vardell scored a
school record 14 TD's last year,
10 coming from 1-yard plunges.
If Milburn is the speed, then
Vardell is certainly the size. The
6-3, 235-pound back will be used
primarily up the middle, and his
career best 130 yards against
Arizona last week shows that he
can never be overlooked.
J.J. Lasley provides depth as
Milburn's halfback partner. The
6-0, 208 pounder is probably the
team's best traditional looking
running back, possessing the size
to go up the middle and the speed
to pick up big gains. Lasley aver
aged 6.5 yards a carry last year,
though he only got the ball 10
times. In Green's wide open

offensive attack plan to see all
three coming out of the backfield
looking for a pass. Milburn's 64
receptions led the Pac-10 last
year.
Receivers: Though Ail-
American receiver Ed McCaffrey
is now a member of the Super
Bowl Champion New York
Giants, the hole left should not
be too big to fill. Senior Chris
Walsh will take over for
McCaffrey, having last year fin
ished third on the team in recep
tions with 29 catches that totaled
386 yards, and developing a repu
tation of dependability. 1990
starting flanker Jon Pinkney is
back and will be a prime
Palumbis target. Last year
Pinkney caught 23 passes for 303
yards.
Offensive Line: The offen
sive line is anchored by 6-7, 300
pound junior left tackle Bob
Whitfield, a 1990 Outland
Trophy (given to the nation's
finest collegiate lineman) finalist.
Whitfield has been everybody's
pre-season Ail-American and is
one of the leading candidates for
this year's Outland. The great
thing about Stanford's offensive
line is that, as big as Whitfield is,
he is only one of many. Cardinal
opponents looking towards stop
ping Milburn and Palumbis will
be staring at over 1,500 pounds
of lineman bulk. The 300-pound
average is the school's largest in
history, but as Green is quick to
point out, big does not mean best.
Left guard Brian Cassidy, right
tackle Steve Hoyem, center Glen
Cavanaugh and right guard Chris
Dalman all have the size and
potential to be very good, yet
according to Green they, "still
face the challenge of playing bet
ter football."
DEFENSE
This is a unit currently
besieged by injuries and inexperi
ence, all of which need to be over
come if Stanford is to successful
this year. The 17-0 lead that
Stanford relinquished to Arizona
(ending in a 28-23 loss) last week
was due primarily to the fact that
by the end of the game, eight of
the 11 Stanford defensive
starters were on the bench.
Linebackers: Inside line
backer Dave Garnett did not
start the game due to chipped
bones in his right thumb, and
then outside linebacker Ron
George had to leave in the third
quarter with a deep bruise in his
right thigh. An honors candidate
this season, George led the Pac
-10 in tackles-for-loss (18) and
was second in quarterback sacks
(10) while finishing fourth on the
team with 63 total tackles last
season. Joining in the injury
parade is Senior inside linebacker
Tom Williams (pulled groin), a
five-game starter last year who is
listed as a starter if he gets
healthy. The duties at right out
side linebacker will be shared by
converted QB Tommy Knecht
and Otoupal.
Defensive Line: Senior left
tackle Estevan Avila is the most
experienced member of a line
that has a good mix of age and
youth, but he strained a knee
against Arizona and his status is
uncertain. Sophomore Jason Fisk
won the starting nose tackle job
from 1990 eight game starter
Aaron Rembisz, but Fisk was also
an Arizona casualty (bruised
knee). Right tackle Tyler Batson
is a developing talent that some
say has NFL talent, yet that ver
dict might have to wait as Batson

went down with a possible con
cussion last Saturday.
Defensive Backfield: The
defensive secondary is a bit of a
mess. Gone to the NFL is star
cornerback Kevin Scott, and out
for the year with a knee injury is
last year's strong safety Jimmy
Klein. What is left is currently
injured junior free safety Seyon
Albert (backed by Senior Albert
Richardson), and junior corner
back Darrien Gordon. The rest of
the defensive backfield played
offense last year; John Lynch was
the back-up QB, and Vaughn
Bryant was a receiver. This does
not bode well for a team that had
troubles with the pass last year.
The bottom line is that the
Stanford football team will com
pete well every Saturday and pick
up some wins along the way. How
many is another story, but don't
worry, just stand and cheer â€”
the rest will take care of itself.
Don't panic!

Big Red of Cornell are Div. IAA
Whoops! (forget what I said about
6-5 teams going to bowl games)
This all of course does not
even include the remaining six
games in the Pac-10 schedule
(which sadly does not include
lowly Oregon State), games
which are never easy. What this
boils down to is that Stanford
football has its work cut out for
it, but possessing a very big, fast,
talented group of individuals
means that this squad is capable
of surprising a few people, and

will always show the fans quality
football. With that in mind, this
is what we g0t....
SPECIAL TEAMS:
You have to start here because
this the real home of Heisman
Trophy (given annually to the
finest collegiate player in the
land) hopeful Glyn Milburn. Last
year as a red-shirt sophomore
Milburn led the nation with
2,222 all-purpose running yards,
and 861 of those came on some
very exciting punt and kickoff
returns. Stacking this up against
his 729 rushing yards and 632
receiving yards, it is easy, to see
why Milburn was last years most
complete all-purpose player.
But break it into individual
skills, and his returning skills
shine as his greatest contribution
to the team. If Milburn can dupli
cate his average of 24.8 yards per
kick-off return, then Stanford
will find itself with good field
position all year. On the kicking
side, both junior punter Paul
Stonehouse and sophomore kick
er Aaron Mills have something to
prove. Mills must fill the shoes of
Stanford all-time points scored
leader John Hopkins, and
Stonehouse must rebound from a
disappointing 1990 season that
saw him average 38.2 yards a
punt. Seniors J.J. Lasley and
Vince Otoupal lead an excellent
defensive coverage team.
OFFENSE:
Offense Backfield: Fifth
year senior quarterback Jason
Palumbis is only one of many
headliners in a very talented
group. A strong 1990 saw
Palumbis finish first in the Pac
-10 in passing efficiency (137.5
rating) largly on his school record
.686 completion percentage.
Palumbis finished the year com
pleting 234-of-341 passes for
2,579 yards and 11 touchdowns
while leading Green's short, con
trolled passing attack.
On the ground Stanford pos
sesses a group of running backs
that is highlighted by Milburn
and fullback "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell. Vardell scored a
school record 14 TD's last year,
10 coming from 1-yard plunges.
If Milburn is the speed, then
Vardell is certainly the size. The
6-3, 235-pound back will be used
primarily up the middle, and his
career best 130 yards against
Arizona last week shows that he
can never be overlooked.
J.J. Lasley provides depth as
Milburn's halfback partner. The
6-0, 208 pounder is probably the
team's best traditional looking
running back, possessing the size
to go up the middle and the speed
to pick up big gains. Lasley aver
aged 6.5 yards a carry last year,
though he only got the ball 10
times. In Green's wide open

offensive attack plan to see all
three coming out of the backfield
looking for a pass. Milburn's 64
receptions led the Pac-10 last
year.
Receivers: Though Ail-
American receiver Ed McCaffrey
is now a member of the Super
Bowl Champion New York
Giants, the hole left should not
be too big to fill. Senior Chris
Walsh will take over for
McCaffrey, having last year fin
ished third on the team in recep
tions with 29 catches that totaled
386 yards, and developing a repu
tation of dependability. 1990
starting flanker Jon Pinkney is
back and will be a prime
Palumbis target. Last year
Pinkney caught 23 passes for 303
yards.
Offensive Line: The offen
sive line is anchored by 6-7, 300
pound junior left tackle Bob
Whitfield, a 1990 Outland
Trophy (given to the nation's
finest collegiate lineman) finalist.
Whitfield has been everybody's
pre-season Ail-American and is
one of the leading candidates for
this year's Outland. The great
thing about Stanford's offensive
line is that, as big as Whitfield is,
he is only one of many. Cardinal
opponents looking towards stop
ping Milburn and Palumbis will
be staring at over 1,500 pounds
of lineman bulk. The 300-pound
average is the school's largest in
history, but as Green is quick to
point out, big does not mean best.
Left guard Brian Cassidy, right
tackle Steve Hoyem, center Glen
Cavanaugh and right guard Chris
Dalman all have the size and
potential to be very good, yet
according to Green they, "still
face the challenge of playing bet
ter football."
DEFENSE
This is a unit currently
besieged by injuries and inexperi
ence, all of which need to be over
come if Stanford is to successful
this year. The 17-0 lead that
Stanford relinquished to Arizona
(ending in a 28-23 loss) last week
was due primarily to the fact that
by the end of the game, eight of
the 11 Stanford defensive
starters were on the bench.
Linebackers: Inside line
backer Dave Garnett did not
start the game due to chipped
bones in his right thumb, and
then outside linebacker Ron
George had to leave in the third
quarter with a deep bruise in his
right thigh. An honors candidate
this season, George led the Pac
-10 in tackles-for-loss (18) and
was second in quarterback sacks
(10) while finishing fourth on the
team with 63 total tackles last
season. Joining in the injury
parade is Senior inside linebacker
Tom Williams (pulled groin), a
five-game starter last year who is
listed as a starter if he gets
healthy. The duties at right out
side linebacker will be shared by
converted QB Tommy Knecht
and Otoupal.
Defensive Line: Senior left
tackle Estevan Avila is the most
experienced member of a line
that has a good mix of age and
youth, but he strained a knee
against Arizona and his status is
uncertain. Sophomore Jason Fisk
won the starting nose tackle job
from 1990 eight game starter
Aaron Rembisz, but Fisk was also
an Arizona casualty (bruised
knee). Right tackle Tyler Batson
is a developing talent that some
say has NFL talent, yet that ver
dict might have to wait as Batson

went down with a possible con
cussion last Saturday.
Defensive Backfield: The
defensive secondary is a bit of a
mess. Gone to the NFL is star
cornerback Kevin Scott, and out
for the year with a knee injury is
last year's strong safety Jimmy
Klein. What is left is currently
injured junior free safety Seyon
Albert (backed by Senior Albert
Richardson), and junior corner
back Darrien Gordon. The rest of
the defensive backfield played
offense last year; John Lynch was
the back-up QB, and Vaughn
Bryant was a receiver. This does
not bode well for a team that had
troubles with the pass last year.
The bottom line is that the
Stanford football team will com
pete well every Saturday and pick
up some wins along the way. How
many is another story, but don't
worry, just stand and cheer â€”
the rest will take care of itself.
Don't panic!
This is key. Remember it.
By starting the season with
consecutive Pacific 10 Conference
losses, the Stanford football team
has turned fan hopes of a bowl
bid into fear of ever seeing the
.500 mark this year. The confi
dence generated around The
Farm from last season's three
win finish (climaxed by the
improbable/slightly unbelievable
Big Game win) is gone now, a sit
uation made even more sad
because it all happened before the
students even finished summer
vacation.
But for the sake of our boys
in cardinal and white, and the
general sanity of the entire
Stanford community, let us be a
little realistic for a moment:
I)The season is only two
games old. There are nine more
games to be played and anything
can happen.
2)Being 0-2 in the Pac-10 does
mean that Stanford is effectively
out of the Rose Bowl race, but
(being optimistic realists) a 7-2
record in their remaining games
will still send the Cardinal into
the post-season. If head coach
Denny Green cannot do that,
then have heart in the scary
thought that even 6-5 teams have
gone to bowl games before.
With these things in mind it is
time to look at what exactly we'll
be seeing in Stanford Stadium this
year. The main thing is that fans
will be at no loss for entertaining
football. The scheduling powers
that be have graced the Cardinal
with one of the toughest groups of
opponents in the country.
After having to open the sea
son against No. 4 Washington,
Stanford has the dubious honor
of presenting itself to the general
student population for the first
time this year against No. 19
Colorado and No. 11 Notre Dame
on consecutive weekends. Even
knowing that a home game
against Cornell follows Notre
Dame is only empty satisfaction;
this is the first year that the
NCAA requires six victories
against Division IA opponents to
qualify a team for a bowl game,
and sorry to say it folks, but the
Big Red of Cornell are Div. IAA
Whoops! (forget what I said about

Palumbis finish first in the Pac
-10 in passing efficiency (137.5
rating) largly on his school record
.686 completion percentage.
Palumbis finished the year com
pleting 234-of-341 passes for
2,579 yards and 11 touchdowns
while leading Green's short, con
trolled passing attack.
On the ground Stanford pos
sesses a group of running backs
that is highlighted by Milburn
and fullback "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell. Vardell scored a
school record 14 TD's last year,
10 coming from 1-yard plunges.
If Milburn is the speed, then
Vardell is certainly the size. The
6-3, 235-pound back will be used
primarily up the middle, and his
career best 130 yards against
Arizona last week shows that he
can never be overlooked.
J.J. Lasley provides depth as
Milburn's halfback partner. The
6-0, 208 pounder is probably the
team's best traditional looking
running back, possessing the size
to go up the middle and the speed
to pick up big gains. Lasley aver
aged 6.5 yards a carry last year,
though he only got the ball 10
times. In Green's wide open

offensive attack plan to see all
three coming out of the backfield
looking for a pass. Milburn's 64
receptions led the Pac-10 last
year.
Receivers: Though Ail-
American receiver Ed McCaffrey
is now a member of the Super
Bowl Champion New York
Giants, the hole left should not
be too big to fill. Senior Chris
Walsh will take over for
McCaffrey, having last year fin
ished third on the team in recep
tions with 29 catches that totaled
386 yards, and developing a repu
tation of dependability. 1990
starting flanker Jon Pinkney is
back and will be a prime
Palumbis target. Last year
Pinkney caught 23 passes for 303
yards.
Offensive Line: The offen
sive line is anchored by 6-7, 300
pound junior left tackle Bob
Whitfield, a 1990 Outland
Trophy (given to the nation's
finest collegiate lineman) finalist.
Whitfield has been everybody's
pre-season Ail-American and is
one of the leading candidates for
this year's Outland. The great
thing about Stanford's offensive
line is that, as big as Whitfield is,
he is only one of many. Cardinal
opponents looking towards stop
ping Milburn and Palumbis will
be staring at over 1,500 pounds
of lineman bulk. The 300-pound
average is the school's largest in
history, but as Green is quick to
point out, big does not mean best.
Left guard Brian Cassidy, right
tackle Steve Hoyem, center Glen
Cavanaugh and right guard Chris
Dalman all have the size and
potential to be very good, yet
according to Green they, "still
face the challenge of playing bet
ter football."
DEFENSE
This is a unit currently
besieged by injuries and inexperi
ence, all of which need to be over
come if Stanford is to successful
this year. The 17-0 lead that
Stanford relinquished to Arizona
(ending in a 28-23 loss) last week
was due primarily to the fact that
by the end of the game, eight of
the 11 Stanford defensive
starters were on the bench.
Linebackers: Inside line
backer Dave Garnett did not
start the game due to chipped
bones in his right thumb, and
then outside linebacker Ron
George had to leave in the third
quarter with a deep bruise in his
right thigh. An honors candidate
this season, George led the Pac
-10 in tackles-for-loss (18) and
was second in quarterback sacks
(10) while finishing fourth on the
team with 63 total tackles last
season. Joining in the injury
parade is Senior inside linebacker
Tom Williams (pulled groin), a
five-game starter last year who is
listed as a starter if he gets
healthy. The duties at right out
side linebacker will be shared by
converted QB Tommy Knecht
and Otoupal.
Defensive Line: Senior left
tackle Estevan Avila is the most
experienced member of a line
that has a good mix of age and
youth, but he strained a knee
against Arizona and his status is
uncertain. Sophomore Jason Fisk
won the starting nose tackle job
from 1990 eight game starter
Aaron Rembisz, but Fisk was also
an Arizona casualty (bruised
knee). Right tackle Tyler Batson
is a developing talent that some
say has NFL talent, yet that ver
dict might have to wait as Batson

went down with a possible con
cussion last Saturday.
Defensive Backfield: The
defensive secondary is a bit of a
mess. Gone to the NFL is star
cornerback Kevin Scott, and out
for the year with a knee injury is
last year's strong safety Jimmy
Klein. What is left is currently
injured junior free safety Seyon
Albert (backed by Senior Albert
Richardson), and junior corner
back Darrien Gordon. The rest of
the defensive backfield played
offense last year; John Lynch was
the back-up QB, and Vaughn
Bryant was a receiver. This does
not bode well for a team that had
troubles with the pass last year.
The bottom line is that the
Stanford football team will com
pete well every Saturday and pick
up some wins along the way. How
many is another story, but don't
worry, just stand and cheer â€”
the rest will take care of itself.
