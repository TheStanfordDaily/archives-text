# 'Big Three' ready to lead No. 1-ranked spikers on title run
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Last year, the "experts" doubted
that Stanford's young women's
volleyball team could compete with
the top schools in the nation.
The Cardinal players felt slight
ed. The women responded with a
27-4 record. Three losses came at
the hands of NCAA champion
UCLA and the fourth from Pacific.
The women in cardinal and white
finished third in the final NCAA
ranking.
In 1991, the "experts" have
learned their lesson — the Cardinal
women's volleyball team is for real.
Stanford's combination of expe
rience, talent, and understanding
of the game combine to make this
team one of the preseason favorites
to win the NCAA title in December.
After No. 1 UCLA's road loss to
Hawaii on Sept. 8, Stanford moved
up to the top of both polls for the
first time since 1986.

The Cardinal returns six players
from last year who have a solid
base of starting experience, includ
ing the three players at the heart of
the squad, whom 12th-year coach
Don Shaw calls "the Big 3."
The first member of the trio is
1990 NCAA Player of the Year
junior hitter Bev Oden. Last year,
she led the team in kills and blocks
and was second in hitting percent
age while establishing herself as
one of the most dominant players
in college volleyball today. She is an
intimidating blocker and a power
ful, high hitter.
Oden was the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year and a first-team Ail-
American in 1989. She has been an
impact on the team ever since she
arrived on the Farm.
Senior hitter Kristin Klein,
Stanford's team captain this year,
has also been one of the dominant
players in the Pac-10 since her
freshman year.
She, like Oden, was a Pac-10
Freshman of the Year and first
team All-American since arriving
at Stanford in 1988. She has been
All-American every year at
Stanford. Last season, she led the
Cardinal in digs and came up sec
ond in kills. Klein's play is high
lighted by monstrous outside hit
ting and excellent defense.
Leading the team (and the con
ference) last year in hitting per
centage is the third member of the
Big 3 , senior Amy Cooper. She set
an NCAA record in 1990, hitting
13 kills on 13 attempts against
California, and then later that
week continued her hot streak by
hitting .521 against St. Mary's and
.600 against No. 2-ranked
Nebraska.
The Big 3 played overseas this
summer on the national team, rep
resenting the U.S. at the Pan-Am
Games in Havana, Cuba, and the

World University Games in
Sheffield, England, where they
won the bronze medal.
"All three have improved [since
last yearl, and that's real good for
us. The international experience
has helped them tremendously,"
Shaw said.
Shaw is quick to point out that
right now he is more interested in
how the other Cardinal players are
performing.
"I know what to expect from the
Big 3, so I'm looking at the other
players. The players at the other
positions need to be key players —
they have to contribute for us to do
well. If other teams gang up on
Bev, Kristin, and Amy, someone
else will have to step up and con
tribute," Shaw explained.
Stanford's setter situation is an
asset as well. Carrie Feldman, a
junior, has been the starting setter
for the past two seasons. She set a
Stanford freshman record with
1,041 assists in 1989, breaking
four-time All-American Wendi
Humphreys' previous mark. In
addition, she had a school-record
83 assists in a game against UCLA
last year.
Stanford's other big asset at set
ter, sophomore Piper Hahn, was
frequently used last year to give
the team a change of tempo in mid
match. In 1989 she was Volleyball
Monthly's high school co-Player of
the Year, and she should be a big
contributor again this year.
Shaw believes that he has one of
the best setting tandems in the
country.
"Carrie has proven that she is
one of the best setters in the coun
try, and Piper is of that caliber as
well. We have great depth at set
ter," Shaw said.
Athletic juniors Kristi Paaso,
Jennifer Jackson and Nicole
Appleman will compete for the

remaining two starting spots.
Paaso was a starter in the second
half of 1989 and at the first of last
season until injuring her back.
She came back near the end of the
season to help the Cardinal make
a strong showing in the 1990
NCAA tournament. She will be a
strong contender to start again
this year.
Jackson started in 28 matches
last season as a punishing outside
hitter and, despite bothersome ten
dinitis in her knee, will be expected

to play extensively again in 1991.
Appleman has played solidly in
the past two seasons. Her ability to
hit effectively from the right, mid
dle, and left makes her a potent
weapon.
Junior Laurie Sawin and sopho
mores Heidi Eick, Danielle Everett,
and Kathy Jurgens are all expected
to bring in strong support off of the
bench. Sawin's defense, Eick's
blocking, Everett's passing, and
Jurgens' defensive play make each
of them a valuable commodity for

the Stanford squad. To say that the
Cardinal has depth would be a
giant understatement.
The 1991 Stanford women's vol
leyball team is a focused, deter
mined group. Shaw does not rely
on their talent alone to win, but
tries to add knowledge of the game
to their arsenal of the weapons.
"I assume that all my players
will be students of the game,"
Shaw said.

Year Bev Oden, shown here in a match last season against California, has her sight set on a kill.
