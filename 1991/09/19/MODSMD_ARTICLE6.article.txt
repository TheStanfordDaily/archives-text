# Booters shoot for top marks in class and on field
## Coach says team goals are honor roll and NCAA title 
### Kevin Jeffery Editorial staff 
As the coach of a Cardinal women's
soccer team that's done nothing but con
sistently improve during his four-year
reign, Berhane Andeberhan has his
sights set on the 1991 national champi
onship.
"This season I've set two goals for
our club: number one, to have every one
of our players makes the academic
honor roll, and number two, to win a
national championship. We know we
may not be able to achieve either of
them, but in the process of trying, we're
going to accomplish a lot of positive
things," Andeberhan said.
But the latter goal may not be far
fetched at all. The Cardinal welcomes a
number of recruits who will make an
immediate impact, and returns both one
of the college game's top sweepers and
arguably the premier scoring tandem in
the country.
That tandem, sophomore forward
Sarah Rafanelli and junior Ail-American
midfielder Julie Foudy, accounted for 55
of Stanford's 124 points last season.
Rafanelli's 28 points made her the
Cardinal's leading scorer (11 goals, 6
assists), while Foudy led the club in
goals with 12 (5 assists, 27 points).
Rafanelli exploded on the college

scene last season with three goals in her
first game, and never slowed down. Her
lightning speed has already led to five
goals in just two games this season.
Andeberhan calls Foudy "probably
the best player in all of college," and not
many disagree.
"She gives us everything she has in
every game and every practice. She's an
unassuming, unselfish player who gives
us great leadership," extolled
Andeberhan.
Foudy will have to assume a leader
ship role if Stanford wants to even think
about filling the vacuum left by the
graduation of goalkeeper Elise Edwards.
"She was one of the best goalkeepers
I've ever coached, but I think with Leslie
Garrard, we can replace her on the field.
The huge loss for us is the leadership by
example she provided for our players off

Andeberhan said.
Sophomore Leslie Garrard will inher
it the majority of the goalkeeping duties,
but her job will be eased by the strength
of the defense in front of her.
Freshmen Melinda Minstrell and
Kristen Wair will join veterans Heather
Mclntyre and Kerry Stivaletti. Mclntyre
is the sweeper in the solid core of a
bunch that has allowed one goal in two
wins against UC Davis and UC Santa
Barbara.
With an influx of talented newcomers
and eight starters returning from last
year's squad, a Cardinal strong point in
the coming season will be depth. Indeed,
Stanford will feature a bench that
includes players who last year held
starting jobs.
"The difference between this season
and last season is that instead of having
six or seven good players, and making
due at other positions, we can now field
a full lineup of quality players,"
Andeberhan said.
That lineup has kickstarted the
Cardinal season into high gear early.
Sunday's win over national power Santa
Barbara gave Stanford a 2-0-0 record
and the feeling that a run at the nation
al championship isn't as far-fetched as it
once seemed.
