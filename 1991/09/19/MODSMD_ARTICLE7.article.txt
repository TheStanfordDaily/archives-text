# IMs: Why study if you can play?
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Editorial stair 
What? You haven't won an Olympic medal OR
broken a world record? Contrary to popular
belief, most of the Stanford student body hasn't
either. Do not iet the awesome talents of a few
local stars scare you away from pursuing your
own athletic interests.
Intramurals are a great way to release those
anxieties over CIV papers and to burn off all that
caloric, fatty Food Service pottage. Do not think
that IMs are just an easy, relaxed way to break a
sweat. Some people take these very seriously!
With three divisions, All University, All Women
and Coed, there is a place for both the ex-high
school star ever searching for lost glory days and
the uncoordinated library recluse who likes to
come out and run around and have fun once a
week.
Your dorm has an IM representative, (one of
the RAs), who will help coordinate teams and
schedules for the various sports. Signing up usu
ally involves camping out at Ford at least one day
in advance since practically all of the dorms want
to compete.
This fall, there are ten sports to choose from.

Football is atways highly popular, as are volley
ball and coed inner-tube water polo. Each sport
has unique rules. For many, like football, this
includes providing referees for other dorms'
games.
If these do not offer enough contact or excite
ment, wrestling, handball doubles or basketball
may do the trick. There is also a separate free
throws competition.
For those who came to California in search of
sun, golf and cross country running will provide
hours of rays.
Playing tennis is also a great way to keep up
that golden cancerous tan (or blistering burn).
Since most of our tennis games are nowhere near
the level the untouchable men's and women's
tennis teams, the Intramural Office has kindly
provided us with singles tennis ladders. These are
posted in Ford Pavilion and run throughout the
year.
Although the sun is nice and warm, it makes
one sweat profusely. If this is undesirable, bil
liards or table tennis offer a cool, indoor alterna
tive.
If none of these can satisfy your athletic aspi
rations, chances are, you can probably organize a
new IM sport. The IM office is in Ford Pavilion.
