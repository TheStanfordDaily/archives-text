# Cardinal and Bruins lead Pac-10
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Since the Pacific 10 Con
ference began, women's volley
ball play in 1986, the battle for
first place has traditionally been
between Stanford and UCLA,
with the other teams fighting for
third.
This year is no different.
Once again, UCLA is ranked
No. 1 and Stanford is No. 2 in
both the conference and national
preseason polls. However, the
rest of the teams in the Pac-10
will not exactly be doormats for
the two traditional powerhouses.
Arizona State, USC, and
Oregon were all picked by
Volleyball Monthly magazine as
teams to watch, while Arizona

and Oregon State received votes
in the preseason national rank
ings.
1. UCLA (No. 1)
Everybody picks this team to
repeat as conference champions
â€” in fact, most predict that the
Bruins will win the NCAAs as
well. Looking at the UCLA line
up, it is easy to see why they look
so good.
Heading into Pac-10 play with
a 55-inatch conference winning
streak and ASICs Player of the
Year and Ail-American superstar
Natalie Williams, Bruins coach
Andy Banachowski has reason to
be confident about his chances to
repeat. Williams will team up
with Ail-Americans Jenny Evans
and Laurie Jones to make the

UCLA line-up one of the most
threatening in the country.
The Bruins fell to No. 3 last
week, however, after losing on
the road to Hawaii despite
Williams' Pac-10 record high 43
kills for the match (breaking the
old record of 41 held by our own
Bev Oden).
2. Stanford (No. 2)
3. Arizona State (No. 23)
Returning from a disappoint
ing 19-16 record last year, the
Sun Devils hope to make a dra
matic turnaround this year. No
longer plagued by injuries,
Arizona State is sporting a front
line that averages 6-1.
4. Oregon (No. 26)
The Ducks have made perhaps
the most dramatic improvement
over last year. With five senior
starters returning and one of the
best recruiting classes in history,
Oregon is sure to improve on last
year's 15-14 overall record (a dis
mal 6-12 in Pac-10 play).
5. USC (No. 18)
The Trojans have big shoes to
fill since last year's team posted a
disappointing 12-16 overall
record. With the loss of All-Pac
-10 players Lonise Norfleet and
Megan McAlister, USC will have
to rely much more on senior
Stephanie Bodision's .282 hitting
percentage to improve their con
ference record from last year's 9-
9 finish.
6. Washington State
With nine returning letter
men, at first glance the Cougars
would appear to have a good
chance at improving its 1990 6-
12 conference record. After a
good opening to the season, it
remains to be seen if Washington
State can play consistently well
every game.
The bright spot for WSU is the
return of star Carrie Couturier,
who led the Cougars with 42 solo
blocks and 259 digs last year and
was second in hitting percentage
at .268.
7. Arizona (No. 27)
Unfortunately for the Lady

'Cats, the University of Arizona's
recent basketball dominance has
not carried over to the volleyball
court. The team is off to a slow
start of 1-3, and the road will
only get harder with a series of
tough away games, beginning
with a conference opener against
Stanford.
8. Washington
The young Washington team is
still too young to make an impact
in the Pac-10, but they have
started well and will probably
improve as the season goes on.
Returning for the Huskies are
Dawn Austin, a member of the
All-Freshman Pac-10 team last
year, and setter Diane Flick, a
nominee for Pac-10 Player of the
Week two weeks ago.
9. California
The bad news for the Golden
Bears is that their greatest threat
at outside hitter, Lisa Arce, has
graduated and nobody has
stepped up to fill her shoes.
The only consolation for the
Golden Bears comes from re
turning middle blocker, Allison
Rennick, who should provide the
team with some great defense.
10. Oregon State (No. 31)
Coming off their best year ever
in 1990 (23-10, 11-7 in confer
ence), the Beavers have lost most
of their experience. Oregon State
lost four seniors and its coach at
the end of last season, and new
coach David Gantt and six new
comers to the team will be hard
pressed to duplicate their previ
ous success.
