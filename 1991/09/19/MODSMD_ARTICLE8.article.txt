# Cardinal and Bruins lead Pac-10
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Since the Pacific 10 Con
ference began, women's volley
ball play in 1986, the battle for
first place has traditionally been
between Stanford and UCLA,
with the other teams fighting for
third.
This year is no different.
Once again, UCLA is ranked
No. 1 and Stanford is No. 2 in
both the conference and national
preseason polls. However, the
rest of the teams in the Pac-10
will not exactly be doormats for
the two traditional powerhouses.
Arizona State, USC, and
Oregon were all picked by
Volleyball Monthly magazine as
teams to watch, while Arizona

and Oregon State received votes
in the preseason national rank
ings.
1. UCLA (No. 1)
Everybody picks this team to
repeat as conference champions
â€” in fact, most predict that the
Bruins will win the NCAAs as
well. Looking at the UCLA line
up, it is easy to see why they look
so good.
Heading into Pac-10 play with
a 55-inatch conference winning
streak and ASICs Player of the
Year and Ail-American superstar
Natalie Williams, Bruins coach
Andy Banachowski has reason to
be confident about his chances to
repeat. Williams will team up
with Ail-Americans Jenny Evans
and Laurie Jones to make the

UCLA line-up one of the most
threatening in the country.
The Bruins fell to No. 3 last
week, however, after losing on
the road to Hawaii despite
Williams' Pac-10 record high 43
kills for the match (breaking the
old record of 41 held by our own
Bev Oden).
2. Stanford (No. 2)
3. Arizona State (No. 23)
Returning from a disappoint
ing 19-16 record last year, the
Sun Devils hope to make a dra
matic turnaround this year. No
longer plagued by injuries,
Arizona State is sporting a front
line that averages 6-1.
