# Huskies look through rose-colored glasses again
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference has
always been considered one of the
toughest football conferences in the
country, and this year will be no differ
ent. Leading the pack should be the
Washington Huskies, last year's Rose
Bowl Champions by virtue of a 46-34
victory over Big 10 Conference champ
lowa.
Washington would have saved the AP
and UPI polls a lot of headache if it had
not been upset by UCLA in its last home
game, a setback that had no bearing on
the Pac-10 race, but effectively cost the
Huskies a certain (unshared) national
championship.
This year's Washington model
returns 16 starters and some think it
may be coach Don James' best. The
problem James and the rest of the con
ference coaches will have to worry about
is the parody that seems to mark every
Rose Bowl race.
UCLA was 5-6 last year, but beat
Washington. Oregon State was 1-10,
but beat Eagle Aloha Bowl invitee
Arizona fairly convincingly, 35-21.
Even Stanford got into the act, over
coming favored Copper Bowl bound
California 27-25 by recovering an
onside kick with 12 seconds left, and
kicking a field goal with no time left to
finish the year at 5-6.

These kinds of upsets will no doubt
be seen again this year, but still should
not effect Washington's chances to
repeat as conference champions. The
real competition should be to see who
finishes second and third. As Stanford
coach Denny Green says"the clear cut
favorite is Washington. It will be a flat
out dog race for the rest of the oppo
nents."

ARIZONA
The Wildcats have
appeared in consecu
tive bowl games, and
return 11 starters, but

overall youth and a tough schedule
could keep them from a third straight
post-season bid. The biggest disappoint
ment coach Dick Tomey had to face at
the start of the season was that running
back/kick returner Michael Bates would
not compete this season. Bates, a junior,
is the Pac-10 100-meter champion, and
will be training for a spot on the 1992
Olympic team.
Even with this loss, the win over
Stanford showed that Tomey has a
dependable backfield to compliment
agile quarterback George Malauulu (8-
for-15, 219 yards, 2 TD in the air; 58
yards 1 TD on the ground versus
Stanford). The real problem is a defense
that has seen much position switching
and will need to gel to put a strong sea
son together.

ARIZONA STATE
The Sun Devils return
16 starters, an even split
among offense and
defense, numbers that
give them some of the
best experience in the

conference. Returning receiving
star Eric Guilford is among the Pac-10's
best, but the question is whether quar
terback Bret Powers will be able to get
the ball to him consistently. Center
Toby Mills anchors an improved line
that will support a stable of fine running
backs, and the secondary is one of the
league's best.
The big question seems to be if coach
Larry Marmie can take a so-so 4-7 team
and make them any better. The rumor
mill has Marmie out if he does not pro
duce a major-bowl bid. The third year
coach has his work cut out for him.

CALIFORNIA
Last year's victory
over Wyoming in the I
Domino's Pizza Cop- 112
per Bowl was the j 1
Bear's first post-season
appearance since 1979,
and the program seems

to be on the upswing. Fourth year coach
Bruce Snyder is popular with the media
and fans, and is given most of the credit
for the Bear's recent resurgence.
The other reasons are junior tailback

Russell White and some nice scheduling.
White rushed for 1001 yards last year as
a back-up and is the focal point of a very
potent offense that has spent its first
two games on patsy non-conference
opponents. Unlike its bay area rival,
California's first two non-conference
games were University of the Pacific and
Purdue, not exactly the caliber teams
that Stanford will see against Colorado
and Notre Dame. The 2-0 start gave
White and talented quarterback Mike
Pawlawski a chance to highlight the
team's offensive strengths by outscoring
their opponents 128-42, but the Bears
have yet to have their questionable

defense tested.
OREGON
The Ducks are a
bowl team (Ana
heim Freedom) that
could make a
return trip in 1991. i
Oregon returns 14 J
starters, nine to a

defense that ranked second in the Pac-10
last year. The offense will highlight tal
ented tailback Sean Burwell, a sopho
more who rushed for 1022 yards last
year and is one of the league's rising
stars. Burwell rushed for 111 yards on
29 carries last weekend and is a threat
whenever he touches the ball.
The big question mark is at quarter
back, where redshirt freshman Dan

O'Neil has taken over. O'Neil was 19-
for-35, getting 292 yards in the Duck's
win over Texas Tech last weekend, but
will his lack of experience come into play
when Pac-10 play starts?

OREGON STATE
The Beavers return
17 starters, the most in /
the league, but it won't r
matter much. OSU was
bad last year (1-10), and
won't be much better

under new coach Jerry Pettibone.
Pettibone uses the spread offense, and it
should have at least partial successâ€”
OSU victories will be as spread out as
they always have been.

UCLA
The new wonder boy is

sophomore Tommy
Maddox, a budding
superstar who im
proved every week last

year and wound up leading the Pac-10
in total offense. His talents should be
enough to ensure UCLA of its first win
ning season in two years, but there is
some question about the running game.
15th-year coach Terry Donahue says he
wants to get back to the days of a 1000-
yard UCLA runner, and can't build his
offense solely around Maddox, but with






his running back talent it seems
strange for him to say that the
Bruins will have a 50-50 offensive
attack.

use
The upset win by
Memphis State aside,
the Trojans should
have another fine
year. Mario Royster
rushed for 1168

yards last year, and should anchor
the USC offense as soon as he gets
healthy. As it is now, the Trojans
have two Rodney Peete wanna-be's
in fleet-footed Reggie Perry and
Curtis Conway. Fullback Scott
Lockwood completes a fine run
ning game, but the big question
will be the two QB's.

WASHINGTON
Barring any i
kind of serious /
injury, the Hus-1
kies will proba-'
bly return to the
Rose Bowl again

this year. Washington has the
best Unebacking corps in the con

ference, led by the tenacious
Donald Jones. The 1990 Huskies
defense led the Pac-10 in every
catagory Igst year and could do so
again as they lack any major
defensive weaknesses. When
starting QB Mark Brunell went
down with a season-ending knee
injury, Washington lost their pre
season No. 1 ranking, but replace
ment Billy Joe Hobert showed in
the Stanford game that he will be
an able passer. Like last year, the
Huskies have the tools to chal
lenge for the national title.

WASHINGTON
STATE
The Cougars
have the nation's
best punter/kicker <
in Ail-American
Jason Hanson, but

he won't be enough to rescue the
team. The offensive line is a porous
group that gave up an unbelievable
47 sacks last year and could do the
same again this year. Drew Bledsoe
is a strong-armed QB who showed
flashes of brilliance last year, but
he may never have time to get the
ball to talented receiver Phillip
Bobo and pre-season All-Pac-10
tight end Clarence Williams. A
shaky defensive secondary will not
help matters.
