HOW WISC IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OVERSEAS PROGRAMS:
• Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later transcripts) directly
from an Oxford (or Cambridge) college.
• Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford college.
• Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence associated
with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully integrated with British students).
. Students accepted before November I (for the Winter Term) or before May 1
(for next year) are guaranteed housint- with Bntlril fftmkntfl
. Students will NOT be taught in (and receive transcripts from) an American
college operating in Oxford. WISC is one of the few completely integrated
(academically and in housing) overseas programs in the UK.
