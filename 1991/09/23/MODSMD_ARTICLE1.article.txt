# USW, University continuing talks
## Members meet today on strike question 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Contract negotiations between
the United Stanford Workers and
the University continued early
this morning as today's strike
deadline passed.
As of midnight, representa
tives from the union and Univer
sity bargaining teams had been
locked away in negotiations with
a federal mediator for more than
10 hours without a settlement.
The USW has a meeting sched
uled for 10 a.m. today. Members
will vote to decide whether to
strike, continue to work under a
temporary contract or accept a
proposal from the University.
The union had set a strike
deadline for today if a new con
tract was not reached. USW lead
ers hoped the threat of a strike
right before the Centennial Cele
bration would force the Universi

ty into concessions.
Barbara Butterfield, vice presi
dent of human resources, said the
University does have a contingen
cy plan in case of a strike because
it is "essential for the University
to continue to operate."
Butterfield said it would be
"inappropriate" to comment on
the plans because it would "foil
our own attempts" at negotia
tions.
But others within the adminis
tration say it is likely many recent
alumni in the area as well as out
side vendors would be used to
replace striking workers and
avert a Centennial catastrophe.
Union officials said they were
aware the University had a con
tingency plan but were not overly
concerned.
Lon Warneke, a member of the
USW media committee and a
senior engineer at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center,
explained that the union has
strike plans of their own but
declined to elaborate on details.
Before the beginning of yester
day's meeting, neither side would
speculate whether a settlement
might be reached.
Warneke said negotiations
were "not at a stalemate" but
declined to predict whether the
union would strike today.
Michael Vartain, the Universi
ty's chief negotiator, said it was
"hard to tell" whether a settle
ment might be reached.
The University called in
Clarence Washington from the
Federal Mediation and Concilia
tion Service for Friday's negotiat
ing session. Representatives from
the agency have worked with both
sides in past contract negotiations.
The union refused to accept a
federal mediator in the negotia
tions until Thursday, according
to Vartain.
