# Research library releases scrolls

SAN MARINO, Calif. (AP) - A
prestigious research library dis
missed warnings by Israel and
opened its microfilm record of the
Dead Sea Scrolls yesterday,
declaring its action a blow for aca
demic freedom.
"When you free the scrolls, you
free the scholars," said William
Moffett, director of the
Huntington Library. "If we had
sat quietly we would have violated
our own policy of unrestricted
access."
Israel warned the library
Sunday not to open its microfilm
record of the scrolls, siding with
the few researchers who have con
trolled the ancient Jewish records
for four decades.
Amir Drori, director of the
Antiquities Authority, said easing
access to the records would violate
the contract under which the 800
scroll fragments were photog
raphed in 1980. The pictures were
taken as a safeguard against the
possibility of the scrolls being
damaged or destroyed.
Moffett told a news conference
at the library that he had received
a facsimile message from Israeli
authorities, but he declined to
elaborate. He did say there was no
legal ground for blocking access to
the material.
"We are not set up to be a rival
of the Department of Antiquities,"
he said. "We are not in the pub
lishing business."
Moffett also questioned wheth

er anyone had a legitimate claim
over access to the Dead Sea
Scrolls. He noted that the scrolls
were found beginning in 1947 in
territory not occupied by Israel
until the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Moffett said the release effec
tively broke the "monopoly" of
scholars authorized to study the
scroll fragments.
"The difference is that we don't
require a litmus test to see if you
are in the club or out of the club,"
he said. "I can't think of a better
way to puncture the paranoia
than to declare that the monopoly
is at an end."
The Huntington's plan elated
scholars who contend vital histor
ical documents should be widely
available. But scholars who have
devoted years to translating the
scrolls expressed anger, saying
their work was being stolen.
The animal-skin scrolls were
found in caves near the Dead Sea
between 1947 and the early 19505.
They are stored at the Rockefeller
Museum in Jerusalem under the
control of the Antiquities
Authority.
The work of a Jewish sect dur
ing the time of Jesus, the scrolls
contain the oldest known version
of the Old Testament, biblical
writings and invaluable informa
tion about the beginnings of
Christianity and modern Judaism.
The photographs were given to
several foreign institutions with
the "written understanding that

they would not be allowed to use
them without our agreement,"
Drori said.
Scholars and academics have
long complained that access to the
scrolls has been too limited and
publication too slow. They say
only 300 scrolls have been pub
lished and access to the other 500
has been limited to a small group
of scholars with exclusive autho
rization from Israel to assemble,
translate and publish the scrolls'
texts.
However, Drori said any schol
ar wishing to see unpublished
material need only obtain permis
sion through the proper channels.
He also estimated that 80 per
cent of the scrolls have been pub
lished.
The Antiquities Authority has
40 researchers working to publish
the remaining 20 percent by the
end of 1997. Some of the material
is already at the printing stage,
and some is nearly completely
edited, Drori said.
He said early publication was
unethical because only those
scholars who dedicated years to
deciphering the fragments should
have first rights to release the
material.
Unrestricted access also could
create misunderstandings as each
scholar prints only what he under
stands, he said.
"If we return to the law of the
jungle, the result will be a jungle,"
Drori said.
