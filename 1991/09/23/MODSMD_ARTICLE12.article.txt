# Anti-government protesters increase attacks in Soviet Georgia

MOSCOW (AP) - Maverick
troops and armed opponents of
Georgian President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia seized a govern
ment broadcast station yesterday
in a widening conflict the presi
dent is calling a coup attempt.
Gamsakhurdia reportedly met
with a parliamentary opposition
leader later yesterday in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi to try
to end the conflict that has left at
least 41 people injured.
But he also kept up appeals
over a clandestine TV station for
supporters to defend him against
"the pseudo-opposition that is
preparing an attack on parlia
ment and the legally elected gov
ernment," the Georgian mission
in Moscow reported.
Anti-government protesters
have maintained non-stop vigils
during the unrest, the most
severe since a failed hard-line
Kremlin coup unleashed political
and nationalist passions across
the country.
Gamsakhurdia is accused by
opponents of adopting dictatorial
methods since his landslide vic
tory last summer as the southern
republic's first elected president.
His supporters like his forceful
style and strong push for inde
pendence for their multi-ethnic
republic of 5.5 million people.
Opposition to Gamsakhurdia
began to grow after government
troops on Sept. 2 wounded five
protesters. The president denies

giving an order to shoot and has
opened an investigation in which
he says one policeman already
has been detained.
On Sunday, an anti-govern
ment demonstrator died a day
after setting himself on fire,
according to Georgian reporters
Georgy Vardzelashvili and
Tamara Chkheidze.
"If Georgia needs a victim to
stop the bloodshed, I am ready to
sacrifice myself," Vardzelashvili
quoted the unidentified man as
saying before immolating him
self.
More than 10,000 people
swarmed down Rustaveli Avenue
toward the president's office in
front of opposition party head
quarters to demand the presi
dent resign. At the same time,
smaller groups of Gamsakhurdia
supporters rallied in defense of
the president.
The state news agency Tass
also said 41 people were hospital
ized as of Sunday. The injured
were nearly all hunger strikers
beaten Saturday by police in
front of Gamaskhurdia's office in
Government House.
Irina Sarishvili, a leader of the
National Democratic Party, had
been among those reported
injured in the melee, but she
showed up to lead demonstra
tions at the broadcast center
Sunday, Vardzelashvili said.
Former Georgian Prime Min

ister Tengiz Sequa, now the lead
ing figure in the anti-govern
ment movement, entered the
radio and TV center with about
200 protesters, said government
spokeswoman Khatia Jinjikhad
ze.
They were later joined by
members of the Georgian Nation
al Guard, commanded by Gen.
Tenghiz Kitovani. Thegeneral,
who broke with Gamsakhurdia
after the failed coup last month,
has vowed to stop government
troops from attacking civilians.
Prime Minister Bessarion
Gugushvili promised Kitovani
and his guardsmen immunity
from prosecution if they surren
dered from the broadcast station.
But the dissidents remained
holed up in the building.
However, Gamsakhurdia's
police forces still control the TV
tower atop a mountain in the
city, preventing opposition trans
missions.
Lawmaker Merab Uridiye, who
was in the studio, said the opposi
tion is demanding Gamsakhurdia
allow live TV broadcasts of
Georgia's parliament, which has
been unable to hold a session
since Sept. 2 without breaking
apart.
Gamsakhurdia led the parlia
ment last Sunday in voting to cut
live transmissions, saying debates
would inflame the situation in the
republic.
