## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Editor's Welcome 
### 
An Independent Newspaper
Published Since 1892

Nothing tests values
like a crisis does — especial
ly when money is involved.
Last year was a time of crisis for
Stanford. But that story is far
from over. Now that the Universi
ty must slash $40 million from its
operating budget in the next three
years, the decision-makers will be
forced to "put their money where
their mouth is."
The difficulty lies in finding
that mouth.
Do we value need-blind financial
aid and the socioeconomic diversi
ty it helps create? How important
is breadth of departments and ser
vices in Stanford's quest for excel
lence? How feasible is that when
funds are short?
Anyone who cares about any
thing that costs money has cause
to worry about the road ahead.
Brace yourselves for the budget
ax. Life won't be as cushy and con
venient as it has been. People we
like and rely on will lose their jobs.
Things that matter to you might
not be so important to the next
guy. But the tough decisions have
to be made.
Crisis is the stuff of life to jour
nalists. Daily reporters and editors
are no exception. Much of our cov
erage this year will explore how
these decisions are being made and
— more importantly — how they
will change lives.
We'll be watching how the bud
get crisis affects community val
ues. And we'll be shaping and
upholding our own sense of what is
important in the process.
These secret motivations of The
Stanford Daily staff are a common
lunch table topic. I have been told
that Daily staffers are mindless
liberal yahoos. I have also been
told that we're pig-headed conser
vatives.
I've never really been able to
decide for myself which is more
accurate; the truth is probably
somewhere in between — but
those aren't really the values that
speak from the pages you're hold
ing.
The best way to understand us
is to look at our product. What is in

front of you is the collaborative
effort of an honest, hard-working
and responsible group of people
committed to producing an intelli
gent, informative paper five days a
week.
Editors work almost around the
clock to provide fair and accurate
coverage of the Stanford commu
nity — and most of them are tak
ing a full load of classes.
I selected these people from a
pool of applicants because their
intelligence, thoughtfulness, dili
gence and commitment impressed
me.
We're also financially indepen
dent from the University and the
ASSU — which means what you
read is what we think is important,
and not what they want you to
hear.
You can count on today's, and
every day's paper this volume to
reflect this ethic. We will report on
your lives accurately, with sensitiv
ity and creativity.
You are the reason we're here.
Now, more than perhaps any other
time in University history, we will
all need to work together to weath
er the storm. We want to know
what sort of University you think
Stanford should be.
Let us know when you're upset.
Tell us when something important
is happening to you. Chastise us
when we make a mistake. We're
always eager to correct our errors,
just as we're happy to share our
decision-making process with any
one who is interested. And if you
see something you like, we'd love
to hear about it.
Times are tough at Stanford.
The University will be forced to do
a lot of soul-searching as priorities
receive price tags.
In much the same way, my own
patience and stamina will be tried
every day as I struggle with my
staff to produce The Daily and to
accept the ups and downs that go
with the territory.
Let me know how we're doing.
