## Thomas no Thurgood Marshall 
### 
The following is the opening statement
from Stanford Law Prof. Charles
Lawrence's testimony to the Senate Judi
ciary Committee last week on Judge
Clarence Thomas' nomination to the
Supreme Court.
IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE ang
uish that I come before this commit
tee to oppose the confirmation of
Judge Clarence Thomas. No one who has
himself experienced the headwinds of
American racism can easily oppose an
individual who has traveled the same
buffeted road. No one who has been par
ticipant and witness to the courageous
struggles that have opened doors so long
closed to us is anxious to say that one of
our own should not pass through one of
those doors. But after a long and careful
consideration of Judge Thomas' record as
a public official, after listening to his tes
timony before this committee, I find I
must oppose him.
When Judge Thomas made his open
ing statement before this committee, he
invoked the legacy of Justice Thurgood
Marshall. He said, "Justice Marshall,
whose seat I have been nominated to fill,
is one of those who had the courage and
the intellect ... to knock down barriers
that seemed so insurmountable." When I
heard that invocation, I wanted to believe
that he knew what it meant to stand on
the shoulders of this great champion of
racial justice, that he was an individual
with the acuity of intellect, the integrity
and the strength of character to carry on
the monumental vocation that was Jus
tice Marshall's. I know that millions of
Black Americans shared this longing.

Justice Marshall was our first and
only voice on the nation's highest court.
In the judicial conference room, on the
pages of the Supreme Court Reports and
in the public discourse, we counted on
him to make our story heard. On a court
increasingly insensitive to the plight of
those denied the full fruits of citizen
ship, he was also a voice for women, for
gays and lesbians, for the poor and for
other minorities. This is Justice Mar
shall's legacy. And those of us who
believe in the court's special role as
guardian of those without political voice
must do more than hope and trust in
Judge Thomas' invocation of that lega
cy.
Judge Thomas has told us of his hum
ble beginnings, of his own experience
with the humiliation of segregation and
racial denigration. He has assured us
that he will not forget those beginnings,
those experiences of shame. I am certain
that he will not. But we must ask anoth
er question: What has Clarence Thomas
done with this experience? By what path
has he come from those humble begin
nings to the threshold of the Supreme
Court?
Thurgood Marshall chose the path of
leadership within his own community,
of legal advocacy on behalf of those who
were least powerful, of constant chal
lenge to the institutions and politicians
who exploited race and poverty. His way
was to speak truth to power. Judge
Thomas has come to this crossroad by a
very different route. His choice was to
serve those who are most powerful in
this society and he has served them well.
The President has nominated Judge

Thomas to the Supreme Court precisely
because he has proven his willingness to
advance the ideology of his patrons
without dissent. He has demonstrated
his loyalty as an administration foot sol
dier. One cannot help but wonder what
this history of accommodation has done
to Clarence Thomas' character. It is
somehow not surprising that we have
heard him, in the course of these hear
ings, disavow so much of what he has
said before.
This is a political nomination. Let
there be no mistake about that. The
framers anticipated this inevitability
and gave to the Senate the job of check
ing the president's power to make a
Supreme Court in his own image. This
president is determined to do just that;
to push the Court even more solidly to
the ideological right than it already is.
When this is so, it is especially impor
tant that the Senate not shirk its
responsibility in the process. It is your
duty to insure that there remains on the
court some meaningful diversity of judi
cial philosophy and political orientation,
that there remains some voice for those
whose voices too often go unheard.
It is your duty to reject this nomina
tion and reject each nominee that follows
until you are assured that this new Jus
tice will stand against the Court's cur
rent assault on Roe v. Wade, Brown v.
Board of Education and Griggs v. Duke
Power. It is not enough to guess, to hope,
or even to pray, as I have, that if con
firmed, Judge Thomas will grow and
change. It is your responsibility to insure
the American people that the legacy of
Justice Marshall will live on.
