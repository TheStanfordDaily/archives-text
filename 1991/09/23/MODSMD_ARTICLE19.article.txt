To help ease the culture shock
many new students experience
when they first arrive at Stan
ford, the ethnic Orientation orga
nizations and the ASSU launched
a new concept Friday night —
"Stan fordopoiy."
Held in Lagunita Courtyard,
the goal of this life-sized version
of Stanford Monopoly was to calm
the fears of new students and
expose them to different cultures.
From late-night dancing on the
"Free Parking" dance floor to dig
ging into the "Community Chest"
booth for various prizes, students
experienced new twists on an old
favorite.
Each of the different ethnic
booths around the courtyard con
tinued the Stanford tradition of
exposing students to flavorful
aspects of various traditions. For
example, the Asian American
New Student Orientation Com
mittee booth featured the Filipino
national dance called tininkling.
The dance articulately illustrates

a bird's escape from a farmer's
trap.
The Native American Orienta
tion Committee's activities in
cluded "pinning the tail on the
buffalo," while the Black Recruit
ment and Orientation Committee
hosted a "Soul Train Through the
Decades," which included some
favorite songs from the 1960s
through the 19905.
The Chicano/Latino Orienta
tion Committee held Latin
dances, a grito contest in which
the loudest and best screamer
won and a pinata event that
ended sweetly for everyone.
The ASSU invited students to
play "Twister," taxing their abili
ty to become completely contorted
while keeping their balance. They
also held a Community Chest raf
fle that rewarded students who
visited every booth.
Many students, particularly
freshmen, said the new event was
a success. "I've met 50 people
here so far and love every one of
them," said freshman Jeff Wur
gler.
