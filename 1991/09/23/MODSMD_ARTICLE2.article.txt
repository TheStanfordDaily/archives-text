# Looming cuts keep faculty up at night

Although no one knows how
big the cuts will be, administra
tors and faculty say they are con
cerned about the effect of the
budget crisis on the quality of
education at Stanford.
Four weeks from now, Uni
versity budget-planners will
announce targets for individual
schools and administrative units
as they seek to slash Stanford's
$400 million operational budget
by approximately $40 million.
"This is a real problem that
won't go away without real and
tough decisions," said Sally
Mahoney, acting vice president
for student resources, at an open
student forum on the budget Fri
day. "It won't be solved by
marginal belt-tightening."
All academic and administra

tive bodies within the University
submitted proposals discussing
ways of reducing expenses.
Schools considered cuts in the
range of 7 to 13 percent, and
administrative units proposed
reducing their areas by 15 to 21
percent.
"Cuts at the larger end (of the
target ranges) would be severe for
just about everybody," said
Charles Kruger, deputy chair of
the Cabinet Committee on Bud
get and Strategic Planning. "But
I believe that we can find an equi
librium without sacrificing quali
ty," Kruger added. "It is possible
for the University to be smaller
and maintain its excellence."
Still, the upcoming cuts are
certain to affect students. Chem
istry Prof. Richard Zare, chair of
the Faculty Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford, warned students at last
week's forum that the cuts will
inevitably hurt some people.
"When you cut, it is pain," Zare
said. "Everything here last year
was here because it was consid
ered to be good.
"Now we must choose among
various good things and rank
them to produce a leaner Stan
ford," he added.
The proposals were the focus of
the recent cabinet retreat attend
ed by members of both budget
committees designed "to get the
information out and discuss alter
natives," said University Budget
Director Tim Warner.
Warner said the reduction tar
gets considered by the schools and
administrative areas were only
estimates. The final targets will
be set by the cabinet at a special
meeting Oct. 17, ironically the
second anniversary of the Loma

Prieta Earthquake, the damage
from which accounts for a large
part of the current budget short
fall.
The University has declined to
release the details of the budget
cutting proposals because they
were speculative and will likely
change before any cuts are actual
ly made.
But even the preliminary
reduction discussions have many
people worried within both the
academic and administrative
areas of the University.
Ewart Thomas, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said
considering budget cuts has been
a "sobering experience" that has
brought him to the realization
that they "must involve valuable
programs."
Thomas said there are several
strategies his school might
employ to decide what to elimi
nate:
• Cut whole departments;
• Cut areas where faculty agree
reductions can be made, such as
subdisciplines within depart
ments;

• Cut positions where there is a
consensus that doing so will not
damage research or teaching; and
• Try to "squeeze more teach
ing" out of those who teach less
than other faculty.
Whatever principle is used will
be determined by the targets set
by the cabinet committee, and
specific cuts will depend on "their
quality and centrality relative to
the core mission of the University
and their financial impact," he
explained.
Thomas said even a 7 percent
cut would require more than
marginal across-the-board cuts,
and 13 percent would be
"fatal."
"We could make a 7 percent cut
without education suffering,"
Thomas said. "We would still be
able to guarantee a superior edu
cation, although it would not look
the same because there would be
fewer academic choices."
Although the schools will likely
survive cuts of less than 10 per
cent relatively intact, budget
planners within administrative
units — having just survived the

$22-million, 18-month adminis
trative repositioning effort — are
more concerned.
Frederick Biedenweg, assistant
vice president for strategic plan
ning and financial management
in Libraries and Information
Resources, said the last round of
cuts already hurt his administra
tive area.
"We really busted ourselves to
make the cuts in a manner to
lessen the impact on faculty, stu
dents and staff," Biedenweg said.
"This next round of cuts will defi
nitely have an impact."
To make future cuts, Bieden
weg said Libraries and Informa
tion Resources will try to "reduce
administrative layers while trying
to minimize layoffs." Attrition
and shifting staff to unfilled posi
tions would be the "least painful
method of layoffs," he added.
Biedenweg said the hiring
freeze — or "limited hires" as the
University has called it — will
also reduce the number of stu
dents hired to staff the libraries
and the Tresidder and Meyer
library computer clusters.
