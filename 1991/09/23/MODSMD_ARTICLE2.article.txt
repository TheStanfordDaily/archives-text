Although no one knows how
big the cuts will be, administra
tors and faculty say they are con
cerned about the effect of the
budget crisis on the quality of
education at Stanford.
Four weeks from now, Uni
versity budget-planners will
announce targets for individual
schools and administrative units
as they seek to slash Stanford's
$400 million operational budget
by approximately $40 million.
"This is a real problem that
won't go away without real and
tough decisions," said Sally
Mahoney, acting vice president
for student resources, at an open
student forum on the budget Fri
day. "It won't be solved by
marginal belt-tightening."
All academic and administra

tive bodies within the University
submitted proposals discussing
ways of reducing expenses.
Schools considered cuts in the
range of 7 to 13 percent, and
administrative units proposed
reducing their areas by 15 to 21
percent.
"Cuts at the larger end (of the
target ranges) would be severe for
just about everybody," said
Charles Kruger, deputy chair of
the Cabinet Committee on Bud
get and Strategic Planning. "But
I believe that we can find an equi
librium without sacrificing quali
ty," Kruger added. "It is possible
for the University to be smaller
and maintain its excellence."
Still, the upcoming cuts are
certain to affect students. Chem
