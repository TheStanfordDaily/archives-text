# Stanford, Westin drop plans for hotel
## 
### Steve McCarroll Staff writer 
Stanford University has ended negotiations
with the Westin Hotel Co. to build a high-qual
ity conference hotel on campus, but Stanford
officials will pursue the project with other cor
porations.
The Westin proposal, which called for con
struction on a 21-acre site at the intersection
of Interstate 280 and Sand Hill Road, was
scrapped when Westin officials voiced an
intention to reduce the plan's scale.
"Changes in the real estate market appear

to have caused the company to suggest a less
er project than it had proposed in 1989," wrote
Stanford director of real estate development
Niel Davidson in a letter to Menlo Park city
manager Jan Dolan.
"We regretfully concluded that we could
not accept the reduced version, which would
have altered several valuable features of the
hotel," he wrote.
Among the amenities dropped in Westin's
scaled-back proposal were plans for an indoor
pool and a fine restaurant. The revision also
called for smaller rooms, which Stanford offi
cials feared would lower the hotel's quality.

Westin originally proposed a 387-room con
ference hotel in 1988. But development was
held up for several years as the city of Menlo
Park completed the revision of its General
Plan, detailing plans for traffic flow, revenue
and environmental impact.
Real estate values declined in 1990, causing
the international hotel magnate to re-assess
its plans.
Stanford Community Relations Director
Andrew Doty called the news "a setback"
because the University will have to start any new
project from scratch, finding another corporate
partner and developing architectural plans.
