# Orientation program addresses rape, intimacy
## 
### Andy Dworkin 
When freshman Michael
Richard heard about a program
called "Sex in the '905," he
thought it sounded "hot." But
when he attended yesterday
afternoon's workshop on inti
macy and rape, he was confront
ed with something "totally dif
ferent" from what he had
expected.
"It was completely serious," he
said, adding he felt the topic of
rape was an important one.
As part of New Student Orien

tation, freshmen and transfers
packed Memorial Auditorium yes
terday to attend "Sex in the '90s:
Communication, Intimacy and
Power," a presentation focusing
on the relationship between popu
lar culture, sex and rape.
Susan Epstein, Coordinator of
Sexual Assault Prevention Educa
tion and Referral Resources and
an organizer of the event, said the
presentation was "a program
about viewing sex, communica
tion, power and intimacy in a dif
ferent way."
The presentation, held in

Memorial Auditorium, included a
photo montage of media images
involving sex, communication and
dominance followed by a six-ques
tion "quiz" on media images of
men and women and on rape. A
panel of former and current Stan
ford faculty, students and admin
istrators then spoke about the
dynamics of relationships and
rape.
The program also contained
readings from statements rape
victims had made about their own
experiences and a discussion of
what constitutes rape. A movie

depicting a situation in which
date rape occurs and how to pre
vent a rape in a similar situation
followed, as did information on
rape support and counseling
groups in the Stanford area.
Epstein, a recent graduate,
said the focus of the program was
more on education than on pre
vention.
"I thought it was pretty infor
mative," said Sandra Lin, a fresh
man. "These days, schools are
getting much better about bring
ing attention to this subject, but
it's good to reinforce it."
