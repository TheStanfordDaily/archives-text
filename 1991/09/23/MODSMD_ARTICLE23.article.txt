Kennedy to step down
University President Donald
Kennedy announced his resigna
tion June 29, effective August
1992.
Kennedy, who is in his 11th
year as Stanford's president, said
he was not pressured to resign,
but believed his stepping down
"would make it easier for Stanford
to make the changes it needs to
make."
Throughout the indirect-cost
controversy, Kennedy, 59, had
insisted he would lead the Univer
sity's reform effort and would not
resign. But he said his thinking
shifted during the six weeks prior
to his resignation.
"It is very difficult, I have con
cluded, for a person identified
with a problem to be the
spokesman for its solution," he
said.
Fellow administrators praised
Kennedy's accomplishments and
called his decision to resign coura
geous. "I think he's expressing the
leadership we've come to expect,"
said Provost James Rosse. "The
decision was . . . based on his
assessment of what was best for
the University."

Kennedy said he wants to
return to teaching and hopes to
"help make Stanford the universi
ty of academic and policy studies"
in environmental concerns.
Board of Trustees President
James Gaither will appoint a com
mittee, composed primarily of fac
ulty and trustees, to identify the
University's next president by the
spring or summer of 1992.
Admissions dean chosen
Jim Montoya, a 1975 Stanford
graduate and dean of student life
at Vassar College, was chosen in
July to replace "Dean Jean" Fet
ter as the University's dean of
admissions.
Montoya, who majored in
Spanish with a focus on Latin
American culture, also earned a
graduate degree in Administra
tion and Policy Analysis from the
School of Education in 1978.
The San Jose native received
the Dinkelspiel Award for scholar
ly attainment and outstanding
service to undergraduate students
in 1975.
Montoya has served as director
of admissions at Vassar and at
Occidental College, where he was

also director of residence and asso
ciate dean of students.
He praised the Stanford admis
sions staff, saying, "I have the lux
ury of moving into an admissions
office with an extraordinary staff
that will make the transition
smoother."
Montoya said he believes the
University should stand firm on
the issue of need-blind admissions
in the face of the current budget
crisis.
Conley returns
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
Conley, after resigning her
tenured post in June because of
what she called pervasive sexism
in the School of Medicine,
returned to her position two
weeks ago.
Encouraged by Stanford's first
steps toward reform, Conley said
she believes she can change the
University more from the inside
than from the outside.
Conley resigned after Prof.
Gerald Silverberg was promoted
last spring from acting to perma
nent chair of the Neurosurgery
