# Tension, resignation highlight summer on Farm

### 
Kennedy to step down
University President Donald
Kennedy announced his resigna
tion June 29, effective August
1992.
Kennedy, who is in his 11th
year as Stanford's president, said
he was not pressured to resign,
but believed his stepping down
"would make it easier for Stanford
to make the changes it needs to
make."
Throughout the indirect-cost
controversy, Kennedy, 59, had
insisted he would lead the Univer
sity's reform effort and would not
resign. But he said his thinking
shifted during the six weeks prior
to his resignation.
"It is very difficult, I have con
cluded, for a person identified
with a problem to be the
spokesman for its solution," he
said.
Fellow administrators praised
Kennedy's accomplishments and
called his decision to resign coura
geous. "I think he's expressing the
leadership we've come to expect,"
said Provost James Rosse. "The
decision was . . . based on his
assessment of what was best for
the University."

Kennedy said he wants to
return to teaching and hopes to
"help make Stanford the universi
ty of academic and policy studies"
in environmental concerns.
Board of Trustees President
James Gaither will appoint a com
mittee, composed primarily of fac
ulty and trustees, to identify the
University's next president by the
spring or summer of 1992.
Admissions dean chosen
Jim Montoya, a 1975 Stanford
graduate and dean of student life
at Vassar College, was chosen in
July to replace "Dean Jean" Fet
ter as the University's dean of
admissions.
Montoya, who majored in
Spanish with a focus on Latin
American culture, also earned a
graduate degree in Administra
tion and Policy Analysis from the
School of Education in 1978.
The San Jose native received
the Dinkelspiel Award for scholar
ly attainment and outstanding
service to undergraduate students
in 1975.
Montoya has served as director
of admissions at Vassar and at
Occidental College, where he was

also director of residence and asso
ciate dean of students.
He praised the Stanford admis
sions staff, saying, "I have the lux
ury of moving into an admissions
office with an extraordinary staff
that will make the transition
smoother."
Montoya said he believes the
University should stand firm on
the issue of need-blind admissions
in the face of the current budget
crisis.
Conley returns
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
Conley, after resigning her
tenured post in June because of
what she called pervasive sexism
in the School of Medicine,
returned to her position two
weeks ago.
Encouraged by Stanford's first
steps toward reform, Conley said
she believes she can change the
University more from the inside
than from the outside.
Conley resigned after Prof.
Gerald Silverberg was promoted
last spring from acting to perma
nent chair of the Neurosurgery

department.
"He devalues women and, for
that matter, anyone who he per
ceives to be his inferior," she said
last spring.
After resigning, Conley wrote a
pointed opinion piece that
appeared in newspapers nation
wide. It described repeated inci
dents of subtle sexism, including
unsolicited fondling and sexist
remarks, that made Stanford a
"very hostile environment."
New financial officer,
controller appointed
With his recent announcement
that he will leave his position Oct.
1, Controller Frank Riddle became
the second senior financial official
to resign in the wake of the feder
al government's investigations of
the University's indirect-cost poli
cies.
In a letter to University offi
cials dated Sept. 6, Riddle said his
resignation was "not a direct
result of the situation with the
federal government... . although
the financial impact certainly has
played a part in my decision."
Earlier this summer in a long
anticipated move, Chief Financial
Officer William Massy stepped
down from his post. Peter Van
Etten was appointed to the posi
tion.
As the new CFO, Van Etten
said he is looking to improve Stan
ford's reputation by strengthen
ing its accounting system. Reform
will be costly, however. Van Etten
estimates the price tag on the
changes to be "several million"

dollars.
While a search is conducted,
Joanne Coville, assistant con
troller for financial informa
tion and reporting, has been
named acting controller, effec
tive Oct. 1.
The controller's responsibili
ties include serving as the Univer

sity's chief negotiator for indirect
costs and tracking all University
funds, including the $2 billion
endowment.
The federal government has
accused the University of over
charging taxpayers by nearly $180
million in indirect research costs
and is seeking compensation.

Budget crisis looms
University budget-planners
have been "working like hell all
summer" to solve Stanford's cur
rent financial crisis, according to
University Budget Director Tim
Warner.
Since Provost James Rosse

announced last May that the Uni
versity would have to slash
approximately 10 percent of its
operating budget, Warner and his
staff have been trying to establish
exactly what next year's budget
deficit will be.
All administrative units and
the seven schools designed propos
als over the summer suggesting
methods of cutting their individu
al budgets.
These budget-reduction plans
were examined at a University
cabinet retreat 10 days ago.
The Faculty Senate Committee
on Education and Scholarship at
Stanford also prepared a report
over the summer listing guidelines
and general priorities for making
future budget cuts.
But all of this work is only the
beginning, as the Cabinet Commit
tee on Budget and Strategic Plan
ning will set reduction targets next
month, and ways to make cuts will
be debated by the University in the
upcoming year.
Demolition delayed
A series of court orders halted
the University's plan to demolish
Synergy and the Delta Tau Delta
house.
Judge Read Ambler of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court issued a temporary
restraining order August 22, halt
ing the demolition of the buildings
just as it was beginning.
Ambler revoked the Universi
ty's demolition permit three weeks
later, ruling that it had been
obtained illegally. The University
has not obtained another permit.
The Committee for the Preser
vation of Historic Stanford, a

handful of staff and alumni that
has successfully opposed the Uni
versity's demolition plans, main
tains the turn-of-the-century resi
dences are historically and archi
tecturally significant.
In a related development, the
University announced that it will
study the possibility of saving the
Phi Psi house, rather than
destroying it as planned.
The University decided in Jan
uary to replace the earthquake
damaged student residences with
revenue-generating faculty hous
ing. Under the plan, the revenue
would be used to finance the con
struction of more student housing
elsewhere on campus.
Stanford Planning Director
Phil Williams estimates that
repairing the houses would cost
$1.5 million. The committee dis
putes that figure.
Med school loses staff
The School of Medicine began
laying off workers Sept. 1, one
month after the school announced
a six-year budget-cutting plan to
meet a deficit of nearly $80 mil
lion. »
As part of the plan, 20 adminis
trative staff positions were elimi
nated, which represents 16 per
cent of the work force of the
school's central administrative
services.
Most of the layoffs took effect
Sept. 1, but a few will be staggered
throughout the academic year. All
layoffs will be completed by the
end of August 1992.
