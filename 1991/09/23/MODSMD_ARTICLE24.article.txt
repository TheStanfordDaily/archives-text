# FARM FRESH
## 
### 
* Vou may not realize it now,
but you'll spend the rest of
ยง your Stanford career wishing
you were a new student again.
You 11 reminisce about
Orientation. About the first time
you saw The Tree. About that crazy
game of Stanfordopoly. About
MuFuUnSun. About following The
Band around campus. About
getting lost.
Yes, one day you'll even look
back and laugh, "Was there ever a
time I didn't know when to jump
in 'All Right Now'?"

Clockwise from top left:
Freshmen flip a Frisbee in
deGuerre; two women scan the
froshbook at the airport; the
Kimball Hall welcoming crew
goes to bat for new students; a
little water music in deGuerre;
Muffy Davis square dances on
wheels; a student shows his steps
at Stanfordopoly.
