### George Malone Staff writer 
Sometimes when you're playing a lit
tle sluggishly, all you need to wake you
up is a good slap in the face.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team got just that at Burnham Pavilion
on Saturday night from Arizona State
as the Cardinal lost the first game of the
match in rude fashion, 15-3, after hav
ing an easy three-game sweep of
Arizona the night before.

"We were sluggish, and we got ham
mered," Coach Don Shaw.
Arizona State's victory woke
Stanford up, however, and the Cardinal
regained its poise, tightened its defense,
and cruised through the next three
games, 15-3, 15-8, 15-6, to win the
match.
The night before, Stanford barely
had to stir to sweep Arizona 15-9, 15-4,
15-6 in the Cardinal's Pacific 10
Conference and home opener before a
huge crowd at Burnham Pavilion.
The Stanford women were a little
nervous in the first game, playing in
front of the home crowd for the first
time, and Arizona took a 3-0 lead, but
the No. 1 ranked Cardinal quickly
regained their poise and dominated the
remainder of the match.
Coach Shaw was not surprised with
his team's lethargic play.
"After ten days of practice and not
playing since Texas, we were a little
sloppy — we were a step slow defensive
ly, but I expected that. I was pleased
with our offense — there weren't a lot of
mistakes," Shaw said.
In fact, the Cardinal had a tremen
dous .342 hitting percentage for the
match as a whole, while Arizona only hit
.151.
The enthusiastic crowd for the home
opener gave the Cardinal an extra lift.
"It was so key to have the crowd and
the Band," junior Jennifer Jackson said.
Jackson had another great game for
Stanford, with 11 kills and .421 hitting
percentage.
Senior captain Kristin Klein, who hit
.333 for the match, continued to make
her mark on the Cardinal women's vol

leyball record books as she scored 11
kills for the match, giving her 1475 for
her career.
With her second kill of the night, she
passed Teresa Smith to become second
place in school history in kills behind
Kim Oden's 1751.
The next night against Arizona State,
Stanford started sluggishly again and
paid for it as the Lady Sun Devils
pounced all over the Cardinal in the first
game, winning handily at 15-3.
Stanford seemed tentative, not com
municating and making unforced
errors. In addition, Arizona State was
either digging or blocking almost every
ball, shutting down Stanford's potent
offense.
"I looked up and it was 10-1," senior
Amy Cooper said.
"We didn't come out ready to play,
and they did," said athletic junior Kathy
Jurgens.
"[Arizona State's victory] was just
what the doctor ordered — to get
slapped in the face. . .They are always
real fired up to play and they just came
out and played well," Coach Shaw said.
Was the No.l team in the nation rat
tled?
"We knew we were a stronger team
— we just had to play that way. I want
to give them some credit, though. They
came out strong," junior Bev Oden said.
"We weren't worried because we
knew that Arizona State was playing
their best. I didn't expect them to play
any better, and I knew that if we raised
our level we'd win," said Shaw.
That's exactly what happened. The
teams switched sides for the second
game, and Stanford regrouped and came
out and played up to their ranking.
"In the second game we were a differ
ent team," junior Laurie Sawin said.
That's an understatement. In the
first game, Arizona State was fired up
for the game, getting to everything
defensively and shutting the Cardinal
down. Game two was all Stanford.

In fact, the first four points were all
Kristin Klein. The three-time All-
American hitter shredded the Sun Devil
blocks and defense, pounding the ball in
twice to fire the crowd up.
She also blocked and dinked for
points, and suddenly Stanford was up 4-
0. The whole team stepped up its play
and routed Arizona State handily.
"It's the mark of a great team to
come back like that. The players adjust
ed to what was going on — our blocking
defense was much more organized and
our serve was real tough," Coach Shaw
said.
"It was good for us to click on and
play well," senior Nicole Appleman said.
Stanford continued to roll over
Arizona State after that, hitting at will,
playing solid defense, and sweeping the
next two games easily. The Cardinal hit
.296 as a team while holding the Lady
Sun Devils to a paltry .148.
Stanford limited Arizona State's star
player, senior Mindy Gowell, to just 7
kills and a .091 hitting percentage. In
addition, the Lady Sun Devils made sev
eral rotational and center-line viola
tions.
Shaw was particularly pleased with
his team'B defense.
"With Jurgens and Sawin we have
two backcourt specialists who are as
good as there are out there today,"
Shaw said.
Jackson provided another outstand
ing match for the Cardinal, with 11
kills, 14 digs, and a phenomenal .524
hitting percentage.
"She is hitting amazingly — it's real
ly what we needed. We were missing
another outside hitter last year, and
now we have her. She's just great,"
Cooper said.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team travels next to play California at
Berkeley Sept. 25 at 7:30.
You can rest assured that Stanford
won't be caught napping again.
