The new freshmen on the Farm
weren't the only ones having fun
under the sun this weekend.
Stanford's women's soccer team was
playing Kick Bu Un Sun on Saturday
and Sunday as they hammered
Washington 4-0 and Oregon State 6-0
in balmy Pullman, Wash.

Cardinal 4, Huskies 0

Cardinal 6, Beavers 0

The No. 10 (and rising) Cardinal
booters are undefeated at 5-0 on the
season. They have outscored their
opponents 26-1 in their first five
games, including one game against
favored national power UC-Santa
Barbara.
They're doing all right.
Yesterday against Oregon State
they could do no wrong. Well, almost
no wrong. They fouled nine times.
They were called offsides three times.
They only scored six times out of 45
chances. They allowed one shot on
their goal. Oops.
The Beavers and the roaring crowd
of 270 fans all knew it was going to be
a long day when the Cardinal tallied its
first goal 37 seconds into the game.
Freshman Kristen Wair and senior
Kim Petersen joined forces as Petersen
took Wair's penalty kick and put the
ball in the center of the net for
Stanford's first of many points on the
day.
Less than five minutes later, Ail-
American Julie Foudy scored unassist
ed, and about a minute after that
senior Denise Denney scored off a
Sarah Rafanelli assist.
After a long hiatus of 20 minutes,
the Cardinal offense began to produce
again. Junior Jen Potok, finally back
after suffering two years from the
notorious Jen Curse (All players
named Jennifer on the team last year
suffered knee usuries), popped a head
er by the OSU goalkeeper ofT of a pin
point Foudy cross.
The prolific Foudy scored
Stanford's final two points of the first
half and the game within the next

fourteen minutes. One goal was an
unassisted blast to the right post. The
other one was a redirecting volley of a
booming cross shot by freshman full
back Laura Wilkes.
On Saturday, the overmatched
Huskies managed to keep up with
Stanford better than the Beavers
would, but they still lost 4-0.
Foudy opened the scoring early by
beating a defender unassisted and fir
ing into the left side of the net. Late in
the first half, Rafanelli matched her by
dribbling past a defender inside the
goal box and tallying Stanford's second
goal.
Both of the Cardinal's second-half
goals were scored by senior sweeper

Heather Mclntyre on penalty kicks.
Stanford had a more mortal 25
shots on Washington's goal, compared
to yesterday's 45, but still only allowed
four shots on its own goal.
In yesterday's Oregon State
blowout, Stanford coach Berhane
Andeberhan, who has apparently set
tled on a starting goalie in 5-foot-8
sophomore Leslie Garrard, used his
fairly comfortable 6-0 lead to give all
three of his goalies plenty of somnolent
playing time.
Perhaps the greatest concern of
Cardinal women's soccer fans this year
was the goalkeeper position. Stanford
lost the greatest keeper in its history
and one of the greatest in the nation to

graduation. Fans have wondered if
someone could step in to replace Elise
Edwards, one of Andeberhan's first
stellar recruits.
That question may not be answered
this season. Certainly it would take an
incredible performance from any of
Stanford's young keepers — none of
whom are over 5-8 — to match the play
of Edwards, who started for four years
and had a great physical advantage at
5-11.
However, Andeberhan's lesser
known troops have shown themselves
exceptionally well in the early going. In
addition, the rest of the Cardinal team

The Washington State Invitational was a sort of homecoming for several Cardinal booters who hail from the Evergreen
State. Senior midfielder Denise Denney felt right at home in the holes of Oregon State's defense. She scored the third
of six Stanford goals and helped the defense to its third straight shutout.
