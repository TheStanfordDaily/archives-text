Field Hockey: Once again the Stanford
field hockey team has gotten off to a fast start.
They beat Northern Pacific Conference foes
California twice, 3-1 and 1-0. Pacific also fell to
the Cardinal, 2-1.
Sophomore forward Sara Hallock leads the
team in scoring with four goals and an assist.
Freshman midfielder Tina Seyr and senior co
captain Susan Leckrone have also tallied goals.
Chris Trevino has two assists on the year.
Trevino, a junior midfielder, is a member of the
U.S. national squad.
While the offense has averaged two goals a
game the stingy defense has a .67 goals against
average. Senior goalkeeper Kristina Vidal has
started every game and has 38 saves in the first
three contests.
Last season the team was undefeated in con
ference play and finished with an 8-5-1 overall
record. Stanford hopes to repeat as NorPac
champions this year.
Golf: For the first time both men's and
women's golf teams are ranked in the preseason
top 10 in Golfweek Magazine.
"I guess it means there are people out there
that know that our program is really becoming
competitive and for that we're grateful," said
Cardinal men's coach Wally Goodwin.
On the men's side Stanford is No. 10.
Sophomore Casey Martin was named a Second
Team All-American while senior Christain
Cevaer and sophomore Notah Begay got honor
able mentions.
Leading the men's squads aire preseason
favorites Arizona State, led by two-time NCAA
individual champ Phil Mickelson, and national
powerhouse Oklahoma State.
The women are No. 6, the same place they
finished at last year's NCAA Championships.
Seniors Adele Moore and Audrey Wooding were
named Second Team All-Americans while
senior Stephanie Davis and junior Martha
Richards got honorable mentions.
Arizona is the preseason favorite with
Georgia, San Jose State, UCLA and Tulsa
rounding out the top five.
Tennis: The preseason rankings are out and
the women are ranked lower than they have
been for quite some time. After winning their
sixth straight NCAA team title last spring the
Cardinal are No. 5. Florida tops the list as they
did most of last year before the NCAA
Tournament.
After losing Sandra Birch and Teri
Whitlinger to graduation and Debbie Graham
to the pro tour this season's squad is younger
and less experienced than it has been in the
recent past.
Sophomore Kristine Kurth
and junior Heather Willens are
ranked in the singles top 10.
Kurth, a transfer from William
and Mary, is No. 8 based mainly
on her strong showing at the
NCAAs last year. Willens earned
AU-American honors in that
tournament by reaching the
quarterfinals. She is ranked one
spot behind Kurth.
The men lost two of their top
three players this summer when
Jared Palmer and Jonathan
Stark turned pro. But with a deep
squad Stanford landed at No. 3 in
the preseason poll.
The Cardinal will be lead by
senior Alex O'Brien who is
ranked No. 2 in singles. Patricio
Arnold, who lost to Palmer in the
finals of the NCAA
Championships last year, is slot
ted at No. 1.
O'Brien and senior Jason Yee
are ranked No. 4 in doubles.
Volleyball The USA men's
volleyball team head coach Fred
Sturm will be featured in the
Stanford University Volleyball
Coaches Clinic Oct. 6.
Sturm is on a leave of absence
as the Cardinal men's coach. He
will coach team USA through the
1992 Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain. In 1991 Sturm has
coached the team to a 17-19
record.

The Stanford men's soccer team split two games at the Portland Tournament Friday and Sunday. The
Cardinal blanked CSU-Los Angeles but the effort of top reserves like midfielder Wade Colwell was not
enough to stop the host team from taking the second contest, 4-1.
