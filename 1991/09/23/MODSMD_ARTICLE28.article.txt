# Cross country team squashes grapes, competition in Sonoma
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Watch out, Oregon and Wash
ington. The Stanford men's cross
country team established itself as
a challenger for the Pacific 10
Conference crown this weekend
with a team championship at the
Sonoma State Invitational.
While Stanford was the only
Pac-10 team that competed at
Sonoma, it was by no means the
only strong group. UC-Davis and
Humboldt State, the second and
third place finishers, are both
ranked in the top five nationally
in Division 11.
For the second meet in a row,
the Cardinal squad was paced by
seniors Dave Scudamore and Fred
Carter. Scudamore, who finished
fourth in last weekend's Fresno
State Invitational, won the 10
kilometer race in 31:17. Carter,
who finished three seconds
behind his teammate at Fresno,
was runner-up in Saturday's race,
finishing in 31:34.
For Stanford head coach Scott
Chisam, the performance of his
top two seniors was predictable.
"Scudamore and Carter ran very
well for the second week in a
row," Chisam said. "They remain
two of the top individuals in the

[Pac 10] conference."
At Sonoma, however, it was
the outstanding team effort
turned in by the team's middle
runners which put the Cardinal
over the top. The five Stanford
harriers who placed behind Scud
amore and Carter finished within
25 seconds of each other.
Todd Lewis, Mike Rielly, Ben
Cravatt, and Brett Allsop finished
ninth through 12th, respectively,
while sophomore Brian Mc-
CafTery came in 17th. Derek Bork
placed 25th and eighth on the
Cardinal with a time of 33:29, 32
seconds behind McCaffery.
This impressive display of
team running particularly
encouraged Chisam. "Finishing
9-10-11-12 solidified our win," he
said. "We had a goal of the No. 3
through No. 7 runners staying
together on the hilly, warm (85
degrees Fahrenheit) course."
In addition, the time separat
ing the pack of Stanford runners
from the two team leaders
shrank. While Scudamore and
Carter finished 1:30 ahead of
their closest teammates on last
weekend's five mile course, the
gap was cut to a minute in the
longer (over six miles) Sonoma
race on Saturday.
This fact was characterized as

"the meet's highlight" by Chisam.
Indeed, a solid effort like the one
turned in by the group last week
end is essential to Stanford's con
ference championship chances.
Two additional developments
on the cross country team should
further bolster the group's for
tunes. Redshirt sophomore Gary
Stolz, sidelined with a painful
hamstring injury early on in the
year, is nearing a full recovery.
Stolz, who finished 16th in last
year's NCAA District 8 Champi
onships, has "looked strong in
practice," according to Chisam,
and should return to meet run
ning in a couple of weeks.
The emergence of Cardinal
runner Eric Spayde at the Sono
ma meet also signals good things
to come for the squad. Spayde, a
rare true freshman on the Divi
sion I level, finished a competitive
31st in the race, with a time of
33:40.
His performance only further
confirmed Chisam's previous con
victions about the young runner.
The coach had characterized
Spayde as the type of freshman
who comes along only "once every
three years."
On Saturday, Oct. 5, the team
will host the Stanford Invitation
al at the Stanford Golf Course.
