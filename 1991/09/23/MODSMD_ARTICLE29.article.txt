# Booters crush CSLA, drop Portland game
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
In the movies, happy endings
like the above are easy. But on the
harsh playing fields of reality, the
guy in the cardinal and white hat
does not always win. Such was
the case yesterday, when
Portland's Kasey Keller outper
formed Stanford's Kyle Krpata to
give the Pilots a 4-1 victory and
drop the Cardinal's record to 3-2-
2.
The defeat ended a three-game
Stanford winning streak and, in
conjunction with the Cardinal's
6-0 trouncing of Cal-State Los
Angeles on Friday, gave the team
second place in the Portland
Tournament.
Stanford is off to a somewhat
disappointing start this season,
since expectations were very high.
The team returns essentially all
of its best players from last year's
squad, and still has great poten
tial to do extremely well this year,
perhaps garnering an NCAA
berth.
However, at its current pace,
the Cardinal will exactly match
last year's 9-6-6 record, which

Men's Soccer

Cardinal 6, Golden Eagles 0

Pilots 4, Cardinal 1

would most assuredly be less than
its talent deserves.
In yesterday's game, Stanford
did not play as badly as the score
would indicate. In fact, the
Cardinal had 21 shots on
Portland's goal, compared to the
Pilots' 16.
Stanford encountered two
problems primarily. The first was
that the Pilots were particularly
accurate with their shots, and
were able to get past the normally
very tough Krpata.
The second was that
Portland's Keller simply played a
spectacular game, collecting 12
saves while being scored on only
once.
The Cardinal played much
closer to its potential on Friday,
destroying the Golden Eagles 6-0.
Stanford tallied three goals in
each half with its consistent play,
including two unassisted scores
by junior Jim Talluto.
