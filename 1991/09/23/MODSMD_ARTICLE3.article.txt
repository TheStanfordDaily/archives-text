# Stanford showing Biddle the door
## University asks dismissal of regulator; he says he's considering leaving anyway 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle's days at Stanford may be num
bered.
The University demanded last week that
the Navy remove the rough-and-tumble cam
pus-based regulator who a year ago first
accused the University of massively overcharg
ing the government for indirect costs of
research during the 1980s.
In a letter facsimilied Wednesday to the
chief of naval research, University General
Counsel John Schwartz said a federal auditor
had informed Stanford officials that Biddle
had filed a personal lawsuit seeking to receive
damages from the University.
Such an action, Schwartz argued, repre
sents a conflict of interest under federal regu
lations. "Mr. Biddle, who has filed a personal
lawsuit against Stanford, is a formal adversary
of Stanford in litigation and therefore cannot
be considered to be fair and impartial,"
Schwartz said.
As the campus representative of the Office
of Naval Research, Biddle is responsible for
ensuring that Stanford spends government
research grant and contract monies properly.
He is also part of a team that sets the rate at
which the University is reimbursed by the gov
ernment for indirect, or overhead, costs.
Indirect costs are those expenditures neces
sary for conducting federal research but not
easily attributable to a particular project. They
include electricity, maintenance and building
depreciation.
In his letter to the Navy, Schwartz wrote
that Biddle had filed a qui tam suit. In such a
suit, an individual may file for himself as well
as the government and personally receive as
much as 30 percent of the award.
Biddle has repeatedly said Stanford may
have overcharged the government by as much
as $200 million during the last decade — a fig
ure he says could be several-fold higher with
interest and penalties.
Biddle refused to comment at a press con
ference Thursday and again in an interview
yesterday as to whether or not he had filed suit
against the University.
He did acknowledge, however, that he has
retained attorney Phillip Benson of Herbert
Hafif, a firm well-known for handling qui tam
lawsuits.
Biddle also said he would not consider it a

Navy regulator Paul Biddle, who last year sparked a firestorm over the University's
charging of Indirect costs to the federal government, may be on his way out. He says
he wants to slay larger dragons; Stanford officials claim a lawsuit Biddle recently filed
against the University constitutes a conflict of interest.
conflict of interest for a Navy con
tracting officer who had filed a qui
tam suit against a university to
remain on the job. He stressed that
he was speaking hypothetically.
Biddle said he had retained Ben
son because he needed leyal help in
interpreting contract law and that
the Office of Naval Research was
unwilling to provide him with ade
quate assistance. "My attorneys are
the creme de la ere me," Biddle said.
"That's the reason the University is
quite anxious to see me depart."
Biddle refused to say yesterday
who was paying his attorney's fees,
offering only that it was not the
Office of Naval Research. "Payment
has been arranged," he said.
Mark Whetstone, a Navy spokes
man, said in an interview Friday
afternoon that Rear Adm. William
Miller, the chief of naval research,
was considering the University's
request to remove Biddle.
It is unlikely, however, that a deci
sion will be announced very soon.
By law a qui tam suit is kept
under seal for at least 60 days to give
the Justice Department a chance to
review the case and decide whether
to join the suit. Thus, neither Stan
ford nor the Navy has been able to
view Biddle's alleged lawsuit.
But Biddle could soon be leaving
Stanford for another reason.
He said yesterday that staff
members of the House Subcommit

tee on Oversight and Investigations
had recently suggested the Navy
place him in a job where he would
have the authority to examine the
research practices of other universi
ties. The subcommittee, chaired by
the powerful Michigan Democrat
John Dingell, held a punishing hear
ing in mid-March on Stanford's indi
rect-cost practices.
"I would like to get on to other
schools," Biddle said yesterday.
"There are universities around the
country with problems every bit as
severe as Stanford's."
He added that he thought it
would be a logical time for such a
move to take place.
University officials would like
nothing more than to see Biddle
removed from the campus representa
tive position. The regulator has been a
staunch ally of Dingell's subcommit
tee and has taken the hardest line
against Stanford of any Navy officials.
When the Navy cut the Universi
ty's indirect-cost rate to 55.5 percent
in April, throwing Stanford into a
budgetary quagmire, Biddle con
tended the negotiating team had
been too generous. He has repeated
ly accused other Navy negotiators of
"bending over backwards" to assist
Stanford.
High-ranking Stanford officials
have privately questioned Biddle's
competency and motives for some
time. In a November interview with
The Daily, Janet Sweet of the Con
troller's Office said Biddle was "full
of venom." University President
Donald Kennedy has said Biddle has
"wild ideas."
