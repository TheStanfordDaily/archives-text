# Stanford showing Biddle the door
## University asks dismissal of regulator; he says he's considering leaving anyway 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
Paul Biddle's days at Stanford may be num
bered.
The University demanded last week that
the Navy remove the rough-and-tumble cam
pus-based regulator who a year ago first
accused the University of massively overcharg
ing the government for indirect costs of
research during the 1980s.
In a letter facsimilied Wednesday to the
chief of naval research, University General
Counsel John Schwartz said a federal auditor
had informed Stanford officials that Biddle
had filed a personal lawsuit seeking to receive
damages from the University.
Such an action, Schwartz argued, repre
sents a conflict of interest under federal regu
lations. "Mr. Biddle, who has filed a personal
lawsuit against Stanford, is a formal adversary
of Stanford in litigation and therefore cannot
be considered to be fair and impartial,"
Schwartz said.
As the campus representative of the Office
of Naval Research, Biddle is responsible for
ensuring that Stanford spends government
research grant and contract monies properly.
He is also part of a team that sets the rate at
which the University is reimbursed by the gov
ernment for indirect, or overhead, costs.
Indirect costs are those expenditures neces
sary for conducting federal research but not
easily attributable to a particular project. They
include electricity, maintenance and building
depreciation.
In his letter to the Navy, Schwartz wrote
that Biddle had filed a qui tam suit. In such a
suit, an individual may file for himself as well
as the government and personally receive as
much as 30 percent of the award.
Biddle has repeatedly said Stanford may
have overcharged the government by as much
as $200 million during the last decade — a fig
ure he says could be several-fold higher with
interest and penalties.
Biddle refused to comment at a press con
ference Thursday and again in an interview
yesterday as to whether or not he had filed suit
against the University.
He did acknowledge, however, that he has
retained attorney Phillip Benson of Herbert
Hafif, a firm well-known for handling qui tam
lawsuits.
Biddle also said he would not consider it a

Navy regulator Paul Biddle, who last year sparked a firestorm over the University's
charging of Indirect costs to the federal government, may be on his way out. He says
he wants to slay larger dragons; Stanford officials claim a lawsuit Biddle recently filed
against the University constitutes a conflict of interest.
