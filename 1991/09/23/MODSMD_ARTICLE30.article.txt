Stanford scientists receive awards
Two Stanford scientists were honored by the
White House last Monday. Physics Prof. Arthur
Schawlow received the National Medal of Science,
and Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi was awarded
the National Medal of Technology.
Schawlow received his award for his work in
conceiving the laser and some of its uses. He won
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1981 for his contri
bution to the development of laser spectroscopy,
the examination of substances by how they reflect
or absorb light.
He is the 19th Stanford faculty member to win
the honor. Schawlow, 70, will retire Oct. 1 from
teaching but will maintain a small lab at Stanford
where he will continue to experiment with com
puters and other devices that might assist his son,
Artie, who is autistic, with communicating.
Djerassi, who is also an industrialist and a nov
elist, was cited for applying the biological principle
that works for the birth control pill to making pes
ticides with a minimal impact on the environment.
Best known as the leader of the scientific team
that first synthesized a practical oral contracep
tive, Djerassi has also written two novels which
use fiction to explore ethical issues faced by scien
tists.

Arms control director named
Stanford political scientist David Holloway
became co-director of Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms Control this
summer.
Holloway is a specialist on United States â€”
Soviet relations and Soviet nuclear policy. He will
serve a three-year term at the center, which brings
together scholars for research, training and out
reach related to arms control and international
security.
He will be working with co-director William
Perry.
