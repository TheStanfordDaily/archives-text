# Frosh get new view of diversity

### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Over the past several years,
New Student Orientations
have struggled to present
Stanford's pluralistic commu
nity to incoming students.
After attempts at pushing
multiculturalism ultimately
met with student resentment,
organizers of this year's Ori
entation reformatted their
presentation of student diver
sity with a focus on communi
ty-building.
Indeed, community was the
buzzword of choice at Saturday
morning's two-hour "Faces of
Community" program at
Memorial Auditorium.
"It was much less con
frontational" than past events,
said senior Chris Cuckow, res
ident assistant in Paloma.
"Faces of Community" con
trasted sharply to 1989's pro
gram "The Fire Within,"
which was presented as a cele
bration of four communities of
color: Asian-Americans, African-
American, Chicano/Latinos
and Native Americans. This
year's program instead includ
ed students from a wide variety
of cultures; disabled, Greek,
bisexual and religious commu
nity members all had a chance
to speak out or share their
experiences.
"Faces of Community" was
designed as "a program where
people would just sit down and

relate their personal experiences,
and we could appeal to people on
a personal level," said Greg Ricks,
multicultural educator and pro
ducer of the show. "We wanted to
include everybody."
During the program, ten
"faces" made presentations about
their personal perspectives about
community-building. The speak
ers included Stanford students,
faculty and staff. Interspersed
between the speakers were slides
of campus groups and this year's
freshmen.
Participants included Asst.
Dean of Campus Affairs Jim Lari
more, who directs the American
Indian Program Office, and Jane
Chang of the Chinese Folk Dance
Ensemble.
There were also representa
tives from the Greek system, the
Haas Center for Public Service
and Queerland, all of whom relat
ed personal anecdotes and feel
ings about diversity and commu
nity at Stanford.

At the close of the event, stu
dents were asked to write down
"personal policies" regarding
their commitment to community
building at Stanford. Students
sealed their statements in
envelopes with their names on
them and deposited them in a
time capsule to be opened at the
Junior Convocation in 1993.
The commitments will remain
confidential and will be returned
to students at the convocation.
In the afternoon, discussions
about the program were held in
the residences. Student reactions
were mixed.
"The time capsule was a good
idea," said Larkin freshman
Loren Cheng. " Community is
more open of a term than multi
culturalism," Cheng added.
Other students were less
impressed with the new term.
"Doesn't the term community
conflict with multiculturalism?"
askod Topaz Lev-On, another
freshman. "Multiculturalism
asks you to identify with one par
ticular group, while community
asks you to come together."
"I prefer the term diversity,"
said freshman Jon Marek.

"Diversity is a better term than
multicultural ism. It goes beyond
the connotation of ethnicity and
cultural groups."
Many students saw the pre
sentation as a sign the university
is concerned with issues of diver
sity and called it u a starting
point."
Sophomore Oscar Valadez,
theme associate at Casa Zapata,
said the program was "kind of an
extension of a theme we've had
for a long time at Zapata: la
familia, the family. Still, I felt
that it glossed over some of the
problems on campus."
Several students said they felt
listening to a program on diversi
ty and community is not as valu
able as experiencing them first
hand.
"You can make all the speech
es you want, listen to 40 zillion
presentations, but you have to
experience the diversity first
hand," said freshman Gigi Gano.
"I felt it at Stanfordopoly on Fri
day night. That was real." Stan
