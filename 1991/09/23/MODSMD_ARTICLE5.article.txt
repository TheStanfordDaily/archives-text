# Committee will lead national search for Kennedy successor
## 
### Steve McCarroll Staff writer 
Stanford University's next
president will be identified next
spring or summer by a Trustee-
Faculty Presidential Selection
Committee on which students,
staff and alumni will also be rep
resented.
The 15- to 18-member commit
tee will be appointed by James
Gaither, president of Stanford's
Board of Trustees, during the
next four weeks. The committee
will make its recommendation to
the full Board of Trustees, which
has responsibility for the final
decision.
The board voted Tuesday to
accept this process for an exten
sive national search, based on the

recommendation of an ad hoc
committee that spent much of the
last month studying presidential
search procedures at Stanford
and other universities.
Gaither is in Europe until this
weekend and could not be reached
for comment. However, Gaither
told Stanford News Service that
"the choice of a single committee
with diverse membership from all
branches of the Stanford family
reflects the board's intention to
have a united, inclusive search."
Gaither will appoint members
of the selection committee after
consultation with trustees, deans
of Stanford's schools and faculty
leadership including the Advisory
Board and the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Committees. He
will also consult alumni, staff.

students and fund-raisers.
"We will want to have the most
diverse interests represented on
the committee," said Human
Resources Manager Alana Wilson,
a member of the ad hoc commit
tee.
W r ilson added particular atten
tion will be paid to diversity of
age, ethnicity and academic disci
pline.
Although the plans for the
committee do not now include the
presence of professional "head
hunters," Wilson said that possi
bility is still open. "That will be a
decision that the actual commit
tee can still make," Wilson said.
However, Wilson said many
faculty members oppose the
inclusion of such professionally
hired human-resource organiza
tions in the search process.
The ad hoc committee decided
on this search process after a
month of consultation and
research. The committee particu
larly studied recent presidential
searches at Harvard, Princeton,
MIT and Occidental, as well as
Stanford's three most recent
presidential searches.
The search process will be con
ducted in several phases, commit
tee members said.
The first phase, which will
take several weeks, will be the

development of a position descrip
tion and a set of qualifications.
The committee will then send
out letters inviting nominations,
outlining the job criteria and the
selection process. It will spend
much of the winter and spring
reviewing application materials,
screening candidates and con
ducting interviews. Confidentiali
ty of candidate names will be a
priority.
By the spring or early summer
of 1992, the committee will make
its recommendation to the board.
The candidate selected by the
board will be Stanford's ninth
president and successor to Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy, who on July 29
announced he would resign effec
tive Aug. 31, 1992.
