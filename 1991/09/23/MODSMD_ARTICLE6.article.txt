# Kennedy focuses on public service
## Welcome speech to new students is his 12th — and last 
### David Bianco Senior staff writer 
In his final annual welcome
address to incoming undergradu
ates Friday, University President
Donald Kennedy exhorted stu
dents to overcome their mistrust
of government and other large
organizations and work together
in public service and academic
pursuits.
Speaking before a Memorial
Auditorium packed with fresh
men, transfer students, resident

assistants and orientation volun
teers, Kennedy presented what he
called two competing visions of
civic improvement in this coun
try: the "Great Society," in which
large government programs inter
vene for social betterment, and
the "thousand points of light," in
which the sum of individual vol
untarism accomplishes social
change.
Kennedy came down markedly
on the side of the Great Society.
"In my own view it is not possible
to build a great society merely

through the private actions of
good persons," he said. "The solu
tions provided by individual vol
untarism too often attack symp
toms but leave causes untouched
— thus providing relief without
remedy."
He cited a survey by the Amer
ican Council on Education on the
attitudes of college-bound stu
dents that showed increasing
interest in public service, but also
an increasing mistrust of govern-
ment and other large organiza
tions. 1
Students must overcome that
mistrust if real social changc is to
occur, Kennedy said. "The ulti
mate remedies for the great prob
lems we face — poverty, environ
mental quality, health care,
equality of educational opportuni
ty — lie partly within but mostly
outside the grasp of helpful per
sonal intervention.
"They require well-educated,
highly motivated people who
know how to work with one
another, often in complex organi
zations," "Kennedy continued.
He then admonished students
to "overcome this mistrust of
large scale, and bring your per
sonal entrepreneurial impulse to
bear on big, hard-to-mobilize
structures."
Next, Kennedy described
Stanford as one place where stu
dents are challenged to work in
communities and "submerge
individual differences in the

interest of constructing coopera
tive groups." He urged students
to seek "ways to work with oth
ers — including persons with
very different attitudes and
backgrounds from your own —
on things that matter."
Kennedy also spoke out on the
fact that this, his 12th welcome
address to new students, was also
his last. He said that at the end of
the year he would have a "wel
come year of sabbatical leave, for
academic renewal," after which
he will return to teaching as a
Stanford faculty member. He sug
gested that he might return from
his sabbatical "just in time ... to
read and grade your senior hon
ors theses."
New students also heard from
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions John Bunnell, Dean
of Students Michael Jackson and
Council of Presidents member
John Louie.
Bunnell's speech — which was
repeatedly interrupted by the
Class of 1995 applauding itself —
cited several statistics that
showed the diversity and excel
lence of Stanford's newest stu
dents:

• The freshman class hails
from 48 states, with no one from
Wyoming or West Virginia."
Although we have no quotas of
any kind, this coming year
wouldn't be a bad one to be apply
ing from either one of those
states," Bunnell joked.
• Forty-seven percent of the
class are women, the highest pro
portion of females ever.
• There is 40 percent "minority
representation" in the freshman
class.
Jackson began by thanking
Kennedy for his tenure as presi
dent and said to the students,
"You come to this University at
an exciting time."
He invited the new students to
take part in the decision-making
process of budget-cutting and said
"the more responsibility you take
for your education, the more you
will learn."
Louie, a senior, invited all the
new students to feel like they are
an important part of the school.
"We are all big fish in this big
pond," he said. "Welcome to Stan
ford, 94305, where you get all of
the California sun and none of the
sideburns."
