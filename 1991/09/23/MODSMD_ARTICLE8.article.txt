Economic recovery slows
WASHINGTON (AP) — The American econo
my appears to be recovering from the recession,
but not as strongly as the Bush administration
would like, budget director Richard Darman said

Statistics on industrial production, housing
starts and other economic indicators suggest the
economy may have turned up in May, Darman
said on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley."
"The question is whether it's going to stay up
and whether it's going to come up strongly,"
Darman said. "I think it will stay up. It's not com
ing up as strongly as we would want."
