# Cease-fire declared in Yugoslavian civil war
## Bloody three-month fighting between Serbs, Croatians at temporary halt 
### 
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” The feder
al defense minister and Croatia declared a
cease-fire yesterday, and reports suggested
that the fierce fighting in the breakaway
republic was easing at least temporarily.
Earlier, federal air and artillery attacks
overlapped a 3 p.m. deadline for a halt to the
fighting, raising doubts about whether offi
cials would be able to rein in the warring
factions.
Previous cease-fires have failed to end
the conflict that has claimed more than 500
lives since Croatia declared independence
June 25 and has severely weakened the
Yugoslav government's control over the
army.
Late yesterday, Croatian defense officials
in the Adriatic ports of Split, Pula and
Rijeka reported that federal naval blockades
imposed along the Croatian coast last week
were being lifted.
Officials in the Croatian capital of Zagreb
also ended the nightly blackout imposed last
week amid a series of air attacks near the
city. A lull in fighting also was reported in
Osijek, a battered city in eastern Croatia.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman pro
claimed the truce he struck with Federal
Defense Minister Veljko Kadijevic a victory
for his republic.
"The army finally saw that even with
stronger forces, they could not break our
resistance," Tudjman declared in a radio
interview.
Federal warplanes and tanks have
increasingly backed ethnic Serb rebels
opposed to secession. A massive Yugoslav
convoy of armored vehicles and troops
rolled into Croatia last week and launched
its largest offensive.
The cease-fire was announced a day after
Croatia twice made offers to end a blockade
of military garrisons if federal forces ended

their fierce attacks. Croatian officials said
the cease-fire was based on this deal.
Tudjman on Sunday ordered a blockade
of federal barracks in Croatia lifted,
although he didn't mention withdrawing
Croatian troops from around the barracks,
said Vesna Skare, a spokeswoman for
Tudjman.
The week-long blockade cut off food,
water and electricity to the federal soldiers
and forced some to surrender.
Kadijevic, in a statement released by the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, said an
agreement had been reached for "an abso
lute cease-fire." It said he would order all
his forces in Croatia to "cease all attacks
and movements."
Authorities said Tudjman and Kadijevic
reached the truce agreement Sunday morn
ing, apparently in a telephone conversa
tion.There was no talk of it needing
approval from the eight-man federal presi
dency, nominally the commander of the
armed forces. The presidency, led by Stipe
Mesic, has been virtually paralyzed for
months.
But Mesic, a Croat, appeared to approve
of the truce Sunday, telling reporters that
"international pressure contributed to
bringing the military back to its senses."
Numerous cease-fires in Croatia have
been cobbled together, mostly through
efforts by the European Community. All so
far have failed, and Croatia has lost about a
third of its territory to the ethnic Serbian
forces.
On Sunday, federal jets attacked a radar
station outside Zagreb, the Croatian capital,
just before the cease-fire took effect.
Croatian media also reported an air attack
on the Adriatic coastal city of Karlobag after
the truce began. It said a child was killed
and several people were wounded.
