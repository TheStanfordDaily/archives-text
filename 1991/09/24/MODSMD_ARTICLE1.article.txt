# USW membership votes to ratify contract

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Members of the United
Stanford Workers ratified a
new three-year contract yes
terday, averting a strike that
threatened to disrupt this
weekend's Centennial Celebra
tion.
The University and union
bargaining teams reached a
tentative agreement about
2:30 a.m. Monday â€” soon after
the union's midnight strike
deadline.
Despite some concern that
the agreement might be reject
ed, 85 percent of union mem
bers voted in favor of the new
contract.
According to the terms of
the agreement, union workers
will receive a 4 percent raise
this year and 3 percent raises
for the next two years. The
USW had been requesting 6
and 5 percent raises and the
University had been offering
raises of 3 and 2 percent.
But as with other Universi
ty employees and faculty, the
salary increase will not take
effect for six months.
"It is the same for all of the
University," explained Bar
bara Butterfield, vice president
for human resources. "One
good thing about Stanford is
that we are a fairly egalitarian
place."
Union members will also
have to pay slightly more for
health benefits for their depen
dents.
Some members of the union
said they were not totally satis
fied with the contract. They
said they should not have to
sacrifice because of the Univer
sity's financial problems.
"We understand what is
going on with the University in
terms of the budget crisis, but we
don't feel that we should be pay
ing for it," said Lon Warneke, a
member of the union media team
and a senior engineer at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center.
"We would have liked it better
if they could have implemented
the raises immediately, but we
have families and have to get on
with our lives," Warneke added.
"We simply have to be practical."
Within the union's general
membership, reaction to the new
contract was mixed.
"All in all, what the bargain
ing team was able to negotiate
was about as good as they were
going to get," said Eric Miller, a
tissue technician at the Stanford
Hospital. "The University had to
hang tough because of the bud
get.
"But many members are upset
because the Stanford adminis
tration mismanaged its money
and is making us pay for it,"
Miller added.
The University and USW will
formally sign the new contract
some time in the next several
weeks, Warneke said.
The agreement was reached
early Monday morning after

three days of meetings with
Clarence Washington, a media
tor with the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service who has
worked in past USW contract
negotiations.
Washington was unavailable
for comment yesterday.
The bargaining teams met all
weekend to avoid a possibly dis
ruptive strike during the Centen
nial Celebration. Members of the
USW will be instrumental in
preparing for and staffing Stan
ford's 100 th anniversary celebra
tion.
Butterfield said the Universi
ty did have a contingency plan in
case of a union strike but refused
to reveal any details.
Others within the administra
tion have said that recent Stan
ford alumni in the area and out
side vendors would have been
used as temporary replace
ments.
Butterfield insisted that the
threat of a strike during such an
important event did not force the
University into additional con
cessions. She explained that both
sides compromised and the Cen
tennial strike deadline made a
"desirable finish time."
In 1988, contract negotiations
also went until the eve of a strike
deadline before an agreement
was reached. The union struck in
1985 for a month, closing many
student services campuswide.
