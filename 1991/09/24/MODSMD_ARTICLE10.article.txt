# New students unfazed by publicity of Stanford's problems

Despite Stanford's recent negative
publicity over budget cuts, indirect costs,
earthquakes and sexual harassment,
members of the Class of 1995 said Stan
ford's latest troubles won't slow them
down.
"I was a bit apprehensive at first," said
Adelfa resident Michelle Chang. Now
that she's here, though, she says"I think
[Stanford's controversies are] outside
influences, and that the motivation to
succeed is within you. You can make

whatever you want out of your education
as long as you have the confidence and
the drive."
Madera resident Kevin Vick said the
reports about Stanford's indirect-cost
and sexual-harassment problems don't
bother him. "I chose a school based on its
people and not on how the president bills
the government or (how) the medical
school staff treat each other," said Vick,
who hails from Los Angeles.
Other students said the controversies,
particularly in the area of indirect costs
and budget cuts, have influenced their
thinking about their new school. "When

everything broke out, I had a lot of sec
ond thoughts," said Branner resident
Chris Li, who went to high school in Pull
man, WA. "When everything came down
to the wire, I wasn't sure what kinds of
cuts they were going to make.
"But then I realized [Stanford] had
such a strong history. I thought they
would have a good chance of rebounding.
Now it seems more the fault of govern
ment policy than the administration."
Fellow Brannerite Adam Stein said he
was "curious and worried" when he
heard University President Donald
Kennedy had decided to step down. "I'm

curious as to how all this will affect me,"
said Stein, who comes from Newton,
Massachusetts.
Faisan resident Sonya Smith pointed
out that several University of California
schools are facing budget crises more
severe than Stanford's and that scores of
students at those schools are not getting
into the classes they need.
Marc Richard, who lives in Madera,
agreed. "All the schools have problems,
and Stanford is one of the most highly
recognized in the nation," he said.
Several students stressed the quality
of their class and the rest of the Stanford

community. "I came to Stanford for the
exciting student body â€” academically
and socially," said Eucalypto resident
Rachel Zemans, from Chicago. "As long
as all that other hoopla doesn't diminish
the quality of the student body, it doesn't
affect me."
St. Louis native Kevin Herrington,
who now lives in Larkin, agreed. "Since
I've been here, everyone's been positive
and friendly. I only see optimism."
Granada resident Lance Cottrill, from
Fayetteville, Arkansas, had a different
twist on the indirect-cost controversy. "I
just want to ride on the yacht," he said.
