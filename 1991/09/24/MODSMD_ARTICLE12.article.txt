Proof of Iraqi nukes found
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Iraqi soldiers
detained U.N. officials for more than 12 hours
in a Baghdad building yesterday, then forcibly
confiscated documents that apparently show
Iraq has been developing nuclear weapons.
The inspectors found the papers in a surprise
search several hours before the U.N. Security
Council met to discuss Iraqi obstructions to
U.N. searches for hidden weapons and produc
tion facilities.
The confrontation could lead the Security
Council to accept President Bush's offer to pro
vide troops to guard the inspectors and war
planes to escort U.N. helicopter searches.
British hostage to be released
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Pro-Iranian kid
nappers said early today that within 48 hours
they will release British hostage Jack Mann, the
oldest of the Western hostages, who was abduct
ed more than two years ago.
The move by the Revolutionary Justice Orga
nization appeared to indicate that a logjam in
the complex negotiations by U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar for a compre
hensive exchange of Western captives for Arab
prisoners held by Israel, and possibly European
countries as well, had been broken.
Israeli talk conditions rebuked
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Yasser Arafat
rejected Israeli conditions for peace talks yester
day, but said the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion is ready nonetheless to help the United
States bring together the Middle East's antago
nistic neighbors.
He spoke at the opening of a pivotal congress
of the Palestine National Council, the Palestini
ans' parliament-in-exile. Its members are divid
ed on how to respond to Israel's tough condi
tions for Palestinian participation in peace talks
scheduled for October.
Experts predict record deficit
WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal budget
deficit ballooned to $260.9 billion through
August, the government said yesterday, virtual
ly ensuring a new fiscal-year record by the end
of September.
"It fits with a yearly deficit of between $260
billion and $265 billion," said economist Mari
lyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. in New York. If so, that would
top the previous record of $221.1 billion set in
1986.
The Bush administration projects the fiscal
1991 shortfall will be $282.2 billion, rising to
$348.3 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,
1992. The Congressional Budget Office con
tends the deficit will total $279.0 billion this
year and $362.0 billion next year.
NASA testing system poor
WASHINGTON (AP) - NASA's system of
testing spacecraft before they are launched is
poorly organized, leading to such problems as
the Hubble Space Telescope, according to a Gov
ernment Accounting Office study released yes
terday.
"Testing practices vary because NASA has no
uniform policies," the GAO report said. "Exist
ing guidance is fragmented, not well defined and
varies from one NASA field center to another."
