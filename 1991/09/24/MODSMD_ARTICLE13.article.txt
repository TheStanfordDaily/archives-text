# Bush tells U.N. to keep sanctions on Iraq
## Says Saddam must unconditionally allow nuclear weapons inspections 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - President
Bush told the United Nations on Monday
"we cannot compromise" on demands that
Iraq destroy its nuclear weapons capability.
He also urged the world body to disavow its
stand that Zionism is a form of racism.
While talking tough on Iraq, Bush set no
deadline for Saddam Hussein to uncondi
tionally submit to inspection and destruction
of his most dangerous weapons or face
renewed military force. The president did say
the U.N. should keep economic sanctions
clamped on Iraq as long as Saddam remains
in control.
He took a strong stance on the 1975 Zion
ism resolution, a major source of mistrust
between Israel and the U.N.
"To equate Zionism with racism is to
reject Israel itself," Bush said in his speech to
the General Assembly of representatives
from 166 nations. "This body cannot claim to
seek peace and at the same time challenge
Israel's right to exist.
"By repealing this resolution uncondition
ally," he said, "the United Nations will
enhance its credibility and serve the cause of
peace."
The United States has long deplored the
resolution but Bush had postponed a cam
paign to repeal it out of a desire to maintain
Arab support for the effort against Saddam
in the Persian Gulf.
The State Department's assistant secre
tary for international organizations, John
Bolton, told reporters, "We think we have a
majority in favor of repeal."
As for Iraq, some advisers had urged Bush
to set a deadline after which American war
planes would be used to accompany U.N.
inspectors on helicopter flights in Iraq.
Bush reworked his speech at Camp David
over the weekend and tinkered with the sec
tion on Iraq before leaving the White House
on Monday â€” as Iraqi soldiers were detain

ing U.N. inspectors who were trying to take
nuclear-weapons documents from a building
in Baghdad.
"We're not going to do anything before we
understand the facts," Bush said after his
speech. In Baghdad, the Iraqis released the
inspectors but kept the documents.
Bush's plea for keeping up pressure on
Saddam and for repealing the resolution on
Zionism were the high points of a speech in
which he outlined his vision of the world in
the post-Cold War era.
Bush also used his visit for a marathon of
diplomatic meetings at his suite at the Wal
dorf Astoria Hotel. He met with the leaders
of Brazil, El Salvador and South Korea and
arranged a reception for all the U.N. heads of
state.
At the same time, Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 was conferring with for
eign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union,
France and China, presumably solidifying
Big Five support for pressure on Iraq.
Baker appeared to warn Saddam of the
threat of military force. "We saw earlier the
tragic consequences of failure to comply"
with U.N. resolutions, he told reporters.
Today, Bush will meet with Boris Pankin,
the new Soviet foreign minister, now seeking
nearly $15 billion in food grants and credits
from the West to avert starvation this win
ter.
In his speech, Bush said the United States
had no desire to impose a "pax Americana"
on the world. At the same time, he said, "We
will not retreat and pull back into isolation. .
. . We will offer friendship and leadership.". .
. . He warned that "ethnic rivalries" and
"suspended hatreds have sprung to life" with
the demise of communism. "No one here can
promise that today's borders will remain
fixed for all time. But we must strive to
ensure the peaceful, negotiated settlement of
border disputes."
