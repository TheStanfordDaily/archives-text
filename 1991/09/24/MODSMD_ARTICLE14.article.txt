# Fragile truce calms battles in Yugoslavia

ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” Tanks of the Serb
dominated federal army and Croatian militias tested a
day-old cease-fire yesterday, dueling for strategic
towns. But much of the secessionist republic was
calm, and its leaders expressed hope for a lasting
truce.
The media in Croatia and its neighboring rival
republic, Serbia, reported a fierce fight was under way
around the central Croatian towns of Nova Gradiska
and Okucani. Battles were also reported elsewhere.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Monday
night that the fighting seemed to be ebbing, except for
sporadic clashes in the eastern region of Slavonia,
where Serb insurgents have fought Croatian militias
since the republic declared independence June 25.
"Croatia has shown its teeth, and a completely new
relation of forces has been established," said Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman's top adviser, Mario Nobi
lo, explaining why he thought the truce would hold.
"The only language that (Serbian President) Slo
bodan Milosevic can understand is the language of
force, and we have now shown that will no longer be
effective," Nobilo said.
"I think we have gotten over the worst," Tudj man
was quoted as saying Sunday night by Tanjug.
Croatian officials believe Milosevic is pulling the
strings in the fighting and seeks to expand Serbian
territory before agreeing to Croatian independence.
The truce signed by Tudjman and federal Defense
Minister Veljko Kadijevic officially took effect at 3
p.m. Sunday. But it was far from clear whether both
sides had control over forces in the field, or the will to
impose a long-lasting cease-fire.
At least five previous cease-fires in Croatia have
failed to end the fighting that has claimed more than
500 lives.

Soldiers in the Yugoslav federal army celebrate the cease-fire in their nation's bloody civil war. It
appears that the truce remains in effect despite scattered reports of continued fighting in some areas
between Croatian forces and the federal army.
