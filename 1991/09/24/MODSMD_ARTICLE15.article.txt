# Armenia declares independence, Georgia leader gains support
## Azerbaijan, Armenia working to end bloody 3-year ethnic battle without help from Gorbachev 
### 
TBILISI, U.S.S R. (AP) - The
Soviet republics were in turmoil
yesterday from the Caucasus to
Central Asia. Armenia declared
independence, armed Georgian
activists refused to leave a TV sta
tion and a Communist leader
regained power in Tadzhikistan.
Armenia and Azerbaijan,
meanwhile, reportedly were mak
ing headway in Russian-mediated
talks over Nagorno-Karabakh, a
disputed enclave where a bloody
ethnic conflict has claimed hun
dreds of lives since 1988.
The republics were taking
affairs into their own hands and
virtually ignoring the central gov
ernment, proof that Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev has
failed to regain much authority
since hard-liners deposed him
briefly last month.
Armenia on Monday became
the 12th republic to declare inde
pendence from the Kremlin, leav
ing only Russia, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenia in the nominal union.
The three Baltic states of Lithua
nia, Latvia and Estonia already
have broken out of the Soviet
Union.
The others who have broken
from Moscow do not seek the
same level of independence as the
Baltics. They have agreed to
remain in a loose confederat ion of
independent states, and all 15
republics have expressed interest
in maintaining economic ties in a

kind of common market.
Armenian lawmakers unani
mously endorsed the results of
last Saturday's referendum, in
which residents voted more than
94 percent in favor of indepen
dence. After the vote, lawmakers
and foreign visitors burst into "a
stormy ovation" celebrating inde
pendence, the Tass news agency
said.
A political storm persisted in
the southern republic of Georgia,
where President Zviad Gam
sakhurdia demanded that the
opposition put down its guns and
vacate the republic's broadcasting
studio.
Thousands of adoring support
ers answered Gamsakhurdia's
call to rally in front of the massive
Government House. Waving the
blue-white-and-maroon Georgian
flag, the crowd shouted "Zviady,
Zviady" when Gamsakhurdia
emerged from the building in the
evening. He declared nothing
would happen to his opponents if
they left the TV station.
But the opposition remained
firmly ensconced in the broadcast
studios, about a mile away. Some
100 protesters occupied the build
ing early Sunday and later were
joined by protesters and rebel
Georgian National Guardsmen.
"We want real democracy. If
Gamsakhurdia steps down, we'll
leave peacefully. If not, we're
staying here," said Ghia Mata

hashvili, a young National
Guardsman loyal to the opposi
tion.
Opposition leaders and West
ern officials, including the United
States, accuse Gamsakhurdia of
acting like a dictator since win
ning a landslide victory in Geor
gia's first direct election last sum
mer.
Gamsakhurdia says the cam
paign against him is being guided
by the Kremlin, and many sup
porters say his firm hand is neces
sary to win independence.
Opposition protesters were
backed bv at least two armored
personnel carriers, other vehicles
and a number of National
Guardsmen at the TV center.
Gamsakhurdia had met Sun
day with parliamentary opposi
tion leader Tedor Pataashvili but
reportedly only criticized the
opposition and demanded they
leave the TV building.
One anti-government demon
strator, identified in reports as a
37-year-old medical student, died
on Sunday, a day after setting
himself on fire. Tass has said 41
people others had been hospital
ized as of Sunday, nearly all
hunger strikers who were beaten
by police the day before.
In the Central Asian republic
of Tadzhikistan, the Communist
leader Rakhman Nabiyev made a
political comeback, replacing act
ing president Kadriddin Aslonov.
