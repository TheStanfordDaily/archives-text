## Students beware 
### 
Budget cuts threaten
academic programs
and overseas studies

ON THE SURFACE every
thing seems idyllic on the
Farm. The freshmen are set
tling into their new lives, old stu
dents have all arrived and the flaw
less California weather holds
steady. Also, Stanford caps off its
centennial year with a grand, star
studded jubilee this weekend.
But fireworks and sunshine
aside, Stanford hovers at a critical
juncture; the University must now
subject itself to profound self
examination as it seeks to unravel
the complex budgetary web and
place a dollar figure on each indi
vidual strand.
The University must perma
nently cut its $400 million operat
ing budget by nearly 10 percent.
Much of this results from the drop
in Stanford's indirect-cost recovery
rate from a projected 78 percent to
55.5 percent. The decisions made
over the coming weeks will deeply
affect the lives of each and every
student.
Last year's $20 million budget
repositioning proved extremely
painful; nearly all the excess fat
within Stanford was trimmed
without touching academic pro
grams or student life appreciably.
As a result, this fall the budget ax
will strike with even more vigor
when little remains that can be
altered without significant pain.
Unfortunately, mere administra
tive shuffling and restructuring
cannot approach the depth of this
crisis.
No academic department or pro
gram is wholly secure. The admin
istration has openly acknowledged
drastic measures must be taken;
majors will be eliminated and con
solidated; overseas campuses will
be closed; services students take
for granted will no longer be avail
able.

Critical questions must be
answered. For example, how heavy
a burden of the cuts should fall on
faculty research or undergraduate
programs or administrative sup
port? How committed is the Uni
versity to need-blind admissions?
Is it better to distribute the painful
process evenly across the board or
to target less vital but costly things
and leave other areas untouched?
A unified and coherent student
voice must emerge. The most effec
tive framework in which this can
occur is the ASSU Senate and the
Council of Presidents. As the elect
ed leaders of the student body, they
must involve themselves deeply in
the budget-cutting process.
The issues are complex and the
timeframe short; the University
has set Oct. 17 as the final date for
setting reduction targets. This is
no excuse, however, for a lack of
student involvement.
The COP has developed a pre
liminary plan to grapple with the
issue, including a student town
meeting on Oct. 3. They have also
requested that the Oct. 17 deadline
be extended in order to give stu
dents more time in which to voice
opinions.
While the University is under
severe fiscal pressure to resolve the
crisis, the administration should
seriously consider the request as
few students were able to partici
pate in the process this summer.
On the eve of the Centennial
Celebration, Stanford is faced with
one of its gravest financial crises.
The administration must recognize
the crucial importance of student
involvement in the budget process,
and the COP must uphold its com
mitment to organize and solicit
student opinion.
Ten percent of the budget repre
sents an enormous loss. We cannot
merely sit by and let the adminis
tration decide what is important
and what is not. The ramifications
of such complacency are simply too
great. The student body must con
front the hard reality at hand and
prioritize what we value most
about our time on the Farm.
