PROBLEMS WITH GENDER
insensitivity do exist in many
work environments in this coun
try. Our need now is to question why
sexism exists, how it is perpetuated,
why the issue has become important at
this point in time and what can be done
to eliminate it.
Career expectations for young men
and women in our society today contin
ue to be very different for the two sexes.
While there is recognition that society
has changed, and changed quite radical
ly, we hold on to the old-fashioned
beliefs that a man has a career in the
workplace with colleagues, while a
woman has her career in the home with
the next generation. And that is how we
raise our children — from an early age,
boys are directed to develop a career
while girls are led to believe someone
will be around to take care of them.
Unfortunately, economic necessity
dictates a different reality, and there
are very few young couples today who
can afford for one partner never to be
gainfully employed. During the latter
part of high school or in college, some
women find thinking is an enjoyable
enterprise and decide to develop a
career (as distinct from a job ).
The channeling of these nascent
career aspirations has tended to be in
those fields traditionally acceptable for
women — teaching, nursing, secretari
al. Because historically women have not
had to work and/or are not perceived as
important wage earners, these profes
sions are associated with far less pres
tige than the majority of career posi
tions occupied by men and are at the
low end of the pay scale.
Some women dedicate themselves to
expand their horizons farther, knowing
they can be very successful engineers,
architects, judges, even brain surgeons.
These competitive careers are played on
fields with rules that have been defined

by men — men who have spent their
formative years learning the games and
mastering their skills.
While growing up, women have not
been exposed to the games, let alone the
rules, and are late entries, rarely afford
ed the opportunity to catch up. With
women around, however, the playing
field is more crowded, and the long
standing rules are less clearly defined.
The presence of women in profes
sional environments is handled in three
ways: 1) the rules become redefined to
encompass all players (this is the ideal
but is happening very slowly); 2)
women are treated as if they are invisi
ble (if you can't see her, there is little
need for the rules to include her or to
provide her with resources or informa
tion); and 3) women are reminded on a
daily basis that just being born female
ipso facto means they are inferior, and
thus there is no need to explain the
rules as she will never be accepted as a
serious participant, much less a first
team player.
Problems arise when, because of
capability, energy and drive, a woman
does become a serious contender, and
the quality of her work output is equal
to or better than that of her male peers.
Suddenly, she becomes the enemy, a
threat to the next echelon, a person
whose gender uniqueness takes prece
dence over competence.
It is far easier to eliminate her than
adapt her. A few years ago I was asked
by a male colleague, "Why isn't what
you have good enough?" The message
was, "You have achieved more than I
thought you would, so I think you
should curtail plans for any further
effort or advancement."
It is a very inhibiting statement —
the glass ceiling in words! It is a com
ment that would not be made to a man;
men are expected to advance as far as
they possibly can; to date, women have

been expected to accept limits on their
career aspirations, and to do so grace
fully.
The controlling mechanism for limit
ing women and their dreams has been
"sexism" in its broadest definition.
Freud, along with others, promulgated
the theory of innate feminine inferiori
ty, and his legacy continues, alive and
well.
If women are indeed inferior, it mat
ters little that for the same job they
earn 60 percent of what males do or
that they are not promoted as readily,
or that they are frequently shunted off
into dead-end career positions. Inequal
ity of treatment accompanied by a con
stant reminder that women's sexual
and reproductive functions are sec
ondary to, and serve at the pleasure of,
those of the male is now important
because women represent formidable
numbers in our workforce.
It is far easier to offend four than 40.
The positive collegial atmosphere that
develops among male and female medi
cal students in their preclinical years
dissipates all too rapidly as competitive
careers are forged. Unwarranted
repression of women as they struggle to
succeed has led to considerable anger
and desire for redress.
How to change an environment to
one where the individual has worth
commensurate with his/her ability is a
question of values. A university cannot
mandate changes, even desirable ones,
throughout disparate career develop
ment arenas. It can, however, expose
students to desired sociological changes
with regard to gender insensitivity both
by establishing intellectual dialogue as
well as providing the ideal working
model.
Leadership sets the tone for any
institution. If Stanford values a learn
ing experience for its students, free
from the corrosive effects of discrimi

natory thinking and behavior, its lead
ership needs to be chosen carefully.
Leaders must have not only academic
excellence, but also those human quali
ties that compel them to cherish and
nurture the unique personalities and
talents of those who follow. Fear of con
flict must not deter the leadership from
maintaining dedicated commitment to
the realization of the University's
goals.

Dr. Frances Conley is a neurosurgeon at
the School of Medicine. Because of the
promptness of the University's response
to her charges of sexual harassment in
the workplace, she has returned to the
position she quit in June.
