# End to strike threat pleases Centennial planners

As word spread that the United Stan
ford Workers had voted not to strike,
officials across campus, especially those
planning this weekend's Centennial Cel
ebration, breathed a collective sigh of
relief.
"We'll find it a lot easier," said Cen
tennial Celebration Director Stephen
Peeps, whose office will no longer have to
resort to contingency plans that were
drawn up in recent weeks.
The plans had been developed since
problems in the negotiations became

apparent this summer, Peeps said.
Where possible, the University had
worked with non-union contractors for
purposes of the Centennial. Supervisors
of Centennial events were also supposed
to be prepared to fill in for employees,
and volunteers were to be sought to help
with events.
Still, Centennial planners were
delighted that the USW will not walk out.
"You make plans you hope you never
have to use," Peeps said. "Now I get to
count on the people I really value."
"We've been working as colleagues
and team members with people that are
in the unions," said Alumni Relations

Director Carolyn Manning, whose office
has organized several Centennial week
end events. "This is extremely good
news."
A strike would have presented other
problems for Centennial organizers, who
had planned parts of the Centennial to
be a celebration of Stanford employees.
Monday's stadium show, for example,
includes a section devoted to staff mem
bers and their contributions to Stanford.
"We thought it was rather sad that it
[would have] coincided with a group of
employees being disenfranchised,"

Members of the United Stanford Workers gather outside Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday morning after they voted to
approve a tentative contract agreement reached with the University earlier in the day.
Peeps said.
Centennial planners were not
the only ones consoled by the
Stanford-USW agreement. Resi
dent fellows also expressed relief,
saying that a strike would have
disrupted residential life during
its critical first weeks.
"It really [would have made] it
hard to form a community in the
residence," said Roble RF Rob
Robinson, who was an RF in
Lagunita during the USW's 1985
strike. "The dining halls are cen
tral" for community-building, he
added.
Residents would also have
faced personal decisions, such as

whether to cross picket lines to
attend class and to eat in Univer
sity-operated dining halls.
According to Robinson, one strike
support committee had sent let
ters to faculty members request
ing them to hold classes off cam
pus.
"It was going to be a lot for
freshmen to deal with right
away," Rinconada RF Richard
Holeton said.
The University's contingency
plan for providing food service this
year was different from the plan
during the 1985 strike. At that
time, the University gave rebates
to students, who ate in restau
rants and ordered pizza. This year,
the University had planned to con
tinue University Food Service in a
handful of residences, where all
students would eat.
