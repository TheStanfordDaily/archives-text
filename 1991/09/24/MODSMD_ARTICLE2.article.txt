# End to strike threat pleases Centennial planners

As word spread that the United Stan
ford Workers had voted not to strike,
officials across campus, especially those
planning this weekend's Centennial Cel
ebration, breathed a collective sigh of
relief.
"We'll find it a lot easier," said Cen
tennial Celebration Director Stephen
Peeps, whose office will no longer have to
resort to contingency plans that were
drawn up in recent weeks.
The plans had been developed since
problems in the negotiations became

apparent this summer, Peeps said.
Where possible, the University had
worked with non-union contractors for
purposes of the Centennial. Supervisors
of Centennial events were also supposed
to be prepared to fill in for employees,
and volunteers were to be sought to help
with events.
Still, Centennial planners were
delighted that the USW will not walk out.
"You make plans you hope you never
have to use," Peeps said. "Now I get to
count on the people I really value."
"We've been working as colleagues
and team members with people that are
in the unions," said Alumni Relations

Director Carolyn Manning, whose office
has organized several Centennial week
end events. "This is extremely good
news."
A strike would have presented other
problems for Centennial organizers, who
had planned parts of the Centennial to
be a celebration of Stanford employees.
Monday's stadium show, for example,
includes a section devoted to staff mem
bers and their contributions to Stanford.
"We thought it was rather sad that it
[would have] coincided with a group of
employees being disenfranchised,"
