# World leaders headline weekend's Centennial events
## 
### Seth Boyd 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney and California Gov. Pete Wil
son will address the Stanford community
this weekend as part of Stanford's Cen
tennial Celebration.
Mulroney's speech, beginning at 9 a.m.
Sunday, will be the first of the three
"finale convocations." Salinas will speak
Monday morning at the same time. Final
ly, Wilson follows both North American
leaders by closing the convocation series
with a 10:30 a.m. address Tuesday, Oct. 1.
Mulroney, Salinas and Wilson have

each already taken part in Centennial Cel
ebration activities. In 1990, both Mul
roney and Salinas addressed alumni gath
erings in Toronto and Mexico City,
respectively. Wilson spoke last September
at the kick-off for Stanford's 100 th year
when special postcards honoring Stanford
were issued.
Mulroney, who also serves on the
boards of several Canadian universities,
will speak at a convocation entitled
"Beyond Borders: Seeing the Whole
World." Former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz will preside over that
address, which will be followed by a read
ing by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Wal

lace Stegner. Stegner, a native Canadian,
founded Stanford's Creative Writing Pro
gram.
The next day, at a convocation entitled
"Beyond Schools: Teaching and Learning
Together," Salinas, a Harvard-educated
economist, will speak, followed by a per
formance by El Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford.
Both North American leaders are
active proponents of free-trade agree
ments with the United States.
Mulroney and Salinas will speak at
Frost Amphitheater. The third convoca
tion, featuring Wilson, will take place at
the West Portal of the Inner Quadrangle,

where Stanford's opening day celebration
took place 100 years ago. This convoca
tion will focus on Stanford in California.
The convocation will include remarks by
Dr. Louis Sullivan, U.S. Secretary of
Health and Human Services.
Also, the Centennial Office recently
added Bay Area news anchor Anna
Chavez as co-narrator of the Stadium
Spectacular with Nightline host Ted Kop
pel. Chavez, who anchors at KGO, an
ABC affiliate in San Francisco, graduated
from Stanford in 1976 with a degree in
communication.
The decision to recruit Chavez was
made after program organizers consid

ered the length of the Stadium Spectacu
lar, said Susan Wolfe, Assistant Director
of the Centennial Celebration. "It's a 90-
minute show, and it's nice to have a new
voice," she said.
Wolfe described Chavez as "extremely
active as an alum and supporter." The
Spectacular is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m.
Monday, Sept. 30.
A "Jane and Leland Stanford Look-
Alike Contest" is scheduled for today at
noon in White Plaza. The winners,
dressed up in costumes provided by the
University, will lead the procession in
Stanford's Sept. 29 Homecoming Parade
down Palm Drive.
