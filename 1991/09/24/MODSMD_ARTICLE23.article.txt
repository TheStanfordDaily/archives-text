### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Stanford Police and University
officials refused to comment fully
on a day long police investigation
conducted at a Casa Zapata room
yesterday.
"It's a very sensitive matter right
now," said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. "The police and
the University are conducting an
investigation, and it's very serious."
"We're dealing with something
that really could have serious
impact on individuals," Jackson
said, adding that he "found out
earlier in the day that there was a
very serious problem."
Three uniformed Stanford
police officers stationed themselves
outside a second-floor room in Zap
ata for most of yesterday afternoon
and evening.
One resident said the police told

him they were "waiting for a
search warrant."
At about 9:30 p.m. last night,
uniformed officers and Stanford
Police Detective Tim Frecceri
walked away from the room and
carried plastic garbage bags to a
squad car.
Jackson said he did not know
what was in the bags.
Frecceri declined to comment
specifically about the investigation.
"We can't comment because we're
in the process of doing what we're
doing," Frecceri said as he pre
pared to leave in the car.
Tony Burciaga, resident fellow
at Zapata, also would not com
ment. "It's a very sensitive issue,"
he said.
Jackson said he had spoken
with University President Donald
Kennedy about the investigation.
According to Jackson, Kennedy
"takes it seriously."
