## Booters take on St. Mary's 
### Uri Attia Staff writer 
Over the first part of the season, the Stanford women's
soccer team has exceeded even the lofty expectations
placed upon them by the NCAA. Playing what might be
their best soccer in team history, the Cardinal hjffi been
steadily climbing up in the national rankings and will play
a mediocre St. Mary's team today in a seemingly routine
effort to maintain their perfect 5-0 record.
St. Mary's, however, is poised for an upset, and histo
ry has given the Stanford booters something to worry
about.
"Over the past few years, we have played horribly
against St. Mary's," said senior sweeper Heather Mcln
tyre. "Two years ago, the last time we went to their place,
we were a much better team, but we played badly."
The Cardinal lost that game 1-0. The following year,
St, Mary's again turned its game up a notch against Stan
ford, but lost 2-1 on the Farm.
The dominating play of the Cardinal this year, togeth
er with an increased level of confidence throughout the
team, makes it appear as though this time, the outcome
will be different.
"The people on the team are really ready to go out and
play well for every game," Mclntyre said. "We are a lot
more confident than we've been in the past."
Junior Julie Foudy agrees. "Last year, we felt like,
'Well, it looks like we have the talent to win,' but now, we
know it," she said. "We don't need help to get up for each
game like we did in the past; we're just ready to go for
every game."
The sense of near-invincibility that has swept over the
team is certainly justified; Stanford is coming off shel
lackings of both Washington and Oregon State over the
weekend on the Washington State University campus,
where it allowed a total of five shots in the two shutout
victories.
Mclntyre feels that the key to further improving the
1991 Cardinal team lies in the shoring up of a few holes in
the starting squad. The fact that the team is an experi
enced one, with most of last year's starters back for this
season, shouldn't hurt either.
"Melinda Minstrell and Kristin Wair have helped us
out a lot," Mclntyre said of the two marking backs. "And
Leslie [Gerard, the goalkeeper] has done a great job for us.
"Other than that, we're basically the same team as we
were last year." That team made its first-ever trip to the
NCAA tournament, where it suffered a disappointing loss
in the first round. With the added experience and depth
on this year's squad, the women booters have good reason
to believe that they will improve on last year's tremen
dous season.
Before the team can look that far in the future, how
ever, they must get by a St. Maiy's team that always
seems to play that much better when facing the Cardinal.
"It's sometimes hard to play well against the easier
teams," Mclntyre said. "It's hard to keep scoring and scor
ing and not to relax against them."
Well, with the Cardinal putting the ball in the net over
five times a game this season, scoring has not been much
of a problem. Should the team keep up its offensive
onslaught today, another win and the end of the St.
Mary's jinx seem certain.
