# Look out, it's comin' 'round

While I was interning at CNN, Jimmy
Connors, Mike Tyson, and many other
inhabitants of the sports world spent
the summer in the Twilight Zone. In this
dimension not of sight or sound but of mind,
what had come around went around, and seem
ingly everyone got what they deserved.

It was about time for you, JAMES SCOTT
CONNORS. Any other 39-year old ranked
174 th in the world wouldn't even have shown
up and yet you won the tournament. Yeah, I
know that Stefan Edberg played brilliantly and
his name will be engraved on the trophy, but
who cares? When this Open is talked about,
that crafty old loudmouth who won everyone's
hearts will be the main topic of conversation.
And you've hardly mellowed in your old age,
Jimbo. Your language is as bad as it has ever
been, but suddenly you've got more fans than
Hulk Hogan (bear with me on the wrestling
analogies -1 was in Georgia all summer).
This startling swing of public opinion can
only be attributed to your recent vulnerability.
You're no longer the robot who ran down every
ball hit your way; now you're just a old man
who tries to get every ball but can't. You remind
us of how we feel when we play tennis; you get
frustrated and you hurt, but you keep on fight
ing. And we love you for it.
Hey ANDRE AGASSI — you certainly had
plenty of time to watch Jimbo's matches after
your first round disappearing act; learn any
thing, bud? You might want to rethink that
whole Image Is Everything philosophy —
maybe, just maybe, Trying Your Best Is Every
thing. I must admit that I was quite surprised
that you lost so early in the tournament, since
it wasn't even a Grand Slam final (choke,
choke, choke).
And speaking of Grand Slams, MONICA
SELES, how does it feel to have three-quarters
of one? I know that you may not have time to
think about it right now, what with your shop
ping trips and hair appointments, but I think
that one day you'll look back and regret skip
ping Wimbledon. Meanwhile, say 'hi' to Don
and Maria for me — tell them that the Hickory
Farms cheese log I'm giving them for a wedding

gift is in the mail.
Not to dwell on the subject of
food, JOHN JENKINS, but you
and your Houston Cougars cer
tainly had egg on your face after
the 'Canes scrambled your run 4 n'
shoot 40-10. It's not quite like
playing Creampuff State, is it
DAVID KLINGLER? Too bad
they didn't pure£ you by 100
points — I know I was hungry for
that to happen.
But other teams got their just
desserts this summer, right TOM
OSBORNE? Will you ever learn
that beating nine Pop Warner
teams by sixty points each won't
help your Cornhuskers against an
Oklahoma, a Miami or a Wash
ington? Every time I hear some
one talk about how great your
program is for going 10 and 2
every year, I have to laugh. Bobby
Bowden and FSU come up with a
similar record year after year, but
they play one of the country's
toughest schedules, not one of its
easiest. Is it any wonder that they
keep winning bowl games and you
have not beaten a ranked oppo
nent since 1988? I don't think so.
As for the Michigan game,
LOU HOLTZ, you and the Irish
might not want to play that for
the next couple years. It's kind of
different game when the Rocket
is on the squad from Ann Arbor,
isn't it Lou? Desmond Howard is
the most exciting gamebreaker to

wear that stupid Wolverine hel
met since Anthony Carter, and he
may well lead Michigan to a Rose
Bowl and national championship
showdown with Don James'
Huskies. One thing's for sure,
Lou — you and your Fighting
Irish won't be in the hunt.
And while we're on the subject,
TOM GLAVINE, I have to con
gratulate you and the rest of the
Braves for still being in the hunt
for a baseball October. Your
comeback from so far out at the
break was the most compelling
team story this season, and
though the more experienced
Dodgers may hold on for the divi
sion title, you guys have estab
lished youselves as the young
turks of baseball.
Your team's performance this
season, RICKEY HENDERSON,
has established you guys as the
old turkeys of baseball. It's hard
to believe that a team with as
much talent as the A's have had
in the past five years has only
won one world championship.
This year you won't even have a
chance to lose to an inferior
National League club in the
Series; you'll be home watching
the (just one more food joke)
Twinkies trying to take it all.
But I have no jokes and no
puns for you, MIKE TYSON — I
have only contempt, because you
are a joke, a joke of a human
being. Now I'm not naive enough
to think that men who are paid to
beat people up for a living should
be choir boys, but it would be nice
if you could maintain the minimal

standard of decency expected of a
human being.
I really hope that Evander
beats you on November 8. Boxing
is in a sad state already, it doesn't
need a champion in prison. Make
no mistake, Mike, prison is where
you will end up. Even if some
slick lawyer gets you off this time,
you'll mess up again — those who
don't learn from their mistakes
are destined to repeat them.
Tyson shook my faith in ath
letes, JIM ABBOTT, but you
helped restore that faith with
your incredible performances
both on and off the field. You
have become one of the top pitch
ers in the major leagues, and
someday soon people will refer to
you not as "The guy with one
hand. . ." but rather as "The
American League's ace lefty. .
You sign autographs for free, talk
with kids, and keep a level head
about your heroic efforts. You are
an inspiration, and it's about time
people stop seeing you as handi
capped first, great pitcher second.
Oddly enough, even I seemed
to get a little glory this summer.
After years of toiling away in
agony on the basketball court,
throwing up brick after brick, I
finally made two 20-footers in a
row (in a game, no less). And you
know I could have sworn that as
my second shot went through the
net, I didn't hear "swish", but
rather that eerie TV show theme
— "Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do-Do."

would love to crash on your floor.
