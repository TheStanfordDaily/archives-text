# Look out, it's comin' 'round

While I was interning at CNN, Jimmy
Connors, Mike Tyson, and many other
inhabitants of the sports world spent
the summer in the Twilight Zone. In this
dimension not of sight or sound but of mind,
what had come around went around, and seem
ingly everyone got what they deserved.

It was about time for you, JAMES SCOTT
CONNORS. Any other 39-year old ranked
174 th in the world wouldn't even have shown
up and yet you won the tournament. Yeah, I
know that Stefan Edberg played brilliantly and
his name will be engraved on the trophy, but
who cares? When this Open is talked about,
that crafty old loudmouth who won everyone's
hearts will be the main topic of conversation.
And you've hardly mellowed in your old age,
Jimbo. Your language is as bad as it has ever
been, but suddenly you've got more fans than
Hulk Hogan (bear with me on the wrestling
analogies -1 was in Georgia all summer).
This startling swing of public opinion can
only be attributed to your recent vulnerability.
You're no longer the robot who ran down every
ball hit your way; now you're just a old man
who tries to get every ball but can't. You remind
us of how we feel when we play tennis; you get
frustrated and you hurt, but you keep on fight
ing. And we love you for it.
Hey ANDRE AGASSI — you certainly had
plenty of time to watch Jimbo's matches after
your first round disappearing act; learn any
thing, bud? You might want to rethink that
whole Image Is Everything philosophy —
maybe, just maybe, Trying Your Best Is Every
thing. I must admit that I was quite surprised
that you lost so early in the tournament, since
it wasn't even a Grand Slam final (choke,
choke, choke).
And speaking of Grand Slams, MONICA
SELES, how does it feel to have three-quarters
of one? I know that you may not have time to
think about it right now, what with your shop
ping trips and hair appointments, but I think
that one day you'll look back and regret skip
ping Wimbledon. Meanwhile, say 'hi' to Don
and Maria for me — tell them that the Hickory
Farms cheese log I'm giving them for a wedding
