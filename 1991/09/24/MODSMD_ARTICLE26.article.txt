SECAUCAS, N.J. (AP) - We now
know who is on the greatest basketball
team ever assembled.
The first 10 members of the U.S. bas
ketball team that will compete in
Barcelona next summer were announced
Saturday by USA Basketball.
There were no surprises from the
names speculated on over the past few
months as NBA players are eligible for
Olympic play for the first time.
The players chosen for the "Dream
Team" were: Charles Barkley, Philadel
phia; Larry Bird, Boston; Patrick Ewing,
New York; Magic Johnson, Los Angeles
Lakers; Michael Jordan, Chicago; Karl

Malone, Utah; Chris Mullin, Golden
State; Scottie Pippen, Chicago; David
Robinson, San Antonio; and John Stock
ton, Utah.
Bird and Jordan were question marks
pending the former's back surgery and
the latter's demanding schedule. As of
now, they are both on the team whose
roster was debated about for the last two
years since FIBA's voting body over
whelmingly decided to allow NBA players
to participate.
Jordan said there was never any doubt
on his part.
"It was the decision I made and I
wanted to keep it low-key," he said. "I

knew all along I was going to play."
The only player omission which
caused some surprise was that of Isiah
Thomas. His being left off the team was
protested by Detroit Pistons general
manager Jack McCloskey who resigned in
protest from the 13-man selection com
mittee.
There had been rumors that Thomas,
the Pistons point guard, was left off the
team at the insistence of Jordan as part
of an ongoing feud between the two.
Jordan called that ridiculous.
"If I had anything to do with the selec
tion, my brother and sister would be
going to Barcelona,"he said. "Isiah

Thomas and my relationship had nothing
to do with who was on this team. That
was blown way out of proportion. There's
still a possibility of Isiah being selected."
Barkley said this is nothing knew.
"Someone is going to be left off, it's all
relative," Barkley said. "Look at all the
Olympic teams, someone has always been
left off who people thought should have
been on."
The team will be coached by Chuck
Daly of the Pistons and the rest of the
roster — two players, at least one of
whom will be an amateur — will be final
ized in the spring.
The United States has not won a

major international basketball competi
tion since the 1986 World Champi
onships. In the meantime, there were two
silver and three bronze medals as U.S.
teams made up of collegiate players con
stantly faced older, more internationally
experienced competition.
"I was disappointed at those losses,
especially having to watch those guys
jump up and down like they done some
thing special," Barkley said, "it made me
mad and I want to go over and play well."
U.S. national teams in the past had
been decided after a series of trials among
invited players. This team was
named by the selection committee
which was comprised of NBA and
amateur officials and coaches and
chaired by Kentucky athletic director
C.M. Newton.
Jordan, Ewing and Mullin were
members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic

team that won the gold at Los Ange
les, while Robinson was part of the
1988 team that won a bronze medal
at Seoul.
All 10 players chosen have been
NBA All-Stars and all but Bird were
on last season's squad.
The first appearance of this team
in competition will be the Tourna
ment of the Americas in Portland,
Ore., June 27-July 5, the Olympic
qualifying tournament for this
region.

"Coach Daly will make sure we're
ready and so will the players make
sure they are ready," Johnson said
referring to the short time from the
end of the NBA playoffs to the July 26
start of the Olympics at Barcelona.
Barkley summed up the feelings
of most of the players selected when
asked if it would be hard giving up an
offseason and devoting so much time
to the team:
"It's not often you get a chance to
make history."
