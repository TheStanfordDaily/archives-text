# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While Stanford students came back to the
Farm and got settled in for another exciting
year of stimulating academics and extracur
riculars, many athletes had more important
things to be concerned with than renting
refrigerators and paying for phone service.
Out in wine country, Dave Scudamore
was making tracks through the vineyard.
Here at home, Jennifer Jackson was pound
ing the competition with her devastating

kills at Burnham Pavilion.
Whether running short races or long ones,
in the heat or on the hills, Dave Scudamore
consistently leads the pack.
Saturday at the Sonoma State Invitation
al Scudamore clinched a victory in the 10-
kilometer race. The Stanford senior battled
the 85-degree heat to finish in 31:17. Scud
amore and teammate Fred Carter finished
over a minute ahead the rest of the competi
tion.
"Scudamore ran very well for the second
week in a row," said head coach Scott
Chisam. "(He is one) of the top individuals in
the [Pacific 10J Conference."
Last week at the Fresno State Invitation
al Scudamore finished fourth. Running
against the top Division II schools in the
nation, his 31:34 five-mile race was tops for
the Cardinal.
Scudamore should pace the team next
weekend as well when the Cardinal hosts the
Stanford Invitational.
When women's volleyball coach Don Shaw
signed Jennifer Jackson two years ago he
speculated that "she may be termed kind of a
sleeper," but he pegged her as an outside hit
ter anyway.
If Jackson was a sleeper then, she is cer
tainly awake now. Friday night she helped
the team stomp Arizona 3-0 with 11 kills and
a .421 hitting percentage.
Saturday night while most of the team
was a bit sluggish against Arizona State (fin

ishing the evening 3-1), Jackson was quicker,
more alert and more accurate. She racked up
another 11 kills, 14 digs and a phenominal
.524 hitting percentage.
"She is hitting amazingly â€” it's really
what we needed. We were missing another
outside hitter last year, and now we have
her. She's just great," said teammate Amy
Cooper.
