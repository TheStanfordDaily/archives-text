Shame on Denny
Green for putting
down our incompa
rable band.
Kudos to all you
frosh who have
already learned
when to jump dur
ing "All Right
Now."

Why did the Stair
masters get moved
to Encina from
Ford? The smell
isn't as good and

neither is the company.

Thumbs up to the
new women's gym
nastics assistant
coaches Lisa
Mitzel-Izzi and
Robert Shawler for
their killer condi-

tioning program. A sizzling dis
play of athletic prowess — coming
in December to a gym near you.

NBC's routine
"Notre Dame Sat
urdays" are really
unnecessary. Just
because they have

"Touchdown Jesus" doesn't
mean that they're holier than
thou.

Hats off to the Wash
ington Huskies.
Maybe you guys
should have a nation
ally syndicated Sat
urday afternoon pro
gram.

Jeers for Da Bears
for continuing to
allow William
Perry to live so

self-destructively.
Petty fines don't get through to
this big baby.

And way to go,
Patriots. Beating
the Oilers was
awesome.

Skyrocketing stu
dent ticket prices
are getting out of
hand. . .We aren't

even alumni yet
and already they hit us up for
money.

Boris Yeltsin, you
kicked some seri
ous junta butt.
You can hit us up
for money any
time.
