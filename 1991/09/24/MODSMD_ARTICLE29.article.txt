## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Game 2 of this weekend's NL
West showdown went to the Los
Angeles Dodgers, and it took a
stirring comeback in the eighth
and ninth innings to do it.
Juan Samuel ended an 0-for
-15 slump with a game-winning
double as Los Angeles moved
back into a half-game lead Sat
urday night with a 2-1 victory
over the Atlanta Braves. The
teams complete the series Sun
day when Atlanta ace Tom
Glavine (19-10) opposes Ramon
Martinez (16-11).
Los Angeles, which lost 3-0
Friday night to fall a half-game
back, trailed 1-0 before Mitch
Webster tied the score with a
single following an error by
shortstop Rafael Belliard.
Then in the ninth, Kal
Daniels singled with one out off
loser Mike Stanton (3-4) and
Samuel hit a 1-0 pitch to right
center field, scoring Daniels
from first as right fielder David
Justice couldn't cut the ball off
in the gap.
Roger McDowell (9-9) won in
relief of Orel Hershiser, who

allowed one run in six innings.
Atlanta grabbed a 1-0 lead in
the fourth on Terry Pendleton's
leadoff triple off the center-field
fence and Justice's RBI
grounder to third.
Veteran Charlie Leibrandt,
signed by the Braves for $8 mil
lion over three years last winter
as a free agent, kept the
Dodgers in check, taking a two
hitter into the eighth.
But the Dodgers, on the
brink of falling 1 1/2 games out
with two weeks left, came back
with a little help from the
Braves.
Samuel led off the eighth
with a grounder to the left of
Pendleton at third. He got in
front of the ball, but let it go
through his legs for an error.
Mike Scioscia sacrificed and
Belliard made a low throw to
first on Alfredo Griffin's
grounder to shortstop, leaving
runners at first and third.
Webster, a pinch hitter, then
singled for the tying run and
Brett Butler singled, loading
the bases.
But the Dodgers couldn't get

the go-ahead run then.
Leibrandt got Mike Sharperson
to ground to third, and Atlanta
got the force at home. Stanton
then relieved and struck out
Darryl Strawberry, ending the
inning.
Atlanta threatened to take
the lead in the top of the ninth
off McDowell, the third Los
Angeles pitcher. Pendleton
doubled with one out and Jus
tice was walked intentionally.
But McDowell got out of
trouble as Ron Gant grounded
out to third and Sid Bream hit a
grounder to shortstop.
Leibrandt wound up allow
ing four hits in 7 2-3 innings
with four strikeouts and one
walk. He had to be good,
because Hershiser, the 1988
NL Cy Young Award winner,
was back in form.
Hershiser, pitching for the
second time following a two
week layoff, allowed just three
hits, struck out four and
walked one. Jim Gott followed
for the Dodgers and threw two
hitless innings, striking out
three.
