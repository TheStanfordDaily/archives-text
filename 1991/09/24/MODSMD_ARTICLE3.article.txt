# Personal chefs in 6 houses sliced from budget
## 
### Sarah Morisseau Editorial staff 
For over five years, Jorge Alamal
has prepared delicious meals for Yost
residents right downstairs from where
students live. But after a recent cost
cutting measure by University Food
Service officials, Alamal will work in
the Lagunita kitchen and his cuisine
will be trucked over to Yost.
According to Shirley Everett, assoc.
director for university food service,
residents of Roth, Grove, 558 Mayfield,
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Yost and Murray
will no longer have house chefs prepar

ing the food. Instead, the meals for
these houses will be prepared by chefs
at dormitory kitchens and imported by
truck to the houses.
Food for the Row Houses will be
prepared at the Wilbur Hall kitchen.
The food for Yost and Murray, with
twice-weekly exceptions, will be pre
pared in the Lagunita Court kitchen.
This move, along with the layoff of
the manager of Row Food Service, was
done as part of a two-year "reposition
ing" plan to reduce Food Service
spending by $1.8 million.
The decision has left a bitter taste in
the mouths of resident fellows and stu

dents, upset with the lack of communi
cation during the decision-making pro
cess.
"The whole process by which the
decision was reached . . . was flawed,"
Yost RF George Homsy said, explain
ing that the cook is "a very integral
part of our community."
According to Homsy, students in
houses like Yost and Murray are on a
first-name basis with their cook, and a
change like this will make a large dif
ference in the spirit and atmosphere of
the house.
"One of the attractive features of a
house this small is a cook who is cook

ing for only 60 people," Homsy said,
adding that many students draw into
Yost for specifically that reason.
"The reaction has been negative
overall. There are about 20 returning
residents and they are all disappointed
because they know what they have
lost," he said.
Everett and Keith Guy, director for
housing and food services, were apolo
getic because they did not solicit resi
dence staff opinion and because the
RFs were never notified of the change
officially.
"We did not do a very thor
ough job of communicating. We
did not, for example, put some
thing in writing (to explain the
changes). We failed to communi
cate — I'll step up to that — and
in the future things are going to
be handled differently," Guy said.
"The RFs and other staff
should have been involved... but
that didn't happen and I am not
happy about it," Everett said.
After discussions with the res
ident fellows, Food Service decid
ed to alter its original plan some
what. Murray and Yost will con
tinue to have a cook on Sunday
mornings for made-to-order
brunches, and the traditional Fri
day night barbecues will also con
tinue. Food Service will be talking
to the other houses as well to look
into similar arrangements.
"We don't have any ax to grind
— they're going to give it their best
shot. But I'm very disappointed in
the process," Homsy said.
Neither Guy nor Everett could
specify how much money the
move would save, but Guy said
the savings would come from the
ordering and purchasing of food,
since now it can be bought in bulk.

Yost House residents angered by the transfer of their chef, Jorge Alamal, to Lagunita Court are treat
ed to a barbecue Alamal cooked up yesterday. In order to trim the fat from their budget, Food Ser
vice Officials decided to bring food into Row Houses from the dorms for most meals.
