# Unwanted residents of new dorm: ants!
##

As if to prove that even Par
adise isn't perfect, they arrived —
by the thousands — during sum
mer's final days.
"Ants — everywhere," said
Shiyama Rickford, daughter of
Kimball Resident Fellows John
and Angela Rickford. "They're all
over the dorm."
They came looking for water,
suggested Crane Pest Control
supervisor Cameron Nau. But
they found much more in the
plush rooms and corridors occu
pied by Stanford's most envied
residents.
Ascending the pipes that led
from the brand-new building's
foundation and crawling into its
bathrooms and bedrooms, the
ants left a trail of mischief that
included refrigerators, makeup
kits and pizza boxes.
Residents tried to deceive the
tiny pests by hiding food in clos

ets and atop stacks of boxes. But
the ants weren't fooled. They
found the food within minutes of
its relocation, forcing residents to
discard the food in bathroom
trash cans, where the ants con
verged in hedonistic gluttony.
"They're amazingly quick,"
marveled Kimball resident assis
tant Brent Holman. "They'll get
to an empty soda can in min
utes."
Residents found some relief
this weekend when workers
arrived to spray the small black
crawlers. But the ants persisted,
and workers said they may have
to resort to a poisonous bait.
Nau, who has worked with
ants for 27 years, said he wasn't
surprised that ants invaded the
luxurious 200-room dormitoiy.
"They're just like us — they try
to get into a nice shelter," he said.
The University "probably
should have fumigated the
ground before they built the
building," added Nau.
