# Biddle letter confirms his suit against University
## 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
In a letter released to the media yesterday, fed
eral regulator Paul Biddle acknowledges that he
has filed a personal suit against Stanford and says
that he was forced to do so because of the "contin
ued cozy relationship" between the University and
his superiors in the Office of Naval Research.
The nine-page letter, sent last Thursday to Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., was made available to
reporters by a staff member of the House Subcom
mittee on Oversight and Investigations, which
Dingell chairs.
Biddle is the campus-based Office of Naval
Research representative who has repeatedly
alleged that Stanford overcharged the government
by as much as $200 million during the last decade
for indirect costs of research.
After learning of Biddle's suit last week from a
federal auditor, University officials demanded that
the Navy relieve Biddle of his oversight responsi
bility at Stanford. According to University Counsel
John Schwartz, by filing what is known as a qui
tam suit, Biddle could no longer
claim to be impartial in his regula
tion efforts.
In a qui tam suit, an individual
may file for himself as well as the
government and personally receive
as much as 30 percent of the award.
As of Sunday, Biddle would not
comment to reporters as to whether
or not he had filed suit.
His letter to Dingell makes it
clear that he has done so.
Biddle says in the letter that it
was necessary to file suit because he
feared his superiors might be will
ing to negotiate a deal with Stan
ford that would permit the Univer
sity to repay less than the $200 mil
lion he says it owes.
Negotiating teams from Stan
ford and the Navy are currently

assessing the fairness of the Uni
versity's indirect-cost billings from
the last decade.
Biddle claims in his letter that
members of the Navy team have
displayed "incompetence and indif
ference," and are more interested in
"getting the Stanford action behind
them rather than providing the tax
payer a fair and equitable resolu
tion."
By law a qui tam suit is kept
under seal for at least 60 days to
give the Justice Department a
chance to review the case and
decide whether to join the suit. Bid
dle is apparently seeking the sup
port of the Justice Department in
forcing the Navy to take a harder
line against Stanford.
As of yesterday, it remained
unclear how the Navy would
respond to the University's request
to remove Biddle.
In his letter, Biddle contends
that an "extended period of victim

ization" by Stanford and his Navy
superiors has physically and finan
cially exhausted him and made it
extremely difficult to continue his
efforts to recover money from Stan
ford.
"One can only be flexed so many
times and then as with metal, an
individual will break," Biddle says.
"I feel God must have been working
overtime to allow me to contend
even this long."
He goes on to detail several
instances in which he says he was
intimidated by his superiors and
closed out of decisions he should
have been party to. In one such
case, he says he was threatened by
a superior with "being AWOL"
after meeting with staff members
from Dingell's oversight subcom
mittee.
Biddle also says he has spent
thousands of dollars out of his own
pocket to furnish his office and seek
legal advice. He says that Navy offi

cials have refused to assign addi
tional support personnel to Stan
ford in the wake of his allegations,
forcing him to work longer hours,
pay "larger and larger" day care
bills for his son and attend to the
"deterioration" of his health.
"These are part of the costs of
uncovering abuse," Biddle writes to
Dingell, "and I have borne them
gladly as they have allowed the
sorry state of affairs to move into
the light of day."
In March, Dingell's subcommit
tee held a grueling hearing on Stan
ford's indirect-cost practices at
which Dingell praised Biddle's
efforts at uncovering abuses at the
University.
Indirect costs are those expen
ditures necessary for conducting
federal research but not easily
attributable to a particular pro
ject. They include electricity,
maintenance and building depre
ciation.
