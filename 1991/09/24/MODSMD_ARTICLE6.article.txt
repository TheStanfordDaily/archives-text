A former employee of a day-care center for the
children of Stanford Hospital staff was arrested in
her home by the Palo Alto police Friday on charges
that she embezzled at least $3,200 from the center.
According to Palo Alto Police Detective Bill
Donnellan, the woman, Tammy Shipp, 23, was
arrested at her home in San Jose on one count of
grand theft. Donnellan said Shipp's arrest took
place without incident. She was booked and held
on $15,000 bail at the Elmwood Rehabilitation
Center in Milpitas.
According to Kathleen Ritchie, director of Stan
ford's Office of Child and Family Services, Shipp's
alleged activities "came to light after she had been
terminated [for] poor work performance."
Shipp worked for the Stanford Arboretum Chi
dren's Center from April 1990 until Aug. 30 of this
year doing accounting and collecting.
Soon after Shipp's departure from the center,
Diana Curl, the director of the center discovered
several checks Shipp allegedly made payable to
herself, according to Ritchie.
