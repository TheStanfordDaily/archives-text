# Artificial intelligence put to practical use
## Computer science class applies robots to everyday tasks

things, like how to make
machines play chess or prove
mathematical theorems. There's
been very little connection
between very high-level reasoning
and work that has been going on
in controlling machinery,"
explained Prof. Mike Genesereth,
who teaches the Computer Sci
ence 222.
In its second year of being
offered, CS 222 studies an emerg
ing field of research which marries
the "brainy" aspect of artificial
intelligence to the area of robotics,
which has been traditionally more
concerned with separate issues,
such as modeling the geometry of
the world. The merging of these
polar aspects of artificial intelli
gence and robotics research stems
from a mutual need between the
two fields.
"Two or three years ago, a
number of people in the robotics
world were finding that they could
not program the robots as effi
ciently as they would like to. Sim
ilarly, in the (artificial intelli
gence) world there has been the
need for realistic applications,"

said Genesereth.
As a result of integrating the two
disciplines, new perspectives on
problems are emerging.
"We find that many problems
become easier when you look at
the use of the brain to control the
physical machine. By actually hav
ing physical sensors, you can sim
ply (solve) some of the problems
that arise in high-level cognition,
and solve problems that we
couldn't solve before," he added.
Various problems with issues
such as cooperation, competition,
planning and decision-making are
tackled in the class both on a the
oretical basis as well as in actual
application in the optional lab sec
tion.
Students program robots to do
various tasks such as building box
assemblies and mapping out the
floors of a room using agents built
by Nomadic, a Palo Alto robotics
company founded by former Stan
ford students David Zhu and Jim
Slater.
One student in last year's class
went so far as to choreograph a
dance to Beethoven's Minuet in G
for his robot to perform.
As a final project for this quar
ter, the class will culminate in a
robot race that will span the path
ways of Memorial Court.

How does the robot know
where it's going?
"Each Nomad comes equipped
with a set of sensors which can
detect how far away an object is,"
said Zhu. "Some sensors rely on
sonar to measure distance while
others use infrared light." Stu
dents can simulate how the robot
will behave in its environment on
a Macintosh computer.
"This class is the only one that
makes robots directly available to
students with almost no prerequi
sites," said Genesereth, who rec
ommends CSIO6 plus a basic
understanding of Lisp as prepara
tion for the course.
One of the opportunities being
explored for further artificial
intelligence research is a project
called Design World, in which
robots assemble electronic equip
ment like compact disc players
when given instructions on a
workstation. Also underway are
plans to have robots construct a
building on campus in five years.
According to Genesereth, "In
the future, you can imagine there
will be autonomous vehicles, pilot
less airplanes and ships, and robot
couriers which run to the book
store and back."
Better warn the robot couriers
about the monster lines, though.
No, they aren't walking gar
