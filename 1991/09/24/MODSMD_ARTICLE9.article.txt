# Doctored maps confuse frosh
## 
### Matti Bunzl 
Late last week several fresh
men were confounded by a fake
campus map that located the
Quad where Wilbur should be and
had Lake Lagunita drowning the
faculty ghetto.
The prank, perpetrated by the
Hammer and Coffin Society, a
campus humor organization, was
quickly cleared when resident
assistants warned the confused
freshmen of the cartographical
impostor.
One hapless freshman, Ujamaa
resident Tumaini Rucker, was
about to attend a financial-aid
meeting in the Psychology Build
ing in the Quad when she realized
the map she was using would lead
her somewhere far away from the
center of campus. Only after ask
ing several people for help was
Rucker successful in finding the
Quad.
"I found the map on the desk
among some of the other orienta
tion material," Rucker said.
The clearest clue as to the
prank's originators is a tiny sign
in the bottom left hand corner of
the map. It shows the emblem of
the Hammer and Coffin Society.

Senior Celeste Campbell, editor
in chief of the Stanford Chaparral,
which is published by the society,
said her organization did distribute
some "old maps that were left
over" in some dorms on campus.
Several freshmen said they
spent up to 15 minutes trying to
figure out which map was right.
In disarray, several bewildered
new students turned to their RAs
for a word of authority.
Lydia Jones and David Wash
ington, two RAs in Ujamaa, each
said a number of freshmen
approached them Friday morning

in an attempt to make sense of
Stanford's geography. To avoid
even more confusion the RAs dis
played the fake map on a bulletin
board denouncing its validity with
the words, "This map is bogus!
Throw it away!"
Many freshmen, though, were
not confused by the false map.
Andrew Snekvik, for example,
had the bogus map sitting on his
desk for three days without even
noticing its flaws. According to
Snekvik, "I guess I was just lucky.
I only used the map in the Orien
tation program."
