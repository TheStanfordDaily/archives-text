# 'Repositioning'? How about 'axing'?
## Professors probe language of budget-cutting 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
"Repositioning." "Reshaping." "Restruc
turing."
The University's new three R's wax elo
quent off the pages of letters from the Offices
of the President and, Provost to the Stanford
community. But behind benign phrases like
"process of reform and renewal" lurk mas
sive cuts, loss of jobs and reductions in ser
vices. And everyone knows it.
So why beat around the bush?
"Let's face it," said Communication Prof.
Steven Chaffee. "What's going on is some

thing unpleasant, like excrement; something
we don't want to talk openly about, like sex;
and something we're getting hassled about,
like ethnicity. So we change the labels."
He compared budget-cutting euphemisms
to the etymology of the words meaning toilet.
Its original name, "trapper," became inap
propriate in proper conversation and was
replaced with the term "privy." Similarly,
words such as "reshaping" have not yet
taken on the negative connotations of "cut
ting," Chaffee explained.
Despite the use of euphemisms, Universi
ty administrators don't deny their intentions
to cut the budget, nor do they ignore the pain

it will cause individuals and departments.
However, they do attempt to paint the reduc
tions in a positive light.
In a statement released this summer,
titled "Stanford Beyond the Watershed,"
University President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse wrote, "These chal
lenges are also opportunities."
Opportunities?
"In general, every time you have a diffi
cult situation, you try to project it in more
positive terms," Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford explained. "But this isn't an opportuni
ty we'd run out and grab," he added.
In Kennedy and Rosse's words, "The
Stanford that emerges on the other side of
this process of renewal and revital
ization will look much the same,
only somewhat leaner and more
focused, and well-positioned for
continued excellence and achieve
ment in an increasingly adverse
environment."
By "opportunities" and "renew
al," University administrators
mean the occasion for introspection
and the chance to acknowledge
what programs are important. But
no one would deny that these
opportunities would be more wel

oome without the threat of the bud
get ax.
Chaffee compared the Universi
ty's positive portrayal of cuts to the
rationalizations of bitter lovers
after a bad breakup. "It's like when
you leave someone you say you'll
both be better off for it,"he said.
"Phrases like 'we'll be leaner and
meaner' are good for a football
team but not for University faculty
and staff."
However, Tim Warner, senior
associate provost and director of the
University budget, maintains that
the language is appropriate. "Fart
of what we are trying to do is
reshape and reposition — the words
are real. Reshape and reposition are

not terms that are used lightly."
Chaffee agreed that the nomen
clature reflects the concern of the
University administration. "The
decisions to cut will be made very
reluctantly. The people who built
these programs, who have been
nurturing them all along, will be
the ones who have to do the termi
nating. It's their baby too," he said.
"Not only are these terms
cooked up to make thingß gentle,
they're really felt," ChafTee said.
Still, he said, "It's like calling a
missile a 'peacekeeper.' I wonder if
anyone is fooled by it."
Psychology Prof. Lee Ross com
pared it to selling an item for 99
cents instead of a dollar. "You say,

"What a transparent ruse!' but the
person buying it will deny that," he
said. "The use of euphemism is like
that, sometimes it's effective, even
if you don't realize it."
There are no studies that say
euphemisms work, but Psychology
Prof. Herbert Clark, who studies
the psychology of linguistics, says
they probably do.
"What's revenue enhance
ment?" he asked, referring to Pres
ident Bush's innocuous synonym
for a tax increase. "The term passes
by a lot of people. It's standard
practice in government."
"The University can use reposi
tioning constructively, to eliminate
wasteful programs they wanted to

cut before but couldn't say so pub
licly," Clark said.
Rickford urged against drawing
a comparison between Stanford's
budget language and the doubles
peak of the Vietnam War when
bombing was called "pacification."
"I don't think there's enough
difference between the words and
what the words mean to see it in
such a negative way," he said.
But the impulse to invoke favor
able feelings about actual hardship
is nothing new, Chaffee said.
"When people make war on other
people, they say it's God's will." At
Stanford it is no different. "The
administration and trustees want
to be on the side of the angels."
