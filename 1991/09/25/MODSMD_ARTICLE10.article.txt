# New satellite dish will provide scientists more views of Earth

A valuable new tool will aid Stanford sci
entists in studying the mixing of fresh and
salt water in the Bay, investigating the
greenhouse effect and even reporting ski
conditions on area mountains.
By the end of October, a high-tech satellite
dish will be mounted on the roof of Herrin
Lab and begin receiving transmitted images
from two satellites belonging to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The dish — which differs from television
satellite dishes in that it can follow satellites
across the sky and correct for the distortion
that such movement causes — will aid
research in disciplines from biology to mete
orology.
According to Biology Prof. Jonathan
Roughgarden, the $70,000 satellite dish will
enable researchers at Hopkins Marine Sta
tion and on campus to receive and evaluate
between 10 and 100 times as many images as
they could analyze without it. Without the
dish, researchers must purchase satellite
images from other facilities for about $300
each.
Each purchased image is treated as an
"anecdote" or "snapshot," according to
Roughgarden. But with the dish assimilat
ing up to 100 images per month, scientists
can better evaluate weather patterns.
As a result, the new dish creates and
enhances a broad range of research opportu
nities. Infrared satellite photos provide

information on temperature, while conven
tional photographs show the physical
appearance of ocean and atmosphere.
Roughgarden, who spearheaded the
efforts to buy the dish and made a financial
contribution to its purchase, is investigat
ing how the larvae of certain marine organ
isms reach the ocean. He expects that data
from the dish will enable him to better
understand how underwater storms swirl
the larvae.
Civil Engineering Profs. Jeffrey Koseff
and Steve Monismith hope to learn from the
new images how scarce fresh water diverted
via deltas from California's Central Valley
mixes with the salt water of San Francisco
Bay, a topic that could have applications for
drought relief.
Roughgarden's team is preparing a soft
ware system to disseminate the satellite
images throughout the University once they
are available.
Roughgarden said the images will be
available "in principle" to the general public,
and no special precautions will be taken to
prevent outsiders from using the data
received by the dish. However, the Universi
ty will not provide an archival service, which
means that images will be erased after 24
hours.
Eventually, Roughgarden speculates, stu
dents may look to photos received by the
dish to determine whether there is enough
snow on the Sierra Mountains to merit
weekend skiing.
