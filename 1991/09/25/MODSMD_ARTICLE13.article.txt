Quebec may get recognition
TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney launched a new round in Canada's
decade-long constitutional debate yesterday
with proposals to recognize Quebec as a distinct
society, create an elected Senate and allow Indi
an self-government.
The Conservative prime minister presented
a 59-page document to the House of Commons
that also gives provinces a greater say in the
national economy, but gives Ottawa more
power to pull down intraprovincial trade barri
ers.
Quebec, which refused to sign the 1982 con
stitution, has long struggled to protect the
French Canadian language and culture in a
North American sea of English speakers.
PLO approves peace conference
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — PLO leaders
reluctantly endorsed a proposed Middle East
peace conference yesterday, but hard-liners
also attending a key Palestinian conference
urged Chairman Yasser Arafat to reconsider.
Nayef Hawatmeh, a hard-line guerrilla lead
er who has threatened a walkout if the Pales
tine National Council approves of talks with
Israel, said his fighters will battle on no matter
the decision.
"We pledge to continue our armed struggle
alongside the political efforts to end Israeli
occupation," Hawatmeh told the 450-member
Palestinian parliament-in-exile.
Israel has said PLO members and Palestini
ans from east Jerusalem may not participate in
the peace talks.
Violence mounting in Zaire
BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) - French
paratroopers seized the airport in Zaire's capi

rampage Monday in Kinshasa, the capital, clos

several months.
