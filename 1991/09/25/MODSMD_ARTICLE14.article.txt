DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) â€” In another break
through in the hostage crisis, kidnappers freed 77-
year-old Briton Jack Mann yesterday after holding
him for 865 days, and a Shiite Muslim leader said
an American hostage may soon follow.
Walking painfully and stooped over, Mann was
led by officials into a packed news conference at
the Syrian Foreign Ministry, where he angrily
denounced his captors for chaining him and order
ing him around.
"This morning I started another dreadful day. .
. . I wondered how many more months I've got to
stay. ... I wondered how much longer, how much
longer, how much longer. Wondering how many
more months I've got to stay here," the white
haired, former World War II pilot said in a hoarse,
anguished whisper.
"My voice has gone after 2 1/2 years of chain
ing, of saying: 'Do this, do that. Don't do that!' or
'Be quiet!'" Mann said, banging his hand on a
table to illustrate the orders from his kidnappers.
Asked if he had any news of the other hostages,
Mann said, "None at all." He started to continue,
but British Ambassador Andrew Green interrupt
ed.
At one point, Mann began a long explanation of
how he was kidnapped in Beirut, but Green again
cut him off when he started to meander. Mann sat
quietly while officials made speeches.
As he was led from the room, he appeared dazed
and disoriented by the bright television lights.
Two hours later Mann, looking frail but cheer
ful, was reunited with his wife, Sunnie, at the
ambassador's residence, and they left for the air
port for a six-hour flight to England.
Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister John Major of
Britain said he had heard that Mann was "a little
unwell," and a 10 Downing Street spokesman had
said the government was "disturbed" about
reports of Mann's health.
