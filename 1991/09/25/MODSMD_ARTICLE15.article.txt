# Japan withholding computer technology from U.S.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” More than one-third of
U.S. computer and semiconductor firms surveyed
by congressional auditors say Japanese companies
are denying them state-of-the-art technology, the
General Accounting Office said yesterday.
Of the 59 U.S. companies surveyed, 22 provided
specific examples of Japanese suppliers refusing to
sell them advanced parts or technology offered to
other Japanese firms or delaying delivery by six
months to two years, the GAO said.
And seven of the U.S. companies and two govern
ment laboratories surveyed said they were required
by Japanese suppliers to buy unwanted equipment
in order to also acquire the advanced computer
chips that they wanted, the congressional watchdog
agency said.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who requested the
18-month GAO probe, said the tie-in sales may be a
violation of U.S. antitrust laws and asked the Jus
tice Department to launch its own investigation.
"Withholding of technology by Japanese suppli

ers . . . helps Japanese manufacturers seize semi
conductor and computer markets from American
firms," said Bentsen, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee with jurisdiction over U.S.-
Japanese trade issues.
"This is a recipe for disaster which is rapidly leav
ing most of the U.S. electronics industry in Japan's
dust," he said.
Since 1980, the U.S. share of the worldwide mar
ket in semiconductors has declined from 57 percent
to 35 percent while Japan's share has increased
from 27 percent to 52 percent.
In 1990 alone, Japan exported to the United
States some $3.2 billion in semiconductors, the
devices that enable computers and other electronic
products to process and store information.
All six major Japanese suppliers of semiconduc
tor materials and equipment surveyed by the GAO
denied favoring Japanese buyers over U.S. and
other foreign companies in selling their state-of-the
art products.

However, a few of the Japanese companies said
supply shortages in their own country and tailoring
products to meet the demands of their own vertical
ly integrated companies may have delayed deliveries
to U.S. buyers.
Three U.S. companies said their inability to pur
chase Japanese technology cost them lost sales
ranging from $20 million to $1.4 billion. And sever
al of the 17 companies which reported delivery
delays of six months to two years said next-genera
tion technology had already replaced what they
ordered.
Government officials in the State, Defense and
Commerce departments as well as the Customs Ser
vice, U.S. Trade Representative's Office and intelli
gence agencies called withholding by Japanese sup
pliers a "fairly pervasive problem," the GAO said.
However, most of the U.S. companies do not
believe the practice is illegal, and even those who do
said they do not advocate any retaliation, the GAO
said.
