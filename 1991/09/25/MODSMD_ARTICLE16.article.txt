# Fighting resumes in Yugoslavia

ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) —
Battles between the Serb-con
trolled federal army and Croat
ia's forces marred a two-day-old
cease-fire yesterday, as Croatia
and its arch-rival Serbia each
demanded the other back down.
Croatia, whose declaration of
independence in late June set off
the fighting, demanded that the
army withdraw from its territory.
The president of neighboring
Serbia repeated his demand that
Croatia give up lands populated
by ethnic Serbs.
"If someone wants to secede
from Yugoslavia, I believe that
loyalty to the existing state and
the right to remain in it, is
stronger," Serbian President Slo
bodan Milosevic said in an inter
view with the British Broadcast
ing Corp.
"Thus I believe that the
Yugoslav authorities, including
the army, must protect all
Yugoslav citizens who want to
stay in the existing state," he
said.
Croatian leaders say Milosevic
is behind the current fighting
because he wants to extend the
boundaries of his own republic as

Croatia and its northwestern
neighbor Slovenia secede.
Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians
in a southern province of Serbia
said they would hold a referen
dum on seceding from Serbia.
Leaders of the Albanian majority
in the province of Kosovo said
they would organize voting on
independence starting this week,
the national news agency Tanjug
reported.
At least 100 ethnic Albanians
have been killed in the past two
years in clashes with Serbian
security forces. Milosevic last
year clamped down on the Koso
vo region, dissolving its parlia
ment.
Elsewhere, ethnic Serbs in
Bosnia were urged to stay home
for fear of Muslim attacks, and
five members of the eight-man
federal presidency met to discuss
tensions in Bosnia, whose multi
ethnic population includes Mus
lims, ethnic Serbs and Croats.
Both the army and Croatia
accused each other of breaking a
cease-fire declared Sunday in the
fighting that has led to more than
500 deaths.
"The army says the Croats

started shelling the barracks, the
Croats say, 'Gosh, no!' and so it
goes, to and fro like a ping-pong
ball," said Croatia's Information
Minister Branko Salaj, of fighting
in the eastern Croatian town of
Vinkovci.
The army launched its most
intense offensive of the conflict
last week following Croatia's
blockade of federal military bar
racks within its republic.
Air and tank attacks were
reported Tuesday in eastern Croa
tia, and Yugoslav Navy gunboats
opened fire on the Adriatic port of
Split. Fighting also was reported
in central Croatia.

John Gaps reported that Serbian
forces — backed by federal jets —
repelled an attack by Croatia's
militia using mortars and rockets
in the west-central town of
Medak. At least one Croatian died
and six were injured, he said.
Medak is one of a series of
towns around Gospic, the main
population center in the area 25
miles east of the Adriatic, that
Croats based in Gospic have been
trying to reclaim from the Serbian
insurgents.

Croatian artists cheer Monday in celebration of the latest cease-fire in Yugoslavia. Their joy was pre
mature, however; battles between the Serbian-controlled army and the Croats resumed yesterday.
