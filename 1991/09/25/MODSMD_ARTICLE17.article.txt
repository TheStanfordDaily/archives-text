# Cease-fire in Armenia
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Boris
Yeltsin scored a diplomatic coup
yesterday by arranging a cease
fire between warring factions in
Armenia and Azerbaijan. But
strife raged in Central Asia, and
Georgia's leader ordered a state of
emergency in the Georgian capi
tal.
Yeltsin and Kazakhstan Presi
dent Nursultan Nazarbayev
negotiated at least a temporary
end to the conflict in Nagorno-
Karabakh, which has claimed 800
lives and driven tens of thousands
from their homes since 1988.
Nagorno-Karabakh is a mostly
Christian Armenian enclave
inside Muslim Azerbaijan. The
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict
dates back centuries, but has
flared since 1988 when Armeni
ans in Nagorno-Karabakh
expressed desire to unite with
Armenia.
The settling of the dispute was
a diplomatic breakthrough that
had eluded President Mikhail
Gorbachev for years and was evi
dence of how political power and
credibility have shifted to Yeltsin
and the republics since the Rus
sian federation leader helped
defeat the Aug. 18-21 coup.
"We don't exclude the possibil
ity that he will get involved in
other places," Yeltsin spokesman
Pavel Voshchanov told The Asso
ciated Press, referring to conflicts
simmering elsewhere in the Sovi
et Union.
Georgian President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, meanwhile, said
he would clamp a state of emer
gency on Tbilisi Georgia's capital
today and vowed to oust hun
dreds of armed opponents who
have occupied the republic's
broadcasting studios since Sun
day.
Rebel Georgian National
Guardsmen captured four armed
supporters of Gamsakhurdia and
held them in the center.
Tengiz Kitovani, commander
of the maverick guardsmen,
claimed Gamsakhurdia's backers
were trying to provoke the opposi
tion, which is insisting that the
charismatic Georgian step down.
Opposition groups and West
ern officials claim that Gam
sakhurdia has acted like a dicta
tor since winning the republic's

first popular presidential election
in May.
Gamsakhurdia accuses the
reformist Moscow leadership of
plotting against him. yesterday he
singled out former Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevard
nadze, also a Georgian, of direct
ing the opposition.
Georgia is one of 12 Soviet
republics that have declared inde
pendence since the coup,
although only three of them —
the Baltic states of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania — are
expected to cut all political links
with the 15-republic union.
The diplomatic efforts of
Yeltsin and Nazarbayev embodied
the kind of inter-republican rela
tionship that reformists have said
they hope to establish.

Upon hearing news of the
Nagorno-Karabakh break
through, Gorbachev's new
spokesman, Andrei Grachev,
praised the "sons of perestroika."
But the spokesman denied the
two republic leaders had upstaged
the president.
"The fact that the two most
important leaders of the Soviet
republics are looking for a com
promise solution to offer to some
others . . . does not mean the
president is not functioning,"
Grachev told reporters.
Yeltsin and Nazarbayev had
persuaded leaders from Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-
Karabakh to meet Monday in a
neutral Russian town to discuss
the conflicting claims to the
enclave.
