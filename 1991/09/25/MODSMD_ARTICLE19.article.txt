## An unworthy nominee 
### 
Clarence Thomas does
not meet the standard
set by Justice Marshall

WHEN THURGOOD Mar
shall retired from the U.S.
Supreme Court this June,
he left a gaping hole in the nation's
highest judicial body. Quite simply,
Clarence Thomas cannot fill that
space.
With only nine justices sitting on
the Court, there is no room for a
lightweight. Yet, having been a
judge for less than two years, isn't
Thomas just that — a judicial
lightweight? In nominating him to
serve on the Court, President
George Bush defiled the position's
significance and apparently sought
to belittle the contributions made
by Marshall in his 24 years of ser
vice.
What's more, Bush's decision to
select Thomas smacks of the behav
ior Bush has fought so hard to
purge — adherence to a quota. It is
no coincidence that Thomas, nomi
nated to succeed the Court's first
black justice, is himself a black
man.
By choosing Thomas, Bush per
haps sees an opportunity to wash
his hands of any future obligation
to the black community. But if
Thomas' record of service at the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in any way reflects the
extent of his commitment to civil
rights, the black community will
only find disappointment in the
decisions of a Court that counts
Thomas among its members!
Nominees to the Court must not
be approved without sufficient rea
son. But all that can be said about
Thomas, based on his testimony at
the U.S. Senate Judiciary Commit
tee hearings, is that he has dis
played little in the way of convic
tions that might indicate a judicial
philosophy.
He contradicted his past writings
about the relevance of Natural Law
to the Constitution; most of his tes

timony concerned the teachings of
his grandfather; and on one of the
few occasions when he referred to a
previous decision of the Court's, he
couldn't even recall the name of the
justice who wrote the opinion.
The U.S. Constitution says jus
tices are picked by the president
with the "advice and consent" of
the Senate. To that end, the Senate
has just as much right to confirm or
refuse a nominee based on the
results of an ideological litmus test
as the president has to use such cri
teria for his decision.
With the ascension to the court of
four conservative justices in the past
decade, the addition of yet another
right-wing voice to a pool which
includes still two other conserva
tives would push the Court beyond
the limits of scholarly debate onto a
plateau of complacent consensus
dangerously inappropriate in a body
with the Court's obligations.
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote of
the need for a marketplace of com
peting ideas if truth is the desired
result. Nowhere is truth more
sought than in the decisions of the
Court. If there is to be any competi
tion of ideas, a liberal justice must
be chosen.
Presumably Bush will not make
such a choice, quite willing to suffer
the complacency of a court filled
with thinkers who share his incli
nations. And out of this rationale
an affirmative action argument for
confirming Thomas does develop:
Since any other choice of Bush's is
not likely to be more favorable —
on ideological grounds — why not
break the tie by choosing the black
candidate? By rejecting Thomas,
wouldn't the Senate be saying in
effect that in order for a black jus
tice to serve on the Court, he must
be of Marshall's caliber?
But that's just it.
To serve on the Court, a nominee
— no matter what color — must
indeed be of Marshall's caliber, a
principle the Senate must uphold.
And though Bush's next choice will
likely be just as conservative as
Thomas, if not more so, he or she
may well be more qualified. And if
not, the Senate should keep waiting.
