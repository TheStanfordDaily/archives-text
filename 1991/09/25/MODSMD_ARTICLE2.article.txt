# Students take role in budget process
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As budget-planners work to
resolve Stanford's financial crisis,
student leaders are trying to gain
a voice in a process that will radi
cally change the University.
Stanford is looking to cut
about $40 million from its $400
million operational budget during
the next two to three years.
Administrators have said that
cuts will have to be made in aca
demic as well as administrative
areas.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson sponsored an open stu
dent forum on the budget last
Friday and about 30 students
showed up to ask questions of
members of the various budget
committees.
Members of the Council of
Presidents, leaders of the ASSU
Senate and Jackson say they plan
to sponsor more student forums
throughout the budget process.
Some will likely be based in dor
mitories and others will be held
with larger audiences.
The COP will also sponsor a
student town meeting sometime
next week — probably Oct. 3,
although that date conflicts with
a scheduled faculty open forum
on the budget. Several faculty
members involved in the budget
process will probably speak, and
students will have an opportunity
to express their concerns, said
COP member Beth Morgan, a
junior.
After the meeting, a "core
group of senators" and the COP
will meet and prepare a list of stu
dent budget priorities analogous
to the one prepared by the Facul
ty Senate Committee on Educa
tion and Scholarship at Stanford.
This report will then be present
ed to members of the administra
tion in some undetermined man
ner, Morgan added.
"We have slightly different pri
orities than the faculty," Morgan
said. "For instance, faculty seem
to be more concerned about pre
serving the acquisition budget for
the libraries, while students are
generally concerned about access
for studying."
COP member John Overdeck, a
graduate student, said the stu
dents "must come to some kind of
consensus and make it public" to
add student insight to the budget
process.
The COP has asked the Univer
sity to delay the Oct. 17 announce
ment of budget-reduction targets

for the schools and administrative
units, but COP member John
Louie said it is unlikely the date
will be changed because it has
been set by the Board of Trustees.
Two students active in the
ASSU are already members of the
University Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning.
David Bradfute, a graduate sena
tor, and senior Solina Kwan, the
former senate chair, have been
working with the committee all
summer.
"We have been treated like full
and equal members of the com
mittee," Bradfute said. "We have
been given access to everything,
and there are many times when

others seek out our perspective."
Bradfute said during last Fri
day's forum that "although stu
dent input is valued, there has not
been enough of it because the bud
get process occurred over the sum
mer."
Students are also expected to be
involved in the budget process
after the reduction targets are
announced. At that time, deci
sions must be made on specific
cuts within schools and adminis
trative units.
Advisory committees within
these areas already contain stu
dents, and some deans and vice
presidents say they will establish
ad hoc budget committees that

include students.
For instance, students belong
to various advisory committees
within Libraries and Information
Resources, said Frederick Bieden
weg, assistant vice president for
strategic planning and financial
management.
But Biedenweg is still "con
cerned that students do not have
adequate representation in deci
sions being made."
Some COP members also fear
that the University might be
reluctant to release detailed infor
mation to students.
Jackson said he would like to be
"as open with the budget as we
possibly can about things that will

directly affect the students."
"Students should become as
educated as possible about the
issues," Jackson said. "They
should understand why the Uni
versity is cutting its budget and
what kinds of programs and ser
vices are under consideration."
People involved in the budget
process — including Jackson and
Bradfute — are concerned that
sensitive information such as fac
ulty salaries might be released.
Releasing the budget numbers
is "great if someone wants to get
really educated or if they want a
broad perspective," Bradfute said.
"But the people with only half of
the knowledge can be dangerous."
