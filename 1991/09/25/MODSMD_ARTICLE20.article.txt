A tribute to the decline and fall of campus radicalism

The prophets of american
decline have been taking some body
blows of late. The prestigious
French magazine of opinion,
"L'Express," sees America as the unchal
lenged leader of world developments and
credits George Bush with a "flawless"
performance in foreign policy. "Money
Magazine," after a careful investigation
of where is the best place to live on Earth,
declares the United States as "far and
away" the winner, with the highest stan
dard of living in the world.
The nit-pickers and sourpusses of the
Lewis Lapham and Paul Kennedy ilk
failed to take into account (along with
our obvious geographical and material
advantages) the spirit we inherited from
a long tradition, the kind of folks who set
tled here and the zest still in millions of
their descendants who want to help oth
ers along a free-market and democratic
way.
Of course, there are pockets of resis
tance and inertia scattered around our
land, but we are numerous and just go on
and grow around those laggards. One
woman, speaking on "The MacNeil-
Lehrer News hour" the other evening,
clearly represents a healthy majority in
her view that America, having lost its
number one adversary, has a meaningful
future in showing it and others the way

Let the dissident campuses and the faux
brillants 'intellectuals' seethe in their own
resentful juices.

to the good life of most of us here.
Ignoring the ritual bad-mouthing of
the liberals and "victim" groups, thou
sands of robust folks are already either
in, or on their way to, the former Soviet
Union to do their bit. A friend of mine is
retiring early from an executive position
with a well-known corporation in order to
advance computer technology over there.
I could see in his eye the old romantic,
adventurous sparkle that made this
country great. Another friend, a success
ful physician, is itching to go. Today's
paper (Sept. 21) tells us that 40 members
of a University of Maryland business
management team are teaching capital
ism at Far Eastern State University in
Vladivostok.
I like that: just go and do what's right
and let the dissident campuses and faux
brillants "intellectuals" seethe in their
own resentful juices. For red-blooded and
competent people, this is an exciting and
promising time to be alive.

I'd like to warn youngsters entering
college not to let themselves be infected
with the defeatist spirit characteristic of
radical opinion on many campuses,
including Stanford.
I know from bitter experience in my
own youth how virulent such resentful
movements can be, having been a young
Communist as an undergraduate at the
University of Virginia prior to World War
II (the war cured me, like most of my
peer-group). Boy were we wrong!
Nearing retirement from Stanford,
after 32 years of teaching here, I can look
back and see how foolish this campus was
to go so whole-hog for a new leftist wave
which has been discredited everywhere,
notably in Europe, where even Sweden is
emerging from a 60-year experiment with
Utopia. Cuba is next. It has become a
standing joke that the only Marxists you
can find these days are in Berkeley, Palo
Alto and a few quaint places also cor
doned off from reality.

The Russians, even Gorbachev at last,
have sheepishly admitted they were
amiss to cling to such statism, human
engineering, encouragement of irrespon
sibility and psychic immaturity. A sort of
Gorbachevism — remember how we
raved over him? — characterizes our
administrators and, worse, many of our
faculty here. We will be the last to admit
that, as Prof. Gordon Craig said, we
"took a wrong turn" back in 1968.
But the folds stood up to the selfish
Party hacks, the bureaucrats. They
swept them out. We have only started
that process here.
It will be interesting to see which
group — the trustees, the faculty or the
administration — proves most abject in
hanging on to an utterly discredited view
of what a university is supposed to be.
And can be if we have the soul to enlist in
the true global spirit of our time. Not the
abstract, left-wing scheme of internation
al socialism and pallid multicultural
mishmash, but the on-going glorious mis
sion of universalist Western civilization
— from Isaiah and St. Paul to Mother
Teresa, from Homer to Joyce — to light
the path to a decent life for mankind.

from Stanford on Sept. 23 after 32 years
of teaching.
