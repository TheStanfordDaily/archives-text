## Miodrag Perisic Clashes in Yugoslavia: a daily apocalypse 
### 
Three years ago, while
observing the 70th anniversary of
the creation of Yugoslavia, a wise
historian stated prophetically: "It was
Europe which was creating Yugoslavia
after World War I; it is Europe again
which will preserve it or destroy it."
Yugoslavia finds itself today in a situa
tion similar to the last few months of
World War I, but contemporary Western
Europe still does not know how to deal
with this red-hot territory so fertile with
the war virus.
Initially, the kingdom of Yugoslavia
was created in 1918 — a union of the
independent kingdom of Serbia with sev
eral provinces of the Austro-Hungarian
empire.
Enemies of this new state included the
military circles of defeated Austria and
Germany, and Bolshevik Russia. First
Lenin, then Stalin instructed the
Yugoslav communists to fight against the
new state, and even to ally themselves
with the fascists who were working with
the Croats.
The kingdom of Yugoslavia ceased to
exist when Germany and Italy occupied it
in 1941. A fascist state was created in
Croatia, while minor parts of Yugoslavia,
mostly in Serbia, were ceded to German
allies Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania.
A crime of genocide was committed
against the Serbian population, as well as
the Jews and Gypsies, in the two death
camps of Croatia — Jasenovac and
Gradiska — where men, women and chil
dren were thrown into pits.
With an oppressive policy in the name
of "brotherhood and unity," the ruling
communists in Yugoslavia succeeded in
stifling hatred and vengeful passions.
However, in doing so, they dealt a death

their histories, cultures and different faiths
forced them apart.

blow to historical justice by covering up
war crimes in the name of ideological
peace and new order. Consequently, the
process of denazification never took place
in Yugoslavia, as it did in West Germany
after the war.
After the fall of communism in
Yugoslavia, some republics declared
themselves democratic, while trying to
preserve the territories communism
granted them in 1945, when rulers drew
arbitrary internal administrative borders
— which were never recognized interna
tionally.
There are two reasons for the current
Yugoslav clashes. One is that the creators
of the first Yugoslavia naively believed
republics could live together when their
histories, cultures and different faiths
forced them apart.
The second is the legacy of communist
Yugoslavia: a mandate received from Bol
shevik Moscow with a communist pre
scription for resolving the national ques
tion, a mandate which hangs like a mill
stone on multi-ethnic states such as the
USSR and Yugoslavia.
If Croatian authorities claim the right
to unilateral self-determination, they
must grant the same right to the Serbian
people who have been living in Croatia
since time immemorial. The Serbs living
there have chosen to remain faithful to

Yugoslavia because the ethnic-based con
stitution of the Croatian state guarantees
them neither national nor civil rights.
The essence of the conflict is how to
set apart two nations which can no longer
live together. The Croats think the prob
lem can be solved by expelling Serbs from
their republic. The Serbs, on the other
hand, want to remain there, retaining
their status as Yugoslavians.
The war being waged there is out of
hand, so that the daily apocalypse pre
vents one from seeing a real solution: the
equal right of both nations to self-deter
mination.
The true horror of this war is the Ser
bian fear that history, preserved in their
collective memory, may repeat itself, and
the fear that they, deprived of the histor
ical justice they were entitled to, may
eventually take revenge on Croatia for all
the crimes that fascist state committed
against them in World War 11.
And so, the matter is in the hands of
Europe, which appears to be of two minds
regarding the solution of the Yugoslav
crisis. It is to be hoped that Europe will
not split again into two camps as it did in
both World Wars.
