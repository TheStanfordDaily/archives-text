## Undergrads go fishing for research experience with URO grants Peng investigates eyes, epistemology 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
How is knowledge gained? How do scientists know if
their theories are describing an event precisely and
accurately?
Senior Amy Peng had been asking herself these
questions for several years, so she decided to do some
thing about it. This year, with help from a grant from
Undergraduate Research Opportunities, she's trying
to find out the answers first-hand by doing research.
Her quest for a research project began last winter.
After looking up faculty research interests and con
tacting several professors, Peng met up with Russell
Fernald, professor of psychology. Peng's interest in
neuroscience was what initially brought her to the
Fernald lab; the people were what made her decide to
stay.
"I knew that if you're going to spend so much time
in the lab doing research, you've got to like the people
around you," Peng said. "I liked the people in the Fer
nald lab, i liked what they were doing and I loved the
fish."
The rest, as they say, is history.
Having received a grant in the late spring, Peng
began her work this summer in the Fernald lab. She is
conducting research on the eyes of Haplochromis bur
toni, a freshwater fish native to southern Africa. She is
investigating the rhythmicity of cell divisions in the
retinas of these fish.
"Unlike the human retina, which develops almost
completely in the embryo, fish retinas continue to grow
throughout the life of the fish," Peng explained. "This
provides great opportunities for investigating develop
mental processes."
To study the cell divisions, Peng is using a tech
nique known as autoradiography. This process
involves injecting a radiolabeled DNA precursor into
the fish. This radiolabel becomes incorporated into the
DNA of dividing cells and marks all cells that divide
after injection.
By injecting the label at different times of the day,
Peng is able to trace variability in the rate of cell divi
sion as a function of time.

"Right now, I'm working on a lot of controlled
experiments regarding the amount of radiolabel inject
ed into the fish," said Peng. "These experiments will
eliminate a lot of externalities when I interpret data
later on."
"I'm going to try to determine whether these fish
have a robust diurnal rhythm (a rhythm dependent on
a light-dark cycle) or circadian rhythm (a rhythm
dependent on an endogenous clock) of retinal dell divi
sion," Peng said. "I'm also interested in how this
rhythm is controlled.
"All of these questions I'm attempting to answer
arise from previous work in the Fernald lab. Of course,
they are of interest in the context of the larger question

'What controls cell division?' " explained Peng.
"Just this summer, I've learned a lot. One thing I've
learned is that research rarely goes as expected," said
Peng.
Despite all the trials and tribulations she's experi
encing as a researcher, Peng remains upbeat.
"This is one of the best things I've done at Stan
ford," she said.
Peng expects her project to last until spring quarter,
when she will make her honors presentation.
What's next for Peng? Perhaps graduate work in
neuroscience or medical school?
"I'd like to go to culinary school, specializing in Ital
ian cooking."
