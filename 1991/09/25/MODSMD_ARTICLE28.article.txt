# URO monies finance undergrad research, creative projects
## 
### 
Each year, Undergraduate Research
Opportunities (URO) awards at least 60
major grants (each up to $2,500) and 200 or
more small grants (up to $500 apiece) to
Stanford undergraduates. These grants sup
port expenses involved with independent
academic research and artistic creation.
Major grants are awarded to projects
which extend over three academic quarters
and "reflect the highest levels of creativity,
independence and promise of exciting
results," according to URO Director Laura
Selznick.
Last year, 299 grants totaling $271,000
were awarded. Students from all classes —
including the freshman class — received
grants.
Although the administrative aspect of the
program is funded by the University, all
award money comes from private donations
specifically designated for undergraduate
research.
The major grant competition takes place
in the spring. This year, there are two sepa
rate deadlines: students in social sciences,
natural sciences and engineering must
apply by April 3,1992; students in humani
ties and creative arts must apply by April
24, 1992. Students with interdisciplinary
projects are encouraged to apply by the
April 3 deadline.
In addition, small grants are also awarded
quarterly. The deadlines for this academic
year are Nov. 1, Feb. 7 and April 3. Addition
al grants aire available for minority students.
Applications and further information are
available at the URO office located in Sweet
Hall, or call 723-3828.
