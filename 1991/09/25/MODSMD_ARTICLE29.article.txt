# Soma studies relationship among hormones, aggression, dominance

For many years, researchers
have been trying to understand
the mysterious relationship
between the male sex hormone
testosterone, aggression and
social dominance. This summer,
equipped with an Undergraduate
Research Opportunity grant, a
few fish and some flowerpots,
senior Kiran Soma entered the
ranks of those researchers.
Soma, a human biology major,
is working in the lab of Russell
Fernald, professor of psychology.
He is studying male fish of the
species Haplochromis burtoni,
which will defend broken flower
pots as their territories. The
study is his human biology honors
project.
"Historically, scientists
believed that higher levels of
testosterone lead to increased
aggression and, in turn, greater
social dominance," explains

Soma. "But many studies failed to
find a direct correlation between
testosterone and aggression or
social dominance. Other theories
have since been proposed to
explain the relationship between
these three factors."
Soma is testing one such
hypothesis called the "challenge
hypothesis," which was developed
several years ago by a colleague of
Fernald's. According to this gen
eral hypothesis, testosterone lev
els correlate with male aggression
and dominance only during peri
ods of heightened conflict and
social challenge, such as initial
territory establishment or the ini
tial formation of a dominance
hierarchy.
Recent studies of primates and
birds have lent circumstantial evi
dence to this theory; however,
Soma will be the first to test
directly the hypothesis.
"These fish are extremely well
suited for this study," explains
Soma. "They are a highly social

fish, and they're easy to manipu
late."
There are two types of male
Haplochromis burtoni — domi
nant or territorial males, and
non-dominant or non-territorial
males. Physical differences in
their brains distinguish these two
types of males. But altering hor
mone levels can cause physical
changes in the brains of these
fish, changing a non-dominant to
a dominant and vice versa. Soma
is primarily investigating the
dominant males and how changes
in hormone levels affect their
aggressiveness and social domi
nance.
To test aggressiveness, Soma
administers what is known as a
"mirror test." He faces a mirror
into the tank, and the fish, think
ing that its mirror image is anoth
er fish, attacks the mirror. The
number of times it attacks its
image in a five-minute period is

Kiran Soma, a senior in human biology, administers a "mirror test" to assess the aggressiveness of a
fish. The number of times the fish attacks its mirror image in a five-minute period is a measure of its
aggressiveness.
