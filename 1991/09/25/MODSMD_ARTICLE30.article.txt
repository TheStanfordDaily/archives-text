# Word or Mac Write — which one's write for you?
## 
### Dan Cory Dave Galles Staff writers 
Stanford may consider itself a computer-lit
erate campus, but most students still use com
puters only for word processing and Tetris. So
what exactly do you need to write everything
from those weekly Freshman English papers
to your master's thesis?
On this campus, the choice is limited.
Although people with their own machines can
use Write Now, Full Write, Nisus, Microsoft
Works, Word Perfect or any of a dozen other
applications, most public computer clusters
offer only Microsoft Word 4.0 and Claris'
Mac Write 11, vl.l and sometimes only Word.
Many Stanford classes, including CSIC —
Introduction to the Macintosh, use Word.
If you want one of these two products for
your own use, cost is a mfyor issue. The book
store currently offers Word for $75 and
Mac Write for $55. Mac Write includes a free
upgrade to the soon to be released Mac Write
Pro. Word is also due for an upgrade soon, but
Microsoft rarely offers free upgrades.
One of the most popular features of word
processors over pencils is a spell-checker. The
Word spell-checker requires you to press a
button to ask for a suggested spelling and then
has trouble finding one if the error is in the
first few letters. In contrast, the Mac Write
spell-checker has a very clear interface that
automatically suggests correct spellings and
includes a window that shows the context in
which the misspellirrg appears.
Both products do a reasonable job at foot
notes, although neither makes it easy to find
the setting for switching footnotes to end
notes. Word requires you to see an dialog
box every time you add a footnote, but also
splits the screen so you can easily see both
footnotes and text at the same time.
In Mac Write, the dialog box is optional, but

footnotes always appear at the
bottom of the page.
Basic page numbering is no
problem in either program, but
students often seem to need
pages that aren't numbered for
cover pages, title pages and
other markers.
As long as you need only one
of these, both programs have a
First Page Special or Title Page
option that allows you to take

the header off the first page. Mac Write will
not allow you to have more than one of these
pages. Word will allow you to do so but
requires it to be page number one — a problem
if you want the first page to be a cover sheet,
not a title page.
Unfortunately, the best solution in both
programs is to use a separate document or
even a different program for your cover sheet.
Word makes it easy to change your margins
— you just switch to Print Preview, click the
margin tool and drag the margins to where
you want them. Mac Write, on the other hand,
only lets you set margins by typing in the
width you want. One unusual point is that the
inch on Word's rulers corresponds to an inch
on the paper but not to an inch on the screen.
This makes it hard to work with a wide docu
ment on a Macintosh Classic or SE screen.
For a student desperately trying to stretch
a paper to a required minimum length, a word
count feature is critical. While Word has a
count option on its menus, Mac Write requires
you to run the spell-checker. Either way, the
information is available but not as easily avail
able as it could be.
Word and Mac Write both offer the use of
style sheets to create standard formats
throughout a document. For example, all
titles can be in larger type and bold-faced.
MacWrite's style sheets do not include para
graph formatting, like double-spacing or mar-

gins. If you use styles exten
sively, this is a fatal flaw.
A powerful feature available
only in Word is table. This
allows spreadsheets or other
tables to be easily manipulat
ed. On the other hand, many
students find tables too com
plicated. Tables are very use
ful for one of the most com
mon needs of college students
— resumes. The style sheets

of both products can be used to build most of a
resume, but tables are helpful for aligning
things both horizontally and vertically.
Of course, all these powerful features are
only really useful if you can get good help.
Mac Write uses Claris' help engine, which lets
you navigate through a series of cards. You
can search through all the help text and easily
get to the help on using help if you need it. In
Word help, a similar structure is used, but you
cannot search it as easily. Word does have con
text-sensitive help, so you can get help on any
menu command just by pressing Command-?
and choosing the menu item.
Both products offer all a college student
might need and then some. Word's user inter
face has some problems, but they are working
hard on this, if Microsoft Word for Windows
1.1 is any indication. Mac Write suffers from a
lack of useful features, like full style sheets
and tables, but most of those are features that
few students use extensively anyway. Also,
Mac Write Pro will add many of the wanted
features.
Fundamentally, Mac Write is $20 cheaper, a
determining factor to many people. Its better
user interface is also helpful to someone with
no prior Mac experience. However, since the
campus has virtually standardized on Word,
this is a better choice for someone who plans
to be using campus clusters as oflen as their
home machine.
