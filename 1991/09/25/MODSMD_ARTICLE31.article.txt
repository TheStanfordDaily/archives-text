Brain research tops
Among the nation's large
neuroscience research pro
grams, Stanford is ahead of all
other institutions, according to
a recent survey by the Insti
tute of Scientific Information.
The institute, which con
ducts citation analyses, found
that among institutions pub
lishing more than 500 papers
between 1986 and 1990, arti
cles authored by Stanford
researchers were cited most
frequently by other resear
chers.
Articles by Stanford re
searchers were cited an aver
age of 9.44 times by other
researchers. The number of
times a work is cited by other
researchers is a common mea
sure of its worth.
Stanford was followed by
Washington University in St.
Louis, whose researchers are
cited an average of 8.81 times
per paper. Other universities
in the top 10 included Yale,
Cornell, UC-Irvine, Harvard,
Johns Hopkins and New York
University.
Unequal HIV risk
Women appear to have a
greater risk of contracting HIV
from men than men do from
women, according to a study
published today in the Journal
of the American Medical Asso
ciation.

Researchers at UC-San
Francisco observed that the
odds of a woman catching HIV
from an infected male are 17.5
times higher than the odds a
man will catch HIV from an
infected female.
In their study of 307 female
partners of infected men,
Nancy Padian and her col
leagues found that 61 women
(20 percent) contracted HIV.
In their study of 72 male part
ners of infected women, only
one male become infected.
Despite their findings, the
researchers urge, "Caution
must still be exercised with
unknown partners regardless
of their gender."
Huang is fellow
Stanford graduate Xiaohua
Huang was awarded one of the
first five Human Genome Dis
tinguished Postdoctoral Fel
lowships, the U.S. Department
of Energy's Office of Health
and Environmental Research
recently announced.
Huang, who received his
doctorate in biophysical chem
istry from Stanford in 1988,
was selected from a field of 42
applicants.
Huang will be working to
develop novel separations and
detection technologies for
DNA as a part of the Depart
ment of Energy's Human
Genome Project.
