Do you think Hubble would
thrash in his grave if he could see
the $1.5 billion telescope that
bears his name? I'm not sure he
would, but that's another column.
I know what Eddie's saying about

science, though.
As a science bug, I eat, dream
and breathe this great adventure,
aided by the leg irons at my lab
bench. My job as the new Science
Bug is to draw you in to this
adventure of science (minus the
leg irons, of course). I want to
enlighten, enthrall and energize
you with science.
All you have to do is bombard
me with those science questions!
Ask me anything you want to
know that even remotely relates
to science, and I pledge to provide
accurate, often bizarre answers.

Daily office.
Why does the Black Widow spi
der eat her mate ?
Let me just say this from the
outset: If you were hoping for a
grotesque tale of cannibalistic sex,
you're out of luck. Maybe you
should write me and ask about
the mating habits of the praying
mantis. Ooooh yuckkkkkk!
The Black Widow female,
which is about three times the
size of the male, is described by
most entom- (insect-) ologists as a

"shy and sedentary" creature.
While there are a few species
of spiders in which the female
devours her mate in the course of
intercourse (such as the female
AraneuB pallidus, who chomps
the much smaller male to keep
him from slipping off her during
sex — it's just a technical matter),
this is rarely the case with Black
Widows. However, if the male
courts at the wrong time — before
the female is ready — he may
become dinner.
So how does a male Black
Widow spider proceed to find a
ready female spider and couple
with her? Male spiders become
"men" after their final molt,
when they have shed their arach
nid skins five, six or seven times.
Unlike the human male, spider
males mature earlier than the
females, who are not mature until
after their seventh or eighth molt.
Before the male wanders in
search of the elusive scent of a
ready female, he must get ready
by filling his two palps (sex
organs) with sperm. To fill his
palps, a male makes a small, tri
angular "sperm web." Sitting
upon the web, he moves his
abdomen up and down to release a

drop of sperm. He then hangs
upside down on the other side of
the web and sucks sperm into his
palps.
Now ready, he approaches that
shy, sedentary female, checks her
chemical signals carefully (Unsafe
sex can kill a male spider.) and
inserts one palp, then the other.
After the act he makes off like a
bandit, while the female spider
retires to spin her pear shaped egg
case.
Regularly, a palp may break off
(OUCH!) inside the female. This
isn't a mistake resulting from the
male's speedy departure. Most
likely, it keeps the female from
copulating with other males.
Please don't try this at home.
Well, I hope that wasn't too
disgusting. Just remember, sex is
a natural process, and nature is
beautiful. I'm sorry, but I don't
have space to explain why the
Black Widow spider is so feared
among humans.
As a bug, I have good reason to
fear the evil Widow. But each of
you humans is about 200,000
times bigger than my worst
enemy! So don't waste energy
woriying about spiders; write the
Science Bug instead.
