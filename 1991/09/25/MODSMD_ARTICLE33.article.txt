## An Appleman a day keeps the defeats away 
### George Malone Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal
women's volleyball team is where
it is today because of attitudes
like senior Nicole Appleman's.
Appleman has been a vital part
of the Cardinal's winning ways
since her freshman year because
of her dedication and team spirit,
and now—after three years of
contributing off the bench—she
is starting on the front row as the
right-side hitter for Stanford.
"I've always thought, 'Support
the team, play my role well, and
try to contribute any way possi
ble,'" Appleman said.
In the past, supporting the
team has involved coming off the
bench onto the front row, espe
cially last year when she came in
for middle blocker Jessica Benton
in several games, including three
starts when Benton was injured
during the season.
This year Appleman has start
ed every game for the Cardinal,
adding to Stanford's already
potent offense. She already has a
total of 30 kills, 23 digs, and 15
blocks in only seven games.
"I'm glad I'm starting now. I
really like right-side hitting the
best. . . .Middle-blocking is the
hardest position, and I feel a lot
more comfortable on the right.
"I've been playing more consis
tently this year, but I'd like to

contribute more in hitting," she
added.
Appleman has been an impor
tant part of the Stanford scheme
so far, with her best game coming
against Arizona State last Satur
day. She hit an impressive .375
against the defensively-tough
Sun Devils, and she added three
blocks for good measure.
Another highlight this season
for Appleman was Stanford's
opening game against Colorado
State. She started off the game
with a great block against some
one whom she is close to, her
younger sister Carrie, a junior at
CSU.
"I was so fired up to play my
sister — it was my first time to
play against her because we
always used to play on the same
team. It made me more amped to
play Colorado State because it
was her," Appleman said.
It has been a long road to a
starting position for Appleman,
though. She was the first player
off the bench in 1988 and had 36
kills and 55 digs while hitting
.250 for the season. Then, disas
ter struck.
"When I came back after the
summer I was so ready to play. I
had had the best summer and I
was in great shape. Then we were
playing against Washington, first
Pac-10 game of the season. At the
end of the game, a girl who is
known for coming under the net
came under and my foot landed
on hers and I twisted my ankle.
"I was limping around and
playing for a while, and then I
injured it again during practice
down in UCLA and I was out for
the season," Appleman said.
After such high expectations
during the summer, being out for
the season was hard to deal with.
"I had never had an injury
before, so it was tough. I had been
so ready to play and now I had to
watch," Appleman said.
Since then, things have only

gotten better for her, including a
start last year where she recorded
her career-high of nine kills while
hitting an incredible .667 against
Washington State.
This year is shaping up to be
the best yet for Appleman and her
Cardinal teammates.
"This is a great group to play
with because of our chemistry. I
think our team is so team-orient

ed. There's no jealousy. For me,
these girls are the ones I would
call to go out with—they're my
best friends," Appleman said.
Does she think that this could
be the year when Stanford takes
it all?
"If anything is going to hold
us back, it's our team quietness.
Nobody is really vocal out there.
We have the talent and the chem

istry to win it all," said Apple
man.
And her personal goals?
"I want to go out with a bang
this year, play a lot, and move
on," she said.
Appleman and the rest of the
Stanford Cardinal continue to
defend their No.l-ranking
against the California Golden
Bears at Harmon Gym in Berke

ley at 7:30 tonight.
The match, which was origi
nally scheduled for last night,
was moved to tonight so it could
be televised live by Sportschan
nel Pacific. Plans changed, how
ever, and then the match was
going to be shown an hour later
on tape delay. The latest word
says that it will be shown tomor
row night instead.
