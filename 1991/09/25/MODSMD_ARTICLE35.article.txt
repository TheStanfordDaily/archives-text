# Coach the football team Denny, leave the Band alone
## 
### 
I suspect football coach Denny Green
has been telling his team some
strange things at halftime of their
first two games.
"Hey Bob Whitfield, listen, you're
doing a fine job on the offensive line, but
we really need your help in the second
half on tenor saxophone, they sound a lit
tle weak," said football coach Denny
Green. "Palumbis, you're going to switch
from signal-calling to snare drums, and
Ron George, we need you to go both ways
with piccolo and trombone."
"If you guys just make sure you keep
your matching wool uniforms on for the
entire second half, march in precise
straight lines, and stick to one really sim
ple song like USC's "Victory," there's no
way we can lose this game," he said, as
the players slipped out of their pads and
tuned up their instruments.
"Just be really non-controversial and
try to complement those swell yell-lead
ers. No beer drinking, fun, creativity,
Dolly dancing, or songs by the Doors. And
remember, stay off the field until the
game is completely over. If you guys can
execute, we're Rose Bowl-bound."
I couldn't tell that the Stanford Band
sounded any better in the second half of
either game, but the football team defi
nitely has been out of tune. Stanford has
been out-scored 42-6 in the second half of
its two losses and is on its way to yet
another "Yeah, but we are the best 4-7
team in the nation!" season.
Stanford football grabbed its first
headlines of the season, not with an excit
ing kickoff return, but with coach Denny
Green berating the Band in a pre-season
interview with San Francisco Examiner

writer Mark Soltau.
"I think there are going to be a lot of
changes," Green said, calling for a more
traditional band. "I think it (the fate of
the Band) is the Athletic Director's job. It
will be interesting."
Green's criticism ran on the front page
of the Examiner Sept. 6, the day before
Stanford's season-opening loss to Wash
ington.
Green timed his pot shot so that the
Band and students weren't around to
respond, and so that new Athletic Direc
tor Ted Leland would be put on the spot.
Either you're for the Band, or you're for
our multi-million dollar football team, he
was saying to Leland.
Since Green's outburst, the Band and
manager Jesse Dorogusker have had sev
eral productive meetings with athletic
department officials to discuss the Band's
role at athletic events. Green has left the
band negotiations to cooler heads in the
front office, and the "band controversy"
has cooled.
"They (the Band) have been very
amenable to our proposals, and we'll con
tinue to support one another," said Asso

date Athletic Director Tom Beckett, who
would like to see the band play songs
that increase the fan stadium spirit.
"I think Coach Green would like to see
the excitement and noise level increase
in the stadium," said Beckett. "He feels
we have made progress with the Band."
Beckett said the theme for the discus
sions with the Band was "students sup
porting students."
Coach Green, that's just plumb that
you're into tradition, but leave our band
alone and coach the team. Clearly, the
football team needs your guidance a lot
more than the band does.
Admittedly, the band has made some
well-publicized goofs in the past and
alumni often disapprove of the Band
satire, or at least don't get the jokes. But
the "students supporting students" con
cept should cut both ways. The Band
deserves support too, just like the foot
ball team, and it shouldn't have been
under-cut before the season began.
From The Play, Big Game, 1982, the
Band learned to stay off the field until
the game is over. And the trombone sec
tion has learned how to tackle.
Last year's un-PC lampooning of the
spotted owl at Oregon was not well
received, and the Band was suspended
for one game by interim Athletic Direc
tor Alan Cummings. At other times the
Band has gotten in trouble for dropping
its drawers on the field, excessive tail
gate revelry, and for being generally out
of control.
But rarely has the basic mission of the
band — to support the University and its
teams — been questioned by a coach as

Green has questioned it. Members of the
Band practice six hours a week, come
back to school early, follow the teams
around the country, and sit through
some boring games. In blowouts like the
opener against Washington, they can't
leave early like everyone else because
they have to stick around for the post
game show.
And unlike the players on Denny's
team, the members of the band aren't on
scholarship. For most, 'they play in the
Band because it is fun. Even though the
Stanford Athletic Department ranks
near the bottom of the Pac-10 in band
funding, has moved the Band and stu
dents away from the 50-yard line seats,
and banned alcohol from stadiums, the
Band keeps supporting the football team
and other Stanford sports.
For instance, last year when the band
was banned from football following its
Oregon show, it drove to Santa Barbara
for the women's soccer team's NCAA
Tournament debut.
The band is off the wall because that's
the way the students in the Band want it.
It reflects the creativity, verve, and
authority-challenging spirit of this uni
versity. If Green wants a "traditional"
band, he will have to go out and buy one
somewhere else, because the student
body and the Band are not volunteering.
Green's non-support of the Stanford
Band contrasts with the Arizona football
team's relationship with the U of A
band, "The Pride of Arizona." The foot
ball team changed the starting time of
the Stanford game from 7 p.m. to 3:30
p.m. in an effort to help the band. The

sun-drenched start allowed the game to
be broadcast on cable, and the team took
the proceeds — hundreds of thousands of
dollars — and gave them to the band,
which was strapped for cash.
The Arizona band is a nice band.
They wear matching red and white
uniforms and shine their instru
ments. They have cheerleaders, flag girls
and baton twirlers. Their half-time show
against Stanford was traditional, with
lines of musicians moving around in nifty
formations while playing a theme of
"summer" songs. I'm sure if you were in
Tucson for a game later in the year the
show would be about the same.
In the second half, they returned to
their seats and repeatedly played the
Darth Vader theme from the Empire
Strikes Back. I guess their team did have
us in a Vader-type grip on the field, but I
don't think it was because their band was
more traditional than ours.
Meanwhile, when the Pride of Arizona
finished its textbook halftime show, the
Band replied with "Touch Me" by the
Doors. Friday night our rag-tag Band
blared its rock-n-roil tunes across the
Arizona campus, while the Arizona band
was nowhere to be heard.
While the Tree played sand volleyball
with amused spectators, one U of A stu
dent came bounding out of the hydrody
namics lab (they have one there, really)
and said to me, "Wow, these guys are
crazy, but they're great. I wish our Band
were like them."
