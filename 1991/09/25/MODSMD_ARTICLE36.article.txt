# Booters use three-minute drill to destroy St. Mary's Gaels, 4-1
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
So much for the St. Mary's jinx.
Although the ninth-ranked Cardinal women's
soccer team has succeeded in mowing down its 1991
opponents with undeniable ease, they traveled to
Moraga, Calif., yesterday concerned about battling a
mediocre St. Mary's squad, and with good reason.
In past years Stanford has played remarkably
poorly against St. Mary's, splitting their previous
two hard-fought contests.
Fortunately, the blistering offense and impene
trable defense that have characterized the women
booters all season long showed up again yesterday as
the Cardinal made short work of St. Mary's, 4-1.
The victory pushed Stanford to a 6-0 record,
while St. Mary's fell to 3-3 on the season.
The Cardinal's season-opening six-game winning
streak is an improvement over a year ago, when the
team fell from perfection in its sixth game in a 1-0
loss to UC-Santa Barbara.
The Stanford team was given a scare early on in
the game as St. Mary's Lori Hokerson scored an
unassisted goal at 25:33 of the first half to put the

Cardinal in the hole, 1-0. It was the first time all sea
son that Stanford had trailed in a game.
However, the Cardinal was quick to bounce back.
Within five and a half minutes after Hokerson's
goal, the Stanford women put three balls past St.
Mary's keeper Nat Swanson to go up 3-1 and never
looked back.
["Their goal) really got us motivated," said mid
fielder Jen Gardiner. "We picked it up and scored
three goals right after 1 Hokerson's]."
Freshman Andrea Johnson tied the score at 1-1
when junior Julie Foudy drew the goalkeeper and
then crossed the ball to Johnson, who scored her
fourth goal of the season. The goal was scored at
27:46 of the half.
"(The goal) wasn't really up to me," Johnson
said. "Julie just took it to the line and passed really

well, and my job was just to put it
in."
Less than a minute and a half
later, the Cardinal struck again.
Kristen Wair's corner kick was
deflected by sophomore Sarah
Rafanelli to midfielder Jennifer
Potok, who angled the ball in off
her chest to put Stanford on top.
"I played the ball through, and
it hit Sarah and then hit Jen
Potok," Wair said. "She just put
it through a slit in the corner of
the goal. After the play, we were
like, 'Whoa! That went in!"
Despite the unplanned nature
of the score, Wair does not con
sider the play a freak goal.
"We've been working on crashing
the goal after corner kicks," Wair
said. "If you just get a foot on the
ball, anything can happen."

The Cardinal women weren't
through yet. Senior midfielder
Kim Petersen put the ball past
Swan son off a pass from Potok at
29:13 of the half to pad Stan
ford's lead to 3-1.
Foudy added the team's
fourth goal with time running
out in the second half with a pass
from senior Heather Mclntyre to
put the game completely out of
reach.
"In past years, I know we've
struggled against St. Mary's,"
Wair said, "but this time, we real
ly worked as a team and came
together."
Stanford keeper Leslie Gar
rard, who has not been given
much of an opportunity to dis
play her skills in goal due to the
sheer invincibility of the team's
defense, had another relatively
uneventful game in goal. St.
Mary's only managed seven shots
on goal to the Stanford's 31.
Over the past three games, Gar

rard has faced a grand total of 12
shots on goal.
"Heather Mac has a lot to do
with [our defense's success],"
Gardiner said. "She directs
everyone on the field and every
one feels confident behind her."
Gardiner adds that because of
both the team's defensive
prowess and the shadow of Elise
Edwards, last year's magnificent
starting goalkeeper, Garrard has
not received the credit that she
deserves.
"Leslie is very underrated
because of Elise," Gardiner said,
"but I think that she's as good or
even better than Elise was." If
the defense keeps playing as well
as it has, Leslie's ability will
remain a secret.
The Cardinal will try to keep
its perfect record intact this Sun
day against the University of
Puget Sound. Game time is 11
a.m. at Stanford's Harry Mal
oney Field.

For the first time this season the women's soccer team fell behind In a game. However, the suspense
didn't last long as a three goal outburst in the first half iced the contest for the Cardinal.
well, and my job was just to put it
in."
Less than a minute and a half
later, the Cardinal struck again.
Kristen Wair's corner kick was
deflected by sophomore Sarah
Rafanelli to midfielder Jennifer
Potok, who angled the ball in off
her chest to put Stanford on top.
"I played the ball through, and
it hit Sarah and then hit Jen
Potok," Wair said. "She just put
it through a slit in the corner of
the goal. After the play, we were
like, 'Whoa! That went in!"
Despite the unplanned nature
of the score, Wair does not con
sider the play a freak goal.
"We've been working on crashing
the goal after corner kicks," Wair
said. "If you just get a foot on the
ball, anything can happen."

The Cardinal women weren't
through yet. Senior midfielder
Kim Petersen put the ball past
Swan son off a pass from Potok at
29:13 of the half to pad Stan
ford's lead to 3-1.
Foudy added the team's
fourth goal with time running
out in the second half with a pass
from senior Heather Mclntyre to
put the game completely out of
reach.
"In past years, I know we've
struggled against St. Mary's,"
Wair said, "but this time, we real
ly worked as a team and came
together."
Stanford keeper Leslie Gar
rard, who has not been given
much of an opportunity to dis
play her skills in goal due to the
sheer invincibility of the team's
defense, had another relatively
uneventful game in goal. St.
Mary's only managed seven shots
on goal to the Stanford's 31.
Over the past three games, Gar

rard has faced a grand total of 12
shots on goal.
"Heather Mac has a lot to do
with [our defense's success],"
Gardiner said. "She directs
everyone on the field and every
one feels confident behind her."
Gardiner adds that because of
both the team's defensive
prowess and the shadow of Elise
Edwards, last year's magnificent
starting goalkeeper, Garrard has
not received the credit that she
deserves.
"Leslie is very underrated
because of Elise," Gardiner said,
"but I think that she's as good or
even better than Elise was." If
the defense keeps playing as well
as it has, Leslie's ability will
remain a secret.
The Cardinal will try to keep
its perfect record intact this Sun
day against the University of
Puget Sound. Game time is 11
a.m. at Stanford's Harry Mal
oney Field.
