## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The Stanford sailing team breezed to an encour
aging eighth place finish last weekend against top
collegiate competition at the Nevins Trophy Inter
sectional in King's Point, N.Y.
"We've sailed in this tournament for several
years, and this is the best we've ever done," said
sailing coach Blake Middleton. "We graduated most
of our top sailors from last year, and we have a very
young team, so I'm very pleased."
Stanford finished in the middle of the 18-team
field with 355 points. It was just the third regatta of
the fall season for the hearty Stanford team, which
begins regular practice this week.
This squad hopes to eventually match the suc
cess of last year's team, which finished the spring
season ranked No. 6 in the nation.
Six of the top seven teams nationally competed
at King's Point, with the crafty U.S. Naval Acade
my taking top honors at 179 points. Tufts, Old
Dominion, College of Charleston, the British Uni
versity All-Star team, St. Mary's (Md.) and Con
necticut College also finished ahead of the Cardi
nal.
Harvard finished well back in the pack in 12th
place, just ahead of the stealthy Christopher New
port team. Junior skipper John Emory and
junior Anne Luetkemeyer competed in the "A" divi
sion for Stanford, while sophomore Scott Sellers
and junior co-captain Geoff McDonald sailed in the
"B" division and senior Matt Sanford raced on the
"C" level.

Cardinal finish 8th in
East Coast regatta

Stanford opened the fall season with regattas at
Yale and the Coast Guard Academy, and continues
in two weeks at California's Stoney Burke Intersec
tional, Oct. 12-13. The sailers hope to qualify for
the prestigous Pacific Coast Sloop Championships
Oct. 26-27 and the ICYRA Singlehanded North
American Championships Nov. 8-10.
According to Middleton, the critical regattas for
the Cardinal sailors in the fall season are the
North/South Intersectional and the Stanford Invi
tational. The North/South regatta, hosted by Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, is one of the largest races on
Stanford's schedule. There will be competitions in
four divisions, "A" through "D."
The Stanford Invitational Nov. 9-10 will include
some of the best teams on the West Coast. The Invi
tational leads up to the sailing national champi
onships held in late autumn. The national titles for
three of the five sailing divisions will be decided in
spring competition.
In November, Middleton will coach the United
States team at the U.S.-Japan Collegiate Goodwill
Regatta in Tokyo. Stanford will be represented by
McDonald, Brady Sih and Matt Dunbar.
The fall season concludes Jan. 4 at the Rose Bowl
Intersectional, hosted by Southern California and
UC-Irvine.
