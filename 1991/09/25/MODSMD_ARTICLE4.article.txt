planning to kick off a new envi

combine hard sciences with more
policy-oriented courses.
Earth Sciences Dean Gary
Ernst and Biology Prof. Jonathan
Roughgarden have been develop
ing the new major, known as
Earth Systems, for the past few
years, and they expect it to be
approved this fall by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies.
Earth Systems is designed to
touch on many different aspects

resources to the greenhouse

environmental perspective, Ernst
said. "The students are only see

need to see it all."
The major will have several
core courses, titled Geosphere,
Biosphere and Anthrosphere.
Geosphere will be concerned
mainly with the earth, the ocean
and the atmosphere, while Bio
sphere will focus on climate and
population growth.
Anthrosphere will explore
man's place in the environment,
concentrating on issues involving
legal systems, property rights and
technological standards.
However, these courses can
only give a broad understanding
of the environment and students
"need more depth," Ernst said.
For example, dealing with "some
thing like deforestation would
require real expertise."
To convey this knowledge, five
advanced specialized electives,
