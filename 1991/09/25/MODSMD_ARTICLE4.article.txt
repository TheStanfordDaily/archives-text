# Major to link study of earth, humanity

### Mas Harntha 
The School of Earth Sciences is
planning to kick off a new envi
ronmental major this fall that will
combine hard sciences with more
policy-oriented courses.
Earth Sciences Dean Gary
Ernst and Biology Prof. Jonathan
Roughgarden have been develop
ing the new major, known as
Earth Systems, for the past few
years, and they expect it to be
approved this fall by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies.
Earth Systems is designed to
touch on many different aspects
of the environment, from mineral
resources to the greenhouse
effect, according to Ernst.
No current at the uni
versity shows students the whole
environmental perspective, Ernst
said. "The students are only see
ing part of the elephant, and they

need to see it all."
The major will have several
core courses, titled Geosphere,
Biosphere and Anthrosphere.
Geosphere will be concerned
mainly with the earth, the ocean
and the atmosphere, while Bio
sphere will focus on climate and
population growth.
Anthrosphere will explore
man's place in the environment,
concentrating on issues involving
legal systems, property rights and
technological standards.
However, these courses can
only give a broad understanding
of the environment and students
"need more depth," Ernst said.
For example, dealing with "some
thing like deforestation would
require real expertise."
To convey this knowledge, five
advanced specialized electives,
such as land-use systems and
engineering, will also be offered.
Senior Jennifer Fox, a member
of Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford, foresees great
interest in the program. "Even
though there are already a lot of
environmental classes at Stan
ford, they are all in different
departments. I think people will
be interested in Earth Systems
because it synthesizes everything
into one department."
Roughgarden agreed, saying
Earth Systems "is building on
strengths the campus has to
begin with," but brings them
together in a way never before
done at Stanford.
Based on his talks with stu
dents, he anticipates about 40
majors in the program. He said he
expects Earth Systems to attract
students who are "still shopping
for a major" or "seriously unsat
isfied with existing majors."
Some students said they are
excited about the way the pro
gram integrates both the social
and earth sciences.
Junior Jessica Moen said, "I
heard about Earth Systems about
a year and a half ago and tracked
it down because I wanted to com
bine interdepartmental majors
and . . . get a Bachelor of Science
degree that also includes my
strengths in policy and dealing
with people.
"You can go in so many differ
ent directions with Earth
Systems, from engineering to
straight science, or the public pol
icy and humanities direction that
I'm taking."
Earth Systems already has
enough money for at least the
next three years and has many
supporters on the faculty.
University President Donald
Kennedy, a board member of the
World Research Institute and a
former head of the Food and
Drug Administration, plans to
lecture in some of the Earth
Systems courses.
"I think [Earth Systems is]
very important," said Kennedy.
"It will be central to Stanford's
plan for environmental stud
ies.
