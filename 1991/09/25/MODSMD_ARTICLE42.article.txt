Elizabeth Traugott may soon
be going from Palo Alto to par
adise.
Traugott, professor of linguis
tics and former dean of graduate
studies, is one of four finalists for
the position of senior vice presi
dent for academic affairs at the
University of Hawaii.
"I've been here about 23 years,
and I feel maybe it's time to take
some of the things I've learned
and continue learning in a differ

ent environment," Traugott said.
"Hawaii is a university that's
growing and is particularly con
cerned with increasing its excel
lence."
Traugott said the position
would entail "system-wide aca
demic leadership and administra
tion" for the entire University of
Hawaii system. "This is a univer
sity system with 10 campuses,
and that's one of the things I find
interesting and challenging," she
said.
There is no parallel position at

Stanford or in California, she
added, because the Hawaii system
involves both research universi
ties and two- and four-year com
munity colleges.
"I think that there's a lot that I
can bring to the Hawaii system,"
Traugott said. "They're interest
ed in working on their tenure poli
cies and a system-wide under
graduate core curriculum, and I
am also interested in those
areas." She cited affirmative
action as another area both she
and the University of Hawaii

would like to work on.
Traugott earned her bachelor's
degree in English from Oxford
University in 1960 and a doctor
ate from UC-Berkeley in 1964.
She began teaching at Stanford in
1968 and has worked in the
English and linguistics depart
ments.
She was chair of the linguistics
department from 1980 to 1985
and was dean of graduate studies
from 1985 to last June.
Traugott said she visited the
main Hawaii campus at Manoa

last week for two days and met
with the president of the universi
ty, deans of the colleges, the
search committee, campus prov
osts, the linguistics faculty, un
dergraduates and graduate stu
dents.
She said she hopes to hear in
about two weeks if she has been
chosen for the position. If select
ed, she would return to Hawaii
for a final interview for the job,
which is scheduled to begin Jan.
1 or "when convenient," she
said.
