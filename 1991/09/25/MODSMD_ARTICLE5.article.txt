# World students find second home
## Reasons for attending Stanford diverse as backgrounds 
### Matti Bunzl 
For international transfer stu
dent Antonio Payano — once a
resident of one of the impover
ished areas in East Berlin — the
iron curtain had been lifted only
to be replaced by a curtain of
racism.
Born in the Dominican Repub
lic, he grew up in Germany. Liv
ing in East Berlin, he had to hide
in his home to avoid being beaten
up by right-wing extremists.
"There were swastikas on the
walls and nationalist extremists

were patrolling the neighbor
hood," Payano said. "It was so
bad that I didn't go to the [re-uni
fication] celebrations because I
feared my dark skin might get me
in trouble."
Payano is one example of the
great diversity of new interna
tional students at Stanford.
Assoc. Dir. of Admissions Jon
Reider, who handles international
applications, is very pleased with
the new group of students. "This
year's international class might
well be the largest in history," he
said, noting that the 70 new stu

dents — 60 freshmen and 10
transfers — make for quite an
impressive group.
Payano emigrated from the
Dominican Republic to West Ger
many with his aunt and uncle
when he was six years old. He was
later placed with foster parents
who refused to accommodate him
any longer after he graduated
from high school.
Forced to live on his own, he
moved to East Berlin during the
time of the re-unification of the
two Germanys.
In spite of his experience with
racism, Payano cherishes his time
in East Berlin.
"Being in East Berlin I could
witness many social and economic
improvements," he said. "It was a *
great experience to be in the mid
dle of a historical event."
After finishing high school,
Payano — who taught himself
English — attended the
Technische Universitat Berlin for
one year.
He is entering Stanford as a
sophomore with biotechnology as
his main academic interest and
also wants to get involved with
some of the drama groups on cam
pus. Most of all, Payano hopes to
gain some "really good friend
ships" on the Farm.
Asked why he picked Stanford,
the Okada resident — who never
saw the campus before he enrolled
here — said, "I got accepted at
Harvard, Princeton and Yale, but
none of them gave me enough
financial aid."
To Payano, a double citizen of
the Dominican Republic and
Germany, attending Stanford sim
ply means the fulfillment of the
"American Dream."
Ukhwesi Peters, a freshman
from South Africa, said his reasons
to study in the United States are
simple: "If I went home I couldn't
go to university, because I
wouldn't get a scholarship." Faced

1 got accepted at Harvard, Princeton and
Yale, but none of them gave me enough
financial aid.'
— Antonio Payano

with this alternative, the Ujamaa
resident decided to enroll in a pro
gram that enables South African
students to spend a year at a prep
school on the East Coast to pre
pare them for college.
Peters is convinced the year he
spent at a Baltimore prep school
was necessary to overcome the cul
ture shock.
Accepted to a number of first
rank schools, he decided to come to
Stanford because it "has a strong
international program. There are
lots of South Africans here."
Asked about his future plans he
said, "I want to go back, because I
want to help South Africa. The
way I perceive it, most South
Africans don't enjoy living in the
U.S. They want to go home."
Peters, who is ethnically mixed,
wants to return to South Africa
even though his status as a
"coloured" person means constant
discrimination in his country.
"Being 'coloured' means to stem
from a racially mixed back
ground," he said, noting that the
term was artificially coined in the
Proclamation Act of 1959.
"It is ridiculous," said Peters,
who was forced to attend a
"coloured" public high school open
only to students of mixed ethnic
identity.
Like many other international

students, freshman Rania Wazir
has experienced some major tran
sitions in her life.
Born in Lebanon, her family
moved to Vienna, Austria to avoid
the constant threat of war in their
country. Growing up in Vienna,
Wazir attended the American
International School, which tradi
tionally sends several students off
to college in the U.S.
Although Wazir never traveled
to the States, her mind was set on
attending Stanford when she was
just ten years old. "My Dad told me
that it is the best school, so I want
ed to come here," she said. Wazir,
a Soto resident, plans to major in
math or mathematical and compu
tational science.
Last summer, Wazir embarked
on a very significant journey
which led her back to her roots:
for the first time in twelve years
she traveled to Lebanon.
Fascinated and appalled at the
same time, she said she deeply val
ues this experience.
"I am not sure what I want to
do later, but... I might go back [to
Lebanon] to teach at the American
University in Beirut," she said.
If Wazir, Peters, Payano and
other international students do
decide to return to their home
lands, perhaps they will take a part
of Stanford with them.

students, freshman Rania Wazir
has experienced some major tran
sitions in her life.
Born in Lebanon, her family
moved to Vienna, Austria to avoid
the constant threat of war in their
country. Growing up in Vienna,
Wazir attended the American
International School, which tradi
tionally sends several students off
to college in the U.S.
Although Wazir never traveled
to the States, her mind was set on
attending Stanford when she was
just ten years old. "My Dad told me
that it is the best school, so I want
ed to come here," she said. Wazir,
a Soto resident, plans to major in
math or mathematical and compu
tational science.
Last summer, Wazir embarked
on a very significant journey
which led her back to her roots:
for the first time in twelve years
she traveled to Lebanon.
Fascinated and appalled at the
same time, she said she deeply val
ues this experience.
"I am not sure what I want to
do later, but... I might go back [to
Lebanon] to teach at the American
University in Beirut," she said.
If Wazir, Peters, Payano and
other international students do
decide to return to their home
lands, perhaps they will take a part
of Stanford with them.

Antonio Payano, who was born in the Dominican Republic and grew
up in East Berlin, is one of 70 new international students at Stanford
this year.
For international transfer stu
dent Antonio Payano — once a
resident of one of the impover
ished areas in East Berlin — the
iron curtain had been lifted only
to be replaced by a curtain of
racism.
Born in the Dominican Repub
lic, he grew up in Germany. Liv
ing in East Berlin, he had to hide
in his home to avoid being beaten
up by right-wing extremists.
"There were swastikas on the
walls and nationalist extremists

were patrolling the neighbor
hood," Payano said. "It was so
bad that I didn't go to the [re-uni
fication] celebrations because I
feared my dark skin might get me
in trouble."
Payano is one example of the
great diversity of new interna
tional students at Stanford.
Assoc. Dir. of Admissions Jon
Reider, who handles international
applications, is very pleased with
the new group of students. "This
year's international class might
well be the largest in history," he
said, noting that the 70 new stu

dents — 60 freshmen and 10
transfers — make for quite an
impressive group.
Payano emigrated from the
Dominican Republic to West Ger
many with his aunt and uncle
when he was six years old. He was
later placed with foster parents
who refused to accommodate him
any longer after he graduated
from high school.
Forced to live on his own, he
moved to East Berlin during the
time of the re-unification of the
two Germanys.
In spite of his experience with
racism, Payano cherishes his time
in East Berlin.
"Being in East Berlin I could
witness many social and economic
improvements," he said. "It was a *
great experience to be in the mid
dle of a historical event."
After finishing high school,
Payano — who taught himself
English — attended the
Technische Universitat Berlin for
one year.
He is entering Stanford as a
sophomore with biotechnology as
his main academic interest and
also wants to get involved with
some of the drama groups on cam
pus. Most of all, Payano hopes to
gain some "really good friend
ships" on the Farm.
Asked why he picked Stanford,
the Okada resident — who never
saw the campus before he enrolled
here — said, "I got accepted at
Harvard, Princeton and Yale, but
none of them gave me enough
financial aid."
To Payano, a double citizen of
the Dominican Republic and
Germany, attending Stanford sim
ply means the fulfillment of the
"American Dream."
Ukhwesi Peters, a freshman
from South Africa, said his reasons
to study in the United States are
simple: "If I went home I couldn't
go to university, because I
wouldn't get a scholarship." Faced

1 got accepted at Harvard, Princeton and
Yale, but none of them gave me enough
financial aid.'

with this alternative, the Ujamaa
resident decided to enroll in a pro
gram that enables South African
students to spend a year at a prep
school on the East Coast to pre
pare them for college.
Peters is convinced the year he
spent at a Baltimore prep school
was necessary to overcome the cul
ture shock.
Accepted to a number of first
rank schools, he decided to come to
Stanford because it "has a strong
international program. There are
lots of South Africans here."
Asked about his future plans he
said, "I want to go back, because I
want to help South Africa. The
way I perceive it, most South
Africans don't enjoy living in the
U.S. They want to go home."
Peters, who is ethnically mixed,
wants to return to South Africa
even though his status as a
"coloured" person means constant
discrimination in his country.
"Being 'coloured' means to stem
from a racially mixed back
ground," he said, noting that the
term was artificially coined in the
Proclamation Act of 1959.
"It is ridiculous," said Peters,
who was forced to attend a
"coloured" public high school open
only to students of mixed ethnic
identity.
