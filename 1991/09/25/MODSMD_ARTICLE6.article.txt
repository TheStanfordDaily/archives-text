### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Stanford Police are investigat
ing a female student's report that
she was raped in a University dor
mitory Sunday night.
"We are following up some leads
now," said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington. "We will pur
sue them until we are finished with
the investigation."
Herrington would not predict
how soon charges might be filed
against the alleged assailant, who
is also a Stanford student.
The University has begun a
judicial affairs investigation of the
incident, said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. He added that
Residence Dean Angela Rickford
has met with both the suspect and
the woman.
In a statement released yester
day, University President Donald
Kennedy said the incident
"requires me to make plain what
ought to be understood by every
one in this community: sex by force
or coercion, including coercion
through the use of alcohol, is abso
lutely unacceptable here."
The assault allegedly occurred
in a room in Casa Zapata after a
house party Sunday night, Jackson
said. According to Herrington, the
police received a call from the
woman shortly before noon Mon
day. They then began investigating
the case.
Several Zapata residents
refused to comment about the
investigation.
"(The residents) are respecting
the sensitivity of the issue and the
privacy of those individuals con
cerned," said Zapata Resident Fel
low Tony Burciaga.
Burciaga said the police investi
gation was discussed at hall meet
ings Monday night. He added that
the meetings had already been

Office are investig

scheduled, but the topic of the
investigation "came up as a matter
of information."
During most of Monday after
noon and evening, three uniformed
Stanford police officers were sta
tioned outside the room. The offi
cers were waiting for a search war
rant, Herrington said.
At about 9:30 p.m. Monday
night, after receiving the warrant,
uniformed officers and Stanford
Police Detective Tim Frecceri
entered the room, removed the
sheets and pillowcases from one of
the beds, and carried them in plas
tic garbage bags to a squad car.
Jackson said the University has
offered several institutional sup
ports to the woman â€” through her
residence, the Cowell Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team and
the Dean of Students Office.
Kennedy's statement warned
that "those who are found in viola
tion of University policy [on sexual
assault] will face maximum institu
tional sanctions, in addition to any
prosecution the District Attorney
may undertake through the courts."
Burciaga said some racially ori
ented comments had already
resulted from early reports of the
incident, and that he feared fur
ther unfounded comments would
be made because Zapata is the
Mexican-American theme house.
Burciaga added that neither
student involved was Mexican-
American.
