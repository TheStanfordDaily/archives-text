Less than a week before the Centennial
Finale in Stanford Stadium, more than
25,000 tickets are left unsold.
But promoters hope the 13,000 students
and the faculty who have been arriving dur
ing the last week will help buy the remain
ing tickets.
"This is the week where we'll start our
push to have the returning students and
faculty buy the remaining tickets," said
Gary Cavalli, whose firm is responsible for
promoting this event. He expects from
30,000 to 40,000 people to attend Stan
ford's 100 th birthday party.
"Nobody is selling out these days. It's a
poor year for concert tickets and other

events," said Cavalli.
But according to Susan Wolfe, assistant
director of the Centennial Celebration,
ticket sales are moving as expected. She
said she is delighted that thousands have
already been sold.
Stanford has sold 2,000 Centennial Cir
cle tickets at $100 each, 9,000 general
admission tickets at $25 each, 600-700 at
the group rate of $20 each and 6,800 for the
$15 price offered to all Stanford students,
faculty and staff. The stadium normally
has a capacity of about 86,000 people. For
this event, however, the stadium has been
configured to hold about 45,000 people.
Wolfe said she did not think Stanford's
negative publicity from the indirect-cost
controversy had any effect on ticket sales.
