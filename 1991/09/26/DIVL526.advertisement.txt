Linguistics Y 50: Introduction to Sociolinguistics.
4-6 units, TTh 11-12:30, 90-91 A
Sociolinguistics looks at diversity in language use: linguistic differences
between men and women, racial and ethnic groups, social classes, dialect
regions, etc. It examines public policy issues such as bilingual education and
the status of linguistic minorities. For additional units, students have the
option of doing a public service internship in relevant areas, such as tutoring
children from linguistic minority backgrounds, or working with immigrant
groups. Fulfills DR 9 (old area 5).
