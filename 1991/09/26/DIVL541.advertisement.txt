RECYCLE
Last year, Stanford University recycled
more than 2,400 tons of glass, aluminum,
steel, plastic & paper. Please help us recycle
even more this Year!
Here's What You Can Do:
► RECYCLE YOUR CARDBOARD MOVING BOXES by flattening them and depositing
them in the green dumpsters.
» USE THE GREEN BARRELS for glass, cans, newspaper, and junk mail located in every
student residence.
» LEARN WHAT MATERIALS CAN BE RECYCLED by asking your residence staff &
Environmental Representatives, looking for signs by the barrels, and calling US!
» VOLUNTEER your time at the Recycling Center, or apply for one of our paid
positions (6.62/ hr.) doing collection & processing of recycled material.
• PARTICIPATE IN AUTUMN RESIDENCE RECYCLING CONTEST, held
Oct. 1-Nov. 30. Get psyched for study break prizes for your residence!
Because if you're not recycling, you're
throwing it all away.
