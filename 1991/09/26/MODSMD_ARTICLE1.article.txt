## Disabled workers aid busy Bookstore 
### Jennifer Angel 
Long lines at the Bookstore
would be even longer if 13
mentally disabled workers
weren't lending a hand.
Continuing a five-year tra
dition, the Bookstore has
teamed up with Miramonte, a
private, nonprofit mental
health services agency in Palo
Alto, to provide some of the
agency's mentally disabled
clients with full-time work.
The temporary workers
check in student bags outside
the Bookstore's front entrance
during the early-quarter,
high-volume purchasing peri
od.
Miramonte supervisor
Michael Mitchell, who over
sees backpack checking, said
students have commented
favorably on the effort to hire
mentally disabled workers.
According to Mitchell, work at
the bookstore enhances self
esteem and helps develop a
sense of responsibility in the
men and women.
Karen Oakley, who helps
coordinate vocational training
for Miramonte, said she hopes
this kind of employment will
eventually make it possible for
the clients to gain employment
in the competitive market
place away from campus.
One man checking back
packs, who declined to give his
name, said, "It's good work."
Mitchell noted that Mir
amonte's collaboration with
the Bookstore serves to par
tially fill the gap left by budget
cuts in government-funded
mental health care programs.
