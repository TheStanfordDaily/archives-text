UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Bush administration charged Yugo
slavia's military yesterday with unac
ceptable aggression against separa
tionist Croatia, causing death to citizens
it is constitutionally supposed to pro
tect.
"A lot of blood has already been lost,
but it is time for all parties to commit
themselves to resolve their differences
in the future in a peaceful way,"
Secretary of State James Baker told an
extraordinary meeting of the United
Nations Security Council.
"All parties, especially the Serbs and
Croats need to stop the fighting," he
said.
While the United States appreciates
the concern of Serbs about their future
in the event of Yugoslavia's disintegra
tion, Baker said, "We cannot and will
not accept repression and the use of
force in the name of those concerns."
In exceptionally strong terms, Baker
said the government of Serbia and the
Yugoslav federal military "bear a special

and indeed growing responsibility for
the grim future which awaits the people
of Yugoslavia if they do not stop the
bloodshed and reverse the violent course
now being pursued."
The Security Council session was
called to approve an arms cutoff to
Yugoslavia and all factions that have
brought the country to the verge of civil
war.
"The aggression within Yugoslavia . .
. represents a direct threat to interna
tional peace and security," Baker said as
the Bush administration set aside diplo
matic understatement to register unmis
takable disapproval of the drive against
Croatia.
"This crisis in Yugoslavia has
descended into open warfare," Baker
said. "This violent conflict threatens all
the peoples of Yugoslavia with terrible
economic and social strife, with a sharp
deterioration in the most fundamental
human rights and freedoms and, above
all, with massive bloodshed and loss of
life."
