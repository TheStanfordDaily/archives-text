# Poll: Soviet anti-Semitism up
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — More than half of the
4,200 Soviets polled want all Jews to leave
the country, according to the results of a sur
vey released yesterday at the Soviet Union's
first international conference on anti-
Semitism.
The poll's results reflect the conclusion of
more than a dozen speakers at the confer
ence: Anti-Semitism is becoming more ram
pant as the country moves from communism
to democracy.
"It is not the totalitarian anti-Semitism
which we're used to and which was hypocrit
ical. Now, it is open anti-Semitism," said Dr.
Michael Chlenov, co-president of Va'ad, the
confederation of Soviet Jewish organizations
and communities which sponsored the con
ference, attended by about 200 people.
Vladimir Shapiro, a professor at the
Institute of Sociology in Moscow and head of
the Jewish Scientific Center, which conduct
ed the poll, said the results indicate that anti-

Semitism has reached a "very alarming"
level.
No margin of error was provided, and the
polling methods were not discussed. Because
of the poor Soviet telephone system and lack
of phone books, most polling in the Soviet
Union is done face to face on the street.
Mark Krasnoselsky, who monitors anti-
Semitism in the Soviet media, said attacks on
Jews have increased. From 50 to 70 publica
tions in Moscow alone preach hatred of Jews.
Yuri Sokol, speaking on behalf of Soviet
Jewish veterans and victims of concentration
camps, said that Jews are being blamed for
everything, including the country's economic
problems and widespread food shortages.
Irwin Cotler, a Canadian Jewish leader
and law professor at McGill University,
added: "The extreme Russian right blames
the Jews for bringing about communism, and
the old communist left blames the Jews for
bringing about the downfall of communism."
