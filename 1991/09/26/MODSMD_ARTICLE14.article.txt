## Picks and Pans 
### 
NOW THAT CLASSES HAVE STARTED and everyone is settling
in, it's time to take a closer look at all the little quirks at Stan
ford. Some surprises have proven quite pleasant, while a few old
menaces have stubbornly held fast. Here are a few of both for the bene
fit of those who will encounter them and for those who can change or
keep them:

PICKS:
14. The brief, but awesome thun
der and lightening show. (It never
storms in California. See also pan
3.) To all those freshmen from the
East who thought they had escaped
lousy weather: Don't worry, you
have. The drought of the past four
years continues (see pan 7).
13. Biking beneath the portals in
the Quad (those two towers on
either side that have been sur
rounded by menacing chain link
fences since the little "Big One").
12. A la carte food service in
Stern which means....
11. Burger and fry bar every day
(see pan 10).
10. The new Peak Performance
Eating Club at Toyon (see pan 9).
9. New meal card pictures for
everyone. Seniors will no longer
look like freshmen (see pan 4).
8. Rumor the fountains may be
turned on for the Centenhial.
7. Stanford is finally in the triple
digits (eat your heart out, Harvard.
Also, see pan 6).
6. The perfect way to celebrate
the Centennial: no classes Monday
and Tuesday (see pans 5 and 14).
5. Hotel Kimball (see pan 11).
Poor Manzanita keeps looking
worse and worse.
4. The ability to drop a class, no
questions asked, up to 24 hours
before the final (see pan 5).
3. President Kennedy going Green.
2. A new admissions dean prime
for Gaieties; "My name is Jim Mon
toya, you killed my freshman, pre
pare to die."
1. The number one Pick of the
1991-92 academic year is an old,
reliable friend; you can't get an F no
matter how hard you try (see pan 5).

PANS:
14. Study list due before Mon
day and Tuesday classes are ever
held.
13. Freshmen who don't know
that brakes don't work in the rain.
12. No provision for students who
had to move out of one residence
into another between quarters.
11. Hotel Kimball's ant farm.
Nothing's perfect, right?
10. Burger and fry bar every day
and no more veggie line.
9. The new Peak Performance
Eating Club at Toyon. Fruit and ...
what's that other word; it's on the
tip off my tongue?
8. "Stadium Spectacular" ... a
bit much, isn't it? Where are the
Rockettes?
7. The water drought.
6. The money drought (budget
deficit).
5. The ability to drop a class, no
questions asked, up to 24 hours
before the final. This can get very
dangerous.
4. New meal card pictures, and
meal card picture lines, for every
one. Why? Because student ID
numbers were changed by one
small digit. Why again?
3. Last year's senior class gift.
Tombstones? Stanford had a bad
year, but it ain't dead yet.
2. Fire Marshall gone hard-line.
So much for the fall of totalitarian
ism and for any lofty ideas among
students.
1. The number one Pan this
year should come as no surprise to
any campus veteran: the Old
Union line that always manages to
merge with the Post Office line
somewhere in the middle of the
Claw.

These lists are by no means comprehensive. Everyone on campus has
his or her own particular peeve or pride. These are just a few. Please
write in, and let us know about the little things and people out there
who make your time on the Farm a bit more pleasant, or, for that mat
ter, a touch more unbearable.
