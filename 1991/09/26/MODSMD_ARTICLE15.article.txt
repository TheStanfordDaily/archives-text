Centennial schedule offers many chances for enrichment

THIS FALL REPRESENTS A mile
stone for Stanford, as we ready
ourselves to celebrate the 100 th
anniversary of our opening. The Centen
nial Finale Weekend Celebration will
begin on Saturday, Sept. 28, and ends on
Tuesday, Oct. 1.
As we begin this celebration, we
want to encourage all students to par
ticipate in the many events and pro
grams offered throughout the four-day
extravaganza. There will be opportuni
ties to participate in convocations,
classes, open houses, performing arts
programs, a World Dance and, of

course, the Stanford Centennial Stadi
um Spectacular.
We want to emphasize that while this
is a time for students to enjoy them
selves, it is also a time to volunteer to
staff events and to welcome alumni back
to campus. As we celebrate together,
there are a number of things to keep in
mind:
• The World Dance on Saturday
evening, Sept. 28, is a non-alcoholic
event. It is an opportunity for Stanford
Alumni to mingle with current Stanford
students. Please help to make the event
an enjoyable one for everyone by observ

ing the no-alcohol requirement.
• In order to accommodate the set-up
for the Dance, Escondido Road from
Campus Drive to Stern and Crothers
Halls will be closed and not available for
parking from midnight, Friday, Sept. 27,
through dawn, Sunday, Sept. 29. Please
cooperate by removing cars from these
locations by midnight Friday. Cars that
remain in the area at that time will be
towed. Alternative parking is available in
the Wilbur lot, the Cowell Cluster lot and
the lot between the Law School and the
Bridge.
• Before leaving your residences to

join the torch-lit World Dance, you are
encouraged to secure your bikes as well
as your room. Although the event is
not open to the general public, it is pos
sible that uninvited guests may be pre
sent.
• Above all, let's take care of ourselves
and of one another. You can make a con
tribution to the overall success of this cel
ebration by accommodating guests and
other members of the community. Let's
all enjoy this once in a lifetime celebra
tion!
