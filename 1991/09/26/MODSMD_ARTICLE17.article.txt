## Susan McKean Human rights and wrongs in the USSR 
### 
The women in the perm
prison No. 28 were lined up on a
shabby stage singing "It Might Be
Better in Russia," a folk song that can, as
in this case, ring with dark, sad irony.
The video, filmed last winter, was shown
at the International Helsinki Federation
for Human Rights (IHF) Expert Hear
ings in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Sept. 7-8.
The video lingered for several minutes
on this pathetic performance, in between
shots of the living quarters, nursery and
factories within the camp. This prison is
like most others in the Soviet Union —
an abyss that has swallowed peoples'
lives for decades.
The continuing horrors of the Soviet
criminal justice system were among a
number of seemingly intractable prob
lems discussed by representatives from
Helsinki Human Rights groups all over
the former Soviet Union at the Vilnius
Expert Hearings.
The hearings revealed in detail many
of the deplorable, systemic violations of
human rights continuing throughout the
lands of the former Soviet Union.
From the tyrannical treatment of the
Abkhazians in Georgia to the unchanged
rigid, political definitions of psychological
normalcy, to the life-threatening anti-
Semitism in Central Asia, the two-day
hearings cracked opened the curtain on
an enormous stage of some unforesee
able, some ail-too predictable, problems.
The conference also tentatively her
alded a major shift in the discussion of
human rights in that part of the world:

The sincere struggle for freedom and jus
tice is no longer exclusively the domain of
the opposition.
Now, it seems, the most serious diffi
culties lie in the implementation of poli
cies and legislation. This shift will
require complicated, even painful read
justment not only by the old guard Com
munists and comfortable functionaries,
but also by those previously within the
dissident movement.
Will they be able to do it? Some
already are — they are learning how to
organize publicly, they are securing pro
fessional contacts with the West and they
are learning how to appeal to Western
foundations for the funds necessary to
enact their long-sought changes.
But from what I observed, they as yet
have little public influence and have not
aggressively fought to lead Russian polit
ical life. Further, it seems there is a divi
sion within the intelligentsia, between
those who are well-known and appreciat
ed in the West — Elena Bonner and
Tatyana Tolstaya are good examples —
and those who are throwing their sup
port behind such ex-communists as
Sobchak, Yeltsin and Popov.
This division could have serious politi
cal implications, as more particular ques
tions of constitutional reform are faced.
For example, one speaker at the confer
ence argued that residences should be
privatized immediately and the Soviet
"right to housing" be revoked.
This position is seen by many Russian
intellectuals as one adopted by a Western

amateur, who does not appreciate either
the practical or the emotional needs and
desires of the larger Russian population.
The split in more philosophical terms can
be described as one between capitalist
and socialist reformers.
Tactics of resistance will have to
change as well. One Dutch diplomat who
attended the official conference phrased
it to me this way: "People will now have
to go out and hammer away at the middle
— at the prison wardens, the highway
patrolmen, the bureaucrats with the
forms in Moscow. Decisions of human
rights rest in their hands now. ..."
The hearings demonstrated that some
individuals, with the critical institutional
support of organizations like the U.S. Union
of Councils of Soviet Jews and the IHF, are
taking this responsibility seriously.
However, in a country where cheese
and sugar are now known almost only in
memory, popular activism is quite a lot to
expect. For this reason, the chair of the
conference and the president of the IHF
noted another important shift in how
human rights issues in the former Soviet
Union should be addressed by the inter
national community.
Now, according to him, the question is
no longer one of withholding financial
support in order to encourage respect for
human rights, but rather, of providing it
wisely and generously in order that this
opportunity for civil reform is not lost.
