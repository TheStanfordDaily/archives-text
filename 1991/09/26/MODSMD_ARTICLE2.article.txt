# Unique Green Line withers away

### Katie Mauro 
Ever since Stern Hall's Green Line
was disbanded, tofu lovers have been
showing their fangs.
The Green Line, introduced last year
by Hessin Camille Ghazal, the assistant
manager at Stern Food Service, served
only meatless entrees and was quite pop
ular. Ghazal's "line" of gourmet vegetar
ian food consisted of such items as crois
sants, vegetarian soups and imported
cheese.
But Ghazal is now working at food
service in Kimball Hall and has been told
she may not start a similar line there.
"Nobody from the main office asked me
anything," she said. "They didn't give
me any reasons."
According to Keith Guy, director of
Housing and Food Service, the line's

elimination is part of a different
approach where vegetarian recipes are
incorporated into every menu.
"We will not have a 'Green Line' per
se," he said. "We expect to have those
choices and more in the a la carte units.
. . . There won't be one line you go to â€”
you'll find [vegetarian itemsl every
where."
The Green Line was no more expen
sive than the other Stanford meal plans
and many students opted to try it. Too
many, some thought. "The lines were
absolutely horrendous," said sophomore
Phil Finucane.
"No one wanted to eat in the regular
lines anymore," he added. "We also hap
pened to have the largest surge of
Birkenstocks known to man."
So far, general reaction to the disap
pearance of the Green Line has been

mixed. Some students have barely
noticed the change in the Stern dining
hall, while other students took a more
conspiratorial tone, saying they believed
the line was canceled merely because it
was so popular among students.
Vegetarians are particularly incensed
at the loss of their specialized food line.
"I definitely think we should start a
protest or something," freshman Anna
Cummins said. "I mean, I'm a vegetari
an and I would really like a separate line
that would accommodate my needs."
She added, "Stanford is so hypocriti
cal in claiming to be so environmentally
sound and yet here they are discourag
ing vegetarianism by canceling these
programs."
