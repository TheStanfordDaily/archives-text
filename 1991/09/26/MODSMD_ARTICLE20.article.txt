## Big Game preview: Card spikers smother Bears No. 1 women's winning streak continues 
### George Malone Staff writer 
This is what you face when you
are the No. 1-ranked team in the
country: every opponent you play
has absolutely nothing to lose.
They become more motivated —
they play their hearts out against
you. Every team is suddenly more
dangerous.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team had to dig down deep
and play well to defeat such an
inspired California squad at Har
mon Gym last night in four
games, 15-3, 15-3, 15-17, 15-11.
"This is as tough a match as
we've had all year," Coach Don
Shaw said.
The first two games went
according to script, with the Car
dinal playing strong defense, hit
ting well and forcing several Cali
fornia errors. Both teams were
fighting for every ball, but Stan
ford was just overpowering. The
crowd of more than 1,000, which
was not vocal to begin with, had
been completely silenced by the
Cardinal's almost flawless play.
California "played pretty darn
well, but we played well too. . .
.and Cal couldn't do anything
about it," Shaw said.
"The first two games felt great
— we were playing well. It was
clockwork. We were communicat
ing, and then the third game hit,"
outside hitter Jennifer Jackson
said.
When the teams came out on
the court for the third game, Cal
ifornia had been transformed into
another group of players altogeth
er.
Suddenly, when a Stanford
player would spike the ball, a Cal
ifornia player would make the
defensive play, either digging the
ball or making incredible saves off
of tipped balls. The Cardinal

could not put the ball down for
the point.
"It just got really frustrating. I
felt like they were figuring out
our hitting," said senior captain
Kristin Klein.
Stanford players were making
some pretty incredible defensive
plays themselves. Led by Klein's
22 digs for the match, the Cardi
nal was no slouch on defense dur
ing the contest. Stanford actually
had more total digs for the match
(100) than the Golden Bears did
(96).
California was playing the
game of its life, and they still only
won 17-15. The Cardinal was
down by only one point, 8-7,
before California was able to put
together a four-point rally that
got the crowd into the match and
gave the home-team an extra
advantage.
"It was really difficult to com
municate then. [Harmon] is such
a loud place that it makes it hard
to talk," said junior Kristi Paaso.
As the crowd roared louder,
the California players became
more pumped-up and pressed
their advantage on the sluggish
Cardinal.
"They were mixing-up their
offense a lot and keeping us
guessing. It was a mentally-drain
ing game," said junior setter Car
rie Feldman.
Although Stanford pulled back
to tie the game at 13, the combi
nation of the Lady Golden Bears'
scrappy defense, crowd support
and clutch hitting from California
seniors Morgan Cecil (last week's
Pac-10 Player of the Week) and

Holly Hutchinson gave California
the win.
The Golden Bears continued
to have the momentum going
their way into game four. Califor
nia rolled out to a 10-4 lead by
marshaling all of their weapons.
They were making sensational
digs, hitting well, the crowd was
loud, and Stanford was making
mental and miscommunication
errors.
"We got a little disorganized
and edgy with each other. They
were getting everything, and that
was kind of discouraging. About
halfway through the match, we
knew we had to take things one
point at a time," said junior Bev
Oden.
"We had no block at all, but we
regained our poise and started
doing things right," Klein added.
Stanford began playing like a
championship team again, show
ing a varied attack with strong
hitting that, like in games one and
two, California simply could not
stop. The Cardinal came back to
tie the match at 10, and then sim
ply overwhelmed the Bears the
rest of the way to win the match.
"We stayed tense [in the fourth
game]. Everything was a do-or-die
situation, but we didn't let up
mentally," Jackson said.
"We knew if we held steady
and kept siding out, we'd get our
points," Oden added.
"Whenever you're at Cal, any
thing can happen. We just went
back to fundamentals and got in
a groove again," said junior Lau
rie Sawin.
Despite California's pesky

defensive play and crowd sup
port, Stanford passed the gut
check in game four, didn't give up
and garnered another Pac-10 vic
tory.
"We have never felt like we're
going to lose," Oden said.
The Cardinal continued to

outhit its opponents, hitting .276
for the match while California
hit only .138. Stanford was led by
Klein's 26 kills and 22 digs while
hitting .296, while Oden added
15 kills and 19 digs. Jackson con
tinued her torrid hitting streak,
coming in with a .391 percentage

and adding 17 digs.
Next up for Stanford is a trip
north to play Washington and
Washington State in two more
important Pac-10 road matches.
The Cardinal returns home next
week to host the Stanford Invita
tional Oct. 3-4.

22 digs for the match, the Cardi
nal was no slouch on defense dur
ing the contest. Stanford actually
had more total digs for the match
(100) than the Golden Bears did
(96).
California was playing the
game of its life, and they still only
won 17-15. The Cardinal was
down by only one point, 8-7,
before California was able to put
together a four-point rally that
got the crowd into the match and
gave the home-team an extra
advantage.
"It was really difficult to com
municate then. [Harmon] is such
a loud place that it makes it hard
to talk," said junior Kristi Paaso.
As the crowd roared louder,
the California players became
more pumped-up and pressed
their advantage on the sluggish
Cardinal.
"They were mixing-up their
offense a lot and keeping us
guessing. It was a mentally-drain
ing game," said junior setter Car
rie Feldman.
Although Stanford pulled back
to tie the game at 13, the combi
nation of the Lady Golden Bears'
scrappy defense, crowd support
and clutch hitting from California
seniors Morgan Cecil (last week's
Pac-10 Player of the Week) and

Holly Hutchinson gave California
the win.
The Golden Bears continued
to have the momentum going
their way into game four. Califor
nia rolled out to a 10-4 lead by
marshaling all of their weapons.
They were making sensational
digs, hitting well, the crowd was
loud, and Stanford was making
mental and miscommunication
errors.
"We got a little disorganized
and edgy with each other. They
were getting everything, and that
was kind of discouraging. About
halfway through the match, we
knew we had to take things one
point at a time," said junior Bev
Oden.
"We had no block at all, but we
regained our poise and started
doing things right," Klein added.
Stanford began playing like a
championship team again, show
ing a varied attack with strong
hitting that, like in games one and
two, California simply could not
stop. The Cardinal came back to
tie the match at 10, and then sim
ply overwhelmed the Bears the
rest of the way to win the match.
"We stayed tense [in the fourth
game]. Everything was a do-or-die
situation, but we didn't let up
mentally," Jackson said.
"We knew if we held steady
and kept siding out, we'd get our
points," Oden added.
"Whenever you're at Cal, any
thing can happen. We just went
back to fundamentals and got in
a groove again," said junior Lau
rie Sawin.
Despite California's pesky

defensive play and crowd sup
port, Stanford passed the gut
check in game four, didn't give up
and garnered another Pac-10 vic
tory.
"We have never felt like we're
going to lose," Oden said.
The Cardinal continued to

outhit its opponents, hitting .276
for the match while California
hit only .138. Stanford was led by
Klein's 26 kills and 22 digs while
hitting .296, while Oden added
15 kills and 19 digs. Jackson con
tinued her torrid hitting streak,
coming in with a .391 percentage

and adding 17 digs.
Next up for Stanford is a trip
north to play Washington and
Washington State in two more
important Pac-10 road matches.
The Cardinal returns home next
week to host the Stanford Invita
tional Oct. 3-4.

This is what you face when you
are the No. 1-ranked team in the
country: every opponent you play
has absolutely nothing to lose.
They become more motivated —
they play their hearts out against
you. Every team is suddenly more
dangerous.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team had to dig down deep
and play well to defeat such an
inspired California squad at Har
mon Gym last night in four
games, 15-3, 15-3, 15-17, 15-11.
"This is as tough a match as
we've had all year," Coach Don
Shaw said.
The first two games went
according to script, with the Car
dinal playing strong defense, hit
ting well and forcing several Cali
fornia errors. Both teams were
fighting for every ball, but Stan
ford was just overpowering. The
crowd of more than 1,000, which
was not vocal to begin with, had
been completely silenced by the
Cardinal's almost flawless play.
California "played pretty darn
well, but we played well too. . .
.and Cal couldn't do anything
about it," Shaw said.
"The first two games felt great
— we were playing well. It was
clockwork. We were communicat
ing, and then the third game hit,"
outside hitter Jennifer Jackson
said.
When the teams came out on
the court for the third game, Cal
ifornia had been transformed into
another group of players altogeth
er.
Suddenly, when a Stanford
player would spike the ball, a Cal
ifornia player would make the
defensive play, either digging the
ball or making incredible saves off
of tipped balls. The Cardinal

could not put the ball down for
the point.
"It just got really frustrating. I
felt like they were figuring out
our hitting," said senior captain
Kristin Klein.
