# NBC annihilates good ol' football
## 
### 
Our civilization faces the threat
of total eradication.
America's most sacred, most glori
ous football school has joined with one
of America's greediest, most powerful
companies to beget a hideous abomina
tion. This beast, allowed to run free,
would destroy us all. Already it creeps
into our living rooms, corrupting our
children.
And on Oct. 5, Stanford's football
team will take on this evil monstrosity.
But even if the Cardinal wins their bat
tle, the war may have already been
lost.
I am talking about "Notre Dame
Saturday," of course.
"Notre Dame Saturday" is the
result of a deal between NBC and
Notre Dame, whereby NBC gained
exclusive rights to broadcast all of the
Fighting Irish's home games (and syn
dicate most of the away games) for the
next several years, having paid the uni
versity approximately $38 million.
Disgusted yet? It gets worse.
One Saturday a couple of weeks ago
I was back home in New Orleans (Who
Dat — 4-0!), car-less and bored. I want
ed to see some college football, so I
scanned the channels. I caught the
debut of "Notre Dame Saturday." Oh,
joy.
NBC brought in their heavy-hit
ters — all their big-name sports
broadcasters — to cover every
aspect of the game. Every aspect of the
game as it related to Notre Dame, that
is, and Notre Dame only.
NBC showed the nation pictures of
the Irish locker room, the tunnel
between the locker room and the field,
the field, the stadium, the famous gold
dome, and the famous painting of
"Touchdown Jesus."

NBC showed the nation
pictures of the Irish lock
er room, the tunnel

"Touchdown Jesus."

I saw interviews with Notre Dame
coaches, Notre Dame players, Notre
Dame ex-players, Notre Dame band
members, Notre Dame fans. I got a
great look at the Friday night pep rally
in the Notre Dame basketball arena,
featuring a rousing speech by
coach/god Lou Holtz.
I saw Ahmad Rashad speak rever
ently and affectionately of the Notre
Dame band and fight song, which
struck up on his cue.
In short, "Notre Dame Saturday"
was well-named.
Oh, yes. They also mentioned that
the Fighting Irish's opponent that day
was Indiana. I guess it just slipped out
somehow.
In case you haven't caught on yet,
"Notre Dame Saturday" is purely

biased hype, hype, HYPE for America's
favorite football school.
Even though Notre Dame probably
does have the largest national fan sup
port base, it is questionable that even
the Fighting Irish can give the network
high enough ratings week in and week
out to make the show a financial suc
cess in the long run, so there may be
some comfort in that.
However, the ultimate evil of the
whole affair will have already
been done, most likely. All
across America thousands of little
aspiring football players are watching
Notre Dame exalted on their tubes. Do
you think they won't be impressed?
It's not as if the Irish are having any
trouble with recruiting as it is. They
already have a huge advantage over
other schools, with their extensive net
work, the charms of their school, and
— the big one — their reputation.
Imagine a television executive
telling a recruiter at any Division I
school the following: "Look, we can
give you guys all the exposure you
need. We'll make you look good, guar
anteed. Your school will look good.
Your football team will look good.
They'll be heroes. Every kid will want
to grow up to be a player for your
team."
That recruiter might be willing to
pay the television company millions.
But Notre Dame is not paying; the
school is being paid $38 million to have
the ultimate recruiting tool.

Tyson Vaughan has nothing against
the Irish, especially since they will lose
to the Cardinal in a week and a half.
But he hates the fact that parity in col
lege football has become a joke. Sure,
there is parity — in the top 20
