# Ann Arbor hosts 'game of the year'
## 
### 
ANN ARBOR (AP) — A long win
ning streak is going to end Saturday
when top-ranked Florida State meets
No. 3 Michigan in Ann Arbor.
The Seminoles have the nation's
longest winning streak at nine, while
Michigan and Miami are next with
eight in a row.
"This could be the game of the year
in college football," said Florida State
coach Bobby Bowden. "This is the kind
of game that everybody wants to be
part of. High rankings, big stadium,
national TV — it's all there."
Florida State has yet to be tested,
winning its first three games over BYU,

Tulane and Western Michigan by a
combined score of 140-39. Michigan, on
the other hand, passed a meg or test by
beating Notre Dame 24-14 two weeks
ago.
Both teams have balanced offenses
and aggressive defenses.
Michigan's attack features quarter
back Elvis Grbac, running back Ricky
Powers and receiver Desmond Howard,
who has scored six of the Wolverines'
eight touchdowns this season.
Florida State's offensive leaders are
tailback Amp Lee, fullback Edgar Ben
nett and quarterback Casey Weldon,
the nation's top-rated passer. The

Seminoles also have a deep and talent
ed group of receivers.
Michigan's defense was impressive
against Notre Dame, limiting the Irish
to 78 yards on the ground and holding
them scoreless for the final 22 minutes.
But the task will be even harder against
Florida State, which may have the most
versatile offense in the country.
The teams have met only once
before, with Michigan winning 20-18 at
Ann Arbor in 1986. The oddsmakers
expect another close one on Saturday,
making Florida State a 2 1/2-point
favorite. That sounds just about right. .
