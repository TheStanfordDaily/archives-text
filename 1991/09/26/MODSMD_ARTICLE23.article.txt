### 
DETROIT (AP) — Magic Johnson has
asked for the resignation of the school
board member who described the NBA
star as "a big, dumb black kid" during his
school years in Lansing.
William Carter made the statements
during a Sept. 12 board meeting. He said
he deeply regretted them, but added they
were taken out of context and he will not
resign.
Johnson said yester-

day he and his family
have been hurt by
Carter's remarks.
"Not only were his
comments hurtful to
myself and my family,
but especially to the
children of Lansing,
Michigan, if not every-

where," Johnson said in
a statement released by the Lakers.
"I feel it is inappropriate and dangerous
for a man with his ideas and feelings to be
in such a powerful and influential public
position," Johnson said. "Should Mr.
Carter choose not to resign, I would ask
that the Lansing school board seek a recall
election against him immediately."
School board president Nancy Erickson
reprimanded Carter in a letter Tuesday.
She declined comment yesterday on
whether the board would ask for Carter's
resignation. She said a decision could be
made following a board meeting today.
The district cannot initiate a recall
effort because state law prohibits the use
of public funds for such purposes, Erick
son said.
School board president Nancy Erickson
reprimanded Carter in a letter Tuesday.
Erickson was not immediately available

"This is an embarrass
ment for his family. I've
tried to apologize to
everybody that I can con
ceivably think of."

for comment yesterday.
Carter, 66, said he was not surprised by
Johnson's reaction.
"If I was in Magic's shoes I guess I
would say the same thing," he said yester
day. "This is an embarrassment for his
family. I've tried to apologize to everybody
that I can conceivably think of.
"It was a dumb thing to do, a poor
choice of words."

Carter's com
ments came as he
argued for spending
more money on ath
letic programs for
sixth-, seventh-, and
eighth-graders.
Carter said he
was trying to make
the point that ath-

letics help keep a lot
of kids in school and interested in school,
but "I tried to make my point in a disgust
ingly offensive way."
"I was trying to explain that Earvin
Johnson was a total success picture, a
product of Lansing schools, and of elemen
tary, junior high and high school athlet
ics," he said.
Johnson attended high school in Lans
ing, and led nearby Michigan State to a
national championship in 1979.
School board member Adell Flourry
said Carter should resign, as did the Lans
iijg branch of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
The Rev. Melvin Jones, of the Union
Missionary Baptist Church, said he and
other black leaders have talked about
mounting a recall effort. Johnson's par
ents attend Jones' church, and Johnson
was married there Sept. 14.
