# Monica's next victim... Jimbo??
## Promoters move battle of sexes onto the court 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Eighteen years
after Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs,
a Hollywood promoter is hoping to stage
a second Battle of the Sexes in tennis.
David Krieff would like to pair Moni
ca Seles, the 17-year-old winner of three
Grand Slam events this year, with 39-
year-old Jimmy Connors, who reached
the semifinals of the U.S. Open.
The plan is to offer a $1 million win
ner-take-all pot and stage the event at
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas next March.
Krieff s company, Destiny Productions,
would produce the match for pay-per
view television.
"Nobody is hotter than Jimmy and
Monica," said Krieff, who has produced
a number of celebrity tennis tourna

ments. "Vitas Gerulaitis has proposed
that the 100 th man can beat the No. 1-
ranked woman. This would be the per
fect test of that theory and we're willing
to put the cash on the line to let the
world find out." *
KriefT said the rules of tennis would
be amended to give Connors just one
serve and have Seles play on an expand
ed court. The promoter said he hoped to
have a deal next week. "We really believe
it will happen," he said.
Ray Benton, Connors' agent, said,
"There have been conversations but to
date no substantive negotiations."
Stephanie Tolleson, who represents
Seles, was unavailable for comment.
