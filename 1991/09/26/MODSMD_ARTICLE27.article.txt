# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Self-realization by 900 numbers 
### 
IT LOOKED LIKE it would be a summer like
all the rest. Afternoons spent outside with,
friends, gaily tossing frisbees to and fro whilejj
happily roasting decaying animal flesh in th€
cool Jersey air. /

But as the summer began to approach quick
ly I began to realize something: I had no job.
And I had honestly tried. I made innumerable
trips to Kinko's to put my internship applica
tions on the just-perfect, professional-looking,
12-cent bonded paper. But nothing materialized,
except for this thing at Playboy, and, well, let's
just say it didn't pay.
By the time school got out in June, my odds of
landing a prestigious mall job were lower than
my junior-high-school-aged sister's. And
though she was at sleep-away camp, the depres
sion-era competition was still way too stiff.
It looked like I would be doing what every
other rich, privileged, I-don't-know-how-much*
room-and-board-is-because-I-just-send-the-bilk
home-to-my-parents Stanford student expert
ences during the summer.
It looked like I would be working for my dad.
I PICTURED WALKING into the office, with
my long hair and undeserved upper-echelon
telemarketing job and seeing all the secre
taries in their make-up splattered spandex con
coctions which they call style. And I would know
what was going on in their minds: It's the boss'
son. That's why he got the job. He can can get
away with whatever he wants, even that awful
haircut. I say we hang him, then we tar and
feather him and then we make him our personal
sexual slave. ...
But then, just when it seemed like the fanta
sy was picking up, I noticed a sign on the front
door of the Daily office:
"Internship available in Paradise, California.
Contact Communication Department for
details."
Paradise. It sounded so beautiful. So angelic.
So far away from my new spandex dom matrices
In Jersey City.
This would mean not seeing all my high
school friends. This would mean not seeing my
family. This would mean not seeing that guy on
the corner of 38th and Lex. who does that cool
thing with the roach clips and the pigeons.
But I was growing up and I had to put all of
that behind me. Or at least in Paradise.
So with two weeks left before finals, I packed
up my pillow, blanket, Interplak toothbrush,
mint-flavored, unwaxed dental floss and my Act
Dental Rinse and headed out to be a new
reporter for Paradise.


Joel Stein
Not too tart, not too sweet
Driving toward my new Chico
home that I had located through
a want-ad in a local newspaper, I
epiphonized that as nervous as I
was, I was finally free. I made
out the check for my new apart
ment. 1 would pay for everything
with the money I was making.
And I would be the one responsi
ble for remembering to put the
Snack Pack in my lunch box.
And the freedom was going to
take place in Chico — a town

ruled and controlled by the top
rated party school in the nation,
according to Playboy magazine.
The revenge on my bunny-clad
friends seemed too perfect.
But as I pulled over to ask
three large, bare-chested, drunk
en males where my apartment
was, and they informed me that I
lived in a complex widely-known
as "The Zoo," I found myself
forced to question my freedom.
Laying myself down on my
lumpy, Budweiser-sheeted mat
tres (They left off the extra "s"
for savings), cuddled up with my
Interplak and copy of "Being and
Nothingness," I discovered that I
was very lonely.

There were no dormmates, no
one to tuck me in at night, no one
to play knick-knack on my knees
with.
Eventually I made friends,
and I cooked tofu and zucchini ad
infinitum, and by the second
week I had built my own little
post-5 p.m. niche in life.
But no matter how much fun I
was having in my self-imposed
pseudo-adult asylum, I couldn't
avoid the nagging realization
that life outside this hollow shell
of love that we call college is a bit
lonely. Every so often, late at
night, I would find myself
furtively glancing at the phone
whenever the 900 number

flashed on my screen and that
seemingly omniscient blonde
woman with the half-unbuttoned
blouse would say, "Go ahead, I
think you'll be glad you did."
I'm scared of graduating.
But, luckily, I'm more scared
of not graduating.

Joel Stein wants to know what
kind of people Bride magazine is
targeting for subscriptions with
the plethora of blow-cards they
include in each issue. His col
umn will now appear here
biweekly, due to that pesky Har
ris kid with the unkept 'do.
