# INTERMISSION
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Self-realization by 900 numbers 
### 
IT LOOKED LIKE it would be a summer like
all the rest. Afternoons spent outside with,
friends, gaily tossing frisbees to and fro whilejj
happily roasting decaying animal flesh in thâ‚¬
cool Jersey air. /

But as the summer began to approach quick
ly I began to realize something: I had no job.
And I had honestly tried. I made innumerable
trips to Kinko's to put my internship applica
tions on the just-perfect, professional-looking,
12-cent bonded paper. But nothing materialized,
except for this thing at Playboy, and, well, let's
just say it didn't pay.
By the time school got out in June, my odds of
landing a prestigious mall job were lower than
my junior-high-school-aged sister's. And
though she was at sleep-away camp, the depres
sion-era competition was still way too stiff.
It looked like I would be doing what every
other rich, privileged, I-don't-know-how-much*
room-and-board-is-because-I-just-send-the-bilk
home-to-my-parents Stanford student expert
ences during the summer.
It looked like I would be working for my dad.
I PICTURED WALKING into the office, with
my long hair and undeserved upper-echelon
telemarketing job and seeing all the secre
taries in their make-up splattered spandex con
coctions which they call style. And I would know
what was going on in their minds: It's the boss'
son. That's why he got the job. He can can get
away with whatever he wants, even that awful
haircut. I say we hang him, then we tar and
feather him and then we make him our personal
sexual slave. ...
But then, just when it seemed like the fanta
sy was picking up, I noticed a sign on the front
door of the Daily office:
"Internship available in Paradise, California.
Contact Communication Department for
details."
Paradise. It sounded so beautiful. So angelic.
So far away from my new spandex dom matrices
In Jersey City.
This would mean not seeing all my high
school friends. This would mean not seeing my
family. This would mean not seeing that guy on
the corner of 38th and Lex. who does that cool
thing with the roach clips and the pigeons.
But I was growing up and I had to put all of
that behind me. Or at least in Paradise.
So with two weeks left before finals, I packed
up my pillow, blanket, Interplak toothbrush,
mint-flavored, unwaxed dental floss and my Act
Dental Rinse and headed out to be a new
reporter for Paradise.
