# Campus fun while there's still time
## 
### F. Robin O'Keefe 
You've got several weeks before you
really have to work, two big days with
no-classes and nothing to do with
that time other than to reac-

quaint your colon
with dorm food
and pay your bill
with a deferment
loan.

\ 112 J You have the
rarest of Stanford
commodities — leisure time.
What to do? How will you fill
those winsome hours before your

study list is due and that first
paper topic looms? Intermission offers these
suggestions:

Sports
Awaiting those inclined toward athletics are
several offbeat sporting events, the most vis
ceral and ballistic of which is bike putting.
In this sport the participant hefts a bicycle
that appears abandoned (i.e., it is not chained
to a tree) and puts it, as one would a shot in
the Olympics. Several different throwing
techniques exist, from the classics, the shot
put and the discus throw,
to the dan
ger-

ous but dynamic, the stair toss. And the
famous roof test is always a crowd-pleaser.
Obviously, bike putting is not for the weak
armed or emotionally advanced. For more
highbrow sportsmen there is steam-tunnel
spelunking, the exploration of the steam tun
nels underneath the Quad.
The origin of the funny lights and noises
that accompany the steam out of tunnel grates
late at night has always been a mystery, and
now is your chance to investigate. And tunnel
access is easy — just pull up any grating
around the quad that smells bad and jump in.
So round up your braver and shorter friends,
and descend into the depths.
The last, and most popular, sport on which
to spend your precious leisure time is sex. Few
Stanford students have the opportunity to
play this game of games, but those who do play
it do so emphatically.
Sex is great fun, and you can do it anywhere
— in a closet, in a deserted lecture hall, even
during the late Flick. You also need a mini
mum of equipment, just a partner and a bunch
of little rubber things. So get a partner if you
can (male, female, animal, vegetable or miner
al) and have at it. Perhaps you can be one of
the fortunate few.
Sculpture Climbing
Another activity you now have time for is
sculpture climbing. Sculpture climbing is
much like rock climbing, but more

angular. (It is also more dangerous, but
who cares.)
The best sculpture for climbing is the
mosquito-like cabley, pipey thing off the
back right corner of Meyer Library. (If
you don't know where Meyer is, ask a
premed.) The size and slickness of this
fine example of modern art make it a
great and challenging climb. The view
from the top is also stunning; you can see
the campus police coming to arrest you
clearly. The buffed-metal pile of octagonal
chunks in front of Kresge Auditorium is
also a classic. There are several places

where an average-sized human can sit
surrounded by metal with only his head
showing, giving you the feeling that you
are driving a tank designed by Salvador
Dali and built by Pablo Picasso.
But the most sublime sculpture experi
ence can be found in the company of the
gay and lesbian plaster-of-paris people
between the Quad and the Physics Tank.
These shiny, happy people are very white
(in all senses of the word) and are conve
niently life-sized. I myself have wiled
away many a lazy afternoon lounging on
the statues' bench, talking and playing
cards with them.
I usually wait until a professor or some
equally backward person wanders by. At
just the right moment, I shuffle the cards
in my hand and say "Go fish." The look

on the observ
er's face is clas
sic — as will be
the look on
yours when he
calls the nice
men in white

coats and butterfly nets to take you away.
The nice men have great sport coats with
sleeves that tie in back, and they come in
just your size.
Sybil: Role Playing
This talk of mental unhingement
brings me to another before-classes activ
ity — trying out different campus person
alities. Take, for example, the guys who
sit on the Tresidder back patio, smoking
cigarettes and playing chess and

Go ahead and choke up a
phlegm ball right into the
microphone.
i

backgammon all
day.
Have you ever
wondered what it's
like to play chess
all day? Ever won-

der what it was
like to be part of the black-turtlenecked
pale-faced-baggy-eyed-and-angsty crowd?
Now is your chance to know. Just throw
on some black clothes, grab a pack of
Lucky Strikes and your favorite espresso
drink, and get your rooks in gear.
Or perhaps the intellectual scene is not
to your liking. You can try its antithesis
— the life of a wacky Stanford Greek.
Wearing the rumpled hat of a professor
can also put some zing into a lazy day.
Sneak into an empty lecture hall, and step

up to that place of eminence before the
chalkboard.
Go ahead and choke up a phlegm ball
right into the microphone. Screech your
chalk across the board, and squeal with
fiendish glee as you envision 200 fresh
men writhing in agony. Write 73 pages of
notes in upside-down sanskrit, and erase
it as soon as you are done. These are the
joys — the dreams of a Stanford professor
— and now you have a chance to live them
yourself.
The opportunities are limitless. A cam
pus and a world spread before you, ripe
for discovery. So don't spend another
night passed out on the couch with a beer
in your hand and little crosses for eyes;
get out there, and take advantage of Stan
ford and the people in it.
