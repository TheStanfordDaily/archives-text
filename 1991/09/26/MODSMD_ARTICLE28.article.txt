# Campus fun while there's still time
## 
### F. Robin O'Keefe 
You've got several weeks before you
really have to work, two big days with
no-classes and nothing to do with
that time other than to reac-

quaint your colon
with dorm food
and pay your bill
with a deferment
loan.

\ 112 J You have the
rarest of Stanford
commodities — leisure time.
What to do? How will you fill
those winsome hours before your

study list is due and that first
paper topic looms? Intermission offers these
suggestions:

Sports
Awaiting those inclined toward athletics are
several offbeat sporting events, the most vis
ceral and ballistic of which is bike putting.
In this sport the participant hefts a bicycle
that appears abandoned (i.e., it is not chained
to a tree) and puts it, as one would a shot in
the Olympics. Several different throwing
techniques exist, from the classics, the shot
put and the discus throw,
to the dan
ger-

ous but dynamic, the stair toss. And the
famous roof test is always a crowd-pleaser.
Obviously, bike putting is not for the weak
armed or emotionally advanced. For more
highbrow sportsmen there is steam-tunnel
spelunking, the exploration of the steam tun
nels underneath the Quad.
The origin of the funny lights and noises
that accompany the steam out of tunnel grates
late at night has always been a mystery, and
now is your chance to investigate. And tunnel
access is easy — just pull up any grating
around the quad that smells bad and jump in.
So round up your braver and shorter friends,
and descend into the depths.
The last, and most popular, sport on which
to spend your precious leisure time is sex. Few
Stanford students have the opportunity to
play this game of games, but those who do play
it do so emphatically.
Sex is great fun, and you can do it anywhere
— in a closet, in a deserted lecture hall, even
during the late Flick. You also need a mini
mum of equipment, just a partner and a bunch
of little rubber things. So get a partner if you
can (male, female, animal, vegetable or miner
al) and have at it. Perhaps you can be one of
the fortunate few.
Sculpture Climbing
Another activity you now have time for is
sculpture climbing. Sculpture climbing is
much like rock climbing, but more
