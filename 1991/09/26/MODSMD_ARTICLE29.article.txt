You might call it"the mother of all
Gaieties."
The Centennial Gaieties Revue,
which opens tonight, could very well be
the funniest Gaieties ever. And for good
reason — it is a compilation of the fun
niest Gaieties songs and scenes from as
far back as 1914.
"It's funny — students never
change. They talk about the same
things, year after year," said Monica
Romig, the producer of the show. "Take
the post office, for instance. There are
years and years of songs about the post
office and not getting any mail."
But the show is more than just a
string of scenes from years past.
According to Romig and the others
working on the show, Centennial Gai
eties is a review of Stanford history
through the eyes of the students.
"Gaieties is the only thing this week
end that will be celebrating student life.

Nothing else can show what it's like to
live in this Stanford," Romig said.
"It is more than just a show. The
songs and scenes really reflect the stu
dent body of the time it was written,"
she added.
Not that everything in the revue will
be 50 years old. The writers, who have
been working on campus all summer,
decided the show should be "kind of like
a classic rock station."
Romig said, "We decided 'it doesn't
have to be old to be a classic.'"
For that reason, the revue will
include the popular song "You're
Dumped," from the post office scene of
last year's show "Arachnophobia," and
the classic "Gotta Hash, Oooh Baby,"
from the 1989 Gaieties. "Don of the
Dead." In addition there will be a pre
view — an "absolutely hilarious" short
scene and song — from this year's
upcoming Gaieties.
All the research for the show has
been going on since last spring, and the
cast has been at Stanford for several
weeks for rehearsals. That isn't a lot of

time to sift through hundreds of Gai
eties songs and scenes, Romig said.
"It's really something to put together
a show this big in just three and a half
weeks. Regular Gaieties takes five and a
half," she explained.
All those decisions which have been
made during those short weeks have
made Romig curious as to what a
Bicentennial Gaieties Revue might be
like.
"I can see some of our kids in the
21st century wanting to put on one of
our plays. I wonder which one of them
they'd pick."

Performances for students are tonight
at 7:30 p.m. and tomorrow at 2 p.m.
and 7:30 p.m. There will also be two
additional performances, one each on
Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m., for
alumni. Tickets for the Centennial Gai
eties Review will be $7 for students and
$12 for non-students. They will be
available at the door or in White Plaza
today and tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m.
