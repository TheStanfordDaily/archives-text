# Leland's carriage resurfaces
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
Spectators at Sunday's Centennial
homecoming parade will see an almost for
gotten piece of Stanford history — a 19th
century carriage that belonged to Leland
and Jane Stanford making its first public
appearance since the Stanfords used it more
than 80 years ago.
"This is a gorgeous piece of history. It's
just spectacular," said Sally Pinkner,
Centennial volunteer coordinator and one
of the two people primarily responsible for
restoring the carriage.
But it wasn't always so spectacular.
According to Pinkner, when Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement discovered three car
riages in the basement of the anatomy
building in 1969 they had been vandalized.
When University officials tried to move
the carriages out of the basement, they soon
found that no door was big enough to
accommodate them. So Dement put up
$2,000 of his own money to bore a hole
through the wall.
In 1971, the carriages were donated to
the Sacramento Historic Landmarks
Commission on the condition that one be
restored and returned to Stanford in time
for its centennial.
Pinkner first learned about the carriage

while working in the Centennial office dur
ing Founders' Day last March, and she has
been working to discover its history ever
since.
"We think the carriages were put down
there between '05 and '06," Pinkner said.
She believes the 1906 earthquake destroyed
a passageway connecting the anatomy
building and the Stanford Museum. There
was then no way for the carriages to get out
of the basement.
But, Pinkner added, "It's all conjecture."
Getting the carriage ready to hit the road
for the Centennial weekend has taken the help
of Peter Bullock, a doctor in Woodside who
restores antique carriages in his spare time.
The paint and body of the carriage were
restored by a company in the East, and
Bullock ordered several new parts from
Amish people in Pennsylvania, who contin
ue to drive carriages today, to make it road
worthy.
He calls the Stanford's vehicle "the Rolls
Royce of carriages." Bullock estimated that
it was built around 1870 and "is a magnifi
cent example of a carriage for that era....
It's an elegant sporting carriage." He added
that it's worth about $60,000.
The carriage will lead off Sunday's
parade carrying the recent winners of the
Leland and Jane Stanford look-alike contest
held on campus.
