# New music hits stores
## 
### 
EVERYBODY'S GOT AN
angle. From detergent to Dat
suns, every manufacturer
has a pitch for whatever product
they want you to buy. The music
industry is no different.
Summer is the usual down time
for the music industry as most
bands are busy touring or polishing
their fall release. Labels assume
most people (read: adolescents) are
too busy vacationing to pay much
attention to new releases.
However, come September when
Mom and Dad have eased the purse
strings for school, and with Christ
mas right around the corner, the
music industry figures they have
the public right where they want
them. Out strut the big-gun groups,
and it's right about now that you'll
start seeing ads for Sam Goody's
'Back to School Sale,' and Tower
Records 'School Daze Discounts.'
Well, here we are in school, and
here they come with new albums,
and with words like 'recession' still
lingering and a long summer of
horrendous ticket sales behind us, it
promises to be a real dogfight for
the consumer dollar.
Though the two volumes of
Guns 'n' Roses' "Use Your Illusion"
(full review here next week) were
supposed to be the first major
release this fall, G'n√ü dropped the
ball with release delays, and Metalli
ca's new album briefly stole their
thunder.
Metallica's superb album, "Slave
to the Grind," and, to a lesser
degree, Skid Row's recent album
serve as momentous breakthroughs
because they blur the segregation
line between heavy metal and
thrash/speed metal. Look for Metal
lica to sell a ton.
Former metal gods Rush quietly
slipped "Roll the Bones" in at No. 3
on the Billboard charts, and while
it's not as good as 1989's "Presto,"
their top notch live show which
kicks oft October 25 will sell the
album. Also upcoming in October
are live discs from thrash kings Slay
er and bubblegummers Poison.
After a five-year hiatus, Bob
Seger is back with a strong, solid
effort with "The Fire Inside."
Another heartlander, John Mellen
camp (no Cougar please) recently
previewed his new album, "When
ever He Wanted" at Radio City
Music Hall, and word is the new
album isn't as moody as his "Big
Daddy" album of three years ago.
Local veteran Neil Young is due
to deliver "Weld" at the end of this
month. Look for his two-CD promo
tional package which features a 45-
minute bonus disc of pure feedback.
Van Morrison has his own double
album of all new material ready and

waiting in "Hyms to Silence," and
fellow Irish brethren U2 are just
now putting finishing touches on
"Achtung Baby," which is tentative
ly due out in October.
Since Stanford is a university,
the labels decided long ago that we
fit the "alternative market" demo
graphic, and there's plenty of alter
native music hitting the streets.
Local death-metal, jazz funksters
Mr. Bungle (with Faith No More
vocalist Mike Patton) have just
released their self-titled debut, and
it's pretty wild.
"Blood Sugar Sex Magik" by the
Red Hot Chili Peppers and "Cere
mony" by the Cult promise to be big
sellers. Speaking of cults, the cult
band Golden Palominos are antici
pating their Michael Stipe produced
"Drunk With Passion" to be a big
breakthrough.
Saving perhaps the best for last,
both Prince and Public Enemy are
generating a lot of excitement with
their anticipated October releases.
After having his last three albums
suffocate from a lack of public rela
tions, Prince is reportedly hitting
the Good Morning America trail
hard to promote "Diamonds and
Pearls." The first single "Gett OfF'
got a big push with Prince's hot live
performance at the MTV music
awards. Apparently Prince is ready
for a North American tour with his
new group The New Power Genera
tion, which could put the Purple
One back on top.
"Apocalypse '91: The Empire
Strikes Black," the new Public
Enemy album may be the best
album of the lot. the critic's
darlings, 1990's "Fear of a Black
Planet" was voted by many writers
(myself included) to be the best
album of the year. The new album,
already reviewed in Rolling Stone, is
said to be even less uncompromis
ing than the last, and considering
that L.L. Cool J's "Mama Said
Knock You Out," and 3rd Bass'
"Pop Goes the Weasal" have gotten
considerable air-play on radio and
MTV, the new Public Enemy could
break big.
