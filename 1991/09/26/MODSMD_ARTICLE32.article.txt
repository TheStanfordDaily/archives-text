# Blues Traveler changes style

On one of the cuts from
Blues Traveler's second album
"Travelers and Thieves," song
writer and lead singer John
Popper muses, "I have my
moments now and again."
As the driving force behind
the band's first two albums, Pop
per has already had more than a
few moments. In fact, on "Trav
elers and Thieves," all four mem
bers of the band have their
moments, each doing his part to
create Blues Traveler's second
impressive very good album.
The first few times through,
"Travelers and Thieves" may
disappoint, primarily because
its sound is very different from
that of the band's self-titled
1990 release. But if the initial
response to the album is shock,
each successive listen brings
greater satisfaction as the high
quality of the album becomes
increasingly apparent.
Where the album has
changed is in the increased role
played by guitarist Chan Kinch
la. According to drummer Bren
dan Hill, Kinchla did a lot more
songwriting over the past year
than he had done in the past.
Hill also says Kinchla's guitar
playing "has developed a lot

over the last couple of years."
The result is an album
stacked with great songs. Hill's
composition "Mountain Cry,"
which features a guest appear
ance by Gregg Allman, is a
superb track, as is Popper's com
position "Sweet Pain." Songs
such as "I Have My Moments"
and "Onslaught," which repre
sent departures from the more
predictable framework of the
songs from the first album, also
succeed.
Popper evidently has a lot to
say; his lyrics span topics rang
ing from religious strife to the
story of Cyrano de Bergerac.
But Popper doesn't take himself
too seriously. In "All In The
Groove," Popper sings, "So, if
I'm rambling, ignore me/If on
the money, then adore me." And
the refrain in "Onslaught" asks,
"Now won't you tell me if you
like what you just heard?/ And if
you think the point I'm driving
at absurd/ Well there's no need
to tell me how or tell me why.
But I need to know the reason
not to try."
In short, "Travelers and
Thieves" makes it clear that
Blues Traveler is for real. They
should be putting out enthusi
astic and enjoyable music for a
long time to come.
