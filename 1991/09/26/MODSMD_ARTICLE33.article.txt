# Drummer discusses his big debut song
## 
### Ari Richter Editorial staff 
Brendan Hill knows pressure.
As the drummer for the New
Jersey-based band Blues Travel
er, Hill was on the spot earlier
this year when blues-rock legend
Gregg Allman joined the band in
the studio to play keyboards and
sing on "Mountain Cry," a song
Hill had written for the group's
new album.
Hill explains: When Allman
heard the track, "He didn't like the
15/8 part," referring to the unusu
al time signature of the first,
instrumental half of the song.
Faced with the challenge of
building on their critically
acclaimed debut album and
blessed with the presence of All
man to help in that task, the band
didn't want Allman to feel his
time was being wasted. And since
two of the other members of the
band, John Popper and Chan
Kinchla, usually did the band's
songwriting, it must have seemed
a little risky to use Hill's song.
Fortunately, Hill said, Allman
decided to stick around and had a
dramatic change of heart when
he heard the second, blues half of
the song.
Popper, the band's lead singer
and inspired harmonica player,
describes the blues as "the sound
a baby makes when it cries for
the first time." Such an interpre
tation of the blues tradition fit in
well with Allman's voice, because
if a mountain could cry the blues,
it would sound like Allman.
The result of the collaboration
between Allman and the band
turned out to be superb; out of
the raucous jam that constitutes
the first part of the song emerges
the blues portion, beginning with
Popper ably conveying the feeling
of Hill's composition. Then, just
as Popper's voice retreats, as if to
pause in contemplation, Allman's
distinctive, roaring vocals surge
to the fore, elevating the band's
already powerful sound to a peak
worthy of the track's wonderfully
evocative title.
"Mountain Cry," which also
finds Kinchla's lead guitar at its
best, climaxes with Popper and
Allman harmonizing. Read off
the page, the lyrics "I left the city
for its dirt and grime/ The factory
walls to make mountain time/ I

found love, but she slipped away/
Now I'm alone, but here I'll stay"
might not appear to be anything
special, but conveyed through the
inflections of Popper's and All
man's vocals, these words scream
with emotion.
Indeed, one of the most
appealing qualities of both of
Blues Traveler's albums is the
emotion they exude. More than
anything else, the members of
the band sound like they're hav
ing a good time. A guitar, a bass,
drums, a harp and vocals â€” the
band's ingredients are simple
and honest, the stuff of genuine
rock 'n' roll.
The band's first album, "Blues
Traveler," quickly and deserved
ly earned Popper great recogni
tion for the speed and precision of
his harp playing. That album's
first cut, "But Anyway," is a
tremendous exhibition of the
sounds a harmonica can offer.
According to Hill, when Pop
per comes on stage for live per
formances, he wears harmonicas
like a gunfighter used to wear
bullets, 14 in total, each secured
in its own holster. "John wears a
[vestl with 14 harmonicas, one
for each key," Hill explains. "He's
just kind of weird that way, with
weapons and things. He's always
wearing it; sometimes he sleeps
with it."
Currently on tour for two
months, Blues Traveler will be
performing in San Francisco at
the Warfield on Saturday, Sept.
28. Hill says the band much
prefers live shows to studio work,
so the show should be a special
treat for those who have only
heard their studio work.
"The most fun is the travel
ing," Hill says. "We play a two
and-a-half hour show. We have
about 50 songs we play live. Each
night, we pick about 10 or 11 out
of a hat. We're always changing
the sets around."
For those who go to the show
this weekend, they can probably
count on the band to come out for
an encore. Hill said, "It's gotten
standard for bands to do an
encore. But when we go off stage,
we go back on pretty quickly. We
just try to rock 'em (the fans)
out." It's also likely the band will
be joined on stage by a guest.
"Usually it's a guitar player,"
Hill says.
