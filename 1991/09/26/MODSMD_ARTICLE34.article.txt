# A 						quiet break amid these hectic times

### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
It's the first week of Fall quarter — you're
being bombarded with things to do, programs
to sign up for and opportunities to "take
advantage of all that Stanford has to offer."
Well, here's an attractive option: Come to
Dinkelspiel auditorium, sit down, relax and
listen to some beautiful music.
The Stanford String Quartet will present a
special Centennial Weekend concert this Sat
urday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8:30 p.m.
The program will include Quincy Porter's
String Quartet No. 3, Mozart's Quartet in G
Major and Sir Edward Elgar's Quartet in E
Minor. It's sure to be a remarkable perfor
mance.
In residence at Stanford since 1983, the
Quartet is internationally known. Hailed by
the San Francisco Examiner as "the finest
ensemble of its kind in the country," and by
the Los Angeles Times as "unfailingly ener

getic and virtually flawless," the group is a
great asset to the University that no one
should miss out on enjoying.
And you won't have to fill out any forms,
take any flyers or commit to spending your
lunch hours for the rest of the year planning
activities. There might be a short line, but
compared to the one for paying tuition bills,
it'll be nothing.
The Quartet's members — violinists Phillip
Levy and Susan Frier, violist Bernard Zaslav
and cellist Stephen Harrison — are all mem
bers of the Stanford Music Department facul
ty. As artists-in-residence they each give indi
vidual instruction to students, in addition to
keeping up with a busy concert schedule. The
group only recently completed its Centennial
Tour, started in 1988, which included concerts
everywhere from the Palace of Fine Arts in
San Francisco to Amerikahaus in Frankfurt,
Germany.
This summer the quartet gave several con
certs at festivals in Lake Tahoe, Sonoma and

Sedona, Arizona. Responses to their perfor
mances, in Arizona, were so enthusiastic that
reviewers from Phoenix's Arizona Republic,
the largest newspaper in the Southwest, trav
eled to Sedona to listen, and National Public
Radio taped a performance for future broad
cast.
This year the Quartet will present a series
of five concerts at Stanford, each featuring a
pre-concert lecture for those who wish to learn
a bit about the composers and their pieces
before taking in the music. The series will
include works for harp and string quartet with
guest harpist Rosalind Simpson (Oct. 20),
Respighi's 11 Tremonto for voice and string
quartet featuring soprano Judith Bettina
(Dec. 6) and the world premier of San Francis
co Symphony member and Stanford alumnus
Mark Volkert's Quartet No. 2 (Feb. 9).
So take advantage of one of Stanford's most
valuable resources. And, by the way, formal
attire is not required, so relax. Classical music
isn't just for bow-ties anymore.
