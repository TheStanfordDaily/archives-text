# Gilliam revisits Camelot sans Python
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
"The Fisher King" has all the
elements of a good bedtime story.
There's a castle, a dragon, an
enchanted forest and the obligato
ry damsel in distress. That "The
Fisher King" is a movie set in
modern-day Manhattan doesn't
make it any less enchanting.
Terry Gilliam, who covered
similar territory in "Monty Python
and the Holy Grail," directs this
hilarious and profound adaptation
of the Grail legend. It seems
"Monty Python" was only the
beginning.
Gilliam himself is a sort of
modern-day legend. The ex-
Pythonite confirmed his cult
celebrity with "Time Bandits" and
"Brazil." After the untimely death
of his $50 million "Adventures of
Baron Munchausen," it's not sur
prising Gilliam has returned to
Camelot.
And why not? Twentysome
thing years later, Gilliam is still
the best Grail director around.
(OK, the only Grail director
around.) For better or for worse,
"The Fisher King" might be just
the film to catapult this Dark
Knight into the mainstream.
Armed with the seemingly
inexhaustible talents of Robin
Williams and the underrated Jeff
Bridges, a hard-hitting script and
a uniformly brilliant supporting
cast, Gilliam weaves a magical,
intellectual tapestry of fantasy
and realism in which fantasy
often seems more realistic than
reality.
Richard LaGravenese's screen
play (his first) is essentially a fairy
tale, with obvious ties to the myth

of Parsifal, who is reincarnated in
Parry (Williams). Parry is a pro
fessor of medieval history who
loses his wife, his mind and his
rent-controlled apartment (in that
order) in the aftermath of a psy
chopath's random shooting spree.
The massacre, we discover,
was indirectly inspired by Jack
Lucas (Bridges), a cynical New
York shock jock with a vicious
pony tail and an ego to match.
Three years later, Jack's career,

too, is literally in the gutter. The
drunken disc jockey is about to be
set on fire by teen hoodlums when
he is rescued by Parry and his
merry band of homeless men.
In a misguided effort to
"redeem" himself for his second
hand crimes, Jack befriends
Parry and masterminds a scheme
to win him the maiden of his
dreams (Amanda Plummer). The
plot succeeds all too well. Con
vinced of his personal righteous

ness, Jack dumps his own long
suffering girlfriend (Mercedes
Ruehl) and returns to his arro
gant, materialistic ways.
But not for long. "The Fisher
King" is a fairy tale, after all, and
therefore must have a happy, life
affirming ending. Under another,
cheesier director, the overall
effect would be trite, if not totally
lame. Gilliam, however, is not
afraid to take awesome risks and
achieves equally awesome results.
