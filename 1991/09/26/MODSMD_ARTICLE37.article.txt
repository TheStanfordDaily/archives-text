# Fink makes you think
## 
### Mike Curry 
Trying to summarize "Bar
ton Fink" in a review is as dif
ficult as writing a decent one
page paper on T.S. Eliot's "The
Wasteland."
In contrast to the "Pretty
Terminator on Elm Street"
trend in Hollywood, "Barton
Fink," with its brilliant weav
ing of symbolism and ambigui
ty, is a movie that will make
you think, a movie that you
can argue about at Cafe Bor
rone over a couple of espressos
in pseudointellectual fashion.
But if you don't like "fruity"
movies, don't, worry. "Barton
Fink" offers enough laughs
and suspense to please you
"Lethal Weapon" types.
The movie's plot revolves
around the struggles of Barton
Fink, a promising young play

wright from New York who
comes unglued in the dizzy and
corrupting world of Hollywood
in prewar 1941. Forced to
write a B-movie wrestling
script, the dislocated son of
Brooklyn fishmongers devel
ops a choking case of writer's
block — much like those we all
experienced in avoiding CIV
papers.
Cast as the bespectacled and
"Eraserhead"-coiffured Fink,
John Turturro looks like a Phi
Delt who stuck his finger in a
light socket. His acting howev
er is brilliant, and his talent
(and his nose) bring Dustin
Hoffman to mind.
John Goodman, who plays
Fink's folksy Los Angeles
neighbor Charley Meadows, is
the epitome of the characters
Fink writes about; he is the com
mon man. Like Turturro's, Good
man's acting is impeccable — in
fact, all of the acting in the film is
flawless.
The 1991 Cannes Film Festival
panel also appreciated the film's
thespian excellence. They reward
ed Turturro with the Best Actor
Award and in addition gave "Bar
ton Fink" awards for Best Direc
tion and Best Picture. The film's
sweep of the "big-three" awards
was the first such achievement in
the festival's 44-year history.

Film directors/screenwriters/
gaffers Joel and Ethan Cohn offer
a ton of goodies for film buffs.
They cleverly manipulate visual
and audio transitions, tracking
shots, stereotypes of 1940s pro
ducers and detectives and refer
ences to David Lynch's "Eraser
head" and Roman Polanski's
"Repulsion."
The Cohn brothers' real gift is
their use of their motifs regarding
listening, pain, artistic observa
tion versus experience and the
"life of the mind." The Cohn
brothers' messages are adroitly
mixed, making for a long but
rewarding night at Cafe Borrone.
