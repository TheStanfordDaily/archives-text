# Fink makes you think
## 
### Mike Curry 
Trying to summarize "Bar
ton Fink" in a review is as dif
ficult as writing a decent one
page paper on T.S. Eliot's "The
Wasteland."
In contrast to the "Pretty
Terminator on Elm Street"
trend in Hollywood, "Barton
Fink," with its brilliant weav
ing of symbolism and ambigui
ty, is a movie that will make
you think, a movie that you
can argue about at Cafe Bor
rone over a couple of espressos
in pseudointellectual fashion.
But if you don't like "fruity"
movies, don't, worry. "Barton
Fink" offers enough laughs
and suspense to please you
"Lethal Weapon" types.
The movie's plot revolves
around the struggles of Barton
Fink, a promising young play

wright from New York who
comes unglued in the dizzy and
corrupting world of Hollywood
in prewar 1941. Forced to
write a B-movie wrestling
script, the dislocated son of
Brooklyn fishmongers devel
ops a choking case of writer's
block â€” much like those we all
experienced in avoiding CIV
papers.
Cast as the bespectacled and
"Eraserhead"-coiffured Fink,
John Turturro looks like a Phi
Delt who stuck his finger in a
light socket. His acting howev
er is brilliant, and his talent
(and his nose) bring Dustin
Hoffman to mind.
John Goodman, who plays
Fink's folksy Los Angeles
neighbor Charley Meadows, is
the epitome of the characters
