# No weeping at this funeral

There is no plot in "Freddy's
Dead," so don't look for one. If
you want plot go see "Dead
Again." But what "Freddy's
Dead" does have in abundance is
violence, guts and gore, and if
these are what you are after, this
movie is a must-see.
This sixth and self-proclaimed
finale to the "Nightmare on Elm
Street" series delivers big on its
promises. The acting is terrible,
the screenplay moronic and the
direction barely competent — just
as you would expect from Freddy
Krueger. But these elements
aren't the point of the movie. Spe

cial effects and gross-out body
mangling are the point, and
"Freddy's Dead" wisely sticks to
these goals.
This "Nightmare" has the
most intricate and delectable
sadism of any movie in the series.
Freddy's killings are well thought
out and torturous with a dement
ed and twisted brilliance.
Freddy trades in the 'Itchy and
Scratchy' type of over-the-top,
howitzer violence for a more sub
tle and surgical approach to
killing. In this movie he tran
scends the creative confines of the
common killer and becomes a
true artist, a sort of homicidal
Monet.
One of the grossest scenes in
the movie involves a hamster and
a sledgehammer — but we don't
see the death or even a drop of
blood. Just a thud and a lonely
squeal. What is left out of this
scene is what makes it devastat
ingly effective; any graphic gore
would detract from the pure hor
ror.
I won't spoil the fun, but be
sure to check out the ear scene in
the beginning of the movie. This
scene is at the same time revolt
ing, funny, terrifying, seductive

and sublime — in short, the epit
ome of what a horror movie tries
to achieve. The Nintendo scene is
also a killer — literally. I was
laughing so hard I barely noticed
when the victim died. Great stuff.
Sadly, however, the movie fails
at its largest and most important
goal — creating a moving and
believable ending for the Freddy
Krueger myth.
Robert Englund (Freddy in all
six movies) is said to have turned
in his hat, sweater and knife-fin
gered glove to a movie museum.
Freddy really seems to be dead. I
expected to leave the movie the
ater with a bemused grin and a
tear in my eye, having watched a
final blaze of glory for one of my
dearest childhood heroes — the

last hurrah of a cultural and pop
ular icon.
But "Freddy's Dead" doesn't
deliver. The same tradeoffs the
movie makes to deliver show stop
ping scenes in the beginning of
the film make plot development
and characterization impossible.
And without these elements,
the movie that proved itself so
adept at pure mayhem finds itself
suddenly helpless. Without
strong characters and a driving
plot Freddy's final demise seem
empty and emotionless, like a
two-day old road kill. We can sym
pathize, but we are not swept up
in the emotional power of a scene
which should have crushing sig
nificance.
"Freddy's Dead" tries valiant

ly, however. With the wonderful
inclusion of three-dimensional
visuals for the climatic battle
scene, we are taken literally into
Freddy's world to witness his
death. The 3-D comes through
like all the technical parts of the
movie — there are plenty of fly
out-of-the-screen visuals and
long, pointy phallic things. We
even get a tour of the inside of
Freddy's brain.
But in the final analysis, even
this technical coup cannot make
the audience feel Freddy's death.
We are left alone, not caring. The
special effects, the blood and the
violence in this movie are first
rate, but I left the theater feeling
only dazzled instead of satisfied.
