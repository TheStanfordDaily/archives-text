# Swedish jazz? Sounds fishy

### Alexander Wiesen 
While many students were busy decorating
their rooms and drawing complex flowcharts in
their time schedules, more than 100 people
gathered in Dinkeispiel Auditorium Monday
night for a night of jazz — Swedish jazz, in fact.
Each of the groups, well known in Europe
and Sweden, had an intense desire to be
known in America. To this end the groups
have produced a compact disc of their North
American tour called, not surprisingly,
"Swedish Jazz: North American Tour."
The first group to perform was the Putte
Wickman Quartet. Wickman, a well known
clarinet jazz soloist in Europe, organized the
quartet just before the tour and plans to per
form with the group only for the duration of
their travels. The other musicians included
Gosta Rundqvist, a pianist; Hans Backenroth,
a bassist; and Ronnie Gardiner, the quartet's
drummer.
"All of us are from Sweden," Wickman
explains, "except for Ronnie Gardiner, who is
from Rhode Island but lives in Sweden." The
group plays both jazz standards and original
works, and their influences include Eddie
Daniels and Benny Goodman.
The Arne Domnerus Trio performed sec
ond, led by Domnerus, known for his ability
and skill with both the alto saxophone and
clarinet. Accompanying him was guitarist
Rune Gustafsson and Ulf Johnasson, a young
musician who not only played piano and trom
bone, but sang as well.
The group has been working together as a
trio for the last five years, but Domnerus and
Gustafsson have been working together since
1960, performing both standards and original
works.
The final group Monday evening was
Joakim Milder and the Lars Jannson Trio.
Jannson said his influences included Herbie
Hancock and jazz-fusion, a movement with
which the other groups seemed less familiar.
The group also cited oil paintings and the
horn musicians John Coltrane and Miles
Davis as major influences.
"The piano is primarily a percussion
instrument, but it is possible to make it sing
like a horn," Jannson said.
