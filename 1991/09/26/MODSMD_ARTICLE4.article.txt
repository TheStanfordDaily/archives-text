# Inquiry continuing in alleged dorm rape
## Student investigated, alcohol called a factor 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Casa Zapata residents say they are
struggling to heal after a female Stanford
student's report that she was raped in the
dormitory Sunday night.
"To start like this is so painful," said
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga.
"We've worked so hard to make this place
open to everyone. We have to heal."
The woman "is very strong and a person
to admire," Burciaga added.
Stanford Police are still investigating
the woman's report, said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. The Santa Clara
County district attorney must review the
case before an arrest warrant could be
issued, Herrington added.
Burciaga said the incident involved an
individual male Zapata resident. Ninety
eight people live in Zapata.
According to Burciaga, alcohol played a
role in the incident.
The alleged assault occurred in a room
in Zapata Sunday night. Herrington said
the police received a call from the woman
shortly before noon Monday, and they have
been investigating the case since then.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson said
the University's judicial affairs investiga
tion of the case is continuing, but he would
not predict when it will be concluded.
"We're proceeding ahead with it,"
Jackson said. "We're gathering as much
information as we can."
Jackson added that the woman is "try
ing to get ready for school."
During most of Monday afternoon and
evening, three uniformed Stanford police

officers were stationed outside a room in
Zapata. The officers were waiting for a
search warrant, Herrington said.
At about 9:30 p.m. Monday night, after
receiving the warrant, uniformed officers
and Stanford Police Detective Tim Frecceri
entered the room, removed the sheets and
pillowcases from one of the beds and car
ried them in plastic garbage bags to a squad
car.
Burciaga said he has been impressed by
the reaction of Zapata's residents to the
incident. "From this tragic experience, it's
been heartwarming to see the strength and
courage of our residents," he said.
One Zapata resident who declined to be
identified said the house is feeling "a sense
of community. People are coming together
and being supportive" of each other.
But Burciaga also said that some resi
dents have blamed themselves for not
somehow preventing the incident.
"People are feeling a sense of failure or
guilt right now, starting with me and my
wife," Burciaga said. "There are a lot of
after-the-fact regrets."
Because Zapata is the Mexican-
American theme house, Burciaga said he
was worried that the incident might
become entangled wrongly with racial
issues.
Burciaga said he thought University
procedures for dealing with sexual assault
"worked like clockwork" in this case.
"The whole thing just clicked," he said.
The woman received support from the
Dean of Students Office, Counseling and
Psychological Services, the Residence Dean
and the Cowell Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team.
