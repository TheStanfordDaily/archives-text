# Freshman blues hit home for bikeless boy wonder and pals
## 
### Michael Green 
Many things have become
wildly apparent since my stay
as a freshman began — random
thoughts, learnings and experi
ences. Some have been noticed,
remarked on and shared by all
who are fresh from their first
pilgrimage to Palo Alto, where
as others I believe are solely
mine — divine inspiration and
bad experiences. It's a trade
off. I thought you might appre
ciate a cute little collection of
them.
Freshmen — learn from
what you haven't already seen.
Upperclassmen — sing
along, 'cause you know the
words.
• Not everyone has been
waiting his or her whole life for
me to get here. The welcome
Michael party was canceled.
• My bike was stolen on my
first day here. (Aw. Tsk. Tsk.
Sympathy.) It was indicative of
the typical helpful Stanford
attitude — "Hi, welcome to
Stanford. Can I take that for
you?"
• If they make me collect on
what I promised to do to Dean
Jean if I got in here, I'm in big
trouble and will have to find
directions to the nearest drug
store.
• What is this dental dam
thing everyone is all revved
about, and is there a one unit
class given on how to make one
out of a condom?
• The annoying but admit

tedly fun and cute people I
stayed with in Branner last
April are going to call me
"Pierre's Pro Fro" forever.
• I thought Wilbur wasn't
that bad . . . then I visited Kim
ball.
• Tan toes after December
finals — that's why we came
here.
• No one really says Fro Yo.
It's a myth.
• I patiently waited in the
Quad during the full moon
Monday. Two senior girls
showed up. One immediately
claimed to be a junior; the
other brought a boyfriend.
• CIV is not there to like.
• My roommate is not from
L.A. with a car and stereo, as
expected, but is from Singa
pore, and I like him anyway.
• Socks suck.
• There are many people
here who make you think, "I
know I can do something really
well, but I can't think of what
it is. . .
• I don't remember any cal
culus, nor do you.
• Frosh who came here with
boyfriends/ girlfriends at home
are very irritating.
• Never lock your bike to
itself.
• Tetris is better on a Nin
tendo than on a Mac.
• I know I don't really need a
fridge, but I rented one any
way.
• I might never see break
fast.
• Having your alarm clock

within an arm's reach of your
bed is a bad idea.
• Simpsons. Tonight. Cedro
lounge. Everybody's invited.
• My favorite shower stall
has been occupied twice, and
it's beginning to piss me off.
• The cute girl I met as a Pro
Fro really does want to go out
with me (you may substitute
'hook up,' 'get together' or any
other unnecessary euphemism
that makes you feel like you
are noncommittally involved.
This seems to be a strange but
common trend here) but is just
hiding it very well.
• The hottest girl I know
from home tells me now that
she always really wanted me.
• No one thinks that they
deserve to be here. Did you
ever hear anyone say, "Yeah, I
knew I'd get in?"
Orientation came to a hum
ble but laudable end as the Ori
entation Volunteers finally
changed out of those rancid
and over-worn red T-shirts.
Two points for them and the
whole orientation staff. The
threat of classes lurks around
the darkest depths of your aca
demic subconscious; many of
my fellow freshmen whine,
"But I haven't played student
since January!"
Deal with it. You didn't wait
in line at the Bursar's Office
for nothing.

Michael Green is a freshman
who wants his bike back and
likes redheads.
