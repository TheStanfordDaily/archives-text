# A 						time to sing and sing and...

### Andy Brockenbrough 
Stanford has enough a cappel
la groups to fill almost every
shower on campus.
But they're not all Everyday
People. Some travel down Stan
fords' Fleet Streets in Mixed Com
pany, dressed as Mendicants,

making point after
Counterpoint while
carrying effervescent
Talismans.
A cappella singing is
a traditional unaccom
panied style, and the
groups usually have 16
people. Stanford's a
cappella pantheon
boasts six groups that
have little in common
— except that they are

all very loud.
Each a cappella group is out in
full volume this week singing in
dorms, dining halls and perhaps
even some showers across campus
to encourage both new and
returning students to audition for
one of their groups.
For those of you with an inter
est in singing, try to match your
own personality with that fash
ioned by each particular group.

The Mendicants is Stanford's
oldest a cappella group. The all
male group has been wooing fans
with their love songs since the
early 19605. Fleet Street, the
other all-male group, is best
known for their witty skits and
their rap rendition of the Stanford
hymn.

Stanford a cappella groups also
travel — last year, the Mendicants
went to Club Med in Mexico and
Fleet Street sang back East with
their counterparts in the Ivy
League.

Talisman, Everyday People
and Mixed Company all have both
male and female members. Talis
man has a spiritual flair while
Everyday People leans towards
the soulful. And for those of you
afraid of the dating taboo at Stan
ford, Mixed Company celebrated
an engagement between two of its
members last year. Counterpoint
is the only all-female a cappella
group.

Each group serves the Stanford
community in numerous ways.
They put on shows every Wednes
day in dorms around campus dur
ing the school year, sing at
fundraisers and charities and
occasionally give special concerts
for birthdays.
Some groups even put out

albums you can buy in
the Bookstore and in
White Plaza. Last year,
for example, the Mendi
cants put out a compact
disc called "Just Like
That."
Stanford a cap
pella groups also travel
— last year, the Mendi
cants went to Club Med
in Mexico, Mixed Com-

pany toured Colorado
and Fleet Street sang back East
with their counterparts in the Ivy
League.
If you audition, be sure to bring
a try-out piece. Sign up before
hand in White Plaza to avoid long
lines on audition nights, which are
Oct. 1 and Oct. 2 for most groups.
Anyone interested in audition
ing for a singing group might also
consider the University Singers
and the Chorale.

Fleet Street is one of Stanford's more outrageous a cappella groups. Some Fleet Street classics include
"Schoolhouse Rock" and "Masochism Tango." Tryouts for Fleet Street and other a cappella groups start
this weekend.
