# Orientation programs discuss sexual assault
## 
### Jeff Brock Brad Jacobson 
In a series of Orientation meetings run
by student facilitators last night, residents
of several dorms faced a series of scenarios
on sexual assault and alcohol abuse meant
to prepare them to avoid dangerous situa
tions.
The sessions took place in Wilbur,
Branner, Lagunita and Roble and will
occur again tonight at Florence Moore,
Stern, Toyon and Kimball Halls at 6:15.
The program, called "About Last
Night," is a joint project combining the
efforts of sexual assault peer educators and
the Freshman Alcohol Responsibility and
Management Program, which is sponsored
by the Intersorority and Interfraternity
councils.
The meetings were scheduled prior to
allegations that a woman had been raped
in a dormitory last weekend.
The discussions in Branner and Soto

did not focus on the alleged weekend
assault, but instead began with a previous
ly scheduled 30-minute film dramatizing a
day in the life of typical college students.
One segment depicted the effects of
alcohol use by showing scenes of a party in
which a man pressures a woman to get
drunk and then rapes her.
After the video, discussions were led by
volunteers who underwent a three-day
training program last week. At Branner,
about 50 freshmen broke into three
groups. Each group had two facilitators
who discussed alcohol issues and two facil
itators who discussed sexual assault.
At times the students in Branner and
Soto were quiet and had to be prodded by
the facilitators to speak. The discussion at
Soto — attended by about 25 people — was
sprinkled with nervous laughter, though
the facilitators were serious in their pre
sentation.
Many residents expressed strong
opinions. One Branner resident
said, "I think you should be able to
go to a party and not be coerced into
drinking more than you want. You
should be able to do what you
want."
Another freshman said, "There
are precautions you have to take as
a woman. If you are at a party you
shouldn't go off to some hidden cor
ner ... with a guy you don't know."
A Soto resident said most men in

the video and in similar presenta
tions are frequently portrayed neg
atively. "I think that's one-sided,"
he said.
Another Soto resident said he
had a friend at Harvard who got
drunk and was sexually coerced by
a sober woman. "He's upset he'll
lose his girlfriend," the resident
said. "He feels like he was taken
advantage of."
An equal number of men and
women attended both presenta
tions. The facilitators gave partici
pants at both dorms rules and
information regarding alcohol use
at Stanford — including the new,
stricter official policy on alcohol —

as well as California's legal defini
tion of rape.
Soto Resident Assistant Dev Pat
naik, a senior, emphasized that the
stereotype of the "sleazy" rapist is
not always necessarily true. He said
sometimes a person who doesn't
seem dangerous can be a rapist.
Some of the facilitators' ques
tions in the Soto presentation were
met with impatience. When one
facilitator asked, "Does a woman
ever deserve to be raped? What if
she wears a miniskirt?" a resident
said under his breath, "I think
we're beyond that."
"About Last Night" was created
after various groups expressed a

desire to talk to new students about
the dangers of alcohol and sexual
abuse.
Heather Azure-Esquiro, a coor
dinator of the discussions, said,
"We're not telling the freshmen not
to drink, because most of the facili
tators drink occasionally them
selves. We just want them to under
stand the responsibility that comes
along with it."
Azure-Esquiro said the fact that
the alcohol-related discussion was
run by a fraternity and sorority
group may raise some eyebrows.
But, she noted, "That is the point.
We are trying to change the image
of the Greek system."
