# Orientation programs discuss sexual assault
## 
### Jeff Brock Brad Jacobson 
In a series of Orientation meetings run
by student facilitators last night, residents
of several dorms faced a series of scenarios
on sexual assault and alcohol abuse meant
to prepare them to avoid dangerous situa
tions.
The sessions took place in Wilbur,
Branner, Lagunita and Roble and will
occur again tonight at Florence Moore,
Stern, Toyon and Kimball Halls at 6:15.
The program, called "About Last
Night," is a joint project combining the
efforts of sexual assault peer educators and
the Freshman Alcohol Responsibility and
Management Program, which is sponsored
by the Intersorority and Interfraternity
councils.
The meetings were scheduled prior to
allegations that a woman had been raped
in a dormitory last weekend.
The discussions in Branner and Soto

did not focus on the alleged weekend
assault, but instead began with a previous
ly scheduled 30-minute film dramatizing a
day in the life of typical college students.
One segment depicted the effects of
alcohol use by showing scenes of a party in
which a man pressures a woman to get
drunk and then rapes her.
After the video, discussions were led by
volunteers who underwent a three-day
training program last week. At Branner,
about 50 freshmen broke into three
groups. Each group had two facilitators
who discussed alcohol issues and two facil
itators who discussed sexual assault.
At times the students in Branner and
Soto were quiet and had to be prodded by
the facilitators to speak. The discussion at
Soto — attended by about 25 people — was
sprinkled with nervous laughter, though
the facilitators were serious in their pre
sentation.
