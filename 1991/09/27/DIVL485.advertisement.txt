DEMONS, LAWYERS
& THIEVES
A dead realm ruled by golden radiation
Left haunted by wealth and power
Orange opposes the papal empire
Where real peace can never flower
Apiece of red is answered on yellow
Revolving around the fire's glow
Blue lays out the p r oposed solution
Grey turns to a dancing white tango
Dedicated to my grandfather
Joseph Chester Kime (Kime and
Bonebrake, J.C. & E.K., photogra
phers,. Akron.) A pioneer in color
photography, he bought his wife
Margaret "Peg" C. Martin (a high
school classmate of John S Knight
of Knight Ridder) a Willys Knight
(whose namesake WJ. Willy died
with Joseph Patrick Kennedy, Jr. in
1944. (Joe Jr.'s sister Kick's hus
band 'Wil'iam, Marquess of
Hartinaton, also died that year.
(Kick cited in'48.1)) He died of afeo
hprism in i V44 (2/ 2) leaving 3-
children: Joseph, Janet and William
(of DePere, Wl and salesman for
Employers' Insurance of Wausau
(decTd. '86.))
And, to W.E. Wright (son of
Christina Eichenberger) who
helped his brother C. Nelson,
whose only child Richard B. was
born 10/16/28, found the
Wright Tool & Forge Co. in
Barberton, OH in 1V27 before
his death on 1 1/18/29. His obit
uary in the Akron Beacon
Journal, a very interesting piece
appeared on page 1 beneath the
"Announce Wright
Are to be Held at Home;
Rev. Stephen E. Keeler May
Come from Chicago to Officiate
at Rites; Name C of C
Committee," and included a eulo
gy from Harvey Firestone, one of
W.E.'s Florida neighbors, and an
account of how the chauffeur
found him dead in the backseat
of the car on the return trip to the
office from lunch. (The Beacon
Journal, a Krfight Ridder paper
carried an overall headline tha'
day of, "Railroads Speed Up
Building," pertaining to a $ 1
billion program.) Nelson, who
had started out selling tools
from the trunk of his car and
who always kept an oil portraf
of W.E. on the wall across the
top landing of the front stairs in
his home, sufferd a stroke in
May, 1971 (His housekeeper
Avon Yoho, a large woman
whose husband had left her with
no word as to his whereabouts,
found him repeatedly slamming
his dresser.) He was initially tak
en tp the Cleveland Clinic (afte r
being driven around all day)
and then transferred to St.
Thomas in Akron where he died
Easter Sunday, 1972. He was
followed later that year by his
wife Inez Marie Wind. (Bill was
visiting us when the call she had
died unexpectedly came. (She'd
suffered a pulmonary edema at
the nursing home.))
Also, to Miss Helen Kime, o t
tough little old lady, who clung
stubbornly to her Civil War ere
shotgun shack up until her death
there in late 1 983 at about age
90. She would never open a
gift (she kept them upstairs
where no one was allowed to
go) and would never have a
phone in her house.
