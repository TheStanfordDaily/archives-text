In a meeting that Faculty Sen
ate Chair James Sheehan des
cribed as "only a taste of things to
come," professors criticized the
committees charged with ensur
ing faculty input in Stanford's
plan to cut its budget.
The University is attempting
to cut about $40 million from its
operating budget over the next
two years. The shortfall is pri
marily the result of a huge drop
in the indirect-cost recovery rate.
"There is a real issue of legiti
macy, credibility and trust," said
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall at
yesterday's meeting. "I and many
others do not believe that the pro
cess that is being pursued is going
to bring the faculty to the point of
willing, if painful, consensus."
Members of the Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholar
ship at Stanford and its task
forces, which spent much of the
summer preparing a comprehen
sive study of the goals that should
guide the budget-cutting process,
defended their preliminary rec
ommendations.
Committee chair Richard Zare
said the groups had operated
under a severe time constraint
and were required to spend time
learning about fiscal concepts
with which they were unfamiliar.
Zare, a chemistry professor,
also invited input from other fac
ulty at open forums Wednesday
and yesterday evenings and at a
special senate meeting yesterday.
