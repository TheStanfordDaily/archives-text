# Faculty criticize budget panel
## 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Staff writers 
In a meeting that Faculty Sen
ate Chair James Sheehan des
cribed as "only a taste of things to
come," professors criticized the
committees charged with ensur
ing faculty input in Stanford's
plan to cut its budget.
The University is attempting
to cut about $40 million from its
operating budget over the next
two years. The shortfall is pri
marily the result of a huge drop
in the indirect-cost recovery rate.
"There is a real issue of legiti
macy, credibility and trust," said
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall at
yesterday's meeting. "I and many
others do not believe that the pro
cess that is being pursued is going
to bring the faculty to the point of
willing, if painful, consensus."
Members of the Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholar
ship at Stanford and its task
forces, which spent much of the
summer preparing a comprehen
sive study of the goals that should
guide the budget-cutting process,
defended their preliminary rec
ommendations.
Committee chair Richard Zare
said the groups had operated
under a severe time constraint
and were required to spend time
learning about fiscal concepts
with which they were unfamiliar.
Zare, a chemistry professor,
also invited input from other fac
ulty at open forums Wednesday
and yesterday evenings and at a
special senate meeting yesterday.
McCall and Comparative Litera
ture Prof. Mary Pratt said the com
mittee was not aggressive enough
in finding ways to cut administra
tive services so that academic pro
grams might be saved.
'We may well have a crisis of
confidence," Pratt said. "You're
going to have to convince people
that the money (cut from academic
programs) couldn't have been cut
from other parts of the University."
Other senators criticized the
committee for prioritizing excel
lence in scholarship at the expense
of the creative and performing
arts. According to its "Statement
of Goals and Guidelines on the
Eve of Budget Reduction," "dis
tinction and prominence in schol
arship and education are our cen
tral goals."
Art Prof. Albert Elsen said,
"Some of us in the arts are disap
pointed because the premise (of the
recommendations) was excellence
in scholarship but nothing was said
about creativity."

The decision was the result of
the committee's makeup, said
Elsen. "There was nobody (on the
committee) representing the arts. I
think it's a serious omission."
Committee members responded
that some fields have to take prece
dence over others.
"As much as we value the fine
arts, the vision of the committee
was that the more traditional aca
demic enterprises did deserve some
priority over the performing and
creative arts," said History Prof.
George Fredrickson.
Provost James Rosse announced
at the meeting that Stanford's pro
jected operational budget deficit is
still about $40 million. "It hasn't dis
appeared over the summer," he said.
The Senate Committee on
Libraries discussed some of the
effects of last year's "reposition
ing" on the library system and
warned that further cuts could
cause even more problems.
Repositioning was the recently
completed 18-month effort to cut
$22 million from administrative
areas through layoffs and reduc
tion in services.
Robert Street, vice president
for libraries and information

resources, said further cuts of a
magnitude similar to reposition
ing would be devastating.
"We would have to dramatically
cut our resources. We can't take
another big cut and continue to
acquire material at the same rate,"
Street said. "We would have more
material that was not cataloged.
"It would change the nature of
our collections," he added.
Long delays in book reshelving
and incomplete cataloging of new
materials were among the prob
lems noted in a report submitted
by English Prof. David Riggs, chair
of last year's committee.
The University-wide hiring
freeze has also left the position of
associate vice president and direc
tor of libraries unfilled.
Riggs said library staff was cut
by 16 percent during repositioning
— raising concern that with fur
ther cuts the "system may begin to
break down."
"The libraries will be able to
deal with current problems if they
only have to face moderate cuts,"
Riggs said.
Several senate members said
they were upset by the effect of
some of the recent cuts.
