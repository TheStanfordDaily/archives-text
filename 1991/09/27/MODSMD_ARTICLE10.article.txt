With events focusing on every
thing from Freud to fireworks,
the Centennial Celebration was
designed to please everyone.
Planning for the weekend's
events, which include roundtable
discussions, lectures, a parade,
alumni dinners and the Stadium
Spectacular, began in 1985 when
several task forces were con
vened to plan the celebration.
Many people were contacted
for their creative input, and all
ideas were run by a Centennial
Operating Committee consisting
of the University's most senior
faculty and vice presidents,
according to Wolfe.
'We wanted to showcase what
Stanford is all about," said Wolfe,
emphasizing academics, teaching
and research. And the weekend's
events reflect that emphasis.
"There will be four days of
academics and a 2-hour exclama
tion point," she said, referring to
the large-scale performance slat
ed for Monday night.
But some feel the Stadium
Spectacular may overshadow the
rest of the weekend. Over the
past few weeks, the show has
been the lightning rod for criti
cism of the Centennial Celebra

tion, and members of the com
munity have expressed concern
that the glitz of the celebration is
incongruent with the Universi
ty's current financial hard-times.
"I think there's a lot of people
who just want this to be over with
as soon as possible," said Political
Science Prof. John Manley.
"Instead of doing this sort of
hoopla, in my view we should be
examining who we are. We should
be asking ourselves hard questions
instead of setting off fireworks."
But others are less critical in
their appraisal of the planned cel
ebration. "I really do think Stan
ford has a lot to be proud of after
100 years," said COP member
John Overdeck. "It would be tak
ing a pretty narrow view to say
we had nothing to celebrate."
"It's fine as long as it makes a

profit," he said.
And although the celebration
will not actually earn money for
the school, it was designed to
break even, a goal Susan Wolfe
believes to be reasonable, despite
lackluster ticket sales.
The Stadium Spectacular,
Centennial Gaieties and alumni
events such as meals and dances
on the Quad will all bring in rev
enue, she said. And each regis
trant paid a $20 fee to offset the
weekend's administrative costs.
In light of budget cuts, Wolfe
said there was a question as to
whether a celebration was appro
priate. However, she said the
money for the weekend's events
came from funds raised specifi
cally for the Centennial and
could not be used for other, more
general University purposes.
According to Wolfe, 10,098
alumni preregistered for the week
end's events, and another 1,000
are expected to attend. However,
the celebration has left some stu
dents feeling left out in the cold.
"I would have liked to see
events geared more toward stu
dents. I don't think students feel
a part," said COP member Beth
Morgan.
