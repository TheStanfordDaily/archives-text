Stanford's six-year Centennial Celebration
began in 1985 with a small ceremony in Memorial
Church — a long way from the multimillion-dol
lar extravaganza planned for this weekend.
On Nov. 11, 1985, the centennial of the Uni
versity's 1885 founding grant, Cornell University
President Frank Rhodes spoke at a convocation of
students and faculty. He said Stanford, while
modeled in many respects after Harvard Universi
ty and Cornell, has "in many ways, succeeded
more brilliantly than either."
During the six years since that convocation,
Centennial events have ranged from moonlit
dances on the Quad to academic symposia to
meetings of principal world leaders.
The May 1987 Centennial Cornerstone Week
end, the anniversary of the laying of the Universi
ty's cornerstone, featured the first joint meeting

of North America's three major Secretaries of
State: Joseph Clark of Canada, Bernard Sepulve
da of Mexico and George Shultz of the United
States. Shultz, who organized the meeting, is now
a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution.
The weekend of keynote speeches, faculty pre
sentations, moonlit dancing and fireworks on the
Quad drew a crowd of 10,000.
For the Centennial Finale, two major North
American leaders will come to Stanford: Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Mulroney will
speak at a convocation Sunday, and Salinas will
deliver an address at a similar event Monday. Gov.
Pete Wilson will speak Tuesday evening.
Salinas and Mulroney have previously met
Shultz and University President Donald Kennedy
at Stanford's International Centennial Celebra
tions in Mexico City and Toronto last February
and March.
