## 'Biospherians' to be sealed up for two years 
### 
ORACLE, Ariz. (AP) — Four
men and four women on Thurs
day embarked on a two-year
journey inside a stationary glass
ark — a fast-food-free trip into
what they hope will be an envi
ronmentally sounder future of
planetary colonies.
The eight are stewards of Bio
sphere II, a self-sustaining envi
ronment materially sealed off
from the world they call Bio
sphere I — the Earth. The pri
vate, for-profit project is intend
ed to develop technology to colo
nize space and improve and
understand the Earth.
"It is a brave new step," said
crew member Abigail Ailing, 31,
of New York. Her voice cracking
with emotion, she called the pro
ject "a reminder that our future
is not fixed and not final and
ever evolving."
At sendoff ceremonies before
about 1,000 people, Dr. Roy Wal
ford, the oldest crew member,
said, "We are fearful but loving;
we court what lurks in the
labyrinth, pledging at all odds to
make ours an honest destiny."
After the brief ceremony, the
crew members ranging in age
from 27 to 67 waved to onlook
ers, exchanged final hugs and
kisses with relatives and stepped
through airlocks into the 3.15-
acre compound that rises out of
the desert 30 miles northeast of
Tucson.
After the doors closed, the
crew stopped to wave briefly

through a window, then disap
peared into the main building.
Inside the glass-and-steel
geodesic-framed complex the
size of three football fields are a
rain forest with waterfall, ocean
with coral reef, savannah,
marshes, farm and a modern
human habitat.
From it, the "biospherians"
will guide the fortunes of 3,800
plant and animal species on
which they'll depend for their
food and with which they'll
share air, water and waste recy
cling. Planners wanted to use
solar panels, but because of the
expense opted for generators
powered by natural gas — the
only import from the outside
world.
The crew's apartments
include such luxury items as
computers, facsimile machines,
telephones, televisions, video
cassette recorders and exercise
equipment.
Communications apparatus
will tie them into a control cen
ter a few hundred yards away,
and to the rest of the world.
Space Biospheres Ventures, the
developer, allows paying tourists
to visit, though they can't pene
trate the seals that contain the
environment.
Sex has not been ruled out
among the crew members, but
pregnancy has.
The "closure" ceremony
began with a sunrise prayer ser
vice.
