More nationals arrested
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli security forces
have rounded up nearly 500 Palestinian
activists in the past two months, including some
suspected of murdering suspected Arab collabo
rators, the military command said Thursday.
The army said nearly 300 activists from the
occupied West Bank and Jerusalem area and
some 170 from the Gaza Strip were arrested. All
belonged to the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine organization, the army
said.
The army said the arrested Palestinians were
suspected of shooting and hand grenade attacks
on army patrols and of murdering at least 20
Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel.
Soviets need U.S. aid
NEW YORK (AP) — Soviet Foreign Minister
Boris Pankin said Thursday his country needs
direct assistance from the United States to sur
vive the winter.
"We need help and assistance from the Unit
ed States as a country in order to survive the
winter and to solve all the problems concerning
the transition" to a Western-style economy,
Pankin said after a meeting with Secretary of
State James Baker .
The Bush administration is providing
humanitarian assistance, and the Agriculture
Department increased guarantees for commer
cial bank loans to help the Soviets purchase
grain and soybeans.
But President Bush has made direct U.S.
assistance conditional on the Soviets' revamping
their economy.
Baker gave no indication that approach had
been changed in his meeting with Pankin, which
will be continued today.
Judge bans pregnancy
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A homeless
mother of four who violated her probation for
credit imrd fraud will go to jail if she gets preg
nant again while on probation, a federal judge
ruled.
"I'm not sure this has ever been done," U.S.
District Judge Joseph E. Stevens said in impos
ing the sentence Wednesday. "It may be ques
tioned. But I think it makes sense."
Stevens also ordered Kimberly M. Tatum, 23,
to complete treatment for cocaine dependency.
If she violates either condition, Stevens said, she
would be subject to a two-year prison term.
Tatum violated her probation by using
cocaine and failing to report to her probation
officer after being released from prison last May,
prosecutors said. She had served four months
for using stolen credit cards.
Students burn barricades
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) - Black
students at one of the nation's most prestigious
universities disrupted classes and set up burn
ing barricades Thursday in support of striking
maintenance workers.
But the protesters at the predominantly
white University of Cape Town were unable to
close down the school as they did Wednesday in
a show of support for the workers, who struck
Tuesday.
About 300 university workers, mostly main
tenance personnel, went on strike Tuesday after
rejecting a 13.5 percent pay increase. South
Africa's annual inflation rate is 15 percent.
The university called off classes Wednesday
amid student threats to disrupt them. Thursday
morning, the black students erected burning
barricades at most entrances to campus, over
turned garbage cans and marched across the
university grounds singing protest songs.
