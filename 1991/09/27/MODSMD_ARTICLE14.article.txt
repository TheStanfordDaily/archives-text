# U.N. accepts Iraqi proposal

### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Moving to
defuse the latest standoff with Saddam
Hussein, the Security Council yesterday
accepted an Iraqi proposal aimed at ending
the three-day detention of U.N. weapons
inspectors in Baghdad.
The inspectors have been held in a
Baghdad parking lot since they uncovered
documents describing Iraq's secret nuclear
weapons program.
Under the plan, diplomats said the doc
uments, photographs and videotapes will
stay in the possession of the inspectors
while they and Iraqi authorities prepare a
catalog of them.
Iraq had initially demanded that the
team relinquish the documents, which the
inspectors refused to do.
Later, the council also issued a state
ment saying that it "deplores Iraq's repeat
ed violations of its obligations" under U.N.
resolutions demanding its cooperation
with the destruction of its terror weapons.
The statement said the council "reiter
ates its demand that the inspectors ... be
released immediately," but didn't object to
a joint inventory of documents and materi
als "in this particular case."
Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special
Commission charged with disposing of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, esti
mated it would take less than 24 hours to
catalog all the documents, film and video
tape, and that not all 44 inspectors would
be needed for the task. However, it was not
certain when the inspectors might actually
be released.
Ekeus said "we are not talking hours"
before the team is released because
arrangements need to be made with the
Iraqis. But he added: "We have worked out
very sound arrangements, and we expect
Iraq to say 'yes' to that, and then we can
work quickly."
Earlier yesterday, Iraqi citizens held
government-sanctioned demonstrations

across the nation accusing the U.N. arms
experts of being spies. "Death to the ene
mies of Iraq!" chanted the demonstrators,
the official Iraqi News Agency said.
Encircled by Iraqi troops, the inspectors
have struggled to keep their spirits high,
holding lotteries to make calls home and
improvising touch football games, the U.N.
team's American leader said yesteday.
"Everyone's in very good spirits, good
health," David Kay told The Associated
Press in a satellite telephone interview
from Baghdad.
Before the Security Council decision,
Kay said the inspectors had the ability to
catalog the documents if U.N. officials
decided they should do so.
"All we need to know is what are the
guidelines and what is practically required,
and we'll worry about finding ways to do it
once policy is set," he said.
Kay said the documents were secured in
one of the cars "in the centci of our little
circle" in the parking lot.
In Vienna, meanwhile, David Kyd of the
International Atomic Energy Agency said
yesterday that information from an Iraqi
defector, as well as from other sources, had
helped the U.N. team locate key documents
about the Iraqi nuclear weapons program.
He said the IAEA did not deal directly
with the defector, however.
The confrontation over the documents
came as the Persian Gulf War allies
stepped up pressure on Iraq to comply with
resolutions of the Gulf War cease-fire call
ing for the destruction of Scud missiles as
well as any nuclear, biological or chemical
weapons or production facilities.
Additional U.S. forces are being sent to
neighboring Saudi Arabia amid the escalat
ing tensions. The United States on
Wednesday began moving Patriot anti-mis
sile units to the Persian Gulf in case the
Security Council orders military escorts for
U.N. teams searching Iraq.
