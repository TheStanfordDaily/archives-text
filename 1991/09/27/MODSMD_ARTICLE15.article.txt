# Marlboro man settles suit

SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - A
cancer-stricken model who depicted
the robust "Marlboro man" in adver
tisements agreed to settle his mal
practice lawsuit against a doctor who
allegedly failed to diagnose a tumor.
The out-of-court settlement was
announced Wednesday, but terms
were not disclosed.
"I don't think there's any com
pensation that could ever be arrived
at that would be satisfactory," said
Wayne McLaren, 49, of Corona del

Mar. "How much is a man's life
worth?"
McLaren, a pack-and-a-half-a-day
smoker for about 25 years, was fea
tured in 1975 print ads as the "Marl
boro Man."
Chemotherapy and radiation
treatment appeared to successfully
kill the cancer, but it was learned in
January that the cancer had spread
to McLaren's brain, and he was given
only a few years to live, his lawyer
said.
