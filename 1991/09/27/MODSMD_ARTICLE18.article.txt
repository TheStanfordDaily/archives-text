## Watch the watchdog 
### 
How far can regulator
Paul Biddle go in his
quest for reparations?

THE WATCHDOG IS begin
ning to look like a campaigner.
Paul Biddle, the blustery cam
pus regulator from the Office of Naval
Research who brought Stanford's
questionable indirect cost accounting
practices to light, has always been
skilled at using the media.
He had to be.
Although his is certainly not a
case of David vs. Goliath, he still
faced strong odds in changing the
status quo. His predecessors and
superiors had made many question
able agreements with the University.
And Stanford, although often in the
headlines for political and academic
controversies, had been above even
the appearance of ethical reproach.
It is natural for a regulator facing
obstacles to wage a public media
campaign to force change. The tax
payers pay Biddle to make sure
Stanford is held accountable for
government funds.
But recent events have called into
question Biddle's role as watchdog
for the people. Biddle has begun to
act more like a common politician
than a regulator.
Biddle has filed a personal suit
against the University under a watch
dog statute designed to hold govern
ment contractors accountable.
The suit is known in legal terms
as a qui tam, which an individual
files on behalf of all U.S. taxpayers.
In a letter to Rep. John Dingell,
chairman of the House subcommit
tee that has investigated Stanford's
indirect cost practices, Biddle writes
that he has filed the suit to prevent
the Office of Naval Research from
making an agreement that is too
lenient with Stanford. Biddle wants
the University to repay the $200
million he says it has overbilled the
government during the last decade.
But that is only part of the picture.
Biddle's suit makes him eligible to

receive a percentage of the court settle
ment himself. What's more, University
officials have questioned whether a
person taking legal action against
Stanford can be an impartial regulator.
The notable part of Biddle's suit
is that his motivations are transpar
ent. One wouldn't be surprised if he
were to run for elected office or go
trolling for a plum assignment from
a Washington ally.
He even sounds like a campaigner.
"One can only be flexed so many
times and then, as with metal, an
individual will break," Biddle wrote
to Dingell. "I feel God must have
been working overtime to allow me
to contend even this long."
He is also making another public
ity blitz. Posed photographs abound.
Biddle's face even appeared above
the masthead of a local newspaper.
The issue is not Biddle's future,
but rather Stanford's.
Politicians are notorious for find
ing an issue, then exploiting it to
increase their power, without
regard to damage caused.
University President Donald
Kennedy will resign next year.
Stanford's top financial officers
have resigned. The University
must live with radically fewer gov
ernment dollars. And Stanford is
burned, at least temporarily, with
the Scarlet T of indirect costs.
The University has been willing
to pay a high price to begin to
regain public confidence.
But there is at least one punish
ment the Stanford community
should not accept. That is to be the
fodder for a modern-day, Machi
avellian regulator.
Community members should
take criticism to heart and contin
ue pressure for reform.
But the community should not
be used for the political ambitions
of Paul Biddle.
The problem is that just as Biddle
has been skilled at using the media
to promote necessary change, he is
also astute at using the media to
promote himself.
The only way Stanford will not aid
the watchdog's campaign is for Biddle
to be thrown out with the bathwater.
