## U.S. offer a disgrace to Philippine pride 
### Marianne Villanueva 
I HAVE LIVED IN THIS country for
12 years even though I can't recall
ever having made a conscious decision
to do so. It was just something expected
— finishing my studies, then applying for
a job and the green card and eventually
perhaps, citizenship. This is not an atyp
ical pattern among Filipinos. Perhaps
America is so much in our aspirations
that to come here seems more of a natu
ral progression, like getting married or
getting a better job, than a bold under
taking.
But I still didn't know what it really
meant to live here. I never realized the
vast gulf that existed between here and
back home until I returned home last
summer and witnessed the devastation
caused by a volcanic eruption. Pinatubo,
as the volcano is called, had not exploded
since 1380. Last summer, however, it
decided to unleash a dreadful mud flow
that killed 300 people and displaced
80,000 more, destroyed one of our most
fertile agricultural regions and threw our
already terrible balance of payments into
a seemingly irreparable nose dive.
There were two things on everyone's
mind this summer in Manila: the lahar,
as the mixture of volcanic ash and mud
that engulfed three provinces came to be
called, and the military Bases Treaty.
The whole nation felt generally depressed
about the lahar. The bases, however,
were more complicated. Everyone I
talked to seemed to want the bases to
stay.
The news that America was abandon

ing the Clark base because it had been
severely damaged by Pinatubo had a
dulling effect; people seemed to walk
around in a mixture of disgust and appre
hension — disgust at the slowness of our
Foreign Secretary in closing it and appre
hension about the consequences of a total
American pullout.
But mixed in with this reaction was
also an element of anger. The $800 mil
lion that the Foreign Secretary had
promised would be forthcoming had
turned out to be a pathetic fiction. Now it
was revealed that the Americans were
only paying $203 million, the last $3 mil
lion having been squeezed out after sev
eral days of hard bargaining by the
Philippines.
The people, already so put upon by last
year's earthquake and drought and by
this year's volcanic eruption, were soured
even further by this latest American
offer, and they began to show their
resentment through talk of how "cheap"
the Americans were.
I must admit that I, too, was disap
pointed by the American offer. Perhaps
we should have been more realistic, given
that the "new world order" looks more
and more like a one-superpower world,
and America has less need for military
outposts like Clark and Subic. But I
somehow expected that America would
recognize the desperate need of our peo
ple for aid, and that it would be generous.
Perhaps I lost sight of the fact that "busi
ness is business."
When you're in a country with a 20

percent rate of inflation, where homeless
children wander the streets in the wee
hours of the morning, tugging at your
arms and knocking at car windows, when
all the news you read in the papers every
day is about more devastation wreaked
by the latest natural disaster, it is very
hard to be objective. And when you hear
the Americans hard-nosing it with lines
like "not one dollar more," and threats to
pull out completely, well, then you begin
to feel that the only thing you have left,
after all, is your pride.
This is something Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney, President George
Bush and the head of the American nego
tiating team don't seem to understand.
The Filipinos realize that they have the
weaker bargaining position. They realize
they are the beggars. They know they
can't be choosers. They desperately see
the need for the American money. And
this awareness is so humiliating that per
haps it is too much to expect that we will
welcome this offer of $203 million with
open arms, like grateful children.
When I left the Philippines, I was very
glad to be back in California. I was glad to
be away from the volcanic ash and the
poverty and general depression of the
people. But I was still sore about the
bases.
There goes that old Filipino pride
again. I hope I never lose it.
