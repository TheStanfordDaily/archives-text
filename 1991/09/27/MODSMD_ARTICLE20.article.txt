## Philippines beware: Base treaty a political must 
### Bruce Bueno de Mesquita 
HAD THE PHILIPPINE SENATE
voted five years ago not to renew
the treaty granting the United
States access to Subic Bay, their decision
would have proven dangerous for U.S.
(and Philippine) security. Today, howev
er, the disagreement over the treaty is
reduced to a regrettable tiff between
friends with few significant national secu
rity consequences for the United States.
Subic Bay is the lone significant U.S.
naval outpost between Pearl Harbor and
the Mediterranean. It is the key place for
American ships to be repaired and serviced
in that part of the world. The United
States has long recognized that political
upheaval in the Philippines could result in
the termination of its access to Subic Bay.
That is one reason for the development of
new naval facilities elsewhere.
How will the Bush administration
respond to the Philippine decision? Prob
ably with disappointment, but with little
long-term consequence for its friendly
relations with that country. There is
some concern that the United States will
withhold economic assistance as a pun

ishment for the perceived Filipino trucu
lence in closing down Subic Bay. This
would be consequential for the Philip
pines if it were to happen, but it would be
foolish for the United States.
The loss of the Subic Bay naval base
will cost the Philippines annually the
$305 million the United States pays for
its use, as well as more than $100 million
in salaries paid to the 25,000 employees
at the base. The Philippines will also lose
the vast sums of money spent by Ameri
can sailors. But it is unlikely American
economic assistance will be significantly
influenced. Indeed, the demonstration of
independence by the Philippine Senate
may increase U.S. assistance over the
longer term.
Generally, foreign aid is provided
either for humanitarian purposes or to
advance security or economic interests.
At the margin, the latter aid appears to
go to nations that are neither staunch
allies nor intransigent opponents. Aid is
generally spent where it can have the
biggest effect, on the pivotal states. The
actions of the Philippine Senate are a sig

nal that the Philippines may no longer be
counted on as the unwavering ally that
they have been. In response, the United
States may be more willing to help bol
ster their friendship.
Closing Subic Bay will have more con
sequence for the Philippines than for the
United States. Democratic institutions
are fragile in the Philippines. Since the
fall of the Marcos dictatorship, there
have been several attempts to overthrow
the Aquino government.
On the left is a once-strong, but now
rather enfeebled, guerrilla movement.
They are not likely to be a major threat
because the collapse of communism ends
their principle sources of backing. On the
right, real threats to continuing democra
cy exist. There are still many powerful
backers of the erstwhile Marcos regime.
Not everyone in the military shares
the vision of the Philippine armed forces
as a professional service that stands out
side of the political fray. Several former
allies of President Aquino's aspire to
head the Philippines and each has popu
lar support. Some have alleged that they
were involved in some recent coup
attempts.
The withdrawal of U.S. forces frees
opponents to attack the fledgling Filipino
democracy. The United States will not be
there to shore up the government as it
did during the most recent coup attempt.

American air power and intelligence were
critical to the survival of the popularly
elected Aquino government.
Democracy faces a tough road in the
Philippines. Its future prospects are
dimmed by the loss of hundreds of mil
lions of dollars in revenues and by the
necessary increased Philippine expendi
tures of time, energy and money on inter
national security. But that is the price for
the greater autonomy sought by the
Philippine Senate. Let us hope that the
Senate can survive its own choice.
