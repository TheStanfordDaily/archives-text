# Tainted Mexican president poor choice for Centennial address
## 
### 
ON MONDAY, SEPT. 30, Mexican
President Carlos Salinas will deliv
er the keynote address for the
finale of the Stanford Centennial Cele
bration. In light of Salinas' appearance
on campus, some publicly-known facts
about the Salinas government may be of
interest to the Stanford community.
As president of Mexico, Salinas is the
hand-picked successor to the previous
president and also the de facto head of the
Partido Revolucionario Institucional
(PRI), which has ruled Mexico, uninter
rupted, since the 1920s. The PRI has
managed to maintain its position of
power through repeated and widespread
electoral fraud.
Over the past few years, this fraud has
been periodically chronicled by such
respected publications as The New York
Times and the Los Angeles Times. Sali
nas' election to the presidency in 1988
was openly described as the product of
widespread electoral fraud.

In a recent article written for the Los
Angeles Times, Jorge Castaneda, the
noted political scientist from the National
Autonomous University of Mexico and
the University of California at Berkeley,
reported on the type of electronic manipu
lation of electoral lists and misappropria
tion of public funds that contributed to
the PRI's success at the polls in local and
gubernatorial elections held this summer.
The Mexican government has also
been declared guilty of repeated viola
tions of basic human rights. In the past

severed years, reports of the 162 PRI
linked killings of activists and members
of opposition parties, particularly in the
north of Mexico, have surfaced in U.S.
newspapers. In fact, only last week, the
San Jose Mercury News reported that the
human rights group Americas Watch had
once again cited the Mexican federal
police for human rights violations. It has
been proven that, as a matter of course,
the police torture their prisoners during
questioning.
Salinas will purport to speak to Stan

ford about the importance of education.
His choice is highly ironic in view of the
state of public education throughout
Mexico. At the university level, Salinas'
government has been reproached for its
lack of attention to provincial universi
ties, and the National Autonomous Uni
versity, a bastion of free higher education
in Mexico, is in physical shambles. At the
basic level, many primary and secondary
schools in rural areas, and even in the
capital city, also lack such elementary
amenities as floors, roofs, blackboards
and running water.
In the 1985 earthquake, among the build
ings that fell in Mexico City were a number
of government primary and secondary
schools. Innocent children and their teach
ers perished because school buildings erect
ed by the Mexican government did not meet
minimum safety standards, yet the neces
sary funds had been officially appropriated
for minimally safe schools to be built.
And, finally, one cannot forget the

numerous other innocent victims of the
quake — the inhabitants of government
built-and-subsidized housing projects
and the thousands of doctors, nurses and
patients in the government hospitals that
crumbled from the force of the quake.
In light of all the information that has
been publicly disseminated by reputable
sources about the PRI's governing of
Mexico, one cannot help but ask why, of
all candidates for keynote speaker at
Stanford's Centennial, the PRI president
of Mexico was selected. The Centennial is
intended to reflect and celebrate Stan
ford's progress in education over the past
century, the kind of progress character
ized by respect and appreciation of
humanitarian, democratic beliefs and
practices.
It will, indeed, be a shameful moment for
Stanford when Salinas takes the podium as
the keynote speaker at the Centennial.
