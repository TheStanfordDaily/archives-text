# OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY ANNOUNCEMENT DEAN OF STUDENTS OFFICE
## STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL 
### 
Student conduct is guided by the
Fundamental Standard, which states the
expectation that students will act in ways that
demonstrate respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others.
Implicit in the Standard is the understanding
that students are responsible for making their
own decisions and accepting the
consequences of those decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about
alcohol use, students and others should be
aware of the health and safety risks associated
with its use, as well as the state and local laws
about possessing, serving and consuming
alcohol. It is widely recognized that the misuse
and abuse of drugs ("controlled substances")*
and the abuse of alcohol are major
contributors to serious health problems as well
as to social and civic concerns. The health risks
associated with the use of illicit drugs and the
abuse of alcohol include various deleterious
physical and mental consequences including
addiction, severe disability, and death.
Information concerning the known effects of
alcohol and specific drugs is available from the
Alcohol and Drug Information Center at the
Cowell Student Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and
alcohol abuse and the human and material
costs associated with it. The University, as an
educational institution, approaches student
conduct issues from a perspective that places
greater emphasis on individual responsibility
and development than on regulatory
measures. Consequently, education about and
prevention of alcohol-related problems will
continue to be our primary emphasis.
Moreover, it is the intention of the University
that students as individuals and as members
of groups will conduct themselves in
accordance with this and all other University
policies governing student conduct.
*Controlled substances are those defined in
21 U.S.C. 812 and include, but are not limited
to, such substances as marijuana, heroin,
cocaine and amphetamines.
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to
maintain a drug-free workplace and campus.
The unlawful manufacture, distribution,
dispensation, possession, and/or use of
controlled substances or the unlawful
possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is
prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the
workplace, or as part of any of the University's
activities. The workplace and campus are
presumed to include all Stanford premises
where the activities of the University are
conducted. Violation of this policy may result
in disciplinary sanctions up to and including
termination of employment or expulsion of
students. Violations may also be referred to
the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
This policy will be reviewed at least biennially.
Some Applications
■ No University funds or funds collected by
the University may be used in a way which
violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who
are 21 or oldec and residence staff members
often are in the 21 or older age range, the
fact remains that the great majority of
residents of an all-frosh dormitory are minors.
Consequently, it is hard to imagine how
house dues for all-frosh residences could be
used to buy alcohol without violating both
state law and University policy.
■ Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless
of how money is collected, all provisions of
the policy apply to all students, faculty, and
staff.
■ Event planners will be held individually and
collectively responsible for planning and
carrying out events in compliance with the
policy. One or more house/organization
officers must assume responsibility for the
events compliance with the alcohol policy.
These officers' names must be made available
to the police and to the University upon
request.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will
be the preferred response to infractions
unaccompanied by more egregious conduct.
However, behavior could run the gamut from
a simple Minor in Possession (of alcohol) with
no prior disciplinary history to drunken
behavior resulting in loss of life. Penalties will
be calibrated according to the severity of the
misconduct. Behavior associated with drug or
alcohol use and abuse may constitute one or
more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence
agreement or Terms and Conditions of
Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting the student
to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions
of recognition, subjecting the student to

expulsion from the organization and/or the
organizations loss of University recognition
and associated privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard,
subjecting the student to University discipline
which includes as a possible outcome
suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but
rather is an aggravating circumstance. A
student's careless or willful reduction, through
the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of his
or her own ability to think clearly, exercise
good judgment, and respond to rational
intervention is considered grounds for more
stringent penalties than might be levied
otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to
have violated the policy are subject, as groups,
to University sanctions such as suspension of
social privileges and loss of University
recognition, meeting space, and housing, if
applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is
complex, it is important to know that under
some circumstances party hosts, sponsors,
bartenders, or others may be held legally liable
for the consequences of serving alcohol to
underaged drinkers or to obviously intoxicated
persons.
Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the
enforcement of state and local laws. Students
and others on campus who violate the law
may be and have been arrested and
prosecuted, primary responsibility for law
enforcement, including that related to alcohol,
rests with law enforcement agencies, primarily
the Stanford Police Department. Uniformed
officers who patrol the campus and respond to
calls are deputized by the sheriff of Santa Clara
County and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and
enforce all laws. Laws are subject to change;
consequently, the following information is
illustrative but must not be relied upon as a
complete and current citing of relevant laws.
More information is available at the Stanford
Department of Public Safety, 711 Serra Street.
Generally, as of September, 1990, it is a
criminal offense:

THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD
UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident
Fellows ("residence staff") at Stanford is
principally educational, advisory, and
developmental. It is crucial that students trust
their residence staff members and feel
comfortable confiding in them, turning to
them freely for assistance whenever they
need it. As role models and as employees and
agents of the University, residence staff

members are expected to work with students in
the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help
ensure that students are made aware of
University policy, pertinent California law, and
the health risks associated with the use and
abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible
party planning and management and help
students in their efforts to abide by the event
planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should
work closely with residents to create and
maintain a safe and healthful residential
environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not
expected to police or monitor the conduct of
students, or to receive or act upon reports of
violations. They are expected to exercise the
same judgment concerning this policy as they
do with other University policies. For example,
they must continue to intervene and exercise
responsible guidance any time they are aware
of any situation that is threatening to the health
or safety of individuals or groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND
ALCOHOL POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist
students in planning and managing events in
ways that are in compliance with the
Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy. The
guidelines apply to all students planning events
on the Stanford campus or any off-campus
University program or activity. The list below,
drawn up for events at which alcohol will be
served, is not exhaustive. Individuals and
groups are responsible for developing strategies
for planning and carrying out events that are
safe and in compliance with University policy.
■If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it
an adjunct to the event, not the center of it.
■Ensure that non-alcoholic drinks (EANABS) are
at least as accessible and attractive as, and
more plentiful than, alcoholic drinks. The
amount of alcohol provided should be
reasonable and in proportion to the number of
event participants who are legally able to drink.
■Create an atmosphere in which people are
encouraged to interact, and are helped to feel
comfortable — have something for people to
do besides just stand around and drink.

■ Encourage moderation by using moderate
sized glasses and cups.
■Have the alcohol in a secure part of the
room where access can be readily controlled.
Ensure that it is attended at all times, and
have it served rather than leaving it open to
self-service. Make sure that servers have been
trained in responsible alcohol serving.
■ Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before
the end of the event, and make sure you
have plenly of other beverages and snacks
left to serve at this time.
■ Refuse to serve someone who has had too
much to drink.
■ Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
■ If the event is advertised, do not mention
alcohol in the publicity.
■ If the event is open to people who are not
known to the residence or the organization,
take extra precautions to guard against
problems such as theft, assault, drunken
driving, individuals wandering off in need of
assistance, and possible injuries. While any of
these concerns can arise among people who
know each other, experience shows that they
are more common when gatherings are large
■ High school students should be afforded
vigorous protection from access to alcohol, if
they are allowed to attend the event at all. It
is generally wiser to restrict attendance to
college-aged people or older.
■ Designate plenty of sober monitors to help
manage the party. Station them at the front
door and in the area where alcohol is being
served, and have some circulate inside and
outside the house to check other possible
means of entry, attend to house security
respond to problems, and so forth.
■ Emphasize to the group sponsoring the
event (e.g., a residence, a fraternal group, a
student voluntary organization), that it is each
member's responsibility to ensure that the
event is managed well and to exercise care
for the well-being of all participants.
■ Exercise care and authority in hiring the
band. Do not permit members to bring
minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
■ Control the noise of the event. The farther
away it can be heard, the more likely you'll
draw complaints and unwanted guests.

THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD
UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident
Fellows ("residence staff") at Stanford is
principally educational, advisory, and
developmental. It is crucial that students trust
their residence staff members and feel
comfortable confiding in them, turning to
them freely for assistance whenever they
need it. As role models and as employees and
agents of the University, residence staff

members are expected to work with students in
the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help
ensure that students are made aware of
University policy, pertinent California law, and
the health risks associated with the use and
abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible
party planning and management and help
students in their efforts to abide by the event
planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should
work closely with residents to create and
maintain a safe and healthful residential
environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not
expected to police or monitor the conduct of
students, or to receive or act upon reports of
violations. They are expected to exercise the
same judgment concerning this policy as they
do with other University policies. For example,
they must continue to intervene and exercise
responsible guidance any time they are aware
of any situation that is threatening to the health
or safety of individuals or groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND
ALCOHOL POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist
students in planning and managing events in
ways that are in compliance with the
Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy. The
guidelines apply to all students planning events
on the Stanford campus or any off-campus
University program or activity. The list below,
drawn up for events at which alcohol will be
served, is not exhaustive. Individuals and
groups are responsible for developing strategies
for planning and carrying out events that are
safe and in compliance with University policy.
■If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it
an adjunct to the event, not the center of it.
■Ensure that non-alcoholic drinks (EANABS) are
at least as accessible and attractive as, and
more plentiful than, alcoholic drinks. The
amount of alcohol provided should be
reasonable and in proportion to the number of
event participants who are legally able to drink.
■Create an atmosphere in which people are
encouraged to interact, and are helped to feel
comfortable — have something for people to
do besides just stand around and drink.

■ Encourage moderation by using moderate
sized glasses and cups.
■Have the alcohol in a secure part of the
room where access can be readily controlled.
Ensure that it is attended at all times, and
have it served rather than leaving it open to
self-service. Make sure that servers have been
trained in responsible alcohol serving.
■ Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before
the end of the event, and make sure you
have plenly of other beverages and snacks
left to serve at this time.
■ Refuse to serve someone who has had too
much to drink.
■ Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
■ If the event is advertised, do not mention
alcohol in the publicity.
■ If the event is open to people who are not
known to the residence or the organization,
take extra precautions to guard against
problems such as theft, assault, drunken
driving, individuals wandering off in need of
assistance, and possible injuries. While any of
these concerns can arise among people who
know each other, experience shows that they
are more common when gatherings are large
■ High school students should be afforded
vigorous protection from access to alcohol, if
they are allowed to attend the event at all. It
is generally wiser to restrict attendance to
college-aged people or older.
■ Designate plenty of sober monitors to help
manage the party. Station them at the front
door and in the area where alcohol is being
served, and have some circulate inside and
outside the house to check other possible
means of entry, attend to house security
respond to problems, and so forth.
■ Emphasize to the group sponsoring the
event (e.g., a residence, a fraternal group, a
student voluntary organization), that it is each
member's responsibility to ensure that the
event is managed well and to exercise care
for the well-being of all participants.
■ Exercise care and authority in hiring the
band. Do not permit members to bring
minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
■ Control the noise of the event. The farther
away it can be heard, the more likely you'll
draw complaints and unwanted guests.
Student conduct is guided by the
Fundamental Standard, which states the
expectation that students will act in ways that
demonstrate respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others.
Implicit in the Standard is the understanding
that students are responsible for making their
own decisions and accepting the
consequences of those decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about
alcohol use, students and others should be
aware of the health and safety risks associated
with its use, as well as the state and local laws
about possessing, serving and consuming
alcohol. It is widely recognized that the misuse
and abuse of drugs ("controlled substances")*
and the abuse of alcohol are major
contributors to serious health problems as well
as to social and civic concerns. The health risks
associated with the use of illicit drugs and the
abuse of alcohol include various deleterious
physical and mental consequences including
addiction, severe disability, and death.
Information concerning the known effects of
alcohol and specific drugs is available from the
Alcohol and Drug Information Center at the
Cowell Student Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and
alcohol abuse and the human and material
costs associated with it. The University, as an
educational institution, approaches student
conduct issues from a perspective that places
greater emphasis on individual responsibility
and development than on regulatory
measures. Consequently, education about and
prevention of alcohol-related problems will
continue to be our primary emphasis.
Moreover, it is the intention of the University
that students as individuals and as members
of groups will conduct themselves in
accordance with this and all other University
policies governing student conduct.
*Controlled substances are those defined in
21 U.S.C. 812 and include, but are not limited
to, such substances as marijuana, heroin,
cocaine and amphetamines.
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to
maintain a drug-free workplace and campus.
The unlawful manufacture, distribution,
dispensation, possession, and/or use of
controlled substances or the unlawful
possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is
prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the
workplace, or as part of any of the University's
activities. The workplace and campus are
presumed to include all Stanford premises
where the activities of the University are
conducted. Violation of this policy may result
in disciplinary sanctions up to and including
termination of employment or expulsion of
students. Violations may also be referred to
the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
This policy will be reviewed at least biennially.
Some Applications
■ No University funds or funds collected by
the University may be used in a way which
violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who
are 21 or oldec and residence staff members
often are in the 21 or older age range, the
fact remains that the great majority of
residents of an all-frosh dormitory are minors.
Consequently, it is hard to imagine how
house dues for all-frosh residences could be
used to buy alcohol without violating both
state law and University policy.
■ Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless
of how money is collected, all provisions of
the policy apply to all students, faculty, and
staff.
■ Event planners will be held individually and
collectively responsible for planning and
carrying out events in compliance with the
policy. One or more house/organization
officers must assume responsibility for the
events compliance with the alcohol policy.
These officers' names must be made available
to the police and to the University upon
request.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will
be the preferred response to infractions
unaccompanied by more egregious conduct.
However, behavior could run the gamut from
a simple Minor in Possession (of alcohol) with
no prior disciplinary history to drunken
behavior resulting in loss of life. Penalties will
be calibrated according to the severity of the
misconduct. Behavior associated with drug or
alcohol use and abuse may constitute one or
more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence
agreement or Terms and Conditions of
Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting the student
to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions
of recognition, subjecting the student to

expulsion from the organization and/or the
organizations loss of University recognition
and associated privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard,
subjecting the student to University discipline
which includes as a possible outcome
suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but
rather is an aggravating circumstance. A
student's careless or willful reduction, through
the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of his
or her own ability to think clearly, exercise
good judgment, and respond to rational
intervention is considered grounds for more
stringent penalties than might be levied
otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to
have violated the policy are subject, as groups,
to University sanctions such as suspension of
social privileges and loss of University
recognition, meeting space, and housing, if
applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is
complex, it is important to know that under
some circumstances party hosts, sponsors,
bartenders, or others may be held legally liable
for the consequences of serving alcohol to
underaged drinkers or to obviously intoxicated
persons.
Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the
enforcement of state and local laws. Students
and others on campus who violate the law
may be and have been arrested and
prosecuted, primary responsibility for law
enforcement, including that related to alcohol,
rests with law enforcement agencies, primarily
the Stanford Police Department. Uniformed
officers who patrol the campus and respond to
calls are deputized by the sheriff of Santa Clara
County and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and
enforce all laws. Laws are subject to change;
consequently, the following information is
illustrative but must not be relied upon as a
complete and current citing of relevant laws.

Department of Public Safety, 711 Serra Street.

Some Applications
■ No University funds or funds collected by
the University may be used in a way which
violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who
are 21 or oldec and residence staff members
often are in the 21 or older age range, the
fact remains that the great majority of
residents of an all-frosh dormitory are minors.
Consequently, it is hard to imagine how
house dues for all-frosh residences could be
used to buy alcohol without violating both
state law and University policy.
■ Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless
of how money is collected, all provisions of
the policy apply to all students, faculty, and
staff.
■ Event planners will be held individually and
collectively responsible for planning and
carrying out events in compliance with the
policy. One or more house/organization
officers must assume responsibility for the
events compliance with the alcohol policy.
These officers' names must be made available
to the police and to the University upon
request.
Consequences of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will
be the preferred response to infractions
unaccompanied by more egregious conduct.
However, behavior could run the gamut from
a simple Minor in Possession (of alcohol) with
no prior disciplinary history to drunken
behavior resulting in loss of life. Penalties will
be calibrated according to the severity of the
misconduct. Behavior associated with drug or
alcohol use and abuse may constitute one or
more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence
agreement or Terms and Conditions of
Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting the student
to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions
of recognition, subjecting the student to

expulsion from the organization and/or the
organizations loss of University recognition
and associated privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard,
subjecting the student to University discipline
which includes as a possible outcome
suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but
rather is an aggravating circumstance. A
student's careless or willful reduction, through
the use of alcohol or other intoxicants, of his
or her own ability to think clearly, exercise
good judgment, and respond to rational
intervention is considered grounds for more
stringent penalties than might be levied
otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to
have violated the policy are subject, as groups,
to University sanctions such as suspension of
social privileges and loss of University
recognition, meeting space, and housing, if
applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is
complex, it is important to know that under
some circumstances party hosts, sponsors,
bartenders, or others may be held legally liable
for the consequences of serving alcohol to
underaged drinkers or to obviously intoxicated
persons.
Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the
enforcement of state and local laws. Students
and others on campus who violate the law
may be and have been arrested and
prosecuted, primary responsibility for law
enforcement, including that related to alcohol,
rests with law enforcement agencies, primarily
the Stanford Police Department. Uniformed
officers who patrol the campus and respond to
calls are deputized by the sheriff of Santa Clara
County and are fully empowered and
authorized to stop vehicles, make arrests, and
enforce all laws. Laws are subject to change;
consequently, the following information is
illustrative but must not be relied upon as a
complete and current citing of relevant laws.

THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD
UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident
Fellows ("residence staff") at Stanford is
principally educational, advisory, and
developmental. It is crucial that students trust
their residence staff members and feel
comfortable confiding in them, turning to
them freely for assistance whenever they
need it. As role models and as employees and
agents of the University, residence staff

members are expected to work with students in
the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help
ensure that students are made aware of
University policy, pertinent California law, and
the health risks associated with the use and
abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible
party planning and management and help
students in their efforts to abide by the event
planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should
work closely with residents to create and
maintain a safe and healthful residential
environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not
expected to police or monitor the conduct of
students, or to receive or act upon reports of
violations. They are expected to exercise the
same judgment concerning this policy as they
do with other University policies. For example,
they must continue to intervene and exercise
responsible guidance any time they are aware
of any situation that is threatening to the health
or safety of individuals or groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND
ALCOHOL POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist
students in planning and managing events in
ways that are in compliance with the
Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy. The
guidelines apply to all students planning events
on the Stanford campus or any off-campus
University program or activity. The list below,
drawn up for events at which alcohol will be
served, is not exhaustive. Individuals and
groups are responsible for developing strategies
for planning and carrying out events that are
safe and in compliance with University policy.
■If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it
an adjunct to the event, not the center of it.
■Ensure that non-alcoholic drinks (EANABS) are
at least as accessible and attractive as, and
more plentiful than, alcoholic drinks. The
amount of alcohol provided should be
reasonable and in proportion to the number of
event participants who are legally able to drink.
■Create an atmosphere in which people are
encouraged to interact, and are helped to feel
comfortable — have something for people to
do besides just stand around and drink.

■ Encourage moderation by using moderate
sized glasses and cups.
■Have the alcohol in a secure part of the
room where access can be readily controlled.
Ensure that it is attended at all times, and
have it served rather than leaving it open to
self-service. Make sure that servers have been
trained in responsible alcohol serving.
■ Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before
the end of the event, and make sure you
have plenly of other beverages and snacks
left to serve at this time.
■ Refuse to serve someone who has had too
much to drink.
■ Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
■ If the event is advertised, do not mention
alcohol in the publicity.
■ If the event is open to people who are not
known to the residence or the organization,
take extra precautions to guard against
problems such as theft, assault, drunken
driving, individuals wandering off in need of
assistance, and possible injuries. While any of
these concerns can arise among people who
know each other, experience shows that they
are more common when gatherings are large
■ High school students should be afforded
vigorous protection from access to alcohol, if
they are allowed to attend the event at all. It
is generally wiser to restrict attendance to
college-aged people or older.
■ Designate plenty of sober monitors to help
manage the party. Station them at the front
door and in the area where alcohol is being
served, and have some circulate inside and
outside the house to check other possible
means of entry, attend to house security
respond to problems, and so forth.
■ Emphasize to the group sponsoring the
event (e.g., a residence, a fraternal group, a
student voluntary organization), that it is each
member's responsibility to ensure that the
event is managed well and to exercise care
for the well-being of all participants.
■ Exercise care and authority in hiring the
band. Do not permit members to bring
minors ("friends of the band") to the event.
■ Control the noise of the event. The farther
away it can be heard, the more likely you'll
draw complaints and unwanted guests.
Student conduct is guided by the
Fundamental Standard, which states the
expectation that students will act in ways that
demonstrate respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others.
Implicit in the Standard is the understanding
that students are responsible for making their
own decisions and accepting the
consequences of those decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about
alcohol use, students and others should be
aware of the health and safety risks associated
with its use, as well as the state and local laws
about possessing, serving and consuming
alcohol. It is widely recognized that the misuse
and abuse of drugs ("controlled substances")*
and the abuse of alcohol are major
contributors to serious health problems as well
as to social and civic concerns. The health risks
associated with the use of illicit drugs and the
abuse of alcohol include various deleterious
physical and mental consequences including
addiction, severe disability, and death.
Information concerning the known effects of
alcohol and specific drugs is available from the
Alcohol and Drug Information Center at the
Cowell Student Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and
alcohol abuse and the human and material
costs associated with it. The University, as an
educational institution, approaches student
conduct issues from a perspective that places
greater emphasis on individual responsibility
and development than on regulatory
measures. Consequently, education about and
prevention of alcohol-related problems will
continue to be our primary emphasis.
Moreover, it is the intention of the University
that students as individuals and as members
of groups will conduct themselves in
accordance with this and all other University
policies governing student conduct.
*Controlled substances are those defined in
21 U.S.C. 812 and include, but are not limited
to, such substances as marijuana, heroin,
cocaine and amphetamines.
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to
maintain a drug-free workplace and campus.
The unlawful manufacture, distribution,
dispensation, possession, and/or use of
controlled substances or the unlawful
possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is
prohibited on the Stanford campus, in the
workplace, or as part of any of the University's
activities. The workplace and campus are
presumed to include all Stanford premises
where the activities of the University are
conducted. Violation of this policy may result
in disciplinary sanctions up to and including
termination of employment or expulsion of
students. Violations may also be referred to
the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
This policy will be reviewed at least biennially.
Some Applications

the University may be used in a way which
