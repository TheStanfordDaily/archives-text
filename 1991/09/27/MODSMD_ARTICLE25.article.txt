## 'Big Bob' breaks the tension and opponents' backs 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
There is a lot of pressure behind the title
"one of the finest offensive linemen in all of
college football."
Cardinal junior offensive tackle Bob Whit
field has many expectations to live up to.
However, he is more concerned about dealing
with the physical pressure on the field than
the mental pressure from the media.
"There was pressure on me from the get-go
when I came here as a freshman," Whitfield
said. "I'm used to pressure by now."
Ranked as the No. 1 high school lineman by
the Houston-based Max Emfinger's Report,
Whitfield was considered the nation's top
recruit coming into Stanford. During his first
season in cardinal and white, Whitfield start
ed all 11 games at left tackle and played every
down. He was the only sophomore out of 14
finalists for the 1990 Outland Trophy. This
season he is listed as a First-Team All-Ameri
can in every preseason college football publi
cation, and he has already been selected as
one of the 12 finalists for the 1991 Lombardi
Award, presented annually to the nation's top
lineman.
"Whitfield is ready to establish himself as
the No. 1 offensive left tackle in the country,"
head coach Denny Green said. "He has been a
dominant player and a key performer for the
past two seasons .. Now is the time for Bob
to meet the ultimate expectations and respon
sibilities." What does all this hype mean to
Whitfield?
"One thing about Bob, he takes all that in
stride," said fellow offensive lineman Brian
Cassidy. "He doesn't blow it out of proportion
and take it too seriously. He's just one of the
guys on the line doing his job."
With Stanford's 1991 record standing at 0-
2 going into tomorrow's game against the

defending co-national and Big Eight champi
on Colorado, both Whitfield and Green expect
to see some improvement in the offensive line.
"I think Bob expects to play a lot better in
the next nine games," Green said.
"I know I can play better," Whitfield said.
"I think overall I've been playing average ...
and I think I should be playing better just to
help the team play better."
Offensive line coach Scott Schuhmann
feels that Whitfield is doing well this year,
both on pass protection and run blocking;
however Schuhmann thinks Whitfield needs
to be more consistent.
"Individually he's done well," Schuhmann
said. "Collectively the line can do better."
The Cardinal offensive line, which aver
ages 6 feet 7 inches and 300 pounds, is
believed to be the biggest in college football,
and the Indianapolis Colts are the only NFL
team with an offensive line larger than Stan
ford's. Whitfield, a mighty 6-7 and 300
pounds himself, doesn't feel that the size of
the line is very important.
"I don't think the size is the key to being
the best line because you can be the biggest
and the worst," Whitfield said. "We've got the
size but we have to mature as players and
come together. We don't need that 'biggest'
category, we need the 'best' category."
Colorado coach Bill McCartney feels that
the size of Stanford's offensive line is not its
only attribute.
"I'm impressed with all of them," McCart
ney said. "As big as they are, they're very
mobile. Whitfield has untapped potential. He
has the size and maneuverability that few
guys in the NFL have. He has the overall raw
potential and everything you look for in a col
lege offensive tackle."
While praise of his size and speed continu
ally rain upon him, Whitfield is better known
by his teammates as the team joker.

"Bob likes to have a good time," Cassidy
said. "He knows how to have fun when it's
time to have fun, and how to be serious when
it's time to be serious."
"I don't run around with a clown suit on,"
Whitfield said. "But I'm a mellow person. I
keep the tension loose. It's easy to get uptight
before a game."
In a pre-Washington game 'joke' to a jour
nalist of the San Jose Mercury News, Whit
field claimed that Stanford would beat Wash
ington by 60 points. This, however, was not
taken by many to be a joke. Following Stan
ford's 42-7 loss to the Huskies, Whitfield's
comment was splashed all over newspapers
nationwide.
"It was a joke but it was for real," Whitfield
said. "If you ask me what we're going to do
against a team, I think we're gonna beat
them. If it's by 60 or by one, it's still a 'W'. It
means I'm very fired up to play hard ... If we
had won it, they probably would have got me
for not winning by 60."

First-Team-All-American Bob Whitfield has developed into one of the
top offensive linemen in the nation much sooner than coaches anticipated.
The 6-foot -7-inch 300- pound junior was the country's (and
the Cardinal's) top recruit two years ago.
