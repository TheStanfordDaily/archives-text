# Football vs. Colorado
## 
### 
SATURDAY — TV: ABC split-national telecast,
Radio: KZSU (90.1 FM) with Pat Broun. 12;30
kickoff at Stanford Stadium.
RECORDS — Stanford (0-2, 0-2 overall), Col
orado (2-1 overall).
NOTES — This could be pretty ugly. The Cardi
nal has not beaten the Buffaloes since 1904.
Yes, 1904. The defending co-national champi
ons and Big 8 champions are lead by the out
standing Darian Hagan. Luckily, almost all of
the Stanford players are back in commission
after a rough Arizona game two weeks ago.
Only Ron George and Estevan Avila remain
sidelined.
