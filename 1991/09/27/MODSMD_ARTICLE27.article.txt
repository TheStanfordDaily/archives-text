# Stanford 'polo faces tough teams
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Although it is only the first weekend
of the school year, for the Stanford
water polo team it is one of the most
important ones of the whole year.
After playing No. 4-ranked UC-
Irvine today at 3 p.m. at deGuerre Pool
and Santa Clara at 4:30, the No. 5 Car
dinal will travel to Berkeley for the
annual Northern California Tourna
ment. There they will play No. 6 Pep
perdine, No. 7 USC, No. 9 Pacific and
No. 10 Fresno State.
"This tournament and Friday's
game will be the most important of the
year. Five teams from California make
the NCAA Championships and, right
now, we're the fifth team, and we'll be
playing the team right ahead of us and

those right behind us. To put it simply,
this weekend will establish our national
ranking, and if we fall down, it will be
really tough to get back up," said Coach
Dante Dettamanti.
Such a predicament has rarely been
seen by a Dettamanti-coached team, as
in his 14 years at Stanford, only the
1983 team has failed to qualify for the
national championship tournament.
But after graduating its top four scorers

from last year's team — which lost in
the NCAA finals — the-Cardinal has
struggled in the early-going and cur
rently has a 4-2 record.
Those four players who graduated
accounted for an amazing total of 193
goals, so it is not too surprising that the
team's main problem thus far has been
scoring.
"We're holding the other
teams down and playing pretty
good defense, but to win you have
to score, and we're not doing that
too well right now," Dettamanti
said.
Despite the disappointing
aspects Dettamanti has seen so
far, he still has much reason for
optimism. "We definitely have the
potential for the future, but I just
don't know whether the future
means this year or we'll have to
wait until next year," he said.
With such a big challenge
ahead of the Cardinal this week
end, many of Dettamanti's ques
tions will likely be answered, as
the team will be forced to perform
at a level not yet seen this year.

Come this weekend, however,
the Cardinal will be completely
serious and focused on the task at
hand — returning to the hunt for
the national championship. The
first challenge will be the very
aggressive and talented team
from UC-Irvine, who will be the
opponent in today's home opener.
The Anteaters possess two
players, Skyler Putnam and Steve
Gill, who were on the United
States World University Games
Team. Irvine also has Mexican
National Team member Pablo
Yrizar and several other seniors
and juniors, so the game should
answer a lot of questions about
the Cardinal and how the rest of
the year will go.
"If we could beat Irvine, that
would really give us a push and
add some confidence to the team
for the other games this week
end," Quittner said.
