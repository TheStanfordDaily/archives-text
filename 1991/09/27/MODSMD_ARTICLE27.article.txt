# Stanford 'polo faces tough teams
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Although it is only the first weekend
of the school year, for the Stanford
water polo team it is one of the most
important ones of the whole year.
After playing No. 4-ranked UC-
Irvine today at 3 p.m. at deGuerre Pool
and Santa Clara at 4:30, the No. 5 Car
dinal will travel to Berkeley for the
annual Northern California Tourna
ment. There they will play No. 6 Pep
perdine, No. 7 USC, No. 9 Pacific and
No. 10 Fresno State.
"This tournament and Friday's
game will be the most important of the
year. Five teams from California make
the NCAA Championships and, right
now, we're the fifth team, and we'll be
playing the team right ahead of us and

those right behind us. To put it simply,
this weekend will establish our national
ranking, and if we fall down, it will be
really tough to get back up," said Coach
Dante Dettamanti.
Such a predicament has rarely been
seen by a Dettamanti-coached team, as
in his 14 years at Stanford, only the
1983 team has failed to qualify for the
national championship tournament.
But after graduating its top four scorers

from last year's team — which lost in
the NCAA finals — the-Cardinal has
struggled in the early-going and cur
rently has a 4-2 record.
Those four players who graduated
accounted for an amazing total of 193
goals, so it is not too surprising that the
team's main problem thus far has been
scoring.
