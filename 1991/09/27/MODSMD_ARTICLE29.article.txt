# Mystery team takes on Card
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
When the Stanford women's booters square
off against the University of Puget Sound this
weekend, they will not know what they're get
ting into.
Very little is known about the upcoming
Cardinal foe. When the two teams last met
three years ago, they played a very closely-con
tested game won by Stanford. Other than that,
the Cardinal players and head coach Berhane
Andeberhan have very little to go on.
"We know that they gave Portland and
Washington some tough games earlier this
year," Andeberhan said, "and we know that
they have historically been a well-organized,
feisty team. I've been trying to find out more
about them, but other than that I haven't come
up with much."
The mystery surrounding the Puget Sound
team does not worry Andeberhan, however.
"My attitude is that, at the college level, you
should do your best to get your house in order,
to play your own game," Andeberhan said. "I
don't rely on scouting because it makes the risk
of disrupting the team much greater."
Andeberhan went on to describe how he
goes about altering his team's game to match
up against its opponent.
"We do make adjustments as necessary," he
said. "If a team seems afraid to bring the ball
down the field, we will play very tight defense
from the moment the ball is in play. With an
aggressive team, we will keep our defenders
back and give the other team a third to a half of
the field."
The 1991 Cardinal squad, which has
outscored its opponents 30-2 over its first six
games and has trailed in a game for only three
minutes all season, is certainly much stronger
than even last year's powerhouse team.
"We have proven over the first few games of
the season that we are a legitimate top 10
team," Andeberhan said. "And anyone in the
top 10 is capable of winning the champi
onship. "
