# Reported rape stuns Stern Hall residents
## Assault program steers from incident 
### Miranda Doyle Andy Dworkin 
Aftershocks from a report that
a rape allegedly occurred in Casa
Zapata Sunday night have shaken
Stern Hall residents, according to
those who attended a presenta
tion on alcohol and sexual assault
there last night.
"[The alleged rape] was right
next door," said Millie Chu, a
freshman in Donner. "It hit very
close to home."
The reported incident, howev
er, was not a focus of "About Last
Night," an Orientation program
held yesterday evening in five res
idences, including Stern. The pre
sentation, also given in dormito
ries Wednesday night, combines
the efforts of sexual assault peer
educators and the Freshman

Alcohol Responsibility and Man
agement Program, which is spon
sored by the Intersorority and
Interfraternity Councils.
Police are investigating a
woman's report that she was
raped in a Zapata dorm room
after a party Sunday night. Zapa
ta Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga
said Wednesday that alcohol
played a role in the incident.
Serra resident assistant Chris
Seeley, a senior, said the alleged
rape was not discussed much at
the presentation last night. "It
was mentioned in passing," he
said. "There hasn't been much
backlash yet because most people
found out today.
"I felt it was good that we had
this program the night after most
people found out about the
(alleged) assault," he added.
Donner RA Dana Tilson, a
senior, said she has talked with
several students in her dorm
about the investigation. "They
were shocked like most people
are," she said.

Jason West, a freshman in
Larkin, said he was surprised the
incident was largely ignored dur
ing the discussion. But facilita
tors said they wanted to concen
trate on alcohol and sexual
assault in general.
Copies of a Daily article on the
investigation of the reported rape
have been posted on bathroom
doors in Donner, but freshman
Girish Khera said he did not think
a dormitory meeting on the inci

dent would be appropriate.
"Individuals have the right to
talk to an RA about it, but if a
group discussion is started it
becomes more sensational," he
said.
But Donner freshman Jake
Moffat said the alleged assault
has already become a topic for dis
cussion in Stern. "Everybody
knows (about it) but no one's will
ing to say too much. They want
more facts."
