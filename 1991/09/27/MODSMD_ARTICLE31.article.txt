# Young team aims high

The Stanford women's cross country
team will travel to Woodward Park,
Calif., this Saturday to compete in the
Fresno Pacific Invitational without their
No. 1 runner, junior Ashley Black.
Black is not expected to compete in
the season-opening meet because of a sci
atic nerve problem, according to coach
Brooks Johnson. Black, who is expected
to lead the 1991 Stanford team, finished
33rd in the NCAA District-8's last year
while the Cardinal finished eighth.
Johnson will be looking to sophomore
Sarah Truitt and freshman phenom
Jeannie Rothman to pick up the slack in
Black's absence. Rothman, who finished
second at the 1990 Kinney Cross Coun

try Invitational, was a highly sought
after recruit from Westlake Village,
Calif.
"It's our first race, and we're very
young, but I suspect that we will be very
competitive," Johnson said.
Stanford has added nine freshmen to
the 1991 squad, adding depth to a young
team with no seniors and just three
juniors.
