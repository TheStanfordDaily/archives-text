# Volleying 'til they drop: Women travel north today
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team will soon get a well
deserved, restful break from their
intense schedule. But not yet.
Instead of being able to rest up
and finish picking classes this
weekend, the Cardinal will be
heading up north for two more
tough Pac-10 road games—Wash
ington State University on Friday
and the University of Washington
on Saturday. As usual in the
strong Pac-10 conference, neither
team will be a walkover for the
No. 1-ranked Stanford team.
"They're both looking real
good at this point. Both have a lot
more size this year and have real
ly improved," Stanford women's
coach Don Shaw said.
Friday's opponent, the Wash
ington State Cougars, have com
piled an impressive 12-3 record
overall. They defeated Washing
ton in their only Pac-10 match so
far this season, and they are list
ed 21st in the Tachikara Volley
ball poll for this week. The Lady
Cougars are first in the confer
ence in team hitting percentage
at .329 (Stanford is second at
.279) and is always tough to play
at home.
Even though the Huskies lost
to Washington State last week,
they are still ranked one place
higher (20th) in this week's
Tachikara poll. Washington has
become something of a giant
killer in its non-conference play
so far, defeating No. 22 Colorado
and No. 16 Pepperdine in Seattle
two weeks ago and then pulling
out a fifth-game, 18-16 victory
over No. 11 New Mexico last
week.
Although Stanford has domi
nated both of these teams in
recent years (10-0 against Wash
ington State, 11-2 against Wash
ington overall), the Cardinal does
not want to take either team
lightly. After playing a scrappy
California team on Wednesday
night, the Stanford players were
only able to get in one practice
before they left early this morn

ing for Spokane, and Shaw is hop
ing the team won't get too worn
down.
"We were supposed to have the
Cal match on Tuesday and be
able to get in some good practice
time before this trip, but since it
was rescheduled we have had to
make do. This is going to be a
tough stretch of the season,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal is continuing to
put up impressive numbers as it
rolls over its opponents. Senior
Kristin Klein's season-high 26
kills last Wednesday against Cali
fornia gave her 1519 for her
career, second only to Kim
Oden's 1751 (1982-1985). In
addition, Klein notched another
double-double for the season by
adding 22 digs against the Golden
Bears. Junior Bev Oden tied her
season-high of 19 digs that night
also while adding 15 kills.
Another key to Stanford's suc
cess is the sparkling play of out
side hitter Jennifer Jackson.
After hitting .086 last year over
all, Jackson has come alive this
year, hitting .314 so far this sea
son and adding another potent
weapon to the Cardinal offense.
Against the Arizona teams
Jackson played particularly well,
hitting .421 against Arizona and
an amazing .524 against Arizona
State. She is also third on the
team in digs behind Klein and
Oden.

Bev Oden had 15 show-stopping kills, like this one, Wednesday night against Cali
fornia. The senior Ail-American also tied her season high of 19 digs. Tonight the team
travels to the plains of Pullman, Wa. to take on the Cougars at Friel Court.
With such an impressive array
of offensive weapons, Stanford
can overwhelm its opponents.
"One of the problems of play
ing against us is that teams have
to play at such a high level
against us for the whole match.
Cal played tough for three-and
a-half games, but they couldn't
keep up with us," Shaw said.
The Cardinal squad will be
returning next week to host
their own Stanford Invitational
next Thursday and Friday, but
they won't look past their Pac
10 opponents this weekend.
