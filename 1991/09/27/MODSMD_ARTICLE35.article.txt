# Soccer shoots to become an 'elite'
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team has a winning record.
They've already tied two of the
top fifteen teams in the country.
And they're far from satisfied
with their performance to date.
"Happy? Hell no, we're not
happy," said second year coach
Colin Lindores. "We've got a real
competitive team right now, but
we're not yet the elite team that
we want to be."
Stanford currently sports a
modest 3-2-2 record and a No. 10
ranking in the latest Division I
western poll.
It doesn't get any easier for
the Cardinal this weekend, as
they travel to Moraga to face St.
Mary's, a traditional soccer rival.
The Gaels come into Sunday's
game with a solid 4-2-0 record
and a No. 8 ranking in Division I
West. More impressively, St.
Mary's is riding high off of their
last win, a 2-0 shutout over
nationally-ranked Seton Hall on
the road. Gaels coach Bob Martin

admits that this most recent vic
tory should give his team "an
incredible shot of momentum"
heading into Sunday.
By all accounts, the Stanford-
St. Mary's game promises to be a
dogfight. Last year's game ended
in a 2-2 deadlock, and both teams
are fielding improved squads.
Lindores characterized the
match as "a real tough game, and
that's not the usual BS."
Martin said much of the same.
"We have always had close games
with Stanford," said the St.
Mary's coach. "Although we've
had some degree of success
[against Stanford] in the past,
they have been a much better
team with Colin [Lindores] as
coach."
