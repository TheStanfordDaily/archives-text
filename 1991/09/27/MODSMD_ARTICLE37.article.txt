# Kennedy makes 11th and final Greek guesses as prez

### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Ah the Greeks. They usually
bring to mind topics like architec
ture, philosophy and a specific
type of taboo sex.
But in these hastily written
pages — which the intellectual
community hastily reads in order
to get to White Plaza Watch —
Greek means something entirely
different.
The reappropriation of the
term "Greek" to refer to dumb,
beer-gutted men who make pre
dictions about sports they're not
in good enough shape to play,
stems from the nom de plume of
contemporary hero Jimmy the
Greek.
Although this week's colum
nists claim to be more politically
correct than their mentor, they
are proud of their ability to appre
ciate the work if not the man. As
society struggles with parallel
conundrums in Heidegger, Pound
and Sinatra, the writers of these
pages struggle with the specter of
Jimmy Snyder. Oh the humanity.
This week, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has joined
the intellectual forces of these
pages to jointly predict the victory

of Stanford over heavily favored
Colorado. Gosh, as long as we're
keeping our journalistic impartial
ity in tact, why don't we just that
Stanford is going to be number
one in this year's U.S. News and
World Report.
But these are the sports pages.
You want quick answers. For
those of you too lazy to look
through the whole flow chart, I'll
highlight it for you so that you can
return to your industrial engi
neering homework.
Kevin "I want you to know I've
taken pre-calculus" Jeffrey has
utilized the infinity symbol this
week as both a proof of his wit and
mastery of the Macintosh smart
keys.
Tyson "I still can't find my
razor" Vaughn tries to employ
humor through his wacky use of
large numbers and his blatant,
zany prediction of a safety. It's
guys like him who would send us
to war in the Middle East again.
Amy "chicks can do this too"
Wusterbarth's all too-'80's need
to prove herself capable of enter
ing the sweaty world of manhood
is underlying each and every one
of her picks, particularly her unre
alistic and overly patriotic pick in
the Army game. Buy a dress, Amy.
