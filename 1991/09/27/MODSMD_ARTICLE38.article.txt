# Vonnegut garners cherished chapeau
## Yeltsin could be next recipient 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Kurt Vonnegut was the
first American to receive the
prestigious "Blue Bomber Hat
of Freedom" Tuesday at Print
er's Ink Bookstore in Palo
Alto.
The first of its kind, the hat
was designed by six Stanford
juniors in order to show their
appreciation for the author's
contributions to freedom in
society.
Upon receiving the award,
Vonnegut finished signing a
copy of his new autobiography,
"Fates Worse Than Death,"
and said, "I'm speechless."
The hat consisted of a loaf
of Safeway bread shaped as an
insect and carefully affixed to
two pie pans glued together. A
placard reading "Blue Bomber
Hat of Freedom" ran across
the top of the chapeau, and the
chin strap was constructed
from an intricate drawing of a
frog.
After receiving the award,
Vonnegut immediately return

ed to his hourlong practice of
silently signing his name on
each book.
But although the accep
tance ceremony was brief, the
students were not disappoint
ed.
"We loved it — Kurt Von
negut was speechless," said
Ivan Garcia, one of students
who designed the hat. The
other students include Ken
Norman, Mike Drake, John
Borland, Geoff Goldman and
Dave Caro.
The juniors intend to send
the hat to other world leaders
whom they feel have con
tributed to the overall freedom
of society.
"It's a hat of freedom," Gar
cia said. "It's a really nice hat
you have to wear. It's the Blue
Bomber Hat of Freedom."
The students have targeted
Boris Yeltsin for considera
tion as the second recipient of
the award.
"We want to make sure
he's going the right way," said
Drake. "We don't go around
giving these things out as if
they were bread hats."

"I'm speechless," says author Kurt Vonnegut after receiving a
"Blue Bomber Hat of Freedom," crafted from bread and pie
pans. Vonnegut, who has won several awards for his books,
has clearly never won this sort of prize.
