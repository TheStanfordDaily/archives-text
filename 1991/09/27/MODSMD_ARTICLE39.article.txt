# I'm insane!
## No sane person would write a column for The Stanford Daily 
### 
Being asked to be a columnist for The
Daily is sort of like being asked, "So, do you
want to be vice-president?"
Oh sure, maybe some of the more
gullible frosh are thinking to themselves
right now, "What's this loser complaining

about? I'd love to
write for The Daily."
How little you know.
Daily columnists
are the Edsels of the
journalism world. For
every Joel Stein that
sticks around, there
are five or six — well, I
don't want to subject
those poor souls to
even further humilia
tion. Let's just say

that even Aurora doesn't accept their work
any more.
It's not as if they were that bad — they
just had the misfortune td write for the
students of Stanford University, always on
the lookout for an opportunity to use The
Daily in the dorm version of Dennis
Miller's "Weekend Update."
College students everywhere are overly
cynical, but I think we're the only universi
ty in the country where Dan Quayle is
more popular than the cheerleaders.
If a columnist makes a single mistake,
he'll be ridiculed at every dorm meeting on
campus, and pretty soon the Chaparral and
Intermission line up to take turns satiriz
ing him.
Heck, I might have already blown my
mistake quota for the year with my terribly

un-PC use of "he." I think I hear the CIV
Lecturers' Union knocking on my door
already.
Even if I somehow manage to escape the
attention of my fellow columnists and The
Stanford Review, I still have to deal with

my friends, family
and dormmates. Alas,
how can I delve into
the favorite topic of
all true Stanford stu
dents — sex — with
out alerting my moth
er to the fact that I've
gone through puber
ty?
If I tell any sto
ries "from personal
experience," everyone

I know plus those weenies who beaned me
with a paper wad at "The Graduate" will
assume I'm writing about them! I can pic
ture it now: I'll be at dinner, and the hash
er will squint at me and say, "You're that
columnist, aren't you? I saved some walnut
loaf for you. Enjoy your meal. Ha ha ha
ha!"
So why am I writing this column? Roy
alties if a band bearing my name hits it big?
A desire to be less popular than the ASSU
Senate? Sheer stupidity? The answer is
simple. I'm an extrovert and an attention
hogger. I couldn't cut it in acting, and no a
cappella group (no matter how small and
pitiful) would have me.
A Daily column is my last chance to say
to Stanford: "Look at me! Look at me! I'm
making a fool of myself for your benefit!"
