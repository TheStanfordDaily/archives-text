## Who the Bugger is Student #1234567? 
### Andrew Berkowitz 
Though Lake Lag may have evaporat
ed into thin air, things around here have
changed less than one would think. Here
is a letter from January 1988 that raises
an issue still relevant on campus today.
Andrew Berkowitz, recently inducted
into the "Bug Me" Hall of Fame, wrote
the response.

Dear Bug Me:
Quite frankly, we're concerned. It's about
student No. 1234567, the one on the back of the
Time Schedule. That this person takes classes
at 8 a.m. is enough to warrant serious investi
gation ... but what really has us losing sleep
is the content of this schedule.
Is "Ottoman Empire" taught at Stanford?
Do any of these classes satisfy distribution
requirements? Can we take "Sailing" winter
quarter too ? Just what is "Collective Social
Behavior," and how can we join? But most of
all, how long has student No. 1234567 been
taking the same classes, and is Dean Fetter
aware of his/her less-than-successful academ
ic progress?

Dear S&C
I don't know if this thought has occurred to
you at all, but if you'd stop and think for like
one second you'd realize Dean Fetter is dean
of Admissions and doesn't give a damn what
anyone does after they get in here. Thank you.
I just wanted to set you straight.
Prior to winter quarter in 1975 there
wasn't a sample study list on the back of the
Time Schedule, and students had to cope for

themselves with the incredibly difficult task of fig
uring out how properly to fill out a study list. Pre
sumably students got stupider in the winter of
'75, because it was in that quarter the first sam
ple study list was offered.
Student No. 1234567 has indeed been tak
ing the same classes for the last 14 years,
although several things have changed. "Writ
ing Workshop," which is now offered Thurs
days from 10 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., was original
ly scheduled from 11 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. Fur
thermore, "Ottoman Empire" used to be five
days a week at 8 a.m., instead of its current
Monday, Wednesday, Friday slot.
The adviser used to be T.R. Smith, but he
was replaced by Adviser's Signature (Mr. Sig
nature obviously being of Armenian descent),
and John Doe has been replaced by Student's
Signature (probably a distant cousin of the

adviser).
All of the original professors of the classes
have died and been replaced by new ones.
Originally, the classes were taught by Staff,
Vucinich, Rosenblum and Steenbackers,
respectively. Then, for about two years, the
sample study list was very blurry and unread
able (like a real study list), and suddenly two
years later, Steenbackers had changed his
name to Steenbaueus.
Those teachers have all passed on to the
great office hours in the sky, and the current
teachers are Staff, Smith, Jones and
Stephens, respectively. Coincidentally,
Stephens, teaching Sailing every quarter, is
the name of the guy who puts together the
Time Schedule. Hmmmmm?
English 1A: Writing Workshop: Inten
sive course emphasizing the published best
seller as a writing goal. Students will be
required to write and publish a novel which, to
receive credit, must remain on the New York
Times Bestseller List for 16 weeks. (6 units,
DR: 2)
History 186: Ottoman Empire: Class
deals with the impact of several different great
furniture societies on modern home decorat
ing. Contrasted with the Ottoman Empire will
be the Couch Dynasty, the Dinette Kingdom
and the Easy Chair Oligarchy. (5 units, DR: 3)

social groups interact. Specific case studies
will include nuns visiting Hell's Angels motor
cycle bars, professional wrestlers at a senior
citizens' luncheon and elementary school chil
dren visiting death row inmates. (5 units).
