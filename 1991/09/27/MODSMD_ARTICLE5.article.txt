# Stanford wins ruling on academic freedom
## Decision upholds University research policy 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Staff writers 
Stanford won a landmark court ruling
yesterday barring the government from
censoring the publication of results from
federally sponsored research.
The University filed suit in federal
court last October after the Department of
Health and Human Services withdrew a
contract because Stanford would not agree,
to a so-called "confidentiality clause."
The clause required Stanford re
searchers to submit any research results
for review by the agency. The research
manuscripts could not be published if the
government objected.
As part of yesterday's decision, Stan

ford was awarded the $1.5 million research
contract from the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute without the objection
able clause.
"This is an extremely important deci
sion," said Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest, who handled the case for the Uni
versity. "It is valuable for research at uni
versities throughout the United States.
"If you adhere to the values underlying
the First Amendment, this decision pro
motes those freedoms. It protects against
the problems of censorship," Brest added.
University President Donald Kennedy
called the decision "a victory for academic
freedom" in a speech to the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
