# Stanford wins ruling on academic freedom
## Decision upholds University research policy 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Staff writers 
Stanford won a landmark court ruling
yesterday barring the government from
censoring the publication of results from
federally sponsored research.
The University filed suit in federal
court last October after the Department of
Health and Human Services withdrew a
contract because Stanford would not agree,
to a so-called "confidentiality clause."
The clause required Stanford re
searchers to submit any research results
for review by the agency. The research
manuscripts could not be published if the
government objected.
As part of yesterday's decision, Stan

ford was awarded the $1.5 million research
contract from the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute without the objection
able clause.
"This is an extremely important deci
sion," said Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest, who handled the case for the Uni
versity. "It is valuable for research at uni
versities throughout the United States.
"If you adhere to the values underlying
the First Amendment, this decision pro
motes those freedoms. It protects against
the problems of censorship," Brest added.
University President Donald Kennedy
called the decision "a victory for academic
freedom" in a speech to the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
Stanford refused to accept the
confidentiality clause because it
violated the University's Policy
Guidelines on Secrecy in Research,
which state that researchers will
not enter into any contract that
requires agency approval before
results can be published.
Stanford's policy defends "the
principle of freedom of access by
all interested persons to the
underlying data, to the processes
and to the final results of
research."

Brest said requiring govern
ment approval of research papers
would have raised two significant
concerns:
• Researchers would feel a "chill
from someone who has the ability
to suppress" their papers; and
• People reading research
reports would "not know if the
report has been shaped by some
one's agenda." Reports could be
in a "cloud of uncertainty."
Harvard University filed a
legal brief further explaining
these arguments in support of
Stanford's position, Brest said.
"This decision is of absolute
benefit to the whole scientific
field," Brest said. "It is also

important because this has been a
confused area of law."
Brest said she believes that
the judge's decision in the U.S.
District Court in Washington,
D.C., is "of sufficient generali
ty" to prevent the government
from trying to include confiden
tiality clauses in future con
tracts.
There have only been a few
cases in the past where the gov
ernment has tried to include the
clause, and the University has
negotiated it out of the contract,
Brest said.
Brest said she did not know
whether the government would
appeal the decision.
