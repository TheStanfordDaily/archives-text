### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
A student will "probably" be arrested
today for Sunday's alleged rape in Casa Zap
ata, Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said.
The police finished a preliminary investi
gation of the incident and filed a report with
the Santa Clara County district attorney yes
terday, Herrington said.
He added that the district attorney must
review the case before an arrest warrant can
be issued. The district attorney had not fin
ished reviewing the case yesterday.
The alleged assault occurred in a student
room in Zapata Sunday night. Herrington
said the police received a call from the woman
shortly before noon Monday, and they have
been investigating the case since then.
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga said
the incident involved an individual male Zapa
ta resident. There are 98 residents in Zapata
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said her
investigation of the case is continuing, but

she could not discuss details because "an
accused student has the right to a confiden
tial process."
In a judicial affairs investigation, Cole
said she first must determine whether there
is any basis for believing that a student has
violated one of Stanford's codes of conduct.
If Cole decides that there is a basis, she
begins a formal proceeding against the stu
dent. If the student is found guilty of a con
duct violation after a judicial hearing, the
student faces possible suspension or expul
sion from the University.
Cole said she did not know what the
penalty would be for a sexual assault because
no investigation of sexual assault has ever
led to formal charges.
She said the punishment "depends on the
seriousness of the events, and includes any
extenuating or aggravating circumstances."
Cole said that if alcohol were involved in
the alleged rape it would be considered an
aggravating circumstance.
According to Burciaga, alcohol played a
role in the incident.
