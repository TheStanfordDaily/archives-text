# Tough decisions pave admissions path
## 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
The college admissions pro
cess can be one of the most
mysterious and frustrating
parts of a high school senior's
life.
But for the deems in Stan
ford's Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, selecting the next
class of new students is an
exhilarating — and exhausting
— task.
The main criterion in the
admissions deans' decisions is
academic achievement, said
John Bunnell, associate dean
and director of freshman admis
sions. Personal achievement
and potential growth are other
important considerations.
And while the process may
change somewhat under
James Montoya, the new dean
of admissions, the basic steps
of admitting students are like
ly to remain the same, admis
sions deans said.
The process begins when a
high school student sends in
the basic information form
and $50 fee (or waiver), and a
file is set up for him or her.
The file is not read until it is
complete. Last year about 800
applicants failed to complete
their applications or withdrew
voluntarily during the process.
Bunnell said the office's
large support staff dealt with
organizing the more than
13,500 applications that were
received last year.
The staff began reading the
files in mid-January. During
the heaviest reading period,
they worked as much as 12 to
14 hours a day.
