# Tough decisions pave admissions path
## 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
The college admissions pro
cess can be one of the most
mysterious and frustrating
parts of a high school senior's
life.
But for the deems in Stan
ford's Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, selecting the next
class of new students is an
exhilarating — and exhausting
— task.
The main criterion in the
admissions deans' decisions is
academic achievement, said
John Bunnell, associate dean
and director of freshman admis
sions. Personal achievement
and potential growth are other
important considerations.
And while the process may
change somewhat under
James Montoya, the new dean
of admissions, the basic steps
of admitting students are like
ly to remain the same, admis
sions deans said.
The process begins when a
high school student sends in
the basic information form
and $50 fee (or waiver), and a
file is set up for him or her.
The file is not read until it is
complete. Last year about 800
applicants failed to complete
their applications or withdrew
voluntarily during the process.
Bunnell said the office's
large support staff dealt with
organizing the more than
13,500 applications that were
received last year.
The staff began reading the
files in mid-January. During
the heaviest reading period,
they worked as much as 12 to
14 hours a day.

James Montoya, Stanford's new dean of undergraduate admissions,
says he's committed to working closely with students and helping
create a diverse community.
Each file was reviewed by at
least two of the admissions deans,
and the great majority of the folders
— more than 8,000 — were read by
three or more. In the first readings
— which lasted about 20 minutes
per application — they tried "to
cream off students who are not
competitive," Bunnell said.
After the initial readings, 1,900
students were deemed to be clear
cut "admits," more than 3,700 were
designated as "denials" and around
2,500 were put "on hold" for yet
another review.
Bunnell said the admissions
deans communicate about the "on
hold" candidates primarily through
memos; they meet in subgroups to
discuss the 100 or so "tough calls."
The toughest decisions involve
applicants who might not be able to
do Stanford work but by overcom
ing difficult circumstances have
shown that they "have a real
spark," he said. They might not be
that competitive — they don't have
a high GPA or SAT score to "hang
their hat on" — but "they could add
a lot to Stanford and get a lot out of
it," Bunnell added.
Bunnell said he values diversity
in the staff as well as in the student
body, noting that the deans have
differences of opinion over matters
such as the value of SAT scores and
the differences between certain sec
ondary schools.
Often one dean becomes a strong
advocate for a student that another
dean did not find interesting. Bun

nell acknowledged .hat each dean
comes to the position with certain
biases but that they "try to watch
out for them."
, The office is "not too eager to
promote" the media-hyped tricks
some students have tried to get into
selective colleges, he said. "The per
ception is you have to do something
gimmicky to get in. What catches
our eye more is a strong tran
script."
Some candidates' actions are
quick turnoffs fbr the deans.
Bunnell said he doesn't like is
when students ignore the instruc
tion, "Please do not enclose a
resume or extra pages of informa
tion." Some students have attached
a four-page resume or 40-page
research paper. One year an appli
cant sent everything he had ever
written from kindergarten to the
12th grade, Bunnell said.
A few candidates are "smart
alecks," writing responses such as
"What a dumb question!" or "Why
do you expect me to answer this?"
Another turnoff for Bunnell is an
application that contains an essay
written for another school, one that
was clearly tailored from another
college's question or an essay that
doesn't respond to the question.
Essay questions for freshman
entering in fall 1992 include:
"Please discuss one or two academ
ic interests or out-of-class activities
that have meant the most to you"
and "Jot a note to your future col
lege roommate relating a personal
anecdote that reveals something
about you."
The main essay is a choice
between the following: "If you could
spend a year pursuing any activity,

all expenses paid, what would you
do? Be specific and describe why
your choice is meaningful to you"
and "Describe a familial, cultural or
national tradition that has specific
significance for you."
Teacher recommendations are
very important, but a poorly writ
ten recommendation won't hurt
the applicant; Bunnell acknowl
edged that counselors and teachers
are often very busy. However, he
said, extra letters on behalf of the
applicant "make us wonder — what
are they hiding?"
Three or four applicants per year
are discovered to have lied on their
applications by altering their tran
scripts or other information.
If a candidate has ever been
placed on probation, suspended or
expelled from any school, or been
convicted of a criminal offense, he
or she must explain the circum
stances on a separate sheet. Most
candidates who respond list speed
ing and parking tickets; only a
handful of candidates actually pos
sess criminal records.
Bunnell said the office will some
times check on the crimes, but will
not automatically reject a student
with a criminal record. "Sophomore
slump can happen anytime," Bun
nell said, noting that the crime may
have been a life-altering event.
Senior-year grades are also very
important to the Admissions
Office, Bunnell said. "Stanford is
known for its emphasis on the
senior year." That is why the Uni
versity does not allow early action
or early decision.
Over the years the office has
estimated it is necessary to offer
admission to 2,750 candidates in

order to enroll 1,600.
Bunnell, who calls himself "the
director of rejections," mails an
explanation of the process to stu
dents who are not accepted. Gener
ally, a huge flow of appeals prais
ing rejected students streams into
the office from April until the sum
mer.
Sometimes one student can
generate a mound of appeals, from
teachers, coaches, community
leaders and friends. But all deci
sions are final, Bunnell said,
because the logistics involved in re
reviewing applicants would be
immense.
However, a file was re-exam
ined in one case: The applicant's
school had accidentally sent a tran
script of a low-achieving student
who had the same name as the
applicant.
Last year the deans also re
examined files of 100 students
whose grades had dropped during
their final semester of high school
and sent letters to more than 40.
Nine students wrote back explain
ing the drop. Some were repentant;
some acknowledged, "I blew it";
others said they were celebrating
their Stanford acceptance. Accep
tances were revoked for a few stu
dents whose grades dropped dra
matically.
But some of the responses were
"sobering," Bunnell said. Some
underwent such difficult problems
"it's amazing they did as well as

they did."
The admissions process is gen
der-blind, but deans do consider
minority status. Since the early
1970s, Stanford has targeted three
minority groups: Chicanos and
Latinos, African-Americans and
Native Americans. Bunnell said the
University started this policy
because some groups were being
left out of college admissions. How
ever, minority applications are not
read as a group.
"In general, we're always consid
ering background," Bunnell said.
"Where is the student coming
from? What factors play a role in
the student's life?" He noted there
are also many disadvantaged
whites; for example, the back
ground of a son or daughter of a
poor Irish-American farmer would

be considered.
Bunnell said the number of tar
geted groups is not expected to
increase, even though the issue has
come up often in the last two to
three years.
Many of the deans travel around
the country recruiting students and
encouraging many students who
might otherwise not consider a
selective school to apply.
Legacies — the relatives of
alumni — are not read as a group,
he said, but legacy status can tip the
scales in their favor in case of a tie.
But "we won't take a 'B' student
over an 'A' student" just because he
or she is a legacy, Bunnell said.
Stanford's public image has
taken a beating recently, but Bun
nell said the indirect-cost scandal
has had little effect on admissions.
The college admissions pro
cess can be one of the most
mysterious and frustrating
parts of a high school senior's
life.

national tradition that has specific
significance for you."
Teacher recommendations are
very important, but a poorly writ
ten recommendation won't hurt
the applicant; Bunnell acknowl
edged that counselors and teachers
are often very busy. However, he
said, extra letters on behalf of the
applicant "make us wonder — what
are they hiding?"
Three or four applicants per year
are discovered to have lied on their
applications by altering their tran
scripts or other information.
If a candidate has ever been
placed on probation, suspended or
expelled from any school, or been
convicted of a criminal offense, he
or she must explain the circum
stances on a separate sheet. Most
candidates who respond list speed
ing and parking tickets; only a
handful of candidates actually pos
sess criminal records.
Bunnell said the office will some
times check on the crimes, but will
not automatically reject a student
with a criminal record. "Sophomore
slump can happen anytime," Bun
nell said, noting that the crime may
have been a life-altering event.
Senior-year grades are also very
important to the Admissions
Office, Bunnell said. "Stanford is
known for its emphasis on the
senior year." That is why the Uni
versity does not allow early action
or early decision.
Over the years the office has
estimated it is necessary to offer
admission to 2,750 candidates in

order to enroll 1,600.
Bunnell, who calls himself "the
director of rejections," mails an
explanation of the process to stu
dents who are not accepted. Gener
ally, a huge flow of appeals prais
ing rejected students streams into
the office from April until the sum
mer.
Sometimes one student can
generate a mound of appeals, from
teachers, coaches, community
leaders and friends. But all deci
sions are final, Bunnell said,
because the logistics involved in re
reviewing applicants would be
immense.
However, a file was re-exam
ined in one case: The applicant's
school had accidentally sent a tran
script of a low-achieving student
who had the same name as the
applicant.
Last year the deans also re
examined files of 100 students
whose grades had dropped during
their final semester of high school
and sent letters to more than 40.
Nine students wrote back explain
ing the drop. Some were repentant;
some acknowledged, "I blew it";
others said they were celebrating
their Stanford acceptance. Accep
tances were revoked for a few stu
dents whose grades dropped dra
matically.
But some of the responses were
"sobering," Bunnell said. Some
underwent such difficult problems
"it's amazing they did as well as

they did."
The admissions process is gen
der-blind, but deans do consider
minority status. Since the early
1970s, Stanford has targeted three
minority groups: Chicanos and
Latinos, African-Americans and
Native Americans. Bunnell said the
University started this policy
because some groups were being
left out of college admissions. How
ever, minority applications are not
read as a group.
"In general, we're always consid
ering background," Bunnell said.
"Where is the student coming
from? What factors play a role in
the student's life?" He noted there
are also many disadvantaged
whites; for example, the back
ground of a son or daughter of a
poor Irish-American farmer would

be considered.
Bunnell said the number of tar
geted groups is not expected to
increase, even though the issue has
come up often in the last two to
three years.
Many of the deans travel around
the country recruiting students and
encouraging many students who
might otherwise not consider a
selective school to apply.
Legacies — the relatives of
alumni — are not read as a group,
he said, but legacy status can tip the
scales in their favor in case of a tie.
But "we won't take a 'B' student
over an 'A' student" just because he
or she is a legacy, Bunnell said.
Stanford's public image has
taken a beating recently, but Bun
nell said the indirect-cost scandal
has had little effect on admissions.
The college admissions pro
cess can be one of the most
mysterious and frustrating
parts of a high school senior's
life.
But for the deems in Stan
ford's Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, selecting the next
class of new students is an
exhilarating — and exhausting
— task.
The main criterion in the
admissions deans' decisions is
academic achievement, said
John Bunnell, associate dean
and director of freshman admis
sions. Personal achievement
and potential growth are other
important considerations.
And while the process may
change somewhat under
James Montoya, the new dean
of admissions, the basic steps
of admitting students are like
ly to remain the same, admis
sions deans said.
The process begins when a
high school student sends in
the basic information form
and $50 fee (or waiver), and a
file is set up for him or her.
The file is not read until it is
complete. Last year about 800
applicants failed to complete
their applications or withdrew
voluntarily during the process.
Bunnell said the office's
large support staff dealt with
organizing the more than
13,500 applications that were
received last year.
The staff began reading the
files in mid-January. During
the heaviest reading period,
they worked as much as 12 to
14 hours a day.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
James Montoya, Stanford's new dean of undergraduate admissions,
says he's committed to working closely with students and helping
create a diverse community.
Each file was reviewed by at
least two of the admissions deans,
and the great majority of the folders
— more than 8,000 — were read by
three or more. In the first readings
— which lasted about 20 minutes
per application — they tried "to
cream off students who are not
competitive," Bunnell said.
After the initial readings, 1,900
students were deemed to be clear
cut "admits," more than 3,700 were
designated as "denials" and around
2,500 were put "on hold" for yet
another review.
Bunnell said the admissions
deans communicate about the "on
hold" candidates primarily through
memos; they meet in subgroups to
discuss the 100 or so "tough calls."
The toughest decisions involve
applicants who might not be able to
do Stanford work but by overcom
ing difficult circumstances have
shown that they "have a real
spark," he said. They might not be
that competitive — they don't have
a high GPA or SAT score to "hang
their hat on" — but "they could add
a lot to Stanford and get a lot out of
it," Bunnell added.
Bunnell said he values diversity
in the staff as well as in the student
body, noting that the deans have
differences of opinion over matters
such as the value of SAT scores and
the differences between certain sec
ondary schools.
Often one dean becomes a strong
advocate for a student that another
dean did not find interesting. Bun

nell acknowledged .hat each dean
comes to the position with certain
biases but that they "try to watch
out for them."
, The office is "not too eager to
promote" the media-hyped tricks
some students have tried to get into
selective colleges, he said. "The per
ception is you have to do something
gimmicky to get in. What catches
our eye more is a strong tran
script."
Some candidates' actions are
quick turnoffs fbr the deans.
Bunnell said he doesn't like is
when students ignore the instruc
tion, "Please do not enclose a
resume or extra pages of informa
tion." Some students have attached
a four-page resume or 40-page
research paper. One year an appli
cant sent everything he had ever
written from kindergarten to the
12th grade, Bunnell said.
A few candidates are "smart
alecks," writing responses such as
"What a dumb question!" or "Why
do you expect me to answer this?"
Another turnoff for Bunnell is an
application that contains an essay
written for another school, one that
was clearly tailored from another
college's question or an essay that
doesn't respond to the question.
Essay questions for freshman
entering in fall 1992 include:
"Please discuss one or two academ
ic interests or out-of-class activities
that have meant the most to you"
and "Jot a note to your future col
lege roommate relating a personal
anecdote that reveals something
about you."
The main essay is a choice
between the following: "If you could
spend a year pursuing any activity,

all expenses paid, what would you
do? Be specific and describe why
your choice is meaningful to you"
and "Describe a familial, cultural or
national tradition that has specific
significance for you."
Teacher recommendations are
very important, but a poorly writ
ten recommendation won't hurt
the applicant; Bunnell acknowl

are often very busy. However, he
