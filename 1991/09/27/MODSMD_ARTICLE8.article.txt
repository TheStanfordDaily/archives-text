# Montoya brings creativity, love of Stanford to dean's office
## 
### Mara Mather Editorial staff 
The walls of his new office
are still bare, but James Mon
toya, Stanford's new dean of
admissions, has a friend from
Vassar College to keep him
company. His friend, a Kermit
the Frog puppet, sits atop a
stack of notebooks on Mon
toya's desk.
Montoya, who attended
Stanford as both an undergrad
uate and a graduate student,
seems at home in a community
he describes as "slightly irrev
erent but clever about it."
He hopes to make creativity
a hallmark of his career as a
college administrator. Barring
his use of imagination, howev
er, Montoya will certainly
make a mark on Stanford.
His experience should pre
pare him well. Former director
of admissions at both Occiden
tal College and Vassar College,
Montoya was also the dean of
students at Vassar.
As an undergraduate at
Stanford, Montoya majored in
Spanish with a focus on Latin
America. He received the
Dinkelspiel Award for scholar
ly attainment and outstanding
service to undergraduate stu
dents at his graduation in
1975.
"Jean Fetter is a hard act to
follow, but I think people will begin
to understand that in the same way
that Fetter brought her perspec
tive as a physicist and someone
who worked closely with faculty
that I bring different strengths,"
Montoya said. "My background as
someone who is used to a very
human and very personalized
admissions process allows me to
work closely with students."
As an alumnus, Montoya shares
Stanford students' love for the
school. "There are those who find
it difficult to believe that a student
can get a first-rate education at a
sunny, healthy environment, but it
is possible," he said. He empha
sized that Stanford's western roots
have created an institution which
"has tended to be a pioneer" with
"a sense of energy."
Though it may seem as if Mon
toya's career path led straight to
the arches of Old Union and the
Stanford Admissions Office, he
said, "The last thought in my mind
as a high school student was that I
would be a dean of admissions."
He said that a turning point was
when he served on a Stanford
undergraduate committee on
admissions and financial aid. "I
was a senior at that point and that
introduced me to the complexity of

the issues relating to admissions
and financial aid," he said.
With a smile, Montoya said, "I
was one of those students in high
school who was always a pain to
admissions officers. I was the type
of person who asked a lot of irritat
ing questions.
"I always felt the need to chal
lenge admissions officers to give us
information that was accurate and
not necessarily information that
made particular institutions seem
perfect."
Perhaps it is the memory of
those reluctant or unclear admis
sions officers that makes Montoya
so eager to be accessible to stu
dents. He said he wants every pos
sible applicant to Stanford to feel
welcome in the admissions office,
including those with parents who
may not speak English and those
who might not be able to visit the
campus.
"I feel that Stanford's commit
ment to pulling together a diverse
population and its commitment to
multiculturalism is important as
one of the reasons that I came back
to Stanford," Montoya said.
Assistant Dean of Admissions
Julie Taylor said, "I find it exciting
that Jim is a person of color
He has a personal commitment to
diversity; he's not just following
University policy."
Montoya said, "I think that we
in higher education are so focused
on numbers that we forget about
the fact that when we're talking
about targeted populations we're
talking about individuals."
Montoya sees himself as an edu
cator. He said, "Stanford provided
me with what I consider a rare
opportunity to maintain my com
mitment to undergraduate educa

tion and yet work in a large
research institution."
As Dean of Admissions, Mon
toya has little time left for anything
else. But if he did have the oppor
tunity to spend time teaching, he
said he would teach about the eco
nomics of education. "It touches on
so many issues that are important,
[including] issues of class and
issues of gender," he said.
Montoya said that Stanford def
initely maintains its commitment
to need-blind admissions, unlike
many colleges and universities
across the country. "We will look at
you and your ability in our decision
and not look at whether or not your
parents can pay," Montoya said.
"As a student who was heavily
dependent on financial aid for my
existence at Stanford, I think that
it can make a difference to a stu
dent who is wondering 'Do I really
have a chance?' Right now the mes
sages we are sending are [saying]
'Yes, there is a place for you and
we'll support you.'"
The admissions office, like the
rest of the University, will have to
tighten its belt due to budget cuts.
Montoya, however, remains opti
mistic. "I think that the budget
cuts come at an appropriate time in
that there is a new team in the
office with new ideas," he said. "It
will force us to be a bit more cre
ative."
Montoya said that the most dif
ficult part of his job will be "the
balance of travel [and] staying on
campus, making certain that I get
to know the community in the
way in which it deserves to be
known so that I can represent it
out on the road.... Travel is both
the best and the worst part of the
job."
