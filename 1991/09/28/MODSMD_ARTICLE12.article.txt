# 100 years of QBs: A factory of greatness
## Farm has signal-caller monopoly 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
The robber baron founder of
Stanford University, Leland Stan
ford, Sr., would be proud of the
Stanford football program.
Despite stringent academic regu
lations, Stanford has enjoyed a
near monopoly in the lucrative
football field of quarterbacks.

While others have tried to com
pete and many have succeeded
with bigger linemen, quicker
receivers or a grind-out running
game, Stanford has cornered the
quarterback market.

A look at the current Stanford
roster and its seven quarterbacks
might give you a hint, but the list
of All-Americans, professionals,
and national passing leaders that
have graduated from Stanford
tells the full tale of Stanford's
pass-mastery.

While Stanford has tallied an
impressive 552-335-51 mark in its
96 seasons of football on the
Farm and leads the Big Game
series against California 45-37,
with 11 ties, its most notable
impact on college football in the
last 100 years has been the inno
vation and perfection of the pass
ing attack.

Stanford Stadium has been the
laboratory of the quarterback,
and it has produced a plethora of
prize-winning pigskin flingers.
From Frankie Albert in 1939 to
Jason Palumbis in 1991, Stanford
has consistently fielded some of
the best quarterbacks in the
nation.

It is difficult to compare Stan
ford quarterbacks from different
eras, because football has evolved
and memories have faded, but it
is easy to trace the history of
Stanford's quarterback excel
lence.

Albert, who played under C.E.
Thornhill and Clark Shaughnessy
from 1939-41, is touted by many
as the greatest Stanford quarter
back in history. A two-time All-
American who went on to play
professionally for the San Fran
cisco 49ers and is in the NFL Hall

of Fame, Albert took a team that
had been 1-7-1 in 1939 and led it
to a perfect 10-0 record and an
inspiring 21-13 win over Nebras
ka in the Rose Bowl.
"Frankie was the best we've
ever had at quarterback," said
1942 graduate Howard Dallmar,
who has been coaching at Stan
ford ever since. "They invented
that great T-Formation and I
remember his shifty left-handed
delivery."
"You'd probably have to go
with the quarterback who played
ior winners," agreed Stanford
football historian Bob Murphy in
picking Albert. Murphy is a for
mer Stanford sports information
director and the voice of the Car
dinal on KCBS (740).
In the 1940 Rose Bowl season,
Albert directed the pass-attack T-
Formation offense created by
coach Shaughnessy. The offensive
innovation and throwing skills of
Albert started the quarterback
legacy that lasts today.

After Stanford canceled foot
ball in 1943-45 due to World War
11, Ail-American Gary Kerkorian
emerged as the next quarterback
great, leading the 1951 team to 9-
2 record and a Rose Bowl berth.

Kerkorian was succeeded by
Ail-American Bob Garrett, who in
1953 under coach Chuck Taylor
quarterbacked the Cardinal to a
6-3-1 record with his offense and
defense. Garrett, who also played
in the secondary, still holds the
Stanford season interception
record with nine.
Ail-American John Brodie fol
lowed Garrett from 1954-56, exe
cuting a Taylor-designed, Albert
inspired passing offense. Brodie
went on to stardom with the
49ers.
"Stanford couldn't out-muscle
teams like USC, and Chuck was
baptized on the T-Formation and
passing, so it was a natural evolu
tion," said Murphy.
Dick Norman took the snaps
from 1958-60 before Stanford
drifted temporarily away from the
passing game in the 1960s under
coach John Ralston.

"Coach Ralston centered on
toughness in the '6os, and they
were running it very effectively.
But in those days you had to beat
USC to get to the Rose Bowl, and
we couldn't beat USC running
the ball, so Chuck Taylor suggest
ed to John that maybe we should
develop the passing attack,"
explained Murphy. "Well, about
that time Jim Plunkett came
along, and all of a sudden we were
headed for the Rose Bowl."

Alongside Albert, Plunkett
stands as the most successful
Stanford quarterback and its only
Heisman Trophy winner. In 1970,
he led the team to a 9-3 record
and an upset 27-17 Rose Bowl vic
tory over an Ohio State team con
sidered the best ever.

"(Ohio State coach) Woody
Hayes thought throwing the foot
ball was a giveaway," said Mur
phy. "Passing was a sissy thing to
him."

Plunkett passed right past
Hayes and his Buckeyes, and
headed through New England,
San Francisco and Oakland to the
NFL Hall of Fame.
Stanford returned to the Rose
Bowl the next year riding the
strong arm of Don Bunce, now
the team physician. In a 13-12
Rose Bowl victory over Michigan,
Bunce completed 24 of 44
attempts for 290 yards.
Stanford's quarterback domi
nance continued through the
1970'5, as Mike Boryla, Mike Cor
dova, Guy Benjamin, Steve Dils
and Turk Schonert piggy-backed
as the best passers in the nation.
All five quarterbacks advanced to
the NFL, and under coach Bill
Walsh Stanford won the Sun and
Bluebonnet Bowls.

Howitzer-armed John Elway
followed in 1979 and quickly
emerged as the premier passer in
college football. Although his
teams never went Bowling and
his final 330-yard outing against
California was over-shadowed by
The Play, Elway stands alone sta
tistically as the best Cardinal
quarterback.
Elway stands atop a century

of great Stanford quarterbacks
in career passing yardage,
touchdowns, completions and
attempts.

"In raw terms of throwing a
football, John Elway would rate
at the top," said Murphy.
Elway's promotion to the Den
ver Broncos elevated John Paye
to the quarterback job from 1983-
86. Paye, who set the Stanford
season completion mark in 1985
with 271, took his team to the

Gator Bowl and was drafted by
the 49ers.
Senior Jason Palumbis, who
completed 68.6 percent of his
passes last year to lead the nation
and set a new Stanford mark, is
striving for his own spot in the
Stanford hisjtory books.
Leland Stanford can rest
peacefully knowing that at least
this monopoly has been pre
served. The past and future for
Stanford football is up in the air.
