# Injury epidemic strikes Card
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
After last week's Arizona deba
cle, Denny Green should have
some sympathy for Humpty
Dumpty. Like the egg of faiiy tale
fame, the Stanford head coach
was left wondering how to put his
pieces back together again.
At the end of the Wildcats'
come-from-behind victory, no
fewer than eight of the 11 Stan
ford defensive starters were
injured, a handicap that helped
turn a 17-0 Cardinal advantage
into a 28-23 loss. Add an injured
Glyn Milburn into the equation,
, and the effect was a severe crip
pling of the entire squad.
"It was difficult to come to the
sidelines and see Milburn and the
other key guys on the bench,"
said center Chris Dalman. "We
had to step up and do the job,
which we didn't do last week."
Fortunately for Green and the
rest of the Stanford team, Milburn
will be back this week against the
Buffaloes, as will most of those
defensive starters who had to miss
some of the Arizona game. Yet a
cloud of uncertainty still hangs
over the health of the team.
"Sure we're concerned (about
injuries)," Green said. "You have
to be concerned with injuries, but
a lot of it rests with how well the
guys come back."
Last weekend's bye could not
have come at a better time. Green
could afford to give his squad an
extra day off after the loss, and
the only wear and tear most of
the players suffered was possible
loss of blood in the buttocks as
they sat on their couches all day
and watched other teams play
their games.
But time does not heal all
wounds. Though Milburn and
most of the defense will be back,
defensive tackle Estevan Avila
underwent arthroscopic surgery
September 23 to repair cartilage
damage in his right knee and will

miss the game, as will outside
linebacker Ron George. In his two
games, Avila has recorded nine
tackles and forced a fumble, but it
is the absence of George that will
be the hardest to endure. George,
a junior, leads the team with 15
total tackles and is a force who is
hard to replace in Stanford's
perimeter defense, a defense that
will be stretched by Colorado.
The Buffaloes are a run-orient
ed team directed by Darian
Hagan, a player Green has called
"the best running quarterback in
the country right now." A senior,
Hagan has come back from a knee
injury to become a legitimate
offensive force.
The L.A. native is Colorado's
third best rusher with a 32.3
yards per game average, and has
improved his passing game
enough to be completing 60 per
cent of his passes. Stanford
already has problems with its
defensive secondary, but its pass
rush has also not been as effective
as Green would like. After two
games, the Cardinal has yet to
sack an opposing quarterback, a

stat that Ron George would help
to change.
"First off, we will miss him.
Second, his absence takes away
from the pass rush. We will have
to find other ways to defend
against that perimeter, which is a
big order against a team like Col
orado," Green said.
The loss of George is actually a
double negative, as his presence on
the field goes deeper than the way
he terrorizes opposing offenses.
"As much as we lose his talent,
we also lose his leadership," Dal
man said.
With the return of George's
linebacking partner Dave Gar
nett, the Cardinal will not be in as
bad straights as they were down
in Tucson, but will have to be
careful. Stanford's defensive
depth has been questioned this
year, meaning that even one
injury is a major event.
"(Injuries) are just not good,"
Green said. "They are a downer
for our team, and they give the
other team confidence. You have
to expect your best players to be
on the field from start to finish."
