# Farm athletic supporters: We lost? We'll live
## 
### Kevin Jeffery 
Losing. It's a funny thing, you know. It
tends to distort one's perception of things.
Watch a player, a coach, a writer or a fan
who's somehow engaged with a winning
team ... for them, there can be no wrong.
Their QB is sacked for a ten-yard loss
"Defense got lucky, minor setback." Their
kicker pushes a 32-yarder wide right
"Jeez, must have been the wind." Their sec
ondary gets beat for an 80-yard bomb
"No big deal," says beer guzzling fan, "now
their receiver's tired."

Ah, but the mortals lose a few in a row,
and you notice Mr. and Mrs. Hyde whistling
a different tune in the stands, in the press
box, and on the sidelines. Fans who once
memorized lifetime unassisted sack totals
assume an air of indignity. "Good for noth
ing &#ss#% ... never could come through
when it really counted." Journalists jump
on the bandwagon, and promise epic disas
ter. Even coaches and players conform their
words to fit their winning percentage.
For some reason, the effects of The Loss
aren't quite as pronounced here on the
Farm. Maybe it's because we've never estab
lished an incredible tradition of winning.
Maybe it's because sports in general take a
back seat to other interests. But the fact is
that Stanford athletics, and especially its
athletic supporters, seem sheltered from the
fallout of losing.

We've seen the transformation overcome
the crowd at Oakland Coliseum. Canseco
had an MVP-type season, but the fans were
so busy telling Jose how he should sleep
with Madonna, that they never bothered to
notice that he hit 40 long balls and drove in
110 runs. Why? The A's were losing.
The Niner (not-so) faithfuls redefined the
term "fair-weathered" in the second week of
the season. They booed and jeered the team

that has won two of the last three Super
Bowls and came within a last-second field
goal of reaching the third. Anyone want to
guess what the Niners did in week one?
Even the beloved, expert columnists of
that Green Paper occasionally succumb to
the hideous side effects of The Loss. "It is
the end of a glorious era," they proclaimed
after the San Franciscans sunk to 1-2. With
13 weeks left in the season, the defending
NFC West champs were given their last
rites. Yet these are the same men who save
the right foot of Matt Bahr, would right now
be extolling "The Greatest Team Ever," say
ing the Vikings just "got lucky" inside the
dome.
Of course, this is not to say that all sports
buffs are fickle except those who lay claim to
Stanford. But there is a manner about Car
dinal fans which keeps us on an even keel:
we don't go through the roof when we win,
and we aren't troubled too much when we
lose.
Ever hear Denny Green after a Stanford
win? Ever hear Denny Green after a Stan
ford loss? Not much difference. We're still
preparing for next week, trying to put today
behind us. Never too much emotion.
On the other hand, take Cincinnati Ben
gals coach Sam Wyche, the once-firey orator
who stalked the Riverfront sidelines while
his team made playoff appearance after

playoff appearance. His team just dropped
to 0-4 ... and his solution? Berate people for
caring about his team's success.
"You guys make this so much bigger
than life, like the whole economy revolves
around whether the team wins or not. It's
not life or death," he says.
That's good, Sam. Would never know
you're oh-for-four.
"They (the fans) should go out and play
golf. There's tennis to be served out there. If
you miss a putt, you tee it up again. The
same way with a football game. Don't come
out here and because your team loses,
you're so depressed it ruins your day."
What do you think? How often do you see
a melancholy mob of 50,000 saunter out of
Stanford Stadium and into an evening of
lamentation?
You show me one Stanford fan who is so
down after a game that his or her day is
ruined, and I'll show you 30 red-coated
trombone players still talking about how
great the beer and doughnuts tasted that
morning.
The Band might be the best example of
the Farm's tendency not to take its athletic
endeavors too seriously. Sure, the band is
there to support the team, but they're also
thereto show the rest of us a good time. How
many other schools have band members who
even know what "lampoon" means?
It's hard to visualize the Band at a uni
versity that eats, sleeps, and drinks football.
I can't see Alabama's Crimson Tide alumni
swaying to and fro to Ozzy Ozbourne's
Crazy Train. And Lou Holtz tearing off his
headphones to jump in "All Right Now?"
Somewhere Touchdown Jesus is frowning.
But at Stanford the Band works. It's
halftime shows take precedence over hot dog
runs. Even the Dollies are a breed of their

own, certainly not to be confused with yell
leaders. At Nebraska, students watch the
yell leaders for tips on when to clap and
grunt. At Stanford, students watch the yell
leaders for spelling errors.
And no one will ever accuse Stanford
enthusiasts for knowing too much about the
game of football. We don't really get
involved in cheering crucial third-down
plays. As a matter of fact, unless we've just
scored a touchdown, we don't really get
involved in cheering at all. But it could be
worse. At football factory/meat market
USC, as long as no Trojan is permanently
paralyzed on the play, the faithful will flap
in unison. Trojan band, leader: "Sweet. Two
yard gain, now we're really moving! "O.K.
guys... Dah, dun, dun, dun, dun, dah, dun"
So what it all boils down to is that Stan
ford fans have learned to enjoy athletics,
especially football contests, regardless of the
outcome; be it by necessity, as the Cardinal
has gone 20 straight years without a Rose
Bowl appearance; or by choice, as the cam
pus provides more than enough diversions.
The desire to watch a winner is there, but it
is not a burning one.
There's a lot of truth in what Sam Wyche
said, especially around here. I'll probably be
teeing it up and missing some putts tomor
row. Nobody's going to boycott the Notre
Dame game if we lose. We're playing the
defending national champions, it can't be do
or die. Besides, I heard about this nifty little
soiree Leland's going to throw, and wouldn't
it be a shame for his bash to be ruined
because we were all so depressed...

Kevin Jeffery is an undeclared sophomore
wondering when Ted Leland is going to
negotiate a 20 year home-and-home deal with
perennial stat-enhancing machine UOP.

same way with a football game. Don't come
out here and because your team loses,
you're so depressed it ruins your day."
What do you think? How often do you see
a melancholy mob of 50,000 saunter out of
Stanford Stadium and into an evening of
lamentation?
You show me one Stanford fan who is so
down after a game that his or her day is
ruined, and I'll show you 30 red-coated
trombone players still talking about how
great the beer and doughnuts tasted that
morning.
The Band might be the best example of
the Farm's tendency not to take its athletic
endeavors too seriously. Sure, the band is
there to support the team, but they're also
thereto show the rest of us a good time. How
many other schools have band members who
even know what "lampoon" means?
It's hard to visualize the Band at a uni
versity that eats, sleeps, and drinks football.
I can't see Alabama's Crimson Tide alumni
swaying to and fro to Ozzy Ozbourne's
Crazy Train. And Lou Holtz tearing off his
headphones to jump in "All Right Now?"
Somewhere Touchdown Jesus is frowning.
But at Stanford the Band works. It's
halftime shows take precedence over hot dog
runs. Even the Dollies are a breed of their

own, certainly not to be confused with yell
leaders. At Nebraska, students watch the
yell leaders for tips on when to clap and
grunt. At Stanford, students watch the yell
leaders for spelling errors.
And no one will ever accuse Stanford
enthusiasts for knowing too much about the
game of football. We don't really get
involved in cheering crucial third-down
plays. As a matter of fact, unless we've just
scored a touchdown, we don't really get
involved in cheering at all. But it could be
worse. At football factory/meat market
USC, as long as no Trojan is permanently
paralyzed on the play, the faithful will flap
in unison. Trojan band, leader: "Sweet. Two
yard gain, now we're really moving! "O.K.
guys... Dah, dun, dun, dun, dun, dah, dun"
So what it all boils down to is that Stan
ford fans have learned to enjoy athletics,
especially football contests, regardless of the
outcome; be it by necessity, as the Cardinal
has gone 20 straight years without a Rose
Bowl appearance; or by choice, as the cam
pus provides more than enough diversions.
The desire to watch a winner is there, but it
is not a burning one.
There's a lot of truth in what Sam Wyche
said, especially around here. I'll probably be
teeing it up and missing some putts tomor
row. Nobody's going to boycott the Notre
Dame game if we lose. We're playing the
defending national champions, it can't be do
or die. Besides, I heard about this nifty little
soiree Leland's going to throw, and wouldn't
it be a shame for his bash to be ruined
because we were all so depressed...

Losing. It's a funny thing, you know. It
tends to distort one's perception of things.
Watch a player, a coach, a writer or a fan
who's somehow engaged with a winning
team ... for them, there can be no wrong.
Their QB is sacked for a ten-yard loss
"Defense got lucky, minor setback." Their
kicker pushes a 32-yarder wide right
"Jeez, must have been the wind." Their sec
ondary gets beat for an 80-yard bomb
"No big deal," says beer guzzling fan, "now
their receiver's tired."

Ah, but the mortals lose a few in a row,
and you notice Mr. and Mrs. Hyde whistling
a different tune in the stands, in the press
box, and on the sidelines. Fans who once
memorized lifetime unassisted sack totals
assume an air of indignity. "Good for noth
ing &#ss#% ... never could come through
when it really counted." Journalists jump
on the bandwagon, and promise epic disas
ter. Even coaches and players conform their
words to fit their winning percentage.
For some reason, the effects of The Loss
aren't quite as pronounced here on the
Farm. Maybe it's because we've never estab
lished an incredible tradition of winning.
Maybe it's because sports in general take a
back seat to other interests. But the fact is
that Stanford athletics, and especially its
athletic supporters, seem sheltered from the
fallout of losing.

We've seen the transformation overcome
the crowd at Oakland Coliseum. Canseco
had an MVP-type season, but the fans were
so busy telling Jose how he should sleep
with Madonna, that they never bothered to
notice that he hit 40 long balls and drove in
110 runs. Why? The A's were losing.
The Niner (not-so) faithfuls redefined the
term "fair-weathered" in the second week of
the season. They booed and jeered the team

that has won two of the last three Super
Bowls and came within a last-second field
goal of reaching the third. Anyone want to
guess what the Niners did in week one?
Even the beloved, expert columnists of
that Green Paper occasionally succumb to
the hideous side effects of The Loss. "It is
the end of a glorious era," they proclaimed
after the San Franciscans sunk to 1-2. With
13 weeks left in the season, the defending
NFC West champs were given their last
rites. Yet these are the same men who save
the right foot of Matt Bahr, would right now
be extolling "The Greatest Team Ever," say
ing the Vikings just "got lucky" inside the
dome.
Of course, this is not to say that all sports
buffs are fickle except those who lay claim to
Stanford. But there is a manner about Car
dinal fans which keeps us on an even keel:
we don't go through the roof when we win,
and we aren't troubled too much when we
lose.
Ever hear Denny Green after a Stanford
win? Ever hear Denny Green after a Stan
ford loss? Not much difference. We're still
preparing for next week, trying to put today
behind us. Never too much emotion.
On the other hand, take Cincinnati Ben
gals coach Sam Wyche, the once-firey orator
who stalked the Riverfront sidelines while
his team made playoff appearance after

playoff appearance. His team just dropped
to 0-4 ... and his solution? Berate people for
caring about his team's success.
"You guys make this so much bigger
than life, like the whole economy revolves
around whether the team wins or not. It's
not life or death," he says.
That's good, Sam. Would never know
you're oh-for-four.
"They (the fans) should go out and play
