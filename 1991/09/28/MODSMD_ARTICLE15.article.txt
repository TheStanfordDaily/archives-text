# Vardell thrives on contactâ€”with the end zone
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
As the Cardinal's starting fullback,
Tommy Vardell's main job is to open up
holes for Glyn Milburn and the other Stan
ford halfbacks. Standing 6-foot-2 and 235
oounds, he is perfectly suited physically to
unning into and over people. This isn't
aews to Vardell, however, who has always
lived in a large body.
"I was a real big kid," he said. "I used to
play offensive guard and linebacker. I also
played in a higher age group, because I
couldn't make the weight limits (for my
own age group)."
To go along with his size, Vardell has an
attitude about contact that is ideal for a
fullback.
"One of the most satisfying things about
football is hitting," he said. "Blocking is a
good way for me to get that contact."
That's not to say that Vardell can't run
the ball. In the Cardinal's loss to Arizona
two weeks ago, Vardell was given the
chance to showcase his running ability
after Milburn was injured in the first quar
ter. Tommy made the most of the opportu
nity, piling up career-highs in carries (17),
rushing-yards (130) and longest- run from
scrimmage (48 yards). Yet despite perhaps
the best individual performance of his
career, Vardell was upset about Arizona's
comeback victory.
"You can do anything in the game, but if
you don't win, it's all ruined You put
too much work into football to lose the
only way to have your work rewarded is to
win."
Vardell's most obvious contributions to
Cardinal victories have been his patented
one-yard scoring plunges, for which he has
earned the nickname "Touchdown
Tommy." When the team drives to near
the goal line, everyone in the stadium
knows that big number 44 will be getting
the ball. But Tommy doesn't let that both
er him:
"I don't really think about it. I just stick

to fundamentals and execute the play. I
don't run any differently, but my running
style seems to be productive on the goal
line."
His bruising, rumbling style is the per
fect complement to Glyn Milburn's slash
ing and dancing, and opposing defenses
have major problems getting ready to stop
Vardell and catch Milburn.
"It's a big change for the defense (when
Glyn carries the ball). I'm about 50 times
slower than he is, so if they get used to me,
they're in trouble," Vardell said. "At the
same time they can't really afford to get
used to him either."
Stanford's dynamic backfield duo will
need to be in fine form for today's show
down with last year's co-national champi
ons, Colorado. Although the Buffs lost
Butkus Award-winner and unanimous first
team All-American choice OLB Alfred
Williams to the NFL, they are still loaded
on the defensive side of the ball, as Vardell
knows full well:
"Colorado, no matter who they lose, will
still be good . . . They have experienced
middle backers, and they're a hard-nosed
team."
Vardell should know about being hard
nosed, for he plays with a tough, uncom
promising attitude. This attitude, in addi
tion no doubt to his build, have caused
some to compare him to the 49ers Tom
Rathman.
"We wear the same number and we have
the same roles on two teams that run the
same offense," said Vardell, "so I can
understand how people see the likeness.
But I'm still very flattered to be compared
with him."
With all these apparent similarities
between Rathman and Vardell, one cannot
help but be optimistic about Vardell's
chances for a pro career.
But right now he just wants to help turn
around the Cardinal's slow-starting season.
"For me to be satisfied, I have to play to
my ability, my teammates have to play to
theirs, and we have to win."


Vardell, the Cardinal's rushing leader, is coming off one of the finest performances
of his storied Stanford career. Vardell ran for 130 yards, including a 48-yard TD, in
the Cardinal's 28-23 loss to Arizona.
