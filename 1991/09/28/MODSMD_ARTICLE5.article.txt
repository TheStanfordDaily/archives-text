# Cardinal faces defending national champs
## 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
On this Centennial weekend,
Stanford faces the University of
Colorado, renewing a rivalry that
dates back to 1904. Colorado
owns a 3-1 lead in the series,
with the lone Stanford victory
occurring on that inaugural
meeting in the early 20th centu
ry by the score of 33-0. Today,
however, marks the first time in
the 87-year history of the series
that the Buffaloes have come to
the Farm.

Stanford (0-2) has suffered
two early Pacific-10 conference
defeats to Washington and Ari
zona. In the Arizona contest, the
Cardinal squandered a 17-0 half
time lead, only to fall 28-23.
Running back "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell had a strong per
formance, tallying 130 yards on
17 carries, including a 48-yard
TD run.

The best thing that could have
happened to the Cardinal was the
fact that the team had a bye this
week. Injuries have hit the Stan
ford squad in a big way, and the
week off allowed for some much
needed rest time. Running back

Glyn Milburn, who suffered a
sprained right knee early in the
first quarter against Arizona, is
healthy and ready to play. So are
inside linebacker Tom Williams
(groin strain), inside linebacker
Dave Garnett (chipped bone in
right thumb), and free safety
Seyon Albert (bruised shoulder).
Outside linebacker Ron George
(deep thigh bruise) is questionable,
and defensive tackle Estevan Avila
will not play, as he has undergone
arthroscopic surgery for cartilage
damage in his right knee.
Coach Dennis Green said,
"The bye week allowed us to con
centrate on Stanford and make
sure that we are improving in all
aspects of the game."
Colorado (2-1) is coming off of
a 58-0 demolishing of the Min
nesota Golden Gophers last
week. This followed a narrow,
disappointing loss to Baylor, 16-
14, the previous week. Today's
game marks the first contest on
the road for the Buffaloes.

Coach Bill McCartney has his
team prepared to be visitors for
the first time this season. "I
think our guys will be really
excited and give a good account
of themselves," he said. "Person

ally, I like going to Stanford sta-~
dium. It's one of the great stadi
ums in the country it's a big
place and they play on natural
grass; it has a lot of personality
to it. Plus the game is going to be
on ABC. We've been at home for
the first three weeks and now we
are ready to take the road.
That's good timing."
The No. 17-ranked Buffaloes
are led by quarterback Darian
Hagan, and run an option
offense which is one of the most
powerful in the country. This
Colorado squad, however, is
younger than the team that won
the national championship a year
ago with only three seniors on
offense. The departure of run
ning back Eric Bieniemy, Col
orado's all-time leading scorer
and rusher (now with the NFL's
San Diego Chargers), has made
Hagan take a more assertive role
in guiding the team.
Coach Green stressed defense,
particularly the pass rush, dur
ing this past week of practice. He
commented, "I think it's impor
tant for us to improve our pass
rush and apply more pressure on

the quarterback. Colorado is a
very explosive team that can
break a game open on any play."
But McCartney was quick to
point out that despite its record,
Stanford should not be taken
lightly. "This team is so much
better than you'd think that it is
scary. Offensively, Stanford is
potentially as prolific as any
team in college football. They
have no weaknesses. They are
flat-out good."
A unique aspect to the Col
orado team is that this year,
Hagan is returning punts. "I
asked Coach [McCartney] jok
ingly about it this summer, and
he took me seriously," said
Hagan. The last time Hagan
returned punts was as a senior
at Locke High School in Los
Angeles.
When asked about the risk of
having your star quarterback
and most important player as a
punt returner, McCartney
replied, "The risk is not mine, its
the teams that have to cover
him. Much like Glyn Milburn,
the crowd gets excited because
he could make an exciting play
at anytime."

Stanford will be looking to
avenge its 21-17 loss to Colorado
in last year's season opener at
Folsom Field in Boulder. In that
game, the Cardinal caught the
then No. 6-ranked Buffaloes off
guard, striking twice in the first
quarter to take a 14-0 lead into
halftime. Colorado came back in
the second half, though. With
Stanford leading 17-14 in the
waning minutes, Hagan led the
Buffaloes on an 80-yard drive.
With first and goal at the one
yard line with under one minute
left in the game, the Stanford
defense made a courageous goal
line stand, stopping the Buf
faloes three straight times. But
on fourth and goal, Bieniemy
barely crossed the plane of the
end zone with 12 seconds left in
the game, allowing the Buffaloes
to escape with a four point win.

But McCartney was quick to
point out that despite its record,
Stanford should not be taken
lightly. "This team is so much
better than you'd think that it is
scary. Offensively, Stanford is
potentially as prolific as any
team in college football. They
have no weaknesses. They are
flat-out good."

Hagan is returning punts. "I
asked Coach [McCartney] jok
ingly about it this summer, and
he took me seriously," said
Hagan. The last time Hagan
returned punts was as a senior
at Locke High School in Los
Angeles.
When asked about the risk of
having your star quarterback
and most important player as a
punt returner, McCartney
replied, "The risk is not mine, its
the teams that have to cover

at anytime."

Stanford will be looking to
avenge its 21-17 loss to Colorado
in last year's season opener at
Folsom Field in Boulder. In that
game, the Cardinal caught the
then No. 6-ranked Buffaloes off
guard, striking twice in the first
quarter to take a 14-0 lead into
halftime. Colorado came back in
the second half, though. With
Stanford leading 17-14 in the
waning minutes, Hagan led the
Buffaloes on an 80-yard drive.
With first and goal at the one
yard line with under one minute
left in the game, the Stanford
defense made a courageous goal
line stand, stopping the Buf
faloes three straight times. But
on fourth and goal, Bieniemy
barely crossed the plane of the
end zone with 12 seconds left in
the game, allowing the Buffaloes
to escape with a four point win.
On this Centennial weekend,
Stanford faces the University of
Colorado, renewing a rivalry that
dates back to 1904. Colorado
owns a 3-1 lead in the series,
with the lone Stanford victory
occurring on that inaugural
meeting in the early 20th centu
ry by the score of 33-0. Today,
however, marks the first time in
the 87-year history of the series
that the Buffaloes have come to
the Farm.

Stanford (0-2) has suffered
two early Pacific-10 conference
defeats to Washington and Ari
zona. In the Arizona contest, the
Cardinal squandered a 17-0 half
time lead, only to fall 28-23.
Running back "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell had a strong per
formance, tallying 130 yards on
17 carries, including a 48-yard
TD run.

The best thing that could have
happened to the Cardinal was the
fact that the team had a bye this
week. Injuries have hit the Stan
ford squad in a big way, and the
week off allowed for some much
needed rest time. Running back

Glyn Milburn, who suffered a
sprained right knee early in the
first quarter against Arizona, is
healthy and ready to play. So are
inside linebacker Tom Williams
(groin strain), inside linebacker
Dave Garnett (chipped bone in
right thumb), and free safety
Seyon Albert (bruised shoulder).
Outside linebacker Ron George
(deep thigh bruise) is questionable,
and defensive tackle Estevan Avila
will not play, as he has undergone
arthroscopic surgery for cartilage
damage in his right knee.
Coach Dennis Green said,
"The bye week allowed us to con
centrate on Stanford and make
sure that we are improving in all
aspects of the game."
Colorado (2-1) is coming off of
a 58-0 demolishing of the Min
nesota Golden Gophers last
week. This followed a narrow,
disappointing loss to Baylor, 16-
14, the previous week. Today's
game marks the first contest on
the road for the Buffaloes.

Coach Bill McCartney has his
team prepared to be visitors for
the first time this season. "I
think our guys will be really
excited and give a good account
of themselves," he said. "Person

ally, I like going to Stanford sta-~
dium. It's one of the great stadi
ums in the country it's a big
place and they play on natural
grass; it has a lot of personality
to it. Plus the game is going to be
on ABC. We've been at home for
the first three weeks and now we
are ready to take the road.
That's good timing."
The No. 17-ranked Buffaloes
are led by quarterback Darian
Hagan, and run an option
offense which is one of the most
powerful in the country. This
Colorado squad, however, is
younger than the team that won
the national championship a year
ago with only three seniors on
offense. The departure of run
ning back Eric Bieniemy, Col
orado's all-time leading scorer
and rusher (now with the NFL's
San Diego Chargers), has made
Hagan take a more assertive role
in guiding the team.
Coach Green stressed defense,
