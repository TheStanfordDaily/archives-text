# Cardinal faces defending national champs
## 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
On this Centennial weekend,
Stanford faces the University of
Colorado, renewing a rivalry that
dates back to 1904. Colorado
owns a 3-1 lead in the series,
with the lone Stanford victory
occurring on that inaugural
meeting in the early 20th centu
ry by the score of 33-0. Today,
however, marks the first time in
the 87-year history of the series
that the Buffaloes have come to
the Farm.

Stanford (0-2) has suffered
two early Pacific-10 conference
defeats to Washington and Ari
zona. In the Arizona contest, the
Cardinal squandered a 17-0 half
time lead, only to fall 28-23.
Running back "Touchdown"
Tommy Vardell had a strong per
formance, tallying 130 yards on
17 carries, including a 48-yard
TD run.

The best thing that could have
happened to the Cardinal was the
fact that the team had a bye this
week. Injuries have hit the Stan
ford squad in a big way, and the
week off allowed for some much
needed rest time. Running back

Glyn Milburn, who suffered a
sprained right knee early in the
first quarter against Arizona, is
healthy and ready to play. So are
inside linebacker Tom Williams
(groin strain), inside linebacker
Dave Garnett (chipped bone in
right thumb), and free safety
Seyon Albert (bruised shoulder).
Outside linebacker Ron George
(deep thigh bruise) is questionable,
and defensive tackle Estevan Avila
will not play, as he has undergone
arthroscopic surgery for cartilage
damage in his right knee.
Coach Dennis Green said,
"The bye week allowed us to con
centrate on Stanford and make
sure that we are improving in all
aspects of the game."
Colorado (2-1) is coming off of
a 58-0 demolishing of the Min
nesota Golden Gophers last
week. This followed a narrow,
disappointing loss to Baylor, 16-
14, the previous week. Today's
game marks the first contest on
the road for the Buffaloes.

Coach Bill McCartney has his
team prepared to be visitors for
the first time this season. "I
think our guys will be really
excited and give a good account
of themselves," he said. "Person

ally, I like going to Stanford sta-~
dium. It's one of the great stadi
ums in the country it's a big
place and they play on natural
grass; it has a lot of personality
to it. Plus the game is going to be
on ABC. We've been at home for
the first three weeks and now we
are ready to take the road.
That's good timing."
The No. 17-ranked Buffaloes
are led by quarterback Darian
Hagan, and run an option
offense which is one of the most
powerful in the country. This
Colorado squad, however, is
younger than the team that won
the national championship a year
ago with only three seniors on
offense. The departure of run
ning back Eric Bieniemy, Col
orado's all-time leading scorer
and rusher (now with the NFL's
San Diego Chargers), has made
Hagan take a more assertive role
in guiding the team.
Coach Green stressed defense,
particularly the pass rush, dur
ing this past week of practice. He
commented, "I think it's impor
tant for us to improve our pass
rush and apply more pressure on


Cardinal head coach Denny Green is searching for his first win of
the 1991 season. It won't be easy for Green and his troops, as they
face the defending national champs today, followed by No. 9-
ranked Notre Dame.
