# Colorado/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Hagan, the Buff's versatile
field general, has returned to
All-American form after a
career-threatening knee injury
in last year's Orange Bowl.
Hagan has thus far passed for
467 yards and 4 touchdowns,
and is also third on the team in
rushing. Tommy Knecht, a con
verted quarterback, is second on
the Cardinal in tackles. Knecht's
experience at quarterback
should help in trying to contain
the multi-dimensional Hagan.

This crucial battle in the
trenches could be an obliteration
in Colorado's favor. Sophomore
Jason Fisk will have his'hands
full with Leeuwenburg, a consen
sus pre-season All-America and
Outland Trophy candidate. A
third-year starter, the team cap
tain, and only senior on the offen
sive line, Jay will open up many
holes for the Buffalo running
attack, which could have a big
day against a porous Stanford
rush defense. Leeuwenburg's
father Richard will have mixed
emotions today as he watches his
son play against his alma mater.

Garnett should be back in full
force after having to sit out
Stanford's game with Arizona
due to a chipped bone in his
right thumb. One of Stanford's
leading tacklers last season, the
junior from Naperville, IL, will
have to stop highly-touted red
shirt freshman Kahl. In his
effort to fill the vacuum left by
now-San Diego Charger Eric
Bieniemy, Kahl has rushed for
174 yards and four touchdowns
in three games.

Palumbis has yet to achieve
the passing proficiency that
made him the Pac-10's most
accurate quarterback a year ago.
Thus far, Jason has completed
only 54% of his passes (com
pared with 69% in 1990), and
has thrown two interceptions yet
no touchdowns. Figures will be
responsible for preventing Car
dinal big plays. The junior pre
season All-America, along with
senior Greg Thomas, anchors
the Buffalo secondary.

Both Vardell and Biekert
have been the most consistent
performers on their respective
squads. "Touchdown Tommy"
has rushed for 159 yards in two
games, including a 48-yard
touchdown scamper against Ari
zona. Biekert, last year's leading
tackier in the Big 8, has contin
ued to dominate opposing offens
es this season, tallying 38 tackles
in three weeks. Vardell has car
ried more of the Cardinal rush
ing load thus far this season due
to Glyn Milburn's leg injury.

The battle of notorious scandals
pits the Buffs' 1990 victory over
Missouri on a "sth down" play
against DK and his indirect cost
woes. Colorado stole a victory when
linesmen conveniently forgot about
a play and neglected to change the
down markers. In last year's most
over-publicized Congressional hear
ings, University President Donald
Kennedy was berated by a hyperac
tive senator from Michigan. The
Buffaloes escaped from infamy with
last year's national championship.
