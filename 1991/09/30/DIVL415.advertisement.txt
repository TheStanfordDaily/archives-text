DIANE MIDDLEBROOK
AUTHOR OF
ANNE SEXTON:A BIOGRAPHY
PUBLISHED BY HOUGHTON MIFFLIN
Ms. Middlebrook tells Sexton's story
with immense tact and compassion,
but she does not soft-pedal disturbing
and explosive material. Ms
Middlebrook gives us a living Sexton, a
gifted, vivd woman who strove, even at
her worst, for health, clarity and
human connection.
