STUDY FOR ONE YEAR OR FOR ONE OR TWO TERMS IN
OXFORD
and live with British Students
HOW Wise IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OVERBEAB PROGRAMS:
• Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later transcripts)
directly from an Oxford (or Cambridge) college.
• Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford college.
• Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence
associated with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully Integrated with
British students).
• Students accepted before November 1 (for the Winter Term) or before
May 1 (for next year) arc guaranteed housing with British students
• Students will NOT be taught In (and receive transcripts from) an
American college operating In Oxford. WISC is one of the few completely
Integrated (academically and In housing) overseas programs In the UK.
• Previous students In your field will speak to you on the phone.
