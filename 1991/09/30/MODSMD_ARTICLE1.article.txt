# Four is enough as Cardinal skins Buffs
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
There has been a rebirth on
campus. Amid the pomp and
circumstance of the Cen
tennial, the football team
showed Stanford University
that it too deserves celebra
tion.
While the school was busy
remembering how good things
have been, Cardinal coach
Denny Green and his boys
showed the community and
Colorado Saturday that things
aren't bad right now. Winless
in its first two tries, Stanford
finally notched a victory in its
belt, upsetting the 17th
ranked Buffaloes 28-21 behind
three Tommy Vardell touch
downs and a stingy Cardinal
defense.
"We hope it's a turning
point for us," said Green. "We
needed to go to the next level,
and we did that today."
The 57,394 screaming fans
who helped create the upset
were treated to a show of foot
ball that has not been seen in
Stanford Stadium for some
time. The score does not
reflect it, but the Cardinal
stampeded its visitors, leading
the Buffaloes in every offen
sive category while piling up
485 yards of total offense to
Colorado's 270.
Along the way, Stanford
kept the ball 13 minutes
longer than its Rocky Moun
tain opponents. In short, the
Cardinal whipped 'em.
"We knew we could beat

Tommy Vardell rumbles through a gaping hole in the Colorado defense for one of his three touchdowns. The senior full
back carried the ball 29 times for 114 yards. Backfield mate Glyn Milburn also rushed past the century mark with 106

The day was successful primar
ily because the Cardinal did not
let itself get caught up in old
trends. In last year's equally
exciting match-up, a 21-17 Col
orado win in Boulder, Stanford
kept blitzing to try to take away
the inside game of current NFL
player Eric Bienemey. The result
was an open invitation for quar
terback Darian Hagan to run,
something Stanford defensive
coordinator Willie Shaw knew
would only lead to another Col
orado victory.
Stanford played more zone
defense this year in an effort to
contain Hagan and the Colorado
option, and it worked.
"Colorado came back this year
with two backs thinking we would
blitz them like last year," said
Shaw. "But we played more zone
and pressured the option. We
brought two guys in on Hagan,
m and we didn't do that last year.
J Our defensive line is young and
p new, but at least they got in the
way."
In the final tally, Hagan only

even the score at seven, Hagan
managed a 20-yard touchdown
pass to put Colorado up 14-7, but
could not stick around. The
senior was taken out of the game
early in the third quarter after
being throttled by the George-
Byers sack. The Buffaloes, down
21-14, could only watch as their
offensive cog limped off the field.
"[The sack] felt great," Byers
said. "It came at a decent time
and really knocked the wind out
of their sails. It was a key play."
In a game full of key plays
there are many turning points,
but crucial to the Cardinal's vic
tory was the momentum gener
ated from the team's second
touchdown. Down 14-7 after
halftime, Stanford stopped Col
orado's initial possession of the
second half and managed a 12
play, 71-yard drive that lasted
5:48 and tied the game when J.J.
Lasley lunged over the middle
from the 1-yard line. Stanford
found itself with a fourth-and
eight situation on the drive's
ninth play, but elected to go for it
on the Colorado 32.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
found favorite receiver Chris
Walsh slanting over the middle
for 16 yards and a first down.
Lasley then took over the next
three plays and brought the ball
in largely on the strength of a 12-
yard run that could have gone for
a touchdown had free safety
Greg Thomas not grabbed the
halfback's facemask in despera
tion at the two-yard line. The
face mask penalty brought the
ball to the one, and Stanford
soon found itself tied with the
defending national champions
and thirsting for more.
"We had the momentum even
though it was tied," said Vardell.
"It was tied, but we had missed
three field goals and we still had
the momentum; we were still
driving."
Place-kicker Aaron Mills did
not have a great day, missing
first- half field goals of 42, 50,
and 29 yards, but Vardell was an
offensive powerhouse. The fifth
year senior rushed for 114 yards
on 29 carries, and caught four
balls for 94 yards. Vardell pyt
the Cardinal ahead to stay at
13:09 in the fourth quarter with
a a 20-yard scoring romp around
the left end, his longest run of
the day. The touchdown was the
second of what would be three
scores for Vardell, but was espe
cially satisfying because the full

back had taken himself out of the
game near the end of the first
half due to dehydration. After
having IVs pump liquid back into
his veins, Vardell came back to
the game when he heard the fans
react to Lasley's touchdown.
"I wasn't sharp mentally,"
said Vardell. "I didn't think I was
in a position to execute my
assignments, I felt better after
(the IV), but when I heard the
crowd I knew I had to get back
in."
The rehydrated Vardell scored
again to make it 28-14, yet the
game was not quite over.
Hagan's replacement, Vance
Joseph, made it interesting on a

12-yard touchdown toss with
3:47 left, but Stanford stayed
with its earlier successes, run
ning the clock out with power
football.
"The (offensive) line did a
great job," said halfback Glyn
Milburn. "They moved both
ways, and there were lots of
holes. They made it easy trying
to figure out which way to go."
When the gun sounded, the
crowd went wild and forced the
excited players to make a curtain
call. For the first time in a while,
"All Right Now" played in a
Stanford Stadium that really felt
good.
"It was a great game," said

Lasley, "I hope every game is like
this game."
The fans hope so too. Even
after a century of Stanford foot
ball excellence, there is certainly
room for more.
Card Notes
Milburn had the longest run of
his Stanford career when he scam
pered'"&fr yards to help set
Vardell s second scoring run. BotK
he and Vardell rushed for over 100
yards. Milburn was not used as a
kick returner, but was replaced
nicely by Ozzie Grenardo. A true
freshman, the 5-9, 165-pound
Grenardo took the opening kickoff
44 yards, then took his second kick

off 64 yards, tallying 124 yards on
three attempts. The opening return
set up the Cardinal's first score,
and the other two resulted in
missed field goals.
Fan participation was the most
impressive seen in Stanford Stadi
um in quite awhile. The huge block
"S" looked sharp and the "Go Stan
ford" cheer was very loud. Fan
even spread to Canadian
frime Minister Brian Mulroney,
who evidently got very worked up
over Milburn's long run. They are
used to more passing north of the
border.
Vardell joked after the game
that they used vodka and speed in
his IV — talk about a highball.

Quarterback Jason Palumbis scans the secondary to find an open receiver. He exploited Colorado's defense for 238 yards including a 16-
yard completion on fourth down to keep alive a touchdown drive.
