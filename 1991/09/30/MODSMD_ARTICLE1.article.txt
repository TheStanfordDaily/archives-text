showed Stanford University
that it too deserves celebra

While the school was busy
remembering how good things
have been, Cardinal coach
Denny Green and his boys

Colorado Saturday that things

in its first two tries, Stanford

who helped create the upset

485 yards of total offense to
Colorado's 270.

yards. For most of the afternoon the offensive line controlled the line of scrimmage and enabled the Cardinal to rack up
485 yards in total offense.
