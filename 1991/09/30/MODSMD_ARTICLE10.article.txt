Although the overall response to Cen
tennial Gaieties was positive, the genera
tion gap between alumni and students was
apparent at the Saturday night show
when several disgruntled alumni appeared
offended by the "Contraception" scene.
The scene in question, during which at
least one alumnus left the auditorium,
included songs about lUDs and a demonstra
tion of a condom being placed on a banana.
According to Allen Blue, the executive
producer of Centennial Gaieties, "two or
three people out of an audience of 1,700
were offended, but in general everyone

reacted positively.
Blue noted that "Ram's Head proceed
ed with tremendous respect for all mem
bers of its audience" and added that bal
ancing material that might offend people
with material that everyone could eiyoy
was "very difficult, if not impossible." He
emphasized that the show was "an accu
rate history of Stanford Gaieties."
According to Blue, the woman who
walked out during the show was overheard
in the lobby, saying, "Is this what the world
is coming to?" Blue, pointing out that Gai
eties' purpose is to represent Stanford stu
dent life, said, "My answer to her is, Tes,
this is what the world is coming to.' "
