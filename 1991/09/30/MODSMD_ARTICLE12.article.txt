No quick peace dividend
WASHINGTON (AP) — Administration offi
cials said yesterday there will be no short-run
savings in defense costs from President Bush's
dramatic nuclear weapons standdown.
"Over the next few months, or in fiscal year
'92, there are added costs with terminating con
tracts, moving systems around, destroying war
heads, etc., that had not previously been expect
ed," Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said on
ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley."
Cheney said the nation's military must be
ready to fight a regional conflict anywhere in
the world and the Strategic Defense Initiative is
needed in a world of nuclear proliferation.
New autos guzzle more fuel
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fuel efficiency in
1992 cars is down from last year's models,
marking the sixth consecutive year with little or
no reduction in new automobiles' appetite for
gasoline, the government reported yesterday.
According to the Environmental Protection
Agency's annual fuel economy statistics cover
ing about 1,000 cars, the 1992 models — both
domestic and imports — show an overall aver
age of 27.5 miles per gallon.
That is down from 27.8 mpg in 1991 and is
the industry's poorest showing since the mid
1980s.
Discrimination on death row
WASHINGTON (AP) — Amid a congression
al debate on how to impose the death penalty,
the Justice Department reported yesterday that
black Americans still make up a much larger
share of Death Row inmates than of the
nation's population.
The department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics said that as of Dec. 31, 1990, black
Americans comprised 40 percent of prisoners
awaiting death penalties. The 1990 census
found the U.S. population is 12.1 percent black.
In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled statistical
evidence of discrimination is insufficient to ren
der death penalty statutes unconstitutional.
