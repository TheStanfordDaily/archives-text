KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) -
President Mobutu Sese Seko and his
opponents chose an opposition leader
as prime minister yesterday despite
threats by government critics to kill the
new minister if Mobutu remained in
power.
Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of the
Union for Democracy and Social
Progress, was selected to form the so
called government of national crisis,
unconfirmed French media reports
said.
The appointment, which was widely
expected, remains to be approved by a

national conference of political leaders
that will convene tomorrow, the
reports said. ,
It was not clear what role Mobutu
would play in a new government or
what powers Tshisekedi would have as
prime minister.
Earlier, about 20 opponents of
Mobutu forced their way into his mar
ble palace and disrupted the nine hours
of talks aimed at keeping this vast
country from slipping further into
chaos.
The group told reporters that they
would kill Tshisekedi, 58, and other

opposition leaders if they agreed to
form a coalition government with
Mobutu remaining even as a figure
head.
The scene demonstrated Mobutu's
loss of control since unpaid soldiers
mutinied a week ago, pillaging
Kinshasa and other cities in this
sprawling Central African country of
30 million people.
France and Belgium sent 1,750
troops to evacuate foreigners, and the
soldiers' presence helped to quell the
rioting in the former Belgian colony.
But both Paris and Brussels have

demanded Mobutu end 26 years of dic
tatorial rule and allow democracy.
The unrest in Zaire comes amid a
wave of strikes, riots and protests that
have swept Africa in the past 18
months. So far, 16 one-party states have
been forced to legalize political opposi
tion, and three Marxist governments
have been unseated at the ballot box.
Mobutu's presidential guard reacted
with confusion as the band of minor
opposition figures pushed their way
onto Mobutu's palace grounds on
Sunday. A week ago, they would have
been shot.
