# Labor party moves closer to the right

BRIGHTON, England (AP) â€” The Labor Party
opened its annual conference yesterday in a position
for the first time in a decade to threaten the
Conservatives' hold on power.
"We can demonstrate this week that we are fit to
serve and ready to govern," declared Labor leader
Neil Kinnock, 49, who has discarded many of the
party's leftist tenets that turned voters to the Tories
in the last three elections.
The week-long gathering in this southern England
resort is the last before the next general election,
which must be held by July. If Labor loses, Kinnock
is unlikely to survive as party leader, many analysts
believe.
But Kinnock, who has dragged the party toward
the center since taking over seven years ago, is a vet
eran at coping with political adversity: a party 12
years out of office and poor personal ratings; attacks
from Britain's mostly right-wing tabloid national
newspapers; denunciations from Labor's angry left
ists.
The last Labor government was defeated in 1979,
and the Tories easily won the next two elections. But
now opinion polls show the two big parties running
neck and neck, and the campaign for the parliamen
tary elections has begun in all but name.
Between 1983 and 1987, Kinnock reversed the
party's position on several big vote-losers: pledges to
withdraw Britain from the European Community,
nationalize banks, ban private schools and levy "soak
the rich" taxes.
Now Kinnock has also dropped the party's
demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament, long a
cherished personal belief.
