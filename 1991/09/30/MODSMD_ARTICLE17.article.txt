Stanford is celebrating
one hundred years
of unparalleled success

Everyone has something
to say about the Centennial.
That the celebration is either
too glitzy or not glitzy enough. That
something deeper lurks below its
surface. That the Centennial is a
way of forgetting current problems.
Students, faculty and the admin
istration should strive to find some
thing a little deeper in Stanford's
100 th year than the Doobie Broth
ers, but they should also try to look
beyond the recent past and see
what gives Stanford the right to
have such a celebration.
No university has ever risen to
prominence as quickly as Stan
ford. Schools like Oxford and Har
vard were founded when there
were few others around, and took
hundreds of years to gain distinc
tion.
The University has been at the
forefront in innumerable fields.
Few can boast as many discoveries,
inventions and innovations as
have come out of these foothills.
Stanford gave birth to the Silicon
Valley, and continues to set the
standard today in many areas of
technology.
This prominence hasn't been
exclusively in technology either.
The numerous scholars and
thinkers that have been attracted
to Stanford have developed entire
new fields in the humanities.
No other similarly distinguished
university has offered women the
benefits of its education since its
founding. In 1943 the student body
elected its first woman president. It
wasn't until the 1960s that other
schools of the same caliber even
agreed to become coeducational.
And few can boast the same
sense of multicultural harmony
that Stanford has. The University
is far ahead of most universities in
celebrating true ethnic diversity.

It is true that Stanford faces dif
ficulty in the years ahead, but that
is not a good enough reason to shut
down the Centennial and pretend
there is no cause for celebration.
Critics are too often shortsighted.
This institution has faced problems
before, and survived quite well.
The classmates of 1906, for
instance, faced an epidemic of
typhoid during their freshman
year that claimed almost half the
campus population. In their
sophomore year dyptheria visited
and had much the same effect. The
trauma of their junior year was
Jane Stanford's death. And, of
course, in 1906 the San Francisco
earthquake leveled much of the
campus for their senior send-off.
In response to these catastro
phes, 1906 Class Historian W.
Fowler wrote, "We have no fears,
for we know that every Stanford
man and woman of the present
and every Stanford man and
woman that is to be will live up to
the Stanford standard and rise
above every difficulty."
So those who think this is the
class of hard-knocks, think again.
Think of the survivors that Stan
ford has graduated, and of the
stormy times that have been
weathered before. Think of the
pioneering in all fields that has
gone on here. Think of all those
people who have shared a Stanford
education and gone forth to do
great things.
And think about taking this
school into its next century with
all the poise and presence it
deserves. Yes, the University faces
adversity. Yes, there are problems.
But in the history of Stanford, no
problem has been too much for its
students, faculty and administra
tion to overcome. Today's Stanford
community is responsible for
upholding that legacy.
The glitz and publicity of the
Centennial Celebration cannot
overshadow the problems the cam
pus faces today. But neither can
those problems overshadow the
substantial and momentous histo
ry that is the reason for that glitz.
