## Scott Sagan United States must share nuclear safety technology 
### 
Recent events in the Soviet
Union provide great incentives
and opportunities for Washington
to cooperate with Moscow to reduce the
danger of accidental or unauthorized use
of nuclear weapons. The failed coup
starkly underlined these dangers when
the coup leaders took the top secret
nuclear authorization codes from Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev.
This action seriously compromised
the Soviet Union's "checks and bal
ances" system controlling nuclear forces,
which reportedly requires both the Pres
ident and Minister of Defense to issue
separate coded orders to launch the
weapons.
If Minister of Defense Dimitri Yazov,
presumably in possession of both codes,
had ordered the use of nuclear weapons
in a last irrational act of desperation, we
do not know that such orders would have
been followed by disgruntled military
commanders.
But we also do not know that such
orders would have been disobeyed. The
fate of the earth should not depend on
military commanders not obeying orders.
The coup's failure does not mean that
the problem of nuclear weapons safety
has been solved. In the chaos accompa
nying the splitting up of the Soviet
Union, the danger that a republic's mili
tia, a separatist group or a terrorist orga
nization could gain access to a nuclear
weapon has significantly increased.
In addition, if civil conflict emerges
and active fighting breaks out in the
vicinity of nuclear bases or between mil
itary units with different loyalties, there
is a heightened risk of a nuclear weapon
being caught in the cross fire. This could
produce the spread of highly toxic pluto
nium in the area or even, potentially, an
accidental nuclear detonation.
Fortunately, the opportunities have
also increased for the United States to
help the Soviet government maximize
safety and control of nuclear weapons.

A State Commission of top Soviet
politicians, scientists and military lead
ers has been formed since the coup to
design a new command system. Last
week President Bush proposed that the
"United States begin discussions with
the Soviet Union to explore cooperation"
in nuclear command and control.
Five specific steps should be taken.
First, the Unites States should share

would have reacted if their warning sys
tems had reported at that moment that
an enemy missile launch was underway.
Such risks could be greatly reduced if
both countries learned one another's
past failures about how to design safer
computer warning systems, training pro
grams and testing procedures.
Fourth, both nations have programs

information about our advanced catego
ry PALs, the electronic locking device
which reduces the risk of unauthorized
use. U.S. weapons labs are working on
protection systems which would auto
matically disable weapons if attempts
were made to circumvent safety devices.
We do not know the status of Soviet
capabilities in this area.
Second, we should discuss the ongoing
efforts to reduce the risk of plutonium
dispersal and accidental detonations if a
nuclear weapon is, for instance, dropped
from an aircraft, subjected to fire or hit
by lightning. U.S. leaders can share with
the Soviet Union some of its recently
developed technology in the area of pre
venting accidental detonation.
Third, both countries have experi
enced serious false warnings in nuclear
command systems. Fortunately these
occurred in peacetime when everyone
suspected that a computer glitch, and
not a real enemy attack, was the cause.
Imagine, however, what would have hap
pened if such a false warning occurred
during the confusion of the coup
attempt.
We cannot be certain how the Soviet

to screen potentially unstable military
officers and civilians in positions with
responsibility over nuclear weapons.
Neither side's programs are foolproof,
however, as witnessed in numerous inci
dents in recent years in both countries.
Joint discussion of advanced psychologi
cal testing and anti-drug and alcohol
abuse efforts might identify areas of
mutual improvement.
Fifth, the U.S. has some experience in
deactivating or removing nuclear
weapons from areas of civil and military
unrest. During the 1974 conflict over
Cyprus, for example, we took special
steps to ensure that U.S. weapons in
Greece and Turkey would not be stolen
or damaged by local forces. Sharing the
lessons learned from this episode might
help the Soviets better manage similar
problems.
Even with the end of the Cold War,
the future is uncertain. There will
always be technical limits on the com
mand and control information which the
United States can safely share with
other countries. Even with President
Bush's proposal, it is not clear how much
information American officials will be

willing to share about these secretive
subjects.
Legitimate concerns about such high
ly classified information, however,
should not be an excuse to show only
what is currently unclassified in the pro
posed discussions. It is in the national
interest of both sides to reduce the risk
of accidental nuclear war.
The traditional definition of classified
information was data whose release
would be harmful to the U.S. national
interest. In today's world, it is not releas
ing such information which would be
truly harmful to our national interest.
