# Federal audit targets more research costs
## $19 million in staff benefits questioned in leaked report 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A skirmish is developing on yet another front in
Stanford's war with the government over research
costs.
In a confidential report last week, federal audi
tors recommended that government reimburse
ments paid to Stanford for researchers' staff bene
fits should be slashed by about one-third — a move
that would cost the University more than $19 mil
lion this year.
Such a reduction would come on top of the loss
that resulted from the government's decision in
April to cut annual payments to Stanford for indi
rect costs of research by about $28 million.
As a matter of policy, the government reimburses
universities for the direct costs of conducting
research, as well as for the indirect costs — expens
es like electricity and maintenance that cannot be
easily attributed to a particular project — and for a
portion of the benefits the university pays its
researchers.
Benefits typically include health insurance, Social
Security, worker's compensation and retirement
plans.
The audit report's confidential recommendation
that staff-benefit payments be drastically reduced
was first published Saturday in the San Francisco
Chronicle and yesterday in the San Jose Mercury
News.
The recommendation is curious because the
University had apparently already reached a settle
ment with government regulators on what amounts
to $12 million of the $19 million in dispute.
Stanford is one of a few univer
sities nationwide that charges a
portion of the tuition of graduate
students engaged in federal
research to the government as a
staff benefit. Most other universi
ties include these tuition charges
in their bills for the direct costs of
individual research projects.
Stanford has been allowed to
bill tuition expenses as it does due
to a "memorandum of under
standing" signed years ago with
the Office of Naval Research, the
government agency that regulates
Stanford's research expenditures.
In April, when the naval office
slashed the University's indirect
cost payments, it also dispensed
with close to 100 accounting
agreements that had bound the
two parties' relationship during
the 1980s, saying the "memoran
da of understanding" could no
longer be relied upon.
The agreement on tuition
charges was the only one left
intact.
Over the summer, Rear Adm.
William Miller, the chief of naval
sity President Donald Kennedy
saying that Stanford could con

tinue to operate under the agree
ment for at least another year, as
both parties awaited a ruling on
the matter from the Office of
Management and Budget, the
government agency responsible
for formulating rules on research
related cost recovery.
According to Peter Van Etten,
the University's chief financial
officer, that remains the case.
"Nothing has changed as far as
we're aware of," he said in a brief
interview yesterday. •
Van Etten declined to com
ment on what the remaining $7
million in dispute entails, but said
most of it resulted from instances
where federal auditors did not
have adequate information —
information that Stanford will
soon be providing.
According to Stanford admin
istrators, charging graduate
research assistants' tuition as
part of the staff-benefit rate actu
ally saves the government money
and allows students more oppor
tunities to engage in federally
sponsored research.
Officials from the Defense
Contract Audit Agency, which
drafted the confidential audit
report, and from the Office of
Naval Research, the agency that
requested, the audit,.
available for comment over the
weekend.
