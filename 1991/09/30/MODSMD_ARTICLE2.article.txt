# Federal audit targets more research costs
## $19 million in staff benefits questioned in leaked report 
### John Wagner Senior staff writer 
A skirmish is developing on yet another front in
Stanford's war with the government over research
costs.
In a confidential report last week, federal audi
tors recommended that government reimburse
ments paid to Stanford for researchers' staff bene
fits should be slashed by about one-third — a move
that would cost the University more than $19 mil
lion this year.
Such a reduction would come on top of the loss
that resulted from the government's decision in
April to cut annual payments to Stanford for indi
rect costs of research by about $28 million.
As a matter of policy, the government reimburses
universities for the direct costs of conducting
research, as well as for the indirect costs — expens
es like electricity and maintenance that cannot be
easily attributed to a particular project — and for a
portion of the benefits the university pays its
researchers.
Benefits typically include health insurance, Social
Security, worker's compensation and retirement
plans.
The audit report's confidential recommendation
that staff-benefit payments be drastically reduced
was first published Saturday in the San Francisco
Chronicle and yesterday in the San Jose Mercury
News.
The recommendation is curious because the
University had apparently already reached a settle
ment with government regulators on what amounts
to $12 million of the $19 million in dispute.
