## Hope for judge Thomas 
### 
IN THE BEGINNING CLARENCE
Thomas really baffled me. I questioned
his political and social stances and found
them lacking. I compared him to his prede
cessor, the Hon. Thurgood Marshall, and got
flat out mad. How in the hell George Bush
could find the one conservative black man
from rural Georgia — how there could be a
conservative black man from rural Georgia
— amazed me.
There were so many questions to be asked
and answered. For weeks magazines attempt
ed to create some type of paper trail to give
insight into this enigmatic man. There were
lots of opinions, anecdotes and speculations,
but few concrete answers.
Then came the hearings. I found that an
ironic name because I heard nothing. Yes he
said this, yes he wrote that, yes he gave that
reason, BUT he couldn't discuss it because it
would prejudice his ability to be impartial on
the Court. All I saw of Thomas was what the
Republican spin control office wanted us to
see — poor boy who makes good against all
odds.
But what baffled me most was how much
I understood about Thomas. I too am a dark
child of the red clay hills of Georgia. Pin
Point, Georgia sounds much like my birth
place of Cuthbert, Georgia. The outhouses,
shacks with tin roofs, pea picking for pennies
a bushel in the hot Georgia sun, and the
obvious and accepted racial division are
imprints in my memory. I too know what it
is like to come from a society where your
place is behind, under or out-of-sight of

everyone else.
And I too had a grandfather who altered
my existence. My grandfather saw twelve
hour workdays at a nickel an hour while the
other man made a quarter. He never got out
of elementary school, but, in order to read
his beloved Bible, he taught himself to read
and made sure all of his children got the edu
cation he never had.
He and I had a special bond. He saw me
born, right there in his house. I saw him hold
his religion dear and live as he preached. I
stood in awe of his wisdom, his strength, his
conviction, and his unyielding love of me. He
never took a handout, but he gave all he
could to others. He never lost hope or gave up
in situations that would have made a lesser
man lose his religion and be driven to drink.
And he only accepted the best, from him
self and those around him. My love and
respect for him has always been a deciding
factor in my quest to be the best.
When I look at my brothers and sisters
lost in the ghettos of America, strung out on
crack, having babies young, turning to
crime, I love and respect Granddaddy even
more and I start to understand Thomas just
a little bit. We can overcome. People with
less than Thomas or I have gone further. I
think in his own way Clarence Thomas
wants us to return to being the men and
women our grandparents were and he
thinks his tough-love attitude is the way to
force us into it.
I don't even bother with being for or
against Thomas anymore because it's a

futile exercise. Although the man has split
the Judiciary Committee, he will most like
ly be sworn in as the next Justice. Regardless
of who Bush appoints, he or she will merely
be another conservative voice in an already
right-wing court. To quote something I read
earlier: "If I have to pick between two con
servatives, I'd much rather have the conser
vative who's been called 'nigger'."
I hope Thomas remembers that the role
of the individual and the power of self-help
are important, but also that we do not live in
a vacuum.
I hope he remembers that the system he
decries is the same system that allowed him
to enter the great halls where he now treads.
I say this not because I feel that he should be
grateful, but because he should remember
the reasons such a system had to be created
in the first place.
And most importantly, as he wields his
power to criticize and judge, I hope that he
remembers the power his history gives him
not only to change, but to care and under
stand.
