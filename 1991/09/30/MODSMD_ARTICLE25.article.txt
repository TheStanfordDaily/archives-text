## Magic marks Cardinal win 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Even before the opening kickofT of Saturday's
game, the weekend belonged to Stanford.
With the fanfare and celebration of the Centen
nial Celebration permeating the air, Cardinal fans
of all ages crowded sunny Stanford Stadium to
rally behind their team. As members of the class of
1930 donned their Stanford sweatshirts alongside
the class of 1995, a touch of magic was sparked
that must have found its way onto the field.
There is no other way to explain a convincing
win against the nation's No. 17 team just two
weeks after a losing battle against Arizona that
left the Cardinal battered and bruised, both phys
ically and mentally. Stanford needed a lift in order
to regain its confidence and face the remainder of
one of the toughest schedules in the country. And
somehow, amid the feverish pitch of excitement in
the stands and a little smile from Lady Luck, Stan
ford got it.
For once, most of the unexpected twists and
turns of the game ended up in Stanford's favor.
Granted, there were three missed field goals and
two turnovers, but these were more than made up
for by some outstanding performances. The sight
of freshman Ozzie Grenardo streaking down the
field for a 44-yard kickoff return on the first play
of the game was an indicator of things to come and
also a good example of the magical quality of the
day.
Grenardo, who later returned two more kick
offs for 64 and 16 yards, is a freshman who hails
from Colorado himself. After stepping in as kick
returner last week against Arizona for iryured
running back Glyn Milburn, he found himself pen
ciled in as the starting returner for Saturday's
contest.
"I was really nervous at first, but the coaches
told me that they put me in there for a reason,
because they thought I could get the job done, and
that gave me a lot of confidence," Grenardo said.
"The blockers also did a great job; people stepped
up and made big plays."
At 5-9 and 165-pounds, Grenardo is not exactly
a conventionally- sized football player. In fact,
"most of the Big-8 schools, including Colorado,
shunned me because they were looking for some
one bigger," he said. And who says revenge isn't
BWoot'^
But the football gods were not just looking after
the young on Saturday. Veteran players were

given chances to redeem themselves after making
mistakes, turning possible tragedies into gains.
For example, senior strong safety Tuan Van Le
roughed up Colorado punter Mitch Berger with
7:53 left in the first quarter, drawing a personal
foul penalty and giving Colorado a first down.
Three plays later, however, Le's aggressive play

sent Berger's punt wheezing 15 yards toward the
sideline and started Stanford on its own 44-yard
line.
With 5:29 left in the half, the Cardinal found
itself unable to drive the ball into the end zone
