the Lady Cougars on Friday and against the Huskies
on Saturday, improving its record to a perfect 10-0
for the season.
In front of a hostile crowd of over 1,500 at Wash

win convincingly, 15-4, 15-9, 15-5. Stanford was led
by senior Kristin Klein's 20 kills and .559 hitting per
centage, Amy Cooper's 10 kills and .692 hitting and
Nicole Appleman's .545 hitting percentage.
Washington State's defense was almost non-exis
tent against the overpowering Cardinal attack. In
three games, the Lady Cougars could only muster six
total blocks. Stanford, meanwhile, had only eight hit
ting errors for the night.
"[The match! was a lot of fun. They couldn't do
anything to stop us," Cooper said.
The next day the Cardinal traveled to Seattle and
had a more difficult time sweeping the Huskies, win
ning 15-11, 15-4, 16-14.
"Washington is an awful place to play. .. . The
fans there are really rough—they always find some
thing to pick on you about," Cooper said.
"[The Washington courtl is really bad—it's like a
high school gym. Everybody is right on the court,'
Appleman said.
In addition to being pumped up to play the
nation's top-ranked team, Washington had some
extra incentive to beat the Cardinal.
When the Stanford players arrived at Washington,
they went to the same locker room they've been
using the past few years only to find several quotes
on the walls from various publications about how the
Cardinal was a great volleyball team.
"I know those quotes were made up. The Wash
ington coach was trying to psych the players up,"
Appleman said.
Stanford still came out on top easily in the first
two games of the match. The Cardinal won 15-11 and
15-4.
Stanford almost gave the third game away with
mental errors and poor hitting, but the team made
'Gome adjustments, brought in some weapons off the
"We were blocking really well.
All of the sudden ... it was 9-1.
Then Heidi (Eick) came in and
played great—she served so well.
Piper (Hahn) came in and set
some balls too. They just really
woke us up. Then we started hit
ting well and came back," Apple
man said.
"We had trouble passing on
Saturday night. ... I don't really
know what happened. We were

down 9-1 in the third, and then I
looked up and it was 12-9," Coop
er said.
"I never get the feeling of
doubt in a match. We have a psy
chological advantage over most
teams because of that," Cooper
said.
The Cardinal hit .237 as a
team against Washington, and
the star players were ones who
had been quiet against Washing
ton State. Junior Bev Oden hit
.461 for the match with 20 kills
and 10 digs and Jennifer Jackson
hit .368 with 13 digs.
