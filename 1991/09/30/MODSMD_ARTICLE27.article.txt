"It was not an easy game," said
Cardinal women's soccer coach
Berhane Andeberhan after the
team's 5-0 pasting of the Univer
sity of Puget Sound. "They gave

us very little space on their side of
the field."
Not an easy game? You know
things are going well for the Car
dinal when "not easy" games are
won by a score of 5-0. Paced by
Julie Foudy's two goals and one
assist, Stanford cruised to an

early lead and never relinquished
control of the game. From the
game's opening moments, the
outcome was never in doubt.
The game was played almost
entirely on the 2-6 Loggers' side
of the field. The Cardinal, 7-0 and
ranked No. 9 by the NCAA, was

constantly on the offensive.
Stanford's sophomore goal
keeper Leslie Garrard notched
her fourth shutout of the season
without being given much of a
challenge. In fact, Puget Sound
went through a stretch of over an
hour without a shot on goal
before a shot from midfleld in the
26th minute of the second half
finally gave Garrard some action.
The Cardinal opened the scor
ing only 11 minutes and 10 sec
onds into the game as Foudy took

a cross from sophomore Sarah
Rafanelli and put it past Puget
Sound's Andrea Soldevila for a 1-
0 lead. It was Rafanelli's team
leading seventh assist of the sea
son.
At 14:50, freshman Andrea
Johnson scored with an assist
from Jen Potok to give the Cardi
nal a 2-0 lead and Johnson her
fifth goal of the season.
At 34:53 of the first half, the
game was delayed by 10 minutes
as a man sitting just outside the
Logger net refused to leave when
asked to. It took several officials
and coaches to convince the man,
who could not speak English, to
leave the field and to let the game
continue. At the end of the half,
the Puget Sound keeper, a friend
of the man, left the game to join
him and was replaced by Huong-
Duong Le.
Although she, like Soldevila,
did a very good job in goal, Le was

simply overmatched by the Car
dinal's non-stop offensive rush.
Pespite several great saves by Lq»
and many deflections of Cardinal
shots by the Puget Sound defense
and notably by fullback Tracey
Sheets, the Cardinal notched
three more goals in the half.
; The second period opened
with Rafanelli on an apparent
breakaway towards the net. Only
a miraculous play by the Loggers'
Krista Thomas to knock the ball
\vide kept Rafanelli from a sure
goal.
* On the ensuing corner kick, a
Stanford shot went towards the
top of the goal and was again
knocked out of bounds by Puget
Sound. A second corner kick
yielded a hard shot that barely
\vent over the net and out of
bounds.
Despite three consecutive
missed golden opportunities to
iscore, the Cardinal was not about
!to let up. Stanford stole the ball
,right after the goal kick and
'Foudy scored her second goal of
the game with 3:09 gone in the
half. With the score, Foudy
equaled her team-high 12 goals of
last season in only her seventh
game of the 1991 campaign.
At 65:57, junior Carolyn Ein
fctein scored her first goal of the
Season as she broke in all alone
and put it past Le for a 4-0 Car
dinal lead. Einstein became the
14th person to score a point for
the well-rounded Stanford
squad.

Le then caught fire for the
Loggers, making a few incredible
stops on shots by Amanda Tyler
and Rafanelli. Rafanelli had
come out of nowhere to make a
dazzling header that Le some
how managed to snare with 5:19
left in the game.
In the game's closing seconds,
Rafanelli took a pass from Foudy
and scored her eighth goal of the
year and the team's fifth of the
game. Rafanelli is second on the
team with 23 points to Foudy's
27.
The Cardinal defense was
once again impenetrable as Gar
rard was only called upon to
make two saves, both after the
game had been put out of reach.
The Cardinal allowed a miserly
four shots on goal while launch
ing 40 of their own. Stanford tal
lied 13 corner-kicks to the Log
gers' none.
In fact, the game was played
in the Logger end so much that a
good portion of the crowd moved
to sit at the other side of the field
so that they could sit where the
ball was going to be.

a cross from sophomore Sarah
Rafanelli and put it past Puget
Sound's Andrea Soldevila for a 1-
0 lead. It was Rafanelli's team
leading seventh assist of the sea
son.
At 14:50, freshman Andrea
Johnson scored with an assist
from Jen Potok to give the Cardi
nal a 2-0 lead and Johnson her
fifth goal of the season.
At 34:53 of the first half, the
game was delayed by 10 minutes
as a man sitting just outside the
Logger net refused to leave when
asked to. It took several officials
and coaches to convince the man,
who could not speak English, to
leave the field and to let the game
continue. At the end of the half,
the Puget Sound keeper, a friend
of the man, left the game to join
him and was replaced by Huong-
Duong Le.
Although she, like Soldevila,
did a very good job in goal, Le was

simply overmatched by the Car
dinal's non-stop offensive rush.
Pespite several great saves by Lq»
and many deflections of Cardinal
shots by the Puget Sound defense
and notably by fullback Tracey
Sheets, the Cardinal notched
three more goals in the half.
; The second period opened
with Rafanelli on an apparent
breakaway towards the net. Only
a miraculous play by the Loggers'
Krista Thomas to knock the ball
\vide kept Rafanelli from a sure
goal.
* On the ensuing corner kick, a
Stanford shot went towards the
top of the goal and was again
knocked out of bounds by Puget
Sound. A second corner kick
yielded a hard shot that barely
\vent over the net and out of
bounds.
Despite three consecutive
missed golden opportunities to
iscore, the Cardinal was not about
!to let up. Stanford stole the ball
,right after the goal kick and
'Foudy scored her second goal of
the game with 3:09 gone in the
half. With the score, Foudy
equaled her team-high 12 goals of
last season in only her seventh
game of the 1991 campaign.
At 65:57, junior Carolyn Ein
fctein scored her first goal of the
Season as she broke in all alone
and put it past Le for a 4-0 Car
dinal lead. Einstein became the
14th person to score a point for
the well-rounded Stanford
squad.

Le then caught fire for the
Loggers, making a few incredible
stops on shots by Amanda Tyler
and Rafanelli. Rafanelli had
come out of nowhere to make a
dazzling header that Le some
how managed to snare with 5:19
left in the game.
In the game's closing seconds,
Rafanelli took a pass from Foudy
and scored her eighth goal of the
year and the team's fifth of the
game. Rafanelli is second on the
team with 23 points to Foudy's
27.
The Cardinal defense was
once again impenetrable as Gar
rard was only called upon to
make two saves, both after the
game had been put out of reach.
The Cardinal allowed a miserly
four shots on goal while launch
ing 40 of their own. Stanford tal
lied 13 corner-kicks to the Log
gers' none.
In fact, the game was played
in the Logger end so much that a
good portion of the crowd moved
to sit at the other side of the field
so that they could sit where the
ball was going to be.
