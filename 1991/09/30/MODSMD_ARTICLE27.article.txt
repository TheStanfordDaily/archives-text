"It was not an easy game," said
Cardinal women's soccer coach
Berhane Andeberhan after the
team's 5-0 pasting of the Univer
sity of Puget Sound. "They gave

us very little space on their side of
the field."
Not an easy game? You know
things are going well for the Car
dinal when "not easy" games are
won by a score of 5-0. Paced by
Julie Foudy's two goals and one
assist, Stanford cruised to an

early lead and never relinquished
control of the game. From the
game's opening moments, the
outcome was never in doubt.
The game was played almost
entirely on the 2-6 Loggers' side
of the field. The Cardinal, 7-0 and
ranked No. 9 by the NCAA, was

constantly on the offensive.
Stanford's sophomore goal
keeper Leslie Garrard notched
her fourth shutout of the season

went through a stretch of over an
hour without a shot on goal

26th minute of the second half
finally gave Garrard some action.
The Cardinal opened the scor

Rafanelli and put it past Puget
Sound's Andrea Soldevila for a 1-

leading seventh assist of the sea
son.
At 14:50, freshman Andrea
Johnson scored with an assist
from Jen Potok to give the Cardi
nal a 2-0 lead and Johnson her
fifth goal of the season.
At 34:53 of the first half, the
game was delayed by 10 minutes
as a man sitting just outside the
Logger net refused to leave when
asked to. It took several officials
and coaches to convince the man,
who could not speak English, to
leave the field and to let the game
continue. At the end of the half,
the Puget Sound keeper, a friend
of the man, left the game to join
him and was replaced by Huong-
Duong Le.
Although she, like Soldevila,
did a very good job in goal, Le was
