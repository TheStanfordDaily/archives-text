The Stanford men's soccer team contin
ued its climb towards national prominence
Sunday with a 4-1 road win over highly tout
ed St. Mary's. The streaking Stanford squad
picked up its fourth victory in its last Ave
games, improving to 4-2-2.
Yesterday's win was a huge one for Stan
ford, propelling it right back into the run
ning for an NCAA Tournament birth. The
Gaels (4-3-0) entered the match with a No. 8
ranking in the latest NCAA Division I West
poll, while the Cardinal is No. 10. In addi
tion, St. Mary's last victory, a 2-0 road win
over nationally ranked Seton Hall, had given
the Gaels an added momentum edge.
Although the national playoffs are still

enhance Stanford's image in the eyes of

While the final score of the match sug
gests a blowout, the actual game was far
from that. In fact, it was St. Mary's that
opened the scoring 33 minutes into the first
half. John Ashworth converted on a Bob
Welsh corner-kick, giving the Gaels the ini
tial 1-0 lead.
The last 50 minutes of the contest were
dominated by Stanford. Freshman Ryan
Collins tied the match with less than a
minute remaining in the first half. The for
ward picked up a Jim Talluto cross pass,

nailing the far post for his third goal of the
season. Talluto, a junior forward, picked up
his team-leading 13th point of the season
with his assist.
The hot Collins struck again early in the
second half, picking up his fourth goal of the
year on a header at 46:19. Collins' second
goal of the game gave him a total of seven
points scored in his last three games, and
eight on the year. Midfielders Rhett Harty
and Randy Mann tallied assists on the play.
Stanford wrapped the game up with two
unanswered second half goals. Junior Jaaon
Vanacour capitalized on a one-on-one oppor
tunity from the top of the penalty box, giving
the Cardinal a 3-1 lead at the 57:35 mark.
Harty, a senior, added some insurance with
his third goal of the year, closing out the
scoring with about 15 minutes left in the
match.
