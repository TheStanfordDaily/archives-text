# Card water polo squad inconsistent in Nor Cal tourney
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Although the Centennial Weekend has thus far
proceeded quite smoothly, the Stanford water polo
team did not enjoy such an easy and pleasant week
end.
Going into the weekend, Stanford was ranked
fifth and was hopeful that a good showing could
solidify its position as one of the top teams in the
country, but after losing to No. 4 UC-Irvine, No. 6
USC, and No. 7 Pepperdine, the Cardinal are almost
certain to drop down into the No. 7 spot — a place
rarely seen by a Stanford team.
"We're in an unfamiliar position. We've really dug
ourselves into a deep hole, and it is going to be hard
to get out," said coach Dante Dettamanti.
Yesterday's game against Pepperdine typified the
kind of year the Cardinal is having, as the team came
close, but could not make the big plays necessary to
win the game.
"We're playing all right, except we're not coming
through with the critical plays on offense or defense
when we really need it. We've started scoring a lot
better now, but when it gets to a critical point in the
game, we just can't seem to come up with a goal,"
Dettamanti said.
And as is often the case, when things are going
bad, they often get even worse. "It's true that you
make your own breaks, but right now, we're not get
ting any breaks at all and those breaks would really
help us out a lot," Dettamanti said.
Against Pepperdine, the Cardinal needed every bit
of luck to stop the Waves star player Geoff Clarke, a
member of the Australian Olympic Team, but it was
Clarke who was on the receiving end of good fortune.
He ended up with five goals, including one when the
ball rebounded off the goal post and came right to
him for an easy score.
One optimistic sign from the Pepperdine game

was the reemergence of junior standout J.T.
Matarangas. One of Stanford's key players last year,
Matarangas had struggled so far this year, and after
the Irvine game on Friday, he was demoted to the
second string. After his showing this weekend, how
ever, Matarangas will no longer be on the bench, as
his four goals against Pepperdine gave him 11 in the
four-game tournament.
Dettamanti was clearly pleased with his star's per
formance. "He seemed to be sparked by being put on
the second team, and he really responded. He played
the way I want him to play and the way I know he can
play."
In yesterday's morning game, Stanford showed it
has found a way to score goals, as they compiled 14 in
the victory over Fresno State. After opening a 6-2
halftime lead, the Cardinal breezed to the 14-5 win in
which nine different players tallied goals. Once
again, Matarangas led the way with three goals.
On Saturday morning in the opening game of the
tournament, Stanford did not enjoy such an easy
time, as the Trojans of USC were too much for this
young Cardinal team. The score was tied at three at
halftime in this game, but then USC pulled away and
the struggling Cardinal were unable to find the nets.
The two players who weren't struggling, however,
were Matarangas and freshman standout Wolf Wigo
who respectively had three and two goals.
"Those two guys — Matarangas and Wigo — are
really carrying us right now. They seem to have got
ten on track and are starting to score consistently for
us."
After losing to USC, the team rebounded in the
afternoon with a 10-8 victory over No. 8 Pacific. Wigo
led the team with four goals while his scoring partner
Matarangas added three.
The weekend got off to a bad start on Friday in the
home opener of the year, as the Cardinal played well
at times but could not overcome the super shooting
display put on by Irvine.
