# Cowell plans to provide health insurance to domestic partners
##

Cowell Student Health Center hopes
this winter to become the first student
clinic in the country to provide health
insurance for the partners of unmarried
students in long-term relationships,
heterosexual or homosexual.
This move comes almost a year after
Stanford extended full benefits, including
housing, to domestic partners. Stanford

was the first university to systematically
award these benefits.
Currently, the implementation of the
health plan is tentative. Consumers
United, the company that plans to offer
the coverage, is under review by the
insurance company that backs it. These
new services will not be available until
mid-October, which is too late to provide
coverage for autumn quarter.
However, if no problems arise, the

plan should take effect this winter.
If enacted, the policy would cover
domestic partners in much the same way
that spouses are covered under the cur
rent Cowell policy. Though no exact
details have been developed, there may be
only a few differences: Maternity costs
will probably not be covered, and in some
cases, the maximum amount of coverage
for a single incident will be slightly less
than the current Cowell plan.

To qualify, interested students must
be in a monogamous relationship that
has lasted for at least six months; they
cannot be married to someone else; and
they must be at least 18 years of age.
Jane Meier, associate Director of Cowell,
has been involved with the committee that
has steered this entire process. "We were
looking for an alternative policy to cover
domestic partners in the same way that the
Stanford plan covers spouses," she said.

"No other college has offered this kind
of plan yet. Only Princeton is thinking
about beginning to work on one," she
added.
The committee, after finding that the
current Cowell carrier was cost-pro
hibitive for this policy, researched the
student market and settled on
Consumers United as the best choice.
The push for this plan began
last year with the drive for Uni
versity-wide domestic partners'
rights. When accord was reached
last October, health insurance
was the only part of the agenda

that was not agreed upon.
"We decided to take what we
could get," said doctoral student
Eleanor Feingold, the coordinator
of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, who worked
on the domestic partner issue last
year.
Housing rights, spouse cards
that allow access to campus facili
ties and the use of Cowell on a fee

for-service basis w&e all obtained
at that time. "But Cowell kept
working on insurance on their
own," she said. "They were doing
such a good job that we felt like
we didn't need to look over their
shoulders."
Feingold said she didn't think
the gay community was generally
aware that this change was about
to take place.
