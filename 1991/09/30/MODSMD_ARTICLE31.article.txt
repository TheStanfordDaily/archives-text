## 
### 
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Jason Hanson knew
he had a good chance to make a 62-yard field
goal, the longest in NCAA history without a
kicking tee. Unfortunately, he didn't get to
see the kick go through the uprights.
"I couldn't see it because I fell down,"
Hanson said. "It happened so fast (after a
penalty), I didn't have time to think.
"I was trying to calm down because I knew
I would have a great chance of hitting it."
Hanson's kick in the fourth quarter put
Washington State ahead of UNLV 31-13 Sat
urday night. The Cougars went on to win the
non-conference game 40-13.
Hanson, a seniai*..jnissed a 57-yard
attempt earlier. He has made more field goals
from 50 yards and beyond — 18 — than any
kicker in college history. His longest kick
before Saturday night was 58 yards, twice.
He is 18-of-26 in his career from 50 yards and
beyond.
The NCAA record with a tee is 67 yards,
first by Russell Erxleben of Texas in 1977,
then by Steve Little of Arkansas in the same
year, and again by Joe Williams of Wichita

State in 1978.
Drew Bledsoe scored on a pair of 1-yard
runs and passed for 260 yards and another
score as the Cougars won for the first time
after opening the season with three losses.
UNLV is 2-2.
Bledsoe, who completed 13 of 24 passes,
threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Phillip
Bobo in the third quarter.
Washington State scored two touchdowns
in a span of 1:38 in the second period to take
the lead for good.
With UNLV leading 7-0, Bledsoe tied the
game with his first scoring run, capping an
87-yard drive. Bledsoe's 26-yard pass to tight
end Butch Williams set up the score.
After forcing a Las Vegas punt, the
Cougars needed just two plays to score. Bled
soe hit C.J. Davis for 46 yards to put the ball
on the Rebels' 1-yard line. Rodney Scott then
ran in for the touchdown.
"I think I came out a little bit cold," Bled
soe said. "I got myself composed and got back
in the game. We kind of coughed and sput
tered, but once we got going, we did well.

"If we stay penalty-free, we can move the
ball against almost anybody."
Bobo's 41-yard punt return set up Bled
soe's 1-yard touchdown run in the third peri
od that extended WSU's lead to 21-7.
Henry Bailey of UNLV ran 47 yards for
the second UNLV touchdown in the third
quarter, making it 21-13. The Cougars
responded by moving 70 yards on six plays to
make it 28-13, scoring on the Bledsoe-to-
Bobo pass.
"We kind of broke from the game plan
because the pass was there so much," WSU
coach Mike Price said. "We wanted to run the
football, but we weren't consistent enough,
so we did go to the pass."
Washington State rolled up 449 yards in
total offense to 260 for UNLV.
"We knew coming in here they were a big,
strong, physical team," UNLV coach Jim
Strong said. "We tried to do some things
early in the game to try and put them on the
ropes a little bit. We had a chance in the first
half to really capitalize, and we didn't take
advantage of it."
