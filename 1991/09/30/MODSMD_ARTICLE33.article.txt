# Decision has far-reaching effects, legal scholar says

### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The federal court decision in
favor of Stanford is an impor
tant one in several controver
sial areas of law including
abortion, according to a legal
expert familiar with the field.
"This decision narrowed the
scope of the Rust (v. Sullivan)
ruling and did so in a plausible,
reasonable way," said Prof.
Rebecca Eisenberg of the Uni
versity of Michigan Law
School. Eisenberg is an expert
in the field of intellectual prop
erty and in legal issues of sci
entific research.
The Rust v. Sullivan decision
— handed down by the Su
preme Court last spring —
allowed a restriction prohibiting
health professionals in federally
funded family-planning clinics
from discussing abortion.
The reasoning for the Stan
ford decision was based upon
the Supreme Court's ruling
and explanation in Rust.
The Stanford decision "was
a reasonable interpretation of
how the Supreme Court distin
guished what they were doing
in the Rust decision from prior
decisions," Eisenberg explain
ed. "Courts try to distinguish
the decision they are making
from previous ones rather than
overrule the prior decision.
"Courts will go as long as pos
sible distinguishing their decision
from prior decisions before over
ruling a precedent," she added.
Eisenberg said that by
"relying on the language used
in Rust," Judge Harold Greene
was trying to "force a (future)
appellate court to reverse a
precedent" in order to over
turn his ruling.
But because the decision is
"offering a narrow interpretation
of a recent, controversial Su
preme Court ruling, it might be
vulnerable to attack and reversal
on appeal," Eisenberg said.
Neither the National Insti
tute of Health nor the Depart
ment of Health and Human
Services have said whether

sial Supreme Court
ruling.'

they might appeal, but Eisen
berg said it would "not be sur
prising" if it were appealed and
possibly even overturned.
"It depends on how impor
tant the confidentiality clause
and the issue of government
control of scientific publica
tions is to them," she added.
Although this decision was
the first of its kind in the area
of confidentiality clauses, it
will not necessarily end all gov
ernment attempts to include
confidentiality clauses.
"This opinion is solely con
cerned with the particular
aspects of this confidentiality
clause," Eisenberg said. "It is
not concerned with a number
of other grounds the govern
ment will try to use as justifi
cation to restrict publication,
such as national security."
The National Institute of
Health was trying to include
the clause in its contract with
Stanford to prevent the
"harmful publication of pre
liminary findings."
"The government clearly
had a weak interest in this
cause. There are other con
texts in which it might have a
stronger claim," she said.
Eisenberg said this decision
reverses a trend much broader
than either academic freedom
or the Rust case — a tendency
for the courts to "defer to the
executive branch of govern
ment for interpretation of reg
ulatory laws and authority.
"The courts have generally
been letting the executive
branch do what it wants,"
Eisenberg said. "This goes
against that trend."
