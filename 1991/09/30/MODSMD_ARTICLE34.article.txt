# No arrest made yet in Zapata incident
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Stanford Police have not yet
made an arrest in their investiga
tion of last week's reported rape in
Casa Zapata.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington had predicted Thurs
day a Stanford student would
"probably" be arrested for the
alleged assault by Friday.
But he said early Friday a possi
ble arrest would be delayed
because the Santa Clara County
district attorney had not finished
reviewing the case.
The district attorney must
approve cases before an arrest
warrant can be issued.
According to Herrington, the
police are now pursuing "other fol
low-up investigations" before they
make an arrest. Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer also said
Friday that the police have "some

new leads." Both, however, said
they could not be more specific.
The amount of time it takes for
an arrest to be made in cases like
this is "variable," Niemeyer said.
"This is not unusual," he said. "It
can take anywhere from a few days
to a few weeks."
The alleged rape occurred in a
student room in Zapata last Sun
day night. Herrington said the
police received a call from the
woman, a female student, shortly
before noon last Monday. They
have been investigating the case
since then.
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony
Burciaga said the incident
involved an individual male Zapa
ta resident. Ninety-eight people
live in Zapata.
Last week's alleged rape was
the first reported to Stanford
Police this year and only the 11th
reported to the police since 1980,
Herrington said.
