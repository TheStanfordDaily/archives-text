# Experts examine global issues in roundtable discussions
## Panel spars over ways to protect planet 
### Scott Handleman 
Eight distinguished thinkers
from government, business and
academia agreed yesterday that
protection of the planet should be
one of the most important issues
on the global agenda, but differed
widely over the wisest means to
achieve that goal.
These experts, who were partic
ipants in a Centennial roundtable
titled "Saving the Planet: What
Price? What Priority?," suggested
a broad range of measures to
brighten the planet's future, rang
ing from individual action to
sweeping government regulation.
Jessica Mathews, vice presi
dent of an environmental policy
research center, observed that in
50 years global population will
double, energy consumption will
triple and economic output will
quadruple. She warned that
"intense social innovation" is
essential to forestall catastrophe.
However, John Biyson, chair
man of the board and CEO of the
Southern California Edison Com
pany, argued that excessive gov

ernment regulation of business
causes "enormous waste and cost."
He noted that the public is increas
ingly concerned with environmen
tal protection and that, as a result,
market forces can reliably ensure
that businesses comply with
"sound environmental practices."
Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.,
countered that government lead

ership — which has not been
forthcoming from the Reagan or
Bush administrations — is critical
for ameliorating the "global envi
ronmental crisis."
Denis Hayes, a Stanford alum
nus and president and CEO of the
nonprofit organization Green
Seal, agreed that government
action is inadequate, calling

White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu a "James Watt with hair
and power," a reference to Presi
dent Reagan's Interior Secretary,
who was notorious for his anti
environmental sentiment.
Hayes, who founded Earth
Day, emphasized the importance
of individual initiative in the pro
tection of the environment.
