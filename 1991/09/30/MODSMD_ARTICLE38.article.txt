# Financial, technical assistance seen as keys to helping Soviets

The West must grant financial
and technical assistance to the
Soviet Union if that country is to
survive, a panel of foreign and
public policy experts agreed at
yesterday's "New World Order"
Centennial roundtable.
The speakers, including for
mer U.S. Secretary of State and
Hoover Fellow George Shultz and
U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
also discussed the role of China as
the only major communist coun
try, the roles of Japan and Ger
many as economic powers and the
role of the United States in the
future.
Condoleezza Rice, associate
professor of political science, said
she believes the revolution in the
Soviet Union will have positive
results if the three major
republics — Russia, the Ukraine
and Kazakhstan — become stable
democracies and form some kind
of trade exchange.
She said that without help
from the West, the future is grim.
"It is necessary to help them free
their own resources," Rice said.
In reference to questions about

giving handouts to the Soviets,
Winston Lord, former U.S.
ambassador to China, said, "It ia
better to teach them how to fish
than to give them fish."
Shultz said the economic
strengths of Germany and Japan
should not be viewed negatively
in a world that is becoming
increasingly interconnected. "It is
not [us] versus them and if you
win, I lose," added Shultz. He also
urged the reform of the world
monetary exchange to add stabili
ty to the world economy.
Former Stanford President
Richard Lyman said the United
States is a lonely superpower and
a giant in decline. "Economic
reform, clear, understandable
national purposes and sacrifices
by the United States are
required," Lyman said.
In reference to the Gulf War,
both Shultz and Solarz said the
war was stopped too soon. "The
ceasefire was handled in an
amateurish way," Shultz said.
Solarz added the United States
should explore the possibilities
of a war crimes tribunal and of
aid to the Kurds and other
rebels.
