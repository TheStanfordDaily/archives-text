Thursday's court decision
granting a federally funded
Stanford researcher permission
to publish without prior govern
ment approval has been hailed
nationwide as an important victo
ry for academic freedom.
"This decision is an important
affirmation of the proposition
that government has no business
restricting the publication of sci
entific research," said Robert
Rosenzweig, president of the
Association of American Uni
versities, a group of the nation's
leading research institutions.
"Stanford has done a significant
service for universities nation
wide."
The University filed suit in
federal court last October against
the Department of Health and
Human Services after the
National Institute of Health — a
division of the agency — with
drew a contract because Stanford
would not agree to a so-called
"confidentiality clause."
The clause required Stanford
researchers to submit any
research results for review and
approval by the institute.
Judge Harold Greene of the
U.S. District Court for Wash
ington, D.C., awarded the $1.5
million contract from the Nation
al Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute — without the objec
tionable clause — to Dr. Philip
Oyer of Stanford for work on arti

ficial heart devices.
Neither the Department of
Health and Human Services nor
the National Institute of Health
would comment on the case
Friday because both agencies
were "only now getting the deci
sion and reading what the judge
had to say," according to the
agency's press office. They also
refused to speculate whether an
appeal would be filed.
Oyer did not return phone calls
Friday, but others within the
University termed it a landmark
decision.
"The ruling is a real coup for
openness in research, and it
reaffirms Stanford's policy,"
said Patricia Devaney, associate
dean of research. "It will create
a precedent for other situations
when federal agencies may try
to include a confidentiality
clause."
Assoc. General Counsel Iris
Brest, the attorney who handled
the case for Stanford, said it was
of "absolute benefit to the whole
scientific field. ... It protects
against the problems of censor
ship."
Devaney said the decision was
important because the National
Institute of Health has "only
recently begun to insist" on
including the confidentiality
clause.
"I hope it will reverse that
trend (of insisting on a confiden
tiality clause) at Stanford and at
