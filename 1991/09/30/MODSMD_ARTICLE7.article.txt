Mulroney called for an immedi

Reconstruction and Development,
which was founded "expressly for
the purpose of nurturing democra

Mulroney said, "What is essen

and must help provide it.
"We (the industrialized coun

Soviet Union an olive branch; we
must also throw them a lifeline,"
he said.
According to Mulroney, "Cana

He said his country has already
granted preferential tariff treat

and suggested a similar policy
toward the breakaway republics
of the Soviet Union.
The prime minister also
praised President George Bush's
recent proposal for further nucle

"landmark in international rela
tions" and the president's words
an example for "enlightened lead
ership."
The banners of 96 countries
ranging from Algeria to Zimbab

tion by international students
from their respective countries.
