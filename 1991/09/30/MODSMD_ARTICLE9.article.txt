# Centennial weekend garners praise, criticism from visitors

### Andy Dworkin 
From "gaudy and unnecessary" to
"awesome . . .just amazing," visitors to
campus this weekend had a great deal to
say about Stanford's Centennial Cele
bration.
While some criticized the University
for neglecting students and spending
extravagantly in tight budgetary times,
many others enjoyed a weekend of foot
ball, academics and reminiscing.
"I've never been prouder to be a part
of this university, and I do see her (aca
demically) as my mother," said Lor
raine Bayuk, who received her doctor
ate in biological sciences in 1957.
"I think Leland Stanford and his wife
would be delighted with what they've
created," said Bayuk.
Not everyone gave the Celebration
such a favorable review, however.

Cynthia Wang, a sophomore, said it
was hard for some students to celebrate
with the University. "I think the stu
dents are being included, but because it
costs so much it's more geared toward
alumni," she said. "I tried to get tickets to
some of the Centennial events, but they
gave me the run-around, so I gave up."
"I would have liked to have seen
events geared more toward students,"
said Council of Presidents member Beth
Morgan. "I don't think students feel a
part [of the Celebration]."
John Cisneros, manager of Acapulco
Mexican Restaurant in Palo Alto, said
he felt Stanford was attempting to
include the surrounding community,
citing Centennial activities Stanford
sponsored in Palo Alto yesterday, such
as an oldest dress and oldest car contest.
Cisneros, who worked at one of about
10 food service tents at Saturday's

street dance, said he thinks Stanford
has been a good neighbor to Palo Alto.
"It has to be," he said. "It grew up
here."
But some people questioned the pro
priety of Stanford spending money on
the Celebration when the University is
facing financial problems.
Stanford graduate student Dan
Klein, a performer with Stanford
Improvisation — a comedy group that
performed as part of the Celebration
Saturday — said the Celebration "does
seem to be timed awkwardly" with
respect to the budget crisis.
"But from my standpoint, I don't see
the negatives," he said. "I know this
doesn't cost them anything because
they don't pay us."
Patrice Badstubner, Class of'7s, said
