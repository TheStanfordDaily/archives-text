Gandhi
"... Leave the outward expression, the doctrine, the dogma and
the form and behold the unity and oneness of spirit... Then
there will be no need to divide this universe of ours between
heaven and hell, no need to divide fellow-beings into virtuous
and vicious, the eternally saved and the eternally damned.
Love shall inform your actions and pervade your life."
