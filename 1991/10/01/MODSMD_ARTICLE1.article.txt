## Protesters descry 'fraudulent' government 
### Mara Mather Editorial Staff 
Every detail — from the little
Mexican flags given to the audi
ence to the red and white flowers
lining the stage — was carefully
planned for the Centennial Con
vocation "Beyond Schools: Teach
ing and Learning Together."
Yet despite all of the plans, the
University could not drown out
the shouts of demonstrators out
side the gates of Frost Amphithe
ater during the keynote address
by Mexican President Carlos Sali
nas de Gortari.
One sign held by protesters in
the audience during Salinas'
speech read, "Don't be fooled,
Mexico is still NOT a democracy."
Another read, "How many dead
people voted in the last election?"
Protest organizer Carlos Imaz,
a doctoral student at the School of
Education, said the Mexican gov
ernment's "lack of respect for
human rights and the lack of
democracy" spurred the demon
stration, which he estimated
included 70 people.
In his address, Salinas said:
"Mexico, of its own volition, has
set out on the path to change both
at home and in its relations with
other nations."
Addressing the convocation's
theme, the Mexican president
called education "an inner revolu
tion that joins the movement of

nations," a revolution that "has
an unsuspected impact on the
direction they take."
Salinas received load applause
when he switched from Spanish
to English and said, "We need
trade, not aid, to generate more
employment." He added that
Mexico needs development, but
not at the cost of the environ
ment.
Richard Lyman, Stanford's
seventh president, also spoke at
the convocation. He said in his
welcome address that Stanford
exists in "a world in which change
is the only constant."
Lyman said the situation calls
for a solution that combines disci
plines. We have never "stood in
greater need of a synthesizer. . . .
We must become more adept than
ever at forming partnerships with
other universities."
The presidents of four univer
sities — Cornell, UC-Berkeley,
MIT and Johns Hopkins —
addressed the audience, saluting
Stanford. The presidents of Har
vard and Indiana University, who
could not attend the convocation,
instead sent written messages,
read by Lyman.
The six institutions were cho
sen because Leland and Jane
Stanford consulted with the pres
idents of these universities to
help create their own vision when


While Mexican President Carlos Salinas deGortari spoke about his country's future, demonstrators rallied against the present dictatorship*
of the country.
