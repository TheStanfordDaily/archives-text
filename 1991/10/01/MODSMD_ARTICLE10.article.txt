# Soviets to discuss Bush's plan
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet
Foreign Ministry announced yes
terday it was sending a top diplo
mat to Washington to open nego
tiations on President Bush's arms
control proposals, and said unilat
eral cuts had not been ruled out.
But President Mikhail Gor
bachev said he was in no hurry to
give specific answers to Bush's
sweeping suggestions.
"The Soviet Union should not
respond urgently to the U.S. ini
tiative. Haste on such questions
by the U.S.S.R. and its president
would be an insufficiently
thought-out step on such an
important, major initiative," he
said, according to the state news
agency Tass.
In their most detailed response
to date since Bush's proposals,
senior officials told a Moscow
news conference that Deputy For
eign Minister Alexei Obukhov, an
arms control expert, will go to
Washington in the first 10 days of
October to open talks.
Obukhov will "consider in
detail the entire complex of ques
tions arising from the new pro
posals of the American adminis
tration, and also put forward
some of our ideas in return," said
First Deputy Foreign Minister
Vladimir Petrovsky.
The Soviet Union would like to
expand the proposals to include

strict limits on nuclear testing,
and eventually bring other nucle
ar countries into the talks, Petro
vsky said.
"We have accepted these pro
posals and we stand for the imme
diate start of dialogue on all these
subjects," he said.
On Saturday, Gorbachev wel
comed the proposals in general,
saying: "Our assessment of these
proposals is positive, is very posi
tive."
Bush, speaking yesterday in
Florida, expressed satisfaction
with the Soviet response.
"I'm very pleased with the
reaction from all around the
world. I was very pleased with the
Soviet reaction and I fully expect
that they will cooperate fully," he
said.
Bush announced Friday that
the United States would elimi
nate all its ground-launched,
short-range nuclear weapons;
withdraw all tactical nuclear
arms from U.S. ships; take strate
gic bombers off alert; and cancel
the development of the mobile
MX missile.
Although those U.S. steps are
unilateral, Bush called on the
Soviets "to go down this road
with us" and "to match our
actions" with unilateral cuts of
their own.
He also called for the start of

bilateral negotiations to eliminate
all intercontinental missiles with
multiple warheads.
"We do not exclude unilateral
steps" by the Soviet side, Petro
vsky said, speaking in English.
"But you know certain unilateral
steps need also some kind of qual
ifications and consultations."
He did not elaborate on the
qualifications. But Gorbachev
indicated Saturday that the Sovi
ets want to know more details
about the unilateral American
cuts.
"This matter is very complex
and we still have many ques
tions," Gorbachev said, noting he
had made some queries directly to
Bush on the telephone Friday.
Gorbachev said he had agreed
with Bush to find "a mutually
convenient forum" to clarify the
U.S. proposal without delay.
Petrovsky said Soviet Foreign
Minister Boris Pankin, who is in
New York for the U.N. General
Assembly session, has contacted
U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker "to jointly outline a sched
ule for practical realization of the
initiative."
Petrovsky said the Foreign
Ministry was ready to begin dia
logue on limiting underground
nuclear tests, a proposal the Sovi
et Union has made several times
before.
