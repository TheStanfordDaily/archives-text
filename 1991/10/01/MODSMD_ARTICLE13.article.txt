Student values are still
shaped by Dr. Seuss'
stories and teachings

THE LATE DR. SEUSS' melo
dious rhymes taught many a
Stanford student to read. He
created surreal dream worlds and
filled them with Grinches and
Zaxes and Cats in the Hat.
But most importantly, as he
taught us to read, Dr. Seuss also
instilled many of us with values we
still hold — values that have
helped shape much of what the
Stanford community believes in.
We Stanford students like to pre
tend we're hardened cynics. But
when we were little, we took Dr.
Seuss' stories and placed them in a
very prominent part of our psyche.
Remember the story of the
Sneetches? "Now, the Star-Belly
Sneetches had bellies with stars.
The Plain-Belly Sneetches had
none upon thars," the tale begins.
"When the Star-Belly children
went out to play ball, could a Plain
Belly get in the game? Not at all."
Into this divided society comes
Sylvester Monkey Mcßean, the
"Fix-it-Up Chappie," who gives the
Plain-Belly Sneetches stars for
three dollars each. But now, the
Star-Bellied Sneetches are no
longer 'superior' — so Mcßean
takes the stars off their bellies for
10 dollars each.
And back and forth they go, until
"every last cent of their money was
spent." At last the Sneetches decide
they should focus upon their simi
larities, not their differences.
As multiculturalism at Stanford
undergoes endless mutations, can
we draw inspiration from the story
of the Sneetches?
Then there was Yertle the Tur
tle: "On the far-away Island of
Sala-ma-Sond, Yertle the Turtle
was king of the pond."
But when Yertle discovers his
throne is not high enough to see all
the kingdom, he orders the other

turtles to pile beneath him so he
can survey the land.
Yertle doesn't heed the cries of
pain from Mack, the turtle on the
bottom. But when Yertle's throne
of turtles reaches almost to the
moon, Mack burps — and brings
the king down.
With Yertle now "the king of
mud," all the turtles are free, "as
turtles and, maybe, all creatures
should be."
Here we learned the importance of
the free individual — how one person
can make a difference, even when the
system seems too large to bear.
Can we forget "Horton Hears A
Who?," the elephant who hears a
little voice on a speck of dust cry
ing for help?
Horton can't see the little Who,
or the city of Who-ville, but he
decides, "I'll just have to save him.
Because, after all, a person's a per
son, no matter how small."
But the monkeys and kangaroos
tell Horton he is crazy. Only when
every last Who yells out, can the
others hear.
How many of us have been told
by everyone around that we're
crazy — just because they don't
believe our ideas? And how many
of us have pushed on in spite of the
doubt, perhaps a little inspired by
Horton's perseverance?
"The Lorax" was one of Dr.
Seuss' most tragic stories, one
which planted the first seed of
environmentalism in many Stan
ford students' minds. Within its
pages a land is destroyed by peo
ples' greed and lust for the beauti
ful truffula tree.
Machines are created to pick the
truffulas, and factories are built to
harvest them. All the while, the
seas are soured and the skies dirt
ied — by people.
When the Lorax looks at the dev
astated land around him, he takes
the last truffula tree and zooms off
into the clouds. He leaves behind a
stone engraved with a warning — a
word that has haunted millions of
young minds. A word that, hopeful
ly, we still remember.
"Unless."
