Food Service 9 should change its plans for the Row

WE, THE RESIDENTS OF 558
Mayfield, are writing to express
our outrage at the current Food
Service situation in our house and the
five other University-operated Row hous
es.
Last spring, when we signed our hous
ing agreements, it was with the knowl
edge that these houses had their own
cooks who prepared food for that particu
lar residence only.
When we arrived in residence this
September, we discovered that the cooks
had been removed from the residence
kitchens, and food would be delivered
from a large dormitory with a truck
instead.
We feel this change in our meal plans
constitutes a breach of contract and vio
lates the spirit of the housing agreement.
When Food Service decided to change
Stern to a point system, all students on
Food Service were contacted about the
Thanks Kappa Alpha
We would like to express our grati
tude to the Kappa Alpha fraternity for
their responsibility and concern regard
ing an incident that occurred during
their all-campus "Welcome Back" party
on the night of Sept. 23. As the disc
jockeys at this event, we had some
expensive equipment stolen, including
an $80 large blue siren. When informed
of this theft at the end of the evening,
the KAs went out of their way to com
pensate us for the loss. Although they
were not specifically at fault, it's nice to
know that organizations like Kappa
Alpha have the courtesy and respect to
take this kind of responsibility.
Welcome back KAs, and thanks.

change and told to choose their board plans
again. No notification was given about the
change in the Row food situation.
This uninformed decision to cut our
meals is unsatisfactory to residents of the
Row. We are paying the same amount of
money as students in large dormitories,
yet we are receiving only a fraction of the
services they do.
Not all the food available in the dormi
tories is brought to the houses. Thus, we
do not have the same number of meal
options as others. Invariably the food is
cold, or warm in the case of lettuce,
cheese and ice cream. The quality is far
below what is found in other residences,
and there is never enough food to feed all
the residents.
Besides these points, there are other
fundamental inequities. The dorms have
extensive salad bars, cereal bars, breads,
soda machines and milk machines. The
Row has none of these facilities.

Our salad bar is a little lettuce, a cou
ple of garnishings and bottles of salad
dressing — all of which are served warm.
Milk is served in small cartons, and usu
ally there is not a choice of whole, lowfat
and non-fat, never mind chocolate milk.
If we are paying the same amount of
money as other people, we expect to
receive the same services.
The consistent problems with our food
have forced students to go elsewhere to
take their meals. The result has been a
fragmentation of the house; no communi
ty is being given the chance to develop.
Most socialization and meeting of new
people takes place in the dining hall dur
ing meals. This is not taking place in the
Row houses; we might as well be living in
a hotel.
We appreciate the problems occurring
in these times of budget cuts. However,
we are paying the same amount of money
as other students and therefore expect to

receive the same services. Cutting out
our food is not acceptable. We are tired of
being treated as second-class citizens.
House residences have decided upon
two courses of action that would be
acceptable: 1) Hire cooks to cook in all
University-operated Row houses individ
ually, and 2) Allow these houses to
become self-operated residences where
they hire their own cook and purchase
their own food, if they so desire. Trucking
food is not an option.
Now that you are aware of the prob
lems and our concerns, we hope that you
will do something to rectify the situation.
We are prepared to see this through until
a satisfactory solution is reached.
