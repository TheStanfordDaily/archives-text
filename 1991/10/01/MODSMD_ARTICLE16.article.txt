YOU KNOW, YOU CAN learn a lot
about what's going on in someone's
world by reading their personal let
ters. Here's an excerpt from one I wrote
yesterday to a friend in Colorado:
Dear Rob,
What's up? Hope all's well with you.
Things are great here on the Farm.
Our campus is extremely hectic. We've
got tons of people in from all over to cele
brate our 100 th anniversary — the much
celebrated "Centennial." So there are
millions of tents, lots of hoopla and fes
tivities up the kazoo. We even get to miss
two days of classes. Could be fun.
Except for the backdrop against which
it's all being played out. Like the front
page articles about the recommendation
that we lose even more federal money. Or
the fact that six of the houses on campus
now get their food bused in from a central
kitchen, so that not only is it mediocre
food, but it's cold and stale as well.
And they still pay the same amount for
it as if it were the fresh, individually-pre
pared food that they expected when they
drew into those houses. What a deal!
Good thing nobody was notified about
those decisions before they were made —
people would have flocked to those hous
es. The administrative work that could
have been generated by such overcrowd
ing would have cost us a fortune.
Not to mention the budget cutbacks
across the board for academic programs.
Not enough money for teaching assis

tants, that kind of stuff. We'll probably
lose a couple of good classes as well — but
that's nothing new.
We're already on the verge of losing
Sleep and Dreams, one of the most popu
lar classes on campus. The professor
(who invented the term REM sleep)
already has to pay for most of the
course's expenses. I guess the fact that it
has one of the largest enrollments of any
course really isn't a good indicator that
students are interested in the topic.
Our overseas program in Tours (that's
in France, Rob) has already been closed.
Others to follow, I would imagine. No big
gie, I guess. I mean that's not really the pur
pose of a world-class university these days.
Word has it they don't send Courses
and Degrees (our class catalog) to the
frosh anymore because of budget cut
backs, so the new Stanfordians are arriv
ing even more clueless than usual. That
way they don't realize there isn't an
accounting major until they get here
(although in light of recent events, I
doubt they're hardly surprised).
At least the libraries are still open most
of the time (which is good, I guess). But even
if they weren't, we'd still have the recently
completed, beautiful new bench that sur
rounds a fountain at one of our libraries —
presumably so people can sit and marvel at
the fountain which likely won't operate for
years because of the drought.
But we sure know how to throw a party.
We even had paratroopers at the football

game (in which we beat CU, in case you
haven't heard). I'm sure the finale event
will be great as well: We have all kinds of
celebrities here to do their stuff in our
honor. At the game they announced a new
discount for tickets to the finale, which,
rumor has it, is over-budgeted and under
sold. Oh well, whoever does come will sure
ly be impressed by our sparkling new book
store and the neon signs in the Flo Mo din
ing hall lines.
I'm still trying to figure out why they
re-paved the Flo-Mo bicycle area and Cam
pus Drive before our majestic Palm Drive,
whose potholes have been swallowing up
students and visitors alike for years.
I'm no accountant or financial man
ager, but it sure seems like a billion-dol
lar institution should be able to avoid
some of these seemingly small potholes
on the road to success as a world-class
university.
Leland may have started in a buggy, but
it looks like we need a monster truck now.
