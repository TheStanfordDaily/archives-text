# No Farm for Hills

### Steve McCarroll Staff writer 
U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills said she doesn't have
plans to be a candidate for Stan
ford's ninth presidency.
"I'm so absolutely engrossed in
trade that I can't think of doing
anything else right now," she said
in a brief interview with The
Daily.
Hills was named as a possible
choice to succeed University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy in several
newspapers — including the San
Jose Mercury News and The
Peninsula Times Tribune — soon
after Kennedy announced on July
29 he would resign effective
August 31, 1992.
Hills visited Stanford this
weekend to attend Centennial
Celebration events and partici
pate in a roundtable discussion on
international trade and coopera
tion.
Candidates are typically non
committal this early in the presi
dential search process, according
to the book "Choosing a College
President," published by Prince
ton University Press.
Hills seemed popular with

alumni at the roundtable discus
sion, where she frequently drew
applause with her witty come
backs and her fielding of pointed
questions from Hoover Senior
Research Fellow Milton Fried
man and Japanese management
expert Kenichi Ohmae.
Hills articulated and defended
the trade policy pursued by the
Bush administration, including
the North American free-trade
agreement that she was instru
mental in negotiating.
She also criticized countries
that maintain high tariffs on agri
cultural imports, saying that such
tariffs prevent emerging democ
racies like those in Eastern
Europe, the Soviet Union and
Latin America from building
their economies with agricultural
exports. "Those democracies have
nothing else to sell," she said.
"We will sow political instability
and miss a historical opportuni
ty."
Hills has a long history of asso
ciation with Stanford, where she
earned her bachelor's degree in
1955. Two of her daughters now
attend the University, and Hills'
husband, Roderick Hills, is also a
Stanford graduate.
