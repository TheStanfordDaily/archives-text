# Medical school cuts budget to meet $77.7 million deficit
## 
### Steve McCarroll Staff writer 
When Dr. David Korn became dean of
the School of Medicine in 1984, he
pledged to bring the school to the cutting
edge of medical research.
Today, as he contemplates his plan to
reduce the school's budget in the face of a
$77.7 million five-year deficit, he can't
help seeing an irony in that. This wasn't
the cutting edge he meant.
"It has been a period of intensely ago
nizing deliberations," said Korn of the
discussion that went into the school's
current plan to cut expenses by $22.2

million by 1996. The rest, some $50.5
million, will be made up by a combination
of school and University reserves.
"The plan is aimed at protecting the
school's capacity to be a world-class insti
tution," 6aid Korn. That decision, howev
er, wasn't made easily.
Administrators had to consider a num
ber of alternatives, said Korn — such as
making a fundamental change in the mis
sion of the school, perhaps recasting it as
a kind of research institute with very
reduced clinical and teaching programs.
As the University begins the process
that will culminate in a final plan to cut
$40 million from its own operating bud

get, the School of Medicine is already
implementing its own cuts, forced to
develop its budget strategy on an acceler
ated timetable.
That process provided a number of
lessons, said Korn. First and foremost is
a profound need for the support of facul
ty, which Korn called "critical."
How can that support be maintained
in the face of drastic cuts? "You have to
communicate an understanding of what
the commercial business of the organiza
tion is," Korn said. "I've spent a lot of
time . . . relaying financial information to
the faculty."
Fiscal naivete, according to Korn, is a

recipe for faculty dissent. But under
standing the school's income-and
expense structure, allows faculty to view
the cutting process "with a little bit more
confidence and a little bit more trust,"
said Korn.
"The big problem is credibility," he
said. "I think that the faculty at the
School of Medicine have a much better
understanding" of fiscal operations than
most of the rest of the University's facul
ty, he added. The medical school faculty
has been "extremely responsive and
extremely supportive," he said.
Korn said he is glad to have that sup
port as the school confronts a budget

problem which is proportionally even
greater than that facing the University.
If the federal government's decision to
lower Stanford's indirect-cost recovery
rate to 55.5 percent was a blow for the
University, then it was almost a knock
out punch for the School of Medicine,
which is even more dependent on indi
rect-cost recovery. The school draws
almost half its operating budget from
recovery of indirect costs on sponsored
research.
Like the rest of the University, the
School of Medicine planned on a project-
Ed indirect-cost rate of 78 percent
for this fiscal year.
The school had spent the last
five years completing a long-term
clinical revitalization program,
conducting national recruitments
to fill the 23 vacated department
chairs out of a total 26.
Attracting top faculty to fill
those positions required a revital
ization of the school's long
neglected clinical programs, said
Korn. That meant making long
term financial commitments to •
construct new academic and
research space and to renovate
clinical departments.
Filling those vacancies with
top faculty will give the school one
of the best clinical programs in
the nation, said Spyros
Andreopoulos, the school's public
affairs director. But it has also
committed the school to substan
tial expenses for improvements
over the next four years.
"We couldn't imagine a less
propitious time for such a dra
matic drop in income," said Exec
utive Assistant Dean Richard
Jacobs.
The school's final budget-cut
ting plan, approved at a Universi
ty Board of Trustees meeting this
summer, includes the following
cuts:
• Reductions of approximately
7 percent for operating budget
expenditures and administrative
units.
• A one-time delay until March
1992 in implementation of 1991-
92 salary increases, in line with
the delay already mandated by

the University.
• A tax on expenditures from
departmental restricted funds.
• Withdrawal of 15 university
tenure-track faculty billets that
otherwise would have been filled
over the next four years.
• Cancellation of external
searches for chairs of the depart
ments of Pharmacology and Neu
rosurgery.
• Abandonment of plans to
construct permanent quarters for
the anatomy teaching program,
which was formerly housed in the
Anatomy Building and damaged
by the 1989 earthquake.
A priority in implementing the
cuts, said Korn, will be the preser
vation of the teaching and
research assistant programs, one
of the greatest student concerns.
"We can't weaken that because
that would change the whole qual
ity of the program," he said. "The
faculty and I have a very strong
commitment to maintain that."
The school also plans to launch
a major fund-raising campaign in
the coming year, for which Korn
said he hopes to get final approval
at Board of Trustees meeting in
December. Korn said he would
like to begin the program by early
1992
Although an official target for
the fund raising has not been set,
Korn said it is likely to be "in the
$40-50 million dollar range."
But Korn says that neither the
School of Medicine nor the Uni
versity will be able remain top
notch institutions if the Universi
ty's relationship with the federal
government does not get better.
"If we're going to continue ... it
is absolutely essential to improve
relations with the federal govern
ment. Maintaining high-quality

research will be all but impossible
at the present indirect-cost recov
ery rate.
"You just can't maintain an
enterprise where you're losing
money on your operation," Korn
added, calling for "a rationaliza
tion" of the relationship between
the University and the federal
government.
"Right now we're still being
flogged," said Korn, calling the
55.5 percent rate "a state of con
tinued punishment for sins."
The school's current budget
plan includes the assumption that
the rate will be at least 65 percent
in two years.
Korn is also monitoring devel
opments in the federal govern
ment's challenge of the practice of
graduate student tuition remis
sion, under which graduate stu
dents are charged lower tuition in
exchange for work as research
assistants. The discount is
charged to the staff benefits pool
and partially reimbursed by feder
al funds.
Termination of that program
would bring even greater austeri
ty to the University, especially to
the School of Medicine.
Korn said that the govern
ment's continued investigation
and challenging of cost-recovery
practices "has passed its point of
diminishing returns," becoming
less and less productive and
threatening research at universi
ties.
"There's an enormous amount
of expense that's being thrown
down the drain" in the govern
ment's ongoing audit of Stanford,
Korn said. "They're spending
$100 to get a nickel. I think even
the government's beginning to
realize that."
