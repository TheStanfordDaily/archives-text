# Medical school cuts budget to meet $77.7 million deficit
##

When Dr. David Korn became dean of
the School of Medicine in 1984, he
pledged to bring the school to the cutting
edge of medical research.
Today, as he contemplates his plan to
reduce the school's budget in the face of a
$77.7 million five-year deficit, he can't
help seeing an irony in that. This wasn't
the cutting edge he meant.
"It has been a period of intensely ago
nizing deliberations," said Korn of the
discussion that went into the school's
current plan to cut expenses by $22.2

million by 1996. The rest, some $50.5
million, will be made up by a combination
of school and University reserves.
"The plan is aimed at protecting the
school's capacity to be a world-class insti
tution," 6aid Korn. That decision, howev
er, wasn't made easily.
Administrators had to consider a num
ber of alternatives, said Korn â€” such as
making a fundamental change in the mis
sion of the school, perhaps recasting it as
a kind of research institute with very
reduced clinical and teaching programs.
As the University begins the process
that will culminate in a final plan to cut
$40 million from its own operating bud

get, the School of Medicine is already
implementing its own cuts, forced to
develop its budget strategy on an acceler
ated timetable.
That process provided a number of
lessons, said Korn. First and foremost is
a profound need for the support of facul
ty, which Korn called "critical."
How can that support be maintained
in the face of drastic cuts? "You have to
communicate an understanding of what
the commercial business of the organiza
tion is," Korn said. "I've spent a lot of
time . . . relaying financial information to
the faculty."
Fiscal naivete, according to Korn, is a

recipe for faculty dissent. But under
standing the school's income-and
expense structure, allows faculty to view
the cutting process "with a little bit more
confidence and a little bit more trust,"
said Korn.
"The big problem is credibility," he
said. "I think that the faculty at the
School of Medicine have a much better
understanding" of fiscal operations than
most of the rest of the University's facul
ty, he added. The medical school faculty
has been "extremely responsive and
extremely supportive," he said.
Korn said he is glad to have that sup
port as the school confronts a budget

problem which is proportionally even
greater than that facing the University.
If the federal government's decision to
lower Stanford's indirect-cost recovery
rate to 55.5 percent was a blow for the
University, then it was almost a knock
out punch for the School of Medicine,
which is even more dependent on indi
rect-cost recovery. The school draws
almost half its operating budget from
recovery of indirect costs on sponsored
research.
Like the rest of the University, the
School of Medicine planned on a project-
