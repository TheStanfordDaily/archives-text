## Women's field hockey runs over Chico State 
### Mike Langford 
It seems that Stanford may have discov
ered its heaviest hitter since Paul Carey.
Sophomore Sara Hallock continued her
North Pacific Conference dominance as
Stanford's field hockey team defeated Cal-
State Chico by a score of 2-0.
In just her seventh game this year, Hal
lock scored her ninth goal, almost single
handedly decimating the opposition. In
fact, those nine goals make up all but three
of Stanford's scores so far this season.
Senior Kris Puryear put one past the
Chico goalkeeper for her first goal of the
season to insure the blanking, bringing
Stanford's overall record to 5-2 and its
NorPac record to 2-0. Also contributing an
outstanding performance was the Stanford
defense, featuring senior goalkeeper
Kristina Vidal with her third shutout of
the season.
Coming off its first undefeated season in
its 17 year history, Stanford is making a
strong bid to defend its conference crown.
Despite the losses of Clare Stephens, Ellen
Lee and NorPac Player of the Year Tricia
McJennett to graduation, Stanford returns
a strong squad, including All-NorPac play
ers Hallock and Chris Trevino.
Trevino, a junior midfielder out of

Women's field hockey

Cardinal 2
Wildcats 0

Chicago, was chosen to be on the U.S. Field
Hockey Team at the ripe old age of 20.
Needless to say, she is one of the youngest
ever to be selected. In addition, this past
summer, Trevino helped her West team
capture the gold medal at the U.S. Olympic
Festival in Los Angeles.
Seventh year coach Sheryl Johnson can
also look forward to the contributions of
senior team captains Susan Leckrone and
Michele Beynet, who play midfielder and
right wing, respectively. Both contributed
mightily to the success of last year's team.
Highly touted recruit Tina Syer is also
expected to contribute immediately. Syer,
along with Hallock, was selected to the
U.S. Developmental B-camp, which is a
veritable feeder for the U.S. squad.
Stanford's next test comes against the
Weenies of California on Saturday, Octo
ber 5. It will be played right here on the
Farm at 11:00 a.m. on the field hockey
field, located right next to the intramural
fields.
