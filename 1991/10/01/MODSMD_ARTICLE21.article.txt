# Cross country women rule the open road
## 
### Noah Blake Staff writer 
Because cross country is largely an indi
vidual sport, it is usually difficult to con
clude much about a team's performance in a
meet. But when seven of a meet's top eight
finishers are all wearing the same uniform,
it is quite clear that one team is dominant.
And so it was for the Cardinal women's
cross country team, which annihilated run
ners from six other schools at the Fresno
Pacific Invitational. Freshman Jeannie
Rothman led Stanford's harriers over the
5,000 meter course, finishing first in 18:35.

Women's cross country

Fresno Invitational
Cardinal placed first

Pam Boyles from Cal-State Bakersfield
finished just three seconds behind Roth
man, but after her it was all Cardinal, as
Darah Truitt, Jill Shenkel, Susan Helfter,
Angela Inge, Kathy Luo and Lisa Goldman
placed third through eighth, respectively.
Such a decisive victory certainly sends a
message to the more than 75 schools coming

to the Farm to participate in The Stanford
Cross Country Invitational this Sunday.
Amazingly enough, the Cardinal was not
even at full strength last weekend. Junior
Ashley Black, the team's best runner, was
sidelined with a sciatic nerve problem, and
her return will make this juggernaut even
stronger.
Cardinal Director of Track & Field/Cross
Country Brooks Johnson calls Sunday's
competition "the biggest cross country meet
ever at Stanford." The Cardinal harriers
could hardly have more momentum coming
into the event.
On their home turf, this strong team
could be tough to beat.
