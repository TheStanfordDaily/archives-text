The Ford Athletic Center, central com

Sign-ups for the fall league sports will be

Center IM office. All-university league
sports for the fall are football, four-player
volleyball and coed inner-tube water polo.
There are also coed leagues in football and
volleyball, and a Sunday morning women's
football league. Vouchers will be distribut
ed Thursday at approximately 9 a.m. in
Ford to reserve places for those standing in
line.
The Betas were the overall IM champi
ons last year, edging Kappa Sigma and the
second-year business school students for
the title. Branner dominated the women's
competition, while Twain was the coed
points champion.
"Everyone knows it is tough to repeat,
but we'll give it a shot," said Beta senior
Chris Toft. "Last year was a lot of fun,
especially coming out on top."
Thursday at 5 p.m. is also the deadline to
register for the fall elimination tourna
ments. All-university tournaments are
offered in three-on-three basketball, bas

ketball free throws, billiards, golf, handball
doubles, table tennis doubles and wrestling.
Especially for women, tournaments will
be held in three-on-three basketball, free
throws, golf, table tennis doubles and ten
nis doubles. A cross country meet will be
held for men and women Saturday, Nov. 2
at 5 p.m. on the Stanford golf course, imme
diately following the Stanford Invitational.
Brackets and deadlines for all tourna
ments will be posted Friday, Oct. 4. There
is no registration after Friday.
"We look forward to a fun and safe fall
quarter for intramurals," said Intramural
Director Howie Dallmar, the NCAA basket
ball tournament Most Valuable Player in
1942 and a Centennial honoree last night.
"The rules for football will be the same as
last year, with screenblocking all over the
field to reduce injuries."
"We should be able to accommodate
everyone in the football leagues, but please
come with flexibility and patience," said
junior Nik Blosser, the IM staff member in
charge of football scheduling.
In football and volleyball, the leagues are
classified into divisions according to com
petitive skills. "A" league is the most com
petitive, while "B" league is the most popu
lar level of competition. The "C" leagues
are for the novice player, and do not include
playoffs or team IM points.

Rules for football and the other sports

questions and distribute registration

Teams registering for football will be
obligated to supply referees for two games.
The IM office is also hiring football refer

said.
"It is imperative that everyone show up
for their obligation hours, or the leagues
won't work," Dallmar said. "Refereeing is a
great job, and we encourage freshmen, both
men and women, to give it a try."
Clinics for prospective referees will be
held this Thursday and Friday at 4 p.m. in
the Ford Center.
Both Ford courts will be open for basket
