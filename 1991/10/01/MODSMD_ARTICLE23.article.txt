# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Determination and excellence marked Stan
ford athletics this weekend. The never-say
die spirit of the football team fueled their vic
tory over defending co-national champion,
Colorado. Few should doubt the top-notch
talent of the Cardinal any more.
Excellence and domination pervaded in
women's soccer this weekend. The team
trampled over the University of Puget
Sound, 5-0. Despite competing against an

opponent with a lower level of talent, the
Cardinal did not ease up or get sloppy.
Despite a superior Stanford effort, coach
Berhane Andeberhan said "it was not an
easy game."
The Athletes of the Week, Tommy Vardell
and Julie Foudy, showed incredible determi
nation and excellence this weekend in their
respective contests.
Even after heading to the locker room
during the second quarter with a case of
dehydration, Tommy Vardell did not
throw in the towel. With an IV replenish
ing his body and the roar of the fans above
feeding his spirit, he fought back, just like
the football team was doing against the
Buffaloes.
"I wasn't sharp mentally," said Vardell. "I
didn't think I was in a position to execute my
assignments. I felt better after (the IV), but
when I heard the crowd, I knew I had to get
back in."
He hit the field once again, and scored two
more touchdowns, ensuring a Cardinal victo
ry. Despite his interim illness, the fifth-year
senior finished the game with three TDs and
114 yards rushing on 29 carries. He also
caught four balls for 94 yards.
Sheer domination marked the women's
soccer team's play Sunday afternoon. Foudy,
an All-American candidate in 1990, is possi
bly the best player on the No. 9-ranked team.
Foudy led the Cardinal with two goals and
one assist in their romp over the Loggers.
Her first goal came only 11 minutes into the
game while her second was at the beginning
of the second half of play.

With over 10 games left in the regular sea
son, she has already tied her season total
from last year â€” 12 goals. Foudy also leads
the team in points (a combination of goals
and assists) this season.
As a three-year starter for Stanford, the
junior has played a mnjor role in the team's
recent success. In addition to scoring for the
Cardinal, Foudy also leads the U.S. National
team in international competition.
