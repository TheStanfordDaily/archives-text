# The 						effects of a lack of oxygen on a writer

This column is dedicated to
my friend Bob "the
Mazz" Mazzeo. The Mazz
is a professor at the University
of Colorado, and his primary
claim to fame is that all of the
graduate students who work
under him are attractive
women. That's why he's the
Mazz.
This past summer I worked
on a study with Mazz. Actually,
I was the study, or part of it. I

was a medical
research subject
(read "guinea
pig"). I lived on
the top of Pike's
Peak for about
three and a half
weeks with
other students
from around the
bay area, includ
ing others from

Stanford, being
studied by (among others) the
Mazz.
Mazz, like many Buffalo
fans, was under the rather
amusing illusion that Colorado,
and not Georgia Tech, had won
the collegiate football national
championship last year. And,
like many unfortunate Buffalo
fans, he was confident that this
year Colorado had a far better
team than, for example, Stan
ford.
Mazz got into a bit of trouble
because of this. Mazz bet about
half a dozen of us from Stan
ford a case of Heineken each
that the Buffaloes would beat
the Cardinal. You know what
that means.
We're gonna have a party.
The Mazz is one of those
people who considers
Stanford's victory over
Colorado to be an anomaly.
After all, wasn't Stanford 0-2
with losses to Washington and
Arizona? Shouldn't the victory
be considered the stray datum?
Not in my opinion. In fact,
it's the reverse.
Stanford played sub-par
against its two previous oppo

nents, partially because of key
injuries, and partially for other
reasons. The result was a shel
lacking by a truly great football
team (Washington) and a close
loss to a mediocre team (Ari
zona).
Why shouldn't the Arizona
loss be considered the anomaly?
Washington is clearly a superi
or team to Colorado and defi
nitely belongs where it is
ranked â€” in the stratosphere

with Florida
State and
Miami.
If you
assume that
the Colorado
game was
indicative of
how the Car
dinal can play
and should
play for the

rest of the
season, then it follows that the
Arizona game is the strange
one. And after all, Stanford was
more banged up in that game
than in any of the other three.
But we're just gonna hafla
see what happens during the
rest of the season because all
this cogitating about how good
everyone is and who will win
what is pretty darn useless
when you get right down to it.
Okay, I haven't com
plained about anything
yet. Aren't columnists
supposed to bitch all the time?
So here is my complaint for the
week: where the hell is Ernie
Nevers? The man is widely
regarded as the greatest foot
ball player who ever lived, and
he's not even on those cards
that we got from Togo's! I'd say
that deserves an extraordinari
ly high bogosity quotient.

Tyson Vaughan has written two
columns in his career. The first
was a demonstration of how
sports columns could actually
have purpose. This one is a
demonstration of how they can
be sub-useless.
