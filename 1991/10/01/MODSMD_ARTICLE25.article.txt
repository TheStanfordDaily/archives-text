Way to go, cheerleaders

You are no longer as loud

or annoying as in past

years. Actually, you

blend in rather well,
and may even add

something to gameday atmo
sphere.
Who dat say dey gonna beat
dem Saints? With a rock-solid
defense and a very efficient
offense, this team, who has won
their first five games, could go
marching into the Super Bowl.
The Harry Houdini award goes
to Bobby Bowden of FSU. His
plays are right out of sandlot ball
(OK, you're the bottle cap. . .),
but they work really well.
"That day, all the Sneetches
forgot about stars, and whether
they had one, or not, upon thars."
Dr. Seuss, we miss you already.

Somebody get rid of that guy

with the big red

Stanford flag at
football games.'
Where does he

think he is, Michi
gan?

Both the Niners and Giants
are 2-3. It's about time these
teams experienced some difficul
ty; hopefully they will become a
little more humble.
Darian Hagan, we kick you all
over the field, and you tell the
press that we're not better than
you guys? Read the scoreboard,
bud!
Shame on anyone who doesn't
recycle The Daily. We don't have
enough trees as it is. Remember
the Lorax!
