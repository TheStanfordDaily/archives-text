## 
### Paul Curthoys 
The student group Queerland plans to
demonstrate at Governor Pete Wilson's Cen
tennial Convocation speech today to vent
anger at Wilson's veto of a gay rights bill.
Calls to join the Stanford protest were made
last night in San Francisco at a demonstration
critical of Wilson that was attended by approx-

imately 5,000 people.
According to graduate student Steve Pitts,
Queerland, a direct-action organization composed
of gay, lesbian, bisexual and straight students that
works to make '"queers' more visible," had planned
to stage a strictly non-disruptive demonstration to
urge Wilson to sign Assembly Bill 101, the law
banning job discrimination against homosexuals.
But in the wake of Gov. Wilson's veto yes

terday morning, the group's focus has changed.
Although the group made no set plans for
disrupting the speech, Sairus Patel, a fifth
year senior in the group, qualified official
intentions by saying, "There is no sense in
being non-disruptive now. It will be a good
place to express our rage."
Pitts couldn't estimate the number of
protesters that might arrive today.
