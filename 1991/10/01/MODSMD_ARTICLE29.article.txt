# Diversity panelists disagree

Several panelists clashed with noted
black author Shelby Steele on issues of
race and diversity at a Centennial
roundtable discussion held yesterday.
A packed tent listened on as the eight
invited speakers discussed — and some
times argued — on the ways diversity
can be used as a positive and negative
force in American society.
Steele, who wrote "The Content of
Our Character," a controversial book
about race relations in America,
expressed dislike over what he called a
"politics of difference," in which "vast
common ground is lost" and people con
centrate only on their differences.
He said he sees a large pool of experi
ences, such as eating Big Macs and
desiring to own a home, which most
Americans share — regardless of race —
and which he said can be drawn upon to
bring people together.

"When we too-singularly focus on our
differences . . . then I think we end up
with a very divisive environment," said
Steele.
Ronald Takaki, Professor of Ethnic
Studies at UC-Berkeley, suggested
many of the things Steele called "com
monalities" were superficial.
Richard West, founding director of
the Smithsonian Institution's new
National Museum of the American Indi
an, reacted to Steele's remarks with con
cern. "I worry a little bit," he said,
"because [assimilation] has become the
basic undoing of the Native American in
this country. The only thing that has
sustained Native Americans has been
their culture."
History Prof. Clayborne Carson,
director of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project at Stanford, also said he
was worried about the prospects of
abandoning a "politics of difference" for
one of assimilation. But he said, "We

would like to reach the point where it is
a level playing field for everyone, where
we would have a free choice whether to
assimilate or not."
Steele gave the example of African-
American music as one that combines
the diverse strains of African and Euro
pean music to form what is probably
America's greatest cultural contribution.
Several on the panel argued that the
U.S. educational system is severely lack
ing for people from lower socioeconomic
classes, often minorities, adding that
education is the key to unleashing the
power of diversity.
After many on the panel applauded
diversity, Carson reminded the gather
ing that while it is easy for most people
to accept diversity in a general way, pol
itics and economics can create complica
tions. "When choices about limited
resources are in question, we must ask
what kind of priority do we give" to
diversity, he said.
