# 'Indirect' counseling program criticized

Despite recent reforms in
Stanford's sexual assault re
sponse services, several barriers
— from some unlisted phone
numbers to confusing reporting
procedures — still confront stu
dents wishing to report a rape.
The 6-month-old Cowell Sexu
al Assault Response and Recovery
Team was originally advertised as
a 24-hour emergency on-call ser
vice. But a woman who has been
raped could face the burden of
recounting her experience to as
many as three different people
before reaching an advocate on
the response team.
Since its formation in the
spring, Stanford's ethnically
diverse team of five Counseling
and Psychological Services clini
cians has worked with "at least 12
students," according to CAPS
Director Alejandro Martinez.
The University's quick and thor
ough response to the recent alleged
rape in Casa Zapata "is a very good
indication that the system is work
ing," Martinez said. He said that
despite several concerns students
raised earlier this year about the
team's accessibility and visibility,
"we really are further ahead than
people are recognizing."
Publicity about the team has
been directed mostly at new stu
dents and residence staffs.
Making sure the Cowell team
is "visible and accessible to stu

dents" is one responsibility of
Susan Epstein, the new coordina
tor for sexual assault education
and prevention, who works at the
Cowell Student Health Center.
Epstein coordinated the recent
"About Last Night" sexual assault
awareness programs in several
dormitories as well a New Student
Orientation program on "Sex in
the '90s" and a workshop during
resident assistant training.
All three programs included
references to the new CAPS struc
ture.
Despite these efforts to publi
cize the team's existence, though,
students may still have trouble
contacting a team member in the
event of a sexual assault.
Neither the team nor its direc
tor, Gail Pritchard, is listed with
the University operator.
The answering machine at
Epstein's office — which is listed
— refers students who want to
report an assault to the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis
Center. Epstein would not say
why her message does not refer
students to the Cowell team.
A daytime call by The Daily to
Cowell yielded only a referral to
the answering machine of the
Health Promotions division —
the education and publications
arm of Cowell, which does not
work on sexual assault issues.
When The Daily called CAPS
to ask for the sexual assault team,
