# 'Indirect' counseling program criticized
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
Despite recent reforms in
Stanford's sexual assault re
sponse services, several barriers
— from some unlisted phone
numbers to confusing reporting
procedures — still confront stu
dents wishing to report a rape.
The 6-month-old Cowell Sexu
al Assault Response and Recovery
Team was originally advertised as
a 24-hour emergency on-call ser
vice. But a woman who has been
raped could face the burden of
recounting her experience to as
many as three different people
before reaching an advocate on
the response team.
Since its formation in the
spring, Stanford's ethnically
diverse team of five Counseling
and Psychological Services clini
cians has worked with "at least 12
students," according to CAPS
Director Alejandro Martinez.
The University's quick and thor
ough response to the recent alleged
rape in Casa Zapata "is a very good
indication that the system is work
ing," Martinez said. He said that
despite several concerns students
raised earlier this year about the
team's accessibility and visibility,
"we really are further ahead than
people are recognizing."
Publicity about the team has
been directed mostly at new stu
dents and residence staffs.
Making sure the Cowell team
is "visible and accessible to stu

dents" is one responsibility of
Susan Epstein, the new coordina
tor for sexual assault education
and prevention, who works at the
Cowell Student Health Center.
Epstein coordinated the recent
"About Last Night" sexual assault
awareness programs in several
dormitories as well a New Student
Orientation program on "Sex in
the '90s" and a workshop during
resident assistant training.
All three programs included
references to the new CAPS struc
ture.
Despite these efforts to publi
cize the team's existence, though,
students may still have trouble
contacting a team member in the
event of a sexual assault.
Neither the team nor its direc
tor, Gail Pritchard, is listed with
the University operator.
The answering machine at
Epstein's office — which is listed
— refers students who want to
report an assault to the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis
Center. Epstein would not say
why her message does not refer
students to the Cowell team.
A daytime call by The Daily to
Cowell yielded only a referral to
the answering machine of the
Health Promotions division —
the education and publications
arm of Cowell, which does not
work on sexual assault issues.
When The Daily called CAPS
to ask for the sexual assault team,
the CAPS receptionist gave
Epstein's number. On another day,
however, another receptionist
transferred the call to response
team member Celia Moreno.
Students calling after business
hours encounter an even more
complicated procedure.
Between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m., a
student can reach a Cowell nurse
practitioner by calling 723-4861.
The nurse takes the student's
name and phone number and pages
the CAPS clinician on call. The clin
ician should respond within 20
minutes, Moreno said.
After 11 p.m., students calling
Cowell reach the Stanford Page
Operator. Since the on-call CAPS
staff person is usually at home by
this time, a call could be connected
directly. Otherwise, the operator
takes the student's name and num
ber and pages the on-call CAPS
counselor, Martinez said.
In either case, the counselor
would talk to the student and then

determine whether to call a
response team member at home.
Because team members also
serve as regular on-call crisis coun
selors for the CAPS line, a student
wishing to report an assault might
reach a team member immediately.
But team members are not
always on call. At certain times, the
on-call CAPS clinician might be
unable to reach a team member —
despite the team's billing as a 24-
hour emergency service.
Martinez said these factors do not
indicate that the team is inaccessible.
"You have to remember that all
CAPS clinicians are also able to pro
vide crisis intervention," he said,
adding that clinicians might also
refer students to the YWCA Rape
Crisis Center hotline.
The Cowell team "is not only for
response but also for recovery,"
Martinez said. "Calls such as the
one in the Zapata instance — a stu
dent reporting an incident that just
happened — are very infrequent.
Usually there is a time delay."
While all CAPS staff members
can work with students in crisis,
team members are also educated
about specific legal and medical

resources and can work with differ
ent offices of the University, Mar
tinez said.
The team members provide con
tinuity, he slid, so that a student
does not have to re-explain the
assault to several different people
in the University.
But some feel that even talking
to two or three people — such as a
nurse, a CAPS counselor and then
a team member — could discourage
students who report assaults.
Martinez defended the team's
method of taking a student's name and
number, despite the lade of anonymity
for the student, saying that "the
YWCA also uses a paging system."
But a representative from the
YWCA said that only in exceptional
cases does her hotline page advo
cates who then return calls.
"Usually the advocate either has
a direct line or stays very near a
phone, so that callers only hold for
a couple of minutes before talking
to an advocate," she said. "Of
course, if the advocate is stuck in
traffic on the way home from work
or something, we might have to
take the caller's name and number,
or ask the caller to call back."

CAPS clinicians are also able to pro
vide crisis intervention," he said,
adding that clinicians might also
refer students to the YWCA Rape
Crisis Center hotline.
The Cowell team "is not only for
response but also for recovery,"
Martinez said. "Calls such as the
one in the Zapata instance — a stu
dent reporting an incident that just
happened — are very infrequent.
Usually there is a time delay."
While all CAPS staff members
can work with students in crisis,
team members are also educated
about specific legal and medical

resources and can work with differ
ent offices of the University, Mar
tinez said.
The team members provide con
tinuity, he slid, so that a student
does not have to re-explain the
assault to several different people
in the University.
But some feel that even talking
to two or three people — such as a
nurse, a CAPS counselor and then
a team member — could discourage
students who report assaults.
Martinez defended the team's
method of taking a student's name and
number, despite the lade of anonymity
for the student, saying that "the
YWCA also uses a paging system."
But a representative from the
YWCA said that only in exceptional
cases does her hotline page advo
cates who then return calls.
"Usually the advocate either has
a direct line or stays very near a
phone, so that callers only hold for
a couple of minutes before talking
to an advocate," she said. "Of
course, if the advocate is stuck in
traffic on the way home from work
or something, we might have to
take the caller's name and number,
or ask the caller to call back."
Despite recent reforms in
Stanford's sexual assault re
sponse services, several barriers
— from some unlisted phone
numbers to confusing reporting
procedures — still confront stu
dents wishing to report a rape.
The 6-month-old Cowell Sexu
al Assault Response and Recovery
Team was originally advertised as
a 24-hour emergency on-call ser
vice. But a woman who has been
raped could face the burden of
recounting her experience to as
many as three different people
before reaching an advocate on
the response team.
Since its formation in the
spring, Stanford's ethnically
diverse team of five Counseling
and Psychological Services clini
cians has worked with "at least 12
students," according to CAPS
Director Alejandro Martinez.
The University's quick and thor
ough response to the recent alleged
rape in Casa Zapata "is a very good
indication that the system is work
ing," Martinez said. He said that
despite several concerns students
raised earlier this year about the
team's accessibility and visibility,
"we really are further ahead than
people are recognizing."
Publicity about the team has
been directed mostly at new stu
dents and residence staffs.
Making sure the Cowell team
is "visible and accessible to stu

dents" is one responsibility of
Susan Epstein, the new coordina
tor for sexual assault education
and prevention, who works at the
Cowell Student Health Center.
Epstein coordinated the recent
"About Last Night" sexual assault
awareness programs in several
dormitories as well a New Student
Orientation program on "Sex in
the '90s" and a workshop during
resident assistant training.
All three programs included
references to the new CAPS struc
ture.
Despite these efforts to publi
cize the team's existence, though,
students may still have trouble
contacting a team member in the
event of a sexual assault.
Neither the team nor its direc
tor, Gail Pritchard, is listed with
the University operator.
The answering machine at
Epstein's office — which is listed
— refers students who want to
report an assault to the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis
Center. Epstein would not say
why her message does not refer
students to the Cowell team.
A daytime call by The Daily to
Cowell yielded only a referral to
the answering machine of the
Health Promotions division —
the education and publications
arm of Cowell, which does not
work on sexual assault issues.
When The Daily called CAPS
to ask for the sexual assault team,
the CAPS receptionist gave
Epstein's number. On another day,
however, another receptionist
transferred the call to response
team member Celia Moreno.
Students calling after business
hours encounter an even more
complicated procedure.
Between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m., a
student can reach a Cowell nurse
practitioner by calling 723-4861.
The nurse takes the student's
name and phone number and pages
the CAPS clinician on call. The clin
ician should respond within 20
minutes, Moreno said.
After 11 p.m., students calling
Cowell reach the Stanford Page
Operator. Since the on-call CAPS
staff person is usually at home by
this time, a call could be connected
directly. Otherwise, the operator
takes the student's name and num
ber and pages the on-call CAPS
counselor, Martinez said.
In either case, the counselor
would talk to the student and then

determine whether to call a
response team member at home.
Because team members also
serve as regular on-call crisis coun
selors for the CAPS line, a student
wishing to report an assault might
reach a team member immediately.
But team members are not
always on call. At certain times, the
on-call CAPS clinician might be
unable to reach a team member —
despite the team's billing as a 24-
hour emergency service.
Martinez said these factors do not
indicate that the team is inaccessible.
"You have to remember that all
CAPS clinicians are also able to pro
vide crisis intervention," he said,
adding that clinicians might also
refer students to the YWCA Rape
Crisis Center hotline.
The Cowell team "is not only for
response but also for recovery,"
