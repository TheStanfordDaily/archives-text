# Panel paints picture of art

Everything from how artists find fund
ing to how their art can become "social
architecture" was discussed at a well
attended Centennial roundtable yesterday
morning.
Eight artists and critics involved in a
wide variety of media experienced the Ted
Koppel treatment as the Stanford graduate
facilitated discussion like he does on
"Nightline."
In addition to various abstract state
ments on the general nature of art and its
effects on its audience, the participants
brought many concrete — and sometimes
amusing — insights into the changing role
of the arts in light of political, cultural and
economic trends.
The panelists in the roundtable "The
Arts: A Catalyst for Social Change?" spoke
of two main areas in which art plays a role
— the individual and the community.
Stephen E. Weil, deputy director of the
Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden, emphasized the individ
ual arena when he portrayed the arts as a
means for expanding people's sensibilities
and awareness of the external world.
Amalia Mesa-Bains, who is currently serv
ing as San Francisco's Commissioner of Arts,
emphasized art's power on a larger scale,
specifically its ability to affirm and strength
en a community's image of itself as a form of

what she called "social architecture."
One focus of the discussion was the
changing sources of support for artists.
When asked where he gets his funding
these days, American filmmaker Peter Sell
ars quipped, "Germany and Japan." Sever
al of the panelists said a decrease in gov
ernment funding was leading many Ameri
can artists to seek a more "grassroots" level
of support.
Sellars portrayed this trend as a blessing
in disguise — a means for the artist to
escape from a financial dependence on the
whims of political or corporate interests.
But Mesa-Bains and Robert Townshend,
director of the 1987 comedy "Hollywood
Shuffle," both stressed the necessary role
of government funding for artists from eco
nomically disadvantaged groups. "Certain
voices are not being heard", said Town
shend, citing the stereotypical portrayal of
blacks in mainstream American cinema.
For instance, until a broad-based mid
dle-class predominates in the Chicano com
munity, Mesa-Bains said, that community
will be subjected to a form of "pre-censor
ship" by the American mainstream.
Despite mediator Ted Koppel's opti
mistic assessment of the video-technology
induced "democratization" of the media,
many participants said they were more
skeptical about the realization of a more
diverse spectrum of cultural expression in
mainstream American culture.
