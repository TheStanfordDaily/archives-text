# Stanford celebrates a spectacular 100!
## 
### 
The star-studded Stanford
Centennial Stadium Spectacu
lar was just that — spectacular.
More than 30,000 alumni,
faculty, students and mem
bers of the community packed
into half of Stanford Stadium
last night to watch celebrities
perform and recount the Uni
versity's early history.
"This is the last night of the
first 100 years of Stanford histo
ry," said co-host Ted Koppel to
open the evening. "Stanford is
today — by any measure — one
of the world's great universities."
Performances by Bobby
McFerrin, the Doobie Brothers,
Michael Feinstein, James Gal
way, Joan Baez and Hiroshima
highlighted the evening.
And the Stanford connection
was not left out of the big birth
day bash — from the co-host
alumni Koppel and Anna Chavez
to the chorus of a cappella
groups and the Stanford Band.
The crowd saved its loudest
and longest ovation to recog
nize outgoing University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy.
And the conclusion of the
Centennial Celebration — the
Stanford Band's trademark
"All Right Now" combined with
a fantastic fireworks display —
left the crowd on its feet.
"It was pleasing to see all of
the Stanford alumni up there,"
said one Stanford graduate.
"Despite the controversy sur
rounding the University, it
was really wonderful."
