# Many rapes not reported
## Alleged assault at Zapata only 11th reported since 1980 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
When a female student reported that she had
been raped last Sunday night in Casa Zapata, she
was at odds with the statistics.
The alleged rape in Zapata was the first reported
to Stanford Police this year and only the 11th
reported to the police since 1980, Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington said.
But a 1989 survey by the Stanford Rape Educa
tion Project found that one in four female under
graduates at Stanford have been coerced or forced
into having sex when they did not want to. Only two
percent of those cases were reported to the police.
Those facts put the continuing police investiga
tion of the alleged rape into perspective: If all rape
cases here were reported, the police would be inves
tigating them year-round.
The investigation of the alleged rape in Zapata is
proceeding slowly. Herrington said the Santa Clara
County district attorney had not finished reviewing
the case yesterday.
The district attorney must approve cases before
an arrest warrant can be issued â€” a process that
Herrington said may take several days because the
district attorney's office is "a huge bureaucracy."
The alleged rape occurred in a student room in

Zapata last Sunday night. Herrington said the police
received a call from the woman, a student, shortly
before noon last Monday. They have been investi
gating the case since then.
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga said the
incident involved an individual male Zapata resi
dent. Ninety-eight people live in Zapata.
It was statistically unlikely that the woman
would report the alleged rape or even tell anyone
about it.
The Rape Education Project survey estimated
that only 17 percent of women who had been raped
told anyone about the incident and only one in 25
sought counseling or therapy.
Sally Baird, client services program director at
the Mid-Peninsula Rape Crisis Center, said those
statistics are probably accurate. "Most rapes are not
reported," she said.
One of the main reasons, Baird said, is that many
of the women who are assaulted know their
assailant and are reluctant to accuse him of rape.
"There is a false conception that date rape is not
really a crime," Baird said. "The conception is that
it's not really rape, it's something else."
Baird said other reasons women may be hesitant
to report a rape include the stigma involving sexual
