# Haitian rebels arrest first elected president

### 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Pres
ident Jean-Bertrand Aristide was arrested
yesterday afternoon by rebel soldiers at the
National Palace, the foreign minister said.
"The president and his staff have been
arrested and taken to the army headquar
ters," said the foreign minister, Jean-
Robert Sabalat. He told The Associated
Press the government was negotiating "to
at least save the president's life."
The arrest of Aristide, who became
Haiti's first freely elected president in
February, capped a harrowing uprising
that claimed at least 26 lives and began
with mutinies Sunday night at a training
camp and a police station in the capital
area.
Sabalat said a loyal captain was killed
when the rebels, who claimed Aristide had
interfered in internal army affairs, battled
their way into the National Palace about
5:30 p.m.
The uprising occurred only four days
after Aristide addressed the United
Nations on his first trip to the United
States since becoming president of this
coup-prone Caribbean nation.
Aristide said Thursday that his address
to the U.N. General Assembly the day
before had marked the end of Haiti's dark
past of dictatorship.
"Democracy has won out for good, the
roots are growing stronger and stronger,"
he said in an interview.
Earlier in the day, the rebel soldiers had
opened fire on Aristide's home, and several
hours later attacked a military convoy that
was taking him and the French ambas
sador to the National Palace. Neither Aris
tide nor the ambassador, Jean-Rafael
Dufour, was injured in either episode,
according to government sources.
By nightfall Monday, a presidential

adviser, overheard on a radio frequency
used by the military, government and
embassies, spoke of loyalist soldiers desert
ing and hostile units moving onto the
grounds of the National Palace.
A government minister, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said, "We're in
serious trouble."
Only one of Haiti's 15 or so radio sta
tions, Roman Catholic-run Radio Soleil,
continued to broadcast news. Some shut
down after being strafed by gunfire, and
others switched to music-only formats.
State television broadcast test patterns.
The international airport was closed
yesterday afternoon.
Aristide, a 38-year-old Catholic priest in
power since February, had been at home
with aides and a bodyguard at the time of
the first attack, the government said.
Independent Radio Cacique said an
armored personnel carrier was attacked
when it went to Aristide's home to take
him to the National Palace from his resi
dence in La Plaine, six miles from Port-au-
Prince.
The trouble began Sunday night with
mutinies at an army training camp at
Freres, just outside Port-au-Prince, and at
an army-run police station in the down
town area of the capital.
Shortly before midnight Sunday, the
head of Radio Nationale, Michel Favard,
went on the air to say a government source
told him a coup was believed underway.
Favard is a longtime Aristide aide.
Minutes later, six soldiers burst into the
station, handcuffed Favard and took him
away, sources at the radio station said.
The U.S. Embassy in a statement con
demned the "outrageous attack against
President Aristide by a mutinous sector of
the army."
