We've spent years with
students like you and edu
cators like your professors to
develop the TI-68 and the
TI-81. That's why they're so
highly recommended.
For engineering students,
The TI-68 solves up to five
simultaneous equations,
provides complex number
functions and offers formula
programming. That's power.
And for math and science
applications, the
TI-81 offers the
most compre
hensive, yet easy
to-use graphing
functions with ex
tensive program
ming capabilities.
Try a TI-68 or
TI-81 at your local
TI retailer today.
And start working
smarter, instead
of harder.
