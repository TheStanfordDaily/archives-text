quality of the people and the challenge of
the environmental work. As co-workers we
feel a lot of mutual respect for one another
and a strong kinship. / really tiki tin idea
that each Radian employee is responsible
for charting his or her own course when it
comes to project work and opportunities for
admncement. You can go as far as you
want to. I'm 25 and have only been with
the company for two years, but I 'm already
a group leader.
