You'll never find a more compatible
roommate than an IBM Personal System
Academic Bundle. It's friendly, helpful, quiet,
neat, and not above having a little fun! (Yet it
won't blast the stereo or borrow your class
notes!) What's more, it was specifically
designed with the needs of college in mind. Its
mouse and Windows make it incredibly easy to
learn and use, not only in college, but after
graduation. Best of all, it's an IBM,which means
quality, reliability, and service.

For example, the Writer's bundles in
clude everything the academic computer user
needs for word processing in today's challeng
ing academic environment. They include a top
Bundles
rated word processing program, Microsoft Word
for Windows, with outlining, spell checking,
thesaurus, and desktop publishing features. You
can even check your grammar and style from
within your document with the help of
Grammatik reference software, which is
integrated into Word for Windows for quick and
easy accessibility.
And if that isn't enough, the Writer's
Bundles also include software that allows users
to cut and paste special symbols, mathematical
formulas, and even foreign languages into your
document. Word processing has never been
easier!
College Costs soar.
But not PS/2 prices.
You may be surprised at just
how affordable a PS/2 is. Especially with
the special low prices we're now offering
students, faculty and staff. What's more, you
don't have to pay for it all at once. The PS/2 Loan
for Learning lets you borrow anywhere from
$1,500 to $8000 - with flexible terms and low
interest rates. Payments start as low as $30* a
month: about the price of a daily cup of coffee.
