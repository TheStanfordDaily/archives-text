WORK SMARTER
NOT HARDER.
We're working smarter,
too. So you don't have
to work harder.

tific that solves up to five simulta
neous equations, performs complex
numbers and offers formula
programming.

needed to help them make math
concepts come alive.
It means continually working
with students like you, discovering
firsthand what you expect from the
calculator you select.
The result? Calculators that are
highly recommended by your
teachers and peers. Calculators
that are perfectly matched to your
major and your coursework.
The TI-81 is a perfect example.
It offers the most comprehensive,
easy-to-use graphing features
available with extensive pro
gramming capabilities.
And there are others.
The TI-36X SOLAR, a general
purpose workhorse powered by
ANY LITE™ solar cells so you
never need batteries.
The BAII PLUS™ For business
students, this is the one to get.
It handles time-value-of-money and
offers cash flow analysis for internal
rate of return (IRR) and net present
value (NPV).
*
Plus a whole lot more.
No matter what your major, no
matter what the course, there's a
TI scientific or business calculator
that's right for you. Do the smart
thing: make one of them a part
of your professional personality
now, and for the years to come.
You'll be on your way to work
ing smarter. Instead of harder.
