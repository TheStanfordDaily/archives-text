# Police plans worked well, officials say

The University is crediting
last-minute security changes and
police discretion with averting
protester violence during yester
day's Centennial Convocation in
the Quad.
But authorities say nearly 300
emotionally charged demonstra
tors almost turned the closing cel
ebration into a "nasty situation."
The throng, shouting "Shame!
Shame!" and thrusting fists into
the air, was disgruntled with Gov.
Pete Wilson's veto Sunday of leg
islation to increase protection for
gays and lesbians against job dis
crimination.
"After emotional demonstra
tions in San Francisco on Monday
it didn't take a rocket scientist to
figure out that the protesters
would hit Stanford next," said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Centennial planners had en
listed police from Stanford, Palo
Alto and the Santa Clara County
SherifFs office as part of planned
security procedures. When word
of the San Francisco demonstra
tions reached Stanford officials,
event planners asked that the Los
Altos police and the California
Highway Patrol be placed on alert.
More than 60 law enforcement
ofFicials lined the periphery and
interior of the Quad yesterday to
try to stave off disruptions by
members of gay and lesbian activist
groups.
Police said the demonstrators
were members of Act Up and
Queer Nation, two national
activist groups; Lavender Green,
an ecological gay and lesbian
issues group based in San Fran
cisco; and Queerland, a campus
based activist organization.
As an additional precaution,
police erected a steel barricade
around the perimeter of the Quad
and extended a mesh fence with
barbed wire behind the west por
tal of the Quad. Protesters pushed
the fence over at one point during
the demonstration.
Although the closing ceremo
ny began without major incident,
bursts of heckling and ear-pierc
ing whistles cut through the air.
Wilson's approach to the podium
was met with a deafening
crescendo, and protesters surged
through the audience toward the
podium.
