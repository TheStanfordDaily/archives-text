# Police plans worked well, officials say

The University is crediting
last-minute security changes and
police discretion with averting
protester violence during yester
day's Centennial Convocation in
the Quad.
But authorities say nearly 300
emotionally charged demonstra
tors almost turned the closing cel
ebration into a "nasty situation."
The throng, shouting "Shame!
Shame!" and thrusting fists into
the air, was disgruntled with Gov.
Pete Wilson's veto Sunday of leg
islation to increase protection for
gays and lesbians against job dis
crimination.
"After emotional demonstra
tions in San Francisco on Monday
it didn't take a rocket scientist to
figure out that the protesters
would hit Stanford next," said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Centennial planners had en
listed police from Stanford, Palo
Alto and the Santa Clara County
SherifFs office as part of planned
security procedures. When word
of the San Francisco demonstra
tions reached Stanford officials,
event planners asked that the Los
Altos police and the California
Highway Patrol be placed on alert.
More than 60 law enforcement
ofFicials lined the periphery and
interior of the Quad yesterday to
try to stave off disruptions by
members of gay and lesbian activist
groups.
Police said the demonstrators
were members of Act Up and
Queer Nation, two national
activist groups; Lavender Green,
an ecological gay and lesbian
issues group based in San Fran
cisco; and Queerland, a campus
based activist organization.
As an additional precaution,
police erected a steel barricade
around the perimeter of the Quad
and extended a mesh fence with
barbed wire behind the west por
tal of the Quad. Protesters pushed
the fence over at one point during
the demonstration.
Although the closing ceremo
ny began without major incident,
bursts of heckling and ear-pierc
ing whistles cut through the air.
Wilson's approach to the podium
was met with a deafening
crescendo, and protesters surged
through the audience toward the
podium.
Niemeyer said he had never
seen such an angry group of peo
ple in an open forum protest in
the past two decades. "They were
extremely aggressive," he said.
He added that in a situation
like yesterday's the worst thing
police can do is feed aggression
with more aggression. Law
enforcement authorities were
clad in riot gear, including hel
mets and thick jackets, and car
ried batons. They were told to
assume a defensive posture.
The police formed a three-deep
arc that created a 20-foot buffer
zone between the protesters and
Wilson, who was the target of
fruit, eggs and wadded-up pieces
of paper thrown by the protesters.
At the conclusion of the gover
nor's speech, the protesters
retreated out of the Quad.
Observers, including Lois Wagn
er, a key organizer of the Centen
nial Celebration, said the police
tactics defused the situation.
"The local and University law
enforcement officials were well in

control and didn't let the
protesters win," Wagner said.
Frank Wisner, a spokesperson
for the Republican governor, said,
"We'd been preparing for more
protesters — in the thousands —
but as it turned out, there were
less, and the situation was han
dled really well."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said if the protesters
had launched an attack on the
governor, police tactics would
have changed. "But they
stopped," he said.
After leaving the Quad, the
demonstrators spread out in a
grassy area between the west por
tal of the Quad and Serra Street,
where they shook the fence barri
er and confronted police. Police
kept protesters at bay with a large
German shepherd.
According to some protesters,
police used unnecessary violence
in some cases. Eleanor Feingold, a
doctorate student in statistics and
co-coordinator of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, said verbal reports were
circulating in the gay and lesbian
community that police had
allegedly beaten a man with a
baton and were spraying Mace

through the fence at protesters
who had not provoked them.
Herrington said he had not
heard any reports of injury to
demonstrators or of abuse of
police force.
Tensions between the police
and protesters reached their peak
when demonstrators amassed
behind the west Quad and
attempted to block Wilson's con
voy. Another car in the convoy
carried Dr. Louis Sullivan, secre
tary of health and human ser
vices, and University President
Donald Kennedy.
Law enforcement officials
employed several decoy vehicles
that distracted protesters by
approaching an exit in the fence
nearly opposite the physics building.
Then the convoy of blue sedans
containing the dignitaries made a
sharp right turn out of the Outer
Quad arch and bulleted through a
side exit. Some ran after the cars
and threw cups of water, soda
cans and stones. The protesters
were quickly followed by police
who proceeded to restrain them.
Stanford Police plan to review
videotapes taken of the protests
to see if anyone should be charged
with a crime.

Protest organizers said the estimated 300 demonstrators came from Stanford, San Francisco and other
California cities.
