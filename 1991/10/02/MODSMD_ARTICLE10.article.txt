San Jose killer found guilty
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — A man who killed
seven people during an office rampage blamed
on unrequited love was convicted yesterday of
first-degree murder and could face the death
penalty.
Relatives of Richard Farley's victims said
they hoped he would be sent to the gas chamber.
"The death penalty is absolutely what I want
to see," said Bob Silva, who drove 100 miles
from Dixon nearly every day to attend the trial
of the man who killed his brother, Joe Silva.
"He should die."
After six days of deliberation and nearly
three months at trial, the jury convicted Farley
of seven counts of first-degree murder, five
counts of attempted murder and one count each
of second-degree burglary, felony vandalism and
assault with a deadly weapon.
The assault charge was for shooting Laura
Black, a former co-worker at ESL Inc. who was
the object of Farley's 3%-year love obsession.
U.S. policy toward Cuba criticized
MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Soviet ambas
sador to Mexico says that because of changes in
his own country, "the Cubans should defend
their own fate," but he criticized the U.S.
embargo of the communist island state, the gov
ernment daily El Nacional reported yesterday.
"The important thing is that there should
not be threats or impositions (on Cuba) because
that would sharpen the situation," Ambassador
Oleg Darusenkov was quoted as saying.
The ambassador said that a majority of
Cubans still support President Fidel Castro,
"and it would be difficult to have changes in the
future, save something catastrophic."
More poor teens getting AIDS
CHICAGO (AP) — Researchers said yester
day they are surprised and alarmed by a sharp
increase in AIDS infections among poor U.S.
teen-agers.
Two studies, one nationwide and the other in
Washington, D.C., show a dramatic rise in infec
tions with HIV, the AIDS virus, during the past
year or two.
"What we had feared is indeed true," said Dr.
Lawrence G. D'Angelo of Children's Hospital in
Washington."The Washington, D.C., area is
probably a harbinger of what we will see in
other areas."
D'Angelo and colleagues tested blood sam
ples drawn anonymously from 11,000 adoles
cents treated in the hospital's emergency room.
In 1987, 0.4 percent were infected. That has
now risen to 1.3 percent.
A separate review by Dr. George A. Conway
of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta analyzed HIV tests conducted on
169,000 Job Corps recruits and found that in
1988, 0.21 percent of females nationwide and
0.36 of males were infected.
By 1990, the female infection rate had dou
bled to 0.41 percent, while the male rate had
declined somewhat to 0.27.
Nazi war criminal cremated
LYON, France (AP) — The body of Nazi war
criminal Klaus Barbie was cremated over the
weekend, reliable sources said yesterday. They
said his daughter took the ashes to her home in
Austria.
Barbie, known as the "Butcher of Lyon" for
his brutality as Gestapo chief in Lyon during
World War 11, died Wednesday of leukemia at a
prison hospital where he was serving a life sen
tence. He was 77.
Barbie was convicted in 1987 in one of the
last major trials stemming from the war.
