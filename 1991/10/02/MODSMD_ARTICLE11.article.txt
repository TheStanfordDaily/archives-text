PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
The military clamped down on the
Haitian capital Tuesday, and the lead
er of the coup that toppled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide claimed it was
necessary to stop an "apprentice dicta
tor."
Reports indicated more than 100
people died in Monday's revolt, led by
Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras, once an
Aristide loyalist.
Aristide sent impassioned appeals
from exile to his countrymen, warning
of an impending bloodbath. He plead
ed for an armed U.N. force to restore
democracy in his homeland, saying
from Caracas, Venezuela, that
Haitians "cannot resist the military
alone."
But Haiti's U.N. ambassador, Fritz
Longchamp, said Haiti was not actual
ly calling for armed intervention, only
that the world condemn the coup and
support Aristide, the former parish
priest who came to power in February.
The coup leader, Cedras, said he was
forced to oust Aristide because of fla
grant cronyism, abuses of the military
and judicial system and attempts to
establish a private militia along the lines
of the Tonton Macoutes, which enforced
the Duvalier family dictatorship for
more than two decades until 1986.
"There was a deliberate choice not
to respect democratic norms," Cedras
said in his 15-minute televised speech
Tuesday night. "The situation threat
ened the country's democratic future;
the familiar nightmare of a dictator
regulating all national institutions
made us fear the worst."
Cedras spoke in French and then
Creole. He was seated at a bare desk in
the corner of a room, in front of empty
bookshelves. While on Monday night he
had spoken of creating a "serene cli
mate favorable to the next election," he
made no mention of elections Tuesday.
Cedras spoke of the need to "liber
ate the country from apprentice dicta

tors for good," and promised to
respect the constitution and guarantee
the existence of all political parties.
But the military remained in full
force Tuesday, imposing a 6 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew.
Gunfire reverberated throughout
the capital, with soldiers firing menac
ingly into the air in what amounted to
a daytime curfew as well.
Port-au-Pfince's normally bustling
downtown area was nearly deserted.
There were unconfirmed reports
the National Penitentiary had been
emptied of all 1,000 prisoners, includ
ing Roger LaFontant, a former head of
outlawed Tonton Macoutes.
Another report was that LaFontant
— jailed after leading a coup before
Aristide's inauguration — had been
killed Monday.
Haitians reported that several for
mer Tonton Macoutes imprisoned at
the Penitentiary were seen walking
city streets Tuesday.
There was little sign of resistance to
the coup. Small groups huddled in the
streets talking, and occasionally some
scampered out to rebuild barricades of
burning tires.
Aristide, the first democratically
elected president in Haiti's nearly two
centuries as a nation, was with his fami
ly Tuesday in Caracas, after Venezuela's
president sent a Lear jet to rescue him
and lead him to safety abroad.
He was to travel to Washington on
Wednesday for a meeting of the
Organization of American States,
according to Haiti's U.N. ambassador,
Fritz Longchamp.
President Bush met Tuesday with
Haitian ambassador Jean Casimir,
suspended the $85 million U.S. aid
program for Haiti and called for "an
immediate halt to violence and the
restoration of democracy."
France and Canada also halted aid
programs.
In Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, the

toll from the uprising rose sharply.
The Caribbean Human Rights
Network, based in Barbados, said pre
liminary counts indicated more than
100 dead. Frantz LaMothe, a photog
rapher who visited the General
Hospital morgue in central Port-au
au-Prince, said authorities reported
140 bodies at that facility alone.

"The military is in full control,"
LaMothe said. "They are driving all
over town, 15 to 20 in pickup trucks."
Richard Morse, manager of the
Olaffson Hotel on a hill overlooking
the Port-au-Prince harbor, said "most
of the shooting today is in the air.
Yesterday they were shooting at peo
ple."
