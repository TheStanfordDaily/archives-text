# Thomas likely to be confirmed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate confirmation of
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas grew more
likely yesterday when Richard Shelby of Alabama became
the 10th Democrat to declare he would vote for him.
That means Thomas appears to have at least the
minimum support necessary to survive a floor fight,
even if three pro-choice Republicans should break
ranks from the 43-member GOP minority, as his
opponents hope.
And with at least two more Democrats said to be
leaning his way, Thomas could have some room for
comfort as the showdown, now expected next week,
approaches. Even if the Senate were deadlocked at 50-
50, Thomas would win on the tie-breaking vote of Vice
President Dan Quayle.
Thomas, a conservative federal appeals judge and a
black born into poverty in the segregated South,
"brings a unique perspective .. . that would better
enable the Supreme Court to ensure that the rights
and freedoms of all Americans are preserved and
strengthened," Shelby said.
The Senate is not likely to begin debate before
Friday, so a vote on confirmation is not expected until
the middle of next week, after Monday's start of the
Supreme Court's next term.
If confirmed, Thomas would be the first Supreme
Court nominee to win approval without the endorse
ment of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
arrived at a 7-7 deadlock on Thomas last week but
nonetheless sent the nomination to the floor.
The seven Democrats who voted against Thomas
expressed doubts about his legal qualifications and
whether he was candid when he said he had an open
mind about abortion and other controversial issues.
