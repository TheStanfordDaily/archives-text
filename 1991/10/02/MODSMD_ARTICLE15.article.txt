Active participation in
student town meetings
a must for budget cuts

STANFORD'S STUDENT BODY
very rarely feels the need to
organize. The coming weeks
will result in some very difficult
times for the University as a whole
if students do not become con
cerned with its future. Events are
now happening that will perma
nently reshape every student's
experience here.
The most important qualities
that students and faculty must
presently have are communication
and activism. Without both of
these, the administration will find
it quite easy to implement multi
lateral changes without students'
knowledge.
So far, the student body has
been kept in the dark about what
occurred this summer. The
administration has grown used to
student complacency. If the
administration makes a decision
without disseminating its con
tents, students are likely simply
to accept it.

The impending budget cuts
have caused many students and
faculty to scramble about, unsure
of their own feelings, but certain
they don't want to be left out of
important decisions. Unfortunate
ly, many more students seem will
ing to sit around and let the roof
cave in on top of them.
Already, a board of faculty mem
bers has formed to give a broad
vision of the kinds of cuts that it
feels would be appropriate. This
board is only partially representa
tive of the entire faculty. Non
board members will have a chance
to speak on the budget-cut recom
mendations at an upcoming facul
ty forum and town meeting.
At the same time, a student
town meeting on budget-cut rec
ommendations will be held. After
ward, the ASSU Senate and Coun

cil of Presidents will set some
guidelines and recommendations
about the budget cuts and hold
another student town meeting to
test those recommendations.
Unfortunately, the student and
faculty meetings have been sched
uled so that one starts just an hour
after the other. With both meet
ings going on simultaneously, com
munication between students and
faculty will be virtually nonexis
tent. Valuable ideas will not be
shared. It is crucial that this be
realized, and that something be
done to provide both students and
faculty with information on what
is being determined.
The faculty will most likely be
fractured in their deliberations.
The age-old problems of money
making departments, such as engi
neering, pitted against money-los
ing departments, like those in the
humanities, will arise once more
and almost certainly result in a
fragmented faculty.
The student body must not be
plagued by this kind of splinter
ing. To split off into several com
peting groups would only achieve
disaster for all students. Compro
mise must be embraced as a
method of bringing different ideas
closer together.
But no valid compromises can
be made without full participation
of the student body. Whatever
form of cuts students choose to
stand behind, consensus will be
necessary. Students' only strength
at the administrative level will be
that of numbers. If the student
body cannot decide what would be
best for itself, the administration
will undoubtedly decide for it.
Petty bickering and apathy are
never appropriate in student poli
tics. At this particular time in
Stanford's history, they would be
devastating. The student body
must unify behind a clear and fair
idea of how it views the adminis
tration's role in budget cutting.
Students and faculty must com
municate their ideas to each other
in a coherent and organized man
ner.
