## Council of Presidents COP sets forth battle plan for upcoming budget cuts 
### 
COMPUTERS OR KRAKOW? Library
hours or Residential Education?
Bechtel International Center or
laser printing?
These are just a few of the questions
the University may be forced to answer in
the upcoming budget cuts. So far, stu
dents have largely been content to sit
back and watch the faculty, trustees and
administration chart a course for Stan
ford through this difficult period. Last
year, almost $20 million of "reposition
ing" cuts were made with little or no stu
dent consultation.
Now, with only two weeks left until the
University Cabinet releases target amounts
for cuts twice as large as last time, only
two students have had a hand in the pro
cess. All of our educations are at stake.
Entire departments are in jeopardy. Pre
liminary faculty recommendations call
for eliminating seven overseas pro
grams.
No one is more able to speak for stu
dent needs and student desires than stu
dents themselves. For this reason, it is of
paramount importance that this year stu
dent voices are heard.
Student discussions present the oppor
tunity to bring new approaches to improv
ing life at Stanford. A wide variety of Uni
versity problems require creative solu

tions weighing competing interests. For
example, how much can Stanford afford
to cut residence staffing in dormitories?
How can housed fraternities or sororities
exist without an adviser? Stanford stu
dents think about these types of problem
every day. They are exactly the expert
consultants Stanford needs.
We must not kid ourselves; Stanford
will never be a democracy where students
have an equal say. University decision
makers often do not understand student
priorities.
What they do understand is that, in
order to maintain its prominence, Stan
ford must maintain a high-powered stu
dent body as well as its outstanding facul
ty. Stanford's ability to attract and retain
excellent students depends on its being
responsive to concerns about both aca
demics and quality of life. It is for this rea
son if no other that the University will lis
ten if students speak.
We are currently working with the two
student members of the University's
Committee on Budget and Strategic Plan
ning to ensure that student needs are
fully considered. We are compiling bud
getary information which will be available
to interested students in order for them to
make more informed and effective contri
butions to this process.

We have organized a student town
meeting for tomorrow, October 3 at 7 p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium. Dean A.
Michael Spence of the Business School
and Dean Ewart Thomas of the School of
Humanities and Sciences will each speak
about how budget cuts will affect stu
dents. Afterward, they will answer ques
tions and hear comments from an open
microphone. This is a unique opportunity
to discuss your concerns and your ideas of
how to keep Stanford a leading academic
and research institution in the wake of a
10 percent reduction of the operating
budget.
Over the weekend, a group of senators
and Council of Presidents members will
draft a set of guidelines for the University
Cabinet to keep in mind when making its
difficult decisions. A second student town
meeting will take place on Monday, Oct. 7
at 7 p.m. in Cubberley in order for stu
dents to discuss these suggestions.
There will be a special ASSU Senate
meeting on Oct. 8 at 7 p.m. in room 180 at
the Law School to review and vote on the
recommendations brought forth in the
town meetings so these guidelines can be
presented to the University Cabinet.
The timeline is short; there are only
two weeks left before the first set of key
decisions is made. Probably every person

on this campus has at one time held back
an opinion fearing the tension which
might result from open disagreement.
This is not the time to be silent. This is
also not the time to attack other students'
educational priorities. We all have to trust
that each student knows what aspects of
Stanford he or she personally values
most.
This is the time to make it known what
we the students think the priorities of the
University should be and how we think
Stanford can best grow. Undoubtedly, we
will all disagree to some extent, and there
will be compromise. Still, if students open
up to each other and the University, Stan
ford will be in a much better position to
move forward.
Whenever you have ideas about Stan
ford and don't know how or don't have
the inclination to pursue them yourself,
please send them to us. We can be
reached by electronic mail at cop@leland,
by phone at 5-ASSU or 5-1465 or by mail
at COP, ASSU, 205 Tresidder, Stanford,
CA 94305. We look forward to hearing
from you.

John Louie, Beth Morgan, John Over
deck and Benny Sandoval are members
of the 1991-92 ASSU Council of Presi
dents.
