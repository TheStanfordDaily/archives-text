Gay rights activists
violated Gov. Wilson's
right to speak freely

I write in response to the gay rights
activists who ranted and raged through
out Governor Wilson's address at the
final convocation of the Centennial
Weekend. As guaranteed by the First
Amendment, the freedoms of speech and

expression insure for everyone not only
the right to speak, but also the right to be
heard. The activists violated both the
Governor's right to speak and his audi
ence's right to hear him.
Their goal was not one of discourse but
rather one of disruption. While the activists
were understandably angered at Gov. Wil
son's display of values, it is a shame that
they refused to respect the values of the
institution which we were celebrating.

Red banner danger

During my five years at Stanford those
fancy red banners with the leafy symbol
have been hung from the lamp posts no
less than 12 times. In this time I have
noticed the more than uncanny coinci
dence between the appearance of these
banners and a total lack of driving ability.
During these times, activities such as
driving the wrong way on one-way
streets, improperly yielding at four-way

stop signs and stopping in the middle of
the street are commonplace.
Is it perhaps that Stanford has inadver
tently chosen the international "Drive Igno
rantly" symbol to grace these lovely ban
ners? I suggest this matter be fully investi
gated as the safety of students and the very
future of the University are at stake!
Until this matter is cleared up, I make
one suggestion: When the red banners go
up, park your car and walk.
