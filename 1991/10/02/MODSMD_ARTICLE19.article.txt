## Sing to me again, Shanghai 
### 
COT}** 1 ' WANT A TAXI?" voices
I shouted at me as I walked out of
.L Shanghai International Airport.
There, at the back of the crowds, I sud
denly spotted my mother waving at me.
Home, I was finally home after so
many years. I quickened my steps.
It was a mid-August day, hot and
humid. As we drove along the bumpy
road toward the city, bike riders reluc
tantly pedaled toward the sidewalk as our
car went by. Occasionally we passed a
crawling bus loudly exhaling thick smog.
Among the cracked and dusty factories
and residences stood a few new glass
high-rises. Their golden names were all
quite familiar to me. They were the Sher
atons and the Hiltons.
Somehow, I remembered neither fea
ture of the city. I knew that the high-rises
had not been there, and I never realized
the city was so old. Everything seemed to
have cracks: the houses, the roads and
the vehicles that ran on them.
After half an hour, we finally arrived
at home. We had moved to a bigger place
I had never seen. My desk still stood in
front of the window. On the desk was my
old lamp, under which I had spent so
many nights. I slid open a drawer; my
personal letters were neatly stacked in a
corner. Somehow all those familiar sur
roundings failed to soothe me.
Had I changed, or was it the city?
Everywhere I went, I felt as out of place
as those high-rise hotels. *

I found myself no longer capable of
riding a bike. I constantly feared that I
might hit someone. Nor was I comfort
able riding the bus. I couldn't push
through the crowds anymore to get a
comfortable spot. I felt confined. I needed
my space. I found that I spoke too softly
and walked too slowly. I found that I was
no longer fit to be a Shanghainese. I had
been civilized by America.
That weekend I went with friends to the
community center where we used to hang
out. We called it the Basement because it
was built in an underground tunnel.
During the not-too-distant and more
hostile Thinking era, Shanghai had been
dug with mazes of tunnels in preparation
for war. Now with the scarcity of space,
these tunnels were used as restaurants,
pool houses and entertainment centers.
There was still a sense of discontent
that permeated this city, but no one was
taking it lying down. It had always been
difficult to accomplish things in China.
Anything that was accomplished was done
through personal connections as intricate
as the underground tunnel system.
Amazingly enough, people were utiliz
ing what little opportunities they had.
One of my friends was consulting a
Japanese firm on legal matters concern
ing investment in China. Another one was
in the process of negotiating a contract
with an American department store. My
engineering friend was busy installing a
chemical plant from the United States.

We went to a small restaurant where
we used to hang out â€” one of those places
with a huge wok right next to the side
walk. In the shiny ambience of the red
flame, you hand your meal ticket to the
chef. He scoops some hot dumplings onto
a plate and hands them back to you. The
food, oh how I had missed that taste!
There was also a sizable street market
nearby that sold the most amazing variety
of clothes. Noises of merchants offering
and customers bargaining filled the street.
Also conspicuous were the tax collec
tors. Seeing them reminded me just how
difficult it was for these people to gather all
those goods and set up this market. I felt a
sense of pride and admiration. How much
this people had accomplished with so little
and such constrained opportunities.
Wordsworth was right that "in our
embers is something that doth live." The
Shanghainese in me had somehow been
awakened. I had rediscovered the rhythm
of the city. I navigated among the sea of
people, bicycles and automobiles. I was no
longer intimidated. After all, this is my city.
