# Loud protest disrupts governor's speech
## Gay-rights demonstrators face off with police at convocation 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
At least 300 shouting demon
strators drowned out a campus
speech by Gov. Pete Wilson and
then clashed with police, disrupt
ing the final event of the Cen
tennial Celebration yesterday.
The protesters, angered by
Wilson's recent veto of a gay
rights bill, pushed to within 20
feet of the governor's podium in
the Quad before coming up
against a line of riot police sur
rounding him.
Stanford police reported no
arrests or property damage, but
at least two demonstrators were
injured when police shot Mace at
them during a confrontation that
followed Wilson's hurried depar
ture.
"It was one of the worst situa
tions I have seen in 20 years, and
I was here during the heyday of
Vietnam," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Wilson completed his 10-
minute speech, the keynote
address of the third and final
Centennial convocation, only by
hunching over the podium and
shouting into the microphone. He
denounced the "fascist tactics" of
the protesters and said they were
"more to be pitied than cen
sured."
The loud and nearly violent
protest before an estimated
crowd of 4,000 interrupted an
otherwise serene event that re
created the University's opening
ceremony and featured several
distinguished speakers.
University President Donald
Kennedy, visibly angered by the
demonstration, accused the
protesters of attempting to deny
Wilson his right to speak.
"Freedom of speech, freedom
of expression, freedom of ideas
are the core values of this univer
sity," Kennedy told the audience.
"Those freedoms received a stern
test this morning, and freedom
won."
Demonstration organizers said
many of the protesters were
activists from San Francisco and
other California cities. As many
as 100 Stanford students were
also involved, said Sairus Patel of
Stanford Queerland.
On Sunday, Wilson announced
his veto of Assembly Bill 101,
which would have banned job dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. The veto sparked
protests at state offices in San
Francisco and Los Angeles on
Monday.
"Discrimination based on sex
ual preference of an individual is
morally wrong and must be
stopped at any cost," said Wayne
Phillips, an organizer with the
San Francisco group Queer
Nation.
