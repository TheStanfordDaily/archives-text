# Loud protest disrupts governor's speech
## Gay-rights demonstrators face off with police at convocation 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
At least 300 shouting demon
strators drowned out a campus
speech by Gov. Pete Wilson and
then clashed with police, disrupt
ing the final event of the Cen
tennial Celebration yesterday.
The protesters, angered by
Wilson's recent veto of a gay
rights bill, pushed to within 20
feet of the governor's podium in
the Quad before coming up
against a line of riot police sur
rounding him.
Stanford police reported no
arrests or property damage, but
at least two demonstrators were
injured when police shot Mace at
them during a confrontation that
followed Wilson's hurried depar
ture.
"It was one of the worst situa
tions I have seen in 20 years, and
I was here during the heyday of
Vietnam," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Wilson completed his 10-
minute speech, the keynote
address of the third and final
Centennial convocation, only by
hunching over the podium and
shouting into the microphone. He
denounced the "fascist tactics" of
the protesters and said they were
"more to be pitied than cen
sured."
The loud and nearly violent
protest before an estimated
crowd of 4,000 interrupted an
otherwise serene event that re
created the University's opening
ceremony and featured several
distinguished speakers.
University President Donald
Kennedy, visibly angered by the
demonstration, accused the
protesters of attempting to deny
Wilson his right to speak.
"Freedom of speech, freedom
of expression, freedom of ideas
are the core values of this univer
sity," Kennedy told the audience.
"Those freedoms received a stern
test this morning, and freedom
won."
Demonstration organizers said
many of the protesters were
activists from San Francisco and
other California cities. As many
as 100 Stanford students were
also involved, said Sairus Patel of
Stanford Queerland.
On Sunday, Wilson announced
his veto of Assembly Bill 101,
which would have banned job dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. The veto sparked
protests at state offices in San
Francisco and Los Angeles on
Monday.
"Discrimination based on sex
ual preference of an individual is
morally wrong and must be
stopped at any cost," said Wayne
Phillips, an organizer with the
San Francisco group Queer
Nation.
"We hoped Pete Wilson would
have a chance to engage himself
in a more compassionate, more
tolerant view. This again shows
his true nature, which is one of
cowardice," Phillips said.
The governor said he vetoed the
bill because he believed it would
have been hurtful to small busi
ness and that sufficient job protec
tion already exists for the gay, les
bian and bisexual community.
But a poll released Monday
showed that 62 percent of Califor
nians supported the bill, and
newspapers have widely reported
that Wilson bowed to intense
pressure from conservative
Republicans and right-wing reli
gious groups.
Scheduled to participate in an
academic procession through the
audience yesterday, Wilson was
instead hustled in through the
back of the Quad.
His car was parked in a large,
fenced area behind the Quad's
west portal, where police from
Stanford, Palo Alto and the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's office
stood guard.
The protesters were quiet dur
ing most of the ceremony leading
up to Wilson's speech. About 50
stood and turned their backs to
Secretary of Health and Human
Services Louis Sullivan as he
spoke, but organizers said their
intent was to disrupt Wilson, not
the rest of the event.
As Wilson took the podium, the

demonstrators began blowing
whistles and chanting "Shame!
Shame!" as they pushed to the
front of the audience.
There, a line of about 35 police
officers in riot gear held off the
jeering protesters as Wilson,
rarely looking up from the podi
um, delivered his speech.
"This is not the time or place
for fascist tactics. They will not
make progress at Stanford," Wil
son said.
Three of Wilson's personal
guards surrounded him during
the speech, batting away wadded -
up fliers protesters threw at him.
At the end of the speech, Wilson
caught an orange thrown at him,
smiled, and threw it back to the
demonstrators.
Wilson received a standing ova
tion at the close of his speech as
the protesters intensified their
chanting. After the demonstra
tion ended and the protesters left
the Quad, Kennedy turned the
microphone over to Wilson for
"the last word."
"I regret that my fan club
accompanied me. . . . You don't
shout down those who wish to
give reasoned discourse," Wilson
said to another standing ovation.
Those gathered for the ceremo
ny, many of them alumni, had
mixed reactions to the demonstra
tion. Several altercations and
minor fistfights broke out
between the protesters and audi
ence members.
One man attacked a protester,
repeatedly punching him in the
leg until family members sitting
nearby restrained him. Another
protester said his whistle was

yanked off his neck by an audi
ence member, leaving a welt.
"I'm surprised they came up
here, but I think they need to be
heard," said alumna Gloria
Woehler. "The police were very
cool about it. I'm glad there was
no fight."
But tensions rose again when
Wilson left the Quad. The protesters
massed around the fenced police
area behind the west portal, waiting
for Wilson's car to leave.
When it did, however, the police
pulled a fast one: Several police
cars drove to the area's south
entrance, drawing many of the
protesters. Wilson's car meanwhile
rushed out the north entrance.
Moments later, a car believed
to be carrying Sullivan rushed out
the entrance, this time attracting
a group of protesters who fol
lowed it down the street, throw
ing various items.
A pushing and shouting match
ensued between police and
protesters, several of whom taunt
ed the officers. At least two demon
strators were sprayed with Mace
as the police officers backed their
way into the fenced police area.
A tense standoff continued
there, as demonstrators rocked
the temporary fence and further
taunted at least 60 riot police
guarding the area.
The crowd dispersed without
further incident just before 1 p.m.
Neither of the two sprayed with
Mace required medical treatment.
Protest organizers called their
action a success, saying they intend
ed no violence and simply wanted to
make their point with Wilson.
Centennial organizers said the

events were a disappointing end
to the weekend.
"I'm very sad about it," said
Susan Wolfe, assistant Centenni
al Year Office director. "It is
unfortunate that the issue at
hand had nothing to do with Stan
ford and yet it fell on our historic
anniversary."
But University officials defend
ed the selection of Wilson as a con
vocation speaker and said his poli
cy decisions played no part in the
decision to invite him to Stanford.
"We wanted the right repre
sentation from national and state
levels," Kennedy said in a brief
statement yesterday afternoon.
"The 'controversy' arose long
after those plans were laid. But
even had we known of it before
hand, we obviously would have
invited the governor."
Sean Garrett, a Wilson spokes
man in Sacramento, said the gov
ernor had considered pulling out of
the Centennial event — his first
public appearance since the veto
announcement — when protesters
Monday night smashed 50 win
dows in a state office building in
San Francisco and threw a burn
ing flag into a room.
"We were not only worried it
would ruin the event but that peo
ple would get hurt," Garrett said.
But Stanford officials, the gov
ernor's staff and the California
Highway Patrol discussed the
issue Monday, and "we felt that it
was best to go on," Garrett said.
