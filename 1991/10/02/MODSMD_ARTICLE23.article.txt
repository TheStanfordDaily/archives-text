## Stanford, NASA join forces to investigate global change New collaborative program supports wide variety of grad student research 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Do trees, airplanes and deserts have anything
in common? Yes — under a recently inaugu
rated program involving Stanford and the
nearby NASA Ames Research Center, Stanford
graduate students are studying everything from
trees to airplanes to deserts in the ultimate hope of
understanding more about global change.
The Stanford-NASA Ames Cooperative
in Global Change was formally founded in May a«er
several years of planning. The program
interdisciplinary research of global environmental
problems and phenomena and makes
ities available to Stanford students and faculty. * *
Jointly funded by Stanford and NASA Ames, the *
program this year has a budget of $85,000. Current- 112
ly, these monies are financing seven Stanford stu

dents' projects that are of interest to Ames scientists
and Stanford professors studying global change.
Stanford and Ames each contribute different
strengths and resources to the program. While
Ames provides supercomputers, aircraft and applied
scientific expertise, Stanford lends enhanced capa
