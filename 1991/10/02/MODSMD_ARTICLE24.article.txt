studying the
Valley, located
60 miles soumpast of Reno, Neva
da. He is describe the

formation and distribution of two
phenomena, "desert pavement"
and"desert varnish."
Desert pavement is a single,
mosaic-like layer of pebbles con
centrated on the surface of the
desert. Underneath this pebble
layer is a layer known as the vesic
ulated layer. This layer, which is
usually three to five centimeters
thick, is comprised of very fine
particles. It is generally composed
of clay and silt and is nearly stone
free.
"During periods of wetting and
drying, pebbles become sorted,"

explained Windeler. "Larger
stones rise to the top, forming the
pavement layer, while finer parti
cles slip lower, forming the vesicu
lated layer."
Awareness of the desert pave
ment phenomenon is crucial when
interpreting data from satellites,
according to Windeler.
"The pavement layer is rough
and can scatter radar," says
Windeler.
"The vesiculated layer also
affects thermal sensing," he adds.

Desert varnish is the other
phenomenon Windeler is investi
gating. The "varnish" is actually
a clay matrix held together by a
black, shiny coating of iron and
manganese oxides. It is found cov
ering all types of rock.

Windeler's survey of
desert rock and soil
phenomena may
eventually help clari
fy data gathered by
satellites.

"Desert varnish is a spectrally
black material. It absorbs," says
Windeler. "Remote sensing has
difficulty detecting what type of
rock is underneath the varnish.
"It's a natural spray paint, at
least in the visible."
In his survey of the Smith Val
ley, Windeler has discovered that
desert pavement formations are
concentrated near mountain
range fronts. Additionally, he has
found that fine-grained and hard,
volcanic rocks are more likely to
form desert pavement than are
coarse-grained granites and car
bonate rocks.
Windeler has already seen that
the results of his Smith Valley
survey can be generalized to larg
er areas of Nevada and southern
California.
"It is important that research
ers be aware of these phenomena
and know where to expect them,"
says Windeler. "They should keep
them in mind as they interpret
remote sensing data."
Windeler's results may be used
later as "part of a larger project"
involving NASA personnel and
aircraft with Stanford, according
to Ron Lyon, professor of applied
earth sciences.
