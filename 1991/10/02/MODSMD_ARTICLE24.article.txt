studying the
Valley, located
60 miles soumpast of Reno, Neva
da. He is describe the

formation and distribution of two
phenomena, "desert pavement"
and"desert varnish."
Desert pavement is a single,
mosaic-like layer of pebbles con
centrated on the surface of the
desert. Underneath this pebble
layer is a layer known as the vesic
ulated layer. This layer, which is
usually three to five centimeters
thick, is comprised of very fine
particles. It is generally composed
of clay and silt and is nearly stone
free.
"During periods of wetting and
drying, pebbles become sorted,"

explained Windeler. "Larger
stones rise to the top, forming the
pavement layer, while finer parti
cles slip lower, forming the vesicu
lated layer."
Awareness of the desert pave
ment phenomenon is crucial when
interpreting data from satellites,
according to Windeler.
"The pavement layer is rough
and can scatter radar," says
Windeler.
"The vesiculated layer also
affects thermal sensing," he adds.
