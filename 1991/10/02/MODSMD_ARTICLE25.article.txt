# Lerdau: the role of trees in atmospheric chemistry
## 
### 
In recent years, there has
been much publicity about
human brings' impact on
the atmo ahere. It is com-

mon knowledge that every
thing from breathing to automobile exhaust
emissions to chlorofluorocarbons directly
influences the chemistry of the atmosphere.
What is less commonly heard about and
much less understood is nature's role in atmo
spheric chemistry. How do plants influence
the composition of the atmosphere? What
types of compounds do they emit and at what
quantities? These are questions of interest to
Manuel Lerdau, a graduate student pursuing a
doctorate in biology.
First, a little background, maestro.
In the troposphere (the section of atmo
sphere extending from the earth's surface
about 10 miles out) there are many gasses.
Some of these may be classified as either
reducing compounds or oxidizing compounds.
An important group of reducing compounds
are the hydrocarbons. These are substances
made up entirely of hydrogen and carbon
atoms. Propane, butane and methane are
some common hydrocarbons.
Oxidizing compounds include such gasses
as nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.
When reducing compounds and oxidizing
compounds react, they may form ozone as a
by-product. In the upper atmosphere, this is a

Douglas fir trees. Last week, he completed his
field work in Oregon. * *
"I'm particularly interested in tavo controls
of hydrocarbon production," saJpLerdau.
"First, I'm studying the
gen. It is known that when plants sup
plied with enough nitrogen, they prodifoe more
hydrocarbons. „
"Second, I'm investigating the
seasonality on hydrocarbon emissions* It
appears that hydrocarbon emissions vary
widely between the four seasons."
To measure hydrocarbon emissions, Lerdau
encloses branches and needles in c\es\m/Jm

bags. Into one end of the bags Jhydrocarbon
free air is released. Later, at tl#* othflrapnds of
the bags, the air is recollected lb a canister.
Hydrocarbon levels are then a
technique called gas chromatography.
By taking measurements at
of the year, Lerdau is able to assesj the effect
of seasonality. 1
"We're trying to better understand the
feedbacks between the atmosphere and the
biosphere," says Lerdau. "Humans produce a
deal of oxidizing compounds, and plants
prAAice a lot of hydrocarbons. That leads to
high pzone levels."
