# Monsen: the aerodynamics of probes on airplanes
## 
### 
"Usually, you
hear about
aero-engineers

doing things to destroy the envi
ronment — building bomber
planes or whatever," says Mon
sen. "I guess I'm sort of unusual
— an aeronautical engineer work
ing to help the environment."
Monsen, a first-year graduate
student, spent this summer ana
lyzing the air flow over probes
mounted on the wings of air
planes.
What does this have to do with
global change? Plenty.
Monsen was investigating the
air flow over probes which collect
data on aerosols, tiny particles in
the air such as dust or ice that are
involved in cloud formation.
Information on cloud formation is
useful in predicting global weath
er patterns and wind flow. The
probes are operated by NASA
Ames.
"NASA Ames has been using
these types of probes for years,"
said Monsen. "The problem was,
no one ever bothered to see if air

flow patterns might be biasing
their collection of data. That's
where I came in."

Using com
puters at Ames,
Monsen ana
lyzed the air
flow patterns
over three dif
ferent probes.
Two of these
probes are
mounted on
DC-8 aircraft,
and one is

mounted on an ER-2.
"Basically, I was able to show
that the placement of these
probes was OK and that air flow
was not biasing [NASA's] data. In
these days of budget cuts, a study
such as mine could help a probe
win funding.
"Actually, the probe on the ER
-2 is still in the proposal stage. My
work, which showed that the
probe will work on that airplane
in the proposed location, may help
it receive its final funding," says
Monsen.
