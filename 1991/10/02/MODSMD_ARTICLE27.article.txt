Individual responsibility and interna
tional cooperation were identified as
prerogatives in the race to "save the
planet" at Sunday's roundtable discus
sion "Saving the Planet: What Price?
What Priority?"
"Whenever you make a decision as a
consumer, an investor, an employee, an
employer or as a parent, think about the
(environmental) implications," said

Denis Hayes, president of Green Seal, an
environmental activism group. "It has to
begin with the grassroots."
Hayes emphasized recycling as a two
step process. Not only must consumers
recycle their paper, cans and glass,
Hayes explained, but also they must buy
recycled products. "Look for the Green
Seal," said Hayes in a push for his com
pany's products.
Hayes and the other speakers empha
sized that as individuals push for the

environment, government will respond.
"Public opinion has huge power,"
said Dr. Jessica Mathews, vice president
of the World Resources Institute.
Along with emphasizing the role of
the individual, Mathews and Senator
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo. underscored
the critical role the United States must
play in setting an example for the rest of
the world.
"The Cold War has been replaced,
providing an enormous opportunity for

us to set the common goal of fighting the
global environmental crisis," said Wirth.
Walter Falcon, director of Stanford's
Food Research Institute, spoke of the
problem of development in the third
world. "Is there technology for the third
world?" he asked. "Third-world coun
tries cannot develop the way the United
States did without destroying the envi
ronment. They will need technological
and financial help from the rest of the
world," according to Falcon.

The panel almost universally agreed
the environment must become top prior
ity. Only Robert Stavins, associate pro
fessor of public policy at Harvard,
expressed doubts about the priority the
environmental crisis should assume. He
reminded the audience of national secu
rity and other demands which must be
met economically.
In addition, Stavins emphasized that
economic incentives for big busi
nesses are essential.
"By bringing the market to
bear on the environmental prob
lems, we could do a better job of
solving those problems," he said.
The adversarial attitude
between the U.S. government and
business, which makes conserva
tion difficult, was also targeted by
panelists as an area which needs
reform.
John Bryson, chief executive
officer of Southern California
Edison, emphasized the need for
energy efficiency and underscored
its huge potential. Hayes advised
buying durable products.
"It is possible to maintain a
comfortable lifestyle and still pro
tect the planet," he said.
Cooperation was one of the
buzzwords of the discussion.
"The next decade is the decade
of cooperation," said Pieter Win
semius, chair of The Netherlands'
Society for Nature Conservancy.

Panelists concurred that saving
the environment will take effort
on the part of every individual
along with the cooperation of
nations and businesses.
"Nation-states are incapable of
solving the environmental prob
lems alone," said Mathews. She
stressed that environmental
problems such as acid rain and
the depletion of the ozone layer
are not local issues. Smokestacks
in America cause acid rain in
Canada, she said.
Panelists began the roundtable
by giving five-minute presenta
tions. These speeches were direct
ed at various objectives ranging
from education to separating the
abortion issue from the issue of
overpopulation.
After concluding the speeches,
audience questions sparked fur
ther discussion. The audience was
comprised mainly of alumni.
Some students expressed dis
appointment at the event.
"The discussion was too loose
ly directed," said Juge Gregg, a
sophomore. "Given that it was a
panel of experts, I expected it to
be more in-depth."
