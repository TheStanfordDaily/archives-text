Individual responsibility and interna
tional cooperation were identified as
prerogatives in the race to "save the
planet" at Sunday's roundtable discus
sion "Saving the Planet: What Price?
What Priority?"
"Whenever you make a decision as a
consumer, an investor, an employee, an
employer or as a parent, think about the
(environmental) implications," said

Denis Hayes, president of Green Seal, an
environmental activism group. "It has to
begin with the grassroots."
Hayes emphasized recycling as a two

Hayes and the other speakers empha

environment, government will respond.
"Public opinion has huge power,"
said Dr. Jessica Mathews, vice president
of the World Resources Institute.
Along with emphasizing the role of
the individual, Mathews and Senator
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo. underscored
the critical role the United States must
play in setting an example for the rest of
the world.
"The Cold War has been replaced,
providing an enormous opportunity for

us to set the common goal of fighting the
global environmental crisis," said Wirth.
Walter Falcon, director of Stanford's
Food Research Institute, spoke of the
problem of development in the third
world. "Is there technology for the third
world?" he asked. "Third-world coun
tries cannot develop the way the United
States did without destroying the envi
ronment. They will need technological
and financial help from the rest of the
world," according to Falcon.

The panel almost universally agreed
the environment must become top prior
ity. Only Robert Stavins, associate pro
fessor of public policy at Harvard,
expressed doubts about the priority the
environmental crisis should assume. He
reminded the audience of national secu
rity and other demands which must be
met economically.
In addition, Stavins emphasized that
