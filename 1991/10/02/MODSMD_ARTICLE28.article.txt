# Floppy fundamentals

Let's talk disks, diskettes, floppies and
plastic pop tarts. Unless you have a tele
porter, as in TRON, these are what you use
to get data into and out of Macintosh com
puters. IBM/Amiga/NeXT folks, as you know,
are left out on this campus.
There are three different flavors of
diskettes. The original single-sided, 400K
format was used by pre-Mac Plus machines.
The most common format is double-sided,
double-density, 800K.
A few years ago, Apple rolled out the new
FDHD drive. Realizing acronyms without
vowels don't wash, Apple quickly renamed it
the SuperDrive.
SuperDrive can read 400K, 800K, IBM
formatted and High Density (HD) diskettes.
Generally, SE/30 and newer Macs have
FDHDs.
HDs have a second hole in addition to the
one for the read-write tab. More importantly,
they are different inside so they can store
more data (1.4 megabytes).
Problem: 800K drives in the old machines
can't read HDs. They try to reformat them. If
you do reinitialize an HD in an 800K drive,
the format will eventually break down. You
will again lose everything.
Moral: never bring an HD near a non-
SuperDrive Mac.
Corollary to Moral: for now, while there
are so many non-SuperDrive Macs around,
L, â– 

don't use HDs. All Macs can read cheaper
800K disks, so use them.
Six ways to retrieve your disk
1. Put Away (apple-Y), on System 7's File
menu. Or drag the disk to the trash. Shut
Down puts away all disks.
2. Eject (apple-E), System 7's Special or
System 6's File menu, or Eject button in
Open/Save dialog. Unlike #1, this a) does not
make the Mac forget about your disk and b)
does not write housekeeping information.
3. Apple-Shift-1 for the internal/upper
disk, Apple-2 for the external/lower disk,
Apple-0 for a third disk. Same as #2 but can
be done any time, increasing the likelihood
that something important has not been writ
ten to disk.
4. Restart your bombed Mac. Hold down
the mouse button while starting up. It should
spit out.
5. Turn off the Mac. Put a straightened
paper clip in the hole provided. If the disk
doesn't come out easily, give up. Don't pry it
out with a ruler, like some guy in Naranja did
last year, or you'll have to buy a new one
(drive, not ruler).
6. Have someone with the tools and know
how remove it from inside. Don't open an SE
or Classic yourself unless you're prepared to
emulate the Stadium Spectacular fireworks.
