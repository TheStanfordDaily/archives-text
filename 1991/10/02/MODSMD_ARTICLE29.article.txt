Q. Why does seeing someone
else yawn make me yawn? Does
yawning serve a useful purpose?
A # Psychologists have deter-
I mined that seeing or think
ing about yawns elicits yawns. In
a study using college student "vol
unteers," two and a half times as
many students yawned during a
film showing yawning than those
watching smiles. This research
indicates that yawns are
"releasers of a fixed action pat
tern," which in plainspeak means
that we are genetically pro
grammed to yawn when we see a
yawn.
Releasers are rare among
humans, but fairly common
among other animal species. For
example, a red dot on the bill of
the female herring gull stimulates
mouth opening in the gull chick
so that mom can upchuck smelly
fish into junior. Mating dances of
male birds are potent releasers of
the reciprocal behaviors in female
birds such as .. . (I'll leave this
one to your imagination!).
Yawns also serve as displace
ment activity. We yawn when we
have nothing better to do. I would
stake money on bet that 99.99
percent of the students would
yawn at (insert name of boring
person) droning on about (insert
your most boring class). Fetal
yawning has been observed with
ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation.
Not that the fetus can see anyone
yawn — it's probably just down
right boring in there.
What is the benefit of yawn
ing? It is commonly thought that
yawning occurs when oxygen lev
els in the blood fall or carbon diox-

ide levels rise. If this theory is
true, then breathing 100 percent
oxygen — air is only 21 percent
oxygen — should inhibit yawning.
So they rounded up some, you
guessed it, eager college students
and had them breathe pure oxy
gen. The students yawned any
way.
The researchers didn't test the
reverse situation — that a lack of
oxygen stimulates yawning —
"because of concern about stress
ing the subjects." I suppose that
asphyxiating, turning blue or per
haps lapsing into a coma only to
awake a complete vegetable would
stress a subject.
Since that theoiy's history, the
replacement goes something like
this: The contraction of facial
muscles during a yawn forces
blood through the cerebral vessels
resulting in alertness. This makes
sense in view of studies that

showed that subjects who yawn
through clench teeth do not feel
"satisfied."
To learn more about yawning,
scientists are testing drugs that
stimulate yawning. Strangely,
these drugs often have sexual
arousal as a side effect. Hopefully,
for most of you, yawns and sexual
arousal don't go hand in hand.
Those of you who are chronic
yawners will be comforted to
know that psychotics rarely yawn
and discomforted to know that
yawning too hard often dislocates
jaws that must be popped into
place by a professional wrestler —
oops, I mean doctor.
Q: What causes the horrible
squeal of chalk on the chalk
board? Is the answer clueless lec
turers?
A. The tribologist would tell you
I it's friction. Tribology is
defined as "a science and technol
ogy embracing all subjects
involved when surfaces in contact
move in relation to each other."
Sounds a little kinky, huh? Well,
when I went to research the great
works in tribology at Terman
library, kinkiness I did not find.
What I did discover is that fric
tion is both our enemy and our
friend. In the United States alone,
friction and wear account for
$100 billion lost each year. Ten
percent of all energy we generate
is dissipated by friction. And
these figures don't even include
costs of friction between interna
tional leaders!
Even long ago, the ancient
Egyptians knew that friction was
not a good thing. An Egyptian
painting shows a statue weighing
approximately 60 tons being
moved by 172 men. One of the
men (the lucky one, I presume) is
pouring a lubricant onto wooden
boards. Without lubrication, tri

bologists estimate that the Egyp
tians would have worked three
times as many slaves to death to
build the Great Pyramids.

Enough of the negative! Just
try to walk, chew your food, play
a violin or stop a car without fric

tion. You won't get very far. As
for the chalk, squealing results
when the chalk sticks, slips and
vibrates. To eliminate this
annoying problem hold the chalk
less tightly, switch the angle of
the chalk to the board or change
your writing speed.

have determined that
seeing or thinking
about yawns elicits
yawns.

ide levels rise. If this theory is
true, then breathing 100 percent
oxygen — air is only 21 percent
oxygen — should inhibit yawning.
So they rounded up some, you
guessed it, eager college students
and had them breathe pure oxy
gen. The students yawned any
way.
The researchers didn't test the
reverse situation — that a lack of
oxygen stimulates yawning —
"because of concern about stress
ing the subjects." I suppose that
asphyxiating, turning blue or per
haps lapsing into a coma only to
awake a complete vegetable would
stress a subject.
Since that theoiy's history, the
replacement goes something like
this: The contraction of facial
muscles during a yawn forces
blood through the cerebral vessels
resulting in alertness. This makes
sense in view of studies that

showed that subjects who yawn
through clench teeth do not feel
"satisfied."
To learn more about yawning,
scientists are testing drugs that
stimulate yawning. Strangely,
these drugs often have sexual
arousal as a side effect. Hopefully,
for most of you, yawns and sexual
arousal don't go hand in hand.
Those of you who are chronic
yawners will be comforted to
know that psychotics rarely yawn
and discomforted to know that
yawning too hard often dislocates
jaws that must be popped into
place by a professional wrestler —
oops, I mean doctor.
Q: What causes the horrible
squeal of chalk on the chalk
board? Is the answer clueless lec
turers?
A. The tribologist would tell you
I it's friction. Tribology is
defined as "a science and technol
ogy embracing all subjects
involved when surfaces in contact
move in relation to each other."
Sounds a little kinky, huh? Well,
when I went to research the great
works in tribology at Terman
library, kinkiness I did not find.
What I did discover is that fric
tion is both our enemy and our
friend. In the United States alone,
friction and wear account for
$100 billion lost each year. Ten
percent of all energy we generate
is dissipated by friction. And
these figures don't even include
costs of friction between interna
tional leaders!
Even long ago, the ancient
Egyptians knew that friction was
not a good thing. An Egyptian
painting shows a statue weighing
approximately 60 tons being
moved by 172 men. One of the
men (the lucky one, I presume) is
pouring a lubricant onto wooden
boards. Without lubrication, tri

bologists estimate that the Egyp
tians would have worked three
times as many slaves to death to
build the Great Pyramids.

Enough of the negative! Just
try to walk, chew your food, play
a violin or stop a car without fric

tion. You won't get very far. As
for the chalk, squealing results
when the chalk sticks, slips and
vibrates. To eliminate this
annoying problem hold the chalk
less tightly, switch the angle of
the chalk to the board or change
your writing speed.
