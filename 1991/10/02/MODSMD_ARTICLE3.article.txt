# How protest came together

The protesters who disrupted
yesterday's Centennial convoca
tion, for the most part activists
from outside the University,
gained access to the ceremony by
re-using tickets and causing con
frontations with police guarding
the entrances to the Quad.
Although the protest was ini
tially organized by the on-campus
group Queerland, most of the par
ticipants were from other groups.
Wayne Phillips, a member of the
San Francisco organization Queer
Nation, led one group of protesters.
Phillips' group and others
devised a plan to get as many of
the protesters as possible into the
ceremony. Ticket holders were to
go in and hand off their tickets to
a few designated carriers, who
would then smuggle tickets back
out and distribute them so more
could enter.

At 10 a.m., protesters began
entering the east gate of the
Quad, across from Cubberley
Auditorium. Several organizers
carried stacks of tickets back out
so they could be re-used.
Police later began taking the
tickets of people who entered.
Protester Robin Todd of San
Francisco said he had "gotten 30
or 40 people in" before police
started collecting tickets.
Several minutes later, a hand
ful of protesters coverged on one
of the two entrances near the east
portal, pushing the police and cre
ating a diversion. When officers
guarding the other entrance
responded, about 30 protesters
slipped in.
No one was hurt in the inci
dent. Police quickly brought in
fences to secure the area.

Protesters angry over Gov. Pete Wilson's weekend veto of a gay-rights bill confront police in the Quad yesterday. At least 35 officers in riot
gear confronted the chanting crowd several yards in front of the podium where Wilson addressed a Centennial convocation audience. No
arrests were made.

Gov. Wilson was able to complete his 10-minute speech, but
demonstrators' screams drowned out much of what he said.
managed to storm in at the front of
the Quad.
A protester who called himself
"Patrick" described the incident:
"There were only two cops out
front, so we (the crowd) just
rushed them. I tackled one (police
officer), and pushed through, and
everybody followed. We probably
got about 30-50 more people in."
Police quickly moved in about
a dozen reinforcements, clad in
riot gear, to cover the front
entrance. About 50 protesters
remained outside.
Protesters also asked some of
the ceremony guests for their
tickets.
Senior Jolyn Okimoto said one
group requested that she give
them her ticket, saying it was
"not for the protesters but for

some friends. . . . They promised
that they'd return (the tickets) at
the entrance as I left. ... I was
angry; I felt deceived."
Another woman was confront
ed by a group of protesters as she
left the convocation. One
protester requested that she give
them her ticket, which she did.
When the protester tried to
enter with the ticket, he was
stopped by police, who said the
ticket did not belong to him. The
youth tried to strike the officers
and was restrained by police,
according to witnesses.
Several guests at the convoca
tion also offered their tickets on
their own.
Queerland organizers Sairus
Patel, a senior, and Steven Pitts, a
graduate student, said that they
did not direct the protest. Instead,
Patel said, they invited protesters
to take whatever action they
wished.
Fliers distributed by the group
at a meeting before the convoca
tion said, "Each individual must
decide what form of protest is com
patible with her/his conscience."
Most of the protesters identi
fied themselves as members of
Act Up and Queer Nation, two

San Francisco-based groups. Act
Up spokeswoman Judith Cohen
said the group did not play any
formal organizational role.
Pitts and Patel said Queerland
played a role in the initial organi
zation of the event and in getting
Stanford students to participate.
An answering machine mes
sage recorded at the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
on Monday told protesters where
to get passes for the convocation.
The message said, "Queer groups
from all over central and north
ern California will take part."
Members of Queerland also
distributed several hundred fliers
in San Francisco on Monday.
The fliers, titled "QUEER
LAND EMERGENCY ALERT,"
gave the date and time of the Cen
tennial Convocation and said,
"There will be a Queerland demon
stration during Gov. Pete Wilson's
Stanford Centennial Convocation
speech to express queer outrage at
his veto of AB 101."
The fliers also advertised a pre
protest meeting at 9:30 a.m. at
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center on the second
floor of the Fire Truck House.
About 250 to 300 people from

outside Stanford arrived yester
day morning in a caravan of honk
ing cars and buses, with protesters
leaning from the windows, blow
ing whistles and chanting.
The carpools, which left from
Market Street in San Francisco,
were advertised at Monday
night's demonstration there
against Wilson, said Pitts.
As they arrived at the LGBCC,
protesters were given fliers and
placards. Patel said that Queer
land also served donuts to the
activists.
Thirty to 40 Stanford students
had also gathered outside the Fire
Truck House.
Patel said the LGBCC received a
message on its answering machine
Monday night from an anonymous
caller warning that a bomb had
been planted in the center.
Pitts rephrased the message: "I
planted a bomb in your building
to go off . . . at 10 a.m. I want to
kill you, all you fucking faggots."
"We get these sorts of mes
sages often, and it's hard to know
how to react," Pitts added.
Pitts said the police sealed off
the building while they were
searching for bombs. As a result,
the protesters met outside.
