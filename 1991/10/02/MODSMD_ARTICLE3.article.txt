# How protest came together

The protesters who disrupted
yesterday's Centennial convoca
tion, for the most part activists
from outside the University,
gained access to the ceremony by
re-using tickets and causing con
frontations with police guarding
the entrances to the Quad.
Although the protest was ini
tially organized by the on-campus
group Queerland, most of the par
ticipants were from other groups.
Wayne Phillips, a member of the
San Francisco organization Queer
Nation, led one group of protesters.
Phillips' group and others
devised a plan to get as many of
the protesters as possible into the
ceremony. Ticket holders were to
go in and hand off their tickets to
a few designated carriers, who
would then smuggle tickets back
out and distribute them so more
could enter.

At 10 a.m., protesters began
entering the east gate of the
Quad, across from Cubberley
Auditorium. Several organizers
carried stacks of tickets back out
so they could be re-used.
Police later began taking the
tickets of people who entered.
Protester Robin Todd of San
Francisco said he had "gotten 30
or 40 people in" before police
started collecting tickets.
Several minutes later, a hand
ful of protesters coverged on one
of the two entrances near the east
portal, pushing the police and cre
ating a diversion. When officers
guarding the other entrance
responded, about 30 protesters
slipped in.
No one was hurt in the inci
dent. Police quickly brought in
fences to secure the area.

Protesters angry over Gov. Pete Wilson's weekend veto of a gay-rights bill confront police in the Quad yesterday. At least 35 officers in riot
gear confronted the chanting crowd several yards in front of the podium where Wilson addressed a Centennial convocation audience. No
arrests were made.

Gov. Wilson was able to complete his 10-minute speech, but
demonstrators' screams drowned out much of what he said.
