## Confident Garrard gets her shot as Card keeper 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
Leslie Garrard, starting goalkeeper
for the Stanford women's soccer team,
may be the greatest player of all time.
Then again, she may not be.
The question is, when will she get the
opportunity to show us? The dazzling
Cardinal defense has allowed fewer than
five shots on goal per game, hardly giv
ing the sophomore from Dallas, Texas, a
chance to show the world what she can
do.
While this situation might be consid
ered frustrating by most, Garrard is
happy with her first full season in the
Stanford goal.
"It's great that our team has played
well enough that I haven't had a lot of
pressure. I've had a lot of time to adjust
to our defense, Garrard said.
"I've always considered my strength
to be stopping shots," Garrard later
added, "but this year I've gotten the
chance to work on directing the defense
and working with Heather (Mclntyre)."
Garrard admits some disadvantages
to playing in one lopsided victory after
another.
"I've always had the mentality of
wanting to make the big save," Garrard
said, noting that such opportunities
have been few and far between this sea
son.
"But I realize that my job here is just
to keep the ball out of the net, to dis
tribute the ball, and to make the occa
sional big save when I have to."
Head coach Berhane Andeberhan
recalls one such monumental stop. "We
were playing Washington earlier in the
year. It was a close game, and we were
up 1-0 when Washington had a golden
opportunity to score but Leslie made a
terrific save. I mean, Leslie had no busi
ness making that save, and when she
did it turned the game around for us."
With all the praise issuing forth
about Garrard's ability to stop the ball,
it is surprising to learn that she was not
originally put in goal.
"I played fullback when I was
younger," Garrard noted. "In soccer
camp, a coach saw me punt the ball once
and told me, 'You should be a goalkeep
er.'" And so she became one.
Garrard attended Greenhill High, a
small school where soccer stars are sel-

"Soccer was not a strong sport. My
senior year, I played striker half the
time because goalkeeping was too bor
ing," Garrard said.
That is not to say that she was losing
interest in the position — she had sim
ply started looking elsewhere for greater
challenges in her sport.
In April of her senior year, she went
to Bulgaria and played with the youth
national team. This experience may
have given her the self-assuredness
needed to succeed at college-level soccer.
"Last year, I was pretty confident
that I would start for the team [after
former goalkeeper Elise Edwards grad
uated!. The position was wide open for
awhile. ... it was up to who could exude
confidence and show that they could do
it every game.
"At this level, I think that goalkeep
ing is all confidence. Everyone has
proven that they have the physical abil
ity. ... it comes down to confidence,"
Garrard said.
She also cites the three other goal
keepers on the squad and the resulting
"competitive, but very positive" environ
ment as reasons for her own improve-

ment and success.
As the Cardinal schedule gets tougher
and tougher throughout the rest of the
year, Garrard will be tested more and
more. Stanford plays Brown and No. 10
Duke this weekend in the Cardinal Clas
sic and will face perennial NCAA title
contender UC-Santa Clara two weeks
afterwards.
It is in these games that Garrard will
be put to the test.
Andeberhan is extremely confident in
his goalkeeper's ability, despite many
preseason skeptics who wondered
whether anyone could replace the gradu
ated Edwards in goal.
"Leslie is as good, or perhaps even
better, than Elise was in goal," Andeber
han said.
Such high praise would tend to make
an athlete's head swell, but Garrard's
obvious modesty would lead one to
believe that she was a fourth-string goal
keeper for a second-rate soccer program
rather than the starter for a nationally
ranked powerhouse. In the words of one
observer, "she has no idea how good she
is."
Well, neither do we, at least until the
Cardinal stops their annoying habit of
completely crushing each team that
dares face them.
In seven games Garrard has allowed
only two goals while the Cardinal have
tallied 35. She has clocked 484 minutes
in goal but has only faced 15 shots. Her
talents have not yet been tested but that
trend may soon change.
As Stanford battles tougher oppo
nents in weeks to come, look for Leslie
Garrard to emerge as one of the newest
and brightest stars in Cardinal athletics.

Sophomore goalkeeper Leslie Garrard has needed binoculars this year to see the
action. Rarely has the ball touched Stanford's side of the field. Despite the lack of
shots she's faced, Garrard is prepared to stop Duke and Brown in this weekend's Car
dinal Classic.
Leslie Garrard, starting goalkeeper
for the Stanford women's soccer team,
may be the greatest player of all time.
Then again, she may not be.
The question is, when will she get the
opportunity to show us? The dazzling
Cardinal defense has allowed fewer than
five shots on goal per game, hardly giv
ing the sophomore from Dallas, Texas, a
chance to show the world what she can
do.
While this situation might be consid
ered frustrating by most, Garrard is
happy with her first full season in the
Stanford goal.
"It's great that our team has played
well enough that I haven't had a lot of
pressure. I've had a lot of time to adjust
to our defense, Garrard said.
"I've always considered my strength
to be stopping shots," Garrard later
added, "but this year I've gotten the
chance to work on directing the defense
and working with Heather (Mclntyre)."
Garrard admits some disadvantages
to playing in one lopsided victory after
another.
"I've always had the mentality of
wanting to make the big save," Garrard
said, noting that such opportunities
have been few and far between this sea
son.
"But I realize that my job here is just
to keep the ball out of the net, to dis
tribute the ball, and to make the occa
sional big save when I have to."
Head coach Berhane Andeberhan
recalls one such monumental stop. "We
were playing Washington earlier in the
year. It was a close game, and we were
up 1-0 when Washington had a golden
opportunity to score but Leslie made a
terrific save. I mean, Leslie had no busi
ness making that save, and when she
did it turned the game around for us."
With all the praise issuing forth
about Garrard's ability to stop the ball,
it is surprising to learn that she was not
originally put in goal.
"I played fullback when I was
younger," Garrard noted. "In soccer
camp, a coach saw me punt the ball once
and told me, 'You should be a goalkeep
er.'" And so she became one.
Garrard attended Greenhill High, a
small school where soccer stars are sel-

'We were playing Washington earlier in the
year. It was a close game, and we were up 1-0
when Washington had a golden opportunity
to score but Leslie made a terrific save. I
mean, Leslie had no business making that
save, and when she did it turned the game
around for us.'

"Soccer was not a strong sport. My
senior year, I played striker half the
time because goalkeeping was too bor
ing," Garrard said.
That is not to say that she was losing
interest in the position — she had sim
ply started looking elsewhere for greater
challenges in her sport.
In April of her senior year, she went
to Bulgaria and played with the youth
national team. This experience may
have given her the self-assuredness
needed to succeed at college-level soccer.
"Last year, I was pretty confident
that I would start for the team [after
former goalkeeper Elise Edwards grad
uated!. The position was wide open for
awhile. ... it was up to who could exude
confidence and show that they could do
it every game.
"At this level, I think that goalkeep
ing is all confidence. Everyone has
proven that they have the physical abil
ity. ... it comes down to confidence,"
Garrard said.
She also cites the three other goal
keepers on the squad and the resulting
"competitive, but very positive" environ
ment as reasons for her own improve-

ment and success.
As the Cardinal schedule gets tougher
and tougher throughout the rest of the
year, Garrard will be tested more and
more. Stanford plays Brown and No. 10
Duke this weekend in the Cardinal Clas
sic and will face perennial NCAA title
contender UC-Santa Clara two weeks
afterwards.
It is in these games that Garrard will
be put to the test.
Andeberhan is extremely confident in
his goalkeeper's ability, despite many
preseason skeptics who wondered
whether anyone could replace the gradu
ated Edwards in goal.
"Leslie is as good, or perhaps even
better, than Elise was in goal," Andeber
han said.
Such high praise would tend to make
an athlete's head swell, but Garrard's
obvious modesty would lead one to
believe that she was a fourth-string goal
keeper for a second-rate soccer program
rather than the starter for a nationally
ranked powerhouse. In the words of one
observer, "she has no idea how good she
is."
Well, neither do we, at least until the
Cardinal stops their annoying habit of
completely crushing each team that
dares face them.
In seven games Garrard has allowed
only two goals while the Cardinal have
tallied 35. She has clocked 484 minutes
in goal but has only faced 15 shots. Her
talents have not yet been tested but that
trend may soon change.
As Stanford battles tougher oppo
nents in weeks to come, look for Leslie
Garrard to emerge as one of the newest
and brightest stars in Cardinal athletics.
