# Lott, Craig are back in black for a team owner who cares
## A1 Davis fosters loyalty, treats players like family 
### 
I was watching football last Sunday afternoon
(surprise!), and I finally saw Ronnie Lott and
Roger Craig wearing uniforms that they looked
good in. No, this isn't a fashion column, although
silver and black are more classic colors than red and
tan.
But I digress. It's been a long time coming, but
these two great players are finally playing for an
owner and a team that has as much character as
they do.
This certainly wasn't the case when Ronnie and
Roger played their home games at Candlestick Park,
because Edward Deßartoio Jr., the owner of the San
Francisco 49ers, does not have a 'commitment to
excellence'; he has only a commitment to his wallet.
The 49ers are a company, and a 49er player is
simply an employee — his job is to earn money for
the company, and he is rewarded by Debartolo for a
job well done with a vacation to Hawaii.
But once he is a step slower or he reacts a split
second later, he should expect to be curtly dismissed
from employment and have his links to the company
severed.
The Raiders are a family, and a Raider player is
a member of that family — his job is to 'just
win, baby', and he is rewarded by A 1 Davis for
a job well done with a father's love. Once he is a step
slower or he reacts a split-secfcnd later, he may very
well be asked to leave the team.
But wherever he goes, he will always be a part of
the Raider family, and Davis takes care of the needs
of his sons.
Understanding the differences between the the
two teams, is it really any surprise that Lott and
Craig left San Francisco? After years of service to
Debartolo, they were rewarded with the indignity of
being put on plan B free agency. In effect what the
49ers were saying was "you guys can leave if you
want, because we don't really need you."
Of course the 49ers expected that Lott and Craig
would be too loyal to the team to leave, and they no
doubt tried to assure the two that it was simply a
business decision (which of course it was).
But a team that conducts itself in this manner
does not cultivate loyalty in its players, and so it
should be no surprise that Lott and Craig left.
These two great men did not need to spend one
more minute of their brilliant careers playing for an
owner who would treat them with such a lack of
respect, and so it should be no surprise that Lott and
Craig landed in Los Angeles, playing for Davis.
Now they are part of the Raider family, which in
a lot of ways is like the mafia. Seemingly everyone
outside of the Raider organization despises Davis,
yet everyone who is a Raider is loyal to the team and
its don-like figure, Davis.
A 1 treats everyone outside the family (i.e. the
cities of Oakland, Los Angeles and Irwindale) with
indifference or contempt, but to his players he is
extremely loyal.
And loyalty is just what Ronnie and Roger were
looking for. Rudely dismissed from the team to
which they had given the best years of their careers,

The 49ers are a company, and a
49er player is simply an employ
ee — his job is to earn money for
the company, and he is rewarded
by Debartolo for a job well done
with a vacation to Hawaii.
But once he is a step slower
or he reacts a split-second later,
he should expect to be curtly dis
missed from employment.

they wanted someone to treat them with dignity and
respect in the last years of their careers. In the
Raiders, they found just such a team.
And the really delicious irony is that at least one
of these guys can still play, as we saw on Sunday
when they played against their former employers.
Craig, unfortunately, does not have that much left,
but it was good to see him running with the style
that is distinctly his own, knees up around his chin.
Lott, who is still a force in the league, was stick
ing everyone in sight. How appropriate it was
that the Raiders sealed their win with Ronnie
breaking up a fourth down pass deep in Los Angeles
territory.
After he caused the incompletion, Lott stood with
his hands in the air, looking extremely proud and
totally vindicated. Craig, on the sidelines, stuck his
index finger up in the air, seemingly indicating
which team was better in his mind.
These pictures were very painful, no doubt, to
49er fans, but they have only their owner and team
to blame. Lott and Craig were treated very rudely by
the 49ers after San Francisco lost to the Giants last
January, and last Sunday they returned the favor
when the 49ers visited their new home, the Los
Angeles Coliseum. Ronnie and Roger are right
where they belong, and they look damn good in sil
ver and black.
