# Jekyll and Hyde booters face formidable Fresno State
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
After scoring a decisive 4-1 road victory
over favored St. Mary's on Sunday, it
appears as though the Stanford men's soc
cer team is headed in the right direction in
1991.
Not necessarily so, according to coach
Colin Lindores. "I still have no idea how
good a team we really are," said the sec
ond-year coach. "There's no doubt that we
have a good team. But a great team? Ask
me at the end of the year."
It's been that kind of a season for the
Cardinal. The team has survived bouts
with four ranked opponents in its first
eight games, emerging with a solid 4-2-2
victory in the process. They've won four of
their last five contests. Yet, even now,
Stanford is still searching for consistency.
"On any given day, I do not know which
of my teams will show up," said Lindores.
"We're capable of beating any team in the
country, but we're still not a great team."
Today, the Cardinal faces perhaps its
biggest test of the year, taking on national
power Fresno State at Maloney Field at 3
p.m. Fresno has advanced to the NCAA
Tournament six years in a row. 1991
appears to be no different, as the Bulldogs
have quickly emerged as one of the top
clubs in the country once again.
"I guess you could say we're on a good
run," said head coach John Bleum. What
an understatement. Fresno is riding a
seven game winning streak, and is cur
rently ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Division
I West poll and No. 7 nationally. The high
light of their latest run has been a victory
over UCLA, a pre-season top club, in the
Goal Rush Classic tournament Sept. 22.
The formidable Bulldog attack is led by
Gerell Elliott, a senior striker who may be
the top collegiate forward in the nation
today. Elliott leads the country in scoring
with 12 goals and 8 assists — and, accord
ing to Bleum, has meant even more to the
team than his numbers suggest. "He's
been an unstoppable force for us thus far.
Without a doubt, Elliott is the heart and
soul of our offense," Bleum said.
Lindores says that stopping Elliott will
be one of the keys to today's game.

"[Elliott] is an excellent collegiate player,
with the potential to ignite an entire team.
He's got great speed and is somebody who
we will really have to watch out for in the
Fresno game," Lindores said.
This is not to say that Stanford's
defense hasn't become a force to reckon
with lately. Led by the efforts of goalie
Kyle Krpata and fullback Jeff Kogl, the
Cardinal "D" has allowed over two goals
in only one of the squad's eight games.
Krpata, a junior, has been"the most
consistent player on the team this sea
son," according to Lindores. The goalie
has allowed a mere 1.36 goals per game
and has singlehandedly saved a handful of
near-defeats.
Kogl is quietly establishing himself as
one of the best freshmen in the West. As
the Cardinal's starting sweeper, "Kogl has
really stepped in, playing a position that is
generally confined to older players," Lin
dores said. Kogl has also chipped in on
offense, picking up a goal in Stanford's
loss to Portland in the Portland Tourna
ment.
What exactly would a Cardinal victory
today signify? First and foremost, imme
diate recognition for the team. A win over
Fresno State would be the biggest of the
season for Stanford.
Coach Lindores hopes that a victory
today would lead to more than just respect
for his squad. "Beating Fresno would be a
real nice springboard at this point in the
year, when we're starting to think about
the NCAA's." The coach summed up the
fortunes of his team in a few sentences.
"I really think that we have a shot at
knocking off [Fresno State], I really do. If
we start off hot, we can beat anyone."
"But with this mob of players I've got,
who knows what will happen?"

The play of fullback Ricky Goad is one reason the Stanford men's soccer team has won four of its last five games. The
Cardinal defense has allowed more than two goals in a contest only once this season. Goad, a sophomore from Tyler,
Texas, has also contributed offensively with one goal and an assist. Stanford takes on the top-10 ranked Fresno State
Bulldogs today at Maloney Field.
