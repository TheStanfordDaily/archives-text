# Sullivan, Gardner highlight third convocation ceremony
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla 
Although protesters heckled
Gov. Pete Wilson during his
speech, the rest of yesterday's
final Centennial convocation
was relatively peaceful and
went according to plan.
Secretary of Health and
Human Services Louis Sulli
van saluted Stanford and read
a letter from President Bush
and his wife Barbara congratu
lating the University on its
first 100 years. In the letter,
Bush wrote that Stanford had
"established itself as a leader"
with "world renown."
Professor John Gardner
presented Richard and Jing
Lyman with the Degrees of
Uncommon Man and Uncom
mon Woman for their contri
bution to the community. The
Lymans are the third couple to
receive this award.
Richard Lyman was president

of the University from 1970 to
1980, when he became president
of the Rockefeller Foundation. In
1988 he came back to Stanford to
help found the Institute for
International Studies.
Jing Lyman was a founder
of the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender. Both
Richard and Jing Lyman
received a standing ovation.
Speeches were also given by
University President Donald
Kennedy, Board of Trustees
President James Gaither and
Centennial Celebration Chair
Gerald Lieberman.
A time capsule containing
documents called "a sliver of
civilization" was installed
today in the cornerstone,
where it will remain sealed
until 2091. The objects in the
capsule were chosen to help the
people that open it 100 years
from now understand Stanford
and the world in 1991.
