# Student arrested in alleged sex assault
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
A 23-year-old Stanford stu
dent was arrested yesterday in
connection with last Sunday's
reported sexual assault in a
campus dormitory, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said.
Stuart John Thomas, a
junior, was charged with one
count of unlawful sexual inter
course with a minor and one
count of furnishing alcohol to a
minor, Herrington said.
No charge of "forceable rape"
was made, according to detec
tive Tim Frecceri. "Forceable
rape" implies an assault "by
force, menace or duress," Frec
ceri said.

Law School Prof. Michael
Wald said the charge of unlawful
sex with a minor is synonymous
with the term "statutory rape."
He said statutory rape, in
California law, is defined as
having sexual intercourse with
a minor under 18, with or
without consent.
A single statutory rape
charge, made without a charge
of forceable rape, is "very unusu
al," Wald said.
Thomas surrendered to
Frecceri at the Stanford Police
station at about 4:30 p.m. yes
terday.
Thomas was booked at the
Stanford Police station and taken
to the north county branch of the
Santa Clara County Jail in Palo
Alto, Frecceri said.
Bail was originally set at
$80,000. Later yesterday a judge
denied a request to release
Thomas on his own recognizance
and set his bail at $10,000.
Thomas did not post bail last
night and was transferred to the
county jail in San Jose.
Frecceri said Thomas will be
arraigned today at the Palo Alto

Municipal Court Building.
The charge of unlawful sex
with a minor is a felony, with a
maximum penalty of one year in
prison or county jail, Frecceri said.
The other charge is a misde
meanor, which Herrington said
"typically" carries a maximum
penalty of six months in county
jail and a $500 fine.
The alleged assault occurred in
a student room in Casa Zapata on
Sept. 22. Herrington said the
police received a call from the
woman, a student, shortly before
noon the next day.
One Zapata resident said the

last week has been very difficult
for the people in the house.
"Overall, it was a very challenging
time," the resident said.
Zapata Resident Fellow Tony
Burciaga and several other Zapa
ta residents declined to comment
yesterday.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said he was "glad that
the district attorney saw that
there was sufficient evidence" to
make an arrest.
The police investigated the
case until late Monday, when the
district attorney issued the com
plaint against Thomas.
