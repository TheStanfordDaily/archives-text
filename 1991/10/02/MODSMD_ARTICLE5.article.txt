# Fire prevention measures irk some students County officials bring stricter enforcement of codes to University
##

When residents of Cowell Cluster returned
last week, they found that more than 100 lofts
had been dismantled — one of several changes
that are part of a new, stricter enforcement of
fire codes.
University and Fire Department officials
claim that all the changes — which have also
included the bolting of furniture to the floor in
more than 40 rooms in Row houses and the
closing of two rooms in Grove Lasuen — are
necessary to ensure safety.
But many students say the changes are
simply nuisances that signify a lack of trust in
students' ability to look out for themselves.
The stricter enforcement came after the
task of inspecting Stanford for fire safety was
assigned earlier this year to Santa Clara Coun
ty. Previously, the state fire marshal had been
responsible for monitoring compliance with
fire codes.
Officials say the new policy reflects a
greater effort to inspect buildings and enforce
existing fire codes, not a change in the codes
themselves.

"The fire code hasn't gotten any stricter,"
said Environmental Health and Safety Direc
tor Tom Mcßride. "The fact is that student
residences besides the high-rises hadn't been
routinely inspected in the past, and if they had
been, we would have found the same viola
tions."
Deputy Fire Marshal Joan Connolly, who
was placed in charge of inspecting Stanford
buildings in March, has focused on student
residences because "they have the highest
potential for hazard."
"I am obligated to enforce the codes that
apply. My goal is to achieve, at the very least,
a minimum standard of safety as dictated by
the codes," said Connolly.
Still, some students feel the precautions
are excessive. In Cowell Cluster, for exam
ple, workers tore down more than 120 per
manent lofts that had been part of the rooms
for years. The large size of the lofts and the
flammable carpeting that covered them were
the main reasons they were removed, said
senior Stephen Dorow, a resident assistant
in ZAP.
Senior Tien-Yi Lee, the house manager of

ZAP, said "Most people were pretty disap
pointed, because they made good use of the
lofts. It was almost like having a second floor.
. . . They told us last spring that they were
going to remove them, but I didn't think they
would actually do it."
Student Housing Operations manager
Rodger Whitney said the lofts were removed
because they were the most flagrant violation
of the fire codes on campus. The University
had been aware of the problem for some time,
he added.
According to Connolly, she did not order
the lofts removed. "I have never been in Cow
ell Cluster," she said. "The choice to take out
the lofts was entirely Stanford's policy."
She did close two rooms on the third floor of
Grove Lasuen because there is only one stair
case leading down from the floor. Fire regula
tions require at least two. The five students
who were originally assigned to the rooms
were relocated before the start of classes.
In other Row houses, people must pass
through students' rooms to access the fire
escapes. In these rooms, the furni
ture has been bolted to the floor to
ensure that exit routes remain
clear.
The only other alternative,
Connolly said, would have been to
close down the rooms with fire
escapes, a move that would have
resulted in a loss of housing.
COP member Beth Morgan, a
junior living in one of the rooms
with bolted furniture in Roth
house, said, "The bolted furniture
is annoying. They've bolted it in
weird places, and they never con
sulted us.
"I would have hoped that they
would explain the situation to stu
dents and trust them with the
responsibility of keeping their fur
niture in safe places," she added.
Some people have speculated
that the stricter enforcement is in
response to fires at UC-Berkeley
and San Jose State University in
which students were injured or
killed.
Connolly said Stanford would
be foolish not to learn from the
accidents at neighboring schools.
Whitney said the only poorly
handled aspect of the changes was
communication with students.
"Because of the time frame, we
didn't have much advance notice
in terms of informing students.
But we are meeting with the stu
dents now, and I'm sure they'll be
satisfied that the changes we
made weren't arbitrary."

Joan Connolly, deputy fire marshal of Santa Clara County, says
she is placing new emphasis on inspecting student residences
because "they have the highest potential for hazard."
