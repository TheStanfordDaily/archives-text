On tests, you probably
run equations over again to
make sure they're right. So
you're working harder.

and so many other smart
functions.
We've spent years with
students like you and edu
cators like your professors to
develop the TI-68 and the
TI-81. That's why they're so
highly recommended.
For engineering students,
The TI-68 solves up to five
simultaneous equations,
provides complex number
functions and offers formula
programming. That's power.
And for math and science
applications, the
TI-81 offers the
most compre
hensive, yet easy
to-use graphing
functions with ex
tensive program
ming capabilities.
Try a TI-68 or
TI-81 at your local
TI retailer today.
And start working
smarter, instead
of harder.
