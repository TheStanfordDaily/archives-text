# Student arraigned for statutory rape
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Stuart John Thomas, a former
Stanford basketball player and an
award-winning scholar athlete, was
arraigned yesterday in connection with
a reported sexual assault in a campus
dormitory.
Thomas, handcuffed and wearing a
bright orange prison uniform, appeared
in Palo Alto Municipal Court with his
lawyer, Melvin de la Motte of San Luis
Obispo, as new details were released
about the alleged assault.
Judge Charles Cory denied de la/
Motte's request to release Thomas on
his own recognizance, and also denied a
subsequent request to reduce Thomas'
$80,000 bail. Thomas remained in the
Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose as
of 11 p.m. yesterday.
Thomas, 23, is charged with one
count of unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor — commonly called statu
tory rape — and one count of furnish
ing alcohol to a minor.
After the proceeding, de la Motte
said Thomas plans to plead not guilty
to the two charges. Thomas is "abso
lutely innocent," de la Motte said. "No
question about it." He is scheduled to
enter the plea Monday at 1:30 p.m.
No charge of "forceable rape" has
been made against Thomas.
Statutory rape, in California law, is
defined as having sexual intercourse
with a minor under 18, with or without
consent. "Forceable rape" implies an
assault "by force, menace or duress,"
said Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri, who has investigated the case.
In his report to the district attorney
on his investigation, Frecceri recom
mended that Thomas be charged with
eight offenses, including forceable rape
"where a person is prevented from
resisting by any intoxicating substance."
Deputy District Attorney Cristina
Warsholski said, "We charged the
offenses that we thought were appropri

ate given the circumstances of the case."
The district attorney often issues
charges different than those recommend
ed by the investigating officer, she said.
The district attorney's decision is
"based on what we see as the facts in
the case," Warsholski said.
She would not comment on whether
additional charges may be filed against
Thomas.
The 6-foot-7-inch Thomas, a junior
sociology m{\jor, played for Stanford's
basketball team as a freshman in 1986-
87. He was returning to Stanford this
year after playing at the California
Polytechnic State University in San
Luis Obispo.

He was that team's most valuable
player in 1990 and 1991, and was
named the National Association of Bas
ketball Coaches Scholar/Athlete Player
of the Year for 1991.
Police report details alleged assault
Frecceri's report was made public
after the arraignment. It provided
details of the alleged assault and of a
conversation in which Thomas' resi
dent assistant warned him about giv
ing alcohol to minors.
The report was based on the vic
tim's account of the events and inter
views with other people.
The alleged assault "occurred some

time around 10:30 p.m., concluding
around midnight" last Sunday, the
report said.
Some time last Sunday evening the
woman, a 17-year-old freshman, and "a
couple of other students were invited
into the room" by Thomas, the report
said.
Thomas allegedly provided the stu
dents with alcohol, and "after the other
students left, Thomas closed the door
and proceeded to kiss and undress the
victim," according to the report.
The report claims that although the
woman "told the suspect that she had a
