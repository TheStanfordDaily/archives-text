# Student arraigned for statutory rape
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Stuart John Thomas, a former
Stanford basketball player and an
award-winning scholar athlete, was
arraigned yesterday in connection with
a reported sexual assault in a campus
dormitory.
Thomas, handcuffed and wearing a
bright orange prison uniform, appeared
in Palo Alto Municipal Court with his
lawyer, Melvin de la Motte of San Luis
Obispo, as new details were released
about the alleged assault.
Judge Charles Cory denied de la/
Motte's request to release Thomas on
his own recognizance, and also denied a
subsequent request to reduce Thomas'
$80,000 bail. Thomas remained in the
Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose as
of 11 p.m. yesterday.
Thomas, 23, is charged with one
count of unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor — commonly called statu
tory rape — and one count of furnish
ing alcohol to a minor.
After the proceeding, de la Motte
said Thomas plans to plead not guilty
to the two charges. Thomas is "abso
lutely innocent," de la Motte said. "No
question about it." He is scheduled to
enter the plea Monday at 1:30 p.m.
No charge of "forceable rape" has
been made against Thomas.
Statutory rape, in California law, is
defined as having sexual intercourse
with a minor under 18, with or without
consent. "Forceable rape" implies an
assault "by force, menace or duress,"
said Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri, who has investigated the case.
In his report to the district attorney
on his investigation, Frecceri recom
mended that Thomas be charged with
eight offenses, including forceable rape
"where a person is prevented from
resisting by any intoxicating substance."
Deputy District Attorney Cristina
Warsholski said, "We charged the
offenses that we thought were appropri

ate given the circumstances of the case."
The district attorney often issues
charges different than those recommend
ed by the investigating officer, she said.
The district attorney's decision is
"based on what we see as the facts in
the case," Warsholski said.
She would not comment on whether
additional charges may be filed against
Thomas.
The 6-foot-7-inch Thomas, a junior
sociology m{\jor, played for Stanford's
basketball team as a freshman in 1986-
87. He was returning to Stanford this
year after playing at the California
Polytechnic State University in San
Luis Obispo.

He was that team's most valuable
player in 1990 and 1991, and was
named the National Association of Bas
ketball Coaches Scholar/Athlete Player
of the Year for 1991.
Police report details alleged assault
Frecceri's report was made public
after the arraignment. It provided
details of the alleged assault and of a
conversation in which Thomas' resi
dent assistant warned him about giv
ing alcohol to minors.
The report was based on the vic
tim's account of the events and inter
views with other people.
The alleged assault "occurred some

time around 10:30 p.m., concluding
around midnight" last Sunday, the
report said.
Some time last Sunday evening the
woman, a 17-year-old freshman, and "a
couple of other students were invited
into the room" by Thomas, the report
said.
Thomas allegedly provided the stu
dents with alcohol, and "after the other
students left, Thomas closed the door
and proceeded to kiss and undress the
victim," according to the report.
The report claims that although the
woman "told the suspect that she had a

boyfriend, that she was only 17
and was a virgin ... he coerced her
into sexual intercourse, which
(the woman] said occurred twice."
In another page of the report,
Frecceri wrote that after inter
course Thomas proceeded "to per
suade the victim to orally copulate
him."
The report claims that he gave
the woman in less than two hours
"one-half can of beer and eight
drinks of Peppermint Schnapps."
The woman reportedly told Frec
ceri that she had drunk alcohol
only once before, about a year ago.
"The victim recalled asking
Stuart if he was trying to get her
drunk, but he told her that he was
not, and assured her that every
thing was OK," the report said.
"She remembers that she
didn't feel any pressure from the
suspect, and that he didn't make
any verbal threats to her as he
undressed her," the report said.
"However, she said, she felt a cer
tain coercion from Stuart's pres
ence, coupled with the fact that
her condition and judgment had
been impaired by alcohol."
The report continued, "She
also mentioned the manner in
which Stuart spoke to her as part
of the coercion, recalling that from
when he began providing her with
alcohol to when they were having
sexual intercourse, he kept saying
to her in a calm, soothing voice,
statements like, 'It's OK, you can
do what you want, no one has to
know, I won't hurt you,' among
other things."
The woman told police that
after the alleged assault — about

midnight — she went into the
bathroom. "She recalls sitting on
the floor and crying while several
women came to her aid," the
report said.
Report:
Thomas warned about alcohol
Frecceri's report also describes
a conversation in which Thomas'
resident assistant warned him
about the dangers of giving alco
hol to minors.
Chris Arriola, the RA, told Frec
ceri about the conversation Sept.
25. According to the report, when
Arriola met Thomas last Sunday
afternoon, "he had a beer in his
hand." When Arriola mentioned it,
Thomas replied, "Yeah, I'm
stocked" and said his refrigerator
was filled with at least one case of
beer and several bottles of liquor.
"Arriola said he discussed the
new alcohol policy with Thomas
and told Thomas that there was
going to be a crackdown on the use
of alcohol this year," the report
said.
It continued, "They discussed
the ramifications of providing
alcohol to minors. . . . Arriola told
him that he should be careful on
giving away alcohol. Arriola said
he was a little worried about
freshmen going out to frat parties;
especially since the theme of the
first frat party seemed to be to get
the freshmen women drunk and
take sexual advantage of them."
"Thomas agreed," the report
said, "saying that he used to be a
member of a frat."
Thomas then told Arriola,
according to the report, that he
thought it might be better "if
these girls get wasted and get
fucked during their first week
here at Stanford, so they learn not
to do it the rest of the time thev

are here."
According to the report, Arriola
told Frecceri "he was in disbelief
at that statement, but he thought
[Thomas] was kinda kidding, but
Thomas was not laughing. Arriola
said that he tried to interject the
difference between rape and con
sensual sex, but it seemed that
Thomas was not listening to him."
Thomas wrote to woman
In court yesterday, the judge
said he denied Thomas' requests
for reduced bail or release on his
own recognizance primarily
because Thomas apparently wrote
a letter to contact the woman after
the alleged assault.
The report said Thomas met
with Residence Dean Angela Rick
ford Sept. 24 and told her he
"couldn't let her (the victim) ruin
his life." Thomas told Rickford he
has a fiancee and plans to marry
her in April.
According to the report, Rick
ford "knows Stuart Thomas per
sonally. ... He asked if she could
help him to see the victim."
When Rickford denied Thomas'
request to see the woman, he gave
Rickford a letter written to the
woman and a picture of his
fiancee. On the envelope he wrote,
"Please read this and let me have
the picture of my fiancee back."
Rickford gave the letter to
Stanford Police, but it was not
included in their report. Rickford
said she did not know what
Thomas wrote in the letter.
During his conversation with
Rickford last Tuesday, the report
said Thomas "at first denied that he
had done anything wrong.... When
Mrs. Rickford insisted that Thomas
tell her the truth, he then put his
head in his hands, broke down and
admitted the offenses to her."
