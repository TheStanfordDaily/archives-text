# Chinese stowaway seeks asylum

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Chinese
pro-democracy activist sought political
asylum Wednesday after fleeing to the
United States as a stowaway on a ship
from Hong Kong.
"It feels good to be here," Ma Xin, 22,
said through an interpreter. "It's been a
busy morning."
Ma said he fled to Hong Kong fearing he
would be arrested for his work in the democ
racy movement. Threatening telephone calls
he received in Hong Kong prompted his
flight to the United States on Sept. 13.
In a letter to The Associated Press in
Hong Kong, Ma said he was a pro-democ
racy leader in Landzhou, a city in north

west China, where he attended the Gan
Shu Chinese Medical College.
Ma and his sister, Ma Yuan, 27, fled to Hong
Kong in September 1989, but they believed
agents from Beijing were tracking them.
He received phone calls in Hong Kong
from men who told him, "China was
watching me."
"That makes me afraid," he said.
"I'm not a famous dissident, I'm just a
medical student. These guys could kill
me or make me disappear and no one
would know the difference."
Ma Yuan, an engineer and computer
scientist, worked in a Chinese military
industrial factory in the city of Tianjin.
