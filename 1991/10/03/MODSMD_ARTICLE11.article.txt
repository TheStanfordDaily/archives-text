PITTSBURGH (AP) - Pres
ident Bush today defended his eco
nomic program and said exports
have "galvanized our economy"
even as he pledged to veto new
unemployment benefits to the
growing jobless population.
Bush, in a political speech to
boost the Senate candidacy of his
former attorney general, Dick
Thornburgh, said if he had more
Republicans like Thornburgh in
Congress, "our economic growth
package certainly wouldn't be gath
ering cobwebs on Capitol Hill."
Since the economic recovery
might not be as rosy as administra
tion economists had claimed, Bush

said, "We must build on our
strengths. In the last four years our
exports have increased nearly 57
percent, more than three times the
rate of import growth. Exports
have galvanized our economy."
He called anew for a cut in the
capital gains tax, which critics
attack as a boondoggle to the rich,
and plugged his plan for tenant
ownership of public housing.
Bush said that, if the Congress had
more members like Thornburgh,
"our crime bill wouldn't be sitting
around collecting dust, neither would
our civil rights bill, and our energy
package and our education strategy
and our transportation bill."
