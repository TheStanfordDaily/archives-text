The University's global
mission shouldn't stop
for the budget dilemma

A S STANFORD ENTERS ITS
/\ second century, much em
jLAphasis has been placed on
the globalization of the University.
As the Centennial's international
speakers highlighted, administra
tion officials have gone to great
lengths in stressing that Stanford
has begun down the path toward
becoming a true world university.
An important question to con
sider is how realistic is the goal of
going global? Given the current
budget constraints, should the
University look beyond its bound
aries and, further yet, beyond the
U.S. borders?
The sensible and intelligent
answer can only be yes.
While events in the world are
changing at a breathtaking pace
and are difficult to fit into a uni
fied picture, one thing holds true:
The international community
inexorably keeps moving closer.
Events in one country or region
often have profound, far-reaching
implications in regions halfway
around the globe.
Over the course of his tenure,
University President Donald
Kennedy has greatly increased
support for inter-disciplinary pro
grams, recognizing the fact that
many of today's problems are not
restricted to departmental bound
aries. Likewise, many problems
are no longer limited to national
boundaries. Such issues as migra
tion, economic development and
environmental protection require
international cooperation if any
solution is to be found.
Stanford's geographic location
on the edge of the Pacific Rim pre
sents it with the unique opportuni
ty to lead the academic and scien
tific world in the quest to find solu
tions to many of the world's prob
lems.
While bringing international

speakers to campus such as Cana
dian President Brian Mulroney
and Mexican President Carlos Sali
nas de Gortari indicates Stanford's
international prominence, it does
not represent the globalization of
the University. The true signs lie
deeper in the significant inroads
Stanford has made in this area.
Last year the University intro
duced the International Advisory
Council, consisting of some of the
world's great leaders, including for
mer President of France Valery Gis
card d'Estaing, Helmut Schmidt of
Germany and Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica. The council's goal is to advise
the Institute of International Stud
ies on ways Stanford researchers
can more effectively help with solu
tions to global problems.
While bringing prominent people
to campus is important, perhaps
even more important are Stan
ford's attempts to reach beyond its
borders and actually work in differ
ent regions of the world.
Most apparent are the overseas
campuses on three continents.
While the overseas program may
have to be scaled back because of
budget cutting, the foundations
for a global university with
branches throughout the world
are already in existence. Perhaps
students may someday be able to
enroll at Stanford overseas with
out first coming to the Farm.
Lesser known but equally vital
programs include the Medical
School's research of infectious dis
eases in Chappas, Mexico. At the
student level, both Volunteers in
Asia and Students for Eastern
European Democracy send stu
dents throughout the world to
teach English, a language crucial
for developing nations.
Since its inception 100 years ago,
Stanford has strived for nothing
but the best and, in so doing, suc
ceeded in building itself into a truly
extraordinary American university.
As Stanford proceeds into its
second century, administrators
must continue to keep ahead of the
educational standard and build
Stanford into an extraordinary
international university.
