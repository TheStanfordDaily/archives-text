Mexicans beware: Salinas attempts to squelch rights

AS A DOCTORAL STUDENT IN the
School of Education, I wanted to
celebrate the Stanford Centennial
with the University community. Howev
er, I could not join all the events of this
celebration without remembering what is
happening in the community I come from.
Stanford invited the Mexican Presi
dent, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, to be the
keynote speaker for the Monday morning
convocation. I am a foreign student here
from Mexico.
I am proud of my Mexican heritage,
but I am not proud that in Mexico human
rights are abused every day. People are
tortured and killed for expressing their
views and opinions. This fundamental
right to the democratic process is not
respected, and violence is used to repress
it in Mexico.

I went to the Hyatt Hotel as part of a
group of people invited to a meeting with
the Mexican President on Sunday,
September 29. Because in the United
States freedom of speech is a fundamen
tal right, three other Mexican students
and I held up signs asking to stop the
repression and human-rights abuses and
to have clean elections in Mexico.
We held the signs silently during the
president's speech. During the entire
speech, photographers and cameramen
that came with the president made sure
to record our faces in their films, as well
as our names. They approached us and
stood in front of us in a threatening and
intimidating manner. They did not hide
that they wanted to have information
about people who were exercising their
constitutional rights.

During the Monday convocation
speech by Salinas at Frost Amphithe
ater, more people joined in the opportu
nity to make public what is happening in
Mexico. Those people outside the
amphitheater holding banners about the
violence and the lack of democracy in
Mexico included Americans as well as
Mexican-Americans. Some of us were
allowed to go inside, and we again held
signs about the lack of democracy in
Mexico.
That Monday evening, a very good
friend invited me to attend the Stanford
Centennial Stadium Spectacular. As this
event was taking place, a very quiet plane
approached the Stadium. I noticed that
the plane displayed lights across the
wings forming words.
I watched the plane coming closer to

the Stadium, flying above us until I could
read the bright words across the wings.
The words that appeared one after the
other were: STOP TORTURE IN MEXI
CO, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL.
Those words I read in the sky stirred
emotions inside me to the point of bring
ing tears to my eyes. I realized both the
set of lights on the field and the ones in
the sky were meant for all of us, the Stan
ford community.
I believe when we left the stadium, we
took in our minds and in our hearts the
spirit of a community that had gathered
to celebrate the achievements of a great
university, but I also believe this commu
nity will not forget the meaning of the
lights in the sky.
