# Biddle should receive congratulations for his work at the Farm
## 
### 
I find it ludicrous that the Stanford
complement of officials, faculty, staff and
students is finding fault with Paul Bid
dle, Office of Naval Research (ONR) audi
tor, who has uncovered $200 million of
inappropriate charges to the federal gov
ernment.
In fact, Mr. Biddle should be com
mended for his efforts in uncovering
Stanford's inappropriate billings of its
overhead, research-unrelated costs to
the federal government for the past
decade. Not only did Stanford deceive
taxpayers and government, they also
provided a demoralizing example to stu
dents.
We can well understand why Stanford
is anxious to have Mr. Biddle removed

from his position as auditor. It is obvious
there has been very little accountability
for government funds received by Stan
ford. However, with Mr. Biddle's pres
ence, accountability of our tax dollars
seems to be a certainty.
This business of Stanford's improper
billing may be the tip of an iceberg.
Other areas of investigation should
include the biomedical research grants
funded by the government — an area
where an in-depth investigation is long
overdue.
Scrutinizing research grants and elim
inating the frivolous, unnecessary and
repetitive biomedical research would save
billions of our tax dollars, not only at
Stanford but at all research facilities
receiving government grants.
Our hats off to Mr. Biddle, ONR, and
those who support this ongoing investi
gation concerning misuse of government
funds.
