# Gays, Lesbians attempt to make world aware of their discontent
## 
### 
I write in response to those who find
fault with Tuesday's "loud" protesters. We,
as gay and lesbian citizens of California, do
not have freedom of speech in job inter
views or board rooms. We are faced every
day with the choice: Be honest about who
you are, and risk going nowhere with your
career, or be closeted in order to succeed.
Many of my business school classmates
chose the latter. Why does a Centennial
organizer claim that this issue has "noth
ing to do with Stanford?" Stanford itself
has an excellent non-discrimination poli
cy. The University's leaders should be in
the vanguard of this issue, not defending
a governor who caved in to political pres
sure from the extreme right wing.
Every group that has sought to be

included in our society has had to fight for
it — loudly. I stood quietly, in jacket and
tie, handing out a letter I had written to
the governor at the front entrance of the
Quad. Did the media pay attention to this
rational and "polite" protest? Reporters
rushed back and forth to catch the quick
sound-bites and photo opportunities.
That is why the "loud" protesters did
the right thing. Like good advertising,
good politics is most effective if it makes
prime time. The entire world now knows
that California lesbians and gays are not
going to shut up until we have all the
same rights as the rest of you.
