## Don't break up my family 
### 
Yom kippur was the other
week. This Day of Atonement —
the most solemn and holy day in
the Jewish year — is a traditional time of
fasting and contemplation when Jews
seek to atone for their sins of the past
year and begin the new one with hope
and dedication.
But before atonement must come
guilt. Jews like me spend all year avoid
ing going to temple or being active in the
Jewish community. We then spend the
day before Yom Kippur deciding whether
we'll atone for these sins by suffering
through an entire day of services. For us,
this day is known as Yom Angst.
I like to think of the Jewish people as a
family, and like every family we have our
problems. Yes, Uncle Jacob is more than a
little crazy. And no, I will never again eat
Grandma Agronick's borscht. But family
is family, and in spite of all the craziness
it is good to renew my ties now and again.
So this Yom Kippur I set aside my
anti-religious dogmatism, got my hair
cut, put on my best and only suit, drank
two glasses of wine to lower my risk of
heart disease and went to spend an
evening with my family.
At first, the evening wasn't so bad. The
Rabbi was funny, the songs were warm
and familiar, and I've always enjoyed talk
ing to my friends during silent medita
tion. But as the service was ending, one of
those crazy relatives got up to speak.
This particular family member, a rep

resentative from Hillel, rose to make a
few announcements. He told the congre
gation that Jews are a pluralistic people.
"We agree on some things and disagree
on others," he said. "Some of us love
George Bush and others hate him. Some
of us love Yitzhak Shamir and others
think less kindly of the man." He argued
that these disagreements are fine — they
are part of what it means to be Jewish.
He also argued that there are some
things all Jews agree upon. Among these is
the belief that anti-Semitism is an evil and
we must do all we can to protect Jews
around the world from those who would
harm us. He therefore implored each of us
to write and call our representatives in
Congress, asking that they not delay grant
ing Israel loan guarantees to help settle
Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union.
The man's point was subtle but
unmistakable: If you are against anti-
Semitism, you are against delaying the
loan guarantees. And if you are not
against the delay, well then, what more
need be said?
I was angry.
His logic connecting anti-Semitism
and the loan guarantees was absurd. I am
not against the delay, and I deeply resent
ed his implication that I am therefore
anti-Semitic. The politics of the loan are
complicated, and not really the point
here. The point is that this gentleman
from Hillel had the chutzpah to tell me
that I betrayed my family because of a

political choice I had made.
I was also saddened.
I don't enjoy watching my family act
so self-righteously. There is no High
Church in Judaism — nobody to tell you
what you must believe or how you must
act to be Jewish. The Torah does not tell
us which contemporary political deci
sions are best for Jewish people and
which are worst.
When making these decisions, we are
left only with our good intentions, our
limited abilities of reason and hopefully a
fair dose of skepticism. I did not mind the
speaker arguing that we follow a particu
lar path of political action. Families have
disagreements and all members have the
right to voice their opinions. But I went
to services to be with my family, not to be
told that my family membership depend
ed upon my political decisions.
This man was so convinced of the righ
teousness of his cause, and so angry at
those who disagreed with him, that he
was willing to stand as arbiter of who was
a true family member on the most holy
day of reconciliation.
