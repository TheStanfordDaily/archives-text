# Protesters boil over setback in gay rights
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Filled with hope and excitement,
Sairus Patel last week began construct
ing a banner for Gov. Pete Wilson's
visit. "Lead Us Into the 21st Century,"
it proclaimed. Patel never finished.
On Sunday, Patel heard that Wil
son had vetoed a bill to protect gays
and lesbians from discrimination in
the workplace. The co-director of
Queerland, a campus gay activist
group, was boiling mad.
"It was a sense that nothing was
going to be the same," Patel, a fifth
year senior, said. "I knew then protests
would become massive."
The veto came as a surprise to many
gays and lesbians across the state, who
had expected the governor to endorse
the bill, known as Assembly Bill 101,

later this week. His veto sparked a
demonstration here by more than 300
campus and Bay Area activists.
Protesters' chants of "Wilson's
gotta go" and "Shame" are now dis
tant echoes. But the ramifications of
Wilson's veto and Monday's protest
are far from certain.
Many people in the community said
the demonstration was not so much a
watershed in the campus gay-rights
movement as another spark for the
emerging gay voice here.
During the past year, members of
the gay and lesbian communities have
witnessed progress by the University
on gay-rights issues such as the
domestic partners policy, which per
mits gay and lesbian couples to live
together in married-student housing.
Despite the veto setback, Eleanor
Feingold, co-coordinator of the Les

bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, said Monday's protest was fur
ther evidence that the community is
becoming a more visible force.
According to Andy Lisac, a Stanford
staff member and co-founder of Out at
Stanford, an organization for campus
gay and lesbian staff and faculty, "It
was an expression of anger and a
recognition of humanity denied."
Patel said, "Lots of queers are get
ting pissed and don't want to be polite.
We won't just lie back and take it. If
someone gives us shit we are not going
to take it lying down. It's not just a
question of rights, it's a question of
cur humanity. We want the same
rights as everyone else."
But "the real work of ensuring
equality for gay and lesbian members
of the Stanford community is yet to
come," Lisac said.

One issue is benefits parity for
Stanford workers. Lisac said he
believes that a gap exists between gays
and their straight counterparts in
health and medical coverage, travel
insurance and access to University
facilities.
Lisac expressed disappointment
that the encounter between Wilson
and vocal activists was not used to
engage in constructive dialogue.
According to Lisac, alumni, University
personnel and students "don't get
together very often."
Still, others questioned whether a
Centennial event was the proper forum
to voice displeasure. Michael Jackson,
dean of students, said, "I certainly
don't think it was the proper venue."
The issue of the appropriateness of
the protest strikes at the heart of
the debate among gay and lesbian
groups and others in the campus
community over how best to
express minority voices.
Michael Goldstein's experience
Monday showed the failure of some
quiet protests to attract much
attention. Goldstein, who received
his MBA from Stanford in 1987,
paced in front of the east quad pass
ing out copies of a letter voicing his
displeasure with Wilson's decision.

Clad in gray pants and a blue
sports jacket, he tried to attract
members of the press, but was
largely ignored.
"My way is not exactly the best
kind of way to get coverage. The
cameras and reporters were looking
for the best pictures, the best scuf
fle," he said yesterday."In short,
it's a knife that cuts both ways."
"It's inappropriate that in cor
porate boardrooms and on job
interviews people who are gay or
lesbian must be silent," he said.
It is not yet clear how con
frontations with police have
affected opinions of gays and les
bians on campus. Feingold said

the LGBCC has heard nothing
but positive feedback.
In any case, many of the more
forceful protesters were from off
campus, said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. "A few
of the faces we recognized from
the riot in San Francisco."
Patel estimated that only one
quarter of the protesters had
Stanford ties.
Campus groups said they planned
for a more peaceful rally and admit
ted they were not prepared for the
swell of angry protesters who
descended on campus.
It is clear that the protest gave
the community exposure it would

not have had otherwise. "It was
an outlet," said Quang Nguyen, a
1990 graduate and a protester.
"If Wilson were at Stanford or
the Republican club in San Fran
cisco, the circumstances would
have been the same," he said. "It
was a question of taking action
now and looking at the conse
quences later."
Many protesters said they were
angered that Wilson called them
fascist. Patel and others say they
were exercising principles of free
speech. It is a practice his group
will continue, Patel said, but he
wouldn't say whether there will
be more protests.

going to be the same," Patel, a fifth
year senior, said. "I knew then protests
would become massive."
The veto came as a surprise to many
gays and lesbians across the state, who
had expected the governor to endorse
the bill, known as Assembly Bill 101,

later this week. His veto sparked a
demonstration here by more than 300
campus and Bay Area activists.
Protesters' chants of "Wilson's
gotta go" and "Shame" are now dis
tant echoes. But the ramifications of
Wilson's veto and Monday's protest
are far from certain.
Many people in the community said
the demonstration was not so much a
watershed in the campus gay-rights
movement as another spark for the
emerging gay voice here.
During the past year, members of
the gay and lesbian communities have
witnessed progress by the University
on gay-rights issues such as the
domestic partners policy, which per
mits gay and lesbian couples to live
together in married-student housing.
Despite the veto setback, Eleanor
Feingold, co-coordinator of the Les

bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, said Monday's protest was fur
ther evidence that the community is
becoming a more visible force.
According to Andy Lisac, a Stanford
staff member and co-founder of Out at
Stanford, an organization for campus
gay and lesbian staff and faculty, "It
was an expression of anger and a
recognition of humanity denied."
Patel said, "Lots of queers are get
ting pissed and don't want to be polite.
We won't just lie back and take it. If
someone gives us shit we are not going
to take it lying down. It's not just a
question of rights, it's a question of
cur humanity. We want the same
rights as everyone else."
But "the real work of ensuring
equality for gay and lesbian members
of the Stanford community is yet to
come," Lisac said.

One issue is benefits parity for
Stanford workers. Lisac said he
believes that a gap exists between gays
and their straight counterparts in
health and medical coverage, travel
insurance and access to University
facilities.
Lisac expressed disappointment
that the encounter between Wilson
and vocal activists was not used to
engage in constructive dialogue.
According to Lisac, alumni, University
personnel and students "don't get
together very often."
Still, others questioned whether a
Centennial event was the proper forum
to voice displeasure. Michael Jackson,
dean of students, said, "I certainly
don't think it was the proper venue."
The issue of the appropriateness of
the protest strikes at the heart of
the debate among gay and lesbian
groups and others in the campus
community over how best to
express minority voices.
Michael Goldstein's experience
Monday showed the failure of some
quiet protests to attract much
attention. Goldstein, who received
his MBA from Stanford in 1987,
paced in front of the east quad pass
ing out copies of a letter voicing his
displeasure with Wilson's decision.

Clad in gray pants and a blue
sports jacket, he tried to attract
members of the press, but was
largely ignored.
"My way is not exactly the best
kind of way to get coverage. The
cameras and reporters were looking
for the best pictures, the best scuf
fle," he said yesterday."In short,
it's a knife that cuts both ways."
"It's inappropriate that in cor
porate boardrooms and on job
interviews people who are gay or
lesbian must be silent," he said.
It is not yet clear how con
frontations with police have
affected opinions of gays and les
bians on campus. Feingold said

the LGBCC has heard nothing
but positive feedback.
In any case, many of the more
forceful protesters were from off
campus, said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. "A few
of the faces we recognized from
the riot in San Francisco."
Patel estimated that only one
quarter of the protesters had
Stanford ties.
Campus groups said they planned
for a more peaceful rally and admit
ted they were not prepared for the
swell of angry protesters who
descended on campus.
It is clear that the protest gave
the community exposure it would

not have had otherwise. "It was
an outlet," said Quang Nguyen, a
1990 graduate and a protester.
"If Wilson were at Stanford or
the Republican club in San Fran
cisco, the circumstances would
have been the same," he said. "It
was a question of taking action
now and looking at the conse
quences later."
Many protesters said they were
angered that Wilson called them
fascist. Patel and others say they
were exercising principles of free
speech. It is a practice his group
will continue, Patel said, but he
wouldn't say whether there will
be more protests.
