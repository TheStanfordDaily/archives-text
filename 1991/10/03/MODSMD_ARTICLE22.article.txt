## New Jack City Explosive Jennifer Jackson is newest Card volleyball star 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Just looking at her statistics you can
see the change. Last year, she hit .085
for the year — had 136 kills, 28 blocks
and 97 errors. In 1991 — only a third of
the way through the season — she
already has 75 kills, 11 blocks and only
19 errors with a .318 hitting percentage.
Jennifer Jackson has arrived.
"It's a change in my mental attitude,
not anything physical. . . I'm just happi
er," Jackson said.
Sitting in her dorm room on the floor
talking, Jackson looks happy. Her smile
is infectious, and she laughs a lot, espe
cially when talking about her newfound
attitude towards her sport.
"I've put volleyball in perspective in
that the only thing you can do is do your
best every day. I think that Stanford
students are perfectionists, and that can
work against you. I'm taking it one day
at a time, and the game is more fun
now," Jackson said.
For a time, the game was hardly fun.
She redshirted her freshman year with
a shoulder injury and was able to play
only against Washington State in 1989.
Then in 1990, she started the last 28
matches of the season, but her play was
inconsistent.
"I think I didn't have much confi
dence and not much experience on the
court. I knew I wasn't doing what I
knew I could do. I wasn't playing up to
my potential," Jackson said.
On top of coming back from her
shoulder injury, Jackson has another
strike against her — chronic tendinitis
in her left knee. Although you could
never tell from the way she plays, she
has to ice down her knee after every
match and go to therapy every day.
"My shoulder is no problem any more
— it's my knee. My knee is a daily thing.
[My] junior year it really became a prob
lem. I got pretty discouraged. One day
there's nothing, and the next day I ask
myself, 'Why am I playing a sport?'
"It [the tendinitis] bugs me some
times going up stairs, and always after

practice when I'm riding home before I
ice it down. You feel old," Jackson
explains.
Having her family so close in Moun
tain View has really helped her deal
with adversity.
"My family isn't athletic, but they
come to all the home games and I can
always talk to them after the game
when something has gone wrong. My
mom and dad have both been great for
that," Jackson said.
Has she ever thought about hanging
it all up?
"Even through all of my troubles, I
never thought of quitting. I felt discour
aged and lost, but I never wanted to
quit," she said.
Her smile brightened as she began to
talk of this year's successes.
"Now, volleyball is good and that
helps keep everything good. When I do
well in volleyball, it carries over into the
rest of my life," Jackson said.
If that's the case, then the rest of her
life must be going pretty well, because
Jackson's volleyball career has never
been better. She has become a real force

'It's a change in my
mental attitude, not
anything physical...
I'm just happier,'
— Jennifer Jackson

on the Cardinal team this year, adding a
consistency to the squad which had
been missing in the past.
"Jennifer is hitting amazingly well —
it's what we needed," teammate Amy
Cooper said.
Jackson has hit above .350 in her last
five matches and above .400 in two of
them, and she is second only to Cooper
in hitting percentage of the team's hit
ters. Jackson sees her better play as
only part of an overall improvement of
the team.
"I think now we're more balanced.
We used to just have the big names, and
we still rely on those three 1 Kristin
Klein, Bev Oden, and Cooperl complete
ly, but now there are other people carry
ing out their assignments really well. ..
. The whole team is just great," she said.
Her added presence at the hitter
position gives opposing teams some
thing extra to think about and makes it
harder for defenses to key on any one
player. Her addition to the Cardinal
arsenal makes the No. 1-ranked team's
chances of going all the way that much
more possible.
Looking toward the future, Jackson
plans to come back and be a big factor
next year as well.
"I want to play really badly. I feel like
I'm coming into my own. . . .so I'm not
going to quit now despite my knee prob
lems," Jackson said.
Jennifer Jackson is relaxed, happy,
and dangerous.
"I'm just not worried about other
peoples' expectations anymore," she
said.
But opponents had better be worried
about her.

"I've put volleyball in perspective in
that the only thing you can do is do your
best every day. I think that Stanford
students are perfectionists, and that can
work against you. I'm taking it one day
at a time, and the game is more fun
now," Jackson said.
For a time, the game was hardly fun.
She redshirted her freshman year with
a shoulder injury and was able to play
only against Washington State in 1989.
Then in 1990, she started the last 28
matches of the season, but her play was
inconsistent.
"I think I didn't have much confi
dence and not much experience on the
court. I knew I wasn't doing what I
knew I could do. I wasn't playing up to
my potential," Jackson said.
On top of coming back from her
shoulder injury, Jackson has another
strike against her — chronic tendinitis
in her left knee. Although you could
never tell from the way she plays, she
has to ice down her knee after every
match and go to therapy every day.
"My shoulder is no problem any more
— it's my knee. My knee is a daily thing.
[My] junior year it really became a prob
lem. I got pretty discouraged. One day
there's nothing, and the next day I ask
myself, 'Why am I playing a sport?'
"It [the tendinitis] bugs me some
times going up stairs, and always after

practice when I'm riding home before I
ice it down. You feel old," Jackson
explains.
Having her family so close in Moun
tain View has really helped her deal
with adversity.
"My family isn't athletic, but they
come to all the home games and I can
always talk to them after the game
when something has gone wrong. My
mom and dad have both been great for
that," Jackson said.
Has she ever thought about hanging
it all up?
"Even through all of my troubles, I
never thought of quitting. I felt discour
aged and lost, but I never wanted to
quit," she said.
Her smile brightened as she began to
talk of this year's successes.
"Now, volleyball is good and that
helps keep everything good. When I do
well in volleyball, it carries over into the
rest of my life," Jackson said.
If that's the case, then the rest of her
life must be going pretty well, because
Jackson's volleyball career has never
been better. She has become a real force

'It's a change in my
mental attitude, not
anything physical...
I'm just happier,'
— Jennifer Jackson

on the Cardinal team this year, adding a
consistency to the squad which had
been missing in the past.
"Jennifer is hitting amazingly well —
it's what we needed," teammate Amy
Cooper said.
Jackson has hit above .350 in her last
five matches and above .400 in two of
them, and she is second only to Cooper
in hitting percentage of the team's hit
ters. Jackson sees her better play as
only part of an overall improvement of
the team.
"I think now we're more balanced.
We used to just have the big names, and
we still rely on those three 1 Kristin
Klein, Bev Oden, and Cooperl complete
ly, but now there are other people carry
ing out their assignments really well. ..
. The whole team is just great," she said.
Her added presence at the hitter
position gives opposing teams some
thing extra to think about and makes it
harder for defenses to key on any one
player. Her addition to the Cardinal
arsenal makes the No. 1-ranked team's
chances of going all the way that much
more possible.
Looking toward the future, Jackson
plans to come back and be a big factor
next year as well.
"I want to play really badly. I feel like
I'm coming into my own. . . .so I'm not
going to quit now despite my knee prob
lems," Jackson said.
Jennifer Jackson is relaxed, happy,
and dangerous.
"I'm just not worried about other
peoples' expectations anymore," she
said.
But opponents had better be worried
about her.
