NOTESâ€” No. 1 Stanford (10-0) is the
tournament favorite but No. 11 New
Mexico (6-4) may test the Cardinal. San
Jose State (4-4) and Notre Dame (7-4)
are unranked. Look for Kristin Klein to
lead Stanford's attack. She was named
Pacific 10 Conference Player of the
Week last week based on a .301 hitting
percentage, 54 kills and 36 digs in three
games.
