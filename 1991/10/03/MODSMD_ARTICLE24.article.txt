# Armour plugs hole at flanker for Card

HE IS A CONSENSUS STUD
and one of the most highly
touted recruits in the
nation, but Saturday, Stanford's
Justin Armour emerged on the
Stanford sports scene without glit
ter, gloiy or Centennial cheer, but
with much surprise.
Armour, a 6-foot 6-inch, 208-
pound star-in-the-wings from Man
itou Springs, Colo., was expected to
red-shirt this year and play basket
ball for Coach Mike Montgomery.
Throw away that carefully-written
script.
Saturday at Stanford Stadium in
a 28-21 trouncing of Colorado, No.
3 was blocking the entire game for
the first time in his life, and he was
doing a pretty good job of it. But one
has to wonder why he was on the
field at all.
By playing against Colorado,
Armour threw away his football
red-shirt opportunity, and seriously
jeopardized his chances at con
tributing to the basketball team
this year.
But if Armour can help the foot
ball team in 1991,1 applaud Denny
Green's decision to put him on the
field. Green hasn't written off 1991
and started planning for the future.
He knows Stanford has a good team
now. Good aggressive move, Denny.
Stanford's flankers and quick
strike offense have been a big disap
pointment in the 1-2 season, and
Green is trying to make an improve
ment.
Fleet-footed and short-tem
pered starting flanker Jon
Pinckney has been a non-fac
tor in 1991, and quarterback Jason
Palumbis hasn't thrown a touch
down pass in three games. Pinck
ney's longest catch of the year is 11
yards, and he's averaging just 9.5
yards per catch. Against Washing
ton, he dropped a touchdown. In
the past two games he has a total of
two catches for 13 yards.
"We're still looking for more big
plays from the flanker position,"
said Green, who has substituted
David Calomese, Mike Cook and
Armour for Pinckney. "By USC, I
would like to have one guy as a
starter (at flanker) and one as a
back-up. Notre Dame plays more
man-to-man, so there should be
more opportunities for the flanker
to make big plays."
Armour played extensively at
flanker and as a third receiver
against Colorado, but was never

tribute to the football
team, and I think he

thrown the ball. He might see more
action this week.
"He (Armour) did a good job,"
said Stanford coach Denny Green.
"He played like he was confident,
and did a great job blocking down
field."
Armour played quarterback in a
wing-T formation at Manitou
Springs High School, in three sea
sons tallying a Superman-like
8,199 yards and 134 touchdowns
rushing and passing. In basketball
he averaged 26 points and 13.5
rebounds per game his senior year.
But now Armour is on a team with
eight quarterbacks and is one of
seven freshmen trying out for the
basketball team, so he's had to
make some adjustments and, like
most freshmen, decide what his
priorities are.
"Before I got here I was expect
ing to red-shirt (in football)," said
Armour, who was Colorado's best
prep player in both football and
basketball last year. "I had been
working with the receivers in prac
tice, and I guess the team had a
need. I was glad to get any college
experience, no matter where on the
field."
"Certainly things (with basket
ball) will change now," said Armour,
who is on a football scholarship.
"Anything is possible."
"My earlier comment to him had
been, if you have a chance to help
(the football team), then that's a
decision you have to make as a play
er," said Montgomery.
"He wanted to contribute to the
football team, and I think he saw the
opportunity."
The basketball team starts official
practice Oct. 15, and Armour doesn't
figure in the immediate plans.
"Realistically, he is now going to
be way behind (for basketball). He'll
miss both exhibition games and two
games before he even steps on the
floor. And to learn, it really is best to
start right at the beginning," said
Montgomery.
Armour's future with the basket
ball team is murky, but he has a
chance to contribute this week to a
second-straight stupendous Stan
ford upset. Go get 'em.
