The Cardinal continued their drive towards
gaining an NCAA tournament birth by playing
to an impressive 1-1 tie against Fresno State.
Stanford's squad had won four of their last
five games and were entering the match fresh
off a 4-1 upset of St. Maiy's.
Nonetheless, the team faced a formidable
opponent in the Bulldogs. Led by forward
Gerell Elliot, one of the nation's top scorers,
Fresno State boasted a seven game winning
streak and a No. 7 national ranking.

The two teams played a scoreless, uneventful
first half though the Cardinal received a scare
when a collision between goalkeeper Kyle Krpa
ta and a Bulldog player sent Krpata to the
ground. He returned to his feet several minutes
later and remained in the game, making sever
al key saves.
Stanford took the lead ten minutes into the
second period when freshman Ryan Collins
headed Jim Talluto's corner kick into the net
for Collins' third goal in two games.
The Cardinal clung to their 1-0 advantage
until Bulldog midfielder Sterling Wescott took a
pass from Elliot and drilled the ball into the
lower right corner of the Stanford goal, tying
the game with sixteen minutes remaining.
The two squads then battled through the
regulation period. Neither team was able to
score in the two fifteen-minute overtime peri
ods that followed.
"I thought we should have won. We had the
opportunities," said coach Colin Lindores.
"Fresno is a decent team but at home we should
win."
Krpata, who entered the game with a stingy
1.36 goals against average, agreed with his
coach's sentiments.
"We were the better team. We need to stop
this business of playing well and tying," he said.
Lindores admitted that his squad is making
some strides but believes it must continue to
search for consistency and character.
"We need to get mentally tougher. You don't
want to get too beautiful," he said.
The team next plays in the Stanford Cardinal
Classic this weekend. Though the teams partici
pating in the tournament are not of the same
caliber as Fresno State, the Stanford squad is
looking forward to some tough competition.
"There are some good teams, but I'm confi
dent in the team's chances. Hopefully, ve'll win
two this weekend," said team captain Rhett
Harty.
