# Group tries to save students

Fred Hartwick had known
too many people who died of
AIDS.
So last year he started teach
ing a course to get the word out
on AIDS prevention.
Hartwick, an associate direc
tor of the Development Office, is
one of several people on campus
who takes part in Stanford AIDS
Volunteer Educators, or Project
SAVE. The project sponsors dor
mitory programs on AIDS pre
vention, and runs a training
course for discussion leaders.
The dorm presentations,
called "AIDS 101," address
AIDS prevention the disease's
stages and what "safe sex" real
ly entails, Hartwick said.
Although many Stanford
students don't know anyone
who has AIDS, statistics show
that will probably change in five
years, Hartwick said.
"I try to make the presenta
tions humorous though the sub
ject is difficult," said Hartwick.

"What is most helpful to stu
dents is that I deal with those
questions that most people might
be embarrassed to ask about.
"It just makes sense to be
educated if you decide to become
sexually active," he said.
According to sophomore
Rachel Maddow, who completed
the training course last fall,
"We need something like Pro
ject SAVE when you consider
that people in our age group,
both straight and gay, have the
highest rate of increase of AIDS
infection."
Students involved in the pro
ject have also volunteered in dif
ferent health promotion pro
jects in the community. These
include awareness presenta
tions at local high schools, nee
dle exchange programs in East
Palo Alto and food delivery ser
vices to people who have AIDS.
"The big issue here is that
(Project) SAVE tries to educate
students about AIDS so that they
in turn can learn to speak about
it in a non-alienating way that

elicits not only a change in think
ing, but a change in behavior,"
said Maddow, who volunteers at
Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
The shop, which is run by
Project SAVE, sells a variety of
contraceptives and provides
information about AIDS pre
vention.
Sophomore Michelle Fried
land got involved in the project
after seeing "Common Threads,"
a documentary about the AIDS
Memorial Quilt. "The documen
tary really moved me by person
alizing the whole issue," she said.
"I think it can reach more people
than a factual presentation."
Hartwick said the two-unit
class he is teaching again this fall is
"not designed for learning detailed
scientific information about AIDS,
but more for learning about how it
affects all of our lives."
The course covers the ways
AIDS is transmitted, some sci
entific information about it,
related cultural and ethical
dilemmas and leadership, and
speech skills.
