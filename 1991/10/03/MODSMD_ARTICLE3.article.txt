# '20 alum recollects Stanford
## 
### Anna Buchmann 
While thousands of alumni
flocked to the Stanford campus
during the closing days of the
Centennial Celebration, Isabel
Rogers, Class of '20, enjoyed a
quiet weekend at her home in
Sacramento. At the age of 94,
Rogers — one of Stanford's oldest
living alumni — felt it would be
too difficult for her to attend the
festivities.
Rogers, however, has followed
Stanford's Centennial plans with
more than passing interest, and
naturally so — she and her fami
ly have been connected with the
University almost since its incep
tion.
Her father, Percy Young, stud
ied at Stanford from 1892-94.
Rogers was accepted at Stanford
in 1916 and received her bache
lor's degree in 1920.
Rogers' manner is gentle but
firm. She is eager to listen, but

authors.
willing to express her opinion.
And she is glad that the Centenni
al has given her the occasion to
reflect on her experiences at Stan
ford near the turn of the century.
She has also given some
thought to the 100 th anniversary
of the University — particularly
the "bad times" that the school
currently faces.
"I remember that President
[Donald] Kennedy, in one of his
speeches that I read, said that he
wanted to bring the undergradu
ates closer to the University," she
reflected.
"And all of a sudden I thought
to myself, that's what made Stan
ford alive. It was the undergradu
ate student body."
A native of Albany, Oregon,
Rogers had not originally intend
ed to apply to Stanford. She
attended the Miss Harkers' school
in Palo Alto when she was a
teenager to get the accreditation
she needed to attend Vassar.
While at the Miss Harkers'
school, though, she attended ser
vices in Memorial Church and
met some Encina men at "very
well-chaperoned" parties. "I got
to just be so fond of Stanford,"
Rogers said.

She soon told her parents she
intended to change her plans and
attend Stanford. "Of course, my
father was delighted," she said. "I
had no trouble convincing him
that I should go."
The admissions process at
Stanford, according to Rogers,
w&s rigorous in 1916. "It had high
standards. You had to take an
entrance examination."
Once accepted at Stanford, the
students were held to strict aca
demic criteria. "In the first year of
Stanford there was an English
course you had to take, and there
were one or two others depending
on your major you had to take in
order to stay," she said.
Rogers did not recall many aca
demic comparisons between Stan
ford and East coast schools. "I
don't think I ever thought about
it, because we were so enmeshed
in that little community."
If the students competed with
any university, it was "hateful old
Cal," she said.
Rogers pledged Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority in her freshman
year. She lived in a dormitory
with her sorority sisters, and
remembers the strength of the
Greek system.
She acknowledged that the fra
ternities and sororities were
exclusive, and remembers that at
one point the young Jewish
women at Stanford started their

own sorority because they could
not enter others.
Kappa Alpha Theta was, how
ever, partly responsible for intro
ducing the young woman to a
freshman from Los Angeles
named Bogart Rogers — the man
who would later become her hus
band.
Already an accomplished singer,
Rogers was "ordered" by the
upperclass sorority members to
audition for the Junior Opera, one
of the activities of Senior Week.
Bogart Rogers co-wrote the Junior
Opera.
She was cast as the female
lead. Titled "Pirate for a Day,"
the opera was, "a crazy thing [but
also] quite romantic," according
to Rogers.
She also remembers the chal
lenging intellectual environment
at Stanford. Department heads
frequently held coffee hours in
their homes to give the students
opportunities to discuss academic
subjects and current events.
Of course, Rogers said, discus
sions about World War I were
most common. She compared the
atmosphere at Stanford near the
turn of the century with more
recent controversy about United
States involvement in the Persian
Gulf War. "Men's minds were
starting to understand the coun
tries outside of the U.5.A.,"
Rogers said.

She recalled hearing heated
debates when walking by the
Men's Club — a forum for male
undergraduates — and engaged in
many such discussions in History
Corner herself.
The subjects were often "con
nected to or in opposition to what
was going on in the outside world.
... The young men were begin
ning to feel their oats. They either
wanted us to get into [World War
I] or didn't want us to get into it."
Despite the war, her studies at
Stanford were intensive. She
recalled days full of classes and
many hours spent in the library.
Rogers remembered Professor
Krievel, who taught medieval his
tory, as one of her finest instruc
tors. "He made history come
alive," she said. "He liked what he
was teaching, and he enjoyed
teaching people who were respon
sive." At times, he changed the
entire format of his class for his
students — an unusual teaching
method at that time.
Many of the male Stanford stu
dents were too young to join the
military. A University-sponsored
ambulance corps was created and
outfitted at Stanford, and was
later sent to France. Many of the
young men joined it as an alterna
tive to enlisting.
Her future husband, too, felt
strongly about the war. He and a
friend went to Canada after their

freshman year in 1917 and joined
the Royal Flying Corps. He was
subsequently transferred to the
Royal Air Force and fought in
Europe.
He sent many letters to Rogers
— letters which were often cen
sored by the government before
arrival, with portions crossed out
in heavy black pen. Rogers specu
lated that the censored portions
included military information.
Shortly after her graduation in
1920, she and Bogart, who had
just returned to the United
States, were married. Her hus
band worked as a reporter and
later became a producer for
Paramount Pictures.
Rogers has two children, five
grandchildren, and five great
grandchildren and is expecting
another great-grandchild in the
near future.
Above all else, Rogers remem
bers "the surroundings and the
beauty of the campus" at Stan
ford. The greatest advantage of
having attended Stanford is the
memory of the "closely-knit set of
rather dedicated undergraduates"
that comprised the student body.
