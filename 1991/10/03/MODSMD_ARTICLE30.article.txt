WELCOME, WELCOME AGAIN and
Thank God I'm finally back from Europe
and in the good ol' glorious U.S. of A.
again. That's right, U.S.A. all the way, baby. Stars
and Stripes, Red White and Blue, God Bless Amer
ica, Purple Mountains' Majesty Apple Pie and
Chevrolet. Let's Carve Reagan's Image on Mount
Rushmore. Damn, We Sure Whooped Those Com
mies This Summer, Hallelujah. Praise the Lord I
AM BACK and have a good 5,000 miles between
me and the nearest sniveling sissy Frenchman.

Gosh, I haven't been this excited since I heard
Keith Rabois was going to grad school here.
And oh, what a zany first two weeks it's been.
The year began with many questions: How would
an unFettered Admissions Office perform? . . .
Would Stern Food jokes wither and die now that
you paid for your crap lump by lump instead of in
bulk? . . . Would they bring back that smell in
White Plaza for the Scentennial?
But these matters were all pushed aside as Ori
entation kicked in. One day, all was quiet. The
next, large herds of clueless animals appeared
roaming the campus. "Tatanka! Tatanka!" Had
the Colorado Buffaloes arrived early? Nah, those
herds were just entire Freshman dorms checking
out their new home together ("how adorable!").
After a week, though, the frosh began to under
stand that packs of 52 might work for playing
cards but look damn ridiculous arriving at parties.
Sophomore do-gooders finally took off those
crusty REEEED shirts, and everything settled
down to business as usual.
For two days.
Then, of course, came . . . the Centennial
("This ain't any ol'") Celebration. It began with a
revue of past Gaieties, proving once and for all
that our grandparents in fact never were very
funny. Included was a preview from the upcoming
'91 performance, "Can't Say This (But Boy Can I
Mumble)."
Numerous convocations, discussions and
dances later, the BIG MOMENT finally came.
That's right: The Stanford Centennial Stadium
Spectacular. Ooooh, alliteration. That means it's
gotta be good, huh?
Alas, with such a diverse audience, composed of
alumni, children, townsfolk and — oh yes almost
forgot about 'em this weekend — students, only
three times could the entire audience come
together and act as one:
1) The cheer to beat the Irish this weekend, led
by Bob "Nyah Nyah Bill I've got hair and you
don't" Murphy;
2) A unified groan as it was announced that
James Galway would perform Bette Midler's
"Wind Beneath My Wings"; and
3) Trying to sing the "Oh-We-Oh" chant from
The Wizard of Oz, which came out sounding more
like the opening grunts to Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a
Prayer" than anything else.
Not that there weren't other moments of pure
unadulterated joy that wondrous night. As
Kennedy rattled off past presidents' names (Bran

Rob, a senior with sandy hair, wide, wet eyes and a fretful
laugh, has a problem. He smokes — and nobody likes it.
"You would just not believe how many people look at me like
I'm a criminal or something," he huffs, reclining in a chair out
side the Coffee House and wielding a mean Marlboro. "It's
crazy. Stanford students claim to be open-minded, but when
they see me walking around with a cigarette, they act like I
hacked their grandmother's legs off."
A little melodramatic, maybe, but not too far off. Lung can
cer and bad breath have convinced most people intelligent
enough to be at Stanford not to smoke, and the threat of sec
ond-hand smoke has stirred enough acrimonious bile to make
L life a little unoleasant for the few who do.

"Everyone's always telling me it's gross.
Or that I'm gross," says Melanie, a sopho
more, lurking at the edge of a crowd that

sways to a world beat at the Centenni
al festivities over the weekend.

"I tried to quit three times
just because of the hassle. I
mean, my roommate last year
112 a 1 mo nnf nf 112

used to lock me out ol the
room because she said I
smelled." She laughs, and
takes a drag on her Parlia
ment. "But I guess it hasn't
worked yet, huh?"
But even if Stanford smok

ers are a harried, dying breed,

they're also persistent and can usu
ally find a way to sneak a smoke in
peace.
Arlo, a junior, finds he spends "a lot of
time outside. Walking around, mostly,

Thank God for Harris
