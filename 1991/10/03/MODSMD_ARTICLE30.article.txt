WELCOME, WELCOME AGAIN and
Thank God I'm finally back from Europe
and in the good ol' glorious U.S. of A.
again. That's right, U.S.A. all the way, baby. Stars
and Stripes, Red White and Blue, God Bless Amer
ica, Purple Mountains' Majesty Apple Pie and
Chevrolet. Let's Carve Reagan's Image on Mount
Rushmore. Damn, We Sure Whooped Those Com
mies This Summer, Hallelujah. Praise the Lord I
AM BACK and have a good 5,000 miles between
me and the nearest sniveling sissy Frenchman.

Gosh, I haven't been this excited since I heard
Keith Rabois was going to grad school here.
And oh, what a zany first two weeks it's been.
The year began with many questions: How would
an unFettered Admissions Office perform? . . .
Would Stern Food jokes wither and die now that
you paid for your crap lump by lump instead of in
bulk? . . . Would they bring back that smell in
White Plaza for the Scentennial?
But these matters were all pushed aside as Ori
entation kicked in. One day, all was quiet. The
next, large herds of clueless animals appeared
roaming the campus. "Tatanka! Tatanka!" Had
the Colorado Buffaloes arrived early? Nah, those
herds were just entire Freshman dorms checking
out their new home together ("how adorable!").
After a week, though, the frosh began to under
stand that packs of 52 might work for playing
cards but look damn ridiculous arriving at parties.
Sophomore do-gooders finally took off those
crusty REEEED shirts, and everything settled
down to business as usual.
For two days.
Then, of course, came . . . the Centennial
("This ain't any ol'") Celebration. It began with a
revue of past Gaieties, proving once and for all
that our grandparents in fact never were very
funny. Included was a preview from the upcoming
'91 performance, "Can't Say This (But Boy Can I
Mumble)."
Numerous convocations, discussions and
dances later, the BIG MOMENT finally came.
That's right: The Stanford Centennial Stadium
Spectacular. Ooooh, alliteration. That means it's
gotta be good, huh?
Alas, with such a diverse audience, composed of
alumni, children, townsfolk and — oh yes almost
forgot about 'em this weekend — students, only
three times could the entire audience come
together and act as one:
1) The cheer to beat the Irish this weekend, led
by Bob "Nyah Nyah Bill I've got hair and you
don't" Murphy;
2) A unified groan as it was announced that
James Galway would perform Bette Midler's
"Wind Beneath My Wings"; and
3) Trying to sing the "Oh-We-Oh" chant from
The Wizard of Oz, which came out sounding more
like the opening grunts to Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a
Prayer" than anything else.
Not that there weren't other moments of pure
unadulterated joy that wondrous night. As
Kennedy rattled off past presidents' names (Bran

Rob, a senior with sandy hair, wide, wet eyes and a fretful
laugh, has a problem. He smokes — and nobody likes it.
"You would just not believe how many people look at me like
I'm a criminal or something," he huffs, reclining in a chair out
side the Coffee House and wielding a mean Marlboro. "It's
crazy. Stanford students claim to be open-minded, but when
they see me walking around with a cigarette, they act like I
hacked their grandmother's legs off."
A little melodramatic, maybe, but not too far off. Lung can
cer and bad breath have convinced most people intelligent
enough to be at Stanford not to smoke, and the threat of sec
ond-hand smoke has stirred enough acrimonious bile to make
L life a little unoleasant for the few who do.

"Everyone's always telling me it's gross.
Or that I'm gross," says Melanie, a sopho
more, lurking at the edge of a crowd that

sways to a world beat at the Centenni
al festivities over the weekend.

"I tried to quit three times

used to lock me out ol the
room because she said I
smelled." She laughs, and
takes a drag on her Parlia
ment. "But I guess it hasn't
worked yet, huh?"
But even if Stanford smok

ers are a harried, dying breed,

they're also persistent and can usu
ally find a way to sneak a smoke in
peace.

Thank God for Harris

ner, Wilbur, etc.), each successive
dorm squealed with delight. Alas, I
had to keep quiet, seeing he neglect
ed to mention the short-yet-touch
ing story of Herman Manzanita's
glorious reign.
David Packard, set to the wrong
rpm, stumbled through a half
minute autobiography in about
two-minutes' time. And of course
there was that gasp of disappoint
ment from the freshmen when they
realized that no, Joan Baez was not
doing a cover of Rod Stewart.
Trippin' Ted Koppel wrapped up
the evening by stating that despite
one hundred years of change at
Stanford, at least one thing has
remained a constant. "That god
awful hymn of ours," I assumed.
But no, it's the promise of a great
education. Whatever. The evening
closed with an equally god-awful,
syntho-pop, lip-synched version of
"All Right Now" ("All right —
Stanford! All right — Stanford! S-
T-A-N-F-O-R-D!" Prettv clever

lyrics, those. Sounded like it was
produced by the same team that
created that rip-roarin' "3-2-1 Con
tact" theme song).
And thus our glorious institu
tion entered its second century,
with swarms of patrons leaving our
stadium saying "What a cheese
fest" to one another.
Now, we must finally settle back
into our routine. The festivities are
over. The banners have all been
either taken down, or stolen. All the
alumni have left. All the parents
have left (if I'm being redundant,
please tell me).
But before we hit the books, I've
got a problem here. I've been living
at Stanford for three years with the
same false rumors and myths float
ing around. Well, I'm mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Yes, friends, it's time to .. . SHAT
TER THE STANFORD CLICHES.
And we'll start with the biggie:
Nobody dates at Stanford. Lies!
Lies! This rumor wasn't just here
to promote a "Centennial Celiba
tion" — it's been around for ages.
But don't ever let them tell you that
Stanford provides a eunuch college
experience.

Ask any guy on campus, and
he'll say he dates. Of course,
chances are he's talking about the
front pages of his term papers:
"See? Here's my last date, right
here — name's June. Quite a hot lit
tle number, huh? (just look at the
cleavage on that 3!) We had a lot of
font together, but, well, it was only a
one-time thing, if you know what I
mean...."
But, rest assured, "dating" and
"Stanford" are not oxymorons....
The only Oxy-moron around here is
the pimply-faced loser who stays
home Saturday nights playing
Tetris, perpetuating the myth.
Stern food tastes funny. Non
sense — How could it be funny and
Stern at the same time?
Events of the past year have tar
nished Stanford's reputation.
C'mon, what reputation? Most of
my friends still think I go to school
in Connecticut. Anyway, nothing
could ever touch the sacred name of
our dear old Scamford — er, Stan
fraud — uh, Stanford University.
The 'PC'battle rages on here. No
way, man. Macintosh won.
You're not a "true" Stanford
woman until you've been kissed by a

senior in the Quad. Alas, this tradi
tion suffers from the same horror
that turns skyscrapers into crap
and can make an audience die: reck
less editing. The original, recently
rediscovered tradition and, I might
add, the only one still worth its
weight in breath mints, actually
reads "... until you've been kissed
by a senior humor columnist in the
Quad." Trust me. I work for The
Daily. I know these things.
Nobody reads The Daily. C'mon,
give yourself more credit.
The Lemon Hi-C in the Coffee
House is actually a high-concentra
tion aphrodisiac. I'm not quite sure
how this one got started. Come to
think of it, I could just be trying to
fill up space.... Geez, I've gotta
stop making up these stories —
what do I look like? A rumor colum
nist?
The Stanford Band is cool. This
myth hurts most of all to dispel
("dis-spell? We're talking about the
Band, Chris, not the Yell-Lead
ers!"). Sure, you newcomers think
the Band is all right now (?), but
your opinions are bound to ripen
with age:
Freshman year: "Rah, the

Stanford Band is cool! See them run
around the field? They're so silly!
Ha Ha Ha funny Stanford Band!"
Sophomore year: "Well sure, the
Stanford Band is cool, I guess ...
but why do all the members I know
happen to be such dorks?"
Junior year: "Is the Band cool? I
dunno.... Are they actually trying
to form something out there on the
field?"
Senior year: "Get a clue, guys."
Over-the-hill Alumni with lots of
money to support useless organiza
tions: "Rah, the Stanford Band is
cool! See them run around the field?
They're so silly! Ha Ha Ha funny
Stanford Band!"
And there you go. Missed some
cliches? Not ready to part with them
yet? Don't worry! You can catch
these tired old lines — just like
every year, over and over again — at
November's Gaieties performance.

According to Harris standards, the
number of "true" Stanford women
on campus is holding steady at ...
zero. Chris would also like to point
out that there's a full moon due in
two weeks, and Joel Stein is only a
junior.

or just hanging out." He pauses,
and looks around from his perch on
the Court steps. "People
don't seem to mind as much when
you smoke outside, which is good,
because I don't want to bother any
body. I just want to kill myself, not
them."
Not all smokers become loners,
however. Some make day-to-day
life more tolerable by seeking out
more of their own kind.
"It's great, man," effuses Ron
nie, a sophomore. "I started hang
ing out at the Co Ho last year so my
dorm wouldn't (bother me) and I
met this guy who smokes, and we
drew together." He laughs, and
moves his cigarette from hand to
hand. "The room stinks already."
Melanie says she goes to a lot of
fraternity parties because "people
are much cooler there. It is really
mellow. There are usually five or
ten people out front smoking and
having a good time. We bond in a
big way."
Of course, there are a few brave
members of this underground cul
ture who just don't seem to care
what non-smokers think, do or say.
"It's totally my personal choice.
It's my lungs," says Sarah, a senior.
"If they don't Wee it, they don't
have to walk near me. One time
this guy came up to me in White
Plaza and started waving smoke
away, so I blew some in his face. He
seriously ticked me off, and there's
no reason I have to put up with
that. I'll smoke anywhere I want."
Not a woman to mess with,
apparently, but not entirely an
ogre, either — when pressed, Sarah
admits that she's trying to quit and
that she'll refrain from lighting up
if a friend asks her to. "I mean, it's
not worth losing a friend over. And

it's nothing to be proud of."
A point amply illustrated one
recent morning, when a woman
walking behind Memorial
Church, smoking, caught sight of
another smoker, walked up to
him, waved her cigarette like a
baton, and proclaimed "Wow! The
only other smoker on this cam
pus."
The man looked at her, looked
at his cigarette, shook his head
and walked away without
acknowledging her. As the
woman walked off toward the
clock tower, she took another pull
on her cigarette, but didn't seem
quite so happy about it anymore. 1

minute autobiography in about
two-minutes' time. And of course
there was that gasp of disappoint
ment from the freshmen when they
realized that no, Joan Baez was not
doing a cover of Rod Stewart.
Trippin' Ted Koppel wrapped up
the evening by stating that despite
one hundred years of change at
Stanford, at least one thing has
remained a constant. "That god
awful hymn of ours," I assumed.
But no, it's the promise of a great
education. Whatever. The evening
closed with an equally god-awful,
syntho-pop, lip-synched version of
"All Right Now" ("All right —
Stanford! All right — Stanford! S-
T-A-N-F-O-R-D!" Prettv clever

lyrics, those. Sounded like it was
produced by the same team that
created that rip-roarin' "3-2-1 Con
tact" theme song).
And thus our glorious institu
tion entered its second century,
with swarms of patrons leaving our
stadium saying "What a cheese
fest" to one another.
Now, we must finally settle back
into our routine. The festivities are
over. The banners have all been
either taken down, or stolen. All the
alumni have left. All the parents
have left (if I'm being redundant,
please tell me).
But before we hit the books, I've
got a problem here. I've been living
at Stanford for three years with the
same false rumors and myths float
ing around. Well, I'm mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Yes, friends, it's time to .. . SHAT
TER THE STANFORD CLICHES.
And we'll start with the biggie:
Nobody dates at Stanford. Lies!
Lies! This rumor wasn't just here
to promote a "Centennial Celiba
tion" — it's been around for ages.
But don't ever let them tell you that
Stanford provides a eunuch college
experience.

Ask any guy on campus, and
he'll say he dates. Of course,
chances are he's talking about the
front pages of his term papers:
"See? Here's my last date, right
here — name's June. Quite a hot lit
tle number, huh? (just look at the
cleavage on that 3!) We had a lot of
font together, but, well, it was only a
one-time thing, if you know what I
mean...."
But, rest assured, "dating" and
"Stanford" are not oxymorons....
The only Oxy-moron around here is
the pimply-faced loser who stays
home Saturday nights playing
Tetris, perpetuating the myth.
Stern food tastes funny. Non
sense — How could it be funny and
Stern at the same time?
Events of the past year have tar
nished Stanford's reputation.
C'mon, what reputation? Most of
my friends still think I go to school
in Connecticut. Anyway, nothing
could ever touch the sacred name of
our dear old Scamford — er, Stan
fraud — uh, Stanford University.
The 'PC'battle rages on here. No
way, man. Macintosh won.
You're not a "true" Stanford
woman until you've been kissed by a

senior in the Quad. Alas, this tradi
tion suffers from the same horror
that turns skyscrapers into crap
and can make an audience die: reck
less editing. The original, recently
rediscovered tradition and, I might
add, the only one still worth its
weight in breath mints, actually
reads "... until you've been kissed
by a senior humor columnist in the
Quad." Trust me. I work for The
Daily. I know these things.
Nobody reads The Daily. C'mon,
give yourself more credit.
The Lemon Hi-C in the Coffee
House is actually a high-concentra
tion aphrodisiac. I'm not quite sure
how this one got started. Come to
think of it, I could just be trying to
fill up space.... Geez, I've gotta
stop making up these stories —
what do I look like? A rumor colum
nist?
The Stanford Band is cool. This
myth hurts most of all to dispel
("dis-spell? We're talking about the
Band, Chris, not the Yell-Lead
ers!"). Sure, you newcomers think
the Band is all right now (?), but
your opinions are bound to ripen
with age:
Freshman year: "Rah, the

Stanford Band is cool! See them run
around the field? They're so silly!
Ha Ha Ha funny Stanford Band!"
Sophomore year: "Well sure, the
Stanford Band is cool, I guess ...
but why do all the members I know
happen to be such dorks?"
Junior year: "Is the Band cool? I
dunno.... Are they actually trying
to form something out there on the
field?"
Senior year: "Get a clue, guys."
Over-the-hill Alumni with lots of
money to support useless organiza
tions: "Rah, the Stanford Band is
cool! See them run around the field?
They're so silly! Ha Ha Ha funny
Stanford Band!"
And there you go. Missed some
cliches? Not ready to part with them
yet? Don't worry! You can catch
these tired old lines — just like
every year, over and over again — at
November's Gaieties performance.

According to Harris standards, the
number of "true" Stanford women
on campus is holding steady at ...
zero. Chris would also like to point
out that there's a full moon due in
two weeks, and Joel Stein is only a
junior.

or just hanging out." He pauses,
and looks around from his perch on
the Court steps. "People
don't seem to mind as much when
you smoke outside, which is good,
because I don't want to bother any
body. I just want to kill myself, not
them."
Not all smokers become loners,
however. Some make day-to-day
life more tolerable by seeking out
more of their own kind.
"It's great, man," effuses Ron
nie, a sophomore. "I started hang
ing out at the Co Ho last year so my
dorm wouldn't (bother me) and I
met this guy who smokes, and we
drew together." He laughs, and
moves his cigarette from hand to
hand. "The room stinks already."
Melanie says she goes to a lot of
fraternity parties because "people
are much cooler there. It is really
mellow. There are usually five or
ten people out front smoking and
having a good time. We bond in a
big way."
Of course, there are a few brave
members of this underground cul
ture who just don't seem to care
what non-smokers think, do or say.
"It's totally my personal choice.
It's my lungs," says Sarah, a senior.
"If they don't Wee it, they don't
have to walk near me. One time
this guy came up to me in White
Plaza and started waving smoke
away, so I blew some in his face. He
seriously ticked me off, and there's
no reason I have to put up with
that. I'll smoke anywhere I want."
Not a woman to mess with,
apparently, but not entirely an
ogre, either — when pressed, Sarah
admits that she's trying to quit and
that she'll refrain from lighting up
if a friend asks her to. "I mean, it's
not worth losing a friend over. And

it's nothing to be proud of."
A point amply illustrated one
recent morning, when a woman
walking behind Memorial
Church, smoking, caught sight of
another smoker, walked up to
him, waved her cigarette like a
baton, and proclaimed "Wow! The
only other smoker on this cam
pus."
The man looked at her, looked
at his cigarette, shook his head
and walked away without
acknowledging her. As the
woman walked off toward the
clock tower, she took another pull
on her cigarette, but didn't seem
quite so happy about it anymore. 1
I shouted out, "Who killed that Kennedy ?"
When after all, it was Y-A-C-H-T.

WELCOME, WELCOME AGAIN and

AM BACK and have a good 5,000 miles between
me and the nearest sniveling sissy Frenchman.

Gosh, I haven't been this excited since I heard
Keith Rabois was going to grad school here.
And oh, what a zany first two weeks it's been.
The year began with many questions: How would
an unFettered Admissions Office perform? . . .
Would Stern Food jokes wither and die now that
you paid for your crap lump by lump instead of in
bulk? . . . Would they bring back that smell in
White Plaza for the Scentennial?
But these matters were all pushed aside as Ori
entation kicked in. One day, all was quiet. The
next, large herds of clueless animals appeared
roaming the campus. "Tatanka! Tatanka!" Had
the Colorado Buffaloes arrived early? Nah, those
herds were just entire Freshman dorms checking
out their new home together ("how adorable!").
After a week, though, the frosh began to under
stand that packs of 52 might work for playing
cards but look damn ridiculous arriving at parties.
Sophomore do-gooders finally took off those
crusty REEEED shirts, and everything settled
down to business as usual.
For two days.
Then, of course, came . . . the Centennial
("This ain't any ol'") Celebration. It began with a
revue of past Gaieties, proving once and for all
that our grandparents in fact never were very
funny. Included was a preview from the upcoming
'91 performance, "Can't Say This (But Boy Can I
Mumble)."
Numerous convocations, discussions and
dances later, the BIG MOMENT finally came.
That's right: The Stanford Centennial Stadium
Spectacular. Ooooh, alliteration. That means it's
gotta be good, huh?
Alas, with such a diverse audience, composed of
alumni, children, townsfolk and — oh yes almost
forgot about 'em this weekend — students, only
three times could the entire audience come
together and act as one:
1) The cheer to beat the Irish this weekend, led
by Bob "Nyah Nyah Bill I've got hair and you
don't" Murphy;
2) A unified groan as it was announced that
James Galway would perform Bette Midler's
"Wind Beneath My Wings"; and
3) Trying to sing the "Oh-We-Oh" chant from
The Wizard of Oz, which came out sounding more
like the opening grunts to Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a
Prayer" than anything else.
Not that there weren't other moments of pure
unadulterated joy that wondrous night. As
Kennedy rattled off past presidents' names (Bran

Rob, a senior with sandy hair, wide, wet eyes and a fretful
laugh, has a problem. He smokes — and nobody likes it.
"You would just not believe how many people look at me like
I'm a criminal or something," he huffs, reclining in a chair out
side the Coffee House and wielding a mean Marlboro. "It's
crazy. Stanford students claim to be open-minded, but when
they see me walking around with a cigarette, they act like I
hacked their grandmother's legs off."
A little melodramatic, maybe, but not too far off. Lung can
cer and bad breath have convinced most people intelligent
enough to be at Stanford not to smoke, and the threat of sec
ond-hand smoke has stirred enough acrimonious bile to make
L life a little unoleasant for the few who do.

"Everyone's always telling me it's gross.
Or that I'm gross," says Melanie, a sopho
more, lurking at the edge of a crowd that

"I tried to quit three times
just because of the hassle. I

room because she said I

takes a drag on her Parlia

worked yet, huh?"

ers are a harried, dying breed,

they're also persistent and can usu
ally find a way to sneak a smoke in

these tired old lines — just like
every year, over and over again — at
November's Gaieties performance.

According to Harris standards, the
number of "true" Stanford women
on campus is holding steady at ...
zero. Chris would also like to point
out that there's a full moon due in
two weeks, and Joel Stein is only a
junior.

or just hanging out." He pauses,
and looks around from his perch on
the Court steps. "People
don't seem to mind as much when
you smoke outside, which is good,
because I don't want to bother any
body. I just want to kill myself, not
them."
Not all smokers become loners,
however. Some make day-to-day
life more tolerable by seeking out
more of their own kind.
"It's great, man," effuses Ron
nie, a sophomore. "I started hang
ing out at the Co Ho last year so my
dorm wouldn't (bother me) and I
met this guy who smokes, and we
drew together." He laughs, and
moves his cigarette from hand to
hand. "The room stinks already."
Melanie says she goes to a lot of
fraternity parties because "people
are much cooler there. It is really
mellow. There are usually five or
ten people out front smoking and
having a good time. We bond in a
big way."
Of course, there are a few brave
members of this underground cul
ture who just don't seem to care
what non-smokers think, do or say.
"It's totally my personal choice.
It's my lungs," says Sarah, a senior.
"If they don't Wee it, they don't
have to walk near me. One time
this guy came up to me in White
Plaza and started waving smoke
away, so I blew some in his face. He
seriously ticked me off, and there's
no reason I have to put up with
that. I'll smoke anywhere I want."
Not a woman to mess with,
apparently, but not entirely an
ogre, either — when pressed, Sarah
admits that she's trying to quit and
that she'll refrain from lighting up
if a friend asks her to. "I mean, it's
not worth losing a friend over. And

it's nothing to be proud of."
A point amply illustrated one
recent morning, when a woman
walking behind Memorial
Church, smoking, caught sight of
another smoker, walked up to
him, waved her cigarette like a
baton, and proclaimed "Wow! The
only other smoker on this cam
pus."
The man looked at her, looked
at his cigarette, shook his head
and walked away without
acknowledging her. As the
woman walked off toward the
clock tower, she took another pull
on her cigarette, but didn't seem
quite so happy about it anymore. 1
I shouted out, "Who killed that Kennedy ?"
When after all, it was Y-A-C-H-T.
— Stoning Roles, "Sympathy for the Donald "
WELCOME, WELCOME AGAIN and
Thank God I'm finally back from Europe
and in the good ol' glorious U.S. of A.
again. That's right, U.S.A. all the way, baby. Stars
and Stripes, Red White and Blue, God Bless Amer
ica, Purple Mountains' Majesty Apple Pie and

Rushmore. Damn, We Sure Whooped Those Com

AM BACK and have a good 5,000 miles between
me and the nearest sniveling sissy Frenchman.

Gosh, I haven't been this excited since I heard
Keith Rabois was going to grad school here.
And oh, what a zany first two weeks it's been.
The year began with many questions: How would
an unFettered Admissions Office perform? . . .
Would Stern Food jokes wither and die now that
you paid for your crap lump by lump instead of in
bulk? . . . Would they bring back that smell in
White Plaza for the Scentennial?
But these matters were all pushed aside as Ori
entation kicked in. One day, all was quiet. The
next, large herds of clueless animals appeared
roaming the campus. "Tatanka! Tatanka!" Had
the Colorado Buffaloes arrived early? Nah, those
herds were just entire Freshman dorms checking
out their new home together ("how adorable!").
After a week, though, the frosh began to under
stand that packs of 52 might work for playing
cards but look damn ridiculous arriving at parties.
Sophomore do-gooders finally took off those
crusty REEEED shirts, and everything settled
down to business as usual.
For two days.
Then, of course, came . . . the Centennial
("This ain't any ol'") Celebration. It began with a
revue of past Gaieties, proving once and for all
that our grandparents in fact never were very
funny. Included was a preview from the upcoming
'91 performance, "Can't Say This (But Boy Can I
Mumble)."
Numerous convocations, discussions and
dances later, the BIG MOMENT finally came.
That's right: The Stanford Centennial Stadium
Spectacular. Ooooh, alliteration. That means it's
gotta be good, huh?
Alas, with such a diverse audience, composed of
alumni, children, townsfolk and — oh yes almost
forgot about 'em this weekend — students, only
three times could the entire audience come
together and act as one:
1) The cheer to beat the Irish this weekend, led
by Bob "Nyah Nyah Bill I've got hair and you
don't" Murphy;
2) A unified groan as it was announced that
James Galway would perform Bette Midler's
"Wind Beneath My Wings"; and
3) Trying to sing the "Oh-We-Oh" chant from
The Wizard of Oz, which came out sounding more
like the opening grunts to Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a
Prayer" than anything else.
Not that there weren't other moments of pure
unadulterated joy that wondrous night. As
Kennedy rattled off past presidents' names (Bran

Rob, a senior with sandy hair, wide, wet eyes and a fretful
laugh, has a problem. He smokes — and nobody likes it.
"You would just not believe how many people look at me like
I'm a criminal or something," he huffs, reclining in a chair out
side the Coffee House and wielding a mean Marlboro. "It's
crazy. Stanford students claim to be open-minded, but when
they see me walking around with a cigarette, they act like I
hacked their grandmother's legs off."
A little melodramatic, maybe, but not too far off. Lung can
cer and bad breath have convinced most people intelligent
enough to be at Stanford not to smoke, and the threat of sec
ond-hand smoke has stirred enough acrimonious bile to make
L life a little unoleasant for the few who do.

"Everyone's always telling me it's gross.
Or that I'm gross," says Melanie, a sopho
more, lurking at the edge of a crowd that

ers are a harried, dying breed,

they're also persistent and can usu

ner, Wilbur, etc.), each successive
dorm squealed with delight. Alas, I
had to keep quiet, seeing he neglect
ed to mention the short-yet-touch
ing story of Herman Manzanita's
glorious reign.
David Packard, set to the wrong
rpm, stumbled through a half
minute autobiography in about
two-minutes' time. And of course
there was that gasp of disappoint
ment from the freshmen when they
realized that no, Joan Baez was not
doing a cover of Rod Stewart.
Trippin' Ted Koppel wrapped up
the evening by stating that despite
one hundred years of change at
Stanford, at least one thing has
remained a constant. "That god
awful hymn of ours," I assumed.
But no, it's the promise of a great
education. Whatever. The evening
closed with an equally god-awful,
syntho-pop, lip-synched version of
"All Right Now" ("All right —
Stanford! All right — Stanford! S-
T-A-N-F-O-R-D!" Prettv clever

lyrics, those. Sounded like it was
produced by the same team that
created that rip-roarin' "3-2-1 Con
tact" theme song).
And thus our glorious institu
tion entered its second century,
with swarms of patrons leaving our
stadium saying "What a cheese
fest" to one another.
Now, we must finally settle back
into our routine. The festivities are
over. The banners have all been
either taken down, or stolen. All the
alumni have left. All the parents
have left (if I'm being redundant,
please tell me).
But before we hit the books, I've
got a problem here. I've been living
at Stanford for three years with the
same false rumors and myths float
ing around. Well, I'm mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Yes, friends, it's time to .. . SHAT
TER THE STANFORD CLICHES.
And we'll start with the biggie:
Nobody dates at Stanford. Lies!
Lies! This rumor wasn't just here
to promote a "Centennial Celiba
tion" — it's been around for ages.
But don't ever let them tell you that
Stanford provides a eunuch college
experience.

Ask any guy on campus, and
he'll say he dates. Of course,
chances are he's talking about the
front pages of his term papers:
"See? Here's my last date, right
here — name's June. Quite a hot lit
tle number, huh? (just look at the
cleavage on that 3!) We had a lot of
font together, but, well, it was only a
one-time thing, if you know what I
mean...."
But, rest assured, "dating" and
"Stanford" are not oxymorons....
The only Oxy-moron around here is
the pimply-faced loser who stays
home Saturday nights playing
Tetris, perpetuating the myth.
Stern food tastes funny. Non
sense — How could it be funny and
Stern at the same time?
Events of the past year have tar
nished Stanford's reputation.
C'mon, what reputation? Most of
my friends still think I go to school
in Connecticut. Anyway, nothing
could ever touch the sacred name of
our dear old Scamford — er, Stan
fraud — uh, Stanford University.
The 'PC'battle rages on here. No
way, man. Macintosh won.
You're not a "true" Stanford
woman until you've been kissed by a

senior in the Quad. Alas, this tradi
tion suffers from the same horror
that turns skyscrapers into crap
and can make an audience die: reck
less editing. The original, recently
rediscovered tradition and, I might
add, the only one still worth its
weight in breath mints, actually
reads "... until you've been kissed
by a senior humor columnist in the
Quad." Trust me. I work for The
Daily. I know these things.
Nobody reads The Daily. C'mon,
give yourself more credit.
The Lemon Hi-C in the Coffee
House is actually a high-concentra
tion aphrodisiac. I'm not quite sure
how this one got started. Come to
think of it, I could just be trying to
fill up space.... Geez, I've gotta
stop making up these stories —
what do I look like? A rumor colum
nist?
The Stanford Band is cool. This
myth hurts most of all to dispel
("dis-spell? We're talking about the
Band, Chris, not the Yell-Lead
ers!"). Sure, you newcomers think
the Band is all right now (?), but
your opinions are bound to ripen
with age:
Freshman year: "Rah, the

Stanford Band is cool! See them run
around the field? They're so silly!
Ha Ha Ha funny Stanford Band!"
Sophomore year: "Well sure, the
Stanford Band is cool, I guess ...
but why do all the members I know
happen to be such dorks?"
Junior year: "Is the Band cool? I
dunno.... Are they actually trying
to form something out there on the
field?"
Senior year: "Get a clue, guys."
Over-the-hill Alumni with lots of
money to support useless organiza
tions: "Rah, the Stanford Band is
cool! See them run around the field?
They're so silly! Ha Ha Ha funny
Stanford Band!"
And there you go. Missed some
cliches? Not ready to part with them
