# A 						twisted look at Saturday morning

Before 1 knew better, I thought ani
mated films were no more than cute lit
tle cartoons like "Looney Toons" or
even "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
Then, last year, a friend dragged me to
Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation.
No, I learned, animation is not just
cutesy 'toons; it is a fine art.
But that's not the whole story. There
is a sick and twisted side to everything.
Spike and Mike's latest production,
the "All Extra-Sick and Twisted Festival
of Animation," offers the adventurous
viewer over 20 animated films. Most of
these could never be shown in a normal
festival. Disturbingly violent, outrageous
ly pornographic or just plain strange,
these cartoons are not for children.

They are, however, for avid anima
tion buffs and typical college students.
More precisely, anyone who takes plea
sure in watching "Faces of Death' Mike
movies, reading the Marquis de Sade or
laughing at the vulgarities of mankind
will get a kick out of this show.
Of all the films, my personal favorite
is David Anderson's "Deadsy." The ani
mation, combining real-image-based
animation and stop action "wire
mation," is truly spectacular. I was also
impressed by the intensely twisted and
symbolically conveyed motif of a psy
chotic's development.
The most outrageous features of the
festival come from Mike Grimshaw.
"Quiet Please" and a new edition to the
show, "Deep Sympathy," both left me
wide-eyed and in disbelief. I suppose I

enjoyed them both, but I'm afraid to
understand just why. Describing these
two films would be nearly impossible,
but as Grimshaw explained "Deep Sym
pathy" in a surprise appearance at the
festival, "Necrophilia means never hav
ing to say sorry." As you may imagine,
these two features are definitely sick
and twisted.
A bit on the lighter side is Bill
Plympton's "One of those Days."
Plympton, famous for anti-smoking
cartoons and other animation shown at
ASSU Sunday Flicks and on MTV, goes
all out in this cartoon. I cringed as if
someone were relentlessly describing
sliding down a razor-blade bannister.
John Magnuson's "Thank You
Masked Man" provides the Festival
with a hilarious spoof, calling into ques
tion why the Lone Ranger never
accepts gifts and exactly how and why
he befriended Tonto and Tonto's horse.
The voices of some characters may be
difficult to understand, but the effort is
worth it.
Another centerpiece of the festival is
"Pink Komkommer," the latest produc
tion from the famous animator Marv
Newland. In "Pink Komkommer,"
eight skillful animators offer different
interpretations of a single, sleazy
soundtrack. Although a bit lengthy and
slightly overdone at times, this film
successfully incorporates each artist's
exceptional animation.

Marv Newland's contributions to
the Festival also include the short but
famous "Bambi Meets Godzilla" and a
production of Danny Antonucci's wide
ly-popular "Lupo the Butcher."
The remainder of the show consists
of animated shorts with such provoca
tive titles as "In Bred Jed's Cartoon,"
"One Man's Instrument," "Bladder
Trouble" and "Hello Dad, I'm in Jail."
Though the show is not for everyone
(barf bags complete with "vomit glos
saries" were handed out before the
show), I can't help but recommend the
"All Extra-Sick and Twisted Festival of
Animation" as a necessary collegiate
experience. The animation is fantastic,
and the ideas are interminably twisted.
Moreover, the entire event is embedded
in one of two rowdy atmospheres,
either San Francisco's Palace of Fine
Arts or UC-Berkeley's Wheeler Audito
rium.
