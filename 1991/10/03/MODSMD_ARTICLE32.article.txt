# A
						twisted look at Saturday morning

Before 1 knew better, I thought ani
mated films were no more than cute lit
tle cartoons like "Looney Toons" or
even "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
Then, last year, a friend dragged me to
Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation.
No, I learned, animation is not just
cutesy 'toons; it is a fine art.
But that's not the whole story. There
is a sick and twisted side to everything.
Spike and Mike's latest production,
the "All Extra-Sick and Twisted Festival
of Animation," offers the adventurous
viewer over 20 animated films. Most of
these could never be shown in a normal
festival. Disturbingly violent, outrageous
ly pornographic or just plain strange,
these cartoons are not for children.

They are, however, for avid anima
tion buffs and typical college students.
More precisely, anyone who takes plea
sure in watching "Faces of Death' Mike
movies, reading the Marquis de Sade or
laughing at the vulgarities of mankind
will get a kick out of this show.
Of all the films, my personal favorite
is David Anderson's "Deadsy." The ani
mation, combining real-image-based
animation and stop action "wire
mation," is truly spectacular. I was also
impressed by the intensely twisted and
symbolically conveyed motif of a psy
chotic's development.
The most outrageous features of the
festival come from Mike Grimshaw.
"Quiet Please" and a new edition to the
show, "Deep Sympathy," both left me
wide-eyed and in disbelief. I suppose I

enjoyed them both, but I'm afraid to
understand just why. Describing these
two films would be nearly impossible,
but as Grimshaw explained "Deep Sym
pathy" in a surprise appearance at the
festival, "Necrophilia means never hav
ing to say sorry." As you may imagine,
these two features are definitely sick
and twisted.
A bit on the lighter side is Bill
Plympton's "One of those Days."
Plympton, famous for anti-smoking
cartoons and other animation shown at
ASSU Sunday Flicks and on MTV, goes
all out in this cartoon. I cringed as if
someone were relentlessly describing
sliding down a razor-blade bannister.
