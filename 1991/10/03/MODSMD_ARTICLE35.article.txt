## 'Illusions' stretch time 
### Val Masters 
Nothing sells more albums
than controversy, and with its
history of misogyny, racism and
riots, Guns 'n' Roses is no
stranger to controversy. Ulti
mately though, it is music that
maintains sales, and the music on
"Use Your Illusion I & II" is both
abundant and uneven.
If, in fact, controversy was all
it took to sell music, then the Sex
Pistols' "Never Mind the Bol
locks" would have outsold
Michael Jackson's "Thriller," and
Madonna would have outsold
everyone else put together. For
tunately, this is not true.
Two and a half hours of G 'n' R
may prove unwieldy for many
consumers and a sales liability for
both albums. Had the band culled
one album's worth of material
and kept to a unifying theme the
way "Appetite for Destruction"
was held together by midwestern
er Rose's fear and loathing of city
life, the results would have been a
guaranteed smash.
Both "Illusion" albums are
somewhat similar to the Stones'
double album "Exile on Main
Street" with their sprawling,
bluesy, sometimes murky sound,

and this comes as a departure
from the group's multi-layered,
razor-sharp debut "Appetite for
Destruction." Between the two
new albums, "Use Your Illusion
II" is clearly more focused and
the stronger of the two.
From its opening song, "Civil
War," "Use Your Illusion II"
demonstrates better songwriting
and a more harmonious sound to
which the band has added key
boardist Dizzy Reed. Even Axl
Rose, whose tendency to screech
consistently mars songs like
"Yesterdays," manages to keep
his voice in the lower register.
Rose's lyrics and his penchant
for writing hate-filled songs are
slightly watered down over the
course of these two albums, but
both "Get in the Ring" and

"Shotgun Blues" curdle maniacally
with vengeful anger.
"Get in the Ring" should also
bring a hefty libel suit against the
band from Spin Magazine's publish
er Bob Gucionne Jr., who along
with several other magazine editors
is berated with lewd suggestions
and 12 letter words.
Oddly enough, however, it's
rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin's 44 14
Years" which provides the second
album's finest moment. Stradlin, an
avowed Keith Richards disciple,

sings four songs and wrote or co
wrote 12 of the albums' 30 songs.
Were it not for Slash's impres
sive slide guitar and one searing solo
after another, Stradlin's singing
and songwriting might be a true
show-stealing hat trick. Stradlin,
who tours on a separate bus, is
apparently dissatisfied with the tour
life, and rumors circulate that he
may be replaced with Jane's Addic
tion guitarist Dave Navarro.
Also dissatisfying is the way "Use
Your Illusion I" walks a fme line
between rough-hewn and down
right shoddy. Roses's vocals are vir
tually unlistenable on "Right Next
Door to Hell," "Perfect Crime" and
Paul McCartney's "Live and Let

Die." His habit of swallowing
words and whole sentences com
bined with disjointed, nonsensical
lyrics ruins much of the first
album.
But "Illusion I" is by no means a
washout. "Double Talkin' Jive,"
"Dead Horse" and "Bad Obses
sion" drip with rootsy, mid-'7os,
Aerosmith-like swagger and indi
cate that G 'n' R aspire to greater
heights than one-dimensional hard
rock. Like "Estranged" and the
less successful "Coma" and "Loco
motive," all songs that break the
eight-minute barrier, "November
Rain" reaches for a plateau upon
which sit '70s classics like Lynyrd
Skynyrd's "Freebird" or Elton

John's "Funeral for a Friend/Love
Lies Bleeding."
While all the aforementioned G
'n' R songs reflect Rose's outspo
ken admiration for Elton John and
feature ample piano sections inter
twined with Slash's fluid guitar
melodies, the songs fail to build
evenly and end up merely long
rather than progressively layered.
Industiy sources show sales of
both albums to be tremendous,
with "Illusion II" outselling the
first. However, at the writing of
this column, both albums will only
have been out three weeks, and it
may take some headlines and
Rose's volatile self-promotion to
provide G 'n' R with dual smashes.
