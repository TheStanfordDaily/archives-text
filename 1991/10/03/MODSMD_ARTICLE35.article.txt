## 'Illusions' stretch time 
### Val Masters 
Nothing sells more albums
than controversy, and with its
history of misogyny, racism and
riots, Guns 'n' Roses is no
stranger to controversy. Ulti
mately though, it is music that
maintains sales, and the music on
"Use Your Illusion I & II" is both
abundant and uneven.
If, in fact, controversy was all
it took to sell music, then the Sex
Pistols' "Never Mind the Bol
locks" would have outsold
Michael Jackson's "Thriller," and
Madonna would have outsold
everyone else put together. For
tunately, this is not true.
Two and a half hours of G 'n' R
may prove unwieldy for many
consumers and a sales liability for
both albums. Had the band culled
one album's worth of material
and kept to a unifying theme the
way "Appetite for Destruction"
was held together by midwestern
er Rose's fear and loathing of city
life, the results would have been a
guaranteed smash.
Both "Illusion" albums are
somewhat similar to the Stones'
double album "Exile on Main
Street" with their sprawling,
bluesy, sometimes murky sound,

and this comes as a departure
from the group's multi-layered,
razor-sharp debut "Appetite for
Destruction." Between the two
new albums, "Use Your Illusion
II" is clearly more focused and
the stronger of the two.
From its opening song, "Civil
War," "Use Your Illusion II"
demonstrates better songwriting
and a more harmonious sound to
which the band has added key
boardist Dizzy Reed. Even Axl
Rose, whose tendency to screech
consistently mars songs like
"Yesterdays," manages to keep
his voice in the lower register.
Rose's lyrics and his penchant
for writing hate-filled songs are
slightly watered down over the
course of these two albums, but
both "Get in the Ring" and
