# Toad the Wet Sprocket gets lucky
## 
### Joe Pigato 
Toad the Wet Sprocket is a
success story for the music
purist.
Teenagers from sleepy, coastal
Santa Barbara, Toad created
compelling, personal music from
their earliest days of playing.
After two years, no big contract
was in sight, but the group
refused to change their music to
gain more listeners. Instead, they
put their best music on a self
recorded album, "Bread and Cir
cus." Then a rare thing in the
music business occurred; most
every major record label came
seeking an unknown local band.
The interest of the major
recording labels was intensified
by Toad's second self-recorded
album, "Pale." In the end, a con
tract with Columbia Records was
signed. MTV videos and national
tours with the B-52s and Michael
Penn followed as listeners from
Los Angeles to New York were
converted to loyal fans.
Yet Columbia wanted more for
this promising group, so they
sent them to their own elaborate
studio. Though Toad's third
album on Columbia's label, it was
the first recorded by Columbia.
How did Toad respond? With
"Fear," their third and best
album.
Improving on two impressive
albums, Toad utilizes their
recording facilities well in per
fecting a collection of well-writ
ten songs. Toad bassist Dean Din
ning said Toad's trademark, a
moody sound with introspective
lyrics, remains intact, but the
new album is also more experi
mental and upbeat. Dinning also
credited lead singer and lyricist,
Glen Phillips, with some of his
best songwriting.

As on their past albums, the
group does not shy away from
dealing with real, substantial
issues. On "Hold her down," the
band touches on the subject of
date rape. Dinning said the group
was able to attempt such mes
sages in their songs because their
music is superficially pleasing to
the crowds who do not bother to
listen to the lyrics. For example,
one of their most requested dance
songs was "One Little Girl" — a
song about child abuse.
On "Stories I Tell," Phillips
alludes to the songs he writes as
expressions of art, intended for

genuine music listeners: "Don't
ask me questions or I will retreat/
Fame is a cancer and ego its seed/
Now I wasn't looking for heaven
or hell/ Just someone to listen to
stories I tell." Pointed, disturbing
and draining, this song marks the
power of the band's music, as well
as their commitment to the music
itself.
As elusive, national fame now
teases them in its nearness, Toad
the Wet Sprocket remains a gen
uine rock band, unsure of their
future. Their potential is vast, as
their music evidences, but in the
capricious and often vapid rock

world, talent doesn't ensure suc
cess. So the group concentrates
on their music and waits for their
music to continue spreading.
Underneath all of the uncer
tainty, however, the talented
group, the enthusiastic record
label and the loyal fans all indi
cate the underground swelling
suggests something special.
Instead of passively waiting
until everyone knows who Toad
is, go see the group this Sunday,
Oct. 6 at the Edge, and make
them your own discovery. If noth
ing else, you will enjoy some of
the best music in rock today.
