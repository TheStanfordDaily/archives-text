# Artsy and lively? Whoa â€” down, Simba, down
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
Like the Stanford Shopping Center,
the University's Lively Arts program is a
non-student stronghold on our campus.
Even if we could spare the green stuff that
every mall-going matron and lively arts
patron flaunts, don't we have better ways
to spend our time?
Maybe. There's always studying and
partying to do, but there isn't always a
world-famous artist performing on your
doorstep. And the variety of this year's
artists almost ensures that one of them
will put on a show you'll like.
As for the money, act now and receive
half back. Yes, half! Tell your resident
assistants which tickets you want before
the date of the first show, Oct. 11, and
they will get you special student rates on
tickets to shows for which such discounts
are available. It's a bargain.
Shows are at Memorial Auditorium
unless otherwise indicated.

Kodo will bang their little hearts out for you in their Jan. performance.
Like the Stanford Shopping Center,
the University's Lively Arts program is a
non-student stronghold on our campus.
Even if we could spare the green stuff that
every mall-going matron and lively arts
patron flaunts, don't we have better ways
to spend our time?
Maybe. There's always studying and
partying to do, but there isn't always a
world-famous artist performing on your
doorstep. And the variety of this year's
artists almost ensures that one of them
will put on a show you'll like.
As for the money, act now and receive
half back. Yes, half! Tell your resident
assistants which tickets you want before
the date of the first show, Oct. 11, and
they will get you special student rates on
tickets to shows for which such discounts
are available. It's a bargain.
Shows are at Memorial Auditorium
unless otherwise indicated.
Friday, Oct. 11,8 p.m.

tuoso whose students, the Beatles, could
only hallucinate about matching his skill.
