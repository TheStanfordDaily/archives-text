# New album by 'A Tribe Called Quest' is smooth like butter
## 
### Cheo Coker 
On their album "Fear of a Black
Planet," Public Enemy asked the
question "Who Stole the Soul?" If
pop rappers stole it, then A Tribe Called
Quest just reclaimed it.
Just in time to stop real hip-hop from
suffocating in the wake of pop drivel by
the likes of Vanilla Ice, Gerardo and M.C.
Hammer, these rappers from New York
City have saved the day with the funkiest
album to slide down the chute since
Brand Nubian's "One For All."
"The Low End Theory," the group's
sophomore effort, is nothing short of a
hip-hop masterpiece. The record is pro
duced by Q-Tip, "The Abstract Poet,"
Phife and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad,
and the beats are rugged with a capital R.
This 14-track musical sojourn con
tains the perfect mix of guttural break
beats, unique samples and live acoustic
bass lines, courtesy of veteran Jazz
bassist Ron Carter. Instead of simply
regurgitating the offbeat, riddle filled,
slow grooved formula of the group's first
album, "People's Instinctive Travels and

the Paths of Rhythm," the Questers have
decided to live up to thier name and blaze
new trails.
By working with A musician of
Carter's stature, they take their
music, and rap in general, to new
heights by reclaiming and redefining jazz
within hip-hop. Despite taking rap in a
new direction, the Tribe still lends
homage to the music's "Old School" roots
by using a lot of loose, yet hard edged call
and-response rhymes on the album.
A thumping, polyrhythmic acoustic
bass line introduces "Excursions," the
first cut on the album. Q-Tip, with his
customary silver-tongued smoothness,
deftly slips his rhyme in and out of Ron
Carter's finger work, pulling the listener
deeper into the musical labyrinth. Once
the beat kicks in 30 seconds later, pro
pelling the track into full swing, the por
tal closes, and there's no escape from the
musical journey in progress.
Although the second and third songs
are strong, the album doesn't begin to
realize its potential until the fourth
track, "Butter." Phife, whose rhyme

skills were greatly overshadowed by Q-
Tip's on "People's," finally finds his
niche. He kicks hard, confident rhymes
like "You wanna be treated right/ see
Father M.C./ Or check Ralph Tresvant/
for Sensitivity" The song features a pul
sating bell-riddled drum track, an ear
catching horn sample and an irresistible
chorus by Q-Tip which repeats the lines:
"It's like butter, baby. It's like butter."
"Butter" melts into "Verses From the
Abstract," easily the smoothest rhyme
since Rakim's verse on "Mahogany." Q
tip's delivery on this tune lends validity
to the notion that the word rap really
stands for Rhythmic American Poetry;
his lyrics and style ascend to another
level of artistry. He flips acrobatic lyrics
like "The world is kinda cold, and the
rhythm is my blanket/Wrap yourself up
in it, If you love it then you'll thank it."
Though fun and funkiness are the
major concerns of this album's
musical escapade, the Tribe also
manages to work in important social and
musical commentary. "Show Business,"
featuring Lord Jamar and Sadat (formerly

Derek) X of Brand Nubian tells of the
downside of the Rap industry, where in
many cases, marketability rather than
music ability has become the most impor
tant factor.
"The Infamous Date Rape" is a mes
sage to the fellas to step off if the vibes
ain't right — i.e., consent is the key.
"Everything is Fair," a tale about a female
drug dealer, reasserts the fact that dealing
is done more out of necessity than desire.
Their message may be less overt than Pub
lic Enemy's, but no less important.
Where most groups would run out of
steam, the Tribe keeps innovating. "Check
the Rhime," "Jazz" and "Scenario," on the
LP's second half, close the gap between
hip-hop and jazz. These tunes are jazz-like
in the way that their organization is free
enough to allow for individual improvisa
tion, yet constructed in such a way so that
each individual part interacts and builds
upon the song as a whole.
"Check The Rhime" features Q-tip and
Phife reminiscing about the old days of rap
where playground jams, not stadiums,
were the rule.

On "Jazz," Tip and Phife weave in and
out of the rhythms and each other's
rhymes in the same way in which Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie once did. Such
artistry proves the link between be-bop
and hip-hop that Q-Tip alludes to in
"Excursions" goes much deeper than a
similarity between the two names.
The final track, "Scenario," featuring
the well-named Leaders of the New
School, is slammin' beyond descrip
tion. This song should be heard if for noth
ing more than to hear Busta Rhymes from
Leaders of the New School say, "Wrragh,
Wrragh like a Dungeon Dragon."
In an era where pop, R & B, gangsta
and sex rule rap, "The Low End Theory"
is a breath of fresh air. A Tribe Called
Quest is a group that cares too much
about musical integrity to resort to gim
mickry. The album is testimony that rap is
as diverse as any other genre of music.
Hopefully, during a time when club, radio
or video play has become more crucial
than innovation, "The Low End Theory"
will be appreciated now — and not just 20
years in the future.

sage to the fellas to step off if the vibes
ain't right — i.e., consent is the key.
"Everything is Fair," a tale about a female
drug dealer, reasserts the fact that dealing

Their message may be less overt than Pub

Where most groups would run out of
steam, the Tribe keeps innovating. "Check
the Rhime," "Jazz" and "Scenario," on the
LP's second half, close the gap between
hip-hop and jazz. These tunes are jazz-like
in the way that their organization is free
enough to allow for individual improvisa
tion, yet constructed in such a way so that
each individual part interacts and builds
upon the song as a whole.
"Check The Rhime" features Q-tip and
Phife reminiscing about the old days of rap
where playground jams, not stadiums,
were the rule.

On "Jazz," Tip and Phife weave in and
out of the rhythms and each other's
rhymes in the same way in which Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie once did. Such
artistry proves the link between be-bop
and hip-hop that Q-Tip alludes to in
"Excursions" goes much deeper than a
similarity between the two names.
The final track, "Scenario," featuring
the well-named Leaders of the New
School, is slammin' beyond descrip
tion. This song should be heard if for noth
ing more than to hear Busta Rhymes from
Leaders of the New School say, "Wrragh,
Wrragh like a Dungeon Dragon."
In an era where pop, R & B, gangsta
and sex rule rap, "The Low End Theory"
is a breath of fresh air. A Tribe Called
Quest is a group that cares too much
about musical integrity to resort to gim
mickry. The album is testimony that rap is
as diverse as any other genre of music.
Hopefully, during a time when club, radio
or video play has become more crucial
than innovation, "The Low End Theory"
will be appreciated now — and not just 20
years in the future.
On their album "Fear of a Black
Planet," Public Enemy asked the
question "Who Stole the Soul?" If
pop rappers stole it, then A Tribe Called
Quest just reclaimed it.
Just in time to stop real hip-hop from
suffocating in the wake of pop drivel by
the likes of Vanilla Ice, Gerardo and M.C.
Hammer, these rappers from New York
City have saved the day with the funkiest
album to slide down the chute since
Brand Nubian's "One For All."
"The Low End Theory," the group's
sophomore effort, is nothing short of a
hip-hop masterpiece. The record is pro
duced by Q-Tip, "The Abstract Poet,"
Phife and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad,
and the beats are rugged with a capital R.
This 14-track musical sojourn con
tains the perfect mix of guttural break
beats, unique samples and live acoustic
bass lines, courtesy of veteran Jazz
bassist Ron Carter. Instead of simply
regurgitating the offbeat, riddle filled,
slow grooved formula of the group's first
album, "People's Instinctive Travels and

the Paths of Rhythm," the Questers have
decided to live up to thier name and blaze
new trails.
By working with A musician of
Carter's stature, they take their
music, and rap in general, to new
heights by reclaiming and redefining jazz
within hip-hop. Despite taking rap in a
new direction, the Tribe still lends
homage to the music's "Old School" roots
by using a lot of loose, yet hard edged call
and-response rhymes on the album.
A thumping, polyrhythmic acoustic
bass line introduces "Excursions," the
first cut on the album. Q-Tip, with his
customary silver-tongued smoothness,
deftly slips his rhyme in and out of Ron
Carter's finger work, pulling the listener
deeper into the musical labyrinth. Once
the beat kicks in 30 seconds later, pro
pelling the track into full swing, the por
tal closes, and there's no escape from the
musical journey in progress.
Although the second and third songs
are strong, the album doesn't begin to
realize its potential until the fourth
track, "Butter." Phife, whose rhyme

skills were greatly overshadowed by Q-
Tip's on "People's," finally finds his
niche. He kicks hard, confident rhymes
like "You wanna be treated right/ see
Father M.C./ Or check Ralph Tresvant/
for Sensitivity" The song features a pul
sating bell-riddled drum track, an ear
catching horn sample and an irresistible
chorus by Q-Tip which repeats the lines:
"It's like butter, baby. It's like butter."
"Butter" melts into "Verses From the
Abstract," easily the smoothest rhyme
since Rakim's verse on "Mahogany." Q
tip's delivery on this tune lends validity
to the notion that the word rap really
stands for Rhythmic American Poetry;
his lyrics and style ascend to another
level of artistry. He flips acrobatic lyrics
like "The world is kinda cold, and the
rhythm is my blanket/Wrap yourself up
in it, If you love it then you'll thank it."
Though fun and funkiness are the
major concerns of this album's
musical escapade, the Tribe also
manages to work in important social and
musical commentary. "Show Business,"
featuring Lord Jamar and Sadat (formerly

Derek) X of Brand Nubian tells of the
downside of the Rap industry, where in
many cases, marketability rather than
music ability has become the most impor
tant factor.
