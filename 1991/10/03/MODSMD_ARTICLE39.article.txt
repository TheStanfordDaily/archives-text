## 'Paradise' a good flick, but a sad time 
### Laura Bialis 
Paradise, New York — the setting of the
movie "Paradise" — is not exactly paradise.
Although the scenery is beautiful, the peo
ple living in this simple town are extremely
lonely. This theme of loneliness makes for a
good reflective movie, but is not entertain
ing.
"Paradise," which was adapted from a
French movie entitled "Le Grand Chemin,"
is centered around an idea of loneliness and,
as one would expect, is a rather depressing
film. It seems to be a teaching film —
reminding us to be less self-centered when
others need us. It also shows the openness
of childhood, making us realize that chil
dren often see more than adults.
The movie is like a deep work of litera
ture — there are many psychological themes
and messages to analyze. It is difficult to
label this picture by genre; the only way to
describe it is as a psychological journey.
Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith gave
great performances, showing that they are
not always Sonny Crocket and "Working
Girl." Johnson played a stubborn and cyni
cal husband to Griffith's numb shell of a
human being. And Elijah Wood was amaz
ing, making you wonder how child actors
can work with such complicated messages
and plot themes.
There is a subliminal back-to-nature feel
ing, suggesting that when people are
depressed, they like to be alone with animals
and trees. But you are awakened to the fact
that animals and trees are really not very
good when it comes to needing a hug.
If you like to see deep movies with themes
relating to the meaning of life, you might
enjoy this one. But if you are into comedies,
"Paradise" just isn't your type of entertain
ment.

In their new movie, "Paradise," Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith
star as a couple living in a small town in New York state. Here, as in
the rest of the movie, Johnson and Griffith do their best to look as
non-Hollywood as possible.
