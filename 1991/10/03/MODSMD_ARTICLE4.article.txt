# Faculty baffled by budget

Faculty members went back to the class
room last night to get up to speed on the details
of the University's budget-cutting plans and
discuss priorities for the process.
The faculty questions showed "that none of
us understand the issues surrounding the bud
get," said one professor. "We are like indulged
children of well-to-do parents who never ask
questions about money."
As a condition of the open forum, Faculty Sen
ate Chair James Sheehan said the press could not
attribute quotes to members of the audience.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare began the
forum with a 45-minute presentation explain
ing the budget crisis to the 200 faculty mem
bers in attendance.
Zare is the chair of the Faculty Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholarship at Stan
ford — the faculty body advising the Universi
ty cabinet on the budget reductions.
Unlike last week's senate meeting, the
forum was rarely confrontational, and Zare
was widely hailed for his candid explanation of
budget issues.
But several faculty members questioned the
way the University defines the operating bud
get, saying that more funds from the endow
ment and Centennial contributions should be
committed to the operating budget.
One professor suggested that funds from
the non-operating part of the overall budget —
which includes restricted research funds and
Shopping Center profits — could be used to
alleviate the operating budget deficit.
Zare admitted he did not "fully understand"
all of the budget issues but promised to "look
for answers" in preparation for the second
forum tonight.
Several faculty criticized the committee's
preliminary recommendation that graduate
students replace lecturers in many undergrad
uate courses — particularly the Cultures, Ideas
and Values sequence and Freshman English.
The proposal has been supported by the
committee because it may save money on lec
turer salaries as well as provide much-needed
graduate student income.
"To diminish that program's excellence by
getting rid of lecturers will be a disaster," said
one professor to scattered applause.
Philosophy Prof. Michael Bratman, chair of
the committee's task force on undergraduate
education, defended the recommendation,
which is likely to be debated further at today's
senate meeting.
"This is inevitably the issue when you have
a crisis and you have to make some judgments
among good things," he said.
Another faculty open forum will be held
tonight in Annenberg Auditorium at 8 p.m.
The ASSU has also planned a student town
meeting in Cubberley Auditorium at 7 p.m.
