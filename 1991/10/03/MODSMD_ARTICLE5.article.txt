# Alumni notice change on Stanford campus
## 
### Clea Shannon 
Amid all of the activities and
classes that were planned for
them, many of the 13,000 alumni
who returned for the Centennial
Finale had their minds on some
thing else â€” how Stanford has
changed since they were here last.
To many, the physical changes
on campus were the most obvi
ous. The drought, earthquakes
and need for expansion have all
left their mark.
"I guess what strikes you first
are the new buildings," said
James Rowles, Class of 1966. "It
is very impressive what they've
built up . . . but it seems as if
there is a new danger of over
development and management of
space."
But "it's nice that they kept
the traditional buildings," he
added. "They give the campus
some continuity."
Information Systems Prof.
Thom Massey, who graduated in
1969, said, "Many of the alumni...
noticed that there are many more
buildings. And these are recent
graduates, five years out, who are

witnessing the big growth. . .."
While some alumni were disap
pointed by their lack of interac
tion with students, many said
they were impressed with Stan
ford's diversity.
"The composition of the stu
dent body has radically [andj
greatly changed. It's a tremen
dous change," said Bill Brandom,
Class of 1951.
C.B. Stephenson, who graduat
ed in 1958, said, "When you look
around the campus, it's quite
obvious what a multicultural,
pluralistic society Stanford has
become, particularly when you
look at the influx of Asian-Ameri
cans."
Many alumni also noted the
greater opportunities that women
at Stanford have today than in
the past. Lorraine Bayuk, who
received a doctorate from Stan
ford in biological sciences in 1957,
said she was pleased to see women
play an increased role on campus.
"There were few significant
positions for women" in 1957, she
said.
