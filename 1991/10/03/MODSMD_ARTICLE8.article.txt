Gorbachev to review 'refusenik's
MOSCOW (AP) — President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev agreed Wednesday to review the
cases of 355 "refuseniks" who have been denied
Soviet permission to emigrate, the head of a
U.S. committee on Soviet Jewry said.
Gorbachev also acknowledged that anti-
Semitism was a problem in the Soviet Union,
although not a "deep-rooted" one, and he
refused to issue a statement condemning it
specifically, said Shoshana Cardin, leader of the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry.
The conference said 186,815 Jews emigrated
from the Soviet Union last year, most to Israel.
The Soviet Union has some 3 million Jews.
GM executives unload stock
DETROIT (AP) — Top-ranking General Motors
Corp. executives, including Chairman Robert
Stempel, sold thousands of shares of stock
shortly before the price fell by more than 3 per
cent, the company acknowledged Wednesday.
GM, the world's largest automaker, denied
any wrongdoing.
It confirmed that Stempel sold 12,800 shares
of GM common stock at $40.88 a share and
9,850 shares of GM Class E stock at $51.38 a
share on Aug. 7. Combined, the sales brought
Stempel slightly more than $1 million.
GM also confirmed that stock sales on Aug. 2
brought Executive Vice President William E.
Hoglund $401,800 and Vice Chairman John F.
Smith Jr. about $39,750.
In a statement Wednesday, GM said "to infer
that there was any wrongdoing is totally irre
sponsible."
Sonny for Senate, babe
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sonny Bono, opening
himself wide to one-liners from the late-night talk
show comics, has entered the race for U.S. Senate.
"It's no joke," the mayor of Palm Springs
said Tuesday in announcing his candidacy for
the Republican nomination.
"I may have to wear that Sonny and Cher
thing for a while, but I'll overcome that. I just
think that if I talk to people, I'll overcome that."
