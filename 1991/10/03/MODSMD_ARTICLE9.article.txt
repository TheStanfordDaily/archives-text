PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The nation's
army chief on Wednesday said the military would
hand over power to Parliament, but warned ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide not to attempt a
return from exile.
Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras also claimed he and others
had protected Aristide from rank-and-file soldiers
who staged the Monday coup, which is believed to
have claimed more than 100 lives.
Aristide — who accused Cedras of leading the coup
and called him "power mad" — flew from Venezuela
to Washington to urge the United States and other
members of the Organization of American States to
help restore him to power in the troubled Caribbean
nation.
President Bush said he was "disinclined to use
American force" to reverse the coup, but said the
32-nation OAS may discuss "a multinational force
of some sort." Other possibilities include hemi
sphere-wide diplomatic and economic sanctions,
said U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The United States and other Western nations
have already suspended aid to Haiti, one of the
world's poorest and most politically unstable nations.
Coups have toppled six governments in the past five
years.
Haitians cautiously ventured from their homes to
buy food Wednesday, but many shops remained
closed in the capital of Port-au-Prince and traffic was
light. The army appealed on the radio for people to
return to work. Sporadic gunfire rang out, but fewer
soldiers were on the streets.
At a news conference, Cedras said soldiers, not
senior officers, overthrew Aristide because of "fla
grant" abuses of power.

Two Haitian soldiers observe the volatile situation in their country where exiled President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide has been warned not to return to his home. A transfer of power from the military to the
Parliament may be the next step, noted Haiti's army chief.
