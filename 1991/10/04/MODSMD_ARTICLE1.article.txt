In a long and contentious Faculty Senate meet
ing yesterday, faculty clashed over the priorities
that should guide the University in its attempt to
cut 10 percent from its operating budget.
In particular they argued over the Senate Com
mittee on Education and Scholarship's recommen
dation that traditional scholarly disciplines receive a
higher priority than the creative and performing
arts.
"Having strong programs in the arts is essential
to any university that plans to offer a liberal educa
tion," said English Prof. Nancy Packer. Without
such programs "this will be a very dull and dreary
place to be," she added.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall and English Prof. George Dekker also
argued that the arts are significant in undergradu
ate education. Dekker called the arts "a locus of per
sonal exploration, growth, discipline and under
standing."
Committee member George Fredrickson told the
faculty that the budget crisis presents some uncom
fortable realities â€” among them, the decision that
some departments are more important than others
to Stanford's future.
"Something has to go," said Fredrickson, a pro
fessor of history. "Something has to suffer. We
made the decision that it was not a good idea to
make these cuts in an across-the-board or a
mechanical way. If we cut everything the same
amount, everything will be mediocre."
The defenses of the arts were too much for Polit
ical Science Prof. Stephen Krasner, who exploded,
"I find this very troubling. Every one of us could
give an articulated discourse about our own field
which would be extremely self-serving. I do not see
what these kind of statements will do for us."
Krasner supported the committee's recommen
dation that excellence in scholarship should be the
criteria in forming budget priorities.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz criticized the commit
tee's recommendation that graduate students be
used to teach Cultures, Ideas and Values sections.
"The people who make that program excellent are
primarily the lecturers," he said.
Rebholz called the termination of lecturers "a
false economy" because lecturers do the teaching
work of professors "for much less pay."
The committee's task force on undergraduate
education also released an interim report that
included further recommendations.
The report included a statement that "It is par
ticularly important that . . . the faculty and admin
istration not lose sight of Stanford's fundamental
commitment to the principles of diversity and mul
ticulturalism, both in the classroom and in the
Stanford community as a whole."
The task force also made a number of recom
mendations about the Department of Athletics, sug
gesting that the department should be "subject to
substantially higher targets for cuts than academic
units," that income from the golf course and the
