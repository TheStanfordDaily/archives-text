Human rights abuses targeted
MOSCOW (AP) — Delegates from 38 nations
agreed unanimously Thursday to authorize
mandatory investigations of human rights abus
es. But the Soviet Union said this wasn't tough
enough to halt violations.
The Soviets, whose abysmal human rights
record had been the focus of international con
demnation before the August coup, supported a
German proposal for unspecified sanctions
against offending states.
But the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the West's pre
miere human rights forum, decided to take a
more cautious approach.
In the 24-page document adopted Thursday,
the 38 nations abandoned the long-cherished
principle of not interfering in each other's affairs
and declared that human rights are the "legiti
mate concern" of all countries.
The member nations agreed to create a pool of
human rights experts who would investigate
alleged rights abuses either with or without the
consent of the nations involved.
Gemany's woes continue
HAMBURG, Germany (AP) — Germans cele
brated the first anniversary of reunification
Thursday against a backdrop of economic tra
vail in the east and an upsurge of violence
against outsiders.
Leaders reported progress in overcoming the
problems of transforming eastern Germany into
a democratic and capitalist society, but said
there is much to be done and urged Germans to
show greater understanding for each other.
At the same time, government leaders used
their forums during the "citizens' festival" of
German Unity Day — a new national holiday —
to decry the alarming rise of violence aimed at
refugees and other foreigners in recent weeks.
