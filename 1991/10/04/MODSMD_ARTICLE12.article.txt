# More violence in Haiti

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - On
Thursday, when occasional shots still could
be heard, especially in the sprawling seaside
slum of Cite Soleil, wounded continued to
arrive at the capital's general hospital.
One woman, wounded in both legs, was
being treated on the floor of the waiting
room. Emergency room officials said they
were turning away all but the most serious
cases because of overcrowding.
They said that since Sunday night, 324
wounded people had been treated, and that
more continued to arrive although the vol
ume had declined significantly since the
first day of the takeover.
They said at least 150 were killed during
the period.
Two U.S.-based human-rights groups,
Americas Watch and the National Coalition
for Haitian Refugees, said in a joint state
ment Thursday that they had confirmed 35
civilian deaths and 300 wounded. They said
the actual number of casualties was likely
much higher, however.
The statement said human-rights lead
ers in Haiti reported by telephone that sol

diers had been cruising the capital in cars
without license plates, randomly shooting
at pedestrians.
The shooting appeared to be aimed at
terrorizing the population to prevent popu
lar resistance to the ouster of Aristide, who
is adored by Haiti's impoverished masses
and was elected president by a two-thirds
majority last December.
On Thursday, the army banned street
demonstrations. In announcements on
radio and television, the army said it was
concerned for life and property, and expect
ed the public to cooperate with the ban.
In Cite Soleil, where some 200,000 peo
ple live side-by-side in dirt-floor shacks
with no running water or electricity, resi
dents gathered in a crowd to tell foreign
reporters the military had fired on resi
dents indiscriminately.
"Children, old people, vendors â€” all
were gunned down," said Reginald Pierre,
21.
Yolette Mondesieur, 26, said, "They
killed us because they know we were the
ones who voted for Father Aristide."
