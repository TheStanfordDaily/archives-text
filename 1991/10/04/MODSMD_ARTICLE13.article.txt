# Serbia to take over parliament
## 
### 
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” Moving to
consolidate its control over what remains of
Yugoslavia, the republic of Serbia
announced Thursday that it was taking
over the federal parliament with three
allies.
Although the parliament is virtually
defunct, the move appeared to represent
Serbia's effort to usurp what remains of
federal power. A senior Western diplomat
said the move effectively dissolved the
eight-member federal presidency, which
nominally controls the Yugoslav army.
The army, which launched a major
assault against Croatia this week, bombard
ed areas around historic Dubrovnik, start
ing a raging forest fire, and closed in on the
capital, Zagreb.
Croatian leaders say the attacks on the
Adriatic, on the eastern Croatian region of
Slavonia and in Banija, south of Zagreb,

represent a bid by Serbia to define a
"Greater Serbia" that would include most of
Yugoslavia. The republic of Slovenia and
what remained of Croatia would then be
permitted to become independent.
In Belgrade, representatives on the fed
eral presidency from Montenegro, Serbia,
and Serbia's two provinces decided to take
over the federal parliament at a meeting
that included the defense minister and
army commanders.
The presidency normally requires five
votes for any decision, but its chairman,
Stipe Mesic of Croatia, was not among those
at the meeting. Mesic already has said that
Yugoslavia is bound to splinter.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic were
reported to be heading Friday to The
Hague, where peace talks sponsored by the
European Community continued.
