## A 						battle to be heard 
### 
Gay rights protesters
exercise free speech to
Gov. Wilson's dismay

IN MANY WAYS, the bedlam
surrounding Gov. Pete Wilson's
speech during the Stanford Cen
tennial illustrated the robust power
of free speech. Both gay-rights
protesters and the governor had
their say in a public forum; both
sides were heard. And restraint
shown by the police and most of the
protesters and spectators allowed
words to battle rather than fists.
Wilson and his wife showed
courage by withstanding 10 min
utes of hostile chants and ear
piercing whistles. But Wilson dis
played cowardice and political
expediency two days before when
he vetoed Assembly Bill 101,
which would have prohibited
employment discrimination based
on sexual orientation. Long after
Wilson sped away from the noisy
proceedings, his veto remains,
impeding the quest for gay rights.
In most parts of California, it is
legal to discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation. If people are
fired or not hired because an
employer objects to their sexual
orientation, they have no statutory
recourse. AB 101 placed sexual
orientation on the same level as
discrimination because of race,
gender, national origin, age or
physical disability, and it empow
ered the State Fair Employment
and Housing Commission to sue
on behalf of victims.
Wilson vetoed the bill not on the
premise that it was unnecessary
but because it would have hurt
business when enforced. The gov
ernor seems to be saying civil
rights are important, but only if
they do not cost anything.
Wilson apparently rescinded his
previous support of the bill
because of pressure from conser
vatives spearheaded by the Rev.
Lou Sheldon and the Traditional

Values Coalition. In other words,
he supports civil rights, but only
when it won't cost him votes. So
the anger exhibited by distraught
gay people this past week came as
no surprise. Civil rights vanished
in a back-room trade.
Did protesters have a right to
raise their voices and placards at
the proceedings? Certainly. The
First Amendment does not exclude
the Stanford Centennial. Nor does
it depend on the identity of the
parties exercising this right.
The right of self-expression,
however, does not extend to a right
to vandalize or commit violence.
Much criticism of the event is
based on the assumption that all
protesters were out of control and
verging on violence. In fact, the
crowd was a varied lot. Some were
loud and raucous, others quiet and
serious. Many were Stanford stu
dents and alumni; others were San
Francisco members of such gay
rights organizations as Queer
Nation.
Free speech can prove disre
spectful, vexatious and sometimes
downright rude, but it is still a
constitutionally protected right.
Whether it accomplishes anything
is another matter. What purpose
was served by the disruption? If it
was to vent the outrage and pain of
an embattled minority, then the
protests worked. If it was to
inform the public of Wilson's
action and encourage broad sup
port of gay rights, the result is less
clear. In a recent poll, 62 percent of
Californians opposed Wilson's
veto. This percentage could rise or
decline depending on how the pub
lic perceives the protesters.
It is quite easy for the televi
sion-viewing public to focus on
images of disorder, vandalism and
drag queens rather than on civil
rights and the difficulty of being
gay, lesbian or bisexual in a homo
phobic society. Rage is a powerful
emotion, and it can motivate peo
ple into political action. But it can
not substitute for coalition build
ing and, ultimately, the power of
persuasion.
