## David Bradfute Gov. Wilson willfully incited gay rage 
### 
GOV. PETE WILSON DID not come
to Tuesday's Centennial convoca
tion to celebrate Stanford's 100 th
birthday. He came hoping to incite a riot.
When he first agreed to speak at the
Centennial, Wilson probably saw it as an
opportunity to curry favor with Stan
ford's powerful and wealthy alumni. But
after he decided to veto the gay-rights
bill, Assembly Bill 101, Wilson expected
to attract thousands of angry, perhaps
violent, protesters.
He was armed with a speech carefully
crafted to amplify the anger of the les
bians, gays and bisexuals in the crowd.
When he encountered the desired demon
stration, the governor taunted the
protesters to increase tension.
Pete Wilson's goal was television
footage of a brave future president defend
ing traditional American values in the face
of a mob of hostile "queers." The gover
nor's intention was to mollify the right
wing of the Republican party and secure a
reelection bid for his protege, U.S. Senator
John Seymour.
Wilson's veto of AB 101 set off violent
demonstrations in San Francisco and
Sacramento. Monday night the State
Office Building in San Francisco was van
dalized, resulting in over a quarter of a mil
lion dollars in damage. Stanford's Centen
nial convocation was Wilson's first public
appearance after the veto announcement.
In the words of Stanford Police Cap

tain Raoul Niemeyer, "It didn't take a
rocket scientist to figure out that
protesters would hit Stanford next."
Frank Wisner, a Wilson spokesperson,
admitted, "We'd been preparing for more
protesters â€” in the thousands."
Sean Garrett, another Wilson spokes
person, said, "We were not only worried it
would ruin the event but that people would
get hurt." Wilson and his staff knew in
advance that his presence at Stanford
would ruin the convocation and possibly
result in physical injury and property dam
age. Wilson decided to attend as planned.
As a result of the demonstration almost
no one in the Quad heard the governor's
speech, which in the interest of crowd con
trol was probably a blessing. A full quarter
of Wilson's speech was dedicated to "natu
ral order, the great strengths of 19th Cen
tury American values" and an elegy to the
"traditional nuclear family," which the
governor felt had reached its zenith in the
America of the 19505.
While Wilson never mentioned sexual
orientation explicitly, he used the same
language that the ultra-conservative ideo
logues Lou Sheldon, William Dannemeyer
and Jesse Helms use to attack and
marginalize lesbians, gays and bisexuals.
Considering the political context, the gov
ernor's speech was highly inflammatory.
After his set speech, Wilson increased
tensions in the crowd by accusing the
protesters of "fascist tactics" and said

they were "more to be pitied than cen
sured." Whatever one thinks of the
protesters and their methods, his
remarks make it clear that Wilson had no
intention of defusing the situation.
The protesters' use of sound to drown
out the governor was annoying and
showed a lack of respect for one of this
institution's most central traditions, that
of free and open discourse. But Wilson
did not come here to engage in discourse.
Wilson came here to gloat over and
enrage the people whose rights he had
denied by vetoing AB 101. The fact that
the protest turned violent at the end was
extremely unfortunate, but the governor
has to share responsibility with the
protesters for what happened.
Stanford has had more than its share
of turmoil and intrigue over the last year.
We have suffered from the indirect-cost
debacle, two rounds of budget cuts and
the resignation of our president. During
the Centennial we tried to take a moment
from the strife and the pain to celebrate
this great institution's 100 th birthday.
Wilson marred that celebration with the
most cynical form of political theater. He
intentionally incited a small riot to gain
political favor with right-wing Republicans.
We should wait till the next centennial
before we ask Wilson to return to Stanford.
