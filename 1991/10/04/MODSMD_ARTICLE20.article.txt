Centennial weekend marred by recent painful events

THE SURREAL CONTRAST be
tween the glitz and self-congratula
tions of the Centennial and last
week's other events rip at the core of the
University and our hearts. Instead of
seven days of joy to lead us into the year
on a positive note, sadness is left behind
as school gears back up again.
The [alleged] sexual assault at Casa
Zapata is the most terrible thing I can
imagine happening in the first week of
school. A young woman, a freshman who
had just left her home for college, was
allegedly assaulted by a 23-year-old man.
I can imagine the hope and joy she had at
coming to Stanford and the loss she must
feel to have dreams violated. I feel sorry
for her family, who must have been excit
ed for their loved one, but not entirely
without anxiety, who entrusted her to us
and who had their worst fears realized so
quickly.
And I also feel sadness for the resi
dents of Casa Zapata. This incident poi
sons the love and community that char

acterize this home away from home. And
somewhere I feel sorry for the man
charged in the case: If he is convicted, I
would wish him to be punished to the
fullest extent for his crime, but I do not
wish for anyone to have to live with the
terrible truth of this violent act.
Nor is this case an isolated one. Statis
tics tell us one Stanford woman in four
experiences acquaintance rape or sexual
assault while at the University. Occasion
ally I sit in the dining room and look at
the people around me and wonder who
has suffered something so terrible, and I
am disturbed that I can't even recognize
their pain.
Even if these statistics are grossly in
error, too many people live with terrible
things in their lives, and it's awful to
think that our world here at Stanford,
one that is probably better than many
other places, can do so little to protect,
help and comfort those in need.
The demonstration during Tuesday's
convocation has also left its mark on our

community. Contrary to what a Centen
nial committee member was quoted say
ing in Wednesday's Daily, the demonstra
tion has everything to do with Stanford.
Every gay or lesbian member of Stanford
is affected by the law, and their friends
and their families witness the obstacles
they face in life.
Although I would not personally par
ticipate in interrupting another's
speech, I do not think all of the anger
expressed at the demonstrators is
entirely just. The disappointment at
having a nice, quiet, peaceful celebration
disturbed did not result from 300
demonstrators who were out of line, but
from the world we've created that denies
gays and lesbians the right to live free of
discrimination.
The sexual assault, the demonstration
and our reactions to them symbolize to
me the essence of my experiences at Stan
ford. Stanford, like the world around us,
is not free from conflict and hate. Its
attempts to confront our problems as an

institution are to be congratulated, and I
often feel like I inhabit an island of hope
when I reflect on my experiences else
where.
For that very reason I feel even more
disappointed when I discover that my
home and my community contain the
sources of hate, violence and conflict. But
I am again hopeful when I see people rise
to the challenge, as is currently happen
ing in the medical school.
The path to harmony among us lies
not in politically correct stadium spec
taculars or in self-congratulatory con
vocations with big-shot politicians, but
in forcing ourselves to confront the
horrible conflicts that continue to hurt
and divide us. Let us contemplate the
pain of Casa Zapata's alleged assault
victim and the pain of discrimination of
any kind and fight to protect ourselves
and those around us from these
wrongs.

A tribute to those who touched the Stanford community

The most important aspect
of life at a university is meeting
people one might not otherwise
meet, making casual acquaintances and
— if one is lucky — deeper friendships. Of
course, this happens routinely in every
day life outside of academia, but some
how not in the way that it does in a uni
versity, which, before all other things,
brings people together.
And as the loss of something often
causes one to value it more deeply, so I
realized this summer, with the deaths of
two friends I met at Stanford, how beau
tiful knowing them was.
Egon Scotland, a Knight Fellow at
Stanford last year, was not a close friend,
but one of those people with whom I had

a special camaraderie in a classroom situ
ation. We studied Serbo-Croatian togeth
er. Both he and his wife Chris were in the
class; they loved Yugoslavia and wanted
to know a bit of the language before a
vacation there. It was to Yugoslavia that
he went as a professional journalist to
cover the civil war, and it was there that
he was murdered while riding in a car
clearly marked with the insignia of the
press.
I knew Sergio Guerrero for only about
two-and-a-half months last spring, but
we became very close in this short span.
Sergio was fighting what he metaphori
cally referred to as World War III: AIDS.
Last June, after passing his Ph.D. oral
examinations, he collapsed with pneumo

nia and went to the hospital.
What followed was one of the most
moving displays of human caring which I
have ever witnessed. Friends and family
from literally around the world con
verged on his hospital room to give him
their "good energy" and love and help
him get out of the hospital. He did make
it out that time, but his next visit, in late
August, was his final one.
The legacy of these two men is exten
sive. I can only mention that Egon
brought information on the suffering
and destruction in Yugoslavia — infor
mation which helped the international
community to see better what is going on
in that place — and thus directly and
effectively aided the victims of war in

that country.
Sergio significantly participated in
the rise of AIDS awareness and empha
sized the importance of not being silent
about the disease. It is partly due to Ser
gio's efforts that Stanford's health poli
cy now for the first time offers extensive
coverage (up to $200,000) to all stu
dents.
Celebrating the 100 th anniversary of
the University, we should remember it is
the people we meet here who make the
place what it is; we should remember
those who were here a very short time
ago and who made Stanford and the
world better for all of us.
