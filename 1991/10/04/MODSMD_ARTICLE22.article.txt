The Cardinal proved that it can do it with
its defense, too.
The Stanford women's volleyball team,
which usually overpowers opponents with
its impressive offense, relied on its defense
last night to shut Notre Dame down com

Cardinal defeats Fighting Irish

advance to the championship match tonight.
"When you can hold almost every player
on the other team to a negative hitting per
centage, you're doing pretty well," Stanford
women's coach Don Shaw said after the
match.
That is exactly what the Cardinal did.
Playing in the second match of the tourna
ment, the No. 1-ranked Stanford team
pulled its defense together, never even
allowing the Irish into the match.
Notre Dame hit a -.076 as a team and only
managed 16 kills on the night, while Stan
ford tallied 58 digs and 10 blocks. Junior Bev
Oden led the Cardinal with 14 digs and 5
blocks, junior Carrie Feldman added 13 digs,
and Jennifer Jackson had another 10 digs.
"It's really easy to dig when the block's in
the right place, and we blocked really well
tonight," Oden said.

"Our digging was incredible. . . . Our
defense is the key," Feldman said.
"We worked on defense all day yesterday
in practice and it really paid off," senior cap
tain Kristin Klein added.
Stanford's defensive success was made
possible in part by the team's aggressive
serving. Oden had four service aces, three of
them coming during a nine-point run that
put game two away for the Cardinal.
"We served really well tonight. It set up
our defense," Feldman said.
"Bev was serving BB's tonight," said
sophomore Piper Hahn, who came in
halfway through the third game and fin
ished the match for the Cardinal.
Stanford's defense made up for their
offense, which was not its overwhelming self
against Notre Dame. The Cardinal only hit
.189, far below its .288 season average.
Senior Amy Cooper led Stanford with nine
kills and a .353 percentage, while Oden
added eight kills and hit .294.
"We got careless. ... I think Notre Dame
played good defense, but we made a lot of
errors in the third game," Shaw said.
Shaw was able to get some players off the
bench into the game last night, with Hahn,
sophomore Heidi Eick, and freshman Denise
Rotert all getting playing time against the
Irish.
"It's just fun to play again. I'm glad I got
to contribute," Eick said.
"We got a couple of people in for some
points—it's hard to get substitutes in during
matches like this where the points are com
ing so quickly," Shaw said.
Overall, the Stanford players felt good
about their performance, especially how well
they stayed in the game mentally.

"We've been trying to work on maintain
ing our focus for the entire match. We want
to keep that intensity for three hours,"
Klein said.
"We were scrappy tonight," Rotert said.
"It's the best night we've had at home,"
Oden said.
The Cardinal ran its record to a perfect
11-0 for the season, but they will have a
much greater challenge in the champi
onship match tonight against No. 11 New
Mexico, which had an easy three game win
over San Jose State in the opening match.
The Lobos, who run an offense unlike
any that Stanford has seen this season,
defeated the Spartans 15-7, 15-13, 15-9.
New Mexico hit .333 as a team for the
match, led by junior Sharon Browning's
.565 hitting, 15 kills, and 14 digs.
New Mexico has an unusual offense
which utilizes two setters (instead of the
usual one) and relies on several left-handed
hitters.
"With three lefties in the lineup, we'll see
a different look. It'll be interesting to see
how we deal with it," Shaw said.
Not that the Stanford players are wor
ried, however.
"I think if we play our game we'll be able
to beat them," Klein said.
The consolation match between San Jose
State and Notre Dame will be played at 6
p.m. at Maples, and the championship
match will follow at 8 p.m. The Stanford-
New Mexico match will be broadcast live on
KZSU, 90.1 Stanford radio, by Chris Crader
and Rick Seidel. The match will also be
broadcast live by XTV on Channel 10 and
reshown Saturday on Channel 6, Cable Co
