# Water polo to breeze over UC-Davis
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
After a disappointing and incredibly chal
lenging six games last weekend and with the
Pacific 10 Conference season soon to begin,
the Stanford water polo team could use a little
rest.
The team does have two games to play, but
neither should take too much away from the
well-needed relaxation in store for the players.
The first game will be today at 3 p.m. at
deGuerre Pool when the No. 7-ranked Cardi
nal take on unranked University of Califor

nia-Davis. The second game will be Saturday
at 2 p.m. at deGuerre against an alumni
team.
As freshman standout Wolf Wigo said,
"We're training really hard this week and
we'll get to ease up this weekend before con
ference play starts next week."
The game against Davis does not figure
to be much of a contest, and it is almost cer
tain that everyone will get into the action
for Stanford. After losing four seniors to
graduation, this year's team is quite young,
so this game should provide many of the
younger players with needed experience.

The Cardinal will likely have a much
more difficult time against a very talented
alumni squad, but with nothing to lose.
Fun and having a good time will be the
themes of the day.
