Traveling to Tempe, Arizona this week for
the Lady Sun Devil Invitational, the Stanford
Women's Golf Team will be "leaving our
number one gun at home," according to head
coach Tim Baldwin. Senior Adele Moore, a
second-team All-Pacific 10 Conference golfer
in the 1990-91 season, will be staying on the
Farm to take the LSAT this weekend.
After a sixth place finish in last year's
NCAA tournament and a third place in the
Pac-lOs, the Cardinal started off this season
on a great note. Sporting a No. 6 pre-season
ranking by Golfweek Magazine, the team will
play on the Karsten Golf Course, October 4,5
and 6, against some formidable competition.
Coach Baldwin doesn't seem to be worried,

however. In his thirteenth year as coach of
the women's golf team, Baldwin is pleased to
see that "for the first time, we have depth on
the team." The Cardinal will be traveling to
Tempe with the main focus of gaining experi
ence on the Arizona State course, which will
be home to the Pac-10 Championships in
April and the NCAA Championships in late
May.
"With Adele, we would definitely be a con
tender. ... we may still be a contender," Bald
win said. "We will be strong."
The Cardinal brings back four of last
year's starting five, with the exception of Jody
Figley who graduated in June. The Stanford
line-up will feature senior Audrey Wooding,
who earned an All-American Honorable men
tion as well as honors as an Academic All-

American last year. Stephanie Davis, another
senior, will add experience to the Cardinal
roster as well.
Baldwin is enthusiastic about the play of
junior Martha Richards, who will concentrate
solely on golf this year, instead of dividing her
time between basketball and golf as in last
year's season. Richards, according to Bald
win,"is tremendously talented. She seems to
improve virtually daily."
"We're going to really do some good home
work on the golf course and just see how well
we can play," Baldwin said.
The Cardinal faces stiff competition from
the likes of Georgia, Arizona, San Jose State,
UCLA, Tulsa, and Arizona State, all of whom
will be "gunning to win this one."
