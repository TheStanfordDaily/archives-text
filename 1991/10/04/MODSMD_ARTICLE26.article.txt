# Tough teams race in Stanford Invite

Stanford prepares for an
onslaught of 2500 athletes this
weekend, as the eighteenth
annual Stanford Cross Country
Invitational takes off tomor
row.
Thirteen top 20 teams will
compete including Arkansas,
No. 1 in the men's division, and
Oregon, expected to be No. 1 in
the women's division.
Stanford athletes have been
pushing hard to prepare for
their biggest preseason meet of
the year, having what coach
Chisam called, "the best ten
days of practice. . .since I've
been here."
The Stanford men's game
plan looks to be cutting the gap
between the third and fourth
runners from one-and-a-half

minutes a few weeks ago to
thirty seconds tomorrow.
Seniors Dave Scudamore
and Fred Carter and junior
Gary Stolz (Stanford's top
three) consistently place in the
top ten, but since the first five
finishers all count for points,
the fourth and fifth runners are
crucial to the team's success.
The Stanford women, a
young, inexperienced team this
year, are led by just three
upperclassmen. They did, how
ever, do "very well at Fresno
against small colleges," Chisam
said.
At this early point in the sea
son teams and runners are still
discovering what they can do.
As Coach Chisam anticipates
for tomorrow, "We'll find out if
we're a top 20 team. We believe
we are."
