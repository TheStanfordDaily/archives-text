# Wildcats, Buffs 'n' Irish —oh my... the new wizard is Ozzie
## Colorado freshman to bolster Cardinal in the Other Big Game 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Good things rarely come in small packages.
The Stanford football team, however, has
recently been pleasantly surprised by the
emerging talent of true-freshman offensive
player Ozzie Grenardo.
When the Cardinal star running-back Glyn
Milburn went down with a knee injury against
Arizona, Grenardo was summoned to take his
place on punts and kickoff returns. The fresh
man from Colorado Springs continued to
return kickofTs for Stanford in the Colorado
game while Milburn handled the punt return
duty. In his new role, Grenardo has taken five
kickoffs for 172 yards — an average of 34.4
yards per return — which places him as the
current Pacific 10 Conference leader.
"It's a great surprise to have Ozzie come
through and do a great job for us," said special
teams coach Chris Foerster. "You're always
looking for someone that can do what Glyn
can do and to have someone that comes in and
fills in as well as he has is really outstanding."
As one of the last freshmen to sign for Stan
ford, Grenardo was far from being the Cardi
nal's top recruit. Despite being named a First-
Team All-State player as wide receiver and
safety in high school, Grenardo was not
expected to play such a key role for Stanford
so early in his college career.
"When we recruited Ozzie we thought that
we had a pretty talented player," coach Denny
Green said. "I was surprised at how gifted
Ozzie is once we brought him in simply
because he was a guy that did not play run
ning back in high school.
"We needed a running back and we went
after a couple guys. When we didn't get them,
we needed to at least bring in a guy that had
some speed, so we signed Ozzie."

Grenardo, who has been described as hav
ing "explosive speed and excellent hands,"
expected to be playing defensive back. Instead,
he was spotted in practices as someone that
could do an exceptional job at returning kicks.
He was noticed by both the coaching staff and
fellow teammates.
"Once practices started, he was a real
bright spot," Milburn said. "We were looking
at finding a little more depth at running
back."
'Little' is an appropriate word. Grenardo at
5-9 and 165 pounds, is definitely below the
average running back size. Described by coach
Green as "a terrific little player. . . . who looks
like he's about 13 years-old," Grenardo admits
that he needs to work on increasing his size.
"I expected to get redshirted and get a little
bigger because I'm probably not the biggest
guy," Grenardo said. "I thought they'd beef
me up some."
It wasn't speed, however, but yardage that
was the key factor last weekend against Col
orado. Grenardo had kickoff returns of 64
yards and 44 yards, with the opening return
setting up the Cardinal's first score. He fin
ished off with three returns for 124 yards.

As much as everyone else, Grenardo was
surprised by his performance last Saturday.
"I wasn't expecting to have the day I did,"
Grenardo said. "But I just gotta keep building
from that now on I'm just happy to con
tribute to the team as much as I can."
It was only a year ago when Grenardo was
watching his home team, the Colorado Buf
faloes, go to the Orange Bowl and the Nation
al Championship. Last weekend, as he
stepped onto the field against Colorado,
Grenardo could hardly believe he was playing
against his hometown team that did not even
recruit him.
"I knew all the people at home would be
watching," Grenardo said. "It was a great feel
ing to beat them."
Grenardo's choice to go to Stanford was
based on the scholarship offered to him, as
well as the top-notch academics on the Farm.
A National Merit Finalist, Grenardo is aiming
towards medical school.
"I want to do really well in my academics
because you need something after football,"
Grenardo said. "If you don't have a degree to
fall back on, you're nothing."
What Grenardo was definitely not expect
ing was to be playing, let alone playing so suc
cessfully, this early in his college career. He
and Milburn have helped the Cardinal to a
team kickoff return average of 26.3 yards,
which ranks second in the Pac-10.
In practices, Grenardo has been acting as
an apprentice to Milburn, following him
around trying to learn from him what to do
and how to do it.
We get along," Milburn said. "We're kind
of similar in how we're used on the team so
we're gonna mingle a little more than most
players. On trips we're roommates and we get

to talk then also."
"I just try to look up to him,"
Grenardo said. "He's a real good
guy, he helps you.. . He's trying
to help me learn the offense and
get adjusted. He's been a great
help and friend."
With Milburn expected to
leave for the NFL at the end of
this season, the starting running
back spot will be left wide open.
Does Grenardo consider him
self a strong contender for the
spot?
"I think he sees himself that
way," Green said. "There'll be a
lot of people coming in and chal
lenging for that spot. . . and I
think the opportunity (for
Grenardo) is there. I think right
now he's just concentrating on
being in the right spot at the
right time and getting a chance
to play and show what he can
do."
Foerster and Milburn are even
more optimistic about the possi

bility of Grenardo starting as
running back next year.
"Ozzie could do a very good
job," Foerster said. "Eventually
he'll be able to step in and do it
full time and I think be as effec
tive as Glen."
Taking the spot of Milburn,
who is a legitimate Heisman Tro
phy candidate and recognized as
one of the most explosive and
dangerous players in all of college
football, will not be an easy task.
Nevertheless, Grenardo has his
goals set on becoming as good as
Milburn and reaching his level of
speed and ability.
"He's tough," Green said."He's
as tough as anybody on our foot
ball team. . . Every player on the
team respects him because
they've seen what he can do."
Despite his recent success,
Grenardo remains a freshman
who is still adjusting to big-time
college football. "When we step
on the field against Notre Dame
this weekend the air will be so
tense with excitement that you
just can't help but get nervous
and ready to play."

Grenardo's choice to go to Stanford was
based on the scholarship offered to him, as
well as the top-notch academics on the Farm.
A National Merit Finalist, Grenardo is aiming
towards medical school.
"I want to do really well in my academics
because you need something after football,"
Grenardo said. "If you don't have a degree to
fall back on, you're nothing."
What Grenardo was definitely not expect
ing was to be playing, let alone playing so suc
cessfully, this early in his college career. He
and Milburn have helped the Cardinal to a
team kickoff return average of 26.3 yards,
which ranks second in the Pac-10.
In practices, Grenardo has been acting as
an apprentice to Milburn, following him
around trying to learn from him what to do
and how to do it.
We get along," Milburn said. "We're kind
of similar in how we're used on the team so
we're gonna mingle a little more than most
players. On trips we're roommates and we get

to talk then also."
"I just try to look up to him,"
Grenardo said. "He's a real good
guy, he helps you.. . He's trying
to help me learn the offense and
get adjusted. He's been a great
help and friend."
With Milburn expected to
leave for the NFL at the end of
this season, the starting running
back spot will be left wide open.
Does Grenardo consider him
self a strong contender for the
spot?
"I think he sees himself that
way," Green said. "There'll be a
lot of people coming in and chal
lenging for that spot. . . and I
think the opportunity (for
Grenardo) is there. I think right
now he's just concentrating on
being in the right spot at the
right time and getting a chance
to play and show what he can
do."
Foerster and Milburn are even
more optimistic about the possi

bility of Grenardo starting as
running back next year.
"Ozzie could do a very good
job," Foerster said. "Eventually
he'll be able to step in and do it
full time and I think be as effec
tive as Glen."
Taking the spot of Milburn,
who is a legitimate Heisman Tro
phy candidate and recognized as
one of the most explosive and
dangerous players in all of college
football, will not be an easy task.
Nevertheless, Grenardo has his
goals set on becoming as good as
Milburn and reaching his level of
speed and ability.
"He's tough," Green said."He's
as tough as anybody on our foot
ball team. . . Every player on the
team respects him because
they've seen what he can do."
Despite his recent success,
Grenardo remains a freshman
who is still adjusting to big-time
college football. "When we step
on the field against Notre Dame
this weekend the air will be so
tense with excitement that you
just can't help but get nervous
and ready to play."
Good things rarely come in small packages.
The Stanford football team, however, has
recently been pleasantly surprised by the
emerging talent of true-freshman offensive
player Ozzie Grenardo.
When the Cardinal star running-back Glyn
Milburn went down with a knee injury against
Arizona, Grenardo was summoned to take his
place on punts and kickoff returns. The fresh
man from Colorado Springs continued to
return kickofTs for Stanford in the Colorado
game while Milburn handled the punt return
duty. In his new role, Grenardo has taken five
kickoffs for 172 yards — an average of 34.4
yards per return — which places him as the
current Pacific 10 Conference leader.
"It's a great surprise to have Ozzie come
through and do a great job for us," said special
teams coach Chris Foerster. "You're always
looking for someone that can do what Glyn
can do and to have someone that comes in and
fills in as well as he has is really outstanding."
As one of the last freshmen to sign for Stan
ford, Grenardo was far from being the Cardi
nal's top recruit. Despite being named a First-
Team All-State player as wide receiver and
safety in high school, Grenardo was not
expected to play such a key role for Stanford
so early in his college career.
"When we recruited Ozzie we thought that
we had a pretty talented player," coach Denny
Green said. "I was surprised at how gifted
Ozzie is once we brought him in simply
because he was a guy that did not play run
ning back in high school.
"We needed a running back and we went
after a couple guys. When we didn't get them,
we needed to at least bring in a guy that had
some speed, so we signed Ozzie."

Grenardo, who has been described as hav
ing "explosive speed and excellent hands,"
expected to be playing defensive back. Instead,
he was spotted in practices as someone that
could do an exceptional job at returning kicks.
He was noticed by both the coaching staff and
fellow teammates.
"Once practices started, he was a real
bright spot," Milburn said. "We were looking
at finding a little more depth at running
back."
'Little' is an appropriate word. Grenardo at
5-9 and 165 pounds, is definitely below the
average running back size. Described by coach
Green as "a terrific little player. . . . who looks
like he's about 13 years-old," Grenardo admits
that he needs to work on increasing his size.
"I expected to get redshirted and get a little
bigger because I'm probably not the biggest
guy," Grenardo said. "I thought they'd beef
me up some."
It wasn't speed, however, but yardage that
was the key factor last weekend against Col
orado. Grenardo had kickoff returns of 64
yards and 44 yards, with the opening return
setting up the Cardinal's first score. He fin
ished off with three returns for 124 yards.

As much as everyone else, Grenardo was
surprised by his performance last Saturday.
"I wasn't expecting to have the day I did,"
Grenardo said. "But I just gotta keep building
from that now on I'm just happy to con
tribute to the team as much as I can."
It was only a year ago when Grenardo was
watching his home team, the Colorado Buf
faloes, go to the Orange Bowl and the Nation
al Championship. Last weekend, as he
stepped onto the field against Colorado,
Grenardo could hardly believe he was playing
against his hometown team that did not even
recruit him.
"I knew all the people at home would be
watching," Grenardo said. "It was a great feel
ing to beat them."
