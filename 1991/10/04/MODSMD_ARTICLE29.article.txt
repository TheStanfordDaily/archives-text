### 
SATURDAY - TV: ESPN, Radio: KZSU (90.1

RECORDS — Stanford (0-2, 1-2 overall), No. 8-
ranked Notre Dame (3-1 overall)
NOTES — No one needs to be reminded of last
year's stupendous 36-31 upset in South Bend.

This year's contest promises to be equally
exciting with the Cardinal coming off a big win
over Colorado last week.
