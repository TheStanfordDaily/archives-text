# Deciding what to cut
## Faculty, students speak out, but there's little consensus on how to slice budget 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Staff writers 
One thing was consistent about yester
day's series of open meetings and forums
about the budget crisis: they offered plenty
of advice about what to keep, but few con
crete recommendations for cuts.
"I'm very disturbed about what I per
ceive to be the Balkanization of the Uni
versity," said one professor at last night's
faculty open meeting. "Each person is
arguing for his own thing."
More than 100 students concerned
about future budget cuts questioned Deans
Michael Spence and Ewart Thomas of the
Graduate School of Business and School of
Humanities and Sciences at a separate stu
dent town meeting.
A 30-member contingent supporting the
drama department dominated much of the
meeting and expressed its outrage at the
prospect of slashing creative arts.
During classes this week, several drama
teachers encouraged their students to
speak out at the meeting, according to the
students there. Preliminary recommenda
tions from the Faculty Senate Committee
on Education and Scholarship at Stanford
stated that creative and performing arts
should be a lower priority in the budget
cutting process than more scholarly pur
suits.
"I encouraged people in my acting class
es to come to tonight's meeting and voice
their opinion," said Chris Salter, a third
year graduate student in drama. "I hope
that all of this support will let the adminis
tration know that the arts are valued on
this campus."
Salter said students interested in drama

also held a brief protest in front of the
Quad yesterday afternoon.
Members of the Council of Presidents,
who organized the student town meeting,
said they had hoped students would take a
broader perspective on budget reductions.
"We were looking for testimony from
individuals, but we hoped to see more stu
dents prioritize and look at the cuts with a
broader perspective. It did happen a couple
of times," said junior Beth Morgan. "Obvi
ously, there are many competing con
stituencies . . . but students do have to
realize that something has to give."
Spence and Thomas, who are not mem
bers of the senate budget committee, were
often forced to defend the committee's pre
liminary recommendations — including
the one on creative arts.
But many students who asked questions
anonymously discussed issues beyond the
area of art — focusing on residential edu
cation, distribution requirements and
overseas campuses.
One student suggested cutting Fresh
man English — to the applause of almost
half the audience. Thomas asked for a vote
of students in favor of cutting the program
and discovered the students were "split."
Residential education received support
from many students, and several offered
suggestions about how to save it.
Senior Mark Breimhorst said dormitory
activity funds could be used to replace
funds cut from the Office of Residential
Education.
Spence reassured students that need
blind admissions and need-based financial
aid will remain important principles at
Stanford.
