# Deciding what to cut
## Faculty, students speak out, but there's little consensus on how to slice budget 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Staff writers 
One thing was consistent about yester
day's series of open meetings and forums
about the budget crisis: they offered plenty
of advice about what to keep, but few con
crete recommendations for cuts.
"I'm very disturbed about what I per
ceive to be the Balkanization of the Uni
versity," said one professor at last night's
faculty open meeting. "Each person is
arguing for his own thing."
More than 100 students concerned
about future budget cuts questioned Deans
Michael Spence and Ewart Thomas of the
Graduate School of Business and School of
Humanities and Sciences at a separate stu
dent town meeting.
A 30-member contingent supporting the
drama department dominated much of the
meeting and expressed its outrage at the
prospect of slashing creative arts.
During classes this week, several drama
teachers encouraged their students to
speak out at the meeting, according to the
students there. Preliminary recommenda
tions from the Faculty Senate Committee
on Education and Scholarship at Stanford
stated that creative and performing arts
should be a lower priority in the budget
cutting process than more scholarly pur
suits.
"I encouraged people in my acting class
es to come to tonight's meeting and voice
their opinion," said Chris Salter, a third
year graduate student in drama. "I hope
that all of this support will let the adminis
tration know that the arts are valued on
this campus."
Salter said students interested in drama

also held a brief protest in front of the
Quad yesterday afternoon.
Members of the Council of Presidents,
who organized the student town meeting,
said they had hoped students would take a
broader perspective on budget reductions.
"We were looking for testimony from
individuals, but we hoped to see more stu
dents prioritize and look at the cuts with a
broader perspective. It did happen a couple
of times," said junior Beth Morgan. "Obvi
ously, there are many competing con
stituencies . . . but students do have to
realize that something has to give."
Spence and Thomas, who are not mem
bers of the senate budget committee, were
often forced to defend the committee's pre
liminary recommendations — including
the one on creative arts.
But many students who asked questions
anonymously discussed issues beyond the
area of art — focusing on residential edu
cation, distribution requirements and
overseas campuses.
One student suggested cutting Fresh
man English — to the applause of almost
half the audience. Thomas asked for a vote
of students in favor of cutting the program
and discovered the students were "split."
Residential education received support
from many students, and several offered
suggestions about how to save it.
Senior Mark Breimhorst said dormitory
activity funds could be used to replace
funds cut from the Office of Residential
Education.
Spence reassured students that need
blind admissions and need-based financial
aid will remain important principles at
Stanford.
After observing the meeting,
Sally Mahoney, acting vice presi
dent for student resources, said it
was "very helpful" in providing a
better understanding of student
perspectives.
Members of the ASSU Senate
and COP will prepare this week
end a list of recommendations on
the budget-reduction process
from the student perspective.
Another student town meeting
is planned for Monday night to
discuss the proposal before it is
presented to members of the sen
ate and cabinet budget commit
tees late next week.
Members of the administration
reassured more than 600 staff
members at yesterday afternoon's
faculty/staff town meeting that
they will not be forced to take on
more responsibilities to compen

sate for budget cuts.
"We cannot ask people in
human resources to work harder,
run faster, jump higher and do
the same things they have been
doing before," said Barbara But
terfield, vice president for human
resources. "We will find ways to
reduce the tasks and stop doing
things that do not contribute to
the University."
Butterfield said she "could not
promise that layoffs would not
occur." But both she and Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
said they would try to shift work
ers across departments and use
attrition to reduce the number of
the staff.
Butterfield also said staff bene
fits — which, as in all other busi
nesses nationwide, have been grow
ing rapidly in recent years — would
have to be examined. She added
that "free health care to everyone
may no longer be possible."
Responding to concerns from
several staff members, Kennedy

and Charles Kruger, deputy chair
of the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning,
said more regular staff would
become involved in the budget
reduction process when schools
and vice-presidential areas begin
considering cuts on the local level.
At last night's faculty open
forum, attended by about 120 fac
ulty, several professors called for
greater cuts in administrative ser
vices. Faculty mentioned Public
Affairs and Legal Services as good
candidates for the chopping block.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner, chair of the senate com
mittee's task force on administra
tive services, argued that admin
istrative areas are not as bloated
as is commonly believed.
"I know that this is the area
you all want to hit," he joked.
"But it's really too easy to look at
this and say, cut all those other
people. ..."
Sharing a number of statistics
on administrative growth at Stan

ford and other universities, Kras
ner said, "We don't look grotesque
on any of these measures."
Several humanities faculty dis
puted the recommendation of the
committee's task force on
research and scholarship that
cuts in library services could be
obtained by limiting special acqui
sitions.
"I think we have to recognize
that in the humanities we need
retrospective acquisitions," said
one professor to scattered
applause. Otherwise, he contin
ued, "You will not be able to
attract excellent faculty in any
field that has not been done here
in a long, long time."
Faculty continued their
requests, prominent at Wednes
day night's town meeting, that
the University examine ways of
alleviating the severity of the bud
get crisis by cutting from other
areas of the consolidated budget
and easing restrictions on the use
of the endowment.
