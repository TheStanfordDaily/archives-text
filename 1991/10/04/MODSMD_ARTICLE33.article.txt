# Booters challenge top national competition
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women booters
will try to improve on both their
No. 9 ranking and their perfect
7-0 record this weekend as they
host the Security Pacific Cardi
nal Tournament.
Stanford will take on Brown
University and No. 10-ranked
Duke this Friday and Sunday at
Harry Maloney Field. Both
games, particularly the Duke
contest, are important indica
tors of how well this phenome
nal Cardinal team can play
against nationally-heralded
competition
Although Stanford has been
decimating its opponents with
machine-like regularity, a num
ber of its early-season foes were
not in Stanford's league. Save
perhaps their defeat of Univer
sity of California-Santa Barbara

earlier this season, Stanford has
not played a game yet which it
was not expected to win handily.
The two games this weekend
are expected to be tough battles.
Card notes
The Cardinal's seven-game win
ning streak marks the most consec
utive wins in Cardinal history for a
single season. The overall record is
12 straight wins, a feat accom
plished over the last six games of
the 1988 season and the first six in
1989. Stanford will be led offensive
ly by Julie Foudy, who is one goal
shy of the single-season record for
goals in a season with 12. Although
a junior, she is already Stanford's
career scoring leader with 36 goals
at the Farm. On defense, look for
Stanford keeper Leslie Garrard to
play a larger role in the game as
Stanford begins to face more high
powered offenses. The defensive
unit, as usual, is anchored by senior
Heather Mclntyre.
