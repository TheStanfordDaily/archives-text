# Why do the Doobies do biz at Stanford?
## 
### 
After that Centennial jamboree I felt as
gosh-darned warm and gooey inside as a Food
Service "chicken," so I figured I better jump
on the already crowded bandwagon and break
out with a few token tips for incoming fresh
people.
1) Stay away from the weird, bald guy who
hangs out outside the Woolworth's on Fifth
and Market with an electronic Playskool gui
tar;
2) Never refer to Stanford as "the Farm."
Like "Frisco" and"the CoHo," most nick
names indicate an obvious lack of familiarity
with a given place. No one calls Stanford "the
Farm" except for overly cheerful Orientation
volunteers who smile so much and so wide
only because they're getting paid seven clams
an hour to play frisbee; and
3) Send me questions as often as possible if
you expect to graduate within, say, eight
years. And make sure you don't confuse me
with the Science Bug. All other Bugs are false
Bugs. Only I can answer the great mysteries
of the universe:
What have the Osmonds been up to lately?
In what states is bestiality a jailable
offense?
Why are those evil green university mat
tresses just large enough that normal sheets
don't fit on them and those that do come off
every night anyway so I wake up with my face
stuck to suspiciously adhesive plastic?
And, most importantly, considering Gilli
gan foiled every single rescue attempt, why
didn't the castaways just kill the bumbling
moron and eat him with one of Mary Ann's
delicious coconut cream pies?
All you need to do is drop a question or 20

in my lovingly crafted box in the Storke Pub
lications Building. And think of me as a per
sonal confidant, in a sense, Stanford's answer
to 970-numbers.
On second thought, maybe that's not a
good analogy.
Dear Bug,
The Doobie Brothers? Why?
Well, now, isn't that just as funny as all get
out — I myself have been wondering that very
question for the last few weeks (funnier still,
I actually have to ask myself this question
given the dearth of mail lately).
With a deadline rapidly approaching, my
mind raced to offer an adequate explanation.
Were there some under-the-table dealings
going on?
Maybe the Doobies' hypnotic rhythms
would mesmerize the unwary audience, trans
forming the Stanford community into a zom

bie horde ready to serve a power-mad ASSU
like some '90s Jonestown (hey — what were
all those people doing in the Quad with the
Kool-Aid?).
Or perhaps the entire show was intended
as one giant distraction to divert attention
from the Mausoleum which at that moment
was being infiltrated by crazed neurosurgeons
and deranged high priests of a hundred-year
old, black-magic cult whose only purpose was
to reanimate the lifeless bodies of their per
sonal deities — Jane and Leland Stanford!
Then, of course, I remembered that I
wasn't writing for the Weekly World News
and thought a little actual research might be
appropriate, if not helpful.
Some 20 phone calls finally led to Cavalli-
Jacobi Communications, which put together
the Stadium Spectacular, and a helpful
Marsh McCall. Dispelling any rumors of plots
to free the undead, McCall informed me that
the Doobie Brothers were selected because
they were an available big-name Bay Area
rock band with previous ties to the Stanford
Community. As it turns out, the Doobies
donate money to and give informal acoustic
shows at the Stanford Children's Hospital.
McCall added the lineup was intended to
provide "a little something for everyone." One
can only guess the death-metal crowd was a
little disappointed that Slayer wasn't on hand
to jam with Bobby McFerrin.
So hurry up and write in before I have to
ask myself more questions.

The Bug wonders why he has to refer to him
self in the third person here like he was pos
sessed by demons or something.
