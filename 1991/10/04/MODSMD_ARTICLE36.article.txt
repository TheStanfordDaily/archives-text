# Stanford kills pizza monster — and more
## 
### 
Over the last two weeks, I've
become very alarmed that this
University is becoming way too
anal. And I don't mean to sound like
some kind of old fart who starts every
sentence "Now, when I was a fresh
man," but things are a little bit differ
ent.
You know what I mean. Random
squares of toilet paper in the hallway
never used to be considered a fire haz
ard. A "safe" loft was basically one that
didn't have rusty nails protruding out at
eye level. And the alcohol policy mainly
consisted of sticking an EANAB sign on
the water fountain.
But now, all this has been changed.
The University is paying important
looking men with clipboards to wander
around the dorms and fine people for
leaving pizza boxes in the hallway,
which otherwise would pile up in an
unused corner of the dorm, festering
with moldy cheese and growing larger
week after week. Eventually some
newly evolved organism would emerge,
devour a couple of freshmen and then
proceed on a campus-wide feeding fren
zy until it was finally brought down
inside of Green Library by heavily
armed gunmen that were sent in when
the monster forcibly entered without a
valid student I.D.
Sure, it's a scary scenario, and this
very possibility keeps University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy awake through
out most of his budget conferences, but
the administration still needs to lighten
up a little. Oh, I know what they're
thinking: "Hey, last time we relaxed a
little, we lost $45 billion thanks to that
auditor whose name sounds like some
one spitting in a toilet."
But hey, that's ACCOUNTING,
something that's supposed to be anal by
its very nature. Every year, thousands
of accountants try to survive the mind
boggling dullness of their jobs by getting
frontal lobotomies. I'm just bothered

because the University is becoming
uptight about EVERYTHING.
I encountered some of this anality
just before classes started, when I was
eating at Stern with an illegally
acquired Freshman Orientation Meal
Card.
I fit cjght in, of course, by asking
questions such as: "Wait a minute .. .
what would happen if I used my PAC for
an on-campus number?" Everything
was going smoothly. But after finishing
my rectangular-shaped "meat," I tried
to get a drink refill by — and this was
my big mistake — walking BACK
THROUGH THE CHECKOUT LINE.
No dice. I was quickly informed that
under absolutely no condition was I
allowed to do this. Apparently, if I did, I

would cause some sort of horrible mis
calculation in the sophisticated food ser
vice computer. No doubt I would con
fuse it into identifying the next cus
tomer as a foodstuff, prompting the
kitchen crew to come out and drag the
unwitting frosh off to the back room,
where terrible things would be done
with his intestines.
Yes, I had to walk ALL THE WAY
AROUND. It makes you wonder just
what this school is coming to when peo
ple posing as freshmen are actually
treated that way.
And what bugs me even more is that
the REAL concerns are being all but
ignored. For example, various estimates
state that somewhere between 20 and
25 freshmen have been wandering
around campus since the band rally on
the first night, still unable to find their
way back to their dormitory.
And what about the huge, campus
wide population explosion of a cappella
singing groups? Shouldn't there be some
kind of legal limit, or at least an open
hunting season?
Of course, in all fairness, I should
point out Stanford isn't all that bad.
The Government is much more ahal
than even Res Ed and has been forcing
the University to fire certain professors,
change the alcohol policy and put Stern
on the point system.
Yeah, come to think of it, I am over
reacting a little bit. Stanford's not that
bad compared to the real world; it's just
this whole senior year thing has got me
slightly on edge. I have this horrible
knowledge that I'll be leaving soon, and
I really don't want to think about it. Oh
well, I guess I'll just hang in there, keep
smiling, and enjoy this place while I can.
But right now, I have to go feed the
Pizza Boxes.
