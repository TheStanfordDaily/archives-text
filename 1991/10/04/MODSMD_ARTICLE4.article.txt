# Foreign students undaunted despite less aid

Despite the obstacles international
students face in Stanford's admissions
process, their numbers are on the rise.
Besides the extra effort required to
apply from overseas, international
students do not the advantage of
need-blind admissions. Moreover, the
students face twice as much competi
tion as American applicants.
Need-blind admissions is Stan
ford's commitment — recently
affirmed by Dean of Admissions James
Montoya — to disregard a student's
financial situation during the admis
sions process.
Assoc. Director of Admissions Jon
Reider, who is in charge of internation
al applications, said "For the last three
years we could not ensure need-blind
admission for international students.

"This is not related to the recent
budget crisis," he said, noting that the
Admissions Office had the policy when
he took his job in 1985, though it was
implemented only recently.
Reider said that for the second year
running the Admissions Office had to
"turn away qualified students" due to
lack of funding.
International students are not eligi
ble for federal aid, so financial aid has
to come solely from private sources.
The director of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center, John Pearson, said he
regrets the absence of need-blind
admissions: "To my knowledge, only
Harvard practices need-blind admis
sions for international applicants."
Despite the problems, a large num
ber of foreign students are provided
with financial help from Stanford.
Tascha Damaskinos, a sophomore

from Cyprus, received a full scholar
ship. "Stanford was a great opportunity
for me," she said. "It is easier to get
scholarships for American universities"
than for schools in other countries.
Many international students said
they are content with Stanford's
financial aid policy. However, some
still complained about the admissions
process.
Senior Gayatri Taneja said, "Even
though I feel [international students]
don't have a right to demand more
financial aid, I wish they would make
the application process a little easier."
Taneja, a native of India, said Stan
ford was the only university of 10
schools she applied to that did not waive
the application fee, which at $55 is $5
more than the fee for U.S. residents.
Stanford's refusal to grant fee
waivers to foreign students can have

widespread implications, some stu
dents said.
Taneja, who was last year's coordi
nator of the International Student
Orientation Committee, noted that a
number of countries have restrictions
on obtaining foreign currency.
"In India, for example, it can be
extremely difficult just to obtain a
check or money order to send to the
United States," she said.
Moreover, $55 can be a fortune to
some students, particularly those
from countries where the dollar is a
very potent currency.
Taneja, who received the James W.
Lyons award for service last year, fur
ther noted that deadlines are hard to
meet because overseas mail "takes
very long" and gets lost frequently.
She suggested that Stanford "single out inter
national students and send mail earlier."
"After all," said Taneja, "we don't
have the advantage lof picking] up the
phone and [getting] information, like
Americans can do."
Looking back at her own memories
Taneja said, "I did get a telegram when I
was admitted. That was really nice."
Despite the difficulties in the admis
sions process, the quality of enrolling
students has not suffered, Reider said.
On the contrary, more and more inter
national students apply to Stanford

every year, raising the academic stan
dard in the process.
Reider reports that 1,200 of last
year's 13,000 applicants were foreign cit
izens. Only 110 were admitted, translat
ing into a 9 percent acceptance rate as
compared to 20 percent overall.
Of the 110 students accepted, 70 decid
ed to attend Stanford — the largest inter
national class ever to enter the university.
Canada, India and Singapore are par
ticularly well-represented this year.
Reider said few students from the
less-developed world made their way to
Stanford this year. He blamed insuffi
cient academic and language preparation
for their lack of representation.
Currently, 260 international under
graduates are registered at Stanford.
