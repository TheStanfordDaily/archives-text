# Dorm misses 'Soto,' stolen stone mascot
## 
### Yaser Haddara 
Many consider the loss of
the family pet a great tragedy,
and the residents of Soto are
no different.
They are grieving over the
loss of their mascot ... a 100-
pound, three-foot cement stat
ue of a dog named "Soto."
"Soto" was stolen from the
lobby of the dorm last Sunday.
According to the Stanford
Police and dorm residents, the
theft occurred some time
between 10 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.
The perpetrators were able
to escape unnoticed with their
prize even though it had been
chained to the staircase railing
after several attempts were
made to steal it in recent years.
A part of the dorm's culture
revolved around the statue. "I
knew people who — before
taking MCAT exams— would
come back to the dorm just to
make sure they had rubbed
Soto's head for good luck,"
said resident assistant Dev
Patnaik. He added that the
statue had stood in the lobby

"for as long as anyone can
remember."
Police officials have no leads
and there are no suspects. Any
one who has information about
the incident should contact the
Stanford Police Department.
According to Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, this is probably the
only way the police might be
able to retrieve the statue.
Niemeyer noted that it is typi
cal at this time of year for
pieces of furniture, statues or
works of art to disappear.
Legend has it that the real
life "Soto" — the pet dog that
gave its name to the dorm —
was owned by Leland Stanford,
Jr. The area where Wilbur
Hall now stands used to be a
favorite hangout for the boy
and his dog. According to the
legend, Leland was attacked by
a rabid raccoon and Soto sacri
ficed its own life to save that of
its young owner.
While the residents of Soto
may not have been emotionally
devastated by the disappear-
ance of the statue, they have been able to use it as a
motive to come together and "party with a theme,"
Patnaik said.
Resident Mihran Sahami, along with a few oth
ers, organized a "Find Soto" party last Sunday
night. Having had a few refreshments, they
dimmed the lights and held what some described as
a seance to try to find the statue.
Amid flashing lights, 50-60 people sat in a circle,
"meditated" and then drew pictures of Soto as they
remembered him and wrote down where they
thought he could be.
