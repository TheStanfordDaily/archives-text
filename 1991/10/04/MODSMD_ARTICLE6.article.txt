# Seven houses demand better food service
## 
### Julie Keane 
Residents in seven University
operated Row houses, angry that
their in-house cooks have been
re-assigned to larger dorms, say
they want the situation rectified
either by having their cooks
returned or allowing some houses
to become self-operatives.
When they arrived back on
campus this year, residents of
Roth, Yost, Murray, 558 May
field, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Grove
Mayfield and Grove-Lasuen
learned their in-house cooks
would no longer be a part of their
residential communities.
Instead, their meals are pre
pared in Wilbur Hall and Lagunita
Court and trucked in to the
respective houses. According to
residents, the food is not up to par.
At least one house, 558, has
sought legal counsel and claims
there is a "breach of spirit of con
tract," according to resident
Craig Klugman, a senior. But he
noted that taking legal action
would be a "very extreme action."
Director of Housing and Food
Service Keith Guy denied that
the cooks' removal is a breach of
contract, saying, "Nothing in (the
residents') contract guarantees

University Food Service workers take food prepared at Lagunita Court to Row houses. Personal cooks
were removed from several Row houses this year, and residents aren't all satisfied with the results.
