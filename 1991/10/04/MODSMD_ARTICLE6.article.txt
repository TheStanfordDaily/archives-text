# Seven houses demand better food service
## 
### Julie Keane 
Residents in seven University
operated Row houses, angry that
their in-house cooks have been
re-assigned to larger dorms, say
they want the situation rectified
either by having their cooks
returned or allowing some houses
to become self-operatives.
When they arrived back on
campus this year, residents of
Roth, Yost, Murray, 558 May
field, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Grove
Mayfield and Grove-Lasuen
learned their in-house cooks
would no longer be a part of their
residential communities.
Instead, their meals are pre
pared in Wilbur Hall and Lagunita
Court and trucked in to the
respective houses. According to
residents, the food is not up to par.
At least one house, 558, has
sought legal counsel and claims
there is a "breach of spirit of con
tract," according to resident
Craig Klugman, a senior. But he
noted that taking legal action
would be a "very extreme action."
Director of Housing and Food
Service Keith Guy denied that
the cooks' removal is a breach of
contract, saying, "Nothing in (the
residents') contract guarantees

them a personal cook."
Klugman claims the food
options are extremely limited and
at times there are not enough pro
visions for all the residents.
"We're paying the same amount
of money [for food service! and
we're not getting the same ser
vices," he said.
Other houses echo similar con
cerns. Toby Chun, a returning res
ident at Yost, described the meal
selection as "very repetitive."
According to Chun, "approximate
ly 22 people were left standing in
line [Wednesday] night because
they didn't bring sufficient food."
But resident assistants and res
idents alike said there is more at
stake than just receiving quality
meals; they worry about the frag
mentation of their houses. With
only a fraction of the residents
attending meals, it is difficult to
build community spirit, they said.
Murray sophomore Mike Sim
mons explained, "You don't see as
many people around eating and so
it's harder to get to know people in
the house. You don't know every
one's name, but you know that
people don't like the food."
Diana Conklin, acting associ
ate dean of residential affairs,
said she has spoken with four of
the six resident assistants and is
"extremely upset on the effect of
this situation."
"It worries me a great deal," she
said, noting that the system is not
working and is an urgent matter.

However, Guy said he is "com
mitted to making this central pro
duction delivery work.
"We want the quality and ser
vice to be essentially the same or
better than last year," he said.
"We identified the idea to save
some operating dollars a few years
ago, but weren't sure earlier that
it would need to be implemented.
It was an effort to consolidate and
streamline food service."
Still, residents of the houses
are angered and irritated by the
manner in which the University
handled the situation.
Students did not know about the
change until their return. "There
was no indication given that this
would happen," Murray resident
assistant Anne McGowan said.
"They left the dirty work to us
[the RA's]; we had to notify resi
dents," she said. "Students with
good draw numbers drew into the
dorm expecting a certain quality
and [are] not receiving it." How
ever, McGowan said she is
encouraged by Conklin's concern.
Senior Victor Velculescu
explained, "The cook was one of
the main reasons I chose Murray.
I had heard that the cook was
really good in Murray. [T]he Sun
day brunches are legendary."
Josh Kreinberg, the resident
assistant at 558, voiced the con
cern of many of the residents.
"The current situation can't go
on," he said. "We're just waiting
for the University to do some
thing, seeing what they're going
to decide."
