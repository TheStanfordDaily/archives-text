# Mirer pilots prolific South Bend attack

"The Golden Boy."
That was how Notre Dame quarterback
Rick Mirer burst onto the national scene
over a year ago as Sports Illustrated
advertised the feats of the then-sopho
more sensation in a cover story following
his first collegiate start.
True, Mirer's effort was somewhat
Olympian in nature. His touchdown pass
in the final minutes got the Fighting
Irish, 1990's No. 1 ranked preseason
team, past one of their biggest challengers
for the top spot, the Michigan Wolverines,
in thrilling come-from-behind fashion.
Nobody who follows college football would

deny that his completing 14 of 23 passes
for 165 yards in a game of that magnitude
signified Mirer's complete emergence
from his freshman role as former Irish
signal-caller Tony Rice's understudy.
However, Mirer, a 21-year-old junior
from Goshen, Ind., does not feel a press
ing need to be another Joe Montana,
whose former #3 Irish jersey is now worn
by Mirer, or Joe Theismann, another
Super Bowl champion whose collegiate
statistics are set to fall by the wayside if
Mirer continues on his current pace. His
first-year numbers at Notre Dame's quar
terback position were the best in the last
quarter-century
In fact, even though he passed for eight

touchdowns, ran for six more, and
accounted for over 2000 yards as Notre
Dame's offensive "general" in 1990, Mirer
did not then and does not now feel that
his exploits merit any special attention.
The explanation of his humility is genuine
and is almost as remarkable as his on-field
performance.
"I'm here to win games," said Mirer
when interviewed on Tuesday. "A Heis
man Trophy would be nice, but winning a
national championship would be a dream
come true, and it's the reason I came to
Notre Dame in the first place."
So despite doing more than asked as a
key cog in the perennial winning
"machine" of Coach Lou Holtz, the only
numbers Mirer is likely to remember from
last year's campaign are "nine and three,"
Notre Dame's won-lost record. While
many schools would consider such a mark
a dream season, it amounted to a night
mare for the Fighting Irish and their
nationwide fan base. The Irish suffered a
loss to Stanford in its fourth game, one in
which Mirer felt that the Cardinal defense
caught him off guard. They regained the
No. 1 ranking five weeks later only to lose
to a hot Penn State squad. Finally, the
Irish fell in a controversial 10-9 battle
with eventual national champion Col
orado in the Orange Bowl on New Year's
Day.
Last season was a predominantly disap
pointing one for Rick Mirer, an "all-
Everything" selection in his senior year of
high school who had been the consum
mate winner for much of his football life.
In his senior year Mirer led Goshen High
to the Indiana Class 4A state title and a
perfect 14-0 record, and his 3,973 passing
yards that season broke current Indi
anapolis Colts quarterback Jeff George's
state mark and stand as the second-great
est output by a QB in national prep histo
ry. In the state championship game, Mirer
threw for 395 clutch yards and two touch
downs, as well as marching his team 99
yards downfield for the winning score in
the fourth quarter.
The ability to seize complete command
of an offensive unit at exactly the right
moments is a rare gift in a quarterback at
any level. Mirer's displays of such an abili
ty in high school, and once again against
Michigan and Michigan State in his first
two NCAA games, have football scouts
everywhere salivating at his N.F.L.
prospects.
But that is applying a "fishbowl" to the
situation, b.egging a question about
Mirer's future that he is in no position to
answer. In fact, Mirer, who grew up a big
Michigan fan, has stated that when he
was younger, he never thought he would
be at Notre Dame now. What does he
think of bearing the onus of the "Notre
Dame mystique" every time he steps onto
the field?
"I've learned that pressure is what you

make of it," stated Mirer. "Being the
quarterback at Notre Dame isn't bigger
than life unless you treat it that way. You
can't be worried about pleasing all the
fans in the stands. That's impossible.
Coach Holtz told me from the very begin
ning that he's the only one I have to
please."
That puts grandiose notions about
Mirer in their proper perspective—on the
proverbial backburner—and puts the
focus on tonight's game, in which Mirer
will do all he can to ensure that the Leg
ends Trophy, given to the Stanford-Notre
Dame victor in each of the past two sea
sons, returns to Irish hands. Mirer gave a
thinly-veiled cry for revenge Tuesday, say
ing, "We can't say this game is more
important than any others; we're trying
to win them all."
Irish Coach Lou Holtz also downplayed
the revenge factor Tuesday, highlighting
Stanford's strengths and lamenting the
impossibility of stopping the Cardinal
offense. Yet he too fired a warning volley
into the Stanford camp, calling Mirer
"underrated" and stating, "I've never had
a quarterback do more for me through
four games...On a given day, he's as good
as any QB in the country."
Mirer's 200 passing yards per game
average, to go along with eight passing
TD's and four rushing scores thus far in
the young 1991 season, cause major con
cern for coach Dennis Green.
"He's playing better football than any
player in America," said Green. "He has
excellent speed and is a great rushing
quarterback, so we'll have to contain him
and cover his receivers at the same time."
Cardinal defensive end Tyrone Parker
agreed with Green, adding, "Mirer's big
and quick and he can run and pass. It's
going to be a challenge containing him."
Containing Rick Mirer's growing repu
tation is already a challenge, but if you're
looking for an expanding ego to match,
then the wrong guy has been thrust into
the spotlight.
"I don't like to talk a lot; if there are 15
guys asking me questions after a game, it
doesn't flatter me. I'd rather see my fami
ly," said Mirer, a marketing major who
has already mastered the basics of making
"the big sell."
For a big-time college star, Mirer's atti
tude sure is refreshing. It's almost as if
Notre Dame's quarterback were "golden"
or something.

I've never had a quarter
back do more for me
through four games...On a
given day, he's as good as
any QB in the country.'
