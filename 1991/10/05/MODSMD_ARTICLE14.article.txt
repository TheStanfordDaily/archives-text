# Where did the goalposts go?
## Mills tries to get foot in right direction

Sophomore place kicker Aaron
Mills has a big shoe to fill. That
hallowed soft leather boot, of
course, belongs to departed four
year starter and Stanford's all
time leading point scorer John
Hopkins.
But Mills, who wears a hefty
size 11 1/2, unusually large for a
place kicker, says he doesn't let
the pressure of following Hop
kins get to him—in fact, he feeds
off of it.
"John was a great kicker, but
living up to the expectations of
others isn't my thing.. .I'm set
ting my own goals, and I don't
think about the past," Mills said.
There really isn't much of a
collegiate past for Mills to reflect
on since he redshirted last sea
son. Three games into the 1991
campaign, Mills has converted
seven of seven PATs and one
field goal in five tries.
His inexperience came to a
head last week against Colorado,
when he missed all three of his

field goal attempts. "I just
missed the first one [42 yards]
flat out. I missed the second, a
50-yarder, then I lost all my con
fidence after that one," Mills
said. "I (had) never missed more
than one kick in a game before,
and I had trouble handling it."
"Aaron's young, and he has
some areas he needs to work on..
.he has a strong leg," special
teams coach Chris Foerster said.
Mills changed his kickoff style
against Arizona and put three of
four attempts into the end zone.
"Aaron is pretty well established
in the things he does. . .you need
to be consistent," he continued.
Mills realizes that his perfor
mance on the field can make or
break games for the Cardinal.
"You're the focus," Mills
explained. "It's a glorified posi
tion but it's easy to be a goat too."
Head coach Dennis Green
agrees. "Pressure is a nature of
the position. . .kickers have to
lock everything else out and con
centrate on one thing," he said.
What helps Mills concentrate

in deafening football stadiums is
a beaded bracelet he wears
underneath two wristbands on
his left arm.
"A real good friend of mine
from University of Florida made
it for me. I make sure I have it
with me for every game," Mills
said.
And the beaded bracelet has
paid off— Foerster says what he
likes most about Mills is his
placid demeanor.
"Some kickers can be temper
amental, like guys who let one
bad kick or punt ruin their day .
When he (Mills) makes a mis
take, he goes out to do it right
the next time," Foerster said.
"Once you've done something
good, you've got to go out the
next week in a completely differ
ent game and a completely differ
ent situation, and do the same
thing all over again," Mills
added.
Though Mills has appeared in
two collegiate games, his consis
