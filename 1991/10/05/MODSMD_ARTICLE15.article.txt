# Crossing the line: Defense teeming with converts
## 
### Scott Reiss 
It has been said that sometimes
the best defense is offense. If the
Cardinal are going to be successful
in 1991, they had better hope that
this theory holds true.
Coach Dennis Green is now
using no fewer than five former
offensive players as regulars on
defense. Last week against Col
orado, former backup offensive
lineman Tyrone Parker had his
name added to a list which already
included former quarterbacks Jon
Lynch and Tommy Knecht, as
well as former wide receivers Dar
rien Gordon and Vaughn Bryant.
The move which has thus far

received the most attention has
been that of one-time second
string quarterback Lynch to free
safety. Lynch, a 6-foot-2-inch, 210-
pound junior who backed up start
ing quarterback Jason Palumbis a
year ago, saw an opportunity for
more playing time while helping
out a defensive secondary that
was, to say the least, thin.
"It was just a matter of wait
ing," said Lynch. "I got here this
year and it looked like another
year I was going to be backing up,
and I really didn't want to not
contribute."
Right along side Lynch for
much of the first three games has
been another former passer, sopho

more Tommy Knecht. Knecht
went into spring practice last year
hoping to move up the quarterback
depth chart, but, like Lynch, he
found himself faced with an oppor
tunity to obtain a starting position
as a safety. And, also like Lynch,
Knecht feels right at home on the
defensive side of the ball.
"I'm really happy with it. I
really like defense. I think I have
more of a defensive mentality
than I did for offense, so I feel very
comfortable playing here."
Knecht maintains that his deci
sion to switch to defense had noth
ing to do with the impending arrival
of highly recruited quarterbacks
Justin Armour and Mark Butter
field. Rather, he was more con
cerned with the impressive showing
of Palumbis and sophomore Steve
Stenstrom last spring, and he
acknowledged the possibility that it
might be a long time before he was
called upon as a quarterback.

Both Knecht and Lynch split
time between quarterback and
defensive back at their respective
high schools, so they knew exactly
what they were getting into when
they made the switch to the other
side of the ball. Now, fully commit
ted to life on defense, both have
shown promise, contributing 11
tackles apiece thus far in 1991.
Having two former quarter
backs starting as defensive backs is
certainly a bit out of the ordinary.
So, just for good measure, Coach
Green has paired them with two
cornerbacks who were, once upon a
time, Stanford wide receivers. Dar
rien Gordon and Vaughn Bryant
have started all three games at cor
nerback, where they are responsi
ble for covering people playing the
position that they themselves once
played.
Gordon, a junior, made the
move after the 1989 season, and
won a starting job at cornerback

last year. The sophomore Bryant
played sparingly as a receiver last
season, and made the switch dur
ing spring practices following the
1990 campaign.
Meanwhile, 6-foot-4, 295-pound
junior Tyrone Parker was going to
see very limited playing time on a
Stanford offensive line which aver
ages 6-feet-6, 300 pounds per play
er. So Parker, like many of his
teammates before him, made the
switch to defense, and is now at
right tackle.
Parker cites injuries to the
defensive line as the main factor
in his decision to move.
"I was best suited to move into
the [defensive line], and I would
do anything to help the team,"
said Parker, who seems to have a
good time wherever he plays. "It's
fun. You get to hit people and play
football."
Coach Green is satisfied with
his decisions.
