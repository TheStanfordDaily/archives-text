# Shaking the leprechaun: 1990's amazing victory

Mystique. A certain indefin
able quality that can elevate a
football team from mere mortal
status to something verging on
the supernatural. Some would
claim that the Fighting Irish have
it while the Cardinal just don't.
Fluke. An occurrence associat
ed with pure chance or luck. The
same people mentioned above
might also contend that this was
the nature of Stanford's 36-31
triumph at Notre Dame Stadium
last year.
In both cases, they'd be
wrong.
The Cardinal has mystique, or
at least an element of mystery,
perpetually lurking in the back
ground and waiting for the right
opportunity to reveal itself. It is
not the special aura that sur
rounds legendary teams and cap
tivates fans from generation to
generation, and it is not the stuff
that enduring greatness is made
of. But it is something that can be
exciting, explosive, and dangerous
in its own right: The ability to
piece together The Big Upset.
And when it happens, when the
Cardinal really starts to click, the
victory is no fluke.
When Stanford took on Notre
Dame a year ago, the Irish were
ranked No. 1 in the nation and
playing at home, a combination
of factors that had proved insur
mountable for opponents since
1954. At halftime it looked like
another one for the books, with
the Irish leading 24-15.
The second half saw a rejuve
nated Stanford team take advan
tage of an Irish fumbled punt
and capitalize on two 62-yard

drives. The final drive came in
the last minutes of the game, cul
minating on a one-yard touch
down run by fullback Tommy
Vardell with just 36 seconds left
to play. When all was said and
done, Vardell had found the end
zone four times and had recov
ered a fumble to set up a fifth
touchdown.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
completed 26 passes in 34
attempts for 256 yards on the
day, and linebacker Dave Gar
nett racked up 12 tackles.
The win against the nation's
best team in front of 60,000
Fighting Irish fans was Stan
ford's first road win of 1990, and
its first victory ever at Notre
Dame. It was the shining achieve
ment of the season for the Cardi
nal, an official notice to the col
lege football world that Stanford
had arrived. It was, in short,
spectacular.
Today Notre Dame comes to
Stanford Stadium ranked No. 8
in the nation and looking to
improve their 3-1 start on the
season. Although head coach Lou
Holtz denies the importance of
the revenge factor, claiming that
"there will not be a single
thought about last year's game"
in the minds of his players, there
is no doubt that last year's out
come will focus national atten
tion on the match-up. Will the

Cardinal be able to pull off
another spectacular upset, leav
ing sports analysts baffled and
pollsters shaking their heads in
frustration?
According to junior Tyrone
Parker, recently switched from
the offensive to defensive line,
the answer is an unqualified
"yes." "We have to feel that we
will win," he explained. "That's
what this 'mysticism' thing (sur
rounding Notre Dame) is all
about, planting a little seed of
doubt in your mind. But you
can't have any doubts going into
it if you want to come out on
top."
The game today has been on
the minds of the Cardinal since
its successful effort against Col
orado last week marked a turn
ing point in the season. Last
week's result "shows us that any
team is beatable," Parker said.
Coach Dennis Green agrees.
"We're pretty excited coming off
our win last week," he said.
"Another win would give us the
momentum we need going back
into conference play."
Statistically speaking, a victo
ry for the Cardinal at this point
in the season is important. After
today's game, the Cardinal will
have seven opponents left to
face, five of whom have been
defeated by Stanford within the
past two years. Emerging from
the most difficult segment of its
schedule with a 2-2 as opposed to
1-3 record might give Stanford
the edge it needs to crack open
the rest of the season.
Of course, it would also give
that much more credit to the
inspirational performance of last
year and add another chapter to
the Cardinal's legend of upsets.

'Another win would
give us the momen
tum we need going
back into conference
play.'
