# Can they do it again?
## Cardinal looks for second straight upset 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
"If you can't get excited about
playing Stanford this week, you
ought to have a pulse check."
Coach Lou Holtz spoke these
words to his troops earlier this
week, with a clear message: it's
payback time.
In this eighth meeting of the
series, which dates back to 1925,
revenge is definitely on the
minds of the Fighting Irish. On
Oct. 6, 1990, Stanford, by the
score of 36-31, became the first
team since 1954 to defeat Notre
Dame at South Bend while the
Irish were the No. 1 ranked team
in the nation.
A year ago at Notre Dame, the
Cardinal did the impossible,
beating the Irish at home. The
question is, can Stanford pull off
another upset?
Stanford (1-2, 0-2) tries to
even its record this week after
defeating Colorado 28-21 on
Centennial weekend to garner its
first victory. The Cardinal con
trolled the tempo against the
Buffaloes, sustaining a strong
ground game (247 total yards
rushing) and amassing seven
plays of 20 yards or more. Stan
ford's offensive proficiency kept
Buffalo QB Darian Hagan off the
field, allowing the Cardinal

defense to rest and therefore be
more effective.
"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell
again delivered, scoring three
touchdowns and rushing for 114
yards on 29 carries, Glyn Mil
burn added 106 yards on only
nine carries, marking the first
time that two Stanford backs
both rushed for over 100 yards in
a game since the 1984 Big Game.
Indeed, the running game has
been so strong that quarterback
Jason Palumbis has yet to throw
a touchdown pass. Wide receiver
Chris Walsh commented, "We're
running the ball so well inside,
why risk throwing it?"
"The Stanford offense has
done a great job with ball control
and running the football," Holtz
added.
A problem for the Cardinal
thus far has been the kicking
game. Kicker Aaron Mills was 0
for 3 on field goal attempts last
week. At least Mills can do noth
ing but improve.
"Aaron got a chance to look at
the films and saw that he was tak
ing a false step on his kicks. . . .
his confidence also started to hurt
him," said Green. "But I have con
fidence in his ability and the team
has confidence in his ability."
Notre Dame (3-1) travels to
Palo Alto after pounding the
Purdue Boilermakers 45-20 last

week. The Irish have a powerful
attack—one that can be devas
tating to opposing defenses.
Junior quarterback Rick Mirer
leads the way. He completed 12
of 14 passes for 139 yards en
route to last week's 25-point win.
Tailback Tony Brooks and
fullback Jerome Bettis are a dan
gerous rushing combination.
Brooks, who had ankle surgery
in the off-season, rushed for 141
yards. And All-American tight
end Derek Brown is considered
to be one of the best in the coun
try at his position.
Stanford Coach Denny Green
said, "Notre Dame has one of the
best offenses in the nation. Rick
Mirer has excellent scrambling
ability and one of the keys to this
game will be our ability to con
tain him. "
Notre Dame's defense has
been at times both shaky and
impressive. Despite losing Chris
Zorich and Michael Stonebreaker
to graduation, the line is solid,
anchored by linebackers Devon
McDonald and Demetrius
Dußose. The secondary is also
strong, having already recorded
six interceptions (one more than
in all of last season) without
graduated standout Todd Lyght.

et' (Raghib Ismail)?" you may ask.
Sophomore Clint Johnson has
filled in quite nicely, averaging
16.2 yards per kickofF return.
"I think we've started to fall
into a little bit of a rhythm and I
hope we can keep it up," Holtz
said. "I was impressed with the
way we responded away from
home at Purdue, and we have to
continue to do that on the road. I
like the fact that anytime we had
difficulties, our team was always
looking for a solution."
In order to win successive
games against the Irish, Green
outlined four keys to success:
"1) We have to run the foot
ball. 2) We cannot give up any big
plays of 20 yards or more. 3)
There has to be a stalemate or (we
must) come out on top on special
teams, and 4) We need to get 20
first downs."
