STANFORD WOMEN
We are a couple with roots at Stanford who find ourselves unable to have a child
due to premature ovarian failure. We are looking for a woman, 18-32, who would
be willing to serve as an egg donor. No surgery is required. The procedure would
be performed by an experienced specialist. While this would be a fundamentally
humanitarian act, the woman would also be compensated.
We would be very grateful.
For further information, reply confidentially to: Donor
3145 Geary Boulevard, Suite 213
San Francisco, CA 94118
