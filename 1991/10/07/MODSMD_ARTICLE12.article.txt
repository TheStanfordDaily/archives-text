Thomas denies sex harassment
WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas "very forcefully
denied" allegations by a law professor that he
sexually harassed her when she worked for
him a decade ago, a Republican senator said
yesterday. And the White House dismissed the
accusations as "unfounded."
But Democratic senators called the accusa
tions very serious, and two senators said a delay
in tomorrow's scheduled confirmation vote
might be necessary.
Abrams indictment soon
WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran-Contra prose
cutors are pursuing former State Department
official Elliott Abrams in connection with the
scandal, but they're running out of time to
bring some charges against him, sources famil
iar with the probe say.
Abrams' lawyers met a week and a half ago
with the prosecutors, a meeting that may indi
cate action involving Abrams — either an
indictment or a guilty plea — is imminent, said
the non-government sources who spoke on con
dition of anonymity.
Prosecutors have been delving into whether
Abrams knew more than he admitted to
Congress about National Security Council aide
Oliver North's secret resupply operation for the
Nicaragua Contras in 1985 and 1986, the
sources said.
