# New offensive heats up Yugoslav civil war

### 
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) — Embattled Croatia
moved to a "war footing" yesterday, handing out
guns and uniforms to new volunteers, while federal
warplanes struck positions near the republic's capi
tal.
The European Community threatened trade and
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia's warring
parties unless the fighting stopped by midnight
today. But Croatian forces and the federal army and
Serb guerrillas continued battling throughout the
republic.
The army — facing desertions, morale problems,
armor captured by the Croats and the approach of
winter weather — appeared to be trying to strike a
decisive blow to bring Croatia quickly to its knees.
"It's a great offensive," said Croatian Information
Minister Branko Salaj. "They are throwing every
thing they have at us."
Croatian officials, apparently following President
Franjo Tudjman's call to arms late Saturday, said
they had begun mobilizing volunteers in areas where
there were enough weapons.
"We are making all military preparations that we
can, putting Croatia on a war footing," Salaj said.
"We can't go back anymore."
In all, at least 600 people have died since Croatia
declared its independence on June 25. Some esti
mates put the toll at 2,500.
The fighting between Croats and Serbs has been
caused by the refusal of many of the 600,000 ethnic
Serbs in Croatia to live in an independent Croatian
state. Croats blame the war on Serbian expansion
ism and say Serbs have nothing to fear from an inde
pendent Croatia.
In Zagreb, air raid sirens wailed three times, and
frightened residents rushed to bomb shelters to the
sounds of distant explosions.
Federal warplanes firing missiles attacked a small
airport six miles southwest of Zagreb, hitting the
command post of a former air force training center
that had been taken over by Croatians. Officials said
one person was killed and three injured, and several
nearby houses were damaged.
