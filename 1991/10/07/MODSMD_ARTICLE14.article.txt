DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) â€” American hostage
Terry Anderson, appearing healthier than in the
past, said in a videotape obtained by Cable News
Network yesterday that his captors told him they
would soon have "very good news" for the Western
hostages.
The tape was accompanied by a statement in Ara
bic signed by Islamic Jihad saying the tape was a
continuation of the process that started with the
release of Briton John McCarthy in August.
In the 12-minute tape, Anderson, 43, who has
been a captive for six-and-a-half years, described his
joy upon hearing a radio broadcast of the daughter
he had never seen a d of how he and fellow
captives passed the time with chess, talk and maga
zines.
Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, called on all parties act to

accelerate the negotiations aimed at an overall swap
to free the Western hostages and some Arab
detainees.
CNN said it had obtained the tape, made earlier
yesterday in Beirut, from a Lebanese production
company. Ed Turner, executive vice president of
CNN in Atlanta, said the network did not pay to
obtain the videotape.
The network said it did not conduct the interview
itself, but that it was allowed to submit questions to
those who made the tape.
It was not known whether the videotape was
made under the same conditions of duress that
appeared to characterize past tapings of hostages
from Beirut released by the kidnappers.
Details of the tape were provided by CNN pro
ducer Gayle Young, and portions also were viewed
bv The Associated Press.
