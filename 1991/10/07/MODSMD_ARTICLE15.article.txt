PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) — The Haitian Senate
president said yesterday legisla
tors were considering naming a
Supreme Court justice to
replace exiled President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide and calling
elections within 90 days.
Dejean Belizaire said no deci
sion on such an appointment
had been made, but that it could
come as early as today or tomor
row after talks with political
and business leaders to settle on
a solution to the crisis.
"We are not the government,
but we are the only legitimate
civilian institution that can
make decisions," Belizaire said

of the National Assembly,
Haiti's parliament, which was
elected with Aristide last
December.
He said any proposal for
resolving the week-old crisis
must be approved by the Senate
and Chamber of Deputies,
which form the National
Assembly.
Backing up claims by Gen.
Raoul Cedras, the armed forces'
provisional commander in chief,
that the military did not want to
govern, Belizaire said the army
had refused to assume interim
power.
"We have no government to
keep the state going," the Sen

ate president said. He said
"there was very little time" to
reach a solution.
The proposal being consid
ered yesterday was thought
likely to bar Aristide from new
elections, and it was not known
whether lawmakers would allow
him to return to Haiti. Under
the constitution, no president
can succeed himself.
Belizaire replied ambiguous
ly to a reporter's question about
whether he favored Aristide's
return, saying: "We want the
return of constitutional govern
ment." Some lawmakers have
accused Aristide of overstepping
his constitutional authority.
