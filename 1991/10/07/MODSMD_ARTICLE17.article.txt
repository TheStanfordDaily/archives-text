Row food-service cuts
are just a taste of the
budget cutting ahead

TOO OFTEN THE adminis
tration has cut much-valued
student services with no
prior notice and with little atten
tion to the needs of those affected.
Students entering seven of the
Row houses last month found
their house chefs had been
removed only to be replaced by
food carted in from other dorms.
The food is brought in long before
mealtime and is not reheated.
The University seems to have
completely left out students in this
decision. The reshuffling of food
service was decided two years ago,
yet no one was informed of it, not
even during the Draw last spring.
While some may criticize these
students for the pettiness of their
demands concerning food quality,
many of these students drew into
those Row houses expecting a
higher quality of food.
This incident is especially
important when viewed in the con
text of the massive budget cuts the
University is planning for the
operating budget over the course
of the next few years.
In many ways, the loss of house
cooks and the reduced quality of food
in these houses represent the Uni
versity's warning shot across the
bow of the ship of undergraduate life.
That shot will soon be forgotten
in light of the upcoming barrage of
cuts in other student services, aca
demic departments and support
personnel — the scale and impact
of which will far outweigh the
quality of student food.
While the means by which the
University carried out its plans for
reductions in Row house food ser
vice are reprehensible, these types
of cuts in student services, which
will considerably alter the quality
of life, should be expected.
When $40 million must be cut,

such niceties as personal house
chefs will be the first to go. Does
every dorm and house on campus
really need its own dining hall?
Most universities have several
central facilities that feed the entire
students body. Individual dorm
cafeterias add to the quality of dorm
life but but they are not essential to
the mission of the University.
In the coming years, more and
more cuts of these types will be
made. Student life will not be as
cushy as it has been in the past. It
is to be expected that something
will have to change, and change for
the worse. Students must accept
this fact.
What they cannot accept is to be
left in the dark once these deci
sions are made. It took the Univer
sity over two years to reveal the
changes in food service. Will it be
as secretive during the coming
years?
Will students suddenly be noti
fied without warning that their
major no longer exists months
after the decision to cut it is actu
ally made? If the food service inci
dent is indicative of the Adminis
tration ambivalence toward the
impact of its decisions on students'
lives, then there is significant rea
son for concern.
Will a student draw eighth in
his or her in-house draw and get a
single, only to move in fall quarter
and find that the room had been
made into a double the University
a year ago?
Decisions such as those about
Row house food service cuts would
not seem so drastic if the Universi
ty would just be frank in communi
cating information regarding them.
The Administration must be
open and forthcoming about the
multitude of changes that are sure
to result from the budget cuts.
Under the still-calm surface of
the Stanford campus a tempest is
raging. If the University doesn't
maintain solid lines of communica
tion with students, that tempest
will quickly swamp the ship of
undergraduate life with a deluge of
upsetting surprises.
