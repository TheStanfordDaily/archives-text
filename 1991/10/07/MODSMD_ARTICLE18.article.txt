A demonstrator's view of police action at the protest

I OFFER A CORRECTION IN direct
response to the Oct. 2 Daily article
titled, "How the Protest Came
Together." In this article, The Daily
reports that "[a] woman was confront
ed by protesters as she left the convo
cation. One protester requested that
she give him her ticket, which she
did."
Further, it is reported that, "when the
protester tried to enter with the ticket, he
was stopped by police, who said the ticket
did not belong to him. The youth [then]
tried to strike the officers and was
restrained by police, according to several
witnesses."
Now admittedly there were many inci
dents surrounding the convocation. How
ever, this particular incident seems at
once too familiar and yet too bizarrely
different from an alarming incident to
which I was witness.
At the center gate to the Quad, facing
the old wing of Green Library, I saw a
woman of around fifty freely, cheerfully
and vocally offer her ticket to whomever
wanted it. She was not confronted nor

asked for her ticket by the small group of
demonstrators.
A young man of no more than s'B"
accepted and took it from her hand as,
simultaneously, a large police officer of
no less than 6'3" tried to grab it back,
with a surprise, "Hey!" and explanatory
grunt.
The young man, who is a Stanford stu
dent, dodged and proceeded away, pre
sumably in a combination of fear and
shock â€” pursued by a monstrous figure
garbed in riot gear who, in order to stop
the student, both tackled him and ripped
his clothing.
As the stunned gathering tried to
vocally restrain this rather overzealous
officer, the police called for backup and
established a perimeter to hold back a
dwindling crowd of no less than 15 con-

cerned bystanders.
Meanwhile, the instigator of the situa
tion had perched his 200-plus pounds of
weight on the student's back as a second
officer tried to wrench the valuable free
pass out of the student's bluish hand.
Most of the officers were extremely reti
cent when asked for their badge num
bers. State law requires a response. One
officer was even verbally inciting a con
frontation.
Neither "the youth" nor any of the
crowd tried to strike or disrupt the
actions of the police other than verbally.
He was hardly "restrained." He was
abused.
Clearly, the officers escalated a
harmless situation into a confrontation,
perhaps due to their frustration with
being outmaneuvered by the demon-

strators day-long. Professional pride
notwithstanding, the officers were abu
sive.
The officer, in response to the gather
ing's protest, simply claimed that the
free pass to the public event was "Stan
ford property." Obviously, the officer
found this sufficient cause for brutality
and for physically restraining a member
of the very body which he is hired to pro
tect.
The student was taken aside,
sequestered from his peers and seeming
ly convinced not to pursue charges
against the officer. I overheard the stu
dent's grateful relief that he was not to be
arrested. Hardly an equitable trade in my
eyes.
The elderly woman whose action
precipitated the event was neither re
strained nor beaten. In fact, she
walked away in the midst of the com
motion.
Police brutality is as common as it is
unexpected.
