# Rape victims too often also victims of the legal system
## 
### 
Thank God the victim of the alleged
sexual assault in Casa Zapata last month
was only seventeen.
Statutory rape, at least, is a charge
which the District Attorney's office
seems reasonably comfortable in pursu
ing. Apparently forceable rape, which the
Stanford Police investigator on the case
found compelling evidence for, is not. I
am left wondering what recourse those of
us who are not minors would have had in
such a situation.
Examples of relief through legal chan
nels are few and far between, and horror
stories seem more common. During my
sophomore year at Wellesley College, two
freshmen from my dorm were abducted

at gunpoint from a student-activities bus
stop in Boston. One of the women was
forced out of the car in a neighboring
town; the other was taken off and raped.
The rapist was apprehended promptly;
the women decided to press charges; the
District Attorney felt there was enough
evidence to go to trial — and the defen
dant was acquitted. The jury decided that
the women were somehow "asking for it"
by being out in Boston at night.
This sort of outcome is not uncommon
for "stranger rapes." The burden of proof
for a rape is much greater than that of a
robbery, for example, largely due to the
way our rape laws have evolved from
English Common Law. (Harvard Law

Professor Susan Estrich presents a
cogent discussion of this in her book
"Real Rape.")
To say that the victim is often raped
again by the legal system in the course of
a trial is not an exaggeration, yet many
men still imagine that vindictive women
will cry rape falsely. And it only gets
harder for the victim when the rapist is
not a stranger.
Even if our legal system is unprepared
to consistently enforce a standard which
defines as rape any sexual contact with
out mutual consent, we must be ready to
enforce it as a community. We must edu
cate others and ourselves about what
constitutes clear consent, and we must

take it upon ourselves not to proceed
without clear consent.
We must also work to actively discour
age others from getting sex through force
or coercion. If the formal channels for doing
this are not enough, we must find other
channels. (The women at Brown Universi
ty, for example, developed a network to pro
tect one another by posting a list of men
who had raped as bathroom graffiti.)
The Stanford Community must decide
that rape is unacceptable and make that
message clear to all. In what purports to be
an arena in which all voices may be heard,
we must recognize the voice that cries, "No."
