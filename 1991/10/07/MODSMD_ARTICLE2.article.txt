# ASSU recommends new budget priorities
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Hoping to influence the
upcoming University budget deci
sions, the ASSU released its own
set of reduction priorities last
night.
The recommendations will be
distributed at tonight's Student
Town Meeting for discussion. The
ASSU Senate will approve a final
version of student budget priori
ties at its meeting tomorrow.
The ASSU proposal is based
upon the recommendations from
the Faculty Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford, but it varies in several
important areas.
"We believe that we have been
more specific and thorough than

the faculty," said junior Beth
Morgan, a member of the Council
of Presidents. "We have touched
on almost every area of the Uni
versity."
Morgan said it is important for
the University to remember "not
to cut the things that make Stan
ford unique" to avoid losing
"quality students."
The recommendations come
less than two weeks before the
University Cabinet sets budget
cutting targets for the schools and
administrative areas to reduce the
$400-million operating budget by
approximately 10 percent.
The ASSU suggested several
areas that should be cut and oth
ers that should be preserved. The
recommendations include:
• continuing to fund interde

partmental programs because
they are "relatively inexpensive";
• consolidating existing schools
while maintaining their academic
programs;
• retaining lecturers because
"in many cases they provide some
of the most outstanding instruc
tion at a low per-class cost";
• maintaining a strong com
mitment to the arts;
• considering combining the
science libraries into a West Cam
pus Technical Library; and
• modeling more overseas cam
puses on the less-expensive Kyoto
example.
While these preliminary rec
ommendations may change after
students express their reactions
tonight, senators and members of
the COP realize they cannot make

There will be a Student
Town Meeting to discuss
budget cuts tonight at 7 p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium. Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy and other key play
ers in the budget-cutting pro
cess will be on hand to
address as well as listen to
students' concerns.

everyone happy.
"This is not a document that
can please everybody. It contains
many unpleasant truths," said
deputy senate chair Neil Crellin.
