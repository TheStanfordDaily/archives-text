## It could have been me 
### 
The images we get of the
Farm are those of a bucolic fun-in
the-sun place. Resident assistants
who know our names when we arrive,
late night talks, going everywhere in
groups and thousands of other things
that make freshman year special.
But this year a freshman woman found
something at Stanford she would have
probably preferred to leave undiscovered
— a man she would later accuse of being
her rapist.
As I read, I thought about how changed
this woman's Stanford experience had
become. She does not share my happy
memories of being a freshman.
Her story took me hack to my freshman
year, with all its innggence and naivete. I
again felt the fear as I remembered a cer
tain incident. I did not have to imagine
being that freshman — I had been her.
One night at a party I bumped into a guy.
He was full of compliments and obviously
flirting, but I wasn't interested. We talked
about random things like football and our
hometowns. The party came to an end and
my friends gathered to walk home. I attempt
ed to say goodnight, but this guy didn't take
the hint. He insisted on walking us home.
When we got back to the dorm my
friends went off to bed, leaving me alone
with him. I stalled around the laundry
room area, making small talk. I purpose
ly stood far away from him and kept the
conversation on bland subjects. I thought

that after a while he'd get tired of talking,
realize I wasn't sending back his signals
and go home. Wrong.
Finally, I decided the nice route was
hopeless and said I was going to bed. I
made comments about my dreadfully
early nine o'clock class. I said my room
mate was a light sleeper and hated when
I noisily came in late. Again, I said good
night and headed for my room.
When I got to the door he grabbed me
and pulled me to him. He began trying to
kiss me, but I pushed him away. I put my
key in the lock, trying to enter my room as
I apologized, saying the noise would wake
my roommate. He grabbed my arm and
fully swung me around. In a voice I'll never
forget, he said, "Do you think I care?"
Fortunately, I had my door opened. I
shoved him away and got in the room.
The next day I realized that had the place
been more deserted and darker, I most
likely would have been added to the
statistics as another rape victim.
When I told the people in my dorm,
some of them got mad at me. Why didn't I
yell for help? Why didn't I perform the
classic kick-'em-in-the-balls maneuver?
They grumbled about him, but it was obvi
ous that they put part of the blame on me.
The attacker later called me back and
"apologized." He was drunk, he didn't
realize his own strength and could he buy
me lunch. Somehow I don't think that a
Big Mac and fries equal what he would

have taken from me.
The shine of my brand new world wore
off. I still wonder why I didn't kick or
scream. Better yet, why didn't I say no
authoritatively instead of making excus
es as to why the present moment wasn't
a good one to attack me? Why was I
blamed for his aggressive and violent
behavior? Why are men taught that they
don't have to listen to no?
I don't find it surprising that this univer
sity has a low rate of rapes reported. I truth
fully doubt that I would have been prepared
to take on the stigma of rape victim. I would
have preferred to suffer in silence, hoping
no one would ever find out, rather than
endure the stares and whispers.
I feel sorry for that freshman woman.
She doesn't have to wonder about any
thing; it's all too real for her. I feel sorry
for the attacker who's big concern seems
to be that this could ruin his life. I feel
sorry for all the women who keep the
pain hidden inside. I feel the most sorrow
for all the sick men that do this. I think
that they ask themselves the question my
attacker asked me — "Do you think I
care?" and obviously the answer is no.
