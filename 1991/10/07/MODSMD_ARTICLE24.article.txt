## Fighting Irish defeat the Card 42-26 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
If both Stanford and Notre Dame had
something to prove going into Saturday
night's game, it was the Irish who made their
point. The eight ranked Fighting Irish came
into Stanford Stadium looking to avenge last
year's upset by the Cardinal, and in the pro
cess posted a solid 42-26 victory that fore
warned of possible greatness to come. Stan
ford, hoping to join the ranks of the football
elite with back-to-back wins over the Irish, in
the end could only praise the victors.

"I think Notre Dame has a great chance to
win the National Championship," said Stan
ford head coach Denny Green after watching
his team drop to one and three on the season.
"With their schedule and who they play, when
the shaking gets done if they deserve to be
national champions, the win-loss will proba
bly not keep them from doing it."
Last year Stanford became the first team
since 1954 to beat Notre Dame at home while
it was the number one ranked school in the
nation. The Cardinal's 36-31 victory at South
Bend a year ago was the first time Stanford
had beaten the Fighting Irish. With their
lucky leprechaun mascot and plenty of fans in
tow, Notre Dame came to the Farm primed to
make sure Stanford did not make it two in a

row.
"You definitely want to look at (revenge),
but you don't want to base the game solely on
revenge because revenge won't win the ball
game for you," said Notre Dame fullback
Jerome Bettis, whose team improved to four
to one on the year. "We had to come in and
concentrate. We knew what we had to do, so
we just went out and tried to do it."
And they did it well Saturday night. Notre
Dame came out with a strong running attack
that exploited the Cardinal for consistent big
gains and led to four touchdowns in the first
five Irish possessions. By the half Stanford
was down 28-7 and had seen more than
enough of the Irish running attack. Notre
Dame tailback Tony Brooks and fullback
Jerome Bettis found themselves with huge
holes, and each rambled for over 100 yards
before the first half gun sounded. Stanford
might have known what to expect, but they
could not stop it.
"It wasn't that they did anything new, it
was just that they did what they had to do
very well," said Cardinal noseguard Aaron
Rembisz. "They came ready to play and basi
cally they put it to us."
Even though the Cardinal never got closer
than two touchdowns of the Irish, Stanford
still managed to move the ball efficiently but
with little scoring consistency. The Cardinal
held the ball only a minute less than the Irish,
and gained only nine fewer yards (487 to 468),
yet could not make every drive count.
Stanford opened the game receiving the
ball, and raised a few Cardinal spirits with a
nice looking opening drive. Starting on their
own 24, Glyn Milburn took the opening hand
off 19 yards off the left end and began what
would be a 58 yard move to the Irish 18. On

Green went with his kicking
unit, symbolic of things to come,
Aaron Mills missed a 34-yard field goal.
The Irish got the ball back and took only
2:22 to go 80 yards on seven plays for the
game's initial score, beginning a trend that
stayed fairly consistent for the rest of the half.
Stanford would drive for a while, give up the
ball for an Irish score, then get the ball back
only to lose it to another Notre Dame touch
down.
"We moved the ball, but did not score," said
Green. "We moved, moved the ball, but we
didn't stop them. They're a physical team and
we did not strike. They (were) a better football
team tonight and they proved it."
A second quarter fumble by the Irish pro
vided the Cardinal with its first score when
Albert Richardson recovered a Brooks fumble
at the ND 40. Stanford took over t he ball, and
three plays later saw Tommy Vardell break off
the right tackle for a 27-yard touchdown run.
The big fullback would end the day with 141
yards on 23 attempts, but like his team's
rushing attack as a whole, could not consis
tently find daylight.
"I really don't know why things opened up
and why they seemed to close down," said
Vardell. "It could have to do with their defen
sive scheme, but I think a lot of it had to do
with momentum swings. We stopped them on
the first series (of the second half and gener
ated a little momentum our way."
The Irish received the ball to start the sec
ond half and were forced to punt, a rarity at
that point. Behind a loud crowd, and Vardell
runs of 23 and 22 yards, Stanford quarterback
Jason Palumbis guided his team 80 yards on

Touchdown Tommy Vardell made three touchdowns and racked up 141 yards Saturday night but it was not enough to slow down the dom
i inating Notre Dame squad.
10 plays, lunging twoyards for the
climatic touchdown. Now 28-14 in
favor of the Irish, the game seemed
to finally have become the contest
that most fans expected, but Notre
Dame would have none of it. After
losing a 24-15 first half lead last
year, the Irish were determined to

offset any chance at deja vu.
"Definitely we thought about
(Stanford coming back) and that is
why we didn't want to slack off and
give them any ground," said Bettis.
"We wanted to pound them and
keep pounding them."
After trading punts, Notre
Dame went up 35-14 on a Rick
Mirer screen pass to Bettis, and
then Rod Smith intercepted a
Palumbis pass on the Stanford 19
to set up another Irish score. Bettis

dove in from the one to make it 42-
14, ending the day with four touch
downs.
"Our linemen did an outstand
ing job and we tried to neutralize
some of their twisting and stunting
and things like that they had done
on some other people," said Holtz.
"We hung in there and did what we
had to do to win, and that is it."
With 14:49 left in the fourth
quarter Green brought in back-up
quarterback Steve Stenstrom to

give him some experience, and the
sophomore responded with eight
of-10 passing for 124 yards, in the
process guiding the Cardinal to two
more touchdowns. But it was too
little too late. Vardell plunged in
from the one to make it 42-20, and
after the Irish were forced to punt,
Vardell ended a nice 70-yard drive
with a two-yard dive over the top.
After each score the Cardinal tried
two point conversions and failed,
settling for the 42-26 final score.

at the ND 40. Stanford took over t he ball, and
three plays later saw Tommy Vardell break off
the right tackle for a 27-yard touchdown run.
The big fullback would end the day with 141
yards on 23 attempts, but like his team's
rushing attack as a whole, could not consis
tently find daylight.
"I really don't know why things opened up
and why they seemed to close down," said
Vardell. "It could have to do with their defen
sive scheme, but I think a lot of it had to do
with momentum swings. We stopped them on
the first series (of the second half and gener
ated a little momentum our way."
The Irish received the ball to start the sec
ond half and were forced to punt, a rarity at
that point. Behind a loud crowd, and Vardell

10 plays, lunging twoyards for the
climatic touchdown. Now 28-14 in
favor of the Irish, the game seemed
to finally have become the contest
that most fans expected, but Notre
Dame would have none of it. After
losing a 24-15 first half lead last
year, the Irish were determined to

offset any chance at deja vu.
"Definitely we thought about
(Stanford coming back) and that is
why we didn't want to slack off and
give them any ground," said Bettis.
"We wanted to pound them and
keep pounding them."
After trading punts, Notre
Dame went up 35-14 on a Rick
Mirer screen pass to Bettis, and
then Rod Smith intercepted a
Palumbis pass on the Stanford 19
to set up another Irish score. Bettis

dove in from the one to make it 42-
14, ending the day with four touch
downs.
"Our linemen did an outstand
ing job and we tried to neutralize
some of their twisting and stunting
and things like that they had done
on some other people," said Holtz.
"We hung in there and did what we
had to do to win, and that is it."
With 14:49 left in the fourth
quarter Green brought in back-up
quarterback Steve Stenstrom to

give him some experience, and the
sophomore responded with eight
of-10 passing for 124 yards, in the
process guiding the Cardinal to two
more touchdowns. But it was too
little too late. Vardell plunged in
from the one to make it 42-20, and
after the Irish were forced to punt,
Vardell ended a nice 70-yard drive
with a two-yard dive over the top.
After each score the Cardinal tried
two point conversions and failed,
settling for the 42-26 final score.
If both Stanford and Notre Dame had
something to prove going into Saturday
night's game, it was the Irish who made their
point. The eight ranked Fighting Irish came
into Stanford Stadium looking to avenge last
year's upset by the Cardinal, and in the pro
cess posted a solid 42-26 victory that fore
warned of possible greatness to come. Stan
ford, hoping to join the ranks of the football
elite with back-to-back wins over the Irish, in
the end could only praise the victors.

"I think Notre Dame has a great chance to
win the National Championship," said Stan
ford head coach Denny Green after watching
his team drop to one and three on the season.
"With their schedule and who they play, when
the shaking gets done if they deserve to be
national champions, the win-loss will proba
bly not keep them from doing it."
Last year Stanford became the first team
since 1954 to beat Notre Dame at home while
it was the number one ranked school in the
nation. The Cardinal's 36-31 victory at South
Bend a year ago was the first time Stanford
had beaten the Fighting Irish. With their
lucky leprechaun mascot and plenty of fans in
tow, Notre Dame came to the Farm primed to
make sure Stanford did not make it two in a

row.
"You definitely want to look at (revenge),
but you don't want to base the game solely on
revenge because revenge won't win the ball
game for you," said Notre Dame fullback
Jerome Bettis, whose team improved to four
to one on the year. "We had to come in and
concentrate. We knew what we had to do, so
we just went out and tried to do it."
And they did it well Saturday night. Notre
Dame came out with a strong running attack
that exploited the Cardinal for consistent big
gains and led to four touchdowns in the first
five Irish possessions. By the half Stanford
was down 28-7 and had seen more than
enough of the Irish running attack. Notre
Dame tailback Tony Brooks and fullback
Jerome Bettis found themselves with huge
holes, and each rambled for over 100 yards
before the first half gun sounded. Stanford
might have known what to expect, but they
could not stop it.
"It wasn't that they did anything new, it
was just that they did what they had to do
very well," said Cardinal noseguard Aaron
Rembisz. "They came ready to play and basi
cally they put it to us."
Even though the Cardinal never got closer
than two touchdowns of the Irish, Stanford
still managed to move the ball efficiently but
with little scoring consistency. The Cardinal
held the ball only a minute less than the Irish,
and gained only nine fewer yards (487 to 468),
yet could not make every drive count.
Stanford opened the game receiving the
ball, and raised a few Cardinal spirits with a
nice looking opening drive. Starting on their
own 24, Glyn Milburn took the opening hand
off 19 yards off the left end and began what
would be a 58 yard move to the Irish 18. On

Green went with his kicking
unit, symbolic of things to come,
Aaron Mills missed a 34-yard field goal.
The Irish got the ball back and took only
2:22 to go 80 yards on seven plays for the
game's initial score, beginning a trend that
stayed fairly consistent for the rest of the half.
Stanford would drive for a while, give up the
ball for an Irish score, then get the ball back
only to lose it to another Notre Dame touch
down.
"We moved the ball, but did not score," said
Green. "We moved, moved the ball, but we
didn't stop them. They're a physical team and
we did not strike. They (were) a better football
team tonight and they proved it."
A second quarter fumble by the Irish pro
vided the Cardinal with its first score when
Albert Richardson recovered a Brooks fumble
at the ND 40. Stanford took over t he ball, and
three plays later saw Tommy Vardell break off
the right tackle for a 27-yard touchdown run.
