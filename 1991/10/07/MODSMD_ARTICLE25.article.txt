# Little differences give Card big loss

### Amy Howard Staff writer 
In a deja vu-with-a-twist per
formance, Notre Dame fullback
Jerome Bettis did Saturday
night what Cardinal fullback
Tommy Vardell was able to do
against the Irish one year ago.
In the final tally the 5-foot-ll
inch, 247-lb sophomore
accounted for four of Notre
Dame's six touchdowns and car
ried the ball 24 times for 179
yards.
Last year it was Vardell who
took the ball into the end zone
four times against the Irish,
scoring the game-winning
touchdown with 0:36 left and
earning himself the nickname
"Touchdown Tommy." He put
forth another outstanding effort
on Saturday, gaining 140 yards
on 23 carries for three touch
downs. This time, however, it
was not enough.
In a game that looked more
balanced on paper than it did on
the field, the Irish offensive line,
Bettis, and senior tailback Tony
Brooks made the little differ
ences that added up in a big way.
Stanford had the same number
of first downs as Notre Dame,
controlled the ball for the same
amount of time, and only had 19
fewer net yards.
But the real story was told in
the rushing statistics. At the
half, the Cardinal had gained 88
yards on the ground while the
Irish had piled up 250. Both Bet
tis and Brooks had already bro
ken the century mark in net
yards gained, while the Cardinal
was led by Vardell's 52. By the
game's end, Notre Dame had
rushed for a whopping 363

yards as opposed to the Cardi
nal's 191.
Bettis established himself as
a threat early on. On the Irish's
first possession, he ran ofT the
right tackle for 22 yards, bring
ing the ball to the Stanford 27
and setting up the touchdown
pass that occurred three plays
later. On the Irish's second pos
session, Bettis ran to the right
for 16 yards, up the middle for
two, and then straight into the
end zone on three consecutive
plays. As Stanford's defensive
line was tied up in heavy com
bat, he appeared to have free
reign on the field, darting
through gaping holes and neatly
side-stepping potential trouble
spots.
It was clear that Bettis owed
many thanks to the men up
front. "The offensive line played
a great game today. Everything
I got is a credit to them," he
said.
Cardinal nose guard Aaron
Rembisz was one of the unfortu
nate people on the receiving end
of the offensive onslaught.
"That guy (Bettis) is definitely a
tough one to stop," he said. "It's
bad enough when they put a
blocker in front of him; just
catching him alone is a chal
lenge, though."
The Irish's success on the
ground continued to frustrate the
Cardinal defensive line through
out the game. "We came in with a
good degree of confidence. We felt
like we had finally found the
defense that we're capable of play
ing," Rembisz said. "I think we let
ourselves down. There were some
great individual efforts, but for
the most part we didn't play up to
our expectations."
