# Men capture tourney winning back-to-back
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's
soccer team continued
to perform like a top
20 squad this week-

end, winning both of its games en
route to a championship in the
Security Pacific/S tan ford Cardinal
Classic.
On Friday, the Cardinal (6-2-
3) edged out a tough Cal State-
Northridge squad, 2-1. The Divi
sion II Matadors (6-3-0), while a
decided underdog, were very
much up to the task of facing
Stanford. Indeed, the Cardinal
helped its opponent overcome any
pre game jitters by getting off to a
slow start, missing several scor
ing opportunities early in the first
half.
According to Cardinal coach
Colin Lindores, slow starts have
plagued his squad whenever they
have faced lesser opponents.

"When we start out badly against
teams like Northridge," said Lin
dores, "other teams realize that
we might not be as good as our
reputation is. It hurts us more
than it normally would."
Stanford finally got on the
board against the Matadors on a
bizarre play 29 minutes into the
first half. Sophomore fullback
Ricky Goad tossed a throw-in
from about 15 yards which
deflected off of Northridge's
Terry Davila and rolled into the
net uncontested.
Stanford's Jim Talluto made it
2-0 early in the second half, con
necting on another Goad throw
in for his team-leading seventh
goal. Midway through the second
half, Northridge cut the lead to 2-
1 when Matador midfielder John
Alevras scored on a corner kick by
Steve Linhart.
That was a close as Northridge
would get. Once again, Stanford
was paced by the outstanding
efforts of goalie Kyle Krpata, who
tallied a season-high eight saves in
the match.
Yesterday, the Cardinal cruised
by an outclassed Texas Christian
team, 4-0. The score was not
indicative of the game, a contest
that Stanford could easily have
won by eight or nine goals. For
Lindores, the four goal margin of
victory was not nearly enough.
"We created a multitude of
missed opportunities," said the
Stanford coach. "I hate to down

play opponents, but against a
team like this (TCU was 1-11-0
entering the match), we need to be
sharper. Frankly, I'm infuriated."
Despite all of the scoring, the
real stars of the TCU game were
the Cardinal defense. Thanks to
the efforts of fullbacks Jason
Vanacour and Jeff Kogl, the
Horned Frogs managed only one
real scoring threat the entire
game. With the score at 2-0,
TCU's Sean Moody was headed
for what seemed like a certain
breakaway goal, drilling a shot
head-on from about six yards.
Krpata preserved his shutout
with one of his best saves on the
year. Lunging to his right, the
junior deflected the ball over the
crossbar by inches. Krpata, who
has allowed only three goads in his
last four games, picked up his sec
ond shutout in the TCU match,
and lowered his goals against
average to a stingy 1.16 per game.
