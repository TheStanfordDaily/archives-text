# Men capture tourney winning back-to-back
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's
soccer team continued
to perform like a top
20 squad this week-

end, winning both of its games en
route to a championship in the
Security Pacific/S tan ford Cardinal
Classic.
On Friday, the Cardinal (6-2-
3) edged out a tough Cal State-
Northridge squad, 2-1. The Divi
sion II Matadors (6-3-0), while a
decided underdog, were very
much up to the task of facing
Stanford. Indeed, the Cardinal
helped its opponent overcome any
pre game jitters by getting off to a
slow start, missing several scor
ing opportunities early in the first
half.
According to Cardinal coach
Colin Lindores, slow starts have
plagued his squad whenever they
have faced lesser opponents.

"When we start out badly against
teams like Northridge," said Lin
dores, "other teams realize that
we might not be as good as our
reputation is. It hurts us more
than it normally would."
Stanford finally got on the
board against the Matadors on a
bizarre play 29 minutes into the
first half. Sophomore fullback
Ricky Goad tossed a throw-in
from about 15 yards which
deflected off of Northridge's
Terry Davila and rolled into the
net uncontested.
Stanford's Jim Talluto made it
2-0 early in the second half, con
necting on another Goad throw
in for his team-leading seventh
