## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
This weekend, the Cardinal
women's soccer team proved that
their excellence is not solely limit
ed to West Coast foes.
The Security Pacific Cardinal
Tournament saw Stanford square
off against two of the East Coast's
best, with results that have
become almost routine — both
Brown and No.lO-ranked Duke

hands of the Card hooters.

Cardinal 1, Duke 0

In Friday's game against the
Bruins, sophomore Sarah
Rafanelli scored a pair of goals
while Julie Foudy had a goal and
one assist to lead Stanford to its
eighth victory of the season.
The Brown game looked as
though it might be a challenge as
the ball stayed on Stanford's end
of the field for the first couple of
minutes of the game. However,
fifteen minutes after the game
had started, the Cardinal was
firmly in control and never looked
back in handing the Bruins their
fifth loss of the season, 5-0.

Eleven minutes into the game,
Rafanelli put the ball past Brown
keeper Kristen Stevens after a
series of near-misses by the Card
offense to put Stanford on the
scoreboard.
One minute and 51 seconds
later, midfielder Jen Gardiner
scored her first goal of the year off
a short cross from Jen Potok to
pad the Cardinal lead to 2-0.
At 14:41 of the half, Rafanelli
struck again. She scored her
ninth goal of the season after
Stevens made a terrific save of a
shot by Foudy.
Although the Cardinal did not
score again in the half, the ball
was almost constantly on Brown's
side of the field and Leslie Gar
rard, the Cardinal goalkeeper,
could have caught some Z's. In
fact, Garrard only had to make
two saves in notching her fifth
shutout of the season.
Garrard left the game with 18
minutes left and was replaced by
Wendy Kevan, who did not face a
shot while finishing up the game.
Foudy scored her 13th goal of
the season at 63:31 of the game
off a short cross from forward
Elizabeth Joneschild. The goal
tied the single-season record of 13
goals held by Jennifer Rowland,
who accomplished the feat two
years ago.
Although the Cardinal domi
nated yesterday's game against

Duke as well, the score was much
closer and the game became a
nail-biter as the Duke keeper
repeatedly thwarted several Card
scoring chances.
The lone goal of the contest
was scored by senior sweeper
Heather Mclntyre on a penalty
kick at 28:00. It was Mclntyre's
third goal of the season, each hav
ing come on a penalty kick.
Julie Foudy saw her goal-scor
ing streak stopped at six games as
she was shut out for only the sec
ond time this season. However,
Foudy had anything but an off
game as she made a number of
tremendous crowd-pleasing runs
at the goal, only to have the Duke
keeper make diving save after div
ing save.
Despite the victory over a
nationally ranked opponent, the
Stanford team did not seem par
ticularly happy with the game. -
"It's frustrating that, even
though we dominated the game,
we were only up one to nothing,"
Garrard said. "I was sweating bul
lets in the last thirty minutes."
The first truly closely fought
contest in Stanford's laughter
filled 1991 season tested the met
tle of this Cardinal team, who
with their victory over Duke
proved without a doubt that Stan
ford must be considered a top
threat to take the NCAA title ti ; "
