When the other team scores the first
goal of the game and then the last three
goals of the game, it is not a good sign for
your team.

Waterpolo

Cardinal 10

UC-Davis 4

Then again, if the other team does not
score any other goals, while you are scoring
10 of your own, things should be going
pretty well.
That is exactly what happened Friday
afternoon at deGuerre Pool as the seventh
ranked Stanford water polo team overcame
a sluggish start and breezed by unranked
UC-Davis by a score of 10-4.
After Davis' Doug Wright scored to give
his team an early 1-0 lead, the Cardinal
came back and took a 5-1 lead by halftime.
In the third quarter, the game was really
blown open as Stanford enjoyed one of its
more prolific scoring quarters of the year
to take a commanding 9-1 advantage.
Freshman standout Wolf Wigo led the
way with four goals and teammate Adam
Musch added two. Four others contributed

with one goal apiece. The game would have
been even more of a runaway except that
Davis goalkeeper Andy Dewitt had 18 saves
and continually thwarted Cardinal scoring
opportunities.
Despite the victory, Coach Dante Detta
manti was not too pleased with his team's
performance. "I'm really not at all satisfied
with the game. Against a team like Davis,
we should win by at least 10 goals and
should be able to dominate. We just
haven't reached that dominating level
yet."
Scoring has been the problem all year
long for the Cardinal —whose record is
now 7-6 — and Dettamanti was not
encouraged by Friday's game.
"The game underscores the basic prob
lem with our team, and that is scoring. It
was pretty typical of all of our games, Wolf
is scoring and nobody else is finding the
goal."
Dettamanti continued, "Their goalie
played a good game, but it seems like every
goalie we play has a good game. I think it
has more to do with our shooting. The
shots were there and we had a lot of oppor
tunities, but we just couldn't make the
shots."
On Saturday afternoon in the alumni
game, this year's Stanford team once again
had problems putting the ball in the net,
and the alumni team went on to win by a
score of 12-4.
