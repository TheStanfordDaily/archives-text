# Card pulls out win in marathon match
## No. 1 women pushed to first five-game match of season against New Mexico 
### George Malone Staff writer 
For the first time this season, the Stanford
women's volleyball team encountered a team
that they could not dispatch with ease. For the
first time this season, Stanford played a five
game match. But for the twelfth time this sea
son, Stanford emerged victorious against the
New Mexico Lobos.
The Cardinal beat the Lobos 15-12,10-15,16-
14, 3-15, 15-10 in front of over 3,000 fans at
Maples Pavilion in the Security Pacific Stanford
Invitational last Friday night to retain its unde
feated No. 1-ranking, despite the fact that No.
11 New Mexico tallied more hits and digs than
Stanford.
The Cardinal wasn't itself on Friday night.
One game the women were on, the next they
were off.
"I think the problem was.. .ourselves. We
were really streaky," junior Kathy Jurgens said.
"We didn't play very well and the players
know it. . .. We were sloppy offensively. The key
was (thatJ we did what we had to do when we
had to," said coach Don Shaw.
The crowd, which was fairly vocal in the first
two games, really got into the match in game
three. Stanford raced out to a four-zero lead

Cardinal defeats New Mexico

with good hitting and blocking, but then New
Mexico began to force Cardinal errors and catch
up.
"We were passing poorly," Shaw said.
The Lobos capitalized on more Stanford
errors to move to match point at 14-11, and
then the Cardinal came alive again. Stanford got
the sideout on a pretty dink by Klein, and then
the number one team played up to its potential.
Klein began the run with an ace which got the
team and the crowd fired up, and after the
teams traded sideouts, the Cardinal did not give
up the ball again.
After seniors Jennifer Jackson and Amy
Cooper each recorded blocks for points to tie the
game, Jackson pounded the ball down to give
Stanford game point and bring the crowd to its
feet.
In what can only be described as the mother
of all rallies, Stanford won the game on a mon
ster kill by Oden after the Lobos had blocked

and digged several previous Oden swings.
The crowd was going crazy, the Stanford
players were pumped and had the momentum,
and the teams switched sides for what would
certainly be the final game.
NOT.
"We went flat," Klein said.
"It wasn't a letdown. It was a breakdown. We
were disorganized and tentative," Shaw said.
"It felt like we couldn't get anything going,"
said junior setter Carrie Feldman.
Suddenly the match was tied at two games
apiece, and Stanford faced its first fifth game of
1991. In collegiate volleyball, the fifth game is
scored differently from the others in that a point
is scored for each sideout. As a result, the game
is usually quick and unpredictable.
The Cardinal players rose to the occasion and
played tremendous defense, clamping down on
the New Mexico hitters. The offense regained its
life as well, with Oden, Klein, and Jackson all
making clutch kills to give Stanford a 9-5 lead
that it never relinquished.
"We built a little cushion. My theory for fifth
games is that you go out and stay aggressive.
Our blocking was great and we didn't let up on
our serving," Shaw said.
"We just listened to Don. . .and played our
game," Feldman said.
