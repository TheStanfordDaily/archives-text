Five finalists have been chosen for the
newly created position of vice president of stu
dent resources, concluding a national search by
a committee headed by Provost James Rosse.
The new vice president will "pull together
all of the units that have supported student
affairs and student services," according to
Associate Vice President of Human Resources
Tina Kass. The position also entails working
with the faculty and managing the many stu
dent services and programs.
According to the committee's undergradu
ate representative, Valerie Mih, the members
were looking for "someone who has held an
executive student resources position in the
past, which disqualified a lot of people,
because you almost had to be a vice president
in another school. We were also looking for
people who had experience with budget cuts
and layoffs."
The Vice President of Student Resources
Search Committee, which consists of five staff
members, three professors and two students,
conducted the preliminary screening inter
views of at least 30 applicants.
All five finalists will be holding open meet
ings at Stanford this month to ensure that all
Stanford students, faculty and staff have a
chance to meet and discuss student concerns
with them.
