Stuart Thomas will enter a
plea of "not guilty" to charges of
statutory rape and furnishing
alcohol to a minor in Palo Alto
Municipal Court at 1:30 p.m.
today, according to his lawyer
Melvin de la Motte.
Thomas, a Stanford junior,
was released from Santa Clara
County Jail in San Jose late last
week after posting bail of
$80,000.
Today the court is also sched
uled to set the date for a prelimi
nary hearing, at which prosecution
and defense lawyers will present
evidence. A judge will then deter
mine whether there is enough evi
dence against Thomas for a trial.
Thomas is charged with a
felony and a misdemeanor in con
nection with a student's report
that she was sexually assaulted in
a Stern Hall dormitory the week

end before classes began. The
charges — unlawful sexual inter
course with a minor, commonly
known as statutory rape, and fur
nishing alcohol to a minor — carry
a maximum combined penalty of
18 months and a $500 fine.
Thomas was arraigned on
Wednesday before Judge Charles
Cory, who will also preside over
today's proceedings.
At the arraignment, de la
Motte said Thomas is "absolutely
innocent." He made separate
motions that Thomas be released
on his own recognizance and then
that bail be lowered to $10,000.
In support of these motions, de
la Motte cited Thomas' lack of a
previous police record and the
fact that he is not being charged
with forcible rape. Cory denied
both motions on the grounds that
Thomas might try to contact his
accuser.
