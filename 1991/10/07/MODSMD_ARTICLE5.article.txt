# Coercion or consent? Alleged assault blurs definitions of rape
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
Where is the line between per
suasion and forcible rape? And how
does alcohol complicate the issue?
The arrest of Stuart Thomas, a
junior, in connection with an
alleged Sept. 22 sexual assault in
Stern Hall has confronted the
Stanford community with these
questions and others.
Thomas is charged with statuto
ry rape and furnishing alcohol to a
minor, although Stanford Police
Detective Tim Frecceri's initial
conclusions — based on interviews
with the woman, residents of the
dormitory where the alleged
assault took place and others —
were that Thomas should be
charged with forcible and statutory
rape as well as six related charges.
Under California law, forcible
rape applies where a person is
prevented from resisting by an
intoxicating substance adminis
tered by the accused. Statutory
rape is sexual intercourse with a
female under 18, with or without
her consent.
Woman felt a 'certain coercion'
When Frecceri interviewed the
woman the day after the alleged
assault, she said Thomas had not

Section 261 of the California
penal code defines rape as an
act of sexual intercourse under
various circumstances, includ
ing those where a person is
prevented from resisting by
any intoxicating substance
administered by or with the
privity of the accused.

threatened her. But she said she
felt a "certain coercion," mention
ing Thomas' physical size, the
manner in which he spoke to her
and the impairment of her judg
ment due to alcohol.
At 6-foot-7, Thomas is a foot
and a half taller than the woman.
He weighs approximately 215
pounds.
In his Sept. 23 request for a
warrant to search Thomas' room
for evidence, Frecceri wrote that
the woman had said "she was so
drunk that she did not know what
she was doing, and that (if she
had) not consumed the alcohol
provided by Stuart that she never
would have 'done this.' "
After interviewing the woman
again, Frecceri said in his Sept. 29
report: "I once again asked ... if
she had felt any intimidation, fear
or threat, either displayed or ver
balized, from the suspect, on the
night of the sexual assault. (Her)
response was the same as it had
been when first interviewed:
"No, she did not experience
these feelings; instead, it was the
combination of the alcohol's effect
on her, and the smooth, persuad
ing manner in which the suspect
talked to her, that led to her hav
ing the sexual activity with the
suspect."
Thomas spoke with dean
Frecceri also recorded in his
second report a statement from
Residence Dean Angela Rickford,
who spoke with Thomas before
his arrest.
Thomas told Rickford that he
and the woman were drinking alco
hol and that he knew she was 17,
"but everybody drinks, it's no big
deal," according to the police report.

He told Rickford that he "fon
dled" the woman, that she wanted
to have intercourse and that it
was her idea, the report said.
When Rickford asked what exact
ly he and the woman did, he
reportedly said, "Well, I'm not
going to tell you."
Thomas told Rickford that at
some point after the woman was
undressed, she borrowed his robe
and left his room to go to the
bathroom.
Frecceri wrote that he asked
the woman whether she had worn
Thomas' robe. She said she bor
rowed the robe, walked down
stairs to the women's bathroom
and then returned to his second
floor room.
She told Frecceri she did not
know when this occurred during
the sequence of events because of
the alcohol's effects.
District attorney did not
charge force
Santa Clara County Deputy
District Attorney Dale Sanderson,
after reviewing Frecceri's reports
and those of other investigating
officers, decided to charge

Thomas with two of the eight
charges Frecceri originally recom
mended. Both charges hinge on
the woman's age.
Sanderson is the county's
supervising district attorney for
sex offenses.
"We make those charges we
can reasonably believe ajury of 12
would convict beyond a reason
able doubt," Sanderson said. "It
would be ludicrous to issue
charges for which we don't have
that expectation."
Investigators and attorneys
close to the case declined to specu
late as to what, if any, charges
might have been brought against
Thomas if the woman had been
over 21.
"I don't deal in hypothetical,"
Sanderson said. "I deal with the
real thing."
Frecceri said a forcible rape
charge was not filed because "our
investigation had not established
that there were enough elements
of that crime."
Experts said the statutory rape
charge may indicate the district
attorney believed the woman's
lack of consent would be difficult

to prove.
A statutory rape charge with
out a forcible rape charge is "very
unusual," according to Law
School Prof. Michael Wald. He
said the district attorney would
probably only do that "if there
was a problem in proving there
was no consent."
Law School Prof. Robert Weis
berg agreed. "The D.A. must have
felt that the no-consent case was
weak," he said.
"I was wondering why the case
was taking so long, and now it
appears that it was because of
fuzzy evidence," Weisberg added.
Law School Prof. Barbara Bab
cock said even without the charge
of forcible rape, a jury might be
swayed against convicting a
defendant of statutory rape if
forcible rape were not proven.
"The issue of consent comes up
almost inevitably," Babcock said.
"A jury is not supposed to take
the behavior of the minor into
consideration, but they always
do."

second report a statement from
Residence Dean Angela Rickford,
who spoke with Thomas before
his arrest.
Thomas told Rickford that he
and the woman were drinking alco
hol and that he knew she was 17,
"but everybody drinks, it's no big
deal," according to the police report.

He told Rickford that he "fon
dled" the woman, that she wanted
to have intercourse and that it
was her idea, the report said.
When Rickford asked what exact
ly he and the woman did, he
reportedly said, "Well, I'm not
going to tell you."
Thomas told Rickford that at
some point after the woman was
undressed, she borrowed his robe
and left his room to go to the
bathroom.
Frecceri wrote that he asked
the woman whether she had worn
Thomas' robe. She said she bor
rowed the robe, walked down
stairs to the women's bathroom
and then returned to his second
floor room.
She told Frecceri she did not
know when this occurred during
the sequence of events because of
the alcohol's effects.
District attorney did not
charge force
Santa Clara County Deputy
District Attorney Dale Sanderson,
after reviewing Frecceri's reports
and those of other investigating
officers, decided to charge

Thomas with two of the eight
charges Frecceri originally recom
mended. Both charges hinge on
the woman's age.
Sanderson is the county's
supervising district attorney for
sex offenses.
"We make those charges we
can reasonably believe ajury of 12
would convict beyond a reason
able doubt," Sanderson said. "It
would be ludicrous to issue
charges for which we don't have
that expectation."
Investigators and attorneys
close to the case declined to specu
late as to what, if any, charges
might have been brought against
Thomas if the woman had been
over 21.
"I don't deal in hypothetical,"
Sanderson said. "I deal with the
real thing."
Frecceri said a forcible rape
charge was not filed because "our
investigation had not established
that there were enough elements
of that crime."
Experts said the statutory rape
charge may indicate the district
attorney believed the woman's
lack of consent would be difficult

to prove.
A statutory rape charge with
out a forcible rape charge is "very
unusual," according to Law
School Prof. Michael Wald. He
said the district attorney would
probably only do that "if there
was a problem in proving there
was no consent."
Law School Prof. Robert Weis
berg agreed. "The D.A. must have
felt that the no-consent case was
weak," he said.
"I was wondering why the case
was taking so long, and now it
appears that it was because of
fuzzy evidence," Weisberg added.
Law School Prof. Barbara Bab
cock said even without the charge
of forcible rape, a jury might be
swayed against convicting a
defendant of statutory rape if
forcible rape were not proven.
"The issue of consent comes up
almost inevitably," Babcock said.
"A jury is not supposed to take
the behavior of the minor into
consideration, but they always
do."

Where is the line between per
suasion and forcible rape? And how
does alcohol complicate the issue?
The arrest of Stuart Thomas, a
junior, in connection with an
alleged Sept. 22 sexual assault in
Stern Hall has confronted the
Stanford community with these
questions and others.
Thomas is charged with statuto
ry rape and furnishing alcohol to a
minor, although Stanford Police
Detective Tim Frecceri's initial
conclusions — based on interviews
with the woman, residents of the
dormitory where the alleged
assault took place and others —
were that Thomas should be
charged with forcible and statutory
rape as well as six related charges.
Under California law, forcible
rape applies where a person is
prevented from resisting by an
intoxicating substance adminis
tered by the accused. Statutory
rape is sexual intercourse with a
female under 18, with or without
her consent.
Woman felt a 'certain coercion'
When Frecceri interviewed the
woman the day after the alleged
assault, she said Thomas had not

Section 261 of the California
penal code defines rape as an
act of sexual intercourse under
various circumstances, includ
ing those where a person is
prevented from resisting by
any intoxicating substance
administered by or with the
privity of the accused.

threatened her. But she said she
felt a "certain coercion," mention
ing Thomas' physical size, the
manner in which he spoke to her
and the impairment of her judg
ment due to alcohol.
At 6-foot-7, Thomas is a foot
and a half taller than the woman.
He weighs approximately 215
pounds.
In his Sept. 23 request for a
warrant to search Thomas' room
for evidence, Frecceri wrote that
the woman had said "she was so
drunk that she did not know what
she was doing, and that (if she
had) not consumed the alcohol
provided by Stuart that she never
would have 'done this.' "
After interviewing the woman
again, Frecceri said in his Sept. 29
report: "I once again asked ... if
she had felt any intimidation, fear
or threat, either displayed or ver
balized, from the suspect, on the
night of the sexual assault. (Her)
response was the same as it had
been when first interviewed:
"No, she did not experience
these feelings; instead, it was the
combination of the alcohol's effect
on her, and the smooth, persuad
ing manner in which the suspect
talked to her, that led to her hav
ing the sexual activity with the
suspect."
