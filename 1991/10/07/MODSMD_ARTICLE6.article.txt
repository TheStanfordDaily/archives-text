# First Bulgarian enters Stanford despite obstacles
## 
### Matti Bunzl Staff writer 
In another step toward becoming a world univer
sity, Stanford this year opened its doors for the first
time to a student directly from Eastern Europe.
Tanya Podchiyska, a freshman from Bulgaria,
made her way to the University despite almost insur
mountable obstacles.
Born and raised in Bourgas, a city on the Black
Sea coast, Podchiyska was required to take Russian
in the state schools she attended since third grade.
Not until the eighth grade was Podchiyska able to
attend one of the few Bulgarian schools where teach
ing occurred in English.
She said Marxism was taught in history courses,
although the students never actually read Marx's
books.
Podchiyska, like all other students, was taught to
conform with the communist system. "To survive
you had to trust the ideology" of the Communist
Party, she said.
Bulgaria, ruled by a communist regime since 1944,
was liberated in a revolution on November 10, 1989,
when strong-man Todor Zhivkov was overthrown.
The revolution in 1989 gave way to democracy in
Bulgaria, Podchiyska said. For the first time in years
people could "say what they wanted."
Since the liberation of Bulgaria, Podchiyska said
the schools had to revise their curriculum because "it
was so distorted by the communist ideology."
Before 1989, Podchiyska was set on attending col
lege in her home country. "It never even occurred to
me to come to the United States," she said, explain
ing that "the Bulgarian currency is not convertible to
dollars," making it impossible to finance an educa
tion in the United States.

Born and raised in Bourgas, Bulgaria, freshman Tanya Podchiyska attends what she was told is "the
best university in the country." Podchiyska, who had to overcome numerous obstacles to gain admis
sion into Stanford, is the first student to come to Stanford direct from Eastern Europe.
In 1990 a group of students
from a Canadian college visited
Podchiyska's school. A student
told her about the possibility of
applying to American universi
ties, she said. "Before the visit I
didn't know that colleges offer
scholarships" to international
students.
"I was really enthusiastic,"
Podchiyska said.
Her first problem arose, how
ever, when she realized that nei
ther the SAT nor the Achieve

ment tests were given in Bulgaria.
After writing to the agencies
that administer the exams, "a
testing center was established in
Sofia — just for me and two other
students."
Podchiyska said she scored
1380 overall on the SAT but
couldn't find anyone else with
whom to compare scores. "So I
thought I didn't do well," she said.
Podchiyska requested applica
tion forms from a number of
schools, "but I received some of
them two months after they were
posted. So it was too late to
apply."
She said she applied blindly to
every school that "sent an appli

cation on time," including Har
vard, Dartmouth and the Univer
sity of Chicago, although she
knew nothing about any of the
schools.
During the application process,
she said, mail got lost frequently.
"I sent my Stanford application
three times," she added.
Podchiyska said "several of the
applications were never complet
ed," and by the time she was noti
fied of the missing documents it
was "too late to send them."
She said she received a tele
gram on March 30 from Stanford
telling her she had been accepted.
"When I received the telegram
. . . I saw all these opportunities

opening up for me," she said.
The joy, however, did not last
long. "Suddenly, I realized that
there was no mentioning of any
financial aid in the telegram."
Two painful weeks later, Pod
chiyska said she could truly
rejoice when she received the let
ter containing her financial-aid
package.
Throughout the application
process, Podchiyska, who had
never been to the United States,
knew very little about Stanford.
"My sole source of information
were the bulletins the University
sent me," she said.
Podchiyska said she is very
impressed with Stanford so far.
