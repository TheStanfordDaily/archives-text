# First Bulgarian enters Stanford despite obstacles
## 
### Matti Bunzl Staff writer 
In another step toward becoming a world univer
sity, Stanford this year opened its doors for the first
time to a student directly from Eastern Europe.
Tanya Podchiyska, a freshman from Bulgaria,
made her way to the University despite almost insur
mountable obstacles.
Born and raised in Bourgas, a city on the Black
Sea coast, Podchiyska was required to take Russian
in the state schools she attended since third grade.
Not until the eighth grade was Podchiyska able to
attend one of the few Bulgarian schools where teach
ing occurred in English.
She said Marxism was taught in history courses,
although the students never actually read Marx's
books.
Podchiyska, like all other students, was taught to
conform with the communist system. "To survive
you had to trust the ideology" of the Communist
Party, she said.
Bulgaria, ruled by a communist regime since 1944,
was liberated in a revolution on November 10, 1989,
when strong-man Todor Zhivkov was overthrown.
The revolution in 1989 gave way to democracy in
Bulgaria, Podchiyska said. For the first time in years
people could "say what they wanted."
Since the liberation of Bulgaria, Podchiyska said
the schools had to revise their curriculum because "it
was so distorted by the communist ideology."
Before 1989, Podchiyska was set on attending col
lege in her home country. "It never even occurred to
me to come to the United States," she said, explain
ing that "the Bulgarian currency is not convertible to
dollars," making it impossible to finance an educa
tion in the United States.
