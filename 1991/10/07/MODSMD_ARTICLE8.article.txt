# USSA membership spurs ASSU debate
## 
### Clea Shannon 
Last week's ASSU Seriate
decision to maintain member
ship in the controversial United
States Student Association, a
national student lobbying orga
nization, brought to a head the
ongoing debate about the politi
cal nature of the organization.
The yearlong debate has
divided the senate over whether
the organization is worthy of
Stanford's membership. The
latest discussion over member
ship occurred at an ASSU meet
ing early last week and centered
on graduate senator Larry
Augustin's proposal to discon
tinue membership in the associ
ation, which lobbies for every
thing from financial aid to affir
mative action. The bill was
rejected by a vote of 8-10.
The ASSU currently pays
$1,000 in dues to the associa
tion in exchange for their lob
bying for financial aid and
other issues, but Augustin
argued the organization deals
primarily with financial aid for
undergraduates at public uni
versities and community col
leges rather than private uni
versities such as Stanford.
One California representa
tive on the association's board
of directors, Jose Esteva, report
edly said of private universities:
"They are wealthy whites who
do not need financial aid,"
according to Augustin's bill.
The organization also devotes
resources to U.S. foreign policy
issues, such as recognition of the

Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and aid to Israel.
"In fact," Augustin said,
"almost 70 percent of what (the
association) deals with is be
yond the scope of student
issues." The organization works
mostly "on issues with little to
do with students or student life
on campus."
Claims of reverse discrimi
nation on the part of the asso
ciation were also discussed.
One such claim involved a Jew
ish student on the Latino Cau
cus who attended a National
People of Color Students Coali
tion meeting. He was allegedly
asked to leave because he was
not considered by the coalition
to be a person of color.
However, one undergradu
ate senator, Amy Richard, and
Vanessa Tapia, a director of the
ASSU Financial Aid Office,
both attended the association's
conference and reported having
encountered no such incidents.
"This is the first time that I
have heard about the inci
dent," Tapia said. "Everyone
at the delegation knew that I
am Jewish, and I was included
in all of the meetings."
Many senators said the
association's lobbying power
for financial aid could not be
matched by any other organi
zation.
Council of Presidents mem
ber Beth Morgan disagreed.
"To suggest that the financial
aid office .will no longer exist
(without the group) is prepos
terous," she said.
