# Basics suggested to prevent bike theft
## 
### Katie Mauro 
Only four days after school
started, freshman Ben Casey
joined the growing ranks of stu
dents who have been the victims
of bicycle thieves.
"Having your bike stolen is
about as much fun as having
someone tear through your house
with an AK-47," Casey said. "You
just can't do anything. It's hell."
Stanford has an average thiev
ery rate of 400 to 500 bicycles per
year, according to Dan Smith, coor
dinator of special services for the
Stanford Police. Smith said about
460 bikes were stolen last year.
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said he believes no bike can possibly
be safe enough. "All types of bikes
are stolen, but particularly ones
which are either not locked, locked
to themselves and carried away or
are very expensive," he said.
Bicycle theft can be minimized
by buying a strong lock, especially
a chain, Niemeyer said. He said
that although chains are extreme
ly heavy and hard to handle, bike
thieves can now defeat the U
shaped locks which have become
popular.
"Crooks are now using scissor
jacks to remove Kryptonite locks.
They insert the jack in between
the U and turn it until the steel
fractures," he said.
Casey is one of the students
who found this out the hard way.
"It was really locked . . . safely, I
mean. And when I came back, no
bike," he said. "What a great way
to start the year."
Even when the police do find
stolen bicycles, they are not always
able to return the bicycles to their
owners, often because the owners
had failed to register them.

nificantly increases the chances of
successful recovery. "There are
many, many cases of stolen bikes
being recovered merely because
the owners took the time to regis
ter their bikes," Smith said. "We
just can't emphasize it enough.
Trust me, it's worth it."
Smith said the beginning of
the school year is the best time for
bike thieves since they know
there are many incoming stu
dents with brand-new bicycles.
"There have been cases of actual
vans and truckloads of bicycles
being carried off by crooks during
the first part of the school year,"
said Niemeyer.
"Everyone in the area knows
that Stanford has a lot of bikes.
Crooks prey on the new students'
gullibility and vulnerability."
Niemeyer said he does not
believe bike theft at Stanford is
an organized effort. "People just
steal them and sell them," he
said. "It's that simple to them."
A 1906 editorial in the Stan
ford Daily shows that bike theft is
nothing new on campus.
"It is apparent from the num
ber and frequency of the com
plaints to be heard that there is a
system of wholesale petty thiev
ery in operation about the cam
pus, the particular object of the
depredations in this case being
bicycles," the editorial said.

Students can never be too cautious in preventing bike theft, according
to Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer. He recommends a chain lock and a
few other basic guidelines to thwart bicycle thievery on campus.
