DIVERSITY, VARIETY,
CHALLENGE
"An unchollenging
8-to-5 job ? I
couldn't do that."
I came to
Woodward-Clyde to
work on a diversity
of water resource
projects - water quality,
hydrology, fisheries -
I haven't been
disappointed yet,
Diversity in a career,
at least to me, is crucial.

At Woodward-Clyde
you can find
variety, diversity,
challenge. More
importantly, they
encourage it; they
make it worth it. I
can't imagine working
any other way.
