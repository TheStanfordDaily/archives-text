# Fans' ire raised by costume
## 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
When junior Eric Selvik, drum
major with the Stanford Band,
dressed up like a flower, nobody
protested. When he donned a
Statue of Liberty costume, people
barely noticed. But dozens of
callers to Stanford organizations
yesterday apparently felt Selvik
had crossed the cross-dressing
line at Saturday's Notre Dame
football game — by parading
around as a nun.
At halftime, a woman in her
late 20s wearing an oversized
Notre Dame sweatshirt jumped
into the stadium and began pum
meling Selvik. As police pulled
her off, she told Selvik he'd <*o to
hell for his sacrilegious costume.
The physical assault was fol
lowed by a spate of angry phone
calls yesterday by spectators also
incensed by the outfit. Callers
targeted University President
Donald Kennedy's office, The
Daily, the Department of
Athletics, various campus reli
gious organizations and the Band
itself.
Selvik, who found the uniform
at the House of Humor in
Mountain View, claimed "it was
just a costume . . . not meant to
offend anyone." He said he was
shocked when the "callous
woman" assaulted him, an expe
rience he describes as "strange
and surreal."
He is equally surprised by the
slew of complaints about his
apparel yesterday. According to
Selvik, the Band gets hate mail
every week, and he did not fore
see that his costume would pro
voke more than a few angry let
ters.
However, Music Prof. Arthur
Barnes, the Band's adviser, said
he was "not surprised by the
reaction — considering who was
there." Notre Dame is a Catholic
University. Barnes pointed out
that during Saturday's pregame
show, Selvik was dressed as a
Hasidic Jew — with a large
Jewish star around his neck and
bearing a Menorah. "We try to
insult everybody equally," said
Barnes, echoing one of the Band's
general credos.
The Band said they received
no complaints about the rabbi
garb.
Band Manager Jesse Dorog
usker, a junior, insists the outfit
was not "meant to make a mock
ery of religion."
However, Athletic Director
Ted Leland said, "a lot of people
are deeply offended because it's a
caricature of a religious group.
"We must evaluate the activity
as it was perceived, not as it was
intended," he added.
On the question of whether
the Band had performed out of
line, Kennedy responded, "Yes.
People have deep religious feel
ings about religious matters and
the Band was insensitive to
them."
Kennedy suggested the event
was mostly a lapse in judgment
on the part of the Band. He said
that when people question him
about his views on the incident,
he might quote satirist Tom
Lehrer, who, characterizing his
own religious satire, commented,
'My muse is not fettered by such
inhibitions as taste.' "
Selvik says he is "very sorry
that people were offended." He
said the Band planned an official
statement of apology for early
today.
