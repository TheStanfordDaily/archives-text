# On the chopping block
## 
### 
While the march to the woodcutter won't get
underway until the mid-October announcement by
the University Cabinet, recommendations prepared
by the Faculty Senate Committee on Education and
Scholarship at Stanford, by its related task forces
and by the ASSU provide a preliminary idea of what
may be cut.

Acad em ic Depart^nen ts
Faculty have reached a fairly strong consensus m
that the University should cut entire schools or
departments, rather than make cuts across the '**•
board. "Something has to go," said History Prof.
George Fredrickson, a member of the faculty
committee. "If we cut everything the same
amount, everything will be mediocre."
How will the University decide which
departments to keep? The committee suggests
that the decision "should be based on evaluation
of excellence in scholarship."
. .

Administrative Services^
The faculty committee recommended that
administrative staff areas — which include
libraries, the Student Affairs Office and other *
University services — "should be examined m
carefully and reduced where appropriate." The
ASSU agreed.
But others say it's a mistake to underestimate
the size of the support structure necessary to keep
the University going. "I know this is the area
everyone wants to hit," said Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner, chair of the committee's task
force on administrative sen/ices. "But it's really too
easy to look at this and say, 'cut all those people.'" *

™ Financial Aid
The faculty committee "supports in the
strongest possible terms the University's
commitment to need-blind admissions.'' **
Still, officials concede that nothing is entirely
safe given the severity of the budget crisis. One **
likely change: students will be expected to pursue m.
non-University sources of support, such as
private scholarships and federal grants, more
aggressively.

Lecturers
The committee's task force on undergraduate
education suggests cutting the number of
lecturers, instead using "qualified and properly **
trained" graduate students for some of the
teaching currently done by lecturers. The report H
claims the change would also provide "a much- **
needed source of support for our graduate
programs" through teaching salaries and other
benefits.

™ Overseas Studies
The committee recommends that Overseas
Studies consider reducing the number of **
overseas centers, giving a higher priority to «*
"programs that are academically demanding" and
retaining "perhaps only four excellent centers." **
There are currently nine overseas studies **
centers.
The ASSU suggests modeling more centers *»
after the less-expensive Kyoto center.

~ Residential Education
The committee's task force on undergraduate
education reported that Res Ed programs "are an
appropriate target for cuts." **
Although the task force placed a priority on m
keeping academic computing and special
counseling services, It recommended: "We might,
for example, cut out resident fellows In small
upper-class dormitories while retaining them In
dormitories with substantial numbers of freshmen ***
and/or sophomores."
The ASSU suggests using dormitory funds to **
help replace cuts In residential education.
