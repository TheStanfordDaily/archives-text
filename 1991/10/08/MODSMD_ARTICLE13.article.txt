# Amidst controversy, confirmation vote today

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate struggled Monday with
allegations that Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas sexual
ly harassed an assistant a decade
ago. Senate leaders indicated they
would move ahead with a Tuesday
evening vote and the White House
decried an llth-hour "smear"
campaign.
A handful of senators called for
a delay in Thomas' confirmation
vote so that allegations by Anita
Hill, now a law professor at the
University of Oklahoma, could be
thoroughly investigated.
Hill called for a more thorough
investigation of her charges, say
ing: "The Senate should consider
the conduct" of Thomas.
"It seems to me a person
shouldn't have to violate the law in
order for his character to be called
into question," she told reporters
in Norman, Okla., where she is a
tenured professor. "I want to focus
on behavior," which she said
undermined his ability to enforce
the very laws he was sworn to
uphold.
The allegations, which surfaced
over the weekend, threw the Sen
ate into tumult on the eve of its
scheduled vote on Thomas. The
nominee stayed out of the public
eye as the accusations arose.
Minus a ninth justice, the

Supreme Court opened its fall
term.
In statements to the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the FBI,
Hill said Thomas made sexually
explicit remarks to her about
pornographic movies and his sexu
al interest in her. She said
Thomas' comments were made on
the job when she worked for him
at the Education Department and
later when he was chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. Senate supporters of
Thomas said he denied the allega
tions.
President Bush said the last
minute accusations against
Thomas concerned him "not the
least."
"He still has my full confidence,
obviously," Bush told reporters. "I
think he will be and should be con
firmed — quickly." The White
House attempted to discredit Hill
by providing names of EEOC
employees who vouched for
Thomas' character and by point
ing out discrepancies in the
chronology of her allegations.
Hill's allegations prompted
calls by Thomas' opponents to
postpone the vote to look closer at
the allegations.
"I think we owe Judge Thomas,
the U.S. Supreme Court and the
people of this nation a little more

thorough investigation than has
taken place up to this point," said
Sen. Paul Simon, D-111., who
opposes Thomas.
Several Democrats who had
announced support for Thomas
stuck by their decision Monday,
noting that the Judiciary Commit
tee had full knowledge of the alle
gations when it forwarded the
nomination to the full Senate —
with no recommendation.
As of late last week, Thomas
appeared assured of 54 votes, from
41 Republicans and 13 Democrats.
Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont
on Monday became the first
Republican to oppose Thomas.
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada was
the only Democratic supporter of
Thomas who said he would recon
sider his vote. Reid called the alle
gations "troubling in light of their
gravity."
Hill told reporters she was just
25 years old at the time, in her
first job, and assumed his offen
sive behavior would not resume.
Although Hill did not allege
that Thomas touched her, she told
the committee that he questioned
her about different types of sexual
activity and described various sex
ual acts. According to published
reports, he talked about porno
graphic films that showed group
sex and beastiality.
