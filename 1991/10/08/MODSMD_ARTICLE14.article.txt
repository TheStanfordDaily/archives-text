JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minis
ter Yitzhak Shamir questioned Arab
intentions and expressed uncertainty
Monday over whether a Mideast peace
conference would take place.
In a policy speech opening the win
ter session of the Knesset, or parlia
ment, Shamir said the peace confer
ence, originally planned for this month,
could lead to a "historic breakthrough .
. . a very significant milestone in the
history of the Middle East and the Jew
ish people."
But he said the fact that the peace
process needs U.S. and Soviet sponsor
ship "indicates that the leaders of
many Arab states have not yet whole-

heartedly accepted the existence of the
state of Israel."
Shamir also leveled some angry crit
icism of President Bush for delaying
loan guarantees Israel has requested to
cope with the influx of Soviet immi
grants.
The United States is still working on
a formula to bring the Palestinians and
Israelis together at the conference. Sec
retary of State James Baker said
Israel's priority was to determine
whether the Arabs have had a true
change of heart toward Israel —
whether they recognize Israel's exis
tence and are ready to live with Israel
in peace; whether they will stop har

boring terrorists; and whether they
will grant their Jewish minorities equal
rights and freedom to emigrate.
"Those who feel this way are com
pletely mistaken," he said. "The role of
the United States must be that of a fair
mediator, seeking ways to bring the
parties closer and to bridge the gaps
between them."
He listed these conditions for Israeli
participation:
• The peace conference must be a
one- or two-day ceremony followed by
direct negotiations between Israel and
each Arab neighbor. The conference
"will have no powers" and Israel won't
agree to it reconvening at any stage.

• The Palestinians should be part of
a Jordanian delegation. They must be
approved in advance by Israel, and
exclude the Palestine Liberation Orga
nization. If the Palestinian delegates
"announce at any stage that they were
appointed by or represent the PLO ter
rorist organization, Israel will not sit
with them."
• "We hope and assume" that the
Soviet Union will restore diplomatic
relations with Israel, as promised,
before taking its seat at the confer
ence.
• Jerusalem, including the Arab sec
tor captured by Israel in the 1967 war,
will remain united as Israel's capital.
