The University must
give students and
faculty budget info

THE FACULTY AND student
town meetings and forums
that have been held recently
in regards to budget cutting were
both positive moves forward in
getting important dialogue started
on campus. But the results of
these meetings have been mixed.
While the proposals set forth by
both the Faculty Senate Commit
tee on Education and Scholarship
at Stanford (SCESS) and the
ASSU committee widely differ,
they both provide general guide
lines of how the University should
go about increasing revenue and
decreasing expenditures. The town
meetings brought together senior
administrators, students and fac
ulty and provided the only forum
for people to voice their sugges
tions and concerns.
However, two dominant trends
emerged from these open forums.
First, the looming budget cuts
have spawned acute parochialism
throughout the campus. This pre
dominant "keep, keep" mentality
is in danger of engendering out
right competition between vying
factions within the University.
Suggestions abound of what the
University must absolutely not
axe, but there has been no realistic
assessment with specific monetary
targets of what can and must go.
The reasons for this would seem
to be the fault of the students and
faculty. Obviously, everyone has a
natural tendency to defend what is
closest to him or herself. It is all
too easy to point an accusing finger
elsewhere, claiming that other
areas can best endure the force of
the budget ax's blow.
While undoubtedly certain
areas can and will bear the brunt
of these cuts, neither committee
was able to offer precise financial
details or even ballpark estimates.

The guidelines remained general
at best and too vague for cuts
which will be decided upon within
the next few weeks.
A major factor in the committees'
inability to come up with concrete
and feasible cut recommendations is
simply a lack of information. The
University has withheld critical
budget details; no hard data regard
ing individual departmental expen
ditures or revenues is available to
concerned students or faculty.
Individual, administrative-unit
budget reports are not available to
anyone who is not a dean or vice
president. This makes it impossi
ble for a student committee of any
kind to formulate coherent sugges
tions for the budget cuts.
Legitimate concerns exist
regarding the right to privacy and
a fear of engendering annual inter
departmental feuding.
However, this is no excuse for
the University's refusal to release
such figures.
When over $40 million will be
cut from the operational budget
without students or faculty ever
seeing specifics about where and
how their money is spent, some
thing is very skewed. Given
today's fiscal realities, this policy
is indefensible.
As a result, the impact of the
guidelines set forth by both the
SCESS and the ASSU will most like
ly be muted. The best they can do is
offer a sense of the general targets set
by both the faculty and the students.
Little time remains before the
Oct. 17 deadline. In this time, if
the student body and faculty can
not obtain precise information
about the budget monies for each
department, there will be little
that can be done in the way of con
crete suggestions.
For the administration to give
students and faculty a chance to be
truly helpful in the process of bud
get cutting, this information is nec
essary. If it is not made available,
then the administration cannot
place blame for unpopular deci
sions on the students' and faculty's
shoulders when cuts are made.
