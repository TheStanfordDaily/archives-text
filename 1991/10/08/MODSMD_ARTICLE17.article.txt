Zapata residents say coverage of incident was unfair

The daily has treated the
coverage of the alleged rape in Casa
Zapata as a priority with deserved
importance. We, the residents of Zapata,
feel we must respond, however, to the
unethical and irresponsible journalism
displayed in Thursday's edition. Our
emotions ranged from shock, disgust and
anger to confusion at how such an article
could be printed.
From the initial reports of the alleged
rape in Zapata, the series of articles in The
Daily has sensationalized a tragic incident.
Distortion, misquotation and misinforma
tion have replaced responsible journalism.
Tony Burciaga, Chris Arriola and Angela
Rickford have all been misquoted.
The details of the alleged assault in
Thursday's article were painful, cruel
and completely unnecessary. Above all,

they strike against the core of the Funda
mental Standard of Stanford University:
respect for all members of the University
community.
We are angered that the heroism of
the survivor's actions has been ignored
throughout the reporting of the past
week. A rape survivor who has the
courage to report the crime endures
tremendous pain and suffering created
not only by the assault itself, but also by
a legal system that necessitates repeti
tion of the events.
This anguish is intensified by insensi
tive press coverage. Perhaps the only
glimmer of hope in the ordeal is that
other rape survivors may feel empowered
by an example of bravery and come for
ward to receive the help they need. We
believe that your article has discouraged

many survivors from coming forward,
out of fear of having their struggle simi
larly exploited by the press.
We are also at odds with the details
presented about Mr. Thomas' personal
life. Why was the alleged rape, which
should have been the focus of the article,
placed after his list of accomplishments?
We must also comment on how the
reporter went about getting information.
Reading the police report is fair, though
what the reporter chose to include from it
was tactless and insensitive. However, it
is neither fair nor reliable to question res
idents of dorms other than Zapata.
It is absolutely unacceptable to call
Zapata residents and attempt to elicit
specific responses through insensitive,
leading questioning. The Daily used these
tactics, acting reprehensibly, both in its

research activities and in its writing of
the article.
All of this raises the question of how The
Daily operates. How could such an article be
printed? Who is responsible for the anguish
that this must have caused the survivor?
We are not asking for a retraction. The
damage has been done. Nor are we asking
for censorship. We are, however, calling
for concrete steps with which The Daily
can guarantee accuracy in their report
ing. Most importantly, we are calling for
greater responsibility in the treatment of
issues that deal with more than mere
facts, but with people.
