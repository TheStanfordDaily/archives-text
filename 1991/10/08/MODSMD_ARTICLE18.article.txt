# Kennedy: Protest was discussed with Wilson before convocation
## 
### 
In his viewpoint column on Oct. 5,
David Bradfute charged that Gov. Pete
Wilson deliberately provoked "gay rage" by
deciding to go ahead with his Centennial
Convocation speech at Stanford. The heart
of his argument is in these two sentences:
"Wilson and his staff knew in advance that
his presence at Stanford would ruin the
convocation and possibly result in physical
injury and property damage. Wilson decid
ed to attend as planned."
In fact, there was full consultation
between Wilson and Stanford. Members
of Wilson's staff contacted us early in the
morning on the day of the convocation,
and there were thorough discussions
about security needs. We also held con
versations with Wilson himself. It was
made plain that the decision would be
reached jointly.

It was Stanford's recommendation
that we proceed with Wilson's appear
ance. We made this recommendation
knowing that there was some risk; but we
saw a greater risk in permitting freedom
of speech to give way to threat and intim
idation. Although the situation was an
ugly one, I think the decision was correct.
Disagree if you want, but don't blame the
victim.
