# Column doesn't give true sense of Jewish family relations
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Daniel
Rosen's column of Oct. 3.1, too, attended
High Holy day services the same night as
Rosen and heard the comments of the
speaker. One may disagree with what
was said, but I am wondering why

Rosen's comments were found on the
opinions page of The Daily.
In a family, when "Uncle Yaacov"
unintentionally hurts you, you go to
Uncle Yaacov and talk to him about it
first, before spreading it around the
neighborhood. If Rosen considers this to
be a family affair it would have been bet
ter for Rosen to have approached Hillel
personally to "clear the air."
I am sorry Rosen felt the need to bol
ster himself with two glasses of wine
before he came to see his family. Family
relationships are complex, and when you
don't see relatives very often you don't
know them very well and may not know
"where they are coming from."
Family members can disagree with
each other without slandering each other
publicly by using words like "crazy rela
tive." I don't know why Rosen feels so
uncomfortable with his family. But in the
spirit of Yom Kippur I hope that they rec
oncile and that he comes to visit more
often.
