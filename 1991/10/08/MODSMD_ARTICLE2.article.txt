# A
						'sweet' idea
## Her candy invention is spooning up cash

Her story is a confectionary fairy tale.
At age 14, Alisa Ahlstone was stirring choco
late at a bakery in her hometown of Ventura,
Calif. She set the spoon aside and the chocolate
on it hardened. When Ahlstone sampled the
spoon she thought, "Ooh, this is cool."
In fact, the idea would prove to be hot. Since
that day six years ago, Ahlstone, now a junior, has
been filling plastic spoons with chocolate and
scooping up part of the $10 billion U.S. candy
market.
Ahlstone admits her chocolate spoons were
part luck, part "Copernican revelation." She even
thought the idea a tad spoony, at first.
But others viewed 1% ounces of milk chocolate
on the tip of a plastic spoon, for stirring in coffee
or hot chocolate, as a sweet proposition.
Ahlstone's parents were even prepared to provide
$10,000 in seed money.
Ahlstone, for her part, wanted to put off her
baptism in business until later in life. "But my
parents said I didn't have to wait until I grew up,"
she recalled. So Ahlstone got busy.
She dubbed her confection "Dip n Sip" and
contracted a local candy-maker to mold the choco
late around the mouth of plastic spoons. By using
the candy-maker she bypassed tangles of red tape,
health regulations and other legal hurdles she
would have faced on her own. Ahlstone's home
based company, with the same name as the
spoons, packages the spoons and handles orders.
Marketing was no problem for Ahlstone's
upstart company. She knew just whom to target:
"Anyone who likes chocolate."
She began pitching her wares to local gift
shops and candy stores in Southern California,
and the first eight stores she visited found the
spoons, in good taste.
When the 14-year-old capitalist wasn't selling,
she was chauffeured — by her parents — to meet
ings with lawyers and business executives.
Success at such a young age would have satisfied
any teen tycoon.
