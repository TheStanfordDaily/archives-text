# A 						'sweet' idea
## Her candy invention is spooning up cash 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Her story is a confectionary fairy tale.
At age 14, Alisa Ahlstone was stirring choco
late at a bakery in her hometown of Ventura,
Calif. She set the spoon aside and the chocolate
on it hardened. When Ahlstone sampled the
spoon she thought, "Ooh, this is cool."
In fact, the idea would prove to be hot. Since
that day six years ago, Ahlstone, now a junior, has
been filling plastic spoons with chocolate and
scooping up part of the $10 billion U.S. candy
market.
Ahlstone admits her chocolate spoons were
part luck, part "Copernican revelation." She even
thought the idea a tad spoony, at first.
But others viewed 1% ounces of milk chocolate
on the tip of a plastic spoon, for stirring in coffee
or hot chocolate, as a sweet proposition.
Ahlstone's parents were even prepared to provide
$10,000 in seed money.
Ahlstone, for her part, wanted to put off her
baptism in business until later in life. "But my
parents said I didn't have to wait until I grew up,"
she recalled. So Ahlstone got busy.
She dubbed her confection "Dip n Sip" and
contracted a local candy-maker to mold the choco
late around the mouth of plastic spoons. By using
the candy-maker she bypassed tangles of red tape,
health regulations and other legal hurdles she
would have faced on her own. Ahlstone's home
based company, with the same name as the
spoons, packages the spoons and handles orders.
Marketing was no problem for Ahlstone's
upstart company. She knew just whom to target:
"Anyone who likes chocolate."
She began pitching her wares to local gift
shops and candy stores in Southern California,
and the first eight stores she visited found the
spoons, in good taste.
When the 14-year-old capitalist wasn't selling,
she was chauffeured — by her parents — to meet
ings with lawyers and business executives.
Success at such a young age would have satisfied
any teen tycoon.

Ahlstone garnered her 15 min
utes of fame — and more. Her
story received coverage in her
hometown press. An invitation to
appear on television's Home show
with Gary Collins in Los Angeles
soon followed. "I got to meet
Marilyn McCoo (of Solid Gold
fame) on the show," she cheerful
ly recalled from her room in
Columbae.
Inquiries about the candy
came from as far away as
Australia and Canada. Japanese
executives have shown up at her
front door expressing interest in
the company. She has even
received offers to buy the compa
ny, and copycats have since
mushroomed. "There have been
imitations," she said. "But I'm
told that's the best compliment."
A bigger compliment, though,
was paid by Bloomingdale's, the
posh international department
store chain. Company buyers
heard of Dip n Sip and flew
Ahlstone to New York to meet
with store buyers. The spoons,
displayed in Bloomingdale's 1990
Holiday catalog, became the third
biggest seller of food products in
the catalog that season.
"The concept, you could say,
was very unique and it was tasty,"
said Eleanor Kassman, director of
special projects for Bloom
ingdale's food division in New
York. "We thought our customers
would enjoy it." They did, but
Ahlstone said Bloomingdale's,
whose parent company Federated
Department Stores Inc. declared
bankruptcy last year, still owes
her more than $4,000 for out
standing orders.
On the brighter side,
Ahlstone's confection is now sold
in nearly 125 department stores
and gift shops nationwide. Two
years ago the Stanford Bookstore
carried the chocolate-filled uten
sil.
"We sell quite a few of the
spoons. It's pretty popular," said
Tim Johnson of the Chocolate
Gallery, a candy store near Santa

Barbara. "People come in and say
this is the candy the little girl
invented."
But the little girl has grown
up, even if people still identify
Ahlstone, now 20, with the
spoons. On a recent visit to New
York, Ahlstone and a Stanford
roommate stopped by
Bloomingdale's to meet with her
buyers. Both wore T-shirts and
jeans. Ahlstone's friend sported a
Harley-Davidson cap.
The Bloomingdale secretaries
were a little condescending at
first, Ahlstone said. But when she
told them she was the "girl with
the spoons," they bubbled with
excitement and could not stop
talking.
If people on campus haven't
been talking about Ahlstone's
treat, it may be because they have
chocolate spoons in their mouths.
During her freshman year in
Larkin, two years ago, she
brought spoons that were unfit
for sale to her dormmates. On
occasion she takes the spoons to
Coffee House study sessions with
friends. "It's good with cocoa and
coffee," Ahlstone says, "although
a lot of people just eat them."
The spoons come in many fla
vors, including milk chocolate,
amaretto and Irish cream. There
is even chocolate with marshmal
lows — for the younger set, she
says. During holidays, spoons are
made to order: foil with red hearts
for Valentine's Day and pastel
colored wrappings for Easter.
While the spoons have certain
ly netted her fame, Ahlstone
won't discuss her fortune. Says a
friend sitting in Ahlstone's room,
"Alisa can't take care of
Stanford's budget problem, but
that yacht thing — no problem."
The undeclared junior plans to
continue the business in the
future, but she says she has no
plans to dip into chocolate knives
or forks just yet.
Ahlstone says Dip n Sip has
been a practical adventure in cap
italism, far better than anything
she could have learned in an eco
nomics class, and she'll tell you
she's made the grade.
"It's been fun," she said. "I'd
have to give myself an A."

Marketing was no problem for Ahlstone's

she was chauffeured — by her parents — to meet

Allsa Ahlstone displays some of her increasingly famous chocolate spoons.
Ahlstone garnered her 15 min
utes of fame — and more. Her
story received coverage in her
hometown press. An invitation to
appear on television's Home show
with Gary Collins in Los Angeles
soon followed. "I got to meet
Marilyn McCoo (of Solid Gold
fame) on the show," she cheerful
ly recalled from her room in
Columbae.
Inquiries about the candy
came from as far away as
Australia and Canada. Japanese
executives have shown up at her
front door expressing interest in
the company. She has even
received offers to buy the compa
ny, and copycats have since
mushroomed. "There have been
imitations," she said. "But I'm
told that's the best compliment."
A bigger compliment, though,
was paid by Bloomingdale's, the
posh international department
store chain. Company buyers
heard of Dip n Sip and flew
Ahlstone to New York to meet
with store buyers. The spoons,
displayed in Bloomingdale's 1990
Holiday catalog, became the third
biggest seller of food products in
the catalog that season.
"The concept, you could say,
was very unique and it was tasty,"
said Eleanor Kassman, director of
special projects for Bloom
ingdale's food division in New
York. "We thought our customers
would enjoy it." They did, but
Ahlstone said Bloomingdale's,
whose parent company Federated
Department Stores Inc. declared
bankruptcy last year, still owes
her more than $4,000 for out
standing orders.
On the brighter side,
Ahlstone's confection is now sold
in nearly 125 department stores
and gift shops nationwide. Two
years ago the Stanford Bookstore
carried the chocolate-filled uten
sil.
"We sell quite a few of the
spoons. It's pretty popular," said
Tim Johnson of the Chocolate
Gallery, a candy store near Santa

Barbara. "People come in and say
this is the candy the little girl
invented."
But the little girl has grown
up, even if people still identify
Ahlstone, now 20, with the
spoons. On a recent visit to New
York, Ahlstone and a Stanford
roommate stopped by
Bloomingdale's to meet with her
buyers. Both wore T-shirts and
jeans. Ahlstone's friend sported a
Harley-Davidson cap.
The Bloomingdale secretaries
were a little condescending at
first, Ahlstone said. But when she
told them she was the "girl with
the spoons," they bubbled with
excitement and could not stop
talking.
If people on campus haven't
been talking about Ahlstone's
treat, it may be because they have
chocolate spoons in their mouths.
During her freshman year in
Larkin, two years ago, she
brought spoons that were unfit
for sale to her dormmates. On
occasion she takes the spoons to
Coffee House study sessions with
friends. "It's good with cocoa and
coffee," Ahlstone says, "although
a lot of people just eat them."
The spoons come in many fla
vors, including milk chocolate,
amaretto and Irish cream. There
is even chocolate with marshmal
lows — for the younger set, she
says. During holidays, spoons are
made to order: foil with red hearts
for Valentine's Day and pastel
colored wrappings for Easter.
While the spoons have certain
ly netted her fame, Ahlstone
won't discuss her fortune. Says a
friend sitting in Ahlstone's room,
"Alisa can't take care of
Stanford's budget problem, but
that yacht thing — no problem."
The undeclared junior plans to
continue the business in the
future, but she says she has no
plans to dip into chocolate knives
or forks just yet.
Ahlstone says Dip n Sip has
been a practical adventure in cap
italism, far better than anything
she could have learned in an eco
nomics class, and she'll tell you
she's made the grade.
"It's been fun," she said. "I'd
have to give myself an A."
Her story is a confectionary fairy tale.
At age 14, Alisa Ahlstone was stirring choco
late at a bakery in her hometown of Ventura,
Calif. She set the spoon aside and the chocolate
on it hardened. When Ahlstone sampled the
spoon she thought, "Ooh, this is cool."
In fact, the idea would prove to be hot. Since
that day six years ago, Ahlstone, now a junior, has
been filling plastic spoons with chocolate and
scooping up part of the $10 billion U.S. candy
market.
Ahlstone admits her chocolate spoons were
part luck, part "Copernican revelation." She even
thought the idea a tad spoony, at first.
But others viewed 1% ounces of milk chocolate
on the tip of a plastic spoon, for stirring in coffee
or hot chocolate, as a sweet proposition.
Ahlstone's parents were even prepared to provide
$10,000 in seed money.
Ahlstone, for her part, wanted to put off her
baptism in business until later in life. "But my
parents said I didn't have to wait until I grew up,"
she recalled. So Ahlstone got busy.
She dubbed her confection "Dip n Sip" and
contracted a local candy-maker to mold the choco
late around the mouth of plastic spoons. By using
the candy-maker she bypassed tangles of red tape,
health regulations and other legal hurdles she
would have faced on her own. Ahlstone's home
based company, with the same name as the
spoons, packages the spoons and handles orders.
