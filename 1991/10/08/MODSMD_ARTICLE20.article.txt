# Nun offended more than Irish fans
## 
### 
Like most Stanford students, I enjoy
watching our band perform its zany rou
tines. The Band's irreverence helps
relieve the tension of life at Stanford. We
applaud the Band for its irreverence.
Irreverence, however, should also be sub
ject to bounds of civil behavior, especially at
a university such as ours. When the drum
mqjor of the band (who dressed as a nun for
Saturday's game) hoisted a cross in place of
his baton, I think it did more than upset the
visitors from Notre Dame. It insulted many
other people, myself included.
Dressing like a nun seems harmless
(at least by our band's standards). Toss
ing around an object of deep religious sig
nificance is certainly not. It's offensive. I
hope that the leadership of the Band is
more sensitive in the future.
