## Call me lucky 
### 
I WAS BORN THE SECOND SON of
upper-middle class, white, well-educat
ed parents. I know it's not that dramat
ic, but it's my history. Or at least part of it.
On first appearance, my childhood was
pretty good: My brother and I got the
new Atari machine when it came out, 1
had my own bicycle, that kind of stuff.
But my precious bubble started to burst
in high school.
First, I watched my grandfather, to
whom I was very close, die. Difficult on a
personal level, but not much in the way of
unique adversity. Then came the acci
dent which left my mother paralyzed,
and which eventually claimed her life.
That seemed to up the ante a bit.
Next it was me in the hospital, having
a brain tumor removed the summer
before I came to the Farm. Hence, the
crew cut when I arrived.
So the fact that I am right now waiting
to find out whether or not the growths in
my leg and arm bones are malignant is
not that huge a surprise.
Not to mention that last year I lived in
Manzanita. Call me lucky.
But maybe I am.
I could have had it a lot worse. My brain
tumor could have been malignant, or my
family might have lacked the resources to
care for me when I was ill. But, in the end,
I made it to the one and only Stanford
University. So maybe life isn't so bad.
All of these events have been difficult

for me. Whether you think they would
have been tough for you is a different
issue. For me, they were. And each of us
has his own experiences that are difficult
in uniquely personal ways.
The point is that everyone goes through
hard times, and since each of us is different
(something this campus seems to relish),
our adversities are unique as well. Just
because someone hasn't experienced the
things that have been hard for you doesn't
mean that person has always had it easy.
Because of our own unique adversity,
we are all forced to realize how much we
appreciate who we are and what we have.
Unfortunately, this often doesn't occur
until we are about to lose something
important to us.
I realized what I appreciated when I
watched my grandpa die, held my mom's
hand as she took her last breath, gritted
my teeth as they wheeled me into the
operating room and looked at the X-rays of
my legs and arms. 1 have no idea whether
this kind of stuff hits close to home for
you. Maybe not — but then that's what
you are lucky about, if you ask me.
Although others haven't faced exactly
the same adversities you have, they surely
have faced their own. And maybe, if
instead of always trying to compare our
past to other peoples' and see whose has
been more difficult, we should try to
explain our experiences to each other on a
human level. We might be able to see some

commonalties in our different situations.
I'm not trying to minimize anybody's
history or hardship. I am trying to point
out that there are a lot of things that can
cause adversity in someone's life. I'm
sure there are a lot of students on this
campus whose parents are alcoholic, are
neglectful or are physically or sexually
abusive to their children. These and
many other experiences can be devastat
ing for the entirety of a person's life. But
we hear little of this type of disadvantage.
It seems to me that we would all bene
fit if — the next time we are tempted to
minimize another person's situation
(especially those people with whom we
disagree) — we instead try to understand
where their opinions are coming from
and what unique experiences have
shaped their perceptions, rather than
automatically shutting them out and
labeling them this or that.
We might realize that we all have
something to be thankful for, and maybe
even that we have something in common.
So why not open our ears before opening
our mouths?

Joel Wagonfeld sends his condolences to
those who live in Manzanita.
