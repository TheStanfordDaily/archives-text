## Booters aim for Huskies 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
1990: Stanford entered its game against the Uni
versity of Washington on a hot streak, sporting a
respectable 7-4-5 record and on the verge of receiving
an NCAA Tournament bid.
The result: the Cardinal lost 3-1, extinguishing any
playoff hopes and ending the season at 9-6-6.
1991: Stanford comes into today's game against the
Huskies (3:00 at Maloney Field) with an even more
respectable 6-2-3 mark, losing only one of its last eight
games, and on the threshold of receiving an NCAA
Tournament bid.
Will history repeat itself today? Not if Stanford
coach Colin Lindores can help it. "This is a game that
is crucial to us," Lindores said. "If we are to demon
strate that we are a playoff team, we have to beat
them."
"Revenge is definitely a factor," Rhett Harty said.
"Basically, last year's game summed up our season.
We knew that if we lost it, we'd end our season, which
is what happened."
Midfielder Randy Mann agreed. "[Washington]
beat us in a big game last year, so revenge has to play
a part out there," said the junior. "If we play as well as
we did against Fresno, I think we can beat them."
Mann was referring to last Wednesday's 1-1 tie of No.
7-ranked Fresno State, a game which the Cardinal
clearly dominated, enjoying a 14-5 shots-on-goal
advantage.
The Fresno game, however, provides a perfect
example of a problem that has plagued Stanford all
season — an inability to capitalize on goal-scoring
opportunities. Lindores stressed that this must
change in the second half of the season. "We've played

well since the Portland debacle (a 4-1 loss to the
Pilots on Sept. 22). But we've got to be sharper
around the goal on offense."
Harty concurred with his coach. "We haven't been
finishing the chances we've had lately. Anyone who's
seen us play the last three or four games would see
that we haven't been getting it done around the goal."
Against a tough opponent like Washington, capi
talizing on opportunities will be more important than
ever. The Huskies play a physical style of soccer
against which, Harty said, "we might only get two or
three scoring chances."
Washington has been bouncing in and out of the
national top 20 the entire season, falling out of the
rankings this past weekend after consecutive losses on
their California road trip. Needless to say, they too will
be motivated for today's game. "We know that they're
going to be a tough opponent since they lost two in a
row," Lindores said. "When I saw the practicing [Mon
day], they didn't look like a very happy soccer team."
While a win against the Huskies would by no
means guarantee Stanford an NCAA bid, it would
greatly enhance the team's reputation, and provide a
positive start for the second half of the season. "A win
today would get us closer to being among the top
three teams in the West, which is where we have to be
for the NCAA's," Mann said.
