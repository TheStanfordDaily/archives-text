# Stanford faces Pacific in battle of undefeated
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Right now there are only three unde
feated teams left in collegiate women's vol
leyball. After tonight, there will only be
two.
That's because two of the unbeatens,
the No. 1-ranked Stanford Cardinal and
the No. 2 University of the Pacific Tigers,
square off tonight in Stockton at 7:30 in
what will assuredly be one of the best vol
leyball matches of the season.
"UOP beat Long Beach State at Long
Beach last weekend, and I think UOP is
playing as well as anyone in the country
right now," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said.
Long Beach State was No. 2 in last
week's poll, a spot that Pacific will take
over officially when the new polls come out
later today.
The Lady Tigers are one of volleyball's
traditional powerhouses, and they are
notoriously difficult to beat at Spanos
Gym in Stockton.
"They're big and strong. They're a real
good blocking team, and one of their
strengths is that they're pretty balanced.
It's real tough to play at UOP," Shaw said.
Last year, the Cardinal lost to Pacific at
Burnham Pavilion in four games, but then
turned around and avenged that loss by
defeating the Tigers in Stockton. In that
match Stanford showed its resolve, losing
the first two games but coming back to win
the last three to hand Pacific a rare home
defeat.
"The crowd that went up to Pacific real
ly helped us out [last year]," Shaw said.
This year the Cardinal hopes to have
similar crowd support again as they aim
to improve their play after two lackluster
outings last weekend at the Stanford Invi
tational.
"I think right now we need to keep mov
ing ahead. This will show us how we rank

'We're trying to work on
maintaining our focus the
whole game. Against tough
teams, we're going to have
to keep that intensity up
for three hour'

up against a top team," Shaw said.
Stanford is concentrating on itself
instead of worrying about individual oppo
nents, however.
"We have to learn to be consistent.
We're trying to work on maintaining our
focus the whole game. Against tough
teams, we're going to have to keep that
intensity up for three hours," Kristin
Klein said last week.
The Cardinal will be looking to get out
of its miniature hitting slump when they
play the Tigers. In the last two matches,
Stanford has hit an un-Cardinal .181,
compared to its impressive .288 for the
rest of the season.
The match will be broadcast live on
KZSU Stanford radio (FM 90.1) with Rick
Seidel doing the play-by-play and Chris
Crader doing color commentary.
