Watching the women's golf
team obtain a seventh-place finish
this weekend at the Lady Sun
Devil Tournament, Stanford
coach Tim Baldwin was "overly
pleased with our performance."
Competing against the top 15
teams in the nation, without the
Cardinal's No. 1 player Adele
Moore, and in only their first
tournament of the year, Stanford
showed great promise for the
coming year.
Surprising everyone in the
field, including herself, sopho
more Melinda Daniels led the
Cardinal, finishing in a four-way
tie for 12th overall. Daniels, who
averaged 88 strokes last year,
played three quality rounds of 77,
75, and 74. "Melinda Daniels is
easily the most improved golfer in
the country," according to Bald
win, who was "amazed" by
Daniels' performance.
Daniels, coming off a self
described "rough first year," is
now "excited about the upcoming
year because I started out with
the confidence I lacked last year."
Senior Audrey Wooding fin
ished 27th for the Cardinal.
Martha Richards was close
behind in 29th place. Stephanie
Davis was the fourth Stanford
golfer, finishing 40th with a 78,
an 80 and a 78.

Playing for their first time on
the ASU course, Jamille Jose and
Amy Lawrence finished 55th and
62nd respectively, both lowering
their scores significantly on the
last day.
Baldwin was extremely satis
fied with the Cardinal's finish,
and "was impressed with every
player on our team. . . Martha
Richards' improvement was
incredible," Baldwin said.
Richards and Daniels have "both
made mega-jumps" which will
undoubtedly help the team's play.
Arizona won the tournament
by a huge margin, with San Jose
State and Georgia coming in sec
ond and third, respectively. USC
tied for fourth with Oklahoma
State, and will be a team that the
Cardinal hopes to beat in upcom
ing tournaments. The majority of
the other teams have each played
in two or three tournaments
already this season, while this
was Stanford's first competition
of the year.
This year's course played dif
ferently than in past years, as the
rough has been allowed to grow,
providing a challenge for the
golfers. The home of both the
Pac-10 and NCAA championships
this year, the Karsten Course will
be trickier this year.
The Cardinal will play next
week in Seattle in the Washington
Intercollegiate tournament.
