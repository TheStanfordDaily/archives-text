# Students — a few of them — grapple with budget
## Understanding budget issues doesn't come easy for profs 
### Steve McCarroll Staff writer Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The faculty hoping to make
themselves heard on the eve of
University-wide budget cuts have
faced a task almost as daunting
as the budget crisis itself: collect
ing and learning the volumes of
information associated with the
University's budgets, programs
and operating procedures.
"These aren't the kinds of
things that faculty know about,"
said Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, chair of the Faculty Senate
committee charged with articu
lating faculty priorities on the
budget."In fact, they aren't the
kinds of things we want to know
about. Most of us would much
rather be in our laboratories and
libraries."
Involving faculty in budget
decisions has been a priority for
Stanford administrators, in their
attempt to build a broad consen
sus among the faculty that will
help hold the University together
in a strained and anxious period.
But it has posed a challenge,
too. "Learning about these
things is very, very difficult,"
said committee deputy chair
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones. "It
has taken a lot of our time."
The difficulties were discussed
at last Thursday's faculty meet
ing when the committee's task
force on administrative services
made its report.
"Right now we have services
we don't want and want services
we don't have," said one profes
sor, emphasizing that faculty

need to guide administrative
budget cutting. But another par
ticipant argued that only staff
members fully comprehend the
support structure that is neces
sary to keep the University going.
Patricia Gumport, an assis
tant professor of education and
sociology who has studied budget
cutting at several public research
universities, said Stanford's pro

Who says students aren't
apathetic?
Only 50 showed up at last
night's student town meeting
to discuss the budget with
University President Donald
Kennedy.
"All you can do is create
opportunities," Kennedy said,
undeterred by the low student
turnout. "The questions were
thoughtful and there were
many strong points.
"It was time well spent for
me," he added.
But members of the ASSU
who organized the meeting
said they were "very disap
pointed" by the low turnout.
"I was surprised that more
students did not come out,"
said senior John Louie, a
member of the Council of
Presidents. "The questions we
have been getting in our office
have been thoughtful and
vital."
COP member John
Overdeck said he thinks the
budget process has scared
some students. "Some feel
daunted by the task," he said.
Others at the town meeting
also said the low student
turnout was distressing.
Senior Assoc. Dean of
Engineering Charles Kruger,
deputy chair of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning, said he
was disappointed that turnout
at last night's meeting was
about half that of last week's
town meeting on the budget.
"But there will be additional
opportunities for students to
come out, and I hope more
decide to attend the next meet
ing."

Brian Bedell — Daily
University President Donald Kennedy addresses listeners at a town meeting held last night on bud
get cuts. Student turnout was disappointingly low, several ASSU organizers said.

cess has been more inclusive of
faculty than budget cutting at
many other institutions.
Gumport said that at some
institutions, especially public uni
versities, faculty were hardly con
sulted. "Faculty weren't involved
at all in the budget-cutting pro
cess — and the deans only mini
mally," on one of the campuses
Gumport studied.
A major difference that
Gumport sees between Stanford
and other schools is the time
frame used for decision making.
"At Stanford there has been a lot
more lead time" for discussion
and planning, she said.
Medical School Dean David
Korn, whose school just complet
ed what Korn called "intensely
agonizing deliberations" on cut
ting its own budget, said one of
the most important lessons of the

cuts was the need for faculty sup
port.
To get that support, he said,
"You have to communicate an
understanding of what the com
mercial business of the organiza
tion is ... I've spent a lot of time
relaying financial information to
faculty."
Failure to understand the
University's commercial opera
tions results in dissent among the
faculty, said Korn, adding that it's
easy to see "something sinister" in
administrators' decisions if faculty
don't understand the constraints
that guide those decisions.
The acrimony, however, can
also be directed against other fac
ulty. "The scarcity of resources
can create a condition that's ripe
for conflict" among faculty as they
compete for limited resources,
Gumport said.
Anthropology Prof. Clifford
Barnett said he worries that aca
demic provincialism will take
hold.
"People are looking to protect

their own small piece of turf,"
said Barnett, who added that he
fears a "Balkanization" of the
University. "They really need to
raise their eyes up and look at the
larger picture."
Others say it is too early to pre
dict the level of division among
the faculty. The answer may
depend on the severity of the bud
get-cutting targets for academic
schools, to be announced by the
University Cabinet the week of
Oct. 21.
In the meantime, Provost
James Rosse and the University
Cabinet face the challenge of inte
grating the faculty recommenda
tions into their decisions about
budget-cutting priorities and tar
gets for schools and administra
tive units.
"Clearly these recommenda
tions represent a point of view
that needs to be considered," said
Rosse. "I don't regard them as
decisive. They need to be balanced
with the priorities of the institu
tion."

Patricia Jones were the other fea
tured speakers at the meeting.
Jones is the deputy chair of the
Faculty Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford.
David Bradfute, who is the
graduate student representative
on the cabinet budget committee,
said he, too, was disappointed by
the lack of student response when
people "so knowledgeable of the
budget process" were speaking.
"I wish there had been more
students in attendance and a
longer period of time for those
who were here to ask questions,"
Bradfute said. "It is too bad there
isn't more interaction."
For those students who did
attend, Jones, Kennedy and
Kruger provided a brief explana
tion of the budget process before
opening the floor to questions.
A common theme among
speakers was the many problems
of graduate students during the
time of budget cuts.
"We are concerned about our
small salaries," said one graduate
student in electrical engineering.

"We do not make enough to afford
a financial cut."
Kruger said everyone involved
in the budget process is "well
aware" of the financial problems
facing graduate students.
"I have not heard anybody sug
gest that the way out of this prob
lem is to reduce graduate stipends,"
he said.
Bradfute said it was "nice to
hear more graduate concerns" at
the meeting, which was something
that was "not really discussed" at
last week's town meeting.
In response to controversy sur
rounding the faculty senate com
mittee's position on creative arts,
both Jones and Kennedy clarified
earlier recommendations.
"Excellence shouldn't only be
pursued in pure academics," Jones
said. "The spirit and the heart ...
should also be considered."
Kennedy said he did "not think
the faculty committee leaves any
doubt that the creative disciplines
. . . are important for Stanford to
be excellent."
During his brief speech at the
beginning of the meeting,
Kennedy emphasized that the
budget process will just be begin
ning when the October budget
targets are announced.
"The important stuff that is

going to happen in this process is
going to happen after the October
targets are announced," he said.
"There is no train leaving the sta
tion never to return."
After about an hour, the speak
ers left and students discussed
the ASSU recommendations on
the budget process. Members of
the COP and ASSU Senate
answered questions and consid
ered proposed changes.
Among cuts suggested by stu
dents were decreasing the admin
istration at overseas campuses
and possibly making them into
joint ventures with other schools.
Others supported increasing the
payout income from the endow
ment to increase revenue.
A final version of the ASSU
budget recommendations will be
passed at tonight's senate meet
ing after further student debate.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson, who observed last
night's meeting, said the ASSU
priorities are an important addi
tion to the budget process.
"The student opinion can be
expressed by using established
student bodies like the ASSU,"
Jackson said. "I hope that the stu
dent leaders will be in contact
with their constituencies and vice
versa."
