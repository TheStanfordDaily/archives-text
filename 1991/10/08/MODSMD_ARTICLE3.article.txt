# Students — a few of them — grapple with budget
## Understanding budget issues doesn't come easy for profs 
### Steve McCarroll Staff writer Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The faculty hoping to make
themselves heard on the eve of
University-wide budget cuts have
faced a task almost as daunting
as the budget crisis itself: collect
ing and learning the volumes of
information associated with the
University's budgets, programs
and operating procedures.
"These aren't the kinds of
things that faculty know about,"
said Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, chair of the Faculty Senate
committee charged with articu
lating faculty priorities on the
budget."In fact, they aren't the
kinds of things we want to know
about. Most of us would much
rather be in our laboratories and
libraries."
Involving faculty in budget
decisions has been a priority for
Stanford administrators, in their
attempt to build a broad consen
sus among the faculty that will
help hold the University together
in a strained and anxious period.
But it has posed a challenge,
too. "Learning about these
things is very, very difficult,"
said committee deputy chair
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones. "It
has taken a lot of our time."
The difficulties were discussed
at last Thursday's faculty meet
ing when the committee's task
force on administrative services
made its report.
"Right now we have services
we don't want and want services
we don't have," said one profes
sor, emphasizing that faculty

need to guide administrative
budget cutting. But another par
ticipant argued that only staff
members fully comprehend the
support structure that is neces
sary to keep the University going.

tant professor of education and
sociology who has studied budget
cutting at several public research
universities, said Stanford's pro

Who says students aren't
apathetic?
Only 50 showed up at last
night's student town meeting
to discuss the budget with
University President Donald
Kennedy.
"All you can do is create
opportunities," Kennedy said,
undeterred by the low student
turnout. "The questions were
thoughtful and there were
many strong points.
"It was time well spent for
me," he added.
But members of the ASSU
who organized the meeting
said they were "very disap
pointed" by the low turnout.
"I was surprised that more
students did not come out,"
said senior John Louie, a
member of the Council of
Presidents. "The questions we
have been getting in our office
have been thoughtful and
vital."
COP member John
Overdeck said he thinks the
budget process has scared
some students. "Some feel
daunted by the task," he said.
Others at the town meeting
also said the low student
turnout was distressing.
Senior Assoc. Dean of
Engineering Charles Kruger,
deputy chair of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning, said he
was disappointed that turnout
at last night's meeting was
about half that of last week's
town meeting on the budget.
"But there will be additional
opportunities for students to
come out, and I hope more
decide to attend the next meet
ing."
