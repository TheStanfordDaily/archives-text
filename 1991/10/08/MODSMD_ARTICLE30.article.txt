# Cyclists gear up
## 
### Sacha Henchman 
You're in line at the post office, around 3:30 on a
weekday afternoon. You notice an odd-looking group
starting to gather behind you. Who are these people?
They all sport tight spandex; the men have clean
shaven legs. They are organizing. Hmmm ... Nope,
you think to yourself, that protest was last week. Who
could they be?
Smack! You hit yourself in the forehead. Of course!
How could you have had such an un-PC thought?
They're all riding fancy bicycles — it's the cycling
team out for a training ride!
Back from their brilliant fourth-place finish at Col
legiate Road Nationals last May, the Stanford Cycling
Team is getting things rolling again this fall with club
rides open to anyone with two wheels and a helmet.
"The first month or so of the season," explained co
captain Baird Webel, "especially since we don't race
until February, is really geared towards new riders.
Teaching people to ride smoothly and predictably in a
group is our main concern right now."
Webel added that teaching new cyclists not to
panic in dangerous situations is also key. These dan
gers include sudden flat tires, debris in the road, or
'crossing wheels,' a cyclist's term for bumping the tire
in front of you when trying to stay in that rider's slip
stream.
The clubs late fall and winter training also focuses
on preparing for the intercollegiate bicycle racing cir
cuit. Sponsored by the Wheelsmith bicycle shop of
Palo Alto, the team has never finished out of the top
five nationally.
"Our early season training involves a lot of LSD,"
said co-captain Becky Wigglesworth with a grin.
"That's Long Slow Distance—rides which build your
endurance and aerobic threshold. This forms a good
base for the more intense sprint and interval work
outs we do closer to racing time."
Wigglesworth is quick to emphasize, however, that
those who have never raced before should not be
daunted.
Even collegiate teams as successful as Stanford
still offer entry-level categories for beginning racers
— female and male, undergrads and graduate stu
dents as well. In fact, most of Stanford Cycling's top
riders got their start right here on the Farm.
Sound like fun? Want to get off campus into the
fresh air beyond the foothills? Or just want to get to
class a little faster? Fall rides leave the post office in
White Plaza at 3:30 p.m. on weekdays and 9:00 a.m.
on weekends. The club's first meeting is tomorrow at
9 p.m. in Oak Lounge, Tresidder Union.
