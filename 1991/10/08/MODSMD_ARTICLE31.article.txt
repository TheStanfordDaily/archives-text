# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Although much attention was focused on
the football game this weekend, two non
gridiron stars turned in eye-popping perfor
mances.
Maybe only Notre Dame has the luck o'
the Irish, but water polo's Wolf Wigo and
soccer's Heather Mclntyre used their
considerable skills to lead their teams to
victory, and earn Athlete of the Week hon
ors.

Wigo, a freshman driver from New York
City, scored four goals in Stanford's 10-4
win over UC-Davis. In a game against Pacif
ic earlier this year he tallied four to lead the
Cardinal to a 10-8 victory.
In seven contests Wigo has scored more
than once and has gone scoreless in only
three games this year. He leads the No. 7-
ranked Cardinal in scoring with 22 goals on
the season.
The 6-2, 180-pounder was Ail-American
three years in a row at the Bronx High
School of Science and has played for the
prestigious New York Athletic Club. He is
currently a member of the U.S. Junior
National Team.

While Wigo is a prolific scorer, sweeper
Heather Mclntyre of the women's soccer
team is not. But that's just fine — because
when she does score — it really counts.
In the championship game of the Stan
ford Cardinal Classic Mclntyre tallied the
only goal to clinch a 1-0 victory over No. 10
Duke. The senior scored with a well-placed
angle shot on a penalty kick 28 minutes into
the first half.
All three of her goals this season have
come on penalty kicks. Her first two goals
came in a game against Washington in the
Washington State Invitational. The tallies
iced the 4-0 win for Stanford.
Even if she weren't making game-win
ning scores Mclntyre deserves praise. One of
the top sweepers in the nation, she anchors

the Cardinal defense. The senior from Lagu
na Hills, Calif., was named First Team All-
Far West the past two seasons and appears a
cinch to make it three years in a row.
In large part due to Mclntyre's play, the
hooters have posted three straight
shutouts, limiting Stanford opponents to
only a handful of shots on goal per game.
Cardinal opponents have only scored twice
in nine contests.
