While a plethora of Cardinal fans lit
their barbecues and prepared for their tail
gaters Saturday, one group of Stanford
athletes had already taken the field.
But they weren't wearing helmets or
tossing a leather ball; instead, these women
sported mouthpieces and played with sticks.

Field Hockey

Cardinal 2
Bears 1

In a game against classic rival Califor
nia, Stanford's field hockey team extended
their perfect conference record, handing
the Bears a 2-1 defeat.
The victory improves the Cardinal's
record to 6-2-0 overall, and 3-0 in Northern
Pacific Conference play. Now two of those
wins have come at the Bears expense.
Three weeks ago Stanford beat the Bear's
1-0 on their home turf.
In Saturday's game Cal scored the first
goal, about midway through the first half.
However, they could never seize control, as
Stanford junior midfielder Christina Trevi
no evened the score just minutes later.
Trevino, one of the youngest players
ever to be selected to the U.S. squad,
haunted the Bears with her quick, aggres
sive play. Although the score remained tied
throughout most of the game, Stanford
clearly dominated. The Cardinal's offense
consistently controlled the ball as well as
the contest.
The Cardinal offense threatened to
score many times, including several oppor
tunities on corners.

However, it wasn't until late in the sec
ond half that senior forward Michele
Bey net recorded Stanford's second goal
and provided the winning margin. The
victory marked a two-game sweep of the
Bears this season.
Beynet, a co-captain from Tulsa, Okla.,
demonstrated the perseverance which
typifies the field hockey team.
Although Stanford's support for field
hockey is sparse, the club sport continues
to succeed and attract talent. Stanford
was undefeated last year in conference
play and is the defending NorPac champi
on.
Recent match-ups indicate increased
diversity for scoring potential. The sea
son's leading scorer, sophomore Sara Hal
lock, continues to contribute, but oppos
ing defenses have been focused on her
lately. The forward from San Diego has
scored nine of Stanford's 14 goals in 1991.
Luckily she is surrounded by team
mates with scoring capability. Senior mid
fielder Susan Leckrone has scored this
season, as have senior forward Kris
Puryear and freshman midfielder Tina
Syer. Leckrone and Trevino are tied for
the team lead in assists with three apiece.
The field hockey team completes a
three-game home stint this Saturday at
11 a.m. in a non-conference matchup
against Cornell.
The Cardinal is quickly approaching
conference playoffs, which begin Nov. 1.
The upcoming games are very important
in determining seeding and game sites for
conference playoffs.
Stanford will seek to compete in NCAA
playoffs for the second consecutive year.
Coach Sheryl Johnson has led four teams
to the NCAAs since her induction as head
coach in 1985.
