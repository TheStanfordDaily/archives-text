# Date set for hearing in underage sex case
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
Stuart Thomas' case will be
moved from municipal court to
the Santa Clara County superior
court for review in two weeks,
Municipal Court Judge Charles
Cory announced yesterday.
Thomas, a junior, is charged
with unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor and providing alco
hol to a minor in connection with
an alleged sexual assault in Stern
Hall last month.
On Oct. 21, a representative
from the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office will
meet with Thomas' lawyer,
Melvin de la Motte, to review and
discuss the case in the presence of
a judge â€” a normal procedure for

criminal cases, according to
Deputy District Attorney Lance
Bayer.
The meeting, called a superior
court review, potentially offers an
opportunity to settle the case
without a trial, since the partici
pants can informally discuss the
case, reveal some of their evidence
or plea bargain.
If no settlement is reached,
Thomas plans to enter a plea of
not guilty at a county court hear
ing set for Oct. 23, according to de
la Motte.
A judge would then set a date
for a preliminary examination, at
which he or she would decide
whether the case has sufficient
evidence to warrant a trial.
