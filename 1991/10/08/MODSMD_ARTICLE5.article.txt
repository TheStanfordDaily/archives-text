# Summer is for soaring
## Relaxing isn't on some students' minds 
### Lida Chaipat 
For three Stanford students,
summer break wasn't a break at
all â€” it was an opportunity to
shift into high gear.
Senior Jessica Silbey took
three months, and a $1,300 grant
from Undergraduate Research
Opportunities, to go to Moscow
and study the relatively new
Soviet women's grassroots politi
cal movement.
A Soviet women's movement is
only now becoming possible,
Silbey said. Through most of
their history, the Soviets have
had "a top-down political struc
ture," she said, noting that the
idea that common people can
band together to accomplish
change "is very new" and "very
democratic."

An article Silbey wrote on this
subject is due to appear in Ms.
magazine sometime in 1992.
Last March Silbey was one of
only about 20 Westerners to
attend the first Women's
Conference on Soviet history.
One of the key issues discussed at
that conference was the idea of
the "double burden."
"Soviet women want to return
to the home," Silbey said, but now
they are ready to "forge some
thing new."
The purpose of Silbey's sum
mer research was to evaluate
progress in women's rights. That
progress was enormous, she said.
"There was more enthusiasm,"
she said, adding that separate
small organizations "had made
more connections" and "were not
so isolated."
A more concrete gain by the
movement is that the Moscow
Center for Gender Studies has
been asked by government offi
cials to write up research and pro
posals on women's issues, Silbey
said.
Another senior, Adriana Duffy,
spent part of her summer closer
to home, working as a translator
at the World Gymnastic Champi
onships in Indianapolis.
Duffy is a native Spanish
speaker from Puerto Rico, but she
learned perfect English in school
and from her American father.
She was a gymnast until she took
a fall during practice at the 1989
World Championships and
injured her spinal cord.

Becoming a translator at the
competition was her way of "stay
ing involved" after her injury,
Duffy said. Since she was not
assigned to any one judge or team,
she was able to go around and
watch many of the events until
she was needed.
Next year she would like to
translate at the Olympics.
Arrangements are not definite,
said Duffy, but "knowing all the
gymnastic terms in both lan
guages is an advantage."
As for long-term goals, she said
she might use her degrees in phi
losophy and religious studies to
teach at the university level.
Senior Parsjat Desai, who like
Silbey was an undergraduate
research program grant recipient,
studied folk dance in Gujarat,
India during the summer.
Desai, a New Delhi native, said
that when she was very young,
she studied classical Indian dance
for an age-old reason: "My mom

made me." But at about the age of
13 she began to appreciate the
history inherent in the dances.
According to Desai, dance has
kept her "in touch with her
roots."
The anthropology major
explained that folk dance is "of
the people" whereas classical
dance is more "urban and struc
tured."
The purpose of Desai's trip was
"to see dance in context," study
how it was changing and "what
goes on around it." To do all this
she timed her visit so she could
attend the Janmashatami, a cele
bration of the Hindu god Krish
na's birth.
Desai spoke fondly about the
village in which she stayed. "It
was like I became their daughter,"
she said. Some of her fondest
memories were of the evenings
when "the girls of the village
would sit in the street and just
talk."
