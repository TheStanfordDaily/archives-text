## Stanford struggles to slice its budget 
### 
On October 17, the Universi
ty Cabinet — composed of
University President Don
ald Kennedy, Provost James
Rosse, the deans of Stanford's
schools and the directors of the
Hoover Institution and the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center —
will finally meet to begin the Uni
versity-wide budget-cutting pro
cess.
That day will be the second
anniversary of the Loma Prieta
earthquake, a coincidence that
hasn't escaped participants or
observers.
The results of that meeting —
to be announced early the follow
ing week — will be the keynote for
the budget-cutting process, guid
ing the decisions that will be
made by schools and administra
tive areas between October and
January.
Among the decisions that will
be announced:

• Targets for budget reductions
for each school and administra
tive area;
• Preliminary decisions on a num
ber of University-wide budget
issues, including the size of the
student body, management of
student aid and the future of
overseas campuses;
• A statement of the University's
mission, including its overall pri
orities and commitment to teach
ing and research programs "that
will serve as guidance for the
planning effort," according to
Rosse; and
• Procedural instructions on how
the decision-making process
should be organized in schools
and administrative units.
The process will then move
from the University-wide level to
individual departments and
administrative areas, which will
decide what to cut in order to
meet their targets.
