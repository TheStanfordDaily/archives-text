# Understanding the budget
## 
### 
With a $1.08 billion annual budget and a
$2 billion endowment, why is Stanford
struggling to cut just $40 million?
Answering that question requires an
understanding of both the nature of the
University's budget and the endowment.
Of the billion-dollar consolidated bud
get, only the $425 million operating budget
is facing large cuts. The other 60 percent of
the consolidated budget consists of other
Stanford budgets, such as those for spon
sored research, the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center and auxiliary enterprises,
such as Tresidder Union.
Administrators describe those other
areas of the consolidated budget as "tubs
with their own bottoms" — unfruitful can
didates for cuts because they are largely
self-supporting. SLAC, for example, gener
ates its own income in the form of Depart
ment of Energy research grants.
It is the operating budget that must be
slashed by $40 million, and finding 10 per
cent to trim from day-to-day expenses is
not an easy task.
Included in the operating budget are
salaries and benefits, student financial aid
and operations and maintenance. Salaries
and benefits alone make up more than 65
percent of the operating budget.
There are a number of reasons why Stan
ford now faces the $40 million annual shortfall:
• The federal government slashed the
University's indirect-cost recovery rate
from 76 to 55.5 percent, translating into a
loss of more than $26 million each year;
• Research volume, which was expected
to increase at a rate slightly higher than
inflation, has actually leveled off; and

• The recession has decreased the inter
est income from Stanford's reserves.
Many faculty members and students
have asked why none of the $1.1 billion
raised by the Centennial Campaign can be
used to cover the $40 million deficit in the
operating budget.
They also question how the University
can think of cutting academic programs
and administrative services at the same
time it paves parking lots, builds dormito
ries and erects road signs with the money
raised by the Centennial Campaign.
The reason can seem difficult to grasp,
but it is fundamental to accounting: an oper
ating deficit is a continuing problem that
isn't covered by cutting one-time expenses or
by temporarily increasing income.
Deciding not to fix Memorial Church, or
to delay construction of a dormitory, for
example, would save money in the short
term. But it doesn't solve the problem: the
University would still be losing money on
its day-to-day operations. If it didn't bring
its operating budget into balance, the Uni
versity would be put in the position of can
celing project after project, year after year,
in order to meet operating shortfalls.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare describes it
as a hemorrhage. Canceling one-time expens
es and using reserves to cover the deficit may
change the University's figures for a given
year — but they don't stop the bleeding.
That bleeding has also given the budget
cutting process increased urgency. Much as
they'd like to have more time to complete the
process, the University is losing money every
day until the budget cuts are implemented.
