A meeting you'll never forget
*:
Suddenly, there you are.
Face to face with the opportunity of a life
time...and the implications are enormous.
You're marketing for Microsoft. In league with
the smartest strategists in the industry. On
products destined to revolutionize the future of
personal computing.
As an Assistant Marketing Manager you con
duct seminars that serve a dual purpose. You pre
sent new products and acquire valuable information
on market trends and user needs. You'll enjoy close
interaction with product and channel marketing,
corporate communications and the sales force. As
an Assistant Product Manager, you'll assist in
developing and implementing exciting marketing
plans for Microsoft products. By developing strong
relationships with OEMs (original equipment
manufacturers) and ISVs (independent software
vendors), you'll gain insights that will help shape
future marketing strategies.
You'll find Microsoft products everywhere you
go. Innovations like Windows, Word and Excel that
shook the earth. Sure, the challenges are immense.
But so are the rewards.
If you're interested in a marketing career where
you'll never butt heads with corporate committees,
come talk with us at the Company Presentation. It's
a meeting you'll never forget.
We're an equal opportunity employer and are
working toward a more culturally divers workplace.
