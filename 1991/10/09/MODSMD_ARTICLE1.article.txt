# DOMESTIC PARTNERS, ONE YEAR LATER
## Decision 'liberated' Stanford lives 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
For law student Susan
Mizner, the extension of spouse
benefits to same-sex and oppo
site-sex domestic partners at
Stanford a year ago today was
truly a triumph.
"It made my admiration and
loyalty to Stanford enormous,"
she said. "I felt that it was a
community with a conscience,
where people could be talked to
about an injustice, and would be
willing to correct it. It was an
enormously liberating experi
ence."
The domestic partners poli
cy, implemented at Stanford
Oct. 9 last year, awarded hous
ing and other benefits to same
sex couples, as well as to oppo
site-sex unmarried couples.
Although it attracted some con
troversy when it went into
effect, officials and students say
the policy has been working
well.
William Georges, the acting
director of the Stanford
Housing Center, said the policy
is meeting its objectives and
students now "don't have to
choose between personal com
mitments and their studies.
We're very pleased with its
implementation during the first
year."
Georges said 60 of the 415
units in married student/couple
housing are occupied by domes
tic partners this year, the
majority of whom are graduate
students.
He estimated that four of the
60 couples are same-sex, while
the rest are opposite-sex cou
ples.
Mizner first realized her

and vulnerable that

we're playing soft

need for the policy in 1989
when she was trying to find
ways she and her partner,
Rachel Bernstein, could live
together.
Bernstein, finishing up law
school back east, would soon be
moving to California. Restricted
by a mutual lack of funds, on
campus housing seemed to be
the only feasible choice for the
couple.
And Mizner said she liked
the idea; she wanted to be part
of the on-campus community.
"I didn't want Rachel's experi
ence at Stanford to be that of an
outsider," she said.
What followed, Mizner said,
was a year-long process "of
meeting people, learning who
the decision-makers were, and
negotiating with the Univer
sity."
She and a core group of stu
dents at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center
worked to hammer out the poli
cy with the University over the
next year.
Tom Henning, a former lec
turer in mechanical engineering
and a member of the LGBCC
group, said it was an "issue of
equity."

housing and are now beginning their second year living together in
Escondido Village. "We expected a lot more hostility," Mims says.
