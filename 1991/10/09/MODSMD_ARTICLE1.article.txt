# DOMESTIC PARTNERS, ONE YEAR LATER
## Decision 'liberated' Stanford lives 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
For law student Susan
Mizner, the extension of spouse
benefits to same-sex and oppo
site-sex domestic partners at
Stanford a year ago today was
truly a triumph.
"It made my admiration and
loyalty to Stanford enormous,"
she said. "I felt that it was a
community with a conscience,
where people could be talked to
about an injustice, and would be
willing to correct it. It was an
enormously liberating experi
ence."
The domestic partners poli
cy, implemented at Stanford
Oct. 9 last year, awarded hous
ing and other benefits to same
sex couples, as well as to oppo
site-sex unmarried couples.
Although it attracted some con
troversy when it went into
effect, officials and students say
the policy has been working
well.
William Georges, the acting
director of the Stanford
Housing Center, said the policy
is meeting its objectives and
students now "don't have to
choose between personal com
mitments and their studies.
We're very pleased with its
implementation during the first
year."
Georges said 60 of the 415
units in married student/couple
housing are occupied by domes
tic partners this year, the
majority of whom are graduate
students.
He estimated that four of the
60 couples are same-sex, while
the rest are opposite-sex cou
ples.

need for the policy in 1989
when she was trying to find
ways she and her partner,
Rachel Bernstein, could live
together.
Bernstein, finishing up law
school back east, would soon be
moving to California. Restricted
by a mutual lack of funds, on
campus housing seemed to be
the only feasible choice for the
couple.
And Mizner said she liked
the idea; she wanted to be part
of the on-campus community.
"I didn't want Rachel's experi
ence at Stanford to be that of an
outsider," she said.
What followed, Mizner said,
was a year-long process "of
meeting people, learning who
the decision-makers were, and
negotiating with the Univer
sity."
She and a core group of stu
dents at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center
worked to hammer out the poli
cy with the University over the
next year.
Tom Henning, a former lec
turer in mechanical engineering
and a member of the LGBCC
group, said it was an "issue of
equity."

Jon Osborne, left, and Steve Mims applied for domestic partners'
housing and are now beginning their second year living together in
Escondido Village. "We expected a lot more hostility," Mims says.
By implementing the policy,
the University would demonstrate
that "same-sex partners are of
equivalent importance," he said.
"It was actually a very fast pro
cess," Mizner remembered, "though
at times we joked about having to get
approval from both houses of
Congress."
University officials and admin
istrators, she said, "just needed to
learn and understand more about
what was a natural and mandato
ry application of the non-discrim
ination policy."
Mizner emphasized the Uni
versity's sensitivity to the issue.
"As soon as people in the adminis
tration heard the human conse
quences for my relationship and
schooling, they made things hap
pen and took risks," she said. "It
was rare and noble."
David Bradfute, a graduate
student and a member of the
LGBCC group, said that attaining
the policy changed his life in a sig
nificant way because he "had
never before been comfortable
with being gay in an open way."
But through his work with the
group, he learned that "if you pre
sent your arguments and work
hard, you can make it happen."
"Before, I was more of a whin
er," Bradfute said. "Now I've
learned to change things in a posi
tive way."
Mizner expressed similar feel
ings. "I had never thought I
would be a gay rights activist, but
I can now," she said.
Her work with the domestic
partners policy prompted Mizner
to consider a career working for
gay rights, she said.
She and Bernstein found life in
Escondido Village, where they
ended up living last year, to be
"quite good," Mizner said.
A few problems did come up
during Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week last year, includ
ing a defaced poster and other
minor incidents, Mizner added.
"Everybody quoted in the
newspaper got hate mail," she
said. "It's part of the price of
being public on this issue. We felt
so exposed and vulnerable that we
bought a baseball bat because we
just didn't know. Now we're play
ing softball with it."
Mizner emphasized the posi
tive effect the domestic partner
policy has had on her life.

"The best thing about it," she
said, "was that it made it possible
for us to be active members of the
community, to have a full univer
sity experience and to really be
part of something."
'We expected more hostility'
Steve Mims and Jon Osborne met
through their political activity in
the Libertarian Party and spent
seven years traveling back and
forth between California and Ten
nessee.
When, at 32, Mims decided to
return to school to pursue a
degree in electrical engineering,
Stanford presented the perfect
opportunity for the couple to
finally be able to live together.
Initially, they lived in an apart
ment off-campus. But the higher
rent and the fact that Osborne
had to spend more than three
hours each day commuting to
work by train severely restricted
their lifestyle.
When they heard about the
new policy, they immediately
applied as domestic partners, and

shortly thereafter moved in. This
fall marks the beginning of their
second year together in Escondido
Village.
"It was surprisingly easy,"
Mims said. "We expected a lot
more hostility."
There was some tension, how
ever. The couple attended the
open forums that took place last
year to discuss the new policy, and
were so surprised by some peo
ple's hostility that they didn't
dare speak up.
Afterwards, Osborne decided
that they should do something
nice to ease the tension. His letter
to The Daily thanking University
President Donald Kennedy for
the policy appeared in the
Thanksgiving issue last year.
Osborne said the letter "neu
tralized the issue at that time. It
was a triumph of diplomacy over
hostility."
He and Mims report that
Escondido Village has been
"great, really nice and afford
able."
Though they weren't involved

in the group that worked out of
the LGBCC, they expressed deep
thanks for the opportunity that it
gave them.
"We wanted to be more of a
part of the community," Mims
said, and the new policy is allow
ing the couple to do that.
No displacement reported
Georges, of the Stanford Hous
ing Center, dismissed the concern
some people had during the dis
cussion over the policy that
domestic partners would displace
married couples. By the end of the
summer his office was able to offer
housing to all couples on the wait
ing list and still had 13 vacancies.
The housing option, despite
the controversy, is one of the
least-utilized domestic partners
benefits on campus. Partners may
also use Cowell Student Health
Center on a fee-for-service basis,
and may pick up spouse cards that
allow them full use of campus
facilities.
"The gay community is using
these other benefits quite sub
stantially," Bradfute said.
Eleanor Feingold, a doctoral
candidate and member of the
LGBCC group, has never lived in
Escondido Village with her part
ner, but appreciates the benefits
of her partner having a spouse
card.
"It's nice to buy two student
tickets and be able to actually sit
together. And we never could go
swimming together before," she
said.
Though exact numbers were
not available, Acting Registrar
Jack Farrell reported that the
demand for spouse cards for
domestic partners was relatively
low, and hadn't increased his
office's workload at all.
Cowell director Harvey Wein
stein said the health center expe
rienced quite a rush right after
the policy was announced, but
said it is much more settled now.
"We're committed to seeing the
policy through," he added.
Cowell hopes to be able to offer
health insurance to domestic
partners in the winter.
Floyd Thompkins, associate
dean of Memorial Church, was
cited by members of the LGBCC
group as a key player in establish
ing the policy. He is satisfied with
the result of his work.
"It's gone really well," Thomp
kins said. "Fear and imagination
are often different than reality,
and it's been calm, with no fire
works."
For law student Susan
Mizner, the extension of spouse
benefits to same-sex and oppo

ended up living last year, to be
"quite good," Mizner said.
A few problems did come up
during Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week last year, includ
ing a defaced poster and other
minor incidents, Mizner added.
"Everybody quoted in the
newspaper got hate mail," she
said. "It's part of the price of
being public on this issue. We felt
so exposed and vulnerable that we
bought a baseball bat because we
just didn't know. Now we're play
ing softball with it."
Mizner emphasized the posi
tive effect the domestic partner
policy has had on her life.

"The best thing about it," she
said, "was that it made it possible
for us to be active members of the
community, to have a full univer
sity experience and to really be
part of something."
'We expected more hostility'
Steve Mims and Jon Osborne met
through their political activity in
the Libertarian Party and spent
seven years traveling back and
forth between California and Ten
nessee.
When, at 32, Mims decided to
return to school to pursue a
degree in electrical engineering,
Stanford presented the perfect
opportunity for the couple to
finally be able to live together.
Initially, they lived in an apart
ment off-campus. But the higher
rent and the fact that Osborne
had to spend more than three
hours each day commuting to
work by train severely restricted
their lifestyle.
When they heard about the
new policy, they immediately
applied as domestic partners, and

shortly thereafter moved in. This
fall marks the beginning of their
second year together in Escondido
Village.
"It was surprisingly easy,"
Mims said. "We expected a lot
more hostility."
There was some tension, how
ever. The couple attended the
open forums that took place last
year to discuss the new policy, and
were so surprised by some peo
ple's hostility that they didn't
dare speak up.
Afterwards, Osborne decided
that they should do something
nice to ease the tension. His letter
to The Daily thanking University
President Donald Kennedy for
the policy appeared in the
Thanksgiving issue last year.
Osborne said the letter "neu
tralized the issue at that time. It
was a triumph of diplomacy over
hostility."
He and Mims report that
Escondido Village has been
"great, really nice and afford
able."
Though they weren't involved

in the group that worked out of
the LGBCC, they expressed deep
thanks for the opportunity that it
gave them.
"We wanted to be more of a
part of the community," Mims
said, and the new policy is allow
ing the couple to do that.
No displacement reported
Georges, of the Stanford Hous
ing Center, dismissed the concern
some people had during the dis
cussion over the policy that
domestic partners would displace
married couples. By the end of the
summer his office was able to offer
housing to all couples on the wait
ing list and still had 13 vacancies.
The housing option, despite
the controversy, is one of the
least-utilized domestic partners
benefits on campus. Partners may
also use Cowell Student Health
Center on a fee-for-service basis,
and may pick up spouse cards that
allow them full use of campus
facilities.
"The gay community is using
these other benefits quite sub
stantially," Bradfute said.
Eleanor Feingold, a doctoral
candidate and member of the
LGBCC group, has never lived in
Escondido Village with her part
ner, but appreciates the benefits
of her partner having a spouse
card.
"It's nice to buy two student
tickets and be able to actually sit
together. And we never could go
swimming together before," she
said.
Though exact numbers were
not available, Acting Registrar
Jack Farrell reported that the
demand for spouse cards for
domestic partners was relatively
low, and hadn't increased his
office's workload at all.
Cowell director Harvey Wein
stein said the health center expe
rienced quite a rush right after
the policy was announced, but
said it is much more settled now.
"We're committed to seeing the
policy through," he added.
Cowell hopes to be able to offer
health insurance to domestic
partners in the winter.
Floyd Thompkins, associate
dean of Memorial Church, was
cited by members of the LGBCC
group as a key player in establish
ing the policy. He is satisfied with
the result of his work.
"It's gone really well," Thomp
kins said. "Fear and imagination
are often different than reality,
and it's been calm, with no fire
works."
For law student Susan
Mizner, the extension of spouse
benefits to same-sex and oppo
site-sex domestic partners at
Stanford a year ago today was
truly a triumph.
"It made my admiration and
loyalty to Stanford enormous,"
she said. "I felt that it was a
community with a conscience,
where people could be talked to
about an injustice, and would be
willing to correct it. It was an
enormously liberating experi
ence."
The domestic partners poli
cy, implemented at Stanford
Oct. 9 last year, awarded hous
ing and other benefits to same
sex couples, as well as to oppo
site-sex unmarried couples.
Although it attracted some con
troversy when it went into
effect, officials and students say
the policy has been working
well.
William Georges, the acting
director of the Stanford
Housing Center, said the policy
is meeting its objectives and
students now "don't have to
choose between personal com
mitments and their studies.
We're very pleased with its
implementation during the first
year."
Georges said 60 of the 415
units in married student/couple
housing are occupied by domes
tic partners this year, the
majority of whom are graduate
students.
He estimated that four of the
60 couples are same-sex, while
the rest are opposite-sex cou
ples.

need for the policy in 1989
when she was trying to find
ways she and her partner,
Rachel Bernstein, could live
together.
Bernstein, finishing up law
school back east, would soon be
moving to California. Restricted
by a mutual lack of funds, on
campus housing seemed to be
the only feasible choice for the
couple.
And Mizner said she liked
the idea; she wanted to be part
of the on-campus community.
"I didn't want Rachel's experi
ence at Stanford to be that of an
outsider," she said.
What followed, Mizner said,
was a year-long process "of
meeting people, learning who
the decision-makers were, and
negotiating with the Univer
sity."
She and a core group of stu
dents at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center
worked to hammer out the poli
cy with the University over the
next year.
Tom Henning, a former lec
turer in mechanical engineering
and a member of the LGBCC
group, said it was an "issue of
equity."


Carolina Katz — Daily
Jon Osborne, left, and Steve Mims applied for domestic partners'
housing and are now beginning their second year living together in
Escondido Village. "We expected a lot more hostility," Mims says.
By implementing the policy,
the University would demonstrate
that "same-sex partners are of
equivalent importance," he said.
"It was actually a very fast pro
cess," Mizner remembered, "though
at times we joked about having to get
approval from both houses of
Congress."
University officials and admin
istrators, she said, "just needed to
learn and understand more about
what was a natural and mandato
ry application of the non-discrim
ination policy."
Mizner emphasized the Uni
versity's sensitivity to the issue.
"As soon as people in the adminis
tration heard the human conse
quences for my relationship and
schooling, they made things hap
pen and took risks," she said. "It
was rare and noble."
David Bradfute, a graduate
student and a member of the
LGBCC group, said that attaining
the policy changed his life in a sig
nificant way because he "had
never before been comfortable
with being gay in an open way."
But through his work with the
group, he learned that "if you pre
sent your arguments and work
hard, you can make it happen."
"Before, I was more of a whin
er," Bradfute said. "Now I've
learned to change things in a posi
tive way."
Mizner expressed similar feel
ings. "I had never thought I
would be a gay rights activist, but
I can now," she said.
Her work with the domestic
partners policy prompted Mizner
to consider a career working for
gay rights, she said.
She and Bernstein found life in
Escondido Village, where they
ended up living last year, to be
"quite good," Mizner said.
