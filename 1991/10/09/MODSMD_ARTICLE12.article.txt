# Harassment charges delay Thomas vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate on Tuesday postponed its
vote on Clarence Thomas' Supreme
Court nomination for one week to
investigate allegations he sexually
harassed a former aide. Thomas
"totally and unequivocally" denied
the accusation.
The chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee pledged public
hearings, possibly as early as Friday.
"The nominee has the right to be
confronted by his accuser," Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., said in refer
ence to Anita Hill, Thomas' former
aide.
Biden provided an outline for

hearings after a day of drama in
which Thomas requested a delay to
"clear my name" and several crucial
Democratic supporters said they
could not vote for him until the alle
gations were aired.
Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole first called for a Friday vote,
then reluctantly agreed to the week
delay proposed by Senate Democratic
Leader George Mitchell. Dole pre
dicted Thomas ultimately would be
confirmed by a comfortable margin.
"This is a test for Clarence
Thomas," Dole said. "It is a test of
his character, and I believe he is up
to the test."

Hill, a law professor who says
Thomas made repeated lewd remarks
to her when she worked for him a
decade ago, said she would cooperate
with the Senate. "I intend to go to
Washington if it is requested," she
said.
Thomas, too, pledged to work
with the committee. Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., said Thomas told
him that "I have to restore what they
have taken from me. I have to appear
before the appropriate forum and
clear my name."
In an emotional speech, Danforth
complained bitterly that a confiden
tial FBI report on the matter had

been leaked. He said Thomas was
being crucified and sought assur
ances that the hearings would not
become a "fishing expedition."
"We will work with the commit
tee and the full Senate to bring this
matter to a vote," a statement issued
by the White House said. "Judge
Thomas is an outstanding individual
who has demonstrated his honesty
and integrity throughout his life."
On the Senate floor, Danforth
said the confirmation process had
turned into "the worst kind of sleazy
political campaign, with no effort
spared to assassinate the character
of Clarence Thomas."
