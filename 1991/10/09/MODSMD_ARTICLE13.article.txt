UNITED NATIONS (AP) â€” Iraqi nuclear scien
tists were working on a hydrogen-bomb project as well
as the atom bomb program discovered earlier by U.N.
inspectors, the director of the International Atomic
Energy Agency said Tuesday.
lAEA director Hans Blix and one of his chief inspec
tors, David Kay, said the Iraqis had developed a small
quantity of lithium-6, a material used only in hydrogen
weapons, and planned to produce much larger
amounts.
They made their comments in a news conference at
the United Nations.
Kay, the leader of the nuclear inspection team that
was barricaded in a Baghdad parking lot for five days
last month when it refused to give up documents it had
seized, said documents showed the Iraqis intended to
manufacture about 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds)
of lithium-6 each year.
Neither man would disclose how much lithium-6 is
needed to produce a working thermonuclear weapon.
"We are not supposed to know that," Blix said.
The lithium was only the latest in a series of shock
ing discoveries about the depth of Iraq's nuclear pro
gram.
U.N. officials reported last week that Iraq had been
from 12-18 months from coming up with a working
atom bomb that could have been delivered by missile.
