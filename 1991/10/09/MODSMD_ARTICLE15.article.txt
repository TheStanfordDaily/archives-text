Stanford's sexual assault
response and prevention
program lacks strentgh

SEXUAL ASSAULT OCCURS
far too often on this campus. In
a 1989 survey by the Rape Edu
cation Project, one out of four under
graduate women was found to be
coerced into unwanted sexual activi
ty during her years at Stanford.
Rape educators know these
facts with certainty:
• Early counseling is critical to a
rape victim's recovery;
• The more complicated the pro
cedure and the more people a vic
tim must talk to, the less likely she
is to report her attack; and
• The longer a victim waits, the
more difficult it is for the police to
collect evidence.
There are many ifs and few
assurances with rape. How likely is
it, then, that the victim of a sexual
assault will find immediate help?
Last year the University Task
Force on Sexual Assault issued rec
ommendations about what the Uni
versity should do to respond to the
problem of sexual assault. One
important recommendation called
for the establishment of a highly vis
ible Coordinator of Sexual Assault
Response Services, who would serve
as an advocate for rape victims and
guide them through the whole pro
cess of reporting.
Because the University lacked
sufficient funds, the ASSU stepped
in. But, in establishing the position
of rape education coordinator with
a $20,000 salary and an additional
$20,000 budget, the ASSU left out
advocacy.
So far education efforts have
been focused solely on resident
assistants and freshmen. The time
to educate and prevent rape is at
the beginning of the year before
the year's statistics mount.
Last year Cowell Student Health
Center established the Campus Sexu
al Assault Response and Recovery

Team (C-SARRT) to provide a 24-
hour response service for rape victims.
There are several fundamental
problems with this service, however.
Women on campus do not know
where to call; the service's phone
number has not been advertised;
and Stanford operators do not know
where to refer someone wishing to
report a rape.
Even if someone does know the
right number to call, a trained rape
counselor may not pick up the line.
If calling after 5 p.m., a woman will
be transferred potentially several
times and instructed to leave her
name and number and to wait to be
back
While both C-SARRT's and the
ASSU's intentions are unquestion
ably sincere in their attempts to
prevent and respond to sexual
assault, the existing system is strik
ingly inadequate. The $40,000 set
aside by the ASSU is only a one
year project whose future status,
given the University's budget woes,
remains in question. The Universi
ty must provide funding for the
position, although the emphasis
should shift from that of solely edu
cation to advocacy for victims.
It is crucial that Stanford estab
lish a 24-hour rape hotline with
trained personnel on the other end
of the line at all times and publi
cize it thoroughly so that during a
crisis, a woman need only pick up
the telephone once to talk to a
trained, caring person. It needn't
require a huge outlay of resources
and could be established through
C-SARRT. Volunteer rape coun
selors from within the Stanford
community could be used.
The University made some posi
tive steps last year in establishing C
SARRT. More needs to be done, how
ever, to prevent rape and treat its
consequences. Though the inten
tions are sincere, current response
mechanisms are inadequate and may
even discourage a victim from
reporting.

C-SARRT's phone number is 723-
4861 (after 5 p.m.) or 723-3785
(daytime).
