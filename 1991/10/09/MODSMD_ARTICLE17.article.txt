## A 						farewell to physics 
### 
I HAVE WAITED, WAITED AND wait
ed for myself to turn around, but the
hourglass has just exhausted the last
grain of sand. The passion has long fizzled.
So, it is time to say farewell to physics.
As a schoolboy, I was always intrigued
by mysteries. I often stared at the night
sky, feeling the stars were staring back at
me. I asked them just how wide and deep
the universe was. Then I took physics.
I learned about the uncertain particle,
the vibrating string and the theory of
grand unification. I became thoroughly
immersed in the world of quarks and lep
tons. I was determined to discover the
laws of the universe.
I am no longer a schoolboy anymore.
Although I still eryoy reading a Feynman
diagram occasionally, somehow truth and
beauty of the physical laws have all become
secondary concerns. So for a long time I
have been a mere observer of my friends
and colleagues, the working physicists.
I have wandered through your labs, my
friends. I saw those red and green lasers,
bent by mirrors and focused with lenses.
My colleagues, behind those protective
goggles, I saw my own eyes, the schoolboy
staring at the sky. Your hands were fid
dling with a knob. The scope brightened
with traveling lights.
It was midnight. In the quintessence of
darkness, a physicist was working in the
ambience of red and green.
I have been at the control room of your

powerful accelerator. The giant control
panel was full of meters, switches and
lights. You were talking to the central lab
on the microphone. The computer moni
tor was showing a cross section of the
mighty machine and the condition of the
electron beam that was circling at the
speed of light. Suddenly an alarm broke
the silence. A set of lights started to blink.
You ran towards the electronic room. Two
minutes later, all was quiet again.
This was also midnight. Only the deer
on the hill were wondering about the
lights in the valley.
I have observed your offices, a simple
place of desk, chair, computer, paper and
pencils. In the plain surrounding sat you,
the theorist. The pencil was walking back
and forth on the paper. You raised your
head. Your hand was on your chin. I
peeked at the equations you were writing
down. The brackets and four legged dia
grams jumped out at me.
I have also seen your joy of discovery.
You were running around like a child.
Your cheeks blossomed, your smile twin
kled and your fingers danced. You grabbed
everyone and anyone you could find. Col
leagues surrounded you. You proudly set
up the overhead projector and explained
your findings.
I can only watch all of that with envy and
regret. I envy your camaraderie, the privi
lege of belonging together. I regret that I
could not sustain your dedication and that I

can no longer share your joy and dreams
I was at one of your beach parties the
other day. The distinctive gray air pushed
the smell of the barbecue into my nose.
Waves broke on the shore, spreading
white bubbles all over the beach. Some of
you were playing volleyball, some were
throwing a frisbee, and some were gather
ing around the food and drink, talking
about Terry's new-born baby, Dan's new
red convertible, this fall's new movie and
of course the paradoxes of physical laws.
You all looked so happy; your faces filled
with smile, puzzle and wonderment. Oh, how
I wished I could share with you this moment
of joy, but I am no longer part of you.
Time has unfortunately washed away
the dream of that schoolboy. The lure of
that house on the green hill, the yacht in
the blue ocean and that far away vacation
on the paradise island proves a powerful
distraction from a midnight experiment.
Sadly, the material world has just cap
tured another soul. This time, it is mine.
So I must now say good-bye to my remark
able colleagues and bid farewell to physics.
