## Loss of academic programs would prove Farm's demise 
### 
IT WAS WITH SHOCK AND disbelief
that I read last Friday's articles con
cerning the budget crisis and pro
posed cuts. Can members of the Faculty
Senate seriously be considering cutting
academic programs in the arts and "non
traditional" departments? Is it possible
that Stanford University, which just cele
brated 100 years dedicated to academic
quality and intellectual pursuits, is prior
itizing academic departments, lining
some up for the chopping block?
It has taken Stanford 100 years to
attain a quality of education irrefutably
comparable to the "Big Three" of the
East Coast; slashing any academic pro
grams would revert Stanford to the sta
tus of "third-rate university" which was
gloomily predicted at its outset.
Since budget cuts are necessary in our
time of economic crisis, the primary tar

gets should be obvious: those depart
ments which do not serve the Stanford's
original goal (and our goal still today, I
hope) of an institution dedicated to aca
demic excellence. Thus, the Department
of Athletics should be the starting point
of budget cuts.
Although in more prosperous times it
was deemed appropriate to have a com
petitive athletics program, when it comes
right down to it, athletics is not the rea
son for this university's existence.
Although some athletic programs are
excellent, we must exercise our priority
to save the academics of the University
and salvage whatever we can after that.
Therefore, athletic scholarships should
be eliminated.
I realize that without athletic scholar
ships many of the student-athletes would
opt for other universities which could

offer them athletic scholarships, but that
is a tragedy of our time. However, those
athletes who met academic requirements
and were dedicated to Stanford's goal of
academic excellence would come to Stan
ford regardless.
Thus, student-athletes would be on the
same level as other students, who have to
choose between other schools which offer
academic scholarships and Stanford, with
its policy of need-based financial aid.
Although these measures may sound
drastic, our current crisis demands them.
The women's soccer team is an example of
a team without athletic scholarships, but
with an excellent program and excellent
student-athletes! It is time to put other
athletic programs to the test.
In addition, overseas studies programs
should be opened up to academically
qualified students of other universities.

Stanford cannot afford its own private
overseas campuses anymore, so it is logi
cal to begin a system of cost-sharing. As a
student who participated in the overseas
program, I feel the University can only
gain through a system of partnerships in
its overseas campuses.
I realize this is only the starting point
for budget cuts, but the point is that we
cannot and must not sacrifice academic
programs. All academic programs are
essential to the future of this university
and its students. Perhaps some adminis
trative streamlining may be necessary,
but substantial cuts in any academic pro
gram will not serve the University's pur
pose, but instead will have negative
repercussions for perhaps the next 100
years.
