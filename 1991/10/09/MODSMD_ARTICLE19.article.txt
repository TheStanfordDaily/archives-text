# Blurred line between consent, coercion proves dangerous
## 
### 
In light of the alleged wrongdoings in
Casa Zapata last month it is natural for
those of us who care about the rights of
the individual to be gravely concerned:
There should be no place in our commu
nity for those who are prepared to force
their sexuality on others.
One of the implications of the pursuit
of a society where an individual can be
free, but at the same time protected from
the excesses of his contemporaries, is the
importance of individual responsibility.
This, coupled with self-honesty and
informed consideration, may be the most
appropriate means of achieving our goal.
Two pieces which I read in The Daily
on Oct. 7 deepened my disquiet; one was
a letter by Janet Stemwedel and the
other a column by Tamala Edwards. Both
had accounts of instances in which
women had been abused. When people
are being victimized they may lash out in
self-defense. Unfortunately, this can

work against freedom and equality
because it undermines the calm, rational
and honest thinking that must be done.
What I am referring to specifically is
the reactionary stance taken by
Stemwedel. She wonders what recourse
non-minors would have had if they had
been in the same situation as the recent
Casa Zapata victim. Stemwedel seems to
believe strongly that the recent incident
was one of forcible rape, citing the opin
ion of Detective Frecceri. In her state
ment to the police, however, the victim
stated that "she didn't feel any pressure
from the suspect, and that he didn't
make any verbal threats."
Frecceri's opinion, I assume, was
based on the statement that she felt "a
certain coercion" due to her alcohol
intake and the physical size of the sus
pect. It is an investigator's job to explore
all possible grounds for prosecution, and
Frecceri must be encouraged to make rec

ommendations according to his under
standing of the law.
However, it is the district attorney's
office that has the job of deciding
whether there is evidence of a crime that
a reasonable jury would accept as proof.
The rejection of the forcible rape charge
is appropriate, given the victim's own
statement of the facts.
Stuart Thomas was clearly irresponsi
ble in his acts if he gave alcohol to and had
sex with an underage girl. But if she did
not tell him she did not wish sexual con
tact, he cannot be accused of forcing him
self upon her. (And in this I am certainly
not implying any fault in the recent victim
as I do not know if she considers herself to
have been forcibly raped.)
To imply that sex should be "forcible
rape" in circumstances where the woman
consents, but feels bad about it, is a step
toward oppression for both women and
men: It might protect the irresponsible

from themselves but would interfere with
the rights of those who wish to take
responsibility for their actions and who
wish their private lives to be private.
