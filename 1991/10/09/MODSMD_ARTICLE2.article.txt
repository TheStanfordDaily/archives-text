# Women's colleges: best education in '90s?

To most Stanford women, the idea of
spending their college years solely with mem
bers of the same sex was not very compelling.
They did, after all, choose Stanford over the
93 all-women's colleges in the United States.

Janet McKay, president of Mills College in
Oakland, agrees. "If you look at the statistics
nationally, and if you look at the benchmarks
of success, one-third of the Fortune 500
women are women's college grads."
McKay also said that about 40 percent of
congresswomen and 40 percent of female law
partners are graduates of women's colleges.
But statistics only tell part of the story.

"Women's colleges are in the business of edu

center of what it does," McKay said.
Sampson said "a number of reasons"
explain how women's colleges can educate
more effectively than coeducational schools.
"You have role models, and that in itself is

provide "that nitty-gritty experience of learn
ing how to get things done."
