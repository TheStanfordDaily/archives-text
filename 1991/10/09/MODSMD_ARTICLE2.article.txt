# Women's colleges: best education in '90s?
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
To most Stanford women, the idea of
spending their college years solely with mem
bers of the same sex was not very compelling.
They did, after all, choose Stanford over the
93 all-women's colleges in the United States.
But research into how the sexes may learn
differently, and a resurgence in the marketing
of women's colleges may cause a few women to
re-evaluate.
"The students become very strong advo
cates (of women's colleges) shortly after they
get here," said Patsy Sampson, president of

Stephens College in Minnesota. "They really
do eiyoy it."
Sampson claims, there is "a great deal of
data to support that the graduates of women's
colleges are over-represented" in the upper
echelons of business and government.
Janet McKay, president of Mills College in
Oakland, agrees. "If you look at the statistics
nationally, and if you look at the benchmarks
of success, one-third of the Fortune 500
women are women's college grads."
McKay also said that about 40 percent of
congresswomen and 40 percent of female law
partners are graduates of women's colleges.
But statistics only tell part of the story.

"Women's colleges are in the business of edu
cating women, and [Mills] puts women at the
center of what it does," McKay said.
Sampson said "a number of reasons"
explain how women's colleges can educate
more effectively than coeducational schools.
"You have role models, and that in itself is
good," she said, adding that women's colleges
provide "that nitty-gritty experience of learn
ing how to get things done."
According to Stanford Psychology Asst.
Prof. Laura Carstensen, who teaches "The
Psychology of Gender," the effectiveness of
women'B colleges is not due to dif
ferences in the way men and
women learn.
"Learning refers to the acquisi
tion of new skills and information,
and to say women learn different
ly is to say that process is differ
ent, which there's no proof of,"
Carstensen said.
Rather, she said, "there are
social conditions that are perva
sive in education" that can
account for educational differ
ences across genders.
McKay agreed. "I would say it's
most certainly social," she said.
"We all have the same biological
apparatus, but the way we were
socialized makes us different."
Sampson cited "the chilly class
room climate toward women" at
coeducational colleges as one pos
sible obstacle for female students.
She pointed to a Harvard study
that found men speak in class 12
times more often than women.

The same researcher went to
Wheaton college just two years
after it became co-educational,
and found the statistic to hold
true, according to Sampson.
Richard Snow, a professor in
the School of Education, said that
while women's colleges may bene
fit some, they are not for every
one.
"I could imagine (women's col
leges) specifying social conditions
for teaching and learning that
would be congenial for some
women, and thereby promote
learning," Snow said. "But that
doesn't make them good for all
women or bad for all men."
Snow, who teaches a course on
human abilities, said that very lit
tle biological difference exists
between the sexes, as far as learn
ing is concerned.
"First of all, there are vast dif
ferences among [individual]
human beings, which are far
greater than between groups," he
said. "Almost all group differences
are very, very small."
Snow said that what we call
"learning" can be broken down

into more than 30 different learn
ing styles. Of those, "spatial abili
ty is about the only cognitive abil
ity difference that's significant,"
Snow said.
On spatial ability tests, males
tend to score slightly higher than
females, although whether the dif
ference is caused by biological or
social factors remains unclear.
McKay said women's colleges
can provide a better environment
for women. "The style, the tone,
the learning model are all women
centered," she said of Mills.
"Women are getting their styles of
learning advanced in this environ
ment."
Sampson agreed, adding that
someday men and women may
learn to work together better in
the classroom. "At some time in
the future, when the social stereo
types and sex roles change, things
could be equal," she said.
But until then, she said, many
women can be better served by
women's colleges. "I've had stu
dents say, 'For the first time, I
really feel that someone is taking
me very seriously.' "

Snow said.
On spatial ability tests, males
tend to score slightly higher than
females, although whether the dif
ference is caused by biological or
social factors remains unclear.
McKay said women's colleges
can provide a better environment
for women. "The style, the tone,
the learning model are all women
centered," she said of Mills.
"Women are getting their styles of
learning advanced in this environ
ment."
Sampson agreed, adding that
someday men and women may
learn to work together better in
the classroom. "At some time in
the future, when the social stereo
types and sex roles change, things
could be equal," she said.
But until then, she said, many
women can be better served by
women's colleges. "I've had stu
dents say, 'For the first time, I
really feel that someone is taking
me very seriously.' "
