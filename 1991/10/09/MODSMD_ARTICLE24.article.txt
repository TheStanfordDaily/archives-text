Q # I heard there are thousands
• of manmade objects in orbit
around the earth. What is the
chance that one of these objects
could fall to earth and cause seri
ous damage?
A # Since space exploration
• began, over 20,000 things
have been launched into orbit.
About 7,500 trackable (greater
than four inches across) objects
remain zipping around our earth
at 22,000 miles per hour. In com

parison, a "speeding bullet" trav
els at 12,000 mph.
Only 6 percent of these objects
are operational. The remaining 94
percent are such things as rocket
bodies, dead satellites, debris
from space operations (such as
the screwdriver an astronaut
dropped) and the fragmentation
debris from all the above.
The U.S. government informs
us that the risk of being hit by
space debris is extremely small.
Of course, they also tell us not to
worry about global warming or
the shrinking ozone layer. How
ever, the risk is much less than
that of being hit by one of the 500
meteors that strike the earth

every year. (I feel so much better,
don't you?) We are lucky that the
energy generated upon reentry
into earth's atmosphere is enough
to toast most objects into oblivion.
But, some do make it through.
In 1969, a Japanese ship cruis
ing in the vast Pacific Ocean was
hit by Soviet debris. Five sailors
were injured.
In 1978, the USSR Kosmos,
which contained a nuclear power
source, scattered debris on Cana
da over an area the size of Indiana.
In 1979, our dead Skylab
rained over Australia. The largest
piece weighed half a ton. Good
thing it didn't land in Times
Square on New Years Eve or in

the Quad during the Centennial
Convocation!
In 1987, a seven-foot piece of
metal from a Soviet rocket landed
about 100 miles north of Stan
ford. No one was hurt.
The real, danger, the govern
ment asserts, is to the people and
objects we put into space. An
orbiting piece of aluminum one
centimeter across would possess
the force of a 400-pound ACME
anvil traveling at 60 miles per
hour. Some poor astronaut may
end up looking like Wile E. Coyote
after a bout with the Roadrunner.
Currently, we can't even track
objects this small.
This means that anything we

want to survive up in space must
have extensive shielding. The
space station "it will only cost $30
billion" will need at least five
tons' worth. This also means that
by the year 2050 the nearest orbit
may be rendered unusable
because of orbiting clutter.
Space junk also interferes with
astronomical observation. But, on
the other hand, we now have new
things to observe. Some satellites
are visible to the naked eye just
before sunrise or after sunset.
Are those who launch satellites
worried? Apparently not. Accord
ing to Robert Grove Jr., a satellite

engineer, "It's like a big parking lot up there. There
are lots of empty places, and you can park in one as
long as it doesn't belong to someone else."
Q, Strolling along a beach in Monterey one
• night, we noticed that the sand seemed to
sparkle. What causes this phenomenon ?

A # I envision three distinct possibilities: (1) You
• were hallucinating; (2) You simply saw moon
light reflecting off the sand particles; or (3) You were
fortunate enough to observe some "living light."
There are many organisms capable of producing
light by way of a biochemical reaction. The most
notable include fireflies, glowworms, glowing fish
and glowing mushrooms. Some light emitters are
much, much smaller. Single-celled organisms, such
as bacteria, are responsible for a grotesque phe
nomenon — the glow of decaying bodies on a battle
field.
Other single-celled creatures called dinoflagel
lates are responsible for glowing sand. (Incidentally,
these are the same critters that sometimes make
shellfish unsafe to eat.) These tiny beasts glide
through the ocean with tiny whip-like propellers and
are carried by waves onto the sand.
If the sparkle is indeed due to stranded dinoflag
ellates, the light will be bluish and will look brighter
at a close distance. Mechanical disturbance stimu
lates light production. If you glance behind you and
see glowing footprints, they are almost certainly the
result of living light.
What is the purpose of living light? Among fire
flies, light is part of a mating ritual. In the case of
dinoflagellates, it's a burglar alarm that either
blinds or frightens their minuscule shrimp-like
predators. After all, who would want to swallow a
light bulb?
