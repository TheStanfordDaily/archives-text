# Stanford students attend space university
## 
### Joelle Linder 
Imagine going to classes every day
at a university in outer space. Your
interplanetary travels could take you
to Mars, or even the moon. This
dream may soon come true for stu
dents who will attend International
Space University (ISU) in the years to
come.
ISU was launched four years ago at
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Currently, ISU offers an
intensive 10-week, multi-disciplinary
space curriculum each summer.
Until now, students could basically
only read books to learn about space
travel.
But ISU students will no longer
have to rely only on books. ISU facul
ty and guest speakers include U.S.
astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts, in
addition to space program profession
als from around the world.
Each year, ISU accepts about 130
graduate students and young profes
sionals from 30 countries. The pro
gram aims to "raise (students') aca
demic standards and give them a
broad-base understanding of all the
different disciplines that are involved
in space exploration," according to

ISU Assistant Academic Coordinator
Jim Brice.
Four Stanford University students
participated in last summer's ISU
program in Toulouse, France. These
four agree the networking and the
international exposure to various
philosophies and technologies were
the overwhelmingly invaluable fea
tures of the program.
"The fact that this brings so many
people together is what really makes it
special," said ISU graduate Steve
Merrihew. Merrihew is in the aero
nautical engineering Ph.D. program
at Stanford.
Daniel Kraft, a second-year medical
student at Stanford, emphasized the
importance of networking. "You get to
meet fantastic people from all over the
world that hopefully you'll get to work
with some day,"he said.
Kraft is already planning to
address the medical school on the
topic of space medicine and physiolo
gy. In addition, next summer he plans
to do research on cardiovascular pre
conditioning at NASA Ames Research
Center and Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.
Kraft hopes one day to utilize his
medical training in space. While he

realizes there isn't a single route to
becoming an astronaut, he is "keeping
an open mind."
Attending ISU may very well be
one route to a career in space. Accord
ing to Brice, there is an ISU graduate
who has recently been selected to
become a U.S. astronaut. More ISU
graduates, including a British stu
dent, are in the running.
Luckily for Kraft and interested
others, the program's fields of study
are not limited to engineering and
satellite applications.
Students include lawyers, archi
tects, artists, economists and psychol
ogists. This multi-disciplinary focus
attempts to address all aspects of
space life. A new humanities program
will begin in 1992.
The inclusion of these topics allows
the program to "complement the
existing education infrastructure in
this country and elsewhere .. . (by)
adding a new element that hasn't
been there before," according to Burt
Lee, a mechanical engineering gradu
ate student. Lee, a graduate of the
ISU class of 1988, taught in last year's
program.
Despite all the excitement and
enthusiasm, working on an interna

tional basis does come with its own
problems. School-of-thought and cul
tural differences have created friction
in programs past.
According to Jeannie Flynn, an
aeronautical engineering graduate
student, these difficulties created
obstacles for the various task groups
involved in this summer's Mars Mis
sion project. According to Flynn, a
debate over the use of artificial gravi
ty divided American and Soviet partic
ipants. Another area of conflict
involved the question of whether to
use nuclear-powered space craft or
more traditional rocket fuels.
Although its Mars Mission may not
come to life in the immediate future,
ISU is using this and past projects to
provide existing worldwide space pro
grams with credible and new alterna
tives and ideas to further space explo
ration.
Sometime in the next 30 years, ISU
hopes to use and develop projects from
campuses in orbit or on the moon.
"We wish to lead in the interna
tional aspects of the development of
space," says Brice.
For now, ISU's short-term goal is
the establishment of a permanent
campus somewhere on earth so a
year-round program can be operating
by the mid-19905. So far, ISU summer
sessions have been held in Mas
sachusetts, France and Canada. Next
summer's program is planned for
Kitakyushu, Japan.
Closer to home, this year Merrihew
is a teacher's assistant for a similar
program on the Stanford campus. The
two-quarter course, E235 Space Sys
tems Engineering, is taught by Bruce
Lusignan during winter and spring
quarters. Last year's class wrote a
Mars Mission similar to ISU's.
This year they will be using their
project and "analyzing U.S. and Sovi
et policy (to) see what would be the
consequence of a negotiated joint pro
ject," according to Lusignan. At the
end of the year, the U.S. Space Coun
cil has asked to be briefed on the find
ings of Stanford's analysis.
Like the ISU program, E235 will
include lectures from space-program
professionals, U.S. astronauts and
Soviet cosmonauts.
The deadline for submitting ISU
applications is Jan. 15, 1992. More
information can be obtained by writ
ing to 955 Massachusetts Avenue, 7th
Floor, Cambridge, MA 02139, or by

been there before," according to Burt
Lee, a mechanical engineering gradu
ate student. Lee, a graduate of the
ISU class of 1988, taught in last year's
program.
Despite all the excitement and
enthusiasm, working on an interna

tional basis does come with its own
problems. School-of-thought and cul
tural differences have created friction
in programs past.
According to Jeannie Flynn, an
aeronautical engineering graduate
student, these difficulties created
obstacles for the various task groups
involved in this summer's Mars Mis
sion project. According to Flynn, a
debate over the use of artificial gravi
ty divided American and Soviet partic
ipants. Another area of conflict
involved the question of whether to
use nuclear-powered space craft or
more traditional rocket fuels.
Although its Mars Mission may not
come to life in the immediate future,
ISU is using this and past projects to
provide existing worldwide space pro
grams with credible and new alterna
tives and ideas to further space explo
ration.
Sometime in the next 30 years, ISU
hopes to use and develop projects from
campuses in orbit or on the moon.
"We wish to lead in the interna
tional aspects of the development of
space," says Brice.
For now, ISU's short-term goal is
the establishment of a permanent
campus somewhere on earth so a
year-round program can be operating
by the mid-19905. So far, ISU summer
sessions have been held in Mas
sachusetts, France and Canada. Next
summer's program is planned for
Kitakyushu, Japan.
Closer to home, this year Merrihew
is a teacher's assistant for a similar
program on the Stanford campus. The
two-quarter course, E235 Space Sys
tems Engineering, is taught by Bruce
Lusignan during winter and spring
quarters. Last year's class wrote a
Mars Mission similar to ISU's.
This year they will be using their
project and "analyzing U.S. and Sovi
et policy (to) see what would be the
consequence of a negotiated joint pro
ject," according to Lusignan. At the
end of the year, the U.S. Space Coun
cil has asked to be briefed on the find
ings of Stanford's analysis.
Like the ISU program, E235 will
include lectures from space-program
professionals, U.S. astronauts and
Soviet cosmonauts.
The deadline for submitting ISU
applications is Jan. 15, 1992. More

Graduate student Burt Lee discusses International Space University life with Jeannie Flynn, Dan Kraft and Steve
Merrihew. All four Stanford graduate students attended this summer's ISU program in Toulouse, France.
Imagine going to classes every day
at a university in outer space. Your
interplanetary travels could take you
to Mars, or even the moon. This
dream may soon come true for stu
dents who will attend International
Space University (ISU) in the years to
come.
ISU was launched four years ago at
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Currently, ISU offers an
intensive 10-week, multi-disciplinary
space curriculum each summer.
Until now, students could basically
only read books to learn about space
travel.
But ISU students will no longer
have to rely only on books. ISU facul
ty and guest speakers include U.S.
astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts, in
addition to space program profession
als from around the world.
Each year, ISU accepts about 130
graduate students and young profes
sionals from 30 countries. The pro
gram aims to "raise (students') aca
demic standards and give them a
broad-base understanding of all the
different disciplines that are involved
in space exploration," according to

ISU Assistant Academic Coordinator
Jim Brice.
Four Stanford University students
participated in last summer's ISU
program in Toulouse, France. These
four agree the networking and the
international exposure to various
philosophies and technologies were
the overwhelmingly invaluable fea
tures of the program.
"The fact that this brings so many
people together is what really makes it
special," said ISU graduate Steve
Merrihew. Merrihew is in the aero
nautical engineering Ph.D. program
at Stanford.
Daniel Kraft, a second-year medical
student at Stanford, emphasized the
importance of networking. "You get to
meet fantastic people from all over the
world that hopefully you'll get to work
with some day,"he said.
Kraft is already planning to
address the medical school on the
topic of space medicine and physiolo
gy. In addition, next summer he plans
to do research on cardiovascular pre
conditioning at NASA Ames Research
Center and Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.
Kraft hopes one day to utilize his
medical training in space. While he

realizes there isn't a single route to
becoming an astronaut, he is "keeping
an open mind."
Attending ISU may very well be
one route to a career in space. Accord
ing to Brice, there is an ISU graduate
who has recently been selected to
become a U.S. astronaut. More ISU
graduates, including a British stu
dent, are in the running.
Luckily for Kraft and interested
others, the program's fields of study
are not limited to engineering and
satellite applications.
Students include lawyers, archi
tects, artists, economists and psychol
ogists. This multi-disciplinary focus
attempts to address all aspects of
space life. A new humanities program
will begin in 1992.
The inclusion of these topics allows
the program to "complement the
existing education infrastructure in
this country and elsewhere .. . (by)
adding a new element that hasn't
been there before," according to Burt
Lee, a mechanical engineering gradu
ate student. Lee, a graduate of the
ISU class of 1988, taught in last year's
