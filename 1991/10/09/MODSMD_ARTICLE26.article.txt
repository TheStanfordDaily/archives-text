Dads' coke may harm babies
Male cocaine use may be a factor in abnor
mal fetal development, according to a study
published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
"Sperm may act as vectors to transport
cocaine into an ovum," according to Dr. Ricar
do Yazigi of Washington University in St.
Louis.
Yazigi and his colleagues incubated sperm
specimens with cocaine solutions and found
cocaine does bind to human sperm. They found
no evidence that cocaine affects sperm motility
or viability.
Past research has explored developmental
abnormalities in cocaine users' offspring; how
ever, most investigations have focused on
cocaine-using mothers. This new study sug
gests cocaine use by fathers may also be a large
source of fetal abnormalities.
