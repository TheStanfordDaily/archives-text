## Comebacks keep women on top No. 1 Stanford clinches win over No. 2 Pacific in four games 
### George Malone Staff writer 
When it comes to clutch time there may be no better team
than the Stanford women's volleyball squad.
The undefeated Cardinal beat the University of Pacific
Tigers in Stockton last night in a four game thriller, coming
back from huge deficits in the last two games to win 15-9, 14-
16, 16-14, 17-15.
Both undefeated teams came into the match ranked No. 1

es' polls, while Pacific was No. 1 in the NCAA poll.
"It was interesting coming in and wondering how we'd
match up. Beating an undefeated team is always great," said
senior Bev Oden.
The match, played in front of 4,122 mostly hostile fans,
was characterized by the streaky play of both teams.
"We played tenatively at times and great at other times,"
said senior Nicole Appleman. Appleman hit 1292 for the
match and had 12 kills.
"They were streaky like we were," said coach Don Shaw.
UOP never lead in the first game as the Cardinal forced
several Tiger errors and served well. There were incredible
rallies on many points, with both teams making great saves,
but Stanford's hitting simply overpowered the Tiger defense.
Pacific was more consistent in game two, while Stanford
made mental errors and served poorly. The Tigers leaped out
to a 14-8 lead, but the Cardinal made an incredible comeback.
Senior Kristin Klein had three sensational hits to lead
Stanford back to a 14-14 tie. The Cardinal, however, could
not complete the comeback and Pacific pulled out the win.
Game three was almost the same story. Pacific hit well and
Stanford started out passing poorly. The game was full of
long rallies and the Cardinal fell behind 12-8 before beginning
another scintillating comeback.
Behind the clutch hitting of Klein, Appleman and All-
American Oden, Stanford rallied back to win the game and
turn the momentum its way for good.
"We have streaked. I guess we liked the pressure. When it
was 13-13, we were sure we'd win," said junior setter Carrie
Feldman.
Once again in game four the Cardinal dug itself a hole at
11-6 before pulling together behind senior Jennifer Jackson's
strong hitting.
The Cardinal almost gave the game away as Pacific moved
ahead at 15-14, but Stanford's digging and blocking prevent

'This team has great competitive
spirit. We're capable of going out
and hammering any team in the
country if we play our game. We
didn't play very well, but the good
news is that we weren't at our
best and we beat them,'

Ed the Tigers from winning, and two big blocks finished out
the match for the Cardinal.
"I think we felt we had the upper hand during the match,"
Shaw said.
"We didn't ever feel out of control because we were the
ones who made the mistakes," said junior Kristi Paaso. Paaso
had her best night of the season, playing in three games and
hitting .455.
Stanford did not have its best night statistically, but cer
tain individual performances were outstanding. Klein hit .229
with 24 kills on a career-high 70 attacks. She also added 22
digs, three aces and five blocks for the Cardinal.
Oden added 11 blocks and 19 kills while hitting .325 for the
team.
But it wasn't just the Big Three who saw all the action.
Sophomores Piper Hahn and Heidi Eick each added to the
win as well. Eick hit .333 for the Cardinal in game two.
Although Stanford tallied up 33 blocks and 82 kills, the
most kills in one match this season, UOP managed to outhit
and outdig the Cardinal.
Despite defeating a top-ranked team on the road, the Stan
ford players were not overjoyed with the win.
"I don't think we were playing smart. It didn't feel like a
good, clean win," Feldman said.
Teammate Paaso was also dissatisfied. "I think we realized
that we have alot to improve on," she said.
Coach Shaw was a little more upbeat. "This team has great
competitive spirit. We're capable of going out and hammering
any team in the country if we play our game. We didn't play
very well, but the good news is that we weren't at our best and
we beat them," Shaw said.
Stanford plays at home this weekend against Pacific 10
foes Oregon and Oregon State. Going into last night's match
es Oregon was 11-7 overall (1-5 in Pac-10 play). Oregon State
was 8-10 overall and 1-5 in the Pac-10. Both teams should
provide a bit of a challenge for the high-flying Cardinal.

Pacific was more consistent in game two, while Stanford
made mental errors and served poorly. The Tigers leaped out
to a 14-8 lead, but the Cardinal made an incredible comeback.
Senior Kristin Klein had three sensational hits to lead
Stanford back to a 14-14 tie. The Cardinal, however, could
not complete the comeback and Pacific pulled out the win.
Game three was almost the same story. Pacific hit well and
Stanford started out passing poorly. The game was full of
long rallies and the Cardinal fell behind 12-8 before beginning
another scintillating comeback.
Behind the clutch hitting of Klein, Appleman and All-
American Oden, Stanford rallied back to win the game and
turn the momentum its way for good.
"We have streaked. I guess we liked the pressure. When it
was 13-13, we were sure we'd win," said junior setter Carrie
Feldman.
Once again in game four the Cardinal dug itself a hole at
11-6 before pulling together behind senior Jennifer Jackson's
strong hitting.
The Cardinal almost gave the game away as Pacific moved
ahead at 15-14, but Stanford's digging and blocking prevent

'This team has great competitive
spirit. We're capable of going out
and hammering any team in the

didn't play very well, but the good
news is that we weren't at our
best and we beat them,'

Ed the Tigers from winning, and two big blocks finished out
the match for the Cardinal.
"I think we felt we had the upper hand during the match,"
Shaw said.
"We didn't ever feel out of control because we were the
ones who made the mistakes," said junior Kristi Paaso. Paaso
had her best night of the season, playing in three games and
hitting .455.
Stanford did not have its best night statistically, but cer
tain individual performances were outstanding. Klein hit .229
with 24 kills on a career-high 70 attacks. She also added 22
digs, three aces and five blocks for the Cardinal.
Oden added 11 blocks and 19 kills while hitting .325 for the
team.
But it wasn't just the Big Three who saw all the action.
Sophomores Piper Hahn and Heidi Eick each added to the
win as well. Eick hit .333 for the Cardinal in game two.
Although Stanford tallied up 33 blocks and 82 kills, the
most kills in one match this season, UOP managed to outhit
and outdig the Cardinal.
Despite defeating a top-ranked team on the road, the Stan
ford players were not overjoyed with the win.
"I don't think we were playing smart. It didn't feel like a
good, clean win," Feldman said.
Teammate Paaso was also dissatisfied. "I think we realized
that we have alot to improve on," she said.
Coach Shaw was a little more upbeat. "This team has great
competitive spirit. We're capable of going out and hammering
any team in the country if we play our game. We didn't play
very well, but the good news is that we weren't at our best and
we beat them," Shaw said.
Stanford plays at home this weekend against Pacific 10
foes Oregon and Oregon State. Going into last night's match
es Oregon was 11-7 overall (1-5 in Pac-10 play). Oregon State
was 8-10 overall and 1-5 in the Pac-10. Both teams should
provide a bit of a challenge for the high-flying Cardinal.
