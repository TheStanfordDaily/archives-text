# Denney sees team come full-circle
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
Can a broken ankle be a good
thing?
When Cardinal midfielder
Denise Denney had to sit out her
junior soccer season because of
injury, she couldn't have thought
much good would come of the situ
ation.
How wrong she was. Because
she redshirted for the 1989 season,
the fiflh-year senior is spending
her final year of eligibility playing
for a team with serious designs on
the NCAA title.
The freak accident responsible
for keeping Denney in a Stanford
uniform for the 1991 season actu
ally happened during the Seattle
native's freshman year. Actually,
Denney just missed escaping her
first year on the farm unscathed.
"I broke my ankle in the last

five minutes of the last practice
spring of my freshman year," Den
ney said. "I played on it sophomore
year, but it got too painful to play
on."
Denney has seen the team rise
from the 4-11-4 squad that it was
four years ago to an undefeated
team today. In addition to the
improved quality of players, she
has seen Stanford's style of play
change dramatically.
"We used to be a defensive-ori
ented team," Denney said. "We
had five fullbacks, and we basically
just tried to keep the ball out of our
net and hope we could score on a
breakaway or something. We
would just send Jen (Rowland, for
mer star scorer for the Cardinal)
out there, and hope she could put
one in."
Those days are gone; in fact,
things have come full-circle to the
point where other teams are forced

to do the same thing in order to
stop the potent Stanford attack.
National attention was not
what Denney expected when she
first came to the Farm. The soccer
program here had little to do with
her decision to attend Stanford,
and she expected soccer to become
more of a hobby than anything
else.
"I came here for academics,"
Denney said. "Now, it's very easy
for good players to make the deci
sion to come here, but the soccer
program was not nearly as strong
when I was a freshman as it is now.
"I never thought that I would be
on a team with Final Four possibil
ities."
One thing that the 1991 team
has in common with its 1987 coun
terpart is its fighting spirit, which
Denney feels was gone to some
extent during the three years in
between.
"Against Santa Barbara (a game
won by Stanford earlier this year),
a player came up to me aider the
game and said, 'You guys are the
dirtiest players I've ever seen!"'
Denney recalled. "That wasn't
true, of course, but we were really
slide-tackling well and played a
tough game.
"My freshman year, we played
like that, but in the past few years,
I don't think we played as hard as
we are now," Denney went on. "We
didn't get our uniforms dirty. .
.we've got a lot of our fight back
this year."
Denney is quick to credit soccer
coach Andeberhan for her and the
team's improvement during her
Stanford career.
"Berhane molds players
extremely well," Denney said. "He
can turn good players into great
ones."
Denney must surely fit under
the "great" category, as praise for
Denney runs rampant among her
teammates. "She's one of the
toughest-fighting midfielders we
have," captain Heather Mclntyre
said of her teammate.
"She's also a stabilizing influ
ence on the field. She's a great
playmaker as well as a fighter."
Although it is easy for Denney's
teammates to reel off lists of her
strengths as a soccer player, the
task is much more difficult for Den
ney herself. When asked to name
her forte as a soccer player, after a
long pause she pointed to her
rather modest total of two goals for
the season and sarcastically said, "I
guess it's that I'm such a scoring
threat for 90 minutes each and
every game."
Even on a team with humility as
one of its trademarks, Denney
stands out, both on the field and
off.
