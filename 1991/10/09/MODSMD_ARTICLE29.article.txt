# All right now
## Academics set Stanford apart 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon, the California
Golden Bears (4-0) beat UCLA in the Rose
Bowl and in so doing became one of the top
15 teams in college football. Last Saturday
evening, the Stanford Cardinal (1-3) was crushed
by visiting Notre Dame and in so doing lost
almost any chance of being in the top 15 this year.
You know what—l think we're better off.
I don't want Stanford to have a nationally
ranked football team. Sure that sounds like sour

grapes, but I really don't
think the ends would
justify the means —we
might have to give up
too much.
First to go, I'm afraid,
would be our academic
integrity. Although we
may wish it were other
wise, we have to accept

that the vast majority of
the nation's blue chip high school recruits don't
stay up late at night studying physics or history.
True, a few do, and hopefully we could convince
those outstanding individuals to come to Stan
ford.
But these few players wouldn't be enough to
keep us on par with the Clemson's and USC's of
the world, who because of their lower academic
standards can snag a larger crop of better talent.
So what can we do, if we really want to be a
perennial force in college football? For one, we

can lower our academic
standards, as Cal appar
ently did when they
accepted Heisman Tro
phy candidate Russell
White.
White is a running
back of incredible talent
and is largely responsi
ble for the resurgence of
Cal's football program.
He supposedly is also
doing quite well in the

classroom. 1 do not ques
tion his personal integri
ty; I question how he could get into Cal with
SAT's under 700.
Cal is a top-flight, nationally recognized uni
versity and it may very well be the second best
university in the state of California. As such it
had no business accepting a Prop. 48 player,
regardless of any extenuating circumstances.
Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford is
willing to make?
So what else can we do, if we really want to be
a perennial force in college football? Well, we can
build up the athletes that we manage to recruit
with steroids and other performance enhancing
drugs, the use of which will slowly kill these
young men.
South Carolina was a small-time football pro
gram well on its way to establishing itself as a
perennial force when a Sports Illustrated article
written by a former player detailed the extensive
steroid use on the team. Suddenly the program
was awash in controversy, the coach vanished and
the team fell back into the ranks of the mediocre.

We have to accept that the
vast majority of the nation's
blue chip high school
recruits don't stay up late at

history

Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford is
willing to make?.
So what else can we do, if we really want to be
a perennial force in college football? We can offer
players financial incentives, in hopes of enticing
more players who qualify academically to choose
the Farm.
This university is in dire financial straits, and
whole academic departments may be cut. Financial
aid may be chopped so much that some students

who are halfway to get
ting their Stanford
degrees may not be able
to finish school because
they can't afford it. But
some recruits may
want guarantees of
cars, money or scooters
before they are willing
to commit to coming to
the Farm.

Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford is
willing to make?
So what else can we do, if we really want to be
a perennial force in college football? We can
schedule three cream puff non-conference oppo
nents, beat them all 56-0, and get three cheap
wins. Cal's first two wins this year were against
those giants of college football, Pacific and Pur
due. And Nebraska's been beating up on Doormat
U. for years in order to get into bowl games that
they lose. It all sounds very sportmanslike, don't
you think?

Is this the kind
of sacrifice that Stan
ford is willing to make?
There must be
something else that we
can we do, if we really
want to be a perennial
force in college football.
How about having
cheerleaders and a
pseudo-fascist band
instead of those irrev
erent and annoying

troublemakers that
currently perform at halftime? Wait a minute —
someone please remind me how will this help us
win football games?
Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford even
needs to make?
Dennis Green may or may not be satisfied with
my limited expectations for the football program.
He may want to win more than five or six games a
year, he may want to go to a bowl every year and he
may want to be able to beat a Colorado or a Notre
Dame and have it not be considered a big upset.
Perhaps he should want those things—he may very
well lose his job if the team does not win more than
it has in the past.
But knowing the sacrifices that a program may
have to make in order to be a perennial power in
college football, does Stanford really want to be
one?
I think that things are all right now.

15 teams in college football. Last Saturday
evening, the Stanford Cardinal (1-3) was crushed
by visiting Notre Dame and in so doing lost
almost any chance of being in the top 15 this year.
You know what—l think we're better off.
I don't want Stanford to have a nationally
ranked football team. Sure that sounds like sour

grapes, but I really don't
think the ends would
justify the means —we
might have to give up
too much.
First to go, I'm afraid,
would be our academic
integrity. Although we
may wish it were other
wise, we have to accept

that the vast majority of
the nation's blue chip high school recruits don't
stay up late at night studying physics or history.
True, a few do, and hopefully we could convince
those outstanding individuals to come to Stan
ford.
But these few players wouldn't be enough to
keep us on par with the Clemson's and USC's of
the world, who because of their lower academic
standards can snag a larger crop of better talent.
So what can we do, if we really want to be a
perennial force in college football? For one, we

can lower our academic
standards, as Cal appar
ently did when they
accepted Heisman Tro
phy candidate Russell
White.
White is a running
back of incredible talent
and is largely responsi
ble for the resurgence of
Cal's football program.
He supposedly is also
doing quite well in the

classroom. 1 do not ques
tion his personal integri
ty; I question how he could get into Cal with
SAT's under 700.
Cal is a top-flight, nationally recognized uni
versity and it may very well be the second best
university in the state of California. As such it
had no business accepting a Prop. 48 player,
regardless of any extenuating circumstances.
Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford is
willing to make?
So what else can we do, if we really want to be
a perennial force in college football? Well, we can
build up the athletes that we manage to recruit
with steroids and other performance enhancing
drugs, the use of which will slowly kill these
young men.
South Carolina was a small-time football pro
gram well on its way to establishing itself as a
perennial force when a Sports Illustrated article
written by a former player detailed the extensive
steroid use on the team. Suddenly the program
was awash in controversy, the coach vanished and
the team fell back into the ranks of the mediocre.

We have to accept that the
vast majority of the nation's
blue chip high school
recruits don't stay up late at
night studying physics or
history

Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford is
willing to make?.
So what else can we do, if we really want to be
a perennial force in college football? We can offer
players financial incentives, in hopes of enticing
more players who qualify academically to choose
the Farm.
This university is in dire financial straits, and
whole academic departments may be cut. Financial
aid may be chopped so much that some students

who are halfway to get
ting their Stanford
degrees may not be able
to finish school because
they can't afford it. But
some recruits may
want guarantees of
cars, money or scooters
before they are willing
to commit to coming to
the Farm.

Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford is
willing to make?
So what else can we do, if we really want to be
a perennial force in college football? We can
schedule three cream puff non-conference oppo
nents, beat them all 56-0, and get three cheap
wins. Cal's first two wins this year were against
those giants of college football, Pacific and Pur
due. And Nebraska's been beating up on Doormat
U. for years in order to get into bowl games that
they lose. It all sounds very sportmanslike, don't
you think?

Is this the kind
of sacrifice that Stan
ford is willing to make?
There must be
something else that we
can we do, if we really
want to be a perennial
force in college football.
How about having
cheerleaders and a
pseudo-fascist band
instead of those irrev
erent and annoying

troublemakers that
currently perform at halftime? Wait a minute —
someone please remind me how will this help us
win football games?
Is this the kind of sacrifice that Stanford even
needs to make?
Dennis Green may or may not be satisfied with
my limited expectations for the football program.
He may want to win more than five or six games a
year, he may want to go to a bowl every year and he
may want to be able to beat a Colorado or a Notre
Dame and have it not be considered a big upset.
Perhaps he should want those things—he may very
well lose his job if the team does not win more than
it has in the past.
But knowing the sacrifices that a program may
have to make in order to be a perennial power in
college football, does Stanford really want to be
one?
I think that things are all right now.
