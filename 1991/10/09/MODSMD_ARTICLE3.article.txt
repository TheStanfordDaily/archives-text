# On the front line Soviet visitors give firsthand accounts of failed coup

Lyudmila Mikhailovna Zonova
and her husband were returning
home to Moscow from their coun
try house when they noticed the
tanks sharing the highway with
them.
The prominent Soviet econ
omist, who quit the Communist
party last year, turned to her hus
band and said, "This evening we will
be in a concentration camp, proba
bly."
It was the morning of Aug. 19,
and Zonova was witnessing the
beginning of the unsuccessful
three-day putsch in the Soviet
Union.
Zonova, who served as an advi
sor to Alexander Yakovlev, the
economist who designed perestroi
ka, recounted her vivid impres
sions of the events yesterday
afternoon at Bechtel Interna
tional Center. She is lecturing in
California on a five-week ex
change program.
Her fellow Muscovite Sergei
Goncharov, a visiting scholar at
Stanford's International Security

and Arms Control Center, also
gave a firsthand account of the
failed coup.
Zonova and Goncharov both
spent three charged and volatile
days protesting the coup. Zonova,
who lives close to the "White
House" — the seat of the Russian
parliament — practically stum
bled upon the revolution.
After arriving home, Zonova
said she and her husband went
out to buy bread. Along the way,
she encountered tanks heading
toward the parliament.
"I stopped to talk to them," she
recounted. "Many were from the
South Asian republics, and it was
hard to talk to them because they
didn't understand much Russ
ian."
Zonova appealed to the young
soldiers. "I'm like your mother,"
the attractive woman in her late
50s told them. "Could you shoot
at me?"
Zonova tried to explain the
political situation to the soldiers,
who she believes did not under
stand. "They were fooled," she
said, her tone more sympathetic
than angry.

Outside the White House,
Zonova joined the approximate
ly 100 people standing around
Boris Yeltsin. She listened to
the Russian president issue his
first decree, calling for a gener
al strike and ordering the crowd
to hang a poster in every sub
way.
After her action-packed de
tour, Zonova finally reached the
bread shop, where she informed
people of what had happened.
"People shouted at me for
spreading rumors," Zonova re
called. They were mainly from
suburban Moscow and had no
idea of what was taking place, she
explained.
While Zonova was standing by
tanks educating potential democ
racy-quashing soldiers, Goncha
rov was still not aware that any
thing had happened. When he
turned on Moscow Echo, an inde
pendent radio program, he could
not believe it — the radio was
silent.
"I had the feeling of being
totally lost," Goncharov said. "All
of my information was cut off,
and that makes you feel kind of
scared."
Goncharov refused to be
called a hero for his participa
tion in the resistance, saying,
"I got quite drunk during the
first day." The turning point
was when a friend told him
that many people were protest
ing at the White House.
The following day, he joined
the protesters at a big meeting.
"It was the most important
feeling," he recalled. "At least
you knew you were not alone."
As people constructed a bar
ricade, made mainly of garbage
and scrap metal off the streets,
the atmosphere became "unre
al," Goncharov explained.
Rumors billowed through
the crowd: the generals would
attack, it would be another
Tienanmen Square, the tanks

would roll through the demon
stration at 4 p.m. Goncharov
spent many hours nervously
puffing on cigarettes until 10
p.m., when he heard someone
scream that the tank drivers
were "on the side of the people,
everything is okay."
The following day the atmo
sphere was much more
relaxed, as it became increas
ingly clear the putsch had
failed, recalled Goncharov. On
Aug. 22, a celebration was
declared, but Goncharov was
too exhausted to attend.
"The events gave rise to not
only hope, but also distress,"
Goncharov said, adding that
profound economic reforms
are necessary to overcome the
impasse that set in after the
coup.
Zonova insisted that, as
winter approaches, Russia
should not take drastic mea
sures, but should concentrate
on insuring that Russians con
tinue to have the basics —
food, medicine, and electricity.


Sergei Goncharov, a visiting scholar at the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control, and Soviet economist
Lyudmila Zonova recall the failed Soviet coup. They spoke
yesterday at the Bechtel International Center.
