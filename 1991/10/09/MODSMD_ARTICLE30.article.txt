Huskies 0

The Huskies knocked Stanford
out of NCAA Tournament con
tention last year with a 3-1 victory
in Seattle, so yesterday's home
win was sweet revenge for the
Cardinal. Stanford is now 7-2-3.
"It was a great win," goalie
Kyle Krpata said. "Washington
pretty much ended our season last
year, and they've been on a roll

lately."
The game remained scoreless
for almost 30 minutes. At the
29:05 mark, junior Jim Talluto
tallied his team-leading eighth
goal, scoring on the rebound from
a Lance Killian shot.
Midway through the second
half, freshman Ryan Collins made
the score 2-0, converting a break
away. The goal was the seventh of
the season for Collins and his fifth
in the last five games.
"Ryan Collins played an excel
lent game," assistant coach Greg
Petersen said. "He played like he
has been playing all year."
Krpata had another stellar per
formance in goal, although, in his
own words, "I didn't have to do
much out there today." Indeed,
Washington was overmatched by
the Cardinal defense, getting off
only five shots all game. Krpata
recorded his second straight
shutout and third on the year. His
goals against average is now 1.06
per game.

With the loss, Washington (4-
5-0) continued its steady slip from
NCAA contention. Since the
Huskies' victory over defending
national champion UCLA two
weeks ago, the team has lost three
straight games. The frustration
from those losses was evident yes
terday, as Washington committed
27 fouls (Stanford had 10), and
picked up several yellow cards.
Stanford is a solid 7-1-1 in its
last nine games, and moved up to
No. 7 in the latest NCAA poll of
the Division I West region. It's not
like the Cardinal has been facing
patsies, either. Yesterday's game
marked the sixth time this year
that Stanford has faced a team
which has, at some point, been
ranked in the top 20.
Despite the team's recent suc
cess, Petersen would register only
cautious optimism in his outlook
on the second half of the season.
"(Yesterday's) win will not hurt
us," he said, "But we've still got a
way to go."
