# Other universities look to Stanford for policy advice

### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
In the wake of Stanford's
implementation of the domestic
partner policy, many other uni
versities are working to start or
solidify policies of their own.
William Georges, acting
director of the Stanford Hous
ing Center, said his office has
been receiving a great deal of
calls from other universities
about Stanford's policy.
In particular, the University
of Michigan, the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, the Uni
versity of Chicago and Ohio
University have been calling
for advice, Georges said.
Joe Burke, the director of
residential life at Ohio Univer
sity, said his office is still gath
ering information in order to
design its policy.
"We're looking to get same
sex couples recognized and pro
vide them with medical insur
ances, class attendance privi
leges and housing," Burke said.
His office hopes to have its

plan in place by fall 1992.
In Madison, Wis., a city ordi
nance allows same-sex and
opposite-sex couples to register
in a manner similar to mar
riage.
Kacey Jordan, who works in
the housing office at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, said that
if students have registered
under the Madison ordinance
they are entitled to live in mar
ried student housing.
Public outcry at the initia
tion of the policy was wide
spread, Jordan said, but she
added that most of the reaction
came from outside the universi
ty.
"The university community
itself, about 46,000 people, has
been accepting of the policy,"
she said.
Harvard University has had
its own policy in place for two
years, Georges said.
A Cambridge housing ordi
nance allows domestic partners
to make use of the rental prop
erties that Harvard offers to
families and couples.
