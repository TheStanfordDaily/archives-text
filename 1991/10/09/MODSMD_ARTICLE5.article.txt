# Senate approves budget guidelines
## Passage follows long bickering bout 
### Howard Libit Connie Lo 
The ASSU Senate managed to
approve a set of budget guidelines
amid more than two hours of
bickering at last night's meeting.
The list of priorities are
intended to guide the University
Cabinet as it sets budget-reduc
tion targets for schools and
administrative areas next week in
the process of slashing more than
$40 million from the permanent
operating budget.
"I would hope that the admin
istration will look at these recom
mendations," said graduate sena
tor Larry Augustin. "When they
have to make choices, this will tell
them what to make."
Completed over the weekend,
the guidelines were discussed at a
poorly attended student town
meeting Monday night. The
Council of Presidents made sever
al small changes in response to
student suggestions.
But when the senate got its
hands on the recommendations
and temporarily lifted its formal
parliamentary rules, chaos was
the result.
Amendments were tossed back

and forth as many senators
worked to include their own area
of interest.
For instance, graduate sena
tors spent about 30 minutes find
ing a way to support increased
graduate housing — an action
that would increase University
spending and is not even a part of
the operating budget.
Also included in the recom
mendations was a statement sup
porting disability access in build
ings under construction, a one
time expense that would not
affect permanent budget cuts.
Some members of the ASSU
defended the inclusion of state
ments unrelated to reducing the
budget.
"There are things that do not
directly affect the operating bud
get, but they are important to
include because they are a priori
ty of students," said COP mem
ber Beth Morgan.
Some senators who spent
much of the weekend writing the
ASSU recommendations said
they were upset the senate was
trying to pick them apart.
"Many people here were not at
the different town meetings and
discussions over the weekend,"
said senator Jason Snyder. "It
would be good if we had more
time to consider these proposals
and have a complete, informed
debate."
In the end, few changes of real
substance were made to the pro
posal. "So far as I am concerned,
no mfyor changes have occurred,"

said COP member John Overdeck.
Before the senate began its
budget discussion, it quickly
passed two bills on student partic
ipation on the presidential search
committee.
Members passed a bill that
strongly urged the Board of
Trustees to select at least two stu
dents — one undergraduate and
one graduate — to serve on the
committee instead of only one.
"One student. . . does not real
ly give the students the represen
tation they deserve," said senate
chair Kevin Warsh.

The senate also nominated
three students for the selection
committee — Kasi Fuller, Derek
Miyahara and John Overdeck.
The Board of Trustees will select
one student from these nominees
to serve as a voting member.
Nominees were required to be
graduate students with past
undergraduate experience at
Stanford.
Fuller has worked at Stanford
as a resident fellow, Miyahara is
currently a graduate senator and
Overdeck serves as a member of
the COP.
