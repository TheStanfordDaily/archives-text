# The 						marrying man
## Deceased surgeon left three wives 
### Mara Mather Editorial Staff With AP wire reports 
The late Norman Lewiston
achieved an impressive balance of
pioneering research and life-sav
ing surgery as a doctor at Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospi
tal. But Lewiston did not perform
his only balancing act at the hospi
tal.
Lewiston, a respected lung
transplant specialist at the
Stanford Medical School, left
behind three wives when he died
in August.
"The whole thing is totally
incredible, unreal," said Lewis
ton's third wife, Robyn Phelps,
who lives in San Diego County.
"I can't figure out why — or
how — he did it. I truly believe he
loved all three of us, but was inca
pable of letting go of any of the
relationships," she said.
The expert in cystic fibrosis,
who colleagues describe as "shy,"
did not seem like the type to lead
a secret life. Diarmuid McGuire, a
spokesperson for the Children's

Hospital, called him "a very unas
suming individual.
"I think everybody [at the hos
pital] is disheartened by this,"
McGuire said.
"[Lewiston did] very important
work, cared deeply about his
patients and helped establish the
protocols for kids' lung trans
plants. It's because of his work
that some kids are alive,"
McGuire added. "All that is being
overshadowed by his personal
life."
Robyn Phelps, Lewiston's
third wife, had been married to
him for two years when she
learned this summer that her
husband had two other wives. His
other spouses did not discover
their husband's secret until they
both showed up to claim the body
at his autopsy.
"You could have knocked me
over," said Lewiston's second
wife, Katy Lewiston, a Palo Alto
resident. "I lost 12 pounds in
seven davs."
Phelps said she never talked to
Lewiston again after she learned
of his other wives. Her attorney
tried to get an annulment, but
Lewiston died before signing the
agreement.
Lewiston had three children by
Diana Lewiston, who he married
first, but no children with either
of his other wives.
Phelps said Lewiston periodi
cally flew to San Diego to see her,

telling her he stayed at the hospi
tal when he was in Palo Alto. Katy
Lewiston said she thought her
husband went to the San Diego
area to visit physician friends.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Medi
cal School is investigating
whether Lewiston mishandled
some funds as the head of the Cys
tic Fibrosis Clinic, according to
the Associated Press.
The hospital hired auditors to
review Lewiston's financial
records at the institution after dis
covering canceled checks made
out to his wives from a cystic
fibrosis research fund Lewiston

controlled, medical school
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos
said. The audit has not been com
pleted.
McGuire said investigators also
discovered Dr. Lewiston had set
up a private bank account for
some expense funds. But so far,
$30,000 of the $37,000 in that
account has checked out as spent
for legitimate research-related
expenses, McGuire said.
"So far, everything looks like it
was handled above board, but
when you have a case like this
there's reason to be suspicious,"
he said.
