Two Stanford English profes
sors were nominated Monday for
National Book Awards.
The professors, Diane Wood
Middlebrook and Adrienne Rich,
were among 15 finalists announced
at a New York ceremony. Each
joins four other nominees in one of
three categories: Middlebrook in
non-fiction and Rich in poetry.
Middlebrook was nominated for
her controversial book "Anne Sex
ton: A Biography." The book,
which includes tapes of therapy
sessions made by Sexton's psychol
ogist among its background mate

rial, has been at the center of an
argument about psychologist
patient privilege.
Some critics of the book claim it
is improper for Sexton's psychia
trist to have released such infor
mation, even if as in Middlebrook's
case permission was obtained from
Sexton's family.
Rich was nominated for her
book "An Atlas of the Difficult
World: Poems 1988-91." Rich pre
viously won the 1974 National
Book Award for poetry for "Diving
Into The Wreck." This is the first
year since the category was
dropped in 1984 that a prize will be
given for poetry.
Also nominated in the non-fic
tion category were E.J. Dionne Jr.

for "Why Americans Hate Poli
tics," Melissa Fay Greene for
"Praying for Sheetrock," R.W.B.
Lewis for "The Jameses: A Family
Narrative" and Orlando Patterson
for "Freedom."
Other nominees for the poetry
prize are 1980 poetry prize-winner
Philip Levine for "What Work Is,"
Andrew Hudgins for "The Never-
Ending," Linda McCarriston for
"Eva-Mary" and Marilyn Nelson
for "The Homeplace."
Both Middlebrook and Rich
were on tour promoting their
books yesterday and could not be
reached for comment.
The winner in each category
will receive $10,000. Award win
ners will be announced Nov. 20.
