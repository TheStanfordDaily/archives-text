# Cuts require many balancing acts
## Budget crisis forces University to re-examine basic issues 
### Bryan Snyder Staff writer 
The ongoing budget crisis has forced students,
faculty and administrators to re-emphasize long
standing debates on academic priorities.
Issues such as the balance between teaching and
research, the commitment to multiculturalism and
the need for student services have been highlighted.
One long-standing debate — between the relative
emphasis Stanford places on research and teaching
— has continued during the time of budget cuts.
Stanford undergraduates learn from individuals
who conduct work at the forefront of their fields,
and research and education are expected to comple
ment each other, according to Dean of Research
Robert L. Byer.
"Stanford is a research university," Byer said.
"Stanford has gained world-class distinction not
only through its excellence in research but in apply
ing that research to undergraduate education."
Some would tip the balance toward the impor
tance of undergraduate teaching.
"I think [the] number one priority, as it always
has been and should have been in the past, is under
graduate education," said senior Shobhit Arora.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall, a politi
cal science professor, said he believes the University
should encourage a better balance between science
and the humanities.
"I would place a greater emphasis on building our
resources in the humanities and social sciences,"
Marshall said. "As things stand now, Stanford is in
danger of becoming a glorified technological insti
tute." Some individuals advocate a greater emphasis
on teaching in order to avoid increased reliance on
government funds for research.
Ed Molyneaux, a 1980 graduate, said, "I like the

renewed emphases on teaching as opposed to
research. I understand the importance of research,
but I fear the growing dependence on federal money
.. . and the research priorities that come from a
reliance on it."
But others argue that government-sponsored
research helps generate revenue necessary to finance
Stanford's many educational programs and services.
"Research is the bread and butter among
research institutions like Stanford," said law stu
dent Deepak Pai. "One would like to see more money
spent on education, on teaching staff, but the reality
is that all schools such as Stanford have a huge
dependence on research grants to subsidize the edu
cational aspects of the school."
Along with questions of academics, issues of mul
ticulturalism and student services are at the fore
front of budget-cutting debates.
Cynthia King, a first-year law student, said, "It
should continue to be a priority at the Law School
and throughout the University to increase and
maintain the representation of women at 50 percent
and the representation of minorities at 50 percent. I
think it makes for a diverse and intriguing group
with varied perspectives."
George Dekker, an English professor, said that
diversity among students and faculty should com
plement a broad academic curriculum. "The great
trick is to combine range with excellence," he said.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare, who chairs the
Faculty Senate Committee on Education and Schol
arship at Stanford, said the University should "pre
pare students to enter a society in which a mtyority
will belong to different minorities."
Budget allocations for student non-academic ser
vices are also under scrutiny as Stanford decides
how to prioritize programs such as Residential Edu
cation.
