Tibet, Endangered
Humanitas may be located in Palo Alto, but its
concerns for civil liberties reach across the globe,
even into the remote area between China and India.
That mountainous region was invaded by China, its
peaceful ways overwhelmed, its religious traditions
undermined. It's time for a change according to
Haumanitas' Edward Lazarus, a human rights
activist on the Board of the International Committee
for Tibet.

What do you do after you've received your doctorate

written three best sellers, appeared several times on
McNeil-Lehrer? If your name is Joseph
McNamara, you come to share your insights with
the Humanists, as soon as you've returned from a
national publicity tour. Don't worry, he won't tell you
the ending.
