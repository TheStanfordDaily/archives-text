# Violence threatens Yugoslav cease-fire, again
## 
### 
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) — A
Yugoslav army general said
Wednesday that federal forces
would partially withdraw from the
battle-torn republic of Croatia, but
violations threatened the latest
truce between the warring sides.
Zagreb radio reported 17 people
were wounded in a missile attack
on the east Croatian stronghold of
Vukovar, and fierce battles contin
ued about 40 miles south of
Zagreb, capital of Croatia.
But most of the republic was
quiet, on the second day of the most
recent cease-fire in a conflict that
has killed 600 people since Croatia
declared independence June 25.
Seven earlier truces failed.
Dirk-Jan van Houten, the
European Community diplomat
who co-signed the latest truce
between Croatia and the army at
midnight Tuesday, said it was
more likely to hold than previous
accords because it was signed by
soldiers, not politicians.
Gen. Andrija Raseta, who
signed the agreement as deputy
commander of the sth military
district, which covers Croatia,
said federal forces would with
draw from the Adriatic coast and
some barracks in Zagreb.
"For now, we are talking about
a partial withdrawal," said Rase
ta, who said more than 200,000
people were involved in fighting
in Croatia.
He said the EC will supervise
the pullout and that the soldiers
will leave under Croatian Interior
Ministry escort. The general said
future developments depend on
political negotiations among the
republics, held under EC auspices
and due to resume in The Hague
on Thursday.
Croatia wants all federal
troops out. It fears the army, with
its Serb-dominated officers corps,
will help rebel Serb fighters con
solidate control over the one-third
of Croatian territory they hold.
EC spokesman Simon Smits
said the two sides agreed to begin
lifting Croatian blockades of army

barracks and federal blockades of
Croatian coastal cities at 3 p.m.
Wednesday.
Stjepan Adamic, Croatia's
deputy minister of defense report
ed "some movements" to lift the
naval blockade, but defense offi
cials later reported major ports
were still blocked.
The latest truce, retroactive to 6
p.m. Tuesday, was signed by Rase
ta and Col. Imre Agotic, chief of
Croatia's forces. It was agreed to
after the civil war came to the
heart of Zagreb on Monday, when a
missile damaged Croatian govern
ment offices and narrowly missed
republican and federal leaders.
A separate agreement between
city authorities and local army com
manders said federal forces would
withdraw from the Dubrovnik area
by Thursday midnight and both
sides would guarantee safe passage
out for each other's troops.
The army says its recent
assaults were aimed at lifting
blockades affecting 25,000 sol
diers and their families.
Croats blame the war on Ser
bian expansionism. Members of
the ethnic Serb minority say the
fight is to protect them from
absorption into an ultranational
ist, anti-Serb Croatian state.
Croatia and Slovenia declared
independence in tandem June 25
and both moved to implement
their sovereignty on Tuesday
after a three-month EC moratori
um on independence expired.
Under the truce:
• The Croats will lift most army
barracks blockades and the army
will lift blockades, of Adriatic
cities. The army will permit resup
plying of Vukovar and Vinkovci in
Slavonia, an ethnically mixed area
of Croatia.
• The two sides will meet daily
on implementing the pact, to be
honored as long as the interna
tional Yugoslav peace conference
continues in The Hague.
Soldiers can take weapons and
equipment as they leave the bar
racks.
