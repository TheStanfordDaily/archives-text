WASHINGTON (AP) - Clarence
Thomas will "look the American people in
the eye" and deny sexual harassment alle
gations that threaten his Supreme Court
nomination, his chief backer said today.
The woman accusing Thomas pledged coop
eration with a new Senate investigation.
"This is not going to be an easy hear
ing," Judiciary Committee Chairman
Joseph Biden said Tuesday after a day of
drama in which Thomas denied the allega
tions, Democratic support for the nomina
tion eroded and the Senate agreed to a one
week delay of its confirmation vote.
President Bush reaffirmed "my total
confidence" in Thomas today.
Later, the president met for 10 minutes
with his nominee. At one point, they left
the Oval Office to walk around the White

House grounds, deep in conversation.
Afterward, Bush commented, "I'm stay
ing right in there with him, staying right in
there with him."
Thomas smiled at reporters as he and his
wife arrived for the meeting with Bush. The
judge said, "Yup" when asked if he was
going to stick with the confirmation process.
Asked how he felt, Thomas replied, "Fine,
thank you." To a final question on whether
he would be able to refute Anita Hill's accu
sations, Thomas said, "Just testify. Thanks."
It was the first meeting of Bush and
Thomas since the sexual harassment
charges were first aired publicly.
"This is a test for Clarence Thomas,"
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas
said. "It's a test of his character, and I
believe he's up to the test."
