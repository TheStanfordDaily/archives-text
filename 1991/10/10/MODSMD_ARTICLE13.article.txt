A cynic's lighthearted
look at the bleak
budget landscape

THE AXMAN COMETH. And
some people aren't going to be
happy with the bloody trail
he'll leave behind.
Since no one has yet offered specif
ic budget figures, and no one claims
to understand how the numbers
would best be used to make cuts any
way, the following recipe is a starting
point for a discussion grounded in
specifics.
Good sense dictates the following
two criteria for likely lambs to
slaughter:
• Academic irrelevance. Depart
ments that are weak nationally or
on the cutting edge of obsolescence
should step up to the chopping
block; and
• Personality disorder. Some
departments are so broad that they
verge on schizophrenia; other inter
disciplinary programs lack distinct
identity. Surgery is the only cure.
Here's a flock of sheep that
could fit the bill, so to speak.
Modern thought and literature
and comparative literature are fine
in a boom time, but with our
English and foreign language
departments, students have access
to the same material without the
price tag of a fancy title.
Bye-bye human biology, hello
major within the Department of
Biological Sciences. Anyone who
wants to follow the human biology
program can do so within biology.
Anthropology, sociology and lin
guistics should be condensed into
one department.
These three closely related disci
plines would have a much stronger
identity when combined. Consoli
dation would keep the prize faculty
and maintain academic strength,
but scale back administrative costs.
The arts are important, but not
sacrosanct. The Drama Department
should be dismantled and some of

its budget should be given to stu
dent groups. Keeping a creative out
let, especially for students, is cru
cial. By in large, the arts should
remain intact.
Math has always been a night
mare for just about everyone. Now,
it's a waste of money, too.
Various mathematical disciplines
have diverged so much that it would
make more sense for different science
departments that require specific
mathematical knowledge to teach it
as it's needed. For example, discrete
math should be covered by computer
science, and fluid dynamics should be
taught in the engineering school.
We needn't stop there, however.
Industrial engineering and engi
neering-economic systems are too
interdisciplinary to merit indepen
dence. As long as most courses are
still available, as well as suggested
programs of study, students can
design their own majors.
And some general cuts: The sci
ence schools should slice a percent
age from their budgets. Professors at
or near retirement should be encour
aged to step down soon. The profes
sional schools should increase their
enrollment by a small percentage.
Food service should be consoli
dated further. Centralized eating
spaces would be more cost-effec
tive than what exists now.
But consolidating and cutting
aren't enough. We'll have to start
paying for some luxuries.
All physical education classes
should pay for themselves. That's
right. No more free tennis lessons.
Parking fees are next in line for an
increase. Permits should cost $100 to
$300. Some extra revenue could be
diverted to a better shuttle system for
staff, to ease the burden on individuals.
Residence staff in upperclass dorms
is also a luxury. Only theme houses
and dorms with freshmen need it.
Overseas campuses should go
when they are duplicated by foreign
universities' programs.
Cuts will be painful. At this point,
however, it's best for the committees
and individuals to come forth with
specific numbers and stop bleating
for their own pet lambs.
