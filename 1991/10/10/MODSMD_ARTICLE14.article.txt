Wfas the Band's show a result of multiculturalism?

COULD THE STANFORD BAND
please explain why its halftime
show at the Notre Dame game was
conducted by someone dressed as a nun,
energetically shaking a cross up and
down to mark the beat?
Giving Band members the benefit of
the doubt, let's assume they realize that a
cross is not simply two pieces of wood —
one long, one short — affixed to each
other at right angles. At least one person
in that large group must be aware the
cross is also a symbol — the central sym
bol, it so happens, for one of the world's
major religions. "Let's send a nun out
there to offend the Catholics!" the plan
ners must have exclaimed as they clapped
their hands in adolescent glee. "Then
when the nun waves the cross around
like some crazy joystick, that will send

the Christians around the bend whether
they're Catholic or not."
Congratulations, planners, on your
"offensive strategy." While I obviously
can't speak for other Christians, I
thought the Band's actions were inexcus
able. Was this a matter of "just having
fun?"
Some joke. For the Band's informa
tion, the cross was a device used long ago
to torture and kill people. One of many
who died on this device was a man named
Jesus. The cross was not a laughing mat
ter to Jesus, nor is it to those who try to
follow him. 1 am not a Catholic, but I
don't like it when persons who choose the
honorable vocation of nun or priest are
held up to ridicule.
I realize that in these days of acute
multicultural awareness, almost any

thing one does or says has the potential
to give offense to someone else. This
poses a problem: How can we be sensitive
to individuals from other racial, ethnic
and religious communities and relate
"naturally" and unselfconsciously to
these individuals and still have fun?
There is no easy way to resolve this
problem. But we can only make matters
worse if we are not inclusively and con
sistently respectful. The Band has a
hard-earned reputation for offending all
sorts of people with its juvenile antics.
But I cannot imagine it putting on a half
time show making fun of Jews, for exam
ple, or Moslems, or Buddhists. Then why
a show knowingly geared to upset Chris
tians?
The most likely answer is that because
Christianity is the dominant religion in

this country, Christians are (or ought to
be) "strong enough" to live with a little
ridicule.
We could call this the Sliding-Scale
Principle of Cultural Sensitivity: If
you're a member of a large or powerful
group you don't deserve to be treated
with common decency, while if you
belong to a small or weak group you do
have such a right. Is this a principle that
should guide multicultural relations at
Stanford and in the country at large? If
so, we're all in deep, deep trouble.
I may be giving the Band too much
credit, though. The drum major for the
halftime event with Cornell might turn
out to be an exuberant "rabbi" using a
menorah for a baton.
