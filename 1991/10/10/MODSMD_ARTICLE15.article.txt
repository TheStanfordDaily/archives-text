# Band should be more aware what symbols they make fun of
## 
### 
Saturday night I took a dozen friends
to the Notre Dame-Stanford football
game, and I was thoroughly offended by
the sacrilegious halftime spectacle of the
Band's drum major's antics.
Was the "point" that the Band con
siders it weird that the Son of God
would become a man and die for our sal
vation? Or was the "point" that the
Band thought it funny that millions of
women (and men) have forsaken a "nor
mal" life in order to dedicate all their
energies to ministering to the poor and
sick, to teach and to help lead millions to
a closer relationship to their God?
If there was another "point" to be
made, I'm sure that a nonreligious symbol
like the leprechaun Notre Dame uses as a
mascot would have sufficed. But perhaps
they wanted to make the "point" that

freedom of expression, no matter how
obnoxious to some, is the path to follow.
After all, they were only offending
Catholics and other Christians, and they
may not fall into a politically correct cat
egory that merits courtesy.
I could ramble on and on about the
bounds of decency and basic courtesy,
but perhaps none at Stanford would get
my point.
