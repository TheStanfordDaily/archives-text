# Daily coverage unfair to all those involved in Zapata incident
## 
### 
The more Americans try to be fair and
non-sexist, the more hypocritical and
sexist they become. One example is the
media treatment of alleged rape cases —
for example, the Stuart Thomas/Who is
she? incident on this campus.

As soon as the charge was made, The
Daily immediately published Thomas'
name and photograph. The Oct. 8 Daily
carries a typical article beginning, "Stu
art Thomas' case..."
Rape is surely among the most abom
inable crimes and when proven deserves to
be treated accordingly. But all we have so
far is an allegation. The U.S. Constitution
says one is innocent until proven guilty.
It follows that Thomas is still inno
cent, even though he is a man, and
deserves the same consideration as the
woman. Revealing his name forces him
to prove his innocence. Even if he does
so in court, the reality is he will never do
so for many in the community.
If we were really interested in justice
and fair play, either neither party would
be named and pictured before a judg
ment, or both would be. I vote for nei
ther. To publicize one and not the other
is supremely sexist and hypocritical, not
to mention inhumane, whether in The
Daily or The New York Times.
