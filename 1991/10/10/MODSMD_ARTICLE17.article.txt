# Party advertisement racist and destructive

### 
A flier for this weekend's Omega Psi
Phi Jamm '91 party depicted a black man
holding in one hand a sword and in the
other the severed head of a white man.
If this had been reversed, it is obvious
what would have happened: It would
have been universally condemned, it
would have made the front page of The
Daily and the fraternity would have no
doubt been put on probation. But here (I
am only guessing) it is seen as a very PC
expression of rage at white oppressors.
The fact is, however, that racism is
racism. Showing a white man killed by a
black is hardly constructive.
Incidentally, although I find this flier
racist and offensive, I believe in the frater
nity's right to publish it. I simply find it sad
that so many people who should be working
to fight racism are so busy propagating it.
