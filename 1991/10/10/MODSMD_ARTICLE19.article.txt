## Whose truth is 'reality’? 
### 
IN THE BEAUTIFUL FILM "Rash
omon," the Japanese director Akira
Kurasawa retells the classic story of a
nobleman and his bride who spend a spring
afternoon in the woods outside Kyoto.
The couple have the misfortune of
encountering a bandit who rapes the
woman and murders the husband. Or
was the rape a seduction and the murder
a suicide? Kurasawa repeats the tale
three times, letting each of the partici
pants tell their experience of the events.
The four stories bear little similarity
to each other. It is hard to imagine that
the participants shared the same experi
ence. Like a hung jury, we leave the
movie unsure of what truly happened.
I was reminded of "Rashomon" this
week as I read in the papers about Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas and Uni
versity of Oklahoma Law Prof. Anita Hill.
She claims that while working for
Thomas he repeatedly asked her out and
described to her in detail scenes from porno
graphic movies he had seen. Thomas "total
ly and unequivocally" denies the allegations.
Who is telling the truth?
Let's create a Rashomon tale to explore
this question. We can't represent Hill's or
Thomas' true recollections, so the tale is
just a pair of possibilities.
Hill's truth is easier to imagine, for
she has told us more.
Ten years ago she is fresh out of law
school, working as an aide to a fast track

Washington politico. She herself is ambi
tious — eager to please and impress her
new mentor. They work closely and well
together; she is proud he considers her an
excellent lawyer.
Then he asks her to dinner. She is flat
tered — a little amused and only mildly
concerned — and politely declines.
He repeats his invitations and she con
tinues to say no. She begins to feel ner
vous. Could her rebuffs jeopardize her
job? After all he hired her, and he could
fire her. She wonders about his interest in
her. Does he really think she is an excel
lent lawyer? She feels uncomfortable
around him and avoids him at the office.
Then he starts to talk about the
movies. The discussions, soliloquies real
ly, always happen when they are alone in
his office. Her discomfort becomes tinged
with fear. She can't imagine he would
ever do anything; he is an honorable
man. But what if he did?
She feels dirty and sick to her stom
ach. She wants to leave but fears offend
ing or angering him. She tries to change
the topic and waits for the day to end.
Now imagine Thomas' truth.
He is a young lawyer, recently divorced
and quickly becoming a powerful insider
in the new Reagan Washington. His aide,
a go-getter who just graduated from Yale
Law School, is bright, single and pretty
damn cute. He asks her out.
She says no, but he figures she is just

a little shy. Clearly she likes him. Why
else would she work so hard for him,
staying so many late nights when he was
the only other person at the office? One
thing he has learned in life is that persis
tence pays off. He asks her out again.
She still declines, but he feels they are
becoming friendlier nonetheless. How
could they not, considering all the time
they spend together?
Maybe if he tells her a bawdy tale or
two she will lighten up, relax a little. And
if his stories don't excite her, well, at
least she'll feel more like "one of the
boys" — more accepted around the office.
What harm can it do?
"They are men," said U.S. Rep. Nancy
Pelosi; "they can't possibly know what it is
like to receive verbal harassment, harass
ment that is fleeting to the man and last
ing and demeaning to the woman."
Perhaps they can't. Perhaps the
Rashomon tale is wasted on us. Do we
ignore the stories of others only to repeat
our own? Is it our fate to be trapped in
our own singular perspective?
