# #Much leaner and meaner Kennedy offers insights on budget crisis

### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
Stanford will emerge a better
place — "absolutely" — after a
trying time of controversy and
budget cuts, University President
Donald Kennedy said.
"I really think we can," Kennedy
said in an interview with The Daily
yesterday. "That doesn't mean that
we don't have to give things up.
There will be services that are poor
er. There will be things that we do
with less flourish.
"But I hope and believe that we
can come through with a tighter
focus on things that are really
important and a less cluttered
environment in which it is easier
to concentrate."

Kennedy, who on July 29 an
nounced he will resign next
August, said he thinks his deci
sion to step down cleared away a
cloud of uncertainty and will give
the University more focus as it
begins a challenging year.
"I am convinced that uncer
tainty is very corrosive and dam
aging at a time when you're try
ing to make major change,"
Kennedy said. "Uncertainty
about my plans just wouldn't be
appropriate at a moment like
this."
Now that questions about his
future are dispelled, Kennedy will
concentrate on the University's
soul-searching attempt to cut 10
percent from its operating bud
get. The challenge will be to build
a broad consensus among faculty

and students on a vision for the
future of a smaller Stanford.
Budget battle lines
Kennedy said the parochialism
shown by many faculty and stu
dents so far is a natural reaction
to the severity of the budget crisis
— a reaction which, ultimately,
they will have to overcome.
"In every process like this that
I've ever seen, there is a phase in
which people, quite properly,
make the best defense they can
about what is important to
them," he said.
"In the successful processes
they eventually step back and
take a larger view of the institu
tion, and are ultimately prepared
to sacrifice particular interests for
larger interests."
At Stanford, Kennedy said,
"Some people will not meet that
test. Others will. That's what it's
going to require.
"If it's a good process I think
that the community as a whole
will display respect for those peo
ple who put the big picture first
and that there will be a kind of
system of social rewards for insti
tutional interest and some disin
centives for provincial interest."
Kennedy said he doesn't expect
the budget cuts to devastate the
humanities so that sciences and
engineering — which provide
more income in the form of spon
sored research — can be spared.
"What you hope, obviously, is
that within schools that hard
choices will be made intelligently
and that they won't favor broad
fields one over the other," he said.
"Stanford is one of very few
universities in the country that
has both an enormously strong
school of engineering and a strong
school of liberal arts," said
Kennedy.
"I think that's one of the
things that makes Stanford espe
cially exciting," he said. "The
notion of balance and the notion
of having strength in both areas is
very important to us, and I just
can't see us letting it go."
Kennedy described his vision of

the way in which academic excel
lence might be used to guide the
distribution of cuts among aca
demic programs.
Some faculty and students
have worried that a criteria of
outstanding scholarship — or pre
serving Stanford's "steeples of
excellence," as Frederick Terman
described it — would protect tra
ditional scholastic pursuits, in
which Stanford researchers have
a well-established record, at the
expense of the humanities and
innovative interdisciplinary pro
grams.
"The term 'steeples of excel
lence' as it was used by Terman
meant more than just that the
steeple was tall because it repre
sented something very good,"
Kennedy explained.
"Terman meant for the
steeples to be selectively placed so
that they offered good bridges to
interact with other steeples. He
also wanted to pick disciplines
that were important and that had
significant futures.
"It's not nearly enough to put a
label called 'excellence' on some
thing. You have to be thinking
about its prospects for making
major contributions in the
future."
Kennedy said that both the
Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram and Stanford's commitment
to multiculturalism will remain
close to the University's heart,
both in this year's budget cutting
and in Stanford's second century.
"We've heard a lot of messages
from faculty and a lot of messages

from students that the (CIV) pro
gram is vital to this university. In
fact, we didn't need much" per
suasion, Kennedy said.
"The objectives of diversity and
the accomplishment of an envi
ronment in which different cul
tures and different ethnicities are
respected and included is part of
the bedrock of this place — not
the topsoil," he added.
Kennedy acknowledged that a
lack of information makes it diffi
cult for faculty and students to
contribute to the budget-cutting
process.
"I don't know of any easy way
of overcoming it,"he said. "Cer
tainly there's an obligation on us
to put out information that's as
clear as we can make it, to be good
teachers, to explain the budget
situation and make the choices
that we have as clear as possible.
"But there is a certain level
beyond which you can't simplify
this ... at the risk of oversimpli
fying and making the choices
unrealistic," he said.
Even at that level, he added, it
requires "a very significant intel
lectual commitment" in order to
understand the University's bud
gets, costs and operating proce
dures.
"But I have to say that you
have to make that commitment if
you want to be a serious player"
in the budget-cutting process,
Kennedy said.
Indirect costs
In light of the continuing indi
rect-cost controversy, Stanford

must work out its problems with
the federal government, Kennedy
said
"I am deeply concerned about
the status of our relationship with
the government and we are work
ing overtime to improve it."
Kennedy explained that revela
tions of similar accounting prac
tices at other universities have
helped vindicate Stanford.
"We are being helped not only
by the things we are doing and the
commitments we have made but
by the march of history," he said.
"It is being demonstrated that
other institutions in general did
the kind of cost-accounting in the
same way we did.
"There was certainly nothing
venal about it even though it may
have involved some misjudge
ments that we made."
The search for a successor
Kennedy joked that he is
"probably the most ignorant per
son to ask" about candidates for
Stanford's presidency, but did dis
cuss some of the qualities his suc
cessor should have.
"It very much needs to be
somebody who can establish a
love and resonance with the fun
damental values of this place," he
said. "It does not need to be some
one on the faculty, but the person
should know Stanford or be
attuned to its values."
Stanford's next president
"should have a strong sense of
community," Kennedy added.
"The next person should also
have a strong sense of the compo

sition of the student body and a
love for the students here.
"I do not think that the presi
dent of this University can do this
job from inside an office build
ing," he concluded.
The 12th year and beyond
"I am looking forward to doing
this year right — and also enjoy
ing it," Kennedy said. He added
that he feels "a certain sense that
there are some opportunities I am
having for the last time" as presi
dent.
"I try not to approach it with
that attitude, but it does come over
me every now and then," he said.
After retiring next summer,
Kennedy will take a working year
long sabbatical before rejoining
the ranks of the Stanford faculty
in the developing environmental
studies program.
Kennedy said he will also
return to the Department of Bio
logical Sciences — where he began
his career at Stanford and started
the human biology program.
But he emphasized that for
now, he is still preoccupied with
Stanford's budget problems. "We
are going to proceed in a very
hopeful way to undertake this
reshaping and, I hope, have a year
— really have a year — in the pro
cess.
"We need a little reminder
that, despite the terrific media
focus, basically the richness, com
munity and academic life here are
unchanged. ... As life is really
lived here, it is still very, very
good."
