Stanford will emerge a better
place — "absolutely" — after a
trying time of controversy and
budget cuts, University President
Donald Kennedy said.
"I really think we can," Kennedy
said in an interview with The Daily
yesterday. "That doesn't mean that
we don't have to give things up.
There will be services that are poor

with less flourish.
"But I hope and believe that we
can come through with a tighter
focus on things that are really
important and a less cluttered
environment in which it is easier
to concentrate."

Kennedy, who on July 29 an

the University more focus as it
begins a challenging year.
"I am convinced that uncer

Kennedy said. "Uncertainty
about my plans just wouldn't be
appropriate at a moment like
this."

future are dispelled, Kennedy will
concentrate on the University's
soul-searching attempt to cut 10
percent from its operating bud
get. The challenge will be to build
a broad consensus among faculty

and students on a vision for the
future of a smaller Stanford.
Budget battle lines
Kennedy said the parochialism
shown by many faculty and stu

to the severity of the budget crisis
— a reaction which, ultimately,
they will have to overcome.
"In every process like this that
I've ever seen, there is a phase in
which people, quite properly,
make the best defense they can
about what is important to
them," he said.
"In the successful processes
they eventually step back and
take a larger view of the institu
