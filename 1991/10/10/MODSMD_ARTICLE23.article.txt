## Hungry Like The Wolf Voracious frosh water polo star chews up opposing defenses 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Anyone who has ever seen Wolf
Wigo eat knows the freshman water
polo player from New York City is a lit
tle bit different.
As teammate Frank Schneider said,
"He's sort of big on the sauces."
Is he ever. Ketchup seems to be his
favorite, and he puts it on everything.
"I just heap the ketchup on and let
everything get completely soaked. If I
have a hamburger and fries, I can prob
ably use up a whole bottle of the stuff.
For a Big Mac, it's probably about 15 of
those little packets," Wigo said.
And they say people from California
are strange.
Something else people have noticed
about the 6-foot-2-inch, 180-pound
Wigo is that he is something special to
watch in the pool.
"Players like Wolf just don't come
along that often. He is definitely one of
the most outstanding freshmen we've
ever had. For a freshman to come in
and play like he has is very rare. You
have to be an exceptional player, and he
certainly seems to be of that caliber,"
said Stanford water polo coach Dante
Dettamanti.
One of the top recruits in the coun
try coming out of the Bronx High
School of Science — yes, the Bronx
School of Science — Wigo has lived up
to his reputation so far for the Cardi
nal. Wigo began the season coming in
off the bench, but he quickly moved
into the starting lineup where he has
remained ever since — and after scor
ing four goals in the team's last game
against UC-Davis — Wigo is now the
team leader with 22 goals.
Freshmen usually don't start for
Stanford teams — in fact, the last time
a freshman field player started for the
Cardinal was in 1983 — but Wigo has
proved to be an exception.
"I would have liked to not start him,
so he could get a little experience, but

I've almost been forced to. He's one of
the few guys on the team who can
score, so he has to be in there for us to
win," Dettamanti said.
Schneider, who along with freshman
goalkeeper Jack Bowen, is a teammate
of Wigo's on the United States Junior
National Team, is equally full of praise
for the team's new star.
"He's an extremely talented player.
He's a faster swimmer than most guys
and he's got about the quickest shot on
the whole team. You put those two
things together and you really can't go
too wrong," Schneider said.
Something else that has helped Wigo
quickly become such a force is his expe
rience. Growing up in New York is not
exactly conducive to becoming a water
polo player — Wigo is the only non-Cal
ifornian on the team besides two for
eign players.
But fortunately for Wigo, his father
Bruce is a member of the New York
Athletic Club where water polo is one of
the sports offered.
Wigo began playing water polo at the
club at the age of eleven —much earlier
than most begin — and before long, he
was playing for the club's prestigious
senior men's team.
This squad is annually one of the
best clubs in the nation and is almost
entirely composed of former college
players — except for Wigo. You see,
Wigo began playing for the team when
he was only 15.
"It was a bit difficult because they
were all much bigger and they could
just hold me down if they wanted,"
Wigo recalled, "But it was still a lot of
fun. I got to travel and get out of the
city every weekend, and it was fun
being the youngest one. They'd tease
me a little, even try to set me up with
girls sometimes. It was really a great
experience for me."
Playing with older, more physical,
and more experienced players also
undoubtedly helped make Wigo into
the player he is now.

"Most freshmen in college had an
easy time in high school and were much
better than the guys they were playing
against, so they didn't get the experi
ence I got," Wigo said.
Dettamanti agrees with his star's
assessment. "One reason he's so good
so soon is that he's grown up playing
with guys who have already played and
succeeded in college. The best way to
learn the game is to play with older,
better players, and Wolf was lucky
enough to have this opportunity."
College water polo is on a drastically
different level from high school water
polo, but for the experienced Wigo, it
has not been that big of an adjustment.
"It really hasn't been that much dif
ferent for me," Wigo said. "I've played
with older guys before and have the
advantage of already knowing what you
need to do to play well at this level."
Wigo's performance so far has
proved his statement true. "Especially
for a young kid, he plays like an older
guy. For a freshman, he really doesn't
make too many of the mistakes you
usually expect," Dettamanti said.
Well, he did make one slight mistake
that only a freshman could make. You
see, on the first official day of practice,
Wigo overslept.
No big deal, though. Or at least
nothing a loud alarm clock hasn't
solved.
Just how much confidence Detta
manti has in Wigo, whose first name is
actually Wolfgang, is shown by the fact
that Wigo is the one who takes the
penalty shots for Stanford.
"It takes a special shooter to take
penalty shots, because of all the pres
sure and everything," Dettamanti said,
"And he hasn't missed one yet. He's a
real natural."
The one thing Wigo does need to
work on is putting on a little more
weight and getting stronger, but if he
keeps on eating all that ketchup, that
should be no problem at all for this
remarkable New Yorker.
