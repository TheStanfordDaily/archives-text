# Its showtime! QB gets axed, understudy to start
## 
### 
Director Denny Green Tuesday
impulsively fired his lead actor,
senior quarterback Jason
Palumbis, and substituted understudy
sophomore Steve Stenstrom for the next
performance.
Green's team has gotten poor reviews,
and soon the fans will find something else
to do with their Saturdays. And then the
producer gets mad. So Green figured,
throw in a new face and maybe the fans
will be fooled into coming back. And who
knows, maybe he can spark the team to
respectability, a winning record or even
an Oscar-winning bowl appearance.
I like Green's gutsy decision — he
didn't wait until Stanford was 3-7 to
make a switch. But unless Stenstrom
gets more support than Palumbis did,
don't expect the team to get any better.
Stanford has too many offensive troubles
to blame them all on Palumbis.
"It looks like we're going to make a
quarterback change," said Green in a
cryptic press conference statement Tues

day."The passing attack has not been as
good as it should be. We've not been play
ing to our potential."
"Stenstrom has thrown well, he has a
good arm, he's alert, he's shown good
poise, and done a good job," said Green,
who will start Stenstrom in Saturday's
Cornell game.
"We're 1-3 and want to find a way to
change that," explained herculean left
guard Brian Cassidy. "The coach gets
paid the big bucks to [make changes]."
True, Palumbis has been uninspiring
as the headliner in a talent-filled lineup.
He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass,
can't throw deep, has Craig Morton-type
scrambling skills and hasn't picked up a
flanker or tight end recently on his field
radar. In four games he has completed 57
percent of his passes for 782 yards and
four interceptions. Most importantly,
Palumbis' senior leadership has pro
duced a 1-3 record and an underachieving
offense.
But Palumbis' supporting actors have

been forgetting their lines left and right,
or not even showing up for work.
Last week I called starting flanker Jon
Pinckney a non-factor after he had just
one catch against Colorado. This week he
had zero catches and I've run out of
adjectives, so I'll just recommend he be
benched alongside Palumbis, allowing
junior David Calomese and sophomore
David Shaw a chance to contribute. It's
hard for a quarterback to throw deep
when there is no one there but defensive
backs.
Kicker Aaron Mills, one-for-six on

field goal attempts, certainly hasn't made
the quarterback's job any easier with his
Grand Canyon-sized slump. When you
drive the ball 70 yards, its nice to get
some points.
The defense, which earned an Oscar
for its Colorado performance, has forced
the quarterback to be near-perfect in the
other three games. Finally, Stan
ford's most dangerous offensive weapon,
multi-purpose running back Glyn Mil
burn, has been limited with injuries — as
has starting tight end Ryan Wetnight —
so it has been Palumbis and Tommy
Vardell running the show.
But Green's decision has been made
and Palumbis, who had started 15
straight games and had the best season
pass completion percentage in Stanford
history last year, will be replaced by Sten
strom as Stanford's starting quarter
back.
"I'm normally pretty emphatic," said
Green, who as of Saturday wasn't even
considering a switch. "When we decide to

do something, we consider all the
options. We have to be willing to take
responsibility for it."
Stenstrom, a 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound
sophomore from El Toro, Calif., redshirt
ed last year and beat out six quarterbacks
for the back-up role in the spring. He has
displayed a strong arm in fourth quarter
mop-up duties against Notre Dame and
Washington, completing 14-of-23 passes
for 193 yards, with one interception.
The quarterback switch could not
come at a more opportune time for Sten
strom. Palumbis has just finished playing
against four bowl teams from last year,
while Stenstrom will face an Ivy-league
patsy and Oregon State, one of the worst
Division I teams in the nation, in two of
his first three games. USC comes in
between.
Stenstrom won't need to throw the
ball against Pop Warner-sized Cornell,
but if he does he'll have a chance to break


Nat Cousins
some Stanford passing records.
USC will be the true test.
Some might charge that Green
is sacrificing Palumbis for next
year's hopes, when Stanford has
an easier schedule. But I think
Stenstrom will give Stanford a
better chance this year as well.
"We're looking to go 6-0 in
league (the rest of the year),"
explained Green. "We're looking
at one game at a time and we can
go 6-0."
A perfect record the rest of the
way is an achievable goal given
Stanford's good, but defeatable,
opposition. A bowl game is still
not impossible. With a strong
armed quarterback, no injuries to

Vardell or Milburn, and better
play on both sides of the ball,
Stanford can turn this season
around.
As for Palumbis, society always
appreciates actors and quarter
backs, even if they aren't the
greatest. Ronald Reagan became
President and former Redskin
quarterback Joe Thiesman gets
paid to commentate sports. If
Palumbis doesn't return to the
Stanford Stadium field, I'm sure
he'll get his degree and excel in
something else.

Nat Cousins is a senior majoring
in intramural sports manage
ment. His column last week on
Justin Armour didn't look like a
column because someone stole his
picture. For better or worse, it new
has been returned.
