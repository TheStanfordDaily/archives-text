Men's Ultimate

Stanford wins 4 of 6 in

Northern California Open

Stanford was one of the only collegiate
teams to enter the tournament. Since open
teams are far more experienced, collegiate
teams rarely make a showing in open play,
and furthermore the Cardinal only had
time for two practices since reuniting from
summer recess.
Nonetheless, the undermanned squad
won four of six games over the weekend,
losing only to South Bay and East Bay, each
of which finished last season ranked in the
top five open teams in the nation.
In the final game, a minuscule core of 10
weary players defeated a talented Berkeley
team (representing the city, not the univer
sity) which had practiced together through
the entire year.
Stanford scored five times more than
Berkeley, and absconded with a surprising
ly lopsided 17-12 win. This victory clinched
the Cardinal a position in the prestigious
Western Regional Tournament, to be held
at Stanford Oct. 19-20. No other college
team on the West Coast qualified.
"We were so good," reflected co-captain
JefT"Mr. Snuffaluffagus" Reed. "We played

a solid offense and didn't turn the disc
much. Six games in two days is a lot, espe
cially when you only have a small team like
we did. By the last game we were all pretty
tired, but we just kept it up every point.
Even though we had half the number of
guys that Berkeley did, we outran them and
shut them down on defense."
The Stanford team is expected to be one
of the strongest contenders for the national
collegiate title this year. Co-captain Allan
"Skelator" Padgett emphasized, however,
that returning players alone can not win a
national championship.
"Experience has shown time and again
that the teams that do well during tourna
ment season (late winter and spring quar
ters) are the ones with the best rookies.
"We were fourth in the nation last year,
and it will definitely help that most of our
team will return. However, the backbone of
our team — the opposable thumb if you will
— will be our younger players. The major
focus of the fall and winter will be for us to
use our experienced players to teach the
newer players Ultimate," Padgett said.
"The style of offense we teach the play
ers here was conceived at Stanford years
ago," explained wily veteran Bruce
"Abdominal Snowman" Rodriguez. "It's
called the Stanford-O, and basically the
seven players are divided into two positions:
handlers and deeps. Handlers are the more
experienced players. They play near the disc
— sort of like quarterbacks — and execute a
set pattern of cuts in an attempt to gradual
ly work the disc down field while the
younger, faster deeps try to brake open
down field for the long pass."


Al Green — Daily
Allan Padgett of the Stanford men's Ultimate team lays out to catch the disc. Although it's early in the year, the squad
has already faced some of the nation's top teams.
