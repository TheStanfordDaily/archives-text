# Cornell Big Red is big question mark
## 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
For anyone who has wondered how many
points can possibly be scored in a college foot
ball game, Stanford Stadium might be the
place to find out. The Big Red of Cornell
bring their Ivy League student—athletes into
battle Saturday against the student—ath
letes of Stanford to play a game that could
answer many questions, but one question
looms above them all:
Why are these two football teams playing
each other in the first place?
"There has been a long term relationship
between Stanford and Cornell," said Big Red
coach Jim Hofher. "I think the two presi
dents got together to talk about about their
schedules way back in the early *80's and
decided it would be a really neat thing to have
their football teams play each other.
What the Cardinal will get is a 1-2 football
team that, like itself, is defeated in confer
ence play. Though favored to win the Ivy
League crown after sharing the title last
year, Cornell lost its opener to Princeton 18-
0. The team followed this up with a 31-13 loss
to Colgate before finally notching its first win

of the year last weekend 23-7 over Bucknell.
So why the game? Blame the Centennial.
Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford, mod
eled his school after Cornell and hired Big
Red grad David Starr Jordan as Stanford's
first president. Cornell and Stanford are con
sidered sister schools, and while Stanford cel
ebrates reaching the century mark, Cornell
made it there 25 years ago.
To help mark these two important birth
days, the two teams were to meet as one of
the highlights of Stanford's Centennial. But
scheduling problems pushed the festivities
backwards and Colorado, not Cornell,
became the athletic focus of the Centennial
weekend. Yet without the trappings of
romantic reminiscing, the intellect is forced
to battle this question of scheduling harder
than The Big Red will have to fight for
yardage.
The closest The Big Red are to being
ranked nationally is being 10th in Div. 1-AA
in turnover margin (1.67 per game). They
have never played any Pac-10 schools in foot
ball. They once had a running back who
gained 1,881 yards in a season, but Ed Mari
naro had a better chance winning an Emmy
when he played on Hill Street Blues than he

ever did at winning the Heisman playing for
Cornell. Mismatch might not quite grasp the
situation correctly.
"I'm not sure it's David versus Goliath,"
said Hofher. "I think it's more like David ver
sus Goliath's very bigger older brother.
"I don't know if our football team will get
anything out of it except being a competitive
football team, and seeing if we can handle
(Stanford's) kind of size and speed."
No matter what the reasons might be, a
game still has to be played, and Stanford
coach Denny Green realizes that with his
team at 1-3, he is not in a position to take
anything for granted.
"I'm not sure exactly what to expect, but I
do know it is football and they play it well,"
said Green. "They are not going to come out
here and be intimidated by Stanford Univer
sity."
"They are on the schedule and I'm not
interested in feeling sorry for somebody sim
ply because of their particular situation. I
don't feel sorry for ourselves and I damn sure
am not interested in feeling sorry for any
body else."
Certainly not an older sister who does not
happen to be quite as coordinated.
