# Quotas haunt language depts.

Language departments are
being required to increase class
size and decrease their office staff
this year as part of previously
announced University budget
cuts.
Affected professors and staff
members also say thoughts of the
more severe cuts which will be
announced throughout this year
are keeping them awake at night.
Last spring the academic deans
decided to raise the minimum
number of students in language
classes. Beginning this fall, lan
guage classes for first-year stu
dents containing less than 20 stu
dents can be canceled, as can sec
ond-year classes with less than
eight students.
According to Nancy Padgett,
financial dean for the School of
Humanities and Sciences, "Each
language department has a lot of
classes they want to offer, and
[they were faced with] either
shrinking curriculum or increas
ing section size slightly."
"If there's only one section
offered, we keep it open," Padgett
said. Classes with fewer than the
minimum number of students
will be judged on a individual
basis by Susan Stephens, the aca
demic dean for languages in
Humanities and Sciences.
Another effect of the previous
ly announced cuts is a decrease in
the size of the language depart

mentB* office staffs. As a result,
the remaining personnel have
much more responsibility and
have greater stress than before,
said Russell Berman, chair of the
German Studies Department.
Furthermore, "the curricular
range has decreased," Berman
said, adding that he was "appre
hensive" to see what other effects
the budget problems will create.
The cuts in foreign language
departments are probably not
over. Last month's preliminary
recommendations of the Faculty
Senate Committee on Education
and Scholarship warned of more
reductions because of the Univer
sity's current effort to cut its
operating budget by $40 million.
"We may need to countenance
cuts in the number of lecturers
and other non-Academic Council
instructors in .. . foreign language
courses," the report said. The
committee is an advisory body
that is attempting to pull together
faculty voices on budget cuts.
Many language department
faculty are concerned about fur
ther reductions in the future.
"The University has to realize
that at some point cuts will
undermine our ability to be a
first-rate university, especially in
our humanities departments,"
Berman said.
The changed requirements
have not strongly affected the
Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ment because they have not had

trouble meeting the minimum,
said department administrator
Sylvia Wohlmut.
But other departments have
less positive perspectives-. Jean-
Marie Apostolides, chair of the
French and Italian Department,
said that although the "picture is
not clear yet," he expects that
"mayor transformations are to
come" from the decrease in staff
support and funding.
Apostolides said the new class
size requirements are "extremely
difficult" to adjust to and that
actually it is "too late to do so"
this quarter.
A professor who asked to
remain unnamed echoed Apos
tolides. She said the language
departments received the letter
regarding the new minimum on
class sizes a few days after the
quarter began, when adjusting to
the requirements was virtually
impossible.
Some students said the new
requirements could have a nega
tive effect on their classes. Fresh
man Colleen Chien said, "Being in
a small language class motivates
both the student and the teacher
by forcing both to interact with
one another on a more personal
and challenging ground.
"Anyone can learn the basics of
a language from tapes and books,
but the real uses of words and the
understanding of culture comes
from the teacher-student rela
tionship," she said.
