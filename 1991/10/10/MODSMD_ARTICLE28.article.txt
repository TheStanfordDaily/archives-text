# Project encourages peace talks
## Israelis and Palestinians discuss problems and solutions 
### Janar Stewart 
Five years ago, a dialogue
between Palestinians and Israelis
seemed impossible to many people.
But last night the chair of the
City Committee for East Jerusalem
and the editor of a Palestinian
newspaper came together again to
tell the Stanford community that
this is no longer true.
"War is not an option any
more," committee chair Moshe
Amirav said, hoping to reach pro-
Israeli Jews in this nation. He
described his participation in
talks between individual Israelis
and Palestinians started earlier
this year as "taking a calculated
risk."
Editor Hanna Siniora spoke of
the five wars between the Israelis
and the surrounding countries

and said, "With every war, the sit
uation has only been aggravated.
Military action will not bring a
solution."
In July, Amirav and Siniora
met with eight other Israelis and
Palestinians in a dialogue on ways
to achieve a peaceful future. The
group wrote the Framework for a
Public Peace Process, what it calls
a model peace plan for the region.
The project was funded jointly
by the Stanford Center on Con
flict and Negotiation and the
Beyond War Foundation, now
called the Foundation for Global
Change.
The two men said they realize
that no agreements will be
reached if leaders on both sides
continue refusing to discuss the
issues. Amirav said the politicians
preferred to deal with minor

issues rather than seriously tack
le the larger problem.
This is mainly because in order
for any progress to be made, both
sides need to make painful con
cessions, he added.
Amirav, who himself was
wounded in the 1967 Six Day
War, fears a similar or worse out
come for his son if another war
occurs. ,
Polls have shown that Israeli
perceptions on many issues
regarding war and peace with the
Palestinians have changed over
the years.
"Ten years ago, five percent of
the nation would be ready to
accept a Palestinian state. Today,
40 percent feel it is inevitable and
60 percent say Israelis should
speak" with the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, said Amirav.
