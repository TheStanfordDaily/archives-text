# ASSU criticizes search plan for Stanford's next president
## 
### Adam Stein 
The decision to choose one stu
dent for the committee searching
for a new University president has
drawn charges of tokenism from
members of the ASSU.
In an attempt to open up a high
ly secretive process to a broader
range of opinions, the Board of
Trustees has asked the ASSU
Nominations Committee to pick
three students, one of whom will
then be chosen to serve on the 17-
member Presidential Selection
Committee.

Among other criteria, the stu
dent must be a graduate student
with a Stanford undergraduate
degree.
"Having one student trivializes
the idea of student input," said
ASSU Senate chair Kevin Warsh,
a senior. "No matter how the stu
dent is selected, no matter how
wide that student's breadth of
knowledge, it's a lot of pressure to
have to represent the entire stu
dent body."
"A voice of one is almost no
voice at all," agreed graduate stu
dent John Overdeck, a Council of

Presidents member.
However, the search commit
tee's goal is not to find a student
who represents the full range of
opinions on campus, said trustee
Dr. Linda Clever. She was part of
the group that recommended the
committee's structure.
"We wanted a balance of view
points, while realizing that we
couldn't possibly have all opinions
represented," said Clever. "After
all, how many races, sexes, profes
sions and religions are there at
Stanford?
"We aren't looking for a cam
r pus representative, but for an out
' standing citizen who has the
I interest of the whole university at
heart and who also has the per
il spective of a student."
In a letter sent to several
trustees and administrators three
weeks ago, Warsh outlined a pro
posal for student participation in
the selection process. The letter
asked that the trustees allow four
' students to sit on the search com
\ mittee: a graduate and an under
; graduate student, both full voting
members, and an ASSU Senate
and COP member, both nonvot
ing members.
In addition, the letter asked
that the selection committee give
the ASSU a short list of the final
candidates for University presi
dent. Each finalist would then be
invited to a question-and-answer
session with a group of fifteen stu
dents, who would act as an advi
sory board to the trustees.
Such a group of students inter
viewed Donald Kennedy in 1980,
when he was a finalist in the last
presidential search. COP member
Beth Morgan expressed hope that
Stanford will follow "historical
precedent."
The trustees have not given a
direct response to the letter.
By allowing even one student
on the committee, however, the
trustees are going further than
i most universities. Many search
processes at other institutions in
recent years have been extremely
secretive and have not had stu
dents on search committees.
When MIT chose Charles Vest
as its new president in 1990, "dur
ing the search, they wouldn't tell
[students] any names, any dates,
any possibilities," said Ruven
Lerner, editor in chief of The
Tech, the student newspaper.
Although students were told
they could meet with the commit
tees and express their opinions,
effectively, "there was no student
input," Lerner said.
The search for a new president
at Harvard University last year
was "a very exclusive, secretive
process," said Phil Pan, a reporter
for the Harvard Crimson. "There
were no status reports to the fac
ulty, students, or public."
As for student participation,
said Pan, the search committee
sent a letter to every student ask
ing for opinions and met with the
student government. However,
the committee did not establish
an official means for regular stu
dent input.
Clever said that the decision to
allow a student on the Stanford
search committee is partly in
response to the controversies that
have recently shaken the Univer
sity. "Special circumstances call
for special situations. It seems a
time when we really need to work
together and show solidarity."
Warsh said, "Selecting a presi
dent is traditionally the trustees'
domain, and if they said they
wanted to do it by themselves, we
really wouldn't have any reason
to complain.
"But for them to state that
they want to reach out, and then
to look for one specific student, is
really missing the point.. . . We're
not trying to gain votes on the
committee. The vote isn't what
matters. What matters is convey
ing student opinion."
