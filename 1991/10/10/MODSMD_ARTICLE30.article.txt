# Stage three: more reforms set
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford is using at least 65
financial professionals and $10
million to satisfy new government
requirements on indirect costs,
according to a proposal delivered
to government officials Tuesday.
Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten presented the report to
Navy officials and members of
Congress in an attempt to demon
strate the University's resolve to
meet new regulations.
Submitting the report is "the
third in a series of steps Stanford
has taken" to reform its accounting
system, said Rob Eno, assistant
director of government relations in
the Office of Public Affairs.
The first step was the voluntary
withdrawal of $2.3 million in inap
propriate indirect costs and the
hiring of Arthur Andersen & Co.
to examine Stanford's internal
accounting system in January.
Stage two involved the
announcement of a comprehensive
set of reforms and recommenda
tions from Arthur Andersen and

hiring of Van Etten as the new
chief financial officer.
Van Etten was unavailable for
comment yesterday afternoon.
Eno said the proposal "shows
the concrete steps" the University
is taking to meet government reg
ulations and explains the "amount
of resources Stanford will devote"
to the process for this fiscal year.
Most of the 65-member account
ing team is preparing new cost stud
ies for the government to justify the
University's indirect-cost rate.
Eno said the approximately $10
million needed for the studies is
basically a one-time expense
because the updates that will be
needed every year or two are much
cheaper to perform. According to
Eno, there will be some ongoing
expenses, but it is unclear what
they will be.

The report presented to the offi
cials also detailed an "extensive
training program" for 2,300 facul
ty and staff through a "series of
cost-policy training sessions."
Other parts of the report
included:
• Creation of an Office of Gov
ernment Cost and Rate Studies to
take on some duties from the
Office of the Controller, including
"implementation of many of the
aspects of Stanford's reform pro
gram to improve government cost
ing matters";
• Details of the implementation
process of the Arthur Anderson
recommendations issued in July;
and
• Formation of a 16-member ad
hoc faculty advisory group on indi
rect costs, chaired by Dean of
Research Robert Byer.
