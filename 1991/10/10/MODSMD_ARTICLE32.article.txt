'fjjjfF 1 modeling the latest high-fashion cock
tail dress from the Stanford book
store. And here comes Paolo, passing
by that big naked statue outside of the library, wearing the most

Bohemian Rhapsody
Outside the Coffee House you notice a vision in black and blue
— black mock turtle, faded blue jeansand thick-soled, black
leather Doc Martin-like shoes that look like they could really do a
job on any poor-fool insect that happens to get trapped underfoot.
But never mind public service announcements from the Humane

The fashionable figure could be Diana Blank, a trendsetting
fifth-year senior from New York City, who audaciously

jeans are the only acceptable form of shorts for NY dressers; all
other shorts are considered, among other things, "too Californi
an," "too Stanfordy" and "too short."
New York dressers, known for wearing long pants, wool
sweaters and leather boots in 90 degree weather, are heavily
influenced by the Saint Francis School of Mohair Coats and often
moan, "It's sooo hot in California!"
