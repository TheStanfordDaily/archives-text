Bohemian Rhapsody
Outside the Coffee House you notice a vision in black and blue
— black mock turtle, faded blue jeansand thick-soled, black
leather Doc Martin-like shoes that look like they could really do a
job on any poor-fool insect that happens to get trapped underfoot.
But never mind public service announcements from the Humane
Society.
The fashionable figure could be Diana Blank, a trendsetting
fifth-year senior from New York City, who audaciously
announces, "I'm not afraid to wear black and blue together."
Blank explains that, according to the New York fashion code,
black matches everything. (Fashion tip: Try black slacks with a
black turtleneck and black shoes. Not only does it match, but it
will also remind all those who see you to stop smiling. What the
heck are they so happy and bright about anyway?)
Blue jeans that look like they've been victimized by a malfunc
tioning dryer or chewed on by sharp-toothed, rabid younger sib
lings are very popular among the New York dress crowd. Cut-off
jeans are the only acceptable form of shorts for NY dressers; all
other shorts are considered, among other things, "too Californi
an," "too Stanfordy" and "too short."
New York dressers, known for wearing long pants, wool
sweaters and leather boots in 90 degree weather, are heavily
influenced by the Saint Francis School of Mohair Coats and often
moan, "It's sooo hot in California!"

word before, or even heard of it, all you can think of is effluvium.

Psychology major Phoebe Marritt enjoys spending part of her free
time in the foothills, getting in touch with the more natural side of
Stanford. Cotton, Indian-print blouse from a used clothing store in
L.A. — $8; cotton, Indian-print skirt acquired in a clothing trade;
shoes by Birkenstock — $70; sunglasses from a Manhattan street
vendor — $6; bought and homeade jewlery acquired as gifts.
lem shared by all those forced into
proximity with sandal wearers.
Stanford students love to
expose their feet to open air, and

second only to going barefoot,
wearing Birkenstocks is the most
popular way to announce to the
campus, "I'm my own person. I
can have smelly feet and

still have friends. So there,
take that!" Let's follow the

sandal footprints to Lamb
da Nu, where we might encounter
junior Phoebe Marritt, a psychol
ogy who fits into the gra
nola category as snugly as a hairy
leg fits into a Birkenstock.
Marritt likes to complement
her Birkenstocks with second
hand Indian skirts, loose T-shirts
(tie-dyed, Greenpeace, earth day)
and a piece of leather string
around her neck with an African
trading bead. She wears a silver
ankle bracelet that jingles,
because, she explains, "I love to
make noise when I walk."
Marritt isn't quite sure how
she acquired most of her clothes,
but she traces her T-shirts back to
her summer spent attending
demonstrations and working for

Greenpeace. One of her
tie-dyes is the result of a
barter at a Grateful Dead

show — she traded her spare con
cert ticket for a crystal and the
shirt.
Most granolas receive their tie
dye shirts from friends or make
them themselves in the throes of
an "I need something to match
these Guatemalan shorts" fit.
Some granolas buy their shirts in
White Plaza when nobody is look
ing. Marritt doesn't approve.
Catalog addicts
You've said farewell to Phoebe,

perhaps even exchanged friend
ship bracelets, and you are now
strolling down Mayfield avenue,
continuing your tour of Stanford
fashions. You run into a good look
ing, strapping young man who has

come directly off page 37 of this
season's J. Crew catalog. He has
on a striped rugby shirt ($4B),
weathered, double-pleat canvas
trousers ($6B) and loafers. His
name might be Chip; his major
might be political science. "Excuse
me! Excuse me, Chip!" you call,
desperate for a fashion statement.
Who are you kidding? Did you
think Chip would actually listen
to slovenly, old you? Or maybe his
name wasn't Chip.

Moving right along . . . Rhett
Harty also looks like he orders
from the Crew catalog, but the
well-dressed junior says he gets
most of his clothes from The

GAP, Banana Republic and Nord
strom's. He wears light brown
suede bucks, baggy Levi's and
sometimes coordinates his socks
to his T-shirts.
Hard-core preps always match

their socks with
their rugby
shirts. The color
of both must
share the name
with some juicy
and high-priced
fruit: raspberry,
peach, kiwi or
plum.
Preps are will
ing to take fash
ion risks. In win
ter, they put
away their khaki,
brushed linen
bermudas and
take out their

full-length, double-pleated khaki
pants. Stanford preps worship
Ralph Lauren fashions but, due to
the recession, often have to settle
for ersatz Polo — with man riding
not quite upright on unidentifiable
four-legged beast.
Less is More
"What's Madonna doing outside
of the Ford fitness center?" you
might ask, when you catch sight of
Justine Mattera, one of the most

minimally dressed students on
campus. Mattera, like Madonna,
likes to wear tight, skimpy clothes.
"1 have no qualms about wearing
very short shorts and tight half

tops," declares the junior from
Queens, New York, who insists
that her style was not influenced
by Madonna.
Mattera says she is simply "not

comfortable with
stuff that's ill fit
ting," explaining
that all big and
non-clinging
clothes fit into the
ill-fitting category.
Mattera seems to
be bothered by hav
ing to wear any
clothes at all. "If I
could walk around
naked, I might,"
she says.
Mattera's style
began as an at
tempt to catch the
eye of a cute wind
surfing instructor
at summer camp.

She grew used to
the tight lycra fashions and contin
ued to stretch them on long after
the instructor had washed ashore.
However, now she insists that she's
not trying to catch the attention of
the male population. She's also not
attempting to inflame the

feminists, nor to "be a
cheese," she says. She's

just trying to be comfortable.
Burnish Lycra and you'll end
up with the glossy fabric spandex,
which has enjoyed great populari
ty recently as California trendset
ters realized that biking shorts
shouldn't just be for cyclists any
more and that jogbras were actu
ally quite fashionable and
shouldn't be shrouded under big,
baggy T-shirts. Spandex, inciden
tally, contains the subliminal
message SEX if you so boldly take
the "pand" out.
Senior Windell Browne, recent
ly spotted on campus wearing
green sweat shorts and black
spandex shorts underneath, says
he wears the layered look for two
reasons: "I play sports and the
spandex shorts, especially the
dark colors (?), help my muscles
warm up." The senior adds that
the shorts also "add a little break
in the color pattern."
For those of you who need help
defining Spandex, Webster's
offers the following: "SPANDEX
(span'deks): an elastic, synthetic
fiber used in girdles, etc." Add to
that the following reminder:
"SPANDEX, it's not just for gir
dles anymore."

Admission Euphoria
"I GO TO STANFORD!"
shouts the matching shirt-sock
shorts attire of the Stanford Uni
versity Clothes Horse (SUCH).

You halt before Branner Hall, to
see a vision in Stanford style, a
true tribute to the expanded
clothing section of the Stanford
bookstore. SUCHs, mainly fresh
men, are extremely industrious -
they can cleverly match stripes,
plaids and ugly T-shirts with can
celed postage stamps on them
according to their common
inscription: "STANFORD." And
then they can match that entire
ensemble with a matching date
book, centennial pen and desk
blotter.
SUCHs must realize exactly
how ridiculous they look, because
four out of five of them refused to
comment on their wardrobes.
John, a freshman, said he had so
many Stanford clothes because
the Bookstore was a convenient
place to shop. But does he really
need those Stanford shoelaces?
Exotic City
You're now hovering around
Bechtel International Center,
hoping to glimpse some of the
University's foreign students.
These students are often

among the most intrigu
ingly dressed, which
allows them to taunt

Stanford students seeking
to dress like them. When asked,
"where did you get that cool
shirt?" they can answer things
like, "in a small village in Zimbab
we," i.e., "let's see you go get one
too — ha ha!."
Besides their clothes, students
from foreign backgrounds bring
with them their own ideas about
fashion, often influenced by their
cultures. Ani, a graduate student
whose family came to the United
States from Sri Lanka several
years ago, makes a jingling racket
when she shakes her bangle
adorned arm. "Why so many ban
gles?" you might ask her.
"Because it's part of my culture,"
she says, adding, in a jesting tone,
"It means that I'm fertile and
ready to get married."

The Huddled Masses
Of course there are other types
traipsing about campus who you
might not have time frilly to analyze.
There's the Career Planning and

Placement
Center Group
ie, who perpet
ually looks like
he or she is
heading off for
an interview
with a major
corporation.
CPPC Group
ies are among
the few Stan
ford students
who own irons
and fall further
into the minu
scule subcate
gory of stu
dents who own
irons and actu
ally use them.

Then there's the Grizzly
Adams Wanna-be who, in his
thick Patagonia jacket and hik
ing boots makes you feel like
you've been magically transposed
to the Swiss Alps and often pro
vides for excellent entertainment

during long lectures, as
you speculate about what
he ate for breakfast

according to the multi
farious crumbs clinging to his
scruff. And there's Sporty, who
always looks like he or she is
coming or going to the courts. If
you're quick enough to catch up
to him, give him a little sniff.
Then you'll determine whether
he's coming or going.
The most common fashion ele
ment is the Blender. Ninety per
cent of Stanford students wear
the same uniform: nondescript
shorts with T-shirts. "Students
are just trying to fit in," explains
Senior Sean Bennett, an occa
sional Blender himself. Lycra
wearer Mattera confirms her
opinion, "I don't see a lot of peo
ple taking chances around here.
People want to be like everybody
else."
In "cold" weather, blenders
cover their T-shirts — which
often depict Bart Simpson or
some inside dorm joke that allows
the smug wearer to feel above the
unenlightened masses — with a
Stanford sweatshirt over it. Mr.
Blender's choice of footwear con
sists of white sneakers, thongs or
sandals. Ms. Blender has the
added alternative of wearing flats,
but she does not wear thongs out
side of the dorm. When you com
pliment blenders on their outfit,
they offer such paranoid respons
es as: "What's wrong with it?" or
"Thanks. (Pause.) Are you kid
ding?"
Well, that's the end of our little
tour. Dreamy Muzak fade in. . . .
Join us next week for the Fashion
Tour, Part 2: Professors — an
inside look into their underwear
drawers.

Psychology major Phoebe Marritt enjoys spending part of her free
time in the foothills, getting in touch with the more natural side of
Stanford. Cotton, Indian-print blouse from a used clothing store in
L.A. — $8; cotton, Indian-print skirt acquired in a clothing trade;
shoes by Birkenstock — $70; sunglasses from a Manhattan street
vendor — $6; bought and homeade jewlery acquired as gifts.
lem shared by all those forced into
proximity with sandal wearers.
Stanford students love to
expose their feet to open air, and

second only to going barefoot,
wearing Birkenstocks is the most
popular way to announce to the
campus, "I'm my own person. I
can have smelly feet and

still have friends. So there,
take that!" Let's follow the

sandal footprints to Lamb
da Nu, where we might encounter
junior Phoebe Marritt, a psychol
ogy who fits into the gra
nola category as snugly as a hairy
leg fits into a Birkenstock.
Marritt likes to complement
her Birkenstocks with second
hand Indian skirts, loose T-shirts
(tie-dyed, Greenpeace, earth day)
and a piece of leather string
around her neck with an African
trading bead. She wears a silver
ankle bracelet that jingles,
because, she explains, "I love to
make noise when I walk."
Marritt isn't quite sure how
she acquired most of her clothes,
but she traces her T-shirts back to
her summer spent attending
demonstrations and working for

Greenpeace. One of her
tie-dyes is the result of a
barter at a Grateful Dead

show — she traded her spare con
cert ticket for a crystal and the
shirt.
Most granolas receive their tie
dye shirts from friends or make
them themselves in the throes of
an "I need something to match
these Guatemalan shorts" fit.
Some granolas buy their shirts in
White Plaza when nobody is look
ing. Marritt doesn't approve.
Catalog addicts
You've said farewell to Phoebe,

perhaps even exchanged friend
ship bracelets, and you are now
strolling down Mayfield avenue,
continuing your tour of Stanford
fashions. You run into a good look
ing, strapping young man who has

come directly off page 37 of this
season's J. Crew catalog. He has
on a striped rugby shirt ($4B),
weathered, double-pleat canvas
trousers ($6B) and loafers. His
name might be Chip; his major
might be political science. "Excuse
me! Excuse me, Chip!" you call,
desperate for a fashion statement.
Who are you kidding? Did you
think Chip would actually listen
to slovenly, old you? Or maybe his
name wasn't Chip.

Moving right along . . . Rhett
Harty also looks like he orders
from the Crew catalog, but the
well-dressed junior says he gets
most of his clothes from The

GAP, Banana Republic and Nord
strom's. He wears light brown
suede bucks, baggy Levi's and
sometimes coordinates his socks
to his T-shirts.
Hard-core preps always match

their socks with
their rugby
shirts. The color
of both must
share the name
with some juicy
and high-priced
fruit: raspberry,
peach, kiwi or
plum.
Preps are will
ing to take fash
ion risks. In win
ter, they put
away their khaki,
brushed linen
bermudas and
take out their

full-length, double-pleated khaki
pants. Stanford preps worship
Ralph Lauren fashions but, due to
the recession, often have to settle
for ersatz Polo — with man riding
not quite upright on unidentifiable
four-legged beast.
Less is More
"What's Madonna doing outside
of the Ford fitness center?" you
might ask, when you catch sight of
Justine Mattera, one of the most

minimally dressed students on
campus. Mattera, like Madonna,
likes to wear tight, skimpy clothes.
"1 have no qualms about wearing
very short shorts and tight half

tops," declares the junior from
Queens, New York, who insists
that her style was not influenced
by Madonna.
Mattera says she is simply "not

comfortable with
stuff that's ill fit
ting," explaining
that all big and
non-clinging
clothes fit into the
ill-fitting category.
Mattera seems to
be bothered by hav
ing to wear any
clothes at all. "If I
could walk around
naked, I might,"
she says.
Mattera's style
began as an at
tempt to catch the
eye of a cute wind
surfing instructor
at summer camp.

She grew used to
the tight lycra fashions and contin
ued to stretch them on long after
the instructor had washed ashore.
However, now she insists that she's
not trying to catch the attention of
the male population. She's also not
attempting to inflame the

feminists, nor to "be a
cheese," she says. She's

just trying to be comfortable.
Burnish Lycra and you'll end
up with the glossy fabric spandex,
which has enjoyed great populari
ty recently as California trendset
ters realized that biking shorts
shouldn't just be for cyclists any
more and that jogbras were actu
ally quite fashionable and
shouldn't be shrouded under big,
baggy T-shirts. Spandex, inciden
tally, contains the subliminal
message SEX if you so boldly take
the "pand" out.
Senior Windell Browne, recent
ly spotted on campus wearing
green sweat shorts and black
spandex shorts underneath, says
he wears the layered look for two
reasons: "I play sports and the
spandex shorts, especially the
dark colors (?), help my muscles
warm up." The senior adds that
the shorts also "add a little break
in the color pattern."
For those of you who need help
defining Spandex, Webster's
offers the following: "SPANDEX
(span'deks): an elastic, synthetic
fiber used in girdles, etc." Add to
that the following reminder:
"SPANDEX, it's not just for gir
dles anymore."

Admission Euphoria
"I GO TO STANFORD!"
shouts the matching shirt-sock
shorts attire of the Stanford Uni
versity Clothes Horse (SUCH).

You halt before Branner Hall, to
see a vision in Stanford style, a
true tribute to the expanded
clothing section of the Stanford
bookstore. SUCHs, mainly fresh
men, are extremely industrious -
they can cleverly match stripes,
plaids and ugly T-shirts with can
celed postage stamps on them
according to their common
inscription: "STANFORD." And
then they can match that entire
ensemble with a matching date
book, centennial pen and desk
blotter.
SUCHs must realize exactly
how ridiculous they look, because
four out of five of them refused to
comment on their wardrobes.
John, a freshman, said he had so
many Stanford clothes because
the Bookstore was a convenient
place to shop. But does he really
need those Stanford shoelaces?
Exotic City
You're now hovering around
Bechtel International Center,
hoping to glimpse some of the
University's foreign students.
These students are often

among the most intrigu
ingly dressed, which
allows them to taunt

Stanford students seeking
to dress like them. When asked,
"where did you get that cool
shirt?" they can answer things
like, "in a small village in Zimbab
we," i.e., "let's see you go get one
too — ha ha!."
Besides their clothes, students
from foreign backgrounds bring
with them their own ideas about
fashion, often influenced by their
cultures. Ani, a graduate student
whose family came to the United
States from Sri Lanka several
years ago, makes a jingling racket
when she shakes her bangle
adorned arm. "Why so many ban
gles?" you might ask her.
"Because it's part of my culture,"
she says, adding, in a jesting tone,
"It means that I'm fertile and
ready to get married."

The Huddled Masses
Of course there are other types
traipsing about campus who you
might not have time frilly to analyze.
There's the Career Planning and

Placement
Center Group
ie, who perpet
ually looks like
he or she is
heading off for
an interview
with a major
corporation.
CPPC Group
ies are among
the few Stan
ford students
who own irons
and fall further
into the minu
scule subcate
gory of stu
dents who own
irons and actu
ally use them.

Then there's the Grizzly
Adams Wanna-be who, in his
thick Patagonia jacket and hik
ing boots makes you feel like
you've been magically transposed
to the Swiss Alps and often pro
vides for excellent entertainment

during long lectures, as
you speculate about what
he ate for breakfast

according to the multi
farious crumbs clinging to his
scruff. And there's Sporty, who
always looks like he or she is
coming or going to the courts. If
you're quick enough to catch up
to him, give him a little sniff.
Then you'll determine whether
he's coming or going.
The most common fashion ele
ment is the Blender. Ninety per
cent of Stanford students wear
the same uniform: nondescript
shorts with T-shirts. "Students
are just trying to fit in," explains
Senior Sean Bennett, an occa
sional Blender himself. Lycra
wearer Mattera confirms her
opinion, "I don't see a lot of peo
ple taking chances around here.
People want to be like everybody
else."
In "cold" weather, blenders
cover their T-shirts — which
often depict Bart Simpson or
some inside dorm joke that allows
the smug wearer to feel above the
unenlightened masses — with a
Stanford sweatshirt over it. Mr.
Blender's choice of footwear con
sists of white sneakers, thongs or
sandals. Ms. Blender has the
added alternative of wearing flats,
but she does not wear thongs out
side of the dorm. When you com
pliment blenders on their outfit,
they offer such paranoid respons
es as: "What's wrong with it?" or
"Thanks. (Pause.) Are you kid
ding?"
Well, that's the end of our little
tour. Dreamy Muzak fade in. . . .

Bohemian Rhapsody
Outside the Coffee House you notice a vision in black and blue
— black mock turtle, faded blue jeansand thick-soled, black
leather Doc Martin-like shoes that look like they could really do a
job on any poor-fool insect that happens to get trapped underfoot.
But never mind public service announcements from the Humane
Society.
The fashionable figure could be Diana Blank, a trendsetting
fifth-year senior from New York City, who audaciously
announces, "I'm not afraid to wear black and blue together."
Blank explains that, according to the New York fashion code,
black matches everything. (Fashion tip: Try black slacks with a
black turtleneck and black shoes. Not only does it match, but it
will also remind all those who see you to stop smiling. What the
heck are they so happy and bright about anyway?)
Blue jeans that look like they've been victimized by a malfunc
tioning dryer or chewed on by sharp-toothed, rabid younger sib
lings are very popular among the New York dress crowd. Cut-off
jeans are the only acceptable form of shorts for NY dressers; all
other shorts are considered, among other things, "too Californi
an," "too Stanfordy" and "too short."
New York dressers, known for wearing long pants, wool
sweaters and leather boots in 90 degree weather, are heavily
influenced by the Saint Francis School of Mohair Coats and often
moan, "It's sooo hot in California!"

perhaps even exchanged friend
ship bracelets, and you are now
strolling down Mayfield avenue,
continuing your tour of Stanford
fashions. You run into a good look
ing, strapping young man who has

come directly off page 37 of this
season's J. Crew catalog. He has
on a striped rugby shirt ($4B),
weathered, double-pleat canvas
trousers ($6B) and loafers. His
name might be Chip; his major
might be political science. "Excuse
me! Excuse me, Chip!" you call,
desperate for a fashion statement.
Who are you kidding? Did you
think Chip would actually listen
to slovenly, old you? Or maybe his
name wasn't Chip.

Moving right along . . . Rhett
Harty also looks like he orders
from the Crew catalog, but the
well-dressed junior says he gets
most of his clothes from The

GAP, Banana Republic and Nord
strom's. He wears light brown
suede bucks, baggy Levi's and
sometimes coordinates his socks
to his T-shirts.
Hard-core preps always match

their socks with
their rugby
shirts. The color
of both must
share the name
with some juicy
and high-priced
fruit: raspberry,
peach, kiwi or
plum.
Preps are will
ing to take fash
ion risks. In win
ter, they put
away their khaki,
brushed linen
bermudas and
take out their

full-length, double-pleated khaki
pants. Stanford preps worship
Ralph Lauren fashions but, due to
the recession, often have to settle
for ersatz Polo — with man riding
not quite upright on unidentifiable
four-legged beast.
Less is More
"What's Madonna doing outside
of the Ford fitness center?" you
might ask, when you catch sight of
Justine Mattera, one of the most

minimally dressed students on
campus. Mattera, like Madonna,
likes to wear tight, skimpy clothes.
"1 have no qualms about wearing
very short shorts and tight half

tops," declares the junior from
Queens, New York, who insists
that her style was not influenced
by Madonna.
Mattera says she is simply "not

comfortable with
stuff that's ill fit
ting," explaining
that all big and
non-clinging
clothes fit into the
ill-fitting category.
Mattera seems to
be bothered by hav
ing to wear any
clothes at all. "If I
could walk around
naked, I might,"
she says.
Mattera's style
began as an at
tempt to catch the
eye of a cute wind
surfing instructor
at summer camp.

She grew used to
the tight lycra fashions and contin
ued to stretch them on long after
the instructor had washed ashore.
However, now she insists that she's
not trying to catch the attention of
the male population. She's also not
attempting to inflame the

feminists, nor to "be a
cheese," she says. She's

just trying to be comfortable.
Burnish Lycra and you'll end
up with the glossy fabric spandex,
which has enjoyed great populari
ty recently as California trendset
ters realized that biking shorts
shouldn't just be for cyclists any
more and that jogbras were actu
ally quite fashionable and
shouldn't be shrouded under big,
baggy T-shirts. Spandex, inciden
tally, contains the subliminal
message SEX if you so boldly take
the "pand" out.
Senior Windell Browne, recent
ly spotted on campus wearing
green sweat shorts and black
spandex shorts underneath, says
he wears the layered look for two
reasons: "I play sports and the
spandex shorts, especially the
dark colors (?), help my muscles
warm up." The senior adds that
the shorts also "add a little break
in the color pattern."
For those of you who need help
defining Spandex, Webster's
offers the following: "SPANDEX
(span'deks): an elastic, synthetic
fiber used in girdles, etc." Add to
that the following reminder:
"SPANDEX, it's not just for gir
dles anymore."

Admission Euphoria
"I GO TO STANFORD!"
shouts the matching shirt-sock
shorts attire of the Stanford Uni
versity Clothes Horse (SUCH).

You halt before Branner Hall, to
see a vision in Stanford style, a
true tribute to the expanded
clothing section of the Stanford
bookstore. SUCHs, mainly fresh
men, are extremely industrious -
they can cleverly match stripes,
plaids and ugly T-shirts with can
celed postage stamps on them
according to their common
inscription: "STANFORD." And
then they can match that entire
ensemble with a matching date
book, centennial pen and desk
blotter.
SUCHs must realize exactly
how ridiculous they look, because
four out of five of them refused to
comment on their wardrobes.
John, a freshman, said he had so
many Stanford clothes because
the Bookstore was a convenient
place to shop. But does he really
need those Stanford shoelaces?
Exotic City
You're now hovering around
Bechtel International Center,
hoping to glimpse some of the
University's foreign students.
These students are often

among the most intrigu
ingly dressed, which
allows them to taunt

Stanford students seeking
to dress like them. When asked,
"where did you get that cool
shirt?" they can answer things
like, "in a small village in Zimbab
we," i.e., "let's see you go get one
too — ha ha!."
Besides their clothes, students
from foreign backgrounds bring
with them their own ideas about
fashion, often influenced by their
cultures. Ani, a graduate student
whose family came to the United
States from Sri Lanka several
years ago, makes a jingling racket
when she shakes her bangle
adorned arm. "Why so many ban
gles?" you might ask her.
"Because it's part of my culture,"
she says, adding, in a jesting tone,
"It means that I'm fertile and
ready to get married."

The Huddled Masses
Of course there are other types
traipsing about campus who you
might not have time frilly to analyze.
There's the Career Planning and

Placement
Center Group
ie, who perpet
ually looks like
he or she is
heading off for
an interview
with a major
corporation.
CPPC Group
ies are among
the few Stan
ford students
who own irons
and fall further
into the minu
scule subcate
gory of stu
dents who own
irons and actu
ally use them.

Then there's the Grizzly
Adams Wanna-be who, in his
thick Patagonia jacket and hik
ing boots makes you feel like
you've been magically transposed
to the Swiss Alps and often pro
vides for excellent entertainment

during long lectures, as
you speculate about what
he ate for breakfast

according to the multi
farious crumbs clinging to his
scruff. And there's Sporty, who
always looks like he or she is
coming or going to the courts. If
you're quick enough to catch up
to him, give him a little sniff.
Then you'll determine whether
he's coming or going.
The most common fashion ele
ment is the Blender. Ninety per
cent of Stanford students wear
the same uniform: nondescript
shorts with T-shirts. "Students
are just trying to fit in," explains
Senior Sean Bennett, an occa
sional Blender himself. Lycra
wearer Mattera confirms her
opinion, "I don't see a lot of peo
ple taking chances around here.
People want to be like everybody
else."
In "cold" weather, blenders
cover their T-shirts — which
often depict Bart Simpson or
some inside dorm joke that allows
the smug wearer to feel above the
unenlightened masses — with a
Stanford sweatshirt over it. Mr.
Blender's choice of footwear con
sists of white sneakers, thongs or
sandals. Ms. Blender has the
added alternative of wearing flats,
but she does not wear thongs out
side of the dorm. When you com
pliment blenders on their outfit,
they offer such paranoid respons
es as: "What's wrong with it?" or
"Thanks. (Pause.) Are you kid
ding?"
Well, that's the end of our little
tour. Dreamy Muzak fade in. . . .

Bohemian Rhapsody
Outside the Coffee House you notice a vision in black and blue
— black mock turtle, faded blue jeansand thick-soled, black
leather Doc Martin-like shoes that look like they could really do a
job on any poor-fool insect that happens to get trapped underfoot.
But never mind public service announcements from the Humane
Society.
The fashionable figure could be Diana Blank, a trendsetting
fifth-year senior from New York City, who audaciously
announces, "I'm not afraid to wear black and blue together."
Blank explains that, according to the New York fashion code,
black matches everything. (Fashion tip: Try black slacks with a
black turtleneck and black shoes. Not only does it match, but it
will also remind all those who see you to stop smiling. What the
heck are they so happy and bright about anyway?)
Blue jeans that look like they've been victimized by a malfunc
tioning dryer or chewed on by sharp-toothed, rabid younger sib
lings are very popular among the New York dress crowd. Cut-off
jeans are the only acceptable form of shorts for NY dressers; all
other shorts are considered, among other things, "too Californi
an," "too Stanfordy" and "too short."
New York dressers, known for wearing long pants, wool
sweaters and leather boots in 90 degree weather, are heavily
influenced by the Saint Francis School of Mohair Coats and often
moan, "It's sooo hot in California!"

Psychology major Phoebe Marritt enjoys spending part of her free
time in the foothills, getting in touch with the more natural side of
Stanford. Cotton, Indian-print blouse from a used clothing store in
L.A. — $8; cotton, Indian-print skirt acquired in a clothing trade;
shoes by Birkenstock — $70; sunglasses from a Manhattan street
vendor — $6; bought and homeade jewlery acquired as gifts.
lem shared by all those forced into
proximity with sandal wearers.
Stanford students love to
expose their feet to open air, and

second only to going barefoot,
wearing Birkenstocks is the most
popular way to announce to the
campus, "I'm my own person. I
can have smelly feet and

still have friends. So there,
take that!" Let's follow the

sandal footprints to Lamb
da Nu, where we might encounter
junior Phoebe Marritt, a psychol
ogy who fits into the gra
nola category as snugly as a hairy
leg fits into a Birkenstock.
Marritt likes to complement
her Birkenstocks with second
hand Indian skirts, loose T-shirts
(tie-dyed, Greenpeace, earth day)
and a piece of leather string
around her neck with an African
trading bead. She wears a silver
ankle bracelet that jingles,
because, she explains, "I love to
make noise when I walk."
Marritt isn't quite sure how
she acquired most of her clothes,
but she traces her T-shirts back to
her summer spent attending
demonstrations and working for

Greenpeace. One of her
tie-dyes is the result of a
barter at a Grateful Dead

show — she traded her spare con
cert ticket for a crystal and the
shirt.
Most granolas receive their tie
dye shirts from friends or make
them themselves in the throes of
an "I need something to match
these Guatemalan shorts" fit.
Some granolas buy their shirts in
White Plaza when nobody is look
ing. Marritt doesn't approve.

However, now she insists that she's
not trying to catch the attention of
the male population. She's also not
attempting to inflame the

feminists, nor to "be a
cheese," she says. She's

just trying to be comfortable.
Burnish Lycra and you'll end
up with the glossy fabric spandex,
which has enjoyed great populari
ty recently as California trendset
ters realized that biking shorts
shouldn't just be for cyclists any
more and that jogbras were actu
ally quite fashionable and
shouldn't be shrouded under big,
baggy T-shirts. Spandex, inciden
tally, contains the subliminal
message SEX if you so boldly take
the "pand" out.
Senior Windell Browne, recent
ly spotted on campus wearing
green sweat shorts and black
spandex shorts underneath, says
he wears the layered look for two
reasons: "I play sports and the
spandex shorts, especially the
dark colors (?), help my muscles
warm up." The senior adds that
the shorts also "add a little break
in the color pattern."
For those of you who need help
defining Spandex, Webster's
offers the following: "SPANDEX
(span'deks): an elastic, synthetic
fiber used in girdles, etc." Add to
that the following reminder:
"SPANDEX, it's not just for gir
dles anymore."

Admission Euphoria
"I GO TO STANFORD!"
shouts the matching shirt-sock
shorts attire of the Stanford Uni
versity Clothes Horse (SUCH).

You halt before Branner Hall, to
see a vision in Stanford style, a
true tribute to the expanded
clothing section of the Stanford
bookstore. SUCHs, mainly fresh
men, are extremely industrious -
they can cleverly match stripes,
plaids and ugly T-shirts with can
celed postage stamps on them
according to their common
inscription: "STANFORD." And
then they can match that entire
ensemble with a matching date
book, centennial pen and desk
blotter.
SUCHs must realize exactly
how ridiculous they look, because
four out of five of them refused to
comment on their wardrobes.
John, a freshman, said he had so
many Stanford clothes because
the Bookstore was a convenient
place to shop. But does he really
need those Stanford shoelaces?
Exotic City
You're now hovering around
Bechtel International Center,
hoping to glimpse some of the
University's foreign students.
These students are often

among the most intrigu
ingly dressed, which
allows them to taunt

Stanford students seeking
to dress like them. When asked,
"where did you get that cool
shirt?" they can answer things
like, "in a small village in Zimbab
we," i.e., "let's see you go get one
too — ha ha!."
Besides their clothes, students
from foreign backgrounds bring
with them their own ideas about
fashion, often influenced by their
cultures. Ani, a graduate student
whose family came to the United
States from Sri Lanka several
years ago, makes a jingling racket
when she shakes her bangle
adorned arm. "Why so many ban
gles?" you might ask her.
"Because it's part of my culture,"
she says, adding, in a jesting tone,
"It means that I'm fertile and
ready to get married."

The Huddled Masses
Of course there are other types
traipsing about campus who you
might not have time frilly to analyze.
There's the Career Planning and

Placement
Center Group
ie, who perpet
ually looks like
he or she is
heading off for
an interview
with a major
corporation.
CPPC Group
ies are among
the few Stan
ford students
who own irons
and fall further
into the minu
scule subcate
gory of stu
dents who own
irons and actu
ally use them.

Then there's the Grizzly
Adams Wanna-be who, in his
thick Patagonia jacket and hik
ing boots makes you feel like
you've been magically transposed
to the Swiss Alps and often pro
vides for excellent entertainment

during long lectures, as
you speculate about what
he ate for breakfast

according to the multi
farious crumbs clinging to his
scruff. And there's Sporty, who
always looks like he or she is
coming or going to the courts. If
you're quick enough to catch up
to him, give him a little sniff.
Then you'll determine whether
he's coming or going.
The most common fashion ele
ment is the Blender. Ninety per
cent of Stanford students wear
the same uniform: nondescript
shorts with T-shirts. "Students
are just trying to fit in," explains
Senior Sean Bennett, an occa
sional Blender himself. Lycra
wearer Mattera confirms her
opinion, "I don't see a lot of peo
ple taking chances around here.
People want to be like everybody
else."
In "cold" weather, blenders
cover their T-shirts — which
often depict Bart Simpson or
some inside dorm joke that allows
the smug wearer to feel above the
unenlightened masses — with a
Stanford sweatshirt over it. Mr.
Blender's choice of footwear con
sists of white sneakers, thongs or
sandals. Ms. Blender has the
added alternative of wearing flats,
but she does not wear thongs out
side of the dorm. When you com
pliment blenders on their outfit,
they offer such paranoid respons
es as: "What's wrong with it?" or
"Thanks. (Pause.) Are you kid
ding?"
Well, that's the end of our little
tour. Dreamy Muzak fade in. . . .
Join us next week for the Fashion
Tour, Part 2: Professors — an
inside look into their underwear
drawers.
