# My brave face: a case study of the irrational love of passion

I'M NOT WRITING THIS for
self-pity or some kind of self-psy
cho-analysis or anything. That
would be gross and '90s and Kevin
Costnerish.
No. I'm writing the following
words solely for the benefit of you,
the naive, happy-go-lucky, life-kind
of-reminds-me-of-one-giant-episode-
of-Bewitched reader. Because what
happened to me either will happen,
has happened or is happening to you
— and you deserve to know about it.
Let me explain.
I hadn't been dumped since
eighth grade. And that was just
because Kelly Mack was a little more
mature and I wasn't quite in tune
with the idea that the whole kissing
thing was an integral part of the
"going-out" process.
But this time it was different. I'm
in 15th grade now, and all the rules

seem to have changed without any
one bothering to send me home with
a ditto.
We had been going out for almost
a year when she walked into my
room. This time it wasn't just the
kissing thing — I had pretty much
hammered out all those problems
earlier. This time there were bold
metaphysical phrases ricocheting
around me. Words like "compati
ble," "independence" and "more pro
ficient sexual partner." This time
there were tears, snot and saliva.
Bodily fluids weren't nearly as
acceptable in eighth grade.
Eventually she left my room,
looking back with tears in her eyes
and slowly closing the door behind
her like Mary Tyler Moore in that
last episode. And I was left sitting on
the floor alone, incoherently mum
bling something about "true, meta

physical love" and "Joannie and
Chachi."
I knew right then that I should
have capitalized on the moment and
written a sonnet or a Journey song
or something, but I couldn't. It was
like some really fat guy had taken a
truncheon and pounded on my aorta
until it was all smushed into my left
ventricle ... or something like that.
But I realized I needed to get on
with my life; I needed new goals and
aspirations. I decided the best thing
to do was to stay in my room and
study all year so I could be a disgust
ingly wealthy corporate lawyer who
didn't give any of his money to any
one and told little children to get the
hell off the unused soccer field he
had built on his front lawn just so he
could yell at them. At night I'd write
tomes and tomes of extended
metaphors about a fly eternally

caught on one of those sticky paper
things. ...
But somewhere deep inside I
knew that wasn't healthy.
So I decided to convince myself
that she was right, that this would
