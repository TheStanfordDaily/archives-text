# My brave face: a case study of the irrational love of passion
## 
### 
I'M NOT WRITING THIS for
self-pity or some kind of self-psy
cho-analysis or anything. That
would be gross and '90s and Kevin
Costnerish.
No. I'm writing the following
words solely for the benefit of you,
the naive, happy-go-lucky, life-kind
of-reminds-me-of-one-giant-episode-
of-Bewitched reader. Because what
happened to me either will happen,
has happened or is happening to you
— and you deserve to know about it.
Let me explain.
I hadn't been dumped since
eighth grade. And that was just
because Kelly Mack was a little more
mature and I wasn't quite in tune
with the idea that the whole kissing
thing was an integral part of the
"going-out" process.
But this time it was different. I'm
in 15th grade now, and all the rules

seem to have changed without any
one bothering to send me home with
a ditto.
We had been going out for almost
a year when she walked into my
room. This time it wasn't just the
kissing thing — I had pretty much
hammered out all those problems
earlier. This time there were bold
metaphysical phrases ricocheting
around me. Words like "compati
ble," "independence" and "more pro
ficient sexual partner." This time
there were tears, snot and saliva.
Bodily fluids weren't nearly as
acceptable in eighth grade.
Eventually she left my room,
looking back with tears in her eyes
and slowly closing the door behind
her like Mary Tyler Moore in that
last episode. And I was left sitting on
the floor alone, incoherently mum
bling something about "true, meta

physical love" and "Joannie and
Chachi."
I knew right then that I should
have capitalized on the moment and
written a sonnet or a Journey song
or something, but I couldn't. It was
like some really fat guy had taken a
truncheon and pounded on my aorta
until it was all smushed into my left
ventricle ... or something like that.
But I realized I needed to get on
with my life; I needed new goals and
aspirations. I decided the best thing
to do was to stay in my room and
study all year so I could be a disgust
ingly wealthy corporate lawyer who
didn't give any of his money to any
one and told little children to get the
hell off the unused soccer field he
had built on his front lawn just so he
could yell at them. At night I'd write
tomes and tomes of extended
metaphors about a fly eternally

caught on one of those sticky paper
things. ...
But somewhere deep inside I
knew that wasn't healthy.
So I decided to convince myself
that she was right, that this would


Joel Stein
The Tao to Nowhere
be a positive experience for me.
I'd save gas by not driving to her
house in Palo Alto. I'd have more
time to catch up on the grueling
social agenda of Governor's Cor
ner. I wouldn't have to wash my
sheets as often.
Besides, she wasn't perfect.
There were plenty of things I was
glad to say good-bye to. For
instance, she was a terrible
bridge player. I mean, we'd be
waiting around for five minutes
before she'd look up and say:
"Oh, is it my turn?" And who
wants to deal with that, huh?
And I'd be on the rebound
now. I'd never been on the
rebound. Women from all over
campus would swoop over me to
pick up my remains, like some
defenseless road-kill who
couldn't struggle enough to shoo
them away. Something about
that kind of turned me on.
And I could date. I'd never
really dated before. I mean, now I
could just walk up to someone
and say: "Hey, let's go on a date,"
and before I knew it there we
would be, on a date and all and
doing date things like asking
each other if we had any brothers
or sisters and stuff like that.
I think I'd rather be forced to
watch that Beverly Hills 8675309
show each week.
So I decided to spiritually walk
it off. I figured I'd head over to
Blockbuster, rent "A Farewell to
Arms" and maybe pick up a cou
ple of liters of grappa on the way
back.
But as I opened the drawer to
get my keys, I noticed that her
blonde hair was still tangled in
my brush. And I realized I
wouldn't be able to go to Sears
and spend the day conning the
little nervous-looking woman
there to make an extra copy of
my keys. And I knew I'd have to
spend the year sleeping in a room
two doors down from where she
lived last year.
Actually, all of Stanford sud
denly reminded me of her. We
had such a Stanford relationship.
We hooked up at a dorm-trip
sleepover at the Dish. We did
dorm government together. We
read in each other's rooms and
biked to classes with each other.
We were the perfect Stanford
geeks.
But I knew I had to break out
of this self-pitying mode. My
drawmate's Chicago 17 album

was starting to imbue some kind
of cosmic meaning. I was rifling
through Cosmo articles looking
for answers. Books like "Co
dependent No More" didn't seem
like such a bad idea anymore.
This was exactly the kind of
junior-high-school trauma which
I had mocked in my youth. There
were ABC afterschool specials
and Shoebox greeting cards mar
keted just for my generic pain. I
had become one of the people I
used to spend Sunday nights hid
ing behind the bush next to the
Bridge in order to laugh at.
And now I understood so
much more of it. There was
something real, something
besides simply knowing what to
do and how to get over it. There
was a constant, nauseous feeling
in the pit of my stomach and a
constant struggle with my voice
to keep it from cracking or cry
ing.
No matter what I did or what I
told myself, I couldn't escape the
feeling of loss, the feeling of hav
ing to permanently let go of
something that made me feel so
good.
I had been happy for so long
that I forgot what it was like to
feel unhappy, to feel scared and
alone.
I've gone back to talk with her
a few times, and even though it
hurt to go over there, something
about it made me feel better than
I have for a while.
I think the worst of it was how
kind she still is to me and how
much she still cares. Or maybe
the worst of it is knowing that's
not enough.
Anyway, I can't go back there.
Not for a while. Not until I know
that I don't need her, that I can
feel all right on my own. That I'm
no longer depending on someone
who's not going to be there for
me.
So for now, I'm just going to
take my time getting there, and
try to have the best time I can
until then. And maybe one day
we'll get back together, or maybe
one day I won't want to.
Even though a part of me feels
dead, I also feel like I understand
so much more.
Sometimes, the pain is beauti
ful.

Joel Stein didn't believe that
whole Springsteen rumor for a
second. His column appears here
biweekly so Chris Harris can use
this space to immortalize epipha
nies like, "Y'know, the Stanford
band isn't all that funny."

with the idea that the whole kissing
thing was an integral part of the
"going-out" process.
But this time it was different. I'm
in 15th grade now, and all the rules

seem to have changed without any
one bothering to send me home with
a ditto.
We had been going out for almost
a year when she walked into my
room. This time it wasn't just the
kissing thing — I had pretty much
hammered out all those problems
earlier. This time there were bold
metaphysical phrases ricocheting
around me. Words like "compati
ble," "independence" and "more pro
ficient sexual partner." This time
there were tears, snot and saliva.
Bodily fluids weren't nearly as
acceptable in eighth grade.
Eventually she left my room,
looking back with tears in her eyes
and slowly closing the door behind
her like Mary Tyler Moore in that
last episode. And I was left sitting on
the floor alone, incoherently mum
bling something about "true, meta

physical love" and "Joannie and
Chachi."
I knew right then that I should
have capitalized on the moment and
written a sonnet or a Journey song
or something, but I couldn't. It was
like some really fat guy had taken a
truncheon and pounded on my aorta
until it was all smushed into my left
ventricle ... or something like that.
But I realized I needed to get on
with my life; I needed new goals and
aspirations. I decided the best thing
to do was to stay in my room and
study all year so I could be a disgust
ingly wealthy corporate lawyer who
didn't give any of his money to any
one and told little children to get the
hell off the unused soccer field he
had built on his front lawn just so he
could yell at them. At night I'd write
tomes and tomes of extended
metaphors about a fly eternally

caught on one of those sticky paper
things. ...
But somewhere deep inside I
knew that wasn't healthy.
So I decided to convince myself
that she was right, that this would


Joel Stein
The Tao to Nowhere
be a positive experience for me.
I'd save gas by not driving to her
house in Palo Alto. I'd have more
time to catch up on the grueling
social agenda of Governor's Cor
ner. I wouldn't have to wash my
sheets as often.
Besides, she wasn't perfect.
There were plenty of things I was
glad to say good-bye to. For
instance, she was a terrible
bridge player. I mean, we'd be
waiting around for five minutes
before she'd look up and say:
"Oh, is it my turn?" And who
wants to deal with that, huh?
And I'd be on the rebound
now. I'd never been on the
rebound. Women from all over
campus would swoop over me to
pick up my remains, like some
defenseless road-kill who
couldn't struggle enough to shoo
them away. Something about
that kind of turned me on.
And I could date. I'd never
really dated before. I mean, now I
could just walk up to someone
and say: "Hey, let's go on a date,"
and before I knew it there we
would be, on a date and all and
doing date things like asking
each other if we had any brothers
or sisters and stuff like that.
I think I'd rather be forced to
watch that Beverly Hills 8675309
show each week.
So I decided to spiritually walk
it off. I figured I'd head over to
Blockbuster, rent "A Farewell to
Arms" and maybe pick up a cou
ple of liters of grappa on the way
back.
But as I opened the drawer to
get my keys, I noticed that her
blonde hair was still tangled in
my brush. And I realized I
wouldn't be able to go to Sears
and spend the day conning the
little nervous-looking woman
there to make an extra copy of
my keys. And I knew I'd have to
spend the year sleeping in a room
two doors down from where she
lived last year.
Actually, all of Stanford sud
denly reminded me of her. We
had such a Stanford relationship.
We hooked up at a dorm-trip
sleepover at the Dish. We did
dorm government together. We
read in each other's rooms and
biked to classes with each other.
We were the perfect Stanford
geeks.
But I knew I had to break out
of this self-pitying mode. My
drawmate's Chicago 17 album

was starting to imbue some kind
of cosmic meaning. I was rifling
through Cosmo articles looking
for answers. Books like "Co
dependent No More" didn't seem
like such a bad idea anymore.
This was exactly the kind of
junior-high-school trauma which
I had mocked in my youth. There
were ABC afterschool specials
and Shoebox greeting cards mar
keted just for my generic pain. I
had become one of the people I
used to spend Sunday nights hid
ing behind the bush next to the
Bridge in order to laugh at.
And now I understood so
much more of it. There was
something real, something
besides simply knowing what to
do and how to get over it. There
was a constant, nauseous feeling
in the pit of my stomach and a
constant struggle with my voice
to keep it from cracking or cry
ing.
No matter what I did or what I
told myself, I couldn't escape the
feeling of loss, the feeling of hav
ing to permanently let go of
something that made me feel so
good.
I had been happy for so long
that I forgot what it was like to
feel unhappy, to feel scared and
alone.
I've gone back to talk with her
a few times, and even though it
hurt to go over there, something
about it made me feel better than
I have for a while.
I think the worst of it was how
kind she still is to me and how
much she still cares. Or maybe
the worst of it is knowing that's
not enough.
Anyway, I can't go back there.
Not for a while. Not until I know
that I don't need her, that I can
feel all right on my own. That I'm
no longer depending on someone
who's not going to be there for
me.
So for now, I'm just going to
take my time getting there, and
try to have the best time I can
until then. And maybe one day
we'll get back together, or maybe
one day I won't want to.
Even though a part of me feels
dead, I also feel like I understand
so much more.
Sometimes, the pain is beauti
ful.
