7 he Unseen Shore: Memories of
a Christian Science Childhood
Beacon Press, 173 pages,

Four years ago, in Thomas
Simmons' Freshman English
class, I remember understanding
for the first time what it meant to
love writing. The essays he
assigned us — personal essays —
helped me to make peace with the
difficult transitions from child
hood to early adulthood, from
Massachusetts to California, from
religion to something still yet
undefined.
But it was not the sentimental
ity of expressing myself, of sharing
my feelings, that affected me. The
grammar, the details, the verbs,
the punctuation, the tone — these
mattered immeasurably. They
were the instruments of respect
for my own ideas and experiences.
He understood, and taught me to
understand, that what is said and
felt is not abstract.
Simmons' unusual autobiogra
phy "The Unseen Shore: Memo
ries of a Christian Science Child
hood" exquisitely illustrates this
lesson once again. It is a spiritual
autobiography of a young man,
but it is also a tenderly expressed,
steely commentary on Christian
Science. And the narrative reads
like a novel, about the ordeals and
excitements of a contemporary
intellectual American youth.
It is an essay of a skilled story
teller. His class focused on E. B.
White and George Orwell, and his
writing reflects the influence of
them and others like them.
He gently winds in and out of
memories in loose chronological
and thematic order. Beginning
with a very particular moment
and place, on an island in Maine as

he is writing the hook, he sketches
the bones and sinews of what is to
come on the following pages. It is a
story of commitment and escape,
and an ultimately hopeful reflec
tion on the possibilities of humane
faith.
He grew up as the youngest of
three children in a Christian Sci
ence family, in which he suffered
the enormous contradictions of
that faith, embodied in his par
ents. In one passage, after describ
ing the extraordinary pain of a
normal, childhood ear infection

relate to physical experience — is

grounds, would not treat with
medication, he writes: "Because
my mother was an immensely
kind woman, it seems grotesque to
suggest that she was also cruel. . .
"The cruelty my mother inflict
ed on me, and on my brother and
sister, was scarcely intentional,
and the power of her love should
have reassured us that we were
precious in her sight. From a very
early age, however, we all knew
that we were suffering unneces
sarily, cruelly. . . . My mother's
kindness was genuine, but it did
not change the cruelty. What we
needed was freedom from a cruel
relationship, but this was impossi
ble. For behind my mother and
father stood the church and its
parental God, which enchained us
with its freedom."
The confusion of freedom,

kindness and cruelty — especially
as they relate to physical experi
ence — is the knot that his book
tries to untangle. He traces
threads of escape throughout his
life — his building of a model
Venice at age 6, an adventure in
Jerusalem that revealed the ten
tative, oblique affection of his
father, his motorcycle riding, his
girlfriends, his poetry. He discov
ers, in philosopher Philip Hallie's
words, "The opposite of cruelty is
not kindness. The opposite of cru
elty is freedom."
In his escapes, he gradually

and painfully loosens the bonds of
Christian Science and makes
them intelligible. He achieves in
his life what his mother only
knew in her painting — which she
gave up for religion and family
"sympathy with the imperfect
world within her and around
her."
Simmons' sympathy for the
world, though, is not abstract. It
takes its form in learning to love
particulars — places, poems,
people, bodies, colors. The per
fect abstractions of Christian
Science betrayed him and
betrayed his parents. His mother
died painfully of a curable can
cer, and his father, advised by a
Christian Science practitioner
and refusing to admit his wife
was mortal, was on a business
trip when she finally died.

Simmons spent his adoles
cent years in Palo Alto and
attended Stanford. Consequent
ly, much of the book takes place
nearby. His affection for this
landscape, for the freedom he
found on the coastal roads and
in the foothills, and his particu
lar friendships at Stanford, con
vey special meaning to anyone
who also knows this area.
He writes lovingly, and with
deep gratitude, about English
Prof. Ken Fields, and former
Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez,
who was a creative writing stu
dent with Simmons in the '70s.
His attentiveness to his spiritu
al and artistic life, and the lives
of those around him, bucks the
seemingly shallow, commercial

milieu of suburban Cali
fornia. He expands the
possibilities.
The book does not
teach or conclude. It
describes and suggests,
and in all of his firm
resistance to Christian
Science, Simmons
manages not to turn
bitterly upon faith in

God or the notion of a
divine presence. Indeed
he reaffirms it in his own terms
of particularities, imperfec
tions and affection.

This book might be diffi
cult for a reader without a
similar tolerance of or
desire for faith. But, it
would probably best serve
those very people. Sim
mons gives us a careful,
honest and poignant pro
file of a contemporary
spiritual struggle — not
far away in a monastery in
Germany or on the side of a

mountain in Nepal, but near us,
consisting of those things all
around us now.
