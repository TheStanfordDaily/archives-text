The Sum of All Fears

When Tom Clancy's newest techno-thriller
"The Sum of All Fears" hit the bookstores in
August, I was among the thousands of fans who
immediately ran out to buy it.
In the past, I would open a new Clancy novel
as soon as I laid my hands on it and read for three
hours before I realized any time had passed. But
it just didn't happen that way with Clancy's
newest release.
I had to force my way through the first 500 or
so pages. There were occasional great passages,
but too much of the book was devoted to Clancy's
poor attempt at character development.
In "The Sum of All Fears," Clancy again

demonstrates his uncanny ability to predict what
will be the hot foreign-policy issue when his novel
is released. For instance, "Clear and Present
Danger" focused on the drug war in South Amer
ica just as the U.S. government was working to
stop the supply of drugs coming in from Colom
bia.
This time the subject is peace in the Middle
East, and Jack Ryan —the hero of Clancy's last
four books — has conceived of a plan to settle
the differences between the Arab nations and
Israel. As the plan is being put into effect, Kvan
and the U.S. government must solve other crises
that threaten world peace.
The concept is actually quite creative and
fascinating to think about. Unfortunately,
rather than write a shorter, tighter book, Clan
cy drags the reader through meaningless bab
ble.
Every character ever mentioned in Clancy's
four previous books is somehow incorporated

into this one — many without any real pur
pose. Clancy also tries to develop Jack
Ryan as less of a hero by showing more of
his faults — and in doing so only makes
Ryan the perfect, repentant man in the
end.

Fans of the techno-thriller genre are
not looking for a literary masterpiece.
They simply want a creative look at
the military and the politics control
ling it. Clancy does that but often gets
lost in his attempts to increase the lit
erary quality of the book.
For readers who are already avid
fans of Clancy, "The Sum of All Fears"
is worth reading. But ifyou have never
before read any of his work, choose
another one to start out with — such
as "Patriot Games" or "The Cardinal
in the Kremlin" — before reading
Clancy's most recent work.
