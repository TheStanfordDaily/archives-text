# How not to look like a Brannerite

You are older then they are, and you should
know better.
You know that a Stanford sweatshirt,
shorts and L.A. Gear shoes add up to a gauche
outfit. You know that only freshmen and
freshmyn wear school-spirit drivel and shower
before class.
You are an upper-classman, and you've
been around the Quad — been through the
ringer, seen finals come and go, thrown up in
the bushes, written 15-page CIV papers in six
hours and lived through the horror that is
known as Calculus 41. So don't dress like a
naive freshman, because thankfully you aren't
one.
Avoiding frosh-dressing (much like cross
dressing, only not nearly as much fun) is actu
ally simple. It's all in your state of mind. All
you have to do is decide what you want to be.
The first and most popular option is the
hippie. Hippies are most commonly found
around Theta Chi recycling cans and talking
to bushes.
This style is cheap and easy, requiring only
cut-off jeans, a Grateful Dead T-shirt and a
pair of Birkenstocks. No underwear is
required, and you can wear the same clothes
every day without washing them. Of course,
your parents won't like you, and your dog
won't like your smell, but you'll seriously cut
down on laundry costs.
The Dieter look has long been a dependable
stand-by. Like the hippie, you don't need to be
creative to live this life. You can wear jeans,

slacks, skirts and leggings in a myriad of col
ors varying from dark gray to black, while top
options are black turtlenecks and black mock
turtlenecks.
Shoes are black leather with nifty, shiny
buckles. You must wear a vest and a long coat
when it is cold out — and when it is hot. The
cigaratte-in-corner-of-the-mouth completes
the look.
But problems crop up here too. Sudden
espresso cravings and feeling of spinning in a
shadowy pit of existential nothingness while
the world around you corrodes like ancient
Rome rule your existence.
Which would suck.
So there is another possibility. If you are
fortunate enough to be confidant in your fash
ion sense and in your relative importance in
the universe (i.e. none), you are ready to
embark on a much more ambitious and fulfill
ing fashion odyssey — Creative Dressing.
You Can Wear What You Want. This is the
cardinal rule and the only rule of creative
dressing. The philosophy is simple and crucial:

No matter what you wear, you are aware that
you wear it, you did it on purpose and the
clothes satisfy your Inner Agenda.
You don't actually have to have an inner
agenda; just appear like you do. In fashion, as
in life, things are always exactly what they
seem.
The possibilities are limitless. Wear, for
example, a fratty polo shirt, some black jeans
and a pair of Birkenstocks. This thunderous
combination speaks volumes about the wearer
— she is popular yet intelligent, career-orient
ed yet environmentally conscious. Most of all
she is complex, and oh so hip! She has created
her own style — her style — and she brings it
to every moment of her life. She is the antithe
sis of a frosh-dresser. Instead of obeying
norms, she creates them. Instead of being
defined, she defines.
Polyester is out, but you can wear it
because you know it is out and you wear it
anyway. This action says that you are so cool,
so rad in your inner self that you can existen
tially afford to dress in synthetic textiles.
The power of this fashion method is obvi
ous. With it you can even pull off the ultimate
clothing coup. You can frosh-dress and get
away with it. You aren't shackled with social
stigma, you are admired — because you can
dis, the whole freshman class without saying a
word. By just existing.
You are the master of dress; transcendent
over any one style, able to bend them all to
your slightest whim. The definitions and
stereotypes of campus life are now subject to
your control. And that, my friends, is cool.
