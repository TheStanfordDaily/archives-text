A picture was worth more than a thou
sand words for Cynthia Ng, the new Pro
gram Coordinator for the Asian American
Activities Center. It lead to a radical
change in her perspective and a career
serving the Asian American community.
After viewing a national broadcast of
American troops in Vietnam in 1971, Ng
found herself shaken by one horrific
image: a woman clutching a child with

one hand and running as her back shot up
in flames.
"Besides communicating the brutality
of the war, I think the picture also really
pricked my Asian consciousness. I
remember thinking, 'Wait a second .. .
these are my people.' Despite all the talk
about the domino theory, this picture
really summed up what they were actual

a conservative suburb of Alameda county
and initially supported the Vietnam war.

A student at UC-Berkeley, Ng then
became involved with campus war
protests and helped form the Asian-Amer

which sparked the formation of one of the
first Asian-American student unions in
the country.
From there, she embarked on a career
dedicated to the Asian-American commu

serving as an Asian issues adviser and

speech writer for New York Mayor David
Dinkins.
Ng describes her first few weeks at
Stanford as a "refreshing" change from
government bureaucracy. "There's a
sense of activity. . . . Students seem to
believe that you can change anything,
which is true if you organize yourselves in
the right way," she said, adding that
working with the younger generation
gives her a sense of optimism for future
change.

"We were looking for a person with a
lot of professional experience working in
the Asian-American community," said
Rick Yuan, Dean of the Asian American
Activities Center, which sponsors such
annual events as Lunar New Year, Her
itage Celebration and Day of Remem
brance. The center also serves as a meet
ing place for various campus groups.
