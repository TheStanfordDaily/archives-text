# Asian-American coordinator adds to cultural community
## 
### Carrie Chang 
A picture was worth more than a thou
sand words for Cynthia Ng, the new Pro
gram Coordinator for the Asian American
Activities Center. It lead to a radical
change in her perspective and a career
serving the Asian American community.
After viewing a national broadcast of
American troops in Vietnam in 1971, Ng
found herself shaken by one horrific
image: a woman clutching a child with

one hand and running as her back shot up
in flames.
"Besides communicating the brutality
of the war, I think the picture also really
pricked my Asian consciousness. I
remember thinking, 'Wait a second .. .
these are my people.' Despite all the talk
about the domino theory, this picture
really summed up what they were actual
ly doing," recalls Ng, who had grown up in
a conservative suburb of Alameda county
and initially supported the Vietnam war.

A student at UC-Berkeley, Ng then
became involved with campus war
protests and helped form the Asian-Amer
ican branch of the anti-war movement,
which sparked the formation of one of the
first Asian-American student unions in
the country.
From there, she embarked on a career
dedicated to the Asian-American commu
nity, becoming involved in projects rang
ing from helping Chinatown's elderly to
serving as an Asian issues adviser and

speech writer for New York Mayor David
Dinkins.
Ng describes her first few weeks at
Stanford as a "refreshing" change from
government bureaucracy. "There's a
sense of activity. . . . Students seem to
believe that you can change anything,
which is true if you organize yourselves in
the right way," she said, adding that
working with the younger generation
gives her a sense of optimism for future
change.

"We were looking for a person with a
lot of professional experience working in
the Asian-American community," said
Rick Yuan, Dean of the Asian American
Activities Center, which sponsors such
annual events as Lunar New Year, Her
itage Celebration and Day of Remem
brance. The center also serves as a meet
ing place for various campus groups.
"The role of program coordinator
entails developing student organi
zations, providing cultural infor
mation and bridging the gap
between students and the overall
community. We saw Cindy as
being able to fulfill that role," he
explained.
While working in Chinatown,
Ng helped form tenant associa
tions to counter grim housing con
ditions and skyrocketing rents.
"A lot of Chinatown houses
were built at the turn of the cen

tury and are very run-down. The
landlords charge exorbitant rents.
You have to pay three thousand
dollars just to rent the apartment
and sometimes they don't even
provide any heat or warm water,"
said Ng, who also helped organize
Sunday night dinners tor China
town's elderly while in San Fran
cisco.
"As a clear example of the gov
ernment's lack of cultural under
standing, you can look at the food
they would provide: a can of grits.
What is an 80-year-old Chinese
woman going to do with a can of
grits?"
Driven by the need for Asians

in government and Jesse Jack
son's message of empowerment
for people of all colors, Ng helped
set up the Asians for Jesse Jack
son committee in 1984 and went
on to work for Dinkins after the
election.
As a political adviser in a city
embroiled in racial tensions, Ng
was able to witness first-hand
many of the hate crimes against
Asians which were on the rise and
some of the stereotypes that
fueled them.
"There was actually one com
munity that waged a campaign to
convince people not to sell their
houses to Asians," Ng said.
