# Creating a Stanford classic
## 
### Josh Walker 
The seething crowd parted
for the dark-clad figure, who
began twirling and slashing a
gleaming scimitar, preparing to
disembowel the archaeologist's
haggard form. But Indy merely
shrugged, pulled out his pistol
and shot.
The quest for the lost ark
was renewed.
Tomorrow night, it will con
tinue once again.
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"
will launch us into the realm of
Classic Flicks, a new Friday
night extension of everybody's
favorite movie-going journey,
ASSU Sunday Flicks.
An ASSU business project
headed by Jason Moore, these
films are in actuality recent

classics, covering a time period
of the '60s, '70s and early '80s,
with some crossovers from ear
lier years.
According to Moore, the
Stanford Theatre takes care of
true classics perfectly, and
Classic Flicks are meant for dif
ferent viewing.
"We want to hit a section
(of films) that a lot of students
want to see without having to
rent them."
He went on to say that eco
nomically, Classic Flicks are
superior to renting as well.
"For $10 you get eight
films. To rent those it would
cost $27," he said, noting that
because of Centennial events,
there will be fewer flicks this
fall than in future quarters.
"And you get the big screen

experience," he added.
Quarterly Classic Flicks
passes are on sale at the
Tresidder Ticket Office for
$10, with tickets also avail
able at the door. The movies
will be shown in Cubberley
Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. As
the year goes on, the ASSU
hopes to hold two screenings
per night.
Classic Flicks will kick off
tomorrow night with "Raiders
of the Lost Ark" and in follow
ing weeks will include "Rebel
Without a Cause," "Mary Pop
pins," "The Shining," "North
By Northwest," "The Blues
Brothers," "Hoosiers" and "It's
A Wonderful Life."
So grab your whips, don
your fedoras and ready your
self for Classic Flicks.
