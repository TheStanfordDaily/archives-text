# 'Super' will work better on cable

"The Super" is one of those
lukewarm movies that keeps
you generally entertained while
you're sitting in the theater, but
once outside you think back to
the price tag and realize that at
$7 a pop, your money would be
better spent on something else
For example, two movie
rentals. But for my money, $3 is
even a bit too much for "The
Super."
Don't get me wrong â€” it's
not as unforgivably bad as "The
Lemon Sisters," for instance. In
fact, there's some truly hysteri
cal moments that are funny

enough to grab your attention
and hold it through all the other
failings of the movie. But the
plot is as predictable as a traffic
light, and much of the storyline
is unbelievable to the point of
ridiculousness.
Joe Pesci, best known for his
Academy Award-winning role in
"Goodfellas," stars as Louie
Kritski, a slumlord who fla
grantly ignores his tenants'
nearly uninhabitable living con
ditions in order to graft as much
from them as possible.
But Naomi Bensinger
(Madolyn Smith Osborne), a
housing authority lawyer,
tracks him down and brings him
to court, where for some reason,
the judge sentences him to live

in his own building until the sit
uation is remedied.
From here, the comedy takes
off running. Although the back
ground storyline is boring at
best, and further tainted by
sappy and weak sentiment, the
individual scenes themselves are
quite hilarious. Pesci does a
great job of making the audience
laugh, and director Rod Daniel
sets up some intriguingly
unique camera angles and close
ups to back him up.
"The Super" is a good find if
you're looking for something
mindlessly light and funny. But
if you're bothered by pre
dictability, hollow sentiment
and lack of substance, look else
where.
