# Haas director to launch national service group
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla 
The director of the Haas Pub
lic Service Center, Catherine
Milton, was appointed Monday to
be the executive director of the
federal Committee on National
and Community Service.
She will be in Washington,
D.C. until Dec. 31 to oversee the
committee, which wa9 recently
established by the federal govern
ment to promote the concept of
public service nationwide. It will
distribute funds to local agencies
and states to help support com
munity service programs.
Milton's job will be to initiate
every aspect of the program,
from looking for an office and
staff to establishing plans for
using the committee's $22 mil
lion budget.
She said she will set up "an
honest program and allow for
creativity."
Among her priorities are
insuring that the grants dis
tributed support community ser
vice at the grassroots level and
finding new ways to promote
public service.
University President Donald
Kennedy and Milton's co-work
ers praised the appointment.
Kennedy, who has worked
with Milton for eight years, cited
"her work and personal reputa
tion" as reasons for her appoint
ment. "That includes the Haas
Center but also Campus Com
pact," a group of 250 college and

university presidents working to
increase the number of under
graduates involved in public ser
vice, he added.
"Catherine Milton has for the
past seven years been a national
leader in public service, so it is
the perfect appointment for
her," said Asst. Haas Director
Megan Swezey.
Tim Stanton, associate Haas
director, said Milton's appoint
ment is a "great honor," but that
her time in Washington will be "a
temporary loss" for the center.
Milton said she was probably
appointed to the post because of
her experience in public service
at Stanford and nationwide.
Another factor was probably the
fact that she worked in Washing
ton for 15 years, she added.
Milton came to Stanford in
1983 as a special assistant to
Kennedy with the specific task of
evaluating the state of public ser
vice here. She has been director
of the Haas center since its cre
ation in 1985.
The Committee on National
and Community Service was
established by the National and
Community Service Act of 1990
— the result of a compromise
between members of Congress
interested in public service.
Committee chair Pete
McCloskey, a retired congress
man for the 12th District of Cal
ifornia, which includes Stanford,
approached Milton with the offer
of the position.
