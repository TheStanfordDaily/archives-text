# Budget cuts reduce Meyer periodicals
## 
### Brad Jacobson 
Students looking for periodi
cals in Meyer Library are feeling
the sting of budget cuts, but
library officials say the real cuts
are yet to be made.
Meyer drastically reduced the
size of its periodical section this
fall, cutting the number of sub

scriptions from 342 to 55 and
angering many students.
"It's not something we wanted
to do," said Meyer Chief Librarian
Mike Miller. "It is a major erosion
of service."
The reduction is part of an 18-
month budget cutting process
begun during spring 1990 before
adminstrators understood the

depth of budget woes to come.
Library officials warn that the
cuts could be even deeper in the
upcoming round of budget reduc
tions.
That series of cuts, which will
be made during the next few
years, will likely take an extra 7 to
13 percent of the library budget
on top of the 16 percent "reposi

tioning" reduction, Miller said.
"Any cuts by repositioning pale
next to what will be coming in the
next go around," said Miller. "The
whole idea of Meyer as an under
graduate library may go under, as
Meyer might be merged with
Green."
The periodical reduction, which
saved more than $25,000, means
that many newspapers and maga
zines that used to be in Meyer can
now only be found in Green
Library.
Student reaction to the move
was strong. On a comment board
provided by the Library, one student
wrote, "This used to be one of my
favorite spots on campus. Now?"
Another wrote, "It doesn't
seem like this university cares
anymore...."
Miller said he sympathizes with
these comments. But he added
that he has a hard time reacting to
comments like, "$23,000 a year for
this! I'm extremely angry."
"We don't see that money," he
said.
Last year Meyer had to reduce
its reference hours and cut three
librarians and two-and-a-half
other stafT positions — including
the periodical manager — due to
the cuts.
"We tried to make cuts trans
parent to the campus," Miller said.
Since all the periodicals which
used to be in Meyer are in Green
Library, some students think the
move is not such a big deal. One
wrote, "Quit your whining and go
to Green. It's only 50 yards away!"
