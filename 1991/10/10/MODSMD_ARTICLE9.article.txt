ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A Naval Academy
midshipman who publicly questioned Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney about military policy
barring homosexuals was counseled later by
academy officials, a spokesman said Wednesday.
Cheney defended the policy Tuesday night
during a speech at the academy after Ernest
Miller asked him, "Do you have the courage to
discard this bit of a chestnut?"
Cheney said there is no question the policy
discriminates against homosexuals because it
isn't based on performance. It is also painful for
homosexuals who have served well in the armed
forces, he said.
Yeltsin government shaky
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin's Russian
government shook with charges of infighting
Wednesday after two key ministers resigned
and a deputy prime minister backtracked on
support for a new economic union.
The disarray threatened to paralyze the gov
ernment at a time when the country desperate
ly needs economic reform and Western aid.
Mideast talks still questionable
JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S.-Israeli relations
are stumbling from one quarrel to another —
over settlements, immigration aid, the peace
process and now the accusation that Israeli war
planes overflew Iraq.
Israeli officials are not concealing their dis
may at the nasty change to come over what has
been, for years, a close political and military
alliance.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's critics say
his government is to blame because it is ignor
ing American pleas to freeze settlement con
struction in the occupied territories.
But officials close to Shamir claim the Unit
ed States, in its eagerness to lure the Arabs to a
Mideast peace conference, is grabbing any pre
text to placate the Arabs by coming down hard
on Israel.
