KEPLER'S PRESENTS
MICKEY HART
Sunday, October 13
3:30 - 5:00 p.m.
Mickey Hart will be signing copies of his new
book, PLANET DRUM
"Underneath the world's extraordinary musical diversity is another,
deeper realm in which there is no better or worse, no modern or primitive,
no art music versus folk music, no distinctions at all, but rather an almost
organic compulsion to translate the emotional fact of being alive into
sound, into rhythm, into something you can dance to"
—from the preface by Mickey Hart
