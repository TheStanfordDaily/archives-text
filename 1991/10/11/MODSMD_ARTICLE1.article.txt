Discussion of imminent bud
get cuts continued to dominate
the Faculty Senate yesterday as
members discussed the effects of
the cuts on administrative ser
vices, research and scholarship,
and graduate education.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner, chair of the committee's
task force on administrative ser
vices, said administrative budgets
are not as bloated as is commonly
believed. Several faculty have
said administrative services
should be the first to be cut.
Comparing Stanford's outlays
on administrative services to
those of other universities, Kras
ner said, "The figures don't sug
gest that Stanford is way out of
line."
Faculty continued to press
Provost James Rosse to examine
non-operating areas of Stanford's
consolidated budget in order to
reduce the severity of the cuts on
the operating budget.
Rosse said the Board of
Trustees will "take another look
at" its policy of reinvesting rental
income from Stanford Shopping
Center into the endowment.
Later in the meeting he said
auxiliary budgets such as the
Department of Athletics and
Housing and Food Services "are
being looked at ... to the extent
that general funds are going into
their budgets."
Krasner and Chemistry Prof.
James Collman said faculty need
to look closer to home in making
recommendations for cuts. Coll
man said the committee should
consider the possibility of early
retirement of faculty. Krasner
