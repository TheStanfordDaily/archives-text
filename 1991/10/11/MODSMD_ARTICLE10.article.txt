"Jeremiah" hasn't told his parents yet. But he's
ready to tell his friends at Stanford.
Jeremiah, a gay freshman who plans to participate
in National Coming Out Day today, asked that his real
name not be used, yet.
Coming out day is intended to make it less difficult
for gays, lesbians and bisexuals to proclaim their sexu
al orientation.
"Coming Out Day makes it a whole lot easier since
it seems to be a community effort," Jeremiah said.
"Quite a few people are still 'in the closet,' and today
gives them an opportunity" to acknowledge their sex
uality publicly, he said.
Jeremiah came out to friends in high school. "Luck
ily my friends were very accepting of my decision," he
said. "I find it hard now, because, as a freshman, I am
still used to this high school unacceptance thing."
He found community in the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center and said it has allowed
him freedom of choice with his sexuality.

"Stanford is an excellent place for people to come out
considering the publicity given to the gay and lesbian
community. People aren't so scared of it anymore."
Rachel Maddow, a lesbian sophomore, came out in
The Daily last year. The article was printed on a Mon
day, and the following Friday — Coming Out Day —
Rachel planned on telling her parents. However, the
article was sent anonymously to them without her
knowledge. "It was really bad," Maddow said. "I guess
it was bad timing on my part."
Jeremiah said coming out to friends in high school
was the best thing he ever did for himself. "The best
way to get used to homosexuality is to expose (your
self)," he said. "The only thing is, even after you have
made the decision to put yourself on the line, you still
have to put up with everyone's crap."
Tonight in the Coffee House, a Queerland "Be-In"
is planned, and "since most of the people there are
going to be homosexual, other people are going to have
to get up and leave to avoid being thought of as gay,"
said Maddow. "Perhaps that will make people re-eval
uate their stance on homosexuality."
