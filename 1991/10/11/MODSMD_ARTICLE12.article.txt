Honecker makes no apologies
BERLIN (AP) — Former East German lead
er Erich Honecker, in an interview broadcast
yesterday, said the border guards who fatally
shot people escaping to the West were just doing
their duty.
Honecker, who has been charged with issu
ing the shoot-to-kill orders, said he would
return to Germany only if the government
promised not to prosecute him. "I do not intend
to make myself available to the angels of
revenge," he said.
German Justice Minister Klaus Kinkel
rejected that demand, saying the 79-year-old
Honecker must be brought to justice for the
"unjust regime" he led for 18 years.
Ape to sow wild bananas in NYC
NEW YORK (AP) — Animal rights activists
are going ape over a plan to turn a monogamist
into a swinging single. Timmy, a lowlands goril
la who's happily attached in Cleveland, is head
ed to the Big Apple to mate with four potential
new friends.
While this sounds like good news for Timmy
— at 33 years old and 500 pounds, he's not a
real looker — some folks believe the change in
surroundings will have the ape climbing the
walls. Timmy is due at the Bronx Zoo next
month to begin his simian sexcapades.
"It's time we started realizing animals do
have family situations and emotional ties, that
they are not simply objects or things," said Dr.
Elliot Katz, head of the California-based rights
group In Defense of Animals.
Boy loses fight over ponytail
BASTROP, Texas (AP) — A judge yesterday
dismissed a lawsuit filed by a boy fighting school
officials over his ponytail.
School officials last year removed Zachariah
Toungate, 9, from his third-grade classroom
because he refused to cut his wispy ponytail.
He and his mother, September, sued the Bas
trop Independent School District, contending
the school's hair length policy amounted to sex
discrimination because it applied only to boys.
