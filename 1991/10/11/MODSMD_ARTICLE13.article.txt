THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) — Yugoslavia's army agreed
in principle yesterday to with
draw from Croatia within a
month, and Croat militants
pledged to lift their blockades of
army barracks in the secessionist
republic.
The combatants agreed to
negotiate a political settlement to
the civil war that would address
the grievances of the Serb minor
ity in Croatia, said Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek,
who announced the agreement.
Van den Broek spoke after five
hours of talks with the leaders of
Croatia, Serbia and the federal
military at a European Commu
nity-led peace conference in The
Hague.
The accord appeared to offer
the best chance yet for halting the
three-and-a-half-month-old civil
war in Croatia, which has pitted
Croat militants against ethnic
Serb guerrillas supported by Ser
bia and the Serb-dominated fed
eral army.
But it was unclear whether the
latest peace agreement would be
observed by fighters in the battle
field, who have ignored eight pre
vious cease-fires.
More than 600 people are
known to have died since June 25,
when Croatia declared indepen

dence along with neighboring
Slovenia. Croatia reported more
casualties from clashes Thursday
in the eastern part of the repub
lic.
There was no indication the
accord immediately addressed the
most critical issue raised by Croa
tia's independence drive: the sta
tus of the ethnic Serb minority
that makes up 12 percent of Croa
tia's population.
Serbia demands that any inde
pendent Croatia give Serb-domi
nated areas within its territory
the right of self-determination.
Croatia insists that it will
accept no border changes and is
loath to give ethnic Serbs full
autonomy, fearing they would be
absorbed by the Serbian republic
— leaving Croatia shrunken and
weak.
Just which areas would be con
sidered Serb-dominated is also
unclear, since in parts of Croatia,
Serbs are numerous, but not in
the majority.
Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman said he accepted the
agreement.
Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic called the one-month
deadline "a realistic framework"
but added that all parties in the
crisis must "fully contribute to
the settlement."
