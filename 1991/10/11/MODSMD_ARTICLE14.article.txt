## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Sen

showdown between Clarence Thomas
and the woman accusing him of sexu
al harassment. At stake is his bitterly
fought nomination to the Supreme
Court.
The Senate Judiciary Committee
subpoenaed witnesses while Republi
can and Democratic members negoti
ated over whether Thomas or his
accuser, Oklahoma law professor
Anita Hill, would be questioned first
when the hearings begin Friday.
"He knows it's been terribly dam

aging but he wants to do what he can
to clear this cloud off his character,"
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
will act as Thomas' chief Senate
defender in the hearings.
Hill spent Thursday consulting
with her quickly formed legal team,
said Louise Hilsen, a publicist
retained to be her spokeswoman dur
ing the hearings. Hill's parents and
two brothers were arriving to be with
her in the hearing room Friday.
President Bush, meanwhile, con
tinued to express support for his
choice to succeed Thurgood Marshall

on the nation's highest court.
"I support him 100 percent," the
president said. However, he added,
"I'm simply not going to inject myself
into what's going on in the Senate."
The panel could hear testimony
through the weekend before the Sen
ate votes at 6 p.m. Tuesday on the
troubled nomination.
The hearing's format will be dif
ferent from the usual committee
arrangement in which the 14 mem
bers take turns asking questions.
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the

panel's chairman, and Sens. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., a former prosecutor,
and Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a for
mer judge, will ask questions for the
Democrats.
Hatch will question Thomas while
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., former
Philadelphia district attorney, will
question Hill, aides said.
Two witnesses whom Hill once
told her allegations of sexual harass
ment were among those subpoenaed
to testify, said sources familiar with
the arrangements.
