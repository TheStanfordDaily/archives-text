The Band struck a sore
cord for many but owes
no apology for its antics

IS IT TIME FOR THE Stanford
Band to change its tune? Its
recent public apology after the
Stanford-Notre Dame game seems to
suggest it may be. Perhaps years of
noisy criticism that these music mak
ers are too mischievous and not dedi
cated enough to the rituals of football
have finally worn down their will.
We hope not.
The Band has always suffered its
share of fussy naysayers clucking
disapproval. During last week's
game, the hallowed tradition of ver
bal abuse extended to physical
assault, as an overzealous fan made
clear her objections to one mem
ber's costume. She jumped from the
crowd, assaulted the drum major
dressed as a nun and told him he
was going to hell for his actions.
The Band's dark habit of bor
derline humor is nothing new; in
the past, the band's peripatetic
high jinks have been attacked for
insensitively parodying both envi
ronmentalists and loggers, for
whimsically bandying about sym
bols ranging from the Menorah to
the Spotted Owl.
This is one of the Band's most
established trademarks: absolute
irreverence. Nothing is sacred.
When Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney attended the
Stanford-Colorado game during
the Centennial, for example, the
band paid tribute to the secession
ist people of Quebec.
Some may question the appro
priateness of such actions, but at
their core they are not mean-spir
ited. And, for the most part, they
are entertaining.
When the Band selects a target for
satire, both sides are equally mocked.
During last week's performance both
Christianity and Judaism were sati
rized. The pregame show featured an
Hasidic rabbi carrying a Menorah

and the half-time performance, a
nun holding a cross.
It may have been painful to
some, but satire and the exercise of
free speech invariably are.
The Band is also roundly criti
cized by some athletic supporters
for its insufficiently respectful
attitude toward football. To some
this is a far greater apostasy than
besmirching religious images.
And, true, in many universities,
the role of the band is that of obe
dient handmaiden, accompanying
her more muscular brethren onto
the football field to provide a
cheerful, euphonious background
for crushing the competition. In
this view, if the Band acted like a
real marching band, it would be
much easier for the football team
to lead Stanford to victory.
However, we can hardly blame the
Band for the football team's medi
ocrity. Arguing the Band's zany
antics reflect poorly on the Athletics
Department overstates the group's
influence. Stanford's band marches
to the beat of different drummers. Its
function is not to be the Vienna Boys'
Choir. It is to provide crowd enter
tainment. The yell leaders fulfill the
more serious function, and even they
are routinely subjected to taunts
from the Stanford community.
The Band represents a part of
Stanford â€” its whimsical, fun-lov
ing side, struggling to break
through the pressures of academics,
pre-professionalism and the relent
less pursuit of high achievement.
It is also worth noting that the
Band is one of the most diverse stu
dent groups on campus. The com
mon bond is a firm commitment to
maintaining a light, free-spirited
attitude in all its performances.
It may well be the merry min
strels are no more than the glue
that keeps Stanford students
tacky. But we appreciate their will
ingness to inject irreverence into
our staid academic lives.
The Band is one of the few light
hearted constants in the hectic
world of Stanford.
In these times, we stand by our
band.
