Presidential Selection Committee cheats students

WE, THE UNDERSIGNED gradu
ate students of Stanford, were
greatly dismayed and disap
pointed over the proposed composition
of the Presidential Selection Committee.
This extremely important committee
will have many trustees and faculty, but
only one student. Under the charge
given to the ASSU Nominations Com
mittee, this student must be a current
Stanford graduate student who also
received his or her undergraduate degree
from Stanford.
To say this will provide a limited per
spective is an understatement. It seems
impossible and unreasonable for a single
student to adequately represent the con
cerns of this extraordinarily diverse
campus. Moreover, to limit this position
to a student who has had little or no
experience in any collegiate academic
setting outside of Stanford is short
sighted and unwise.
Two examples from recent presiden

tial searches at other universities come
to mind. Brown University, in the
search that produced Vartan Gregorian,
placed two students on the search com
mittee; Brown is considerably smaller
than Stanford. Harvard elected not to
have any students on its search commit
tee, sparking much student discontent.
However, Harvard is noted among many
of its graduates for paying little heed to
the concerns of its students.
Stanford, on the other hand, prides
itself on the partnership between stu
dents, faculty and administration. In
fact, we were informed that Stanford's
last presidential search had nearly equal
input from students, faculty, alumni and
trustees. At this crucial juncture in
Stanford history, it seems important to
renew and strengthen that partnership.
One way to do this is to allow more stu
dents to sit on the search committee.
Both graduate and undergraduate
students should be involved. And since

there is such a difference in perspectives
between the humanities and sciences,
there should be one student from each
area. We propose that at least four stu
dents be placed on the committee, two
graduates and two undergraduates.
Among the two graduate student repre
sentatives, one should be from the sci
ences and one from the humanities.
In addition, it seems important to
make use of a so-called "head-hunter"
organization, especially given the nega
tive publicity that Stanford has received
recently. The current process assumes
that all qualified individuals will apply to
the committee, or at least will be found
by the committee and be persuaded to
apply. This will indubitably shrink the
applicant pool considerably.
The committee may not know all quali
fied potential applicants. Also, many tal
ented individuals who might have found
Stanford intriguing during its more fiscal
ly sound years may be dissuaded by our

current financial predicament. A head
hunter would expand the applicant pool
and help ensure that we get the best per
son to lead Stanford into the 21st century.
Stanford has a vested interest in cre
ating a credible presidential search pro
cess that avoids even the appearance of
impropriety. Already, there are rumors
afloat that the trustees have decided on
the outcome of the search and wish to
minimize dissent on the committee. The
current plan for student representation
on the committee seems to support
those rumors.
We ask that the trustees reconsider
their plans for the composition of the
search committee. The last thing Stanford
needs right now is another controversy.
