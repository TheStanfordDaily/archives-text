# Quote unfairly blasted Stanford Greek system
## 
### 
We were shocked to see the inclusion
of resident Assistant Chris Arriola's
prejudiced statement in The Daily on
Oct. 3, concerning the unfortunate inci
dent at Casa Zapata. While the alleged
rape is a serious issue, it certainly
should not be used as an opportunity for
fraternity bashing.
The article included the following
exchange between Arriola and the alleged
rapist, Stuart Thomas: "Arriola said that
he was a little worried about freshmen
going out to frat parties; especially since
the theme of the first frat party seemed
to be to get the freshmen women drunk
and take sexual advantage of them." The
article continues, "Thomas agreed, saying
that he used to be a member of a frat."

Clearly, the issue of fraternity parties
or fraternity membership is not relevant
in this situation. The incident occurred
in a theme house. The individuals
involved had not been to a fraternity
party that night, and the alcohol con
sumed was not distributed by a fraterni
ty. Thomas, while he may have belonged
to a fraternity at another school, is not
affiliated with any Stanford fraternity.
The inclusion of the Arriola quote is
perhaps the most irresponsible journal
istic exercise witnessed in The Daily in
our memory. It creates an association in
the mind of the reader between sexual
assault and fraternities. It is a conve
nient way of oversimplifying a complex
issue and assigning blame to a tradition
al scapegoat.
