# Cutting Drama Dept. would prove tragic
## 
### 
In yesterday's editorial, The Daily rec
ommended that "the Department of
Drama should be dismantled and some of
its money given to student groups." The
intent of this suggestion is admirable but
was made in ignorance of the way the
arts function here, and to follow this sug
gestion would be an unmitigated disaster.
The Daily has undoubtedly focused on
the large student attendance at produc
tions by Ram *8 Head or the Black Per
forming Arts compared to the small atten
dance at Drama Department productions
and has concluded the department is dead
weight. But the dynamic, widely enjoyed
student theater would greatly diminish or
disappear without the Drama Department.
Many students remember Ram's Head's

outstanding production of "Into the Woods"
from last spring. But that show was directed
by a drama mqjor with honors in directing.
The set was designed by a drama major,
built with department equipment in depart
ment facilities. The list goes on.
Stanford's flourishing dorm theater
would also suffer without the Drama
Department. The knowledge to maintain
these organizations and a mfyor source
of their supplies would vanish.
As a closing note, the Departments of
Music and Art are no less indispensable.
The dependence of Ram's Head, the a
cappella community and the community
at large on these departments cannot be
emphasized strongly enough. While the
artistic community expects to bear its fair
share of the oncoming cuts, to completely
remove a artistic department
would be a folly of the highest order.
