# 'It was ... where destiny touches you on a shoulder.'
## Exploring depths of a tragic life Professor's book made waves, now claims successes

Ten years ago, on her birth
day, Stanford English Prof.
Diane Middlebrook received
what is probably the best pre
sent she has ever gotten — an
invitation to write a best
selling biography of poet Anne
Sexton.
"It was one of those won
derful things where destiny
touches you on a shoulder,"
Middlebrook said. "I received
a letter from the editor at
Houghton-Mifflin company. It
was just out of the blue,
because I had never written a
biography."
Now, a decade later, "Anne
Sexton: A Biography" has
spent five weeks on The New
York Times bestseller list and
earned Middlebrook a Nation
al Book Award nomination.
"It was a fabulous project,"
Middlebrook said. "(Sexton's)
was a very interesting career,
a woman who had risen
against all odds to become a
great American artist."
The biography, which
included stories of drug and
alcohol abuse, sexual assault,
insanity and — above all —
art, details the life of Sexton,
who ended her life in 1974.
Sexton proclaimed she was
the "only confessional poet."
"First of all, Anne Sexton
was a great salesman, so she
would say that," Middlebrook
said of Sexton's claim. "But
there was an element of truth
in that too, because Anne Sex
ton wasn't ashamed of her ill
ness, wasn't afraid of her sex
uality."

Anne Sexton. A controversy developed when Sexton's psychiatrist gave Middle

use of the tapes.
warned against thinking Anne
Sexton *8 poems tell Anne Sex
ton's life. "People always find a
person when they read a poem,
and think they know a lot about
the person from what the poem
says," Middlebrook said. "Anne
Sexton uses that to draw the
reader in. Anne Sexton said 'I
write very personal poetry, but
not very personal about myself.'"
Middlebrook, who continued
teaching during seven out of the
10 years she spent on the book,
said she was surprised at the
amount of time and effort she had
to put into discovering "the thou
sands of homely particulars that
make up an actual life."
Six years into the process, for
example, Middlebrook had "already
done immense amounts of research"
and written most of the book. It was
at that point that she received taped
transcripts of Sexton's therapy ses
sions with Martin Orne, Sexton's
psychiatrist for eight years.
"I did already know what Anne
Sexton thought was important
about her treatment through her
notebooks," Middlebrook said. "I
didn't learn any secrets."
What Middlebrook did gain
from the tapes was a new under
standing of Sexton as a person.

"There she was, sitting between
my ears and basically passing
through my body," Middlebrook
said. "She would just come in and
start gossiping about her life and her
children, the basically hum-drum
details that biographers are insa
tiable for. I learned all the thingß you
can learn from listening to a voice."
The use of the tapes has placed
Middlebrook and her book at the
center of a controversy involving
doctor-patient privilege. Opponents
of the use of the tapes say that Orne
had no right to turn the tapes over
to Middlebrook. Middlebrook con
tends that, especially since she had
permission of the family, she had a
right to hear the tapes.
"Living people have privacy
rights that persist through their
lifetimes," Middlebrook said. "I
do not believe the dead do."
Middlebrook said Anne Sexton
would have been happy with all
the publicity and controversy
about her biography. "I'd love for
Anne Sexton to sit in this chair
and say 'here are some secrets
about me you didn't find out,'"
Middlebrook said, "but you've
really written a good book, Diane."
And what are Middlebrook's
plans for the future?
"I am courting my next sub
ject, who is living, but she has not
yet accepted," Middlebrook said.
"I think I'm a fool to do it,
because living people can change
their minds at the end."
