## Joan Pong Linton Cheers to a good day on the Farm 
### 
WHEN I WALKED INTO 60-61 A
that Monday morning, Septem
ber 23, a small crowd of students
was gathered by the door, reading the
course status announcements and peer
ing into the room now and then.
It was the first day of Freshman
English course scheduling changes, and I
was one of five assigned to duty. Already
Priscilla Williams, the department's
administrative assistant, had the comput
er terminals up and running. She even had
tea, coffee and doughnuts waiting for us.
As I sat at a terminal going through the
procedure I'd learned, I wondered how
much help we would be to the hopeful faces
out there. Most of the fall courses were
closed; only a few lucky ones would find a
course assignment. The best we could do
was to show the students the evidence on
the screen, to impress on them the finality
of their situation. Or so I thought.
Panic struck at 9 a.m. when the stu
dents started coming in. But to my relief,
they were veiy polite and understanding as
I struggled with unfamiliar computer com
mands. Some offered to help, and after a
while even I got the hang of it. What's
more, we were actually able to enroll some
students as courses opened up after other
students dropped them, or as students
switched courses with one another. A few
also enrolled in winter or spring classes.
My most spectacular success had to be
the student who had a series of interlock

ing time conflicts. She could take French
if she dropped Freshman English; but
she would be able to take both if she
switched to another CIV section, and so
on. We looked through the courses on the
screen, but nothing was available. Reluc
tantly she took up her things and went to
the other side of the building where CIV
scheduling was in progress.
A short while later, in came another
student hoping to drop a fall course and
add a winter replacement. I rushed over
to CIV scheduling and found the first stu
dent, and within five minutes, both
walked out with the courses they wanted.
My only regret is that we didn't solve all
of the problems. We had to tell some stu
dents to sit in on classes and hope for an
opening and to leave their names with
Delores Rainer at the Freshman English
office in case she could place them. The
students were disappointed, of course, but
even then they appreciated the fact that
someone tried to help.
It occurred to me that for the students
our room was a station of tranquility
from what must have been a hellish day
of rushing from department to depart
ment trying to juggle mostly required
courses on a schedule that always seemed
to be short a few 11 a.m. slots.
I realized what many students had to go
through before arriving at our classrooms.
As Freshman English instructors, we focus
mainly on teaching students the interpre

tive, rhetorical and research skills they
need for the courses they will take during
their four years at Stanford. We develop
good working relationships with our stu
dents as they learn to tackle intellectual
and social issues as a group or individually.
And all of us, have had the pleasure of
watching our students, grow in linguistic
ability, ethical awareness, and self confi
dence â€” to spread their wings with words.
But few of us have the time or oppor
tunity to glimpse the personal problems
and frustrations students encounter in
negotiating what must at best have felt
like a bureaucratic maze. For this reason,
it felt good that I could be there for some
of them. It felt good to be in a position to
help them simply by punching a few keys.
And yet such simplicity required much
planning and groundwork. I had not been
aware of the many interrelated steps and
administrative minutiae involved in mak
ing the university machinery run smoothly.
And so my admiration goes to people
like Priscilla and Delores who bridge the
gaps between the university machinery
and individual students: They make it
possible for us to have A GOOD DAY AT
STANFORD.
