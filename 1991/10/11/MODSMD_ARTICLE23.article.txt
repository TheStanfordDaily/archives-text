						child's voyage out of the closet and into himself 
### 
WHEN I WAS A KID, I used to play
hide-and-seek a lot in the base
ment of my friend Mike's house. I
often ended up hidden in a "junk closet" —
the Mishkins have a lot of them — and I'd
wait there in the dark for Mike to come
find me.
I would lean against piles of toys and
peek through the narrow slit in the door;
my heart would pound with nervousness
and excitement. It was comforting to know
that all I had to do was sit and wait, but if
Mike didn't come soon I'd get real antsy,
and the game wouldn't be much fun any
more.
That's what it's like to be in the closet.
Today is National Coming Out Day,
when gays, lesbians and bisexuals around
the country are taking a step toward being
more open about their sexual orientation.
I say "taking a step" because I've found
that you're never totally in the closet, nor
totally out of it. You're always moving in or
out, in one direction or another.
Here's what I mean.
When I was in first grade and I realized

I had a crush on Sean Cassidy, I was
already one step out of the closet — at least
to myself. Of course, when I told my broth
er I thought Cassidy was handsome and he
made a face, I da-doo-run-ran back in.
As I grew older, and puberty turned my
mind into a one-track wonder, I realized
the track I was running on was for men
only. But that would make me a "fag."
I didn't want to be a fag, and I didn't
want anyone to think I was a fag, so I made
a point of my masculinity and purported
heterosexuality. I never buttoned the top
two buttons of my shirt, I refused to let a
gay man cut my hair and I pretended to
hate pink or purple.
When I got to high school, I realized that
no matter how much cologne I wore, no
matter how much I boasted of my (scant)
sexual exploits with the girls, I still liked the
men in the J. Crew summer catalog a whole
lot more than the women in Playboy.
So I finally admitted to myself that I
was gay. Another step out.
But I still had a lot to lose if word got out
at Horton Watkins High School in St.

Louis that one of the honor roll students
couldn't tell who was the prettiest cheer
leader. So I kept up the charade, dated sev
eral girls and realized I'd be miserable if
the lie lasted forever.
And then I got to Stanford.
Surrounded by attractive young men,
free from the pressure of parents and high
school friends and remarkably curious about
intimacy with another man, I was ready to
accelerate my journey out of the closet.
I stopped by The Bridge and had a two
hour conversation with a gay peer coun
selor. I showed up at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center "to use the
library" and read hundreds of pages about
homosexuality and gay people's experi
ences. I started showing up to socials at the
center, and I was finally asked out by a man.
That man soon became my boyfriend,
and I returned home for my freshman win
ter break eager to share my excitement and
self-discovery with my family.
"I'm gay," I said. They laughed.
"No, really," I insisted. "I'm gay and I
have a boyfriend, and I'm really happy

about being honest about it."
There I was, doing what I had both
dreaded and anticipated for years, and my
family was treating it like an April Fool's
joke. I kept insisting that I really was a
homosexual but it took a while to convince
them. At one point I thought I'd have to
force myself to start lisping before they'd
get the point.
Eventually we started the long process
of dealing with the changed expectations,
fears and sorrow that come with finding
out a child is gay.
For the most part, they've come to
accept my being gay as just another part of
me, as have the dozens of friends I've had
to sit down and say, "There's something
I've been meaning to tell you."
As I took each step out, being honest
and open about my sexual orientation
became just a bit easier. It was great to
know that I wouldn't have to deal with
awkward questions like, "Do you have a
girlfriend?"
Occasionally, when I come out to some
one his face reads, "Why are you telling me

this?" It's an attitude that says,"I don't
care what you do in bed, but why do you
have to flaunt it?" and"I don't talk about
my heterosexuality."
I want to make one thing clear: Homo
sexuality is not a favorite sexual position.
It is a sexual orientation — the attraction
to and capacity to love members of the
same sex. Straight people talk about their
heterosexuality every time they express
interest about a member of the opposite
gender and every time they talk about
their future (or present) spouse.
My sexual orientation influences where I
live, what my politics are, what I do for fun
on a Saturday night, if and how I am going
to have children and, of course, whom I plan
to spend the rest of my life with.
I'm gay, I'm proud and nothing's going
to push me back into the closet. Except
maybe a really cute guy with big biceps
who's into that kind of thing.
