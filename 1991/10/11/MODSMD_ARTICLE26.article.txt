## Stenstrom ready to lead Card 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
In contrast to the media hype sur
rounding Cardinal football head coach
Denny Green's recent decision to make a
switch at the quarterback position, the
new starter — redshirt freshman Steve
Stenstrom — is attempting to maintain
as low a profile as possible.
For reasons ranging from team
dynamics to relieving the pressure of the
sudden responsibility of his new position,
Stenstrom prefers to concentrate on the
task at hand.
"I just want to focus on what I have to
do," Stenstrom said.
The six-foot-two-inch, 200-pound
sophomore from El Toro, Calif., spent
his freshman year redshirting and
entered this season as backup quarter
back.
"I think [redshirting] helped me a
lot," Stenstrom said. "The offensive sys
tem is so intricate that you need a year to
pick up on it before you can really go in
and play without making too many mis
takes."
After playing in two games so far this
season, Stenstrom has made few mis
takes indeed. Against Notre Dame he
completed eight of 10 passes for 124
yards and for the season has tallied 14
completions in 23 attempts for 193
yards.
"Stenstrom played really, really well
against Notre Dame," junior strong safe
ty John Lynch said. "That's always sur
prising when a kid who hasn't played
that much, plays that well. It looked like
he'd been out there a lot."
"I was impressed with Stenstrom,"
Green said. "He came in and showed
some good poise."
Green was so impressed, in fact, that
he has moved Stenstrom into the start
ing quarterback position, replacing
senior Jason Palumbis. As the Cardinal
prepares to play Cornell in its fifth game
of the season, all eyes are on the offense
and the possible changes that will occur.
"I'm going to bring whatever I can to
the offense and play my best," Stenstrom
said.
Success in football is nothing new to
Stenstrom. He played starting quarter
back at El Toro High School, which is
considered one of the best in the state of
California. According to Tom Lemming's

Report, Stenstrom was ranked as the No.
26 high school quarterback in the nation.
In addition, he was Super Prep All-Far
West, Team MVP, First Team All-
Orange County Register and All-L.A.
Times.
"When I moved to California (from
Texas after my sophomore year), going
to Stanford became more of a reality
because the style of football in California
is a lot different than in Texas. I fit in
more and things started going right,"
Stenstrom said.
"He's played a good level of play,"
Green said of Stenstrom's high school
career. "He's always done a pretty good
job of winning football games."
During the summer before his senior
year, Stenstrom attended Stanford's
Youth Camp with hopes of making an
impression on the coaching staff.

"I was just trying to show the coaches
up here what I could do so that they
might look at me during the recruiting
season," Stenstrom said.
"We were impressed with him,"
Green said.
"We were real high on him going into
the recruiting process," Offensive Coor
dinator Ron Turner said. "He's got a
strong arm and he's very accurate."
Stenstrom was also recruited by lowa
but had little doubt that if offered a
scholarship at Stanford, he would take it.
The combination of the athletics and
excellent academics, as well as the
chance to stay in California, made the
decision to come to the Farm an easy one
for him.
With Palumbis as quarterback last
year and Lynch as backup, there was lit
tle chance for Stenstrom to make a con
tribution during games. Instead, Sten
strom took the opportunity as a redshirt
to improve several aspects of his game.

"I worked hard on my throwing and
accuracy," Stenstrom said. "I worked a
lot on my footwork and tried to get a lit
tle faster. I just looked to . . . what some
of my weaknesses were and tried to
improve on those."
The work has apparently paid off, as
his strengths are much more obvious
than his weaknesses. According to
Green, Stenstrom has the ability to
spread the ball around to all his
receivers. At the same time as having a
strong arm and good accuracy, he also
has the ability to avoid a heavy rush.
"He's got a real strong arm to throw
the ball well," Lynch said. "He's accurate
and he's shown really good poise each
time he's been out this year and last year
in practice."
Physical ability is important, but as
quarterback, leadership qualities are just
as essential.
"Steve's a good leader when he's out
there," Lynch said. "He's poised and he
doesn't get riled up."
"He's intelligent. .. and he's got good
leadership qualities," Turner said.
Speaking of intelligence, Stenstrom
has decided on a major in quantitative
economics with a possible co-term in
engineering and economic systems dur
ing his fifth year.
"He's a quality young man," Turner
said. "He's got his head on his shoulders
right and he's got his priorities straight."
Stenstrom is unaffected by the hype
and praise coming from all directions. He
remains self-critical as he prepares for
his first college football game as starting
quarterback.
"I think I did all right (so far this sea
son)," Stenstrom said. "I think there are
a lot of things I can improve on too.
Hopefully with experience things will
come. I made some mistakes that go
along with being an inexperienced quar
terback, but I also think I did some good
things and hopefully I'll just improve on
that."
Offensive lineman Brian Cassidy,
along with the offensive line and the rest
of the Cardinal squad, has confidence in
Stenstrom and is looking forward to a
strong offensive performance.
"We're going to protect Steve just as if
he were Jason," Cassidy said. "He knows
he has our full backing. We have confi
dence he knows the system; he gets the
job done."

In contrast to the media hype sur
rounding Cardinal football head coach
Denny Green's recent decision to make a
switch at the quarterback position, the
new starter — redshirt freshman Steve
Stenstrom — is attempting to maintain
as low a profile as possible.
For reasons ranging from team
dynamics to relieving the pressure of the
sudden responsibility of his new position,
Stenstrom prefers to concentrate on the
task at hand.
"I just want to focus on what I have to
do," Stenstrom said.
The six-foot-two-inch, 200-pound
sophomore from El Toro, Calif., spent
his freshman year redshirting and
entered this season as backup quarter
back.
"I think [redshirting] helped me a
lot," Stenstrom said. "The offensive sys
tem is so intricate that you need a year to
pick up on it before you can really go in
and play without making too many mis
takes."
After playing in two games so far this
season, Stenstrom has made few mis
takes indeed. Against Notre Dame he
completed eight of 10 passes for 124
yards and for the season has tallied 14
completions in 23 attempts for 193
yards.
"Stenstrom played really, really well
against Notre Dame," junior strong safe
ty John Lynch said. "That's always sur
prising when a kid who hasn't played
that much, plays that well. It looked like
he'd been out there a lot."
"I was impressed with Stenstrom,"
Green said. "He came in and showed
some good poise."
Green was so impressed, in fact, that
he has moved Stenstrom into the start
ing quarterback position, replacing
senior Jason Palumbis. As the Cardinal
prepares to play Cornell in its fifth game
of the season, all eyes are on the offense
and the possible changes that will occur.
"I'm going to bring whatever I can to
the offense and play my best," Stenstrom
said.
Success in football is nothing new to
Stenstrom. He played starting quarter
back at El Toro High School, which is
considered one of the best in the state of
California. According to Tom Lemming's

Report, Stenstrom was ranked as the No.
26 high school quarterback in the nation.
In addition, he was Super Prep All-Far
West, Team MVP, First Team All-
Orange County Register and All-L.A.
Times.
"When I moved to California (from
Texas after my sophomore year), going
to Stanford became more of a reality
because the style of football in California
is a lot different than in Texas. I fit in
more and things started going right,"
Stenstrom said.
"He's played a good level of play,"
Green said of Stenstrom's high school
career. "He's always done a pretty good
job of winning football games."
During the summer before his senior
year, Stenstrom attended Stanford's
Youth Camp with hopes of making an
impression on the coaching staff.

"I was just trying to show the coaches
up here what I could do so that they
might look at me during the recruiting
season," Stenstrom said.
"We were impressed with him,"
Green said.
"We were real high on him going into
the recruiting process," Offensive Coor
dinator Ron Turner said. "He's got a
strong arm and he's very accurate."
Stenstrom was also recruited by lowa
but had little doubt that if offered a
scholarship at Stanford, he would take it.
The combination of the athletics and
excellent academics, as well as the
chance to stay in California, made the
decision to come to the Farm an easy one
for him.
With Palumbis as quarterback last
year and Lynch as backup, there was lit
tle chance for Stenstrom to make a con
tribution during games. Instead, Sten
strom took the opportunity as a redshirt
to improve several aspects of his game.

"I worked hard on my throwing and
accuracy," Stenstrom said. "I worked a
lot on my footwork and tried to get a lit
tle faster. I just looked to . . . what some
of my weaknesses were and tried to
improve on those."
The work has apparently paid off, as
his strengths are much more obvious
than his weaknesses. According to
Green, Stenstrom has the ability to
spread the ball around to all his
receivers. At the same time as having a
strong arm and good accuracy, he also
has the ability to avoid a heavy rush.
"He's got a real strong arm to throw
the ball well," Lynch said. "He's accurate
and he's shown really good poise each
time he's been out this year and last year
in practice."
Physical ability is important, but as
quarterback, leadership qualities are just
as essential.
"Steve's a good leader when he's out
there," Lynch said. "He's poised and he
doesn't get riled up."
"He's intelligent. .. and he's got good
leadership qualities," Turner said.
Speaking of intelligence, Stenstrom
has decided on a major in quantitative
economics with a possible co-term in
engineering and economic systems dur
ing his fifth year.
"He's a quality young man," Turner
said. "He's got his head on his shoulders
right and he's got his priorities straight."
Stenstrom is unaffected by the hype
and praise coming from all directions. He
remains self-critical as he prepares for
his first college football game as starting
quarterback.
"I think I did all right (so far this sea
son)," Stenstrom said. "I think there are
a lot of things I can improve on too.
Hopefully with experience things will
come. I made some mistakes that go
along with being an inexperienced quar
terback, but I also think I did some good
things and hopefully I'll just improve on
that."
Offensive lineman Brian Cassidy,
along with the offensive line and the rest
of the Cardinal squad, has confidence in
Stenstrom and is looking forward to a
strong offensive performance.
"We're going to protect Steve just as if
he were Jason," Cassidy said. "He knows
he has our full backing. We have confi
dence he knows the system; he gets the
job done."
