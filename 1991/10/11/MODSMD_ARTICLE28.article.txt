# Water polo faces Cal
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
It isn't nearly the sort of mis
match that Saturday's Stanford-
Cornell football game is, but
when the Stanford water polo
team plays at California on the
same day, the Cardinal will enter
the game as decided underdogs.
You see, Cal is the No. 1-
ranked team in the nation and
has almost everyone back from
last year's team, which won the
NCAA championship.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has struggled so far this season
and is currently 7-6 and ranked
seventh.
Despite all of this, Cardinal
coach Dante Dettamanti believes
his team does have a chance to
pull off the upset. "This is still a
Stanford-Cal game, so who knows

what will happen. I expect it'll be
a typical Stanford-Cal game with
both teams playing their guts out,
and hopefully, we'll come out on
top."
If Stanford is to defeat the
Golden Bears, it will take an
exceptional performance from the
entire team. As sophomore goalie
Larry Bercutt said, "Cal's a really
tough team, and we're going to
have to play a really good game."
Dettamanti expanded upon
this thought: "We have to outplay
them in every phase of the game.
Everybody is going to have to
come through for us, because we
really need an almost perfect
game to beat them."
What makes Cal's team so
tough is that it excels both offen
sively and defensively. And the
depth of its team isn't that bad
either.
In all, the Bears' squad includes
five members of the United States
Junior National Team, one member
of the German National Team, one
member of Great Britain's National
Team, one member of the U.S.'s
World University Team, and finally
— but definitely not last — one
member of the United States
Olympic Team.
Quite a cast indeed. The leader of
the bunch is 6-foot-8-inch Chris
Humbert, arguably the most domi
nant player in college water polo and
the only collegiate member of our
Olympic team.
As Dettamanti said, "Humbert's
just a great player. You might be
able to stop him from shooting, but
he'll still manage to pass the ball to
someone else who can put the ball
in."
But that's not all there is to
worry about. Dettamanti continued,
"The real danger with Humbert is
his presence on defense. He has real
ly long arms and it is sometimes
quite hard to get the ball around
him. You really have to watch out
for him stealing the ball and getting
away on the counter-attack."
One other factor working against
Stanford will be the traditionally
boisterous Cal crowd. The game will
be played at 10:30 a.m., right before
a home football game, so there
should be a full stadium.
The game is quite important for
the future of Stanford's season.
"This week starts our do or die part
of the season," Dettamanti said.
