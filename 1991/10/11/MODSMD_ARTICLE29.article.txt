# Spikers set to destroy lame Ducks, Beavers
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Everyone would expect Stan
ford, the No. 1-ranked women's
volleyball team in the country, to
walk over Pacific 10 Conference
foes Oregon State and Oregon
this weekend at home, but actu
ally Cardinal coach Don Shaw
does not know what he will face.
"It's hard to tell (how they
will play) because both teams
have been battling some injuries.
We don't know what to expect
because several players on each
team are listed as probable for
this weekend," Shaw said.
Stanford, which is 13-0 on the
season and 5-0 in the Pac-10,
faces the Oregon State Beavers
tonight in Burnham Pavilion at
7:30 p.m. The Beavers are 1-5 in
conference play and 8-10 overall,
good enough for eighth place in
the Pac-10. The Cardinal has
never lost to Oregon State.
On Saturday night Stanford
faces the Oregon Ducks. Oregon
is 11-7 overall and 1-5 in the Pac
-10 so far. The Ducks started out
the season with a bang, winning
their first nine games for one of
the best starts in school history.
Since then, they have gone 2-7,
although three of those losses
have been to top-10 teams
UCLA, USC and Long Beach
State.
"Everyone has been going all

out for us this year. We're
preparing for both of these teams
to be at full strength," Shaw
said.
The No. 1 Cardinal is coming
off its biggest win of the year,
solidifying its hold on the top
ranking by beating Pacific in
Stockton on Tuesday night in
four games. After such a big win,
one might think that Stanford
will not be mentally prepared to
play this weekend.
"I think last year's team
turned the corner on emotional
letdowns. Starting last year,
we've played every match one at
a time. I think it would be foolish
for us to dwell on Tuesday's
match. We need to look ahead,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal continues to be
paced by the outstanding play of
senior captain Kristin Klein.
Klein led the team in kills,
attempts, and digs Tuesday
against Pacific, and she leads in
kills and attempts for the season
overall. She is second all-time in
school history in kills and digs,
and she should become the lead
er in both categories by the end
of the month.
In other volleyball news,
sophomore Danielle Everett has
not been in uniform recently
because of an injury she sus
tained two weeks ago, but Shaw
said that she should be practic
ing with the team again soon.
