# After school, TEAM program finds new focus
## 
### Georgia Bauman 
East Palo Alto elementary school
students will no longer be playing and
exercising with Stanford students dur
ing the school day. Instead, they will
build friendships and learn new skills
in an after-school sports league orga
nized by the Together Each Accom
plishes More public service program.
"Many of these children are
latchkey kids, so the program will give

them an activity for that time after
school when they may have been
alone," said program director Darcy
Thompson. The sports league will
offer one or two sports per quarter for
the students.
The program — coordinated
through the Haas Center for Public
Service — had provided physical edu
cation classes in East Palo Alto ele
mentary schools for several years.
Stanford students went to three

schools and taught 50-minute physical
education classes during the school
day. Since California state law re
quires 100 minutes of physical educa
tion per week, the students filled a gap
in the curriculum.
However, at the beginning of the
school year, program directors Thomp
son and Jill Shenkel were notified by
the school district that all outside
programs scheduled during the
school day had been canceled. The

directors said they were alarmed by
the news.
School-district Superintendent Dr.
Charlie Mae Knight decided the out
side programs were much too distract
ing for the students and the school-day
should focus more on academics. She
asked that the Stanford program
change its format and organize an
after-school sports league.
The original program will be
replaced by regular physical edu
cation classes within the school.
Knight could not be reached
for comment. However, Thomp
son said Knight's ultimate goal is
for the league to build a sense of
community and school identifica
tion. The students will be able to
build friendships, learn new
skills, and experience teamwork
and team spirit, Thompson said,
adding that Knight hopes the
teams will give East Palo Alto
something to cheer for.
Ultimately, Thompson said,
Knight would like to involve all
members of the East Palo Alto
community. For example, adults

who work during the day could
coach a few times per week after
school.
Starting winter quarter the
program will be sending Stanford
students to two elementary
schools to work with fourth, fifth
and sixth grade students. They
plan to organize soccer teams
because they said soccer is fun,
active and gender-neutral.
The directors said they are
enthusiastic about the new pro
gram. It also serves a different
need. "We will do whatever East
Palo Alto needs to help build the
spirit of community," Shenkel
said.
Shenkel and Thompson are
looking for Stanford students
who have previously coached,
who have played a sport in the
past or anyone who is interested
to join the program.
