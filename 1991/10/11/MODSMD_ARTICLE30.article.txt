# Booters minus Foudy take on Big Red
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
As the Cardinal women's soc
cer team plows through its
schedule with mind-boggling
ease, the question increasingly
appearing on fans' lips is, "Can
this team be stopped?"
Cornell will do its best to
answer that question affirma
tively as its team takes on Stan
ford's Saturday at Maloney
Field at 10 a.m.. Ranked No. 15
in the nation, the Big Red will
have its hands full against the
Card, which has shown no signs
of slowing down in its relentless
quest to be the best team in the
country.
Stanford (9-0) jumped three
spots in the national rankings
over the weekend to claim the
No. 6 position. They are cur
rently playing as well as any
team in the country, and they
will try to run their school
record winning streak to ten
straight this weekend without
the help of queen stud Julie
Foudy, who is playing for the
national team in North Carolina
and will not be back until later
this weekend.
The absence of Foudy, who
will also be unavailable for much
of the NCAA tournament in
November, will help the team
get used to playing without its
star scorer.
"It will be good for us to play
without her," senior Denise
Denney said. "We can rely on
her too much sometimes. When
we're struggling, we depend on
her to pull us along; when we're
going well, however, we're fine."
Three consecutive shutouts
by the Card defense seem to
indicate that the Card booters
are indeed going well. Against
Duke last weekend, Stanford
managed to prevail without the
help of a Foudy goal. However, it
was only the second time all sea
son that the junior forward
failed to score. Her 13 goals tie
the school record, so Stanford
will have to look elsewhere for
offensive help.
Fortunately, Stanford's team
is graced by several goalscorers
more than capable of picking up
the slack, as well as an airtight
defense that gives up very few
shots and takes almost all of the
pressure off of the offense.
When the other team man
ages to get a shot on goal, goal
keeper Leslie Garrard has been

brilliant in keeping the balls out
of the Cardinal net. Stanford
has posted seven shutouts and
has given up only two goals all
season while scoring 42 times.
Denney likens the Big Red to
the Brown Bruins, a team that
the Cardinal decimated last
weekend, as far as their style of
play. However, she expects Cor
nell to give Stanford a slightly
more even contest.
"They're very similar to

Brown in that they're a very
physical team," Denney said.
"They'll be out there hammer
ing and playing hard."
Expect coach Berhane Ande
berhan to draw the referees'
attention to any rough play.
Andeberhan was extremely dis
pleased with the officials' non
calls regarding what he believed
to be blatant fouls in the Duke
contest. Andeberhan later dis
cussed the possible dire conse

quences to his team should the
poor officiating continue.
"We had five knee surgeries
last year," Andeberhan said.
"And, in large part, they could
have been prevented with better
officiating. We'll take our lumps
on a good play, but in the Duke
game, our players were getting
butchered."
Hopefully, all will go smooth
ly tomorrow when the two
teams square off.

from a broken leg sustained last season. With leading scorer Julie Foudy In North Carolina with the
