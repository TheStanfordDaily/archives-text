# Card shoots for fourth straight victory

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team faces Cornell on Maloney
Field today at 3 p.m. in the first
of five sports events involving
the two schools this weekend.
The soccer match, like tomor
row's football game, should
result in a Cardinal victory.
Here, however, is where any
similarities between the football
and soccer teams end.
While the men of the gridiron
have struggled to a 1-3 record
thus far, the real Stanford foot
ball team could be on its way to
the most successful season in the
23-year history of men's varsity
soccer on the Farm.
The Cornell Big Red enter
today's match with a 1-5-1
record, but this is misleading for
several reasons. Cornell com
petes in the soccer-tough East,
and many other Ivy League
schools consistently field nation
ally-ranked squads.
A closer look at Cornell's
schedule sheds even more light
on the team. "Most of the games
that Cornell has played," said
Stanford assistant coach Greg
Petersen, "have been decided by
one goal. They'll keep us hon
est."
Adding to the problems faced
by the Cardinal against Cornell
is the fact that none of the Stan

ford coaches have seen the Big
Red play this year. "It's a mys
tery game," said Petersen. "We
know very little about them."
According to Cardinal goalie
Kyle Krpata, the possibility of
suffering an embarrassing
defeat will be ample motivation
for his teammates. "We should
beat them," said the junior, "but
we can't overlook them. A loss to
a team like Cornell threatens
our credibility."
Indeed, credibility is an asset
that Stanford can ill-afford to
lose at this point in its season.
The team has slowly risen onto
the national scene, compiling a
7-2-3 record while facing six top
-20 opponents.
During the Cardinal's most
recent three game winning
streak, the squad has developed
a consistency that it lacked in
much of the first part of the
year. "On the positive side,
we've had no peaks and valleys
lately," said Petersen. "We've
been playing the same type of
game every game."
The second half of the season
should prove, if anything, to be
even tougher than the first half
for Stanford. Games on the hori
zon include away matchups
against Santa Clara, who was
ranked No. 1 nationally before
falling to the of North Carolina
last week, and defending nation
al champion, UCLA.

Agile midfielder Ryan Collins has helped the men's soccer team stretch its winning streak to four
games. The freshman contributed to Stanford's recent victory over Texas Christain in the Cardinal
Classic with a goal and an assist.
