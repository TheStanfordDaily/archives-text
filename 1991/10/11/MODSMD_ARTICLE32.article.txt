# Golfers win Husky Classic
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
A lot can happen in the span of a year. The Car
dinal men's golf team can attest to that.
At this time last year the group of linksters was
inexperienced, untested, young and not ranked. Now
Stanford is ranked 10th in the nation and have three
pre-season All-Americans, Christian Cevaer, Notah
Begay and Casey Martin.
"In a way it's a load that we have to carry being
ranked 10th," coach Wally Goodwin said. "Pre-sea
son rankings don't mean a thing except that we
caught the eyes of the guys who do the rankings."
So with new-found respect the Cardinal ventured
to Seattle, Wash. Monday for the
MassMutual/Husky Men's Golf Classic. The Cardi
nal was in for a 54-hole, two-day affair with 12 other
squads that are all ranked below Stanford.
When the tourney finished Tuesday, the rest of the
field could only pack up their bags knowing that the
best team had come out on top — the Cardinal.
The linksters put it all together in the second
round of the 36 holes played Monday. After the first
18, San Jose State led the Cardinal by nine strokes.
But the Cardinal had a power lunch.
"When the guys came in for lunch, I wanted them
to be concerned with two things: first, I wanted them

to just get their drives in the fairway, and second, I
wanted them to shoot for the middle of the greens
with any club that it would take," Goodwin said.
And it worked. The Cardinal made up the nine
stroke deficit and converted it into a five-stroke
turnaround in its favor with a second-round score of
283, while San Jose State, ballooned with a 297.
On Tuesday, the Cardinal recorded another 283
while extending its margin of victory from five to 12
strokes.
Cevaer, the senior captain, and Begay spearhead
ed the Cardinal attack as they finished the Husky
tourney in a first-place tie at an even par 210.
"I won the [Pacific 10 Conference Championship]
on this same course as a freshman, so it was a kind of
deja uu for me," Cevaer said.
But for Cevaer it was a little more than just deja
vu; Begay's sterling performance set the tone for
what the squad accomplished last year: a competitive
spirit among the members of the team.
"My first few years here I finished first on the
team all the time," Cevaer said. "Notah's perfor
mance shows the improvement on our team. He
showed that he can play even better than me. That
makes me feel good."
Mike Milliken finished in a three-way tie for ninth
with a total score of 217 with one and two-over-par
performances in the first two rounds.
