This weekend the Stanford
sailing team travels to Berkeley
for the prestigious Stoney Burke
Intersectional. While always one
of the biggest competitions in
the fall sailing season, this year
the field is even larger.
"This year it's an intersec
tional so it's not restricted to
schools from the California dis
trict. Teams from Washington,
Oregon and Hawaii will be
there," said Stanford sailing
coach Blake Middleton.
Each school is expected to

field at least one boat in both the
varsity and junior varsity divi
sions. Within those sets the com
petitors are divided into 'A' and
'B' levels, depending on skill and
experience.
"Our second-third-and-fourth
place boats are actually better
than the varsity boats from
some of the other schools," Mid
dleton said.
Stanford is sending its whole
squad, but Middleton is waiting
as late as possible to decide on
who will man the varsity boats.
"I'm waiting on some perfor
mance factors to see who's click
ing," Middleton said.

The team hopes to continue
its strong performance from a
month ago when it placed sev
enth among college squads at
the Nevins Trophy Intersection
al in King's Point, N.Y. Leading
the Cardinal squad was 'A' Divi
sion skipper John Emory.
Later this month the Stan
ford sailing team travels to
Santa Cruz for the North Sloop
Eliminations.
