# Doodlers dedicated to raw umber, maize
## 
### 
The color of a crayon may not seem very impor
tant, but last year, when Crayola decided to change
the shades of some of the crayons in its time-tested,
64-crayon box, it heard from some pretty indignant
colorers. To satisfy those nostalgic scribblers, Cray
ola declared a few weeks ago it would do the Coke
thing and issue a Crayola Classic box of crayons, with
all original 64 colors.
When announcing their new but classic product at
a press conference, Crayola cited a letter from two
Stanford sophomores, Chelsea Powell and Dave
Williams, which helped them realize just how much
raw umber or lemon yellow mean to dedicated doo
dlers.
Following is an excerpt from the letter.
To whom it ought to concern:
David and I are writing to you to express our dis
may at the loss of eight colors from the original Cray
ola 64-pack. We are both students at Stanford Uni
versity, and although college is often the time for
teenagers to develop into mature adults, we have not
left our childhoods behind us.
The ultimate possession when we were kids was
the glorious 64-pack box of crayons, with the built-in
sharpener, with the box to write your name on the
back as the proud owner and with all 64 colors. The
distinction between orange red and red orange was
terribly important and the source of much earnest
discussion, when coloring toucan beaks or rocket
flames or simply oranges. Everyone always won
dered what maize meant and then used it to make
sunny days.
"Coloring," the box now says, "is more fun with
these eight new colors." But coloring was right
before. Coloring with classic crayons does not need
improvement. It will endure because kids and even
college students know that blue gray is the proper
way to make a stormy sky or huge and quiet whales.
Thank you very much,
Dave and Chelsea

Classic Crayons
Crayons are just for kids in elementary school, right? Wrong. Last year, when Crayola went trendy with
a new 64-pack, two sophomores, Chelsea Powell and Dave Williams, wrote a letter of protest. A week
ago, Crayola announced the creation of a Classic Crayola 64-pack and cited the letter from the two Stan
ford students as an influential factor in their decision.
