# Bored? Try giving your prof. an electric shock
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
If you're reading these words,
chances are that you're bored out of
your skull.
I mean, in all probability, right now
you're sitting in the back of some 11
a.m. class whose clock is obviously
broken because throughout the last
two lecture topics, the minute hand
has moved about the same distance as
the westward drifting of the North
American continental plate. And
you're lazily scanning through The
Daily because the only other option
you have, besides actually paying
attention, is coloring in all the "0"s
and "D"s on your notebook cover.
Yes, even Stanford students get
bored in class every now and then.
But I guess that's understandable;
after all, if every lecture were a fun
and exciting barrel of laughs, they'd
have to get rid of the entire math cur
riculum.
But regardless, something should
be done about all these boring classes.
Maybe some of the fancy new class
rooms could install buttons on every
seat which, when pushed, would send
about 95 volts coursing through the
professor's skull via some remote con
trol electrode. Used properly, this
could be a fairly effective method to
spice up lectures:

So, in Schleagleberger's discourse,
we can see how he relates the funda
mental points of both of these philo
sophical theories and then goes on to
demonstrate how this synthetic point
of view, by which of course I am refer
ring to ZAAPPPPPP!!! Oh! Hey, that
reminds me of this joke . . . let's see . . .
uh, Descartes walks into this bar, and
the bartender goes "Do you want a
drink?" and Descartes says,"I think
not!" and suddenly he disapp— ZAA
PPPPP!!! ZAAPPPPPPPP!!!
Or maybe the University should
just take the next obvious step and
relax their professor selection criteria
to include stand-up comedians. Sure,
Billy Crystal may not know much
about molecular biology, but you
don't need to be a Whoopi Goldberg in
order to babble about a subject with

which you have no familiarity whatso
ever.
However, this policy change is
about as likely to happen as anyone
showing up for the Democratic
National Convention. And to make
matters worse, all of the textbooks are
written by the same boring professors
who have tons of free time because no
one wants to show up to office hours
only to be forced to admit that they
slept through the entire lecture.
Yeah, you know what I mean: the
books that drone on and on about bla
"tantly useless subjects, have precious
ly few pictures and contain absolutely
no scratch 'n' sniff sections. Pick up
any chemistry textbook, for example,
and you're likely to get a hernia.
Again, something needs to be done.
I dunno, maybe the reading assign
ments would be more enjoyable if they
were more like the books we used to
read as kids. They could have pop-up
books for Hum Sex, or maybe a Dr.
Seuss theme for physics texts. ("One
Quark, Two Quark, Red Quark, Blue
Quark," "Horton Nears the Speed of
Light," etc.)
And what about those foreign lan
guage textbooks with the inane exam
ples and stories that sound like they
were written by Marilyn Quayle in an
isolation tank? You'd think that they
could come up with something a little
more interesting for us.

Translate the following sc.uences into
French:
1. Jean-Paul is a psychotic killer.
2. He was in jail for strangling two
people with their own small
intestines.
3. Today Jean-Paul got out on
parole and went to the hardware
store.
And so on. Minor changes like
these might avoid the boredom and
procrastination normally associated
with homework. Like when you
should be doing that CIV reading, but
you've been staring at page 52 for
about an hour and a half, so you flip
on the dorm TV and spend the rest of
the night watching "Squirm," a '50s
flick about killer earthworms from
outer space that are finally defeated
after the hero discovers that they are
repulsed by most varieties of mayon
naise.
This kind of thing is bound to keep
happening as long as classes stay bor
ing, and there's really nothing you
can do about it. So for now, just try to
enjoy lectures more, be more pre
pared and make better use of your
time. Start bringing a pillow to class.

Ken Wharton would like to introduce
Jean-Paul to the sick fool who has
infected half of campus with the
Nebraskan Death Flu.
