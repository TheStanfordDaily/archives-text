# Bug beats sensorless seismograph senseless
## 
### 
Dear Bug Me,
How come when I jump up and down by the
earthquake detector thingy in front of the Ter
man Engineering Library, the pen doesn't
move at all? I've tried shaking it, I've tried
kicking it. .. . Is it broken ?
Curiously,

Well, if it wasn't broken before, the beat
ing you handed it surely did it in.
To find out what was going on, I first went
to the second floor of Terman to see the detec
tor. From the placard in front of it, I found
that its proper name is a "seismograph" (yet
another exception to that dumb "i before e,
except after c, or when followed by " rote
rule they made me memorize in elementary
school).
I tried a little jump by the thing, and sure
enough, the pen didn't budge. I didn't want to
make a complete ass of myself by violently
jumping up and down in front of the thing in
the middle of the day, as I have seen several
people (maybe you) do in the past.
While I was trying to decide whether or not
to come back later for some more serious
jumping, I noticed that the room across the

way from the library had the word "INFOR
MATION" spelled out vertically in letters six
inches high.
They said the actual sensor for the
machine is located remotely, and the thing in
front of the library was just the recording
unit. (I hope they didn't see me take my small
little jump by the recorder.) The recording
unit itself is fairly delicate and is easily dam
aged by things like the Loma Prieta earth
quake and people jumping up and down by it.
(I really hope they didn't see me take my
diminutive little jump by the recorder.) They
also said that people jumping up and down

next to the thing pissed off everyone on the
whole floor. (I pray they didn't see me take
my vanishingly small, minute little hop by the
recorder.)
I called Dr. Helmut Krawinkler, professor
of civil engineering in the Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center, and he told me that the
sensor was located in the basement of Ter
man where it was less apt to be kicked or
taken.
Why someone would want to steal the sen
sor of a seismograph was not readily apparent
to me. Maybe there's a large black market
demand for this sort of thing. But I didn't
want to insult Prof. Krawinkler by asking
why on earth anyone would want to take the
sensor of a seismograph. After all, he was
being very helpful.
Now you can glower smugly at all those
supposedly gifted engineering types jumping
up and down next to the seismograph's
recorder unit in front of the Terman Engi
neering library.
