# Conley knows dangers facing Hill
## Med School professor sees links to case of Thomas accuser 
### Chris Brazell 
The issue of sexual harassment
in the workplace — which flared
into a national debate with the
July resignation of Stanford Neu
rosurgery Prof. Frances Conley —
continues to capture the media
spotlight with Anita Hill's allega
tions of sexual harassment
against Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas.
Hill, a professor at the Univer
sity of Oklahoma, accused Thom
as of sexually harassing her while
she worked for him during his
tenure as head of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission.
In an interview with The Daily,
Conley — who returned to her job
in September — spoke of the diffi
culties Hill might face now that
she has reported sexual harass
ment.
"When a woman goes public
with something like this, her
career could easily be destroyed
by a kind of subtle blackballing.

Anita Hill already has two things
going against her: she's a woman
and she's black. She could very
well find herself out of a job in the
aftermath of this."
Conley said she found it ironic
that Hill could not even turn to the
agency — the EEOC — that was
supposed to protect women against

harassment because the EEOC
chairman was the aggressor.
"I also think this situation is
proof that Clarence Thomas will
be insensitive to sexual harass
ment cases as a Supreme Court
Justice since he was insensitive to
them as head of the EEOC."
Conley also said there is a dis
tinction between sexual harass
ment and gender insensitivity,
which involves less direct aggres
sive actions.
She said she believes Hill's case
is one of gender insensitivity
where Thomas allegedly "created
a hostile working environment for
her." Without being explicitly told
so, Hill felt that she would lose
her good assignments if she were
to "make waves."
Asked if she thought Hill had
devalued her claims by waiting
several years to report them, Con
ley said, "It depends on what you
mean by 'devalued.' It also
depends to a large degree on what
Hill wanted to gain by either
going public or keeping quiet."
