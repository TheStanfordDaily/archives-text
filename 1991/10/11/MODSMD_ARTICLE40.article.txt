Caller harasses Kimball women
A wave of "serial phone harassment"
recently swept through Kimball Hall,
according to Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
Six female students living in Kimball
reported receiving harassing calls earlier this
week. A police investigation revealed a sequen
tial pattern in the victim's phone numbers.
"A lot of the guys in the dorm who had
phone numbers in that sequence were also
called, but whoever it was hung up," said
Resident Assistant Pamela Briskin.
According to Niemeyer, the sequential
pattern is unusual. Although telephone
harassment is relatively widespread on cam
pus, the Kimball incident is the first to be
reported this year, he said.
The first reported call occurred Sunday at
approximately 3:30 p.m. Subsequent calls
were received on Monday between 6:15 and
6:45 a.m. and between 12:45 and 1 p.m.
"I think it was just some random
prankster," said Angela Rickford, a resident
fellow in Kimball.
"It sounded like he was just waking up,"
added one victim. The caller, breathing
heavily, asked the woman what she was
wearing and repeatedly told her to "pretend
you are with me right now."
"I'm hot and waiting for you," he added
before the woman hung up. Niemeyer
described the caller's line of questioning as
"a typical ploy."

"When they start popping sexual ques
tions, then it's time to hang up," he advised,
noting that all obscene or threatening calls
should be reported to the police.
Because the calls occurred at times when
students are generally at home, police believe
the caller is a Stanford student or someone
associated with the University. The caller
has only been identified as "a young male."
In addition to being a misdemeanor, pun
ishable by a fine and/or jail sentence, sexual
ly explicit telephone harassment may qualify
as sexual harassment, which for Stanford
students is a violation of the Fundamental
Standard and can result in suspension.

'Tiger team' investigating SLAC
A U.S. Department of Energy "Tiger
Team" made up of 50 health, safety and envi
ronmental experts arrived Oct. 7 to inspect
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
the Stanford Radiation Laboratory.
During their month-long visit, the
experts will be looking for ways to improve
the safety, environmental protection and
waste management procedures of the labo
ratories.
According to Mary Ross, program manag
er at SLAC's Environment, Safety and
Health Division, the review is part of the
Energy Department's goal to "change the
culture of the labs by having researchers
integrate environmental concerns into the

management policies of SLAC ... rather
than making it secondary."

Student jailed for alleged battery
A Stanford law student spent Wednesday
night in jail following an alleged violent dis
pute with another graduate student living in
Crothers Hall.
Crothers resident Edward Stewart, 21,
was formally charged with battery, a misde
meanor, before being released on his own
recognizance Thursday morning.
According to the police report, residents
of Crothers heard angry shouts at approxi
mately 10 p.m. on Wednesday as Stewart
allegedly knocked down a male victim
repeatedly and threatened to hit him.
Stanford police converged on Crothers
after the victim attempted to dial 911. The
call was abruptly aborted when Stewart
allegedly knocked the phone from the man's
hand. But police had already traced the call
to the first floor of Crothers, where they
arrested Stewart for alleged battery and
unlawful detention.
"It was an argument between two friends
and that's all there is to say about it," Stew
art said yesterday. A temporary restraining
order has been issued against him.
If convicted of the misdemeanor charge,
Stewart faces a maximum penalty of one
year in jail.
