# Kosher Co-op hit by vandals
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Police are investigating a break-in yesterday at
the Kosher Co-op in which vandals sprayed a fire
extinguisher and stole a toaster and a microwave
oven.
A blue prayer book, coated with extinguisher
residue, was found on the floor, prompting police to
treat the break-in as a hate crime. Under state law
such a crime is a "religiously, ethnically or racially
targeted incident or act which threatens a person or
group of persons and constitutes expression of reli
gious, ethnic or racial hostility."
No evidence of anti-semitic slogans was found in
the co-op, which is located on the second floor of the
Elliot Program Center, but the plunder has evoked
strong feelings in the Jewish commurity.
"As kitchen manager and a Jewish person I can't
help but feel uneasy and a little threatened, perhaps
scared," said Joe Dobrin, a fifth-year senior.
Police arrived on the scene after custodians dis
covered the co-op's door ajar and a coat of yellow
residue on the walls, tables and chairs.
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said intruders
forced open a window near the back porch of the
building between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m. yesterday. The
vandals apparently entered the kitchen — where
the microwave oven, toaster and extinguisher were
located — through a portal that had been left open
between a service counter and the ceiling.
Officials have no suspects, but detectives will
continue their investigation today. Sgt. John
