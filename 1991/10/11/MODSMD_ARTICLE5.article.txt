# Kosher Co-op hit by vandals

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Police are investigating a break-in yesterday at
the Kosher Co-op in which vandals sprayed a fire
extinguisher and stole a toaster and a microwave
oven.
A blue prayer book, coated with extinguisher
residue, was found on the floor, prompting police to
treat the break-in as a hate crime. Under state law
such a crime is a "religiously, ethnically or racially
targeted incident or act which threatens a person or
group of persons and constitutes expression of reli
gious, ethnic or racial hostility."
No evidence of anti-semitic slogans was found in
the co-op, which is located on the second floor of the
Elliot Program Center, but the plunder has evoked
strong feelings in the Jewish commurity.
"As kitchen manager and a Jewish person I can't
help but feel uneasy and a little threatened, perhaps
scared," said Joe Dobrin, a fifth-year senior.
Police arrived on the scene after custodians dis
covered the co-op's door ajar and a coat of yellow
residue on the walls, tables and chairs.
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said intruders
forced open a window near the back porch of the
building between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m. yesterday. The
vandals apparently entered the kitchen — where
the microwave oven, toaster and extinguisher were
located — through a portal that had been left open
between a service counter and the ceiling.
Officials have no suspects, but detectives will
continue their investigation today. Sgt. John
McMullen of the Stanford police
said students have been arrested
in the past in kitchen break-ins.
This summer alone, a microwave
and television were swiped from a
room on the first floor of the pro
gram center, according to Row
custodian Giovanni Vernon.
The Kosher Co-op was found
ed during spring quarter 1988 for
students interested in cooking
and eating kosher food, which is
prepared according to Jewish
dietary laws.
Because of the break-in and
extinguisher residue, co-op mem
bers ate dinner last night on the
back porch.
