A University Food Service employee was arrest
ed early yesterday morning for his alleged attempt
to run over a Stanford parking officer with a truck
in the Wilbur parking lot Wednesday evening.
Alberto Tapia, 18, turned himself in to the Palo
Alto police department at about midnight Wednes
day. He has been charged with misdemeanor bat
tery.
According to the police report, the parking offi
cer was writing a ticket for a truck parked in a fire
lane in the Wilbur lot at 7 p.m. Wednesday. The
truck belonged to one of Tapia's female co-workers.
Tapia then entered the lot from the Wilbur din
ing hall, where he is employed part-time, the report
said. Seeing that the officer was issuing a ticket,
Tapia went back inside, got the keys from the
truck's owner and attempted to move the truck.
However, the officer continued to write the tick
et. Enraged, Tapia attempted to run down the offi
cer, the report said.
"He went roaring toward him, then slammed on
his brakes and stopped only inches away," Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The report said Tapia backed up and rushed the
officer several more times, but the man would not
move. Then, according to the report, Tapia got out
of the truck and yelled to the offi
cer, "You think I'm not going to
run you over?"
When Tapia got back into the
truck, the officer decided to run
and call the Stanford police.
Tapia drove away.
The police report stated that
Tapia then went back to the
Wilbur dining hall, where he
boasted of the incident to his co
workers.
"His friends told him he was in
big trouble and should turn him
self in," Niemeyer said. Tapia
surrendered to the Palo Alto
police at midnight.
Tapia has worked for Food Ser
vice for three years. He had sever
al outstanding parking violations.
