truck belonged to one of Tapia's female co-workers.
Tapia then entered the lot from the Wilbur din

truck's owner and attempted to move the truck.
However, the officer continued to write the tick

"He went roaring toward him, then slammed on
his brakes and stopped only inches away," Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The report said Tapia backed up and rushed the
officer several more times, but the man would not
move. Then, according to the report, Tapia got out
