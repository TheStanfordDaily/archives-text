# 'Soto' note says he's alive, well

### Kim Hoskins 
The residents of Soto are
resting a little bit easier now
after having received word of
their dog-statue "Soto," which
disappeared from the dorm
almost two weeks ago.
Actually, they received word
from him.
"Soto" wrote a letter earlier
this week to the residents in
which he claimed that they treat
ed him "like a worthless lump of
stone," and he has therefore
taken off to see the world.
Among his numerous com
plaints, "Soto" cited the fact
that he has been robbed of his
freedom, has never been fed,
never been walked and has
"needed to find a fire hydrant
for the last 30 years." And due
to his "well-known hatred for

felines" he vehemently opposed
the dorm ritual of rubbing his
head for luck before the
M"CAT"s.
Included with the letter was
a picture of "Soto" sitting under
the Interstate 280 sign on Sand
Hill Road, where he said he
began his journey.
Residents briefly discussed
the theft at a house meeting this
week. The consensus was that it
would have taken two or more
people to carry the 100-pound
statue, and at least one of them
is probably a former Soto resi
dent, judging from the Soto lore
cited in the letter.
"In any case, these people
obviously have a lot of free time
on their hands, like they did this
between watching 'Oprah' and
'A Current Affair,' " Resident
Assistant Dev Patnaik said.
