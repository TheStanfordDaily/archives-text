About Nutrition.
Exec. Che/ ./<*// Edelmun
If good nutrition is the foundation for good health,
why would anyone not want to promote it? Perhaps
it's l>eeause if just isn't easy to combine good
nutrition with great euisine.
After all, you have to use only the finest, freshest
ingredients. Then prepare tHem with a minimum of
oils and saturated fats (and be eager to resjwmd to
special dietary requests). And finally, present the
kind of food critics rave about.
So why do we work so hard to make sure our cui
sine is as nutritious as jxrssible? That's easy. We
want you around for a long time.
