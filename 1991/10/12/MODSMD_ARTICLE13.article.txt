# Why ask why? The game in perspective
## 
### David Schwartz 
I have one simple question:
why??? Why are we playing Cor
nell? This could be the biggest
mismatch in Stanford history,
and what does it count for? Noth
ing. Zero. Zilch.
This game has lopsided writ
ten all over it. I'm sure that I'm
not alone when glancing at the
Cardinal schedule and asking,
"Who designed this thing?"
Stanford opened up with a mur
derer's row of opponents in
Washington, Arizona, Colorado,
and Notre Dame, followed
by...Cornell? Something doesn't
flow here. It just doesn't quite
make sense.
So far, Stanford has played the
Nos. 4, 8, and 17th ranked teams
in the country. And this week,
the Cardinal play a non-Division I
team! Yes, the Ivy League has
tradition, but playing a game
against a team from the I-AA
Ancient Eight means nada in
terms of the standings. Sure, it
appears (assumably) as a win in
the Cardinal's overall record, but
in terms of bowl hopes, the game
registers as a non-entity in the
eyes of selection committee offi
cials.

Then why is Stanford having
the Big Red travel from one coast
to the other for this game? Sure,
you assume that there will be
television money from this one.
All those Ivy Leaguers would love

to sit back on their couches, turn
on Madison Square Garden net
work, and watch their beloved
gridders take on Stanford in that
sunny foreign country which they
call California. Well think again.
TV revenue for this game does
not exist. Nobody, not even Palo
Alto's own Cable Co-op, is televis
ing the game.
Ticket sales, you say. All those
Stanford alumni will wax nostal
gic about the days when the Vow
Boys played the likes of Dart
mouth and Columbia, and come
to the stadium in droves. Wrong!
If you think that the 70,798 fans
who showed up for the Notre
Dame game last Saturday night
will be present today in the same
force, you are smart enough to be
a math major at USC (next
week's football power/academic
lightweight opponent).
I don't understand the logic in
all this. Either we should play
with the big boys (Notre Dame,
Colorado) or shelve our division I
status and play with academic

equals (Cornell). Put yourself in
Denny Green's shoes. How do
you psyche your team up to play
an outclassed Ivy squad when you
played with a nationally ranked
power the week before? It's like
the U.S. waging war against the
pre-1991 Soviet Union, and then
taking on Iraq the next week.
Completely different leagues. I
have a suggestion for our sched
ule makers: pencil in some Divi
sion I patsies that will count in
the standings, and leave the com
parisons with the Ivies to the peo
ple at U.S. News and World
Report. UOP or Toledo would
provide easy victories, and
impress the pollsters. If Cal can
get ranked, so can we.
That's the fundamental prob
lem with Stanford: we are a
hybrid. We can compete academi
cally with the best of the world,
and to some extent we can also do
it athletically.
Originally this game was
designed for Centennial weekend,
because many of the administra
tors at Cornell in the late nine
teenth century helped "found"
Stanford University. But come
on, lets keep the comparisons
solely on an academic level. Fly
some professors out from Ithaca,
NY, for a symposium or some
thing— don't schedule a football
game. Having Cornell travel all
that distance to endure three

hours of abuse is unfair. At least
academic comparisons can be
made, though. The radio
announcers on this game can
mention players' majors on both
teams, with the assurance that
players actually graduate from
the school that they play for.
That can be said only for a select
few of Stanford's opponents
(Notre Dame, Cal, and UCLA).
Yet this is small consolation for
today's pigskin spectacle.
To illustrate my point, how
often is Stanford favored by 45
points? Cornell coach Jim Hofher
said, "the university presidents
thought it would be nice to sched
ule a game between the two
schools." Notice that Jim himself
didn't think it was so nice. My
question: can we cover the point
spread.
The Ivy League is a model of
true student-athletes, who place
school first. Stanford athletes do
the same, getting first-rate educa
tions while competing at a higher
level. And in this 100 year
anniversary, this fact gives us
pause to reflect on why Stanford
is so special.

David Schwartz is a sophomore
double-majoring in political sci
ence and history. He can hardly
wait for the athletic dept. to
schedule a Cornell-Stanford
hoops contest.

Alto's own Cable Co-op, is televis
ing the game.
Ticket sales, you say. All those
Stanford alumni will wax nostal
gic about the days when the Vow
Boys played the likes of Dart
mouth and Columbia, and come
to the stadium in droves. Wrong!
If you think that the 70,798 fans
who showed up for the Notre
Dame game last Saturday night
will be present today in the same
force, you are smart enough to be
a math major at USC (next
week's football power/academic
lightweight opponent).
I don't understand the logic in
all this. Either we should play
with the big boys (Notre Dame,
Colorado) or shelve our division I
status and play with academic

equals (Cornell). Put yourself in
Denny Green's shoes. How do
you psyche your team up to play
an outclassed Ivy squad when you
played with a nationally ranked
power the week before? It's like
the U.S. waging war against the
pre-1991 Soviet Union, and then
taking on Iraq the next week.
Completely different leagues. I
have a suggestion for our sched
ule makers: pencil in some Divi
sion I patsies that will count in
the standings, and leave the com
parisons with the Ivies to the peo
ple at U.S. News and World
Report. UOP or Toledo would
provide easy victories, and
impress the pollsters. If Cal can
get ranked, so can we.
That's the fundamental prob
lem with Stanford: we are a
hybrid. We can compete academi
cally with the best of the world,
and to some extent we can also do
it athletically.
Originally this game was
designed for Centennial weekend,
because many of the administra
tors at Cornell in the late nine
teenth century helped "found"
Stanford University. But come
on, lets keep the comparisons
solely on an academic level. Fly
some professors out from Ithaca,
NY, for a symposium or some
thing— don't schedule a football
game. Having Cornell travel all
that distance to endure three

hours of abuse is unfair. At least
academic comparisons can be
made, though. The radio
announcers on this game can
mention players' majors on both
teams, with the assurance that
players actually graduate from
the school that they play for.
That can be said only for a select
few of Stanford's opponents
(Notre Dame, Cal, and UCLA).
Yet this is small consolation for
today's pigskin spectacle.
To illustrate my point, how
often is Stanford favored by 45
points? Cornell coach Jim Hofher
said, "the university presidents
thought it would be nice to sched
ule a game between the two
schools." Notice that Jim himself
didn't think it was so nice. My
question: can we cover the point
spread.
The Ivy League is a model of
true student-athletes, who place
school first. Stanford athletes do
the same, getting first-rate educa
tions while competing at a higher
level. And in this 100 year
anniversary, this fact gives us
pause to reflect on why Stanford
is so special.

David Schwartz is a sophomore
double-majoring in political sci
ence and history. He can hardly
wait for the athletic dept. to
schedule a Cornell-Stanford
hoops contest.
