# Quintessential backup: Lasley fills reserve role
## 
### Eugene Wei 
He's not mentioned as a Heis
man candidate, nor does he pos
sess nicknames such as "Touch
down," but J.J. Lasley is a vital
component of the Stanford foot
ball team.
His value to the Cardinal
comes not only as a backup tail
back and fullback to the more
publicized Glyn Milburn and
Tommy Vardell but as a leader on
special teams. The fact that he is
willing to assume the role of a
special teams player, not usually
a glamor position, should not sur
prise anyone. It is one he played
even in high school.
"I played tailback, fullback,
safety, outside linebacker and all
the special teams (in high
school)," recalled Lasley.
In addition to providing tight
coverage on kickoffs and punts,
Lasley serves as a capable second
string running back. At 6-0, 208
lbs., he is an intermediate back,
somewhere between the speed
and quickness of Milburn and the
size and power of Vardell. Both
going up the middle for tough
short yards and turning the cor
ner outside appeal to Lasley, who
shies away from comparisons to
other running backs.
"Everyone has their own style,
and there's really no comparison
as far as I'm concerned," he said.
"It's not like Glyn won't run any
body over, but he has the speed to
get around things, and you use
what you've got."
As expected, Lasley's running
opportunities are limited by the
talented tandem playing ahead of
him, but he accepts his limited
offensive role graciously.
"A lot of people tell me that at
different colleges I could be start
ing, and that's probably true," he
said, "but I don't have any
regrets...l just want to win and do
whatever I can to help."
His restricted offensive role is
bolstered by his critical play on
special teams, and he possesses a
keen understanding of how this
position fits into the Cardinal
scheme.
"On special teams, I'm more of
an inspirational player and a hard

worker," noted Lasley. "A couple
of other guys, Vince Otoupal is
one of them, we just get the team
fired up on special teams."
At least against Cornell, the
Cardinal special teams will have
to do without Lasley's on-field
inspiration. In last week's Notre
Dame game, Lasley suffered a
slight cartilage tear in his left
knee. He will miss at least today's
game, but he could be back for
next Saturday's contest at USC.
Lasley has had to demonstrate
patience throughout his partici
pation in Stanford football. In
his freshman year, he red-shirted
as it was Jack Elway's final year
as Stanford head coach.
The following year began well
as Lasley received substantial
playing time, but in the third
game against Oregon he sprained
his knee and sat out several
games. He was, however, able to
come back to play against UCLA
and Cal at the end of the season.
Last year, he carried the ball only
ten times because of the fine sea
son Milburn enjoyed.
Two more years of eligibility
remain for him, and he looks to
enjoy more carries this year even
though Milburn and Vardell have
returned. The injury to Milburn
in the Arizona game was an
example of how important Lasley
is.
"If Glyn or Varge goes down, I
can come in and lead a scoring
drive, and when he comes back,
that's fine with me," said Lasley.
Much of his good attitude
comes from his mother and his
realization of how fortunate he is
today as a result of her efforts.
He and his mother have been
alone since he was two. His par
ents live apart.
"We lived in a gang-infested
area (of Los Angeles) and I easily
slipped into that," recalled
Lasley. "My mom got me out of
that...it's all her."
After his mother moved him to
the Valley, she continued to keep
him "on the right track." Her
guidance resulted in the numer
ous options that awaited Lasley
after high school.
"Do well in school and you can
get a scholarship," said Lasley.

"If I didn't have football, I could
have gotten an academic grant or
something like that so I could still
be going to school."
At the moment, Lasley is
working on a B.A. in economics
and a masters in sociology, which
he'll receive with an extra quarter
of work next year, when he'll like
ly be invited back as a fifth-year
senior for the Cardinal football
team.
"Right now my goals are just
to get the two degrees and see
what happens," said Lasley. "I'm
not ready to step into the work
force right away...l know I want
to go into the NFL for three to
five years."
His goals for this football sea
son are more definite.
"I should be getting somewhat

less than ten carries a game, so I
figured a touchdown a game is
reasonable enough," said Lasley.
"Since I'm on all the special
teams, I also set a tackle a game
(as a goal)."
Lasley feels confident that
Stanford can meet the challenge
whenever facing an opponent
with strong special teams.
"Darian Hagan is a good per
sonal friend of mine, and he's a
great returner, and he didn't get
any big returns on us," he said.
"It doesn't matter who's back
there, we're going to stop them."
Lasley's confidence stems from
the consistent approach he brings
to special teams play every game.
"As long as I'm in the game,
the one part I can help us win is
special teams, and as long as I do

my job and a couple of other guys
hustle down the field, we'll win
our special teams, one-third of
the game," said Lasley. "Then, if
either our offense or defense has
a good day, that's two-thirds of
the game, and we have a great
chance to win."
On any given Saturday, coach
Green knows he can depend on
number 26 to come to the stadi
um ready to contribute in any of
the many roles he is called upon
to fill.
"I'm not looking to be a starter
or win the Heisman," said Lasley.
"I just want to play pro, and
every time I get in there I just try
to do my best, wherever I'm play
ing.
Any way you look at him, J.J.
Lasley is a "special" player.
