# PAC-10 AT A GLANCE
## 
### 
Oregon (3-2,1-1)
at California (4-0, 2-0)
The Bears, after pulling out a
last-minute win at UCLA a week
ago, find themselves tied with
mighty Washington atop the Pac
-10 standings. California, now
ranked 13th in the nation, could
set up a huge match-up with the
Huskies in Berkeley next Satur
day if they can get past the pesky
Ducks. If Cal wins, next week's
Washington-California clash will
likely send the victor to Pasade
na. Oregon is looking to stay
above the Mendoza line and
improve its chances for a third
straight bowl appearance.
Arizona (2-3,1-2)
at UCLA (2-2,0-1)
Both squads will be attempt
ing to bounce back from demoral
izing losses last week. UCLA fell
to Cal on a 47-yard field goal with
30seconds to play. Arizona was
embarassed by Washington 54-0.
The Bruins will tiy to avenge last
season's loss to the Wildcats at
the Rose Bowl. A loss for either
squad could all but dash any
hopes for post-season play.
Arizona State (3-1,1-0)
at Oregon State (0-4, 0-1)
The Beavers proved once and
for all that they are the Pac-10's
most atrocious team, as they
were pounded 55-7 by a mediocre
Washington State club. The Sun

Devils should deny OSU's quest
for its first victory, as they are
hoping to remain unbeaten in
conference play. Oregon State
has not beaten Arizona State
since 1971.
USC (2-2,1-1)
at Washington State (2-3,1-1)
This battle of middle-of-the-
Pac schools should answer some
questions about the Trojans'
legitimacy as a top-25 team. USC
has thus far knocked off top-10
power Penn State and Oregon,
but has played poorly in losses to
Memphis State and Arizona
State. After this matchup, the
Trojans' enter the heart of their
schedule, including games
against Notre Dame, Cal, and
Washington. Washington State
will be trying to prove its impres
sive performance against Oregon
State was more than simply a
tribute to the Beavers' inepti
tude.
Toledo (2-1-1)
at Washington (4-0, 2-0)
Warm up the scoreboard.
Washington just finished pum
melling conference rival Arizona,
and this game promises to be
uglier. Few teams have shown
that they belong on the same
field as the Huskies this season,
the Rockets are certainly not one
of them.

Oregon (3-2,1-1)
at California (4-0, 2-0)
The Bears, after pulling out a
last-minute win at UCLA a week
ago, find themselves tied with
mighty Washington atop the Pac
-10 standings. California, now
ranked 13th in the nation, could
set up a huge match-up with the
Huskies in Berkeley next Satur
day if they can get past the pesky
Ducks. If Cal wins, next week's
Washington-California clash will
likely send the victor to Pasade
na. Oregon is looking to stay
above the Mendoza line and
improve its chances for a third
straight bowl appearance.
Arizona (2-3,1-2)
at UCLA (2-2,0-1)
Both squads will be attempt
ing to bounce back from demoral
izing losses last week. UCLA fell
to Cal on a 47-yard field goal with
30seconds to play. Arizona was
embarassed by Washington 54-0.
The Bruins will tiy to avenge last
season's loss to the Wildcats at
the Rose Bowl. A loss for either
squad could all but dash any
hopes for post-season play.
Arizona State (3-1,1-0)
at Oregon State (0-4, 0-1)
The Beavers proved once and
for all that they are the Pac-10's
most atrocious team, as they
were pounded 55-7 by a mediocre
Washington State club. The Sun

Devils should deny OSU's quest
for its first victory, as they are
hoping to remain unbeaten in
conference play. Oregon State
has not beaten Arizona State
since 1971.
USC (2-2,1-1)
at Washington State (2-3,1-1)
This battle of middle-of-the-
Pac schools should answer some
questions about the Trojans'
legitimacy as a top-25 team. USC
has thus far knocked off top-10
power Penn State and Oregon,
but has played poorly in losses to
Memphis State and Arizona
State. After this matchup, the
Trojans' enter the heart of their
schedule, including games
against Notre Dame, Cal, and
Washington. Washington State
will be trying to prove its impres
sive performance against Oregon
State was more than simply a
tribute to the Beavers' inepti

Toledo (2-1-1)
at Washington (4-0, 2-0)
Warm up the scoreboard.
Washington just finished pum
melling conference rival Arizona,
and this game promises to be
uglier. Few teams have shown
that they belong on the same
field as the Huskies this season,
the Rockets are certainly not one
of them.
