# Stenstrom comes out of bullpen

Stanford football fans, the
future may be upon you.
After watching his team lose
three of its first four games,
Stanford coach Dennis Green has
decided to make a quarterback
change, inserting sophomore
Steve Stenstrom into the start
ing lineup for the first time.
Stenstrom will replace struggling
senior Jason Palumbis in today's
game against Cornell.
"Naturally, I'm excited to see
what I can do," said Stenstrom.
"This was my eventual goal,
what I came here for."
While the Cardinal ground
game has flourished so far this
season, the passing attack has
not been as successful as Green
and his coaching staff would
have liked. Green noted that his
biggest concern is making sure
the offense is operating the way
it should.
"I think we need to give Sten
strom a chance to improve the
offense," he said. We expect our
offense to be a little bit
better...Steve throws the ball well,
he's got a good arm. He's been in
two games, and has shown poise.
He's done a good job.

"This isn't as dramatic as [it is
made out to be]. Maybe if we
were a 4-0 team. But we're 1-3,
and we're going to be 1-5 if we
don't do something."
Stenstrom completed eight of
10 passes for 124 yards against
Notre Dame last week, while
leading Stanford on two late
touchdown drives. He also ignit
ed a passing attack that had been
lackluster throughout much of
1991.
If stats are any indication,
Palumbis did not play poorly
against Notre Dame. He com
pleted 18 of 27 for 153 yards
before giving way to Stenstrom
in the fourth quarter. However,
the Cardinal quarterback once
again was not able to complete
the big pass downfield, a problem
which has plagued him all sea
son. After finishing last season
as the most efficient passer in
the Pac-10, Palumbis has gone
the first four games in 1991
without throwing a touchdown
pass.
"Yes, I'm surprised,"
Palumbis said of the change.
"Yes, I'm disappointed. I don't
question any coaches' decisions.
I support Steve. He's a good
player and a great kid."

Stenstrom, out of El Toro
High School in Southern Califor
nia, was also surprised by the
move.
"As far as I knew, Jason was
starting," he said. "When [Quar
terback] Coach [Ron] Turner
called me into his office, I specu
lated that this might happen."
Turner expressed a great deal
of confidence in his young quar
terback.
"[Stenstrom] has got a bright
future," said Turner at a press
conference Tuesday. "He's got
all the tools to be a very good
player. He's intelligent, he has a
good arm, he's accurate, and he's
got leadership qualities."
Stenstrom came into camp
this summer No. 3 on the depth
chart, behind Palumbis and Jon
Lynch. When Lynch moved to
defensive back, Stenstrom moved
up to No. 2. Now he is the man
in the saddle, and his biggest
task against Cornell will be not
to let all the pressure and media
hype from the past few days
affect his play.
"I'm just going to stay relaxed,
try to perform and not to let the
pressure get to me. I know the
offense well and feel comfortable;
it's just a matter of executing."
