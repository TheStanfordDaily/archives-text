# Trimming Ivy: Stanford set to minimize Big Red
## 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
Victory. It's almost a given in the
minds of everyone (the team, the fans, the
nation) that Stanford will win today. All
but the minds of the Cornell Big Red.
This first meeting between the two
schools could be the last for a long time.
Originally scheduled to coincide with the
Centennial finale weekend (Cornell is 125
years old this year), illustrate the ties
these two schools have shared since Stan
ford's inception, and demonstrate Stan
ford's proud academic heritage with the
great schools of the East Coast, the game
instead takes place two weeks later in
what should be a mismatch.
Stanford (1-3, 0-2) tries to bounce back
after being pounded by No. 8 Notre Dame,
42-26, last Saturday night. The Cardinal
is looking to improve upon its run
defense, which was shredded by Irish
rushers. Tailback Tony Brooks and full
back Jerome Bettis each had more than
100 yards rushing by the end of the first
half. Notre Dame led 28-0 before Stanford
scored, putting the game out of reach
early.
Kicker Aaron Mills continues to strug
gle. He is one for seven on field goal
attempts this year, missing his only
attempt against Notre Dame.
Coach Denny Green, looking back on
last weeks loss and reflecting on the rest
of the season, said, "We're a little disap
pointed, but I think we have some great
opportunities ahead for us."
All was not lost for the Cardinal,
though. Fullback Tommy Vardell contin
ued to impress, racking up a career high
140 yards on 23 carries and scoring two
touchdowns. It was the third game in a
row that Vardell has rushed for more
than 100 yards.
Wide receiver Chris Walsh hauled in 8
catches for a career high 188 yards. He is
leading the Pac-10 in receiving, with 27
catches for 377 yards on the season, aver
aging better than 14 yards per catch.
Backup quarterback Steve Stenstrom
saw significant action, completing eight of
ten passes for 124 yards. His strong arm
impressed coach Denny Green enough to
give him the start at quarterback today.
"We expect our offense to be better...(and)
we're going to give Steve Stenstrom a
chance to direct [it]," Green said. "Steve
has been in two games, and he's shown
poise in both games and done a good job."
Cornell (1-2, 0-1) travels across coun

try from Ithaca, NY after gaining its first
victory of the season last weekend by
beating Bucknell on the road, 23-7. The
Big Red jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the
opening minute of the first quarter. The
defending Ivy League co-champions are
led on offense by junior running back
Matt Speicher, who has scored two touch
downs while rushing for 168 yards on 36
carries so far this season. Senior quarter
back Sean Andreas leads the Cornell air
attack, having completed 35 of 68 passes
for 310 yards and one touchdown this
season. Sophomore linebacker Chris
Zingo anchors the Big Red defense, lead
ing the team with 30 takles through three
games.
Although Cornell is a Division I-AA
team and Stanford comes into today's
game as a 45 point favorite, coach Green
expects the Big Red to put up a good fight,
rising to the challenge of playing against a
Division I squad. "I have never played
against an Ivy league team, I've never
coached against an Ivy league team, and
I've never seen an Ivy league game, so I'm
not exactly sure what to expect," said
Green. "I do know (that) they have a great
tradition, they were Ivy league champs
last year, and they're a veteran team with
a lot of pride. Cornell is not going to be
intimidated by a 1-3 Stanford team."
On a historical note, the two schools on
the field today have much in common.
Cornell is considered to be Stanford's
"sister school" on the east, with Leland
Stanford designing much of our universi
ty based on the structure of Cornell. Stan
ford's first president, David Starr Jordan,
was a Cornell graduate. The legendary
Glenn (Pop) Warner was a football coach
at both Cornell (1897-98 and 1904-06)
and Stanford (1924-32). Both universities
were first known as The Farm, both have
the largest campus land area today among
private universities, both share the same
school colors of red and white, and both at
one time have used the nickname "The
Big Red Machine."
Card Notes
Today's game is the final non-league game for
both schools; Stanford plays its next six
against Pac-10 conference foes, while Cornell
plays its last half-dozen in the Ivy
League...There is no television for today's
game, breaking Stanford's streak of six tele
vised games in a row (the last two of 1990, and
the first four of 1991)... The last time the Car
dinal played an Ivy League opponent was back
in 1949, when it beat Harvard 44-0.

in the end zone today. Stanford is a 45 point favorite over Cornell.
Victory. It's almost a given in the
minds of everyone (the team, the fans, the
nation) that Stanford will win today. All
but the minds of the Cornell Big Red.
This first meeting between the two
schools could be the last for a long time.
Originally scheduled to coincide with the
Centennial finale weekend (Cornell is 125
years old this year), illustrate the ties
these two schools have shared since Stan
ford's inception, and demonstrate Stan
ford's proud academic heritage with the
great schools of the East Coast, the game
instead takes place two weeks later in
what should be a mismatch.
Stanford (1-3, 0-2) tries to bounce back
after being pounded by No. 8 Notre Dame,
42-26, last Saturday night. The Cardinal
is looking to improve upon its run
defense, which was shredded by Irish
rushers. Tailback Tony Brooks and full
back Jerome Bettis each had more than
100 yards rushing by the end of the first
half. Notre Dame led 28-0 before Stanford
scored, putting the game out of reach
early.
Kicker Aaron Mills continues to strug
gle. He is one for seven on field goal
attempts this year, missing his only
attempt against Notre Dame.
Coach Denny Green, looking back on
last weeks loss and reflecting on the rest
of the season, said, "We're a little disap
pointed, but I think we have some great
opportunities ahead for us."
All was not lost for the Cardinal,
though. Fullback Tommy Vardell contin
ued to impress, racking up a career high
140 yards on 23 carries and scoring two
touchdowns. It was the third game in a
row that Vardell has rushed for more
than 100 yards.
Wide receiver Chris Walsh hauled in 8
catches for a career high 188 yards. He is
leading the Pac-10 in receiving, with 27
catches for 377 yards on the season, aver
aging better than 14 yards per catch.
Backup quarterback Steve Stenstrom
saw significant action, completing eight of
ten passes for 124 yards. His strong arm
impressed coach Denny Green enough to
give him the start at quarterback today.
"We expect our offense to be better...(and)
we're going to give Steve Stenstrom a
chance to direct [it]," Green said. "Steve
has been in two games, and he's shown
poise in both games and done a good job."
Cornell (1-2, 0-1) travels across coun

try from Ithaca, NY after gaining its first
victory of the season last weekend by
beating Bucknell on the road, 23-7. The
Big Red jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the
opening minute of the first quarter. The
defending Ivy League co-champions are
led on offense by junior running back
Matt Speicher, who has scored two touch
downs while rushing for 168 yards on 36
carries so far this season. Senior quarter
back Sean Andreas leads the Cornell air
attack, having completed 35 of 68 passes
for 310 yards and one touchdown this
season. Sophomore linebacker Chris
Zingo anchors the Big Red defense, lead
ing the team with 30 takles through three
games.
Although Cornell is a Division I-AA
team and Stanford comes into today's
game as a 45 point favorite, coach Green
expects the Big Red to put up a good fight,
rising to the challenge of playing against a
Division I squad. "I have never played
against an Ivy league team, I've never
coached against an Ivy league team, and
I've never seen an Ivy league game, so I'm
not exactly sure what to expect," said
Green. "I do know (that) they have a great
tradition, they were Ivy league champs
last year, and they're a veteran team with
a lot of pride. Cornell is not going to be
intimidated by a 1-3 Stanford team."
On a historical note, the two schools on
the field today have much in common.
Cornell is considered to be Stanford's
"sister school" on the east, with Leland
Stanford designing much of our universi
ty based on the structure of Cornell. Stan
ford's first president, David Starr Jordan,
was a Cornell graduate. The legendary
Glenn (Pop) Warner was a football coach
at both Cornell (1897-98 and 1904-06)
and Stanford (1924-32). Both universities
were first known as The Farm, both have
the largest campus land area today among
private universities, both share the same
school colors of red and white, and both at
one time have used the nickname "The
Big Red Machine."
Card Notes
Today's game is the final non-league game for
both schools; Stanford plays its next six
against Pac-10 conference foes, while Cornell
plays its last half-dozen in the Ivy
League...There is no television for today's
