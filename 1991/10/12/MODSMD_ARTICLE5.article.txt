# Universal in offensiveness: That wild, crazy LSJUMB

The real question today is not whether
Stanford will beat Cornell. The deeper
issue is: who will the Band offend next?
The Leland Stanford Junior Universi
ty Marching Band (LSJUMB) has always
had the reputation of being embroiled in
controversey. Last week was no excep
tion.
During the pregame festivities prior to
Saturday's night's prime-time clash with
Notre Dame, junior drum major Erik
Selvik was costumed as a Hasidic Jew,
using a menorah as his baton to keep
time. Certainly, this was offensive but
Selvik didn't stop there.
Once gametime rolled around, Selvik
was prepared for his next outfit. He
appeared dressed as a Catholic nun,
wielding a cross as a baton. Needless to
say, this evoked the ire of the crowd, espe
cially the Notre Dame fans. Notre Dame
is a Catholic university where religion
plays an integral role. A 20-year-old Irish
fan stormed onto the field, shaking Selvik
and proclaimed that he would be damned
for displaying such sacrilege.
"It was just a costume . . . not meant
to offend anyone," Selvik said. But he did
go on to say, "We (the Band) try to insult
everybody equally."
The only major religion for the Band to
show its disrespect for is Islam. Don't be
surprised to see the Band decked out in
turbans some time this season.
As for today's performance, who
knows what will happen? Rumor has it
that the LSJUMB is planning a spoof of
Columbus Day and the discovery of
America. Well, at least the LSJUMB
knows that it can't offend Columbus
he's dead.
