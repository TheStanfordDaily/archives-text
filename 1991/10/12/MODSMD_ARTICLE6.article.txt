# Ozzie wows on kickoff returns
## 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Don't even think about it.
That's what was on the mind
of nearly every spectator as Ozzie
Grenardo hauled in the opening
kickoff of the Colorado game two
weeks ago. He was at least eight
yards inside the end zone with
the defending champion Buf
faloes charging at him in a ram
page.
But in a matter of seconds he
had turned the home crowd into
believers, returning the kick to
the Cardinal's 44-yard line which
set up the game's first score, a
Cardinal touchdown.
"They [the Colorado playersj
were huge and really fast, but
Coach Green told me that if the
ball was three or four yards deep
just to take it out," said Grenar
do, a freshman from Colorado
Springs, CO.
"But I was eight yards deep
and I didn't know where I was. I
even stuttered at first, but then I
just followed the seams that the
blockers opened."
And the excitement that
Grenardo generated did not let
up. On the kickoff following Col
orado's second quarter touch
down, he took advantage of his 5-
foot-9-inch, 165 lb. frame, cutting
and juking his way to a 63-yard
return.
"The blockers did a great job,"
Grenardo said. "All I saw was
green grass and green grass until
I got caught from behind."
"Ozzie got off to a good start,"
said coach Denny Green. "He had
good poise and he provided us
with explosiveness."

Grenardo finished the day
with 134 kickoff return yards.
Last week against Notre Dame,
he had 73 kickoff return yards.
All total, he has 245 yards thus
far this year, tops on the Cardi
nal. With an average of 27.2 yards
per return, he is first in the Pac
-10 and tenth in NCAA Division I.
In all, he trails only running
backs Tommy Vardell and Glyn
Milburn and wide-out Chris
Walsh with 276 all-purpose yards
in Stanford's first four games.
"It felt really great just to get
out and show what I can do,"
Grenardo said after the Colorado
game, "and I knew that everyone
at home would be watching."
"I was really nervous the day
before the game, especially
because I have followed Colorado
football for so long and then saw
last year what they did in the
Orange Bowl," Grenardo said.
Shunned by all universities—
including Colorado—except Stan
ford and Pennsylvania because of
his size, Grenardo said that
Green and his staff overlooked
his dimensions "mostly because

of the role Glyn Milburn has
played here."
"It hurt that people looked at
my size instead of at my talent',
but I just wanted to play for any
team," he said.
"Quickness and speed can be
overrated, but his size is not
much of a factor," Green said.
"He also has such fine eye-hand
coordination that he can catch
the ball in almost any position."
Grenardo played four years at
St. Mary's High School in Col
orado Springs, a small Jesuit
school of 250 students that had 1-
9 seasons during his sophomore
and junior seasons before turning
around the program with a 9-2
campaign in his final year.
"That last good season almost
came too late," Grenardo said.
That season combined with
All-Colorado honors caught the
eyes of Brian Billeck, the recruit
ing coordinator, sending a lucra
tive package of friends from Col
orado Springs, Justin Armour
and Grenardo, to The Farm.
He came to Stanford with the
impression that he would be
"primed" to take over for Milburn
when he graduates in two sea
sons. But Green expects to use
Grenardo now in any capacity
that he will fit in.
Grenardo is more than happy
to shirk the image that he cannot
make it because of his size, but he
is a bit surprised by how quickly
he has become an integral part of
the Cardinal attack.
"I'm surprised I've gotten as
much playing time as I have had,
but the coaches said that if they
didn't have confidence in me they
wouldn't put me in."

He came to Stanford with the
impression that he would be
"primed" to take over for Milburn
when he graduates in two sea
sons. But Green expects to use
Grenardo now in any capacity
that he will fit in.
Grenardo is more than happy
to shirk the image that he cannot
make it because of his size, but he
is a bit surprised by how quickly
he has become an integral part of

"I'm surprised I've gotten as
much playing time as I have had,
but the coaches said that if they
didn't have confidence in me they
wouldn't put me in."

'lt hurt that people
looked at my size
instead of at my
talent, but I just
wanted to play for
any team.'
