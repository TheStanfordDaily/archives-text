# Cavanaugh leads Cardinal offensive front
## 
### Dan McGinnis 
Glen Cavanaugh is the literal
anchor of Stanford's mammoth
offensive line. Known as the
"Road Warriors", this group of
imposing walls averages 6-6 and
300 pounds. Cavanaugh holds
the center position on the line at
6-7 and 295 pounds and says of
the Warriors' immenseness,
"Our size doesn't intimidate the
Colorados or the Notre Dames
but it should have an effect on
Cornell this Saturday."
This size has translated into a
very solid running attack.
Although the Cardinal football
team has been inconsistent in a

number of areas this season, the
running game has remained
untouchable. Even in the 42-26
loss to Notre Dame, Tommy
Vardell alone rushed for 141
yards on just 23 attempts
against the vaunted Irish
defense. Cavanaugh attributes
this success to the "hard work
done in the off-season. Our run
ning game started to come
together at the end of last season
and we've just continued to
improve."
The other duty of the offen
sive line is to protect the quater
back. A task that Cavanaugh
feels the offensive line has per
formed "semi-adequately. It

hasn't been outstanding, but it
hasn't been a weak point either."
Despite the line's solid play,
Cavanaugh still sees room for
improvement. "We need to
improve every game, to come
together more as a group, and to
avoid injuries." Cavanaugh also
feels that he personally needs "to
improve in every aspect of the
game." In the Notre Dame game
during the Card's second posses
sion, a short snap by Cavanaugh
caused a Stanford fumble which
was recovered by the Irish and
resulted in a Notre Dame touch
down.
On the other hand, this is
Cavanaugh's first year playing

the center spot. Last year he
played right guard while Chris
Dalman was the man in the mid
dle. It has been an adjustment.
"There's a big difference
[between being a guard and a
center]. There's a lot more posi
tioning involved and you don't
get that yard of cushioning
between you and the defender.
You're nose to nose on every
play."
Clearly, every pound and
every inch of Glen Cavanaugh
has been on the line going nose
to nose this season. As the cen
tral member of the Road War
riors he plays a vital role in the
Cardinal offense.
