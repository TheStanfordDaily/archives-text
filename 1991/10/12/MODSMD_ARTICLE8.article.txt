# Cornell/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Grant, the senior member of
Cornell's receiving corps, will be
hard-pressed to turn around his
slow start against today against
Gordon. Grant has caught only
three passes so far in the Big
Red's meager passing attack,
averaging 10.3 yards per catch.
Gordon has produced smother
ing coverage in recent weeks,
helping to neutralize wide outs
from Colorado and Notre Dame.
Gordon is also the Cardinal's
fifth-leading tackier with 16.

Walsh has been brilliant so
far this season as Jason
Palumbis' favorite target. He
leads the Pac-10 with 27 recep
tions and is second in receiving
yardage with 94.3 yards per
game. Today Walsh must con
tend not only with the dismissal
of Palumbis, but with the speed
of Ramon Watkins. Watkins,
who led the Big Red in intercep
tions and passes broken up last
season, has already made 25
tackles in 1991, which makes
him Cornell's third leading tack
ier.

Mazoue, one of the Big Red's
most dominating defensive players,
will be forced to focus much of his
attention on the Cardinal's leading
rusher. Vardell turned in his third
consecutive 100-yard performance
last week against Notre Dame.
Stanford, with its huge size advan
tage, should control the trenches
and give Touchdown Tommy a
good chance at tying Darrin Nel
son's school record of four straight
100-yard performances. Mazoue
and linebacker Chirs Zingo have
been the anchors of Cornell's
defense, accounting for 60 tackles
between them in two games.

Hepfer has been anything but
impressive, but you have to give
Cornell the edge in this match-up.
Hepfer is 1-2 in field goal tries this
season, having nailed a 38-yarder.
Mills has missed 5 out of six field
goal tries, including a dismal 0-for
-3 performance against Colorado.
Mills must perform soon, before
Denny Green loses all confidence
in him and starts going on fourth
and-nine from the 17. In addition,
Mills' kickoffs have been incredi
bly short in recent weeks, rarely
reaching the fifteen yard line, and
providing the opposition with
great field position.

Marcus has been the big play
man for the Big Red this season.
The lineman has already had
two sacks and three tackles for a
loss. He'll be matched up against
All-American candidate Whit
field, who has performed well
through Stanford's brutish early
schedule. Not only will Whitfield
be called upon to protect new
starter Stenstrom in the pocket
against Cornell's leading pass
rusher, but you can bet that a
good number of Cardinal run
ning plays will be going over left
tackle.

The Vegas bookmakers have
made the Cardinal 45-point
favorites today and they should
prove themselves clearly superi
or on the field. You would think
that Cornell fans could seek sal
vation in intellectual prowess,
but alas, the almighty ETS gives
Stanford the edge in academia,
as well. The Farm posted an
average SAT score of 1365 on its
way to a No. 3 ranking in U.S.
News' annual poll. The Big Red
could muster only 1280, and the
12th slot in the USN&WR rank
ings.
