GROWING UP WHILE GROWING OLDER. By
Jon Eisenson. Pacific Books, $21.95 ... "Here's
a feel good book about old age. If you haven't
noticed, that category of Americans is
increasing, likely to be in the majority in
another fifty years. And some say that life won't be as
good as it was. The author disagrees. A clinical
psychologist and professor emeritus at Stanford
University, he is not a cockeyed optimist but does believe
that senior citizens will become better off than their
progenitors ... In a mix of personal observations and
extensive scientific evidence, Eisenson tears apart some of
the myths that can get in the way of the good life ... Yes,
mankind is mortal. But that's no reason to miss the best
parts of each age. This book helps make the best of those
final chapters."
— The Book Reader — Sept.-Oct., 1991
