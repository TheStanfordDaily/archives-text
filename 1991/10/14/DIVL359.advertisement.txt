AN ENQUIRY INTO MORALS
"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was like a first child.
Maybe that will always be the best-loved one. But this second
child is the bright one. I think a lot of people will argue with some
of the ideas in LILA. There may be controversy. But if people are
still reading these two books a hundred years from now, I predict
LILA will be the one they consider the more important."
