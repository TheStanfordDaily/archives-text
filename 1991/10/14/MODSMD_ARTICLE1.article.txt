Arson may have caused the fire that
engulfed and gutted the condemned Delta
Tau Delta house early Friday morning,
according to officials investigating the
blaze.
Evidence of forced entry into the build
ing has prompted officials to investigate.
According to Battalion Chief Donald
Dudak of the Palo Alto Fire Department,
"The building was secured, and the utili
ties were off. It leads one to believe there
were suspicious circumstances."
Surrounded by a chain-link fence eight
feet high, the house had been vacant and
boarded up since the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake.
But according to Stanford Fire Marshall
Ray Gamma, "Someone had removed the
plywood from a door on the (north-north
west] side." Gamma inferred, "A person —
intentionally or unintentionally — was
responsible" for the blaze.
Junior Srini Kumar, who was at the
scene of the fire, said, "People have been
breaking into [the house] for a long time
now." He said he did not know how often
the break-ins had occurred.
Reported at 2:03 a.m., the three-alarm

fire shot flames 60 feet into the air and
required 16 pieces of equipment, 48 fire
fighters and five chief officers from Palo
Alto, Mountain View, Menlo Park, Sunny
vale and Los Altos, according to Palo Alto
Asst. Fire Chief Ruben Grijalva.
Sgt. Rick Enberg of Stanford's depart
ment of public safety said he arrived on the
scene two minutes after the fire was
reported and "two to three minutes later,
(the house) was totally engulfed."
Enberg said wind probably would have
spread the fire to neighboring buildings,
since dry grass and oak trees separate them
and the Delt house was quickly being con
sumed.
Other houses in the area "lucked out,"
he said. "The only thing that saved us was
the hour of the morning; (there was) no
wind."
He added, "The thing I feared the most
was the floating embers; this thing went
real high."
Grijalva said the magnitude of the blaze
forced firefighters to contain the fire before
they could extinguish it. The blaze was
under control by 3:08 a.m., he said.
Enberg said he gave residents of houses
within a three-block radius the option to
