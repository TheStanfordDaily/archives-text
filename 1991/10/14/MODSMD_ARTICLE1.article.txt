# Arson suspected in Delta Tau Delta House fire
## 
### Ari Richter Editorial Staff 
Arson may have caused the fire that
engulfed and gutted the condemned Delta
Tau Delta house early Friday morning,
according to officials investigating the
blaze.
Evidence of forced entry into the build
ing has prompted officials to investigate.
According to Battalion Chief Donald
Dudak of the Palo Alto Fire Department,
"The building was secured, and the utili
ties were off. It leads one to believe there
were suspicious circumstances."
Surrounded by a chain-link fence eight
feet high, the house had been vacant and
boarded up since the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake.
But according to Stanford Fire Marshall
Ray Gamma, "Someone had removed the
plywood from a door on the (north-north
west] side." Gamma inferred, "A person —
intentionally or unintentionally — was
responsible" for the blaze.
Junior Srini Kumar, who was at the
scene of the fire, said, "People have been
breaking into [the house] for a long time
now." He said he did not know how often
the break-ins had occurred.
Reported at 2:03 a.m., the three-alarm

fire shot flames 60 feet into the air and
required 16 pieces of equipment, 48 fire
fighters and five chief officers from Palo
Alto, Mountain View, Menlo Park, Sunny
vale and Los Altos, according to Palo Alto
Asst. Fire Chief Ruben Grijalva.
Sgt. Rick Enberg of Stanford's depart
ment of public safety said he arrived on the
scene two minutes after the fire was
reported and "two to three minutes later,
(the house) was totally engulfed."
Enberg said wind probably would have
spread the fire to neighboring buildings,
since dry grass and oak trees separate them
and the Delt house was quickly being con
sumed.
Other houses in the area "lucked out,"
he said. "The only thing that saved us was
the hour of the morning; (there was) no
wind."
He added, "The thing I feared the most
was the floating embers; this thing went
real high."
Grijalva said the magnitude of the blaze
forced firefighters to contain the fire before
they could extinguish it. The blaze was
under control by 3:08 a.m., he said.
Enberg said he gave residents of houses
within a three-block radius the option to

evacuate. Particularly in jeopardy
was the nearby Theta Xi house,
where residents hosed down their
roof in case the flames
approached.
The three-story, wooden Delt
house was built in 1907 and had
recently been the subject of con
troversy as the University
announced in January plans to
demolish it and the neighboring
Synergy house, which was also
condemned after damage sus
tained in the 1989 earthquake.
Anxious to preserve the houses
on San Juan Hill, a group of stu
dents and alumni formed the
Committee to Save the Hill Hous
es and organized efforts to have
the houses declared historic land
marks so the University could not
tear them down.
The committee managed dur
ing the summer to force the Uni
versity to reapply for a permit to
destroy the buildings after the
house was declared historically
significant.
Eric Rose, who helped found
the committee, called the fire "a
setback," adding, "we had it in
our interest to keep (the housesl
standing to preserve them."
Grijalva said an investigation
by the state fire marshall into the
cause of the fire will begin
Wednesday. Eyewitnesses will be
interviewed, and specially trained
dogs will search the remains of
the house "to see if any flammable
liquid or gas has been used," he
said.
Grijalva said the investigation
will be "a process of saying what
the fire was not. You must elimi
nate all (other) possible sources of

ignition before you can say what
the cause was."
He echoed suspicions articulat
ed by Gamma and Dudak but hes
itated to draw any conclusions.
"You have a vacant building, no
occupants, no power," Grijalva
said. "It's a reasonable assump
tion that there was human design
involved. But I'm not calling it
that yet."
Grijalva said Friday that "the
fire was still too hot [to investi
gate]. We called a dog to look for
accelerants; it was too hot for the
dog."
Over the weekend, firefighters
moved debris from the collapsed
building to prepare for the inves
tigation.
Grijalva also said fire officials
"are not working on it full time.
There is no sense of urgency."
Both Grijalva and Gamma said
the possibility of spontaneous
combustion had not yet been
ruled out but said such a scenario
is unlikely.
Grijalva said a guard will be
posted at the house to ensure the
remains are not tampered with
before the investigation gets
underway.
According to Rose, security at
the Delt house before the fire
"was pretty tight; they had pretty
frequent patrols." But, he said, "A
lot of people (went] in," adding,
"every time someone would go in,
[the University would] put up
another board" to seal the entry
point.
Rose said he didn't see anyone
running away from the scene but
added, "I was pretty far away, and
it was dark, of course."
Alumnus Michael Wilkes, a
past Synergy resident, said, "We
were watching for people," but did
not see anyone running from the
direction of the Delt house after

the blaze began.
He said of the fire's early stage:
"It just looked like a couple of
lightbulbs were on.
"Within a minute, the whole
house erupted. The ground all
around was on fire."
Senior Chris Bobbitt, a mem
ber of the Theta Xi fraternity,
added, "What made me nervous is
the lawn started catching on fire."
Rose, who called 911, said, "I
noticed that the right-hand sec
ond- and third-floor windows had
a light in them, flickering. It defi
nitely wasn't a candle; it was just
kind of an even glow."
Kumar said that while the fire
was "very embryonic" when he
first ran up Dolores Street to see
it,"in about a minute, it spread
(throughout the house). It was
really intense — a lot of flames
falling." Kumar added, "Thinking
back on it, I have trouble thinking
it was just normal wood burning."
He said, "It seems a lot like
arson to me — the fact that it was
ripe for the taking. God, the Uni
versity should know better."
Dudak said yesterday,"I
haven't heard of any new evi
dence that would enhance the
investigation."
