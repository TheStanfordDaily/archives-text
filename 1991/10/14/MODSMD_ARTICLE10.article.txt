# Senators search for truth

WASHINGTON (AP) - Which one is
telling the truth?
And how will senators reconcile Anita
Hill's lurid and detailed account of
Clarence Thomas discussing pornography
and sex with Thomas' impassioned and
outraged denial?
"Obviously one of you is not telling the
truth," Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told
Thomas at one point in his testimony.
Unlike two conflicting, eyewitness accounts
of a robbery, for instance, "here it's like two
ships passing in the night; they seem to be
diametrically opposed," he said.
Sen. Paul Simon, D-111., summarized the
dilemma on Saturday, reciting a virtual
ledger of facts supporting each account.
Which account 100 senators choose to
believe will determine whether Thomas is
confirmed tomorrow as a justice on the
Supreme Court.
In Simon's view, the ledger favored
Thomas on these points: Hill followed
Thomas from one government job to anoth
er after the alleged harassment began near
ly a decade ago. Even after leaving govern
ment, Hill still kept in contact with Thomas
through several telephone conversations.
On Hill's side of the ledger, according to
Simon: "She is clearly a reluctant witness
as I sense it," Simon said. "Her motive may
be public service; it's hard to find other
motives." Her account is so vivid it seems
too detailed to be made up, he said.
But Republicans who support Thomas
argue that unless she can prove her allega
tions, the appellate judge deserves to be
promoted to the nation's highest court.
"Without convincing proof to the con
trary," the Senate should confirm Thomas,
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said

yesterday.
Even Joseph Biden, chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, told Thomas
at the conclusion of his testimony that "the
presumption is with you."
Democrats who oppose Thomas already
have questions about his credibility based
on his answers during what he calls the
"real confirmation hearings" in Septem
ber.
Uppermost among doubts voiced by
those Democrats was a disbelief in his insis
tence that he never discussed with anyone
the 1973 Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion — or formed his own
opinion about it.
Republicans have tried to impugn Hill's
motives and the timing of her damaging
allegation, made public nearly a decade
after the alleged events and just before the
Senate's originally scheduled vote on his
nomination.
Thomas' supporters note Hill never
lodged an official complaint about the
alleged incidents and had followed Thomas
from a job in the U.S. Department of Edu
cation to another at the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. She testified
that the harassment began at the first job,
stopped, then began again at the EEOC.
The Republicans cite telephone logs
showing Hill telephoned Thomas at least 11
times after she left the EEOC. And they
have suggested that her motives were polit
ical — that she was pressured to come for
ward by interest groups opposing the nom
ination and Democratic Senate staffers.
But Democrats argue that Hill's reluc
tance to have her charge aired publicly sug
gests she is not the liar Republicans make
her out to be.
