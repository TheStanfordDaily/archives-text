## Wounded pride 
### 
Attention has focused
on Thomas' character
rather than hard issues

ASIDE FROM MEDIA voy
eurs, few Americans have rel
ished the unexpected last
rounds of the Clarence Thomas
nomination hearings. The talk of
the day is not legal issues but the
wounded honor, character flaws
and outrage of the protagonists —
Judge Thomas and Prof. Anita Hill.
This obsession with morality and
character is not surprising — from the
very beginning, speculations about
personality have taken the place of
reasoned analysis of legal issues.
For more than 100 days, Judge
Thomas assured the senators that
he had no particular opinions on
some of the most pressing legal
issues of the day, such as Roe v.
Wade's interpretation of abortion
rights. For a man who prides him
self on his independence of intel
lect, it is exceedingly odd to dis
claim holding opinions on issues
which are not only nationally con
troversial, but which are the basis
of contemporary legal education.
Clearly, Thomas and his advisers
took their lesson from the confir
mation hearings of David Souter:
As long as you don't express a
stance, it cannot be used against
you. Thomas' paper trail is also
flawed. He disavowed his past polit
ical speeches as irrelevant, but only
became a judge on the U.S. Court of
Appeals 18 months ago and so has
written under 20 opinions.
Republicans steered discussion
on Thomas' qualifications to his
fine character — his rise from
poverty, his victory over racism,
his feisty independence, his inspi
rational grandfather. Senator after
senator expressed how proud he
was of Thomas, as if ejrtolling a
precocious child, rather than a
nominee to succeed one of the
finest and most influential justices
of the century.

Democratic senators searching
for painless reasons to oppose him
found little ammunition. Some
swing voters claimed that they
wanted to oppose him but couldn't.
Why not? Uncertainty about a can
didate's legal position is sufficient
reason to oppose him.
When allegations surfaced which
assailed Thomas' character, howev
er, the nomination process derailed.
So now it is the word of Clarence
Thomas and his supporters against
the word of Anita Hill and her sup
porters, judged by a Senate that
seems more concerned with its
image than the actual hearings.
The problem faced by the swing
senators is this: if they believed for
100 days that Clarence Thomas
was telling the truth about his
legal positions, why should they
doubt him now?
But can Thomas' backers hon
estly be surprised at the turn of
events? His honor has been touted
as his prime qualification. When
this is questioned, so is his main
job qualification. If Thomas had a
paper trail he was willing to stand
by, if he had been a judge long
enough to rule on issues of rele
vance to women, his record might
verify his defense.
Thomas may rightfully feel used
by the Senate. But he should also
feel used by the Bush administra
tion for its calculating selection of
him in the first place. A more mod
erate nominee would not have
attracted the degree of opposition
and attention drawn to Judge
Thomas. Or, had the Judiciary Com
mittee taken seriously the early alle
gations of sexual harassment, its
analysis could have taken place in a
less public and less hysterical arena.
None of these possibilities
occurred, however, and most of the
nation has spent this week deciding
who is lying and who is telling the
truth, who is the hero and who is
the villain, who is Best Actor or
Actress in this made-for-TV drama.
The nation is collectively decid
ing all these issues instead of the
crucial one: What should be the
legal future of our nation?
