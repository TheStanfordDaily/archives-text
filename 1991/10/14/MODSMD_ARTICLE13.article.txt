## Myia Johnson On Columbus Day, the time for action is now 
### 
Deep in the heart of the Northern
Rockies, south of Glacier National
Park stands the Rocky Mountain
Front. A spot known as the Badger-Two
Medicine, a sacred part of the Blackfeet
tribe's land, is part of this incredible
place. The U.S. Forest Service and one of
their comrades in crime, "Big Oil," cur
rently have this land under siege.
On this national holiday commemorat
ing Columbus' "discovery" of America,
we must pause to reflect on the current
situation of indigenous people of this
country. We should consider the impacts
of our lifestyle, particularly our modes of
travel, on those people whose culture
depends on maintaining sacred relation
ships with wildlands.
The recent concern about national ener
gy security has driven those charged with
stewardship of our national forests to

remove all barriers to development of poten
tial energy reserves. The decisions being
made about "management" of the Rocky
Mountain Front are precedent setting.
Read the words of the Pikuni Tradi
tionalists, Blackfeet spiritual- leaders:
"Any disturbance in the Badger-Two
Medicine is a desecration of our sacred
place and represents a serious threat to
our ability to practice our religion. The
threat of destruction to this area from
the development agenda set forth by the
Forest Service, and their continued fail
ure to acknowledge our concerns as valid
and legitimate, is literally a threat of cul
tural genocide."
As citizens of this country we are a
part of the threat. What if the grizzly, the
grey wolf, the mountain goat and the
mountains could speak? Fina Oil and
Chemical Co. plans to erect a well less

than two miles from Glacier National
Park. Chevron USA intends to drive a
well into the heart of the Badger at Goat
Mountain. These two proposals would
lead to construction of nearly 25 miles of
new road in a roadless area.
This action will change this sacred
land forever. Furthermore, any natural
gas is likely to contain hydrogen sulfide, a
highly lethal and explosive gas. What has
happened to corporate responsibility?
A Montana grassroots group commit
ted to stopping oil and gas drilling on the
Rocky Mountain Front, explains: "If the
oil and gas industry is allowed to tear up
a roadless wildland area that is sacred
ground, habitat for endangered species,
adjacent to an internationally famous
national park and two wilderness areas,
subject to reserved treaty rights, and is
the most popular candidate for wilder-

ness designation in the state, then they
will be able to drill anywhere!"
As citizens we need to evaluate our use
of oil and natural gas; we need to demand
a national energy policy that does not
allow the rape and pillage of public lands
to continue fueling our addiction. We need
to acknowledge and pay for the destruc
tion caused by our lifestyle. The biggest
obstacles to an energy policy based on con
servation and truly renewable resources
are the executives of large oil corporations
who are pulling political strings to push
through irresponsible policy.
Boycott Chevron USA and American
Petrofina! Get involved in National For
est issues. Ride a bike or walk. Listen to
the earth and heed her call. Stand up for
protection of the Badger-Two Medicine.
