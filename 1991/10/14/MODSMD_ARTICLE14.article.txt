Flier symbolizes oppression, not reverse racism

The Oct. 10 issue of The Daily con
tained a letter from student Dan Blumen
thal entitled, "Party advertisement racist
and destructive." On Oct. 7, The Stanford
Review contained a commentary by
Michael Newman entitled, "Black Frat
Flyer Racist but Politically Correct."
We, the members of Omega Psi Phi
Fraternity, wish to respond to these alle
gations. The purpose of the flier was to
advertise one of our events, but controver
sy has arisen from the artistic expression
we chose to enhance our publicity.
First and foremost, we sincerely apolo
gize for offending anyone. There were sev
eral reasons why we presented an image of
an African warrior holding the severed head
of his enemy, but offending members of the
Stanford community was not among them.

Omega Psi Phi is an organization
whose present membership at Stanford
consists of men of African descent. The
flier advertising this particular party was
based around the three letters, "0.P.P."
— letters which, for us, have several dif
ferent meanings. First "0.P.P." is the title
of a current hit single. The second signifi
cance of "0.P.P." is the fact that these let
ters are the first letters of our fraternity.
The third meaning, around which the
majority of the imagery on the flier was
focused, is a little more abstract. As
oppressed people, we fmd it difficult not to
see the word "oppression" in those three
letters. We decided to use our party's pub
licity to address this sentiment. What
Newman and others saw was an Omega
warrior, sword in one hand, disembodied

head in the other, depicted before an out
line of Africa. What they FAILED to
notice was that the head was NOT that of
a white man — its features were notice
ably blurred to present a multi-ethnic vis
age representing the universal oppressor.
This represented the demise of a uni
versal oppressor, and was not meant to
invoke a "violent expression of hate
directed at.. .the majority of the campus."
Many who have commented on the
flyer were savvy enough to realize that
the alleged "violent expression" was sim
ply a metaphorical artistic rendition. Fur
thermore, those who have given a positive
response to it were not advocating vio
lence; rather, they related to the feelings
of oppression. We appreciate Blumen
thal's level-headed approach to the Issue,

but we reiterate the fact that out inten
tions were not racist.
On the other hand, Newman's com
mentary in The Review exemplifies the
results of narrow-minded and presumptu
ous accusations. His sarcastic and patron
izing tone shows that he is as ignorant to
the oppression that African-Americans
and many others face on a daily basis as he
is to the meaning of "Damn Skippy, We
Wit It!" — a phrase found on our flyer.
We hope that the majority of the cam
pus will see Newman's interpretation for
what it really is — little more than a rab
ble-rousing attempt to create discord
based upon misconceptions and prejudices.
