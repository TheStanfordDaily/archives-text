## A
						view through fire 
### 
IN THE WEE HOURS OF FRIDAY
morning I was awakened by an alarm
ing call: "Fire! The Taxi house is
burning down!" I heard people running
down the service road next to my home,
Roth House. In a state of disbelief, I
climbed out on the roof to see what all the
commotion was about.
I was greeted by an immense orange
ball of flame that illuminated the night
sky. It had a horrendous beauty that at
first was unbelievable. In my mind I kept
making the connection that this huge
bonfire was the Taxi house. If this night
mare was reality, the number of dead
men was going to be staggering.
I ran upstairs and knocked on a
friend's door. I kept seeing my friend
Matt, a Taxi, waking up engulfed by
flames. In my hysterics I kept yelling to
my friend that the Taxi house was on fire.
It took her ten minutes to make me focus
on the Taxi house, visible across the field,
and realize that the sparkling inferno was
the old, unpopulated Delta Tau Delta
house. But those ten minutes burned an
indelible realization into my soul.
I hung out the day before with a friend
of mine discussing the disjointed feeling
we have in our day to day lives at Stan
ford. Everything here always seems so
frenetic. Even at social gatherings, where
the emphasis is more on excitement and
activity, we found ourselves feeling dis
tant with those closest to us.

The two of us had both spent time in
Latin American countries. We had fallen
in love with the easygoing, heartfelt
warmth of the people. We missed the
quick embrace, the ready smile, and the
quality time exhibited among friends and
strangers alike. We both came back to the
States and to Stanford to find a much
colder place and people.
In this time of budget cuts, tightening
financial aid, and student divisions along
political and social lines, Stanford does
seem to be a cold place. I've seen my
freshman group of friends dwindle from
an innumerable posse to a tried and true
handful of people. As I become more
focused and begin to lose my aimless
ways, I find myself devoted to selfish pur
suits, having little time for the all-night
conversations or spontaneous excursions
that used to brighten my world.
I've gone through the past year feeling
few things. The indirect cost scandal, the
Centennial protest, etc., never got too far
past the cerebral level. But in these 10
minutes I realized how much I really care.
Beyond Matt and a few other guys I
don't really know any Taxis. When I saw
that fire and imagined them in there, it
was just as awful as if I had known every
one of them. I felt like I was the one in
that Hell. It didn't matter what race or
sexual orientation they were, or what
political beliefs they had; they were my
peers, my friends. They were people.

That fire made me realize how much I
care and why I care about this place. The
beautiful weather and lovely campus are
nice externals, but what makes this place,
or any other, is the people. I realized that
in Mexico I had taken time out to enjoy
the people. I had paid attention to the
importance human beings can make in
each others' lives, if only by making a
gesture of showing true concern or feel
ing.
Perhaps the coldness I found coming
back to Stanford was directly related to
my lack of attachment. I spent little time
getting involved with other people and
trying to make a difference in any other
life besides my own. I was guilty of the
same insular, selfish behavior that I crit
icized. It took the brightness of that fire
to show me just how important people
can be.
They say you don't know what you've
got until it's gone. I feel mighty lucky
that the fire let me remember what inter
esting, wonderful people I'm surrounded
by without taking any of them away.

Tamala Edwards says this of the
Thomas-Hill debate: "My mind is play
ing tricks on me. ..."
