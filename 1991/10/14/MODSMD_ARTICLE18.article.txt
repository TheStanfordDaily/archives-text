The Daily's coverage of
of Casa Zapata incident
merits praise, not scorn
The Daily is taking an undeserved
beating for its coverage of the alleged
rape at Casa Zapata. In fact, its coverage
has been professional, sensitive, accu
rate and thorough.
The investigating officer's report was
made a public record by the authorities,
not obtained surreptitiously by the
newspaper. While the details are shock
ing and cause distress to many people
including friends of both parties, The
Daily certainly had a right to publish
them. Whether it should is a matter of
opinion, but not to have done so would
have subjected The Daily to criticism for
concealing information. Ideally, the pub
lication will have a salutary impact by
making student readers more aware of
what conduct — probably more common
than we'd like to admit — puts them at
personal or legal risk.
One critic asks why The Daily named
the man and not the woman. The answer
is simple. The man was charged with a
crime, and the charge is a matter of pub
lic record. Newspapers traditionally have
not printed the name of a rape victim
unless she gives permission, particularly
when she is a minor as in this case.
Agree with this tradition or not, The

Daily did as most newspapers would.
The complaint by Familia Zapata
was heartfelt, and one understands their
anguish. But there is a misunderstand
ing here about the proper role of the
press and of how reporters should and
do operate. The press' role is to get the
information and to print the news, not
to go easy or to suppress news because it
is unpleasant for people to read.
Better to get this out in the open,
with at least the hope that ultimately
there will be a beneficial social effect.

said, "is the best of disinfectants."

Columnist distorted and
misquoted the content
of Yom Kippur speech
In his Oct. 3 column, "Don't Break up
my Family," Dan Rosen expressed confu
sion about the brief speech I gave during
Yom Kippur services. I feel the need to
straighten out some of the statements he
made.
Mr. Rosen's summary of my talk was a
bit flawed. But even assuming that I had
said what he quoted me as saying, the
conclusions he drew from my statements
were sadly illogical.

It is understandable that among thou
sands of listeners, some would get a bit
confused. But most distressing is that
Mr. Rosen had already approached me
after the services and had voiced his con
cerns. I expressed misgivings that he had
gotten the wrong message.
I assured him that nobody thought
that he or anyone else was anti-Semitic
just because he did not support Israeli
loan guarantees.
Mr. Rosen displayed a lack of profes
sionalism by choosing to write about his
confusions as though they were shared by
everyone else — especially since he failed
to mention that he had talked with me
and that I (and the rest of the onlookers)
had expressly disavowed the statements
and conclusions he was attributing to me.
Whether or not you support the loan
guarantees is beside the point. The
important matter is that we understand
the issue at stake.
Refugee resettlement is of vital impor
tance: it is a humanitarian issue, not a
political one. Accepting Soviet-Jewish
refugees who are escaping racism or
oppression should not be made contin
gent on any other matter, just as, in my
opinion, helping resettle the Palestinians
— whether in Israel, the United States,
Jordan, Syria, or a Palestinian homeland
— should not become contingent on the
political dreams of a few authoritarian
leaders.
It is sad when people become pawns in

a geopolitical game, and individual digni
ty yields to supra-nationalistic fanaticism.
I hope Mr. Rosen will agree that a
refugee's dream of breathing freedom and
self-respect should not be quelled by
politicization.

The Band's offensive
antics smacked of
Ku Klux Klan hate march
As a young child growing up in a small
southern Ohio town, I often watched in
shock as the robed Ku Klux Klan parad
ed past my home to a nearby farm where
they ceremoniously burned a large cross.
Their actions were directed at the com
munity's Roman Catholic families.
Stanford staged a modern day version
of that same scenario during the half
time of the Stanford-Notre Dame game.
The Band forced a captive audience of
70,000 people to sit through a perfor
mance which could only be interpreted
as an outrageous expression of religious
bigotry. Highlighting the demonstration
was a member dressed as a Catholic nun
and carrying a cross who cavorted about
the field in an ugly, mocking and de
meaning manner.
There is an expression that anti-
Catholicism is the intellectual's anti-

Semitism. Obviously, anti-Catholicism is
thriving at Stanford.

Deceased doctor with
three wives a tribute
to medical excellence
I read with interest the Oct. 9 article
entitled: "The Marrying Man —
Deceased Surgeon Left Three Wives"
regarding the late Norman Lewiston,
professor of pediatrics.
I was not saddened by this news
because after hearing of his death I knew
that sick children had lost a competent
and compassionate physician and that
the world had lost a top-notch researcher.
His private life and those of his wives are
nobody's business but their own.
If any of my family was in need of
medical care, I would be glad to have had
them treated by as fine a man and as
fine a physician as Dr. Lewiston, and I
would not care if he had 1,000 wives.
And so I say to Diarmuid McGuire,
spokesperson for the Children's Hospi
tal: Do not be dismayed, just keep busy
trying to find someone as good as Nor
man Lewiston, M.D. The children
deserve nothing less.

Columnist distorted and
misquoted the content
of Yom Kippur speech
In his Oct. 3 column, "Don't Break up
my Family," Dan Rosen expressed confu
sion about the brief speech I gave during
Yom Kippur services. I feel the need to
straighten out some of the statements he
made.
Mr. Rosen's summary of my talk was a
bit flawed. But even assuming that I had
said what he quoted me as saying, the
conclusions he drew from my statements
were sadly illogical.

It is understandable that among thou
sands of listeners, some would get a bit
confused. But most distressing is that
Mr. Rosen had already approached me
after the services and had voiced his con
cerns. I expressed misgivings that he had
gotten the wrong message.
I assured him that nobody thought
that he or anyone else was anti-Semitic
just because he did not support Israeli
loan guarantees.
Mr. Rosen displayed a lack of profes
sionalism by choosing to write about his
confusions as though they were shared by
everyone else — especially since he failed
to mention that he had talked with me
and that I (and the rest of the onlookers)
had expressly disavowed the statements
and conclusions he was attributing to me.
Whether or not you support the loan
guarantees is beside the point. The
important matter is that we understand
the issue at stake.
Refugee resettlement is of vital impor
tance: it is a humanitarian issue, not a
political one. Accepting Soviet-Jewish
refugees who are escaping racism or
oppression should not be made contin
gent on any other matter, just as, in my
opinion, helping resettle the Palestinians
— whether in Israel, the United States,
Jordan, Syria, or a Palestinian homeland
— should not become contingent on the
political dreams of a few authoritarian
leaders.
It is sad when people become pawns in

a geopolitical game, and individual digni
ty yields to supra-nationalistic fanaticism.
I hope Mr. Rosen will agree that a
refugee's dream of breathing freedom and
self-respect should not be quelled by
politicization.

The Band's offensive
antics smacked of
Ku Klux Klan hate march
As a young child growing up in a small
southern Ohio town, I often watched in
shock as the robed Ku Klux Klan parad
ed past my home to a nearby farm where
they ceremoniously burned a large cross.
Their actions were directed at the com
munity's Roman Catholic families.
Stanford staged a modern day version
of that same scenario during the half
time of the Stanford-Notre Dame game.
The Band forced a captive audience of
70,000 people to sit through a perfor
mance which could only be interpreted
as an outrageous expression of religious
bigotry. Highlighting the demonstration
was a member dressed as a Catholic nun
and carrying a cross who cavorted about
the field in an ugly, mocking and de
meaning manner.
There is an expression that anti-
Catholicism is the intellectual's anti-

Semitism. Obviously, anti-Catholicism is
thriving at Stanford.

Deceased doctor with
three wives a tribute
to medical excellence
I read with interest the Oct. 9 article
entitled: "The Marrying Man —
Deceased Surgeon Left Three Wives"
regarding the late Norman Lewiston,
professor of pediatrics.
I was not saddened by this news
because after hearing of his death I knew
that sick children had lost a competent
and compassionate physician and that
the world had lost a top-notch researcher.
His private life and those of his wives are
nobody's business but their own.
If any of my family was in need of
medical care, I would be glad to have had
them treated by as fine a man and as
fine a physician as Dr. Lewiston, and I
would not care if he had 1,000 wives.
And so I say to Diarmuid McGuire,
spokesperson for the Children's Hospi
tal: Do not be dismayed, just keep busy
trying to find someone as good as Nor
man Lewiston, M.D. The children
deserve nothing less.

The Daily's coverage of
of Casa Zapata incident
merits praise, not scorn
The Daily is taking an undeserved
beating for its coverage of the alleged
rape at Casa Zapata. In fact, its coverage
has been professional, sensitive, accu
rate and thorough.
The investigating officer's report was
made a public record by the authorities,
not obtained surreptitiously by the
newspaper. While the details are shock
ing and cause distress to many people
including friends of both parties, The
Daily certainly had a right to publish
them. Whether it should is a matter of
opinion, but not to have done so would
have subjected The Daily to criticism for
concealing information. Ideally, the pub
lication will have a salutary impact by
making student readers more aware of
what conduct — probably more common
than we'd like to admit — puts them at
personal or legal risk.
One critic asks why The Daily named
the man and not the woman. The answer
is simple. The man was charged with a
crime, and the charge is a matter of pub
lic record. Newspapers traditionally have
not printed the name of a rape victim
unless she gives permission, particularly
when she is a minor as in this case.
Agree with this tradition or not, The

Daily did as most newspapers would.
The complaint by Familia Zapata
was heartfelt, and one understands their
anguish. But there is a misunderstand
ing here about the proper role of the
press and of how reporters should and
do operate. The press' role is to get the
information and to print the news, not
to go easy or to suppress news because it
is unpleasant for people to read.
Better to get this out in the open,
with at least the hope that ultimately
there will be a beneficial social effect.
