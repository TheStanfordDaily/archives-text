# Financial gains expected despite lack of insurance
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford has not maintained
insurance on the Delta Tau Delta
house for several months, but
may still stand to gain financially
from the fire that consumed the
building Friday morning, accord
ing to University officials.
The potential dividend could
come from the Federal Emergen
cy Management Agency, which is
helping to finance the repair and
replacement of University struc
tures damaged in the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
Stanford's FEMA grant for the
earthquake-damaged Delt house
— which amounts to some
$60,000 — had been in jeopardy
because of claims that the turn-of
the-century building was historically
significant. As a matter of policy,
FEMA does not make grants for a
project that involves the demolition
of a historically significant structure.
The University planned to
demolish the house as well as near
by Synergy and construct faculty
housing on the site.
But as a result of the fire, the Uni
versity is no longer put in the posi
tion of demolishing the Delt house,
and that may secure the FEMA
grant, according to Facilities Project
Manager Fouad Bendimerad.
"It's hard to say until we exam

ine the regulations," Bendimerad
said. "But it seems as if we may now
get the grant."
The University no longer had an
insurance policy on the Delt house,
according to Risk Management
Director Robert Beth.
"The buildings were scheduled
to be demolished. Their value was
considered to be null," Beth said.
The University had terminated the
policy "this summer, as soon as the
original demolition permit was
issued," he added.
The University obtained demo
lition permits for the Delt House
and nearby Synergy in August.
Days before the demolition was to
begin, however, a group of
activists who opposed the demoli
tion — on grounds that the build

ings are historic — successfully
challenged the University's demo
lition permits in court.
The University has applied for a
new set of permits.
Beth added that even if the
University had maintained insur
ance on the fraternity house, it
would not have collected anything,
as Stanford's insurance policy in
cludes a deductible of $1 million.
The value of the quake-damaged
house was "significantly less than
that," Beth said.
The University did maintain lia
bility insurance on the house, in the
event that intruders might have
been injured there, he added.
Bulldozing the Delt house would
have cost the University $50,000,
Beth said.
