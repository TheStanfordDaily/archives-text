## Sentimental mismatch: Card clobbers Cornell 
### David Schwartz Editorial Staff 
They came, they saw, and they (thank
fully) left.
That about sums up the weekend for
the Cornell football team.
Many of the Big Red players had never
been to California. And after this weekend,
they probably don't want to come back —
at least not to play football.

Cardinal 56
Big Red 6

Before a sparse crowd of 30,347 at Stan
ford Stadium, the Cardinal crushed Cor
nell, 56-6. Stanford put the game out of
reach early, piling up three quick touch
downs to lead 21-0 at the end of the first
quarter. On the Cardinal's first drive, the
team was faced with third-and-28 from the
Cornell 42-yard line. Quarterback Steve
Stenstrom fired a 24-yard pass to Chris
Walsh over the middle, setting up fourth
and-four. With the limited student section
chanting "Go! Go!" Stenstrom hit Walsh
for a five-yard gain. A few plays later,
"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell scored from
two yards out.
The second Cardinal drive provided a
milestone of sorts, as Stenstrom complet
ed a touchdown pass to Walsh, the first for
Stanford all season. "It was nice to get a
touchdown. I was a little antsy to get one,"
Walsh said. Vardell scored his 28th career
goal on a one-yard plunge on the third
scoring drive. The Cardinal added two
more scoring drives in the second period as
Coach Denny Green began to clear the
bench en route to a 35-0 halftime margin.
Denny Green was in a very delicate sit
uation, trying on one hand not to run up
the score, while on the other trying to give
his regulars a decent amount of playing
time. "Its tough [to do]," he said. "You try

to substitute as much as you can ... I'm
upset that Tommy (Vardell) and Glyn
(Milburn) didn't get as many carries as
they should, but that's how it goes."
On the positive side, many players that
do not normally see action got to get in the
game for the Cardinal. "Everybody played
who wasn't being redshirted," Green said.
Strange faces made significant contribu
tions.
Backup kicker Josh Madsen took over
for Aaron Mills in the second half, hitting
all three of his extra point attempts.
"Aaron is still the kicker, but I think you
have to have two kickers ready, so other
teams know that you're not just one deep,"
Green said. "We wanted Josh to get some
experience kicking the ball, and he did a
good job."
But Green also went for it on fourth
down three times in the first half, opting
against having Mills attempt field goals
that would have been 35, 32, and 29 yards.
"You try to maintain the ball. I don't think
there was any time when we were deliber
ately trying to score," Green said.
In terms of excitement in the first half,
that belonged to Cornell. In the second
quarter, the Big Red offense caught the
Cardinal defense completely off guard.
Cornell lined up eight players to the right
of long snapper/backup tight end Dan
Brannon, with quarterback Sean Andreas
in a shotgun formation. After snapping the
ball, Andreas completed a 14-yard pass to
Brannon for Cornell's first first-down of
the game. Cornell coach Jim Hofher said,
"I think it caught them by surprise. Fresh
man coach Pete DeStefano came up with it
on Wednesday, and it helped us get going a
little bit in the first half." Cardinal Coach
Denny Green commented, "They call it the
Daffy Duck or the Lily Duck. Utah used to
do it in the old days. I think it added a lit
tle juice for them, it got them pretty excit
ed, and they got a first down out of it."

the second half, racking up 56
points before Cornell managed to
score its lone touchdown.
Throughout the game, the Stan
ford offense was effective in mov
ing the ball large distances on a
relatively few number of plays.
"We executed the offense well,"
Stenstrom said. He completed 16
of 23 passes for 235 yards and one
touchdown.
The Cardinal's last touchdown
was all the work of one man,
freshman Ozzie Grenardo.
Grenardo dazzled as he returned
Big Red punter Greg Greene's 37
yard punt 81 yards, good for the
second longest punt return in
Stanford history. "The wall

(blockers) did a great job,"
Grenardo said. "When I got out
side, nobody was there. "
Cornell finally got on the score
board with 10:22 to play in the
final period, driving 74 yards in
eight plays. Tailback John McNiff
ran three yards around right end
for the score.
On the ensuing kickoff, Cornell
once again used the element of
surprise to their advantage. The
Big Red lined its entire kicking
team to the left of Hepfer for an
onside kick, except for cornerback
Ramon Watkins, who lined up far
right. Yet Hepfer kicked right,
catching the Stanford special
teams off guard, and Watkins
recovered. But despite the urg
ings of the Cornell faithful to
"Beat the spread!" (45 points),
the Big Red was unable to get the
ball into the end zone again.
