Cardinal 3, Beavers 0
Cardinal 3, Ducks 0

With its 14th and 15th wins of the sea
son coming this weekend over hapless
Oregon State and Oregon, the Cardinal
tied and then overtook the record held by
the 1985 team, which opened the season
with 14 straight wins.
The outcome of both weekend match
es was never in doubt. Stanford just had
more of everything in overcoming their
Pacific 10 Conference foes, winning each

contest in three games.
Oregon State faced the Cardinal's
offensive machine first, and they could
not do a thing against it. The Beavers
came on the trip without their starting
setter, Christine Camp, and their second
most productive hitter, Amy Svikhart,
and those two were sorely missed. Stan
ford outplayed Oregon State in every
facet of the match, outhitting the
Beavers .255 to .082 and tallying more
kills and digs as they won 15-2, 15-12, 15-
4.
"We played pretty well in game one,
but then we. . .played down to their level
[in game two). We did a decent job of
picking it up again in game three,
though.
"When you know they don't have their
top setter, it's sometimes hard to get
motivated," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said.
"We let our concentration drop in
game two," senior captain Kristin Klein

said.
Klein's focus must not have been too
low since she led the Cardinal with 12
digs and 15 kills, hitting .367 for the
match. Junior Bev Oden added nine kills
and a team-high 13 digs, and senior
Nicole Appleman contributed seven kills
and hit .364. Senior Amy Cooper found a
huge groove and pounded eight kills for a
phenomenal .636 percentage. (Hitting
percentage equals (Hits — errors)/total
attempts.)
The Oregon Ducks were supposed to
provide a slightly greater challenge for
Stanford. Despite its dismal 1-6 confer
ence record, the Ducks were 11-8 overall
and were generally considered a better
team than the Beavers.
With injuries to middle-blocker
Mindee Adams and setter Molly
McGrath, both seniors, Oregon did not
present much of a threat to the Cardinal
as Stanford won easily, 15-11, 15-2, 15-7.
In the first game the Ducks actually led

for a time and the Cardinal looked flat
and unenthusiastic on defense. After
Oregon increased their lead to 8-4, how
ever, Stanford got fired up and began a
comeback, forcing Duck errors and block
ing well.
"We were a little lethargic at first, but
then we picked it up," Shaw said.
After cruising to victory in the first
game, the Cardinal seemed to coast
through game two, looking methodical
and efficient as they dismantled the Ore
gon defense while hitting .333 as a team.
Game three provided the crowd at
Burnham Pavilion a chance to view the
Stanford team of the future, as junior
Kristi Paaso, sophomore Piper Hahn,
and freshmen Denise Rotert and Anne
Wicks all got extensive playing time. The
future looks pretty bright for the Cardi
nal because all of them played well, with
Rotert hitting .429 for the game and
Wicks crushing match point through an
Oregon block.

"[The freshmen] came in and did a
real nice job. They came in and played
really aggressively," Shaw said.
"It was fun to play—we kept up the
intensity in the third game," Wicks said.
"I've been working really hard on my
front-row play, so I was happy to get up
there and play," Rotert said.
The successful weekend gives Stan
ford some momentum as they head into
what will certainly be the worst road trip
of the year, playing next Friday at No. 9
USC and then Saturday night at No. 4
archrival UCLA.
"It was nice to fmish big. Especially
the way we finished tonight, we got a
good kick in the right direction. This puts
us in the position we wanted to be in.
We're in first place in the Pac-10 and can
solidify it this next weekend.
"We need to have a good week of prac
tice and primarily do what we do best. We
can't worry about (USC and UCLA],"
Shaw said.

leyball team is off to the best start in
