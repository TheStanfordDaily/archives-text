# Linksters to defend titles
## 
### Tish Williams 
Audrey Wooding and the Stan
ford women's golf team return to
Seattle this week to defend their
respective titles as individual and
team champions of last year's
Washington Intercollegiate.
The Cardinal enters the Oct.
14-16 tournament with some
steep goals.
"Our main competition will be
Arizona, who beat us last week by
42 shots. We expect to at least cut
that in half," coach Tim Baldwin
said.
Reaching that goal is made
more likely by the return of
senior Adele Moore, who missed
last week's competition.
"USC beat us by four shots at
the Sun Devil Invitational last
week," said Baldwin, of the other
Stanford rival adding, "they are
strong, but so are we."
The Cardinal will take five
golfers to the Invitational, includ
ing Melinda Daniels, Martha
Richards, Audrey Wooding, Adele
Moore, and Amy Lawrence.
Last week, the team had quali
fiers to see which golfers would
travel to Seattle to represent
Stanford. Daniels and Richards
didn't have to qualify, after com
ing within two shots of the course
rating at the Sun Devil Invite.
Wooding was exempt from
qualifying as well, as returning
champ of the Washington Inter
collegiate.
"This is one of the finest cours
es we play all year," said Baldwin.
"It's very difficult; it's all tree
lined. It is perhaps the most beau
tiful course we play on .. . but the
course is really demanding."
