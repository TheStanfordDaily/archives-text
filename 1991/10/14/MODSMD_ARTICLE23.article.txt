# Booters mow down Cornell in shut-out

### Uri Attia Senior Staff Writer 
Whenever the 1991 Cardinal women's
soccer team plays a game, it wins.
Does that make Stanford an exciting
team to watch, or a boring one?

Women's soccer

Cardinal 1
Big Red 0

Well, whether they're thrilling or
yawn-inspiring in their pursuit of a
national title, the Cardinal continued to
do what they do best — steamroll by their
opponents. Although the team's offense
suffered due to the absence of Julie
Foudy, one of the best players in all of
collegiate soccer, the defense was a strong
as ever.
Sophomore Leslie Garrard notched
her fourth consecutive shutout as the
Cardinal defeated the Cornell Big Red, 1-
0. The lone goal of the game came when
the other half of Stanford's dynamic duo
on offense, sophomore Sarah Rafanelli,
scored what proved to be the game's win
ning goal in the first half.
Although Stanford controlled the
game from the beginning, the game fea
tured an uncharacteristic amount of
action of Stanford's side of the field.
Much like the Duke contest, which was
another 1-0 game dominated by the Car
dinal, the score was not indicative of
Stanford's level of play.
"The Cornell game was tougher than
the Duke game because Cornell wasn't as
much of a clearing team," sophomore
fullback Anita Koshy said. She went on to
discuss how Cornell's play was much less
conservative than the Blue Devils'

approach, which essentially consisted of
putting everyone on defense and hoping
that they would catch a break.
"Cornell was a key game for us
because it helped us prove that we could
win without Julie," Koshy went on.
"Some people feel that Julie's our only
player. . .without her in there, it forced
us to pass around a little more and to set
tle down on offense."
Foudy wasn't the only player missing
from the Card starting lineup, as both
freshman fullback Kristen Wair and
sophomore midfielder Jen Gardiner were
sidelined with minor injuries.
"We have pretty good depth on this
team," Koshy said. "I think that the Cor
nell game proved that." Both players
should rejoin the team along with Foudy
for Monday's game against Virginia.
The Cornell game was, as expected, a
very physical contest, with much aggres
sive play on both sides. However, the offi
cials in the game had very quick whistles
and were calling fouls much more regu
larly than in earlier games.
This is probably due to the complaints
of head coach Berhane Andeberhan,
whose protests of the Blue Devils' violent
play earned him a yellow card in Stan
ford's previous game. The officials were
much more attentive in this game, and
made several calls in Stanford's favor
that upset the surprisingly large number
of Cornell fans in attendance at the game.
After the contest, it was obvious that
No. 15 Cornell had joined the growing
ranks of teams that are gaining new lev
els of respect for the Cardinal soccer pro
gram. Big Red forward Amy Finkelstein
had this to say: "That was the toughest
game we've played all year. Those guys
are good."
Good, but boring.
