Fear not, Cardinal soccer fans. Team captain
Rhett Harty returned to the Stanford lineup to help
his squad squelch the Cornell Big Red 2-0 after the
NCAA cleared him of a possible suspension.

After Harty laid down his cleats for loafers last
week to appear on the front cover of The Daily's
Intermission section as a fashion model, he unwit
tingly challenged NCAA rules.
Unbeknown to Harty, The Daily quoted the
prices of his ensemble. The NCAA considered sus
pending him for implicit advertising, or using his
name and sport to endorse a product. Ironically,
Harty modeled his own clothes.
When Harty learned of his transgressions, he
immediately wrote a letter to Jerry Porras, the
NCAA representative at Stanford. Porras then filed
a report to the NCAA.
Harty learned only 30 minutes before Stanford
faced the Big Red that the NCAA had cleared him.
Watching his teammates' sluggish play from the
sidelines, Harty finally entered the game with 10
minutes remaining in the first half. The Cardinal's
play immediately improved.
Three minutes into the next period, Jim Talluto
rocketed a loose ball past the Cornell goaltender into
the left corner, putting Stanford in the lead, 1-0.
It was Talluto's ninth goal of the season, giving
him a team-leading 21 points. The junior has racked
up a score or an assist in nine of the squad's 13

games.
Talluto's blast gave the Cardinal a noticeable
burst of energy, and it scored again five minutes late
when Ryan Collins pushed the ball to the right side
of the penalty box and chipped a cross to Robert Bro
phy.
Brophy then poked the ball into the net to notch
his first goal of the season, and Collins' fourth
assist.
The Cardinal, however, could not break open the
game. The squad held on to its 2-0 lead as Cornell
never truly threatened, dropping the Big Red to 1-6-
1.
Despite that fact, Coach Colin Lindores was
annoyed with his team's sloppy performance. In par
ticular, he was upset with the Cardinal's inability to
score.
"Good teams and good individuals get goals," Lin
dores said.
Nonetheless, midfielder Jason Vanacour was
pleased to get another victory. "These are the kind
of games we need to win," he said. "It was a little
sloppy and not as crisp as we need to be for Santa
Clara, but there were some positive things."
Lindores denied that his team was looking ahead
to its Friday night match against the No. 1-ranked
team in the country, Santa Clara. "Every game is a
chore," he said.
Next week's match will be no exception. The 8-2-
3 Cardinal has already faced six top-20 teams, but
Santa Clara represents its toughest competition of
the year.
But the Cardinal eagerly awaits stepping into the
limelight.
"We have a great shot at winning," Harty said.
"We've always played Santa Clara tough and we're
ripe and ready for a big victory."
With him back in the line-up, the Cardinal just
might prove its captain correct.
