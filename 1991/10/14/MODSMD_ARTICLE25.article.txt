# Card second-string shines against Big Red
## 
### Amy Howard Staff Writer 
When the band starts playing
"All Right Now" after the other
team scores, it's usually safe to
classify the game as a blowout.
Such was the case Saturday, as
the Cardinal massacred the Cor
nell Big Red 56-6. It would be
very easy to write off the entire
affair as a token game, with little
bearing on either team's division
ranking or overall status. After
all, Cornell has its own comfort
able niche carved out as last
year's Ivy League co-champion,
and the Cardinal has six upcom
ing Pacific 10 Conference oppo
nents on its mind. The two teams
have never met before, and

according to Big Red coach Jim
Hofher, they probably won't be
meeting again for a long, long
time. So, maybe for some people,
the game was no big deal.
But for some others, it was.
Those "others" include all of
the second, third and fourth-team
players who work hard before and
during the season but who rarely
get the chance to take the field
and show their stuff. Saturday's
game gave them the opportunity
to do just that, and they did it
with style, thank you very much.
The game was full of high
lights by a different cast of play
ers than the Cardinal fans are
accustomed to seeing. There was
No. 39a Mike Buckley, a junior
walk-on running back, barreling

his way into the end zone twice.
And then there was No. 39b Scott
Lange, who may not have his own
jersey number yet, but who car
ried the ball twice. True fresh
man Josh Madsen got his chance
to contribute three extra points
for the Cardinal, and sophomore
running back Ethan Allen added
six points on a 1-yard run in the
second quarter.
Freshman Ozzie Grenardo
continued to dazzle everyone
with his speed, as he cut inside
and then went to the wall for an
81-yard punt return and his first
collegiate touchdown. "It was
fun," he said. "It's what I used to
do in high school, just wait
around for something to open up.
It was nice to be able to do that

again."
While traditional powerhouses
like fullback Tommy Vardell saw
less playing time due to the sub
stitutions, there were no hard
feelings about giving some other
players a few moments in the
sun.
"It's a great opportunity for
the other players to get in there
and have a chance to play,"
Vardell said. "It reunites the
family approach and the idea that
everyone is contributing, so it's
very important."
Since the Cardinal returns to
its grueling schedule on Satur
day, taking on USC in Southern
California, it may be the last time
some of the family members set
foot on the green turf for a while.
