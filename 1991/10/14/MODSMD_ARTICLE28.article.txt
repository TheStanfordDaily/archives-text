# Conflagration continues to raise emotions, questions
## House fire was 'like a bonfire times 10,000' 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Isaac Kato received a wake-up
call at the Theta Xi fraternity
house around 2 a.m. Friday. "We
thought it was a roll-out," the
senior said, referring to the pre
dawn wake-up practice.
It was an evacuation.
Friday morning's fire had
turned the neighboring Delta
Tau Delta house into a giant
torch that threatened to set
ablaze the Taxi's house.
Students and staff, police and
fire officials converged at the
hilltop house for 60 anxious and
awesome minutes until firefight
ers contained the blaze, which
burned throughout the night.
"I have never seen anything
quite like it in my life," said
sophomore Benjamin Gutkin, his
face brightened by the glow of
the flames. "It's just incredible."
The fire spread throughout
the house quickly. One eyewit
ness in the Taxi house said he
saw the fire start in a corner of
the Delt house. "By the time I
closed my window and got out
side, the whole thing had gone
up," he added.
Flames shot nearly 60 feet
into the night and were visible
from Interstate 280. One fire
official later said the fire was
"like a bonfire times 10,000."
At the Delta house the climax
of the fire arrived suddenly, spec
tacularly. At 2:36 a.m. the roof of
the burning structure came
crashing down to the collective
sigh of onlookers.
The clamoring of fire engines
and sounds from the fire roused
some campus dwellers from their
sleep.
"I heard it. . . . I live at 619
Mayfield," said Sally Mahoney,
acting vice president of student
resources, as she stood across the
street from the burning house. "I
thought it was raining [because
of the sound of crackling fire.]"
Keri Bolding, standing about
50 yards from the firefighters,
had seen the orange glow of

flames from her dormitory. "I
was really upset," the freshman
said. "When something on my
campus is burning, I want to
know what, and I want to know
why."
More than 300 equally curi
ous and awestruck onlookers cir
cled the perimeter of the house,
and as many gathered at the
intersection of Mayfield and
Dolores where police had closed
the road.
In the throes of flames, fire
officials grappled with problems
of low water pressure. "Where's
my water?" yelled one firefighter.
The water cannons initially
spurted weak arches of water.
After more fire engines arrived
to help pump water up the hill,
pressure was restored, and the
water cannons cut down flames.
Taxi members fought a water
war of their own, dousing nearby
trees and the roof of their house;

both were threatened by glowing
embers spewed out from the
burning house. "I don't want to
see anything else go up," said
John Hamilton, a senior, as he
filled buckets with water.
The surge in water usage sent
ripple effects across campus.
Roble residents were awakened
by fire alarms triggered by low
water pressure in the dorm.
"They told us there was no
emergency in Roble but that
there was a big fire on San
Juan," said Nikki Walker a resi
dent assistant in Roble. "So the
water pressure drops here, and
we get awakened at four in the
morning."
The light of day revealed the
extent of the fire's damage. The
house that had stood since 1907
was reduced to charred wood,
twisted metal and smoldering
bricks. Still standing was a part
of a wall, now blackened, with a

fire escape attached to it.
Billows of thick smoke gushed
out from the burnt-out hollow of
the basement. "There's so much
heat down there that it's like a
giant barbecue pit," said Capt.
Keith Ramsey of the Palo Alto
Fire Department as he pointed at
the smoke.
Later Friday morning fire
fighters hovered a hydraulic lad
der with a water cannon over the
burned remains to flush out hid
den fires.
While fire officials say the
worst is over — there were no
severe injuries reported, and the
fire was contained — the investi
gation into the cause has now
begun. "We took care of this
puppy," boasted Mark Shah, a
firefighter with the Palo Alto
Police Department.

The charred remains of the Delt house sit in relative quiet. The fire created some lasting impressions
for nearby students. Witness Freshman Keri Bolding said, "I was really upset. When something on my
campus is burning, I want to know what and I want to know why."
