# Historic Delt house burns; hill controversy remains
## 
### Christine Dal Bello 
The fiery demise of the Delta
Tau Delta house Friday morning
added yet another interesting
twist to the fight to save the San
Juan Hill houses.
Before the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, four student houses
were located on San Juan Hill —
Synergy, the old Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity house and the resi
dences of the Delta Tau Delta
and Theta Xi fraternities. As was
the case with many of the older
buildings on campus, they were
all badly damaged by the earth
quake, and residents had to be
relocated to other locations on
campus.
Originally, the University
planned to repair all four of these
houses and have them available
for student use again in the fall of
1991, said Paul Baer, a member
of the Committee to Save the Hill
Houses.
The Theta Xi house was
repaired along with some other
houses, but costs for repairing
earthquake-damaged buildings
escalated beyond original esti
mates. The original plan was
changed in January 1991, when
the University announced that
Synergy and the Delt and Phi Psi
houses would be demolished and
replaced by faculty housing.
Baer said profits gained from
this venture were supposed to be
used to build student housing
elsewhere on campus.
However, this announcement
was greeted with anger and sur
prise by former residents and
others associated with the hous
es. The Committee to Save the
Hill Houses (now the Committee
for the Preservation of Historic
Stanford) was established to help
preserve the houses.
The committee contends the
buildings have too much archi
tectural and historical value to be
destroyed. The Synergy house
was built in 1911 by John
Bakewell and Arthur Brown,
architects of San Francisco's City
Hall. They also served as the
University architects from 1911
to 1941.

Birge Clark built the Delt
house in 1907. He and his son,
Arthur Clark, also designed the
Lou Henry Hoover House.
Baer and John Hackmann,
the committee's lawyer, agreed
that the Hill should remain a
place for student residences.
"Jane Stanford gave the land to
students, and it should remain in
student hands," said Eric Rose, a
former Synergy resident.
Currently, the fate of only one
house, Synergy, remains serious
ly in question. The Delt house
has burned, and the University
recently decided to repair the Phi
Psi house. Hackmann, however,
said he believes the University
has a "moral obligation" to
rebuild the house for the Delts.
"It is immoral and unethical
for Stanford to take these houses
away from students," Hackmann
said.
Rob Robbins, a Delt resident
assistant who lived in the house
several years ago, said he was
upset to discover the house was
destroyed. "There are a lot of
memories there, of friends and
places and parties," Robbins said.
"It was special because the place
was small, everyone got to know
each other really well and there
was a certain camaraderie."
"The house stood for Delt tra
dition," Delt member Roger Bur
nett said. Many of Stanford's
finest athletes lived in the house.
The Delts are now housed at
353 Campus Drive, a University
owned house that was formerly a
general student residence.
Synergy has its own rich tradi
tions. The house was originally
built to be home to the Sigma Nu
fraternity. Breaking away from
the national organization in the
early 1960s because of discrimi
natory racial policies, the mem
bers formed Beta Chi, a coed
organization that lists Sigourney
Weaver among its alumni.
The Synergy cooperative was
formed in the 1970s and contin
ues to thrive today — relocated to
Durand. Its members have been
active in organizing and partici
pating in political and ecological
movements on campus.
