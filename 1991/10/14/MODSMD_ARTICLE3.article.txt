# Greeks seek more judicial influence
## 
### Sandi Yeh 
The Interfraternity and Intersorori
ty Councils plan to propose a new struc
ture and format for their Judicial Board
by the end of the month. The proposed
structure would give students in the
Greek system more influence in the
University's handling of conflicts
involving members of fraternities or
sororities.
Disciplinary cases within the Greek
system are currently handled by the
Office of Student Activities and Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
The Judicial Board currently con
sists only of IFC members and, accord

ing to IFC Vice President Chris Flana
gan, "has no real power — only an advi
sory" function.
The ISC does not have a Judici&l
Board and thus had to file reports
directly with OSA.
A planning committee, which includes
members of the IFC and ISC, discussed
final changes in the Judicial Board pro
posal at a meeting Thursday evening
with Nanci Howe, the assistant director
of Tresidder Union.
Many fraternity and sorority mem
bers said the University's handling of
previous cases required cumbersome,
lengthy proceedings that sometimes took
up to several months, during which time

the accused fraternities or sororities
were suspended from social activities.
Some members said they believed the
decisions were sometimes unfair since
they had no voice in them.
The proposed Judicial Board would
consist of 11 representatives from the
IFC, ISC and OSA. The Board would
handle any problems, conflicts or viola
tions for which fraternities or sororities
might be held collectively responsible,
such as poor party planning, sexual
harassment, hazing or illegal alcohol
use.
Complaints or concerns would first be
reported to a six-member execu
tive committee, which would des
ignate a date to hear the parties
involved and, if necessary, super
vise investigations into the case.
At the hearing, the parties
would explain their case before
the executive committee and try
to resolve their conflict through
discussion. If the verdict required
disciplinary action, the guilty
party would formulate its own
punishment.
The executive committee
would then submit the decision to
Jackson for final approval. If the
matter could not be resolved by
the hearing, then the case would
be presented before the Judicial
Council, which submits its deci
sion to Jackson as well.

Jackson would have final say
on all Judicial Board decisions. If
he disapproved of a ruling, the
case would return to the commit
tee from which it came for further
discussion and possible revision
for approval by Jackson.
"It's healthy to discuss these
issues," Jackson said, adding that
the proposal was "thoughtful."
Under the proposed plan, the
structure of the Judicial Board
would ensure the crucial commu
nication among involved parties,
planning members said. They said
they believe that by allowing
everyone involved to participate,
the ruling process will become
faster, more efficient and more
consistent.
Instead of merely punishing
the convicted parties, OSA —
working in conjunction with the
IFC and ISC - will "help our
organizations improve and avoid
future problems," said ISC Trea

surer Shanie Geddes.
The executive committee of the
Judicial Board would be com
prised of the board's student chair
and communications representa
tive, one representative from the
IFC, one representative from the
ISC, one non-Greek student cho
sen by the ASSU Nominations
Commission and one representa
tive of OSA.
The OSA representative will
probably be Howe, who has
advised the students throughout
the planning process, committee
members said.
In addition to the members of
the executive committee, the pro
posed Judicial Board will include
a representative from the Alum
ni Interfraternity Council, a rep
resentative from the Alumni
Panhellenic Council, a member
of the faculty and one additional
member each from the IFC and
ISC.
