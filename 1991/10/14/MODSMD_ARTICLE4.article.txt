# ASSU's 'Friday Classics' starts slowly
## 
### Mas Harntha 
With last week's showing of the movie
"Raiders of the Lost Ark," the ASSU
kicked off "Friday Classics," a new busi
ness project that members of the associa
tion hope will become a regular feature
like the long-running Sunday Flicks.
Currently, Friday Classics are held in
Cubberley Auditorium, which seats
around 300 to 400 people, while Sunday
Flicks are shown in Memorial Auditori
um, which can hold approximately 1,600.
ASSU Financial Manager Mike Risch
said he did not expect Friday Classics to

be as popular as Sunday Flicks. Howev
er, last week's movie did draw more than
310 people, Sunday Flicks manager
Jonathan Hoekstra said.
Season ticket sales are sluggish, but
sales overall were "better than expect
ed," Friday Classics manager Jason
Moore said, noting that the large majori
ty of tickets were sold at the door.
Hoekstra said he thinks Friday Classics
"will not be as big as Sunday Flicks. But
that's because first-run films always draw
a bigger audience, and people already have
opinions about the older films."
Risch agreed that Friday Classics and

Sunday Flicks would be different. "We
want Friday Classics to develop its own
aura. Sundays are the paper fights and
everything. . . . We hope Fridays will be
mellower, as it is in the education build
ing, and we don't want people tearing up
the theater or anything."
The ASSU hopes to run Friday Clas
sics for the rest of this year and may turn
it into a regular event if the ticket sales
are good and the auditorium is full,
Hoekstra said.
"Friday Flicks is a new project. It's a big
question mark right now, but we believe
that there's a big market out there for it."
