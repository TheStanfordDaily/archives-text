# Despite problems, ASSU starts fee-refund program
## 
### Connie Lo 
The new ASSU computerized fee
refund system is now in full operation
one week behind schedule, despite early
problems of program bugs and a lack of
publicity.
The ASSU Senate voted Tuesday
night to extend the deadline by which
students can request fee refunds to Oct.
18 because of the delay and because stu
dents are not aware of the change.
"We need to publicize to freshmen
and to the whole campus (news) of the
change," said undergraduate senator
Silvia Ferroni.
Fewer students have requested
refunds than might have otherwise
because people are unaware of the new
system, according to Mike Risch, ASSU
financial manager.
To solve that problem, the ASSU
plans to continue to run ads in The
Daily and distribute flyers in the dorms.
The new computer system, imple
mented for greater efficiency, replaces
the old fill-in-the-bubble paper system.
"It's very easy to use," said Risch,
who wrote the program. "It's much less
annoying than the paperwork."
"Once people become aware, they will
like it better," said undergraduate sena

tor Steve Apfelberg. "It should facilitate
the whole process and make it easier and
faster."
Students can use computers in
Tresidder Union and Meyer Library
clusters to get fee refunds. Detailed
written instructions are available in the
Tresidder AlRport.
Fee refunds are designed so that stu
dents who do not support certain stu
dent organizations can get their money
back from the dues they paid earlier
with tuition bills.
"Everyone should have the right to
get a refund for the items they don't
want to support," Apfelberg said.
Students eligible for fee refunds are
those who voted in the last election and
those who were not registered to vote at
that time â€” a group that includes fresh
men, transfers and first-year graduate
students.
There have been problems in the past
with students who get fee refunds but
continue to use the ASSU services for
which they requested refunds, but Risch
said this does not worry him.
"We trust them, for one," he said.
The names of the students getting
refunds will also be made available to
student groups who can choose to dis
continue service to those students.
