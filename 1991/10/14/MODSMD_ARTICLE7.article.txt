# Three presidents plead for increased federal aid

The leaders of three major
research universities, including
Stanford University President Don
ald Kennedy, pleaded their case Fri
day for increased federal support of
higher education during a time of
heightened scrutiny of research
spending across the nation.
Their appeal, made at a discussion
of higher education that was part of
Cornell's 125 th anniversary celebra
tion, was broadcast on more than 200
radio stations across the country.
Kennedy joined UC-Berkeley
Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien and
Cornell President Frank Rhodes to
discuss "The American University
and the National Interest" before a
luncheon meeting of the Common
wealth Club in San Francisco.
As the demands for and costs of
research escalate, universities are
experiencing the financial constraints

of declining support for research by
an "increasingly reluctant govern
ment," according to Kennedy. "It is
very hard to depend on the govern
ment for 90 percent of the research
support that you get," he said.
The support of the government
has waned, according to Rhodes,
and he suggested redirecting the 65
percent of total federal funds now
devoted to defense.
"We welcome President Bush's
proposal to reduce long-term nucle
ar development. But if that is to
benefit the nation as a whole, then
the huge proportion of funding that
goes into military [research and
development] must be directed
toward humane ends," said Rhodes,
to a huge upswell of applause.
At the end of his speech, Kennedy
criticized the low priority higher
education has received in the United
States compared to other countries.
"Research universities are one of

the great world successes the world
has today.... Why don't Americans
know that? We need to find an
answer. We need to make our case
more persuasive," he said.
Another theme of the presenta
tions was the rapidly changing
demographics of U.S. universities
and society. Tien criticized the
media's coverage of the issue, claim
ing they focus on the hostilities and
isolation between races on campus.
"If anything," he said, "the real
news is the many wonderful suc
cesses of the new diversity."
"We have the opportunity ... to
create models for the society all of
America must become in the next
century," said Kennedy.
Kennedy also repeated his appeal
for a "really determined effort to
strengthen the importance and qual
ity of undergraduate teaching
We need to put this value higher on
the scale."
