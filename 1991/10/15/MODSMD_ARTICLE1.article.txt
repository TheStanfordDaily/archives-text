# When private becomes public, role of Res Ed blurs
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
At some universities, resident assis
tants are little more than glorified hall
monitors. Stanford's Office of Residen
tial Education, however, prides itself on
training residence staff to act as coun
selors, educators and friends.
But since Residence Dean Angela Rick
ford and RA Chris Arriola found their
comments in a police report and subse
quently in local newspapers, some within
Res Ed have been forced to re-evaluate
the relationships among students, resi
dence staff and the police.

Rickford and Arriola spoke to police
last month in connection with the alleged
Sept. 22 sexual assault involving two stu
dents. Their statements were included in
a 44-page report — made public after the
arrest of junior Stuart Thomas Oct. 1 —
detailing the week-long police investiga
tion of the incident.
Thomas is out on bail awaiting a Santa
Clara County Court review of the case,
scheduled for Monday. He is charged with
one count of unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor, a felony, and one count of
furnishing alcohol to a minor.
The reactions of students and admin
istrators to the report highlight the

unusual nature of the recent case. It is
rare that a Stanford student is charged
with committing a felony against a fel
low student, and even rarer that the
alleged crime takes place in the context
of a dorm community.
The contents of the report have raised
several controversial issues, including
the changing roles of Stanford RAs and
the relative values of publicity and confi
dentiality. The case has also broken
through Stanford's usual insulation
from outside institutions like the police.
Aside from the woman's testimony,
some of the most potentially incriminat
ing statements in the report come from

Rickford and Casa Zapata RA Arriola.
Some students — apparently assum
ing Arriola's and Rickford's comments
were made to The Daily, rather than to
the police, as actually occurred — said
they worried conversations with resi
dence staff were not as confidential as
they had been led to believe.
Some upperclass students said, "If
this is the way it works, why would I
ever go to the support staff with con
cerns of that magnitude?" according to
Kris Carpenter, RA at Arroyo. "Their
understanding was that when you went
to your residence dean or RA, that infor
mation would not end up on the front of

the news. It would be kept within the
community."
Stanford RAs have the unique oppor
tunity to serve as in-house support staff,
and Arriola seems to have acted as a
model counselor and educator in his
conversation with Thomas, as docu
mented in the police report.
Noticing that Thomas had a beer in
hand and a well-stocked refrigerator,
Arriola talked to him about Stanford's
alcohol policy, responded to Thomas'
alleged comments about getting first
year undergraduate women drunk, and
discussed the difference between
rape and consensual sex, accord
ing to the report.
But, Arriola told police,
Thomas did not seem to be listen
ing, so Arriola soon left the room.
Arriola declined to be interviewed
for this article, saying he did "not
want to jeopardize anything."
Although the conversation
was clearly not viewed as confi
dential by either participant,
Arriola's statement to the police
has led other RAs to question
their roles.
An RA's responsibility to
report an incident — whether an
honor code infraction or a crime
— is no less or more than the
average student-citizen's, accord
ing to Ann Porteus, associate
director of Res Ed.
But the RA role has recently
shifted, if subtly. The new,
stricter alcohol policy implement
ed last spring brought the respon
sibilities of RAs into question, as
Res Ed fought to keep its staff out
of the enforcement role.
"The new alcohol policy raised
the issue of enforcement," said Por
teus. "But any words of enforce
ment have been removed from our
literature."
Nevertheless, "the pressures
on RAs have increased over the
years," Porteus said. "There is
much more training on counsel
ing matters."
As RAs counsel more and more
students on such sensitive issues
as alcohol and sexual assault,
however, some of those students
are likely to confide behaviors
that violate University policies or

even the law. As a result, some
RAs feel their roles have become
blurred.
"I'm a very strong supporter of
confidentiality," Carpenter said.
"But it is not clear in the job role
what my responsibilities are" to
report infractions.
The subject of confidentiality
will be one topic of discussion at a
training in-service for RAs tomor
row night, according to Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
"It's to reassure folks," Jack
son said. "This is the first time in
my 12 years at Stanford that the
comments of a residence dean or
RA after talking to the police have
appeared in a newspaper."
Confidentiality is an ongoing
concern for residence staff mem
bers. RAs are encouraged to
establish a safe, trusting environ
ment in which students can air
their concerns, but to stop short
of promising absolute confiden
tiality, according to Diana Con
klin, director of the Row, who
leads a workshop on the issue
during RA training.
"The RA must not allow her
self or himself to get in a situation
where they are sworn to secrecy,"
Conklin said.
The classic example of a situa
tion where "you obviously cannot
maintain confidentiality," she
said, is that of a student about to
commit suicide.
Like RAs, residence deans try
to respect students' privacy, shar
ing information only with other
administrators or within the resi
dence staff.
"Any time a student walks into
my office, it's understood that
they are coming to tell the RD,
not announcing it to the dorm or
to the world," Rickford said in an
interview with The Daily.

"But when things go out of our
hands and into the hands of the
law, there is only so much control
we have over the procedure," she
continued. "There are established
rules and procedures that one has
to abide by."
Rickford said that in the weeks
following the alleged assault,
administrators spoke to each
other about the incident on a reg
ular basis. She also recalled
speaking to police "on a couple of
occasions" after giving them a let
ter that Thomas had asked her to
deliver to the woman he allegedly
assaulted.
But, she said, she did not real
ize her conversations with police
would be included in a report that
would then become part of the
public record. "At no point did
anyone say, 'You are about to
make a statement,' " Rickford
said.
Rickford's experience reveals
the confusion that results when
administrators, accustomed to
procedures within the University
that guarantee student confiden
tiality, suddenly find themselves
involved with outside agencies
such as the police — where the
public has a right to know many
more details of a case.
Although Rickford had not
realized she was making an offi
cial statement to the police, she
said, "It's all the same to me,
because what I said is true."
She said neither her state
ment nor the publicity sur
rounding it have hurt her rela
tionship with students. "I have
an excellent relationship with
the students and the resident
fellows," she said. "They know
that I do my best for them, and
that is really what is needed in
this job."
