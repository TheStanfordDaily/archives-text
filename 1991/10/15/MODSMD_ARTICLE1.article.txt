# When private becomes public, role of Res Ed blurs
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
At some universities, resident assis
tants are little more than glorified hall
monitors. Stanford's Office of Residen
tial Education, however, prides itself on
training residence staff to act as coun
selors, educators and friends.
But since Residence Dean Angela Rick
ford and RA Chris Arriola found their
comments in a police report and subse
quently in local newspapers, some within
Res Ed have been forced to re-evaluate
the relationships among students, resi
dence staff and the police.

Rickford and Arriola spoke to police
last month in connection with the alleged
Sept. 22 sexual assault involving two stu
dents. Their statements were included in
a 44-page report — made public after the
arrest of junior Stuart Thomas Oct. 1 —
detailing the week-long police investiga
tion of the incident.
Thomas is out on bail awaiting a Santa
Clara County Court review of the case,
scheduled for Monday. He is charged with
one count of unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor, a felony, and one count of
furnishing alcohol to a minor.
The reactions of students and admin
istrators to the report highlight the

unusual nature of the recent case. It is
rare that a Stanford student is charged
with committing a felony against a fel
low student, and even rarer that the
alleged crime takes place in the context
of a dorm community.
The contents of the report have raised
several controversial issues, including
the changing roles of Stanford RAs and
the relative values of publicity and confi
dentiality. The case has also broken
through Stanford's usual insulation
from outside institutions like the police.
Aside from the woman's testimony,
some of the most potentially incriminat
ing statements in the report come from

Rickford and Casa Zapata RA Arriola.
Some students — apparently assum
ing Arriola's and Rickford's comments
were made to The Daily, rather than to
the police, as actually occurred — said
they worried conversations with resi
dence staff were not as confidential as
they had been led to believe.
Some upperclass students said, "If
this is the way it works, why would I
ever go to the support staff with con
cerns of that magnitude?" according to
Kris Carpenter, RA at Arroyo. "Their
understanding was that when you went
to your residence dean or RA, that infor
mation would not end up on the front of

the news. It would be kept within the
community."
Stanford RAs have the unique oppor
tunity to serve as in-house support staff,
and Arriola seems to have acted as a
model counselor and educator in his
conversation with Thomas, as docu
mented in the police report.
Noticing that Thomas had a beer in
hand and a well-stocked refrigerator,
Arriola talked to him about Stanford's
alcohol policy, responded to Thomas'
alleged comments about getting first
year undergraduate women drunk, and
