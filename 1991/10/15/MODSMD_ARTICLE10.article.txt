## Key Southern Democrat pledges support 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supporters of
Clarence Thomas worked yesterday to pre
serve Senate support for his Supreme Court
nomination as senators "pained and per
plexed" by sexual harassment allegations
decided how to vote.
A key Southern Democrat, Sen. J. Ben
nett Johnston of Louisiana, reaffirmed his
support for Thomas, saying the allegations
by University of Oklahoma law professor
Anita Hill had not changed his mind about
the nomination.
"I believe Judge Thomas is qualified. I
said so two weeks ago. I know nothing that
has transpired in the meantime to take away
from that," said Johnston, who led a group of
Southern Democrats to oppose Robert
Bork's failed Supreme Court nomination in
1987.
But others were wrestling with the issue
as another former aide to Thomas, Sukari
Hardnett, told the Associated Press that
black women in his office at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission felt
they were objects of his sexual interest and
physical inspection.
"I am generally undecided," said Sen. J.
James Exon, D-Neb., who had been a
Thomas supporter before Hill's allegations
surfaced.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said yes
terday that the three days of testimony left
him undecided going into Tuesday's vote.
"I was so disturbed over the events this
weekend that I'm literally, entirely in the

undecided category," Dodd, who had previ
ously been leaning toward Thomas, said at a
news conference in Hartford, Conn.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who
had originally been a Thomas supporter, said
the hearings left him undecided.
"I'm as pained and perplexed as the rest of
America," Lieberman said on NBC. "It's
quite possible... that we're not able to decide
that anybody is lying," he said.
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., another
Thomas supporter, predicted the Senate
would approve the nomination in a vote that
both sides expected to be close.
The vote is scheduled for 3 p.m. today
after eight hours of time for debate.
"This is a cliflhanger if there ever was
one," said Nan Aron, executive director of the
anti-Thomas Alliance For Justice.
"I believe Clarence Thomas. The Ameri
can people believe Clarence Thomas. I have
no idea where the votes are," said Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., the nominee's mentor and
champion on Capitol Hill.
President Bush, who returned early from
a three-day weekend at Camp David to direct
the lobbying effort, said support for Thomas
was still "holding strong" despite the explo
sive allegations of Hill.
"I am very pleased with the way support
all across the country is holding strong for
Judge Thomas," Bush said, referring to a
flurry of last-minute public opinion polls
showing Americans believed Thomas' firm,
flat denial by roughly a 2-1 margin.
