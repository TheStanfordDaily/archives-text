# Prospects for peace conference improve

### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — In a
move signaling a Mideast peace
conference may be near, top PLO
officials discussed with Jordan
yesterday proposals for forming a
joint delegation in a bid to resolve
major sticking points over Pales
tinian representation at the talks.
Secretary of State James Baker
said after a related meeting with
King Hussein that "We will know
within a reasonably short time if
we will have an active peace pro
cess for this region."
Hussein agreed, saying "I
believe everything will become
clear in a short space of time,"

and "We hope to have results
soon" from the dialogue with
Palestinian leaders.
Meanwhile, the offstage role of
Yassar Arafat's Palestine Libera
tion Organization came into
sharper focus as three of its exec
utive committee members con
ferred with Jordanian counter
parts on such unsettled issues as
the chairmanship and size of the
proposed joint delegation.
Baker sought to assure Israel
that the United States was not
trying to set up a dialogue
between Israel and the PLO. At
the same time, the fact that top

PLO officials had come to
Amman to consult with Jordan,
he said, "is not a surprising phe
nomenon."
Baker is pushing for a late-
October target, as set by both the
United States and the Soviet
Union, for convening the peace
conference.
Baker hinted earlier in Cairo
that even if the Palestinian
issues are not settled soon, the
two governments would issue
invitations anyhow. He cau
tioned Palestinian interests that
"the bus is not going to come by
again."

Earlier, after more than four
hours of talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarek, Baker
said, similarly, "At some point . .
. we will have to issue invita
tions." Other U.S. officials said
the invitations would go out by
next Monday.
In order to avoid the appear
ance of a direct PLO link to the
peace conference — which would
infuriate Israel and probably
derail the effort — Baker has
been meeting in Jerusalem with
a group of Palestinians who
maintain some distance, in pub
lic, from the PLO.
