OSLO, Norway (AP) -
Burmese opposition leader
Aung San Suu Kyi, who has
been under house arrest for
two years for her struggle to
achieve democracy in her
homeland, was awarded the
1991 Nobel Peace Prize yester
day.
The Nobel Committee
acknowledged that Suu Kyi
may not know of her $1 mil
lion award. Burma's military
junta bars her from receiving
visitors or communicating
with outsiders.
"It is clear that there will be
difficulty" in getting the news
through, said Norwegian
Nobel Committee Chairman
Francis Sejersted.
Suu Kyi, 46, the daughter of
Burmese independence hero
Aung San, won for insisting on
non-violent means to bring
democracy to her impoverished
South East Asian homeland of
40 million people.
Her party, the National
League for Democracy, over
whelmingly won parliamen
tary elections in May 1990, but
Burma's generals have refused
to end their repressive rule and
let the opposition party take
power.
"Suu Kyi's struggle is one of
the most extraordinary exam
ples of civil courage in Asia in
recent decades," said the one
page citation by the Nobel
Committee.
"She has become an impor
tant symbol in the struggle
against oppression," it said.
"She became the leader of a
democratic opposition which
employs non-violent means to
resist a regime characterized
by brutality."
U.N. Secretary-General

Javier Perez de Cuellar said
he hoped "this international
recognition will. . . lead to her
earliest release from house
arrest and enable her family
to visit her without hin
drance."
But Nyunt Swe, the mili
tary government's ambas
sador to Thailand, indicated
such hopes were futile. "I
don't think it will have any
impact on Burma" or lead to
Suu Kyi's release, he said.
Suu Kyi (pronounced Ahn
Sahn Soo Chee) has not seen
her sons, Alexander, 18, and
Kim, 14, since September
1989, when their passports
were revoked.
Her British husband,
Michael Aris, is currently a vis
iting professor at Harvard Uni
versity in Cambridge, Mass. He
has not seen his wife of nearly
20 years since Christmas 1989.
He said yesterday that corre
spondence was cut off without
explanation in July.
