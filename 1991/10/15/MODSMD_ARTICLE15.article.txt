Student requirements
limit usefulness of
committee representation

WHEN THE BOARD OF
trustees announced last
week that it wanted one
student on its 17-member Presi
dential Selection Committee, the
ASSU reacted in typical fashion.
Denouncing the trustees' pro
nouncement as tokenism, the
ASSU immediately called for more
student involvement in the com
mittee and a greater role for the
ASSU in the selection process.
Unfortunately, those recommen
dations are like many of the
ASSU's actions: While made in the
right spirit, they miss the real issue.
The issue is not how many students
will be on the committee — after
all, can two students represent the
student body any better than one
can? The issue is qualifications:
What kind of a student do we want
on the committee?
The ASSU and the trustees have
both analyzed that question
improperly. The trustees, for their
part, severely limited the pool of
qualified applicants by requiring
that the student committee mem
ber be a graduate student with a
Stanford undergraduate degree.
Surely, many undergraduates —
and many graduate students who
attended different colleges as
undergraduates — have enough
knowledge and interest in the Stan
ford community to make intelligent
decisions about whom our next
president should be.
The ASSU has not fared much
better on the issue of qualifica
tions. Directed by the trustees to
nominate three students for the
one position on the selection com
mittee, the ASSU barely publicized
its search for students. There was
only scant advertisement for the
job.
As it turned out, two of the three
people nominated have ties to the

ASSU — John Overdeck is a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents,
while Derek Miyahara is a graduate
senator. The third nominee, Kasi
Fuller, has worked at Stanford as a
resident fellow.
Clearly, the ASSU's search pro
cess was skewed toward its own
members: They knew about it, so
they applied. The student who
serves on the committee will hard
ly be the result of a wide-ranging
search for qualified students.
Rather than jabber about having
more students on the selection com
mittee, the ASSU should have been
concerned about the quality of the
student on the committee.
The trustees' offer of one stu
dent was generous — many col
leges, such as MIT and Harvard,
did not allow any student participa
tion in their presidential selection
processes.
And the inclusion of one student
is hardly questionable in light of
the fact that the committee also
includes only one University staff
member.
While students are here only
four years, staff members have a
long-term, direct interest in the
presidential search. Many staff
members work closely with the
president, some even more so than
faculty or trustees. To include only
one staff member — along with
seven trustees, seven faculty mem
bers and one alumnus — is a much
more questionable decision than to
include one student.
But the ASSU, with typical tun
nel vision, did not examine the
whole issue. That body's simplistic
approach to the selection process
obscured the issues that should
have been at the forefront.
Although the trustees wrongly
limited the criteria that the student
must fit, the ASSU could have con
ducted a comprehensive search to
find the best student possible.
They didn't do that. Now, instead
of having a choice among people
who exhibit a breadth of involve
ment in the University, we have a
choice among people mostly
involved in the ASSU.
