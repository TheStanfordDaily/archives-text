# Staff Notebook
## Minal Hajratwala and Connie Chang Coordinators for diversity seek to broaden perspective 
### 
AS WRITERS AT THE DAILY, we
have felt pride in our work as jour
nalists and in contributing in some
small way to the Stanford community. At
the same time, however, we have felt
frustrated with the lack of coverage of
some segments of the campus and isolat
ed as writers of color.
In our new roles as coordinators for
diversity, we want to help others to expe
rience the rewards of working at The
Daily while minimizing the frustrations
and feelings of isolation.
Our most immediate goal is to work

with new Daily staffers of diverse back
grounds as well as with current staff mem
bers to increase and improve coverage of
traditionally marginalized communities â€”
students of color, disabled students and
lesbian, gay and bisexual students.
Familiarizing writers with the issues
is important because writers are the vital
link between the communities where
events happen and The Daily's offices,
where editors determine what events
merit coverage.
Past editors have assigned stories
mainly during periods of negative visibil

ity or in reaction to large-scale efforts by
the groups themselves. Such coverage
can be avoided by establishing beats, in
which writers are in constant communi
cation with the communities.
The creation of our position itself
shows that the editorial staff of Volume
200 is more responsive to the needs of
non-traditional communities, following
the progression of multiculturalism of
the last decade within the University and
across the nation.
We hope our efforts to expand cover
age during this volume will set a prece

dent for future editorial staffs because
editors are the essential component in
maintaining comprehensive and regular
coverage of diverse communities.
We will be approaching various student
groups in the coming weeks with our ideas.
Meanwhile, we encourage students to work
with us to strengthen the ties between con
cerned communities and The Daily. Please
call us with suggestions and comments
throughout the quarter at 723-4632.

Minal Hajratwala and Connie Chang are
The Daily's coordinators for diversity.
