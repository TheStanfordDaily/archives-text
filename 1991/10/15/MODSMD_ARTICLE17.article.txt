Family unit should be broken up to solve sex issues

I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE
reports and letters related to the
alleged rape of a first-year student and
the gay-rights protest against Gov. Pete
Wilson, and I am struck by the knee-jerk
nature of most responses.
Underlying, and central to, both inci
dents is an issue which no one has even
touched on: the role of the family in soci
ety. The family — the small scale econom
ic unit in which people reproduce — is
where we learn what social roles and sexu
al behaviors are acceptable and unaccept
able for males and females.
We learn men have to dominate, with
women and children their pets or slaves.
We learn that sex is "dirty" and "sinful"
and that children, especially girls, must be
forbidden from exploring their sexuality.
We learn homosexuality is "abnormal"
and that happiness in an intimate relation
ship can only be achieved by forming a
heterosexual monogamous couple.
That the family — which so effectively
stunts and distorts human development —
is falling apart does not take away the real

ity of its backwardness and the impact it
has in people's lives. And yet, is anyone
looking at this issue in relation to the inci
dents in question?
Letters have been written saying how
sorry some people feel for the woman who
was allegedly raped and also, to some
extent, for the man accused of raping her.
Forcing someone to have sex against
her or his will might be a terrible crime,
but I wonder: How clearly can rape be
defined in this society of ours, in which
women are taught to internalize the
notion that they must be dominated by
men and in which as children we are not
allowed to explore our sexuality and to dis
cover through trial and error healthier
ways of experiencing intimacy?
A "politically correct" man told me the
other day, "They should nail the bastard."
What hypocrisy! I ask: Is anyone targeting
the institutions and power structure
which are at the root of the kinds of "sexu
al crimes" people — in a pathetic attempt
to achieve their own moral salvation and
to cleanse themselves of their responsibili

ty for these crimes — are so willing to nail
those who happen to get caught for?
As for the comments regarding the gay
rights protest — whether in favor of it or
against it — they, too, miss the target. Gays
and lesbians will not be free, even if their
civil rights are guaranteed, as long as het
erosexuality continues to be promoted as
the only model for intimate relationships.
And that will not cease to be the case until
what is left of the family is dismantled.
People are reluctant to see the family go
because no alternatives are being created on
a mass scale to replace it. Yet the solution is
not to go backwards. What needs to be done
is to move forwards by industrializing the
family.
An example of what that would mean
concretely is precisely what residential edu
cation is all about at Stanford: large dormi
tories and dining halls, with plenty of educa
tional, health, recreational and nurturing
facilities and activities for everyone.
Large-scale living arrangements are the
kinds of arrangements that make it possi
ble to overcome the prejudices and narrow

visions with which all of us are, have been
and continue to be poisoned in our individ
ual, isolated homes.
And if resources were directed into
developing them on a world scale, they
could be perfected to the point that people
could experience the same closeness and
love that they receive.
Needless to say, industrializing the
family would also lay the basis for freeing
all women from the burden of domestic
work. (At the very least it would ensure
that women got paid for it.)
And it would make it possible for indi
viduals to explore their sexuality to collec
tively create alternatives to the dominant/
submissive construct which rules our inti
mate lives.
In short, industrializing the family
would be a progressive historical step that
would make it easier to solve social prob
lems such as rape and the oppression of
gays and lesbians.
