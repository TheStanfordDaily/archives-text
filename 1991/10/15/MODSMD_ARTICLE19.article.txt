## Who is to say? 
### 
HELP! I'M SO CONFUSED. With all
the "legitimate" racist, homophobic
and otherwise derogatory com
ments being bandied about these days,
who's to say what's appropriate speech?
In the far corner, we've got a black fra
ternity's flier depicting a "multi-ethnic"
person beheaded at the hands of a black
man. Close by we have Queerland's promi
nent fliers, which sport catchy little homo
phobic phrases like "faggots" and "faeries,"
not to mention "pansies" and "dykes."
And let us not forget the many Jews that
tell anti-Semitic jokes. Nor shall we leave
out the black people who refer to each other
as "nigger" both on and off the movie
screen and along the radio waves.
I don't see the distinction between what's
permissible and what's not, based simply on
who says it. Just because I'm Jewish, and 6
million of "my people" were slaughtered —
along with plenty of non-Jewish people —
am I entitled to make anti-Semitic remarks
that would offend other Jews?
Just because someone is openly gay, can
they call others "faggots" and "queers"? Or
just because others are black and their fore
fathers — and foremothers, don't forget —
were slaves, does that make it OK for them
to address others of their race as "nigger"?
I doubt any of our predecessors who
were persecuted for their religion, sexual
orientation or the color of their skin would
feel particularly vindicated or redeemed by
such behavior. It seems ironic that we get

offended when someone outside of our
group uses derogatory or stereotyping lan
guage, but not when someone inside our
group does.
One common argument I've heard
against such speech is that it perpetuates
false stereotypes and ill feelings simply by
its repetition — a notion that simply hear
ing something enough times makes you
believe it.
Although I don't think it gives the lis
tener much credit, there is likely some
truth to this assertion. However, it doesn't
seem to require that the speaker is dis
cussing a different group than his or her
own.
For example, if a non-Jew witnesses two
Jewish people joking about how cheap they
are, or referring to other derogatory stereo
types of themselves, the process of repeti
tion is occurring, even though the speakers
are caricaturing themselves.
In fact, it might be worse than if it were
non-Jews saying the same things, because
the outside listener likely sees some legiti
macy in using those stereotypes in the
future.
Faced with an offended Jewish person
later on, he might say something along the
lines of: "Lighten up. If your own people
can joke about it, why can't you?" The
speech has affected the way this person
thinks, regardless of who spoke.
So why are certain words deemed
"offensive speech" when they come out of

one person's mouth but not when they
come out of another's?
Perhaps it's more demeaning to be
addressed derogatorily by someone who is
not within the persecuted group. However,
I'd imagine that many people are offended
by such words coming from anyone's
mouth, whether the speaker is or is not a
member of the group.
So where do we draw the line? Are there
certain things that shouldn't be said, cer
tain people that shouldn't talk or some
combination thereof?
I cringe when I hear derogatory and
stereotyped speech — especially from peo
ple I know. And yet, there's a feeling that in
certain instances — when someone is refer
ring to his or her own group — I shouldn't
cringe.
So, I question those of you who use "con
troversial" speech and yet expect other peo
ple not to.
How often do you take a look at the cri
teria by which you make your judgments?
Are you sure there aren't any double stan
dards or hypocrisies lurking there that you
haven't caught?
