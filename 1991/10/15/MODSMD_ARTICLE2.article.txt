Prof. Clayborne Carson ignited
a firestorm of criticism and con
troversy by revealing evidence
of plagiarism in the 1955 gradu
ate work of Martin Luther King
Jr.
Now a committee of scholars
at Boston University, where King
studied, has confirmed Carson's
findings, though they said they
will not revoke King's doctoral
degree.
"There is no question but that
Dr. King plagiarized in the disser
tation by appropriating material
from sources not explicitly credit
ed in notes or mistakenly credited,
or credited generally and at some
distance in the text from a close
paraphrase or verbatim quota
tion," the panel said at a press con
ference last week.
Boston University Provost Jon
Westling spearheaded the com
mittee, comprised of Boston Uni
versity staff and faculty, shortly
after Carson first made public the
findings last November.
Carson, the editor of the Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject at Stanford, could not be
reached for comment. He told the
Los Angeles Times Friday, "I
don't know if it's a matter of vin
dication. We weren't interpreting
evidence, we were simply report
ing evidence."
Questions about the authen
ticity of King's work had first
surfaced in 1987 when a graduate
assistant found insufficient cita
tion in King's papers.
At the time of the disclosure
last year, Carson told The Daily
his staff found a "disturbing pat
tern of textual appropriation," in
the late leader's work.
Further investigation by the
staff revealed similar cases of lift
ed texts, the most disturbing of
which was unattributed informa
tion in the late minister's doctor
al dissertation.
The 343-page work, "A Com
parison of the Conceptions of
God in the Thinking of Paul
Tillich and Henry Nelson Wei
man," contained words, struc
ture and section titles similar to
another dissertation written by
another doctoral candidate three
years prior to King's arrival, Car
son found.
At the time of the disclosure
Carson said, "it was a case of slop
piness and carelessness," and
added that King "created a seam
less text where readers have diffi
culty discerning his ideas from
others in the paper."
"The findings do not take
away from who King was or is.
King was not great for his schol
arship — he was great because of
his role in the civil rights move
ment," said Thompkins, who is
black.
