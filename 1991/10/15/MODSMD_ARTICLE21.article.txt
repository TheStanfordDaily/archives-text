USSA is an important
asset for financial aid
and political lobbying
We applaud the ASSU Senate's recent
decision to retain membership in the Unit
ed States Student Association. We are the
directors of the new ASSU Financial Aid
Office.
We seek to empower Stanford students
to have more grants for their education
and fewer loans, more sympathy from the
University Office of Financial Aids and
fewer lines, and more clout on Capitol Hill.
We see our involvement with the associ
ation as critical to our being able to per
form our duties effectively.
With Stanford graduates in key posi
tions of the most respected and sought
after voice for student financial aid in
Washington, D.C., we feel confident that
we are not forgotten.
Our influence in the association's lob
bying efforts is evidenced by the well-pub
licized testimony of Stanford student
Brian Hooker at a key Congressional Edu
cation Subcommittee hearing last spring
and by our presence at follow-up hearings
in Sacramento.
As Congress prepares to vote on the
most sweeping restructuring of the Higher
Education Act in decades, the association
consistently calls for changes in the Pell

Grant system which will directly benefit
middle-income students at Stanford.
We also work with the association to
ensure that Pell Grant awards remain posi
tively indexed to account for higher tuitions
at private universities such as ours.
The association is not the sole student
lobbying group in Washington. We at the
ASSU Financial Aid Office are exploring
other student lobby groups which can pre
sent our case in Washington. For the
moment, however, the important issue is the
reauthorization process, and the association
is an undeniably key player in this process.
Our office will be working closely with
the association in the coming weeks to
organize a student letter writing cam
paign. We will be targeting our congress
man, Tom Campbell. We need to remind
him of his obligation to support financial
aid programs that would directly benefit
Stanford students, his constituency.
We are equally committed to ensuring
student input into the current restructur
ing of Stanford's aid programs and the
Office of Financial Aids. We are also set
ting up an advocacy network of experi
enced students who can offer advice on
specific problems students may be encoun
tering with their aid packages.
We have high expectations for ourselves,
for this university and for this government.
We aim to be your voice and your resource
for financial aid. Come join us.

Reaction to Band's
halftime 'nun' show
silly, illogical, unfair
Congratulations to Prof. David Aber
nethy for excellently demonstrating the
dangers of misinformed inference in his
letter regarding the Band's performance
at the Notre Dame game.
First, based on what information does
he state that the Band's supposed "plan
ners" made a purposeful decision to
offend Catholics (or other Christians for
that matter)?
Without any evidence to support his
conclusion, he makes the illogical long
jump from one person's costume to a
cabal of Band members specifically adopt
ing an "offensive strategy" designed to
alienate a large part of its audience.
Second, he states that he "cannot
imagine [the Band J putting on a halftime
show making fun of Jews, for example, or
Moslems or Buddhists. Then why a show
knowingly geared to upset Christians?"
In other words: The whole halftime
show targeted Christians, and the Band
would never attack a "minority" religion.
Hmmm, if I remember correctly, the Notre
Dame halftime show was a tribute to Dr.
Seuss, not Pontius Pilate and Herod.
And third, Abernethy's information
that the cross was once a device used "to

torture and [to] kill people" does not fall
on deaf ears. Of course, he's probably
thinking of Roman times.
My thoughts settle on the middle ages,
when, behind the banner of the cross,
Christianity performed such "love-your
neighbor" activities as the Crusades, anti
semitic pogroms and the Inquisition.
On reflection, I agree the use of the
nun costume involved a distinct lapse in
good judgement — and the Band has
made clear it is sincerely sorry for serious
ly offending members of the community.
At the same time, I'm sure that it was
only intended as a humorous parallel to a
football team known for its "Touchdown
Jesus." Abernethy's letter and similar
responses to the costume make me mar
vel that Western society ever made it out
of the middle ages.

to keep art at Stanford
Despite the small turn-out at the Oct.
7 student town meeting, those of us
involved in Stanford's arts community
are gratified by the support evident from
the broader student population.
The Faculty Senate, at least, has

established the spurious distinction
between creative arts and scholarship as
one of its budget-cutting criteria.
The real issue is not whether fine arts
are peripheral to the mission of a presti
gious university, but rather the ways in
which the fine and performing arts are
integral to the liberal arts.
The much vaunted "Stanford experi
ence" refers to the whole fabric of our
academic culture, a culture based on
community-building and a well-rounded
liberal arts education. The arts are cru
cial to both; they are synthesizing and
creative elements in what might other
wise be an arid and analytic atmosphere.
Letters are being written. Petitions
are being circulated. Events are being
planned. Stanford's threat to amputate
the arts sends an ill wind blowing
through not only our own experience,
but also through the academic environ
ment of all those institutions that look
to Stanford as an example.
I encourage all students, faculty and
staff to pick up your campus directories
and your copies of The Daily, write to
your deans, to the president and provost,
to the budget cutters, to your professors,
to the press! The issue of the conse
quences of fiscal mismanagement is
more important by far than that of its
causes.
We're not dead yet.

Reaction to Band's
halftime 'nun' show
silly, illogical, unfair
Congratulations to Prof. David Aber
nethy for excellently demonstrating the
dangers of misinformed inference in his
letter regarding the Band's performance
at the Notre Dame game.
First, based on what information does
he state that the Band's supposed "plan
ners" made a purposeful decision to
offend Catholics (or other Christians for
that matter)?
Without any evidence to support his
conclusion, he makes the illogical long
jump from one person's costume to a
cabal of Band members specifically adopt
ing an "offensive strategy" designed to
alienate a large part of its audience.
Second, he states that he "cannot
imagine [the Band J putting on a halftime
show making fun of Jews, for example, or
Moslems or Buddhists. Then why a show
knowingly geared to upset Christians?"
In other words: The whole halftime
show targeted Christians, and the Band
would never attack a "minority" religion.
Hmmm, if I remember correctly, the Notre
Dame halftime show was a tribute to Dr.
Seuss, not Pontius Pilate and Herod.
And third, Abernethy's information
that the cross was once a device used "to

torture and [to] kill people" does not fall
on deaf ears. Of course, he's probably
thinking of Roman times.
My thoughts settle on the middle ages,
when, behind the banner of the cross,
Christianity performed such "love-your
neighbor" activities as the Crusades, anti
semitic pogroms and the Inquisition.
On reflection, I agree the use of the
nun costume involved a distinct lapse in
good judgement — and the Band has
made clear it is sincerely sorry for serious
ly offending members of the community.
At the same time, I'm sure that it was
only intended as a humorous parallel to a
football team known for its "Touchdown
Jesus." Abernethy's letter and similar
responses to the costume make me mar
vel that Western society ever made it out
of the middle ages.

Students ready with
letters, protest, action
to keep art at Stanford
Despite the small turn-out at the Oct.
7 student town meeting, those of us
involved in Stanford's arts community
are gratified by the support evident from
the broader student population.
The Faculty Senate, at least, has

established the spurious distinction
between creative arts and scholarship as
one of its budget-cutting criteria.
The real issue is not whether fine arts
are peripheral to the mission of a presti
gious university, but rather the ways in
which the fine and performing arts are
integral to the liberal arts.
The much vaunted "Stanford experi
ence" refers to the whole fabric of our
academic culture, a culture based on
community-building and a well-rounded
liberal arts education. The arts are cru
cial to both; they are synthesizing and
creative elements in what might other
wise be an arid and analytic atmosphere.
Letters are being written. Petitions
are being circulated. Events are being
planned. Stanford's threat to amputate
the arts sends an ill wind blowing
through not only our own experience,
but also through the academic environ
ment of all those institutions that look
to Stanford as an example.
I encourage all students, faculty and
staff to pick up your campus directories
and your copies of The Daily, write to
your deans, to the president and provost,
to the budget cutters, to your professors,
to the press! The issue of the conse
quences of fiscal mismanagement is
more important by far than that of its
causes.
We're not dead yet.

USSA is an important
asset for financial aid
and political lobbying
We applaud the ASSU Senate's recent
decision to retain membership in the Unit
ed States Student Association. We are the
directors of the new ASSU Financial Aid
Office.
We seek to empower Stanford students
to have more grants for their education
and fewer loans, more sympathy from the
University Office of Financial Aids and
fewer lines, and more clout on Capitol Hill.
We see our involvement with the associ
ation as critical to our being able to per
form our duties effectively.
With Stanford graduates in key posi
tions of the most respected and sought
after voice for student financial aid in
Washington, D.C., we feel confident that
we are not forgotten.
Our influence in the association's lob
bying efforts is evidenced by the well-pub
licized testimony of Stanford student
Brian Hooker at a key Congressional Edu
cation Subcommittee hearing last spring
and by our presence at follow-up hearings
in Sacramento.
As Congress prepares to vote on the
most sweeping restructuring of the Higher
Education Act in decades, the association
consistently calls for changes in the Pell

Grant system which will directly benefit
middle-income students at Stanford.
We also work with the association to
ensure that Pell Grant awards remain posi
tively indexed to account for higher tuitions
at private universities such as ours.
The association is not the sole student
lobbying group in Washington. We at the
ASSU Financial Aid Office are exploring
other student lobby groups which can pre
sent our case in Washington. For the
moment, however, the important issue is the
reauthorization process, and the association
is an undeniably key player in this process.
Our office will be working closely with
the association in the coming weeks to
organize a student letter writing cam
paign. We will be targeting our congress
man, Tom Campbell. We need to remind
him of his obligation to support financial
aid programs that would directly benefit
Stanford students, his constituency.
We are equally committed to ensuring
student input into the current restructur
ing of Stanford's aid programs and the
Office of Financial Aids. We are also set
ting up an advocacy network of experi
enced students who can offer advice on
specific problems students may be encoun
tering with their aid packages.
We have high expectations for ourselves,
for this university and for this government.
We aim to be your voice and your resource
for financial aid. Come join us.
