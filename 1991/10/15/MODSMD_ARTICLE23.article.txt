nbelievable, incredible, unstop
pable.
Dynamite, even.
But definitely, definitely, DEF
INITELY, DEFINITELY not bor
i rig.
That's the Cardinal women's
soccer team in a nutshell.
11-0 and still going strong, the
Cardinal women's soccer team
blew the doors off of another
nationally-ranked opponent yes
terday at Maloney Field, pureeing
the No. 5-and-falling Cavaliers of
Virginia, 2-0.
Julie Foudy came back to the
Farm with style, assisting on
Sarah Rafanelli's 12th goal of the
season before scoring a goal of her
own early in the first half.
Virginia, which was coming off
i 1-0 double-overtime win at No.
5 Santa Clara, was riding high
coming to Stanford to play the
No. 6 Cardinal.
It was the fifth straight
shutout for the Cardinal and for
sophomore goalkeeper Leslie Gar
ard, whose play was nothing less
than titillating as she registered
her eighth blanking of the season.
"They were beating us to the
ball all day," Cavalier midfielder
Amy Chatman said after the
game. "It was obvious who came
to play and who didn't. They
made us look real sluggish out
tiIGTG.
The Cardinal's third straight
win over a top-15 opponent left
even the Stanford players

impressed with their continued
improvement.
"This game showed that we
can hold a lead," said senior full
back Kerry Stivaletti. "We didn't
have this kind of composure last
year."
Virginia never had much of a
chance to close their early two
goal deficit. The Cardinal defense
thwarted the vast majority of
Cavalier runs at the goal, and
Garrard was there to stop what
the rest of the defense couldn't.
Garrard was thrilled with the
victory. "It was exciting that we
got to beat a No. 5 team," Garrard
said of the victory. "We're sneak
ing up on the top five." The Car
dinal is certain to overtake at
least Virginia in the national
rankings when they are updated.
Rafanelli opened the scoring at
13:29 of the first half as she took
a pass from "Magic" Foudy,
blazed around a defender and put
the ball past Cavalier keeper San
dra Kwitnieski to put Stanford up
1-0.
Foudy added an insurance goal
off a cross from junior Jen Potok
to round out the game's scoring.
Virginia managed 11 shots on
the Cardinal goal, the most taken
on Garrard all season, but it
didn't help as the Cavaliers
became the eleventh straight
team to come out of a Stanford
game with at least a one-game los
ing streak.
The game was again marked by
some questionable officiating
throughout, as many players, par
ticularly Denise Denney and
Rafanelli, were repeatedly
mugged by Virginia players with
out fouls being called.
As annoying as the officiating
may have been, however, it was
the Cavaliers who were the more
frustrated yesterday afternoon.
The Cardinal's brilliant play led
one Cavalier to wail after the
game, "I'm throwing away my
Stanford hat."
If everyone deals with defeat
the same way, then there's going
to be a hell of a lot more Cardinal
paraphernalia in the trash before
the season's over.

holds the Cardinal record for most goals in a season with 14.
