# Lethargic water polo team sunk by Cal
## 
### Aden Fine Staff Writer 
Although Saturday's game against
California started out well enough for
the Stanford water polo team, by the
end of the game, all smiles and enthu
siasm had disappeared from the Cardi
nal, as the No. 1-ranked Golden Bears

Water polo

Bears 10

Cardinal 6

cruised to a 10-6 victory.
Hoping to turn around what has
been a rather disappointing season so
far, the No. 7 Cardinal came out play
ing aggressively and giving signs that
the team had much more potential
than* its prior performances had
shown.

After stopping Cal on its opening
possession, Stanford scored the first
goal of the game, as freshman sensa
tion Wolf Wigo converted on a six-on
five advantage. The goal came after
Cal's leader — and United States
Olympic Team member — Chris Hum
bert was ejected for twenty seconds for
blatantly kicking Wigo in the face.
Things began to look even better
for Stanford when the defense held
once again and junior Chip Blanken
horn got free on a breakaway and beat
the goalie to make it 2-0.
But then, as Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti said, "We just had a com
plete breakdown."
Did they ever. Down 2-0 with four
minutes left in the first quarter, Cal's
dangerous offense exploded and scored
an amazing four goals in four minutes
to take a 4-2 lead at the end of the
quarter. Humbert scored three of
those goals.
Dettamanti was obviously not

pleased with the turn of events. "To
give up four straight goals like that at
the end of a quarter, well, you just
don't do that. That should never hap
pen. They are a great team, but it was
really our fault. We made some bad
mistakes and let some balls get by that
shouldn't have, and you just can't do
that against Cal."
It got even worse, as Cal continued
to score and capitalize on Cardinal
mistakes. With four and a half min
utes left in the third quarter the Bears
had run the score to 8-2.
Dettamanti put the second string in
during this quarter, and they made it
closer in the fourth quarter — closing
the gap to 9-6 with one and a half min
utes left in the game — but it was not
enough to overcome the deficit.
Though his team's performance
was not the greatest, what upset Det
tamanti even more was the effort
given by the team. "You'd think
against Cal, the No. 1 team in the

country, that we'd come out and play
our guts out, but I don't feel one guy
on our team did that. We let them
intimidate us, we allowed them to
pressure us, and our lack of effort real
ly killed us.
"In my fourteen years at Stanford,
I don't think I've ever been so disap
pointed with a team. They just don't
seem to care at all, and I've got to
question whether they even care if we
win or lose. I'm not used to this at all,
and I don't know what to say," Detta
manti said.
The team will play at UCLA and
USC this weekend in crucial games —
and Dettamanti plans on making sev
eral major changes.
"I have to do something drastic,
because the guys who are playing just
aren't showing me anything. The sea
son's almost over, and I can't just let
this go on."
Stanford is now 7-7 for the year and
0-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play.
