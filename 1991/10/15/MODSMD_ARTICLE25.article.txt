# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Sometimes praise goes to a player who has
sizzling, in-your-face game. Other times,
hlete who consistently turns in solid
I rf ormances gets the accolades. This week's
honors encompass both of these scenarios.
For leading the women's volleyball team
its best start ever, Bev Oden is Athlete of
i he Week. Joining her is Jim Talluto, start
iiig forward and leading scorer on the men's
soccer team.

Accolades are nothing new to Oden, who
was NCAA Player of the Year last season.
Also she was recently named the Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Week for the fourth
time in less than three years.
Known as one of the "Big Three" on the
volleyball team, the junior hitter has had her
share of outstanding games, many of them
coming this season.
Against No. 2-ranked and then-undefeat
ed Pacific, Oden had 19 kills, 12 digs, and 13
blocks — her second triple-double of the sea
son and the fifth of her career.
Oregon State and Oregon did not have
much better luck against her. She had nine
kills and 13 digs against the Beavers. She
pounded 14 kills against the Ducks and had
12 digs.
Oden leads the Cardinal in solo blocks and
block assists. She is second in kills, digs and
service aces.
❖ ❖
The men's soccer ("urn's ace-in-the-hole is
Jim Talluto. The junior forward has not scored
a hat trick this season, or single-handedly led
the squad to victory. However, he has con
tributed to Cardinal scores in almost every
game.
He scored the decisive first goal against Cor
nell Friday, upping his season total to nine. He
also has three assists to lead the team in scor
ing with 21 points (two points for goal, one for
assist).
He led the squad in points last year with
23. He was top goal-scorer in 1990, tallying

10 goals.
In the Cardinal's 13 games so far this sea
son, Talluto has had a goal or assist in nine of
them. The team has won four games in a row
and faces the top-ranked Santa Clara Broncos
in a Friday doubleheader with the women's
squads.
If the Cardinal wins that game — and goes
on to receive an NCAA Tournament bid — Jim
Talluto will be a major reason why.
