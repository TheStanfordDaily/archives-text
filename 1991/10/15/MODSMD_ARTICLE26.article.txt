# The
						nature of the Zone
## 
### 
There is a place where victoiy assured. A place
where you can do no wrong, where you can
master the very laws of physics, where you are
always Bad Ass, where you always Kick Butt, where
... etc.
No, Cardinal fans, I'm not talking about Stanford
women's volleyball matches. I'm not talking about
Iraq or the White House Press Room or the real

estate market in Seattle if you're from California.
I'm talking about the Zone.
And just where is this mythical "Zone," I hear
you ask.
Well, when Bob Beamon set his seemingly unas
sailable world record in 1968, he jumped in the
Zone. When Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in
one game, he played in the Zone. When Jennifer
Azzi led Stanford's landmark upset of Tennessee in
women's basketball two years ago, she pulled every
fan in Maples Pavilion into the Zone with her.
Chances are you know exactly what I'm talking
about. Chances are you've been there, perhaps in
intramurals or high school athletics.
But maybe you haven't. In that case you might
object, and you might even paraphrase a certain
bratty pop protagonist in your objection: "But with
the blast shield down, I can't see a thing!"
Precisely! The idea is that you don't want to con
centrate. Or, to be more exact, you don't want to be
consciously aware that you're concentrating. It
would be like trying to walk. You don't try to walk;
you just do it.
So, when athletes talk about the Zone, they are
speaking about a state of mind. A state where,
without even trying, you achieve transcen
dence, a kind of temporary immortality. You
become, as an infamous hardcore rock band once
said, "One with the Universe."
There are certain philosophical issues that the
Zone generates. For example, what happens when a
cornerback is covering a wide receiver, and both are
in the Zone? This is of course similar to the question
of what happens when an irresistible force meets an
immovable object.
Maybe it is only a question of training. World
class athletes who train extensively tend to be high
ly consistent, since they have pushed their bodies to
their limits. But most of us (including the majority
of varsity athletes) are quite inconsistent in our lev
els of performance, so when for whatever reason we
are close to our limit, we arbitrarily dub that the
Zone.
The question, therefore, is does the Zone exist?
There are other questions, too: What if only some
people can enter the Zone?
I don't know what the "experts" have to say
about the Zone phenomenon. I would be interested
to hear the theories of psychologists and physiolo
gists as to what's going on when someone is in the
Zone.
Stop laughing at me. I'm serious. I mean, think of
the applications! If we could figure out how to pre
dict when someone might enter the Zone, we could
harness that.
But why stop there? Imagine if we could trigger
the Zone at will! I'm tellin' ya, the mind boggles. You
could apply the technique to anything â€” not just
your IM thumbwrestling match, but your CIV paper,
your CE 170 exam, your Oracle interview, navigat
ing your bike through White Plaza. Even sex. Wow.

Tyson Vaughan is a big fan of Flagboy and can't
understand why the Daily "panned" him.
