Stanford started tentatively
against a strong UCLA team.
The Bruins took advantage of
the Cardinal's slow start and
jumped out to a 3-1 lead. Stan
ford woke up in the third period
and scored to come within a
goal, but they were not able to
pull out the victory.
"UCLA is a very solid and
hard-hitting team," said team
captain Torque Zubek. "It
wasn't until the middle of the
second quarter that we got our
act together."
Undaunted by the tough

loss, the Cardinal came out fir
ing against Pepperdine. Led by
freshman standout Luke Win
ter's four goals and by a domi
nating overall team effort,
Stanford easily took both
matches. In the first game,
goalie Bill Sutherland recorded
the first shutout of the season
as Stanford cruised to a 4-0
win. Game two was slightly
closer, but three goals in the
third period iced the victory for
Stanford. The Cardinal con
trolled the puck in both games,
outshooting the opposition 48-
7 and 51-16.
Team members are confi
dent of what already looks to
be a promising season.
"We've had good coaching,
and things are definitely work
ing well," said Zubek.
"We're not a good team
because of just a few individu
als," Winter added. "lOur suc
cessl is due to the whole team's
effort."
Stanford is led by head
coach Ernie Ferrari and assis
tant coach Steve Dixon. The
team will open their home
schedule against Arizona State
at 7 p.m., Oct. 18, at the Gold
en Gate Tee Arena in Redwood
City.
