# Moving just across the street
## Paly grads see advantages in staying nearby

Every year the Stanford fam
ily adopts more than 1,500 new
children. The majority of these
children travel great distances
to arrive at school, to a new life
in a world away from Mom and
Dad, leading to an occasional
case of acute homesickness.
But not all the new children
have to travel very far. In fact,
every year a handful of fresh
men leave their high school
graduation ceremonies in June
only to cross the street to attend
Stanford in September.
Palo Alto High School,
warmly referred to by its stu
dents as Paly, stands across El
Camino Real, facing the north
east side of campus. Yet regard
less of Paly's physical proximity
to Stanford life, the two worlds
— according to its graduates —
are totally different.
In the past four years, more
than 20 Paly students — of the
dozens accepted each spring —
selected Stanford as their new
home away from home. Devel
oping the "away" part of "away
from home" is what adds an
interesting twist to the college
lives of these Paly graduates.
Paula Sanjines is convinced
that her experience at Stanford
so far has been like any other
new freshman's. As a Paly stu
dent, she said, "I would always
see people running around on
campus. Now I'm actually get
ting to know those people."
Before, the campus was just
"a bunch of buildings." Now,
Sanjines said, exploring those
buildings is an adventure —
even if she may have seen them
around.

Most Paly students had some
sort of previous association with
Stanford, ranging from working
as lab assistants to attending
parties.
Sanjines is not embarrassed
to admit that she sometimes
feels "just as insecure" as a stu
dent from the East Coast might
feel trying to figure out the loca
tion of an obscure classroom.

Anne Lee, another of the
eight Paly graduates in the
Stanford's class of 1995, said
that although there are cons,
having the security of home,
knowing "which restaurants
are good," and of course, not
having to deal with the infa
mous "Eastern Weather" are

For freshmen Anne Lee, left, and Ornit Yotam, the trip home
doesn't take long. Both graduated from Palo Alto High School.
