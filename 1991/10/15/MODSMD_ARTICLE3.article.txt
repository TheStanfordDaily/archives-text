# Moving just across the street
## Paly grads see advantages in staying nearby 
### Elisa Nino-Murcia 
Every year the Stanford fam
ily adopts more than 1,500 new
children. The majority of these
children travel great distances
to arrive at school, to a new life
in a world away from Mom and
Dad, leading to an occasional
case of acute homesickness.
But not all the new children
have to travel very far. In fact,
every year a handful of fresh
men leave their high school
graduation ceremonies in June
only to cross the street to attend
Stanford in September.
Palo Alto High School,
warmly referred to by its stu
dents as Paly, stands across El
Camino Real, facing the north
east side of campus. Yet regard
less of Paly's physical proximity
to Stanford life, the two worlds
— according to its graduates —
are totally different.
In the past four years, more
than 20 Paly students — of the
dozens accepted each spring —
selected Stanford as their new
home away from home. Devel
oping the "away" part of "away
from home" is what adds an
interesting twist to the college
lives of these Paly graduates.
Paula Sanjines is convinced
that her experience at Stanford
so far has been like any other
new freshman's. As a Paly stu
dent, she said, "I would always
see people running around on
campus. Now I'm actually get
ting to know those people."
Before, the campus was just
"a bunch of buildings." Now,
Sanjines said, exploring those
buildings is an adventure —
even if she may have seen them
around.

Most Paly students had some
sort of previous association with
Stanford, ranging from working
as lab assistants to attending
parties.
Sanjines is not embarrassed
to admit that she sometimes
feels "just as insecure" as a stu
dent from the East Coast might
feel trying to figure out the loca
tion of an obscure classroom.

Anne Lee, another of the
eight Paly graduates in the
Stanford's class of 1995, said
that although there are cons,
having the security of home,
knowing "which restaurants
are good," and of course, not
having to deal with the infa
mous "Eastern Weather" are

For freshmen Anne Lee, left, and Ornit Yotam, the trip home
doesn't take long. Both graduated from Palo Alto High School.
advantages.
Most Paly graduates had the
option of moving east to experi
ence what society tells them they
are obligated to face in these late
teen-age years: the experience of
being totally independent.
Some Paly students said the
pressure on them to go far away
was sometimes so great from
friends, relatives and high school
teachers that the students began
to lose sight of the benefits of a
Stanford education.
Many of them, debating over
which school to attend in the fall, were
talked into believing that Stanford
was simply not an option because it
was right in their backyard.
Cameron Hamill, a Harvard
transfer student originally from
the Palo Alto area, believed that
she too had to "prove that she
could live away from home."
She decided to "take the risk" of
going east, but quickly found she
didn't like it. After a year at Har
vard, Cameron realized that inde
pendence is within the individual
and not dependent upon physical
distance, and said to herself, "It's
OK that I want to go home."
Now she encourages high school
seniors to resist putting the college
decision up to "their heads" and
rather to "follow [their] instincts."
With time, students facing the
college-choice dilemma — like

freshman Nick Mang — learn to
focus on what Stanford has to offer
as a university as opposed to a geo
graphical location. Pamela Mang
recalled that her son arrived at his
own conclusion to attend Stanford
as a result of simply learning to
"understand himself' and to
appreciate Stanford's advantages.
Nick Mang admitted that the
decision was hard at first because
he "wanted some distance." But he
noted that when he goes home (on
rare occasions), the trip feels as if
he were "getting on a plane and
going home."
Fruma Yotam, another parent
of a Paly graduate, recalled not
being allowed even to see her
daughter's room. All in all, the
Paly graduates seem to agree with
Lee's view that the parents are
usually "really nice about it."
The Paly veterans said they
understand and appreciate the
decisions of other classmates who
opted to move far away.
Now, though not even a full
month into the quarter, the stu
dents said they already sense they
have a new home quite apart from
their high school scene.
Paly guidance counselor Jack
Phillips said Paly graduates "are
successful at becoming Stanford cit
izens instead of Palo Alto citizens."
When asked how she felt being
so close to Palo Alto, Lee respond
ed, "My room is my new home."
For Lee and all the others, "Let's
go back home" doesn't mean
downtown Palo Alto anymore.
Home is here.
