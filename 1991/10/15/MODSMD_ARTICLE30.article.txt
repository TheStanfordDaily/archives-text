# Native Americans pan Columbus Day holiday
## 
### Alexa E. Lee Staff Writer 
For many, yesterday's kick
off to the 500 th anniversary of
Christopher Columbus's voyage
to America evoked a sense of
pride and patriotism as the
nation toasted a man widely
accepted for importing progress
and civilization to the New
World.
For others, Columbus is no
hero.
Members of the Native Amer
ican community gathered and
posted signs in front of Old
Union and around the Law
school yesterday. Many said
they felt outrage and sadness for
the loss of their culture — emo
tions that have marked their
people for the last 500 years.
"To celebrate Columbus Day
is to celebrate the concept of
white supremacy," according to
junior Angelique Jackson, a Sis
seton-Wahpeton Dakota and
the chair of the Stanford Native
American Issues League.
"Columbus has been pre
sented historically as a hero fig
ure, bringing civilization,
Christianity and so called
progress to the Americas when
in fact he brought massacres,
assimilation [and] destruction
of the lands," she said.
According to Bill Brae, an
education graduate student
from the Creek tribe, "There
were about 25-30 million
Native Americans at the time of
Columbus's arrival in 1492, but
by 1890, our population dwin
dled down to roughly 2 million.

Whole tribes were wiped out."
These deaths are what His
tory Prof. Gavin Langmuir calls
"the unfortunate result of what
happens when two totally dif
ferent cultures meet face-to
face and one overpowers the
other."
"There is no doubt that
Columbus came with an eye for
conquering the land, but at that
time almost anyone would
have," added History Prof.
Steve Ozment.
"He came as a conqueror to
an inhabited land and enslaved
the Indians there. But when
there is loss, there is also gain.
The technology and progress
that exists today would never
have happened if he had not
opened the New World for
exploration," said Ozment.
Native American law stu
dent Samantha Rijken sees the
situation differently.
"Where is the 'progress' in
the killings?" she asks. Seeing
Columbus as one who helped to
create a more civilized world is
"like looking through rose-col
ored glasses. What most learn
about Columbus is biased and
few understand the truth of
what he really did."
Brae contended that much of
the conflict stems from funda
mental differences in Native
American and expansionist
philosophies. "Native Ameri
cans have always prized securi
ty and continuity, while West
ern cultures are obsessed with
change. For them, the change
was good — they became
wealthy."
