# Funding sought for disabled transport
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Shelby Morgan 
Last year, a disabled student
could get a ride to class, for free,
just by calling the Disability Golf
Cart Service.
But because the Department of
Parking and Transportation had
to balance its budget, the two
year-old service has been can
celed, and students who are
unable to walk or bike to class
must ride the Para-Transit van.
The department funded the
cart service since its inception but
is now faced with a budget deficit.
It is reluctant to raise parking
fees, a primary source of rev
enues, beyond what staff can pay,
so programs must be cut.
Now, the search for funding is
on, and while everyone seems to
agree the service should exist, no
one agrees on who should pay for it.
Steve Heckler, coordinator for

the golf cart service, said the Uni
versity should foot the bill,
"because it is an access issue . . .
the money should come from Uni
versity funds."
In the meantime, Heckler is
searching for funds that will
bring the service back. He is
working with the ASSU program
board, which will vote later this
month on possible funding of the
service.
Julia Fremon, manager of
transportation programs, also
said the University — and not the
ASSU or her particular depart
ment — should fund the service.
According to Molly Sandperl,
the head of the Disability
Resource Center, the Para-Tran
sit Van meets Stanford Universi
ty's legal requirement to provide
transportation to individuals with
limited mobility.

Steve Heckler, coordinator of a golf-cart service for disabled students, says the University should
restore the program's funding — which was a victim of a cash crunch in the Department of Parking and
Transportation.
However, she said, the Univer
sity should go beyond the require
ments to deal with the logistical
problems unique to people with
restricted mobility.
In the meantime, no one seems
happy with the switch from golf
carts to the Para-Transit van.
Students have complained that
the van has limited access to vital

areas such as the quad, and have
complained of overcrowding.
Heckler said many students
dislike the visibility of a full-size
van transporting them around
campus. Participants in the cart
service have praised its sensitivity
to the needs of its users and its
convenient door-to-door service.
According to cart-driver Shirley
Tsai, the service met "a real need
on campus for disabled people to
get around. How would you get
around without two legs .. . ?"
If the service is reinstated,

drivers, who were paid last year,
will be asked to volunteer this
year. The coordinator, however,
will be paid, unlike last year.
The department also cut a staff
position and renegotiated its contract
with Marguerite, Stanford's shuttle
service, to meet budget constraints.
