# Sexual conduct policy statement nears completion
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
A broad, University-wide policy
on unacceptable sexual conduct
proposed earlier this year may be
instituted some time this quarter,
according to University officials.
Based on a recommendation
set forth by the Sexual Assault
Task Force last January, the new
policy will recognize that "there is
a range of sexual conduct that is
unacceptable in the Stanford com
munity." The policy will address
the entire spectrum of offensive
sexual behavior, from gender
based harassment to rape, and
will replace the current University
Sexual Harassment Policy.
The current draft of the policy,
which has been revised several
times, will be reviewed tomorrow
by a group of University officials.
"We are still in the process of
revising and refining the policy,"
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son said, adding that the policy
must take into consideration the
needs of the different schools.
Discussion of the policy will be
on the agenda of Wednesday's reg
ular meeting of the University
p r°sident's Operations Council,
which is comprised of vice presi
dents and chaired by Provost
James Rosse. Several staff mem
bers will also be present to evaluate
the draft, according to Jackson.
The exact procedure by which
the policy will be instituted is
undetermined, but may be clari
fied at Wednesday's meeting.
However, members of the admin
istration foresee Kennedy himself
implementing the policy, the same
way he promulgated the Universi
ty alcohol policy last year.
Since the policy would be Uni
versity-wide — affecting faculty,

staff and students — Kennedy
need not receive approval from
any group before instituting it.
Policies, such as the Honor Code,
that affect student conduct alone,
must be approved by the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
before they are implemented.
It is unclear when the final
draft of the policy will be complet
ed, but Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole said she "hope(s) it
moves quickly. The issues are
obviously timely and important."
Others believe the recent
alleged sexual assault has raised
community awareness of the
problem and will help speed this
process along. "My personal opin
ion is that we should have a final
draft this calendar year," said
Doug Dupen, a director of Univer
sity employee relations who has
been working on the policy for
several weeks.
Cole and Legal Counsel Susan
Hoerger began formulating the
new policy shortly after the Sexual
Assault Task Force Report was
released last January. Along with
Acting Vice President for Student
Resources Sally Mahoney and Vice
President for Human Resources
Barbara Butterfield, they designed
the policy to comply with both the
recommendations and a state law
— effective January, 1991 —
requiring colleges to provide com
plete and comprehensive services
to victims of sexual assault.
The Task Force Report recom
mended that the University
"develop and adopt a formal policy
stating that Stanford will not tol
erate unacceptable sexual con
duct," and called on the University
president to "make a public state
ment supporting the policy on
Unacceptable Sexual Conduct."
Although the actions that will
be decried in the new policy are
already viewed as violations of
the Fundamental Standard, Cole
said mentioning them explicitly is
important. The implementation
of a distinct policy "adds clout to
an important institutional mes
sage by separating it out and
being more specific," she said.
The policy "recognizes that
some of these (unacceptable
actions) are very difficult to pin
point, but that doesn't make them
acceptable," Cole said.
University officials working on
the policy have not yet addressed
whether it will include a general
description of unacceptable con
duct, like the existing sexual
harassment policy, or include spe
cific illustrations, like the Sexual
Assault Task Force Report,
according to Cole.
However, the Task Force
Report lays out a number of
examples of reprehensible behav
ior, which may be used in the
University's policy. These exam
ples include the following areas:
• Sexual harassment, which
may involve persistent unwel
come remarks based on gender,
serious or persistent unwanted
sexual attention, obscene phone
calls, flashing or display of explic
it visual material such as posters;
• Intimidation or coercion, which
involves sexual activity obtained by
abusing a role of authority or exert
ing psychological pressure;
• Sexual assault and battery,
which involves attempted or actual
unconsented sexual activity; and
• Rape, which is defined in the
Task Force Report as "unlawful
sexual intercourse, including inter
course between people who are
acquainted with each other,
against the will of one participant."
In addition to its greater
breadth, the new policy aims to
provide a more comprehensive
and workable approach to sexual
harassment cases.
