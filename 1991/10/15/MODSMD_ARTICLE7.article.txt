# Med Center parking: 'Nobody's happy'
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
University officals are driving
Medical Center employees mad
with an unexpected change in
parking privileges.
In order to make way for new
construction, employees holding
$200 'A' permits are now forced to
park in the Medical Center's
expansive 'C' lots, while holders of
the $50 'C' permits are redirected
to dirt fields near the Stock Farm
and the Stanford Barn.
"Nobody's happy," said Direc
tor of Security Services Mike
Stultz, whose office is responsible
for parking arrangements on cam
pus. "I'm even getting complaints
from the 'A' permit holders."
Four hundred parking spaces
reserved for patients and physi
cians were displaced when con
struction began on a new parking
structure yesterday. In two weeks,
another construction project will
displace an additional 350 spaces.
In order to make up for the loss of
patient parking, Medical Center
employees had their parking
downgraded by one level, leaving
'C' permit holders literally in the
dust.
Although Medical Center ad
ministrators were notified of the
changes two weeks ago, most per
mit holders found out about them
through flyers placed on their car
windshields just last week.

Some employees did not receive
the flyers. Those who did were
both surprised and angered by the
news. An open forum held Friday
morning with Stultz and Stanford
Hospital Associate Director Louis
Saksen did not put an end to the
permit holders' complaints.
"The changes basically force peo
ple to park in very distant, possibly
unsafe places," said Mark Heller, a
research associate working in the
Beckman Center. Like many Medi
cal Center employees, Heller often
works until 10 p.m. or later.

Peak parking hours at the Med
ical Center are 11 a.m. for 'C' lots
and 2 p.m. for 'A' lots, according to
Stultz. Because extra 'A' spaces
are reserved for night employees,
the newly-enlarged 'A' lots were
conspicuously empty Monday
morning, encouraging several
resentful 'C' permit holders to
park in 'A' lots. Stultz said a study
will be done in order to determine
whether or not the extra 'A' spaces
are needed.
"If the pattern doesn't change
by [this] afternoon, I'll start

changing some of those 'A' spots
back into 'C' spots," Stultz
promised. "The 'C' permit holders
who are parking in those 'A' lots as
a form of protest are their own
worst enemies because their cars
are being counted as 'A' permits."
Besides disrupting the counting
process, rebellious permit holders
are in danger of being ticketed.
Although offenders were only sup
posed to receive warnings during
the first few days of the new
arrangement, several $15 tickets
were accidentally issued yesterday,
according to Stultz.
Those who did not park illegally
were forced to seek space in the
fields north of the Medical Center,
approximately eight minutes'
walking distance from the School
of Medicine.
"It took me an hour to find a
space today, and I'm parked half a
mile away from here," said gradu
ate student Mike McCann, who
works in the Beckman Center.
McCann finally parked his car in
an empty lot near the intersection
of Quarry and Welch.
"It was just a dirt field a few
days ago," he reflected nostalgical
ly-
According to Stultz, the Quarry
lot is not "just a dirt field," but "a
dirt field that will soon be lit."
Until lights can be installed in the
new lots, the department plans to
increase security patrols and
escort services in the area.
