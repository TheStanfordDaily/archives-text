# Proposal to give perks for medical references comes under fire

### Christine Dal Bello with AP wire reports 
A rejected proposal that would have
given perks to doctors who referred
patients to the Medical Center has come
under fire by the American Medical Asso
ciation and several physicians.
The plan dealt with the establishment
of the Stanford University Referral
Group whose members, doctors in North
ern California, would be entitled to edu
cational seminars and "timely, personal,

service-oriented care for their patients,"
according to the draft report, which was
rejected early last month, said Medical
Center spokesperson Spyros Andreopou
los.
Andreopoulos said two or three of the
proposed benefits were misconstrued.
One of the possible benefits was attend
ing an annual continuing education con
ference, possibly at The Lodge on the
famous Pebble Beach Golf Links near
Monterey.
"The proposal was motivated by a

need to respond to referring physicians
who weren't fully aware of the services
offered at Stanford," he said.
Some doctors complained that the pro
posed policy was unfair and unethical.
"The whole concept of this kind of
marketing effort by professionals turns
my stomach," said Dr. George Lundberg,
editor of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
Roger Purdy, of the California Medical
Association's judicial affairs and ethics
committee, said "Not only does state and

federal law prohibit this, but it's well
established in the medical community
that kickbacks are unethical."
The proposal's author, Medicine Asst.
Prof. Tim Fischell, complained that the
proposal was not meant for public dis
semination. "Someone got hold of a very
early draft of some ideas that were being
discussed and evolved," Fischell said.
"Some parts were taken out of context
and distorted."
Still, he defended the idea, saying,
"This goes on all the time in private prac

tice whether doctors admit it or not.
"No one would deny that there is com
petition for patients in the Bay Area," he
said. "But what is unethical about pro
viding good service to both the doctor and
the patient? We must re-evaluate the
kind of care and service the faculty and
physicians at Stanford must provide."
Andreopolous said the proposal was
never seriously considered. "The propos
al did not basically reflect the way Stan
ford has practiced medicine, so it was
rejected," Andreopolous said.
