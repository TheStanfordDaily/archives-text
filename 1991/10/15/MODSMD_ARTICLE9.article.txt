No relief for Croatia
VINKOVCI, Yugoslavia (AP) - For a fifth
day, a European Community-led relief convoy
was unable yesterday to enter a besieged Croa
tian city because of intransigence and mistrust
on both sides of Yugoslavia's civil war.
"The two sides didn't want any relief or food
in Vukovar," said Michel Robert, head of the
EC team attempting to bring a 50-truck con
voy with food and medicine into the Danube
River town on Croatia's border with rival Ser
bia.
Failure of the relief mission could spark
more fighting in eastern Croatia, scene of some
of the worst battles since the republic and
Slovenia declared independence June 25.
Columbus Day protested
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Hundreds of
American Indians held a traditional fire and
dance ceremony on Alcatraz Island yesterday
to honor their roots and protest the observance
of Columbus Day.
"My main reason was to sing and dance and
recognize Indians being together again. We're
not here to celebrate Columbus landing in
America," said David Smith, 41, of the Pomo
Indian nation.
The early morning ceremony sponsored by
the International Indian Treaty Council
brought out about 300 people who took ferries
over to the deserted island jail.
