GROWING UP WHILE GROWING
OLDER. By Jon Eisenson. Pacific Books,
$21.95 ... "Here's a feel good book about old
age. If you haven't noticed, that category of
Americans is increasing, likely to be in the
majority in another fifty years. And some say
that life won't be as good as it was. The
author disagrees. A clinical psychologist and professor emeritus at
Stanford University, he is not a cockeyed optimist but does believe that
senior citizens will become better off than their progenitors ... In a mix of
personal observations and extensive scientific evidence, Eisenson tears
apart some of the myths that can get in the way of the good life ... Yes,
mankind is mortal. But that's no reason to miss the best parts of each age.
This book helps make the best of those final chapters."
— The Book Reader — Sept.-Oct., 1991
