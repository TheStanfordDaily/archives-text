# Not the same old calculus
## They're teaching it in a new way, not pleasing all 
### Annie Decker 
A new method of teaching
calculus placing increased
emphasis on visual examples
and word problems is expected
to change the way Stanford stu
dents approach math, but some
students aren't happy about it.
Last fall, the Mathematics
Department implemented a new
style of teaching into the 40
series of math, mainly through
the efforts of Prof. Brad
Osgood. This year, the program
was expanded to include the 20
series.
The non-traditional approach
utilizes a calculus textbook pub
lished by the Harvard Calculus
Consortium, a group of colleges
and high schools that includes
Stanford. A National Science
Foundation grant provided the
primary funds for the 545-page
textbook.
Each Math 41 student now
receives a handout which states
that the new text will give the
student "both a clear picture of
the real mathematical ideas in
the subject and also . . . experi
ence in solving varied and inter
esting problems using varied
and interesting techniques."
But according to freshman
Cyndi Vazquez, "The new way
is word problems, and I always
hated word problems.
"It's a totally new way of
looking at math, and it is frus
trating to have to relearn every
thing," she added.
The conceptual approach
requires that students buy or
have immediate access to a $90
calculator which comes with a
variety of features; the calcula
tor graphs equations, computes
a definite integral numerically
and finds the roots of equations.
Osgood hopes that the new
method will give a more "more
even-handed treatment of alge
braic, graphic, and numerical
concepts" than the old style. He
sees the new way as a more cre
ative approach to solving math
ematical problems.

The old way required much
more manipulation of formulas,
as in applying individual data to
an already established model,
according to Osgood. But now,
he said, students will learn why
a problem is solved in a certain
way, not just how to plug in
numbers.
Currently, the three-quarter
Math 20 series, Math 41 and
Math 42 are completely taught
in the new style. Math 43, how
ever, is still taught in the "old"
style. Osgood said that within
the next five years the entire
calculus curriculum will consist

of the new conceptual approach.
To prepare for the drastic
change in method, the staff
received extensive coaching in
the new system, in addition to
an in-depth "Instructors Manu
al."
Despite the optimism and
enthusiasm of professors about
the worth of the new system,
several freshmen taking Math
41 expressed negative opinions.
According to Jay Cairns, "It
used to just be numbers. Now,
you are given a word problem.
