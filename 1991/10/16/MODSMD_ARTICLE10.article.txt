Peace conference probable
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Secretary of
State James Baker was on the verge Tuesday
of sealing arrangements for a Mideast peace
conference to open in Lausanne,
Switzerland, on Oct. 29, U.S. and other
diplomatic sources said.
Even as Baker was holding extended talks
with Syria's president Hafez Assad, the
sources said the Swiss city would be the site
barring last-minute hitches in Baker's diplo
macy. The open questions rested primarily
on the issue of Palestinian participation —
and there was progress on that score in
neighboring Jordan.
Swaggart steps down
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Television

Jimmy Swaggart Ministries while his father
undergoes professional counseling and medi
cal care.
After "a time of healing and counseling. . . .
Dad will once again assume the pulpit at Family
Worship Center," he said in a statement a min
istry spokesman later gave to reporters kept
outside the 7,000-seat assembly center.
