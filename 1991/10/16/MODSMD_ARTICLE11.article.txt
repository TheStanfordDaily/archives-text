# Thomas wins Senate confirmation, 52-48
## Closest vote in 110 years makes him second black ever to serve on Supreme Court 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Judge Clarence Thomas
narrowly won Senate confirmation for the Supreme
Court last night, overcoming explosive accusations
of sexual harassment to become the second black
justice in history.
Thomas gained crucial help from Democrats in
the 52 to 48 vote, the closest in this century for a
successful nominee to the high court. The outcome
ended one of the angriest, most emotionally
charged confirmation battles ever.
Thomas' confirmation strengthens an already
solid conservative majority on the court, where lib
erals will be outnumbered seven to two. The court
is likely to continue moving to the right on issues
such as abortion, separation of church and state,
and the rights of criminal suspects.
Immediately after the vote, President Bush
called Thomas with congratulations. Thomas had
watched the vote on television at home.
"You're a wonderful inspiration, and you had
the overwhelming support of the American people,"
Bush said, according to press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater. "You have a lifetime of service to your
country ahead. Well done." Barbara Bush also got
on the phone to congratulate Thomas.
With the outcome in doubt until the final hours,
Vice President Dan Quayle rushed back from a
political trip to Ohio to sit as the presiding officer
and cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary. It wasn't
needed.
The visitors' galleries were packed but hushed as
senators rose, one by one, to cast their votes.
It was an uneasy decision for many senators,

forcing them to judge between the irreconcilably
different stories of accuser and accused.
Even while voting for Thomas, Sen. Nancy
Kassenbaum, R-Kan., one of the two women in the
Senate, said he will "live under a cloud of suspicion
he can never fully escape."
Thomas had been accused by law professor Anita
Hill of making unwanted advances and humiliating
her with lewd remarks a decade ago when she
worked for him at the Education Department and
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Her
surprise charges brought an abrupt halt to the
Senate's plans to vote on Thomas' nomination a
week ago.
Thomas emphatically denied the charges and
complained he was the victim of a "high-tech
lynching." The nation was transfixed as the accu
sations were spelled out in explicit detail and debat
ed in nationally televised hearings.
Thomas won confirmation with support from 41
of the Senate's 43 Republicans and 11 Democrats:
Sens. Sam Nunn, Wyche Fowler, Charles Robb, J.
James Exon, Alan Dixon, Richard Shelby, John
Breaux, J. Bennett Johnston, David Boren and
Ernest Hollings.
Sens. James Jeffords and Mark Hatfield cast the
only Republican votes against him.
It was the closest vote for a successful Supreme
Court nominee since 1888, when Lucius Q. Lamar
went onto the bench on a 32-28 vote.
Three Democrats who had supported Thomas
before Hill's charges were made public switched
sides and voted against him: Harry Reid and

Richard Bryan, both of Nevada, and Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut.
A federal appeals court judge, Thomas was nom
inated to succeed retired Justice Thurgood
Marshall. He would become the nation's 106 th
Supreme Court justice and the second black, after
Marshall, to sit on the high court.
Court sources said Thomas likely would be
sworn in next Monday morning.
Hill's charges, which resulted in a week's delay
in the confirmation vote, defined the final hours of
Senate debate. All but forgotten were the early
battle lines, in which Thomas' supporters empha
sized his rags-to-riches story and opponents char
acterized Thomas as insensitive to women, the
elderly and fellow minorities.
"If we make a mistake today, the Supreme
Court will be living with it, and the nation will be
living with it for the next 30 to 40 years," argued
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. "That is too
high a price to pay. . . .To give the benefit of the
doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge
Thomas is more important than the Supreme
Court."
However, Democrats J. James Exon of
Nebraska and Alan Dixon of Illinois said Hill failed
to conclusively prove her allegations against
Thomas during three days of Judiciary Committee
hearings.
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., one of only two
women in the Senate, said a vote against Thomas
could help persuade American women to speak up
when they are harassed. "We have an opportunity
to send a message everywhere," she said.
