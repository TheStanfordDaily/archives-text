A fraternity flier elicits
criticism with racially
provocative imagery

Although Stanford often
seems a truly harmonious and
multicultural environment,
we are periodically reminded of
deeply rooted racial tensions.
A recent flier advertising a
social event hosted by Omega Psi
Phi, an African-American fraterni
ty, did just this. The concerned
flier depicted an African warrior
wielding a sword in one hand and a
severed head in the other, with the
expression "Damn Skippy. We wit
it" across the bottom.
The incident has caused signifi
cant debate throughout campus.
Many people construed the war
rior to be holding the severed head
of a white man and took this as a
symbol of racially motivated and
sanctioned violence.
In response to criticism, mem
bers of Omega Psi Phi explained in a
letter to The Daily (Oct. 14) that the
face was not that of a white man,
but instead portrayed "a multi-eth
nic visage representing the univer
sal oppressor." They said the image
on the flier symbolized the ongoing
struggle to overcome racial discrim
ination and oppression.
While the violence depicted in
the sophomoric, cartoon-like image
on the flier did not cause fear with
in the Stanford community, it did
provoke emotions which seem to
run counter to racial understand
ing. It made some people wonder if
Stanford subscribes to an unfair
racial double standard.
Would that flier, if printed with
roles reversed, have caused more
outrage? While concern for one
another would dictate that neither
of the fliers should be made, the
important thing is that all groups
on campus should and do have the
right to challenge assumptions and
conventions.
Some critics have accused the

Omega Psi Phis of violating the
controversial and often misinter
preted "fighting words" clause of
the Fundamental Standard.
Quite simply, this accusation is
wrong.
The Fundamental Standard was
reinterpreted in June 1990 to pro
tect the individual from direct,
hateful abuse. It does not prohibit
groups from exercising their right
to free speech, provided it is not
focused on one individual or a
small group of individuals.
This flier is not an example of
racism or reverse discrimination.
The flier may have caused a lot of
people to feel uncomfortable, but no
one said student's lives at Stanford
were supposed to be comfortable.
Nevertheless, despite the frater
nity's intentions, the flier's violent
image did insult many people who
are legitimately concerned with
working toward racial justice. Fur
thermore, the flier seemed to be
almost intentionally divisive.
The majority of the Stanford
community was unable to decipher
the meaning of the words printed
on it. In responding to such igno
rance, the Omega Psi Phis cited
this as an example of lack of con
cern for and understanding of
black culture. But they still did not
explain its meaning.
This highlights the cyclical
nature of cultural misunderstand
ing: It is hard for people in differ
ent communities to bridge the gap
between themselves before they
understand each other, and it is
hard to come to an understanding
before that gap is bridged.
When a group expresses emo
tions like those evident in the flier,
something is not right within the
Stanford community. We need to
ask: Why do certain populations still
feel oppressed and discriminated
against?
The feelings of oppression that
caused the Omega Psi Phis to pro
duce such a flier cannot simply be
passed off as irrelevant. Clearly there
is a lack of understanding between
peoples, a lack that calls out for dia
logue to remedy it.
