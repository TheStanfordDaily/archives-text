ASSU budget recommendation ignores student wishes

ON OCT. 8, THE ASSU SENATE
passed a final budget recommen
dation that stated: "While public
service offers an important educational
experience, support for the Haas Center
should not be maintained at a cost to the
University's core academic and research
programs."
Ironically, the initial recommendation
stated, "The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, inter alia (among others), should be
maintained."
On what basis did the ASSU Senate
make their recommendation? Surely not
from opinions expressed at either of the
ASSU town meetings during which not a
single student spoke out against the con
tinued support of the public service cen

ter. In fact, several students submitted
written comments in favor of public ser
vice and Haas.
Clearly, the ASSU's final recommen
dation does not represent student opin
ion, especially the opinions of the 70 per
cent of Stanford students who partici
pate in community service. Each year
over 2,000 students contribute close to
67,000 volunteer hours through Haas
programs.
In addition to providing a wealth of
local, national and international infor
mation about service opportunities
through its clearinghouse, Haas provides
a needed framework for students to par
ticipate in organized public service.
Haas houses both direct service and

advocacy organizations which deal with
issues at the local, national and inter
national level. Haas has received
national recognition for its unique abili
ty to provide students with the oppor
tunity to connect scholarship, service
and community participation. In the
past, students actively involved in pub
lic service through Haas have had dis
tinguished careers as Rhodes, Truman
and Marshall Scholars in addition to
receiving University recognition for
their efforts.
Public service acts as a bridge
between students' academic pursuits
and the surrounding community. In its
Sept. 5 statement of budget goals, the
Faculty Senate Committee on Education

and Scholarship at Stanford acknowl
edged the importance of public service to
Stanford, saying, "Stanford educates its
students to live thoughtfully and coura
geously in a plural and an ethically
diverse society. We wish our students to
value and contribute to public service."
The ASSU recommendations suggest
public service is an extracurricular activ
ity peripheral to a Stanford education.
We believe public service not only edu
cates students to become responsible cit
izens, but also helps them realize they
can use their knowledge to have a real
impact on today's problems.
