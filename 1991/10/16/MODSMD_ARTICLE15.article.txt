# Statutory rape charge is a convenient choice by district attorney
## 
### 
Stuart Thomas could and should have
been tried on a forcible rape charge in the
Casa Zapata incident, as the investigator
recommended. California penal code 261.3
defines rape as sexual intercourse "where
the person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxicating substance administered
by or with the privity of the accused."
When people hear the term "forcible
rape" they tend to picture either vio
lence being involved or overt resistance
on the part of the victim. However, the
whole point of this statute is that intoxi
cation is an unacceptable way to gain
consent; getting a woman drunk to have
sex with her is forcible rape.
Historically, women have been taken
advantage of when drunk â€” especially
younger women with older men, as was
the case in this incident. This law estab
lishes that using alcohol as a means of
sexual coercion is condemnable. If sex is

consensual, a woman will agree in a
clear-minded, fully conscious state.
District attorneys like to win, and it's
much easier to prove statutory rape or
provision of alcohol to a minor, when
age is an incontrovertible factor. Howev
er, the importance of the penal code
should not be obscured by the D.A.'s
failure to apply it in this instance.
Hopefully, the law's relevance to the
Zapata incident can still serve to raise
awareness in the Stanford community that
sex under the influence can easily be rape.
