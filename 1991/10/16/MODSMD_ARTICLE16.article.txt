# Criticism of gay-rights protesters belittles the gravity of their plight
## 
### 
Of the possible reactions to the
demonstration at our final Centennial
Convocation, mine has been one of sup
port mingled with sadness. Two succes
sive governors have ignored the price

individuals and society pay for legalized
bigotry aimed at homosexuals in the
workplace. And the timing of Gov. Pete
Wilson's veto of Assembly Bill 101
marred for the Stanford family an
opportunity to come together to begin
healing other wounds shared by us all.
Stanford is a community that under
stands that not all men and women are
heterosexual. Stanford is also a commu
nity trying earnestly to understand and
appreciate the full range of human dif
ferences. It is important for each of us to
try hard to fathom the behavior of the
demonstrators.
Lofty conceptions of free speech are
fine for those of us in good health, who
enjoy some financial security. My own
inclination was to listen politely to Wil
son, avoiding applause, then fire off a
letter to Sacramento.
Unfortunately, many who came on
that Tuesday to protest are a lot more
vulnerable than most of us. Absent a sci
entific breakthrough, some are living on
borrowed time because of the HIV virus.
Not a few demonstrators surely work in
places less hospitable to human differ
ences than Stanford, so that regardless

of the threat of AIDS, they face econom
ic insecurity that AB 101 could have
ameliorated.
Imagining myself in one or both of
these situations helped me to appreciate
how a demonstrator might conquer fear,
harness despair and risk the conse
quences of shouting down Wilson.
