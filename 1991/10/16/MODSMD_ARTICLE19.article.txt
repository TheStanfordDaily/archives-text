## Desperately seeking 'man' 
### 
I HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF
complaints about this "man" fellow
recently. From the bits and pieces I gath
ered, I understood that "man" was a male,
and he was a rather despicable, deplorable,
dishonest and deceitful individual.
"Man" is quite an aggressor. He has a
peculiar fear of one thing, commitment,
and a lack of comprehension of one word,
no. A typical image of him is a slightly over
weight individual buried in a lazy-boy. He
holds a beer in one hand, a remote control
in the other. The sound of "fourth and
inches" emanates from the glaring tube
across the potato-chip-sprayed living room.
In my life, I have heard too many outra
geous claims to just believe. I became curi
ous about how a person with such a perfect
combination of undesirable habits could
exist. I wanted to seek him out, to clear his
name if the charges were false or to expose
his sins if he was indeed so horrible.
As I was proceeding with my investiga
tion, my friend J.C. and his wife came into
town. I remembered he was working for
his wife when I met him in college. She
worked as a researcher at the medical
school, and he basically took care of her
mice. He also did most of the house chores.
I talked to J.C. about my investigation.
This apparently aroused his interest as
well. He offered me his help since he had a
lot of free time while his wife was attend
ing a conference. We figured "man" must
be a rather powerful fellow; otherwise

there wouldn't be so many people talking
about him. He also must hold some special
value, because people seem to be in need of
him despite his flaws.
We first checked the phone book. As
expected, "man" is unlisted.
Being both young and inexperienced,
we decided to seek help from someone who
had seen it all. We thus visited Mr. Single
ton, an elderly gentleman whom I have
always held in high esteem.
As a rash 20-year-old, Mr. Singleton
married an equally naive 18-year-old
brunette. Life was difficult then. He
worked as a construction worker to sup
port her through college. After she gradu
ated, he went back to school with her sup
port. Through depression and adversity,
the Singletons have stayed together for
more than 50 years.
J.C. and I talked to Mr. Singleton about
our investigation. He did not recall anyone
by that name. I was rather disappointed
that an individual of Mr. Singleton's expe
rience could not give us even a hint of
where we could proceed next.
After we got back, my answering
machine informed me that my friend Eric
had just gotten dumped. I decided to put
aside my investigation temporarily and
went to console him.
Apparently, Eric's now ex-girlfriend
had rediscovered the sensitive side
beneath the macho exterior of the football
player she used to date. So someone who

could only make her laugh was no longer
good enough. I thought giving Eric some
thing to do would take his mind off her, so
I persuaded him to join our search.
One day, Eric suggested that we should
look at higher places since "man" was such
a powerful figure. J.C. and I both agreed.
Before embarking on this journey, I decid
ed to host a dinner party so we could reaf
firm our determination.
For the main course, I was going to
serve Osso-Bucco. In order to obtain fresh
veal, I went to this upscale gourmet shop.
In front of the organically grown tomato, I
overheard sporadic references to "man." I
was elated. They must know "man."
They seemed to be talking quite pas
sionately, so I didn't disturb them right
away. As they calmed down, I politely
approached them and asked who the
"man" was. They turned toward me,
raised their eyelashes and stared at me as
if I were the infamous "man." I was scared
and threw up my veal in the air and ran
out of the store.
Thank God my name was not "man."
