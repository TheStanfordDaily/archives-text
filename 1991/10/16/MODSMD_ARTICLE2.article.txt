# Conduct cases take a tumble

### Johnny Sun 
Misconduct charges against students last year
decreased substantially from the previous year,
according to a report released yesterday by the Judi
cial Affairs Office.
Twenty-eight charges of misconduct were issued
last year by Judicial Affairs, as compared to 49 cases
in 1989-90.
Last year's totals were the lowest in the past five
years. The highest number of cases was 71 in 1988-89,
when students took over University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
Honor Code violations comprised 20 of the 1990-91
charges, a figure that has remained fairly consistent
from year to year.
But a survey on academic honesty taken last fall by
Donald McCabe, a professor of business ethics at Rut
gers University, indicated that many Honor Code vio
lations may go unreported each year. Fifteen percent
of Stanford seniors surveyed said they had copied
another student's exam answers without the person's
knowledge, and 37 percent had seen another student
cheating.
Heading the list of Honor Code violations last year
were unsanctioned collaboration and plagiarism. Over
half of these charges surfaced in the School of Engi
neering. The majority of Honor Code violators — 17
out of 20 — were male.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson expressed con
cern over the percentage of student cheating. "I
always want students to live up to the high standards
of the Honor Code," Jackson said. "I hope students
would think before they cheat and resist all situations
which would push them to cheat."
Fundamental Standard violations decreased from
17 charges in 1989-90 to 8 charges last year. The
