# Conduct cases take a tumble
## 
### Johnny Sun 
Misconduct charges against students last year
decreased substantially from the previous year,
according to a report released yesterday by the Judi
cial Affairs Office.
Twenty-eight charges of misconduct were issued
last year by Judicial Affairs, as compared to 49 cases
in 1989-90.
Last year's totals were the lowest in the past five
years. The highest number of cases was 71 in 1988-89,
when students took over University President Donald
Kennedy's office.
Honor Code violations comprised 20 of the 1990-91
charges, a figure that has remained fairly consistent
from year to year.
But a survey on academic honesty taken last fall by
Donald McCabe, a professor of business ethics at Rut
gers University, indicated that many Honor Code vio
lations may go unreported each year. Fifteen percent
of Stanford seniors surveyed said they had copied
another student's exam answers without the person's
knowledge, and 37 percent had seen another student
cheating.
Heading the list of Honor Code violations last year
were unsanctioned collaboration and plagiarism. Over
half of these charges surfaced in the School of Engi
neering. The majority of Honor Code violators — 17
out of 20 — were male.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson expressed con
cern over the percentage of student cheating. "I
always want students to live up to the high standards
of the Honor Code," Jackson said. "I hope students
would think before they cheat and resist all situations
which would push them to cheat."
Fundamental Standard violations decreased from
17 charges in 1989-90 to 8 charges last year. The
attention given to the Fundamental Standard during
New Student Orientation and resident assistant
training may have made the dif
ference, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Fundamental Standard viola
tions last year included physical
assault, drunk driving, harassing
telephone calls, property theft
and false allegations.
An unacceptable sexual con
duct charge was filed but was
later dismissed due to insufficient
evidence.
The Fundamental Standard
Interpretation of Free Expression
and Discriminatory Harassment
became effective June, 1990, but
no charges under it have come to
the attention of Judicial Affairs to
date. The interpretation bars ver
bal harassment that, using "fight
ing words," discriminates against
an individual or small group of
individuals.
"I think the debate [over the
Fundamental Standard interpre
tation] certainly sharpened every
body's awareness and heightened
sensitivity over the issues," Cole
said.
No violations of the Campus
Disruption Policy occurred last
year. In fact, the only charges
filed under that policy in the past

five years were those against 53
students after the May 1989
takeover of Kennedy's office.
Jackson downplayed the
importance of the 1990-91 report
on misconduct because he said it
does not express a significant
long-term trend. Instead, he said
he gives more weight to the aca
demic honesty survey, which
compared student responses from
1961, 1976, 1980 and 1990.
"With that, you have a better
indication of student attitudes
over time," Jackson said.
Cole said the fact that only 20
Honor Code violations were
charged does not mean students
are shirking their responsibility to
report others under the Honor
Code. "The obligation of the stu
dent is not necessarily to report
the student, but to address the
issue," which sometimes means
approaching the offender, she said.
Many of the complaints and
questions brought to the Judicial
Affairs Office each year do not
result in charges being filed.
"Sometimes it's an issue of evi
dence, and sometimes there are
better ways to approach the prob
lem," Cole said.
Jackson praised the judicial
process, saying, "We have a very
responsive judicial system, one of
the best in the nation. It ... tries
to be fair to the students."
