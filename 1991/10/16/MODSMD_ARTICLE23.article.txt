## Former monk to head scientific inquiry into meditating mind 
### Catherine Ivey 
It is well known that Stanford's research
touches many far away places. Add the minds
of Tibetan monks to this list, under a new
project headed by graduate student Alan Wal
lace called the "Mind and Light Research Pro
ject Network."
Wallace, a doctoral candidate in religious
studies, is planning a study of the shifts in
brain activity that occur during deep states of
concentration. The studies will specifically
investigate Tibetan yogi (monk) meditative
practices and could uncover relaxation tech
niques helpful for stressed-out Westerners.
Native to California, Wallace first became
interested in Buddhism and Tibetan culture
through a faculty member when he was
abroad in Europe during his junior year in
college. He "stopped out" of his Western life
and immersed himself in the Tibetan
lifestyle.
For fourteen years, Wallace was a practic
ing Tibetan monk. In 1981, after travels to
India, Switzerland and Asia, he returned to
the United States, studied quantum physics
from a Buddhist philosophical perspective
and finished his undergraduate education at
Amherst College. In 1989, Wallace joined the
department of religious studies at Stanford.
Currently, he is working on his doctoral the
sis on Buddhism and science.
Wallace's interest in Buddhism and sci
ence can be traced to his experiences as a
monk and to his role as the Dalai Lama's
translator during a series of conferences
begun in 1987. The conferences, entitled
"Mind and Light" were headed by the Dalai

Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of the
Tibetan people and world-renowned advocate
of humanitarian causes.
These conferences, which focused on the
relationship between meditative states and
physiological processes, were attended by
many prominent western leaders, and scien
tists, psychologists and philosophers. In
1990, Wallace decided to establish a formal
organization for such study, the Mind and
Light Research Network.
The network, which is currently funded by
a grant from the Fetzer Institute, is com
prised of Wallace, three neuroscientists and
one psychobiologist. The first project the
team has planned is a scientific study of med
itation. In this study, Wallace wants to deter
mine whether under states of intense concen
tration, physical changes occur in the brain.
To determine this, electrodes will be
applied to Tibetan yogis' scalps as they medi
tate to monitor the electrical activity of their
brains. This activity will be recorded by an
electroencephalogram and compared to the
electrical potentials found in the "normal"
state of consciousness.
Although he is convinced there are tangi
ble differences in brain activity during medi
tation, Wallace hopes to establish this scien
tifically to the Western world.
In Wallace's eyes, meditation has not
received the respect of the scientific commu
nity. He hopes that by establishing tangible
levels of activity, or "brain correlates" of
meditation, it will gain credibility.
Wallace believes there are three primary
applications of meditation which could be
introduced to the western world.

First, an individual's physical and mental
health could benefit from the techniques of
the monks. Applying the relaxation, atten
tional stability and enhanced clarity benefits
of meditation would be "an anecdote for anx
iety, compulsive fabrications and conception
al elaborations that are problematic in (this)
society," says Wallace.
Second, Wallace believes meditation cat
alyzes memories, emotions and images from
their dormant state. He thinks it would be
feasible to join the meditative practice with
psychotherapy, thereby "bringing these
images into consciousness in order to resolve
them."
And third, Wallace envisions educational
applications, particularly for students and
teachers. Through "attentional training,"
students and teachers could perhaps train
their minds to be more efficient and focused.
The project, which will take place in the
Himalayas, is expected to take two to three
years. Wallace has already received full sup
port and commendation from the Dalai
Lama, who will help secure the participation
and cooperation of Tibetan monks.
The research group has plans to conduct
future studies if they are successful in their
study on meditation. One that Wallace
believes will be of particular interest to Amer
icans would compare post-traumatic stress
disorder in the United States and Tibet.
Until the projects become finalized, Wal
lace will continue to work on his dissertation
on Buddhism and science. In addition, he
hopes to teach an Innovative Academic
Course on the culture and religion of Tibet
next quarter.
