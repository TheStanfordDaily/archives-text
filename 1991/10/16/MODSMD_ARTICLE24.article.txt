# SLAC's B-factory proposal alive and well, despite recent reports
## 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Despite recent negative-sounding
reports that a Department of Energy
(DOE) panel has recommended "defer
ring" funding for the proposed "B-fac
tory," Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center officials remain optimistic the
$200 million facility will be built.
Late last month, a 15-member com
mittee of eminent academic, industrial
and federal scientists convened to help
DOE's Office of Energy Research
(OER) set its long term research prior
ities. Several magazines, including Sci
ence, reported the panel agreed to
"defer" funding for SLAC's B-factory
proposal, along with a $181 million
main injector for Fermilab's Tevatron
accelerator, until another panel,
HEPAP (High Energy Physics Adviso
ry Panel) ranks the importance of these
initiatives against that of other pro
grams.
According to Physics Prof. Stanley
Wojcicki, the panel's recommendation
does not spell doomsday for the B-fac
tory. Rather, it pushes back the antici
pated time frame for the project. Wojci
cki is a member of the OER committee
and the chairman of HEPAP.
"Deferred is not a very accurate
statement," says Wojcicki. "I don't
believe that the project would have
been ready to go for fiscal year 1993
anyhow."
Earlier this year, officials at SLAC
had been quite optimistic the B-factory

would receive funding in fiscal year
1993. However, since that time, "guide
lines for funding have become more
stringent," according to Prof. Jonathan
Dorfan, SLAC faculty member and
chairman of the B-factory project.
Elliott Bloom, SLAC faculty mem
ber, actually sees the panel's recom
mendation as a step forward for the
project.
"Unlike the Fermilab proposal, the
B-factory was never formally funded,"
said Bloom. "This recommendation, in
effect, takes money away from Fermi
lab's proposal, which may (in turn) be
used for the B-factory. If anything, it
puts the two projects on more even
ground."
Bill Kirk, assistant to the director of
SLAC, conferred with Wojcicki.
"I don't think that it's important if
it gets funded by fiscal year 1993 or '94,
but rather that it gets funded," says
Kirk. "We'd like to see it funded for fis
cal year '94."
Dorfan, in contrast, remains opti
mistic about fiscal year 1993.
"I don't think it's a closed issue for
the '93 budget," said Dorfan. "I don't
think all of us have given up hope for
'93. I prefer to take a wait-and-see atti
tude."
Nevertheless, Kirk, Wojcicki and
Dorfan acknowledged federal research
funds, in general, are scarce.
"The funding caps that are now pro
posed will force all labs to become non
productive," according to Dorfan.
"There has to be some rethinking of

these caps."
Inspite of cuts in the national
research budget, Wojcicki is optimistic
about future B-factory funding. "Flat
budgets are projected until 1996 due to
spending caps, but it's unlikely these
caps will hold through 1996," says Woj
cicki. "Caps on domestic programs may
be relaxed if there are savings from
other areas."
In addition to competing with the
Fermilab project for DOE funds,
SLAC's B-factory is also competing
against a similar B-factory proposal by
Cornell University. Unlike SLAC's B
factory, which is seeking DOE funds,
Cornell's factory would be funded by
the National Science Foundation
(NSF).
"HEPAP will be recommending
whether there should be a B-factory at
all," according to Kirk. "If they do (rec
ommend that a B-factory is a priority),
then it becomes a question of which one
(Cornell's or SLAC's)."
"The fact that [the OER committee]
did not completely remove the B-facto
ry from the table is significant," says
Dorfan. "The B-factory (proposal) has
made great inroads in the scientific
community. People are convinced of its
worth."
Dorfan does not believe the Cornell
proposal has any advantages over Stan
ford's. "I think the funding at NSF is
just as difficult (as at DOE)," said Dor
fan.
HEPAP's meeting is scheduled for
Oct. 28-29.
