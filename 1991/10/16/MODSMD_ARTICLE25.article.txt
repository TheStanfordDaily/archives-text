A # Armpit odor is the bane of
• modern society. Americans
spend more than $1 billion each
year to control this social stigma.
Your armpits (or, if you want
to be ultracool and use the medi
cal term for armpits — axillary
vaults) possess 50,000 eccrine
glands. These glands cool your
body by discharging a salty, odor
less fluid. The evaporation of this
fluid dissipates body heat. In hot,
humid weather, the sweat from
your armpits would fill a Pepsi
can in less than a day.
If you had only eccrine glands,
which are found all over your
body, you could keep cool without
any 8.0. Unfortunately, the
secretions of the less numerous
apocrine glands, which are only
found in areas associated with
8.0., make great food for the bac
teria that live on your skin. Com
bine bacteria, a food source and a
warm moist environment and you
have either a compost heap or an
armpit.
All antiperspirants contain
aluminum salts. The aluminum
forms an insoluble plug in the
eccrine gland that blocks the flow
of sweat. Reducing perspiration
reduces moisture which means
fewer bacteria, less feeding and,
therefore, less smell. Deodorants
are not antiperspirants and only
mask the smell.
And how are antiperspirants
evaluated for efficacy? Antiper
spirant manufacturers employ
professional axillary vault snif-

fers. Add this to "McDonald's Fry
Cook" as one more reason to fin

S t This summer I was
.employed as a lifeguard,
ough achieving a perfect state
ofbronzeness, my coworkers and I
were unable to provide an expla
nation for a common pool occur
rence. Why, when a swimming
kickboard is placed at the bottom
of a pool, does it rise to the top in
a zigzag pattern? We thought it
had to do with the shape of the
board, but a submerged pingpong
ball does the same.
A # I hope you used sunscreen
lon your way to perfect
bronzitude. Approximately 8,500
Americans will die from skin can
cer this year, and the surest way
to avoid skin cancer is to avoid
sunburn. Sunscreen will not
block all the cancer-causing rays
that reach your skin, but it's
much, much better than nothing.
Regarding your pool happen
ing, the movement of any object
through water does in fact

depend on its shape. Engineers
go to much trouble to design
submarines and missiles that
will disturb the surrounding
water less and thus travel more
smoothly.
What you and your fellow life
guards observed was most likely
an effect of wake turbulence.
The turbulence or vortex created
below the kickboard sends the
kickboard catawampous off a
straight path.
Boil some water and see for
yourself that even gas bubbles
sometimes rise along a zigzag or
spiral path. The exact path
depends on the bubbles' size and
shape.
Physicists have observed the
wake turbulence in these bub
bles by injecting them with dye
and filming their ascent through
liquid. The water soluble dye dif
fuses out of the bubble and
swirls in the wake below the bub
ble. I wonder how many physi
cists end up in a rubber room
after a lifetime of injecting teeny
weeny bubbles with dye.
Fish that swim in schools use
vortices wisely. Watch a school of
fish and you will see that none of
the trailing fish swim directly
behind their leaders. A trailer
will swim behind the space in
between two leaders. These
smart fish avoid swimming
against the turbulent wake
behind the leader and simultane
ously are helped by vortices mov
ing in the forward direction.
If any of you are the look-out
for-number-one type, you'll be
glad to know you can use the vor
tices of others to your own
advantage, too. Next time you're
out cycling with a group you can
ease off the pedals and "draft"
off the bike in front of you.
