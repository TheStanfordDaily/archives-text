# B-factory would allow scientists to observe matter-antimatter imbalance in universe

The Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter's proposed B-factory would allow
researchers to investigate the imbalance
between matter and antimatter in the uni
verse.
According to the standard model of
what happened when the universe formed,
less than one-millionth of a second after
the Big Bang, matter and antimatter exist
ed in equal amounts. In the following rapid
expansion of the universe, most particles
found their antiparticles, and the pairs
annihilated.
"The standard model description of
what happened when the Big Bang
occurred is entirely matter-antimatter
symmetric," explains Prof. Jonathan Dor
fan, SI AC faculty member and chair of the
B-factory project. "There should have been
an equal number of particles and antiparti
cles."
A slight flaw in this matter-antimatter
symmetry allowed for a small portion of
matter to survive and form, over time, the
universe that we live in.
"IParticles and antiparticlesl should
have simply annihilated each other, and it's
not obvious why one should have accreted

out a stable universe in which all the stable
elements are made out of matter," said
Dorfan.
SLAC's B-factory is explicitly designed
to explore this asymmetry by investigat
ing the decays of particles known as B
mesons.
To date, the balance between matter
and antimatter has been studied using par
ticles called K-mesons. However, studies of
K-meson systems alone have not answered
all questions about matter and antimatter.
Special properties of B-mesons make them
uniquely suited for these studies.
Because there is no facility optimally
designed to study B-meson decay, SIAC
physicists have proposed modifications to
the existing linear collider that would con
vert SLAC into a B-factory. The B-factory
would retain much of the current SIAC
facility, with the largest change being the
addition of an additional beam storage
ring.
Researchers are hopeful that a B-factory
will help provide a more complete model of
what happened when the universe formed.
In addition, a B-factory may also provide
important information about the accuracy
of current theories of particle interactions.

U.S. Department of Energy.
