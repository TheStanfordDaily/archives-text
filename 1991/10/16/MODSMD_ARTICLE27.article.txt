# Scintillating screens
## Computer Carrier 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
In years past, there were few joys for the
procrastinating student with a paper
due in the morning, except perhaps the
promise of finishing before dawn. Typically,
when eyelids drooped and typing slowed to
a standstill, the Macintosh monitor would
turn black, or maybe a shade of gray, and a
series of white lines would float across the
screen. Few would call the sight enlivening.
But now, with the advent of an appropri
ately named, screen-saver program called
"After Dark" and a bigger and better updat
ed version of it, "After Dark II," gone are
the dull days of rotating geometric lines.
Here to stay are flying toasters.
Writing a marine biology paper? Click on
"Fish," and watch a veritable underwater
bonanza of sylphlike seahorses, prickly
puffers and guileless guppies.
Has philosophy got you stumped? Wit
ness life, death and regeneration in "Mead
ow Flowers," a budding, blooming then fad
ing field of flowers shown throughout the
seasons.
Feeling destructive? Watch your essay
spin around the screen and wash down a
drain. Or see "Mowin' Man" ride his rum-

bling red lawn mower over the once-idyllic
meadow of flowers.
And truly creative types can program
their own screen-saver displays.
Not only do the multitude of screen
choices keep the paper writer entertained
for hours, they also serve a practical pur
pose: burn-out prevention.
Computer screens, like television
screens, are phosphorescent devices. This
means that electron beams shot from
behind the screen cause certain chemical
dyes in it to light up.
If the same formation of electrons zaps
the screen for too long, a chemical change
occurs, and the pattern can be permanent
ly etched into the screen. On the Macin
tosh, the Apple, File and Edit menu mark
ers may burn into the screen, although the
decay usually takes a period of years.
Screen savers alleviate the threat by dis
playing a constantly varying image.
"After Dark II" sells for $29 at the
Bookstore. A less exotic screen-saver pro
gram, "Dark Side of the Mac," can be
obtained for free from the Stanford com
puter network.
