## Time for hoops again — young Card squad hits the boards 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Arizona State held a laser light
show spectacular and California
hosted a midnight "Late Night
with Lou Campanelli," but Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery
yesterday was thinking of base
lines, not headlines, on the first
day of basketball practice.
"Those midnight madness
practices are just a promotion,
and at first they attracted a lot of
attention,"said Montgomery,
entering his sixth season at Stan
ford. "But now everybody does
them, and the media just ignores
them."
The defending National Invi
tation Tournament Champions
officially reconvened court at
Maples Pavilion at 7:30 a.m. with
a no-frills start to another hope
filled hoops season. Seventeen
players practiced the first day,
with seven freshmen and just one
senior, Adam Keefe.
The team practiced again in
the afternoon, and will labor
daily until the exhibition opener
at Roscoe Maples Pavilion,
Wednesday, Oct. 6, at 7:30 p.m.
against High Five America.
Stanford has been ranked No.
24 in a pre-season poll by Street
and Smith, although the Cardi
nal lost four starters from last
year's 20-13 NIT title team.
Montgomery will have many

decisions to make before the start
of the season, beginning with
who to start alongside Keefe and
junior point guard Marcus Lollie.
"We have some veterans, but
not many guys that have been in
there in key situations, taking
the deciding shot in a game, han
dling the pressure," Mont
gomery said.
Sharp-shooting guards John
Patrick (10.3 points per game)
and Kenny Ammann (10.1 ppg.)
are gone, along with forwards
Deshon Wingate (9.3 ppg., 6.8
rebounds) and enforcer Andrew
Vlahov (12.0 ppg., 6.0 reb.).
Wingate is playing professionally
in France, while Vlahov signed a
lucrative multi-year deal with the
Perth Wildcats in the Australian
Professional League.
If the first game were today,
Lollie would start at point guard
next to junior Peter Dukes or
Kenny Hicks, Keefe at power for
ward, 6-foot-l 1-inch sophomore
Jim Morgan at center, and slash
ing 6-foot-6-inch sophomore
Brent Williams at small forward.
Montgomery will be forced to
rely on some new faces if the Car
dinal is to improve on last year's
record, and he would love to be
surprised.
"We're encouraged that some
young players will step up and be
better players than we thought
they would be," Montgomery
said. "We're looking for 10-12

guys who can play tough, and
we'll find out in the first month
to month-and-a-half of the sea
son."
"We'll see who can handle the
homework, being away from
home, at this level of play. The
tough ones will help us, the oth
ers will need a little more time,"
he said.
Stanford will be quicker than
last year and will need to run the
break to create scoring opportu
nities. Defensively, Stanford will
sorely miss Vlahov, and will need
aggressive play and strong
rebounding from Williams and
Morgan.
"My biggest concern is finding
young guys who have never
played to come in and fill key
roles," Montgomery said.
Freshman David Harbour, a 6-
foot-3-inch guard from Camaril
lo, Calif., is a leading candidate to
play in the back-court. He will
compete with freshmen Warren
Gravely and Andy Poppink, red
shirt freshmen Bobby Patton and
sophomore Mike Morris for play
ing time.
New faces along the front line
include 6-foot-9-inch forward
Bart Lammersen, 6-foot-9-inch
forward Todd Manley and 6-foot
7-inch forward Nick Ravn, a red
shirt freshman. Carlos Williams,
a 6-foot-7-inch forward, trans
ferred from Brown and will red
shirt this year.
