# Women still shooting for first in Seattle

### Tish Williams 
Tied for third place individually after two
rounds of the Washington Intercollegiate,
Stanford women's golf team members Adele
Moore and defending champ Audrey Wooding
have a unique way of keeping themselves
motivated.
"Audrey and I played with a little side bet
going," said senior Adele Moore, playing in
her first tournament of the year after missing
last week's competition in Arizona.
"We focussed on each individual shot,"
Moore said, "and golf is a game in which you
get rewarded for each good shot you make."
Stanford stands in third place entering the
third and final round of the tournament with
617 strokes, twelve behind second place USC.
The team picked up strokes Tuesday with 306,
bettering Monday's score of 311.
Coach Baldwin attributed the improve
ment to a better contribution from Melinda
Daniels, Martha Richards and Amy Lawrence
— Stanford's third, fourth and fifth players,

respectively.
"I think Adele and Audrey should be
applauded for being in third place," Baldwin
said.
Wooding closed the gap on Moore, scoring
75 on Monday and 73 on Tuesday, putting her
in seventh place. Moore ended the first day in
second place with 72 and finished on Tuesday
with 76.
Daniels bettered her position by five places
on Tuesday, finishing in twentieth place with
an 80 and 78 two-day performance. Richards
and Lawrence both took five stroke jumps on
the second day of play, with Richards shooting
an 84 and 79 and Lawrence finishing on Tues
day with 85 and 80. Richards now stands in
34th place while Lawrence is in 38th.
Washington's course is one of the highest
rated courses Stanford plays during the sea
son.
"It requires you to think about every indi
vidual shot," Moore said, "and in turn makes
you hit better shots. It's very narrow with a
lot of trees."

"The kid's are really having a time with
this course," Baldwin said, "it's in beautiful
condition and the weather's glorious, but it's a
difficult course."
"We had a much better balanced team
effort today," Baldwin said of Tuesday's com
petition. He expects the Cardinal to improve
even further today in the tournament's final
round.
The weather in Seattle is sunny and in the
mid-70's, instead of the usual cold, rainy
weather expected for the tournament.
Stanford will not, most likely, successfully
defend last year's team championship, with
Arizona 32 shots ahead after two rounds.
"The University of Arizona is awfully
tough. They're like a national or a semi-pro
fessional team," Baldwin said, "but the sea
son is just starting, and I look forward to us
being very competitive with them towards the
end."
