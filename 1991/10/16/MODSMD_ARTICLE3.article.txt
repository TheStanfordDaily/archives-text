# Thomas wins Court seat, but some predict backlash
## 
### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
The emotionally charged
debate on the nomination of
Clarence Thomas to the U.S.
Supreme Court ended yesterday
with a 52-48 confirmation vote by
the U.S. Senate.
But the Senate's nod to
Thomas, the 106 th associate jus
tice to be named to the nation's
highest court, has ignited contro
versy across the nation and at
Stanford among those who saw
the past four days as a blow to
women's rights.
"There's going to be tremen
dous backlash in the next few
weeks," Dr. Frances Conley of the
School of Medicine told The Asso
ciated Press. Conley, one of the
nation's first female brain sur
geons, gained national attention
for exposing sexual harassment at
the Medical School.
"Women's issues in this
regard are again going to be trivi
alized to an incredible extent,"
she said. "Women are going to
retreat into silence."
Robert Burns, a political sci
ence professor at South Dakota

State University, disagreed,
telling the AP the confirmation
hearings raised awareness of sex
ual harassment to a new level.
"I think men will certainly be
much more conscious of sexual
harassment in the workplace, and
I would expect women to actually
be more prepared to blow the
whistle when sexual harassment
in the workplace occurs," Burns
said.
This weekend's controversy
arose after Anita Hill, a professor
of law at the University of Okla
homa, came forth with accusa
tions that Thomas sexually
harassed her when they both
worked at the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
Stanford Law Prof. Kim Tay
lor, a friend of Hill's since both
attended law school at Yale in the
late 19705, told The Daily she did
not appreciate the "mudslinging"
and "accusations without facts"
that Hill faced in hearings before
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"This will clearly have a detri
mental impact on women who
want to pursue claims of sexual
harassment," Taylor said. "Sexu
al harassment will continue in the

workplace, and it has the U.S.
Senate stamp of approval."
Taylor said the hearing and
confirmation fomented a sense of
betrayal in both men and women
because the issue of harassment
was not fully resolved. "It became
a public spectacle. The promise
that the trial would be a real
attempt to determine the facts
was broken," she said.
"This political bread-and-cir
cus event ... has not been
Congress' finest hour," agreed
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode. She
said the attempts to discredit Hill
exhibited the ineptitude and
insensitivity of Congress and
"run counter to what we know as
the seriousness of sexual harass
ment in the workplace."
Rhode added that the confir
mation highlights the textbook
victimization of women by the
legal system that extends into
other areas such as sexual abuse
and rape.
The hearings did, however,
raise public awareness to the issue
of sexual harassment. Rhode said
Thomas' derailment, though only
temporary, was progress from past
decades, when the issue might
have been dismissed altogether.
"Women suffered sexual harass
ment for years only to put their
careers at risk," she said. "Now it is
apparent that men who aspire to
public office have to worry as well."
Some found a positive strand in
Thomas' confirmation. Law Prof.
Thomas Grey, who testified before
the Senate against Thomas in
September, said, "It's good to have
an African-American on the court."

But Grey added Thomas has
only basic qualifications for the
job and that other candidates
with more experience on the fed
eral bench were available. In his
testimony to the Senate last
month, Grey criticized Thomas as
a "vociferous proponent of Rea
gan policies."
Grey said the hearings were a
dark day for women, particularly
regarding the accusations against
Hill, who was called a "disappoint
ed woman" and was said to have
"delusions" during the process.
"What possible message could
this have for women out there who
have been harassed except for one
— 'Shut up' ?" Grey asked.
Thomas is not the only justice to
weather a rough confirmation. In
1916, Louis Brandeis, a progres
sive Jewish lawyer, was challenged
by an ultra-conservative Senate. In
the late 1930s Hugo Black faced
charges of Ku Klux Klan involve
ment in his youth. Both men were
confirmed as justices.
