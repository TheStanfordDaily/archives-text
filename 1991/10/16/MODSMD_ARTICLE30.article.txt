# Stanford men receive an 'A' for average
## Despite breaking tournament record golfers grab third place at Pacific 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
There seems to be a different attitude floating
among the members of the Cardinal men's golf team
nowadays. With a national ranking of 10 and a vic
tory under their belts in their first tournament last
week, they don't like to lose, not to mention be
upended.
Yesterday the linksters concluded the two-day,
54-hole Robertson Homes Invitational at the Uni
versity of Pacific in Stockton breaking the tourna
ment record along with Oregon and San Jose St.
"For three teams to break the record says a lot
about golf in the West," said coach Wally Goodwin.
But Oregon essentially walked away with the
tournament when it shot a collective two-under-par
533 in the first two rounds Monday, leaving San
Jose St., Fresno St.and the Cardinal to fight among
themselves for the runner-up slot.
The Cardinal blew past Fresno St., with whom it
was tied for third with 559 alter 36 holes, but was
unable to overcome the Spartans three-stroke lead
in the final round yesterday, being nipped by one
stroke to finish in third with 846. Oregon recorded
an 828, altering the former tournament mark by 19
strokes.
The combination of Notah Begay's 207, third indi
vidually, Christian Cevaer's 212, Casey Martin's 215
and Mike Milliken's 217 is the lowest four-man score
in Goodwin's five-year span as coach on The Farm.
"I'm not much of a historian, but 1 think that that
total may be the lowest ever in the history of men's
golf here," Goodwin said.
Despite Goodwin's optimism and praises for his
team, the golfers themselves were not particularly
upbeat.
"We played fair," said Begay, who was in con
tention for the individual title up until the final hole
before Mike Aldrich of Oregon emerged as the win
ner with a 205. "We each had a couple of good
rounds and that's about all."
"I'm not happy; I'm emotionally even after this
tournament," Cevaer said. "W T e started the tourna
ment out bad and Oregon just blew everyone away."
After shooting a 69 and a 67 Monday to put him
self in fourth place individually, Cevaer had a 76 yes
terday to finish out of the pack
"I got off on the wrong track yesterday and I
needed too many birdies to get back into it,"he said.
Martin rebounded from a 76 and in the final 36
holes shot a 68 and then an even par 71 to pull him
self out of a little slump that began last week in
Washington.
"I was playing poorly, and I was wondering what
was wrong," Martin said. "It was a mental thing,
and now I'm feeling a little bit more confident."
Dave Rutkowski, the Cardinal's fifth man, had
his scores count in two rounds as he shot a 73, 72
and 77. "That was typical Dave Rutkowski," Good
win said.
