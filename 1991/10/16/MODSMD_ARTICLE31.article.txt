# No excuses: Roadtrip required on Saturday
## 
### 
I really shouldn't roadtrip
down to Los Angeles for the
football game against USC
and the volleyball game against
UCLA this weekend — or so I
keep telling myself. I keep
thinking of all the disruption it
will cause in my life, but
instinctively I want to go. And
hopefully you will as well after
reading this column.
(Oh-so-subtle subliminal mes
sage: You want to go on this
road trip).

Yes, you'll probably get
behind in your classes, since
it's highly unlikely that you'll
be able to do any work in the
car or that you'll want to do
any work at the games. Better
to not bring any work at all —
you'll only be worrying about
it and ruining the great time
you could be having.
And you can catch up on
work — just pull an all-nighter
when you get back. Sleep is
overrated anyway.
A well-planned trip should
cost you about 25 or 30 bucks.
That's not a negligible amount
of money, but it's not that
much more than dinner and a
movie either. If you can swing
it financially, you should defi
nitely go; you'll get a lot of
entertainment for your dollar.
The Trojan football team
and the Bruin women's volley
ball team have been beating up
on Stanford for years, especial
ly down in Los Angeles, where
both are usually twice as
tough. But this year, the Car
dinal has a legitimate chance
for an L.A. sweep.
Sure, Denny Green and his
charges have had their
problems this year, but
so have Larry Smith and the
Men of Troy. Their two losses
were to Memphis State (who?)
and Arizona State and both
games were at home. The Car
dinal showed in the Colorado
game that it can play big time
football against a big time
opponent. This game can turn
the season around for Stan
ford and every player on the
team knows it. They should be
ready to beat USC.
The Cardinal's women's
volleyball team should be
ready to destroy UCLA. In the
past couple of years, the Bru
ins have almost single-handed
ly prevented Stanford from
winning the national champi
onship. This year, the Cardi
nal is ranked No. 1, and the
Bruins have been having their
problems of late. UCLA has

lost one key player to injury,
has benched another for poor
play and is clearly feeling the
pressure of being defending
national champions. For the
Stanford women, it's payback
time.
And it's O.K. if both Cardi
nal teams lose. You'll still get
to drive home on a deserted
highway at two in the morn
ing, and you can sing along
with your friends to your
favorite tunes with the win
dows wide open. But most
importantly, you can get away
from here for a day, and not
deal with classwork or food
service or how you can't get a
date. For one day, you can just
relax.
If I haven't convinced you
yet that this trip is worth it, let
me give it one more shot. I'll
tell you the real reason that I'm
going.
Quite frankly, I never do
wild and crazy stuff like this
anymore. After two years here,
I've gotten entrenched in my
normal rituals, and I'm fight
ing with myself to break my
patterns. It's so much easier for
me to convince myself why a
trip like this is too much trou
ble than for me to just say what
the hell and do it.
I never want to look back on
opportunities like this with
regret and ask, "What if I had
gone?" I'm afraid of missing
chances here that I'll never
have again because I'm worry
ing about getting all my work
done. I'm on a mission to do
whatever my instincts tell me to
do, and I'M GOING, DAMN IT!
If you want to go, here's
what you should do. Go to
the athletic department
today or tomorrow between 9
a.m. and 4 p.m. and buy a foot
ball ticket ($9). Then call 1-
(213)-UCLA-101 to find out
about the availability and price
of volleyball tickets. If you
don't have a car, ask around —
you probably know someone
who's going.
Leave campus either Friday
night or early Saturday morn
ing, take Interstate 280 south
to Gilroy, then take 152 east
from Gilroy to 1-5 and head
south.
It's funny — for some rea
son I keep thinking about the
Blues Brothers' road trip. I
think that if Jake and Elwood
were in my shoes, they might
say something like this:
It's 400 miles to Los Ange
les.
We've got a full tank of gas.
A six-pack of Jolt.
It's dark.
And we've got papers due on
Monday.
HIT IT.

Noah Blake will leave campus
around 6 p.m. on Friday. Feel
free to follow him down to L.A.,
hut don't tailgate him — he
hates that.
