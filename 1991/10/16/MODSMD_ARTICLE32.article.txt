# Delt house fire could have been prevented, preservationists say
## 
### Christine Dal Bello 
As the investigation into the
cause of the Delta Tau Delta
house fire continues, members of
the Committee for the Preserva
tion of Historic Stanford are
questioning whether it could have
been prevented.
A state fire marshall is expect
ed to begin an investigation today
into the cause of the fire, which
consumed the Delt house early
Friday morning. Arson is suspect
ed in the blaze.
The committee, which has
been working to save the San
Juan Hill houses from demolition
for months, is offering a $1000
reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of an
arsonist.
John Hackmann, the commit
tee's attorney, said the committee
recently voiced its concerns about
the safety of the Delt and Synergy
houses to the University. "We
verbally asked the University to
reconnect the sprinkler and alarm
system," Hackmann said.
Hackmann sent a letter on
Sept. 25 to the University sug
gesting that the weeds inside the
fence around Synergy and the
Delt house be mowed because
they presented a safety risk. In
the letter, Hackmann offered to
have either the committee pay or
provide volunteers for the work.
Herb Fong, manager of
grounds, said that grounds main
tenance workers did not have
access to the areas inside the
fences, so the weeds have not
been mowed since the fences were
installed.
The weeds, said Hackmann,
posed more than a fire risk. "Not
only were the weeds combustible
but they also helped to create the
attitude of 'hit me, hit me,' " said

Hackmann, who speculated that
the weeds and appearance of the
houses may have invited vandal
ism.
The houses, slated for demoli
tion last month, had a temporari
ly reprieve when the committee
forced the University to reapply
for a demolition permit after the
houses were determined histori
cally significant.
"The house had been prepared
for demolition so utilities had
been disconnected," said Keith
Guy, director of housing and food
services.
But to keep the houses secure,
according to Guy, the University,
had assigned a security guard to
the Hill.
"The guard was there to pre
vent people from breaking in and
hurting themselves," said Stan
ford Police Capt. Marvin Moore.
But Moore said that no guard
was on duty at the time of the
fire. Even if a guard had been
there, Moore is not certain that
the fire could have been avoided.
"It was a suspicious fire and I
don't know if it could have been
prevented or not," Moore said.
Guy said he met with Facilities
Project Manager Robert Myers
and Police Chief Marv Herrington
the day before the fire and dis
cussed a plan to reinstall electric
power, security and fire precau
tions.
Precautions have been taken
to avoid further destruction to
the remaining deserted houses.
"Synergy house now has electric
power, a spotlight and smoke/fire
alarms in place," Guy said. "Syn
ergy and Phi Si have also been
boarded up in a stronger way."
The University plans to follow
its original plans regarding the
demolition of Synergy house,
according to Guy.
