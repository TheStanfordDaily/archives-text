# Controversy surrounds charges of statutory rape

### Angie Chuang 
The historically controversial charge of statu
tory rape has been brought into new light by the
alleged Sept. 22 sexual assault involving two
Stanford students.
Junior Stuart Thomas, 23, has been charged
with "unlawful sexual intercourse with a female
under age 18," commonly known as statutory
rape, and providing alcohol to a minor. The
woman is a 17-year-old freshman.
Unlawful sexual intercourse in this instance
is further defined in the California Penal Code as
"an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with
a female not the wife of the perpetrator."
A charge of statutory rape is typically accom
panied by a forcible rape charge, according to
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg.
According to Santa Clara County Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Dale Sanderson, because statu
tory rape is sometimes charged with forcible
rape and is used as a plea bargain, statistics on
the charge do not exist.
"It is impossible to generalize about the fre
quency of the charge," he said. "Each charge is
treated on a case-by-case basis."
Prosecutors often charge both forcible and
statutory rape because "they can win on one
charge, if not the other," according to Weisberg.

In Thomas' case, statutory rape has been
charged, although a forcible rape charge was rec
ommended by Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri.
If the case goes to trial, Weisberg speculated
that "the fact that there may have been some
pretty aggressive conduct [will be] on the jury's
mind," despite the fact forcible rape was not
charged.
Statutory rape is a low-level felony with a
maximum sentence of one year in a state prison.
But "offenders rarely get the maximum sen
tence," Weisberg said. "Theoretically, it is possi
ble to get probation."
"The commonest instances of pure statutory
rape involve a considerably older man in a position
of trust, comparable to child molestation," Weis
berg said. "Obviously, [unreported] statutory rape
exists in consensual romantic relationships, but it
is very rarely found out and enforced."
Rape is a more serious felony, and although
the sentences depend largely on the individual
case, most offenders are sentenced to "a few
years in a state prison," according to Weisberg.
According to the California Penal Code, "lack
of consent remains an element (in statutory
rape), but law makes a conclusive presumption
of lack thereof." The law presumes that a female
under 18 is "too innocent and naive to under

stand the implications and nature of her act,"
according to the Penal Code.
The fact that statutory rape in some states,
including California, can only be charged against
a male has raised questions about the constitu
tionality of the law, and the possibility of sexual
discrimination.
"Classically, the law always says that only a
male can be charged with the crime," Weisberg
says. "But many states have changed their laws
to be gender-neutral."
The U.S. Supreme Court case Michael M. vs.
Superior Court was a challenge to California's
statutory rape law. The defendant claimed sex
discrimination because only men can be prose
cuted for statutory rape.
The court rejected that argument and upheld
the constitutionality of the gender-specific statu
tory rape law. "The court's rationale, which is
not considered logical by many, was the concern
for teenage pregnancy," Weisberg says.
However, Weisberg points out that "almost
every state will have laws ... permitting prosecu
tion of a female by an underage male, such as
contribution to the delinquency of a minor or
unlawful sexual conduct."
Nevertheless, Weisberg said, these "quasi
statutory rape charges are not punished as
severely as statutoiy rape."
