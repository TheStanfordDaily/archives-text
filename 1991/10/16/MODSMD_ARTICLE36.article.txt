# 'Reasonable doubt' standard may fall
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Charges brought against students by the Uni
versity will no longer need to be proved "beyond
a reasonable doubt" if proposed revisions to the
judicial charter, currently under review by sev
eral campus legislative bodies, are implemented.
The proposed amendments to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968 call for the burden
of proof to be lightened, requiring the accuser to
provide only "clear and convincing evidence"
that the accused is guilty.
The amendments were proposed by the Com
mittee of 15, a standing committee chaired by
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode that holds the exclu
sive power of drafting amendments to the Judi
cial Charter.
The amendments include an explicit list of
complainants' rights and require the coopera
tion of both the accused student and student
witnesses. The proposed changes await consid
eration by the Faculty Senate, the ASSU Senate
and University President Donald Kennedy.
Once implemented, the amendments would
be effective immediately, but not retroactively,
according to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Any charges that may result from the alleged
sexual assault reported last month would there
fore be judged using the "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard.
All charges brought against students by the
University would be affected by the proposed
changes. However, they were initially recom
mended by the Sexual Assault Task Force
Report to accommodate the particular sensitivi

ties of sexual assault cases.
The task force wrote that the judicial affairs
officer lacks enough power to garner necessary
testimony and evidence. Unlike the police, Judi
cial Affairs cannot subpoena witnesses.
According to the Committee of 15's report
containing the proposed amendments, "The
judicial affairs officer described barriers to
enforcement resulting from the stringent bur
den of proof and the difficulty in securing coop
eration from some witnesses or students who
are subject to investigation."
The Committee of 15 includes six faculty,
three staff and six student members.
The proposed amendments detailed the
rights of the complainant in student judicial
cases, including the right:
• To be offered reasonable protection from
retaliation, intimidation or harassment in
response to their complaint. This can be accom
plished by guaranteeing prompt University
response to complaints of retaliation;
• To have a person of their choice accompany
them throughout the investigatory and the judi
cial process provided this person will not partic
ipate actively in the process and agrees to the
rules of confidentiality governing student con
duct cases;
• To make a confidential report, to file a
written statement and to retain anonymity
unless they choose to proceed with a formal
complaint. This "allows the judicial affairs offi
cer to identify patterns of offenses and poten
tial avenues for investigation." However, no
anonymous reports may be used as evidence in
formal disciplinary proceedings;

• To be informed of the disposition of their
complaint or the outcome of any abjudicated
formal charge, provided that they agree to keep
the matter confidential.
In cases of sexual misconduct, the Commit
tee of 15 proposes that the complainant should
receive additional insurance that:
• Evidence of her sexual history shall not be
admissible unless a hearing officer at the fact
finding hearing makes a specific finding of rele
vance according to the rules of evidence. This
proposal is intended to prevent needlessly intru
sive inquiries into the complainant's prior inti
mate relationships;
• She has the privilege not to disclose or to
have disclosed any confidential communication
made to the person who accompanies her
throughout the judiciary process, or to any Uni
versity employee whose official functions
include counseling students or responding to
sexual assaults.
These proposed rules are intended to prevent
the violation many college women report feeling
during the judiciary process when they report a
sexual assault case. According to the committee,
"Studies of college date rape procedures reveal
that many women students feel victimized
twice; first by the sexual assault, and again by
the process of trying to do something about it."
The committee of 15 finished drafting the
amendments this summer and submitted them
to the Faculty Senate, ASSU Senate and
Kennedy for approval Aug. 22. The Faculty Sen
ate will probably debate the amendments early
in November, according to Asst. Academic Sec
retary Trish Del Pozzo.
