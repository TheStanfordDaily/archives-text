# Grad students express concern over cuts
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Graduate students voiced
their concerns about upcoming
budget cuts to representatives
from the committees involved in
the process at an open forum last
night.
The University Cabinet will set
budget-reduction targets for
schools and administrative areas
in a meeting tomorrow, continu
ing the year-long process of cut
ting the operating budget by
approximately 10 percent.
Participants at the forum,
which drew more than 30 gradu
ate students, included Biology
Prof. Patricia Jones, deputy chair
of the Faculty Senate Committee
on Education and Scholarship at
Stanford and English Prof. Her

bert Lindenberger, chair of the
faculty senate committee's task
force on graduate and profession
al education.
Several issues raised at the
Rains House forum had not been
discussed at either of the previous
ASSU "town meetings" and,
according to Jones, had not been
considered by the budget deci
sion-makers, either.
Many graduate students
expressed concerns about the idea
of increasing their numbers in cer
tain departments, a proposal con
sidered by Lindenberger's task
force to improve areas that lack a
"critical mass" and potentially
generate more revenue.
But several students said fin
ishing a doctorate program might
be more difficult if more students
were added without an increased

number of graduate-level classes.
Some departments already face
overcrowded graduate seminars,
students said.
A related idea was to have grad
uate students teach more classes
in place of lecturers who might not
be rehired to save money. ,
"The purpose of a Ph.D. pro
gram is to give out Ph.D.s, but
students will have to stick around
if they are forced to teach more
classes," one student said. "Provi
sions have to made to help gradu
ate students get out."
Lindenberger agreed, but said
Stanford "might be more inclined
to look after the needs of its own
graduate students instead of lec
turers," many of whom are still
completing doctorate theses from
other universities.
A new concern raised was that

admitting more graduate stu
dents — including additional mas
ter's candidates in certain depart
ments — would worsen the grad
uate housing shortage.
One graduate student in
drama said his future might be
jeopardized if the University cut
his department. His two greatest
worries were that he might not
finish his work and that a degree
from a defunct department might
mean little in the job market.
Jones said departments being
cut would be "phased-out" and
that the University "would
assume responsibility" for the
students. But after the forum,
she said the committees "must
come up with answers" to ques
tions like how the drama stu
dent's field might view his cre
dentials.
