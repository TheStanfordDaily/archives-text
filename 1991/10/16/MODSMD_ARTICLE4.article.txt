# Enrollment increase unlikely
## Officials doubt they'll admit extra students to raise money 
### Steve McCarroll Senior Staff Writer 
Although the University Cabi
net's upcoming budget decisions
remain shrouded in secrecy, sev
eral indications suggest the cabi
net is no longer considering
increasing the size of Stanford's
undergraduate student body.
"The proposal does not seem to
be under serious consideration at
all," Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said yesterday.
The possibility of increasing
tuition revenue by admitting up
to 10 percent more students was
recommended in August by the
Faculty Senate's task force on
revenue enhancement as a way to
help meet the University's $40
million budget shortfall.
Because such an increase

would put a strain on housing,
class enrollment and student ser
vices, many students had feared
the Cabinet would make exactly
such a decision at its meeting
tomorrow.
But Montoya said the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning has not requested
that such an idea be studied by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid,
which met Monday afternoon.
"The research that would be
necessary to come to a position on
that issue hasn't been conduct
ed," Montoya said. "If in fact it
were under serious consideration,
we would have been notified of
it."
Charles Kruger, deputy chair
of the cabinet committee, said,
"No changes would be made in

any area that [the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid] has jurisdiction
over unless CUAFA has a role in
the process."
In recent years a handful of
schools have enlarged their
undergraduate student body in
order to increase revenue. Since
Dartmouth College did so, it has
required students to complete one
of their academic terms in the
summer so that student resources
are not strained during the tradi
tional school year.
Another dilemma posed by
such an enlargement would be its
effect on Stanford's financial-aid
policy. Senate task force chair
James Collman said enlarging the
student body would produce sig
nificant revenue only if the extra
students were admitted without
financial aid.
That would affect the Universi
ty's policy of need-based aid, under
which admitted students are given
the financial assistance deemed nec
essary for them to be able to attend.
Critics have said such a change
would alter the composition of
Stanford's undergraduate student
body by adding an extra tier of stu
dents who could come only if they
could afford it.
Coll man, who supports enlarg

ing the student body, said the
resulting change in its composition
would be "negligible." He estimat
ed that increasing the number of
undergraduates by 600 would pro
duce $7 million in net income.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Admissions and Financial Aid
did form a subcommittee Monday
to meet later in the quarter in order
to study the possible ramifications
of such a change. Montoya said the
subcommittee will be a source of
information on such a suggestion,
"should it ever re-surface."
Kruger said the idea is not com
pletely off the table, but added, "In
my opinion ... it will not prove to
be feasible."
