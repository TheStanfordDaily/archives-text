# Enrollment increase unlikely
## Officials doubt they'll admit extra students to raise money

Although the University Cabi
net's upcoming budget decisions
remain shrouded in secrecy, sev

net is no longer considering
increasing the size of Stanford's
undergraduate student body.
"The proposal does not seem to
be under serious consideration at
all," Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said yesterday.
The possibility of increasing
tuition revenue by admitting up
to 10 percent more students was
recommended in August by the
Faculty Senate's task force on
revenue enhancement as a way to
help meet the University's $40

Because such an increase

would put a strain on housing,
class enrollment and student ser

the Cabinet would make exactly
such a decision at its meeting

But Montoya said the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate

that such an idea be studied by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid,
which met Monday afternoon.
"The research that would be
necessary to come to a position on
that issue hasn't been conduct

were under serious consideration,
we would have been notified of
it."
Charles Kruger, deputy chair
of the cabinet committee, said,
"No changes would be made in

any area that [the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid] has jurisdiction
over unless CUAFA has a role in
the process."
In recent years a handful of
schools have enlarged their
undergraduate student body in
order to increase revenue. Since
Dartmouth College did so, it has
required students to complete one
of their academic terms in the
summer so that student resources
are not strained during the tradi
tional school year.
Another dilemma posed by
such an enlargement would be its
effect on Stanford's financial-aid
policy. Senate task force chair
James Collman said enlarging the
student body would produce sig
