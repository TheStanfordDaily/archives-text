# Signing class opens doors to 'different world'

Most language classes at
Stanford require students to
spend hours each quarter
mumbling to themselves in
the language laboratory of
Meyer Library. But Cathy
Haas teaches two language
classes that do not require
students to speak at all.
Fifteen years ago, Haas,
who is deaf, worked on a
research project in the Psy
chology Department using
American Sign Language.
"My first student was Coco
the gorilla," said Haas, who
taught Coco to sign as part of
the project.
Haas then began to teach
sign language to humans —
students at the School of
Medicine. Her class was so
popular that one of her stu
dents urged Haas to begin a
class for undergraduates.
Haas wrote a letter to the Lin
guistics Department, and her
two undergraduate classes
were organized.
Haas uses a variety of
methods to teach 30 students
in Beginning Sign Language
— demonstrating how to sign
vocabulary words, asking stu
dents to practice by signing
their favorite color and even
entertaining them by signing
the story of "Goldilocks and

the Three Bears."
An interpreter, Randi McHar
gue, helps ease communication
between Haas and her students in
the beginners' class. McHargue
graduated from Stanford in 1988
and studied under Haas.
Haas also teaches 18 students
in Intermediate Sign Language, a
second-year continuation of the
beginning class. No interpreter is
needed in this class, since Haas
and her students can communi
cate using only sign language.
Haas believes that it is impor
tant for Stanford students to
learn sign language, because they
"are majoring in all different
things" and they will enter a vari
ety of different professions. "Deaf
people need professionals who

understand deaf culture," she
explained.
Many students have found ways
to use sign language while still at
Stanford, volunteering as oral
interpreters at the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital or helping to
promote deaf awareness.
For example, Chris Wheeler, a
senior in Haas' second-year class,
said she uses her skills in sign lan
guage to act as an oral interpreter
at the Disability Resource Center.
Sophomore Emily McChesney
said she is learning to sign
"because it's unusual and very
interesting. A lot of our language
is communicated through ges
ture."
Although McChesney does not
yet use sign language in any spe
cific ways, she is interested in a
career in health care, and know
ing sign language "opens up a dif
ferent world."
