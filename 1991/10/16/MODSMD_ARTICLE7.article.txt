# THE
						SOVIET CRISIS IN PERSPECTIVE
## In course of a year, major changes sweep Soviet society

Editor's Note: Louis O'Neill is a fifth-year senior
co-terming at the Center for Russian and East Euro
pean Studies. He spent the last 11 months at Moscow
State University on a Fulbright scholarship and trav
eled extensively throughout the various Soviet
republics.
This student-perspective is the first of a three-part
series.

When I entered the Soviet Union in Sept. 1990,
average people could feed their families and get by on
their state salaries.
But when I left the USSR, just days before the
failed coup attempt in August, the society I had
joined 11 months before was unrecognizable.
I arrived in a country where the overall economic
situation, way of life and political climate had
retained a continuity with the pre-glasnost-perestroi
ka past.
Much had changed, but bread, milk, transport and
cigarettes were available at state-subsidized prices
daily, and in essentially unlimited quantity. Annual
inflation was roughly 30 percent — high by Western
standards, but low on the third-world scale.
Government radio frequently broadcast anti-
Western, anti-capitalism programs, reports and com
mentary. The Communist party still held a hegemo
ny of power and showed no sign of relinquishing it.
Two months later, however, most produce and
meat in the capital had vanished. They became regu
larly accessible only at farmers' markets at hundreds
of times their former price or at the workplace. The
days of government subsidy were ending.
It became difficult to live on one's pay, the vast
majority of people being forced to moonlight, pilfer
from the state or speculate in the resale of goods.
This created a new mood of competition and isolation
in the USSR.
Whereas people worked together before in times of
shortage, perhaps sharing information about where a
hard-to-find good was available, such knowledge
became suspiciously guarded. I heard over and over
the comment among Muscovites that the nation had

quickly become "zloy" — mean, malicious and ill
tempered.
The ruble exploded against the U.S. dollar, which
became the unofficial currency of the Soviet Union.
(The average Soviet salary today is from 300 to 600
rubles per month, or 10 to 20 dollars.)
Government radio and television broadcast shows
such as "Marketing and Your Life," "What is a
Lease?" and "American Business Language," hoping
that this meager attempt would transform an eco
nomically illiterate nation into one of burgeoning
capitalists.
The Communist party became anemic from the
continuous hemorrhage of tens of thousands of its
members, and its leaders —most prominently Gor
bachev — earned the disgust and contempt of the
population. They fell into the category of "Impotents,
Thieves and Enemies of the People" (from a poster at
a Nov. 7 protest).
Shortly after my arrival, a strange incident took
place which established a pattern for winter. All
cigarettes and tobacco disappeared from Moscow,
and consequently the entire country.
The ensuing Tobacco Riots proved that cigarettes
are much more vital to Muscovites than the milk and
bread which disappeared in the following weeks.
The fall harvest was an extremely bountiful one,
but approximately 40-60 percent of it rotted either in
the fields or en route to distribution centers due to
the archaic condition of Soviet transport networks
and to the fact that the old economic system was
maimed before anything was put in its place, leaving
the workers and managers to their own devices.
Discontent grew as finding food became increas
ingly difficult, and it found a voice in massive anti
government, anti-Gorbachev demonstrations on Oct.
25 and Nov. 7.
More than 300,000 Muscovites took to the streets
after Gorbachev ordered the army to enforce his
decree banning a protest in support of Boris Yeltsin.
The protest's size forced Gorbachev to free the capi
tal of troops the next day. This moral victory for the
democrats during the "mini-coup" attempt gave
them the determination to resist in August.
As winter deepened the general mood deteriorated

and was tipped towards hopelessness when on Dec.
21 Foreign Minister Edward Sheverdnadze unex
pectedly resigned.
On January 13 tanks and troops thrust into Riga
and Vilnius, capitals of the Latvian and Lithuanian
Republics. At least 22 people were killed.
In Moscow the general mood was one of despair.
Another 100,000-plus protest followed fast upon the
killings. Almost as if in answer to this protest, the
Ministry of Finance announced that all 50 and 100
ruble notes were being taken out of circulation.
Money in the banks was frozen and each citizen was
to be allowed the equivalent of two months' salary to
trade in as old banknotes for new.
This step hurt only the weakest members of soci
ety because anyone with any substantial amount of

money knew through his or her network that this
was going to take place and transferred all banknotes
into smaller denominations or hard currency.
The economic chasm between the underground
millionaire, the speculator and the Party appa
ratchic, and the pensioner, student or single mother
widened dramatically after this reform.
Following the pattern that general economic laws
like supply and demand do not yet work smoothly in
the USSR, prices did not decrease after this defla
tionary step, but continued rocketing upward. By
this point, I didn't object, because it meant that the
lines got shorter and shorter; the queue at McDon
ald's Moscow was reduced from an average of 45 min
utes to barely 10 minutes by two 100-percent price
increases.
On April 2 Soviet leaders dropped nearly 60 per
cent of the population below the official poverty line
through draconian price increases on many staple
goods and luxuries.
For example, the price of bread and milk was
raised 150 percent; the fare for the metro, serving
millions daily who have no other means of trans
portation, rose 300 percent; and a simple haircut rose
700 percent. Vodka, however, they dared not touch.
Concurrently, every person — including me, since
I "enjoyed all the rights of a Soviet student" —
received 60 rubles compensation monthly. This is
enough to buy a kilo of cashew nuts and a kilo of
decent apples if you are a good haggler.
Many people fatalistically took this all in stride.
One close friend simply said, "Last year we ate rasp
berries and mushrooms, this year we won't."
Once again the USSR defied conventional eco
nomic wisdom. We all thought that speculators were
holding back high-demand goods and foods to wait
and see about the price increases, and that the mar
ket would be flooded after April 2.
Nothing of the sort occurred. We came to the
frightening conclusion that there were no goods to be
distributed.
An uneasy peace fell, after a half-hearted May Day
parade that was filled with muted slogans and accom-
