# Failed coup points profs in new directions
## Changes pose challenges for Soviet scholars 
### Lesley Edwards 
Struggling to catch up with
course material is not an activity
reserved for students — just
think of the professors studying
Russian and East European stud
ies.
Although the recent upheavals
in the Soviet Union are challeng
ing them as educators, the profes
sors are not complaining.
"On the whole, we welcome
the changes — didn't expect
them, but welcome them," said
History Prof. Norman Naimark,
director of the Center for Russian
and East European Studies.
Naimark organized a round
table discussion earlier this
month to help the faculty sort out
the August coup attempt and its
implications for the future.
The distinguished group of
participants included professors
and scholars from UC-Berkeley,
the Hoover Institution and Stan
ford's History, Political Science,
Slavic Studies and Economics
departments.
"The more we talk to each
other, the more we learn,"
Naimark said. By sharing their
"different perspectives" with one
another, he added, faculty mem
bers gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the situation in
the divided Soviet Union.
Naimark said he hasn't
changed his course, "20th Centu
ry Eastern Europe," in a major
way since the August revolution.
His course focuses mainly on the

past, so there isn't a need for
much alteration, Naimark said.
But Naimark conceded that
"the focus does shift a little. What
happens in the present always
influences how you look at the
past."
History Prof. Alexander
Dallin, who is teaching "The Sovi
et Union: Politics and Society
Since 1917" and "Soviet History"
this quarter, also plans to keep

his courses essentially the same.
"The historical aspect hasn't
changed significantly," Dallin
said.
At the same time, Dallin and
Naimark both recognize that the
changes raise some provocative
questions they will address at
some point during the quarter.
Dallin said he plans to use the
August revolution as a means "to
question a number of assump

tions that had existed in the
field." Two of those questions,
he said, are: "How was it possible
for a system that we regarded as
completely totalitarian to unrav
el?" and "Was there ever a Soviet
threat, and if so, how serious was
it?"
Among other things, Naimark
said he will look at how commu

nism evolved in Eastern Europe
and where Eastern Europe may be
going in the post-Communist era.
The August revolution seems to
have spurred student interest, as
well as scholarly interest in the
Soviet Union. Naimark said his
class is much larger than it was last
year — as are all of the classes
related to the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, including lan
guages.
On questionnaires the Universi
ty sent to incoming freshmen over
the summer, "the events in Rus
sia" was the most common topic of
interest.
"People are very anxious to
understand what's going on,"

Naimark said.
Thanks to the high level of
interest, the Center for Russian
and East European Studies —
unlike some areas which pared
down course offerings this fall —
actually added courses for autumn
quarter.
A new art course was added, and
available Slavic languages now
include Czech and Serbo-Croatian
in addition to Russian and Polish.
The number of faculty and stu
dent exchanges with the Soviet
Union has increased over the past
few years, Naimark said. This year,
for the first time, Soviet graduate
students as well as undergraduates
are attending Stanford.
"There is a much greater ability
to communicate and to travel,"
Naimark said. "The only problem
now is money."
