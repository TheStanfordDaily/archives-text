# Stanford scholars examine recently released materials

German tanks rolled out of
Poland onto the flat fertile plains
of the Ukraine in the early morn
ing hours of June 22, 1941.
"Operation Barbarossa" had
begun.
As the German units advanced,
the Russian farmers fought back
valiantly with sickles and shovels,
but were no match for the mighty
German military machine. As the
invasion continued, however, the
Russian people rallied together to
form a unified opposition to the
German intruders.
Or did they?
Recent archival material
released by the Soviet Union sug
gests that Soviet opposition was
far from unified.
The new information released
by the Soviet Union, until recent
ly kept secret from historians,
"gives us a much richer picture"
of the circumstances of the war,
said History Prof. Alexander
Dallin.
David Holloway, a political sci
ence professor and the co-director
of Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control,
agreed. He said that while Nazi
archives have been open to histo
rians for years, it is only recently
that scholars have been allowed
access to the Russian vaults.
A three-day conference, orga
nized by by History Prof. Norman
Naimark, Dallin and Holloway
met early last summer in Italy to
discuss the new information.
Hopefully, Holloway said, offi
cals in the Soviet and Russian

governments will allow historians
to understand the motivations of
both warring countries.
That had been a difficult task.
The propaganda of the Soviet gov
ernment, which suppressed nega
tive facts, had always emphasized
that the German invasion was
stopped by a patriotic uprising of
Soviet citizens.
But the newly uncovered mate
rial shows that this is actually far
from the truth, Holloway said.
Internal communist reports on
civilian activity, secret military
reports and interviews with peo
ple involved have shown that
many Russians — particularly
those in the Ukraine, which had
just been annexed — at first wel
comed the Germans as liberators.
In the past, the Soviets often
rewrote history to satisfy their
social and political agenda. Dur
ing Stalin's rule, Holloway point
ed out, the German push into
Russia was explained as an orga
nized retreat of the Red Army.
But Holloway said the new
material released by the Soviet
Union is believable. Because it
contains information from prima
ry sources and is largely negative,
it does not seem designed as pro
paganda.
However, there is still no
"coherent account" of what moti
vated Stalin during the war, Hol
loway said, adding that he hopes
the conference will spark interest
in the issue and lead to further
archival studies.
Holloway said the conference
was a good first step, allowing his
torians to begin to examine the
invasion and the period shortly
before it"in a detailed and com
plex way."
Dallin said he valued working
with the Soviet historians, "who
now have the ability to speak more

frankly about these matters."
The conference, which con
vened at the Rockefeller Founda
tion's Study and Conference Cen
ter in Bellagio, Italy, was held on
the 50th anniversary of Hitler's
attack on the Soviet Union.
Twenty-one World War II his
torians from the United States,
the United Kingdom, Soviet
Union and Germany attended the
conference.
