# Budget cuts to spare need-blind admissions
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford's commitment to need-blind
admissions will not be a casualty of the
upcoming budget cuts, Provost James
Rosse said yesterday.
"After a careful, deliberate look, the
University does not intend to abandon its
commitment to need-blind admissions,"
Rosse said.
Although he declined to comment fur
ther on the University Cabinet's budget
decisions until they are announced next

week, Rosse said the need-blind admis
sions policy had come under scrutiny dur
ing the planning process.
"We've really had to put everything on
the table," he said.
Dean of Admissions James Montoya
said he was "thrilled" that the policy —
under which students are admitted with
out respect to their financial need — will
continue.
"I think it is a significant decision in
that it speaks to Stanford's commitment
to recruiting, admitting and enrolling a
truly diverse freshman class," he said.

"This statement comes
at a very good time in
that people have ques
tioned Stanford's com
mitment to need-blind
admissions, particularly
in this period of budget
cuts," he added. "This
will be news that will be
quickly carried to high
school counselors."

Need-blind admissions has become an
expensive commitment for universities
during the last decade. While the cost of

higher education, and therefore the need
for aid, have spiraled upward, federal and
state aid have declined, placing an
increasingly heavy burden on colleges
and universities.
Stanford will contribute close to $33
million of its own funds to undergraduate
financial aid next year — more than three
times what it did a decade ago.
A number of schools, including Smith
Col'ege and Wesleyan College, have
recently abandoned need-blind admis
sions policies.
In addition to those institutions, Mon

toya said, "There are many others that
are contemplating whether they are able
to maintain need-blind admissions."
The cabinet, which includes Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy, Rosse and
the deans, will meet today to finalize deci
sions on budget-reduction targets for the
University's seven schools and 13 admin
istrative units.
The targets, along with a statement on
Stanford's mission and preliminary deci
sions on a number of University-wide
budget issues will be announced early
next week.
