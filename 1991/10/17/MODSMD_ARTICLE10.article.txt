Bush's benefits veto stands
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate yester
day narrowly upheld President Bush's veto of a
$6.4 billion package of expanded unemployment
benefits, but Democrats vowed to come back
quickly with a new proposal.
The Senate voted 65-35 to override Bush's
veto, but the bill died because supporters fell
two votes short of the two-thirds majority need
ed to prevail. The chamber's 57 Democrats were
joined by eight Republicans in voting to over
turn the president.
The Democratic-written bill would have given
up to 20 extra weeks of coverage to people who
have used up the standard 26 weeks of benefits.
Man kills 22 in Texas
KILLEEN, Texas (AP) — A man smashed a
truck through a restaurant window yesterday
and sprayed semiautomatic gunfire at people in
line for lunch, killing 22 before committing sui
cide, authorities said. It was the deadliest mass
shooting in U.S. history.
"The guy jumped out of the truck and said,
'This is what Bell County has done to me!' "
said Sheldon Smith, a porter at the Luby's
Cafeteria. "As he opened fire, the guy that he
ran over with the truck was trying to get up and
he shot him.
"Then he pointed toward the line where the
service was and he started shooting down the
line."
