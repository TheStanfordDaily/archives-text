# Bush says confirmation process 'not fair'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - After a brawl
that left scant joy in victory, President Bush
vowed yesterday to push for a changes in the
Senate's confirmation process, while
Democrats said he must share the blame for
the spectacle that Clarence Thomas's nomi
nation became.
"There's general agreement around the
country and certainly in the Senate that the
present process is not fair," Bush said yes
terday. Thomas' confirmation to the
Supreme Court, with two votes to spare,
ended one of the most bitter and inflamma
tory nomination battles ever.
Thomas was expected to take his seat on
the court on Monday. Officials said he may
visit the White House this week to take an
oath to uphold the Constitution. He must
take a second, judicial oath, probably
Monday morning at the court.
Bush said he would present his ideas on
changing the process soon. "I owe the people
my observations and more importantly some
suggestions to improve the process," Bush said.
But the president himself was the target
of complaints in the Senate. Some of the
Southern Democrats who provided the cru
cial votes to confirm Thomas said Bush had
a one-sided view of the Senate's constitution
al advice-and-consent role: he asked for the
consent without the advice.
"We need to strengthen the advice, as well
as the consent process," said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga. "When senators have legitimate con
cerns about nominees, the president must
take those concerns seriously, not simply

take the position that each nominee warrants
unqualified support for political reasons."
Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who like Nunn
voted for Thomas, also said Bush should con
sult senators before sending them his nomi
nations.
"Very little advice on this nominee was
sought by the White House, and that's why
they got very little consent," Breaux said on
CBS' "This Morning" program. "I think we
have to improve both ends of those processes
in order to improve the system."
Sen. Paul Simon, D-111., who opposed
Thomas, introduced a non-binding "sense of
the Senate" resolution saying that in future
nominations the president should conduct
informal, bipartisan consultations with some
members of the Senate before making his
selection. It urges that the president "keep
philosophical balance in mind" in deciding
on the next nominee.
Simon, a member of the Judiciary
Committee that conducted three days of
public hearings into the lurid details of the
sexual harassment allegations against
Thomas, said the panel should have had "a
little harder questions" for the nominee.
"You had two different approaches,"
Simon said, appearing on the same program
with Breaux. "On the Republican side, they
were advocates (for Thomas). They had a
very clear focus. On the Democratic side, the
two leading questioners were trying to get at
the facts and were less advocates, and so
there were people who were disappointed in
that approach."
