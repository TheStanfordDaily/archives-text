## We'll eat a spider 
### 
Recommendations
are far from enough
to make needed cuts

IF THE ASSU'S RECENTLY
released budget recommenda
tions add up to the $40 million
that needs to be cut from the Uni
versity's operating budget, we'll
eat a spider.
In those five, single-spaced pages
of suggestions, only 10 items are
vaguely hinted at being ready to be
put on the cutting board. Twice as
many, however, are given sanctuary
from any reduction in funding.
The ASSU has reacted like our
very own U.S. Senate, protecting
each and every interest of its broad
constituency, while failing to step
back and look at the real picture.
The one, main cut the ASSU
does suggest almost precisely
echoes what one would expect to
hear from any hopeful senator:
Reduce bureaucracy. Even here the
ASSU avoids specifics, instead
issuing a broad statement: "The
largest cuts, on the order of 20 per
cent [should be] in units with a
majority of expenditures in non
academic staff areas."
It is an optimistic thought — in
fact, a wholly American thought —
that savings can be achieved by sim
ply taking a hatchet to the excess
personnel who waste their time gos
siping at the water cooler while the
boss is looking the other way.
But anyone who has real experi
ence in a corporation, or has taken
an industrial engineering class,
knows full well cuts aren't made
that easily. The result of cutting 20
percent from one area, even if that
area goes by the name "non-aca
demic," would be catastrophic to all.
The work done by the non-aca
demic staff seems cuttable because
it's effects are less tangible than
actual programs. However, the
work done by this section of the
staff is necessary to keep the rest of
the University running.

The few sacrifices the ASSU is,
in fact, bold enough to name are
strange and fail to reflect the
desires of the student body.
The ASSU lays the Haas Public
Service Center on the table as a
sacrifice which must be made in
order to save "core academic and
research programs."
But cutting public service down
to a self-supporting unit is certain
ly not an idea representative of the
student body. Public service is one
of the only parts of campus that
isn't entirely self-serving. Our pub
lic service programs make a greater
impression on more people than
any academic department.
The other cuts suggested in the
budget recommendations include
replacing resident computer coor
dinators with student volunteers,
increasing nominal user fees for
athletic courses and purchasing
"monochrome rather than color
computers." These cuts, though
specific, do not approach the $40
million that needs to go.
The ASSU does suggest the
University raise additional rev
enue by allowing national fraterni
ties and sororities to build houses
on campus. Such a policy change
would serve to increase both hous
ing for undergraduates and rent
revenues.
Although this move would only
make a small dent in decreasing
the operating budget, it is indica
tive of the kind of creative thinking
that needs to be done more fully if
the ASSU hopes to have greater
impact with the administration.
Residential education, along
with such sacred calves as the Live
ly Arts program, are unrealistically
defended in the recommendations.
Res Ed, at the very least, will need
to undergo some reductions in pro
graming.
The ASSU's budget recommen
dations are indicative of how diffi
cult the budget-cutting process
actually is: No one is waiting to
jump up and offer his or her pro
gram to be cut.
Such decisions, however, hard as
they may be, need to be made.
