## A 						look back at Thomas

1 THINK SOMETHING IS dreadfully
wrong with this country when any per
son . . . could be subjected to this. This
is a circus. It's a national disgrace. ... It
must stop for the benefit of future nomi
nees and for our country."
Come now, Judge Thomas, spare us
the histrionics. You are looking pretty
healthy for a lynched man. Now that you
have been confirmed and have a moment
to rest on your new bench, let's review
last week's events.
Should the committee have investigat
ed Anita Hill's allegations behind closed
doors? Couldn't the Senate have respect
ed Thomas' privacy, and Hill's as well?
At first they tried. Hill refused to
make her testimony public, and the sena
tors went along. The last thing they
wanted was a public sexual-harassment
hearing. But that was just what they got
after somebody leaked the FBI report to
the press. Good for them.
Sexual harassment is not a private
shame; it is a criminal act. Why should
the topic have to hide behind closed
doors? We may not feel particularly digni
fied when we turn on our televisions and
watch U.S. senators discussing "Long
Dong Silver," but we cannot let our
squeamishness determine our behavior.
When a credible person accuses a
Supreme Court nominee of any serious
crime, we have a right and a responsibili
ty to hear the accuser's charges and the

nominee's defense.
Were the hearings a circus? Was the
weekend simply an all-channel, senatori
al version of "A Current Affair"? I don't
think so. Sometimes the senators were
childish; often they were pompous; and
there were more than a few moments of
cruelty. And as a fact-finding team the
Senators did a credible job.
The nature of the issue ensured that
very few facts could be found. The sena
tors were forced to examine a highly emo
tional case that pitted one person's word
against another's. There were no wit
nesses to the crime, no fingerprints, no
smoking guns.
The lack of physical evidence made the
hearings a trial of character. The sexual
nature of the charges made them lurid
entertainment. No process, save sweep
ing the issue under the rug, could have
avoided these facts.
Will Thomas' confirmation and Anita
Hill's humiliation cause many women to
continue in their reticence to confront
sexual harassment? On the one hand, few
would have the courage to repeat Hill's
ordeal. To do so, especially without objec
tive and conclusive evidence, is to invite
character assassination.
On the other hand, the hearings put
sexual harassment on the American polit
ical agenda. As the result of the hearings,
new laws against harassment will be draft
ed, and new procedures for addressing

grievances will be implemented. The issue
will be much harder to minimize or ignore.
Has the broader nomination process
failed? It is the peculiar balance of power
Americans have established between
Congress and the Executive which really
explains why the process seems so unsat
isfying. Bush does not have enough allies
in the Senate to easily confirm the ultra
conservative judges he really desires.
On the other hand, the Senate
Democrats are neither numerous enough
nor sufficiently united to demand Bush
name a moderate, consensus candidate.
Bush brought shame on himself by
appointing a barely qualified party hack
to the bench and using Thomas' skin
color to win the few extra Senate votes
needed for confirmation.
Nevertheless, the country will survive.
The Supreme Court will follow, not lead
the nation on civil-rights issues such as
sexual harassment. The Democrats will
replace the Republicans as the champi
ons of states' rights. And perhaps my
grandchildren will witness a liberal on
the bench.
