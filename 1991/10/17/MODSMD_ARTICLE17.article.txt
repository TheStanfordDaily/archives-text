## Family should be kept together to maintain morality 
### 
I'M WRITING IN RESPONSE to
Mario Huerta's letter of Oct. 15,
which proposes the abolition of the
family as a solution to many of society's
current problems — specifically, rape
and the gay/lesbian-rights movement.
I agree — the incidents this campus
has witnessed in the first month of the
school year have been appalling and
have caused many to examine their per
sonal beliefs and fall to one side of the
issue or the other.
However, I could not be in greater
disagreement with Huerta's suggestion
to "dismantle" the family. Huerta's
reduction of the family to a "small-scale
economic unit in which people repro
duce" is indicative of the flaws and omis
sions in the rest of his arguments.
I see no reason to abandon the family
structure altogether, but rather, to rally

around negative situations — poverty
and homelessness, abuse, alcoholism,
illiteracy — and to try to change them
for the better.
The family has the responsibility to
instill a morality and value system in its
children and should be allowed and
encouraged to do so.
I don't believe families are teaching
their children the wrong ideas, but that
there isn't enough teaching of right val
ues. I doubt the idea of "when a girl says
'no,' she doesn't really mean it" is com
ing from a boy's parents, but more likely
from his peer group — the same peer
group Huerta suggests is better for
everyone to be raised in.
Quite frankly, encouraging greater
promiscuity in an effort to allow discov
ery of one's sexuality will only blur that
division even more. If sex were reserved

for the marital relationship, as God
intended it, and abstinence were taught
and valued in society, not only would
our society be physically healthier, but
the definition of rape would be clearer.
I consider myself extremely blessed to
have grown up in a stable, loving two
parent home — one might say a tradi
tional family unit. However, my family
is far from traditional in one area. My
parents have had a hand in nurturing 33
children.
The group homes some of these chil
dren come from are large-scale housing
situations where some 80 children, ages
0-18 years, live under one roof. They are
a far cry from Huerta's idea of "large
scale arrangements . . . [that] could be
perfected to the point that people could
experience the same closeness and love
that they receive."

Children come to our home from
these group houses looking and acting
physically and mentally retarded due to
the lack of attention and stimulation
they receive there. Within a month of
being part of our family, they are smil
ing, playful, alert and active because of
the love and individual attention they
receive in a family.
The family has suffered in the many
recent attacks on its members — rape,
the gay/lesbian movement, teenage preg
nancy, AIDS, increased poverty — but it
cannot and will not become one of the
casualties of these attackers.
If our generation wants to take a his
torical step to better society, we'd best
get behind the family and build it up
instead of stamping it out.
