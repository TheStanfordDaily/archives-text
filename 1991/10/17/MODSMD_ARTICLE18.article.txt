# Band's irreverence, satire in general lead not to pain but shame
## 
### 
I wasn't at the football game. I am
not a nun. I like the Band. My mother
even thinks they play well. But I've been
thinking we're going to need some new
routines for Big Game.
Maybe we dress up our rascally drum
major like he's "queer"; instead of a
cross or a menorah, he can brandish â€” a
whistle? But the Weenies might not get
the point. So instead we make him up
like Anita Hill; she can wave around a
microphone, or a Coke bottle maybe.
I dare you.
Remember, "It may have been painful
to some, but satire and the exercise of
free speech invariably are." Thus
intoned The Daily's editorial board last
Friday. Alas, that they had always been

so penetrating.
Three years ago about this time, two
rascally freshman put up a poster in the
African-American theme house:
Beethoven in black-face, Beethoven with
learning eyes, Beethoven with big lips.
There had been an argument that night:
One man said Beethoven was part Black;
our frosh said NOT.
They went to their room, poured
themselves a few liters of inspiration
and came up with the aforementioned
"satire." The crowd went wild.
Now I am not sure that caricature,
whether of nuns or of kinky-haired
composers, is the same as satire.
I am not sure that satire and the
exercise of free speech are "invariably"
painful. And I am not sure about
the winds of freedom on this campus.
They only seem to blow in one
direction.
Shame.
