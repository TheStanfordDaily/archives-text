# Domestic-partners insurance threatens sanctity of marriage
## 
### 
The recent decision by Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to provide insurance
coverage to "the partners of unmarried
students in long-term relationships,
either heterosexual or homosexual" has
taken an already questionable policy one
step further.
Domestic-partners insurance cover
age is objectionable first on an economic
basis. The absurdly loose guidelines that
the "partners" must be in a monoga
mous relationship that only has to have
existed for six months is a wide-open
invitation to fraud.
How does Cowell propose to regulate
the monogamy requirement after the
"partners" are receiving benefits?
It is on a deeper, moral basis that the
proposed policy concerns me most, how

ever. To equate a "six-month monoga
mous relationship" with the institution
of marriage is to trivialize and demean
the latter. Marriage is a legally binding,
publicly declared affirmation of a com
mitment to a life-long relationship.
Elevating the act of signing a paper in
Cowell Health Center that declares six
months of monogamy to the same status
as marriage is a moral travesty.
Before my letter is misconstrued as a
rash manifestation of homophobia, real
ize that my objections lie equally with
the privileges granted to heterosexual as
well as homosexual "domestic partners."
My intentions are simply to affirm the
sanctity of marriage.
Does the domestic-partners policy con
tain the model of marriage we want to
demonstrate to the rest of the country?
Especially in light of the impending bud
get crisis, the Stanford community would
be wise to take a long, hard look at itself
before making any more radical decisions.
