## Quake leaves lasting mark on campus

IT LASTED ONLY 15 SECONDS,
but the havoc it caused will remain
for nearly a decade.
Hitting the Bay Area at 5:04 p.m. on
Oct. 17, 1989 — two years ago today —
the Loma Prieta earthquake killed 63 peo
ple, injured more than 3,700 others and
caused an estimated $7 billion in damage.
No injuries were reported at Stan
ford, but $200 million in earthquake
damage has strained a tight budget and
forced the closure of several of the Uni
versity's most historic buildings, includ
ing Memorial Church and Hanna
House, a residence designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright.
It will be several more years before
Stanford fully recovers from the powerful
temblor.
Asst. Provost for Planning and Man
agement John Hughes said that although
repair costs were originally estimated at
about $200 million, budget constraints
compelled the University to scale back its
repair project.
Now, with only $165 million budgeted
for the project, Hughes said the Univer
sity will have to be selective about what
can be fixed now and what can wait.
The decision about what to fix is based
primarily on two factors: a building's aca
demic priority and its value as a part of
the University's heritage, Hughes said.
He said that means "we'll fix up the
modern language building before the
golf course, and we'll fix up the Quad
before other areas on campus."
Shortly after Loma Prieta, the Uni
versity planned a nine-year reconstruc
tion program, with the Quad as the main
repair target.
The repairs will make the buildings
"earthquake-resistant," with enough
strength to withstand an earthquake
measuring about 8.0 on the Richter scale,
Facilities Project Manager Fouad
Bendimerad said.
But, he added, "there is no such
thing" as an "earthquake-proof' build
ing. "That's a layman's term engineers
hate to use," Bendimerad said. "Any
