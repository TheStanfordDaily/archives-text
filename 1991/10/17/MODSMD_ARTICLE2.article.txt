# The 						Loma Prieta legacy
## Quake leaves lasting mark on campus

IT LASTED ONLY 15 SECONDS,
but the havoc it caused will remain
for nearly a decade.
Hitting the Bay Area at 5:04 p.m. on
Oct. 17, 1989 — two years ago today —
the Loma Prieta earthquake killed 63 peo
ple, injured more than 3,700 others and
caused an estimated $7 billion in damage.
No injuries were reported at Stan
ford, but $200 million in earthquake
damage has strained a tight budget and
forced the closure of several of the Uni
versity's most historic buildings, includ
ing Memorial Church and Hanna
House, a residence designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright.
It will be several more years before
Stanford fully recovers from the powerful
temblor.
Asst. Provost for Planning and Man
agement John Hughes said that although
repair costs were originally estimated at
about $200 million, budget constraints
compelled the University to scale back its
repair project.
Now, with only $165 million budgeted
for the project, Hughes said the Univer
sity will have to be selective about what
can be fixed now and what can wait.
The decision about what to fix is based
primarily on two factors: a building's aca
demic priority and its value as a part of
the University's heritage, Hughes said.
He said that means "we'll fix up the
modern language building before the
golf course, and we'll fix up the Quad
before other areas on campus."
Shortly after Loma Prieta, the Uni
versity planned a nine-year reconstruc
tion program, with the Quad as the main
repair target.
The repairs will make the buildings
"earthquake-resistant," with enough
strength to withstand an earthquake
measuring about 8.0 on the Richter scale,
Facilities Project Manager Fouad
Bendimerad said.
But, he added, "there is no such
thing" as an "earthquake-proof' build
ing. "That's a layman's term engineers
hate to use," Bendimerad said. "Any


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
building will undergo some dam
age in a earthquake."
When earthquake-damaged
buildings are strengthened,
Bendimerad said the main goal is
to make sure they won't collapse
during a quake.
"For a building to be entirely
earthquake resistant, well, we'd
have to wait for more quakes to
occur to test some engineering
principles," he said.

The quake lasted
only 15 seconds,
but the havoc it
caused remains.

A few repair projects are cur
rently underway or will begin
soon, but several other projects are
on hold until sufficient funds can
be raised, Bendimerad said. Repair
of Geology and Language Corners,
the Art Gallery, the Anatomy
Building and Hanna House will be
delayed several years.
The $8 million renovation of
Memorial Church will be fmished
by September, when the church
should open for the first time since
Loma Prieta, Bendimerad said.
Another $1.5 million is needed to
establish a permanent mainte
nance fund for projects such as the
upkeep of stained-glass windows.

Construction on Green Library
will begin next summer; it should
be fully restored within two years.
Bendimerad said $30 million will
cover the basic repair cost, while
another $8 million is needed for
the relocation of books that are
temporarily in storage.
The $20 million renovation of
Stanford Museum will begin in
December 1992, with a targeted
reopening date two years after
that.
The $1.5 million project to
repair Building 370, which had
been used by the VTSS Depart
ment, began in June and should
be finished by Nov. 1.
A total of $3.8 million has been
budgeted for renovation of Build
ings 300 and 310.
Work on Building 300, which
had been used by the English
Department, will begin at the end
of this year. Building 310, which
had been part of the Provost's
Office, will begin construction in
February.
The earthquake has also
placed the University in a dispute
over repairing several houses on
San Juan Hill. The original deci
sion to demolish the houses and
replace them with faculty resi
dences was met with sharp criti
cism from some students and fac
ulty, who said the houses should
be saved.
The University now plans to
repair Phi Psi house, but still
plans to demolish Synergy house.
Delta Tau Delta, which burned
down last Friday, may stand to
collect money from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
for repairs, Bendimerad said.

Memorial Church,
after $8 million in
repairs, should re
open in September

Several projects have already
been finished. Repairs of the
Graduate School of Business were
completed last summer, costing
$6.2 million.
The east and west portals,
located at opposite ends of the
Quad, were completed earlier this
year for $1.2 million.
Funding for the earthquake
repair project comes mainly from
FEMA and the University's oper
ating budget. Although FEMA
contributions are still unsettled,
the University hopes to receive
from $50 million to $60 million
during the next five years.
Hughes said about $25 million
from the operating budget will be
used for rebuilding costs over the
next ten years.
Another $6 million will come
from the general plan improve
ments fund, a part of the budget
that normally allows for routine
repairs.
The Office of Development
hopes to raise another $40 mil
lion, Associate Campaign Director
Richard Bennett said. So far,
about $13 million has been raised.
Bennett said $8 million of that
total has been used for repair of
Memorial Church, which is not
eligible for FEMA funds because
it is a religious building.

but the havoc it
caused remains.

A few repair projects are cur
rently underway or will begin
soon, but several other projects are
on hold until sufficient funds can
be raised, Bendimerad said. Repair
of Geology and Language Corners,
the Art Gallery, the Anatomy
Building and Hanna House will be
delayed several years.
The $8 million renovation of
Memorial Church will be fmished
by September, when the church
should open for the first time since
Loma Prieta, Bendimerad said.
Another $1.5 million is needed to
establish a permanent mainte
nance fund for projects such as the
upkeep of stained-glass windows.

Construction on Green Library
will begin next summer; it should
be fully restored within two years.
Bendimerad said $30 million will
cover the basic repair cost, while
another $8 million is needed for
the relocation of books that are
temporarily in storage.
The $20 million renovation of
Stanford Museum will begin in
December 1992, with a targeted
reopening date two years after
that.
The $1.5 million project to
repair Building 370, which had
been used by the VTSS Depart
ment, began in June and should
be finished by Nov. 1.
A total of $3.8 million has been
budgeted for renovation of Build
ings 300 and 310.
Work on Building 300, which
had been used by the English
Department, will begin at the end
of this year. Building 310, which
had been part of the Provost's
Office, will begin construction in
February.
The earthquake has also
placed the University in a dispute
over repairing several houses on
San Juan Hill. The original deci
sion to demolish the houses and
replace them with faculty resi
dences was met with sharp criti
cism from some students and fac
ulty, who said the houses should
be saved.
The University now plans to
repair Phi Psi house, but still
plans to demolish Synergy house.
Delta Tau Delta, which burned
down last Friday, may stand to
collect money from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
for repairs, Bendimerad said.

Memorial Church,
after $8 million in
repairs, should re
open in September

Several projects have already
been finished. Repairs of the
Graduate School of Business were
completed last summer, costing
$6.2 million.
The east and west portals,
located at opposite ends of the
Quad, were completed earlier this
year for $1.2 million.
Funding for the earthquake
repair project comes mainly from
FEMA and the University's oper
ating budget. Although FEMA
contributions are still unsettled,
the University hopes to receive
from $50 million to $60 million
during the next five years.
Hughes said about $25 million
from the operating budget will be
used for rebuilding costs over the
next ten years.
Another $6 million will come
from the general plan improve
ments fund, a part of the budget
that normally allows for routine
repairs.
The Office of Development
hopes to raise another $40 mil
lion, Associate Campaign Director
Richard Bennett said. So far,
about $13 million has been raised.
Bennett said $8 million of that
total has been used for repair of
Memorial Church, which is not
eligible for FEMA funds because
it is a religious building.

IT LASTED ONLY 15 SECONDS,
but the havoc it caused will remain
for nearly a decade.
Hitting the Bay Area at 5:04 p.m. on
Oct. 17, 1989 — two years ago today —
the Loma Prieta earthquake killed 63 peo
ple, injured more than 3,700 others and
caused an estimated $7 billion in damage.
No injuries were reported at Stan
ford, but $200 million in earthquake
damage has strained a tight budget and
forced the closure of several of the Uni
versity's most historic buildings, includ
ing Memorial Church and Hanna
House, a residence designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright.
It will be several more years before
Stanford fully recovers from the powerful
temblor.
Asst. Provost for Planning and Man
agement John Hughes said that although
repair costs were originally estimated at
about $200 million, budget constraints
compelled the University to scale back its
repair project.
Now, with only $165 million budgeted
for the project, Hughes said the Univer
sity will have to be selective about what
can be fixed now and what can wait.
The decision about what to fix is based
primarily on two factors: a building's aca
demic priority and its value as a part of
the University's heritage, Hughes said.
He said that means "we'll fix up the
modern language building before the
golf course, and we'll fix up the Quad
before other areas on campus."
Shortly after Loma Prieta, the Uni
versity planned a nine-year reconstruc
tion program, with the Quad as the main
repair target.
The repairs will make the buildings
"earthquake-resistant," with enough
strength to withstand an earthquake
measuring about 8.0 on the Richter scale,
Facilities Project Manager Fouad
Bendimerad said.
But, he added, "there is no such
thing" as an "earthquake-proof' build
ing. "That's a layman's term engineers
hate to use," Bendimerad said. "Any


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily
building will undergo some dam
age in a earthquake."
When earthquake-damaged
buildings are strengthened,
Bendimerad said the main goal is
to make sure they won't collapse
during a quake.
"For a building to be entirely
earthquake resistant, well, we'd
have to wait for more quakes to
occur to test some engineering
principles," he said.

The quake lasted
only 15 seconds,
but the havoc it
caused remains.

A few repair projects are cur
rently underway or will begin
soon, but several other projects are
on hold until sufficient funds can
