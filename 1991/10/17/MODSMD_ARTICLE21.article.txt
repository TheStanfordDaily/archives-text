## Goalie Kyle Krpata keeps 'em all away day after day With three consecutive shutouts, Krpata's on a roll 
### Brian Egan Staff Writer 
When Stanford men's soccer coach
Colin Lindores came to the Farm two
summers ago, he knew he had a decent
goalie in Kyle Krpata. At the time, how
ever, it didn't matter much to the coach
what kind of a keeper Krpata was.
"He was the only goalkeeper we
had," Lindores said. "While he had
demonstrated that he could play on the
Division I level, we still asked ourselves,
'How good is this player?'"
Although Lindores did not recruit
Krpata for Stanford, the coach had seen
him play often in high school.
"I refereed many of his high school
games," said the coach, "so I was famil
iar with Kyle before I came to Stan
ford."
Indeed, by Krpata's final year at Bel
larmine Prep, the entire collegiate soc
cer world was familiar with him. As a
senior, the Saratoga native was selected
to the California All-State Team and
was a member of the Under-20 Nation
al Team.
Krpata was recruited by soccer giants
like UCLA, Santa Clara and Duke, but
opted for Stanford over these powers.
As a freshman, Krpata made a strong
contribution, starting nine games and
posting three shutouts and a minute
1.08 goals against average.
The Cardinal, as a unit, was not
nearly as successful as its keeper, aver
aging only 1.33 goals scored en route to
a disappointing 8-11-2 record. Accord
ing to Krpata, it wasn't until Lindores
arrived last year that things took at
turn for the better.
"As a team, we had no direction [in
1989]," the goalie said. "Things imme
diately improved when we got our new
coach."

'Kyle was brilliant.... Without his great play,
we would have come away with two losses
instead of two ties.'

Lindores and assistant coach Greg
Petersen came to Stanford with some
definite ideas about goalkeeping.
"[Goalies] are something special
because of their responsibility," Lin
dores said. "They're sort of like catchers
in baseball. Our goal in practice is to
involve the goalkeepers with the other
players, not to isolate the goalie."
Krpata started all 21 games in 1990,
compiling a 1.34 goals-against average
and four shutouts for a 9-6-6 Stanford
team. Still, the Cardinal coaches saw
some room for improvement.
"Kyle was known as a line-keeper, a
goalie who restricts his movement
around the goal," Lindores said.
"You don't want do ruin a guy's
game, but that's where Greg [Petersen]
has been working with Kyle. A goalie
who moves around is a lot easier on his
defense."
The next turning point in Krpata's
soccer career came in June, when the
goalie was selected to play for the U.S.
Olympic Festival's West team in Los
Angeles. While the Festival itself was
old hat for Krpata (he competed in 1989
as well), the experience he gathered the
second time around has paid big divi
dends.
"I gained a lot of confidence this
summer competing in the Olympic Fes
tival, and it has carried over to this
year," Krpata said.
Has it ever. The Cardinal opened its
1991 season competing in the Addidas-

Metropolitan Life Classic at the Univer
sity of Indiana, and came away with ties
against No. 4-ranked Indiana and No. 6-
ranked St. Louis.
Lindores credits his goalie with both
of these upsets. "Kyle was brilliant. .. .
Without his great play, we would have
come away with two losses instead of two
ties."
And Krpata hasn't slowed down.
He's been the most consistent per
former on the 8-2-3 Stanford team to
date, and has recorded three consecu
tive shutouts heading into tomorrow's
game against top-ranked Santa Clara.
More importantly, Krpata has devel
oped into one of the team's true leaders.
"Kyle is probably the unofficial team
captain," said sophomore Ricky Goad.
"He's capable of dominating a game and
is very easy to get along with."
Lindores agreed. "There's no doubt
that he's a leader. Individual players
respect him on and off the field."
Indeed, Krpata has progressed in
more ways than one since his days as
"Stanford's only goalie." Lindores, how
ever, expects that Krpata will improve
even more with age.
"Kyle's only a junior," the coach said.
"Most good goalies in the world don't
enter their prime until they're 28 or
30."
This, more than anything else, is a
disturbing thought for Cardinal oppo
nents as Stanford enters its 1991
stretch run.
