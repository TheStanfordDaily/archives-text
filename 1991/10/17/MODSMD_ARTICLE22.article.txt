# Foudy is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
## 
### 
If you've ever been surfing out past the
big waves and see a Jaws-sized shark fin
coming straight for you, you know the
feeling.
It's like playing goalie when the bobbing
ponytail of Stanford midfielder Julie Foudy
comes into sight.
You're ali alone, you have no where to
hide, and there isn't much you can do. You
can scream if you want or try to fly away, but
sooner or later you're just more goalie bait
for the ferocious Foudy.
Foudy, a 5-foot-6-inch junior on the sixth
ranked women's soccer team, is a predatory
goal-scorer and the most dominating athlete
at Stanford. With seven games left to play,
she has broken the Stanford single-season
scoring record and targeted her undefeated
team for a national championship.
Unfortunately for Stanford, just when
Foudy is getting to the NCAA tournament
bait, she is being lured away by an even big
ger prize the World Cup. Foudy, a star on the
national team, is expected to be in China for
the World Cup at the same time as the NCAA
tournament in November.
Stanford is still a strong team without
Foudy, but without their leading scorer they
probably won't have the firepower to shoot
to the national title.
Foudy has tallied 14 goals and five assists
to lead the team this year, after being named
an All-American as a sophomore. Coming
out of high school in Laguna Niguel, Calif.,
she was the most highly-sought soccer
recruit in the nation, and was named the Los
Angeles Times Soccer Player of the Decade.
"How do you prepare for playing without

Foudy?" said head coach Berhane Andeber
han. "You can't. You accept it, take the
responsibility, face the reality, and go on.
"This is something we've prepared our
selves for. We discussed and accepted it as a
team in the spring," he said.
Stanford has had a chance to practice and
play without Foudy before. She missed two
weeks of preseason practice when she was
working with the National Team in North
Carolina, and missed last Saturday's 1-0 win
over Cornell. In that game, Stanford was
punchless and obviously missed Foudy's
verve.
Twelve teams are invited to the NCAA
Tournament, with four teams receiving first
round byes. The first round will be held Nov.
9, the second Nov. 16, and the Final Four
Nov. 23-24. All games are held at participat
ing school sites, and unfortunately, none of
them are anywhere near China.
"I will reserve the right to let her go as
late as possible," Andeberhan said. "Any of
those decisions I'll take responsibility for so
she doesn't have to worry about it."
"We are now in position to determine our
own destiny," said Andeberhan, whose team

finished 15-3-1 last year and lost to UC-
Santa Barbara in the first round of the
NCAA tournament.
"Our defense really is playing well. The
fullbacks and Heather (Mclntyre) are doing
great, but it really is a team defense. It starts
with our forwards. I really have confidence
that when we take a 1-0 lead we are going to
win the game," he said.
Foudy will lead the attack Friday in what
is probably the biggest night ever in Stan
ford soccer. At 6 p.m. the Stanford men, 8-2-
3 and looking for a tournament bid of their
own, take on previously top-ranked Santa
Clara. The Bronco men were upset Tuesday
by surging USF.
The women follow at 8 p.m. with a chance
to avenge last year's 2-1 defeat and continue
a perfect season. Santa Clara lost to Virgina
1-0 in overtime last week, and isn't as strong
as last year when it lost to North Carolina in
the NCAA final.
"The Santa Clara game is huge," Foudy
said. "It will decide who the number one
team is in the region. If we beat Santa Clara
and do well the rest of the way, we'll get a
bye for the first round of the playoffs. With
just one win we'll be in the Final Four."
Unfortunately, Foudy probably won't be
there. This shark is headed for a bigger soc
cer tank in which to prey.

cer games, the football game, and the volley
ball game and to blow off War and Peace
until Monday.
