### Tish Williams Staff Writer 
Adele Moore and the Stanford
women's golf team provided some
shining moments in the wet and
windy final day of the Washing
ton Intercollegiate in Seattle.
Moore scored a hole-in-one,
only the second in the tourna
ment's twelve year history, help
ing her finish third in the overall
standings.
Moore's hole-in-one came on
the 17th hole of the Sahalee
Country Club course. It is a 3-
par, 185 yard hole.
Improving in the team stand
ings after two days of pursuit, the
Cardinal finally caught up with
USC, tying for second with an
overall score of 929.
Arizona clobbered the compe
tition, winning with 899 total
strokes, breaking the tourna
ment record set by the 1989 Wild
cat squad. Oregon came in fourth
with 949 shots.
Adele Moore led the Cardinal,
holding steady in third place with
a three-day performance of 72,
76, and 74. Audrey Wooding, who
was tied with Moore for third
after two rounds, slipped to a tie
for fourth, with an overall show
ing of 75, 73 and 78.
Both Moore and Wooding bat
tled it out in the top five individ

ual standings for the majority of
the tournament against talented
competition:
Sophomore Melinda Daniels
had a consistently good tourna
ment, finishing 17th with 80, 78
and 78 stroke performances.
Martha Richards, after a
promising second round, strug
gled on the last day falling two
places to 36th, with 84, 79 and
83. Freshman Amy Lawrence
finished in 38th with 85, 80 and
82.
"This is my third year on the
course, which is a definite advan
tage," she said, finishing high in
a strong field.
"I like the course," confessed
Moore, "it makes you hit better
shots. There's a lot to take into
account with this course. I plan
things really well. . . it's a good
course for me."
Moore's hole-in-one, the sec
ond of her career, was an extra
bonus, with her focussing skills
paying off.
Wooding was happy with her
final performance. Her putting
practice save her in the final day.
"I started to hit some errant
shots, but my putting paid off.
There were definitely a few shots
here and there I could improve,"
Wooding said, "but for the condi
tions, and the position I was in, I
had a good finish."
