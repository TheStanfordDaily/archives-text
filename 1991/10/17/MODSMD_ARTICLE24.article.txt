What can you do to keep up on
the diverse arena of Stanford
sports this weekend? Try check
ing out some of the members of
the shwashbuckllng fencing team
in action — a team which promis
es to be a nationally-reckoned
powerhouse.
This weekend, the Stanford
fencing team will host the under
-20 North American Circuit, one
of the qualifiers for the Junior
World Championships. The
fencers at the three day tourna
ment will be trying to make the
U.S. Junior National team which
will attend the Championships,
held in Italy in April.
"It will be a great opportunity
to take a look at both our compe
tition and [possible future]
recruits," said Sherry Posthu
mus, women's fencing coach.
Not to mention a great oppor
tunity for Stanford fans to get a
preseason peek at some of the
Cardinal hopefuls.
An especially exciting appear
ance will be the premiere of GeofT

'It will be a great
opportunity to take a
look at both our com
petition and [possi
ble future] recruit.'

Donaker. The frosh will debut in
his first match since arriving at
the Farm. Donaker comes on the
scene as a highly-touted recruit in
foil. Highly touted? What can one
guy achieve in high school to
impress the home of Nick Bravin?
Well, how about this: Donaker
won foil in the first California
State Games in both the under-19
and seniors categories last year,
he has achieved an "A" class
ranking, which is the highest pos
sible, he is ranked No.ll in
juniors, and last year he placed
fourth at the Junior National
Championships.
"[He's] a big hope for
NCAA's," Posthumus said. In

fact, with the January return of
Bravin, the 1990 NCAA men's
foil champ, Stanford could boast
the best foil team in Cardinal his
tory.
Other members of the Stan
ford men's squad who will be
fencing in the tournament are
sophomores Sam Kim and Ryan
Kaltman, both in foil.
Members of the Cardinal
women's team who will take part
in the tournament include fresh
men Anna Cumming, Allison Lee,
and Cherise Melton and sopho
more Thea Wojtkowski, all in foil.
The tournament will feature
women's epee in addition to foil,
which is distinctly different from
the NCAA, which only has
women's foil. Cumming will also
fence epee.
Friday will feature Donaker
and the rest of men's foil, as well
as women's epee. Saturday will
bring women's foil and men's
sabre while Sunday will bill men's
epee. Each round will begin at
8:00 a.m. and go throughout the
day in Burnham Pavilion and
Ford Center.
