# Student view of Moscow State
## 
### Louis O'Neill 
Editor's note: Louis O'Neill is
a fifth-year senior co-terming at
the Center for Russian and East
European Studies. II- °nent the
last 11 months at Moscow State
University on a Fulbright schol
arship and travelled extensively
throughout the various Soviet
republics.
This student-perspective is the
second of a three-part series.

When I enrolled in Moscow
State University for the 1990-
1991 school year, I entered an
academic and social world com
pletely unlike the American edu
cational system. The obstacles
and limitations facing Soviet stu
dents and scholars make it
remarkable that anything at all
gets accomplished.
The university is the Soviet
Union's most prestigious institu
tion of higher education. It is akin
to taking Stanford, Yale and Har
vard and putting them under one
roof.
The main building of the uni
versity houses not only the
largest dormitory in the world —
about 11,000 students live there
— but also many departments,
classrooms, museums, professors'
apartments and the entire univer
sity's administrative center.
The building, Moscow's most
prominent feature, is a kilometer
square and nearly 50 stories to
the tip of the red star on its gold
en spire. It was built by German
war prisoners in the early 1950s
and to this day retains the feeling
of a penal camp.
The general decay of Soviet
society is reflected by the changes
which have wracked the universi
ty recently. According to my
friends, the year before I arrived
the cafeteria food was edible and
varied, broken windows were
promptly fixed, and the ovens and
stoves were kept up.
Dances and social gatherings
took place, and there was even a
student cafe. Students were gen
erally optimistic about the future
and glad to be at the school.
Now, the interior of the building
lies in near-ruin. The on-duty peo
ple are gone, early victims of bud
get cuts. With them has vanished
any semblance of control or order.
In most places the floor boards
have been torn up and glass
swinging-doors and windows
smashed, victims of weekend
drinking binges or frustration.
In fact, the large plate glass
windows in the kitchen of our

floor were destroyed in winter
and we had snow in the hallway
for about 10 days, until someone
decided to fix it. And this was on a
floor where foreigners live, so it
was usually better kept than the
all-Soviet floors.
The walls are pock-marked
with holes, exposing wiring and
pipe. We had one pay phone on
each floor, shared by about 125
people, but ours broke near the
beginning of my stay and was
never repaired.
Only the bravest souls could
eat in the student cafeteria,
where they would wait up to an
hour for unrecognizable food that
actually poses a health risk.
About 300 people were terribly
stricken in an outbreak of
salmonella poisoning, and one of
my friends wound up in a Soviet

hospital, itself a nightmarish
place.
Cooking on each floor is an
option, but we had three gas
burners and no oven for 125 peo
ple. The garbage chute, located in
the kitchen, was unusable
because it was too small and poor
ly designed. People just threw
their trash on the floor, creating a
perfect environment for vermin
and rats.
There was absolutely no sense
of respect for the dormitory, or
even awareness that it was our
common home. This careless view
may be explained by the fact that
Soviet education is completely
free. In fact, students receive a
monthly stipend, the amount of
which depends on their grades.
Straight-A students receive
150 rubles a month, while those
students with two or fewer B's get
120. All the rest get 90 rubles. For
comparison, the black-market
price of a bottle of vodka is from
25 to 40 rubles.
The small size of these
stipends, plus the awareness that
a bus driver makes four times as
much as an engineer or scholar,
rob Soviet students of motivation.
Very few find any practical use for

their education. Many men enroll
just to avoid service in the Soviet
army, in which thousands of sol
diers die, commit suicide or sim
ply vanish each year. Beginning
this year, however, the student
exemption from service has been
repealed.
Our rooms were quite small —
six by 10 feet. Americans had
their own room, while most Sovi
et students lived with another
person, or maybe even two others.
In light of this, it is very common
for a student to arrange a "dead
soul" — someone who has gradu
ated, lives at a different address
or really is dead — for his or her
roommate. About half of my
friends had such ghosts for room
mates.
Academically, the Soviet sys
tem stresses rote learning and
repetition on exams, which are
generally oral. Years of studying
"The History of the Communist
Party," "Scientific Communism"
or "Atheist Theory" — which are
still taught to this day, only under
more "democratic" titles — have
somewhat robbed Soviet students
of their ability to entertain cre
ative solutions to problems and
led them to spit out the expected
answers during exams.
Education in the sciences is
excellent, but I found the human
ities sorely lacking compared with
the American system. Com
pounding this is the fact that the
most basic educational tools are
simply unavailable. Finding the
required texts for a class is incred
ibly frustrating, and more than
once I dropped a class simply
because I couldn't find the books.
Soviet students often cram an
entire semester's work into a kind
of elongated Dead Week. The old
Soviet saying that "We pretend to
work and they pretend to pay us"
has its corollary in the education
al system: "They pretend to
teach, and we pretend to learn."
However, because the system
is so flawed, Soviet students tend
to take their education into their
own hands and are much less
spoon-fed than their American
counterparts.

When I enrolled in Moscow
State University for the 1990-
1991 school year, I entered an
academic and social world com
pletely unlike the American edu
cational system. The obstacles
and limitations facing Soviet stu
dents and scholars make it
remarkable that anything at all
gets accomplished.
The university is the Soviet
Union's most prestigious institu
tion of higher education. It is akin
to taking Stanford, Yale and Har
vard and putting them under one
roof.
The main building of the uni
versity houses not only the
largest dormitory in the world —
about 11,000 students live there
— but also many departments,
classrooms, museums, professors'
apartments and the entire univer
sity's administrative center.
The building, Moscow's most
prominent feature, is a kilometer
square and nearly 50 stories to
the tip of the red star on its gold
en spire. It was built by German
war prisoners in the early 1950s
and to this day retains the feeling
of a penal camp.
The general decay of Soviet
society is reflected by the changes
which have wracked the universi
ty recently. According to my
friends, the year before I arrived
the cafeteria food was edible and
varied, broken windows were
promptly fixed, and the ovens and
stoves were kept up.
Dances and social gatherings
took place, and there was even a
student cafe. Students were gen
erally optimistic about the future
and glad to be at the school.
Now, the interior of the building
lies in near-ruin. The on-duty peo
ple are gone, early victims of bud
get cuts. With them has vanished
any semblance of control or order.
In most places the floor boards
have been torn up and glass
swinging-doors and windows
smashed, victims of weekend
drinking binges or frustration.
In fact, the large plate glass
windows in the kitchen of our

floor were destroyed in winter
and we had snow in the hallway
for about 10 days, until someone
decided to fix it. And this was on a
floor where foreigners live, so it
was usually better kept than the
all-Soviet floors.
The walls are pock-marked
with holes, exposing wiring and
pipe. We had one pay phone on
each floor, shared by about 125
people, but ours broke near the
beginning of my stay and was
never repaired.
Only the bravest souls could
eat in the student cafeteria,
where they would wait up to an
hour for unrecognizable food that
actually poses a health risk.
About 300 people were terribly
stricken in an outbreak of
salmonella poisoning, and one of
my friends wound up in a Soviet

hospital, itself a nightmarish
place.
Cooking on each floor is an
option, but we had three gas
burners and no oven for 125 peo
ple. The garbage chute, located in
the kitchen, was unusable
because it was too small and poor
ly designed. People just threw
their trash on the floor, creating a
perfect environment for vermin
and rats.
There was absolutely no sense
of respect for the dormitory, or
even awareness that it was our
common home. This careless view
may be explained by the fact that
Soviet education is completely
free. In fact, students receive a
monthly stipend, the amount of
which depends on their grades.
Straight-A students receive
150 rubles a month, while those
students with two or fewer B's get
120. All the rest get 90 rubles. For
comparison, the black-market
price of a bottle of vodka is from
25 to 40 rubles.
The small size of these
stipends, plus the awareness that
a bus driver makes four times as
much as an engineer or scholar,
rob Soviet students of motivation.
Very few find any practical use for

their education. Many men enroll
just to avoid service in the Soviet
army, in which thousands of sol
diers die, commit suicide or sim
ply vanish each year. Beginning
this year, however, the student
exemption from service has been
repealed.
Our rooms were quite small —
six by 10 feet. Americans had
their own room, while most Sovi
et students lived with another
person, or maybe even two others.
In light of this, it is very common
for a student to arrange a "dead
soul" — someone who has gradu
ated, lives at a different address
or really is dead — for his or her
roommate. About half of my
friends had such ghosts for room
mates.
Academically, the Soviet sys
tem stresses rote learning and
repetition on exams, which are
generally oral. Years of studying
"The History of the Communist
Party," "Scientific Communism"
or "Atheist Theory" — which are
still taught to this day, only under
more "democratic" titles — have
somewhat robbed Soviet students
of their ability to entertain cre
ative solutions to problems and
led them to spit out the expected
answers during exams.
Education in the sciences is
excellent, but I found the human
ities sorely lacking compared with
the American system. Com
pounding this is the fact that the
most basic educational tools are
simply unavailable. Finding the
required texts for a class is incred
ibly frustrating, and more than
once I dropped a class simply
because I couldn't find the books.
Soviet students often cram an
entire semester's work into a kind
of elongated Dead Week. The old
Soviet saying that "We pretend to
work and they pretend to pay us"
has its corollary in the education
al system: "They pretend to
teach, and we pretend to learn."
However, because the system
is so flawed, Soviet students tend
to take their education into their
own hands and are much less
spoon-fed than their American
counterparts.
