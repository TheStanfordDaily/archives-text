## Ice on the rocks 
### 
TODAY'S TOPIC FOR DEBATE: Does Vanilla
Ice get a bad rap ... or does he just give it?
Now, don't get me wrong. The man is cool.
Way cool. Cooler than I'll ever be — hell, no one ever
goes around humming "Harris, Harris, Baby" to
themselves. (But then again, how often do you hear
the phrase, "Thank God for Ice"?) He's cooler than
anyone Stanford could put up against him. Cooler
than Kennedy. Cooler than our new fire marshall.
Cooler than that tall sharp-lookin' blond-haired
dude who's always hanging out against the back of j
the coffee house. He's even — dare I say it? — cool-J
er than Flag Boy.

What I'm trying to say here is Ice is cool. OK, so
that doesn't exactly sound profound. But it's true.
Cool, cool, COOL: He's the polar opposite of Release
— emphasis on polar. He's freezin', man. Cooler
than Pete Wilson's reception in the Quad. Cooler
than a Row house dinner. Cool.
Of course, things weren't always so easy for this
toughest of pretty-boys. As a young schoolchild in a
rough neighborhood, he had to endure all sorts of
taunts from the older — if not exactly wittier — bul
lies during recess:
"Hey, Vanilla . . . Vanilla Wafer! Ha ha ha!"
"Awww, cut it out! My name's Vanilla Ice. If you
don't stop it then I'm gonna tell — "
"Vanilla Ice? Ha ha ha! Then I'll Mick' you in a
fight after school! Ha ha ha!"
But these incidents only toughened him up and
crystallized his determination to one day make it
big.
Alas, 'twas not so easy. Countless talent agents,
mistaking Vanilla Ice for one of Strawberry Short
cake's friends, refused to give him any tough-guy
parts, instead offering him supporting roles in sappy
cartoon specials next to Lemon Meringue and Blue
berry Muffin.
But they couldn't hold this man down for long,
'cause he had what it takes for every pop rapper to
succeed: a stupid name, a bunch of old rock albums
from which he could steal pieces of songs and one
Truckosaurus-sized ego.
Throw it all together, mix in the backbeat from
"Gimme Some Lovin'," and Ice had his first smash,
a snappy little number about (surprise!) himself:
So what if I'm rude and my singing is poor/ And
I look like that Russian in "Rocky IV?"/1 don't give
a turd what all you middle-class wussies think,
cause I'm an/ Ass, Ass, Baby
"Ice, Ice, Baby." Hmm. Sounds a bit like that
"Isis, Isis, Isis . . ." show if you ask me. Maybe his
next single will be "Shazam! Honey" or something.
Regardless, Vanilla Ice has gone on to become the
most successful light-skinned performer of inher
ently black music since Michael Jackson.
What makes the Iceman so popular, so darn
COOL? Let's go straight to those who know and ask
his fans. Of course, we'll have to wait until the 3:15
bell rings. . . .
Hey you, 15-year-old, swoony teeny-bopper sitting
in your room with walls full of black-and-white
posters of half-naked men holding babies. . . . Yeah,
you, the one spending an hour and a half trying on
new makeup even though you 're only going out with
a bunch of your girlfriends and have to be home by
11:30. . . . Why do you listen to Vanilla Ice?
"Oh, well, urn, uh (giggle) . . . hmm. Lemme ask
my friends, OK? OK. Um, 'cause it's got a great beat,
and it's easy to dance to."
Ah, yes, that hallmark 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 beat of his.
Only a genius. . . .
Hey you, pre-pubescent squealer with the "New
Kids" T-shirt, Dirty Dancing wall calendar and a
subscription to POPCORN magazine, why do you

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY


Chris Harris
THANK GOD FOR HARRIS!
listen to Vanilla Ice?
"Oh, 'cause he's so CUTE!"
Ah yes, I understand. ... He
looks good, so you listen to his
music. Seems we have a case of
sensory confusion here. Could
prove difficult later in life, when
she sits down to sniff a good book,
looks for "Van Gogh's Greatest
Hits" on CD or starts munching
on the tactile dome in the
Exploratorium.
Hey you, gangly stringy-haired
delinquent Paly kid hanging out
in White Plaza, who believes Axl

Rose has the answer to all the
world's social problems, why do
you listen to Vanilla Ice?
"Huh? Don't ask me nuttin' —
I just skateboard here."
And there you have it. A touch
ing Capra-esque story about a kid
who overcomes insecurity about
his dumb name by repeating it
over and over again.
But for now he's still rollin',
silencing all competition, and it
seems that no one can brake the
Ice.
For Ice, like the Beastie Boys
before him, has been chosen to
play the token white in an arena
dominated by blacks — sort of a
negative image of Clarence

Thomas. But hey, why have a
negative image of Clarence
"You've got your pubic hair in my
coke! — You've got your coke in
my pubic hair! — MMMmmmm"
Thomas? Even assuming the alle
gations were true, he hardly did
anything any other self-respect
ing man with the last name
Thomas wouldn't do.
But as for our hero, his singing
must be at least partly legit. Oth
erwise he'd be Vanilli Ice.
And now, after cameos in such
star-launching vehicles as
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
II," Ice has finally broken into the
movie industry with a film all to
his own. "Cool as Ice," coming

soon to a theater near you, deals
with the adventures of an ultra
cool rude dude who always gets
the woman. Sort of a bleached,
syncopated Ford Fairlane. Cool.
It's gonna be tough come Satur
day night, when I have to decide
between that movie and the new
Hulk Hogan flick.
But perhaps I should stop here.
After all, I've been chewing on Ice
too much — could be a sign of sex
ual frustration.

Unlike that girlie-haired, self
pity-wallowing Stein, Chris Har
ris has no woman problem. In
fact, he's had this no-woman
\ problem for some time now. ...
