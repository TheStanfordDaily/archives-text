# Community might be unprepared for quake

hails from where the ground
rarely moves.
"I don't know what to do if
there's an earthquake," she said.
"I know what to do if there's a
hurricane or tornado, but some
how I don't think that they're
very similar."
Van Nostrand, a native of Con
necticut, is just one of the many
individuals new to "earthquake
country" this year.
Given the likelihood of anoth
er earthquake in the near
future, there is substantial con
cern on campus that the legacy of
the Earthquake of 1989 will soon
be forgotten, and people like Van

Nostrand will be caught unpre
pared.
A resident of Otero, Van Nos
trand pointed out that the earth
quake orientation film sched
uled for broadcast over SUNet
failed to air in her dorm.
"Aside from meeting at the lit
tle red emergency point outside
of the building, none of the frosh
in the Wilbur complex knows
what to do in the event of an
earthquake," Van Nostrand said.
Peter Ward, a geophysicist
with the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park, said there is a 67
percent probability that another
earthquake like Loma Prieta,
which measured 7.1 on the

should reopen for weddings and services in September. The Uni

Richter scale, will hit the Bay Area
within the next 30 years.
In other words, Ward said,
"another major quake is twice as
likely to occur in the coming years
as not to."
Despite these menacing statis
tics, some University officials say
they are finding it increasingly dif
ficult to keep earthquake aware
ness levels high.
"Safety is largely a matter of
awareness," said Chris Griffith,
assistant director of graduate resi
dences. "And people become less
aware of .. . being prepared the
further away we get from this kind
of event."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington had a similar view.
"It's been two years since Loma
Prieta. Half the student body is
new, and the fact is that an earth
quake is not real for them until
they've been through one."
Four years ago the University
closed Roble Hall, the largest dorm
on campus, when it was deemed
structurally unfit to withstand an
earthquake. It reopened a year
later, after extensive structural
reinforcement.
But Herrington said all the
attention to making buildings safe
will mean little if students are
unprepared for a quake.
"If we could just get members of
the community to set aside five
minutes to examine the safety
information we provide," he said,
"the University as a whole would
be a lot better off."
Some of that information
includes:
• An earthquake action check
list, a one-page summary of the

safest courses of action in the event
of an earthquake. The pamphlet is
routinely distributed to residence
staff, who review it during their
orientation;
• The "Be Quake Safe" pam
phlet, a brief but thorough "before,
during and after" summary of
earthquake procedures. It is pro
vided to all dorm residents when
they pick up their keys;
• The "Perils of Paradise" video,
which contains earthquake educa
tional and procedural information.
It is broadcast on SUNet during
orientation.
In addition to those services, the
University has taken steps to pre
pare for possible disaster condi
tions after a major earthquake.
Dan Smith, Stanford Public
Safety's special services manager,
said the University has buried 12
fiberglass silos at locations around
campus. Each contains enough
food and supplies to sustain 850
people for three days.
Smith added that special RA
kits, containing a flashlight, whis
tle and emergency plans, are dis
tributed to residence staff at the
beginning of the year.
"The ongoing issue regarding
safety is preparedness," Smith
said. "My hope is that, living in
earthquake country, students will
take full advantage of the informa
tion that's offered to them."
But students may not be the
only people who need to take more
responsibility for preparedness.
Keith Guy, acting director of
housing, said the University held a
major "earthquake day" celebrat
ing the first anniversary of Loma
Prieta last year, but no such event
has been planned for this year.
"I just don't think that there's
much incentive for it," Guy said.
"Two years have passed and people
have pretty much forgotten."

The length of the earthquake
orientation for this year's resi
dence staff has been cut from three
hours to 20 minutes, Guy added.
At least a few residence staff
members have their doubts about
their dorms' preparedness for
another major quake.
Junior Mica Martin, an RAin
Rinconada, said she is confident
that she knows the steps to take
after an earthquake, but is con
cerned that other dorm residents
do not.
"Other than being told where
the emergency meeting point is, I
don't think that the freshmen have
actually received much earthquake
training or feel confident about
what they should do," Martin said.
She added that the "Perils of
Paradise" video never aired in Rin
conada.
Lon Berquist, video information
resources coordinator, said he
wasn't sure why some dorms
didn't receive the SUNet broadcast
of the video, but he guessed that it
was a simple problem.
"Probably what happened is
they didn't make sure to check that
the TVs were connected to the
SUNet cable," Berquist said.
He added that the cables are
often pulled out during the sum
mer and need to be reconnected at
the beginning of the school year.
In Branner Hall, where the
video was shown, another RA,
junior Martina Lauchengo,
recalled having "mixed feelings"
about the film's message.
Some residents of her dorm, she
said, seemed to leave the showing
with the impression that it might
be "fun" to experience an earth
quake.
"The best motivator for pre
paredness will be the next earth
quake," Guy said, "and hopefully it
won't be the big one."

was a simple problem.
"Probably what happened is
they didn't make sure to check that
the TVs were connected to the
SUNet cable," Berquist said.
He added that the cables are
often pulled out during the sum
mer and need to be reconnected at
the beginning of the school year.
In Branner Hall, where the
video was shown, another RA,
junior Martina Lauchengo,
recalled having "mixed feelings"
about the film's message.
Some residents of her dorm, she
said, seemed to leave the showing
with the impression that it might
be "fun" to experience an earth
quake.
"The best motivator for pre
paredness will be the next earth
quake," Guy said, "and hopefully it
won't be the big one."
Kreshman Kira Van Noatrand
hails from where the ground
rarely moves.
"I don't know what to do if
there's an earthquake," she said.
"I know what to do if there's a
hurricane or tornado, but some
how I don't think that they're
very similar."
Van Nostrand, a native of Con
necticut, is just one of the many
individuals new to "earthquake
country" this year.
Given the likelihood of anoth
er earthquake in the near
future, there is substantial con
cern on campus that the legacy of
the Earthquake of 1989 will soon
be forgotten, and people like Van

Nostrand will be caught unpre
pared.
A resident of Otero, Van Nos
trand pointed out that the earth
quake orientation film sched
uled for broadcast over SUNet
failed to air in her dorm.
"Aside from meeting at the lit
tle red emergency point outside
of the building, none of the frosh
in the Wilbur complex knows
what to do in the event of an
earthquake," Van Nostrand said.
Peter Ward, a geophysicist
with the U.S. Geological Survey
in Menlo Park, said there is a 67
percent probability that another
earthquake like Loma Prieta,
which measured 7.1 on the

Richter scale, will hit the Bay Area
within the next 30 years.
In other words, Ward said,
"another major quake is twice as
likely to occur in the coming years
as not to."
Despite these menacing statis
tics, some University officials say
they are finding it increasingly dif
ficult to keep earthquake aware
ness levels high.
"Safety is largely a matter of
awareness," said Chris Griffith,
assistant director of graduate resi
dences. "And people become less
aware of .. . being prepared the
further away we get from this kind
of event."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington had a similar view.
"It's been two years since Loma
Prieta. Half the student body is
new, and the fact is that an earth
quake is not real for them until
they've been through one."
Four years ago the University
closed Roble Hall, the largest dorm
on campus, when it was deemed
structurally unfit to withstand an
earthquake. It reopened a year
later, after extensive structural
reinforcement.
But Herrington said all the
attention to making buildings safe
will mean little if students are
unprepared for a quake.
"If we could just get members of
the community to set aside five
minutes to examine the safety
information we provide," he said,
"the University as a whole would
be a lot better off."
Some of that information
includes:
• An earthquake action check
list, a one-page summary of the

safest courses of action in the event
of an earthquake. The pamphlet is
routinely distributed to residence
staff, who review it during their
orientation;
• The "Be Quake Safe" pam
phlet, a brief but thorough "before,
during and after" summary of
earthquake procedures. It is pro
vided to all dorm residents when
they pick up their keys;
• The "Perils of Paradise" video,
which contains earthquake educa
tional and procedural information.
It is broadcast on SUNet during
orientation.
In addition to those services, the
University has taken steps to pre
pare for possible disaster condi
tions after a major earthquake.
Dan Smith, Stanford Public
Safety's special services manager,
said the University has buried 12
fiberglass silos at locations around
campus. Each contains enough
food and supplies to sustain 850
people for three days.
Smith added that special RA
kits, containing a flashlight, whis
tle and emergency plans, are dis
tributed to residence staff at the
beginning of the year.
"The ongoing issue regarding
safety is preparedness," Smith
said. "My hope is that, living in
earthquake country, students will
take full advantage of the informa
tion that's offered to them."
But students may not be the
only people who need to take more
responsibility for preparedness.
Keith Guy, acting director of
housing, said the University held a
major "earthquake day" celebrat
ing the first anniversary of Loma
Prieta last year, but no such event
has been planned for this year.
"I just don't think that there's
much incentive for it," Guy said.
"Two years have passed and people
have pretty much forgotten."

The length of the earthquake
orientation for this year's resi
dence staff has been cut from three
hours to 20 minutes, Guy added.
At least a few residence staff
members have their doubts about
their dorms' preparedness for
another major quake.
Junior Mica Martin, an RAin
Rinconada, said she is confident
that she knows the steps to take
after an earthquake, but is con
cerned that other dorm residents
do not.
"Other than being told where
the emergency meeting point is, I
don't think that the freshmen have
actually received much earthquake
training or feel confident about
what they should do," Martin said.
She added that the "Perils of
Paradise" video never aired in Rin
conada.
Lon Berquist, video information
resources coordinator, said he
wasn't sure why some dorms
didn't receive the SUNet broadcast
of the video, but he guessed that it
was a simple problem.
"Probably what happened is
they didn't make sure to check that
the TVs were connected to the
