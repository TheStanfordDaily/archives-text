# Drink, Drank, Drunk
## A 						Comprehensive Guide To The Wonders of Napa Valley 
### Sarah Laurence 
GODS ARE ENDANGERED these days. As the sudden pre
cariousness of the fine arts at Stanford attests, anything that
refuses to submit to science's tenets is labeled unnecessary
or even suspect.
\ Some deities have managed to survive. They are the

towering figures we revere at the dinner table or kneel
before behind closed doors: Knowledge, Material Success,
Multiculturalism, Jerry Garcia and That Volleyball Player
From My Freshman Dorm. Some pantheons.
In our pre-professional furor we've overlooked an
k older, better god, banished from our community by law
V and inclination. He's Dionysus, and he'll kiss with wel

coming grape-stained lips anyone who bothers to
seek him out.
Every student knows how hard it is to get
away from Stanford. Every pitiable commuting
staffer knows how hard it is to get across the
Bay. But, in the words of Robert Plant, that's
the way it's He. The easy, drunken Napa
Valley is a world away from our red-roofed realm,
so you have to accept the trauma of oxygen loss
(or highway carbon monoxide gain, depending
on how you look at it) and extra G-forces during
takeoff.

The important thing is to give yourself plen
r ty of time. It's a good two hours from Wilbur to
wine, and you won't want or be able to rush once
you get there. You'll take slow, silly steps like Neil
Armstrong.
Since most of the valley shuts down at around 5 p.m.,
be sure to leave before noon for a full, leisurely day
k there. Take 1-680; it is probably faster and definitely

less stressful than the more congested north
south routes. But no matter how you go, you'll
be ready for a drink by the time you get up to
California Highway 29 and the town of Napa.
Napa itself doesn't have all that much to
offer. It's a practical, medium-sized town with a
coffee place or two, the last McDonald's for
miles and a chamber of commerce that will give
you whatever bacchanalian information you
need. Napa is a good place to fuel up before

embarking on your orgiastic adventure, but if
you're used to Palo Alto, it's also the moon.
Further up route 29, in Yountville, Ruther
ford and St. Helena is where wineries start flank
ing the highway like astronauts at attention. Turn
ing off at Domaine Chandon, you will find the bas

tard child of the French house Moet et Chandon,
which makes the famous champagne Dom Perignon.
They offer free tours of the whole champagne-making

process â€” except that you can't call it champagne
because that implies unsavory Frenchness. (As if the com
pany's owners weren't French.)

The tour of this "sparkling wine" factory starts in a
little demonstration vineyard where you can stuff your
face with grapes the size and color of blood clots. And it
W gets better.

You step from the heat into a catacomb that's
damp and smelly enough to make you high, and
there are these huge steel tanks. They're full of

wine, and they're too cool to do
anything but sit, presiding over
the cavern. You decide you want
to live here. You'll swim laps in
the tanks and never be sober
again.
If the bat-in-a-former-life
thing applies to you, then visit
subterranean spectacles at
Christian Brothers', whose
famous cellar predates Stanford,
and at Beringer Vineyards,
where the brew is stored in lime
stone caves hand-dug by Chinese
laborers. I hope they at least got
to drink some of it.
And if you like a little adven
ture with your winery tour, try
the Sterling Vineyards. At Ster
ling, you will ride a tram up the
hill to the famous white stucco
winery. The scenery and view of
the valley from atop the hill are
majestic and worth the extra dis
tance you'll have to go to get to
this house.
4 We did our tasting at DeMoor,
a name unknown to my preten
tious wino friends. The vineyard
must be pretty good, though,
since they cleaned up the awards
at the Orange County Fair this
year.
A few words of caution. You
have to shell out $1.50 for a
glass that says DeMoor on it
before they let you start tasting.
And we got carded. Really card
ed. The tasteperson gave us flak
about our Virginia and Ohio IDs,
which weren't even fake. But
she let us keep the glasses.
If you're unfortunate enough
to be under 21, wine tasting is a
minor problem. You tots can
visit Old Faithful and the petri
fied forest near the spa town of
Calistoga. (Yes, that's where
that yuppie water comes from.
They have mud baths too.)
Or you can spend your par
ents' money at Yountville's Vin
tage 1870 shopping center,
housed in an old winery. Or
spend your parents' money on a
fake ID.
But whatever you do, don't
forget to pay homage to Diony
sus. We want the grapes to grow
back next year.
