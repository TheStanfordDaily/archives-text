# Our very own mall celebrates mid-life crisis
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
At the end of my illustrious
high school career, when I was
doing the college-tour thing, I saw
many sights both strange and
bewildering to my virgin eyes. I
saw fire; I saw rain; 1 even saw
vomit moats. But nowhere besides
Stanford did 1 see a mall on cam
pus.
Not only a mall, but a serious
mall. A mall with a Neiman-Mar
cus and a Ralph Lauren. It was
then I realized this was not a col
lege full of work-study students.
But in these days of budget
cuts, we cannot afford to mock the
Stanford Shopping Center, or
what it represents. We desperately
need it to continue siphoning rev
enue from the rich Palo Alto resi
dents into our own greedy little

hands. No, my friends, we cannot
even afford to ask coyly why that
sign at the shopping center reads,
"No bikes on the mall." Oh, but we
can wonder.
And this very week, as we cele
brate National College Alcohol
Awareness Week, National School
Lunch Week and Marie Osmond's
32nd birthday, there is something
far more significant occurring
right on Quarry Road. The Stan
ford Shopping Center's 35th
anniversary.
Yes, that's right, it hardly
seems like the time has passed, but
it's been a full 35 years since the
inception of the place we now call
home.
Believe it or not, in 1956 the
shopping center was no more than a
dairy farm, used primarily for dairy
farming. But in that momentous
year, the Stanford Shopping Center

became the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter. And small children cried.
The shopping center opened
with 45 stores, most of which are
still there: Bank of America,
Edwards Luggage, the Emporium,
Gleim the Jeweler, Hastings, I
Magnin, Johnson and Company
Jewelers, Norneys, Sandy's
Kitchen and Seas Candy were
among the brave purveyors of that
barren, milky landscape.
"I would imagine it would have
been small, and the countryside
would have been much the same
as it is now â€” just a lot more of it.
I'm sure it was very much in the
Stanford tradition," said Lisa
LoVerde, a temporary worker
hired to help organize the mall's
anniversary.
The anniversary celebrations
will commence this weekend, in a
kind of pick-me-up for those who

have post-Centennial depression.
Friday at 6 p.m., song and
dance will be going down at the
Pavilion. (That's the useless, yet
highly aesthetic, area between
Macy's, the Tie Rack, La Baguette
and that PC store that sells tribal
art and makes you wonder how
they stay in business every time
you pass by.)
Music from the last four
decades will be played by the
Cruisetones. You can dance if you
want to.
Saturday and Sunday at 1 and 3
p.m., that very same Pavilion will
house "The Times of our Lives," a
fashion show featuring clothes of
the last four decades.
So, this weekend, put aside some
time from your studying and come
celebrate the 35th anniversary of
the Stanford Shopping Center.
1 am such a whore.
