# Palo Alto's food won't travel
## 
### Mara Winokur Senior staff writer 
To the casual observer, it looks perfectly
normal. There are schools, stores, libraries
and museums. There are young people, old
people, Americans and foreigners. There are
ice cream parlors, frozen-yogurt stores, movie
theaters and bowling alleys.
Perfectly normal, no?
No.
Palo Alto may seem like a normal suburb,
but those of us who live here know different
ly. Normal towns don't shut down at 10 p.m.
Normal towns don't turn off their street
lights at 11 p.m. Normal towns have diners
and all-night coffee shops.
Normal towns have restaurants that deliv
er.
Picture this: It's 8 p.m., and you missed
dinner. You're really hungry. Unfortunately,
you're also without a car. What do you do?
You starve.
OK, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration.
However, compared to other cities in the Unit
ed States (and I'm not just talking about New
York City, Boston and Chicago), Palo Alto has
few places that will bring food to your door.
For example, there is not one single Chi
nese restaurant that has delivery, free or oth
erwise. Not one. Not even half of one. Why?
Well, Jing Jing's (in downtown Palo Alto) has
"no delivery person," Hunan Home's (in
Mountain View, on El Camino) employees
"don't have enough time" and King Chuan's
(at the Town and Country Center) "doesn't
know, sorry."
Chef Chu's (on San Antonio) informed me,
however, that though they have no delivery
service, they sometimes will cater a party if
you are one of their long-time customers. The
reason for this is that Chef Chu himself (there
really is one!) does all the catering. Alone.

And, Su Hong (El Camino Way, Palo Alto)
will deliver orders that are $100 or more.
Probably not what you'd care to spend on din
ner for one. Or even two.
So what about other food? What about, say,
deli?
First of all, you can't get real deli in Cali
fornia, least of all Palo Alto, but that's a dif-

ferent issue. Second of all, no dice. Togo's (on
University Avenue) will deliver if you order a
minimum, which, by the way, they're not sure
of. "Like, five family sandwiches or some
thing. I think," said the Togo's representative
I spoke to. "Over $25 — I think," anothersaid.
In short, they won't just bring over a turkey
sandwich for you. And Fratelli Deli (also on
University) will only transport at least $40
worth of food — and only until 5 p.m.
Subways (there are several on El Camino),
on the other hand won't do anything of the
sort. I asked them why, but they couldn't stop
laughing long enough to tell me.
Chinese is out; deli is out. Mexican? Nada.
French? Non. Russian? Nyet.
What about Italian?
Well, as you may have guessed, you can get
some Italian food delivered, namely, pizza.

Domino's Pizza (all over) delivers all day,
every day, until 1 a.m. on weekdays, 2 a.m. on
weekends. Pizza A Go-Go (University
Avenue) also has all-day delivery, but only
until 11:30 p.m. And Round Table Pizza (Uni
versity) claims to have all-day delivery, but
frequently they're short of delivery people and
don't start until 5 p.m.
Ramona's Too (Birch Street in Palo Alto)
also delivers from 5 to 10:45 p.m., but
requires at least a $7.50 order. However,
Ramona's has calzones, sandwiches and sal
ads in addition to pizza. NY Pizza (on Hamil
ton Street) is a newcomer to the area, and
they deliver from 4 to 10:30 p.m., with a $10
minimum.
Yet even some pizza places don't deliver in
Palo Alto. Star Pizza (El Camino, in Menlo
Park) said they "don't have enough drivers.
Besides, it's hard enough to find your way
around Stanford during the day, forget about
the night." Applewood Inn (a couple of doors
down from Star) said, "It's too expensive!"
And Frankie, Johnny and Luigi's, Too said,
"We're too busy!"
Oh.
Mac Arthur Park delivers, but if you can
afford to go there, you can afford to buy a car.
So, it seems that if you miss dinner, your
choices are limited: You could go to Tresidder
and hope for the best; you could steal some
one's car and hope for the best; or you could
order a pizza.
However, there is some good news. After
you eat, you can get dessert — delivered!
Swensen's (on University) delivers from 11
a.m. until 11:30 p.m., every day. There's a
$7.50 minimum, but the person I spoke to
said if you come close, they'll give it to you. He
also said, "We want all the business on cam
pus!!!"
Given the choices, I don't think he has to
much to worry about.

ferent issue. Second of all, no dice. Togo's (on
University Avenue) will deliver if you order a
minimum, which, by the way, they're not sure
of. "Like, five family sandwiches or some
thing. I think," said the Togo's representative
I spoke to. "Over $25 — I think," anothersaid.
In short, they won't just bring over a turkey
sandwich for you. And Fratelli Deli (also on
University) will only transport at least $40
worth of food — and only until 5 p.m.
Subways (there are several on El Camino),
on the other hand won't do anything of the
sort. I asked them why, but they couldn't stop
laughing long enough to tell me.
Chinese is out; deli is out. Mexican? Nada.
French? Non. Russian? Nyet.
What about Italian?
Well, as you may have guessed, you can get
some Italian food delivered, namely, pizza.

Domino's Pizza (all over) delivers all day,
every day, until 1 a.m. on weekdays, 2 a.m. on
weekends. Pizza A Go-Go (University
Avenue) also has all-day delivery, but only
until 11:30 p.m. And Round Table Pizza (Uni
versity) claims to have all-day delivery, but
frequently they're short of delivery people and
don't start until 5 p.m.
Ramona's Too (Birch Street in Palo Alto)
also delivers from 5 to 10:45 p.m., but
requires at least a $7.50 order. However,
Ramona's has calzones, sandwiches and sal
ads in addition to pizza. NY Pizza (on Hamil
ton Street) is a newcomer to the area, and
they deliver from 4 to 10:30 p.m., with a $10
minimum.
Yet even some pizza places don't deliver in
Palo Alto. Star Pizza (El Camino, in Menlo
Park) said they "don't have enough drivers.
Besides, it's hard enough to find your way
around Stanford during the day, forget about
the night." Applewood Inn (a couple of doors
down from Star) said, "It's too expensive!"
And Frankie, Johnny and Luigi's, Too said,
"We're too busy!"
Oh.
Mac Arthur Park delivers, but if you can
afford to go there, you can afford to buy a car.
So, it seems that if you miss dinner, your
choices are limited: You could go to Tresidder
and hope for the best; you could steal some
one's car and hope for the best; or you could
order a pizza.
However, there is some good news. After
you eat, you can get dessert — delivered!
Swensen's (on University) delivers from 11
a.m. until 11:30 p.m., every day. There's a
$7.50 minimum, but the person I spoke to
said if you come close, they'll give it to you. He
also said, "We want all the business on cam
pus!!!"
Given the choices, I don't think he has to
much to worry about.

To the casual observer, it looks perfectly
normal. There are schools, stores, libraries
and museums. There are young people, old
people, Americans and foreigners. There are
ice cream parlors, frozen-yogurt stores, movie
theaters and bowling alleys.
Perfectly normal, no?
No.
Palo Alto may seem like a normal suburb,
but those of us who live here know different
ly. Normal towns don't shut down at 10 p.m.
Normal towns don't turn off their street
lights at 11 p.m. Normal towns have diners
and all-night coffee shops.
Normal towns have restaurants that deliv
er.
Picture this: It's 8 p.m., and you missed
dinner. You're really hungry. Unfortunately,
you're also without a car. What do you do?
You starve.
OK, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration.
However, compared to other cities in the Unit
ed States (and I'm not just talking about New
York City, Boston and Chicago), Palo Alto has
few places that will bring food to your door.
For example, there is not one single Chi
nese restaurant that has delivery, free or oth
erwise. Not one. Not even half of one. Why?
Well, Jing Jing's (in downtown Palo Alto) has
"no delivery person," Hunan Home's (in
Mountain View, on El Camino) employees
"don't have enough time" and King Chuan's
(at the Town and Country Center) "doesn't
know, sorry."
Chef Chu's (on San Antonio) informed me,
however, that though they have no delivery
service, they sometimes will cater a party if
you are one of their long-time customers. The
reason for this is that Chef Chu himself (there
really is one!) does all the catering. Alone.

And, Su Hong (El Camino Way, Palo Alto)
will deliver orders that are $100 or more.
Probably not what you'd care to spend on din
ner for one. Or even two.
So what about other food? What about, say,
deli?
First of all, you can't get real deli in Cali
fornia, least of all Palo Alto, but that's a dif-
