# Impress your date: Order the right wine and don't drool
## 
### Laura Bialis 
Just as you begin to feel com
fortable — you've rehearsed that
whole start-with-the-fork-on
the-left thing — it happens. And
it happens every time. The
maitre d' walks up and hands
you the wine list. So once again
you make a random choice, loud
ly mispronouncing the French
name, and everyone raises his or
her eyebrows and giggles.
And once again you say, "If I
only knew just a little bit. ..."
Wine. The drink of the gods.
It has been used for medicinal
purposes, religious rites and
trances, Dionysian amusement
and entertainment, and Roman
orgies. It has survived the cen
turies as a companion to food, an
escape from daily problems and a
social tool.
There are three basic types of

wine: natural wine, sparkling
wine and fortified wine. Natural
wine, also known as table wine,
is the variety served with meals.
It has the least alcohol content of
any others, ranging from 8 to 14
percent alcohol.
Sparkling wine — which bub
bles because it contains carbon
dioxide — is most commonly
referred to as champagne. How
ever, the term champagne is
really only for the sparkling
wines which are produced in
Champagne, a region of France.
Fortified wines such as Sherry,
Port, Vermouth and Madeira
usually accompany dessert.
Brandy is usually included in
this group, with an alcohol con
tent ranging from 15 to 24 per
cent.
It is a common myth that red,
rose and white wines are made

from grapes of those respective
colors. But in actuality all grape
juice is usually colorless. The dif
ferent colors are obtained during
the fermenting process. If a rose
colored wine is desired, then the
skins of the grapes are left in
contact during the fermentation
until the proper color is devel
oped. It is the thousands of dif
ferent varieties of grapes that
give the wines different tastes.
Wines are classified in a num
ber of ways. Some use the name
of the town or province where
the grapes are grown — such as
Burgundy or Bordeaux, two of
France's largest wine-growing
regions — while others are
named by the kind of grape
used, such as California's Caber
net Sauvignon or Zinfandel.
Wines are also classified by
their taste — brut (which means

extra dry), dry and sweet. To
produce dry wines, the fermen
tation is carried out until all of
the sugar in the juice has been
fermented. In sweet wines, the
fermentation process is only car
ried halfway, leaving some of the
sugar unfermented.
So which wine should you
choose for your meal? It all
depends on what you are eating.
White table wines go well with
fish, while red wines go well with

meats and cheeses. Vermouth is
used in cocktail drinks while
Sherry, Madeira and Port would
be saved for dessert. And if you
are doing the serving, don't for
get that red wines are served at
room temperature while whites
and roses should be chilled.
Now all you need to do is
brush up on your French. Je
bois, tu bois, il/elle boit, on boit,
nous buuons, vous buvez, ils/elles
boivent. ..."

The beauty of grapes, nature's candy, awes the tourists of Napa Val
ley, many of whom are too short to reach them.
