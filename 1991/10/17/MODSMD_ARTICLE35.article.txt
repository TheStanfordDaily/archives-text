## P.E. strikes black 
### Cheo Coker 
Between the usual breakbeats
and rhymes, country violins and
hearty "yeee-haws!" from some
"Good ol' Boys" somehow end up
in the mix. Bernie Crosshouse, a
self-described Klan member,
interrupts Public Enemy's Chuck
and Flav with this important
message:
"To all you gangs, hoodlums,
drug pushers and users, an' other
worthless niggas killin' each
other, we'd like to thank y'all for
saving us the time, trouble and
legality for the final chapter of rid
din' y'all off of the face of the
earth. Your solution to our prob
lem is greatly appreciated. So keep
sellin' us yo' soul. Thank Ya !"
Excerpts like the above prove
why Public Enemy is one of the
most controversial groups of the
late 20th century. The meaning of
the Bernie Crosshouse segue and
their overall message is simple;
anyone working against black lib
eration and unification is the
enemy, be he the brotherman or
the otherman.
"Apocalypse 91: The Enemy
Strikes Black" finds P.E.'s mes
sage as coherent and lyrically
arresting as ever. The clock that
Flavor Flav wears, counting down
Armageddon for black Americans,
reads 11:59 p.m.
The album is a call for black
unity, stating that unification is
the only defense against the
oppressive external system per

petuating despair and the inter
nal pressures from blacks who
help, not hinder, the downward
spiral. While "Apocalypse 91" by
no means blames the victims for
the current state of affairs, it
doesn't allow them to wallow in
victimization either.
The onslaught of air-raid
sirens, succinct cuts and scratch
es and agitated drum breaks that
characterizes the P.E. "noize"
sound opens "Lost at Birth," the
opening track. Chuck D, "The
Hard Rhymer," Flavor Flav, "The
Juice," and Terminator X, "The
Track Attacker," set the agenda
for the rest of the album, calling
on blacks from the suburbs to the
projects "to find the piece of mind
that has been taken, or else the
black will start breakin.'"
"Nighttrain," the first full
fledged "song" on the album,
introduces the idea that certain
African-Americans work against
their own kind. Over a metal-gui
tar track, reminiscent of "She
Watch Channel Zero," Chuck
warns of the "monkey-trained"
traitor (i.e., dealer, sellout) whose
"face looks just like yours," but is
actually an agent of the enemy.
"You mustn't put your trust in
every brother yo, some don't give
a damn, cause they the other
man."
"Can't Truss It" is a brilliant
recount of the slave trade and the
horror of "middle passage" from
coast to coast. Chuck sums up the
situation nicely over a fat horn
