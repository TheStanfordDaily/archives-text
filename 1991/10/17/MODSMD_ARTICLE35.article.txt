## P.E. strikes black 
### Cheo Coker 
Between the usual breakbeats
and rhymes, country violins and
hearty "yeee-haws!" from some
"Good ol' Boys" somehow end up
in the mix. Bernie Crosshouse, a
self-described Klan member,
interrupts Public Enemy's Chuck
and Flav with this important
message:
"To all you gangs, hoodlums,
drug pushers and users, an' other
worthless niggas killin' each
other, we'd like to thank y'all for
saving us the time, trouble and
legality for the final chapter of rid
din' y'all off of the face of the
earth. Your solution to our prob
lem is greatly appreciated. So keep
sellin' us yo' soul. Thank Ya !"
Excerpts like the above prove
why Public Enemy is one of the
most controversial groups of the
late 20th century. The meaning of
the Bernie Crosshouse segue and
their overall message is simple;
anyone working against black lib
eration and unification is the
enemy, be he the brotherman or
the otherman.
"Apocalypse 91: The Enemy
Strikes Black" finds P.E.'s mes
sage as coherent and lyrically
arresting as ever. The clock that
Flavor Flav wears, counting down
Armageddon for black Americans,
reads 11:59 p.m.
The album is a call for black
unity, stating that unification is
the only defense against the
oppressive external system per

petuating despair and the inter
nal pressures from blacks who
help, not hinder, the downward
spiral. While "Apocalypse 91" by
no means blames the victims for
the current state of affairs, it
doesn't allow them to wallow in
victimization either.
The onslaught of air-raid
sirens, succinct cuts and scratch
es and agitated drum breaks that
characterizes the P.E. "noize"
sound opens "Lost at Birth," the
opening track. Chuck D, "The
Hard Rhymer," Flavor Flav, "The
Juice," and Terminator X, "The
Track Attacker," set the agenda
for the rest of the album, calling
on blacks from the suburbs to the
projects "to find the piece of mind
that has been taken, or else the
black will start breakin.'"
"Nighttrain," the first full
fledged "song" on the album,
introduces the idea that certain
African-Americans work against
their own kind. Over a metal-gui
tar track, reminiscent of "She
Watch Channel Zero," Chuck
warns of the "monkey-trained"
traitor (i.e., dealer, sellout) whose
"face looks just like yours," but is
actually an agent of the enemy.
"You mustn't put your trust in
every brother yo, some don't give
a damn, cause they the other
man."
"Can't Truss It" is a brilliant
recount of the slave trade and the
horror of "middle passage" from
coast to coast. Chuck sums up the
situation nicely over a fat horn
and a funky beat. "Got me layin'
on my back rollin' in my left
over/ when I roll over, I roll over
in somebody elses'. . . Blood in
the wood an' it's mine." Facts
like these make it easier to com
prehend why at times "it's hard
for the black to love the land."
"One Million Bottlebags"
bumrushes the malt-liquor com
panies which market their prod
ucts to black and Hispanic youth
all over America, calling it geno
cide, but also criticizes those
who "drink it like water, on and
on till the stores reorder. They
drink it thinkin' it's good, but
they don't sell the shit in the
white neighborhood, exposin'
the plan they get mad at me I
understand; they're slaves to the
liquor man."
While other stand-out tracks
include "A Letter to The New
York Post" and "Shut Em'
Down," the album by in large
doesn't break any new ground
musically. While the production

(beats, sound bites, cuts, etc.)
and rhymes — both Flav and
Chuck rap with mad flavor —
are miles ahead of most of the
competition, most of the songs
don't sound any different from
anything the group has done on
its previous albums.
Even though there isn't
another "Black Steel in the Hour
of Chaos" or a "Rebel Without a
Pause" on this effort, it doesn't
mean the group has fallen off in
any way, shape or form. "Bring
Tha Noize," a special remake
with Anthrax, and "By the Time
I Get To Arizona" reaffirm the
fact that P.E. hasn't fully for
saken its musical integrity in
favor of its message.
"Apocalypse 91" sets an agen
da that African-Americans must
meet to prevent Chuck D's hypo
thetical Armageddon from
becoming a nightmarish reality.
While the music might not blow
anybody's mind, the message
will open some eyes.
As long as genocide occurs in
the form of black-on-black vio
lence, drug distribution and
abuse and corporate-funded

lechery, groups like Public
Enemy are needed to tell blacks
and whites alike what's going on
in the 'hood. In all hope, the

message won't go unheeded and
give the Bernie Crosshouses of
the world the satisfaction of
being correct.

doesn't break any new ground
musically. While the production

(beats, sound bites, cuts, etc.)
and rhymes — both Flav and
Chuck rap with mad flavor —
are miles ahead of most of the
competition, most of the songs
don't sound any different from
anything the group has done on
its previous albums.
Even though there isn't
another "Black Steel in the Hour
of Chaos" or a "Rebel Without a
Pause" on this effort, it doesn't
mean the group has fallen off in
any way, shape or form. "Bring
Tha Noize," a special remake
with Anthrax, and "By the Time
I Get To Arizona" reaffirm the
fact that P.E. hasn't fully for
saken its musical integrity in
favor of its message.
"Apocalypse 91" sets an agen
da that African-Americans must
meet to prevent Chuck D's hypo
thetical Armageddon from
becoming a nightmarish reality.
While the music might not blow
anybody's mind, the message
will open some eyes.
As long as genocide occurs in
the form of black-on-black vio
lence, drug distribution and
abuse and corporate-funded

lechery, groups like Public
Enemy are needed to tell blacks
and whites alike what's going on
in the 'hood. In all hope, the

message won't go unheeded and
give the Bernie Crosshouses of
the world the satisfaction of
being correct.

Public Enemy's Chuck D, Terminator X and Flavor Fiav hype it up for
their new album, "Apocolypse 91: The Empire Strikes Black."
Between the usual breakbeats
and rhymes, country violins and
hearty "yeee-haws!" from some
"Good ol' Boys" somehow end up
in the mix. Bernie Crosshouse, a
self-described Klan member,
interrupts Public Enemy's Chuck
and Flav with this important
message:
"To all you gangs, hoodlums,
drug pushers and users, an' other
worthless niggas killin' each
other, we'd like to thank y'all for
saving us the time, trouble and
legality for the final chapter of rid
din' y'all off of the face of the
earth. Your solution to our prob
lem is greatly appreciated. So keep
sellin' us yo' soul. Thank Ya !"
Excerpts like the above prove
why Public Enemy is one of the
most controversial groups of the
late 20th century. The meaning of
the Bernie Crosshouse segue and
their overall message is simple;
anyone working against black lib
eration and unification is the
enemy, be he the brotherman or
the otherman.
"Apocalypse 91: The Enemy
Strikes Black" finds P.E.'s mes
sage as coherent and lyrically
arresting as ever. The clock that
Flavor Flav wears, counting down
Armageddon for black Americans,
reads 11:59 p.m.
The album is a call for black
unity, stating that unification is
the only defense against the
oppressive external system per

petuating despair and the inter
nal pressures from blacks who
help, not hinder, the downward
spiral. While "Apocalypse 91" by
no means blames the victims for
the current state of affairs, it
doesn't allow them to wallow in
victimization either.
The onslaught of air-raid
sirens, succinct cuts and scratch
es and agitated drum breaks that
characterizes the P.E. "noize"
sound opens "Lost at Birth," the
opening track. Chuck D, "The
Hard Rhymer," Flavor Flav, "The
Juice," and Terminator X, "The
Track Attacker," set the agenda
for the rest of the album, calling
on blacks from the suburbs to the
projects "to find the piece of mind
that has been taken, or else the
black will start breakin.'"
"Nighttrain," the first full
fledged "song" on the album,
introduces the idea that certain
African-Americans work against
their own kind. Over a metal-gui
tar track, reminiscent of "She
Watch Channel Zero," Chuck
warns of the "monkey-trained"
traitor (i.e., dealer, sellout) whose
"face looks just like yours," but is
actually an agent of the enemy.
"You mustn't put your trust in
every brother yo, some don't give
a damn, cause they the other
man."
"Can't Truss It" is a brilliant
recount of the slave trade and the
horror of "middle passage" from
coast to coast. Chuck sums up the
situation nicely over a fat horn
and a funky beat. "Got me layin'
on my back rollin' in my left
over/ when I roll over, I roll over
in somebody elses'. . . Blood in
the wood an' it's mine." Facts
like these make it easier to com
prehend why at times "it's hard
for the black to love the land."
"One Million Bottlebags"
bumrushes the malt-liquor com
panies which market their prod
ucts to black and Hispanic youth
all over America, calling it geno
cide, but also criticizes those
who "drink it like water, on and
on till the stores reorder. They
drink it thinkin' it's good, but
they don't sell the shit in the
white neighborhood, exposin'
the plan they get mad at me I
understand; they're slaves to the
liquor man."
While other stand-out tracks
include "A Letter to The New
York Post" and "Shut Em'
Down," the album by in large
doesn't break any new ground
musically. While the production

(beats, sound bites, cuts, etc.)
and rhymes — both Flav and
Chuck rap with mad flavor —
are miles ahead of most of the
competition, most of the songs
don't sound any different from
anything the group has done on
