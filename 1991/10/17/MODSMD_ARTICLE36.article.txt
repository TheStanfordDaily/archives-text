# Black Uhuru comes to town today
## 
### Jason Montiel 
The voice of Don Carlos is as
deep and flowing as the beat of
reggae. As lead singer for Black
Uhuru, he speaks with a calm
cadence about the conscious mes
sage of struggle in the music.
"Music in our form is pure,"
said Carlos, talking by phone
from Los Angeles last week. "I
and I have the roots quality;
that's the main thing. We know
that by heart."
Carlos and the original line-up
of Uhuru left their home in
Kingston, Jamaica, and are cur
rently on a four month tour of the
United States, Europe and Japan
promoting their latest release,
"Iron Storm."
While the heart and philosophy
of Uhuru has remained the same
since the band started in the early
'70s, its body has changed many
times.
The original Uhuru, comprised
of Carlos, Garth Dennis and
Duckie Simpson, broke up in 1977
when Carlos went after a solo
career and Garth joined the Wail
ing Souls.
Uhuru's evolution continued
with Simpson and the help of
Michael Rose, Puma Jones and
the Rhythm Twins — Sly and
Robbie. During the early '80s,
albums like "Sensimilla," released
in 1980, and "Red," released in
1981, had smooth harmonies and
a heavy beat — the roots sound
for which the group became best
known.
Then came "The Dub Factor"
in 1983 and "Anthem" in 1984,
albums that Carlos said were
influenced by popular dance
music. These songs were a depar
ture from roots and lacked the
harmonies of the past.
A new sound came on the next
two releases, "Brutal" in 1986

and "Positive" in 1987 with
Junior Reid taking over for Rose
on lead vocals. While harmony
returned, Reid's voice was too flat
to compete with the bass.
That same year, an impromptu
jam session at the Reggae Times
Awards brought together the
original members of Uhuru —
Carlos, Simpson and Dennis. Car
los described the reunion as an
"achievement," marking the first

time they played together since
splitting up years before.
The reunion and the resulting
1990 album, "Now," revived a bal
ance of harmony and instrumen
tal even tighter than the songs of
the early '80s. Cuts like "Army
Band" and "Peace and Love" were
timely comments on war while a
wicked, reggae-fied cover of "Hey
Joe" let guitarist Frank Steponek
get in some great licks.

For Carlos, "Now" and "Iron
Storm" have solidified the unity
of Uhuru. "The more we are
together, the more we shall be,"
he said. "If we are together
singing the same song, then that
is a nice feeling."
"Iron Storm" is full of little
experiments that separate it from
last year's album. The serious,

conscious lyrics are there in
"Bloodshed," while "Trouble"
has a bubbling, positive sound.
But other songs cross the bor
ders of reggae, ranging from
what Carlos calls the "smooth
reggae" of "Colourblind Affair
(FM)" to a rap mix on "Tip of the
Iceberg".
"Tip of the Iceberg" is the
best innovation, beginning with
social commentary on the woes
of man delivered by Uhuru and
capped with a stone-cold cameo
by Ice-T.
Carlos said it was easy for
Uhuru and Ice-T to relate since
the problems of the streets of
Los Angeles and those of
Kingston are similar. "Right
now, what he (Ice-T) is saying is
what we are saying, too," Carlos
said.
After working with Ice-T,
does Uhuru see itself moving
toward the rap-reggae mix of
dance hall? According to Carlos,
probably not. The rhythm is
great, he said, but the raw lyrics
of dance hall lack the real posi

tive message of conscious reggae.
"It's like going to watch a go-go
dancer, a strip dancer," he said.
"Rasta doesn't really promote
those kinds of things."
For Carlos, the future of the
reunited Uhuru looks good.
"The more we are together,
the happier we are. I love peo
ple," he said. "Being around the
people we see is nice, as long as
everyone just keeps cool. As long
as there is peace and harmony
around."
This attitude carries over into
what Uhuru has been saying in
one form or another since the
early '70s.
"The message is peace and
love and harmony among all dif
ferent men," said Carlos. "Right
now, you know, what we would
like to see up in the North is peo
ple to get together and stop hate
and fighting and killing one
another. . . . We must change the
attitude, come together and
learn to respect one another.
Praise Jah, that's the key."

Black Uhuru will appear with
Uprising tonight at The Edge,
260 California Ave., Palo Alto.
Tickets are $14 in advance. Call
