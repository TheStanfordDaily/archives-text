# Bikers beware:
## Violators ticketed

"Would the woman on the bike
please pull over?"
Junior Julia Novy heard these
words and saw flashing police
lights behind her one night last
week while riding home to the
French House on Mayfield Avenue.
Novy's infractions were multi
ple, but not uncommon. She
failed to come to a complete stop
at a stop sign, and her bike was
neither registered nor equipped
with a bike light.
After telling Novy about the
frequency and seriousness of bike
accidents on campus and the need
for bikers to adhere to bike laws
and regulations, the officer issued
her a "fix-it" ticket.
Novy's citation was one of 215
police have given for biking viola
tions so far in 1991. But police say
bikers have gotten off much easi
er this year than they did in 1990,
when Stanford Police issued 657
citations.
"We are way behind on our
bicycle enforcement — way
behind," said Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore.
The reason for this discrepan

cy, Moore explained, is that catch
ing bikers is not a high priority
for police officers, but rather an
"enforcement of convenience."
"If we don't have something
else going on, we work on bicycle
enforcement," he said.
"We've had a lot of activities
lately," Moore said. "As a result,
our statistics are down."
Police issue tickets for two cat
egories of bicycle violations —
mechanical and moving. Fix-it
tickets are issued for mechanical
violations such as not having a
bike light or registration.
A fix-it ticket requires that the
recipient prove to a police officer
or court official that he or she has
taken care of the problem.
Novy said she felt surprised
and angry after being pulled over.
"I feel as though there are a lot
more important things the police
should be looking out for," she
added.
Novy is one of several people
who have been caught at the
intersection in front of the
French House. During a one-hour
period last Thursday, three bikers
were pulled over for not stopping
at the stop sign, although they
were only given warnings.
Two cars that went through
the same stop sign were not
caught.
Although Novy was not fined,
others are not so lucky. Moving
violations may require the
offender to appear in court and
pay a fine.
In the eyes of the law, a bicycle
is a vehicle, and bikers are expect
ed to observe the same rules of
the road as automobiles. If they
fail to do so, they can be punished
just as someone driving an auto,
Moore said.
For example, juniors Damien
Hicks and Jeff Jakubiak were
cycling off-campus last spring
when they were interrupted by
flashing lights and the sound of a
bullhorn. Their fate was worse
than Novy's; the officer gave
them both $20 fines for not stop
ping at a stop sign.
The next day, the same officer
attempted to pull over the entire
Stanford cycling team at the
same place, and managed to fine
five of the cyclists, Jakubiak
said.
In 1991, police have issued 164
mechanical and 51 moving viola
tions.
