# Fire-dog Buggs finds no 'flammable vapors'
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
State and local fire officials
yesterday brought in a dog to help
investigate last week's fire at the
old Delta Tau Delta house, but
the three-hour search turned up
no new leads about its cause.
Buggs, the dog, which belongs
to the state fire marshal's office
and is "trained in locating
flammable vapors residue." He
found no evidence of the use of
accelerants to start the fire, said
Stanford Fire Marshal Ray
Gamma. The dog could not be
used earlier in the investigation

because the fire scene was too hot.
The Delt house burst into
flames at approximately 2 a.m.
Friday. Forty-eight firefighters
reported to the three-alarm fire,
which took about an hour to con
trol. The fire totally destroyed the
house, which was condemned after
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Gamma, Stanford Police Sgt.
Rick Tipton, Palo Alto Fire
Inspector Gary Dufresne and
Cathy Bianchi, the arson and
bomb investigator for the state
fire marshal, picked through the
ruins of the building before
Buggs searched the area.
The cause of the fire is still
"undetermined," Gamma said. He
said, however, that he believes a
person was responsible, either
accidentally or intentionally, for
causing the fire.
Gamma also said he could not
pinpoint the portion of the house
in which the fire started. "Because
of the extensive damage there, it's
pretty hard to tell," he said.
He also said he is unsure how
long the investigation will contin
ue.
In the meantime, a 24-hour
guard has been posted outside
the building, both to protect the
old Synergy house next door and
to keep people out of the fire
area.
"The guard will be maintained
on the premises to protect the
other building," Gamma said.
"We don't want anybody up
there." He added that the area
surrounding the Delt house is
unsafe.
