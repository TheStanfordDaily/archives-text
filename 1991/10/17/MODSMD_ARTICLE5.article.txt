# Fire-dog Buggs finds no 'flammable vapors'
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
State and local fire officials
yesterday brought in a dog to help
investigate last week's fire at the
old Delta Tau Delta house, but
the three-hour search turned up
no new leads about its cause.
Buggs, the dog, which belongs
to the state fire marshal's office
and is "trained in locating
flammable vapors residue." He
found no evidence of the use of
accelerants to start the fire, said
Stanford Fire Marshal Ray
Gamma. The dog could not be
used earlier in the investigation

because the fire scene was too hot.
The Delt house burst into
flames at approximately 2 a.m.
Friday. Forty-eight firefighters
reported to the three-alarm fire,
which took about an hour to con
trol. The fire totally destroyed the
house, which was condemned after
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
