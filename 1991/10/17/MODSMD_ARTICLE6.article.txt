# Confirmation sparks discussion, criticism
## 
### Chris Brazell 
In the aftermath of Clarence
Thomas' confirmation to the
Supreme Court, students and a few
alumni voiced concern about the
Senate's handling of sexual-harass
ment allegations during a forum
held yesterday at the Women's
Center.
Called "Racism and Sexism: at
the Crossroads," the discussion
focused primarily on University of
Oklahoma Law Prof. Anita Hill's
allegations of sexual harassment
and Thomas' responses. However,
the conversation also delved into
the fairness of the confirmation
hearings and their consequences
for blacks and women.
About 25 people were present,
20 of whom were women.
Although there was an overall
consensus that Hill was badgered
by her interrogators in the Sen
ate, there was some disagreement

as to why. Senior Angela Hilton
said, "I think she was condemned
for not being the stereotypical
'weak' woman."
Senior Maggie Harrison dis
agreed. "I think she was attacked
because they felt that someone of
her independent character should
have come forward earlier with
out fear of criticism," she said.
One concern brought up in the
forum was that the black commu
nity will be negatively affected by
this episode. In particular, some
participants said they felt that the
relations between black males and
black females may be strained in
the future.
They also said they regretted that
the careers of two black profession
als had been tarnished and carica
tured in the wake of the hearings.
Some participants were pleased
that the topic of sexual harass
ment has been placed in the
national spotlight.
