# Quake dream eerily came true

### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Modern geologists are work
ing feverishly to find a scientific
way to predict earthquakes. But
they might be better off using a
simpler method: asking junior
Michael Franz about his dreams.
The night of Oct. 16, 1989,
Franz — then a freshman at
Stanford — says he had "one of
the most vivid and real dreams I
ever remember."
In the dream, he was standing
in the Quad with a good friend of
his, when suddenly a major
earthquake hit — he remembers
that it was a 6.9 quake, the
strength originally reported for
Loma Prieta

"Things were falling down
and people were getting killed,"
Franz says. "My friend and I
crouched under one of the arch
es and weren't hurt."
Troubled, Franz woke up at 4
a.m. Oct. 17 and began reading
the earthquake preparation
brochures that had been dis
tributed a couple days before.
Later that afternoon he went
to Memorial Church, to attend a
harp player's interpretation of
the works of Sappho for his CIV
class. The performance ended at
about 5 p.m.
Then, Franz said, "as we were
walking out of the foyer, the
earthquake hit."
The situation was eerily simi
lar to his dream. Plaster was

falling from the ceiling, glass was
breaking, the arches in the Quad
were swaying — and the same
friend who had been in Franz's
dream was standing next to him.
W I was sort of wigged out,"
Franz said.
As he thought about his
dream over the next few days, he
wondered whether he was psy
chic. But eventually, he came to
a more reasonable conclusion.
"I think it's because the earth
quake brochures had been hand
ed out a day or two before my
dream," he said. "Earthquakes
were just in my mind — it was
probably a freak coincidence."
But, for the record, Franz
says he has not had any more
earthquake dreams.
