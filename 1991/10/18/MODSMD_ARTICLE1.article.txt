# Tuition increase lower
## 
### Anna Buchmann 
Stanford's tuition increase this
year was well under the national
average for both public and pri
vate schools, according to a study
released Wednesday by the Col
lege Board.
Tuition rose 5.75 percent at
Stanford this year, from $14,280
to $15,102. Nationally, the aver
age increase was 7 percent for pri
vate and 12 percent for public
schools.
Last year, Stanford's tuition
increase of 5.5 percent compared
with an 8 percent increase nation
wide for other private universities.
However, as the Cabinet Com
mittee on Budget and Strategic
Planning finalizes budget-reduc
tion targets this week, Stanford's
tuition policy is one of the issues
on the table.
Provost James Rosse declined to
comment on the Committee's
tuition decision, which will be
announced along with other targets
at a public address on Tuesday.
Rosse did say, however, that
Stanford has made a "deliberate
policy" effort to keep tuition down
over the past two years. Yearly
tuition increases prior to the poli
cy were as high as 8 percent.
Stanford's tuition has dropped
substantially below that of "the
competition," Rosse added.
Charles Kruger, deputy chair
of the Cabinet, said that as a
result of the cap on tuition, Stan
ford has dropped from its stand
ing as one of the top five most
expensive schools in the nation,
and is now ranked 14th.
"We thought we were leading
the pack (by slowing tuition
increases), but we turned around
and nobody was following us,"
Kruger said.
William Tingley, the associate
dean of undergraduate admis
sions, said the level of interest in
Stanford "seems to be high" this
year among high school students.
Rising costs have not affected
undergraduate admissions in a
negative way, he said.
Council of Presidents member
John Louie also said the Universi
ty's commitment "to make Stanford
accessible to many different sectors
of the population" is important.
Beth Morgan, another mem
ber of the Council of Presidents,
contrasted Stanford's 5.75 per
cent tuition increase with the sys
tem-wide 40 percent increase for
the University of California.
