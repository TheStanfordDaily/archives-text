# Bush: Thomas hearings offensive to families
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Bush said
Thursday that sexual harassment accusations
against Clarence Thomas should not have been aired
in nationally televised hearings and were "deeply
offensive to American families."
"1 wish that the country had been spared some of
the detail," Bush said, suggesting the charges
should have been examined by the Senate Judiciary
Committee behind closed doors.
Bush also predicted Thomas will be an indepen
dent justice.
"I believe he is going to surprise some who think
they know exactly where he stands on every single
social issue," the president said. Thomas' critics had

complained he tried to mask the conservative views
he embraced while serving in the Reagan adminis
tration.
Through a televised hookup, Bush discussed
Thomas' case in response to a question after an
address to an Associated Press Managing Editors
meeting in Detroit.
While decrying "the messy situation" that had
enveloped Thomas, Bush said the ordeal raised
Americans' consciousness about the problem of sex
ual harassment against women.
"Maybe, even though a lot of it was deeply offen
sive to American families across this country, with
its graphic detail, maybe something good will come

out of it, and by that I mean a sensitizing of the pop
ulace to the problem, the legitimate problem of sex
ual harassment," Bush said.
He shrugged off feminists and civil rights groups
that had opposed the nomination, saying they
weren't representative of women and black
Americans.
Thomas was confirmed to the high court
Tuesday on a 52-48 vote, overcoming allegations
by law Professor Anita Hill that he made
unwanted advances and lewd remarks 10 years
ago when she worked for him at the Education
Department and Equal Employment Oppor
tunity Commission.
