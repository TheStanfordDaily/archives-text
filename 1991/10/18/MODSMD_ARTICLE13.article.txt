# Congress working to drop ban on abortion counseling

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - House-
Senate negotiators tentatively agreed
to legislation yesterday lifting a ban on
abortion counseling at federally
financed clinics, despite a veto threat
from President Bush.
The bargainers also dropped a sepa
rate provision that would have
required many teen-age girls to notify
their parents before receiving abor
tions from clinics or organizations that
receive federal aid.
The decisions were made as lawmak
ers from the two chambers tried to fash
ion a compromise $204 billion spending
bill for fiscal 1992 for the departments of
Health and Human Services, Education

and Labor. The fiscal year began Oct. 1.
The bargainers, who plan to finish
their work on the bill next Tuesday,
said decisions on the abortion provi
sions might not be final. However,
changes seemed unlikely.
The agreement to try to lift the ban
on abortion counseling was no surprise,
because both the House and Senate had
separately voted for the language.
The effort is aimed at voiding a 1988
Reagan administration ban on abortion
counseling the Supreme Court upheld
in May. Bush has said he would reject
the bill if it revokes the counseling ban.
The parental notification provision
that the bargainers killed had been

approved by the Senate last month on
a 92-8 vote.
The language, proposed by Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., had been a
compromise between anti-abortion
and abortion-rights lawmakers. But it
was opposed by members of interest
groups from both sides of the issue
who felt the measure went either too
far or not far enough.
The measure required that a parent
be notified at least 48 hours before a
girl younger than 18 could get an abor
tion at any facility getting federal fam
ily planning assistance.
But exceptions were available for
health emergencies or if professional

counselors certified that notifying the
parent would risk harm to the girl.
The notification requirement would
also not have applied in states that
have their own such laws or have voted
against them. That would have put it
in effect in just nine states, anti-abor
tion lobbyists said.
The bargainers also dropped
Senate-passed language that would
have allowed federally financed abor
tions for women who were victims of
rape or incest. Congress has tried
repeatedly to liberalize abortion law
with such language, but veto threats
from Bush and President Reagan have
blocked the path every time.
