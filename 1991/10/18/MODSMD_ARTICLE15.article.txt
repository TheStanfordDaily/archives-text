## A 						Nobel gesture 
### 
The latest peace prize
recipient stands as a
symbol of quiet courage

IN THE AGE OF INSTANT
communications and wide
spread democratic revolution, it
reeks of Orwellian irony that
Burma's military dictators may
have prevented the winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize from even hear
ing about her award.
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has
been living under house arrest for
more than two years, was awarded
the prize Monday for her central
leadership in Burma's democratic
opposition.
The 46-year-old daughter of U
Aung San, the founder of modern
Burma who was assassinated in
1947, leapt into political promi
nence in 1988 when pro-democracy
protests in Burma were crushed by
the military, leaving thousands
dead.
Showing enormous grace under
pressure, she peacefully resisted the
armed forces and became the cen
tral opposition figure in the country
as the general secretary of the
National League for Democracy.
Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest
began in July 1989, and she has not
been able to see her husband or her
two children since then.
The lax response to the Nobel
Committee's attempt to pressure
Burma, now called Myanmar, by
giving the prize to its leading dissi
dent, has been disturbing. The
international community, moments
ago captivated by radical changes in
the Soviet Union, seems too dis
tracted to advocate democracy
based on principle and not only self
interest.
International reaction when Pol
ish Solidarity leader and now Presi
dent Lech Walesa received the Nobel
Peace Prize was much more intense.
Some U.S. pressure has come in
the form of Voice of America broad
casts into Burma. But more is needed.

There is no freedom of the press
in Burma. There is no CNN in hotel
lobbies. And the ruling government
has not mentioned anything about
the Nobel Prize inside the country.
Voice of America, which Soviet and
East European dissidents said was a
primary source of news during their
more than four decades of heavy gov
ernment censorship, is attempting to
break the news blockade.
But Myint Myint Caw Lin, chief
supervising editor of Voice of Amer
ica's Burmese language broadcast
ing service, says she's not sure the
pro-democracy leader has yet heard
about the award despite the organi
zation's intensified news coverage
in the broadcasts.
"I don't know if she knows yet....
I don't know if she can tune in and lis
ten," she said.
Many Burmese citizens probably
have heard the news, though. VOA
received over 25,000 letters from
inside Burma last year, containing
everything from political comment
to birthday-song dedication requests.
"They are probably happy inside
â€” quietly," Myint Myint Caw Lwin
said.
"In our country, of course they
have to (keep their happiness
inside). Otherwise they will be
detained."
The massive anti-government
demonstrations forced the govern
ment to agree to hold parliamentary
elections in May 1990. Of the avail
able seats, Aung San Suu Kyi's party
won 392 0f485 seats, but the military
regime refused to turn over power.
The United States can do more to
pressure the regime, including giving
direct financial support to Burmese
democrats who are attempting to
build a civil society in their home
land. Money is needed to purchase
fax and Xerox machines and printing
presses if the burgeoning democratic
opposition is to compete with the
state's repressive apparatus.
The United States should also
restrict Burma's trading privileges
as added pressure for reform.
It is the least we can do for Aung
San Suu Kyi as she sits quietly,
locked in her home.
