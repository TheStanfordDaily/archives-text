Flier reveals undercurrent of multicultural backlash

WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS,
the term "multiculturalism" has
taken on seemingly negative
connotations here at Stanford. Many
students cringe at the mere mention of
the word, complaining they are being
"force-fed" ideas that differ sharply from
what they've been taught since birth.
Such attitudes inevitably result in a
backlash from the very community that
Stanford's multiculturalism is attempt
ing to educate.
A comprehensive multicultural
approach to education is absolutely
essential for the well-being of the stu
dent body. Without it, simple cultural
expressions may be grossly miscon
strued, leading to unnecessary tensions.

A Daily editorial (Oct. 16) touched on
this issue, and we wish to further this
discussion.
Recently, due to a misunderstanding
that resulted from ignorance, many
members of the Stanford community
took offense at an artistic expression
originating from Omega Psi Phi. We
intended to offend no one. In fact, the
image in question served to provide posi
tive support for those engaged in the
ongoing struggle to end oppression.
While we did not expect everyone to
understand the significance of the image
of an African warrior, sword in hand,
holding the severed head of the oppres
sor, we realized that this image would
not cause fear within the Stanford com-

munity.
Had the individuals on the flier been
reversed, however, the results would
have been entirely different. By placing
the head of a black man in the hand of
the oppressor, one creates an all-too-real
metaphor, which, unlike our flier, would
invoke a great deal of fear.
This metaphor becomes even more
vivid when one replaces the sword with a
shotgun and transforms the omega
brands to badges. Now you have an
image so real that you can see it nearly
every night on the evening news â€” police
brutality aimed at African-Americans.
The effects of such a reversal would
invoke similar fears in other oppressed
groups as well. Does the University

apply an unfair racial double standard
by tolerating our flier while condemning
the existence of these hypothetical rever
sals? Indeed not.
We applaud the editors of The Daily
for raising the key question, "Why do
certain populations still feel oppressed
and discriminated against?" Moreover,
we respond to their call for open dia
logue by announcing our Achievement
Week programs, a series of workshops
and discussions aimed at answering that
very question. This year, Achievement
Week will be held Nov. 10-17, and every
one is encouraged to attend all of the
programs offered.
