# The
						Daily editorial board must swallow its mistaken words
## 
### 
Jeers to The Daily for devoting multi
ple vacuous editorials to criticizing the
ASSU budget recommendations, which
it didn't even deign to print.
The Daily's cynical, "we-know-it-all"
attitude is one of the most damaging
components in the attack against stu
dent input. To print this tripe on the
day the University Cabinet decision was
made seems a clear attempt to legit
imize the lack of consideration given to
student priorities.
While $40 million of cuts are not
explicitly outlined, the recommendations
outlined the foremost priorities of the
student body as a whole. Issues not
mentioned in the document are not
viewed as central to the Stanford experi
ence.
The Daily's attacks on specific recom
mendations are particularly ironic.
When specific cuts were suggested, The

Daily could not resist the same pork-bar
rel special interest whining of which its
own editorial accuses the ASSU.
If The Daily's editorial has suggested
$40 million of cuts, we offer to eat a
Daily.
