# Bravery of alleged rape victim provides needed opportunity for change
## 
### 
I would like personally to thank the
young woman who has bravely chosen to
press charges against the man who
allegedly raped her in a dorm last
month. I can only imagine how painful it
is to be victimized in this way — first by
one's attacker and then by the press and
the courts.
I applaud all who have made similar
sacrifices in order to make our world a
better and safer place. The opportunity
for introspection presented by such sac
rifices should not be wasted.

To the men: You have the opportuni
ty to see the disastrous impact that such
actions have on the lives of all con
cerned. Now is the time to change the
ideas and behaviors that lead to this dev
astation.
To the women: Any act that is a product
of force or coercion is a wrongful one.
Don't let anyone tell you something differ
ent.
To the people at the Office of Judicial
Affairs: It is time you become a part of
the solution, rather than another
painful symptom of the problem. It is
time to give the issue the prioritization
it deserves. We are watching and wait
ing.
Finally, to the alleged rapist's
fiancee: Yours is perhaps the most
unique opportunity of all. You have
been given the chance to avoid making
the biggest mistake of your life.
Thanks to the courage of this young
victim, you have seen how this man
views women and how he defines "com
mitment." Don't become another vic
tim.
