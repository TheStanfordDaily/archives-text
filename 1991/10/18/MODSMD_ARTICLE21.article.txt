## Kathleen Mallery How many stories have yet to be told ? 
### 
THERE IS USUALLY NO conversa
tion in the women's locker room at
deGuerre Pool. Hairdryers and
showers fill the silence as women change
into and out of swimsuits. But on Mon
day, the day before the U.S. Senate voted
to confirm Clarence Thomas' nomination
to the Supreme Court, it was difficult to
follow one story; so many were being told.
One older woman wearing only flip-flops
repeated, "They just don't understand."
Another woman asserted as she took
off her clothes that she was "taken into
her boss' office and humiliated," until she
wanted to leave. Three women wearing
towels on their heads listened.
Another shared that she was recently
laid off. She wondered what had happened
to several other women who had just "dis
appeared" and discovered they, too, had
been laid off. No men were let go.
Although the ages ranged from 18 to
65, almost all had swimsuit tans, and had
something to tell. The ones who were
silent nodded knowingly. For the first
time in that locker room, women were
talking.
In other places around campus, women
broke the silence. In a sophomore common
room, several girls sat around and shared
their experiences.
Nina Schou, 19, worked at her father's
law firm this past summer where she fre
quently received comments such as, "Nice
short skirt, Nina." She said, "It made me

feel self-conscious about what I wore.
Because my Dad worked there, they
wouldn't dare go any further. But imagine
if he hadn't worked there?"
Another student, Kerry McCoy, told of
her summer job working in a cherry
orchard: "This guy I worked for this sum
mer, about my parents' age, was always
talking explicitly about sex. It made me
uncomfortable, but I would never want to
report this guy. I can completely identify
with Anita Hill."
Several of the girls described a frequent
problem that occurs often at crowded Stan
ford parties. One said, "Being groped is just
too much. It happens all the time. It was
really crowded, and I felt two hands grab
my butt. It really was disgusting. I bolted."
Most of the stories being offered are in
informal meeting places such as locker
rooms and dormitories. Stanford has
many formal services for handling sexual
harassment. Members of the Stanford
community can file complaints at the
Employee Relations Office.
Anne Peterson at Employee Relations
said Hill's allegations have not "instigated a
rush of people coming in saying 'I've been
sexually harassed.'" She added, "A lot of
times we don't know [about sexual harass
ment because it doesn't get this far."
Other avenues through which people can
discuss sexual harassment include Cowell
Student Health Center's counseling service,
the Office of the Dean of Students and dif

ferent deans and residential advisers.
Despite all of the services available,
women when confronted with sexual
harassment have traditionally chosen
silence. The recent flood of stories that
happened years ago suggests the formal
systems are not effective.
Whether women will continue to tell
their stories is unknown. The vote of con
firmation may tell women their stories are
considered fantasies and that speaking out
only invites criticism. But even though
Thomas was confirmed, women, encour
aged by the informal listeners, may con
tinue to put words to their experiences.
The complete impact of the Senate's
vote, however, may not be felt for years.
At TTing Nursery School, it's stoiy time
every afternoon. Unaware of the Hill-
Thomas controversy, the toddlers put down
their shovels and bubble-making baskets to
listen to familiar stories. Teachers and par
ents who help out at the nursery have
agreed not to discuss the sexual-harassment
case when they are in the presence of the
children. But these are the children this
charged event and the stories it has uncov
ered may most dramatically impact.
"You're a baby!" one 2-year-old boy
yelled at a 2-year-old girl. She started to
cry. The question is: Will she be able to
tell, and if she does, who will believe her?
