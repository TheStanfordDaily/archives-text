## Streaking soccer sets sight on Santa Clara Women shoot to extend unbeaten streak 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
If you're in the mood to roadtrip, but don't feel like driv
ing all the way down to Los Angeles, it might be a good idea
to get your butt over to Santa Clara tonight to watch the
undefeated women's soccer team in what may be its biggest
regular-season game in history.
In fact, making that pilgrimage would be a great idea even
if you hadn't planned on leaving the Farm this weekend. In
the women's soccer program, Stanford has one of the most
exciting teams in the country in any sport.
They will square off against the No. 5 Broncos at 8 p.m.
tonight at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium. The game will
immediately follow the men's Cardinal-Bronco match.
Stanford held fast at No. 6 in the rankings this week. After

beating the Cavaliers of Virginia, 2-0, Monday — in yet
another lopsided contest — the Cardinal should move up in
the rankings, if it wins tonight.
Although it's hard for any team with a ranking as lofty as
Stanford's to feel shortchanged in any way, watching this
team play makes one thing perfectly clear — this is one of, if
not the, best teams in the country. The squad has proven it
by decimating teams in the top 10 and deserves to be com
pared with the small handful of other undefeated teams in
the country.
As Stanford looks for its fourth straight win and shutout
over a top 15 opponent, its undefeated record and dominat
ing play are signs of a team with serious designs on the
NCAA Championship.

cos, reeling from back-to-back losses, will look to exploit any Stanford lapses.
The Cardinal is coming off a
five-game homestand in which it
did not allow a goal, extending its
team-record single-season win
ning streak to 12 games.
This streak has left the team
extremely confident despite their
underdog status going to Santa
Clara. "Considering the circum
stances, you'd think that I'd be
scared, but I'm really not," said

goalkeeper Leslie Garrard, who
has gone 11 periods without giv
ing up a goal. "We've been playing
very confidently. We just need to
be focused and ready to play."
Sophomore midfielder Jen
Gardiner agrees that the Cardinal
has a great chance of "upsetting"
the Broncos, who are coming of a
5-0 loss to the No. 1 North Caroli
na Tar Heels and a 1-0, double
overtime defeat at the hands of
Virginia. "As long as we stay com
posed and avoid all other distrac
tions, like the jeering of the fans,
we'll be all right."
