# Win could push men into national rankings

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It was supposed to be the dream
matchup for the up-and-coming Stan
ford men's soccer team. The unranked
Cardinal (8-2-3), riding a four-game
winning streak, was to head into Santa
Clara tonight to face the ultimate test:
the undefeated and No. 1 Broncos.
A dream matchup, that is, until
Santa Clara (12-1) lost on Tuesday to
the University of San Francisco by a
convincing 3-0 margin. After being
handed their first defeat of the season,
the Broncos come into tonight's game
with a chip on their shoulder â€” much

to the dismay of Cardinal coach Colin
Lindores.
"If I had my druthers, USF wouldn't
have beaten them," Lindores said.
"They've been stung. It's always nice to
go against No. 1. If you lose by a goal,
your program gains recognition. If you
tie, you gain recognition. If you win,
you gain recognition. It would have
been a no-lose situation."
None of this, of course, is meant to
downplay the extreme importance of
tonight's matchup for Stanford. First,
there is a certain revenge factor carry
ing over from last season's 2-2 tie to the
Broncos. "We were robbed | last year] by
a referee who didn't see a handball that

allowed Santa Clara to tie it," Lindores
said. "It was a very disappointing tie."
There's also the fact that, despite
their loss to USF on Tuesday, the Bron
cos are one of the best teams in the
country and have been for a long time,
the Notre Dame of the soccer world. So
far in 1991, Santa Clara has outscored
its opponents by a whopping 44-9 mar
gin.
Finally, with the NCAA Tournament
only a month away, every game takes
on an increasing importance for the
Cardinal. Stanford competes as an inde
pendent in men's soccer, which puts
