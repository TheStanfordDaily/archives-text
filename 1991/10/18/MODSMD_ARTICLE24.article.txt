# Win could push men into national rankings
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It was supposed to be the dream
matchup for the up-and-coming Stan
ford men's soccer team. The unranked
Cardinal (8-2-3), riding a four-game
winning streak, was to head into Santa
Clara tonight to face the ultimate test:
the undefeated and No. 1 Broncos.
A dream matchup, that is, until
Santa Clara (12-1) lost on Tuesday to
the University of San Francisco by a
convincing 3-0 margin. After being
handed their first defeat of the season,
the Broncos come into tonight's game
with a chip on their shoulder — much

to the dismay of Cardinal coach Colin
Lindores.
"If I had my druthers, USF wouldn't
have beaten them," Lindores said.
"They've been stung. It's always nice to
go against No. 1. If you lose by a goal,
your program gains recognition. If you
tie, you gain recognition. If you win,
you gain recognition. It would have
been a no-lose situation."
None of this, of course, is meant to
downplay the extreme importance of
tonight's matchup for Stanford. First,
there is a certain revenge factor carry
ing over from last season's 2-2 tie to the
Broncos. "We were robbed | last year] by
a referee who didn't see a handball that

allowed Santa Clara to tie it," Lindores
said. "It was a very disappointing tie."
There's also the fact that, despite
their loss to USF on Tuesday, the Bron
cos are one of the best teams in the
country and have been for a long time,
the Notre Dame of the soccer world. So
far in 1991, Santa Clara has outscored
its opponents by a whopping 44-9 mar
gin.
Finally, with the NCAA Tournament
only a month away, every game takes
on an increasing importance for the
Cardinal. Stanford competes as an inde
pendent in men's soccer, which puts
them at a distinct disadvantage
for the playoffs. While conference
winners receive automatic passes
into the event, the Cardinal can
only hope to impress enough
members of the NCAA Tourna
ment Committee to receive an at
large bid.
Lindores stressed this last
point. "From this point on, we, as
an independent, must win every
game." Goalie Kyle Krpata
agreed. "We're entering a crucial
stretch of the season," the junior
said. "We've got to bear down and
beat teams like Santa Clara."
Despite Santa Clara's lofty
national ranking, tonight's
matchup figures to be a close one.
"It's one of those games where
you throw the book away," Lin
dores said. "We've proved this
year that we can play with the big
boys." As usual, though, the
coach was not impressed with his

squad's practicing this week.
"They're looking bloody awful
right now," Lindores said.
"Their minds are wandering all
over the place."
A win tonight would almost
definitely move the Cardinal into
some unfamiliar territory — the
national rankings. While Stan
ford is currently ranked No. 7 in
the West, five of the six teams
above them are in the national
top 25. "We're in a real tough
region [the West]," Lindores
said. "If we beat Santa Clara
then I'd be extremely surprised if
we didn't crack the top 25."
Tonight's game is the first of a
Cardinal-Bronco soccer double
header. After the men's 6 p.m.
match, the women hit the field at
8 p.m. in a matchup of two top
-10 teams. More than anything
else, Lindores urged Stanford
fans to come out to Santa Clara.
"We'll need some of our fans out
there," the coach said. "There
will be enough of those Santa
Clara animals out there."
