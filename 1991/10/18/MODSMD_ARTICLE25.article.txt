# 'Polo needs wins

### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Before the season began, the Stanford water
polo team knew that this weekend would be one
of its most important of the year, but the team
couldn't have known just how critical it now is.
Or, for that matter, how busy it is.
You see, not only will the Cardinal have to
travel down to Los Angeles to play No. 2 UCLA
today and No. 6 USC tomorrow, but the team
will then come back to Stanford on Sunday to
take part in what should be a special game
against the Mladost Club team from Zagreb
who are representing the republic of Croatia.
And while this last game will not mean too
much for the Cardinal's NCAA tournament
hopes, the other two matches are extremely cru
cial for Stanford to win. NCAA rules stipulate
that only five teams from California can go to
the NCAA tournament at the end of the year,
and right now, the No. 7 Cardinal is, not sur
prisingly, the No. 7 team from California.
Only once in the last 17 years — in 1983 —
has Stanford failed to qualify for the tourna
ment, and if this year's team does not want to
become the second, victories this weekend are
almost essential.
As coach Dante Dettamanti said, "These next
two weekends will really tell the tale for our
team. It's an unusual position for us to be in,
and we've just got to respond."
And as if all this wasn't enough pressure,
there will be two new starters for the Cardinal
this weekend. Two freshmen — hole man Frank
Schneider and goalkeeper Jack Bowen — will be
making their first starts of the year and will join
classmate Wolf Wigo to give Stanford three
freshmen in the starting lineup.
Dettamanti is not eager to have so many
young players in the pool, but nevertheless, he
felt the change was necessary. "We just haven't
gotten the performance from some of the older
guys," Dettamanti said. "It's something that
just had to be done, and we'll see how it works
out this weekend."
Not only will this be Bowen's first start, but
it will also be his first varsity game ever. Com
ing out of high school, Bowen was the top goalie
in the country, and Dettamanti is confident that
he can and will enjoy equal success on the col
lege level. "It's sort of a tough way to initiate
