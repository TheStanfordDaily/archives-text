# George leads Cardinal to Trojanland
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Ron George could be the best
college football player that was
almost never created. Heading
into this Saturday's game against
USC, George is Stanford's lead
ing tackier and most imposing
defensive threat the Cardinal pre
sents against what is sure to be
an explosive Trojan running
game.
"• Ron George is a man whom
USC coach Larry Smith is forced
to respect, and whom Stanford
coach Denny Green has come to
rely upon. The 6-foot-2, 220-
pound outside linebacker is a very
good football player, but it could
just as easily not have happened.
Because of his father's job,
George grew up in West Ger
many, where football is king, but
only because Europeans use the
name for a sport that it really fits
the title. American football, the
one with pads and the oblong ball,
was more of a joke than a sport
for young Ron.
"I hadn't thought about play
ing (college) football in Ger
many," George said. "I had
played football for one year really.
I was on the team as a sopho
more, never saw the field. I was
on the team as a junior, never saw
the field. Me and a friend of mine
made a little bench and put it on
our (varsity) jackets 'cause we
never saw the field."
Playing tight end and defen
sive end for Heidelberg American
High School, George finally
caught a glimpse of the field as a
senior, making a pretty good
impression along the way. That
year he made All-Europe with 37
solo tackles, 35 assists, six sacks,
two blocked punts and two fum
ble recoveries. He was also the
188-pound European high school
wrestling champion. Ron
George's athletic skills were not
hidden, but that does not mean

he got any attention.
"Out of high school, they
didn't recruit football players in
Germany," George said. "Foot
ball players in Germany are like
basketball players in India or
something."
Yet the Rhineland can produce
more than a good sausage. George
made his way to the Air Force
Academy and played on the team,
but was not thinking football. He
was thinking he wanted to leave.
"You couldn't concentrate (at
Air Force) because you were
always thinking 'I should be
doing this, I should be doing
that,"' George said. "So I figured
maybe I should go to a school
where I should concentrate on
one thing.
"I didn't really think about
playing football. It got me out of a
lot of stuff, that was the main rea
son I played football. It got me
out of formation; it wasn't that I
was so enamored with football.
Once I left, I never thought I'd do
it again."
Ron had gotten into Stanford
after high school — and after
realizing it had more to offer than
Harvard — found himself far
from Germany, but a lot closer to
big time college football. Brought
in as a cornerback, George was
transferred over to linebacker
and spent his NCAA-imposed red
shirt year learning the ropes.
With his natural talent and drive,
he found his way up the depth
chart — and when then-starter
Chris Hawkins suffered a career
ending injury — Ron George was
the man. The rest, as they say, is
history.
"When I got to start junior
year against Colorado, I was on
the field and I was thinking, 'I
can't believe it.' I thought it was a
dream," George said. "It was
something I had never planned
on, something I had never

dreamed of because it wasn't in
my mind. Everything that hap
pens now is just more icing on the
cake. It was a dream come true."
George is now living the
dream, he not only earned honor
able mention All-Conference hon
ors, but was also second in the
league in quarterback sacks, and
led the Pac-10 in tackles-for-loss.
He started all 11 games for the
Cardinal, recording 63 total tack
les and 10 quarterback sacks.
After five games this year, George
leads the team with 33 total tack
les and has the team's only two
quarterback sacks.
"I think he is an excellent foot
ball player," Smith said. "He runs
very well, he is very tough. I know
that Stanford has pushed him for
All-Conference, and he is for sure
that. He is a complete lineback
er." Big, strong, tough, physical,
and he can run."
George is still maturing as a

player. He admits that he is still
seeing new defenses, still hearing
plays he never thought existed.
There are others who have played
longer, but Ron is showing that it
is not always age that comes
before athletic beauty. He has a
basic philosophy, and with it has
come success.
"Play hard. It's that simple
and it's that complex," said
George. "Play hard means you are
physical, you are intense, you
read and react. If I can every play,
do what I'm supposed to do, do
what [the coaches] tell me to do,
then that is good football."
Right now Ron George is play
ing good football, and hopefully it
will keep getting better. For the
man who plays the game, it defi
nitely will. Football is a new love,
and the courtship has only begun.
"Every day football becomes a
little more important," George
said. "It is more fun today than it
was yesterday, and it is going to
be more fun next week than it is
this week. Twenty-four hours a
day I can play football, that is lit
erally my goal."

but was not thinking football. He
was thinking he wanted to leave.
"You couldn't concentrate (at
Air Force) because you were
always thinking 'I should be
doing this, I should be doing
that,"' George said. "So I figured
maybe I should go to a school
where I should concentrate on
one thing.
"I didn't really think about
playing football. It got me out of a
lot of stuff, that was the main rea
son I played football. It got me
out of formation; it wasn't that I
was so enamored with football.
Once I left, I never thought I'd do
it again."
Ron had gotten into Stanford
after high school — and after
realizing it had more to offer than
Harvard — found himself far
from Germany, but a lot closer to
big time college football. Brought
in as a cornerback, George was
transferred over to linebacker
and spent his NCAA-imposed red
shirt year learning the ropes.
With his natural talent and drive,
he found his way up the depth
chart — and when then-starter

ending injury — Ron George was
the man. The rest, as they say, is
history.
"When I got to start junior
year against Colorado, I was on
the field and I was thinking, 'I
can't believe it.' I thought it was a
dream," George said. "It was
something I had never planned
on, something I had never

dreamed of because it wasn't in

pens now is just more icing on the
cake. It was a dream come true."
George is now living the
dream, he not only earned honor
able mention All-Conference hon
ors, but was also second in the
league in quarterback sacks, and
led the Pac-10 in tackles-for-loss.
He started all 11 games for the
Cardinal, recording 63 total tack
les and 10 quarterback sacks.
After five games this year, George
leads the team with 33 total tack
les and has the team's only two
quarterback sacks.
"I think he is an excellent foot
ball player," Smith said. "He runs
very well, he is very tough. I know
that Stanford has pushed him for
All-Conference, and he is for sure
that. He is a complete lineback
er." Big, strong, tough, physical,
and he can run."
George is still maturing as a

player. He admits that he is still
seeing new defenses, still hearing
plays he never thought existed.
There are others who have played
longer, but Ron is showing that it
is not always age that comes
before athletic beauty. He has a
basic philosophy, and with it has
come success.
"Play hard. It's that simple
and it's that complex," said
George. "Play hard means you are
physical, you are intense, you
read and react. If I can every play,
do what I'm supposed to do, do
what [the coaches] tell me to do,
then that is good football."
Right now Ron George is play
ing good football, and hopefully it
will keep getting better. For the
man who plays the game, it defi
nitely will. Football is a new love,
and the courtship has only begun.
"Every day football becomes a
little more important," George
said. "It is more fun today than it
was yesterday, and it is going to
be more fun next week than it is
this week. Twenty-four hours a
day I can play football, that is lit
erally my goal."
Ron George could be the best
college football player that was
almost never created. Heading
into this Saturday's game against
USC, George is Stanford's lead
ing tackier and most imposing
defensive threat the Cardinal pre
sents against what is sure to be
an explosive Trojan running
game.
"• Ron George is a man whom
USC coach Larry Smith is forced
to respect, and whom Stanford
coach Denny Green has come to
rely upon. The 6-foot-2, 220-
pound outside linebacker is a very
good football player, but it could
just as easily not have happened.
Because of his father's job,
George grew up in West Ger
many, where football is king, but
only because Europeans use the
name for a sport that it really fits
the title. American football, the
one with pads and the oblong ball,
was more of a joke than a sport
for young Ron.
"I hadn't thought about play
ing (college) football in Ger
many," George said. "I had
played football for one year really.
I was on the team as a sopho
more, never saw the field. I was
on the team as a junior, never saw
the field. Me and a friend of mine
made a little bench and put it on
our (varsity) jackets 'cause we
never saw the field."
Playing tight end and defen
sive end for Heidelberg American
High School, George finally
caught a glimpse of the field as a
senior, making a pretty good
impression along the way. That
year he made All-Europe with 37
solo tackles, 35 assists, six sacks,
two blocked punts and two fum
ble recoveries. He was also the
188-pound European high school
wrestling champion. Ron
George's athletic skills were not
hidden, but that does not mean

he got any attention.
"Out of high school, they
didn't recruit football players in
Germany," George said. "Foot
ball players in Germany are like
basketball players in India or
something."
Yet the Rhineland can produce
more than a good sausage. George
made his way to the Air Force
Academy and played on the team,
but was not thinking football. He
was thinking he wanted to leave.
"You couldn't concentrate (at
Air Force) because you were
