# Feldman injured — spikers face Bruins, Trojans
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
The No. 1 Stanford women's
volleyball team's luck took a turn
for the worse this week.
As the Cardinal practiced
Tuesday for what is arguably its
most important road trip of the
season this weekend, junior
starting setter Carrie Feldman
sprained her ankle. As a result,
sophomore setter Piper Hahn
will be starting tonight's match
against No. 9 USC and will prob
ably also get the call tomorrow
night when Stanford plays
archrival No. 2 UCLA.
Stanford women's coach Don
Shaw is not worried about
putting the pressure of starting
on Hahn's shoulders.
"That's what she's in there
for. We feel comfortable with her
in there," Shaw said.
Hahn has gotten a fair
amount of playing time already
during the year, so she is not
coming into the job without expe
rience. She started once last year
as well and came off the bench to
play well for the Cardinal
throughout her freshman year.
Now, however, Hahn must lead
Stanford in two important Pacif
ic 10 Conference matches.
There is still a chance that
Feldman might be healthy
enough to play this weekend, but
Shaw has run practices under

the assumption that she cannot
play at all. Since Feldman is
taller and a better blocker than
Hahn, the Cardinal will be mak
ing some defensive adjustments
to make it harder for opposing
teams to exploit Hahn's lower
block.
"We've done a little more
[moving Hahn aroundl so teams
have to find her to attack her,"
Shaw said.
Tonight's match is at 7:30
p.m. against USC. The Trojans
come into the contest with a 13-1
record (before last night's match
with California), losing only to
cross-town rival UCLA. USC is
led by senior middle blocker
Stephanie Bodison, who is hit
ting .380 on the year with 170
kills and 73 blocks. The Trojans,
who are currently third in the
Pac-10, have a reputation for
having a soft schedule this year.
However, they also have a knack
for improving their level of play
against better teams.
"USC is having a great season.
I think they're playing more as a
team this year," Shaw said.
Saturday night's match-up
against the No. 2 UCLA Bruins
will be Stanford's toughest con
test of the year so far. UCLA
always has been the Cardinal's
archenemy, the one hump that
they can never quite get over.
Stanford has not beaten the Bru
ins since 1987, and they have not

won in Los Angeles since 1985.
Last year, UCLA knocked the
Cardinal out of the NCAA play
offs, on their way to winning the
national championship.
Led by 1990 First-Team Ail-
American Natalie Williams and
1989 First-Team All-American
Elaine Youngs, UCLA has one of
the most powerful lineups in
women's volleyball. Williams has
272 kills and is hitting .305 this
season, while Youngs is hitting
.266 with 242 kills.
"Physically, they are one of
the strongest teams we play,"
Shaw said.
Although the Bruins have two
losses already this season, Shaw
does not feel that UCLA is sud
denly weaker.
"I still think they're the team
to beat," Shaw said.
Every member of the Stanford
team knows that the road to a
national championship goes
through UCLA, and the players
have made it a goal to defeat the
Bruins this year. It will be a giant
confidence boost for the Cardinal
to come out of this road trip with
a sweep, despite the unlucky
twist of fate.
Both matches will be broad
cast live on KZSU (90.1 FM).
Rick Seidel will do the play-by
play both nights, with color done
by Lindsey Hahn (sister of Piper)
at USC and Chris Crader at
UCLA.


Al Green — Daily file
Senior Kristin Klein will have to make great digs like this one if the Cardinal is going to beat archrival
UCLA Saturday. Sophomore setter Piper Hahn is starting in place of the injured Carrie Feldman.
