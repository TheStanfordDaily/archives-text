# Target cuts not unveiled
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
When Loma Prieta rattled campus two years ago,
the effects on Stanford quickly became apparent.
Although aftershocks from yesterday's budget
cutting decisions were not quite as obvious, they, too,
will have a major impact.
A veil of secrecy continued to mask the budget
cutting process yesterday as the University Cabinet
met to assign reduction targets for the schools and
administrative areas.
The numbers will not be released until Tuesday
morning, when a special statement will be issued by
the president and provost specifying targets and out
lining broad guidelines for the University.
Stanford needs to slash its $400-million operating
budget by approximately 10 percent, and University
officials readily acknowledge that both academics
and administrative areas will face significant cuts.
The Cabinet Committee on Budget and Strategic
Planning will meet at 8 a.m. to review the reduction
targets and begin the next step of the budget process
— helping schools and administrative areas decide
what to cut to meet the targets.
The Board of Trustees' ad hoc budget committee
will not meet this weekend but will receive the infor
mation before it is publicly released.
Although people familiar with the budget process
have declined to speculate on num
bers, it is likely the targets will fall
within the ranges considered over
the summer — 7 to 13 percent for
the schools and 15 to 21 percent
for administrative areas.
A few of the administrative
areas hit hardest during "reposi
tioning" — such as libraries and
information resources — may
receive smaller targets.
Repositioning is the recently
completed 18-month effort to slice
about $22 million from adminis
trative areas.
It is also likely that the state
ments on the University's so
called "central initiatives" will
focus on broader priorities rather
than specific decisions.
University officials have already
said that undergraduate enroll
ment is not likely to be increased
and need-blind admissions will
continue. Decisions about the
future of overseas campuses and
graduate enrollment may be
announced Tuesday, but it is likely
the issues will require more study.
It is also expected that Tues
day's statement will re-emphasize
many of the University's priorities.
After Tuesday's announcement,
the schools and administrative
areas will begin work on meeting
the budget-reduction targets and
will submit a proposal to the cabi
net budget committee in January.
The University-wide budget
cutting plan will be completed by
April, and the cuts will occur over
the next two academic years.
