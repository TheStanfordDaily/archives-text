# Professional palm as barmy as Band

Going to Ken's 24-hour restaurant by
limousine at midnight to eat apple pan
cakes with a stranger who leaves obscene
messages on answering machines may
sound strange, but that's what it takes to
interview the man inside the Stanford
Tree costume.
"When I tried out for Tree at the end of
last year, I decided to do something very
exciting and phenomenal, to make a state
ment and to use a bunch of my friends,"
said junior Peter Huyck, the student mas
querading as the University mascot for
the Stanford Band this year.
"I had between 100 and 10,000 guys
dressed as tree prostitutes, a fleet of 22
limos and on a flatbed truck a 200-foot
tall tree made out of condoms, old shoes
and my friend Nick's phlegm," Huyck
said.
At this point in Huyck's story about
his Tree tryout it became obvious he
was telling a massive lie. However, he
swore to his story's authenticity, adding
that during the tryout he had been
wearing pasties, bowling shoes and his
friend Danielle's underwear backwards
with an American flag painted on the
front.
He said his whole body had been cov
ered with the words "I want to be Tree"
and that he danced to "The Stripper"
while swinging monkeys from both
hands.
According to Huyck, he was chosen by
a distinguished panel that included "the
old Tree, the new drum major, Don
Kennedy, George Schultz, George Zim
mer from the Men's Wearhouse. . . ."
His tryout ordeal also entailed having
to eat pimento loaf and Spam in the Band
Shak, as well as having his sweat output
measured for a day by a leprechaun in
spandex who squeegeed off his sweat and
put it in recycling bins.
Incidentally, the Connecticut native
said he had dealt with leprechauns previ-

ously; one left him the limousine he
drives on the edge of Lake Lag. Huyck
said if he had another wish from the lep
rechaun, "I would want to be Art Linklet
ter with Ukla the Mok (Thundarr the
Barbarian's companion) as my sidekick."
Huyck said he wrote his Stanford essay
about the apple pancakes at Ken's in
Mountain View. His familiarity with the
restaurant was evident in the kitchen,
where the cook welcomed Huyck like an
old friend and revealed the apple pan
cakes in the oven. As soon as Huyck sat
back down, however, he returned to using
his talent of storytelling/inventing mas
sive lies.
His reasons for wanting to be the
Tree? "When I was 9 years old, my dad
owned a foam factory and several 'House
of Foam' stores. He used to ride through
the factory on a pony stark naked, cov
ered in Crisco oil, yelling 'Bruha.' He died
in a fatal accident involving an industrial
strength staple gun, so I wanted to be
[the] Tree to avenge my Dad."
Since the connection wasn't immedi
ately obvious, Huyck explained that
the Tree costume — which he changed
from a redwood to a palm — is made of
foam.
Now that he has fulfilled this lifelong
ambition, Huyck said the best parts of
being the Tree are: "Girls, girls, fame,
fortune and girls." The worst part of
being Tree is the abuse, he said, especial
ly blows to the groin he gets from little
kids.
Despite his eccentricities, which
include being an Ordained Minister of the
Church of Holy Sin, having a major ten
tatively named "Blue Sexy Dancing" and
holding a Medic Alert Card that states he
is a 10 1/2, Huyck is a man with priori
ties. The three things closest to his heart:
recycling, safe sex and hair replace
ment.
He said he went bald when he was
six but turned his life around through
the Sysphe Erling hair club for men.
