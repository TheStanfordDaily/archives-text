Dear Bug Me,
Why do all the campus buildings look essentially
the same —that mission style? Is it in the Stanfords'
will or something?
— Doric M. Lintel
The Stanford Office of Spin Control denied there
is, or ever was, any plan (either overt or covert) to dis
criminate against one form of architecture or anoth
er. Any perceived similarity between campus build
ings is purely coincidental. Stanford is committed to
Total Architectural Diversity.
I almost let it go at that. But then I happened to
run across the Stanford Tour Guide Training Manu
al. It said one of the original Stanford architects,
Charles Coolidge, had designed the buildings of the
Quad in the "Richardson Romanesque" style. It
turns out Coolidge was a protege of an architect
named Richardson. So, the Quad is a century old
monument to student brown-nosing.
I talked to Philip Williams, the director of plan
ning for the University. He obviously had not yet
been coached on Stanford's policy of Total Architec
tural Diversity, because he admitted that the Univer
sity believed all the campus buildings should "retain
the substance of what was original and lovable in
Stanford architecture."
The Office of Spin Control refused to comment
when presented with the above allegations. Look for
a round of resignations on this one.
