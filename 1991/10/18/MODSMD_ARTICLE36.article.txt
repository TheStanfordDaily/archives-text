# Mastering Kempo is true art

At first it may be intimidating
to walk into a room and see bodies
fly through the air and hear a con
tinuous series of shrieks and
grunts.
But never fear — it's just a typ
ical Shorinji Kempo martial arts
class.
While on the surface martial
arts may seem to involve only pro
ducing physical pain as a method
of self-defense, they are — as the
name suggests — art forms,
instructor Jeff Livingston said.
Self-defense is a goal of many
martial arts; however, Livingston
said, it can only be achieved
through a combination of internal
and external elements. He ex
plained that martial arts "provide
mechanisms for learning about
oneself both spiritually and phys
ically."
Shorinji Kempo builds on the
fundamental principal of individual
self-improvements, said Livingston,
a fourth-degree black belt. Students

become familiar with their internal
abilities and limitations, and by
strengthening their emotional
resources, they learn to remain
calm and think clearly regardless of
challenging situations.
The physical side of Shorinji
Kempo centers a great deal around
the body, its range of flexibility
and its pressure points or nerve
centers. Since Shorinji Kempo
emphasizes defensive techniques,
students learn many methods to
get out of a confrontation.
Livingston said Shorinji Kempo
offers the resources to "control a
situation by graduated degrees."
So, one can easily cause an attack
er discomfort, or — for the more
life-threatening scenarios — uti
lize a wide range of options includ
ing blocking, punching, kicking,
throwing and pinning.
Club President Andre Marziali
said that regardless of the task at
hand, the techniques are "soft and
fluid" since they are intended to
"minimize the amount of damage
to the other person."

Livingston pointed out that
Shoriryi Kempo's approach devi
ates from other martial arts in
that it does not rely entirely on
individual practice. "If we all con
centrated on doing things just for
ourselves, it wouldn't make this
world a better place to live," he
said, adding that it is important
"to make an impact on those
around you" and "to learn about
how your actions affect others."
Practicing in pairs helps inte
grate the spiritual and physical
aspects. Students discover what
they are capable of doing and wit
ness the types of reactions that
the techniques produce, Liv
ingston said. Speed, timing and
precision, as well as adjustments
to different size partners, can only
be strengthened through practical
experience.
There are no prerequisites to
attending a class. Beginners and
men and women of all shapes and
sizes are welcome and capable of
learning Shorinji Kempo, Liv
ingston said.
