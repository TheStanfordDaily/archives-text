# Haas center defends itself against ASSU's ax
## 
### Doug Miro Staff writer 
When the ASSU senate drew up
a list of budget cuts and priorities
last week, the Haas Center for
Public Service found itself in the
cuts category.
However, according to Tim Stan
ton, the center's associate director,
if the University were to cut accord
ing to the recommendations, the
center may lose its place as an inte
gral part of the Stanford communi
ty and "become that funny-looking
place across the street."

Graduate senator Larry
Augustin wrote the proposal,
which says in part: "Where possi
ble, public service projects should
fund themselves directly from out
side gifts explicitly earmarked for
public service, and the University
should encourage such gifts."
Explaining the proposal,
Augustin said the University
should know where students' prior
ities lie so it doesn't cut areas that
mean a lot to students. "Given the
choice between cutting their major
and cutting some of these other
programs, students would rather

the programs are cut," he said.
He said Haas is the perfect tar
get because only one-third of its
budget comes from the University
while the other two-thirds come
from the Haas endowment and
outside sources. "Any cuts applied
to them wouldn't be as severe
because they could replace their
University funding with outside
funds," he said.
Junior Brad Budney, who voted
for the recommendation, said the
Senate was under a lot of pressure
to find something to cut and decid
ed on Haas, although "most people

voted on an assumption that out
side funding will pick up what the
University cuts."
Senator Shaista Malik, who
abstained from the vote, agreed,
saying, "I wish that there were peo
ple present from Haas who could
assure me that the relative damage
to Haas would be minimal."
According to Stanton, however,
the damage would not be minimal.
He explained that the "Haas
Core" — administration and the
basic Haas programs such as the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring
Program and the Public Service

Clearinghouse — is completely
funded by University money and
interest earned from the Haas
endowment.
The Haas family set up the
endowment on the condition that
the University match the family's
commitment to public service by
partly funding the center. They
said they believed this would make
the center a part of University life
rather than a separate entity that
students have to search out,
according to Stanton.
