# Soviets seek new ideals

Editor's note: Louis O'Neill is a fifth
year senior co-terming at the Center for
Russian and East European Studies. He
spent the last 11 months at Moscow State
University on a Fulbright scholarship and
traveled extensively throughout the various
Soviet republics.
This student-perspective is the last of a
three-part series.

The collapse of the 70-year ideological
hegemony of the Communist Party has left a
powerful vacuum of belief in Soviet society.
When choice was forbidden and Leninist
socialist ideas were the only ones allowed to
be expressed, finding one's personal truth
was easy: The communists were wrong and
lied; any alternative was better.
Now people encounter difTiculty in the
search for meaning. Alienation from soci
ety, despair and complete indifference are
emerging as widespread conditions and are
magnified by Soviet economic chaos.
This has had profound effects on Soviet
youth. Faced with insurmountable eco
nomic walls, and distrustful of anything
stained with communism, youth are being
drawn in increasing numbers into religious
orders, cults and the underground world of

the mafia and the "shadow economy."
The most visible of these groups is the
Hare Krishnas, who have exploded in num
ber in the last year. This religious cult is
attractive to Soviet youth due to its dis
avowal of political power and its focus on
self-perfection by the self. After decades of
being "perfected" from above, people are
ready to take this task into their own hands.
The Russian Orthodox Church is also
enjoying a tremendous revival. The commu
nists viewed it as perhaps the most serious
threat to their power. The church's leaders
and clergy were jailed or "liquidated" and
some of the most beautiful examples of
Orthodox church architecture destroyed.
Now, the devout few who kept the faith
during years of repression are coming forth
and bringing with them new believers. The
church played a seminal role in the develop
ment of the Russian character, and its renais
sance is tied to the growing sense of national
ism in the Russian Republic. It is widely
expected that the church will play a key role
in shaping the future of Russian society.
Catholicism, Mormonism, Buddhist sects
and transcendental meditation classes also
fill the spiritual void left by the self-destruc
tion of communism.
