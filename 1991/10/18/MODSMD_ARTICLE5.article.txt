# Soviets seek new ideals
## 
### Louis O'Neill 
Editor's note: Louis O'Neill is a fifth
year senior co-terming at the Center for
Russian and East European Studies. He
spent the last 11 months at Moscow State
University on a Fulbright scholarship and
traveled extensively throughout the various
Soviet republics.
This student-perspective is the last of a
three-part series.

The collapse of the 70-year ideological
hegemony of the Communist Party has left a
powerful vacuum of belief in Soviet society.
When choice was forbidden and Leninist
socialist ideas were the only ones allowed to
be expressed, finding one's personal truth
was easy: The communists were wrong and
lied; any alternative was better.
Now people encounter difTiculty in the
search for meaning. Alienation from soci
ety, despair and complete indifference are
emerging as widespread conditions and are
magnified by Soviet economic chaos.
This has had profound effects on Soviet
youth. Faced with insurmountable eco
nomic walls, and distrustful of anything
stained with communism, youth are being
drawn in increasing numbers into religious
orders, cults and the underground world of

the mafia and the "shadow economy."
The most visible of these groups is the
Hare Krishnas, who have exploded in num
ber in the last year. This religious cult is
attractive to Soviet youth due to its dis
avowal of political power and its focus on
self-perfection by the self. After decades of
being "perfected" from above, people are
ready to take this task into their own hands.
The Russian Orthodox Church is also
enjoying a tremendous revival. The commu
nists viewed it as perhaps the most serious
threat to their power. The church's leaders
and clergy were jailed or "liquidated" and
some of the most beautiful examples of
Orthodox church architecture destroyed.
Now, the devout few who kept the faith
during years of repression are coming forth
and bringing with them new believers. The
church played a seminal role in the develop
ment of the Russian character, and its renais
sance is tied to the growing sense of national
ism in the Russian Republic. It is widely
expected that the church will play a key role
in shaping the future of Russian society.
Catholicism, Mormonism, Buddhist sects
and transcendental meditation classes also
fill the spiritual void left by the self-destruc
tion of communism.
But the most seductive cult
enticing the Soviet people — and
especially youth today — is the
cult of the perfection of the West.
These people were taught for
years that the West embodied cor
ruption and greed, resulting in
riches for a few and poverty for
the masses. Now, with the open
ing of borders, the Soviet people
have seen the West's affluence,
and this — compounded with
their centuries-old inferiority
complex engendered by an aware
ness of the USSR's backwardness
— has made a god out of Western
culture.
With this has come the ascen
dancy of the dollar as the USSR's
real currency, and the perceived
need to chase after it actively.
Before Gorbachev's reforms,
owning any hard currency was
forbidden and strictly punished as
"speculation." Now, Soviets can
legally possess hard currency, and
the number of hard currency
stores has swelled to include sev
eral Western-style dollar super
markets, clothing and cosmetics
stores.
However, the ruble is still the
"official" currency and is used in
the majority of day-to-day finan
cial transactions.
This sobering reality has split
Soviet youth into roughly two
groups, under the slang headings
"loxi" and "mazhori."
The loxi are those who have no
or limited access to hard currency

and thus to Western luxuries.
This may be because they are liv
ing on their university stipend,
come from poor families or —
most likely — refuse to partici
pate in black market circles.
They generally hail from out
side Moscow, tend to live in dor
mitories and do not sport Western
fashions. Though they aren't
starving, they often suffer from
mild malnourishment.
The mazhori ("majors"), in
contrast, look as if they have just
stepped off the streets of Paris.
They are generally the children of
highly placed Soviet officials, who
can afford to provide them with
luxury dollars. The square in
front of McDonald'B Moscow is
the central gathering place for
these youth.
Those mazhori who are not
taken care of by their parents are
active on the black market or as
dollar prostitutes serving West
ern businessmen. The speculators
can deal in hard currency, goods
or both.
Many young women are taking
to prostitution to improve their
own standard of living and that of
their families. In every class I
attended at Moscow State Univer
sity there were at least two or
three and everyone knew who
they were.
I even learned of some prosti
tutes who were high school stu
dents. These young women can
earn up to several hundred dollars
a night — roughly a year's ruble
salary — and it shows.
A more frightening section of
the mafia is that of extortion,
strong-arming and murder for

hire. I watched in horrid fascina
tion one evening in front of
McDonald's as a young mafia
leader demanded that one of his
flunkies (who was 16), bring him
1,000 rubles before he finished his
BicMac. The boy couldn't gather
the whole sum and was solidly
beaten.
I distantly knew a 19-year-old
hit man, who proudly displayed
his piece and casually discussed
his six "jobs" and the price
received for them (from 5,000
rubles to $1,000). It turned out
that the Moscow militia had
apprehended him for this, but his
mother is a high-ranking lawyer
and was able to get him off
through persuasion and bribery.
Such instances are neither isolat
ed nor unique.
This shadow-economy activity
gives the Soviet youths a feeling
of control over their future, and
thus self-confidence and a sense
of purpose, which explains its
tremendous pull.
The Literary Gazette, a well
respected weekly, ran a survey of
fourth-grade Soviet children.
When asked who their role models
were, 60 percent of the girls
answered that they aspired to be
hard-currency prostitutes, and 80
percent of the boys admitted they
sought to become gangsters. When
asked why, they responded: "to
make a lot of money," help their
families and "become someone."
Sadly, this illustrates the
degree to which money and social
status have become equated in
Soviet society, and this condition
can only worsen during the com
ing winter and beyond.

a vacuum of beliefs caused by the end of communism.

attended at Moscow State Univer
sity there were at least two or
three and everyone knew who
they were.
I even learned of some prosti
tutes who were high school stu
dents. These young women can
earn up to several hundred dollars
a night — roughly a year's ruble
salary — and it shows.
A more frightening section of
the mafia is that of extortion,
strong-arming and murder for

hire. I watched in horrid fascina
tion one evening in front of
McDonald's as a young mafia
leader demanded that one of his
flunkies (who was 16), bring him
1,000 rubles before he finished his
BicMac. The boy couldn't gather
the whole sum and was solidly
beaten.
I distantly knew a 19-year-old
hit man, who proudly displayed
his piece and casually discussed
his six "jobs" and the price
received for them (from 5,000
rubles to $1,000). It turned out
that the Moscow militia had
apprehended him for this, but his
mother is a high-ranking lawyer
and was able to get him off
through persuasion and bribery.
Such instances are neither isolat
ed nor unique.
This shadow-economy activity
gives the Soviet youths a feeling
of control over their future, and
thus self-confidence and a sense
of purpose, which explains its
tremendous pull.
The Literary Gazette, a well
respected weekly, ran a survey of
fourth-grade Soviet children.
When asked who their role models
were, 60 percent of the girls
answered that they aspired to be
hard-currency prostitutes, and 80
percent of the boys admitted they
sought to become gangsters. When
asked why, they responded: "to
make a lot of money," help their
families and "become someone."
Sadly, this illustrates the
degree to which money and social
status have become equated in
Soviet society, and this condition
can only worsen during the com
ing winter and beyond.


Louis O'Neill — Daily
Lithuanian nationalists use pillars outside the Lithuanian parliament
building to post Soviet paraphernalia — including money, pins,
passports and posters — in protest. Soviet youth are suffering from
a vacuum of beliefs caused by the end of communism.
Editor's note: Louis O'Neill is a fifth
year senior co-terming at the Center for
Russian and East European Studies. He
spent the last 11 months at Moscow State
University on a Fulbright scholarship and
traveled extensively throughout the various
Soviet republics.
This student-perspective is the last of a
three-part series.

The collapse of the 70-year ideological
hegemony of the Communist Party has left a
powerful vacuum of belief in Soviet society.
When choice was forbidden and Leninist
socialist ideas were the only ones allowed to
be expressed, finding one's personal truth
was easy: The communists were wrong and
lied; any alternative was better.
Now people encounter difTiculty in the
search for meaning. Alienation from soci
ety, despair and complete indifference are
emerging as widespread conditions and are
magnified by Soviet economic chaos.
This has had profound effects on Soviet
youth. Faced with insurmountable eco
nomic walls, and distrustful of anything
stained with communism, youth are being
drawn in increasing numbers into religious
orders, cults and the underground world of

the mafia and the "shadow economy."
The most visible of these groups is the
Hare Krishnas, who have exploded in num
ber in the last year. This religious cult is
attractive to Soviet youth due to its dis
avowal of political power and its focus on
self-perfection by the self. After decades of
being "perfected" from above, people are
ready to take this task into their own hands.
The Russian Orthodox Church is also
enjoying a tremendous revival. The commu
nists viewed it as perhaps the most serious
threat to their power. The church's leaders
and clergy were jailed or "liquidated" and
some of the most beautiful examples of
Orthodox church architecture destroyed.
Now, the devout few who kept the faith
during years of repression are coming forth
and bringing with them new believers. The
church played a seminal role in the develop
ment of the Russian character, and its renais
sance is tied to the growing sense of national
ism in the Russian Republic. It is widely
expected that the church will play a key role
in shaping the future of Russian society.
Catholicism, Mormonism, Buddhist sects
and transcendental meditation classes also
fill the spiritual void left by the self-destruc
tion of communism.
But the most seductive cult
enticing the Soviet people — and
especially youth today — is the
cult of the perfection of the West.
These people were taught for
years that the West embodied cor
ruption and greed, resulting in
riches for a few and poverty for
the masses. Now, with the open
ing of borders, the Soviet people
have seen the West's affluence,
and this — compounded with
their centuries-old inferiority
complex engendered by an aware
ness of the USSR's backwardness
— has made a god out of Western
culture.
With this has come the ascen
dancy of the dollar as the USSR's
real currency, and the perceived
need to chase after it actively.
Before Gorbachev's reforms,
owning any hard currency was
forbidden and strictly punished as
"speculation." Now, Soviets can
legally possess hard currency, and
the number of hard currency
stores has swelled to include sev
eral Western-style dollar super
markets, clothing and cosmetics
stores.
However, the ruble is still the
"official" currency and is used in
the majority of day-to-day finan
cial transactions.
This sobering reality has split
Soviet youth into roughly two
groups, under the slang headings
"loxi" and "mazhori."
The loxi are those who have no
or limited access to hard currency

and thus to Western luxuries.
This may be because they are liv
ing on their university stipend,
come from poor families or —
most likely — refuse to partici
pate in black market circles.
They generally hail from out
side Moscow, tend to live in dor
mitories and do not sport Western
fashions. Though they aren't
starving, they often suffer from
mild malnourishment.
The mazhori ("majors"), in
contrast, look as if they have just
stepped off the streets of Paris.
They are generally the children of
highly placed Soviet officials, who
can afford to provide them with
luxury dollars. The square in
front of McDonald'B Moscow is
the central gathering place for
these youth.
Those mazhori who are not
taken care of by their parents are
active on the black market or as
dollar prostitutes serving West
ern businessmen. The speculators
can deal in hard currency, goods
or both.
Many young women are taking
to prostitution to improve their
own standard of living and that of
their families. In every class I
attended at Moscow State Univer
sity there were at least two or
three and everyone knew who
they were.
I even learned of some prosti
