# Time-share cooks for Row
## 
### Angie Chuang 
Responding to student complaints, Uni
versity Food Service will reinstate three
cooks to seven University-operated Row
houses this weekend. Although cooks will
be shared between houses, Row residents
seem pleased with the resolution.
The in-house cooks were reassigned to
larger dorms during the summer, but Row
residents were not informed of the change
until this fall. So far this year food from
Lagunita and Wilbur Halls has been trans
ported daily to the houses.
An Oct. 14 letter from Food Service to
Row residents reads, "Individual cooks will
be assigned to prepare meals for
Murray/Yost, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk/558
Mayfield and Grove [Lasuen and May

field|/Roth. Each cook will be present in the
houses on alternating days."
The primary complaint Row residents
presented to Food Service was that stu
dents had no way of knowing about the
change when they chose their houses.
"Many people who draw high choose Yost
because of its good food and the fact that it
has a cook," Yost Resident Fellow Barbara
Homsy said. "When this decision was
announced after the draw, students felt
slighted, to say the least."
Student complaints started with a letter
drafted by 558 Mayfield residents, repre
senting the Row houses. The letter prompt
ed a meeting of Row Director Diana Con
klin and representatives from all houses
(except Roth) with Housing and
Food Services Dir. Keith Guy and
Food Service Assoc. Dir. Shirley
Everett.
After the discussion, Guy said
he and Everett went to the hous
es to "take a look at the situation
and talk to students in meetings
at the houses." After these visits,
Food Service concluded that the
food quality "wasn't up to what it
should be," Guy said.
Food Service conceded that the
change should not have been
made without notifying potential
residents before the Draw. "We
regret the breakdown in commu
nication associated with this deci
sion," the Oct. 14 letter reads.
However, Guy emphasized the
University's financial constraints.
"We did the best we could given
the (budget) cuts, which caused
the changes in the first place," he
said. "But this is not a long-term
solution. Things will probably be
different next year."
"We still need to work out the
specifics, such as how food will be
provided on the days when an
individual house does not have a
cook," Guy said.
Food Service will place an
emphasis on improving the general
quality of the food, he said. Guy
noted that the low food quality was
partially attributed to "inconsis

tent" transport and dining room
equipment, and that Food Service
will now "make sure that the hous
es havs the right equipment."
Row House residents have gen
erally reacted positively. Murray
Resident Assistant Anne Mc-
Gowan said she is pleased with
the changes. "I don't see any
problems with the sharing of the
cooks," she said. "It'll definitely
be better than it was before."
However, some Row residents
are less optimistic about sharing
cooks. "I can't say for sure whether
or not it's going to be better," said
Karen Larimore, a Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk resident fellow. "We'll
just have to wait and see."
A common concern of Row res
idents was the breakdown of com
munity spirit that resulted from
no longer eating together. Since
the changes in their food service
this year, many residents have
chosen to eat elsewhere. "With a
house of 56, everyone should
know each other's names at this
point in the year, but they don't,"
said Josh Kreinberg, an RA at 558
Mayfield.
"We worked very hard to try to
impress upon the University the
unfairness of the situation," said
Homsy.
Some houses, such as Yost,
have developed special relation
ships with their cooks in the past
and are looking forward to their
return. "We used to give our cook,
Jorge, gifts because we love him
so much," Homsy said.
