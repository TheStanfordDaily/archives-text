# Time-share cooks for Row
## 
### Angie Chuang 
Responding to student complaints, Uni
versity Food Service will reinstate three
cooks to seven University-operated Row
houses this weekend. Although cooks will
be shared between houses, Row residents
seem pleased with the resolution.
The in-house cooks were reassigned to
larger dorms during the summer, but Row
residents were not informed of the change
until this fall. So far this year food from
Lagunita and Wilbur Halls has been trans
ported daily to the houses.
An Oct. 14 letter from Food Service to
Row residents reads, "Individual cooks will
be assigned to prepare meals for
Murray/Yost, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk/558
Mayfield and Grove [Lasuen and May

field|/Roth. Each cook will be present in the
houses on alternating days."
The primary complaint Row residents
presented to Food Service was that stu
dents had no way of knowing about the
change when they chose their houses.
"Many people who draw high choose Yost
because of its good food and the fact that it
has a cook," Yost Resident Fellow Barbara
Homsy said. "When this decision was
announced after the draw, students felt
slighted, to say the least."
Student complaints started with a letter
drafted by 558 Mayfield residents, repre
senting the Row houses. The letter prompt
ed a meeting of Row Director Diana Con
klin and representatives from all houses
