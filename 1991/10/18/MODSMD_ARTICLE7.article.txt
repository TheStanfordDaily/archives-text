# Pole's English nets job at Solidarity
## 
### Matti Bunzl Staff writer 
Zem Laski said it was "like being in
the middle of history."
As a stafT member of the Interna
tional Office of Solidarity in Poland,
the junior transfer student served as a
personal translator for Lech Walesa.
Laski, who was 21 at the time, was also
one of the key organizers of President
George Bush's visit to Poland in 1989.
Laski was born in the Polish city of
Gdansk in 1968. When he was 13, he

came to the United States with his
mother and sister to visit his father,
an associate professor at a community
college near Detroit, and to "stay for
three months to learn the language,"
he said.
On December 13, 1981, martial law
was declared in Poland to suppress
Solidarity, the independent trade
union led by Lech Walesa.
said original reports of the situ
ation in his home country were so unset
tling that his family decided to stay in
the United States "for the time being."

In 1984 he became a permanent
resident of the United States. During
high school Laski thought about
returning to Poland. "I was deter
mined on going back," he said.
To avoid the difficult entrance
examinations to Polish universities,
Laski decided to attend the University
of Michigan for a semester.
Eventually, he carried out his plan
to return to Poland by transferring to
Gdansk Polytechnic University. He

attended his hometown universi
ty for three semesters before he
got "tired of school."
While looking for a job in
Poland in 1989, he was offered a
position at the International
Office of Solidarity. "I got the job
because I was bilingual," Laski
noted.
During this time, the round
table talks between the commu
nist Polish government and the
country's opposition produced
preliminary results. The agree
ments they reached led to "the
freedom of the press, free trade
unions and paved the way to
democracy," Laski said.
In the wake of the more liberal
atmosphere, Laski said, his activ
ities at the International Office
became quite diverse. "I was put
on the test many times," he said.
Laski's primary responsibility
was to help establish official rela
tions between Solidarity and for
eign organizations. He was the
only staff member fluent in
English, so he worked on requests
to set up ties with groups in the
English-speaking world.
In the course of his job, Laski
also became a translator for
Walesa. "I was the personal inter
preter for Lech Walesa in his
meetings with U.S. senators Bob
Dole (R-Kan.), Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.), Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and
various other foreign delega
tions," Laski said.
One of the highlights of
Laski's affiliation with Solidarity
was Bush's July 1989 visit to
Poland. The visit was supposed to
provide moral and some financial
support for the newly emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe.
"I was assigned to help out with
the preparations," he said.
According to Laski, "the Wale
sas hosted a private lunch for the
Bushes." Laski was to attend the
lunch in case the state depart
ment interpreter didn't come.
But the official American transla
tor showed. Laski did get to shake
Bush's hand, though.
