European plan scares NATO
TAORMINA, Sicily (AP) â€” A German-
French proposal to create a European army
caused a major stir at a NATO meeting yester
day, raising concern it could undermine the
Western alliance.
German Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg explained details of the proposal to
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other
Western military chiefs assembled to approve
drastic cuts in nuclear weapons in Europe.
The proposal apparently took them by sur
prise, raising questions about Western Europe's
long-term security links with the United States.
Said one British official, "We have a
European defense; it's called NATO."
God spoke to Swaggart
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - One day after
Jimmy Swaggart was said to be stepping down
from the pulpit in a scandal involving a prosti
tute, the evangelist announced he's gone back
to preaching because God told him to do so.
Swaggart told his congregation that he had
trouble sleeping Wednesday morning and tried
to read the Bible but couldn't.
"I closed it and whimpered like a hurt little
dog, 'God, if you're there, if you're really there,
tell me what to do,"' Swaggart recounted. He
said he then drifted off to sleep in despair, and
when he awoke, "the Holy Spirit was rolling all
over me."
