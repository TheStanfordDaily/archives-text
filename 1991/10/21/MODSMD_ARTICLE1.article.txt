## Destroyed homes, roaring blazes scare Stanford students, faculty 
### June Cohen Mike Laris Editorial staff 
The fire that raged throughout
1,500 acres in the East Bay was a
mere smoke cloud for many at
Stanford, but for some it struck
closer to home.
Last night, as she watched her
neighborhood burning on televi
sion, Stanford sophomore Steph
anie Cawthon could not stop
thinking about what she would tell
her future children.
"I can't tell my kids this is
where I grew up," she said. "I
don't have a history."
Her family escaped unharmed
at noon when the houses across
the street began to burn. But the
massive residential fire in the
Berkeley and Oakland area de
stroyed her home of the last six
years. Cawthon's all-wood house,
located on stilts on a hillside next
to California Highways 13 and
24, burned to the ground.
"My reality is gone. Where I
learned how to drive is gone,"
she said quietly.
"You're always prepared for an
earthquake, but you're not pre
pared for a Firestorm."
At least one other Stanford
student lost her home. More than
60 staff and faculty members live
in the East Bay cities of Oakland,
Berkeley and surrounding com
munities, and many found them
selves within miles — even blocks
— of the flames.
Some were forced to evacuate,
while others opened their homes
to displaced friends and relatives.

'I lived in war zones [in the Middle
East] and I've lived through an earth
quake. And I've never been this fright
ened in my life.'

A Piedmont resident tries invain to save his home from devastating flames. He, like hundreds of others, lost his home to yesterday's East
Bay fire. Blazes swept over 1,500 acres last night.
