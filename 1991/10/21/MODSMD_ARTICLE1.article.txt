# Flaming Fury
## Destroyed homes, roaring blazes scare Stanford students, faculty 
### June Cohen Mike Laris Editorial staff 
The fire that raged throughout
1,500 acres in the East Bay was a
mere smoke cloud for many at
Stanford, but for some it struck
closer to home.
Last night, as she watched her
neighborhood burning on televi
sion, Stanford sophomore Steph
anie Cawthon could not stop
thinking about what she would tell
her future children.
"I can't tell my kids this is
where I grew up," she said. "I
don't have a history."
Her family escaped unharmed
at noon when the houses across
the street began to burn. But the
massive residential fire in the
Berkeley and Oakland area de
stroyed her home of the last six
years. Cawthon's all-wood house,
located on stilts on a hillside next
to California Highways 13 and
24, burned to the ground.
"My reality is gone. Where I
learned how to drive is gone,"
she said quietly.
"You're always prepared for an
earthquake, but you're not pre
pared for a Firestorm."
At least one other Stanford
student lost her home. More than
60 staff and faculty members live
in the East Bay cities of Oakland,
Berkeley and surrounding com
munities, and many found them
selves within miles — even blocks
— of the flames.
Some were forced to evacuate,
while others opened their homes
to displaced friends and relatives.

A Piedmont resident tries invain to save his home from devastating flames. He, like hundreds of others, lost his home to yesterday's East
Bay fire. Blazes swept over 1,500 acres last night.
Berkeley study yesterday morning
grading papers when she noticed a
strange orange cast had come over
the light in the room. When she
looked up, she saw the hills of
Berkeley up in flames.
"I lived in war zones [in the
Middle East] and I've lived
through an earthquake," said
Elena Lifschitz. "And I've never
been this frightened in my life."
English lecturer Robin Joly's
north Berkeley home stands one
half mile from the Claremont
Hotel, the central Berkeley struc
ture viewed as the city's greatest
fire hazard.
"If the Claremont holds, we
will," said Joly at 10:15 last night.
Joly said she had packed her
car with valuables such as pictures
and papers that "you can't replace
and insurance companies can't
pay you for."
Music Prof. Karol Berger,
whose home is also near the hotel,
said, "We calculated that if the
hotel catches fire, we will have to
evacuate because we are very
close."
He said he felt helpless yester
day watching the fire approach his
home. I "had to get used to the
idea that my house could disap
pear," he said.
At 10 p.m. yesterday, Berger
said his 6-year-old daughter was
sleeping and that the family would
spend the night in the house, but
if necessary, the family could
escape in three minutes.
Stanford Linear Accelerator
official Hugh Steckel's Oakland
house was several miles away
from the blaze, but he was hosting
several friends whose houses had
burned down.
"We have their parakeets hang

ing from our ceiling and a couple
of cats around the house, and
we're sitting around a big carton
of Chinese food and trying to fig
ure out what to do next."
Steckel said his friends did not
have the opportunity to save many
belongings, but they had taken
personal papers, "especially insur
ance policies."
And the question of what to
save was on the minds of almost
everyone in the East Bay yester
day. History Prof. James Sheehan
said he would grab his research
notes if he were forced to evacu
ate.
Some East Bay residents won't
be able to come to work today.
Many major freeways are closed
and commuting "will be a night
mare," said Bennett Smith, a
SLAC employee who lives in Oak
land.
"I'll bet you you can add at
least two hours to any commute
(from the East Bay)," Smith
said.
Berkeley hills ablaze
All classes at UC-Berkeley are
canceled today, and officials esti
mate that about 1,000 students
were evacuated from the Berkeley
campus on account of the fire,
including 400 students from Clark
Kerr Hall, a campus dormitory,
and residents of 18 off-campus
fraternities and apartments at the
bottom of the burning hills.
Many have been moved to Unit
Three, another on-campus resi
dence where cots have been set up.
According to Daily Californian
editor T. Miller, "It is unes
timable" how many students are
displaced because Berkeley resi
dences are so dispersed.
"Thousands more students live
in apartments in the hill areas,"

he said, adding that no students
are believed to be killed or injured.
A Red Cross shelter was set up
in the student union building at
the invitation of student govern
ment leaders. By 10 p.m., about
1,000 local residents were there,
he said.
"They're packing their belong
ings and escaping from their
homes with nothing but a pair of
socks and shorts," Miller said.
Tina Rhee, a UC-Berkeley
senior, was one of hundreds of fra
ternity and sorority members who
evacuated their houses last night.
Rhee, a member of the Gamma
Phi Beta sorority, said there did
not appear to be immediate dan
ger to her house, but members
and fire officials wanted to reduce
the risk from the fast-moving
blaze.
"Being able to see the flames,
we started to pack up," Rhee said.
But, she added, "The general
feeling was that [the firel wasn't
going to burn right where we
lived, but we wanted to be safe."
Rhee said a friend's apartment
had burned down.
Miller said he couldn't remem
ber the last time campus closed
down. He said anger over the uni
versity's decision not to close
down after the Loma Prieta earth
quake may have been the impetus
for canceling classes today.
According to Berkeley senior
Steven Hines, "The horizon [was]
lit up like the sun [was] coming
up."
He summed up the reaction of
many Berkeley students.
"It's not close enough so you
feel immediately threatened, but
it's not far enough that you can
relax."
Hines said he helped a friend
evacuate the burning hills.

Police and fire officials
"wouldn't let us go get her. We
went up a back way to pick her
up," he said.
Albany firefighter Ed Jones,
who was working in the Clare
mont area, said, "It was exactly
like what you think of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki — when we came
back, everything we were trying
to save was razed to the ground."
Hospitals prepare
No victims from the East Bay
fires were brought to the Stanford
Hospital as of 1 a.m., but hospital
administrators were prepared for
a flood of additional patients.
"We haven't called in extra
staff yet, but we're ready to," said
a nurse. She said people in charge
of each hospital department were
alerted to the possibility of an
emergency situation.
According to the supervisor,
administrators in regional hospi
tals frequently check bed avail
ability in other nearby hospitals
when their own are filling up.
The hospital was contacted by
administrators at Highland Hos
pital in Oakland yesterday after
noon.
Burn victims from the fires
would probably not be brought to
Stanford Hospital because nearby
Valley Medical has a specialized
burn center. If Valley Medical had
an overflow, however, "Stanford
could take care of [burn patients]
if they had to — as a back up," the
nurse said.
Children are the ones most
likely to be brought to the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospi
tal.

down. He said anger over the uni

According to Berkeley senior
Steven Hines, "The horizon [was]
lit up like the sun [was] coming
up."
He summed up the reaction of
many Berkeley students.
"It's not close enough so you
feel immediately threatened, but
it's not far enough that you can

Hines said he helped a friend
evacuate the burning hills.

Police and fire officials
"wouldn't let us go get her. We
went up a back way to pick her

Albany firefighter Ed Jones,
who was working in the Clare

Hospitals prepare
No victims from the East Bay
fires were brought to the Stanford
Hospital as of 1 a.m., but hospital
administrators were prepared for
a flood of additional patients.
"We haven't called in extra
staff yet, but we're ready to," said
a nurse. She said people in charge
of each hospital department were

According to the supervisor,
administrators in regional hospi

The hospital was contacted by
administrators at Highland Hos

Burn victims from the fires
would probably not be brought to
Stanford Hospital because nearby
Valley Medical has a specialized
burn center. If Valley Medical had
an overflow, however, "Stanford
could take care of [burn patients]
if they had to — as a back up," the

A firefighter stands next to the burned-out remains of a car in the
Oakland hills. The blaze spread over an area of about 1,500 acres.
The fire that raged throughout
1,500 acres in the East Bay was a
mere smoke cloud for many at
Stanford, but for some it struck
closer to home.
Last night, as she watched her
neighborhood burning on televi
sion, Stanford sophomore Steph
anie Cawthon could not stop
thinking about what she would tell
her future children.
"I can't tell my kids this is
where I grew up," she said. "I
don't have a history."
Her family escaped unharmed
at noon when the houses across
the street began to burn. But the
massive residential fire in the
Berkeley and Oakland area de
stroyed her home of the last six
years. Cawthon's all-wood house,
located on stilts on a hillside next
to California Highways 13 and
24, burned to the ground.
"My reality is gone. Where I
learned how to drive is gone,"
she said quietly.
"You're always prepared for an
earthquake, but you're not pre
pared for a Firestorm."
At least one other Stanford
student lost her home. More than
60 staff and faculty members live
in the East Bay cities of Oakland,
Berkeley and surrounding com
munities, and many found them
selves within miles — even blocks
— of the flames.
Some were forced to evacuate,
while others opened their homes
to displaced friends and relatives.

A Piedmont resident tries invain to save his home from devastating flames. He, like hundreds of others, lost his home to yesterday's East
Bay fire. Blazes swept over 1,500 acres last night.
Berkeley study yesterday morning
grading papers when she noticed a
strange orange cast had come over
the light in the room. When she
looked up, she saw the hills of
Berkeley up in flames.
"I lived in war zones [in the
Middle East] and I've lived
through an earthquake," said
Elena Lifschitz. "And I've never
been this frightened in my life."
English lecturer Robin Joly's
north Berkeley home stands one
half mile from the Claremont
Hotel, the central Berkeley struc
ture viewed as the city's greatest
fire hazard.
"If the Claremont holds, we
will," said Joly at 10:15 last night.
Joly said she had packed her
car with valuables such as pictures
and papers that "you can't replace
and insurance companies can't
pay you for."
Music Prof. Karol Berger,
whose home is also near the hotel,
said, "We calculated that if the
hotel catches fire, we will have to
evacuate because we are very
close."
He said he felt helpless yester
day watching the fire approach his
home. I "had to get used to the
idea that my house could disap
pear," he said.
At 10 p.m. yesterday, Berger
said his 6-year-old daughter was
sleeping and that the family would
spend the night in the house, but
if necessary, the family could
escape in three minutes.
Stanford Linear Accelerator
official Hugh Steckel's Oakland
house was several miles away
from the blaze, but he was hosting
several friends whose houses had
burned down.
"We have their parakeets hang

ing from our ceiling and a couple
of cats around the house, and
we're sitting around a big carton
of Chinese food and trying to fig
ure out what to do next."
Steckel said his friends did not
have the opportunity to save many
belongings, but they had taken
personal papers, "especially insur
ance policies."
And the question of what to
save was on the minds of almost
everyone in the East Bay yester
day. History Prof. James Sheehan
said he would grab his research
notes if he were forced to evacu
ate.
Some East Bay residents won't
be able to come to work today.
Many major freeways are closed
and commuting "will be a night
mare," said Bennett Smith, a
SLAC employee who lives in Oak
land.
"I'll bet you you can add at
least two hours to any commute
(from the East Bay)," Smith
said.
Berkeley hills ablaze
All classes at UC-Berkeley are
canceled today, and officials esti
mate that about 1,000 students
were evacuated from the Berkeley
campus on account of the fire,
including 400 students from Clark
Kerr Hall, a campus dormitory,
and residents of 18 off-campus
fraternities and apartments at the
bottom of the burning hills.
Many have been moved to Unit
Three, another on-campus resi
dence where cots have been set up.
According to Daily Californian
editor T. Miller, "It is unes
timable" how many students are
displaced because Berkeley resi
dences are so dispersed.
"Thousands more students live
in apartments in the hill areas,"

he said, adding that no students
are believed to be killed or injured.
A Red Cross shelter was set up
in the student union building at
the invitation of student govern
ment leaders. By 10 p.m., about
1,000 local residents were there,
he said.
"They're packing their belong
ings and escaping from their
homes with nothing but a pair of
socks and shorts," Miller said.
Tina Rhee, a UC-Berkeley
senior, was one of hundreds of fra
ternity and sorority members who
evacuated their houses last night.
Rhee, a member of the Gamma
Phi Beta sorority, said there did
not appear to be immediate dan
ger to her house, but members
and fire officials wanted to reduce
the risk from the fast-moving
blaze.
"Being able to see the flames,
we started to pack up," Rhee said.
But, she added, "The general
feeling was that [the firel wasn't
going to burn right where we
lived, but we wanted to be safe."
Rhee said a friend's apartment
had burned down.
Miller said he couldn't remem

down. He said anger over the uni
