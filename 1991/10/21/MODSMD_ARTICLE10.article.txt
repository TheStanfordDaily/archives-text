## You can't complain 
### 
Students should feel
lucky to have what
they do on the Farm

SURE, IT TAKES DAYS FOR
maintenance to replace a
lightbulb, and RAs pester
students too much to attend pro
grams.
These and other student com
plaints certainly have some merit,
but they can't hold a candle to the
squalid conditions — both materi
al and philosophical — found in
equally prestigious universities
around the world.
Students have spent a lot of
time this year complaining about
food service, most notably the
fact that personal cooks were
removed from Row Houses. They
have also complained about the
inconvenience of getting new
meal cards.
Students complain that dorm
custodians don't clean up their
messes fast enough; mailing a spe
cial package is always a chance to
gripe at the Stanford Post Office;
any line at Stanford is considered
by many to be a personal affront;
students complain about distribu
tion requirements that limit their
academic freedom. . . .
However, when these concerns
are compared with those at uni
versities around the world, such
as in the Soviet Union and Peru,
they seem petty and somewhat
selfish.
At prestigious Moscow State
University, 11,000 students live in
one 50-story dorm, and food ser
vice can't possibly feed them all.
Much cooking is done by students
on their own floors, where there
are only three burners for every
125 students.
Last year, after students waited
the standard hour in line for food
one night, 300 of them were strick
en with salmonella.
The waste-disposal system is so
poorly designed that students

throw trash in the hall kitchens.
Thus, rats and vermin infest the
halls and eating areas. Hall main
tenance staff does not exist.
Mail is thrown in a heap on the
floor and sorted through by stu
dents, hoping that their packages
haven't been stolen already.
Meanwhile, in Peru, political
and economic class differences
cause great difficulties for top uni
versity students.
Only 25 percent of all high
school graduates can think about
leaving their families to attend col
lege rather than working. Of these,
very few can afford the top univer
sities.
La Catolica University is consid
ered one of the best, affordable
schools in the country, with excel
lent programs in law, humanities
and engineering. Unfortunately,
when a student is admitted to this
school, he or she must declare a
track, and cannot take courses
from different programs.
The only noteworthy free state
school is overrun by followers of
The Shining Path, the country's
brutal Maoist insurgents. Those
who aren't members of this group
are barred from dorms and dining
halls, and suffer blatant political
discrimination. The school exists
as a refugee camp for Shining Path
members.
Stanford's student problems are
fairly small potatoes.
While Stanford students are
complaining to their friends about
having to type a 9-digit PAC to call
long distance on our private
phone, a Soviet student is being
connected to a wrong number after
having waited in his hall for nearly
an hour to use the pay phone.
While students berate the Fac
ulty Senate for adding two extra
DRs, a student in Peru is not able
to continue her studies in music
because she declared an economics
major.
So when the budget ax starts
its descent this week, keep per
spective. There are millions of stu
dents who would jump for your
space.
