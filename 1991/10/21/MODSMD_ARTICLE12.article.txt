IT AMAZES ME SOMETIMES WHAT
a prominent role race plays in our
society. People often attribute their
identities, their emotions and their asso
ciations, or lack thereof, to reasons stem
ming from race.
If you watch anything political, from
an election to a confirmation hearing to
an educational restructuring, you're sure
to find race an issue.
I got lucky my freshman year in that
my dorm was very attuned to dealing
with issues of race in an easy, non-con
frontational manner. We didn't need to
have panels and speakers; we saw the
value in talking to each other,
I have never learned so much about
Jewish, Asian, Hispanic, and white cul
ture in my life. I learned that the black
experience wasn't one distinct thing, but
a multi-fragmented, multi-focused evolu
tion.
According to many of my friends in
other dorms this was not the universal
experience. Race was an unappetizing,
tense subject that made people squea
mish. Ask a simple question and you'll
end up with an hour-long lecture on
oppression, guilt and hatred that you
really don't want to hear.
However, a stranger thing is how
much people try not to talk about race. I
always meet people who, only after a
comfort zone is established, have a couple
of burning questions they always wanted

to ask a black person. That's fine with
me, though I often wonder why it's taken
them 20 years to find a black person to
whom they could pose these questions.
However, for the most part, I think
people here just don't talk about race
with each other, and that's where things
get dangerous.
When people don't talk they don't ask
questions. When no one asks questions
they leave room for assumptions and
misconstructions. These twin problems
lead to statements or actions, usually
made with the best intentions, that cause
all hell to break loose.
When I read the critique of the Omega
Psi Phi party flyer in the Review I was
angered. I found the article too caustic
and rather insensitive.
I thought the author could have made
the point without doing things like refer
ring to the hairstyle of the African war
rior depicted in the flyer as "a crop-dust
ed hair-do like that of the 'House-
Party."' Statements like that stand on
the brink of the offensive.
Even more, there were many ques
tions posed and statements made by the
author that revealed his ignorance of
black culture. If he had stopped any black
student in White Plaza they would have
explained to him that a lot of the things
he thought had reference to race or anti
white feelings were merely word plays on
a popular song or styled on symbolism

special to the Omegas.
I'm sure that, in defense, he would
counter that it's not easy for a white stu
dent to approach a black student with
ignorant questions or angry accusations.
I'd have to agree with him. If black
people want people of other backgrounds
to learn more about us we have to deal
with answering questions that can be
upsetting and offensive.
One thing we'll all find true of this life
is that it's usually easier to keep quiet
and avoid waves. But easier isn't always
better. This is the last stop on the educa
tional train; after we leave Stanford
there'll be little room for "dinner-time
discussions" or all-nighters.
Race isn't going away. It's getting to
be a bigger issue and, if we don't start
learning to understand each other, a big
ger problem. If we want to have a real
diverse Stanford community and not the
multicultural mess we recurrently end
up with, we have to have the courage to
go out on some limbs.
