## Need-blind admissions fosters economic discrimination 
### 
CERTAINLY EVERYONE realizes
Stanford students hail from dis
proportionately affluent back
grounds. According to the Office of
Admissions, in a recent incoming class a
large majority of students' parents
earned more than $60,000 per year;
about one fifth of students' parents
earned more than $150,000 per year. In
contrast, the average US family earns
somewhat less than $40,000.
Why is the Stanford student body so
economically homogeneous — that is,
rich? Perhaps because rich students pos
sess myriad greater opportunities to
engage in the activities which impress,
or produce the achievements which
impress, the Stanford admissions office,
such as:
• Receive superior education at excel

lent schools — often private and expen
sive;
• Utilize tutors — hired for a fee;
• Enroll in standardized test prepara
tion courses — again, expensive;
• Intern at prestigious institutions —
usually for little or no compensation;
• Perform community service — for
free;
• Develop artistic or musical talent
through private lessons, with the best
equipment — again, expensive;
• Travel overseas to acquire an "inter
national" perspective;
• Claim Stanford alumni, often
wealthy, as parents; and so on.
Stanford prides itself on its "need
blind" admissions policy, which it asserts
places all students on a level plain. How
ever, this policy, by ignoring the real,

uneven plain sculpted by rich students'
advantages, perpetuates classism.
Stanford effectively rejects the idea
that economic disadvantages hinder
poorer students from achieving, and it
effectively discriminates against these
students. Admissions statistics clearly
reveal this pattern.
Of course, Stanford's laudable com
mitment to affirmative action in admis
sions results in greater economic as well
as racial diversity, because, in general,
white students' parents earn more
money than parents of students of color.
However, this policy creates economic
diversity only as a "side-effect" and fails
to endorse the concept explicitly. As a
result, it falls short of fully benefitting
poorer students of color.
A need-blind admissions policy is

analogous to a "color-blind" admissions
policy, which Stanford correctly rejects
because it effectively discriminates
against students of color.
Thus, it is not only unjust but also
inconsistent for Stanford to then
endorse need-blind admissions; indeed,
the arguments against it seem similar to
those against color-blind admissions.
In short, regardless of budget implica
tions, Stanford should preserve its affir
mative action policy but eliminate its
need-blind admissions policy, and
replace it with "need-conscious" admis
sions, or targeted recruitment of poorer
students. Only then will Stanford exem
plify meritocracy and approach total
diversity.
