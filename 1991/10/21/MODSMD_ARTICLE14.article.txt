# Students have been more involved in past presidential searches
## 
### 
We agreed with many points of the
editorial regarding the Presidential
Search Committee. However, it appears
that in focusing energy on the ASSU, the
editorial ignored some relevant history.
The editorial asked "can two students
represent the student body any better
than one student can?" Our answer is,
emphatically, YES. Indeed, it has been
Stanford's tradition to involve students
maximally in the search process.
One article from the February 13th,
1980 Stanford Daily illustrates the point.
"When (Richard) Lyman was selected in
1970, separate committees were estab
lished for faculty, students and alumni."
An article from the February 22nd,
1980 Stanford Daily outlined the search
process that ultimately yielded President
Donald Kennedy. The search proceeded

in three stages.
First, faculty, students and alumni
compiled nominations. The groups
worked separately, with a 11-member
faculty committee, and an eleven-mem
ber student committee. The alumni
solicited nominations through the mail.
During the second stage, two students
and two alumni joined the faculty com
mittee for interviews with and considera
tion of a short list of candidates.
Finally, this joint committee submit
ted a very short list of finalists to the
eight-member Board of Trustees' Search
Committee for selection.
This entire process took less than six
months.
The 11-member student committee
in 1980 consisted of two students from
thnic organizations, two COP mem
bers, and one each from an academic
organization, a women's group, and a
political or social action group. In addi
tion, there were four at-large members
— two undergraduates and two gradu
ates.
Unfortunately, staff members were

left out of the formal process as outlined
above.
At this crucial juncture in Stanford
history, it seems important to formally
involve all interested and affected parties
in the search process, since the success of
any future president will depend on the
support and backing of all these parties.
In addition, it is only fair to allow
presidential candidates to interact with a
broad cross-section of the community
they could lead in the near future, to get
a flavor of the kinds of issues, dilemmas,
strengths and assets that are inherent at
Stanford.
The current composition of the search
committee does not adequately take into
account these factors, and should be
revamped in order to restore confidence
in the process.
It is our belief that it is in Stanford's
best interest to be more inclusive of the
Stanford community in the search pro
cess, both for the sake of the community
as well as the candidates.
