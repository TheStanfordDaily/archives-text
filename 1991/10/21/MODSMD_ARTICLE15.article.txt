# The
						benefits of leaf-blowing do not match the ecological costs
## 
### 
Recently the air quality in the Bay
Area has been poor. Walking along Palm
Drive from Palo Alto at 7:30 a.m. one
can already smell the smog.
This makes it hard to understand
why once a week one is greeted by the
roar of gasoline powered leaf-blowers at
the Segal sculpture in front of the
Physics Building.
Clouds of dust billow up. The air is
heavy with exhaust fumes. The fumes
enter the air-intake systems of the sur
rounding engineering buildings and are
then enjoyed by everyone.
Somehow I doubt that anyone objects
to a few leaves out of place. Maybe a
clean up once a month would suffice
with other types of equipment.
