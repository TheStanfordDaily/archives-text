## Polo splits 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team
contributed to the Cardinal victo
ries at USC this weekend by
defeating the Trojans 6-4. That
earned the squad a split, after an
8-7 loss to UCLA.
The weekend was significant
for the No. 7 Cardinal, not only
because the win against No. 6
USC increased chances of earn
ing a spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment, but also because the team
immediately travelled home to
play the 1990 European champi
onship team. The Mladost club
team from Croatia defeated the
Cardinal 13-8.
The Cardinal began the week
end with a near-upset of UCLA.
With 52 seconds left in the final
quarter, Wolf Wigo scored to tie
the game at 7-7. Chip Blanken
horn was then ejected for a con
troversial delay-of-game call and
the Bruins were able to take
advantage of the six-on-five situ
ation by scoring with 27 seconds
left in the game.
"The advantage UCLA had
over us was their ability to score
in man-up situations." coach
Dante Dettamanti said.
Wigo, the leading Cardinal
scorer for the season, finished
the game with four goals and
Blankenhorn had two. In Satur
day's 'must win' situation
against USC, Wigo and Antonio
Busquets led the team with three
goals apiece. "The future looks
pretty bright because all goals
but two were scored by freshmen
or sophomores," Dettamanti
said.
Freshman goalkeeper Jack
Bowen made his first collegiate
start against UCLA, recording
nine saves. He played the first
half of the USC game, but with
the score tied in the third quar
ter, Dettamanti, on a hunch, put
in sophomore goalie Larry
Bercutt. The veteran completely
shut out the Trojans for the
remainder of the game.
"Larry played like a man pos
sessed," Dettamanti said. "He
played the best half of water polo
in his career at Stanford. If he
can play like that for the rest of
the season, we have an excellent
chance of playing in NCAA's."
Jim Cairns filled in for Bowen
and Bercutt in yesterday's game
against Mladost Zagreb and
played well.
The club team from Croatia
attracted a crowd of 300 Croatian
Americans. The fans brought
Croatian national flags and signs
protesting the civil war in
Yugoslavia.
Hole man Dubravko Simenc,
the leading scorer of the Yugosla
vian national team, was held to
only one goal, but what a goal it
was. After the Cardinal had got
within one goal of Mladost, the
Croatian team responded with
three straight goals and a final
dramatic helicopter backhand
shot by Simenc that dropped the
jaws of everyone present.
