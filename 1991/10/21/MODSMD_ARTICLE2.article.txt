OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -
A windswept firestorm
roared through a residential
area in the hills above Oak
land yesterday, killing at
least 10 people, engulfing
hundreds of homes and forc
ing residents into the streets,
authorities said.
Frightened, ash-covered
residents fled their homes,
clutching their belongings as
the huge flames whipped in
the gusts behind them. Above
the hills, a huge cloud of
black smoke turned day to
dusk, casting a brown pall as
far as San Francisco, 15 miles
away.
Alameda County Super
visor Don Perata said the
fire had claimed the lives of
10 people, including one
police officer and five mem
bers of a family attempting
to flee the onrushing flames.
"It is a terrible disaster,"
Gov. Pete Wilson said as he
toured the scene yesterday
evening. Wilson declared the
area in a state of emergency
and ordered the National
Guard placed on alert.
Oakland Mayor Elihu
Harris confirmed deaths
had been reported, but the
exact number was unclear.
He said hundreds of houses
had burned but said exactly
how many could not be con
firmed while the fire raged
on.
Harris said the blaze was
burning over 1,500 acres.
There was no immediate
report on the cause of the
blaze.
At least 100 people were
evacuated from the upscale
Claremont Hotel, and a Uni
versity of California spokes
man said more than 1,000
students were evacuated
from campus dormitories.
