# Card breaks Trojans
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
As USC's last-second game-tying field
goal try sailed wide to the right, 16 years of
Stanford frustration sailed away with it.
The missed kick sealed the Cardinal's 24-21
victory, the first over the Trojans since
1975, marking the first time Stanford has
reached the .500 mark (3-3) in three years.
"We thought it was a terrific game,"
understated Stanford coach Denny Green.
"It could have gone either way, the excite
ment of the guy going for the field goal
with no time left made it even more
thrilling. We are pleased that we are 3-3
right now, we are pleased that we got our
first win of the (Pacific 10 Conference) sea
son, and we are pleased that we turned the
tide on USC."
The last time Stanford had won a game
against USC most of the current players
were mastering blocks of wood, not blocks
of people. The last victory was a long time
ago, and Cardinal football players were will
ing to do all they could to see that the losing
streak did not continue.
"I was a little shocked that they went for
the field goal, but I just took one knee and
prayed that it wouldn't go," said Stanford
quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
With Stanford leading 17-7 going into
the fourth quarter, it probably did not seem
that any divine intervention would be need
ed, but USC switched from the run to a
more intense passing attack and took a 21-
17 lead on two Deon Strother touchdowns.
"We made mistakes," linebacker Dave
Garnett said. "We had made mistakes earli
er, but our effort had made up for it. This
time they just came out and played the way
they were capable of playing."
What had been a fairly slow game was
suddenly turned up more than a notch. The
Trojan fans that had once booed their
team's lack of success were now turning the
Los Angeles Coliseum into a zoo of noise,
but with 3:37 left, Stanford proved it was
up to the task.
Stenstrom opened the drive with an 11-

yard pass to Chris Walsh for the first down,
but Stenstrom was knocked out of the game
for two plays, and backup Jason Palumbis
came into the game to give the team anoth
er first down.
With 1:35 left in the game Stanford was
faced with fourth down. Stenstrom found
Milburn along the right side for the first
down plus, as the speedy halfback shook off
tacklers for 22 yards, bringing the Cardinal
to the USC 12-yard line.
Tension was the emotion of the moment
as Stenstrom's first two passes were incom
plete. With the stadium literally shaking
under the weight of the screaming Trojan
fans, Stanford hoped that the third time
would be a charm, and it was. Going to the
man who had produced so much over the
course of the game, Stenstrom found Walsh
in the left corner of the end zone for the
score. The point after kick made the score
Stanford 24, USC 21.
"I just looked inside to Chris Walsh and
he made a great move (to get open)," Sten
strom said. "He had been playing great all
day. He beat [the defender I to the corner
and I just laid the ball in and let him run it
down."
The touchdown was the second of the
day for the senior receiver, in a game where
he caught nine balls for 174 yards, includ
ing a 71-yard romp for his first score.
"Chris Walsh is leading the conference
in receptions and we need to start thinking
about him like we think about a lot of
other great players," Green said. "He is
really playing well. He is leading the
league and he has earned it; he's a gutty
The Trojans moved into scoring posi
tion, but the day belonged to Stanford.
The Cardinal may have lost its lead, but
never its composure, and in the end that is
what mattered most.
"We knew we had a chance," Milburn
said. "We had plenty of time to do what we
had to do, there was no need to rush. We
had been there before, we had done the two
minute offense in practice; it was just a mat
ter of us executing, and we did just that."
