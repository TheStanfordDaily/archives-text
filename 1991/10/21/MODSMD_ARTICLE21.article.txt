# Men's soccer ties Santa Clara
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
They came, they saw, they ... well, but
they almost conquered. The Stanford
men's soccer team emerged from Santa
Clara Friday night with a mixture of ela
tion and frustration, tying the No. 1 Bron
cos, 1-1 in one of the most physical games
of the season for the Cardinal.
Stanford (8-2-4) came into the match
unranked and hungry. The squad was rid
ing a four-game winning streak and
hadn't given up a goal in two weeks. Santa
Clara (12-1-1) was hungry for reasons of
its own. The Broncos, were upset by the
University of San Francisco 3-0 Tuesday.
While a drop in the polls for Santa Clara
was certain, a victory over the up-and
coming Cardinal would have salvaged
some votes for the club.
Early on, it looked as though Santa
Clara would breeze to a win. Although no
one scored in the first half, the period was
dominated by the Broncos. Stanford
looked nervous, managing only one shot
on goal in the half, and depending on long
clearing kicks from fullbacks Jason Vana
cour and Jeff Kogl on more than one occa
sion.

The second half looked like it was going
to be a complete reversal of the first. Less
than two minutes into the period, Santa
Clara's Matt Rast scored his fifth goal of
the season, converting from the left side of
the goal on forward Alberto Cruz's cross
ing pass.
Six minutes later, Stanford tied the
score on one of the strangest goals of the
season for the Cardinal. Senior Brandon
Farley, a fullback known for his 50-yard
throw-ins, lofted the ball towards the
mouth of the Bronco net. Santa Clara
keeper Kevin Rueda committed on the
throw-in, but was unable to make a play
on the ball.
In the ensuing scramble for possession,
Stanford's Lance Killian took a shot
which appeared at first to be saved by the
backpedaling Rueda. After a short confer
ence, however, the referees ruled that
Rueda blocked the ball from within the
mouth of the goal and awarded Killian his
second score of the season.
Both teams had several scoring oppor
tunities in the remainder of the second
half and two overtime periods, but were
unable to convert.
Stanford's real play of the game, how
ever, occurred with less than four minutes

to go in regulation. The Broncos' Cameron
Rast broke free on the right wing, and shot
towards the crossbar from less than ten
yards out. Cardinal goalie Kyle Krpata
made an incredible block, but was unable
to control the ball, and deflected off of the
bar and rebounded back to Rast.
Again, Rast shot from short range, this
time lining one low and to Krpata's left.
The Cardinal junior instinctively turned
toward the shot, stopping it with his body
and making one of his most sensational
saves of the year. With his performance,
Krpata lowered his goals-against average
to a slim 0.97 per game.
Despite the dramatic contest, Stanford
coach Colin Lindores was not ecstatic about
his team's play. "It was a sloppy effort on
both sides," Lindores said. "The tie will
hurt us more than it will hurt them."
As an independent, the Cardinal must
continue to compete with teams like of
Santa Clara to remain in the chase for an
at-large NCAA Tournament birth. Will
Stanford make the field of 32 in Novem
ber? If it were up to Broncos coach Mitch
Murray, they would. "I was real
impressed with Stanford," Murray said.
"They played like a tournament team
tonight."
