### George Malone Staff writer 
At the end of the grueling volleyball
match Saturday night at UCLA's Wooden
Center, the crowd was screaming, the band
was playing and the Stanford women's team
captain Kristin Klein was in tears.
The No. 1 Cardinal had swept UCLA and
USC.
The road trip down to Los Angeles had
ended in disappointment for Stanford each
year since 1985, and this year the task of
beating No. 9 USC Friday, and then No. 3
UCLA Saturday, looked as difficult as ever.
Stanford came to USC with sophomore
Piper Hahn at setter instead of the injured
junior Carrie Feldman, and Hahn was com
fortable at the helm from the first serve as
the Cardinal won 15-4, 8-15, 17-16 and 15-
9.
"Piper played really well tonight. Carrie
probably could play if she had to, but Piper
did a great job running the offense. That's
what depth is all about," coach Don Shaw
said.
Klein led Stanford's offense, tying her
season-high mark of 26 kills with only 2
errors for a stellar .444 hitting percentage.
Stanford crushed the Trojans in the first
game. In game two USC played well and the Car
dinal let down mentally and the Trojans won.
Game three was a nail-biter for everyone
as USC jumped to a 13-9 lead before Stan
ford could come back with some key saves
and hits to win. The Cardinal then cruised
through the fourth game with little trouble.
"We did everything we could to lose that
[third| game," Shaw said.
"The team was real calm during the
match . . . because we've grown as a team
and learned to trust each other more,"
Hahn said.
Next came the formidable Bruins.
Although the Cardinal had won 16 straight
matches, they had not beaten UCLA since

1987 and the Bruins had a home winning
streak of 51 consecutive matches.
The surprise of the night was the start
ing setter for the Cardinal.
"We didn't know [Feldman would startl
until right before the game. It was one hell
of an effort," Shaw said.
After winning game one with strong hit
ting and great defense, Stanford let a 14-12
lead in game two slip away and the Bruins
won. After going up 4-0 in the third, how
ever, UCLA began to slip.
The Cardinal finally tied the match at
eight and then pulled ahead to win.
Game four was all Stanford. The Cardi
nal looked unstoppable, and in the end, the
Bruins became filled with doubt. Stanford
won 15-11, 14-16, 15-10, 15-9.
"We have so much more confidence. We
stuck to our guns," Bev Oden said.
Concentration lapses had plagued the
Cardinal in previous matches over the
course of the season, everyone felt that this
time was different.
"I think we finally played every ball,
every contact like it was the most impor
tant one. We never got down," Klein said.
Klein led the Cardinal again with 21 kills
and only one error on the night for a .400
hitting percentage. Oden hammered 18 hits
home for a .324 percentage.
Nicole Appleman had one of her best
nights as a Cardinal, hitting .478 with 13
kills. Amy Cooper had 10 kills and 4 solo
blocks, Jennifer Jackson tied Klein for most
digs at 15, and junior Kristi Paaso played
extensively, hitting .273 for the match.
Feldman, playing in pain,gave an outstand
ing performance. "Carrie came out and
played 110 percent," Klein said.
Coach Shaw stressed the boost provided
by the crowd.
"We really appreciate that the crowd and
the band came. When I looked up in the
middle of game three and saw the Tree, I
knew we were in good shape," Shaw said.
