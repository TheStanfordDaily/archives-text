# Broncos break booters' streak

### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team saw its bid
for a perfect season end in dramatic fashion Fri
day night, losing a heartbreaker to No. 5 Santa
Clara, 2-1.
Although it was apparent from the start that
the Cardinal was not playing at its usual strato
spheric level, the game was an even contest that
was knotted up until less than five minutes were
left in the game, when a beautiful long crossing
pass led to a Santa Clara goal that won the spir
ited battle.
"We just didn't have it," coach Berhane Ande
berhan said of the team's first loss since a first
round loss in the NCAA tournament to UC-
Santa Barbara last November. "We had too
many players who were having an off day.
"ISanta Clara 1 still didn't outweigh us; it was
still an even game," Andeberhan continued. "The
team realizes this and has handled [the lossl well."
Santa Clara had several golden scoring oppor
tunities in the first half as did the Cardinal, but
the first half came to a close without a goal being
scored.
The second half opened with Santa Clara
picking up the pace offensively. Six minutes into
the period, Santa Clara botched an easy scoring
chance as golie Leslie Garrard ran out and
grabbed a ball that was just waiting to be
knocked in.
Santa Clara finally broke the deadlock at 56:07
in the game when Sherrie Buente dribbled and
passed brilliantly to Shannon Douglas, who had
to simply boot the ball into a wide-open goal as
Garrard had no chance to make save. The 1-0
score marked only the second time all season that
the Cardinal had trailed in a game.
It was after the first Bronco goal that Stan
ford played its best soccer of the contest, culmi
nating in what might have been the most spec
tacular Cardinal score of the year.
Sophomore Sarah Rafanelli raced after a
high-bouncing ball. Bronco goalkeeper Sue Wall
was also in persuit. It appeared that Wall was
going to win the footrace to the ball, but Rafanel
li leapt
headfirst toward the ball and jarred the ball
loose, sending it bouncing slowly into the Bronco
net to tie the game.
Rafanelli was hurt on the play and spent sev
eral moments on the ground before getting up to
an ovation from the appreciative Stanford sec
tion of the crowd.
Santa Clara missed two more chances to score
before Stanford made another run at the Bronco
defense. Junior Julie Foudy took the ball almost
the length of the field, causing two defenders to
trip over their own feet and faking out several
more, then fired a great cross which was hit just
over the Santa Clara net.
The constant noise of the huge Santa Clara
crowd seemed to pick the Broncos up and help
them score the deciding goal.
Although the team's first loss of the year was
obviously a disheartening experience, coach
Andeberhan believes that something positive
will probably come from the defeat.
"We just have to take the loss and start some
thing from it,"he said. "We learned a lot (from
the defeat) .. .we had a very good meeting after
the game, and talked about what we did well,
what we didn't do well ... hopefully, we'll meet
them again (at NCAA's) and we'll do what it
takes to beat them."
