# Lecturer tells of sexual harassment at law firm
## 
### Jason Montiel 
Her boss jokingly called her "little
girl," "cutie" and a "sneaky bitch," but
Business School Lecturer Connie Bagley
said she didn't file a complaint about the
male partner she worked under at a San
Francisco law firm since she believed her
career was on the line.
"I was largely dependent upon this
individual senior partner for my work,
for my promotions, for developing the
kind of career I was trying to (develop),"
Bagley, the author of a book called "Man
agers and the Legal Environment," told
an audience of 80 Friday.
In a speech titled "Sexual Harassment
and the Law," Bagley described the

harassment she experienced while work
ing for 12 years at a large law firm and
reflected on the recent testimony of Anita
Hill during Senate confirmation hearings
for Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas.
. She said victims of sexual harassment
are reluctant to come forward because
they fear it will ruin their careers.
Bagley said she complained in private
to other members of the firm, but word of
her dissatisfaction soon got back to her
boss.
He responded by reassigning her away
from a large, important project she was
working on, Bagley said. Other partners
in the firm sided with the boss, condemn
ing Bagley for speaking up.

"The types of things that you hear
about in terms of retaliation I think are
well-founded," said Bagley.
Bagley's boss eventually received a
slight pay cut because of the incident, she
said. But that only made things more dif
ficult on the job, where her boss contin
ued to deprive her of good assignments.
"I was never given an apology either
by the firm or by the partner," she said.
Bagley also described legal precedent
on sexual harassment, citing two particu
lar Supreme Court decisions that had a
great impact on the Senate's considera
tion of Hill's testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
One was Meritor Savings Bank vs.
Vinson (1986), in which the Court ruled

sexual harassment exists when a sexual
ly hostile environment exists on the job;
the other was Price Waterhouse vs. Hop
kins (1989), in which the Court held that
sex stereotyping constituted discrimina
tion.
These precedents added weight to
Hill's testimony before the Senate,
Bagley said. But many senators remained
confused as to why Hill did not come for
ward at the time of her harassment in the
early '80s, she added.
"Becoming labeled as someone who is
not a 'team player' ... is one of the
largest impediments to people coming
forward and complaining about sexual
harassment."
Bagley said she understood why Hill

did not keep notes of her alleged harass
ment and why Hill did not press charges
at the time of the incident.
"Generally, legal recourse is not the
best recourse," Bagley said, citing the
eight-year litigation of the Vinson case.
"Legally I could have done it. I probably
would have won.
"But that's not what I wanted to
spend the next Five years of my life doing.
I just wanted to keep being a good corpo
rate securities lawyer."
The only solution to harassment is to
prevent it from the beginning, Bagley
said. "I don't think we're ever going to
come up with a way where people can
comfortably come forward and not have
repercussions and not have reprisals."
