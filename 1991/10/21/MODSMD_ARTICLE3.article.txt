# Budget statement refined for public, released tomorrow
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Administrators struggled
this weekend to word tomor
row's announcement of prelimi
nary budget-reduction recom
mendations set by the Universi
ty Cabinet Thursday.
The statement will be the
first significant, public outline
of how Stanford will cut approx
imately 10 percent from its
$400-million permanent operat
ing budget.
In a 12-page document, the
president and provost will
unveil reduction targets Tues
day for the schools and adminis
trative areas and discuss the so
called "central initiatives" for
the University, such as under
graduate and graduate enroll
ment and overseas campuses.
Central initiatives are pro
grams that affect all parts of the
University and cannot be cut
exclusively from a particular
school or administrative area.
Richard Kurovsky, director
of University relations, said the
statement's complexity forced a
five-day lag time before the
announcement could be made.
"We knew the volume of
information that was needed,
and we couldn't immediately
announce all of the decisions in
a statement," he explained.
Key members of the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning spent sever
al hours yesterday afternoon
"going over the final wording of
the document," according to
Kurovsky.

Six of the nine members of
the executive committee attend
ed, including Provost James
Rosse, Senior Assoc. Dean of
Engineering Charles Kruger
and Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten.
University President Donald
Kennedy is currently in Toronto
for the meetings of the Associa
tion of American Universities
and will not return until
Wednesday.
But he helped prepare the
statement by fax, and Kennedy
and Rosse were also expected to
discuss the final version of the
statement late last night.
Friday morning the entire
cabinet budget committee met
for more than an hour to discuss
reduction targets set by the cab
inet Thursday.
