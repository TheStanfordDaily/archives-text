# Investigation of Delt House fire closes
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Local fire officials ended their
investigation this weekend of the
fire that gutted the former Delta
Tau Delta house, saying they
"highly suspect arson" but know
little else about how it began.
"It was definitely very suspi
cious in origin," said Battalion
Chief Donald Dudak of the Palo
Alto Fire Department. However,
investigators said the extensive

damage caused by the fire made it
impossible to discover even in
what section of the house the fire
began.
The investigation has been
passed along to the state fire mar
shals office.
The fire started early on the
morning of Oct. 11 in the con
demned wooden structure that was
formerly the Delt house. Fire offi
cials were called to the blaze at 2:03
am, and 48 firefighters struggled
for over an hour to bring the blaze

under control.
By the time they did, the struc
ture had burned to the ground.
State fire investigators searched
through the charred remains of the
house Oct. 16 with the aid of a dog
trained to detect residue of
flammable liquids. The dog found
no such evidence.
The building had been closed
to the public since it was damaged
in the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake. The University planned to
demolish it.

Since the earthquake, all water
and gas service to the house had
been cut off, and the house had
been surrounded with a chain
link and barbed-wire fence.
The Committee for the Pre
servation of Historic Stanford,
which fought to save the Delt
house from demolition by the
University, has offered a $1000
reward for information that
leads to the arrest and conviction
of the person responsible for the
fire.
