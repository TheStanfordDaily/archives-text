# Queerland protest tactics questioned, defended as persuasive tool by some
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
The tactics employed in the gay-rights
protest at a Centennial convocation more than
two weeks ago have sparked controversy over
the increasingly confrontational nature of gay
rights activism.
Along with other groups from the Bay Area,
Queerland — a Stanford gay-rights coalition —
figured prominently in the protests over the
veto of Assembly Bill 101, which would have
protected gays and lesbians from discrimina
tion on the job.
Protesters drowned out Gov. Pete Wilson's
speech during the Stanford convocation and
clashed with police outside the Quad afterward.
Since then, across campus questions have
emerged concerning the value and effectiveness
of the confrontational tactics used at the
protest, as well as other strategies used by
Queerland, including their highly visible stick
ers with statements such as "Queers Bash
Back" or "This Is Queer Space: Get Used To It."
According to member Sairus Patel, Queer
land strives toward "the empowerment of
'queers' as the main thrust, as opposed to per
suading homophobes not to be homophobes.
"We put ourselves first," he said. "We don't
try to educate straight people."
Patel pointed out the existence of the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Speaker's Bureau,

which works to educate people on gay issues
through panel discussions, and said that many
Queerland members sit on the panels the
Bureau offers as well.
Graduate student Steve Pitts, a Queerland
member, said he felt that comments his group
has been hearing, such as "you won't convince
anyone this way" or "these tactics aren't per
suasive" need to be addressed.
In his view, he said, the arguments are "not
often uttered by supporters, but by closet
homophobes."
But one gay undergraduate — who wished
to remain anonymous because he said he felt
"just as intimidated as Wilson by these people
(members of Queerland)" — said that he
thought the growing use of these confronta
tional tactics was making his life "harder" and
that the Queerland stickers and banners
"offended" him.
"I'm not empowered by intimidating peo
ple," he said. "It makes enemies of people on
the fence and even friends. No one likes to be
told what to do."
He said he thought Wilson had a right to free
speech, and that he saw the protesters as
demanding a right to not be discriminated
against, but at the same time they denied some
one else his rights.
He said he knew of other gays who felt the
same way he did, but he didn't want to disclose
their names.

With respect to the confrontational nature
of the Queerland stickers, Patel said, "There
can be many radical ideas on the stickers and
banners. You may not agree [with the ideas],
but they empower different parts of the queer
community, and you have to recognize that."
"The thing that's so shocking," Pitts said,
"are the things that are uttered at queers, by
people with the power to enforce them."
However, Pitts emphasized the importance
of realizing that the gay community at Stan
ford, or anywhere, is not a single, unified group
with one common opinion. He said his group
recognizes that, even with Queerland, "not
everybody agrees with everything, and when
someone disagrees, they stand aside."
Graduate student Rudi Gaudio, also a
member of Queerland, said his group's style
"scares gay people who are not fully out, who
are assimilationist or who have internalized
oppression."
Gaudio said he supports confrontational tac
tics as long as they are used with other tactics
such as consciousness-raising and negotiating
on a civil basis. He said he didn't agree with vio
lence, but he understood the anger of the peo
ple who threw things at Wilson.
"Violent tactics, especially property damage,
have to be seen in light of the ongoing violence
against gay people," he said. He pointed out the
high number of gays who are injured or killed
in incidents of gay-bashing.
