# Trojan horse charges dollie

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Senior staff writer 
Debbie Bain, a Stanford dollie, went to USC
on Saturday to cheer on the Stanford gndders.
To witness a war over pigskin. To bask in the
So-Cal sun.
She hadn't planned on horseplay.
But during a time-out in Saturday's Cardi
nal-Trojan football game the sophomore from
Louisiana had a close encounter of the equine
kind.
The dollies had lined up on the track ring
ing the football field to dance to the Stanford
Band's rendition of "I Wish" when Traveler,
"the beautiful white horse that appears at all
USC home football games with Trojan mascot
astride ran smack into Bain.
The horse's chest hit my face," she recalled
from the safer confines of her dorm room. The
horse did not "slightly graze" or "bump" Bain,
as other local media reported. Some eyewit
nesses said she was knocked nearly 10 feet and
senseless. "I don't remember any pain," she
said. "I guess I was in shock."
She was also in luck. The horse's hoofs
missed Bain, and she escaped with only "a cou
ple of scratches." The dollie was escorted off
the field and attended to by medical personnel.
Traveler — an 11-year-old Arabian — trot
ted off the field with the hapless horseman to
angry shouting by Stanford fans. "We want
glue," shouted some in the maddening throng.
After several minutes in the first-aid area,
Bain ran back onto the field, to the cheer of the
crowd, and danced again.
