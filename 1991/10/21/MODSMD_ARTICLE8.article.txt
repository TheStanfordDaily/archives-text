Now in their new home in the Fire
Truck House at the center of campus, lead
ers of the Stanford Women's Center hope
the move will be not only geographic, but
also symbolic, putting women's issues at
the center of campus attention.
"I think the community is entering a
new phase of student service," said
Women's Center Coordinator Quynh Tran.
"Because we have so many groups and the
center is so accessible, we can get a lot of
people's energy together to provide more
activities and programs."
The Women's Center serves as a meet
ing place and an administrative resource
for women's groups on campus.
Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe said it was especially important for
the center to move to the Fire Truck House
because it had been the only ethnic or cul
tural community center not located at the
center of campus.
The move from their previous office near
Toyon Eating Clubs brought together a
number of women's groups that had previ
ously worked separately or with no office
space at all.
The groups include Women Defending
Ourselves, the Society of Women Engi
neers, Aurora, Cap and Gown, Pro-Choice
Alliance, the Intersorority Council, Delta
Sigma Theta and the Stanford AIDS Edu
cation Project.
"There's more interaction (among
women's groups) than ever before," Tran
said, adding that while separate organiza
tions will continue to work on their own
projects, they will now be able to cooperate
on major projects such as Women's Hersto
ry Month.

The groups in the center are currently
testing the waters of their new relation
ships, Tran added. They have joint access
to the building and work out meeting times
by signing up for time in advance.
One of the groups housed in the
Women's Center is the Women's Center
Collective. Formally independent of the
other groups, the collective was one of the
driving forces behind the Women's Cen
ter's relocation.
Jennifer Pearson, a member of the col
lective, said it hopes to work more political
ly this year than it has done in the past.
She added that although the collective
has no specific mandate, leaders want to be
involved when political issues such as the
recent confirmation of Clarence Thomas to
the Supreme Court arise.
Many of the student organizations origi
nally housed at the Fire Truck House were
moved to other locations on campus, evok
ing mixed responses.
Leaders of several groups said the moves
did not pose a significant problem. "I really
had no qualms about it," said James Gray
of the Society of Black Scientists and Engi
neers. "We really didn't use the space in the
Fire Truck House."
Molly McKenna, business manager of
Mixed Company, said the new space at
Toyon is more practical for her group's
needs.
Students in other organizations, howev
er, were not pleased. Members of the Senior
Class Presidents and the Alpha Phi Omega
Service Fraternity said the Fire Truck
House had been a convenient headquar
ters.
Howe said the organizations were coop
erative about the move, despite competing
desires over the building's use.
