# After East Bay's inferno, painful memories remain
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
The fire that raged through
the hills above Oakland this
weekend has claimed at least 14
lives, destroyed 600 buildings and
caused an estimated $1.5 billion
in damages. And it continues to
take its toll on many residents of
Stanford and Palo Alto.
At least three Stanford stu
dents lost their homes to the fire.
Freshman Whitney Hischier, who
had gone home to her Berkeley
Hills home for a visit on Saturday,
said she learned from her mother
Sunday afternoon that their
house had caught on fire.
Hischier recounted what her
parents told her, saying that they
had gone out for breakfast Sunday
morning and returned home
around 11:30 a.m. to see a "40-foot
wall of flame coming toward the
house."
Hischier said her mother and
13-year-old sister grabbed some
photographs and files, threw
them into their car and drove off,
while her father stayed behind to
collect "anything he could find"
and stash it in a second car.
But Hischier said her father
forgot to bring the car keys, and
by the time he went back to the
house, "the flame was so close it
wasn't worth looking for them."
so her father walked down the hill
away from the blaze.
Only two streets away from
Hischier's house, the home of
freshman Jennifer Grim was also
engulfed in flames.
Grim said her mother returned
from an early morning appoint
ment Sunday to find that police
and fire officials had blocked off
the area and wouldn't let her go
near the house.
Although Grim's mother left a
message on Sunday saying that
she was okay, she didn't yet know
whether the house had been
spared the flames.
"I was living on pins and needles
all (Sunday) night," Grim recalled.
Monday morning, Grim learned
that her house had burned to the
ground.

The loss of the home is particu
larly unfortunate because her
father, an architect, designed and
built the home. "I lived there all
my life. A lot of memories are in
my house," Grim said.
Both students spoke with com
posure despite the loss of their
homes. "I was really upset at first,"
Hischier said, but now, "you have
to accept that there's nothing you
can do until it's quieted down."
"It's a big thing, but I guess I
can handle it," Grim said. Still, she
added, she does not want to return
to the place where her house once
stood. "It would be too devastating
for me to see all of that gone."

The fire also destroyed the
home of Stanford sophomore
Stephanie Cawthon.
One freshman, Geoff Donaker,
was luckier. He said his house
escaped the approaching fire
because some neighbors stayed in
the area after everyone else,
including Donaker's parents and
two younger siblings, evacuated.
Donaker said sparks from a
block or two away set the wood
shed in his backyard on fire, but
the neighbors put out the flames
with a garden hose, which fire
fighters speculate kept the house,

Brian Bedelt — Daily
Palo Alto firefighters load up their gear yesterday evening at the Alma Street fire station. The team was sent to relieve
crews at the scene of the weekend's firestorm in the East Bay hills. Two thousand Berkeley students were evacuated
from their residences Sunday because of the fire and at least three Stanford students lost their homes.
as well as the rest of the block,
from catching fire.
"I was pretty happy to find out
my house was still there," Don
aker said.
As these students coped with
personal misfortunes, other
members of the local community
tried to prevent further loss.
The Palo Alto Fire Department
has expended a considerable por
tion of its resources to aid fire
fighters in the East Bay, accord
ing to Fire Chief Jack Leslie.
Three of the department's
eight engines and 11 of its 24 fire
fighters were sent to the East Bay
on Sunday to help contain the
fire.

Shortly after 3 p.m., one
engine was called to join a strike
team — a group of five engines,
each with four firefighters, from
across the county that responds
to major emergencies. The other
two engines were sent out in a
subsequent strike team a few
hours later.
A spokesperson for Santa
Clara County said six strike
teams had been called in from
Santa Clara County alone.
Yesterday's fires were the
worst the Bay Area has witnessed
in decades, according to several
firefighters.
Palo Alto Fire Department
Battalion Chief Don Shaw said a
replacement crew was sent in last
night to extinguish the fire, which
was contained yesterday by fire
fighters.
An estimated 150 people were

iryured in the blaze, according to
state and local officials. But even
with the high number of injuries,
Stanford Hospital remains rela
tively unaffected by the fire.
Despite the fear that area hos
pitals will be overrun with fire
victims, Stanford Hospital has
not admitted any, according to M.
A. Malone, a spokesman for the
hospital.
The hospital was placed on
alert Sunday night after the fire
broke out, but called in no addi
tional personnel, Malone said.
Meanwhile, the Haas Center
for Public Service Clearinghouse,
which links the campus to local
community agencies, is trying to
aid some of the 5,000 people
forced to evacuate their homes.
