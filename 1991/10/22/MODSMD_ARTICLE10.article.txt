# Oakland fire damage estimated at $1.5 billion
## Blaze that burned hundreds of structures may be the worst in California history 
### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - An
armada of fire trucks swarmed over
the hills above Oakland yesterday as
firefighters contained a deadly $1.5
billion blaze that left at least 400 hill
side houses in smoldering ruins.
The massive fire — one of the worst
in U.S. history — raced through afflu
ent districts overlooking San
Francisco Bay on Sunday and burned
through the night. It killed at least 14
people, injured nearly 150 and chased
5,000 out of their homes, according to
city and state officials.
Ten people were reported missing,
and at least 200 non-residential build
ings were destroyed.
Dawn brought an eerie sight: banks
of gray smoke swirling above black
ened neighborhoods, soft winds sigh
ing through streets as quiet as a ghost
town.
"You could see terrible devasta
tion," Gov. Pete Wilson said after sur
veying the area by helicopter. "What
showed up ... as burning hot spots in
that black of night, this morning were
clearly the charred ruins of hundreds
of homes."
Wilson on Sunday declared an
emergency and said he is asking
President Bush to make the declara
tion on a national level.
Fires also raged in several Western

states, including Colorado, Oregon
and Washington. The largest fires
were in Montana, where wind of up to
70 mph was expected to fan flames
that had already consumed 200,000
acres.
In Oakland, Fire Chief Phillip
Lamont Ewell said the fire was con
tained at dawn and firefighters hoped
to have it under control by nightfall.
The ravenous blaze roared out of
the tinder-dry hills above Oakland and
Berkeley at about mid-day Sunday,
racing through fashionable neighbor
hoods tucked between woods and
canyons, many commanding sweeping
views of the bay.
Early damage estimates stood at
$1.5 billion, according to figures hand
ed out by city officials. The fire burned
over about 1,700 acres.
Destruction depended on the
caprices of the wind. At the Chabot
Canyon Racquet Club, only a few
twisted metal girders remained of the
main building. But next to the build
ing, tennis nets still stood over pristine
green courts.
Among the victims was a family of
five who died trying to escape their
burning home. A fire battalion chief
and a police officer also were killed,
said Alameda County Supervisor Don
Perata.

At least 50 people, including three
firefighters, were treated at hospitals
for burns, smoke inhalation and other
injuries, officials said.
The cause of the fire was not imme
diately known. Mayor Elihu Harris
said it did not appear to be arson.
Thousands spent the night in shel
ters, including 1,000 students evacuat
ed from a dormitory at the UC-
Berkeley. The Red Cross said about 60
people remained in shelters yesterday.
About 100 people were evacuated
from the landmark Claremont Hotel
when the fire appeared to be threaten
ing it. It was spared, however.
The fire started at about 11 a.m.
Sunday.
Frightened residents hurled pets,
children and keepsakes into their cars
and headed for the flatlands, some
swerving past flaming debris as they
hurried down the narrow roads. Others
dashed down ash-covered lanes, their
arms laden with whatever they could
grab.
"The fire started rushing around
and jumping from one place to anoth
er," said 81-year-old Rosa York, who
fled her home on Sunday with her
husband, Robert. "It was like the
dance of the devil. We were lucky to
get out."
With at least 600 buildings

destroyed, it ranked as one of the
worst fires in the nation's history,
perhaps the worst in California since
the fire that followed the great 1906
earthquake in San Francisco.
It drew comparisons to the wild
fire that destroyed 470 homes and
other buildings in Santa Barbara
County in June 1990 and a 1923
brush fire in Berkeley that destroyed
584 homes.
In dollar terms, the National Fire
Protection Association said, the
Oakland fire rivaled the Great
Chicago Fire of 1871. Property loss in
that blaze has been estimated at $1.8
billion in 1990 dollars, only $300,000
more than the Oakland blaze.
Damage in the Santa Barbara fire
was estimated at more than $250 mil
lion.
Insurers rushed agents to the
Oakland and Berkeley hills yesterday
to survey damage and start writing
claim checks that could eventually
run into hundreds of millions of dol
lars.
State Insurance Commissioner
John Garamendi set up a toll-free
hotline to answer insurance ques
tions from fire victims. He also said
his department "is asking insurance
companies to bring their checkbooks
with them" when they tour the area.
