## Party on, Stanford

Irresponsible actions
will invariably lead
to strict enforcement

FOR MANY OF US, college is
the first time we begin to
think of ourselves as adults.
Stanford offers us an opportunity
to show the world who we are and
what we can do. With this in mind,
let's review some of this year's
notable achievements:
• An undergraduate was arrest
ed for urinating in the Toyon
lounge while in a drunken stupor;
• A 17-year-old freshman was
allegedly coerced with the use of
alcohol into participating in sexual
activity;
• Breaking dorm windows has
become a nightly drunken ritual;
and
• A month after classes started,
alcohol binges are still de rigeur
among freshmen.
Despite the fact that it is illegal,
most Stanford students have
always tolerated the casual, social
use of alcohol by underaged
drinkers. However, events this year
suggest Stanford student culture
has become alcohol-centered and
may become alcohol-dependent.
To a certain degree, each new
class at Stanford creates its own
image, by which it is known. This
year's freshman class has been
heralded as one of the most diverse
and selective ever. But it is also
becoming recognized for its drink
ing as one of the most childish and
irresponsible in recent years.
Alcohol abuse is a social prob
lem, not just an individual con
cern. It can cause long-term health
problems. It increases vehicle acci
dents, causing injury and death. It
can trigger alcoholism in persons
genetically susceptible to the dis
ease and can lead to alcohol-depen
dency in others.
Moreover, an alcohol culture is
coercive; those who don't drink are
faced with being shut out of the

social mainstream. Persons who
think drinking is entirely a matter
of free choice should talk to some
one who does not drink and ask
that person how free he or she feels
in most campus social situations.
On a campus that prides itself
on individual freedom, people do
not respond well to moralizing
about alcohol abuse. But too often
we forget that individual freedom
must be accompanied by personal
responsibility.
The University's alcohol policy,
as it exists, is based on an opti
mistic but questionable belief in
students' sense of personal respon
sibility.
Formerly, Stanford effectively
had a "hands-off" policy regarding
student drinking. Last year, under
pressure from the federal govern
ment, the University stated it
would beef up that policy, but
clearly no crackdown has occurred.
This restraint has been cavalierly
interpreted by some students as
license to do whatever they can get
away with.
The University can and proba
bly will take steps to restrict stu
dent choice if events continue as
they have. It would be foolish not
to. If a student dies of alcohol poi
soning or if someone is killed by a
drunken student driving away
from a campus party, the Universi
ty will very likely be named in a
civil suit launched by survivors.
Stanford students are reminded
all the time that we're special,
elite, full of promise. We are
entrusted with a great deal of faith
by families and the University. Too
often, it seems, the result of this
praise is an arrogance brashly pro
claiming our right to flout laws we
think are not quite good enough
for us.
College, and freshman year in
particular, can be a great time. It's
understandable to let loose and
enjoy our newfound freedom. But
enough is enough. Alcohol con
sumption has reached reckless lev
els, and we should control our ado
lescent behavior before others
decide to do it for us.
