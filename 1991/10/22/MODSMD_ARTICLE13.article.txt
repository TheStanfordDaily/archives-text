Senate misled citizens by ignoring women 9 s issues

THINK IT'S A CRUEL
thing we're witnessing. It's a
harsh thing, a very sad thing,
and Anita Hill will be sucked into the . .
very thing she wanted to avoid most.
She will be injured and destroyed and
belittled and hounded and harassed —
real harassment, different from the sex
ual kind."
Well, I certainly am glad U.S. Senator
Alan Simpson is around to help me
understand that the cat calls and the
leering eyes as I ride the elevator of the
office building I work in and the kind
gentlemen who drive along beside me
offering "Hey baby, want a ride?" as I
walk down the street in the middle of
the day are not bothersome, do not dis
turb my peace of mind, do not threaten
me.

I am certainly glad the senator and
his colleagues are around to label Anita
Hill as a vindictive, spurned woman who
has little sense of professionalism and a
tentative grasp on sanity.
After all, we shouldn't actually
believe we can hold accountable men
who treat women as though women
were created for their convenience. We
shouldn't assume women have the same
right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness that the founding fathers
spoke of when they declared all men are
created equal.
How silly I was to think that perhaps
the American public would be genuinely
shaken by Anita Hill's allegations. Of
course, I'm a woman, so my logic may
well be impaired.
How silly of me to be surprised when

The New York Times informed its read
ers that sexual harassment is pervasive
in the workplace. Here I was thinking
that most people already knew that.
I suppose since that sort of article is
usually relegated to a paragraph in the
bottom corner of page 33, the American
public and the Senate were happily
unaware.
I suppose all of the women who have
experienced sexual harassment were
unaware as well. It couldn't possibly be
that they were reluctant to speak out
because they didn't want to lose their
jobs, because they didn't want to jeopar
dize their reputations, because they
didn't want to be dragged through the
mud.
Why did I even bother to get annoyed
when I realized the main concern for

most Americans was the travesty of the
Senate confirmation process and not the
travesty of the treatment that women
are subjected to, day after day after day?
This is my life we're talking about —
mine and that of half of the population.
The system of confirmation needs to be
drastically restructured, they say. So
does the position of women in this soci
ety. Perhaps as a start we could get a
few more than two women in the Sen
ate, but that will only be a start.
And now the nomination of Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court has been
confirmed. It is indeed a cruel thing
Simpson has witnessed. It's a very sad
and harsh thing for the women of this
country.
