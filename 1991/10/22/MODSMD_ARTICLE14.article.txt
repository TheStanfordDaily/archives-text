# Performers not the only ones hurt by cutting the arts
## 
### 
WE ALL KNOW STANFORD IS
struggling in order to get back
on its financial feet; decisions
must be made, and budget cuts must be
put into effect soon.
Somewhere along the line, however,
someone had the frightening idea that
maintaining the Drama Department and
the performance aspect of the Music
Department might not be very impor
tant.
With this in mind, I write to express
the fears of a performing-arts student in
the midst of pending departmental cut
backs. To slowly do away with the arts
at Stanford would be a grave mistake:
The students and community at large
would suffer the unfortunate effects.
Remember the Centennial Celebra
tion? Thousands of alumni crowded our
auditoriums to see the entertainment —
the Centennial Gaieties Revue (directed
by a graduate in drama and orchestrated
by two graduates in music), the Band,

the notable Ballet Folklorico, the Stan
ford Chamber-Chorale and the a cappel
la groups.
The Band and the Chamber Chorale
are associated with the Music Depart
ment, and the campus a cappella
groups, while not officially affiliated
with the Music Department, are com
prised of a number of music and drama
majors.
Not only does our University boast a
top medical and engineering school, but
it also has played host to innumerable
well-attended performance events. The
orchestra, which this summer completed
a whirlwind tour of Europe, consistently
packs a full house at Dinkelspiel audito
rium for its quarterly concerts.
Ram's Head's production of "Into the
Woods" last spring was deemed the
"best production in the last decade" by
faculty, students and patrons alike. Nei
ther of these organizations would exist
without substantial support from the

Music and Drama Departments.
In addition, and perhaps most impor
tantly, the deterioration of performance
at Stanford would drastically change the
makeup of the student population. A
native to Santa Clara County, I have
always been told Stanford is "the well
rounded school for the well-rounded stu
dent."
Whether this is currently true is a
matter of opinion, and some feel it is
more important to build a "research uni
versity," but there is no question that
without the arts, Stanford would surren
der an important part of its educational
diversity.
I chose Stanford not knowing what I
wanted to do but feeling quite sure that
once I did decide, resources would be
available. I'm glad I got here when I did.
For all I know, the Drama Department
might not exist in 1995.
The arts simply cannot be allowed to
die a slow death. Just think about how

much richer our campus is with Original
Winter One-Acts, a cappella dorm
shows, Spring Migration, noon concerts,
Gaieties . . . the list goes on and on. A
Stanford without all those things hurts
everyone — not just the performers.
