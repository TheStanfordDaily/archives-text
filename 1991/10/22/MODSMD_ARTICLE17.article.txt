I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE storm
of moral outrage resulting from the
unmasking of the Milli Vanilli fraud.
The way I see it, people were probably
just pissed and embarrassed that they
hadn't noticed before.
In essence, all the Milli Vanilli fans
were getting was exactly what they want
ed and paid for: two good-looking guys
dancing around to some music they liked.
Alright, on some level they were
defrauding the public. But no more so
than anyone else. Have you never been to
a rock concert where some of the back
grounds or even vocals were clearly pre
recorded? I have witnessed great solos
from instruments that weren't even on
the stage.
Granted, any awards presented to
Milli Vanilli for singing probably should
have been revoked, or at least presented
to the people who actually did the vocals.
However, it seems many people have
forgotten that these two pretty boys were
just one of thousands of examples of the
deceit and fraud with which, and by
which, we live every day. This is definite
ly not a uniquely rock-'n'-roll phe
nomenon.
Ever been to a meeting of the House or
Senate in Washington, D.C.? There's a
good chance that most of the speeches
you hear are simply verbatim (unless the
congresspersons have a reading problem)
recitations of work written by unpaid

summer interns or staff workers. Don't
criticize the congresspersons for their
reading errors — it's probably only the
second or third time they've looked at the
thing.
Did you ever see a Reagan press con
ference? Remember how the questions
were rehearsed and he had the answers
beforehand? What's the difference here
between Ronnie and Milli?
They're both saying something that is
actually someone else's material. Both
would probably not be able to produce it
on their own if given the chance. And yet,
I witnessed far less outrage over those
staged press conferences than over the
revelation that our precious Vanilli boys
were putting us on.
Or what about Martin Luther King? It
now seems fairly well known that he pla
giarized parts of his paper. Most people
would say that although this is
deplorable conduct, we should not let it
taint our view of him as a leader.
So is it irrelevant that he made it look
as if something he was saying or thinking
— just like the Vanilli boys — was his
own when in fact it was someone else's?
I would probably agree it does not
detract from his leadership. But I never
thought there was anything so wrong
with the whole Milli Vanilli thing, either.
I once worked for a very high-ranking
state official whose "official" signature
was actually written by the administra

tive assistant. Every "official" document
that went out of the office with the "offi
cial" signature was only guaranteed to
have been seen by the administrative
assistant (and even then only glanced
over). Sure, in some instances the real
person saw it. But not in most.
The same is true for most press releas
es that go out of government offices. Or,
perhaps closer to home, for those letters
from your congressperson's office about
the requests you made or the opinions
you expressed.
Most likely, unless you and 35,000
other people voice the same opinion or
request, the congressperson never knows
you exist. That's what the huge congres
sional staff and budget are for. Hut at
least we're getting what we want, and
what we pay for (just like the Milli Vanil
li fans).
Because as individuals we have little
control over our political leaders, we do
not seem to care much about, or voice
outrage over, their deceit. But when that
fraud hits MTV, you damn well better
watch out!
