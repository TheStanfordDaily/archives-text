# For some Cal students, fire hit home — literally
##

As the remains of Sunday's fire smoldered in the
Oakland and Berkeley hills, the communities of UC-
Berkeley and Mills College struggled yesterday to
cope with the widespread devastation.
The fire, fueled by high winds and dry brush,
caused an estimated $1.5 billion in damage and
destroyed 600 buildings.
None of Berkeley's official campus housing was
damaged by the fire, but an apartment complex,
Park Woods, was burned to the ground. About 300
Berkeley students lived in the complex.
"I smelled smoke at about 11, but I didn't think it
was a big deal," said Jill Shirley, a Berkeley junior
who lived in Park Woods. "But then all of a sudden,
I could see flames right next to my apartment, and
the air was black."
Her apartment was "completely leveled," she
said. "We lost everything. We're sort of in shock,"
she said. "I keep asking myself, 'How am I going to
replace everything?' "
About 2,000 students evacuated from campus res
idences on Sunday. They were free to return to their
housing by 2 p.m. yesterday, once the fire was con
tained in the Berkeley area.
All the university's facilities located in the Berke
ley Hills, including the Lawrence Hall of Science,
were also evacuated.
Classes, which were canceled yesterday, are meet
ing today.
Nearby Mills College in Oakland was not evacuat
ed, since the fire was relatively far from the campus.
But according to Mills spokesperson Vickie Bates,
a lot of Mills faculty and staff lived in the Oakland
Hills. "I know of least four people whose homes have
burned to the ground," she said. "And many are
evacuated and don't know if their homes survived."
Classes at Mills, a women's college, were canceled
yesterday and today because "the faculty is too involved
in saving homes and lives to teach," Bates said.
The faculty, staff and administration at Berkeley
have also experienced "a lot of trauma," according to
Patricia Mcßroom, a public information representa
tive for the university.
Mcßroom, a resident of Oakland's Montclair Dis
trict, was evacuated Sunday afternoon. "It was very
difficult to decide what to take," she said. "I could
only take what I could fit into my car. ..."
Yesterday afternoon, she found out that her
house had survived the fire, and that her house
mates were going out to buy propane and candles so
that they could return home despite the power out
age. "It was a tremendous relief," she said.
