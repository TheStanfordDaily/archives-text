## Spikers achieve true apotheosis 
### 
Surely, they have
passed through the
underworld, met the
unspeakable terrors and chal
lenges that awaited them there,
and transcended the mere mor
tal to achieve apotheosis.
Maybe that's a slight over
statement, but for someone
who has been reading too much

Joseph Campbell lately and
who has watched closely the
progress of Stanford's women's
volleyball team for four years,
that's exactly what came to my
mind with the news of the Car
dinal's four-game defeat of the
UCLA Bruins in Wooden Cen
ter.
Man, did that make my
weekend.
You see, I've been a fan of
the team for a long time. I had
not been exposed very much at
all to the sport of volleyball
until I went to a women's
match against USC as a pro
fro. Ever since then I have been
a fan, not only of Stanford vol
leyball, but of the sport itself.
My freshman year, the
women were ranked No. 2 all
year and had only two regular
season losses — both to the
Bruins, who (not surprisingly)
were ranked No. 1 and were
undefeated.
However, my enthusiasm
for Cardinal volleyball
was not dampened, and
that spring I got the job of man
ager of the women's team. I
started my duties the following
fall. Everyone had high expec
tations for the team that sea
son, many predicting a champi
onship.
But the expectations placed
upon a young team that had
lost its starting setter to injury
resulted in a disappointing 18-
12 season.
UCLA beat us both times
that year.
And last year the Cardinal
was riding high, back to
where it belonged in the
elite of college volleyball. But
once again, UCLA foiled Stan
ford — three times, the last
time in the West Regional
championship.
Okay, so now we arrive at
1991, what many regarded as
the Promised Season. Shaw
would have maybe his best
team ever, and we would final
ly, finally, after so many sec
onds and thirds and fourths, be
crowned as the best in the land.
Of course, the key step in
achieving the dream would be

beating UCLA. That would
have to happen before we could
even think about taking the
title.
So at the end of last year, I
looked at us, and I looked at
UCLA. At first I thought that,
indeed, the Promised Season
would arrive. For, although the
Bruins returned most of their
best players, they lost their set
ter, perhaps the most impor
tant position on the team.
Then 1 found out that the
starting setter for the U.S.
National Team had decided to
go back to school and still had
eligibility and just happened to
decide to go to (where else?)
UCLA.
I hate to admit it, but at that
point I began to lose hope.
What I was thinking was
this: even though Stan
ford had possibly its
best team ever, UCLA had what
looked like, on paper, maybe the
best collegiate team ever. It was
not very encouraging.
But this season I regained
hope. The Bruins lost, I heard.
We were No. 1 and undefeated.
Jennifer Jackson was reaching
her potential. The team was
coming together and playing
with unprecedented chemistry
and confidence.
But still I looked at that
UCLA match on the schedule
and felt both fear and excite
ment. We had never beaten
them while I (or any of the play
ers) was a student here. And yet
last year we were so close. This
year we were rolling and the
Bruins had faltered. Surely it
was time: the inevitable Toyn
beean cycle would triumph.
It would be no easy feat,
surely. After so many disap
pointing losses to the Bruins,
even the most confident players
must have heard the ghosts
knocking on the doors of defeat
in the backs of their minds.
This Stanford team had to go
down there in hostile environs
and prove themselves, once and
for all. They had to overcome
their nemesis on the other side
of the net, but more important
ly, they had to overcome the
nemesis inside their thoughts.
And they.did it. They ban
ished the ghosts. Convincingly.
In the enemy's own lair.
Now the challenge is to press
on, never relent, and never look
back. This could very well be
the Promised Season. But it
won't be unless we seize it for
ourselves with our own sweat
and determination.
Congratulations to all my
friends on the team and coach
ing staff. It ain't over yet, but at
this point I've got one word that
summarizes how I and every
one of your fans feel right now.
Word.

Tyson Vaughan's theory is that
the revenge factor will play a
big part in the Saints' upcom
ing thrashing of Da Bears.

was riding high, back to
where it belonged in the
elite of college volleyball. But
once again, UCLA foiled Stan
ford — three times, the last
time in the West Regional
championship.
Okay, so now we arrive at
1991, what many regarded as
the Promised Season. Shaw
would have maybe his best
team ever, and we would final
ly, finally, after so many sec
onds and thirds and fourths, be
crowned as the best in the land.
Of course, the key step in
achieving the dream would be

beating UCLA. That would
have to happen before we could
even think about taking the
title.
So at the end of last year, I
looked at us, and I looked at
UCLA. At first I thought that,
indeed, the Promised Season
would arrive. For, although the
Bruins returned most of their
best players, they lost their set
ter, perhaps the most impor
tant position on the team.
Then 1 found out that the
starting setter for the U.S.
National Team had decided to
go back to school and still had
eligibility and just happened to
decide to go to (where else?)
UCLA.
I hate to admit it, but at that
point I began to lose hope.
What I was thinking was
this: even though Stan
ford had possibly its
best team ever, UCLA had what
looked like, on paper, maybe the
best collegiate team ever. It was
not very encouraging.
But this season I regained
hope. The Bruins lost, I heard.
We were No. 1 and undefeated.
Jennifer Jackson was reaching
her potential. The team was
coming together and playing
with unprecedented chemistry
and confidence.
But still I looked at that
UCLA match on the schedule
and felt both fear and excite
ment. We had never beaten
them while I (or any of the play
ers) was a student here. And yet
last year we were so close. This
year we were rolling and the
Bruins had faltered. Surely it
was time: the inevitable Toyn
beean cycle would triumph.
It would be no easy feat,
surely. After so many disap
pointing losses to the Bruins,
even the most confident players
must have heard the ghosts
knocking on the doors of defeat
in the backs of their minds.
This Stanford team had to go
down there in hostile environs
and prove themselves, once and
for all. They had to overcome
their nemesis on the other side
of the net, but more important
ly, they had to overcome the
nemesis inside their thoughts.
And they.did it. They ban
ished the ghosts. Convincingly.
In the enemy's own lair.
Now the challenge is to press
on, never relent, and never look
back. This could very well be
the Promised Season. But it
won't be unless we seize it for
ourselves with our own sweat
and determination.
Congratulations to all my
friends on the team and coach
ing staff. It ain't over yet, but at
this point I've got one word that
summarizes how I and every
one of your fans feel right now.
Word.

Tyson Vaughan's theory is that
the revenge factor will play a
big part in the Saints' upcom
ing thrashing of Da Bears.
