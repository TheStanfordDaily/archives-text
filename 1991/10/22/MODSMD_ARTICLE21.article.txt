ing up on a club team that, despite its club status,
nonetheless merited the admiration of Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan.

ing to be recognized as a varsity sport by the school,
and asked us for this game to help them out."

four different players scored the Stanford goals.
Sarah Rafanelli opened the scoring on an unassist
ed goal.

er, put Stanford up by three and later assisted on
