# Men shoot for win
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It is both insignificant and
extremely important. Sandwiched
between contests against No. 1
Santa Clara and defending
national champion UCLA, today's
men's soccer matchup against
San Jose State appears almost as
an oversight on the Stanford
men's soccer schedule.
Fresh from Friday night's
highly emotional 1-1 tie against
Santa Clara, Stanford (8-2-4)
takes on a younger, inexperienced
Spartan team on Maloney Field at
3 p.m. Needless to say, the Cardi
nal coaching staff is worried about
the matchup.
"You take a look at our sched
ule .. . and you say, 'Oh ,we have
to play San Jose State,'" said Car
dinal asst. coach Greg Petersen.
"But we've got to worry about
them. At this stage in the season,
we can't afford mental lapses."
Indeed, with the NCAA Tour
nament selections coming out in a
few weeks, today's contest places
Stanford in a must-win situation.
After today's match, the Cardinal,

currently seventh in the West,
faces UCLA, San Diego State and
the University of San Francisco in
a span of eight days. These three
powers are currently ranked sec
ond, fifth and third in the West,
respectively. Stanford desperately
needs victories against its
unranked foes to stay in the post
season hunt.
On paper, San Jose State (5-8-0)
is outclassed by the Cardinal. The
Spartans are in the midst of a huge
rebuilding program, consistently
fielding a starting lineup which
includes six to eight freshmen.
"We're still a year or two away,"
said Spartans coach Bob St. Claire.
"Quite honestly, we don't match
up real well against Stanford. They
are one of the better teams that
we'll face all year â€” a very physical
and very mature team."
Quietly, however, San Jose
State has carved its own niche in
the West, chalking up upsets
against both Cal State-Fullerton
and California this year. "They've
surprised a few teams already
this year," said Petersen. "I just
don't want them to surprise us."
