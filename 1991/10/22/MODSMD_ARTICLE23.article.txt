# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Beating the odds — that's what Stan
ford did this weekend in Los Angeles. Led
by three-time All-American Kristin Klein,
the women's volleyball team swept USC
and UCLA — a feat which they have not
accomplished since 1985. Meanwhile,
Chris Walsh's two touchdowns ensured
the Cardinal football team's first victory
over USC in 16 years. For their momen
tous efforts, Klein and Walsh have been

named Athletes of the Week.
Klein tied her season-high mark of 26
kills in the Cardinal's four-game romp. With
only two errors, Klein's hitting percentage
was a whopping .444.
After defeating the No. 9 Trojans, 15-4, 8-
15, 17-16, 15-9, the women headed over to
Westwood to take on the Bruins, who had a
home winning streak of 51 consecutive
matches.
However, this did not daunt Klein. She
had 21 kills and only one error for the
evening. She also tied for most digs with Bev
Oden at 15. The Cardinal's second four
game victory of the weekend, 15-11, 14-16,
15-10, 15-9, ensured their No. 1 ranking for
yet another week.
With this weekend's performance, Klein
is at the top of the Pacific 10 Conference for
hitting percentage, kills and digs. She is also
Stanford's all-time dig leader with 1281.
Coach Don Shaw summed up her play
saying simply, "Kristin Klein had a career
weekend."

Walsh was like a magnet, catching
everything in sight Saturday afternoon.
His 71-yard touchdown was only the
beginning of the 174 total yards he tallied
up on nine receptions. His second touch
down put Stanford ahead 24-21 with less
than two minutes left in the game against
USC.
"He had been playing great all day. He
beat [the defender] to the corner, and I
just laid the ball in and let him run it

down," said quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
Stenstrom wasn't the only one
impressed with Walsh's play. Coach Denny
Green noted, "Chris Walsh is leading the
conference in receptions, and we need to
start thinking about him like we think
about a lot of other great players.
"He is really playing well. He is leading
the league and he has earned it — he's a
gutty guy."
