### Larry Liu 
The No. 10 Stanford men's
golf team capped off a rather busy
weekend with a well-run tourna
ment and a convincing win. While
head coach Wally Goodwin and
the JV team hosted the Stanford
Cardinal Invitational, the varsity
team travelled to USC and won
their dual match 16-11.
The team of Notah Begay and
Casey Martin picked up 1.5
points. At the meet's end, Stan
ford defeated USC by a score of
16-11.
"The last time dual matches
were prevalent was in 1973, and
we're trying to get back to that,"
Goodwin said. "The team is able
to interact with the (opposing
team's) players more, which
makes Iplayingla lot more enjoy
able."
The Cardinal victory also illus
trates what is probably the team's
best asset, their great depth. Only
one of the starters, Christian

Cevaer, will be graduating this
year.
According to Goodwin, "Only
when you become a deep team
will you be able to get ahead in
rankings." Twenty-four schools
came from as far away as Texas
and Canada to participate in the
Invitational.
Colorado came out on top at
the tournament's end with a
cumulative score of 863, with
Pepperdine and California taking
second and third. Pepperdine's
Lars Heme took the individual
title with a 210, a three-under
par effort.
The junior varsity team com
peted in place of absent starters
at the Invitational. Led by fresh
man Jerry Chang's 224, the JV
squad placed a respectable 18th
overall.
With three successful tourna
ments under its belt, Stanford
looks to be a legitimate contender
for the NCAA Championships
this spring.
