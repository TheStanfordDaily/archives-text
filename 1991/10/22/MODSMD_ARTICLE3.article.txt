# Asbestos removal helped speed Delt house fire, officials say
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Actions taken by Stanford in prepara
tion for the demolition of the Delta Tau
Delta house may have inadvertently con
tributed to the house's fiery destruction,
according to local fire officials.
As part of their demolition process,
Stanford removed all fire-retardant
material, such as asbestos, from the
house to prevent injuries the materials

can cause to workers during demolition.
According to Palo Alto fire inspector
Gary Dufresne, however, the absence of
these materials allowed the fire to spread
quickly, engulfing the Delt house in min
utes.
"Basically it's a very old building,
which had incredibly intense heat," said
Dufresne. He said that when the fire
retardant materials were extracted from
the building, "you just set the building up
to burn."

In addition, the water service to the
house had been severed, preventing
sprinkler systems from helping control
the fire. John Hackmann, the attorney
for the Committee for the Preservation of
Historic Stanford (CPHS), said fire offi
cials had told him the Delt house fire
could have been controlled if the sprin
klers in the house had not been discon
nected by the University as part of their
demolition plans.
Dufresne said the University has

restored sprinkler and alarm services to
the nearby Synergy house, which was
also scheduled to be demolished.
Meanwhile, officials say they are com
ing to a standstill in the investigation of
the "suspicious fire of undetermined ori
gin." And while investigators say they
believe arson caused the fire, Stanford
police Sgt. Rick Tipton said there are few
leads as to who the perpetrators are.
"The possibility of seeking criminal
charges against any one suspect at this

time is slim," he said. "It looks like it's
pretty much wrapped up."
"It's been put in a resting position
pending further evidence," Dufresne
added. "We have nothing right now." He
said, however, that the case will be
reviewed once a year under California
penal code regulations to see if any new
evidence has surfaced.
Tipton said the lack of any suspect was
due to the almost-total destruc
tion at the building site, which
ruined most evidence about the
fire. In addition, Dufresne said
"there's no motive for the fire.
Nobody stands to gain."
He added that with the
expense of the investigation,
including a 24-hour guard, the
fire will end up costing the Uni
versity money.
Hackmann said the University's

decision to restore sprinkler service
to Synergy house may be too little,
too late. "It's like closing the barn
door after the horses are gone,"
Hackmann said. "But maybe it will
save the other horses."
In addition, Hackmann said,
the CPHS is offering a $1,000
reward for "information leading
to the arrest and conviction" of
the party responsible for causing
the fire.
Hackmann also said the group
has offered to pay for the removal
of underbrush from surrounding
houses in an effort to prevent any
future fires.
