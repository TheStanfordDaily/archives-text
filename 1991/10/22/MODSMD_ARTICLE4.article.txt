# Stanford group sees Soviet life post-coup
## Many areas have seen little change 
### Sandi Yeh 
Outside the Russian parlia
ment building, where protests had
taken place only weeks before,
graduate student Thomas Hodge
noticed a small wooden stake in
front of the 30-foot barricade.
Attached to the stake was a
flimsy piece of paper on which
someone had scribbled in pencil,
"Friends, soon on this spot there
will be a memorial raised to com
memorate our actions."
Hodge said he felt this "simple,
humane, and sincere" sign was
"more moving than any of the
large, official monuments."
The faculty adviser for the
Stanford-Soviet Exchange Pro
ject, Hodge had been to Moscow
several times before. But he said
this trip, less than a month after
the failed coup attempt, was the
most memorable.
The Project, a student-run
organization that has been in
operation for five years, spent the
weeks following the Soviet coup

and democratic revolution in
Novosibirsk, a town in central
Siberia, as the guests of Novosi
birsk State University students.
They also toured St. Petersburg,
formerly Leningrad, and Moscow.
The Stanford group quickly
made friends among the Russian
people. "I met many people I care
very much about," said Sean Ben
nett, a member of the project.
The visitors said they were
treated "like kings" by the Rus
sian people, who were extremely
eager to show the Americans a
good time. Aware of food short
ages, many students were sur
prised when the Russians lav
ished them with plates of deli
cious foods and glasses of vodka.
Some students felt guilty for
receiving such special treatment.
Paul Namphy said he felt divided.
I was "treated well myself but saw
my (Russian) friends treated shab
bily."
According to Ross Shell, "Our
Russian friends were going to
great extremes to keep us from
the daily difficulties and frustra
tions experienced by most Rus
sian citizens," noting that they
traveled in a private, half-empty
bus while the public buses were
almost always filled
Students met professors and
deans at the Novosibirsk campus.
Their itinerary included visits
to the Russian Pepsi Cola factory
and a world-renowned eye clinic.
Chad Walters observed that
the local people had heard so
much about improvement with
out seeing "real progress [that]
they were either apathetic or
weren't too hopeful."
Tracy Wright was "impressed
that the Russians made do with
what they had. In Siberia, many
families grew vegetables on their

own little plot of land, collected
wild mushrooms in the forest and
caught fish."
Participants said they were
struck by the dramatic difference
between the Russian and Ameri
can standards of living.
Food, gasoline and hot water
were scarce. Shell said he once
counted about 50 cars waiting for
fuel at 1 a.m.
"Our Russian friends had
become numb to such frustra
tions (which is] an important rea
son why such living standards
have been tolerated, ignored or
denied," said Namphy. "Many
people seemed to have no purpose
or motivation in life."
But among parts of the popula
tion, there was hope and enthusi
asm.
Hodge said when he arrived, he
watched the animated faces of his
Muscovite friends and listened to
them discuss the failed coup. "I
felt proud that my friends, who
are literary historians and critics,

went to build the barricades
around the Russian parliament
buildings."
One of Hodge's friends took
him around the buildings and
showed him the "huge tangle" of
barricades, built to protect Rus
sian president Boris Yeltsin from
advancing Soviet tanks.
The friend showed him how far
the tanks rolled in.
As they walked, Hodge's friend
told him about three Russians
who were crushed to death by the
tanks three days after the coup
attempt began. Hodge said his
friend did not show him the spot
where the men were killed
because the experience had been
so painful.
When Hodge went to the site
with another friend the next day,
he was "deeply, deeply moved."
Fresh flowers, candles and por
traits of the victims were placed
on the area where the men were
killed. A crowd had gathered, and
many were weeping.
