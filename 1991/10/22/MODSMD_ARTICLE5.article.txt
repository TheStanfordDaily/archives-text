# Escondido kids learn English through play

### Sean Etigson Staff writer 
Learning English as a sec
ond language can drain the
vital energy from most four,
five and six-year-olds, but at
Stanford's Pepper Tree
School-Age Program, parents,
teachers and students work
through this exhausting trial
together.
Student Natalie Keller, a
native of Mexico whose family
is French, said in Spanish,
"It's going really slowly, but
I'm getting better. I can name
two states."
Pepper Tree is run by Escon
dido Children's Center and
teaches 44 children from pre
school through second grade.
Its young students hail from
countries all over the world —
primarily Korea, Taiwan, Mexi
co, Norway and Israel.
According to Penelope Har
ris, director of the program,
"Many parents are concerned
about their children learning
English in the context of their

everyday activities."
"They're looking for a program
that has a low enough student
teacher ratio to give children that
opportunity."
From cooking club to science
projects to story time, coordina
tors said the staff strives to con
nect ideas with actions. Program
Assistant Jackie Dumont said,
"You have to use gestures and
facial expressions and show the
kids what you're talking about."
"Children are such sponges,
you know?" said Natalie's moth
er, Brigette Keller. "And they
don't need to be soaking up only
workbooks."
According to Harris, the pro
gram — which is offered during
the day for pre-schoolers and
after school for first and second
graders — offers the one-on-one
interaction the children need to
succeed in learning English.
Escondido Elementary School
runs a special instruction period
four days a week for non-native
English speakers. But Escondido

parent Ann-Helen Bay said chil
dren pulled out of the classroom
for this training miss other learn
ing opportunities, so the Pepper
Tree after-school program is
preferable.
"I worry that the class takes
[my son Mats] away from his
friends and what he learns from
them," she said.
According to teacher and coor
dinator Shawnie Parks, the pro
gram's focus embraces the idea of
investigating new worlds. "The
format is designed to allow chil
dren the opportunity to pick and
choose from a wide variety of
activities," she said.
Parks said this free-choice,
hands-on approach is a motivator
for the children.
Both Keller and Bay said
inquiry and discovery play a vital
role in learning to speak and write
English. The children learn not to
fear asking what a word means,
parents said.
Moving English from the text
book is essential, parents and
coordinators agreed.
On a tire-swing, rolling fresh off
the tongue of a 5-year-old crying
"Swing me! Swing me!" it becomes
a part of the children's lives.
