# Underage sex case: No plea bargain
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
A Superior Court review
of the case of junior Stuart
Thomas yielded no plea bar
gain yesterday.
Thomas is charged with
unlawful sexual intercourse
with a minor and providing
alcohol to a minor in connec
tion with an alleged Sept. 22
sexual assault in Stern Hall.
According to Thomas'
lawyer Melvin de la Motte,
Thomas plans to enter a plea
of not guilty in Palo Alto
Municipal Court tomorrow
afternoon. A date for a pre
liminary hearing to deter
mine whether the evidence
is sufficient to warrant a
trial will be set at that time.
Yesterday's meeting, a
routine step in criminal
cases, potentially offered an
opportunity to settle the
case without a trial, since
participants could informal
ly discuss the case or plea
bargain.
"We're going to have to
continue" the case, said
Margo Smith, supervising
deputy district attorney for
Palo Alto. Smith met yester
day with de la Motte and
Superior Court Judge Mary
Jo Levinger.
