Eye drug benefits AIDS victims
WASHINGTON (AP) - A new drug for a
sight-threatening eye infection in AIDS patients
also helps many of these patients fight their
underlying disease and live longer, government
and university scientists said yesterday.
Researchers said they are not certain why
the drug, foscarnet, improves survival of AIDS
patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis. But
they said it is possible the drug interacts with
anti-viral treatments to fight more effectively
the virus that causes AIDS.
