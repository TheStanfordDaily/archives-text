# University drops $43 million bombshell
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Aiming to save Stanford from chronic
budget shortfalls, the University's top
administrators yesterday announced sweep
ing budget-reduction decisions that will
affect almost every aspect of Stanford life.
University President Donald Kennedy
and Provost James Rosse called for "more
focus, selectivity and excellence" in a 12-
page statement, supported by a unanimous
recommendation of the University Cabi
net, that culminated months of self-study
by the University.

The statement included decisions on a
number of "central initiatives" that encom
pass everything from earthquake repairs
and overseas campuses to financial aid-and
undergraduate admissions. Administrators
expect the initiatives to bring them $16 mil
lion closer to a balanced budget.
They also announced budget-reduction
targets for the University's schools and
administrative areas, setting the stage for
three months of decision-making during
which the University plans to find the
other $27 million. (See separate story.)
Rosse and Kennedy wrote that the
changes are "designed to move Stanford

beyond the watershed of recent problems
to a new terrain of continued leadership in
higher education.
"The outcome will be a renewed, better
Stanford that has responded to a changing
environment for higher education that
demands more focus, selectivity and excel
lence in the activities of all universities,"
the statement said.
Construction canceled
The University will save about $3.8 mil
lion by deferring, canceling and scaling
back campus building projects, according
to yesterday's statement.
Renovation of the smaller earthquake
damaged buildings in the Quad may be
deferred indefinitely, Rosse said.
Plans for Near West Campus, already
scaled back, will be diminished even further,
he added. Hanna House and the Art Gallery
will not be repaired in the near future.
By canceling these projects, the Univer
sity will avoid new debt to finance the pro
jects and will limit increases to operations
and maintenance costs.
Rosse said Memorial Church will be reno
vated as scheduled. Repair of Green Library
has been made a priority by the Cabinet and
will also be completed soon, he said.
Student housing projects, which are
funded outside the operating budget, will
be completed as scheduled.

cent reduction of student grants.
Budget Director Tim Warner
said the president and provost
will propose to the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid a number of
changes in the needs-analysis for
mula, which determines the
amount of aid a student receives.
One proposal mentioned in
yesterday's statement is that the
income of the non-custodial par
ent be included in the determina
tion of financial need where a stu
dent's parents are divorced or
separated.
Any such changes would be
phased in over time.
Yesterday's announcement
also confirmed that the Universi
ty's policy of need-blind admis
sion will be preserved.
Room, board and tuition
The University will channel
money into the operating budget
by changing the balance of tuition
and room-and-board charges.
Room-and-board charges cur
rently go to Housing and Food
Services, an auxiliary budget,
while tuition revenues flow into
the operating budget.
The University has asked
Housing and Food Services to cut
$2.67 million, about 10 percent of
its operating budget.
The reduction targets include
cuts of approximately 15 percent in
the combined budget of Residential
Education and graduate housing.
Increasing tuition by an
amount similar to the cuts in the
room-and-board charge will allow
the University to transfer approx
imately $4 million to the operat
ing budget, according to yester
day's statement.
The increase in the overall cost
of attending Stanford will be held
to one percent above the rate of
inflation. This increase will gener
ate approximately $1-2 million in
new revenue, according to the
statement.
Stanford's tuition increase last
year was its smallest in more than
20 years, removing Stanford from a

list of the 10 highest-tuition schools.
New approach to gifts, grants
Most gifts to the University, as
well as many research grants, are
in the form of restricted funds,
which must be used as directed by
the donor.
The gifts can be a mixed bless
ing for the University, which
must use operating funds to cover
the indirect costs and administra
tive overhead associated with car
rying out the project.
Yesterday's announcement
said the University will try to
make restricted funds pay their
own way by assessing on them a
charge that reflects the cost they
impose on the University.
Because the charge cannot be
applied to past gifts, it will yield
income slowly. Rosse said the
charge "probably won't produce
more than $3 million"in the near
future.
Cornell University and several
other schools already charge such
a "tax" on expenditures from
restricted income.
More constant enrollment
The cabinet committee reject
ed increasing the size of Stan
ford's undergraduate student
body, according to yesterday's
statement. However, the Univer
sity will investigate ways of mak
ing student enrollment more uni
form across academic quarters.
Currently, more students
enroll for fall quarter than for
winter and spring. The disparity
is caused largely by students who
stop out during the year and by
fifth-year seniors.
"We have a peak enrollment in
fall quarter and we have to size
the institution to fit it," Rosse
said. "We're then below full
capacity in winter and spring."
To fix the imbalance, Rosse
said, the University will consider
admitting transfer students in
winter and spring, rather than
only for fall quarter.
Assoc. Admissions Dean
William Tingley said the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions will
also consider the possibility of
offering deferred admission to
freshmen who aren't accepted for
fall quarter.

"Certainly there are some very
strong freshman applicants
whom we turn down each year,
who might be interested in com
ing mid-year," he said.
The statement estimates more
uniform enrollment could achieve
deficit reductions of $500,000.
Overseas Studies
Overseas Studies will receive a
cut of approximately $400,000
from its $3.2 million budget.
Philosophy Prof. Michael Brat
man, chair of the Faculty Senate
task force that studied the impli
cations of various levels of cuts on
overseas studies, called the cut
"moderate."
"My sense is that it's a budget
of a magnitude such that they'll
have multiple options," he said.
Bratman said the target might be
achieved by closing a single large
campus or several smaller cam
puses, or by diminishing pro
grams in a more even way.
Public Service and SIW
The Haas Public Service Cen
ter and the Stanford-in-Washing
ton campus have been targeted
for a $100,000 budget reduction,
representing about 17 percent of

their general funds.
The University will continue to
push the Haas center toward
financial independence over the
next few years, according to yes
terday's statement. One-third of
the center's operating income
comes from its own endowment.
Changing higher education
Rosse maintains that Stanford
will emerge from the cuts a
stronger, more resilient institu
tion.
"I think we have a good shot at
holding in place the central fea
tures of what we've built over the
past two decades while we gather
our strengths to deal with the
issues of the '90s and the next
century," he said.
Citing the economic adversity
now facing colleges and universi
ties, Rosse said a leaner Stanford,
more in line with economic reali
ties and equipped to deal with eco
nomic uncertainty, will be a
model for other institutions.
"Higher education is going to
be different, and I think this insti
tution is finding the way to lead
higher education in the future
just as it led higher education in
the '60s and '705."

Public Service and SIW
The Haas Public Service Cen
ter and the Stanford-in-Washing
ton campus have been targeted
for a $100,000 budget reduction,
representing about 17 percent of

their general funds.
The University will continue to
push the Haas center toward
financial independence over the
next few years, according to yes
terday's statement. One-third of
the center's operating income
comes from its own endowment.
Changing higher education
Rosse maintains that Stanford
will emerge from the cuts a
stronger, more resilient institu
tion.
"I think we have a good shot at
holding in place the central fea
tures of what we've built over the
past two decades while we gather
our strengths to deal with the
issues of the '90s and the next
century," he said.
Citing the economic adversity
now facing colleges and universi
ties, Rosse said a leaner Stanford,
more in line with economic reali
ties and equipped to deal with eco
nomic uncertainty, will be a
model for other institutions.
"Higher education is going to
be different, and I think this insti
tution is finding the way to lead
higher education in the future
just as it led higher education in
the '60s and '705."
Aiming to save Stanford from chronic
budget shortfalls, the University's top
administrators yesterday announced sweep
ing budget-reduction decisions that will
affect almost every aspect of Stanford life.
University President Donald Kennedy
and Provost James Rosse called for "more
focus, selectivity and excellence" in a 12-
page statement, supported by a unanimous
recommendation of the University Cabi
net, that culminated months of self-study
by the University.

The statement included decisions on a
number of "central initiatives" that encom
pass everything from earthquake repairs
and overseas campuses to financial aid-and
undergraduate admissions. Administrators
expect the initiatives to bring them $16 mil
lion closer to a balanced budget.
They also announced budget-reduction
targets for the University's schools and
administrative areas, setting the stage for
three months of decision-making during
which the University plans to find the
other $27 million. (See separate story.)
Rosse and Kennedy wrote that the
changes are "designed to move Stanford

beyond the watershed of recent problems
to a new terrain of continued leadership in
higher education.
"The outcome will be a renewed, better
Stanford that has responded to a changing
environment for higher education that
demands more focus, selectivity and excel
lence in the activities of all universities,"
the statement said.
Construction canceled
The University will save about $3.8 mil
lion by deferring, canceling and scaling
back campus building projects, according
to yesterday's statement.
Renovation of the smaller earthquake
damaged buildings in the Quad may be
deferred indefinitely, Rosse said.
Plans for Near West Campus, already
scaled back, will be diminished even further,
he added. Hanna House and the Art Gallery
will not be repaired in the near future.
By canceling these projects, the Univer
sity will avoid new debt to finance the pro
jects and will limit increases to operations
and maintenance costs.
Rosse said Memorial Church will be reno
vated as scheduled. Repair of Green Library
has been made a priority by the Cabinet and
will also be completed soon, he said.
Student housing projects, which are
funded outside the operating budget, will
be completed as scheduled.

cent reduction of student grants.
Budget Director Tim Warner
said the president and provost
will propose to the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid a number of
changes in the needs-analysis for
mula, which determines the
amount of aid a student receives.
One proposal mentioned in
yesterday's statement is that the
income of the non-custodial par
ent be included in the determina
tion of financial need where a stu
dent's parents are divorced or
separated.
Any such changes would be
phased in over time.
Yesterday's announcement
also confirmed that the Universi
ty's policy of need-blind admis
sion will be preserved.
Room, board and tuition
The University will channel
money into the operating budget
by changing the balance of tuition
and room-and-board charges.
Room-and-board charges cur
rently go to Housing and Food
Services, an auxiliary budget,
while tuition revenues flow into
the operating budget.
The University has asked
Housing and Food Services to cut
$2.67 million, about 10 percent of
its operating budget.
The reduction targets include
cuts of approximately 15 percent in
the combined budget of Residential
Education and graduate housing.
Increasing tuition by an
amount similar to the cuts in the
room-and-board charge will allow
the University to transfer approx
imately $4 million to the operat
ing budget, according to yester
day's statement.
The increase in the overall cost
of attending Stanford will be held
to one percent above the rate of
inflation. This increase will gener
ate approximately $1-2 million in
new revenue, according to the
statement.
Stanford's tuition increase last
year was its smallest in more than
20 years, removing Stanford from a

list of the 10 highest-tuition schools.
New approach to gifts, grants
Most gifts to the University, as
well as many research grants, are
in the form of restricted funds,
which must be used as directed by
the donor.
The gifts can be a mixed bless
ing for the University, which
must use operating funds to cover
the indirect costs and administra
tive overhead associated with car
rying out the project.
Yesterday's announcement
said the University will try to
make restricted funds pay their
own way by assessing on them a
charge that reflects the cost they
impose on the University.
Because the charge cannot be
applied to past gifts, it will yield
income slowly. Rosse said the
charge "probably won't produce
more than $3 million"in the near
future.
Cornell University and several
other schools already charge such
a "tax" on expenditures from
restricted income.
More constant enrollment
The cabinet committee reject
ed increasing the size of Stan
ford's undergraduate student
body, according to yesterday's
statement. However, the Univer
sity will investigate ways of mak
ing student enrollment more uni
form across academic quarters.
Currently, more students
enroll for fall quarter than for
winter and spring. The disparity
is caused largely by students who
stop out during the year and by
fifth-year seniors.
"We have a peak enrollment in
fall quarter and we have to size
the institution to fit it," Rosse
said. "We're then below full
capacity in winter and spring."
To fix the imbalance, Rosse
said, the University will consider
admitting transfer students in
winter and spring, rather than
only for fall quarter.
Assoc. Admissions Dean
William Tingley said the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions will
also consider the possibility of
offering deferred admission to
freshmen who aren't accepted for
fall quarter.

"Certainly there are some very
strong freshman applicants
whom we turn down each year,
who might be interested in com
ing mid-year," he said.
The statement estimates more
uniform enrollment could achieve
deficit reductions of $500,000.
Overseas Studies
Overseas Studies will receive a
cut of approximately $400,000
from its $3.2 million budget.
Philosophy Prof. Michael Brat
man, chair of the Faculty Senate
task force that studied the impli
cations of various levels of cuts on
overseas studies, called the cut
"moderate."
"My sense is that it's a budget
of a magnitude such that they'll
have multiple options," he said.
Bratman said the target might be
achieved by closing a single large
campus or several smaller cam
puses, or by diminishing pro
grams in a more even way.
