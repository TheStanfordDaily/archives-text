# University drops $43 million bombshell
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Aiming to save Stanford from chronic
budget shortfalls, the University's top
administrators yesterday announced sweep
ing budget-reduction decisions that will
affect almost every aspect of Stanford life.
University President Donald Kennedy
and Provost James Rosse called for "more
focus, selectivity and excellence" in a 12-
page statement, supported by a unanimous
recommendation of the University Cabi
net, that culminated months of self-study
by the University.

The statement included decisions on a
number of "central initiatives" that encom
pass everything from earthquake repairs
and overseas campuses to financial aid-and
undergraduate admissions. Administrators
expect the initiatives to bring them $16 mil
lion closer to a balanced budget.
They also announced budget-reduction
targets for the University's schools and
administrative areas, setting the stage for
three months of decision-making during
which the University plans to find the
other $27 million. (See separate story.)
Rosse and Kennedy wrote that the
changes are "designed to move Stanford

beyond the watershed of recent problems
to a new terrain of continued leadership in
higher education.
"The outcome will be a renewed, better
Stanford that has responded to a changing
environment for higher education that
demands more focus, selectivity and excel
lence in the activities of all universities,"
the statement said.
Construction canceled
The University will save about $3.8 mil
lion by deferring, canceling and scaling
back campus building projects, according
to yesterday's statement.
Renovation of the smaller earthquake
damaged buildings in the Quad may be
deferred indefinitely, Rosse said.
Plans for Near West Campus, already
scaled back, will be diminished even further,
he added. Hanna House and the Art Gallery
will not be repaired in the near future.
By canceling these projects, the Univer
sity will avoid new debt to finance the pro
jects and will limit increases to operations
and maintenance costs.
Rosse said Memorial Church will be reno
vated as scheduled. Repair of Green Library
has been made a priority by the Cabinet and
will also be completed soon, he said.
Student housing projects, which are
funded outside the operating budget, will
be completed as scheduled.
Financial aid affected
Yesterday's statement proposes tighten
ing the rules that determine the size of
financial aid grants, resulting in a 10 per-
