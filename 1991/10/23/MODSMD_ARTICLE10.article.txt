## Ex-hostage Turner greeted in Germany 
### 
WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) â€” Hundreds of
Americans waving flags and banners yesterday
gave freed American hostage Jesse Turner a
tumultuous welcome to Germany.
The 44-year-old Turner, who was released
Monday after nearly five years in captivity in
Lebanon, shook hands with Air Force service
men and women and was given a bouquet of
flowers before going into the military hospital at
Wiesbaden.
Patients and military personnel crowded hos
pital balconies, waving and cheering as Turner,
a mathematics professor from Boise, Idaho,
went inside.
"He seems to be in generally good condition,"
U.S. Navy Cmdr. John Woodhouse said of
Turner.
Four Americans, two Germans, a Briton and
an Italian remain missing in Lebanon. The
hostage held the longest is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
