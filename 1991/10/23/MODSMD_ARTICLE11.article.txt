# Oakland fire avoidable, critics posit

### 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - The
death toll rose to 19 and the damage
estimate to $5 billion Tuesday in the
costliest fire in U.S. history, as ques
tions and criticism rose from the
ashes.
Did firefighters wait too long before
calling in outside help? Could the
deadly wildfire — blamed on a rekin
dled brush fire — have been avoided?
And why wasn't water available when
it was needed most?
"We can't have a situation where
people watch their house burn down,"
said Alameda County Supervisor
Warren Widener, who believes his
house might have been saved if fire
fighters hadn't run out of water as
pressure dropped.
Figures released Tuesday showed
Sunday's wildfire killed 19, destroyed
more than 1,800 houses and nearly
900 apartments, and damaged 200
more units, said Alameda County
Sheriff s Sgt. Robert Jarrett. He had

no details on where additional bodies
were found.
President Bush declared the fire a
major disaster, freeing federal aid for
recovery. Oakland, meanwhile, upgrad
ed the cost of the fire at "upwards of $5
billion," said Deborah Campbell, press
secretary for Mayor Elihu Harris.
Forty-nine people were reported
missing, 148 were injured and 5,000
evacuated, Jarrett said. Authorities
cautioned that some of the missing may
have been away at the time or had trou
ble contacting friends and relatives.
"Until there's a dwelling-to-dwelling
count nothing is sure," Jarrett said.
Firefighters were still dousing hot
spots and hoped to have the 1,700-acre
fire under control by noon Wednesday.
As the numbers were tallied,
homeowners began making the long,
heartbreaking trek to see if their
homes still stood. Some walked across
3 square miles of desolation and
smoking ruins.

"It's terrible from the air, it's terri
ble from the ground. It's grim both
ways," Gov. Pete Wilson said, stand
ing in front of the ruins of the 250-unit
Parkwood Apartments.
The wildfire started when a
Saturday brush fire re-ignited, some
thing critics say might not have hap
pened if firefighters had kept watch all
night.
"The first thing you're taught is
that you don't leave until a fire is very
thoroughly put out," said James
Royce, a former firefighter with the
National Park Service at Yosemite
National Park.
Oakland firefighters dismissed the
criticism as Monday morning quarter
backing.
Fire Chief Phillip Lamont Ewell,
who became chief this month, said
"normal operating procedure" was
followed in keeping firefighters on
the scene of Saturday's five-alarm
blaze in the hills above Oakland for

most, but not all, of the night.
High temperatures, stiff wind and
five years of drought that had turned
vegetation to kindling had created
"red flag" weather conditions.
Ewell said there were no flareups
overnight and when winds stoked
the old, blaze at about 11 a.m.
Sunday there was simply no stopping
it as it leapt and howled down the
hills above Oakland and Berkeley,
devouring the upscale neighbor
hoods lining the tucks and folds of
the slopes.
Outside agencies also asked why
Oakland didn't call for more help once
the fire sprang back to life.
"Everybody was waiting and watch
ing even to the point where the depart
ment senior staff were inquiring,
'Have they called us yet?'" said Capt.
Dave Moore of the San Jose Fire
Department, which was asked to send
special fire strike teams at about 3
p.m. Sunday.
