Singh, a wizened hill man, said he does
not know whether to worry about his
growling belly or focus on mourning the
death of loved ones.
"After seeing my grandchildren die
before my eyes, should I feel like living?
But this horrible hunger keeps telling
me that I am alive," said Singh, a 66-
year-old farmer.
Singh's three daughters-in-law, five
grandchildren and three children of his
brother died in the earthquake that con

vulsed the Himalayan foothills in Uttar
Pradesh state early Sunday.
By official count at least 665 people
died and 2,000 were injured.
A private physician, Sanjay Gupta of
the nearby town of Chamba, returned
from remote villages and said he feared
the final death toll would reach 2,000.
"I have seen 40 to 50 people dying in
many villages," Gupta said.
Yesterday, tens of thousands of
quake victims were without food or
warm clothing and were living in the

open.
"People have no food to eat.
Everything was buried with the near
and dear ones. After cremating their
dead, they are shivering in the cold,
sleeping under the sky," said
Padmadutt Khandoori, a relief worker,
who said he has toured at least a half
dozen villages.
"Medical facilities are no problem,
but people have no place to live,"
Khandoori said. He said he walked 60
miles of hilly paths the past three days

to reach villages.
Jitender Nath Ranjan, who is over
seeing government relief operations
from Dehra Dun, 34 miles from
Ganeshpur, said 10,000 houses were
flattened by the quake.
"I confess that financial help has not
reached the affected people," Ranjan
added, but he claimed military planes
and helicopters have air-dropped flour,
sugar, rice, milk powder, sweaters, blan
kets and tents.
Many roads were blocked yesterday

by landslides triggered by the quake, the
deadliest ever to hit this region close to
the frontier of Chinese-ruled Tibet.
"Today we have nothing, not a single
rupee, not a single morsel of food, no
utensils, nothing except these," said
Singh's younger brother, Abbal, point
ing at a pail and an Indian smoking pipe.
"What do we do now? Nobody is help
ing us. We don't have anywhere to go.
Please, why don't you arrange for some
food for us?" Abbal Singh asked visiting
journalists.
