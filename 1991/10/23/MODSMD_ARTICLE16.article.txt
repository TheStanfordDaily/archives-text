## Renegade roadsters 
### 
Careless biking around
campus is becoming
a rather costly affair

Blue and white lights
flash. Sirens wail. "Pull
over," the uniformed officer
commands.
The bike police have struck
again, and another puzzled, two
wheeled terror wonders what
hideous crime he has committed.
Drivers aren't the only ones
being pulled over on the Stanford
campus these days. Police are step
ping up their efforts to ticket rene
gade campus roadsters.
Bicyclists face the prospects of a
fine up to as much as $109 for fail
ing to stop at a stop sign or may
simply be required to show that
they have purchased a light or reg
istered their bikes. While the
penalty for moving violations is
unreasonably high, the increased
enforcement by Stanford Police is a
positive move.
"Don't the police have better
things to do?" some students are
asking. Certainly missing bike
lights should not be the police's
main priority. But cracking down
on unsafe biking is not a bad idea,
considering the number of injuries
every year in accidents.
Bike accidents are much more of
a direct threat to student health
than violent crimes the police
might work to prevent. There were
65 accidents reported to the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety
during the last school year, most of
which were serious enough to
involve emergency services like the
paramedics, the police and the fire
department.
And statistics from Cowell Stu
dent Health Center show most bik
ing mishaps aren't reported. Cow
ell treated 72 bike-accident victims
last year in spring quarter alone.
Combined with the fact that
most Stanford students shudder at
the thought of wearing a helmet or

other protective gear, the risk of
serious injury is very high.
Anyone who has been in White
Plaza at noon knows that some
riders seem to have no regard for
others. A few tickets wouldn't hurt
those people who zoom through
crowded areas, sideswipe pedestri
ans and assume other bikers will
get out of their way.
But a $109 ticket for ignoring a
stop sign is excessive. It may be dan
gerous if the street is crowded, but
when the intersection is clear most
bikers simply don't think to stop.
The fines used to be closer to
$30 but went up on Aug. 1 for both
cars and bicycles. Since it is so
much more dangerous for cars to
run stop signs than for bicycles,
the penalties should be significant
ly lower for bicyclists.
Fix-it tickets for mechanical vio
lations, such as missing lights, or
for failing to register bikes, are a
good idea. Despite University
attempts at safety education, few
students are motivated enough to
take care of these things without
being pushed just a little.
As unimportant as these things
may seem, they are enforced for a
reason. Visibility on campus after
dark is often very poor, and bike
lights are a basic precaution.
And registration could end up
benefitting the bike owner enor
mously, since police can't return
stolen bicycles they recover unless
they can locate the owner. With
400 to 500 bike thefts every year, a
gentle reminder to register bicy
cles doesn't hurt anyone.
But enforcement alone isn't
enough. If the police are going to
ticket the mobile campus masses,
they need to do a better job at pub
licizing the rules and possible con
sequences of breaking them.
The threat of a $109 fine will
certainly get more people to stop at
stop signs than less specific warn
ings. And bikers who threaten the
safety of others by riding in an
obviously dangerous way should
be targeted before those who roll
through an empty intersection
once in a while.
