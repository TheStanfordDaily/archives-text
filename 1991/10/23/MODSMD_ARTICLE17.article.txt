Undergraduate drinking is no joking matter

THE DAILY'S ORIENTATION
issue of Intermission (Sept. 19)
contained an article that succeeded
admirably in depressing and disgusting
me: "You can leave your Hefty bag on —
a guide to Stanford parties."
I was utterly stupefied and amazed at
the irresponsibility of The Daily in actu
ally publishing the article. In effect, it
basically said: "Freshman: You've made
it; you're in the big time — COLLEGE
— so now get out there and hit the keg,
and make a complete drunken ass of
yourself, 'cause THAT'S what it's all
about."

We'll overlook the state's law about
the legal age for consuming alcohol
(How many 21-year-old freshmen do
YOU know?) and ignore the University's
own alcohol policy.
Instead let's think about this: An
alleged rape that apparently involved
excessive alcohol consumption occurred
on campus last month. At the beginning
of last year, a student attending a party
in Berkeley drank himself beyond coher
ence and fell out a window to his death.
And not too long ago, another student
here at Stanford succeeded in killing
himself by alcohol poisoning — he sim-

ply drank too much.
The article employed a jocular tone,
but I'm afraid I had a really hard time
seeing the humor in the it. The conspira
torial, your-parents-aren't-here-so-you
can-get-away-with-it manner in which it
was written frankly turned my stomach.
The media bombards us with the
tragic consequences of alcohol abuse, but
who listens? Certainly not college stu
dents. They just drink for fun; they can
handle it; there's no WAY they could
ever become "alcoholic." But will some
one please explain to me why a party
always involves getting so sloshed you

can't see straight?
One of the saddest lines in that article
said, "Best of all, you will never have to
assume the lonely, sober role of desig
nated driver among your friends."
Great, apparently it's a punishment to
be sober or responsible.
I'm no modern-day Prohibitionist by
any means, but I strongly feel that pub
lishing such an article was irresponsible
and reflects a juvenile attitude about
drinking and "partying" that should be
discouraged rather than condoned.
