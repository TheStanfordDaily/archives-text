# Thomas letter showed lynch-mob mentality prevalent on campus
## 
### 
I write in response to Julie Madsen's
letter of Oct. 18, which advised the
fiancee of the young man who allegedly
raped a student recently to "avoid mak
ing the biggest mistake of your life." Just
who do you think you are, advising some
one you have never seen, spoken to or
heard from to break off an engagement?
No trial has occurred, so no facts are
publicly available, yet you condemn the
young man and tell his fiancee to leave
him. On what grounds? In our society
one is innocent until proven guilty, so
your sage advice is obviously based on
rumor and speculation, driven by your
view of yourself as some legal/sexual/mar
riage-counseling Ann Landers.
This young man's relationship with
his fiancee is no doubt intensely personal
and private, as are (for now) the facts
surrounding the allegations. I certainly
do not condone statutory rape. At the
same time, however, I cannot accept your
infringement of this young man's consti
tutionally-guaranteed right to a fair pro

cess regarding such a serious allegation.
You are not the only one guilty of this
lynch-mob mentality, merely the most
recent. Don't prejudge, and mind your
own business.
