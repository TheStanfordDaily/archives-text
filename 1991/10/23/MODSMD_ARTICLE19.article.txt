# Laws prohibiting gay marriage prevent equal access to health care
## 
### 
In his letter to The Daily concerning
Cowell Student Health Center's domes
tic-partner insurance benefits (Oct. 17),
Willy Inboden decries the policy as "a
moral travesty" because it impugns the
"sanctity of marriage."
I have another perspective on this
policy and on Inboden's views. Last
month, I got married. We had a beauti
ful ceremony in our backyard, with fami
ly and friends surrounding us. We
exchanged rings and vows and pro
nounced our intentions to share the rest
of our lives. It was, to quote Inboden, a
"publicly declared affirmation of a com
mitment to a life-long relationship."
It was not, however, legal. I wish it

were. I would gladly enter the maze of pub
lic record and community property. But
because the person I have chosen to spend
my life with is another woman, I cannot.
I work at Hewlett-Packard, which,
along with most other companies, does
not extend benefits to domestic partners.
My partner has a pre-existing condition
that prevents her from securing a compre
hensive health insurance policy on her
own. If she were to become ill, our savings
would be wiped out paying doctor and
hospital bills. After the savings were gone,
I guess she would end up on MediCal.
If Inboden is so unhomophobic as he
professes, why does he not champion the
right of gay people to marry legally? If it is
truly the sanctity of marriage that he
seeks to protect, why does he not assail
those heterosexuals who use the institu
tion of marriage to get tax benefits, secure
citizenship or increase their wealth?
Sure, there will be fraud. But there is
already. If it bothers him that much, he
should work on the infractions that are
already being committed and let the rest
of us look after our loved ones in peace.
I salute Cowell's attempt to right an
old wrong. May there be many, many
more to follow its example.
