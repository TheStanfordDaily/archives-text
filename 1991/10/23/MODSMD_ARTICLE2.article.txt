# Academics, administration to take big hits
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University unveiled a deficit-reduction
plan yesterday that will likely force staff and
faculty reductions and significant cuts in aca
demic choices and administrative services.
Academics will shoulder about a quarter of
the $43-million reduction, and some adminis
trative areas such as the General Counsel's
office — which handles the University's legal
affairs — face cuts close to 20 percent.
Administrators within the schools said yes
terday cuts will likely be necessary in faculty
and staff, and some departments may be sig
nificantly reduced or eliminated.
"This is a serious budgetary problem," said

Assoc. Dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness David Baron. "We are not going to be
doing business as usual."
Targets for the schools range between 7.1
and 8.8 percent. The School of Humanities
and Sciences must reduce its operating budget
by 7.4 percent, and the target for the School of
Engineering is 8.0 percent.
Hardest hit by the deficit reductions is the
School of Education, which received an 8.8-
percent target.
The cuts "aren't across-the-board," said
Provost James Rosse. "Each of our schools in its
own ways represents pinnacles of excellence."
Rosse explained that the target-percentages
were similar because of a rule he called the
"law of large numbers." It is necessary to look

"pretty hard" at programs to find things to cut,
and each school's vulnerable areas end up
amounting to similar-sized reduction targets.
Academic support areas generally were
assigned larger reduction targets. The Office
of the Dean of Research received an 11.1 per
cent target, and the University's contribution
to the Department of Athletics will be reduced
by 19.3 percent.
Despite urging from faculty to keep the target
for Libraries and Information Resources below 5
percent, acquisitions and services received a 7.5
percent target. The administrative and informa
tion services portion of the libraries received an
even larger target — 13.5 percent.
