# Academics, administration to take big hits
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University unveiled a deficit-reduction
plan yesterday that will likely force staff and
faculty reductions and significant cuts in aca
demic choices and administrative services.
Academics will shoulder about a quarter of
the $43-million reduction, and some adminis
trative areas such as the General Counsel's
office — which handles the University's legal
affairs — face cuts close to 20 percent.
Administrators within the schools said yes
terday cuts will likely be necessary in faculty
and staff, and some departments may be sig
nificantly reduced or eliminated.
"This is a serious budgetary problem," said

Assoc. Dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness David Baron. "We are not going to be
doing business as usual."
Targets for the schools range between 7.1
and 8.8 percent. The School of Humanities
and Sciences must reduce its operating budget
by 7.4 percent, and the target for the School of
Engineering is 8.0 percent.
Hardest hit by the deficit reductions is the
School of Education, which received an 8.8-
percent target.
The cuts "aren't across-the-board," said
Provost James Rosse. "Each of our schools in its
own ways represents pinnacles of excellence."
Rosse explained that the target-percentages
were similar because of a rule he called the
"law of large numbers." It is necessary to look

"pretty hard" at programs to find things to cut,
and each school's vulnerable areas end up
amounting to similar-sized reduction targets.
Academic support areas generally were
assigned larger reduction targets. The Office
of the Dean of Research received an 11.1 per
cent target, and the University's contribution
to the Department of Athletics will be reduced
by 19.3 percent.
Despite urging from faculty to keep the target
for Libraries and Information Resources below 5
percent, acquisitions and services received a 7.5
percent target. The administrative and informa
tion services portion of the libraries received an
even larger target — 13.5 percent.

Administrative areas also
received reduction targets signifi
cantly larger than the schools.
The General Counsel's office
, must reduce its operating budget
by 19.2 percent, and Student
Resources received a 12.6 percent
.target excluding Residential Edu
cation. (See main story.)
Vice-presidential areas that
received smaller targets recog
nized their good fortune yester
day.
I "We are very grateful," said
Elizabeth Sloan, director of com
munications for the Office of
Development, which received a
10.1 percent target. "We are not
unmindful that we are at the
, small end of the scale."
But regardless of the size of
their target, administrators rec
.ognized that major decisions will
have to be made for the Universi
ty to reduce its operating budget
Tby $43 million — or almost 12
percent.
Academic cuts 'unavoidable'
Although administrators with
in the schools emphasize they will
try to increase revenues, most
.admit that cuts are unavoidable
when trying to meet a reduction
target of about 8 percent.
; Humanities and sciences will
make "selective cuts," according
to Senior Assoc. Dean Carolyn
Lougee, who said some academic
areas may face large cuts or total
elimination.
Lougee said internal commit
tees have identified several
departments and programs as
candidates for substantial reduc
tions or closure: drama, Humani
ties Special Programs, photogra
phy, design, black performing
arts, music performing arts, Inno
vative Academic Courses and
urban studies.
The School of Earth Sciences is
considering merging "two or more
departments ... to save costs,"
according to a statement released
by Dean Gary Ernst.
Almost all the schools recog
nize that limits will have to be
placed on hiring new faculty, and

many predict that the number of
faculty positions will shrink over
time.
For instance, the School of
Engineering has declared a freeze
on faculty hiring, according to a
statement released today by Dean
James Gibbons and Senior Assoc.
Dean Charles Kruger.
The Law School's budget
reduction plan relies heavily on
"letting the faculty downsize
through normal attrition and

leaving positions unfilled," said
Dean Paul Brest.
Other schools considering a
smaller faculty include Humani
ties and Sciences, the School of
Education and the Business
School. The statement from earth
sciences did not discuss faculty
size.
Expenses unrelated to faculty
hiring will also be examined. For
instance, the School of Education
will look at "re-configuring cleri
cal and support staff and reducing
facilities support," said Anne
Gaddy, associate dean of adminis
tration.
Schools are also intensely
examining revenue-enhancement
proposals.
For instance, education, engi
neering and humanities and sci
ences are all considering increas
ing the number of students in

master's programs. These stu
dents pay full tuition and would
increase the revenue within the
specific school.
Both the Business and Law
Schools have rejected large
increases in enrollment.
"We are not going to change
the basic size of the Business
School," Baron said.
Brest said the physical size of
the Law School prohibits a large
increase in students and added

that the "intimate atmosphere" of
the school is "what distinguishes
it."
Engineering is considering a
"relatively small increase in grad
uate tuition," according to the
statement from Gibbons and
Kruger.
Several schools also plan to
increase their fund-raising
efforts. Gaddy said the School of
Education will begin a "planned
strategy for increasing annual
expendable gifts by a modest
amount."
Proposals for all the schools
are still in the planning stages, as
the deadline for budget-reduction
plans is not until Jan. 17.
Some form of input from stu
dents, faculty and staff will be
incorporated, but the exact deci
sion-making process is still under
discussion for most schools.

Programs and departments
that may be significantly
reduced or closed in
Humanities and Sciences:
Humanities Special
Programs, Innovative
Academic Courses,
Black Performing Arts,
music performing
arts, design, drama,
photography and
urban studies.

In humanities and sciences,
three faculty committees have
examined their main areas —
humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences.
The committees identified vul
nerable programs and reported
back to a central school commit
tee. Dean Ewart Thomas and
committee members have already
talked to "a lot of students" and
will continue to do so throughout
the budget process, Lougee said.
Administration hit harder
Vice-presidential areas have
only one real option to meet their
reduction targets — make cuts.
On the heels of the $22-million
reduction in administrative ser
vices known as "repositioning,"
vice presidents say their areas are
going to have to struggle to find
more.
"It ain't easy" to find more
cuts, said Ray Bacchetti, acting
vice president for planning and
management. "Repositioning did
a good job of making us a lot lean
er, but it did not do as good a job
of reducing the expectations.
"We really have to change the
way we do things around here,"
he added.
Vice President and General
Counsel John Schwartz warned
that things will definitely change.
"There will be a significant
reduction in services, and this will
be the same for every part of the
University," he said.

Repositioning forced the cancellation of morning consulting services at Meyer, but yesterday's cuts of
the University libraries will go much deeper. The acquisitions and services portion received a 7.5 per
cent target cut, while administrative and information services received a 13.5 percent target.
The University unveiled a deficit-reduction
plan yesterday that will likely force staff and
faculty reductions and significant cuts in aca
demic choices and administrative services.
Academics will shoulder about a quarter of
the $43-million reduction, and some adminis
trative areas such as the General Counsel's
office — which handles the University's legal
affairs — face cuts close to 20 percent.
Administrators within the schools said yes
terday cuts will likely be necessary in faculty
and staff, and some departments may be sig
nificantly reduced or eliminated.
"This is a serious budgetary problem," said

Assoc. Dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness David Baron. "We are not going to be
doing business as usual."
Targets for the schools range between 7.1
and 8.8 percent. The School of Humanities
and Sciences must reduce its operating budget
by 7.4 percent, and the target for the School of
Engineering is 8.0 percent.
Hardest hit by the deficit reductions is the
School of Education, which received an 8.8-
percent target.
The cuts "aren't across-the-board," said
Provost James Rosse. "Each of our schools in its
own ways represents pinnacles of excellence."
Rosse explained that the target-percentages
were similar because of a rule he called the
"law of large numbers." It is necessary to look

"pretty hard" at programs to find things to cut,
and each school's vulnerable areas end up
amounting to similar-sized reduction targets.
Academic support areas generally were
assigned larger reduction targets. The Office
of the Dean of Research received an 11.1 per
cent target, and the University's contribution
to the Department of Athletics will be reduced
by 19.3 percent.
Despite urging from faculty to keep the target
for Libraries and Information Resources below 5
percent, acquisitions and services received a 7.5
percent target. The administrative and informa
tion services portion of the libraries received an
even larger target — 13.5 percent.


GB Manriquez — Daily
Administrative areas also
received reduction targets signifi
cantly larger than the schools.
The General Counsel's office
, must reduce its operating budget
by 19.2 percent, and Student
Resources received a 12.6 percent
.target excluding Residential Edu
cation. (See main story.)
Vice-presidential areas that
received smaller targets recog
nized their good fortune yester
day.
I "We are very grateful," said
Elizabeth Sloan, director of com
munications for the Office of
Development, which received a
10.1 percent target. "We are not
unmindful that we are at the
, small end of the scale."
But regardless of the size of
their target, administrators rec
.ognized that major decisions will
have to be made for the Universi
ty to reduce its operating budget
Tby $43 million — or almost 12
percent.
Academic cuts 'unavoidable'
Although administrators with
in the schools emphasize they will
try to increase revenues, most
.admit that cuts are unavoidable
when trying to meet a reduction
target of about 8 percent.
; Humanities and sciences will
make "selective cuts," according
to Senior Assoc. Dean Carolyn
Lougee, who said some academic
areas may face large cuts or total
elimination.
Lougee said internal commit
tees have identified several
departments and programs as
candidates for substantial reduc
tions or closure: drama, Humani
ties Special Programs, photogra
phy, design, black performing
arts, music performing arts, Inno
vative Academic Courses and
urban studies.
The School of Earth Sciences is
considering merging "two or more
departments ... to save costs,"
according to a statement released
by Dean Gary Ernst.
Almost all the schools recog
nize that limits will have to be
placed on hiring new faculty, and

many predict that the number of
faculty positions will shrink over
time.
For instance, the School of
Engineering has declared a freeze
on faculty hiring, according to a
statement released today by Dean
James Gibbons and Senior Assoc.
Dean Charles Kruger.
The Law School's budget
reduction plan relies heavily on
"letting the faculty downsize
through normal attrition and

leaving positions unfilled," said
Dean Paul Brest.
Other schools considering a
smaller faculty include Humani
ties and Sciences, the School of
Education and the Business
School. The statement from earth
sciences did not discuss faculty
size.
Expenses unrelated to faculty
hiring will also be examined. For
instance, the School of Education
will look at "re-configuring cleri
cal and support staff and reducing
facilities support," said Anne
Gaddy, associate dean of adminis
tration.
Schools are also intensely
examining revenue-enhancement
proposals.
For instance, education, engi
neering and humanities and sci
ences are all considering increas
ing the number of students in

master's programs. These stu
dents pay full tuition and would
increase the revenue within the
specific school.
Both the Business and Law
Schools have rejected large
increases in enrollment.
"We are not going to change
the basic size of the Business
School," Baron said.
Brest said the physical size of
the Law School prohibits a large
increase in students and added

that the "intimate atmosphere" of
the school is "what distinguishes
it."
Engineering is considering a
"relatively small increase in grad
uate tuition," according to the
statement from Gibbons and
Kruger.
Several schools also plan to
increase their fund-raising
efforts. Gaddy said the School of
Education will begin a "planned
strategy for increasing annual
expendable gifts by a modest
amount."
Proposals for all the schools
are still in the planning stages, as
the deadline for budget-reduction
plans is not until Jan. 17.
Some form of input from stu
dents, faculty and staff will be
incorporated, but the exact deci
sion-making process is still under
discussion for most schools.

Programs and departments
that may be significantly
reduced or closed in
Humanities and Sciences:
Humanities Special
Programs, Innovative
Academic Courses,
Black Performing Arts,
music performing
arts, design, drama,
photography and
urban studies.

In humanities and sciences,
three faculty committees have
examined their main areas —
humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences.
The committees identified vul
nerable programs and reported
back to a central school commit
tee. Dean Ewart Thomas and
committee members have already
talked to "a lot of students" and
will continue to do so throughout
the budget process, Lougee said.
Administration hit harder
Vice-presidential areas have
only one real option to meet their
reduction targets — make cuts.
On the heels of the $22-million
reduction in administrative ser
vices known as "repositioning,"
vice presidents say their areas are
going to have to struggle to find
more.
"It ain't easy" to find more
cuts, said Ray Bacchetti, acting
vice president for planning and
