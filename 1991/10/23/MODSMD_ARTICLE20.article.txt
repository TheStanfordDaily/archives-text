# Stanford students have every right to complain
## 
### 
The Daily's suggestion in its Oct.
21 editorial, "You Can't Complain," is
about as potent, creative and useful as
the argument by our mothers that we
must finish our vegetables because
"there are children starving in
Africa."
Does the board, by pointing out how
bad conditions are in other universities
around the world, hope to inspire stu
dent acquiescence and obsequiousness in
the face of impending budget cuts?
Indeed, many student complaints
around here are petty, but the editori
al's argument, when carried to one logi
cal (not-so) extreme, suggests that a
Stanford drama shouldn't com
plain when his or her department is
eliminated, because students at West
Sudatenland State College don't even
have a drama department.
Students here at Stanford are con
sumers, and we have the right to com
plain as much as we want to in order to
direct the use of our educational dollar.
