## Oh, the magic of Sunday 
### 
Sing to lords and ladies of Byzantium
Of what is past, or passing, or to come.
â€” William Butler Yeats
The gentle rays of the
autumn sun sneak through the
crevice of my curtain, caressing my
face like a furry little kitten. I force open
my eyes. Sunday morning has risen from
the bottle-scattered wasteland of neon
lights and social conquests of the night.
Today I shall heal and just be lazy.
In the plaza, some elderly gentlemen
are sitting around a bench. They all look
quite untidy. They must not have shaved
for quite a few weeks and not changed for
many days. Next to them are two shop
ping carts, in which some old clothing
and blankets are scattered. Puffs of
smoke occasionally rise among them.
Beneath a tree are a few young men
and women surrounding someone play
ing the guitar. They are wearing T-shirts
dyed of irregular and colorful patterns.
Some of them have ponytails hanging to
their shoulders. Others have hair of red
or blue, generally pointing toward the
sky. They are laughing and singing along
with the music. The men are waving
their tattooed shoulders, and the women
are showing their purple lips.
Oh, how long has it been since I so
slowly walked on a public plaza? I have
been rather consumed by work for many
months now. Debugging programs and
designing devices have become my daily

routine. Going to conferences and report
ing to contractors have become part of
my life. I have become friends with the
deer who have so faithfully stood on the
hill, sending me home every night.
This must be the first Sunday of many
months. I am walking as slowly as possi
ble and trying to slow down time.
I lie on the beach whistling to myself.
The clouds are slowly drifting, so unhur
ried and carefree. In the reflection of the
clouds, I see two bare-footed little boys,
walking on a dirt road. One carries a
bucket and the other a nylon net.
They are my cousin and I, hunting for
crickets.
We are soon at the watermelon field. We
slow down our steps and open wide our
ears. Chirp, chirp. We tip-toe closer. Chirp,
chirp. We tear open the vines of the melon
and discover a foot long crack on the soil.
I run down to the river and fill my
bucket with water. The suddenly heavy
bucket makes a little arc out of my body.
Step by step, I finally drag it to the water
melon field.
We cover one end of the crack with our
net and flood the remaining part. In a brief
instant, two long cricket legs first emerge
from the dry portion of the crack, and the
little bug obediently crawls into our net.
Oh, how long has it been since those
carefree days? This must be the first Sun
day of many months. I shall lie on the
beach counting the clouds.
Patches of seaweed decorate the

beach. Hundreds of flies happily mingle
around them. Not far from me, there are
some men and women playing volleyball.
They are leaping and laughing, happily
running around. Their colored shorts
and bikinis mix like splashes of paint.
The gentle sun rays bounce off the firm
chests and golden tans.
Beyond the sands, endless ripples of
the ocean send wave after wave pounding
the shore. Far away, there are dots of
white sailboats, rising and falling with
the ripples.
Hovering above the sea are a few sea
birds. They are staring at the ocean, as if
they were waiting for the ripples to die
down. Occasionally they make a sharp
pitched sound. Another bird from a dis
tance away echoes back.
One bird plunges toward the ocean.
Just as it is about to touch the water, it
slides horizontal and glides on the sea
with a fish in its mouth. It then takes off
and flies away.
I, too, am going to fly, breaking the
sky. But this is the first precious Sunday
of many months, so I shall wait as
patiently as I can.
