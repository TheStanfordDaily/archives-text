# A 						Message to the Stanford Community from the President and Provost on Budget and Strategic Planning
## 
### 
22 OCTOBER 1991
Today we are announcing that we will seek to close a $43 million gap in Stanford's operating
budgets through a combination of permanent expenditure reductions and income enhance
ments. This action responds to a series of events that have significantly changed the revenue
base available to Stanford and to other private research universities. Specific deficit reduction
guidelines for schools and support areas that will enable us to reach the total goal are listed later
in this letter.
We have arrived at these decisions jointly and they are supported by a unanimous recom
mendation of the University Cabinet following months of intensive planning, analysis, and dis
cussion. They are the culmination of the considerable study and thoughtful guidance of the sev
eral special committees that have been formed to shape the planning effort. Chief among these
are the Cabinet Committee on Budget and Strategic Planning (CC-BSP) and the Senate
Committee on Education and Scholarship at Stanford (SC-ESS) and the task forces of both com
mittees. The decisions were also informed by the work of the recently formed Ad Hoc Student
Budget Committee and the Trustee Subcommittee on Budget and Strategic Planning. Of course,
we have been guided by two key statements of mission, Stanford Beyond the Watershed, and the
SC-ESS Statement of Goals and Guidelines. Overall, we believe that this first set of decisions is a rea
sonable and fair reflection of the advice and counsel of many members of the campus communi
ty, who now number in the hundreds. Many of these individuals have generously devoted a
great deal of time over the past several months in helping us reach this first, critical milestone.
The decisions announced in this letter form a prelude to more important decisions that will
take place over the next three months. Indeed, the completion of this first phase of decision-mak
ing is not the final word on the budget planning process; instead, it represents the opening of a
new phase which now moves into the major divisions of the University for three months of
detailed planning and consultation. This is the level at which programs and services will be
reviewed and decisions will be made by the people closest to them. Because so much important
work still lies ahead of us, we will do all we can to ensure the consultative process that has
brought us to this point is broadened and enhanced for this larger job.
THE GOALS WE HAVE SET
Our goals are twofold. On one level, this effort is aimed at ending the serious budget short
falls that began confronting Stanford in the last fiscal year and which will stretch into the future
unless we take action to gain stability in our finances. Simultaneously, we are determined to
transform this period of financial adversity into an opportunity for critical self-examination of
what Stanford has become and where it is headed. Specifically, we intend to:
• Balance the Uniivrsity Operating Budget by 1993-'94:
Stanford's immediate financial goal is to bring its operating budgets back into balance dur
ing the 1993-'94 fiscal year, which begins Sept. 1,1993. The School of Medicine, which
essentially manages its own budget, has developed a program to resolve its own serious
financial problems by fiscal year 1995-'96. For the sake of clarity, we will not deal with the
Medical School's plans in this letter except by specific reference.
This is a goal we are confident we can meet by shrinking the current non-Medical School
operating budget of $362 million by $43 million through a combination of permanent
reductions in expense and by taking prudent steps to increase University income. About
$20 million of the reductions and revenue enhancements must be reflected in the fiscal
year 1992- 93 budget, which begins Sept. 1,1992. That means some of the implementation
steps will begin early in 1992, with many more taking place during the spring and summer
months, and continuing through the actual fiscal year itself. Another $20 million of these
actions must be completed in the fiscal 1993-'94 budget, with the remaining portion to be
implemented as part of the planning for fiscal year 1994-'95. Each of these targets is being
measured in current 1991-'92 budget dollars.
Achieving this critical financial goal will position Stanford to deal effectively with the
important, longer run issue of managing the institution in an era of increasing uncertainty,
as well as opportunity. This matter, which is of considerable importance to our future, is
discussed in more detail on page 11 .
In the meantime, the Board of Trustees has deliberately decided to operate the University
with deficits for several years, covered in large part by the use of reserve funds. Indeed,
the Board has authorized spending up to $100 million in reserves. The Board's decision
signals its desire to encourage thoughtful consideration of all options through a planning
process that is both careful and decisive. It also reflects the success we have had during
the past decade in building a stronger Stanford balance sheet.
• Lay the Foundation for Stanford in the 21st Century:
The University is conducting a comprehensive review of all academic and support areas in
order to make deliberate choices about what Stanford is and where it is going, to identify
and strengthen what it does best, and to size its activities to a scope that it can afford. This
process is designed to move Stanford beyond the watershed of recent problems to a new
terrain of continued leadership in higher education. It will be guided by a vision for
Stanford that preserves who we are and what we are all about. It calls for a recommitment
to the fundamental tasks of discovery and dissemination of knowledge. Scholarly research,
and the teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students, are Stanford's central
activities. We will continue to value and take pride in the many forms of diversity at
Stanford, from the increasing internationalization of our community, to the special
strength we draw from the ethnic and cultural diversity of students, faculty and staff. At
the core of our collective vision for Stanford lies an insistence that excellence continues to
infuse everything it does, even if it means doing fewer things.
For example, our undergraduate program is regularly and correctly judged to be one of
the best in the nation. Stanford offers a large variety of programs, interdisciplinary majors,
and special learning opportunities both on and off campus, as well as close student contact
with the faculty, a chance to work alongside both faculty and graduate students on
research projects, generous financial aid programs, and a first rate residential education
system. These programs need to remain sound, satisfying and competitive with other
major universities even after significant reductions in funding.
The outcome will be a renewed, better Stanford that has responded to a changing environ
ment for higher education that demands more focus, selectivity and excellence in the activ
ities of all universities.
WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO
Our decisions in the first phase of the process can be split into three categories. They are:
(1) Deciding How Much to Do
One of the most important issues we addressed during the first phase was determining the
size of budget reduction and income enhancement needed to achieve a balanced budget two
years from now. The amount has proven to be somewhat elusive because of the extraordinary
degree of uncertainty in our current and future operating environment.
The estimate of $43 million in permanent reductions and income enhancements over two
years is based on balanced, realistic assumptions that will shield us from uncertainty in the
future, and at the same time resist overly bleak assessments that would harm us in the short-run.
The estimate was arrived at by employing a long range forecasting model that weighed the like
lihood of various future scenarios. The key factors that produced the estimate are.
• Reduced reimbursement for the indirect costs of government-sponsored research at
Stanford. This is due to two, related factors.
—The first is the reduction of indirect cost rates paid by the federal government, from the
78% originally budgeted to a rate between 55.5% and 65% following the decision by the
government to unilaterally reduce the rate to 55.5% last April. This reduction amounts to
$22 million a year for indirect costs associated with grants outside the School of Medicine.
Reimbursement for the indirect costs of research represents money that the University has
already spent or has committed to spend on things such as libraries, utilities, building
maintenance, and administrative services. If the indirect cost rate is set lower than the
actual cost of providing these things, Stanford must then use its own funds — endowment
income, reserves, gifts, or tuition income — to pay for them. A significant part of the pro
cess now underway is aimed at reducing the costs of these indirect services as well as re
evaluating the services provided to ensure that they are essential to the research enterprise.
—The second is government-sponsored research in the non-medical areas at Stanford,
which is now expected to remain flat or grow slightly in nominal dollars (that is, no or a
slight increase to account for inflation) for the foreseeable future. This change in research
volume growth, which began falling off during the past year, contradicting earlier expecta
tions of modest growth, currently amounts to over $8 million per year in reduced revenue
to the University's operating budgets.
• New, ongoing costs associated with reform of our accounting systems and other new
systems to establish the infrastructure needed to support organizational changes and to
comply with government requirements.
• Possible loss of the tuition remission provision as a result of government action.
• Spending of reserve funds to cover deficits, resulting in loss of interest income to the
Operating Budget.
The overall goal of $43 million in reductions and income enhancements that we have set will
permit us not only to balance the operating budget within two years, but to plan confidently for
the years 1994-'95 and beyond.
(2) Specific Planning Guidelines for Units
A major objective of the first phase was determining the specific deficit reduction guidelines
for schools and major support units at Stanford.
The Strategy: Two strategies guided us in setting the guidelines. First, support units received
larger guidelines than academic areas, because the latter are more central to Stanford's primary
mission of teaching and research. However, we carefully weighed the impact of the previously
achieved repositioning budget reductions along with currently proposed reductions to reach the
guidelines listed below.
Second, we avoided across-the-board guidelines for units because they don't take into
account the differences among units, their capacity to implement changes, and possible differ
ences in their contributions to the central purposes of the University. In order to accomplish this,
we asked deans, vice presidents and directors to provide us with detailed scenarios of the kinds
of program and service reductions they would envision at various levels of budget cuts. We
made our judgements after carefully reviewing these hypothetical actions in the light of our
shared vision of Stanford beyond the watershed and after discussing them with University
Cabinet members and other University officers, and members of various planning committees.
The consultation and planning process between now and January will establish the ways in
which the goals will be met, although we don't anticipate any major recalibration of these reduc
tion guidelines.
Interpreting the Figures: We have set deficit reduction guidelines for each budget unit. The
guidelines total $26.4 million for the schools, academic support areas, and vice presidential areas
that make up the non-Medical School portion of the operating budget. Tables I through 111 sum
marize these deficit reduction guidelines. An additional target of $5.1 million has been set for the
School of Medicine and is reported in Table IV. All targets are set in terms of 1991-'92 dollars and
budgets.
The raw numbers of the guidelines do not permit comparisons bast-d on relative size of bud
get. Consequently, we have included two sets of percentages. The first set is based on the general
funds allocation to each separate budget that comes from centrally managed sources of funds.
However, many units (especially schools) have additional sources of income from special

endowments, gifts, teaching programs outside of the regular curriculum, etc. The second set of
percentages is based on each unit's operating budget which includes all general funds as well as
revenues from these other sources that are devoted to the support of the operating budget.
Because budgeting practice and opportunity vary from one unit to another, we thought it
more informative to include both percentages. In each case, items that are not subject to budget
cutting have been excluded from the budgets so that the resulting percentage figure fairly repre
sents the burden of meeting each deficit reduction guideline. Examples of exclusions include
debt service, insurance, graduate student aid, etc.
Schools: The six schools that make up the non-medical campus have deficit reduction guide
lines that aggregate to 7.6% of their operating budgets (after exclusions). The reductions amount
to 9.4% of the general funds allocations to school budgets (after exclusions). When the guidelines
are reached, they will contribute $10.8 million to the reduction of operating budget deficits. See
Table I.

•In thousands of dollars
Impact of Repositioning on the Schools: Since we are concerned about the cumulative
effect of repositioning and the current deficit reduction program, we have estimated the
combined deficit reduction guidelines for these six schools from repositioning (already
achieved) and from the current planned reductions. The combined totals across the six
schools amount to 8.9% of their total operating budgets (after exclusions). Recall that
schools had repositioning guidelines that averaged about 5% of the then relevant base, a
base that excluded all academic salaries and benefits. On the other hand, the budget bases
used for these calculations as well as the calculations in Table I include academic salaries
and benefits.
Academic Support Areas: Those areas of the University that provide direct support of aca
demic program are called Academic Support Areas. They include the library acquisitions and
library services functions from the combined Libraries and Information Resources Vice
Presidency, but not the administrative components of those libraries. The Hoover Institution
Library also falls in the Academic Support Areas category. A substantial share of Hoover Library
expenses are supported by restricted income from Hoover Institution endowments. See Table 11.
The Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation (DA PER) is operated as an
auxiliary within Stanford's organizational scheme. That means that DAPER must balance its
own budget with funds available to it and without calling on central University resources.
However, the department does receive an allocation of general funds to provide staffing for
course offerings in physical education and recreation. The deficit reduction listed in Table II for
DAPER will require a reduction of physical education course offerings and may require some
reduction in Varsity II and Club Sports.
The Dean of Research has budget responsibility for a number of interdisciplinary organiza
tions (Institute for International Studies, Humanities Center, Hansen Laboratories, etc) as well as
administrative responsibilities for sponsored research.

Total $3,150 9.8% 8 9%
*ln thousands of dollars
Impact of Repositioning on Academic Support Areas: Returning to the question of the
combined effect of repositioning budget cuts and current reduction guidelines, we esti
mate that the cumulative effect of both rounds of deficit reduction in the Academic
Support Areas will total 17.5 % of their operating budgets compared to the 8.9% listed in
Table II for the current guidelines taken alone.
Vice Presidential Areas: The Vice Presidential Areas provide essential services to students,
faculty, and staff across all parts of the University. They provide support for sponsored research
and auxiliary activities lying outside of the operating budget as well as for all of the activities
within that budget.
Overall, the deficit reduction guidelines displayed in Table 111 are somewhat larger than
those found in the schools and academic support areas. This fact reflects our belief that we can
better afford reductions of service in many vice presidential areas than we can afford reduction
of academic program. At the same time, the range of guidelines is considerably larger, reflecting
some discriminating choices about what services we can do without.
The definitions of general funds and operating budget in Table 111 continue to reflect the
exclusion of certain items, such as debt service, cost of utilities, and purchased services such as
fire protection, which are not subject to budget cutting.

Impact of Repositioning on Vice Presidential Areas: As a group, the vice presidential areas
listed in Table 111 achieved substantially more ambitious guidelines during repositioning
than schools or academic support areas. The cumulative effect of repositioning reductions
together with those proposed here are estimated at 24.7% of the operating budgets (net of
exclusions) of the VP areas. Some areas such as Human Resources, Planning and
Management, and the General Counsel's office will have made contributions to deficit
reductions, including repositioning of well over 30% in total.
School of Medicine: The School of Medicine operates with considerably more independence
than the other six schools. Consequently, when we talk about the University's budgets, we nor
mally exclude those of the Medical School. However, the economic forces that have afflicted the
rest of the University have even more seriously affected the School of Medicine's economics.
As Table IV reveals, the School will need to meet a quite large deficit reduction guideline if it
is to achieve a balanced budget. Because the School's deficit problems are so serious, a longer
term program has been planned. By the time it has achieved the presently planned reductions in
1995-'%, the cumulative effect of repositioning reductions, additional budget base reductions
accomplished in the current year, and the proposed guidelines (in Table IV) will total 17.4% of
the School's operating budget.

(3) Broader Actions and Initiatives:
In addition to the specific planning guidelines for units, we have identified a series of actions
and initiatives that are University-wide in their impact. Some will require further study and
analysis. Although none of these actions will result in major structural changes, some involve
significant policy and program modifications that will help us increase revenue and cut expens
es. Throughout, our concern has been and will be to seek these savings while maintaining the
strength of programs central to Stanford's distinct identity, character, and mission. We estimate
that the cumulative total of these initiatives will contribute more than $16 million to the deficit
reduction program.
Taken together with the $26.4 million deficit reduction guidelines for the schools, academic
support areas, and vice presidential areas that make up the non-Medical School portion of the
operating budget, the more than $16 million identified from University-wide initiatives make up
the overall $43 million goal we have set.
• Undergraduate Student Body Size: We rejected increasing the enrollment of under
graduates as a means of raising more revenue after concluding that it would carry addi
tional costs and be burdensome to implement Instead, we hope to find ways of achieving
more uniform student enrollment over the entire year and across years as a way of mod
estly increasing tuition income while making better use of our resources. It may be possi
ble to achieve deficit reductions of $500 thousand in this way.
• Overseas Studies: The Overseas Studies Program at Stanford is important to the charac
ter of the undergraduate experience here A reduction in general funding, on the order of
$400 thousand will require the Overseas Studies Program to rethink the way it provides
international opportunities to our students while maintaining the central strengths of the
programs
• Public Sen "ice Program, and the Stanford In Washington D.C. Campus: These two pro
grams, also of growing importance to the undergraduate experience at Stanford, will con
tinue to move along their current path toward financial independence over the next few
years. A budget reduction has been established in the expectation that this process can be
accelerated We believe a guideline of about $100 thousand (about 17% of general funds

base) can be accommodated without serious program disruption.
• Financial Aid: We will be submitting a series of proposals to the Committee on
Undergraduate Financial Aid for its advice that will preserve Stanford's policy of admit
ting students regardless of their ability to afford the cost of an education — need blind
admissions — but will also provide operating budget savings. For example, we propose
including the income of non-custodial parents of students when determining financial
need. This policy, and other changes, would be phased in over time, thus excluding, or
"grandfathering" current students. The proposals we will put forward could generate as
much as $2.5 million of operating budget relief. The overall reduction of grants to students
from Stanford fund sources would be about 10%. Stanford sources represent about 40% of
total student aid budgets.
• Tuition and Rix>m and Board: Stanford remains committed to its objective of constrain
ing the growth of the price of a Stanford education. We believe that savings achieved with
in housing and food services over the next several years will allow us to hold levels of
increase in the combined tuition/room and board package to 1% over inflation while at
the same time transferring revenue to the operating budget. We believe that these savings
and a change we will recommend to the Board in the mix between tuition and room and
board fees will result in approximately $4 million in revenues transferred to the operating
budgets.
Stanford's tuition has for the last several years risen at a rate considerably lower than that
of our competitors. We generally regard this as a good thing. However, we must be watch
ful that we not impoverish the very undergraduate program we seek to sustain. Over time,
the savings we seek may not be sufficient to cover the ever escalating cost of the wages and
services that support the high caliber of education we are committed to provide. We must
therefore reserve the option to increase tuition modestly as these costs grow. We anticipate
that this effort, if taken, could generate approximately $1-2 million in new revenue.
• Stanford University Press: The Press currently operates as an auxiliary enterprise with
a subsidy from the University operating budget. We are eager to help the Press develop
the ways and means of becoming financially self-sufficient as the subsidy is significantly
reduced. The current subsidy amounts to about $450,000.
• Campus Building and Facilities Improvement Program: We have decided to defer a
number of capital projects for the foreseeable future, and scale back or cancel our plans for
other projects. In so doing, we will save money by avoiding new debt to finance the pro
jects, and by limiting increases to our operations and maintenance costs as new buildings
come on line. We estimate that more than $3 million of deficit reduction can be achieved in
this way.
• Charge to Expenditures from Restricted Income: There is general recognition that pro
grams and activities supported by restricted funds impose costs on the University by using
administrative and support services. In order that restricted funds might bear more closely
their fair share of overhead costs and as a part of plans to further decentralize financial
management within the University, we will be developing, with wide consultation, an
appropriate charge on expenditures from restricted funds. We expect that this will be a
slow process, unlikely to yield much more than $3 million in operating budget relief in the
immediate future.
HOW WE PROCEED FROM HERE
Over the next three months, deans, vice presidents and directors will begin the process of
developing and refining recommendations to meet their planning guidelines. Their recommen
dations are due on January 17, 1992, after which they will be reviewed by CC-BSP, University
Cabinet, SC-ESS and others. Finally, the President and Provost will review all recommendations,
reserving the right to modify or reject any proposal that adversely affects the broader interests of
the University. The plans will be eventually incorporated into the operating budget guidelines
for 1992-'93, which will be submitted to the Board of Trustees for approval in April.
Here are our general expectations for the process ahead:
• Consultation and Participation: We expect the process at the local level to be broadly
consultative, and this may take many forms. Some, if not all, deans, vice presidents, and
directors of major support areas will appoint local task forces to consult with them to
increase the flow of ideas and alternatives, and to test the feasibility of proposals and rec
ommendations. In any case, we want the consultative process to be representative of the
constituencies served by the units. We will be asking all units to present plans for involv
ing client groups in making choices for program reduction.
• No Across-the-Board Reductions: Just as the first phase of the decision-making process
ruled out across-the-board budget cutting the next phase too must prohibit uniform bud
get reducti on across subunits. We expect recommendations at the local level to be strate
gic choices based on the teaching and research mission of Stanford.
• Creative and Imaginative Solutions: We want both academic and administrative units
to be imaginative and creative in thinking about ways of restructuring to produce real
economies and conserve much of the value of what they now do. This includes looking
across organizational boundaries to consolidate and end duplication of similar activities.
• Faculty: As academic programs come under review in the Schools, it is inevitable that
some faculty billets will be recommended for elimination. We expect these cases can be
handled through retirements and normal attrition. We are particularly concerned that
planning pay attention to the development of current and future junior faculty; they are
the resource that will guarantee Stanford's future success.
• Staff: We must be innovative in finding ways to retrain staff members, place them in
other areas of the University, or look for opportunities for a positive approach to early
retirement. We will not be able entirely to avoid layoffs of staff members, but we can work
to minimize them. The layoffs that do occur will be handled in an ethical and equitable
way.
• Changing How We Work: We must actively seek to finish the job that we began in repo
sitioning but have yet to complete of reducing work loads of staff members in tandem
with the budget reductions, and of tolerating some increase in risk-taking in our jobs.
Rather than trying to work faster, harder, and longer, we must find ways to reduce tasks
that are unnecessarily complex, or that make achieving success more difficult. We also
want to stress more personal responsibility, less review, more flexibility, and more initia
tive.
• Final Recommendations: Deans, vice presidents and directors will be ultimately
accountable for making the final recommendations in their own areas.
• Communication Opportunities: In addition to the opportunities to learn and speak out
about the process in your own units, we will continue to sponsor larger meetings to
answer questions, as long as there is interest in having them. Campus Report will continue
to provide regular coverage of the process. We will report directly to you upon the com
pletion of the next phase.

BUILDING A BETTER, MORE FOCUSED STANFORD
Prospering in an Era of Financial Uncertainty
By undertaking this program of major reductions now, we expect to be adequately posi
tioned to meet the exigencies of the future. Yet achieving a balanced budget two years from now
addresses only part of the financial challenge ahead of us. Maintaining budgetary stability into
the 1990s will require the capacity to manage successfully in a era of unprecedented uncertainty
This is a dramatic change for us, and for other universities, as well. For almost two decades, the
finances of universities like Stanford grew at a comfortable and fairly predictable rate All of that
began to change considerably in the past few years, and shows signs of intensifying in the
future. This outlook calLs for new solutions and approaches, and compels us to leam how to
manage Stanford in a constantly changing environment; to become flexible enough in response
to unexpected shifts in our financial prospects without causing major disruptions within the
organization.
While the reductions are being implemented, we must also bring the rates of growth of con
tinuing income and expense into a longer term, more sustainable balance. Over the past several
years, it has been recognized that the costs of operating Stanford —both in terms of continuing
existing programs and in investing in new programs — have been growing at a faster rate than
revenues. It is our belief that a deliberate set of moves toward a more decentralized form of man
agement and budgeting over the next several years will provide the keys to solving this struc
tural problem. By moving more of the decision-making and accountability for revenue and
expense to the Schools, the incentives for more effective management can be increased. The chal
lenge, however, will be to achieve a level of decentralization that will allow a broader set of
University values to be sustained.
Honoring our Past, Belieinng in Our Future
The celebration of the Centennial a few weeks ago served as a vivid reminder of Stanford's
century of distinction and accomplishment, and its history of overcoming great odds and misfor
tune. In honoring Stanford's splendid past, we can find more than solace as we face the turbu
lence of the present. We can leam perhaps the most important lesson of our history and put it to
work in solving our current set of problems That lesson was manifest during the Centennial
weekend in the gathering of the thousands of alumni, students, faculty and staff, both past and
present, as well as friends. The recognition that Stanford is sum of all of us, that it lives in and
through all of us, teaches that our future, like our past, rests on Stanford's investments in people.
This must be the cornerstone of our plans for building a better University for the 21st century.
Finally, as troubling as it sometimes seems, this new era of uncertainty will also offer multi
ple opportunities to those organizations that are fit enough to seize them. In leaving an era of
rapid growth and entering one of increasing scarcity of resources, some institutions will over
come formidable circumstances and emerge on top. Stanford can and will be among them by
retooling itself and mastering a new kind of innovation and creative, dvnamic thinking the kind
born of necessity during a time of great change and challenge. This is the only way that large
organizations can escape the bonds of incremental thinking and thus increase their potential for
real change and progress It is what will sustain and improve us, and help us to believe in and
shape a future as bright as our past.
