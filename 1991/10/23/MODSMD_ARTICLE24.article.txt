## Stanford gets $8 million for brain research center 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
A consortium of Stanford researchers
has been chosen as one of three multi
million dollar "Silvio Conte Centers for
Neuroscience Research," the National
Institute of Mental Health announced
last week.
Stanford's center will receive approx
imately $8 million over the next five
years for research about the fundamen
tal processes underlying learning, mem
ory and other brain functions.
"People are really excited about
understanding brain function," said Dr.
Richard Tsien, principle investigator for
the center.
Synapses, the clefts between adjacent
nerve cells, will be the primary research
interest of the center. Because these
clefts are the points of information
transmission from one cell to another,
researchers believe that long-lasting
changes in the workings of synapses are
essential for learning and memory.
The center will allow for a much
more interdisciplinary approach to
investigating the brain than could be
accomplished if the scientists were
working under individual grants,
according to Tsien, chairman of the
Department of Molecular and Cellular
Physiology. The researchers include
several molecular and cellular physiolo
gists, as well as a pharmacologist and a
neurobiologist.
"Although the group is unified by
common interests in closely related
questions, the individual investigators
represent a diversity of backgrounds
and intellectual approaches," said
Tsien. Together, they bring to the Cen
ter a wide array of expertise and experi
mental techniques.
"We're like a bunch of jazz musi
cians; we all sort of know the tune, and
we're improvising together as we go

along."
One of the the specific processes the
researchers will investigate is called
long-term potentiation (LTP). In this
phenomenon, after a synapse receives a
quick burst of intense activity it is
changed so that communication
between the cells bordering the synapse
is improved.
Specifically, the investigators will
test the hypothesis that LTP involves
two-way communication between the
message-sending (presynaptic) and mes
sage-receiving (postsynaptic) cell. They
suspect synaptic alterations can be
explained in terms of the chemicals sent
and received by the cells. This process is
thought to be different from the usual
one-way communication from the presy
naptic to the postsynaptic cell.
Tsien is encouraged by the award,
especially in light of the recent indirect
cost and budget problems of the Univer
sity.
"It just goes to show that life goes on,
despite various crises in the University.
There's still a lot of good, solid research
going on here," said Tsien.
The centers, which have also been
established at Northwestern University
and UC-San Francisco, are named for
the late Silvio Conte, former U.S. Rep
resentative from Massachusetts, Conte,
who was an enthusiastic supporter of
neuroscience research, introduced legis
lation to declare the 1990s the "Decade
of the Brain."
In addition to Tsien, the researchers
involved with the center include
Stephen Smith, Thomas Schwarz,
Daniel Madison, Richard Scheller and
Richard Aldrich, all from the Depart
ment of Molecular and Cellular Physiol
ogy; also involved are Howard Schul
man, associate professor of pharmacolo
gy, and Carla Shatz, formerly of the
Neurobiology Department and now a
faculty member at UC-Berkeley.
