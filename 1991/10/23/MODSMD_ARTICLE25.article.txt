# Stomach cancer linked to bacteria
## Common organism infects about 50 percent of American adults

Long-term infection with common
stomach bacteria increases the risk of
stomach cancer, according to a recent
study headed by a Stanford researcher.
Previous research has linked the bac
terium, Helicobacter pylori, to stomach
ulcers and stomach inflammation.
However, a study led by Julie Parson
net of the School of Medicine provides
the strongest evidence yet that these
bacteria, which infect approximately 50
percent of all Americans, contribute to
the development of stomach cancer.
Stomach cancer is the second most
common form of cancer in the world fol
lowing lung cancer. In the United
States, stomach cancer kills about
13,000 people each year.
Parsonnet, assistant professor of
medicine, and her colleagues performed
a case-study of 186 people who devel
oped stomach cancer and compared
these patients with people of similar
race, social status, sex and age who did
not develop cancer. All subjects were
selected from a pool of nearly 129,000
patients who had participated in a
study by the Kaiser Foundation in the
19605.
The research team analyzed these
patients' case histories and blood sam
ples, all of which had been collected
from these patients as part of the
Kaiser project. At the time the samples
were collected, none of the patients had
been diagnosed with cancer.
After analyzing the blood samples
for the presence of the bacteria, the sci
entists found that 84 percent of the
patients later diagnosed with stomach
cancer had been infected earlier, com
pared to only 61 percent of the cancer
free patients.
"Helicobacter pylori may contribute
to cancer in a variety of ways," accord
ing to Parsonnet. "First, the bacteria
causes inflammation of the stomach,
and this causes cells to divide rapidly.
The more cells replicate, the greater the
chance there is for error in replication.

In spite of her find
ings, Parsonnet is not
advising every person
be tested for the bac
teria and treated for
the infection.

These errors can cause cells to become
cancerous.
"Second, the leucocytes (white blood
cells) which fight the infection release
toxic substances [that] may act not only
on the bacterium but [alsol on healthy
cells as well. Most notably, substances
known as free radicals may do damage
to healthy cells."
Helicobacter pylori is an extremely
common stomach bacterium. Parson
net estimates that up to 50 percent of
all adult Americans may be infected and
notes that in some countries, such as
Mexico, infection rates approach 100
percent.
Most people infected with the organ
ism are asymptomatic; that is, they
express no outward signs of infection.
Once someone is infected, they usually
harbor the bacteria for life unless they
are treated.
Despite the bacteria's widespread
prevalence, it is not specifically known
how the bacteria is transmitted. Efforts
to link it to food and water have proved
inconclusive, according to Parsonnet. It
is thought the bacteria may be passed
directly from person to person, but "a
husband and wife may have completely
different strains of the organism," said
Parsonnet.
"It's smart," said Parsonnet about
the bacterium. "It's the only bacteria
known to live in the stomach. To live in
such an acidic environment, it's obvi
ously very specialized."
Because infection rates are high in
comparison to rates of stomach cancer,
Parsonnet thinks there must be some

other factors involved in the onset of
cancer.
"Infection alone almost certainly is
not enough to cause cancer," said Par
sonnet. "There must be other co-fac
tors, such as diet, genetics or toxins."
Fruits or vegetables, which are high
in vitamins A, C and E act as antioxi
dants and may protect the body against
cancer, according to Parsonnet. On the
other hand, a diet with a high nitrate
content, such as one that includes many
salty or smoked foods, may be a co-fac
tor in the onset of stomach cancer.
In addition to these co-factors, age at
the time of infection may also be an
influential variable, said Parsonnet.
Because cancer takes a long time to
develop, she hypothesizes that those
people infected at an early age are more
likely to develop cancer. People infected
later in life may just develop ulcers.
In spite of her findings, Parsonnet is
not advising every person be tested for
the bacteria and treated for the infec
tion.
"It makes no sense," she said, in
response to suggestion that all infected
people be tracked down and treated.
"While the treatment is relatively inex
pensive — probably less than $100 per
person — that means in America alone
you'd be tracking down at least 100 mil
lion people. That's just not practical."
On the other hand, this new knowl
edge could be used to screen people who
are at high risk for stomach cancer,
according to Parsonnet. For example, it
is known that people of Japanese ances
try have a greater chance of developing
stomach cancer than do other people
and can be screened for the bacteria and
treated with antibiotics as a precaution
ary measure.
Parsonnet's findings are also signifi
cant for determining future research
priorities.
"Now that it seems that this one
organism is involved in stomach ulcers
and cancer, researchers should investi
gate it further. If you had a vaccine, you
could prevent both ulcers and cancer,"
she said.
