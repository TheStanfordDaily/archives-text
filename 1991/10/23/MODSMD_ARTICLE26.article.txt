# Taxol, effective new anti-cancer drug, surrounded by controversy
## 
### Catherine Ivey 
; The National Cancer Institute announced last
• month that taxol, the controversial anti-cancer
! drug derived from the Pacific yew tree, will be
; used in clinical trials on ovarian cancer patients
• in 39 cancer centers around the United States.
! Stanford University Medical Center, one of the
; designated sites, has already had success with
i first ovarian cancer patient, Audrey
i who began receiving taxol treatments afipr
; removal of a cancerous lump last January.
According to Dr. Nelson Ting, a gynecologic
' cancer specialist and Avansino's doctor, the
; patient is "doing great."
• Despite the apparent success of the Universi
' ty's first trial, scientists are hesitant to label taxol
as a cure for cancer, and many problems with the
collection of taxol remain unresolved. The use of
taxol has sparked age-old debate about human
beings' responsibility to nature and to them
selves.
On the one hand, the medicinal powers of taxol
have resulted in a 50 percent success rate in sig
nificantly reducing breast cancer tumors. Fur
thermore, the recent successes it has had with
ovarian cancer suggest hope for a cure.
On the other hand, producing taxol is by no
means a harmless process. Taxol comes from the
bark of the Pacific yew, a tree indigenous to the
Pacific Northwest. Once stripped of its bark, a
yew tree will die.
According to National Cancer Institute esti
mates, many pounds of this tree are needed for
even one "treatment" — a fact of grave concern to
many environmentalists. In fact, about 60 pounds
of unprocessed bark, or three trees per patient, are
needed.

Worried that pharmaceutical companies and
scientists will cut down the yew forest in wasteful
ways, conservationists would like to see the "won
der drug" synthesized in the laboratory.
Unfortunately, this hope is much easier said
than done. Chemists and scientists nationwide
are already hurriedly working to produce the
anti-cancer units of taxol chemically. The com
plex molecular structure of taxol has complicated
this task. So far, it has only partially been syn
thesized.
At Stanford, a team of chemists under the
guide of Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender have recre
ated the core unit of taxol and are hopeful, but
not over-confident, about the chances of entirely
synthesizing the powerful drug.
Part of the difficulty in synthesizing taxol is its
unique mechanism of action and the lack of infor
mation about it. Unlike any other anti-cancer
agent, taxol works to stop the proliferation of can
cer cells by inhibiting the working activity of
microtubules.
Microtubules make up the cell's skeleton and
are also responsible for its ability to divide and
replicate. By stopping the action of microtubules,
taxol prevents new cancer cells from forming and
growing.
"The biggest problem with cancer is not neces
sarily that you have transformed [cancerousl
cells. Rather it's the unchecked, uncontrolled pro
liferation of these cells," says Wender.
Other problems with taxol exist. Patients have
experienced numerous side effects such as hair
loss, allergic reactions and disorders of the ner
vous system. In addition, some health organiza
tions, such as the American Medical Association,
are concerned taxol will not be made available to
patients from all backgrounds and incomes.
