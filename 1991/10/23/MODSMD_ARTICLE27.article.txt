Earth: The lunatic asylum of
the solar system
— Samuel Cadman
Q % I've heard jokes about a
• Flat Earth Society. Is this
for real? How can anyone still
believe the earth is flat?
A. It is a sad fact — the 2,500
• members of the Flat Earth
Society International truly
believe the earth is flat. Before I
berate the group whose motto is
"restoring the world to sanity,"
I'll provide a brief history of
how humankind learned the
earth is round.
Every culture before the
Greeks assumed the world was a
rectangular slab. About 500
B.C. Hecatus proposed the
earth to be a circular slab, 5,000
miles in diameter, with Greece
in the center.
Conceptual problems exist
with a flat earth. What is under
neath? Is the earth infinite in
the downward direction? Is it
possible for one to fall off the
earth?
Early Hindus tried to avoid
some of these difficulties by
assuming the earth was sup
ported by 4 pillars. So what sup

ported the pillars? Each bal
anced on the back of a great ele
phant. And the elephants? They
stood on a giant turtle. And the
turtle? It swam in an ocean. And
the ocean? You can see how this
theory kept Hindu philosophers
quite busy.
Later Anaximander, a Greek,
suggested the earth was a cylin
der curved north and south.
This explained why when one
traveled north, southernmost
stars disappeared from view. It
explained how ships could disap
pear on the horizon without
falling off the earth. It also
made the involved explanations
of the Hindus unnecessary.

But Philolaus, in about 450
8.C., rejected Anaximander's
theory. He observed a lunar
eclipse (when the earth moves
between the moon and the sun)
and noticed the earth cast a cir
cular shadow on the moon. The
only object that would cast a cir
cular shadow is sphere. A cylin
der would cast an elliptical shad
ow.
Aristotle reviewed all the evi
dence and arguments and by
350 B.C. it was widely accepted
that the earth was a ball. And,
until Copernicus, the earth was
assumed to lie in the center of
the heavens.
Since Aristotle, humans have
traveled around the world by
ship and by plane. We observe
and photograph the sphere
shaped earth from space. (To be
precise, the earth is not a perfect
sphere — it's diameter varies
slightly in different directions.)
So what do Flat Earthers say
about this? They say their soci
ety is the oldest on earth
"because it began with the cre
ation of the flat earth." Isn't
that special? They maintain
that scientists "consist of the
same old gang of witch doctors,
sorcerers, tellers of tales, the
'Priests-Entertainers' for the


The
Science
Bug
common people."
In their propaganda, Flat
Earthers refer to their belief in a
flat earth as a "proven fact"
although they do not provide sup
porting evidence. Their other
tenets include:
• The earth is infinite in size in
all directions (Whew! What a
mind-blowing concept!);
• The sun and moon are each 32
miles across and 3,000 miles away;
• The sun and moon do move.
The earth does not move (So
where is the sun during the night?
How does it revolve around an
infinite flat earth?);
• The planets exist but are
"tiny" (In reality, Jupiter is the
size of 1,400 earths.); and
• Continental drift, the result
ing earthquakes and volcanoes
are the result of earth and water
"being shaken asunder by God."
(Watch out for that lightning,
Round Earthers!)
I find it fascinating that any
body of sound mind could believe
these things. I thought about sub
scribing to "Flat Earth News" to
see if I could discover what makes
them tick. Their membership
application says they do not want
"stupid, mindless, brute beasts
with two feet."
Unfortunately, they scared me
off. Members-to-be must sign an
affirmation not to "harm, degrade,
damage or defame this Society"
(or be struck down by lightning?)
and I suppose I've already done
that.
