# Exposing false data has consequences, says researcher
## 
### Joelle Linder 
When M argot O'Toole exposed
falsified research findings in a paper
published by her superior, she trig
gered a debate in the scientific com
munity that left her an outcast in
her field. Only recently has she been
vindicated by her colleagues.
O'Toole described her experi
ences to Stanford students Thurs
day night as a part of the "Branner
Presents" series.
In the five years since the dis
puted paper was published,
O'Toole has worked within the sci

entific community to arrive at a
consensus on how to deal with alle
gations of misconduct. But "first,"
she said, "we have to reach a defi
nition of what proper conduct is."
In 1986, O'Toole was working
as a postdoctoral fellow at MIT in
the Center for Cancer Research.
After working with Thereza Iman
ishi-Kari for one year, O'Toole dis
covered "by chance" that a scientif
ic article by Imanishi-Kari that
suggested transplanted genes
could stimulate a recipient's
immune system "contained serious
mistakes."

The paper, which appeared in
Cell magazine in 1985, was co
authored by David Baltimore, a
Nobel laureate.
O'Toole brought the discrepan
cies to the attention of university
officials, asking only that the cor
rections be made by Imanishi-Kari
and her co-authors. Both MIT offi
cials and the authors refused and
accused her of vindictiveness. She
soon lost her job.
She believes the principal play
ers involved have hurt themselves
all the more by choosing to cover
up.

O'Toole said the basic problem
facing others who might want to
come forward with other acts of
misconduct is that there is no
mechanism for dealing with them.
According to O'Toole, this creates a
"deadlock."
"Science is the search for truth...
[andj we will not find the truth if we
bend the data to fit our hopes." This
is the fundamental principle of sci
ence, according to O'Toole.
"It is no longer an error when
you know about it and you don't
correct it.... Then it becomes mis
conduct," she said. O'Toole said
the nature of misconduct at MIT
included data misrepresentation
and fabrication as well as the
refusal to correct the study.
But as long as the scientific com
munity promotes misconduct out
of fear of either losing money or
creating an atmosphere of faltering
credibility, O'Toole said extensive
damage is being done by those who
will not follow the fundamental
principles of science.
Scientists who try to make new
studies on the basis of past
research will waste tremendous
time and money if there is no solid
ground from which to advance.
According to O'Toole, "to knowing
ly allow another scientist to be mis
led by false claims is an act of con
tempt for the labor of scientists
and for science itself."
Because science builds on itself,
"The whole system collapses,"
according to O'Toole, if truthful
ness and accuracy are no longer the
norms.
The long lasting effect of these
damages may result in the profes
sion itself becoming unattractive to
future generations of scientists.
A final report by the National
Institutes of Health on the miscon
duct of Imanishi-Kari will be
delayed until the U.S. attorney in
Baltimore, Maryland, decides

whether or not to indict Imanishi-
Kari on charges of fraud.
Throughout the ordeal, O'Toole
has maintained that she just want
ed to have the truth published for
the simple benefit of science.
Through it all, she persevered with
the support of her family and
friends behind her.
Kevin Sheehan, a Stanford post
doctoral fellow, and Marielena
Scanlon, who came to Thursday's
speech, are two friends that have
known O'Toole since 1986.
"Margot was treated totally
improperly," said Sheehan. "We make
fun of lawyers for being sleazy At
least they have ethical standards. Why
is it scientists don't?"
Physical chemistry graduate
student Nancy Hansen, a member
of the audience, said she felt a little
disillusioned by O'Toole's conflict.
As a member of the next genera
tion of scientists, she said, "The
prospect of having to play the game
in order to survive in the field is
scary. I hope it's not as bad as it
sounds."
Hansen described the tempta
tions involved in the fierce compet
itive nature of science research —
especially in medical research.
"There's a real rush and a real
competitive atmosphere to publish
first, and it's a tough field to sur
vive in. . . . You want a list of
research achievements that look
like they mean something. So if
you could jazz up your research by
showing that it has some real
impact, then that's all the better
for your career."
Hansen said young scientists
might be more apt to speak up
because of their naivete.
One person who attended the
speech said O'Toole was brave to
come forward. She modestly
replied, "I wasn't brave; I was
naive. I just thought to correct the
paper."

the importance of scientific integrity to a Branner audience last week.
