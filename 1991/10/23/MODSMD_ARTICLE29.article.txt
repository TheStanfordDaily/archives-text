## Colwell kicks soccer past willful Spartans 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team took
on a small and inexperienced San Jose
State squad yesterday — and were very
fortunate to win, edging the Spartans, 2-1,
at Maloney Field.

"I would not have been surprised with a
tie," Cardinal coach Colin Lindores said.
"They outplayed us today."
Forward Wade Colwell agreed. "We
made a potentially easy game difficult, and
played sloppy at the end .... we were pret
ty lucky, I guess."
The first half, however, bared no sign of
things to come. Stanford (9-2-4) simply
dominated the initial 45 minutes of play.
Colwell, making only his fourth start of
the season, took advantage of his opportu
nity and scored his first two goals of 1991.
Less than four minutes into the game,
Colwell brought down a Ryan Collins
header and blasted a shot into the lower
left side of the net, giving the Cardinal a 1-
0 advantage. Six minutes later, Colwell
collected his second goal of the game, this
time off of a Jason Vanacour pass.
Despite his scores, Colwell was not
pleased with his effort. "I played decent,"
the senior said. "When you score two
goals, it tends to hide some other mistakes

that you make."
When a team scores only two goals,
however, mistakes take on a crucial signif
icance. After scoring twice in the first ten
minutes of the contest, Stanford looked
sluggish, managing few other serious scor
ing opportunities.
Slowly, the Spartans (5-9-1) began to
bite back. After managing only three shots
on goal in the first 75 minutes of play, San
Jose came alive at the end of the second
half. With 12 minutes to go in the game,
Spencer Belideau capitalized on a one-on
one opportunity with Stanford goalie Kyle
Krpata, scoring to Krpata's right from
seven yards out.
With eight minutes remaining, San
Jose State had their best scoring chance of
the afternoon. The Spartans' Mike Hack
ett had his shot tipped over the crossbar by
Krpata, and the ensuing corner kick was a
perfect one. With the ball bouncing inches
from the goai line, Krpata made two
incredible saves directly in front of the net.
Lindores, while disappointed with his
own squad's play, was impressed with the
Spartans' performance. "They played last
night (a 1-1 overtime tie against UNLV),
and after we scored two quick goals, a lot
of teams would have died out there. They
played a scrappy game."
With NCAA Tournament selections
only weeks away, yesterday's unconvinc
ing win might hurt the Cardinal, who were
ranked for the first time (No. 29) in this
week's ISAA poll. "We've got to wake up
and say, 'Hey, we should put these guys
away,'" Lindores said. "Playoff teams get
in because they belong, not because it's
given to them."

Wade Colwell puts his best foot forward in Tuesday's game against San Jose State. Luckily for the Cardinal, his foot was
enough. Colwell scored twice to lead Stanford to a 2-1 victory.
