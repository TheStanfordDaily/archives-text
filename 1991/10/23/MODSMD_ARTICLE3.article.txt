# PA firefighters battle blazing hillside
## Crews rode a 'roller coaster of emotion'

When Kenneth Green of Palo
Alto Fire Station One became a
firefighter, he could not know
that his first real fire would be
one of the biggest in California
history — or that he would be
fighting to save his hometown.
Green was a member of the
first strike team from the Palo
Alto Fire Department to fight the
1,700-acre East Bay blaze last
Sunday.
The fire was more personal for
Green because he grew up in
nearby Rockridge, where his
mother still resides. "I used to
play in there, ride my bike
around," Green said. "I grew up
there."
When the Palo Alto firefighters
arrived at Broadway Terrace, the
southern edge of the fire, resi
dents had evacuated and flames
had already engulfed many hous
es, according to Battalion Chief
Don Dudak.
Firefighters worked continu
ously, taking only sporadic breaks
to eat food provided by the Red
Cross. Their objective, Dudak
said, was "to protect as many
homes as we possibly could."
They worked amid intense
heat. "It was baking me," Green
said. "You could feel your face like
you were in an oven."
One of the greatest moments of

anxiety for these firefighters
came when the fire began advanc
ing on their west flank, according
to Dudak. It spread rapidly
because of gusty winds and large
amounts of dead vegetation.
"Sometimes, I looked around
to see . . . how I would get out of
there," Green said. "I always felt
like I was in danger because the
wind could shift at any minute."
As Green stood his ground —
with 30-foot trees exploding in
flames above him — he experi
enced a wide gamut of emotions.

"Sometimes I was wondering
'What am I doing here?' It was
that scary," he said.
At the same time, though, the
atmosphere was "exciting and
action-packed," Green said. "We
had a job to do and my thoughts
were, 'Do it.' "
When the Palo Alto team
arrived, most of the houses were
already gone, or burning to a
point where they could not be
saved, according to Dudak. But
during more than 12 hours of con
taining the blaze, Dudak saw 15

to 20 houses crumble to the
ground.
"I felt frustrated and over
whelmed. All that was left were
monuments of standing fire
places, smouldering ash and rem
nants of cars, furnaces and appli
ances," said Dudak.
"The hardest part is telling
somebody they lost their home,"
he said.
In the end, the Palo Alto fire
fighters successfully helped pre

battled the firestorm in the East Bay hills Sunday. "The hardest part is telling somebody they lost their
home," Dudak said.
