# PA firefighters battle blazing hillside
## Crews rode a 'roller coaster of emotion' 
### Johnny Sun 
When Kenneth Green of Palo
Alto Fire Station One became a
firefighter, he could not know
that his first real fire would be
one of the biggest in California
history — or that he would be
fighting to save his hometown.
Green was a member of the
first strike team from the Palo
Alto Fire Department to fight the
1,700-acre East Bay blaze last
Sunday.
The fire was more personal for
Green because he grew up in
nearby Rockridge, where his
mother still resides. "I used to
play in there, ride my bike
around," Green said. "I grew up
there."
When the Palo Alto firefighters
arrived at Broadway Terrace, the
southern edge of the fire, resi
dents had evacuated and flames
had already engulfed many hous
es, according to Battalion Chief
Don Dudak.
Firefighters worked continu
ously, taking only sporadic breaks
to eat food provided by the Red
Cross. Their objective, Dudak
said, was "to protect as many
homes as we possibly could."
They worked amid intense
heat. "It was baking me," Green
said. "You could feel your face like
you were in an oven."
One of the greatest moments of

anxiety for these firefighters
came when the fire began advanc
ing on their west flank, according
to Dudak. It spread rapidly
because of gusty winds and large
amounts of dead vegetation.
"Sometimes, I looked around
to see . . . how I would get out of
there," Green said. "I always felt
like I was in danger because the
wind could shift at any minute."
As Green stood his ground —
with 30-foot trees exploding in
flames above him — he experi
enced a wide gamut of emotions.

"Sometimes I was wondering
'What am I doing here?' It was
that scary," he said.
At the same time, though, the
atmosphere was "exciting and
action-packed," Green said. "We
had a job to do and my thoughts
were, 'Do it.' "
When the Palo Alto team
arrived, most of the houses were
already gone, or burning to a
point where they could not be
saved, according to Dudak. But
during more than 12 hours of con
taining the blaze, Dudak saw 15

to 20 houses crumble to the
ground.
"I felt frustrated and over
whelmed. All that was left were
monuments of standing fire
places, smouldering ash and rem
nants of cars, furnaces and appli
ances," said Dudak.
"The hardest part is telling
somebody they lost their home,"
he said.

vent the fire from spreading fur
ther and saved as many houses as
they could. At daybreak, many
residents whose houses were
saved returned to express grati
tude to the firefighters.
The first group of 11 Palo Alto
firefighters left the area
"fatigued" around 10 a.m., accord
ing to Dudak. It was a "roller
coaster of emotion" from the time
they began fighting the fire to the
time they were relieved, he said.
No Palo Alto firefighters were
injured in the line of duty. Like
other firefighters, however,
Green said he experienced dizzi
ness from all the smoke he
inhaled.
The size of the fire shocked
Green the most, he said. "At
night you could look as far as you
could and see things burning, see
houses. They were just dots
everywhere."
