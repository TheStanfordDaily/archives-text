# Prep teammates reunite to captain Card cross country
## 
### Miranda Gresham 
Although the Cardinal men's and
women's cross country teams have been
separate squads the last two years, the
connections between the two are
stronger than just traveling together and
watching each other compete.
Men's captain, Dave Scudamore, and
women's captain, Ashley Black, bring a
unique combination of tradition, shared
experiences, and a close friendship to the
Stanford cross country program.
Black, a junior, and Scudamore, a
senior, both hail from what may be the
biggest cross country high school in
southern California — Peninsula High
School in Palos Verdes.
Peninsula's girls were No.l in the
state for two of Black's years, were unde
feated and won the state championship

when she was a junior.
The boys' team also fin
ished consistently at the
top of the region.
Scudamore and Black
attribute much of their
high school success to
the excellent coaching of
Joe Kelly. "He did a good
job teaching you how to
love the sport," Scud-

amore said "and convincing us that we
trained harder than any other team."
Black interjected, "Which we did."
Training together in high school has
made them both better. "Coach Kelly,
during track season, would have Ashley
and me work out together. Those were
some of my best work outs . . . He'd
handicap it, and I'd have to catch her.
There were a lot of people at the track —

the football team's working out — I'm
going to make sure I catch her."
"And I'm trying my best not to let him
[catch me]," Black said.
Besides sharing races, Black and Scu
damore have endured the same punish
ing work outs and established the same
tough mental attitudes it takes to be the
best.
"We talk a lot," Scudamore said, "but,
I pretty much know how things are with
[Ashley] even if we don't talk."
Scudamore dated Black's sister for
two years in high school so he came to
know Black and her family well over four
years of high school. They've been on
"ski trips and Catalina trips together,"
said Scudamore with a laugh. "Our fami
lies are pretty close," Black said. "They
come to meets together," added Scud
amore. "I probably ate more dinners over

at Ashley's house than at
home senior year."
Scudamore's and
Black's decisions to
attend Stanford were
each more academically
than athletically orient
ed. Both came out of
high school as top-level
runners looking for an
excellent education.

Stanford's dedication to athletics, and
specifically cross country, gave it an edge
over Scudamore's other possibilities,
Harvard and Princeton — and Black's
second choice, Duke.
The team leadership of Black and Scu
damore, and perhaps the interaction,
support, and friendly rivalry of the two,
are revealed by a strong and fairly new
team attitude on both of the Stanford

cross country teams.
"Dave Scudamore has a done a great
job to make us a team instead of a bunch
of individuals," said Gary Stolz of his
teammate. "[There's] much more
emphasis on the team doing well."
Although the cross country runners
had to pay their own room and board for
staying on campus during the last few
weeks of summer, the entire team came
out to practice. Scudamore was not sure
that dedication would have been there in
years past. "People have sacrificed a lot
more this year than any other year.
We've come together. Every individual
on the team has sacrificed for the good of
the whole."
Black said similarly of the women,
"We've emphasized running as a team.

Previous to that we'd spread out
and do our own things. It's really
positive for all of us. I The team
aspect] is really what cross coun
try is all about. It has to be."

"When you know [your team
mates] have paid the price and
they've spilled their guts out day
in and day out, you're not going
to give up during the race," Scud
amore said.
The team approach appeared
to pay off as the men's cross
country team placed fifth at the
Arizona Invitational. The Cardi

nal finished only two points
behind Michigan State, the
tenth-ranked team in the nation.
Stolz led Stanford with a sixth
place finish. Scudamore finished
13th.
Freshman Jeannie Rothman
led the women to an llth-place
finish. Black was second on the
team, Kay Luo was third.
