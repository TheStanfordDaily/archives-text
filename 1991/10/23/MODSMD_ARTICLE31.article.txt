# Nationally-ranked field hockey faces UOP
## Team prepares for playoffs 
### Mike Langford 
The powers of the East are starting to turn their
heads and take a serious look at the mighty Cardinal
of the West. They see a field hockey team which is
now considered among their ranks. And they see a
squad which they could very well face in the NCAA
Tournament.
The Stanford field hockey team continues its sea
son as they take on Northern Pacific Conference
rival Pacific today at 3:30 p.m. in its last conference
game.
Stanford has already clinched the top regular-sea
son conference ranking, and the Cardinal has a 2-0
record against UOP this season, 6-0 in the past two
years. So exactly what meaning does today's game
have? More than you think.
"It is really important for us to win, because of the
standings," sophomore forward Sara Hallock said.
In the latest NCAA poll, Stanford was ranked No.
20 nationally. Incidentally, Stanford was the only
team at a school west of the Mississippi in the top
twenty. In order to continue attracting the attention
of the NCAA ranking committee, the Cardinal will
have to continue winning, especially over non-ranked
teams, such as Pacific.
According to coach Sheryl Johnson, the Cardinal
should have an edge over the Tigers. "We've been
playing real consistently. They've been up and down
the last few games."
With the best record in the NorPac, Stanford is a
lock to be seeded No. 1 at the conference playoffs,
which consequently will be held here on the Farm.
With a win today, Stanford could end its regular sea
son NorPac matches with a 6-0 record, which would
have the team in prime conference conditioning for
the playoffs in a week and a half.
And, as for winning, Stanford is doing a very good
job of it lately. The Cardinal is 9-2 overall, and is rid
ing a five-game winning streak, during which the
team has outscored its opponents 14-4.
"The whole team is playing really well right now,"
Hallock said. "Throughout the season we've grown
together and improved."
No one has proven that more than Hallock, her
self. She has been positively on fire, with 14 goals on
the season, five of them coming in the last three
games. In fact, Hallock is making a strong bid to cap
ture NorPac Player of the Year honors; her 30 points
(two points for a goal, one for an assist) makes up
almost half of Stanford's 65 total points.
Hallock's scoring prowess does not surprise her
coach. "She was our top scorer as a freshman, and
she's strong and smart. She knows where the goal is
and puts [the ball] in," Johnson said.
Also playing well lately is junior midfielder Chris

Trevino, who has seven points in the last three games,
12 on the season. The Cardinal defense, featuring
goalkeeper Kristinal Vidal, is also playing well. It has
allowed a stingy average of 1.18 goals per game.
After facing the Tigers, the Cardinal travel to
Chico Saturday for the last regular season game.
Although Stanford is the favorite, the team is not
taking the game for granted.
"It's always tough to play them because they play
so rough. They tend to just hit the ball and run,"
Hallock explained. "We pass a lot more and are more
structured. We have to pass, and not play down to
them."
