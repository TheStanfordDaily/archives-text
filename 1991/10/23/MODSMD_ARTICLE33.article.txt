# Gridders can win bowl bid
## 
### 
Before this season, Denny Green and his
football team had one goal â€” to go to a
bowl game. On Sept. 14, in Tuscon, Ari
zona, the Cardinal's second-half collapse put
that goal in serious jeopardy. But last Saturday
night, in front of 75,000 screaming BMW own
ers and a horse apparently ridden by Bozo the
Clown, Stanford put itself right back in the
hunt for a bowl bid with a 24-21 triumph over
use.

The Cardinal now has a record of either 2-3
or 3-3, depending how you look at it. The Cor
nell game won't really count as a win when bowl
committees look at our record, because the Big
Red are not a 1-A team (This is a NCAA-rule
technicality instituted just this year). So really
Stanford is 2-3.
The Cardinal lost to Washington, Notre
Dame and Arizona. Washington may well win
the national championship this year. Notre
Dame is pretty good too, and they're also Notre
Dame. So only the Arizona loss looks bad on the
team's record, as a game it should have won.
Stanford has beaten defending co-national
champion Colorado and USC. Both of these
teams are highly respected, and victories over
them make bowl people sit up and take note.
The Cardinal will probably have to go 6-4 to
get a bowl bid. This will not be an easy task, but
the Cardinal has enough talent to do it.
Beating Oregon State on the Farm this Sat
urday is first on the list, but that shouldn't be a
problem. The Beavers have a new coach (Jerry
Pettibone) and a new offense (the wishbone),
but they don't yet have a win in 1991. In fact,
they've lost 11 games in a row. 'Nuff said.
Playing Oregon in Eugene should be a little
tougher. The Ducks won up there last year and
their defense is still strong, but the offense lost
quarterback Bill Musgrave to the NFL. This is
the type of game that past Stanford teams
