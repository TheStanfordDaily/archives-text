# Gridders can win bowl bid
## 
### 
Before this season, Denny Green and his
football team had one goal — to go to a
bowl game. On Sept. 14, in Tuscon, Ari
zona, the Cardinal's second-half collapse put
that goal in serious jeopardy. But last Saturday
night, in front of 75,000 screaming BMW own
ers and a horse apparently ridden by Bozo the
Clown, Stanford put itself right back in the
hunt for a bowl bid with a 24-21 triumph over
use.

The Cardinal now has a record of either 2-3
or 3-3, depending how you look at it. The Cor
nell game won't really count as a win when bowl
committees look at our record, because the Big
Red are not a 1-A team (This is a NCAA-rule
technicality instituted just this year). So really
Stanford is 2-3.
The Cardinal lost to Washington, Notre
Dame and Arizona. Washington may well win
the national championship this year. Notre
Dame is pretty good too, and they're also Notre
Dame. So only the Arizona loss looks bad on the
team's record, as a game it should have won.
Stanford has beaten defending co-national
champion Colorado and USC. Both of these
teams are highly respected, and victories over
them make bowl people sit up and take note.
The Cardinal will probably have to go 6-4 to
get a bowl bid. This will not be an easy task, but
the Cardinal has enough talent to do it.
Beating Oregon State on the Farm this Sat
urday is first on the list, but that shouldn't be a
problem. The Beavers have a new coach (Jerry
Pettibone) and a new offense (the wishbone),
but they don't yet have a win in 1991. In fact,
they've lost 11 games in a row. 'Nuff said.
Playing Oregon in Eugene should be a little
tougher. The Ducks won up there last year and
their defense is still strong, but the offense lost
quarterback Bill Musgrave to the NFL. This is
the type of game that past Stanford teams


Noah Blake
probably would have lost. It's
also a game that this year's team
must win if it hopes to go bowl
ing in December.
UCLA is (surprise) loaded this
year. Led by quarterback sensa
tion Tommy Maddox, the Bruins
crushed Arizona 11 days ago,
and tailback Kevin Williams is
finally fulfilling some of his near
ly unlimited potential. But the
Cardinal topped UCLA here two
years ago and barely lost down
there last year. Both games were
hard-fought, close contests, and
this year's game here Nov. 9
should be no different.
The Washington State
Cougars, who will host Stanford
the following week, are tough to
figure out. They were crushed by

Oregon, and yet they hung tough
with USC. They also have super
kicker Jason Hanson, who will
probably not miss a game-win
ning field goal, should it come
down to that. Although their tal
ent probably isn't as good as the
Cardinal's, this team is still dan
gerous.
The last game of the regular
season is, of course, against Cal
ifornia. This year, if you haven't
noticed, they are very, very good.
They only loss so far was to
Washington, and they almost
won that one. But Big Games
are always close, and, as exhibit
ed last year, anything can hap
pen when the Axe is up for
grabs.
Bowl bids are announced the
day after the Stanford-Wazzu
game. Because the bowl commit
tees may assume that the Cardi
nal will lose Big Game, which

will be played the following
week, Stanford will probably
have to be 6-3, not including the
Cornell win, when bids are
announced to get a bid.
If you add that up, the Cardi
nal probably has to win all four
of its games between now and
then. Big Game will be played for
the Axe and for pride and will
likely have no bearing on bids.
Unless, of course, the Cardinal
gets a conditional bid. In that
case, a bowl committee would
postpone its decision until after
Big Game.
In recent years, the Cardinal
has pulled off a few major upsets
every year while losing to some
teams that it really should have
beaten. If Denny and his players
want to achieve their goal for
this year, they will have to buck
this trend.
