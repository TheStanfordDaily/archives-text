# Card-Bear clash is Huge Game
## Both top-20 squads are shooting for NCAA bids 
### Uri Attia Senior Staff Writer 
Big Game comes early this year for
the women's soccer team as they travel
to Berkeley to take on the Golden Bears.
California, ranked No. 11 in the
nation, has been on a roll recently,
bouncing back from a 1-3 start on the
year to win eight out of the last nine
games. The team's only loss in that span
came to the No. 1 North Carolina by a 2-
0 score.
The game marks the fifth straight
game for the Cardinal against a top-15
opponent. Although the Cardinal played
and defeated an unranked Brigham
Young team Monday afternoon, the
game will not count in the standings
because BYU's team has not yet
achieved varsity status.
Cal will be led offensively by Katie
Anderson, who has four goals and eight
assists on the season. Erika Henton, with
five goals and three assists, will also pose
an offensive threat for the Bears. Stan
ford, as usual, will be led offensively by
twin terrors Julie Foudy and Sarah
Rafanelli, who have scored 27 goals
between them.
Stanford has maintained its No. 6
ranking despite enduring its first loss of
the season Friday to the Santa Clara
Broncos. This is the third straight week
that Stanford (11-1) will play its games
while being recognized as the sixth-best
team in the nation.
The game is important for two rea
sons. The game will be a test of whether
or not the team has completely recovered

'We still have a chance to
be the No.l seed in the
West. Santa Clara's got a
couple of tough games
left, and if we play well, I
think we can do it.'

from its first loss in nearly a year. They
will also have their hands full, in the form
of a hungry Cal opponent. The Bears are
fighting to qualify for the 12 team NCAA
tournament.
While its recent victories have all but
assured Stanford a postseason bid if it
finishes the season well, the team has
higher goals which include overtaking
Santa Clara in the standings to become
the best of the West.
"We still have a chance to be the No.l
seed in the West," junior Julie Foudy
said. "Santa Clara's got a couple of tough
games left, and if we play well, I think we
can do it."
But first, the Cardinal will have to get
by Cal and get back on the winning track.
"We're looking forward to Cal," sopho
more Anita Koshy said. "It will be a good
game to get our team back on the road to
triumphant glory."
That road begins with the defense.
The stellar fullback corps, led by senior
sweeper Heather Mclntyre, has only
allowed four goals all season. However,
two of them were scored by Santa Clara,

the last ranked team the Cardinal faced.
Sophomore goalkeeper Leslie Garrard
has eight shutouts and a puny .39 goals
against-average. Mclntyre, Kerry Sti
valetti, Kristen Wair, and Melinda Min
strell deserve a lot of credit for those
statistics. Opponents have only had 66
shots on the Stanford goal, while the Car
dinal squad has tallied its 45 scores on
313 shots on goal.
The Cardinal offense is also probably
eager to show Cal its prowess on the field.
In the last four games before the
Brigham Young contest the Cardinal
only scored five goals.
Three of those scores were by Rafanel
li, who is now tied with Foudy for the
points lead (two points for goal, one for
an assist). They both have 33, one short
of the season record set by Foudy in 1989.
Foudy leads the team in goals scored
with 14, to Rafanelli's 13. The sopho
more, however, leads in assists with
seven. Foudy has five.

Leni Nonoshita traps the ball to gain possession. After controlling the ball the entire
Brigham Young game, the women's soccer team hopes for more of the same when they
face California today.
