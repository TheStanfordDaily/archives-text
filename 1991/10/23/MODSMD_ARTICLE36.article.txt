Men's swimming

Cardinal 139

Bears 104

The crowd at deGuerre Pool
hushed to watch the two famous
swimmers.
When they hit the water,
Morales swam butterfly,
Biondi swam freestyle. It was
only a casual time trial, for
each to monitor his training
progress.
Biondi wore blue and gold, as
a California alum, with Morales,
a Stanford graduate, in cardi
nal. The two ex-Olympians were
participating unofficially in a
Stanford-Cal meet to check
their progress. Morales is on the
comeback trail, looking to win a
gold in Barcelona, eight years
after winning in Los Angeles.
However, the main focus Fri
day was on the current crop of
Stanford swimmers. The Cardi
nal easily beat the Bears, 139-
104, in the first dual meet of the
year for the Cardinal. In the
short-course meet, contested in
a 25-yard pool, Stanford started
the season on a good note after
struggling in dual meets last
year.

"We have great depth," coach
Skip Kenney said. "It's so excit
ing to sit down and write up the
sheets (before each meet)
because we have quality depth in
each event."
Stanford started out the meet
taking first and second in the
400-yard medley, showing the
Bears exactly what was in store.
The Cardinal team of Jeff Rouse,
Tyler May field, Trip Zedlitz and
Erik Maurer won in 3 minutes
21.34 seconds â€” followed by
Brian Retterer, J.J. Freitag,
Brad Budney and Clay Tippins
in 3:21.99.
Rouse led the Cardinal
attack, winning both the 200
individual medley and the 200
backstroke. Rouse set a world
record for the 100-meter back
stroke at this summer's Pan
Pacific Games.
Freshman Ray Carey won the
200-yard fly with 1:49.10, in his
debut performance at Stanford.
He is the first freshman to win
the butterfly in an opening meet
since Morales.
In the most explosive event of
the day, the 50 free, Maurer and
Bill Schell tied for first in 20.99,
demonstrating the prowess of
the Stanford sprinters.
Following a tough dual meet
season Schell had a promising
performance in last year's
NCAA Championships, and
looks to be off to a good start
this season.
Maurer followed up his sprint
victory with a win in the 100
freestyle in 45.39, with Schell
finishing third in 46.79.
Also adding to the Cardinal

victory were Zedlitz who took
second in the 200 IM with
1:52.77, and Alex Kostich who
took second in the 1,000 free
(9:15.71) and third in the 500
free (1:37.64).
Freitag and Mayfield took sec
ond and third in the 200 breast
stroke, respectively, another tes
tament to Stanford's skill in all
strokes.
The Stanford divers pulled
their own weight as well, with
Mark Kraus winning both the
one and three-meter spring
board events. Kraus scored
208.43 on the one-meter and
250.58 on the three-meter.
"Our upperclassmen are way
ahead of where they were last
year," coach Kenney said, "and
our freshmen . . . basically look
like freshmen. They are very
tired and are adjusting to the
new training."
The swimming season is
rushed this year due to the Sum
mer Olympics in 1992, with the
Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships moved up from March to
late November.
Stanford has many Olympic
hopefuls, but the swimmers will
first tackle Texas. The national
rankings aren't out yet, but the
No. 1 spot will be held either by
Stanford or Texas.
Stanford faces Texas Nov. 2,
with both the men and women's
teams facing the Longhorns on
the same day.
"These guys didn't win many
dual meets last year. They'll be
up for all the dual meets this
year, especially for Texas," Ken
ney said.
