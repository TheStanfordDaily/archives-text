# Huckers win twice in tourney
## 
### Dave Donohue 
The Stanford men's Ultimate
team was the only collegiate
team to compete in the Open
Western Regional Champi
onships Tournament held at
Stanford Saturday and Sunday.
Winning two of four, the squad
came within five points of mak
ing the quarterfinals.
The team had qualified for
this prestigious tournament by
upsetting some of the area's
finest teams at the open section
al tournament at Davis Sept.
28-29.
"It was quite an achievement
to make it to regionals," team
mascot Josh "Hungry Hippo"
Hon explained. "Especially this
early in the season. Open teams
are typically far more experi
enced than college teams. Also,
we've only had a few weeks of
practice, while the open teams
have practiced together since
the winter."
East Bay, including Stanford

graduate student Greg Wolf,
won the tournament by handily
defeating the Los Angeles
team, Iguana, in the final
round. South Bay Sunami, con
sisting of six Stanford alumni
plus graduate student Hayward
Robinson, took third place,
thereby qualifying for the
national tournament.
The Stanford team upset the
number two seed in its pool,
Albuquerque, 11-10. In the sec
ond game, the Cardinal ran to a
12-10 victory over Hawaii.
"Then we played Santa Bar
bara," said Hon. "They gave us
a thorough trouncing."
The tournament's top-seeded
team issued the Cardinal an
authoritative 13-3 defeat.
"We lost, but we clearly had
the moral high ground," Dan
"Robespierre" Dresner explained.
"They were an outstanding team
with an unusual offense.
Although they were seeded No. 1
in the tournament, they didn't
place in the top four."

A victory against Santa
Cruz would have sent the Car
dinal to the quarterfinals,
something never before done
by a college team. However, as
Jeff "Mr. Snuffaluffagus" Reed
explained, "We were tired from
playing Santa Barbara. Santa
Cruz was coming off a bye.
They went up on us 5-0. But
we finally got our act together.
We matched them point for
point, and the final score was
13-8."
"It was an unheralded
achievement," co-captain Allan
"Skelator" Padgett said. "We
impressed a lot of people at
(open) sectionals and regionals.
No doubt the news will get
around to the college teams that
Stanford is the team to beat this
year."
The team will lock horns
with other college teams in the
area for the first time Nov. 2 in
the season-opener at Santa
Cruz.
