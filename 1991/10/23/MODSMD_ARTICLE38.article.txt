# THE 						BUDGET AX FALLS
## No stone unturned A 						reference to central budget actions 
### 
More uniform enrollment

The Universi
ty will try to make
the level of stu
dent enrollment
more constant
across quarters
and academic
years.

Currently more students
enroll for fall quarter than for
winter and spring quarters, cre
ating an imbalance that costs
the University as much as
$500,000 annually. The imbal
ance is caused largely by stu
dents who stop-out midway
through the year and fifth-year
students who graduate in fall or
winter, Rosse said.
The University will investi
gate the possibility of admit
ting transfer students in win
ter and spring quarters, Rosse
said.

Shifting tuition, fees
The University may change
the balance between tuition
and room and board fees,
charging more for tuition and
less for room and board. The
sum of the costs will be held to
an increase of not more than
one percent over inflation.
The decreased room and

board charge will
be achieved by
cutting $2.67
million from the
budget for hous
ing and food ser-

vices, which
includes residential education
and University Food Service.
The increased tuition rev
enue — as much as $2.5 mil
lion a year, according to the
statement — will flow into the
operating budget, helping to
alleviate the budget shortfall.
Non-custodial income
Although need-blind admis
sions will be preserved, finan

rial aid may be reduced by
about 10 percent through a
number of other cuts.
The statement proposes
including the income of non
custodial parents of students

when determining
financial need.
This and other
changes would be
implemented grad
ually, and current
students would be

protected. Rosse estimates such
changes could save as much as
$2.5 million annually.
Canceling construction
The University will cancel a
number of capital projects, sav
ing $3.8 million annually in debt
service and future maintenance.

The smaller
earthquake-dam
aged buildings in
the Quad will not
be repaired in the
near future.

The Near West Campus project,
already scaled back significantly,
will be diminished even more.
Taxing restricted funds
Most gifts to the University
as well as endowment income
are in the form of restricted
funds, which must be used as
directed by the donor. The gifts
can be a mixed blessing for the
University, which has to use
operating funds to cover the

indirect costs
and administra
tive overhead
associated with
carrying out the
project.

The University will try to
make restricted funds pay
their own way by assessing a
charge that reflects their cost
to the operating budget. Rosse
said the charge "probably
won't yield more than $3 mil
lion"in the near future.
