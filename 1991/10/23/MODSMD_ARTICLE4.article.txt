Asbestos removal in Escon
dido Village, changes in inter
nal ASSU procedures and pro
posed amendments to the stu
dent conduct code were among
the issues discussed at last
night's ASSU Senate meeting.
A bill recommending that
family dwellings receive first
priority in Stanford's asbestos
clean-up program, authored by
Senator Elizabeth Wahl, kin
dled the most heated debate.
Asbestos contamination in
the family residences of Escon
dido Village has produced many
potential health risks, while
only a small portion of the rent
paid by Escondido tenants goes
to maintenance and upkeep,
according to Wahl's bill.
"There was a case just
recently in which an acoustic
ceiling in Escondido Village
collapsed, spilling asbestos
onto a baby in a crib," Wahl
told the Senate. "The baby was
actually found with flecks of
asbestos in its mouth."
But Senator Jay Bhat
tacharya argued that all stu
dent housing should receive
the same treatment. "I just
don't see children being any
more prone to [asbestos con
tamination! than someone
working in an office or living in
another building," he said.
Senator Travis Katz retali

ated with, "I'm sure a grad stu
dent is not going to sit there
and let asbestos fall into his
mouth. Children are definitely
more at risk, because they are
not aware of it happening."
The Senate passed an
amended version of the bill,
which recommended that
"among University buildings at
equal risk of asbestos contami
nation, priority be given to the
removal in family residences."
The Senate also discussed
various administrative issues.
The administration and
rules committee recommended
that the full Senate keep
groups funded by ASSU special
fee requests from obtaining
lists of students who ask to
have their fees refunded.
Under the new proposal,
according to committee mem
ber David Hyatt, "student orga
nizations can't get the names of
students who take ASSU
money back, but only lists of
student ID numbers after a rig
orous application process."
Hyatt said the proposal
would prevent groups from
calling specific students with
solicitations for financial sup
port. The Senate did not dis
cuss or vote on the proposal.
During the open forum por
tion of the meeting, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson
urged the Senate to discuss
proposed amendments to the judi
cial charter that he said will have
"great and far-reaching impacts"
on students.
The proposed amendments to
the Legislative and Judicial Char
ter of 1968 would change the stan
dard of proof used in student mis
conduct cases from "guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt" to "clear and
convincing evidence" of guilt.
Jackson did not specify what
would constitute clear and con
vincing evidence, but said "more

than 51 percent" of evidence
would need to point to a defen
dant's guilt.
"Stanford is one of the only
universities to use the 'beyond a
reasonable doubt' standard,"
Jackson said. Most universities
use a "clear and convincing evi
dence" standard, he said.
The amendments proposed by
the Committee of 15, a standing
committee chaired by Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode, also include pro
visions requiring the cooperation
of student witnesses and defen
dants injudicial proceedings.
Senate Chair Kevin Warsh said
the Senate may discuss the issue
at future meetings.
