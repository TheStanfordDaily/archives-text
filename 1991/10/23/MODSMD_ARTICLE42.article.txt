# 'Thelma' writer speaks out
## Khouri sought to break stereotypes with movie 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
More than 200 students packed Branner's lounge
last night to attend a presentation by Callie Khouri,
writer and co-producer of this summer's hotly
debated hit film, "Thelma and Louise."
"Thelma and Louise," Khouri's first screenplay, is
a movie about two everyday women who become gun
slinging outlaws after one of them is almost raped.
By placing women in the violent, traditionally
male role of the action-film hero, Khouri sparked
controversy about women empowering themselves
through violent means.
Khouri expressed concern that popular culture
portrays women as victims, often as prostitutes or
models being murdered, while men almost never see
themselves as victims.
"I wanted to write a movie that no one had seen
before, to bust those stereotypes apart," she said.
"Men are not raised with Clint Eastwood going
after a serial sodomist," she added.
Khouri said there is no history of women starring
in action movies. She sees this movie as the first step
toward filling in that blank.
"We are all those things you don't see on the
screen, and it pisses me off."
Khouri considers those who see her film as a form
of male-bashing to be extremely hypocritical in light
of mainstream media's portrayal of women.

Khouri used to produce music videos and for a
long time suffered a guilt complex for paying women
to strut around in skimpy outfits, she said.
She said the opportunity to make the movie was
"payback for all those music videos ... It was one of
the most liberating experiences I've ever had."
Khouri said carrying guns is just a fantasy for
women. In this society, it's men who are "blasting
the shit out of people," she said.
When asked about the ending, Khouri encour
aged ambiguity. "I wanted it to be both hopelessly
hopeful and hopefully hopeless, both artful and
beautiful."
It wasn't realistic for them to get away with a
criminal acts, even if it was in reaction to violent
mistreatment by men. "This world is not yet big
enough for these two women to stay here," she said,
and it's "too bad for this world."
Khouri said she loves her life and is very grateful
that she has a career. "I just think I would be dan
gerous if I didn't."
She is currently working on a southern saga
about love, sex, infidelity and food — "not necessar
ily in that order."
Khouri got her foot in show business when she
started as a receptionist at a production company.
And her future seems bright, as she now receives
proposals to write "anything with a woman in it."
"Thelma and Louise" will be shown at Sunday
Flicks on November 10.
