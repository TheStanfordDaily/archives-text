# Stanford has seen its fires, too

As UC-Berkeley breathes a sigh of relief after
being spared from the raging East Bay flames, some
local firefighters are remembering fires that have
threatened the Stanford campus over the years.
Palo Alto Fire Marshal Phil Constantino
recalled a 1982 grass fire in the Stanford foothills
that reminded him of this week's fire in the Oak
land and Berkeley hills, "only on a much smaller
scale." He estimated that the fire, which occurred
at the edge of Stanford land near Arastradero
Road, destroyed 16 homes within two hours and
burned from 400 to 600 acres.
The area's many especially hot-burning euca
lyptus trees were a great contributing factor in
that fire, he said. Eucalyptus trees were also
problematic in this week's East Bay fire.
In March 1980, Storey House residents found
themselves trapped in their rooms as a fire raged
through their home. Several fire ladders were
employed to rescue the students from the confla
gration, which Constantino described as an

"extreme life-hazard situation."
Even more dramatic, a five-alarm fire engulfed
Encina Hall in June 1972, according to Ray Diaz,
a firefighter at Stanford since 1970. Diaz recalled
that trucks were sent from as far as Campbell and
Burlingame to help control the blaze.
It took eight hours of continuous water pump
ing to put out the flames, according to Constanti
no. The fire erupted in the building's attic,
destroying the upper two floors of the east wing
and leaving the rest of the residence severely
water and smoke-damaged.
The Delta Tau Delta house fire, the most
recent to hit campus, is still fresh in the memo
ries of many, particularly residents of the Theta
Xi fraternity house. Taxi house residents, who
are neighbors to the Delt house, spent several
nervous hours hosing down their roof as the
three-alarm fire sent floating embers their direc
tion two weeks ago.
The investigation of that fire was just closed
this weekend, making the blaze another episode
in Stanford's fire history.
