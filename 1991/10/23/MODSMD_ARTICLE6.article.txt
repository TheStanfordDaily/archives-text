# THE 						BUDGET AX FALLS
## More decisions to be decentralized 
### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
Stanford will move toward a
more decentralized form of
management and budgeting
over the next several years,
University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James
Rosse announced yesterday.
The change will help the
University survive an era of
financial uncertainty for high
er education, Rosse said in an
interview Monday.
"This institution must de
centralize financial decision
making if it is going to sur
vive," said Rosse.
The idea behind decentral
ization is to allow financial
decisions to be made by those
most closely connected with
them, providing them with the
economic incentive to make a
cost-effective decision.
For example, individual de
partments may now be allowed to
decide whether and by how much
to increase their enrollment of
graduate students.
Increasing the number of
master's candidates is a lucra
tive way for the University to
increase income, since such
students usually pay full
tuition or come with corporate
scholarships. But departments
frequently oppose such an
increase because it spreads
departmental resources thin.
Decentralizing would allow
individual departments to
decide how many master's can
didates to enroll. Departments
would be allowed to keep most
of the tuition revenue they gen
erate by enrolling more stu
dents — minus the indirect
costs associated with Universi
ty administrative and student
support services.
In that way individual
departments can weigh the

inconveniences of larger enroll
ment against the increased rev
enue.
Rosse said decentralization
will create more efficient, bet
ter-informed decisions across
the University. "We have to
find a way to bring all this
information into day-to-day
financial decision-making," he
said. "Decentralization is the
best way to do that."
Decentralization could also
be applied to restricted gifts
and research funds, which
would be more easily pursued
by individual schools.
Under the present system,
restricted funds must be
approved centrally because they
create an indirect cost burden
on the operating budget. Decen
tralization would change that,
allowing principal investigators
to attract their own restricted
funds independently but hold
ing them responsible for the
indirect costs.
"By moving more of the
decision-making and account
ability for revenue and expense
to the schools, the incentives
for more effective management
can be increased," wrote Rosse
and University President Don
ald Kennedy in their announce
ment yesterday.
But having schools do more
individual fund raising may
raise some problems, according
to Elizabeth Sloan, director of
communications for the office
of development.
She said Harvard decentral
ized its fund raising about 20
years ago and produced "ineffi
ciencies that have a negative
impact on the marketplace."
It may be "irritating to poten
tial donors" to receive solicita
tions from many schools, and it
is a "foregone conclusion" that
schools will compete against
each other for the same donors,
Sloan said.
