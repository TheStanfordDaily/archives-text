# Process smoother after repositioning
## 
### 
Until the most recent round
of budget cuts, "repositioning''
was still considered a bad word
around Stanford.
After all, who would consid
er a $22-million reduction in
administrative services a good
thing?
But the administrative reor
ganization that accompanied
those reductions has helped
the University manage the cur
rent budget crisis, according to
University officials, changing
more than a few people's
minds about the administra
tive reforms.
Repositioning restructured
many of the administrative
areas of the University, partly
in order to achieve savings.
Among the actions was the cre
ation of the University Cabi
net, composed of the academic
deans, provost and president,
as Stanford's central decision
making body.
The cabinet "has really
come of age as an institution,"
during the current budget cri
sis, said Provost James Rosse.
"It entered the (budget) dis

cussion a little hesitant abput
what its role might be* but has
been "welded as an important
policy-making body."
Rosse said before the cre
ation of the cabinet, the deans
were often hesitant to speak in
a frank manner in group meet
ings.
But he described the
recent budget discussions as
"honest, tough and support
ive." The cabinet was respon
sible for recommending a
final set of budget-reduction
targets and central initiatives
to the president and provost
for yesterday's announce
ment.
Another benefit of reposi
tioning has been the redistri
bution of administrative sup
port services within new and
old vice-presidencies, accord
ing to Rosse.
"The people who are in
place at the heads of these
units are good managers and
professionals in the areas they
represent," Rosse said.
