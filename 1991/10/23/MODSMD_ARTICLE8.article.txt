# Stanford's budget crisis: How it happened, what will happen next
## 
### 
A year ago Stanford was look
ing at a small budget surplus.
Today it faces a permanent $43-
million shortfall.
What happened in between is
a story of unforeseen — and gen
erally unforeseeable — political
and economic misfortune.
The largest factor in the cur
rent deficit was the federal gov
ernment's drastic reduction of
the indirect-cost recovery rate to
55.5 percent. The University had
budgeted for a rate of 78 percent.
The difference translates into a
loss of $22 million per year in
addition to even greater losses
for the School of Medicine.
While negotiations are under
way to bring the rate back up to a
higher level, administrators have
said the 78 percent rate is unre
alistic in the current political cli
mate and they are hoping for a
rate close to 65 percent.
Another factor contributing
to Stanford's reduced income is

the lack of growth in govern
ment-sponsored research. The
research volume has shown only
nominal growth recently and is
not expected to increase as quick
ly as it has in the past decade.
The final significant cause of the
budget shortfall is the stagnant econ
omy, which has reduced the income
from Stanford's endowment.
Although the actual endow
ment has a steady payout rate of
4.75 percent, many of Stanford's
reserves also earn interest that
fund the operating budget and
function as an endowment.
Provost James Rosse admitted
uncertainty still exists in predicting
the size of the deficit, but said the
financial planners created an ana
lytic model and decided to set $43
million as the most likely deficit.
This number assumes that
indirect costs will be at some level
between 55.5 and 65 percent and
is generally "pretty conservative,"
Rosse said.

Although yesterday's an
nouncement of deficit-reduction
targets for schools and adminis
trative areas is an important step,
the process of selecting what to
cut is really just beginning.
Deans and vice presidents will
now form committees and task
forces within their budget areas
and find ways to meet the reduc
tion targets.
In September they submitted
hypothetical proposals to the Cab
inet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning on how to cut
their area by various amounts.
Although almost all of the
schools and administrative areas
received targets yesterday that
were within the ranges consid
ered in September's plan, every
thing must be reconsidered for
the final proposal.
Recommendations of what to
cut are due to the cabinet commit
tee by Jan. 17. The committee will
be responsible for coordinating

the budget cuts across the Univer
sity and preparing a final plan for
the Board of Trustees by April.
Although there are three
months before the schools and
administrative areas must sub
mit their budget-cutting propos
als, the next deadline for the pro
cess will arrive very quickly.
"There isn't a whole lot of
time," said Ray Bacchetti, acting
vice president for planning and
management. "Given . . . the
Christmas holiday right before
the deadline, there is really only
about a month and a half."
The vice presidents and deans
insist that everyone affected by
deficit reductions in their areas
will have the opportunity to give
input in the budget process.
Many schools are now adding stu
dents to budget committees, and
several administrative areas are
looking to add representatives.
