❖
Humanism begins in ancient Greece, Israel, Rome,
India, China, Japan; reappears in modern science
and philosophy; flourishes during the Enlighten
ment as Deism; is still alive and kicking today...as
pertinent and impertinent as ever. A series by
Bill Jaeobsen, Exec Director of the Community.
Nov 17 10:45 am
Ancient Humanism
Nov 24 10:45 am
Enlightenment Humanism
Dec 1 10:45 am
Modern Humanism
Politically Correct...Almost!
Humanists focus on this world, question customs,
revelations, authorities, dogmas—right & left,
verify claims through reasoning and experiment.
In a phrase...we are Unrepentent Unbelieving
Secularist Skeptics. But that isn't the whole story.
While we do challenge the deceit of con-artists
and the gullibility of their marks, we also care
about the well-being of individuals. That's why
we resist the intrusions of the state into matters
of personal privacy, such as abortion and eutha
nasia; why we seek to root out racism, sexism,
homophobia; why we care about injustice, the
population explosion, the environment; why we
sponsor Rational Recovery from substance abuse.
In addition to head and heart, we also have soul.
Humanists appreciate myth as myth, and cele
brate strange festivals. Finally, Humanists keep
things in perspective through the use of humor:
we laugh at the foibles of true believers and at our
own short-comings. We're still changing—we no
longer recite the periodic table or seduce frail
evangelists. With so much head, heart, soul, and
humor...you may find it fits your needs. Drop by.
