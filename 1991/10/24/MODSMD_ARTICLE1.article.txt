# Kennedy: We will lead in era of scarcity

Stanford's recent struggles "will leave us better
positioned to lead" higher education as it enters a
new, more difficult phase, University President
Donald Kennedy said yesterday.
In an interview to be broadcast on KZSU
tonight, Kennedy said the University's current
downsizing and self-reflection will prepare it for a
time of economic uncertainty and a declining
national commitment to higher education.
"All of higher education is going to be subjected
to increased resource constraints," he said. "We
also face now a kind of gulf of public credibility
about what we're doing.
"Universities really need to come to grips with
the problem of how they are viewed, because I think
there has developed a kind of mismatch between
public expectations and what places like Stanford
and the other first-rank research universities are
doing," he said.
"I think the task of sorting that out and then
explaining our own view of our purposes in con
vincing ways, engaging the public in a dialogue
about it, is very important."
Kennedy said he sees "a very significant land
mark" in the recent federal court decision, in Stan
ford's favor, that federal agencies cannot censor the
publication of government-sponsored research.
He added that the case is an example of a recent
problem — the government asserting its authority
over universities and other institutions because of
the resources the government supplies. "I think
that's a part of our destiny that my successor is
going to have to help work out along with other uni
versity presidents," he said.
