# Kennedy: We will lead in era of scarcity
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford's recent struggles "will leave us better
positioned to lead" higher education as it enters a
new, more difficult phase, University President
Donald Kennedy said yesterday.
In an interview to be broadcast on KZSU
tonight, Kennedy said the University's current
downsizing and self-reflection will prepare it for a
time of economic uncertainty and a declining
national commitment to higher education.
"All of higher education is going to be subjected
to increased resource constraints," he said. "We
also face now a kind of gulf of public credibility
about what we're doing.
"Universities really need to come to grips with
the problem of how they are viewed, because I think
there has developed a kind of mismatch between
public expectations and what places like Stanford
and the other first-rank research universities are
doing," he said.
"I think the task of sorting that out and then
explaining our own view of our purposes in con
vincing ways, engaging the public in a dialogue
about it, is very important."
Kennedy said he sees "a very significant land
mark" in the recent federal court decision, in Stan
ford's favor, that federal agencies cannot censor the
publication of government-sponsored research.
He added that the case is an example of a recent
problem — the government asserting its authority
over universities and other institutions because of
the resources the government supplies. "I think
that's a part of our destiny that my successor is
going to have to help work out along with other uni
versity presidents," he said.

meet an operating budget short
fall of $43 million, Kennedy said,
"I would doubt that there has
ever been a process more energet
ically consultative than this one."
"We worked out with each
school a set of possible scenarios of
what we thought was possible
without really crippling the educa
tional effectiveness of the
schools," he said. In spite of the
fact that the overall targets are
similar, "as you looked at the sce
narios, they really looked quite
different."
The similarity of the targets
"doesn't mean that the kinds of
cutting proposals that we actual
ly see from those schools are uns
elective. I think they're going to
be highly selective."
He added, "I think that there
will be, within the schools and
administrative areas, some exam
ples of program elimination."
Kennedy said the changes in
Stanford's financial-aid rules
won't make Stanford less com

petitive in attracting students.
"It's important to emphasize
that these cuts are based on a
careful analysis of the way Stan
ford does financial aid as com
pared with the other institutions
with which we closely compete,"
he said.
"We think that by tightening
up here and there, by keeping

careful track of areas where we
think that we have been more
generous than the competition,
and more generous than we real
ly should be . . . that we can actu
ally realize significant savings."
Kennedy explained why Over
seas Studies did not receive deep
cuts. "The view was that those
programs that constitute our spe
cial strengths are programs that
we may ask to economize a little
bit but that we won't significant
ly reduce," he said.
He also expressed support for
innovative and interdisciplinary
programs. But Stanford will have
to see trade-offs where it once
saw only opportunities, under
standing the sacrifices that are
required even by the develop
ment of a good idea, he said.
"We have to learn that if we
want to do new things, we have to
accomplish them partly, at least,
through reallocation, through
deciding against doing old
things," he said.
"I think we can retain innova
tion, but I think it has to meet a
test of prqviding something of
greater value than something we
already have."
