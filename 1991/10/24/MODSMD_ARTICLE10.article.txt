# Peace Corps: a rewarding experience

The tilapia, a breed of fish, can he grown in a pond
formed by damming up a creek. It consumes algae
that is easily produced by emptying cow-dung into
the water. Thirteen weeks after the eggs are intro
duced to this new environment, a yield of up to 100
lbs. of fish results, either for consumption or for mar
keting.
Although not everyone involved with the Peace
Corps is familiar with the process of breeding
tilapia, each has a skill to share with members of
developing nations.
And over the Peace Corps' 30 years in existence,
1,200 of their volunteers have been Stanford students.
Volunteers have "a desire to make a contribution
tc peace," explained Joseph Therrien, the area
manager for the San Francisco Area Recruitment
Office. He said he believes there will be an increase
in student interest this year, especially now that the
"greedy '80s" are over.
Although it is a volunteer program, the Peace
Corps is by no means noncompetitive. The San
Francisco Office alone handles approximately 1,500
applications a year, while accepting only 300. The
selection process takes six to nine months, and the
job requires a two-year commitment.
Once the volunteers are selected, they are sent to
countries that request their special skills, Therrien
sail Although the selection system attempts to
take requests for certain cultures into account, vol
unteers are generally sent to the areas where they
are most needed, he added.
A Peace Corps volunteer receives just $200 a
month as a "readjustment allowance," accessible at
the completion of his or her service. However, vol
unteers say the personal fulfillment makes up for
the sparse financial compensation.
For example, while Stanford graduate Susan
Sharp said there were frustrations in learning a
new language and culture, she believes all volun
teers would say the experience "changed their lives
for the better." Sharp traveled to Nepal in 1979 to
build drinking-water systems.
Jobs in the Peace Corps range from accounting
to urban planning. And contrary to popular belief,
the skill most in demand is not agricultural exten
sion, but education. Volunteers must have a bache
lor's degree in their discipline.
There are currently 6,200 volunteers in all regions
of Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and
Central and Eastern Europe.
