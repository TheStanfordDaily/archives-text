### Komail Thaver Staff writer 
The controversy over alleged racist implications
of an Omega Psi Phi party flier was the subject of a
debate in the Ujamaa lounge last night in front of
about 25 people.
The flier showed a black warrior holding the sev
ered head of a lighter-colored man with the fraterni
ty's Greek letters on it. It also portrayed a map of
Africa in the background.
The debate featured Michael Newman, a Stan
ford Review columnist who has claimed the flier is
racially offensive, and Brian Hooker, basileus of the
Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Daniel Blumenthal, who
advocated a more moderate position in a letter in

for 'offensive fliers.' "
"I just see this as a [bias] for communities that

Hooker, on the other hand, said he was critical of
"the administration for being soft, in dealing with
racism in a number of incidences," including the 1988
Ujamaa incident, in which a poster was racially defaced.
"The (fraternity's) flier was derived from an
ancient African painting of an African warrior hold
ing on to his opponent's head," Hooker said. He
added that the head was intended to symbolize a
general oppressor, not one of a specific color.
But Newman disagreed. For him, "this message
of liberation was not obvious; instead it came across
as being racist," he said.
