'Welcome Inuchachos, , says Noriega
MIAMI (AP) — Drug barons fleeing
Colombia after assassinating that nation's cru
sading justice minister paid $5 million protec
tion money to Manuel Noriega, who greeted
them with a "Welcome, muchachos," a witness
testified yesterday.
In another development, lead defense attor
ney Frank Rubino all but confirmed the defense
has subpoenaed Iran-Contra figure Oliver
North to testify in the drug trial of Noriega, the
former leader of Panama.
Noriega could be sentenced up to 140 years in
prison if convicted of the 10 drug and racketeer
ing counts accusing him of making Panama a
way station for the cartel's operations. He sur
rendered to U.S. invasion troops in January
1990.
Earrings catalyst for murder
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A teenager who
recovered her cherished $450 gold earrings the
first time they were stolen died fighting for
them during a second robbery, police said.
Chedell Ray Williams was pronounced
dead Tuesday afternoon after she was shot in
the throat at close range with a revolver.
Police later recovered the earrings in a pool
of blood.
The 17-year-old high school junior and a
friend had entered the Fern Rock subway sta
tion when two men approached them and
demanded the earrings. When Williams refused,
she and the friend ran.
Rebellion erupts as peace talks end
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -
Fighting between rebels and government
forces erupted around El Salvador only hours
after the close of the latest session of U.N.-
sponsored peace talks, the two sides reported
yesterday.
Despite the talks, which are to resume Nov.
3, both sides have continued to take military
action, apparently hoping to gain as much terri
tory as possible before a cease-fire locks their
positions in place.
The armed forces spokesman's office said
guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front blew up two temporary
bridges Tuesday. The guerrillas had stopped
most attacks on bridges three years ago.
