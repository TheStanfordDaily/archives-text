# Arab nations confer before negotiations
## 
### 
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria
sought commitments from other Arab
nations yesterday they would not
strike separate peace agreements with
Israel during next week's internation
al peace conference.
Israel and Palestinian representa
tives yesterday formally announced
they would attend the talks, and Israel
said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
would lead its delegation.
Shamir's decision may have led to a
major split in the government. Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy
announced he would not attend the con
ference, Israel's army radio reported.
Senior Arab officials were attending
a strategy planning session in
Damascus to coordinate their stance
during the international peace confer
ence, which opens next Wednesday in
Madrid, Spain.
Officials close to the meeting said

Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestine
Liberation Organization agreed not to
strike any separate peace deal with
Israel, such as the Camp David accords
signed by Egypt in 1979. The officials
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Egypt, which is to attend the peace
conference only as an observer and
potential mediator, plunged the Arab
world into political disarray when it
took its military might out of the equa
tion with the Camp David accords.
Yesterday's planning session by
Arab states in Damascus was dominat
ed by a U.S. proposal for most Arab
states to participate in broad regional
talks with Israel immediately after the
ceremonial opening of the conference,
the sources close to the meeting said.
The conference is expected to break
up into three sets of bilateral talks
between Israel and Syria, Israel and
Lebanon, and Israel and a joint

Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
Then the other states in the region
are supposed to join in discussions on
broader issues such as arms control,
water and energy. Many Arab states
perceive this as a move that would
automatically give Israel the status of
an equal in the region that has tried to
ostracize it.
Syria has already told Secretary of
State James Baker that it opposes con
vening such a regional conference
until Israel's "intentions" are made
clearer.
Syrian President Hafez Assad and
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed
last week that Jewish settlement build
ing, the status of Jerusalem and U.N.
resolutions calling for Israeli withdraw
al from occupied territories should be
discussed at an initial session.
Conference sources said Damascus
wanted to make acceptance of group

talks dependent on Israel's stance on
these three issues.
As Israel's last formidable foe, Syria
has a pivotal role on the Arab side.
It rejected an Israeli suggestion that
the bilateral negotiations be held in
the Middle East, rather than in Madrid
or another neutral venue. That won
the backing of the parties directly
involved in the Madrid conference.
But Saudi Arabia, which wields
influence as the financial mainstay of
many smaller Arab states including
Syria, is in favor of moving rapidly to
end Israel's isolation, the sources said.
Morocco is also in favor of a regional
conference.
The disagreement could weaken the
Arabs' position if it is not resolved
before the conference and might even
provide an opportunity for Israel to
establish relations separately with
some of the Arab states.
