NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Ex-Klansman
David Duke's bid for governor helped bring
thousands of people to voter registration
offices just before the deadline for those want
ing to cast ballots in the runoff next month.
In mostly white Jefferson Parish outside
New Orleans, black churches sent three
busloads of blacks to register, said Registrar
Sam Altobello.
"There are a lot of emotions sending people
in,"he said. "People are not worried about
getting down whether they're Democrat or
Republican, just getting the right to vote.
Everyone knows what's going on."
Tuesday was the last day people could
qualify to vote in the Nov. 16 runoff. Duke,
a state legislator running as a Republican
without official GOP backing, faces Edwin
Edwards, a populist Democrat and three
time governor.
"It suddenly became an important elec
tion for those for Duke or against him," said
Preston Ray, 44, of New Orleans. "I guess
you have to say that's one good thing he's
done for the state. Those of us who never
voted before suddenly think we should."
Jerry Eowler, Louisiana elections com
missioner, estimated that 12,000 to 15,000
new voters registered Monday and Tuesday.

"Nothing like this has ever happened in
Louisiana," he said.
About 71 percent of the state's 2.2 mil
lion voters turned out for Saturday's pri
mary, in which Edwards and Duke
emerged as the top vote-getters, squeezing
out Republican Gov. Buddy Roemer.
Before Saturday, blacks made up 27 per
cent of the registered voters.
Meanwhile, Edwards hit the campaign
trail Tuesday and reneged on a promise not
to mention that Duke is a former grand
wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. He told sup
porters at a rally that voters must never
forget Duke's past.
Duke, who greeted people lining up to
vote in Jefferson Parish, referred to
Edwards as "the liberal Democrat." Duke
has made a similar promise not to campaign
on Edwards' past, which includes an indict
ment and acquittal on corruption charges.
Many people registering Monday and
Tuesday said they came because they want
ed to vote for or against Duke.
Up to 3,000 students from mostly black
Grambling State University stood in line
outside the courthouse in Ruston, said
Student Government Association president
Alsan Bellard.
