NEW YORK (AP) - A com
puter information service
accused of condoning anti-
Semitic messages announced
yesterday it would bar items
"grossly repugnant to commu
nity standards" from its elec
tronic bulletin boards.
The Prodigy company also
asserted the most virulently
anti-Semitic message cited by
the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith never appeared on
its computer bulletin boards.
"In fact, we rejected it 15
times," senior vice president
Henry Heilbrunn said.
Heilbrunn added that the
person who tried to post the
hateful message had received it
from someone else and hoped
to expose the anti-Semitism to
other Prodigy members.
That message said, in part,
"Hitler had some valid points
too. Remove the Jews and we

will go a long ways toward
avoiding much trouble."
Heilbrunn, who had initial
ly defended the message as
part of the service's free
exchange of ideas, said yester
day he had been addressing the
wider issue and not the specific
messages the ADL cited.
The company, which said
Tuesday night that none of the
anti-Semitic notes had ap
peared on the bulletin boards,
charged yesterday that other
messages the ADL cited were
either "fragments" or "not in
context."
Messages posted on the bul
letin boards are sent through a
central computer via a phone
line from any subscriber's per
sonal computer. Once sent,
they are available to any of the
network's 1.1 million members
if they tap into that bulletin
board.
