Women must report
sexual assault and
coercion despite odds

WE SALUTE THE BRAVERY
of the young woman who
came forward last month
with the allegation that she had
been raped.
Regardless of whether a court
eventually finds that her claim is
true, the fact that she reported the
incident makes her a rare individual.
And the young woman's coura
geous action has highlighted a dis
turbing problem: The understand
ing of coercion vs. consent is
plagued by uncertainty.
Last month's was only the 11th
such allegation reported to the
Stanford Police since 1980 — even
though a 1989 survey by the Stan
ford Rape Education Project found
that one in four female undergrad
uates claims to have been coerced
or forced into having sex when she
did not want to.
In only 17 percent of those cases
did the women involved even tell
anyone of the incident, and only one
in 25 sought counseling or therapy.
These statistics illuminate some
basic problems in our society's atti
tude toward rape, and especially
date rape.
Women are reluctant to report
rapes for several reasons, accord
ing to rape counselors. Some of the
reasons include the stigma involv
ing sexual assault; the unfounded
guilt women may feel after an
attack; and the fact that many
women know their assailant and
are afraid of accusing him of rape.
But perhaps the main reason is
that many women are unsure of
the boundary between consensual
sex and rape — they do not know if
what happened to them is consid
ered rape.
The situation in the recent alleged
assault was one that many women
can identify with. A suave upper
classman and a less experienced

freshman drink alcohol together
until their judgment is impaired.
Despite the woman's protestations
that she is under 18 and a virgin, the
man has sex with her.
Is that rape? According to cur
rent rape law, it apparently isn't.
The Stanford Police pushed for a
forcible rape charge in the case,
but the district attorney — con
cerned about his ability to prove
the forcible rape charge under cur
rent rape law — decided to charge
only statutory rape, along with
furnishing alcohol to a minor.
Women who have been involved
in situations like the one in the
recent alleged assault may be dis
couraged from reporting when
they see that no forcible rape
charge was issued.
But the response of University
officials and Stanford Police in this
case should assure women their
accusation will not be treated
lightly.
Stanford Police vigorously pur
sued the case, requesting eight
charges against the defendant,
while University officials immedi
ately recognized the gravity of the
situation and began a judicial
affairs investigation.
This tragic incident, and its
press coverage, has forced the cam
pus community to examine the
issue of acquaintance rape in a
new light. Several lessons should
be learned from it.
Women should be encouraged to
come forward when they feel they
have been raped, regardless of the
circumstances. In each case, the
woman should not bear the entire
burden of proof. Too often, the vic
tim is placed on trial along with
the alleged rapist.
Men should realize that convinc
ing a woman to have sex when she
doesn't want to is never acceptable
and may justly result in criminal
charges. Women, for their part,
should learn to recognize situations
where they may be vulnerable and
defend themselves accordingly.
A tragedy should not be our only
impetus to discuss such important
issues.
