Stanford environment too sexist to encourage progress

VERY FEW WOMEN WRITE let
ters upon leaving Stanford Univer
sity. Since one employee, a doctor
in the medical complex, has done so, I
feel compelled to back her up. Sexual
harassment and disenfranchisement of
women is a way of life at Stanford.
I worked at Hansen High Energy
Physics Laboratories for five years. My
work included design and construction of
a research apparatus that became one of
the laboratory's most lucrative projects.
I wrote proposals that funded the pro
ject from the first dollar until five years
later. I wrote dozens of articles for aca
demic journals and semi-popular maga
zines. I also wrote patent descriptions,
and I assisted in analyzing results
including mathematical operations and
graphical representations.

I was still an undergraduate at anoth
er university (UC-Santa Barbara) when I
started. I saw women investing their edu
cation and professional development only
to have their work stolen by men. There
was an unspoken understanding among
the men that this was a male privilege.
Most female graduate students, post
docs and research assistants eventually
found their way to the one male leader
who had the decency to deal with them
with some semblance of fairness. One
female graduate student obviously
would not have gotten the degree she
worked for and deserved had it not been
for the national attention that followed
her selection as an astronaut.
I watched secretaries treated like slaves
and blamed for the shortcomings in commu
nication that so often plagued the physicists.

With the silences that occur with
mechanical work, I was subjected to a
constant stream of obscene propositions
and descriptions of sexual acts "we" sup
posedly might do. This came from one
physicist whose cooperation was neces
sary for my work.
By the time I left, it was a weekly
practice to have meetings among those
who worked on the project. Afterward,
I'd go back to work, and the rest of the
group (all male) would adjourn to a bar
with a pitcher of beer and make up sto
ries about sexual activities with me as
part of their fantasies.
After hearing warnings about work
ing in corporations, I found that the rule
of survival of the most ruthless applies
more to "the academic setting" than to
private, profit making enterprises.

Although lots of bright people are
attracted to Stanford, the slyest of
cronies still sit with their hands out in
their place (inside or outside Stanford)
in the money machine. The phenomenon
seems to exist in a setting where the
underwriters are the taxpayers.
I am writing because I feel the future of
science and technology and the economic
strength of this country would be served if
muscling one's way to "the top" were not
the criterion. It's not just a women's issue.
I've heard numerous, very bright men
bow out of positions in favor of a more
comfortable work environment. Maybe
women are easier to harass, but the larg
er issue of wasting our human and capi
tol resources is degenerating progress.
