# Students don't have to become vegetarians to care for animal rights
## 
### 
I am concerned about the lack of
interest and concern on this campus for
an issue that is very closely knit to Stan
ford, a major research university.
The issue is animal rights and what
concerns me is not only the fact that mil
lions of animals die each year at the hands
of humans, but the apathetic lack of inter
est and attitude of dismissal people have
when they hear the words "animal rights"
or "animal welfare." Neither of these
terms is synonymous with anti-vivisec
tion, and neither denotes radicalism.
Concern about animal rights does not
necessarily mean boycotting biomedical
research or advocating vegetarianism as
the only way of life. Instead, it means
informing people about the atrocious
things that animals endure as a part of
our society.

People must consider that due to
their incarceration, minks on fur farms
resort to self-mutilation; that rabbits'
eyes are being filled with chemicals so
we can have another shade of lipstick;
that calves are taken from their mothers
at birth and made anemic so we can eat
their white flesh and call them veal.
Atrocities are occurring, and people
must consider them and look toward
reform. What this means is not shopping
at Saks Fifth Avenue where fur coats
are sold, but choosing Nordstrom
instead. This means using VISA instead
of American Express because American
Express is an advocate for the fur indus
try.
This also means asking your grocer
(or Food Service) to purchase eggs from
free-range farms instead of factory
farms. And when purchasing cosmetics,
buy from Revlon, Avon, Mary Kay or
Clinique (companies that don't use ani
mal testing) instead of Loreal, which
uses animal tests.
The goal of the animal-rights move
ment is to halt as much suffering as pos-

sible. So the next time you hear the
words "animal rights," keep an open
mind. Gandhi once said, "The greatness
of a nation can be judged by the treat
ment of it's animals." I wonder how our
country would rate.
