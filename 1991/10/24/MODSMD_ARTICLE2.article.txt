# Staff reductions likely from latest budget cuts
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The new round of budget cuts will likely
cause significant reductions in administra
tive services — areas already hit hard by
budget "repositioning."
In particular, many vice presidents said
some form of staff reductions is likely, but
added that they hope to avoid outright layoffs.
The effects of Tuesday's deficit-reduction
targets are magnified because they come on
the heels of the $22-million "repositioning"
cutbacks that largely hit administrative ser
vices.
With the new cuts, the administrative
areas will have sliced about 25 percent from
their operating budgets since the spring of
1990.
"This is another large number on top of a
large number," said Ray Bacchetti, acting
vice president for planning and management.
In some areas, the two cuts are even larg
er. More than 30 percent will have been cut
from the budgets of Planning and Manage
ment, Human Resources, Administrative
Resources and the Legal Office.
"The only way we can reach our reduc
tion targets, which come to over 30 percent,
is to cut services," said Vice President and
General Counsel John Schwartz.
One area that will likely be reduced is
administrative staff.
"We will avoid layoffs where we can, but
I can't promise anjihing," said Vice Presi
dent for Human Resources Barbara Butter
field. "We hope to manage the staff through
normal attrition."
Most vice presidents agree that attrition
— not replacing workers when they leave or
retire — will be the preferred method of
reducing staff.
Susan SchafTer, vice president of admin

istrative resources, said the two-year period
of implementing the deficit-reduction plan
will likely allow "attrition to accomplish
staff reductions."
As part of this process, some staff may be
retrained for new positions, Butterfield
said.
Making staff more efficient will also be
an important part of most administrative
deficit-reduction plans.
"We will have to do a lot of tightening up
and find ways to improve productivity,"
Schaffer said. She said she hopes more work
can be done using computers, but a reduc
tion in services will be necessary because of
the severity of the cuts.
"We are just trying to cut things that
have the least impact on important ser
vices," Schaffer added.
Butterfield explained that administrative
services will have to be prioritized by the
"customers" — the schools and other vice
presidential areas.
"It is not possible for me to just spread
the people thinner and thinner," she said.
"We will have to look at services that are not
highly valued."
Many cuts in services will mean taking
more risks, such as in Planning and Man
agement and the Legal Office.
"We will probably take risks with things
such as equipment," Bacchetti said. "We
will try to improve our monitoring tech
niques and hope things do not wear out or
break down."
The Legal Office will likely have to make
cuts in non-litigation services, which work
to avoid litigation, Schwartz said.
As a result, we will "increase the risks of
having more litigation in the future,"
Schwartz said.
