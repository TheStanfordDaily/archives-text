# Liberal-arts programs should go if they have used research monies
##

Is Paul Biddle right?
If the University's response to the
loss in income from research overhead is
to begin cutting liberal-arts programs,
then the University must have been sup
porting these departments with surplus
research dollars. It's that simple.
One begins to wonder if the large
growth in the University
administration during the research

boom of the '80s has been pruned at all,
or whether the fat has deemed itself too
important to be trimmed.
If non-scientific academic depart
ments have really been the destination
of all those research dollars, then the
University should 'fess up and admit the
government is right. If this isn't the
case, then it's time we had a closer look
at whose pocket that money fills.
