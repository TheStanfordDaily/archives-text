## When rights become values 
### 
IMAGINE ME WRITING AN entire
column extolling the virtues of white
women's butts: small and heart
shaped and oh, so sweet. Imagine me
skewered on the White Plaza Claw by
noon Thursday.
It's an ugly little scenario, and its
impossibility barely tempers its offen
siveness.
Ex-Daily columnist Corey Davis didn't
bother with scenarios. Here are a few
lines from his column of Wednesday,
March 14, 1990:
"Black women! Your time has come.
Cosmo wants you. Glamour wants y0u....
But black people discovered long ago that big
hips and big booties were beautiful.... Not
only are big hips and big booties beautiful,
but they are necessary tools for groovin' at
Friday-night house parties.... Don't worry,
sister, your black brothers will always pay
homage to you. Power to the bootie!"
Imagine that! Imagine finding this
"Ode to Bootie" right here, in the midst
of our liberal university filled with under
graduates younger than the women's
movement which raised them.
The Daily printed three letters in
response to the "bootie" piece. Two of the
letters blasted Davis for his sexism. "We
could not help but notice [Davis'] objecti
fication of women," one said. "There is no
excuse for the sexist theme [Davis] por
trays," the other said.
The third letter was different.

An African-American woman wrote, "I
saw Davis' column not as sexist or as an
objectification of my body, but rather as a
tribute to and an empowerment of the black
woman... .We understand our own history
and view every situation from an African-
American as well as a female perspective."
This woman had no difficulty defend
ing Davis. He offered her public praise
and power and she was glad to pay the
price of a little sexual objectification. The
piece may not have been Ms. material,
but it was clear and loud and black.
Women's rights simply weren't as valu
able to her as black rights.
We talk about rights, but we are really
concerned with power. To establish rights
is to divvy up power. Yet power is not like
a pie to be cut up and handed out to
everybody. Life is more complicated than
that, and all the white feminist pie in the
world couldn't fill her stomach when she
wasn't allowed to sit at the counter.
This same question of the value and rele
vance of rights underlies the free-speech vs
harassment debates of the past few years
Campus African-Americans argue for
free speech restrictions that would pro
vide protection from verbal harassment
They do not feel that they themselves will
be harmed by these limitations.
Faced with a rising tide of public racism,
they want protection from speech, not of it.
Democratic ideals are little loved when
they empower the likes of David Duke. I'll

bet you $5 (hat minority applications to
LSU take a nasty tumble this year.
First Amendment liberals feel the pain
of verbal insults is a small price to pay for
the freedoms of unrestricted speech.
(Conservatives side with the liberals here,
until somebody mentions flag-burning, at
which point they inexplicably start to run
in circles.) Free speech is the cornerstone
of democracy, liberals argue; to chip away
at it risks destroying the whole structure.
For over 200 years, race has found
ways of humbling this country. In spite of
our victories, Americans continue to eat at
different tables, to live in different houses,
to be supported by different cornerstones.
More than any other issue, race makes
Americans question our ability to live a
democratic life. We are forced to realize
that, despite our ideals, all Americans do not
share the same rights and opportunities.
This unequal distribution of power in
America ensures that majority and
minority groups will place unequal value
no the same rights. As long as these
power inequities remain, so will the
debates over the relative values of rights.
