Cardinal 1

Bears 0

Stanford came back to form yes
t erday at California's Strawberry
Field, roasting the Weenies 1-0.
The lone goal of the game came
it 24:00 of the first half after a
Kristen Wair corner kick, when
unior Jen Potok knocked in a
loose ball to put the Cardinal
ahead for good.
Potok's third goal of the season
proved to be all the Cardinal need
ed, as sophomore keeper Leslie
Garrard regained the shutout
habit with nine saves, a career
high. The blanking was the ninth
of the season for Garrard, break
ing Elise Edwards's 1990 mark of
8.5.
The gbme was only the second
nil season that a Cardinal oppo
nent has shut out both Julie
Foudy and Sarah Rafanelli, who
have combined for 27 of the
team's 4fi goals this season.
It was also the the second time

'It wasn't a pretty game. The field conditions
did not allow for much passing, but we hung
tough and pulled out a win.'

this season that Stanford has
been out-shot in a game all sea
son, with the last such occasion
occurring in Stanford's last game,
against Santa Clara.
Fortunately, Garrard was par
ticularly sharp against Cal yes
terday afternoon. After scoring
an average of five goals a game
over the season's first eight con
tests, Stanford has only managed
six goals over the last five.
That Stanford has managed to
win four of those five games is a
testament to Garrard and the
rest of the Stanford defense, who
have allowed a miserly six shots
per game this season. Before the
Cal game, Garrard had been
called upon to make an average of
only a little over two saves a
game.
The relative barrage of shots
unleashed by the Golden Bears
were to no avail as Stanford con
tinued its season-long streak of
not relinquishing a lead.
The game was a hard-fought
contest, with a season-high 20
fouls called against the Cardinal.
Fullback Kerry Stivaletti was
given the team's first yellow card
of the year.

"It wasn't a pretty game," said
Potok. "The field conditions did
not allow for much passing, but
we hung tough and pulled out a
win."
Potok went on to mention the
questionable officiating. The offi
cials have had a problem keeping
their eyes open on the field in
Stanford games all season long, a
problem which has given coach
Berhane Andeberhan under
standable fears regarding injuries
to the team.
Fortunately, the only injuries
suffered at Strawberry Field were
to Berkeley pride, as Cal saw its
winning streak come to an end.
The Bears had won eight out of
their last nine games, outscoring
their opponents 25-4, before fac
ing the Cardinal, who was not to
be denied in its quest to regain its
winning ways.
The N0.6 Cardinal upped its
record to 12-1 while the No. 11
Bears tumbled to 9-5.
The Stanford players are leav
ing today for Texas, where they
will face both Texas Christian
University and Southern
Methodist in the TCU tourna
ment.
