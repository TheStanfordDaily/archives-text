# Reigning national champs face top netters

### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Heather Willens tends to think of
the Women's Ail-American Tennis
Tournament as her tournament. It is
played at her hometown club, the Riv
iera Country Club in Santa Monica,
and she never fails to draw a crowd
with a presence.
Last year she entered the tourney as
a wild card and proceeded to romp into
the semi-finals before being upended
by eventual champion and then-Cardi
nal teammate Sandra Birch.
"Getting a wild card and then going
to the semis, this was my best tourna
ment last year," Willens said. "It was
great because everyone comes out and
roots for me."
Willens, the tournament's eighth
seed, takes on an adversary that she
has seen a lot of during her Stanford

'I heard it's the Wimble
don of the college tennis
circuit.'

career, San Diego's Tuck Kacharoen.
"Heather has a tendency of playing
very well here," said Cardinal assis
tant coach Lele Forood.
Today, Willens, who carries a pre
season ranking of ninth in the nation,
leads three other Cardinal women's
tennis teammates, Laxmi Poruri, Kris
tine Kurth and Kylie Johnson, into the
opening round of the All-American, a
tournament pitting returning Ail-
Americans from last year against one
another and a selective group of fresh
men and wild card qualifiers.
The Cardinal has owned this tour

nament for some time. Last year Birch
beat Debbie Graham 7-5 in the third to
take the title. The year before Birch
beat teammate Meredith McGrath,
and three years ago Tami Whitlinger
beat Birch in the finals.
Willens will also pair up with
Poruri, a doubles All-American last
season with Teri Whitlinger, in what
will be their first competition. They
face the tandem of Alison Bradford
and Ruth Ann Stevens of Utah today.
"I think it will be good because we
both like the sides we play on," Poruri
said. "I like the forehand and Willy
likes the backhand. We just need to
play a lot of matches because it's a mat
ter of getting good patterns going."
As familiar to the tournament and
the environs as Willens is, Kurth,
seeded seventh, will be making her
first appearance as a Cardinal, against
Clemson's Mindy Weiner. The sopho

more transfer from William and Mary
is ranked one notch ahead of Willens
— eighth in the nation — after finish
ing her freshman year ranked 16th.
"I heard it's the Wimbledon of the
college tennis circuit," Kurth said,
"and hopefully I'll do well."
"We are waiting to see what Kris
tine can do this year," Forood said.
Jchnson, the anchor in the Cardi
nal's national championship victory
last year before a record-setting crowd
at Stanford Stadium, began playing
the qualifying rounds on Tuesday and
Wednesday, winning three matches,
including wins over Courtney Rose,
who played No. 2 at USC last year, and
Arizona's Cori Davidson, to advance to
the regular draw as a wild card. She is
rewarded by playing fourth-seed Julie
Exum of Duke.
This is the first tournament of the
year for the six-time NCAA defend
ing champions, and it should give
them some of an indication as to
where they stand in comparison to
their competition.
"We get to see where we are, how
we're playing and what adjustments
we'll need to make," said Poruri.
The Girdinal, ranked fifth in the
nation in the preseason poll, will have
a different complexion this season
after losing All-American Teri
Whitlinger and NCAA singles cham

pion Birch to graduation in addition
to Graham's decision to forego her
scholarship for her final year and turn
professional. Graham, ranked among
the top 40 women in the world, plans
to graduate in December.
"We'll be a different team without
Debbie," Forood said. "Any time you
lose a player of that caliber it clearly
affects you. She would have been the
dominant player in college this year.
"We don't have any dominating
returning players; we're kind of an
unknown quantity to ourselves and
to other teams. We don't have four or
five returning All-Americans, but
we're deep and we have a lot of out
standing players."
