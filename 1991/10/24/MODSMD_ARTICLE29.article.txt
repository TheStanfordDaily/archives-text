You would think that after the
University of the Pacific's upset
of the No. 20 Stanford Cardinal in
field hockey yesterday, the Tigers
would be ecstatic. After all, this
was UOP's first win against the
Cardinal in seven meetings, and it
was an important Northern Pacif
ic Conference win for Pacific.
"It's kind of a sad win for us,"

said one Pacific player. "We've
lost to [Stanford] twice this sea
son, but at least then we played
them tough. Today they out
played us."
The final score of the match
was 1-0, in favor of the Tigers.
But the stat sheet and the play
itself said something completely
different.
"We had more shots in this
game [21] than in any other game
this season," said Stanford coach
Sheryl Johnson. "We definitely
out-statted them."
Indeed, Stanford did play a
great game. The first half was
characterized by good passing and
agressive play on behalf of the
Cardinal. Sophomore Gina Bian
chini and senior Michele Beynet
led a forward line that was on the
ball hard and often. There was
also outstanding defense and
goalkeeping on the Cardinal's
half of the field, although little
time was spent there.
Captains Beynet and Susan
Leckrone turned several potential
Pacific drives the other way.
Stanford out-hustled Pacific to
the ball for the most part. And
when the ball did get through,

goalkeeper Kristina Vidal made
some great saves. But all in all,
the defense didn't have to worry
too much because Stanford was
keeping the ball on UOP's side of
midfield.
However, Pacific was also play
ing good, agressive defense, and
the Cardinal failed to take advan
tage of several scoring opportuni
ties. The Tigers simply refused,
by sheer will almost, to let any
thing go into their goal. Halftime
was whistled with the score tied
0-0.
The second half was more of
the same. Stanford once again
played outstanding defense, and
once again made some haaaaard
shots on goal, but once again
came up short. They simply could
not get the ball in the goal.
Everything was even until,
with three minutes left in the
game, disaster struck. A slight
defensive breakdown led to a
Pacific breakaway at midfield,
and Pacific would not let the long
awaited opportunity slip by.
When Tiger Phyllis Rogers got
inside the goal's circle, Vidal
charged and knocked the ball
away, but Rogers put the stray
ball into the keeperless goal.
But if the Stanford squad was
terribly upset after the game,
they needn't have been. They
knew as well as any Pacific player
that they had played well. And it's
far easier for one game to be a
fluke than a whole season.
"[This loss] shouldn't matter
too much," said Johnson. "It was
a great game intensity-wise,
which is good for us. I'm pleased.
We're still progressing."
That is good, because the post
season is approaching rapidly,
and Stanford will need to play as
well and as intensely as they did
yesterday — and more — when
they face the caliber of teams they
are sure to meet. But coach John
son is confident.
