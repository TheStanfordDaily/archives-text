# Securing copyrights will increase course readers' cost
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
In response to a copyright infringe
ment suit initiated by a group of eight
publishers two years ago, Kinko's Graph
ics Corporation agreed last week to seek
permission for the use of copyrighted
materials in course readers.
Students may see the change in the
form of higher prices for course readers
because price tags will include the cost of
the royalties that Kinko's and other copy
shops now have to pay.

But prices at the Stanford Bookstore will
not be affected, according to Dan Archer,
custom materials manager at the Bookstore.
He said the Bookstore's long-standing
policy has been to seek publisher's per
mission and pay royalties when putting
together course readers.
The settlement comes after a federal
court found Kinko's guilty of copyright
infringement last March. Additionally,
Kinko's will pay $1.87 million in damages
and court fees as part of the agreement.
In exchange, the group of publishers will
not sue Kinko's for unauthorized copies

made prior to the ruling in March.
Kurt Koenig, vice-president of Kinko's
Service Corporation, said his company
will be making a lot of changes. Kinko's
will now contact publishers and pay roy
alties in much the same manner as the
Bookstore has been doing.
"If there are royalties," Koenig said "the
cost will be added to the reader. Royalty
costs can range from $.20 to $.50 per page,
so if you're adding that on to a $.05 copying
fee, that's an astronomical increase."
High royalties such as these aren't always
the norm, Koenig added. He said professors

are starting to make alternative selections
when they learn of high royalty costs.
The Kinko's copy shops around Stan
ford are no longer making course readers,
according to Koenig. He cited the dis
tance of these copy shops from the Uni
versity as the reason for the discontinua
tion of the service.
But he said that other copy shops clos
er to the University still are making read
ers, and are adjusting their procedures in
response to the Kinko's case.
Archer said that the prices of the
Bookstore's readers will probably now

become competitive with those of copy
shops outside Stanford.
"It depends on whether or not other
copy shops heed the warning and clear
copyrights," he said.
Archer also said that under the new
regulations, faculty members who order
readers that violate copyright laws can be
sued for copyright infringement even if
they were not involved in the process of
making the reader.
"The industry is changing," Archer
said. "And we have to accommodate it.
The issue is far from over."
