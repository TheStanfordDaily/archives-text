# Nat knows budget cuts
## 
### 
The athletic department was not spared by
the $43 million budget axe that fell Tuesday. A
$700,000 reduction is scheduled for the
department, which is primarily self-supported
by ticket sales and alumni donations. Luckily,
there is plenty of corpulence to cut.
Athletic Director Ted Leland has a Ph.D.
(albeit in psychology), so he's probably got his
own ideas on how to balance the books. Invit
ed or not, here are a few suggestions on bal
ancing the athletic department budget:

•Get rid of Flagboy. (the guy who perpetu
ally runs around Stanford Stadium, waving a
huge Stanford banner). Is this a Pied Piper
trick to get the cheerleaders to follow him? A
research project on stadium wind currents? Or
just a dorky "tradition" that is losing its juve
nile charm?
Nothing personal, Flagboy, but jump back
in the stands, sell the flag, and transfer the
proceeds to the general fund.
•Corporate sponsorships. I know it is uneth
ical, but there is a lot of money to be made off
beer companies, and it is for a good cause.
With just a little twist, we could have the
Leland Stanford .Junior University Budweiser
Marching Band be truly incomparable and the
king of beers, too. Director Arthur Barnes
could be the new Bud Man.
•Stanford Gladiators. The half-time Sun
dance football toss is a swell idea — throw the
ball through a hole and win a big prize — but
it needs some pizazz to rake in the big bucks.
Give contestants a helmet and pads and line
them up on the 35-yard line with three foot
balls. Then place Ron George and Dave Gar
nett at the 25 and have them try to decapitate
the contestant before they can get their
throws off. This is entertainment, so late hits
are allowed.
If the contestant gets the ball past Vaughn
Bryant (not tough lately), he or she gets to
play special teams for Stanford in the second
half. Losers get scraped off the turf and
deposited back in the stands with a certificate
for a free frozen yogurt. I'd pay five dollars to
see some ASSU Senators get cleat marks in
their backs.
•Trade half our quarterbacks. Maybe we
could afford eight quarterbacks when the gov
ernment was buying us boats, shower curtains
and rose-scented sheets, but in these leaner
times, four will have to do.
A school like Oregon State, whose quarter
back Mark Olford completed zero passes for
zero yards last week against UCLA, would pay
a lot for one of our high school All-Americans.
Maybe we could trade them John Lynch for a
medieval history professor, a CIV lecturer and
an English tutor to be named later. I bet if we
packaged Justin Armour and Jason Palumbis
we could even pry away a president from an
East Coast Ivy.
