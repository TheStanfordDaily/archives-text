# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Misogyny: talk on a cereal box 
### 
IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT, and I was single. Single and
free. And now I finally had the time to do all those things.
You know, man things.
I had allowed weeks to pass since I had done a decent job
cleaning my Norelco — I mean getting in there with the little
brush thing and really getting tactile with my facial hair. And
there were primal screams to perform and bongo drums to
play and poems about nocturnal emissions to recite. My cod-

piece had been in the closet for far too long.
Women. I didn't need women. Women were for the weak.
The only thing women were good for was selling beer and
reminding you how fortunate you were to be able to urinate
standing up.
So I was going to stay in my dorm room that night and
jump right into this Robert Bly thing double handed, if you
know what I mean.
But a knock on my door quickly interrupted my Jack
Palance/paint-gun fantasy. My friends — my man friends —
told me I was going out with them. They didn't ask; they told
me. That's how men are.
Before I had a chance to object or even place a pinch of
Skoal between my cheek and gum, I found myself in a car with
four better-dressed, post-pubescent males. And one of them —
I'm still not sure exactly which one — was wearing cologne.
I knew this wasn't going to be good.
As we rounded the corner and started to slow up, I pressed
my face up against the glass of the backseat window, like a
dog whose Seville-like experiences led him to be paranoid of
the realm outside the automobile.
And there it was, right before my eyes. It was my worst
nightmare. My greatest fear. My most intense succubus.
Even worse than the one about the four women who tie me to
a bed and read me Sappho poems in the wrong order.
We were at the 42nd Street Bar and Breeding Ground,
located in beautiful downtown Palo Alto.
I refused to get out. They left me in the car. And like that
same dumb, but well-instincted dog, I got out and followed
them.
Walking toward the building, I realized I had become my
most dreaded '70s alter-ego. I was going, on my own volition,
to a place named after one of the most disgusting streets in
New York City. I felt like that Larry guy who lived upstairs
from Jack and Chrissy.
I was at a singles bar.
Tone-Loc blasted out of the speakers. People danced on a
little pseudo-dance floor next to the bar, pretending the song
was still as good as it once was. And they were doing that
annoying white dance thing where you disinterestedly jog in
place in front of your partner and look from side to side,
avoiding eye contact at all costs.
The women traveled around the bar in packs, wearing labi
al skirts and makeup that was too Tim Burton for anyone this
side of Mumenschanz. It was like a frat party for 30-year-olds
with bad skin. Only they charged for beer, and no one kept
walking up to me and saying, "You know, we really don't have
a viewing room."
I sat down at a table on the more upscale, second level of
the bar and watched people involuntarily twitch to the con
fused erotica summoned by an effeminate, middle-aged man
repeating the words: "Bang, bang on the drums, baby."

The Tao to Nowhere

I needed to go home and unbottle
my emotions by withholding my
name and address from a Pent
house Forum letter or else I'd
find myself doing something
stupid like asking some woman if
I hadn't run into her at a conven
tion in Fort Lee.
So I told my friends I was leav
ing — that I was going to go to
Heidi's and get some frogen
yozurt, as she likes to call it.
Then they said exactly what I
both expected and feared they
would say: "Soon as I finish this
beer."
So I sat there and made up
names for the hundreds of people
around me, who were responsible
for raising the room temperature
to levels higher than Dr. Art
Ulene would recommend. Let's
see, there was "Zero-Gravity-
Hair Woman," "Unbalanced-
Liposuction Chick," "Stacks from
B.J. and the Bear 30 years later" .

But the more I looked around,
the more I came to appreciate
that these people were making an
effort to try and meet each other,
to break out of the loneliness and

emptiness. And even though their
mating rituals were bizarre by
any non-Jersey standard, there
was something truly admirable
about their willingness to put
themselves on the line, to make a
real effort.
Almost every woman there had
invested a lot of her hard-earned
cash in Aqua Net and elastic
clothing imported all the way
from New Jersey. And the men
were all willing to remain in their
generic Tom Brokaw-meets-
C&R-Clothier outfits.
They were willing to pay $2.50
for a beer and laugh at jokes that
weren't funny just for the chance
to resolve their loneliness, to
merge with someone else. And no
matter how pathetic they looked,
there was something poetic,
something truly human about it.
But it didn't stop me from get
ting the hell out of there and tak
ing a long shower with that Lava
soap stuff.
To strive for perfection is to
strive for death.
Whatever.

Joel Stein wonders why Canadi
ans have to pay so much more for
books and magazines. His col
umn appears here biweekly; oth
erwise Chris Harris will take his
milk money.

names for the hundreds of people
around me, who were responsible

the more I came to appreciate
that these people were making an

about their willingness to put
themselves on the line, to make a
real effort.

They were willing to pay $2.50
for a beer and laugh at jokes that
weren't funny just for the chance
to resolve their loneliness, to
merge with someone else. And no

there was something poetic,
something truly human about it.

IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT, and I was single. Single and
free. And now I finally had the time to do all those things.
You know, man things.
I had allowed weeks to pass since I had done a decent job
cleaning my Norelco — I mean getting in there with the little
brush thing and really getting tactile with my facial hair. And
there were primal screams to perform and bongo drums to
play and poems about nocturnal emissions to recite. My cod-

piece had been in the closet for far too long.
Women. I didn't need women. Women were for the weak.
The only thing women were good for was selling beer and
reminding you how fortunate you were to be able to urinate
standing up.
So I was going to stay in my dorm room that night and
jump right into this Robert Bly thing double handed, if you
know what I mean.
But a knock on my door quickly interrupted my Jack
Palance/paint-gun fantasy. My friends — my man friends —
told me I was going out with them. They didn't ask; they told
me. That's how men are.
Before I had a chance to object or even place a pinch of
Skoal between my cheek and gum, I found myself in a car with
four better-dressed, post-pubescent males. And one of them —
I'm still not sure exactly which one — was wearing cologne.
I knew this wasn't going to be good.
As we rounded the corner and started to slow up, I pressed
my face up against the glass of the backseat window, like a
dog whose Seville-like experiences led him to be paranoid of
the realm outside the automobile.
And there it was, right before my eyes. It was my worst
nightmare. My greatest fear. My most intense succubus.
Even worse than the one about the four women who tie me to
a bed and read me Sappho poems in the wrong order.
We were at the 42nd Street Bar and Breeding Ground,
located in beautiful downtown Palo Alto.
I refused to get out. They left me in the car. And like that
same dumb, but well-instincted dog, I got out and followed
them.
Walking toward the building, I realized I had become my
most dreaded '70s alter-ego. I was going, on my own volition,
to a place named after one of the most disgusting streets in
New York City. I felt like that Larry guy who lived upstairs
from Jack and Chrissy.
I was at a singles bar.
Tone-Loc blasted out of the speakers. People danced on a
little pseudo-dance floor next to the bar, pretending the song
was still as good as it once was. And they were doing that
annoying white dance thing where you disinterestedly jog in
place in front of your partner and look from side to side,
avoiding eye contact at all costs.
The women traveled around the bar in packs, wearing labi
al skirts and makeup that was too Tim Burton for anyone this
side of Mumenschanz. It was like a frat party for 30-year-olds
with bad skin. Only they charged for beer, and no one kept
walking up to me and saying, "You know, we really don't have
a viewing room."
I sat down at a table on the more upscale, second level of
the bar and watched people involuntarily twitch to the con
fused erotica summoned by an effeminate, middle-aged man
repeating the words: "Bang, bang on the drums, baby."

The Tao to Nowhere

I needed to go home and unbottle
my emotions by withholding my
name and address from a Pent
house Forum letter or else I'd
find myself doing something
stupid like asking some woman if
I hadn't run into her at a conven
tion in Fort Lee.
So I told my friends I was leav
ing — that I was going to go to
Heidi's and get some frogen
yozurt, as she likes to call it.
Then they said exactly what I
both expected and feared they
would say: "Soon as I finish this
beer."
So I sat there and made up
names for the hundreds of people
around me, who were responsible
for raising the room temperature
to levels higher than Dr. Art
Ulene would recommend. Let's
see, there was "Zero-Gravity-
Hair Woman," "Unbalanced-
Liposuction Chick," "Stacks from
B.J. and the Bear 30 years later" .
