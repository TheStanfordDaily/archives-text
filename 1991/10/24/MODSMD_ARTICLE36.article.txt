# Food Service dining guide
## 
### Michael Green Josh Walker 
WE'RE DONE. WE'RE FULL,
but we're done. Here's what
we did: We ventured
through just about every
dining hall on campus, sam
pling the various culinary
masterpieces. It was kind of a mixed bless
ing — getting to eat all food service has to
offer for free.
Look at the sacrifices we made for all you
potential connoisseurs of the vast array of
exquisite dining options available at this
superb, non-Gothicly constructed institu
tion fondly known as the Farm (though nei
ther of us has yet heard any domestic ani
mal noises).
Admittedly, the whole experience wasn't
too bad. It's almost a mandatory tradition
to rank on your school's food, but we'll try
to stay off the stale humor.
Figure it this way: We are both from
Wilbur, so everything else was a step up. We
found that in general Food Service has its
strong and weak points, and if all else fails
there's always imitation Baco Bit salads to
keep you going.

Head chef Saul Cardenas prides himself on his meaty fried chicken, juicy corn on the cob and salacious peanut butter bars as he serves
them up to grateful Wilbur residents.
Branner

Bonuses include fresh Branner Bread
in a wide variety of phallic shapes and
sizes, a nifty chalkboard menu that is
way more personable than cold computer
print outs, big salad bowls and the
patronizing stare of John Branner
reminding you to finish all of your veg
etables. The surroundings are pleasant
and blue and chock full o' that Branner
spunk that gets really annoying when
you're trying to eat.
Our lunch menu consisted of taco
medley (how musical), barbecue [sauce
drenchedj chicken, Spanish Rice and a
turkey sandwich. Apparently Flipper, or
something about a dolphin, had been
served the previous night.
Shiny, happy Brannerite Cris Niell
remarked, "The food is the one drawback
to the best dorm on campus." We don't
make up the quotes. We just report them.
If you do happen to mosey there for a
meal, be sure to top it off with our per
sonal favorite Branner specialty: Astro
pops. Not just your normal run-of-the
mill popsicle mind you, but an "Artificial
ly flavored, pineapple-and-cherry, quies
cently frozen confection — Artificial
color added." (Actual quote from wrap
per.)
Suggested attire: Any Stanford para
phernalia. "Class of '95" T-shirt request
ed.

Columbae

Representative of the self-operative
houses, Columbae is not affiliated with
food service. These all-vegetarian meals
are cooked by the residents themselves
on a rotational basis. Here, you're forced
to learn how to cook. Fast and well.
The atmosphere surrounding the Thai
curry vegetables and assorted rice was as
loose as possible. Everyone congregates
outside on the steps. No tables. No
chairs. You don't need them here. We'd
suggest eating here at least once, just for
the experience. Dinner only.
Suggested attire: Birkenstocks or bare
feet. Jacket and tie-dye requested.

Flo Mo

All right. We didn't really eat here. We
stopped by after eating at Lagunita, but
the menu was the same — so we don't
feel guilty, and how much can we eat any
way?
Creative soup ideas such as vegetarian
vegetable (duh) soup and sausage gumbo
made for fun and frolic amid our nerd
laugh impressions and SLE serenading.
A definite bonus was the ice cream bar,
which showcased chocolate chip, coffee
and fluorescent pink stuff. Additionally,
small subdivisions elicit greater intimacy.
Perfect setting for "quasi-dates" or oth
erwise.
Suggested attire: Thick glasses and
pocket protector.

Kimball

Welcome to Kimball. Please wait to be
seated. The Tavern on the Green of Palo
Alto. Eating at Kimball kind of makes
you say "Mom who?" The choices here
are limitless, although we did manage to
sample the eggplant Parmesan, burger

basket, assorted fresh bagels, curly fries,
Jello and fro yo.
While we were gasping in awe at the
wooden tables and automatic rotating
tray collector, the whole Madera dorm
showed up. Clean and buffed, donning
jackets, ties and dresses, the all-fresh
man dormitory decided to go out for din
ner ... at Kimball. The procession was a
laudable attempt at reminding the planet
that Wilbur sucks.
"It was designed for an a la carte sys
tem, and it works beautifully," said Kim
ball-Branner manager Libby Long,
regarding the spacious and aesthetically
divine design of the cafeteria. Despite any
arguments based on dorm nationalism,
Kimball kicks everyone's butt by a land
slide. Pray for a good draw number.
Suggested attire: Black tie.

Kosher Co-Op

Great place for reminding yourself
what home-cooked meals are like. We
especially suggest the Friday night,
Shabbat dinners for Jews and non-Jews
alike, which entail matzo-ball soup,
gefilte fish and baked chicken. The atmo
sphere is warm and encouraging. Leave
the Baco Bits at home.
Suggested attire: Tallit and yarmulke.

Lag

Nice atmosphere, but no ice. Chande
liers and high ceiling, but warm Cherry
Coke.

Macaroni and
cheese in abundance
made for a great
complement to pas
trami sandwiches
and corn pops
(indigenous only to
Lag). This place wins
the Most Creative
Award for the veg
etable layer cake.
This vegetable side
dish consisted of lay
ers of whipped
spinach, carrot and
cauliflower, pleasant
ly adorned with a
cherry on top. No
joke.
Big, huge salad
bowls were a plus,
downplayed only
by the fogged-up
sneeze guard and
the fact that there
were no Baco
Bits. Neverthe-

less, this is the only place on campus with
a working Fondue set.
Suggested attire: Socks and hat
requested.

Ricker

Lemon
chicken, rice pilaf, braised catfish,
mashed potatoes and mandatory fro
yo. Meals here are as good as any
where, and the presentation and
choices available more than make up
for the limited space in the serving
areas.
"Weighing your salad is just a bit
anal," said Ricker's own Michael
Burstein, in reference to the point
system's necessity to keep a tab on

your Italian
dressing con
sumption.
Humor
abounds on
the sugges
tion board.
Who is this
wise - a s s
"Bill" any
way?
Food
fights and
indoor frisbee
tosses are
made more
enticing by
the two-story
dining facility.
Might bungee
jumping
work? S u g -
gested attire:
Nikes and
Saran Wrap.

Roble

In addition to the standard Food Ser
vice meals — which this particular
evening entailed beef stroganoff, noodles,
chicken nuggets and chile casserole —
Roble is equipped with a Make-Your-Own
(MYO ... so that's what it stands for!)
bar whose only drawback is that you
might burn yourself. MYO omelets and
fried rice would easily make up for any
deficient meals provided that day.
This facility is easily the best of the all
you-can-eat meal plan places we tested;

however, points can be used. But you
should really save them for Kimball.
Suggested attire: Oven mitts.

Stern

New, and improved and on points.
Everyone seems to like it better this way,
especially 15-year manager Virginia
Varkony, a.k.a., the woman of many
toasters, who insightfully said, "Students
are happier this way, and it makes my job
a lot easier."
Chicken fajitas, a double cheeseburger,
grilled cube steak, true cod (quite philo
sophical) with soy ginger sauce and cute
onion adornment and chocolate-vanilla
swirl frozen yogurt were all available. With
the exception of the overabundance of bell
peppers in the fajitas and the bizarre
coconut aftershock to the chocolate fro yo,
we found the experience delightful.
Whether it was the murals depicting
scantly-clad women and well-defined
men, the real chocolate chips, the grilled
burgers to order, the bustle of the birth
day boy being carried to his traditional
birthday shower or the free IBC Root
Beer that we stocked up on, we found
Stern to be one of the best Food Service
has to offer.
Suggested attire: Shirt, shoes and
BVDs required.

Toyon

Many are confused as to how this whole
"eating club" thing works. So were we, but we
had it clarified to us by perhaps the coolest
cook on the planet, Ray Bean of El Toro Eat
ing Club.
Through the mist of steam coming off of

his eggplant tomato sauce, Ray, "the philo
sophical gourmet," explained that in the first
few weeks of school the inhabitants of Toyon
choose one of the many different eating clubs.
There they will eat, watch movies and congre
gate for the whole year. Each kitchen has its
own cooks for meals and is available for per
sonal use 24 hours a day, which is a major
bonus.
Ray professed a desire to provide an assort
ment for the diners at El Toro and hence, pre
pared several different pastas and a wide array
of vegetarian and meat sauces, 'llie bread
rivalled Branner's.
The prevailing attitude was very person-

able, but the
actual selection
was limited.
Sorry, Ray.
Suggesed attire:
Robe and slip
pers.
Wilbur

Dining for only the most daring of
souls. Our home-away-from-home
which-makes-us-wish-we-were-home.
Why waste your money on foreign food
served at a restaurant when you have it
right here on campus?
Glorious entrees included barbecued

'Weighing your salad is
just a bit anal," said Flick
er's own Michael Burstein,
in reference to the point
system's necessity to
keep a tab on your Italian
dressing consumption.
Humor abounds on the
suggestion board. Who is
this wise-ass "Bill" any
way?

pork chops and chicken taragon. A rather
innocent sounding meal for this place. Be
safe. Stick with the Baco Bits salad motif.
For dessert we feasted upon a couple
pieces of lemon cake crumpled up in a
glass of milk. Wilbur dining forces you to
be creative and use all that brain-stuff
that supposedly got you into this place.
Atmosphere in the Cedro and Arroyo
section is adorned with paper murals of
the Statue of Liberty, which makes for
that warm immigrant feeling as you mull
over your Rice Krunchins.
Eating here with Kimball just across
the street is kind of like being asked
"Can't we just be friends?" You can look
all you want, but none of the goodies. The
soda's good though. No pubic hairs here.
Suggested attire: Turns, Pepto and
contact lenses.
We'd like to thank all of the managers
and hashers who let us bother them and
eat for free. In all honesty, as far as din
ing goes, we all could have done worse.
The Food Service people work their butts
off so we can have something to bitch
about besides CIV. So hug a hasher
today.

Bonding — as demonstrated by sophomores Jeff Bowman, Ryan Wiser, Jim Lin, Alan Pao and David Schnabel — is as much
a part of the food service experience as nutrition.
