# Food Service dining guide

### Michael Green Josh Walker 
WE'RE DONE. WE'RE FULL,
but we're done. Here's what
we did: We ventured
through just about every
dining hall on campus, sam
pling the various culinary
masterpieces. It was kind of a mixed bless
ing â€” getting to eat all food service has to
offer for free.
Look at the sacrifices we made for all you
potential connoisseurs of the vast array of
exquisite dining options available at this
superb, non-Gothicly constructed institu
tion fondly known as the Farm (though nei
ther of us has yet heard any domestic ani
mal noises).
Admittedly, the whole experience wasn't
too bad. It's almost a mandatory tradition
to rank on your school's food, but we'll try
to stay off the stale humor.
Figure it this way: We are both from
Wilbur, so everything else was a step up. We
found that in general Food Service has its
strong and weak points, and if all else fails
there's always imitation Baco Bit salads to
keep you going.

Head chef Saul Cardenas prides himself on his meaty fried chicken, juicy corn on the cob and salacious peanut butter bars as he serves
them up to grateful Wilbur residents.
