## Michelle Pfieffer as an average broad? 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Garry Marshall, the director
of "Pretty Woman," has come out
with yet another love-conquers
all film, "Frankie and Johnny."
Michelle Pfeiffer and A 1 Pacino
star as two lonely souls burned
by love, who find each other in
cold, impersonal New York City.
But Marshall is not known for
being able to go easy on the
syrup, and his difficulty in han
dling Terrence McNally's well
written script is evident. What
should have been a thoughtful
and moving picture of two people
working through the difficult
beginning stages of a relation
ship is instead an uneven movie
highlighted by sparks of bril
liance.
Like most films of this genre,
there's not much plot. Johnny, a
short-order cook, spends the film
trying to convince Frankie, a
waitress, that they were meant to
be together — and you can prob
ably guess how it ends.
Although Pfeiffer can't hide
her sparkling blue eyes and to
die-for cheekbones, she manages
to fully express the fear and pain
of Frankie, a ordinary woman
who is tired of being alone but is
frightened by the idea of opening
up her soul.
Likewise, Pacino brings a
warmness to his role as Johnny,
the stereotypical diamond in the
rough, an ex-con who plays hand
ball, reads Shakespeare and
teaches himself a new word while
shaving every morning.
Still, it's hard to get worked up
about these two characters
because nothing seems to be
wrong with the idea of them get
ting together. The only obstacle
to their love is Frankie's hesitan

cy, and with Johnny's forceful
personality; it's only a matter of
time before she breaks down.
Without romantic tension,
what's the point of telling a love
story?
McNally's script, adapted
from his smash Off-Broadway
play "Frankie and Johnny in the
Clair de Lune," thankfully avoids
the pitfalls of trying to directly
translate a very textual play to
film. Still, little of his deep, reso
nant language survives the move
to a visual medium, and much of
the pathos found in the play is
lost because Marshall plays up
the comedic elements meant to
serve as bittersweet ironic
moments.
Comparisons between the play
and the movie are, however,
unfair. McNally has created an
entirely different sort of story
with "Frankie and Johnny," one
that manages to support Pfeiffer
in the role originated on stage by
Kathy Bates of "Misery."
The play exists in the isolated
environment of Frankie's apart
ment, and part of its impact is
how the love relationship form
ing there clashes with the only
spoken-about outside world.
The movie breaks out of the
apartment and shows us the
fears and pressures the couple
face in their day-to-day lives. The
audience has a better view of
where these two personalities
came from but loses the personal
touch of having them relate their
stories in their own voices.
It is up to the director in this
case to fill in that blank by teas
ing out the souls of the charac
ters. Regrettably, the man who
gave us Richard Gere as a corpo
rate raider/white knight is not
the man who should have direct
ed this film.
