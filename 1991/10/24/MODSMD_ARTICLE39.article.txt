# Grittier, Idahoier look at Shakespeare

### Mike Curry 
"My Own Private Idaho" . . .
just another film about a young,
male, homosexual, narcoleptic
prostitute.
Yeah, right.
Director Gus Van Sant's
slightly bizarre film is difficult
to categorize. In one sense, it is a
road film like "Thelma and
Louise." In another sense,
"Idaho" is a modern but twisted
version of Shakespeare's Henry
IV.
But whichever way you look
at it, "My Own Private Idaho" is
an insightful look into the world
of male prostitution, with an
excellent performance by River
Phoenix.
Phoenix is very believable as
Mike Waters — a confused, nar
coleptic and homosexual male
prostitute. He most certainly
deserves the Best Actor Award
the 1991 Venice film festival
bestowed upon.
Waters is a prisoner to his
narcolepsy, which thrusts him
into a deep stupor each time he
experiences extreme stress.
Phoenix's realistic portrayal of
Mike's twitching and paralyzing
affliction is the type of educa
tional performance that Dustin
Hoffman displayed in "Rain
Man."
In several especially com
pelling scenes, Phoenix also
poignantly demonstrates Mike's
love and jealousy for the hetero
sexual Scott, his desire to find
his mother and his yearning for
a "normal life."
Unlike Phoenix's perfor
mance, Keanu Reeves' perfor
mance as Scott Favor — a "Joy
boy" model and male prostitute
— is not as strong. Although he
attempts to portray the impu
dent and rebellious son of Port
land's fictitious mayor Jack
Favor, Reeves veers little from
his "Excellent dude!" Ted per
sona. Scott's character and his

motivations for rebelling against
his father are underdeveloped, a
significant weakness in the film.
Replacing Shakespeare's Pri
nce Hal and Falstaff are Scott
and his fat, homosexual mentor,
Bob Pigeon. In arguably effec
tive scenes, Scott and Bob butch
er lines to Shakespeare's histo
ry, spicing them with swear
words and references to vials of
coke.
Admittedly, "Idaho" is not a
film for every Joe six-pack.
Containing unconventional

Shakespearean dialogues,
strange still-shot sex scenes
and kinky episodes in which
one of Mike's customers eroti
cally strokes a motorcycle and
sings with a lampshade, Van
Sant's unusual film requires an
open cerebrum. At times, it
may cause you to shift in your
seat a little, and it will definite
ly widen a few eyes.
But to his credit, Van Sant's
uncommon context for the film
— the underworld of male pros
titution — is refreshing and edu

cational. He even intersperses a
few docu-drama vignettes in
which young male prostitutes
spin yarns about their clients.
Because of the critical success
of his last film, "Drugstore Cow
boy," Van Sant was given the
artistic freedom to make his
next film as original and as out
landish as he wanted it to be.
With "Idaho" he does exactly
that.
