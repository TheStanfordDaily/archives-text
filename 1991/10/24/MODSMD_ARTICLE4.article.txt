# Hoover scholars advise Russian govt. officials

Anaiyzing a 300-page tax-law proposal
isn't easy in a country that hasn't had an
explicit system of taxes for 74 years. But
several Hoover Institution fellows have
been doing exactly that at the request of
prominent Soviet economists.
The project is one example of Hoover's
increasing role in advising leaders of the

Russian Republic on economic policy. Since
March, when Hoover scholars visited the
Soviet Union to offer Russian President
Boris Yeltsin policy advice, several other
members of the Russian government have
also sought help.
The chair of the Committee on Budget
and Taxes of the Russian Parliament, recog
nizing the quality of Hoover's past advice on
reform, requested the Institution's sugges
tions on the Republic's proposed tax laws.
"It's all a chain of unrelated accidents,"
said Mikhail Bernstam, a native of Leningrad
and a senior fellow at Hoover, of the Institu
tion's relationship with Russian officials.
It all began with Gorbachev's June 1990
visit to Stanford. Gorbachev had planned to
tour the Hoover archives to examine its world
renowned collection of Soviet documents.
When Bernstam heard about that possi
bility, he and five other Hoover fellows
drafted a journal of policy suggestions.
Although Gorbachev decided not to stop at
Hoover, the journal was presented to Gor
bachev's advisers.
The papers examined specific aspects of
economic reforms such as money and bank
ing, taxes and fiscal policy, labor and wages,
housing and agriculture, privatization and
general reform strategies.
Although Gorbachev apparently ignored
the journal, it did have an impact. Bernstam
translated it into Russian and several copies
were circulated in the Soviet Union.
Through those copies, Yeltsin and his advis
ers learned about Hoover's work.
Impressed by what they read, they invit
ed a delegation of Hoover fellows to visit the
Soviet Union in early March. A second dele-
gation was invited in May. Rus
sian officials also visited Hoover
several times.
Bernstam estimated that 20
million copies of the Hoover-pro
duced materials have been circu
lated in the Soviet Union.
Hoover's technical help
Hoover scholars emphasized
their advisory role in the process
— the Institution does not make
the actual decisions. "We are con
sultants to them," said senior fel
low Annelise Anderson. "We are
not telling them what to do."
Anderson added that the
advice is not intended to repre
sent Hoover's views as an institu
tion; it is simply the opinions of
individual scholars. "We each
express our own views," she said.
"Hoover does not [take] any posi
tion."
Hoover Director John Raisian
said the advice is not political.
"We are not trying to influence
the course of history in the sense
of a political solution," he said.
"We are trying to offer technical
advice so that things can go as the
republics wish for them to
evolve."
Hoover's advice on the pro
posed tax laws skirted the politi
cal issues, according to Raisian.
"Our activity has been limited to
economics," he said. "The tech
nology of gathering taxes is what
we work on — we don't address
how that money is then allocated
to the republic versus the central
system, because that is a political
question."
Bernstam said Hoover schol
ars, when thev make recommen-

dations, are careful to sidestep the
political aspects of issues.
"We are trying to avoid any
issues that involve political deci
sions — even issues such as
whether republics should have
their own currency or whether
there should be a union curren
cy," Bernstam said. "We never
speak on these issues, because
these are basically more political
than economic."
Raisian said Hoover is not
"picking a horse" in Soviet poli
tics by advising Yeltsin. He said
Hoover is not opposed to Gor
bachev. "We are not trying to dis
criminate as to who we are
involved with," Raisian said.
"People tried to raise that as a
question before the good relations
between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gor
bachev were established. The idea
was that we were helping Yeltsin;
therefore, we were against Gor
bachev."
Raisian noted that Hoover
attempted to advise Gorbachev
first, by creating the journal for
his Stanford visit.
Besides trying to avoid political
situations, Hoover is only inter
ested in participating where it is
invited, Raisian said.
"That's very important," he
said. "They have to decide for
themselves what is in their best
interest."
Bernstam noted that "in most
of the cases, the invitation came
from the Russian side."

"It is members of the Russian
government who approach us, but
they usually approach us when
they already know what we are
doing," he said. "We don't go
uninvited. We don't press our
ideas on anyone."
Bernstam said Hoover puts "all
our cards on the table" because "it
is the Russian people who will
have to live by these reforms."
'Uncertainty' after coup
As a result of the August coup
attempt in the Soviet Union, the
specific role of the Hoover advis
ers is now less clear.
"Things are very fluid right
now," Raisian said. "It i§ a period
of uncertainty. One reason is that
there is now a president of the
Russian republic, which never
had an executive branch of gov
ernment."
"It's not easy for us to tell what
the game plan is because the game
plan is changing on a day-to-day
basis," Raisian added.
The prospects of extending
relations to the central Soviet
government have been complicat
ed by the coup, Bernstam said.
"The central government, at the
moment, does not exist," he said.
Raisian agreed, saying the
Soviet central government is
overwhelmed establishing its own
political workings. "They don't
have any time to deal with outside
advice on economic reform. Eco
nomic reform is a way to help

them get things under control,
but there's just no way they can
absorb everything that needs to
be done from outsiders."
But Bernstam predicted that
another delegation of Hoover offi
cials will be going to the Russian
republic soon.
He said the idea behind the
shifting of the Soviet Union from
one economic system to another is
such a new field of economics that
a theory does not yet exist.
As such, Bernstam emphasized
that ideas can only be tested in
the field by trial and error. "One
should not tell people that if you
do this and this that three years
from now you will be better off,
because one simply does not
know,"he said.
"People should get better
marginally and consistently, oth
erwise we should stop. It is very
easy to make people worse off. We
don't have a science about this.
This is a unique opportunity for
us, as economists, to test the
strength of our ideas."
However, in implementing
such policies, "One should not
exaggerate the view of Western
advisors. It is the people (in Rus
sia) who hold different views and
then they seek like-minded people
here," Bernstam explained.
He described a past example
where Evgenii Saburov, the min
ister of economics of the Russian
government, the top Russian gov
ernment official in charge of eco
nomic reform in the executive
branch, developed his own pro
gram similar to Hoover's but
without their help.
He asked Hoover to evaluate it
about three months ago. "We gave
it a very positive assessment and
at the same time gave quite a few
critical suggestions. That began a
very good relationship and it is

exactly because we like what he is
doing and he likes what we are
doing," Bernstam said.
"So, we're like partners. It's
not like the Russians are children

who Harvard professors or Stan
ford professors tell what to do.
They are sophisticated people who
need technical advice and need to
discuss their ideas."

such a new field of economics that
a theory does not yet exist.
As such, Bernstam emphasized
that ideas can only be tested in
the field by trial and error. "One
should not tell people that if you
do this and this that three years
from now you will be better off,
because one simply does not
know,"he said.
"People should get better
marginally and consistently, oth
erwise we should stop. It is very
easy to make people worse off. We
don't have a science about this.
This is a unique opportunity for
us, as economists, to test the
strength of our ideas."
However, in implementing
such policies, "One should not
exaggerate the view of Western
advisors. It is the people (in Rus
sia) who hold different views and
then they seek like-minded people
here," Bernstam explained.
He described a past example
where Evgenii Saburov, the min
ister of economics of the Russian
government, the top Russian gov
ernment official in charge of eco
nomic reform in the executive
branch, developed his own pro
gram similar to Hoover's but
without their help.
He asked Hoover to evaluate it
about three months ago. "We gave
it a very positive assessment and
at the same time gave quite a few
critical suggestions. That began a
very good relationship and it is

exactly because we like what he is
doing and he likes what we are
doing," Bernstam said.
"So, we're like partners. It's

Senior Hoover Fellow Mikhail Bernstam, a Leningrad native, is
among a team of Hoover scholars analyzing the Russian republic's
300-page tax proposal, at the request of Soviet economists.
Anaiyzing a 300-page tax-law proposal
isn't easy in a country that hasn't had an
explicit system of taxes for 74 years. But
several Hoover Institution fellows have
been doing exactly that at the request of
prominent Soviet economists.
The project is one example of Hoover's
increasing role in advising leaders of the

Russian Republic on economic policy. Since
March, when Hoover scholars visited the
Soviet Union to offer Russian President
Boris Yeltsin policy advice, several other
members of the Russian government have
also sought help.
The chair of the Committee on Budget
and Taxes of the Russian Parliament, recog
nizing the quality of Hoover's past advice on
reform, requested the Institution's sugges
tions on the Republic's proposed tax laws.
"It's all a chain of unrelated accidents,"
said Mikhail Bernstam, a native of Leningrad
and a senior fellow at Hoover, of the Institu
tion's relationship with Russian officials.
It all began with Gorbachev's June 1990
visit to Stanford. Gorbachev had planned to
tour the Hoover archives to examine its world
renowned collection of Soviet documents.
When Bernstam heard about that possi
bility, he and five other Hoover fellows
drafted a journal of policy suggestions.
Although Gorbachev decided not to stop at
Hoover, the journal was presented to Gor
bachev's advisers.
The papers examined specific aspects of
economic reforms such as money and bank
ing, taxes and fiscal policy, labor and wages,
housing and agriculture, privatization and
general reform strategies.
Although Gorbachev apparently ignored
the journal, it did have an impact. Bernstam
translated it into Russian and several copies
were circulated in the Soviet Union.
Through those copies, Yeltsin and his advis
ers learned about Hoover's work.
Impressed by what they read, they invit
ed a delegation of Hoover fellows to visit the
Soviet Union in early March. A second dele-
gation was invited in May. Rus
sian officials also visited Hoover
several times.
Bernstam estimated that 20
million copies of the Hoover-pro
duced materials have been circu
lated in the Soviet Union.
Hoover's technical help
Hoover scholars emphasized
their advisory role in the process
— the Institution does not make
the actual decisions. "We are con
sultants to them," said senior fel
low Annelise Anderson. "We are
not telling them what to do."
Anderson added that the
advice is not intended to repre
sent Hoover's views as an institu
tion; it is simply the opinions of
individual scholars. "We each
express our own views," she said.
"Hoover does not [take] any posi
tion."
Hoover Director John Raisian
said the advice is not political.
"We are not trying to influence
the course of history in the sense
of a political solution," he said.
"We are trying to offer technical
advice so that things can go as the
republics wish for them to
evolve."
Hoover's advice on the pro
posed tax laws skirted the politi
cal issues, according to Raisian.
"Our activity has been limited to
economics," he said. "The tech
nology of gathering taxes is what
we work on — we don't address
how that money is then allocated
to the republic versus the central
system, because that is a political
question."
Bernstam said Hoover schol
ars, when thev make recommen-

sus the central system, because that is a
political question.'

dations, are careful to sidestep the
political aspects of issues.
"We are trying to avoid any
issues that involve political deci
sions — even issues such as
whether republics should have
their own currency or whether
there should be a union curren
cy," Bernstam said. "We never
speak on these issues, because
these are basically more political
than economic."
Raisian said Hoover is not
"picking a horse" in Soviet poli
tics by advising Yeltsin. He said
Hoover is not opposed to Gor
bachev. "We are not trying to dis
criminate as to who we are
involved with," Raisian said.
"People tried to raise that as a
question before the good relations
between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gor
bachev were established. The idea
was that we were helping Yeltsin;
therefore, we were against Gor
bachev."
Raisian noted that Hoover
attempted to advise Gorbachev
first, by creating the journal for
his Stanford visit.
Besides trying to avoid political
situations, Hoover is only inter
ested in participating where it is
invited, Raisian said.
"That's very important," he
said. "They have to decide for
themselves what is in their best
interest."
Bernstam noted that "in most
of the cases, the invitation came
from the Russian side."

"It is members of the Russian
government who approach us, but
they usually approach us when
they already know what we are
doing," he said. "We don't go
uninvited. We don't press our
ideas on anyone."
Bernstam said Hoover puts "all
our cards on the table" because "it
is the Russian people who will
have to live by these reforms."
'Uncertainty' after coup
As a result of the August coup
attempt in the Soviet Union, the
specific role of the Hoover advis
ers is now less clear.
"Things are very fluid right
now," Raisian said. "It i§ a period
of uncertainty. One reason is that
there is now a president of the
Russian republic, which never
had an executive branch of gov
ernment."
"It's not easy for us to tell what
the game plan is because the game
plan is changing on a day-to-day
basis," Raisian added.
The prospects of extending
relations to the central Soviet
government have been complicat
ed by the coup, Bernstam said.
"The central government, at the
moment, does not exist," he said.
Raisian agreed, saying the
Soviet central government is
overwhelmed establishing its own
political workings. "They don't
have any time to deal with outside
advice on economic reform. Eco
nomic reform is a way to help

them get things under control,
but there's just no way they can
absorb everything that needs to
be done from outsiders."
But Bernstam predicted that
another delegation of Hoover offi
cials will be going to the Russian
republic soon.
He said the idea behind the
shifting of the Soviet Union from
one economic system to another is
such a new field of economics that
a theory does not yet exist.
As such, Bernstam emphasized
that ideas can only be tested in
the field by trial and error. "One
