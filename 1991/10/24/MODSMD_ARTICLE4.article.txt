Anaiyzing a 300-page tax-law proposal
isn't easy in a country that hasn't had an
explicit system of taxes for 74 years. But
several Hoover Institution fellows have
been doing exactly that at the request of
prominent Soviet economists.
The project is one example of Hoover's
increasing role in advising leaders of the

Russian Republic on economic policy. Since
March, when Hoover scholars visited the
Soviet Union to offer Russian President
Boris Yeltsin policy advice, several other
members of the Russian government have
also sought help.

It all began with Gorbachev's June 1990
visit to Stanford. Gorbachev had planned to
tour the Hoover archives to examine its world
renowned collection of Soviet documents.
When Bernstam heard about that possi
bility, he and five other Hoover fellows
drafted a journal of policy suggestions.
Although Gorbachev decided not to stop at
Hoover, the journal was presented to Gor
bachev's advisers.
The papers examined specific aspects of
economic reforms such as money and bank

housing and agriculture, privatization and
general reform strategies.
Although Gorbachev apparently ignored
the journal, it did have an impact. Bernstam
translated it into Russian and several copies
were circulated in the Soviet Union.
Through those copies, Yeltsin and his advis
ers learned about Hoover's work.
Impressed by what they read, they invit
ed a delegation of Hoover fellows to visit the
Soviet Union in early March. A second dele-
