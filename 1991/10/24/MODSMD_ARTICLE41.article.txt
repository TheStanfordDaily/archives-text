### Val Masters 
Thanks to compact-disc tech
nology, artists today are releasing
albums that would have been
considered double albums 10
years ago. This isn't necessarily a
good thing.
Only one of three recent 60-
minute-plus releases suggests
that the editing occurred at
rehearsals in the studio rather
than at home on your CD player.
That release is a real gem. In fact,
it's "Diamonds and Pearls."
Prince's latest effort, complete
with a nifty hologram cover,
reunites the 'purple one' with an
actual band, the New Power Gen
eration, and together they deliver
Prince's best album since "Sign
O' the Times." Singer Rosie
Gaines' stirring voice comple
ments Prince's falsetto to a 't,'
while rapper Tony E. tries inject
ing a little Public Enemy into the
proceedings.

"Diamonds and Pearls" has it
all — from the rocking opener
"Thunder" to the rapping "Jug
head," and down to the jazzy
stylings of "Strollin'." The
romantic foreplay of "Insatiable"
and the slinky, seductive
"Cream" reiterate that Prince is
still rated NC-17, but the real
surprise is the infectious, sexy,
'70s rhythm-and-blues flavor
that holds the entire album
together. No tired funk here.
Speaking of tired funk: Funk
rockers the Red Hot Chili Pep
pers sound disappointingly sub
dued on their latest "Blood Sugar
Sex Magik." With Def Jam pro
ducer Rick Rubin (Slayer,
Danzig) the album's emphasis is
on heavy, grinding funk which
sacrifices the band's energetic,
speed flailings for a more
Quaalude-induced sound.
The new muscle works on "If
You Have to Ask" and "Suck My
Kiss," but the album's pace flags
seriously midway through; songs
become repetitive, and you start
wondering if stereos still play
music at 78 rpm. The subtle bal
lad "I Could Have Lied" is power
ful, but the album only comes to
life in the last 55 seconds as the
band tears through a lightening
fast rendition of legendary blues-

Prince's latest effort,

Times.

man Robert Johnson's "They're
Red Hot." Somewhere, Johnson
must be smiling.
An album with no pacing at all
is the Cult's "Ceremony." Until
1989's "Sonic Temple," which
hearkened back to "Love's"
psychedelic, acid-rock sound, the
Cult's music changed dramatical
ly from one album to the next.
Here the band's wall-of-sound
approach is virtually impenetra
ble except for a stray acoustic
strum or piano ripple and seems
largely recycled from past efforts.
Cult guitarist Billy Duffy's
playing continues to improve, but
lan Astbury's vocals are strained,
and the great rhythmic grooves of
"Full Tilt" and "Earth Mofo" are
undermined by Astbury's off
tone, out-of-synch wailing.
Besides, how many times does
one have to hear "Wild Flower,"
which appeared on "Sonic Tem
ple" as "Fire Woman," and makes
a comeback as the band's latest
single, "Wild Hearted Son."
The Pixies' new album
"Trompe Le Monde" finds the
band building its own wall of
sound — an angry, thrashing
Soundgarden-like wall of sound
with songs that harken back to
the band's first album "Surfer
Rosa," rather than either
"Bossanova" or the near-perfect
"Doolittle." With 13 out of its 16
songs shorter than three min
utes, the album has a haphazard,
thrown together feel.
However, repeated listenings
uncover singer/songwriter Black
Francis' unique take on main
stream pop. The end of the sec
ond side, with songs like "Lovely
Day," "Motorway to Roswell" and
"The Navajo Know" may satisfy
those in search of "Doolittle's"
seamless blend of bubbling bass
lines and hard riffs, but "Tromp
Le Monde" indicates that Francis
and the band aspire to heights
greater than pop stardom.
Lloyd Cole, on the other hand,
aspires to just those heights.
Since the mid '80s, when he
fronted the Commotions, Cole
has consistently written and sung
songs with undeniable melodies
and hooks. His second solo
album, and newest release,
"Don't Get Weird on Me Baby,"
only reaffirms that Cole deserves
an audience outside college radio.
The new album is divided into
two distinct sides. The first con
tains Cole's usual: tasteful and
catchy songs. One of these is
"Weeping Wine," a song with a
Byrds' jangle adorned with rich
acoustic guitar and lyrics about
debauchery and love. The second
sides adds orchestration, which
surprisingly, is never over
wrought or maudlin, and sounds
somewhat akin to Elton John.
Cole can do no wrong.

while rapper Tony E. tries inject
ing a little Public Enemy into the
proceedings.

"Diamonds and Pearls" has it
all — from the rocking opener
"Thunder" to the rapping "Jug
head," and down to the jazzy
stylings of "Strollin'." The
romantic foreplay of "Insatiable"
and the slinky, seductive
"Cream" reiterate that Prince is
still rated NC-17, but the real
surprise is the infectious, sexy,
'70s rhythm-and-blues flavor
that holds the entire album
together. No tired funk here.
Speaking of tired funk: Funk
rockers the Red Hot Chili Pep
pers sound disappointingly sub
dued on their latest "Blood Sugar
Sex Magik." With Def Jam pro
ducer Rick Rubin (Slayer,
Danzig) the album's emphasis is
on heavy, grinding funk which
sacrifices the band's energetic,
speed flailings for a more
Quaalude-induced sound.
The new muscle works on "If
You Have to Ask" and "Suck My
Kiss," but the album's pace flags
seriously midway through; songs
become repetitive, and you start
wondering if stereos still play
music at 78 rpm. The subtle bal
lad "I Could Have Lied" is power
ful, but the album only comes to
life in the last 55 seconds as the
band tears through a lightening
fast rendition of legendary blues-

Prince's latest effort,
complete with a nifty
hologram cover... is
Prince's best album
since "Sign O' the
Times.

man Robert Johnson's "They're
Red Hot." Somewhere, Johnson
must be smiling.
An album with no pacing at all
is the Cult's "Ceremony." Until
1989's "Sonic Temple," which
hearkened back to "Love's"
psychedelic, acid-rock sound, the
Cult's music changed dramatical
ly from one album to the next.
Here the band's wall-of-sound
approach is virtually impenetra
ble except for a stray acoustic
strum or piano ripple and seems
largely recycled from past efforts.
Cult guitarist Billy Duffy's
playing continues to improve, but
lan Astbury's vocals are strained,
and the great rhythmic grooves of
"Full Tilt" and "Earth Mofo" are
undermined by Astbury's off
tone, out-of-synch wailing.
Besides, how many times does
one have to hear "Wild Flower,"
which appeared on "Sonic Tem
ple" as "Fire Woman," and makes
a comeback as the band's latest
single, "Wild Hearted Son."
The Pixies' new album
"Trompe Le Monde" finds the
band building its own wall of
sound — an angry, thrashing
Soundgarden-like wall of sound
with songs that harken back to
the band's first album "Surfer
Rosa," rather than either
"Bossanova" or the near-perfect
"Doolittle." With 13 out of its 16
songs shorter than three min
utes, the album has a haphazard,
thrown together feel.
However, repeated listenings
uncover singer/songwriter Black
Francis' unique take on main
stream pop. The end of the sec
ond side, with songs like "Lovely
Day," "Motorway to Roswell" and
"The Navajo Know" may satisfy
those in search of "Doolittle's"
seamless blend of bubbling bass
lines and hard riffs, but "Tromp
Le Monde" indicates that Francis
and the band aspire to heights
greater than pop stardom.
Lloyd Cole, on the other hand,
aspires to just those heights.
Since the mid '80s, when he
fronted the Commotions, Cole
has consistently written and sung
songs with undeniable melodies
and hooks. His second solo
album, and newest release,
"Don't Get Weird on Me Baby,"
only reaffirms that Cole deserves
an audience outside college radio.
The new album is divided into
two distinct sides. The first con
tains Cole's usual: tasteful and
catchy songs. One of these is
"Weeping Wine," a song with a
Byrds' jangle adorned with rich
acoustic guitar and lyrics about
debauchery and love. The second
sides adds orchestration, which
surprisingly, is never over
wrought or maudlin, and sounds
somewhat akin to Elton John.
Cole can do no wrong.
