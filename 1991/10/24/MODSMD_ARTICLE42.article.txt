# American Music Club speaks out
## 
### Nancy Peponis 
"American Music Club's
lamentably cultish reputation
seems poised on the brink of The
Big Time." That's what their
press release biography says.
And with their superb new
release — "Everclear" — you
have to hope the attitude is not
wishful thinking but just stating
the obvious.
If there's any justice, Ameri
can Music Club will leave cult
status far behind. Formed in
1985, the San Francisco band
has been making some of the
most emotionally-charged music
on the indie scene. AMC singer
and songwriter Mark Eitzel is
largely responsible for this — his
vision encompasses both the
achingly beautiful and the vio
lently disturbing.
I spoke to Mark Eitzel by
phone on the eve of AMC's U.S.
tour to support "Everclear,"
their fifth album.
While you were writing and
recording "Everclear," were you
consciously trying to reach a
wider audience ?

"Not in terms of the songs I
wrote, but yes in terms of the
production and overall feel of the
record. We wanted to make
something that would sound big
ger and brighter and a little more
brash than the previous album. I
think that 'Everclear' is a lot
more exuberant.
"I didn't want our albums to
seem like they were the makings
of a manic depressive. Those past
albums sound to me like the
songs were deliberately made to
sound sad and slow. I don't want
that anymore."
It's hard to describe "Ever
clear. " The album has pop, coun
try, rock, folk, blues and those
amazing atmospherics. How do
you fuse these different elements
together?
"I don't think we could meld
them together unless we liked all
those influences. It's because
that's what we hear in our heads.
It sort of goes, 'Yeah that sounds
like Hank Williams, but I think it
needs feedback, too.' "
So you've been influenced by
country?
"I have to a certain extent

because I like the form. I really
started writing country songs
because I knew that it would piss
off most of the people who would
come to see us. Most 'alterna
tive,' so to speak, people in the
early '80s would blanch at the
idea of something so unhip as
country music. But I've really
grown to like the form.
"Vudi [guitarist] and Danny
[Pearson, bassist] are the big
country fans and so is Bruce
[Kaphan], the pedal steel player.
I was in a punk band in the late
'70s and early '80s — those are
my roots, really."
How do you write your songs?
"I go to a cafe every day and
write for at least an hour on any
topic. And then when I sit with a
guitar, I do the same thing. I
don't really aim. I don't have any
goals. I do sit there and go, 'Well,
this would be a good song,' but I
don't try to force anything. It's
just the same as anybody who
writes. I'm not an artist or an
'artiste.' I'm just a songwriter."
So do you think your song
writing is art?
"No, I think that songwriting

is media. It's not poetry. It's not
playwriting. It's not music. It's
media — all the news that's fit
to sing. I'm a believer in that.
It's like I'm a journalist, but I'm
not very good at writing. Sort of
an idiot-savant journalist."
"Rise" has got an anthemic
feel, especially with that won
derful, soaring chorus. What's
behind the song?
"I wrote it for a friend of
mine who had AIDS, and I want
ed it to be upbeat and anthem
like. I write a lot of sad songs,
and somebody who's really sick
and sad does not need them. So I
wanted it to be not sad."
Does "Rise" have the poten
tial to be a radio hit?
"That's the idea. We'd like to
have a radio hit; it'd be nice.
The only reason we're alterna
tive is because nobody else orig
inally wanted to listen to us. But
the kind of people who come to
our shows are pretty much
across-the- board. The only
music-buying-public types who
aren't there are people with
mohawks. [He pauses to recon
sider.] We do have them."
