# Boxers vs. briefs, the debate rages on
## 
### Mark Byer 
There has been a long-standing debate in
the men's fashion and spiritual realm
between boxers and tightie-whities.
Traditionally, boxers have been viewed as
absurd and for the over-the-hill-and-off-the
cliff man. However, with the advent of the
new generation of young minds and twisted
social reform spreading across the world, box
ers are making a powerful comeback.
It's shocking that this comeback is not
owed to highly-paid fashion leaders in France.
This comeback is actually owed to the women
across the hall who see you every morning on
your way to the shower. After all, guys, the
only person that should ever see you in your
underwear is the significant other you plan to
spend the rest of your life with . . . and so this
female perspective on the subject is quite valu
able.
So I polled Stanford's female experts — and

the result was an overwhelming support
for boxers. Seven times out of 10, box-

ers can be counted on as key state
ments of both form and fashion in
the bedroom, Oval, Quad, Meyer, a
convenient tree, Mem Chu. . . .

Few on our female panel of
experts showed a marked prefer
ence for the tight, white torture
devices. A majority of them agreed

the pure sexiness of boxers could
only be equalled by the thrill of
going on an actual date at Stan-

ford.
Senior Heather Davis —
most definitely an expert — pre
ferred silk boxers. According to
Davis, boxers are "definitely sexier"
than briefs, especially paisley box-

ers. In particular, the way box
ers emphasize a man's stom
ach muscles is as orgasmic

as going on an actual
date at Stanford, she
said.
Doctors have
been telling men to
change to boxers for a
long time, explaining
the indirect relation
between tightness

and sperm count.
Only now that the
female popula
tion is begin-

ning to appre
ciate boxers

are we lis-

ten
ing.

"Expert" Guinevere Boostrom confirms,
"Boxers just make [a man] more virile."
Although virility can be an advantage for
the short term, freshman Ben Futrieb looked
nine months ahead and said, "Of course, box
ers can give one a much higher sperm count.
This is not always good."
Doctors aside and style in mind, freshperson
Ari Lipton said "the way [briefs] mold ... you
see everything. Although, I don't like white;

it's ugly." Meanwhile she salivated in

a definite Pavlovian reflex. She
finds the way briefs hold and
expose all a man has to offer I
quite the thrill, as multiply
orgasmic as going on an actual
date at Stanford.
So what did the men have to
say about all this?
Plainly speaking, not much.
Sophomore Manuel Mejia pre
ferred the way briefs "held in

tightly" what there is to hold
in. As for senior Rob El-
Karieh he found that boxers
provided much more room
and comfort. However, when

he was playing basketball, he
preferred briefs to "stop the
bouncing around" that can be
somewhat painful.
Men were almost evenly split,

finding the function of briefs
more suitable, while others
disagreed, preferring box
ers to the heinous constric
tion of briefs.

The safe bet for this
year would be boxers. "All
is not seen at once. It's an

alluring mystery," said one
expert, disregarding how more
and more often men are pulling
their boxers below their shorts.
She would know. Trust me.
