# Frisbee golf: not just for geeks anymore
## 
### Travis Farr 
To most students on campus, they are
everyday objects — sculptures, trash cans,
archways, the clock tower — but to a dedicat
ed few they have true significance. Anyone
who has ever hefted a frisbee and yearned for
something less sweaty and more underground
than Ultimate will recognize these Stanford
landmarks as the "holes" of frisbee golf.
Frisbee golf is a relaxed, easy-going Stan
ford tradition. No one is quite sure where the
game came from or how long it has been here,
but it is popular enough that there is a stan
dard course that criss-crosses the campus and
is printed in the Handbook of Stanford Uni
versity.
The sport even has its own body of folklore:
There are stories of frisbees getting stuck
behind the hands of the clock on the clock
tower and of abortive attempts to take the
game inside Meyer Library. There is also a tra
dition that makes frequent reference to a play
er known to be one of the five best in the
world, but whose last name no one can
remember. It is in a way indicative of the sta
tus of the game that Stanford's greatest star is
remembered simply as "Conrad."
This year, however, the Axe Committee is
sponsoring an event that it hopes will raise the
game out of its obscurity and into the main
stream of weird Stanford sports: the First
Annual Frisbee Golf Tournament will be held
Nov. 3.
Frisbee golf is played much like its country
club cousin. The players tee off from behind a
specified line and then throw the frisbee as
many times as it takes to hit the "hole" —
except in the case of arches, which the frisbee
must pass through.
The holes on the standard course — which
includes lamps, arches and the rosette in the
center of the Quad — are rated with par rat
ings between two and six. The "golden rules"
of frisbee golf are very explicit on some points:
For example, no motorized frisbees are
allowed; no shot can be taken over; and
passers-by who interfere with the game are to
be "scolded profusely."
The first team will tee off at 9 a.m., and
teams will leave every five minutes following
that until 11 a.m. The tournament will consist
of 24 four-member teams and will probably
last about four hours.
A scorekeeper will accompany each team

and calculate the team score, which will be the
sum of the individual scores of the team mem
bers. The course takes about two hours to
complete, so everyone should be finished in
time for the awards ceremony at 2 p.m.
The first, second and third place teams will
receive Discraft frisbees for each of their mem
bers, and the first place team will also receive

a dinner for four at Compadre's. Everyone
who participates will receive a free T-shirt.
Registration for the event will take place
thus Sunday at the base of the clock tower
between 10 a.m. and noon. The places will be
filled on a first-come, first-served basis, and
since space is limited, teams should sign up
early to come out and make history.
