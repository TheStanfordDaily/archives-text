# Hoover snipes at Harvard plan

In the high-powered, high-publicity
world of superpower consulting, there
are bound to be political conflicts.
Case in point: The Hoover Institu
tion, never one to slink away from con
troversy, has picked a bitter battle
with the Kennedy School of Govern
ment over who has the better Soviet
reform proposals.
The Harvard plan, dubbed the
Grand Bargain, proposes that the
United States give massive aid to the
Soviet republics in exchange for deep
market reforms. The idea, being
examined by high-level officials in
both countries, is intended to lighten
the pain of massive reforms and help
assure their success.
