# Hoover snipes at Harvard plan

### Sophia Shing 
In the high-powered, high-publicity
world of superpower consulting, there
are bound to be political conflicts.
Case in point: The Hoover Institu
tion, never one to slink away from con
troversy, has picked a bitter battle
with the Kennedy School of Govern
ment over who has the better Soviet
reform proposals.
The Harvard plan, dubbed the
Grand Bargain, proposes that the
United States give massive aid to the
Soviet republics in exchange for deep
market reforms. The idea, being
examined by high-level officials in
both countries, is intended to lighten
the pain of massive reforms and help
assure their success.
But some Hoover scholars say
American money spent in a
"Grand Bargain" would be Amer
ican money thrown down a hole.
And the Hoover scholars have
gone on the offensive, calling the
plan's use of Western aid to
induce political and economic
reforms "bribery."
"Our whole approach has been
that we would like to provide on a
pro bono basis any advice that we
think can perhaps serve in a posi
tive way," said John Raison,
Hoover's director. "And I think
that is as far as the American pub
lic should go."
Senior Fellow Mikhail Bern

stam, the coordinator of Hoover's
advice efforts, said that under
Harvard's plan, scholars "would
never know whether an idea was
accepted because it was a good one
... or just because they were
bribed."
Bernstam said Harvard's plan
unfairly belittles the Soviets,
treating them as'outsiders in
their own country.
"They are not guinea pigs," he
said. "The Russians have been
subjected to all sorts of central
planning for 74 years. Enough is
enough. It doesn't matter from
Marx to Mao or from Stanford to
Harvard — people have had
enough of untested theories that
have promised improvements in
the distant future."
But Leo Woloski, a research
assistant for the Harvard group,

said the Grand Bargain's main
thrust is to encourage active
Western involvement in the Sovi
et transformation to democracy
and a free-market economy.
Woloski said that the Grand
Bargain plan can claim "a certain
amount of credit" for the
advances made so far.
Steve Singer, director of com
munications and public affairs at
the Kennedy School of Govern
ment, said the Harvard plan is the
only way the Soviets can achieve
reform.
He compared the Grand Bar
gain to the Marshall Plan, which
aided European countries after
World War 11.
The Harvard plan is not
bribery, Singer said. "People
often mischaracterize the pro
gram that way," he said. "It's not

a bribe and it's not pouring money
into a broken system."
Singer emphasized the United
States' duty to aid the Soviet
Union. "If they are genuinely
committed to this, then it is in our
interest to help them succeed," he
said.
The Soviet economy has
"crashed," Singer said. "Moving
toward a more Western style of
economy is their only hope."
The alternative, he said, "is
that they will either disintegrate
or return to a totalitarian state —
neither of which is in our inter
ests. "
But that did not convince the
Hoover scholars.
Raisian said his central objec
tion to the Grand Bargain was
"the presumption on Harvard's
part that the United States

It's not a bribe.'
— Steve Singer

should be willing to buy economic
reform that would eventually ben
efit the people of the Soviet
Union."
Also, Raisian said he objects to
the idea that "Americans and
other nations would contribute
billions and billions of dollars to
induce the Soviet Union to change
when it's in their interest to
change."
Bernstam, seeming to go for
the jugular of his consultant com
petitors, even called the Harvard
scholars unduly clandestine in
their activities. "It is very difficult
to discuss the differences between
the two programs because our

materials are all available, but no
one has ever seen the Harvard
plan."
"If the American public is sup
posed to provide over $100 mil
lion in aid and the Russian public
is supposed to live under certain
experimental ideas, I think that
we" should have details, he
added.
"Unlike Harvard, we don't
want to work behind closed doors.
I believe in publishing everything.
People have a right to know. I'm
opposed to any type of intellectual
manipulation," he exclaimed.
Several scholars suggested
holding a nationally televised
open debate to discuss both points
of view and allow people to make
an informed decision about which
is more suitable for the Soviet
economy.
