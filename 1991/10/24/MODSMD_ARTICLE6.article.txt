# What a kick!
## Creative project makes the grade 
### Annie Decker 
Field-goal kicking practice took place in the
Quad yesterday afternoon, complete with a goal
post, referees and eagerly watching fans — but
without players.
Students in Mechanical Engineering 101,
"Visual Thinking," demonstrated their first pro
jects — a device that "kicks" a field goal through
a set of regulation-height goal posts.
The only materials allowed were foam core,
string, fabric, a broom, tubing, rubber bands,
glue, a paper clip, a shoe and, of course, the official
football. From these, the students created such
parts as javelins, baskets, clamps and pulleys.
The ball had to be kicked at least 10 yards, as
marked on the ground with red tape. The longest
"kick" was about 50 yards; the average was close
to 25.
Wearing black-and-white striped referee uni
forms, the course's lecturers Robert Adams and
Wade McNary monitored the game and watched
for illegal plays and misuse of materials. At least
one yellow flag was thrown.
"The benefits of a project like this is that
attention is focused on the creative process.
There are many different ways to succeed," said
Adams, who has taught the course for three
years. "It is a quite challenging problem because
of the limited materials."
The students were split into twelve groups,
each with four or five members. Every student
had to design a critical part of the final device.
Each group is evaluated individually on perfor
mance success.
As the demonstration progressed, more and
more captivated watchers gathered near the

"field" to watch the perfor
mances, applauding after each
attempt. Referees warned them
to watch out for flying projectiles.
One of the most accurate
devices was a crossbow-type

machine, built by Team L. Team
member Mari Smith, a sopho
more, said that although the pro
ject "took so much time" to
design, she is glad it went well.
"It is an awesome class,"
junior Vic Chao said. "It is actual
ly one of the reasons why I'm .. .
here. The creative aspect sets
Stanford's engineering program
apart from all others."
