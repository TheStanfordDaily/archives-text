## 'Sister brunei' discovers Ghana 
### Karen Jordan 
When Lavonne Chandler first met
the people of Ghana as a Peace Corps
volunteer, she couldn't believe they
viewed her as a Westerner and not as a
kindred soul.
"It's kind of shocking . . . especially
as an African-American, if you come to
Africa with this nationalist fervor, like
we're all the same people," she said.
"While [Africans] have a lot of affin
ity for African-Americans, they don't
see attributes as being the same,"
Chandler added. "We have totally dif
ferent values, totally different perspec
tives on things, just because we've
been separated."
Chandler, a first-year student in the
Graduate School of Business, would
not have had this eye-opening experi
ence if it had not been for a Los Ange
les Times article she read five years
ago.
What struck Chandler about this
article was its claim that Peace Corps
volunteers who go into private indus
tries have a better performance rating
than other people.
Chandler, 26, was uncertain of her
future plans when she graduated from
Stanford in 1987. A petroleum engi
neering major, she was debating tak
ing time off before pursuing graduate
studies.
So after researching thg Peace
Corps in her native Chicago and work
ing for Mobil Gas Company, Chandler
took off for Ghana, arriving on July 5,
1989 as a Peace Corps volunteer.
Chandler was assigned as a mathe
matics teacher in Keta, Ghana, and
remembers the first night of her two
year stay vividly.
"I didn't expect to land and have
everyone .. . open their arms and just
give me the biggest hug," she said.
"I think when I landed, it just sud
denly hit me that I was landing in
Africa. That night I just cried. I said,
'This is just amazing.' "
Later that week, Chandler had
what she described as "the most
intense spiritual experience" of her
life: she was taken to the Cape Coast to
view the slave castles there.
"You go to the cliff where you actu
ally have a view of the Gulf, and you

think, this is where all of this started,"
Chandler said. "These people were
herded into these castles and then
shipped out. You can send yourself
back to that time and think . . . how
they must have felt leaving Ghana and
looking out into this huge ocean hav
ing no idea where they were going."
While Chandler was deeply touched
by the thought of past Ghanaians'
experiences, her emotions were equal
ly triggered by her interaction with
people from present-day Ghana. At
first, she was shocked by their view of
her as a Westerner.
Chandler was especially struck
when her students began to call her
"brunei" — literally, "white person
from across the sea." Some of them
even referred to her as "sister brunei,"
recognizing some bond, but an incom
plete one.
However, Chandler said she was not
offended by the different perspectives
she saw in Africa. Lack of patience and
understanding about the culture were,
according to Chandler, two major rea
sons why some volunteers were not
able to complete their assignments.
"Part of the whole Peace Corps
experience is learning to understand . .
. their system of values and respecting
that they have a different culture," she
said. Some volunteers come thinking
they know everything, and "if you
come there and you can't get beyond
that first hurdle it's going to have a
very negative impact on your whole
experience," Chandler said.
She described the things she loves
about Ghana and its "generous" peo
ple, saying the Peace Corps mission
has had a significant effect on her life.
"It changed my perspective," she
said. Instead of wanting to become an
investment banker or a consultant,
now she said she hopes business school
"will put me on my way toward helping
[African] economies grow a little
more."
While recommending the Peace
Corps highly to all students, Chandler
especially urged African-Americans to
become volunteers. According to the
San Francisco Peace Corps office,
minorities comprise only 10 percent of
the Peace Corps volunteers recruited
in 1991.

But Chandler also warns anyone
who is considering the Peace Corps
that "it is a commitment and you have
to be willing to make the sacrifices."
Chandler herself has no regrets,
however. "There are no sacrifices that
I think I made .. . because the experi

ence was so rich," she said. "If you can
make the commitment, it will pay off."
And the experience definitely paid
off for Chandler. She not only made a
few friends along the way — she also
left her heart behind with her Ghana
ian fiance.

traveled to Ghana, where she faced the frustration of being treated like an
outsider — even though she is of African descent.
