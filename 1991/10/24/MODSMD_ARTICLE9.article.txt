# Employees criticize takeover
## Some staff frustrated by process, but now are satisfied 
### Scott Handleman 
Some staff members at Cowell Student Health
Center say they are disappointed with the han
dling of a recent administrative transition, but
they have been pleased with the quality of service
provided since the School of Medicine took over
the center.
The Medical School took over student care at
Cowell on Sept. 1, ending a 45-year relationship
between Cowell and the Palo Alto Medical Founda
tion.

over being forced to reapply for their jobs and fac
ing a cut in benefits, decided to leave the center
this summer.
The Medical School's Faculty Practice Pro
gram now oversees Cowell, rather than the Foun
dation plan. The Foundation is a group of 700
physicians, nurses and support staff, 50 of whom
had been employed at Cowell.
An announcement that Cowell's affiliation
would change was made in April after a commit
tee of University faculty, staff and students con
sidered bids from the Medical School and the
Foundation.
No Cowell doctors, nurse practitioners or
nurses were included on the committee, which
left several of them feeling alienated from the
process.
"The opinions of these practitioners, who
should best know the medical needs of students,
were not even solicited," said one staff member
who declined to be identified.
Cowell Director Harvey Weinstein said they
were excluded because of concern that they might
exhibit a bias toward the Foundation, which
employed them.
He acknowledged that the Foundation had
been "doing a good job" of providing medical care.
But the change was necessary, he said, because
the Medical School could provide more specialized
care, as well as advanced health promotion pro
grams.
A 4 f* ustrating' changeover process
Irene Cannon, a staff physician at Cowell, said
she has been "veiy happily surprised" by the Medi
cal School's performance, but remains dissatisfied
with the "frustrating" handling of the affiliation
changeover process.
She speculated that many employees have been
reluctant to speak out about the changeover
because they fear losing their jobs.
All Cowell employees had to reapply for their
jobs as a result of the changeover, she said, effec
tively making them new employees.
Although none of the staff members who reap
plied were denied their old jobs, Cannon said many
— including herself — faced decreases in benefits
such as sick leave and vacation time.
Rather than return, some staff members
declined to reapply for their posts. Four of Cow

ell's 18 nurses and one of three nurse practition
ers left the center this summer, but no staff physi
cians left. Two new physicians were hired.
Cannon said employee protest of the Cowell
administration's "socially irresponsible" actions
was minimized because the procedures for the
changeover were announced during the summer,
when most Cowell employees were on vacation.
Weinstein acknowledged that some staff mem
bers may have left Cowell because they feared los
ing seniority, but others left for different reasons.
He said the nurse practitioner who left did so
because she plans to become a midwife.
The staffs concern about losing pay was
unwarranted, Weinstein said, because some staff
members are actually "better off' financially
under the new plan.
But Cowell Associate Director Jane Meier
acknowledged that long-time staff members lost
accumulated sick leave and vacation time when
they became new Stanford employees.
She added that the transition holdovers, as
first-time employees in the Faculty Practice Pro
gram, will be excluded from Stanford's retirement
program for one year. After that they are eligible
to join the University pension system, but without
compensation for their years with the Founda
tion.
The University plan will provide them with full
health and dental insurance and other benefits,
Meier said.
One receptionist who declined to be identified
said Cowell
"lost a lot of people who were the backbone" of the
organization during the transition.

at a particularly inconvenient time because staff
must register every new patient in a new comput
er system at Cowell. The result has been longer
lines and longer waits at the front desk.
John Dorman director of public relations and a
staff physician at Cowell, conceded that some staff
members had complained about the confusion
accompanying the change, but observed that no
students had submitted complaints.
Letter draws fire from officials
Armand Gelpi, a physician at the Veteran Affairs
Medical Center who had been associate director at
Cowell for 10 years, questioned the wisdom and
motivations behind the changeover in a letter to
Campus Report last month, drawing fire from
Weinstein and others.
"The Stanford student health service has lost a
splendid support system — until now, provided by
the Palo Alto Medical Foundation," Gelpi wrote in
the letter. "In its place will be a new resource for
specialty services that is not likely to match the
standards set by the foundation."
Weinstein and three Medical School officials
wrote responses that were published in the next
actually, in many cases" under
the new care-providing system.
All of the specialty services that
the foundation formerly provided
—including orthopedics and derma
tology, which are based at Cowell
owing to the frequency of their con
sultation — are now provided by the
Medical School, Cannon said.
Gynecology, a Cowell-based
specialty service contracted by
another medical group, was not
affected by the transition.
Dorman said the Medical
School is providing high "quality

of medicine" and that its ability to
provide normal student services is
"as good" as the foundation's.
Weinstein said one crucial fac
tor in the changeover decision was
the Medical School's provision for
hiring a quality control investiga
tor who will report to him on Cow
ell's performance.
"Quality assurance has become
a very important part of
medicine," Weinstein said, adding
that the investigator will ensure
that the Medical School maintains
high standards.
If the quality of care investiga
tor finds the Medical School delin
quent or inadequate in three to six
months, it will lose its contract
with Cowell.

exhibit a bias toward the Foundation, which
employed them.
He acknowledged that the Foundation had
been "doing a good job" of providing medical care.
But the change was necessary, he said, because
the Medical School could provide more specialized
care, as well as advanced health promotion pro
grams.
A 4 f* ustrating' changeover process
Irene Cannon, a staff physician at Cowell, said
she has been "veiy happily surprised" by the Medi
cal School's performance, but remains dissatisfied
with the "frustrating" handling of the affiliation
changeover process.
She speculated that many employees have been
reluctant to speak out about the changeover
because they fear losing their jobs.
All Cowell employees had to reapply for their
jobs as a result of the changeover, she said, effec
tively making them new employees.
Although none of the staff members who reap
plied were denied their old jobs, Cannon said many
— including herself — faced decreases in benefits
such as sick leave and vacation time.
Rather than return, some staff members
declined to reapply for their posts. Four of Cow

ell's 18 nurses and one of three nurse practition
ers left the center this summer, but no staff physi
cians left. Two new physicians were hired.
Cannon said employee protest of the Cowell
administration's "socially irresponsible" actions
was minimized because the procedures for the
changeover were announced during the summer,
when most Cowell employees were on vacation.
Weinstein acknowledged that some staff mem
bers may have left Cowell because they feared los
ing seniority, but others left for different reasons.
He said the nurse practitioner who left did so
because she plans to become a midwife.
The staffs concern about losing pay was
unwarranted, Weinstein said, because some staff
members are actually "better off' financially
under the new plan.
But Cowell Associate Director Jane Meier
acknowledged that long-time staff members lost
accumulated sick leave and vacation time when
they became new Stanford employees.
She added that the transition holdovers, as
first-time employees in the Faculty Practice Pro
gram, will be excluded from Stanford's retirement
program for one year. After that they are eligible
to join the University pension system, but without
compensation for their years with the Founda
tion.
The University plan will provide them with full
health and dental insurance and other benefits,
Meier said.
One receptionist who declined to be identified
said Cowell
"lost a lot of people who were the backbone" of the
organization during the transition.

at a particularly inconvenient time because staff
must register every new patient in a new comput
er system at Cowell. The result has been longer
lines and longer waits at the front desk.
John Dorman director of public relations and a
staff physician at Cowell, conceded that some staff
members had complained about the confusion
accompanying the change, but observed that no
students had submitted complaints.
Letter draws fire from officials
Armand Gelpi, a physician at the Veteran Affairs
Medical Center who had been associate director at
Cowell for 10 years, questioned the wisdom and
motivations behind the changeover in a letter to
Campus Report last month, drawing fire from
Weinstein and others.
"The Stanford student health service has lost a
splendid support system — until now, provided by
the Palo Alto Medical Foundation," Gelpi wrote in
the letter. "In its place will be a new resource for
specialty services that is not likely to match the
standards set by the foundation."
Weinstein and three Medical School officials
wrote responses that were published in the next
actually, in many cases" under
the new care-providing system.
All of the specialty services that
the foundation formerly provided
—including orthopedics and derma
tology, which are based at Cowell
owing to the frequency of their con
sultation — are now provided by the
Medical School, Cannon said.
Gynecology, a Cowell-based
specialty service contracted by
another medical group, was not
affected by the transition.
Dorman said the Medical
School is providing high "quality

of medicine" and that its ability to
provide normal student services is
"as good" as the foundation's.
Weinstein said one crucial fac
tor in the changeover decision was
the Medical School's provision for
hiring a quality control investiga
tor who will report to him on Cow
ell's performance.
"Quality assurance has become
a very important part of
medicine," Weinstein said, adding
that the investigator will ensure
that the Medical School maintains
high standards.
If the quality of care investiga
tor finds the Medical School delin
quent or inadequate in three to six
months, it will lose its contract
with Cowell.
Some staff members at Cowell Student Health
Center say they are disappointed with the han
dling of a recent administrative transition, but
they have been pleased with the quality of service
provided since the School of Medicine took over
the center.
The Medical School took over student care at
Cowell on Sept. 1, ending a 45-year relationship
between Cowell and the Palo Alto Medical Founda
tion.

over being forced to reapply for their jobs and fac
ing a cut in benefits, decided to leave the center
this summer.
The Medical School's Faculty Practice Pro
gram now oversees Cowell, rather than the Foun
dation plan. The Foundation is a group of 700
physicians, nurses and support staff, 50 of whom
had been employed at Cowell.
An announcement that Cowell's affiliation
would change was made in April after a commit
tee of University faculty, staff and students con
sidered bids from the Medical School and the
Foundation.
No Cowell doctors, nurse practitioners or
nurses were included on the committee, which
left several of them feeling alienated from the
process.
"The opinions of these practitioners, who
should best know the medical needs of students,
were not even solicited," said one staff member
who declined to be identified.

exhibit a bias toward the Foundation, which
