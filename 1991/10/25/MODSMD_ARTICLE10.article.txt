SIDON, Lebanon (AP) â€” Opponents of PLO
chief Yasser Arafat seized the mainstream PLO fac
tion's main Lebanon headquarters yesterday to
protest Arafat's acceptance of the Middle East peace
conference, security sources said.
About 300 Palestine Liberation Organization
guerrillas seized the command headquarters of the
Fatah faction and most of the rest of the Ein el-
Hilweh refugee camp, which with at least 33,000
refugees is the largest of 12 Palestinian camps in
Lebanon.
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the bloodless insurrection at the camp on
Sidon's southeastern edge was led by Maj. Munir
Makdah, commander of Fatah's security apparatus,
known as Force 17.
It spilled over into the streets of Sidon, where dis
sidents were restricting access to the sprawling
shantytown.
One source said the dissidents inside had begun
meetings with leaders of pro-Iranian factions to
coordinate action against the peace conference.
Among those at the meetings were the Iranian
backed Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God,
and the Islamic Alliance, a coalition of Lebanese and
Palestinian Sunni Muslim fundamentalists, the

source said.
A conference of 450 Palestinian and Muslim lead
ers this week in Tehran issued a statement con
demning the Madrid conference and promising a
worldwide campaign to keep Arab nations from rec
ognizing Israel.
The takeover occurred in the absence of Arafat's
main lieutenants, most of whom are in Tunis, the
main PLO headquarters, to discuss the peace con
ference, the sources said.
Israel has not allowed any direct PLO participa
tion in the talks, but Arafat has said that the
Palestinian team taking part will consult closely
with him.
There was no immediate comment from Tunis on
the takeover.
The sources said another motivating factor might
have been dissatisfaction in the ranks over pay cuts
ordered by Arafat after Persian Gulf nations cut
their financing to the PLO because Arafat sided
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
One source said the dissidents belonged to the
first wave of emigration from Palestine after the
establishment of Israel in the 1948 Middle East war.
"They believe they have the right to be in control,"
the source said.
