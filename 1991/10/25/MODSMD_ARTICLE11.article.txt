The proposed changes
to the Judicial Charter
threaten student rights

MEMBERS OF THE Stan
ford community feel a
sense of belonging partly
because of the belief that everyone
is treated in a fundamentally fair
way. A recent proposal by the Com
mittee of 15, chaired by Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode, to amend the Uni
versity's Legislative and Judicial
Charter would violate this trust by
dramatically changing the way
Stanford administers justice.
The proposal would lighten an
accuser's burden of proof from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence."
As Dean of Students Michael Jack
son commented, 51 percent of the
evidence may be sufficient to con
vict someone. Essentially, Stan
ford wishes to replace a standard
derived from criminal cases with
one associated with civil suits.
The reason for the change is
manifest. It is extremely difficult
for the University to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that someone
has committed forbidden acts. The
University does not have the
power to subpoena and cannot
force someone to testify.
In particular, problems of proof
often accompany sexual-assault
cases. In such instances it often
comes down to one person's word
against another's. The changes
would make a guilty charge more
easily obtained.
Other universities have adopted
the proposal; some, like Brown,
have no declared standard at all.
But such a change has dis
turbingly wide implications, for
there is a fundamental difference
between civil and criminal actions.
In a civil suit, two private parties
face one another, with the state as
an independent arbitrator. But in a
criminal suit, where a private
party faces an agent of the state,

the matter is also arbitrated by an
agent of the state. And the state's
power far exceeds the individual's.
How relevant is the analogy? In
almost all disciplinary actions, the
University considers the action of
an individual as it relates to the
University. Even in sexual-assault
cases, the ultimate issue is whether
the accused will remain a member
of the Stanford community.
Stanford might pursue the most
admirable of goals, but it cannot be
considered an indifferent arbitra
tor. For the accused individual, the
stakes are high and the evidence
subjective. Requiring evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt best
ensures the integrity of the process.
Moreover, tilting the evidential
balance of power raises other trou
bling issues. For example, if a per
son speaks confidentially in front
of a Stanford tribunal, could wit
nesses or records to that testimony
be later subpoenaed and used in a
court of law?
Ironically, when Stanford revised
the Fundamental Standard to
restrict so-called "hate speech,"
administrators assured doubters
that any kind of speech crime must
be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt. Has this earlier assurance
been forgotten?
As a private institution, Stanford
can pretty much decide who it wish
es to associate with, and under what
conditions; due process is a volun
tary commitment. But the legal and
philosophical principles of how to
treat an accused person predate
Stanford's existence by hundreds of
years. The University should resist
the urge to tinker with constitution
al standards, risking unforeseeable
consequences in order to ameliorate
contemporary difficulties.
As a private, discrete communi
ty, Stanford is justified to some
extent in creating its own rules
and norms of conduct. But the idea
of tossing aside hallowed princi
ples because the University views
itself as some kind of utopia is
frightening. Someone may get
burned if the University continues
playing with fire.
