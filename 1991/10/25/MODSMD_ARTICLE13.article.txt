## Diana Akiyama Cutting through sexual harassment 
### 
IT'S INTERESTING. I'VE TALKED
to a number of women lately who are
refusing to talk about the Clarence
Thomas/Anita Hill issue anymore. They
give essentially the same reason: I'm
tired of trying to talk about the subject of
sexual harassment with people who don't
understand or don't want to understand.
One friend told me that she no longer
talks about the issue because during her
last conversation with a male she ended
up calling him an idiot. Another friend
said she is tired of people assuming that
she, as a woman, has some great wisdom
on the issue that will enable self-styled
liberals to be on the correct side.
The shocking ineptitude of the sena
tors who questioned Thomas gives us
weeks of material for discussion. But if we
focus on the issue of sexual harassment,
we have enough material for months or
years of discussion because we first would
need to hear the testimony of the num
bers of women who have been harassed.
If there is one thing that most women
are not surprised by and that men find
shocking, it's the statistics that verify the
high numbers of women who are sexual
ly harassed. My personal suspicion is that
the actual numbers are much higher, as
many women do not understand the clear
definition of sexual harassment enough
to count their own experiences of it.
The other reason it would take so long
to discuss sexual harassment effectively

has to do with the stunningly low level of
awareness among men. The hearings
made it clear men do not struggle with
this issue in ways that give them insight
into how to address allegations.
Given this, it is very tempting to reduce
a discussion about sexual harassment to:
"What do you know? You're not a woman
who has to deal with it." It's tempting
because the level of ignorance is so high,
AND the power of women who have suf
fered sexual harassment is so arbitrary.
The core issue of sexual harassment is
POWER and the abuse of that power. It's
easy for those who are in positions of
power to be conveniently ignorant of the
ways in which they benefit from their
power over others. It's easy to forget that
the motivation which subordinates
respond to is the knowledge that those in
power can destroy their livelihood.
Allow me to use a rather crude illus
tration in describing the power dynamic:
There was a person who had a habit of
holding a very sharp and pointed knife in
his hand while discussing projects, deci
sions and assignments. Everyone who
worked under him knew they could get
cut by this knife.
The biggest danger was the careless way
that he waved the knife around. He was
unaware of the fear and danger that the
knife created in his subordinates. Some
people who worked under him had acciden
tally gotten cut by the knife as he waved it

around unaware. But they had no recourse.
When told he had cut people with his
careless knife-waving, the man acted sur
prised. He said he never intended to cut
anyone; they simply must have gotten in
the way. After this the people knew that
they had to do their jobs well while also
deftly dodging the path of the waving
knife. The man was adamant that his
knife-waving was not meant to cut people;
it was just part of his job to wield the knife.
Power can be like that man's knife. It
is most easily seen and understood by
people who do not have it and who run
the risk of being hurt by it. Power, like
the knife, can be used for positive and
productive ends, or for negative and
destructive ends. The worst thing about
power is that the ones who have it can
believe they have the luxury of exercising
that power with no regard for responsi
bility, respect, humility or fairness.
Sexual harassment draws such heated
debates because using the power of male
ness to exercise control over femaleness
is a dynamic that many do not want to
label sexist. And until we can use the
words "sexism" and "gender discrimina
tion" to identify the knife in the hands of
those who are abusing power, we will
make little progress, and the appalling
levels of ignorance will remain intact.
