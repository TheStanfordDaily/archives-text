## Conflict in Haiti: When will the bloodbath cease? 
### 
WHEN THE HAITIAN MASSES
voted Jean-Bertrand Aristide
into power last year in Haiti's
first truly democratic election, many
believed that he could turn around a
long history of carnage, political corrup
tion, poverty, incompetence and instabil
ity. But now we aren't so sure the coun
try's 187-year tradition of bloody politi
cal takeover attempts has indeed come
to an end.
The audacious coup d'etat of Sept. 29
took many people by surprise despite
recurrent political violence. Particularly
striking was the fact that the same army
commanders who instituted the coup

also played a crucial role in insuring the
smooth conduct of Haiti's first-ever
democratic election.
This incident has left many worried
that the winds of democracy blowing
throughout Latin America have yet to
reach Haiti.
Aristide — who won the election as a
champion of the poor — faced his worst
criticism from Haiti's less-than-enthusi
astic business elite. Many of them bene
fited from bribeiy, drug trafficking and
cheap labor and were suspicious of Aris
tide's reform plan and worried about the
country's shattered economy.
A priest turned a political neophyte,

Aristide had made some progress in car
rying out his campaign promise to rid
Haiti of widespread corruption. In spite
of these changes, however, Haiti's power
structure remains more or less the same.
Since the coup, the army has killed
hundreds of unarmed people and contin
ues this daily rampage.
Haiti desperately needs external sup
port to end these senseless massacres.
While President Bush is saying the Unit
ed States doesn't have to send the
Marines to Haiti, people are falling like
mosquitoes under the army savagery.
How long can those brutalized Haitians
endure this alone? Where is Bush's new

world order now?
While Aristide's popular support
remains strong, he has nonetheless
alienated many segments of the popula
tion with his acrimonious speeches. I
hope the democratic process will contin
ue with the exiled president's return to
power so that he can avoid past mistakes
and unify all Haitians.
Haiti will be celebrating its bicenten
nial of independence during the next
decade. Will history be forced to forgive
us, or will Haiti be free at last?
