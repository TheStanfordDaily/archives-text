# The arts at Stanford provide for a balanced liberal arts education
## 
### 
I am appalled, but not surprised, to
learn of the University's plan to cut a
long list of arts programs, including
music, performing arts and drama. The
arts are an easy mark; the uninformed
easily assert that the arts contribute lit
tle. Stanford produces few musicians
who become wealthy and donate build
ings. The Music and Drama Depart
ments are not world-famous.
The rhetoric, however, is false. The
arts profit Stanford. The arts lend gloss
and balance to everything the University
does, helping Stanford to attract the
best students, faculty and staff. Count
less star high school seniors — in all
fields, not just music — have chosen
Stanford over technical institutes such
as MIT because Stanford's thriving arts
programs permit students to obtain a
true liberal-arts education. The students
have become alumni and have contribut
ed $1.1 billion to the Centennial Cam
paign.

Stanford threatens to behave as
declining institutions classically behave:
ignoring the arts' vast long-run benefits
for small short-run savings. Cutting the
arts not only creates a dreary, Philistine
Stanford, but also costs Stanford money
and causes it to fall to the second tier of
institutions, behind Harvard and Yale.
