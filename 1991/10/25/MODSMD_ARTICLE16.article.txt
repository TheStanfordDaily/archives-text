# Changes in calculus keep Stanford on the cutting edge of math
## 
### 
It is unfortunate that such an unrep
resentative picture of the fresh and
innovative approach to the teaching of
calculus instituted by our department
last fall has been presented ("Not the
same old calculus," The Daily, Oct. 16).
This is part of a nationwide move
ment to reform the teaching of calculus
to make it leaner, livelier and more rele
vant to real-life problems. This new pro
gram also takes advantage of the amaz
ing progress in computational technolo
gy, which can put exceptionally powerful

and versatile calculators into each stu
dent's hands.
These calculators relieve students
from the drudgery of numerical and rou
tine symbolic calculations and take the
pain out of plotting and graphing. Howev
er, no instrument or method, new or old,
can relieve us of the necessity to think.
Students who want to be spoon-fed
formulas for the solution of "typical"
exercises in order to pass routine exams
are cheating themselves of the enormous
intellectual resources that mathematics
has to offer. There are no formulas for
real life.
Of course, there are all sorts of for
mulas and routine techniques that still
have to be learned, but they're of no use
without real understanding of what they
mean and how and where they're to be
applied â€” and that's what the "new cal
culus" is all about.
The Mathematics Department is
putting its very best and most enthusi
astic faculty and teaching assistants
behind this effort. I encourage students
to approach what's offered with an open
mind and a willingness to give their best
effort in return.
