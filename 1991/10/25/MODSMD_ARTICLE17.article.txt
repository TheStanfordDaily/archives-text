# Cowell does not decide who is eligible for domestic partner status
## 
### 
In his letter to The Daily (Oct. 17),
Willy Inboden raised some questions
about how domestic-partners status is
defined or monitored by Cowell Student
Health Center.
Cowell does not decide who qualifies
as a domestic partner, but only honors
the spouse/domestic partner cards that
are issued by the Office of the Registrar.
Furthermore, the cost of any insurance
policy would be borne by the individuals,
not by the University or the student
body at large.
The current policy available to spous
es through Stanford is not available to
domestic partners at any reasonable pre
mium. We are examining a proposal by
another company that will offer coverage
for students and their partners at a sat
isfactory cost.
