# Men's support group called useful
## 
### Scott Handleman 
Men who are "curious about ques
tions of sexuality and spirituality" and
who hope to "better understand the
world and themselves" now have a
support group to discuss these issues,
said Cowell staff psychologist Douglas
Daher, the group's facilitator.
Men, Sexuality and Spirituality
was founded in 1984 under the aus
pices of (Howell's Counseling and Psy
chological Services.
The support group — which meets

90 minutes per week — focuses on
masculinity fall quarter, sexuality
winter quarter and spirituality dur
ing the spring, according to Daher.
Many men have "never had an
opportunity as men to talk about
these issues," said Daher. He claimed
that men rarely have a chance to talk
openly in a "trusting group" because
society imposes "rigidity in the way
they have to be."
"Peer messages and peer pressure
not to be" honest and vulnerable are
widespread, he said, adding that

many men are "suspicious about the
kind of people who might show up"
at the discussions. Topics range from
family relationships to friendship
and sexual relations.
He emphasized that Men, Sexuali
ty and Spirituality is "not specifically
a group focused for homosexual men,
nor specifically a group focused for
heterosexual men."
Daher said women are able to
organize largely because they feel
politically and socially vulnerable.
"The men's movement is much
more invisible than the women's
movement," he added.
Still, the male "power base" fails
to serve men "any more than peo
ple left out of it," because it impos
es unreasonable social expectations
on them, Daher said. The support
group aims to free men from some
of these expectations.
Although some women are
"suspicious" of the aims of the

national men's movement,
women on campus are "pretty
supportive" of men's self-exami
nation, Daher said. He added that
some men even joined the group
at the advice of their girlfriends in
past years.
Daher repeatedly stressed that
Men, Sexuality and Spirituality is
not a "therapy group" aiming to
help men with emotional or psy
chological difficulties.
Because Daher does not main
tain contact with former mem
bers of the group, he acknowl
edged that determining the pro
gram's long-term influence on
them is difficult. Still, he said

"there is a lot of bonding that
takes place" as a result of partici
pation and participants "learn to
appreciate the atmosphere of
trusting other guys."
One group alumnus, senior
Omar Wasow, said participation
was meaningful to him because it
provided him the opportunity to
"talk with men in a personal,
thoughtful way. . . about masculin
ity, sexuality (and) race" and "got a
lot of feedback as well," he said.
Wasow added that member
ship enabled him to "explore a lot
of questions" and "better define
who I am." He said he highly rec
ommends participation to others.
