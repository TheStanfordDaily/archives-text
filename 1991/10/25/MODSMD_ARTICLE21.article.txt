## Practice makes perfect Chris Walsh's hard work pays off with receptions, TDs 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
What does it take to be Stanford's
number-one target?
For Cardinal wide receiver Chris
Walsh, the answer to this question is
simple: hard work.
"I'm a firm believer that there's real
ly no substitute for hard work," Walsh
said. "Basically, the harder you work,
the luckier you get and also the better
you get, and I try to get better every
day."
After entering Stanford as a redshirt
freshman in 1987, Walsh did indeed
improve consistently throughout his
first four seasons on the Farm. This
year he has moved into the starting
wide receiver position and has estab
lished himself as one of the outstanding
receivers in college football.
The six-foot-one-inch, 185-pound
senior from Concord, Calif, is currently
the Pacific 10 Conference leader and is
third in the nation in both receptions
per game (7.2) and receiving yardage
per game (109.3).
Walsh's most recent spectacular per
formance was at the Los Angeles Coli
seum against USC, where he caught
nine passes for a career-high 174 yards
and two touchdowns. It was the first
two-touchdown game of his career, and
his 174 receiving yards is the fifth high
est single game performance in Stan
ford history.
His second touchdown came with
1:11 left to play, as Walsh connected
with quarterback Steve Stenstrom's
pass from 12 yards out. It was the
game-winning touchdown, and it was
one of the most exciting catches of
Walsh's career.
"It was pretty exciting catching that
second touchdown against USC and
beating those guys for the first time
since I've been here," Walsh said.
Receiver coach Brian Billick
attributes much of Walsh's success to
his "football speed".
"Chris really surprised a lot of people
at the USC game, outrunning those

guys," Billick said. "Chris has great
football speed. He would have a tough
time competing with those guys on a
track, but football is not a straight-line
race.
"It's a matter of cuts and turns. His
has the ability to take that hitch, turn
and literally outrun some of those ath
letes that have better speed."
Stenstrom, the new starting quarter
back, feels that Walsh's emerging tal
ents have been a key factor in the recent
success of the Cardinal offense.
"Chris has got really good quickness
on the ball," Stenstrom said. "His abili
ty to beat defenders has really helped
him out this year. He gets real good
releases from the line of scrimmage,
and he runs very precise routes."
"Steve relies a lot on Chris because
of his experience, things he's done, the
numbers he's putting up, the productiv
ity," Billick said. "What he means to the
offense is obviously a great deal."
Although Walsh's success as wide
receiver has only recently attracted
attention to his progress, Walsh regards
his development in college football as a
continual process of hard work and
determination.
"Development is an everyday thing,"
Walsh said. "It's not something that
happens overnight. It has been done
through hard work, through practice,
and through getting stronger and
faster."
The Cardinal coaching staff is quick
to praise Walsh's stringent work ethic.
Billick describes Walsh's approach to
football as comprehensive and intense.

"Whether it's film study, getting his
head into the playbook, analysis of his
opponent, working extra after practice
with the quarterback to really nail
down that relationship between a quar
terback and receiver, whatever it takes,
he will do," Billick said. "You appreciate
that very much as a coach when some
one is willing to give that kind of
effort."
While Walsh has emerged as the Car
dinal's main threat down the field,
there has been considerable pressure on
him to do so since he took over the
starting wide receiver spot vacated by
First-Team AU-American Ed McCaf
frey. McCaffrey, now playing now play
ing for the New York Giants, is consid
ered to be one of the top receivers in
Stanford history. Can the two be com
pared?
"Obviously they're different in
stature," Billick said. "Where Ed had
legitimate pro size, if not better, had
legitimate pro speed, he was a high focal
point for the pro people. Chris doesn't
have those individual talents, but
because of his work ethic, competitive
ness and drive, he has easily been out
producing McCaffrey."
With Walsh following in McCaffrey's
footsteps, the possibility of being draft
ed hovers in the horizon. Head coach
Denny Green is confident of Walsh's
chances to go pro.
"I think he will (go pro)," Green said.
"If he keeps up the pace he's going now.
He's attracting a lot of attention. Peo-

playing."
Walsh, however, is taking one
day at a time and one game at a
time. "I try not to think too much
about it (the NFL) now because
I'm afraid it will take my focus
away from what I need to do to
get better," Walsh said. "I just
want to focus on the season."
Walsh's greatest edge on the
competition lies in his positive
attitude, dedication and work
ethic.
"He really wants to be a good
football player," Green said. "If
there's one guy on the team who
shows ti e willingness to pay the
price, that brings a lot of intensi
ty and in the same sense enjoys
playing the game, that would be

his development in college football as a
continual process of hard work and
determination.
"Development is an everyday thing,"
Walsh said. "It's not something that
happens overnight. It has been done
through hard work, through practice,
and through getting stronger and
faster."
The Cardinal coaching staff is quick
to praise Walsh's stringent work ethic.
Billick describes Walsh's approach to
football as comprehensive and intense.

"Whether it's film study, getting his
head into the playbook, analysis of his
opponent, working extra after practice
with the quarterback to really nail
down that relationship between a quar
terback and receiver, whatever it takes,
he will do," Billick said. "You appreciate
that very much as a coach when some
one is willing to give that kind of
effort."
While Walsh has emerged as the Car
dinal's main threat down the field,
there has been considerable pressure on
him to do so since he took over the
starting wide receiver spot vacated by
First-Team AU-American Ed McCaf
frey. McCaffrey, now playing now play
ing for the New York Giants, is consid
ered to be one of the top receivers in
Stanford history. Can the two be com
pared?
"Obviously they're different in
stature," Billick said. "Where Ed had
legitimate pro size, if not better, had
legitimate pro speed, he was a high focal
point for the pro people. Chris doesn't
have those individual talents, but
because of his work ethic, competitive
ness and drive, he has easily been out
producing McCaffrey."
With Walsh following in McCaffrey's
footsteps, the possibility of being draft
ed hovers in the horizon. Head coach
Denny Green is confident of Walsh's
chances to go pro.
"I think he will (go pro)," Green said.
"If he keeps up the pace he's going now.
He's attracting a lot of attention. Peo-

playing."
Walsh, however, is taking one
day at a time and one game at a
time. "I try not to think too much
about it (the NFL) now because
I'm afraid it will take my focus
away from what I need to do to
get better," Walsh said. "I just
want to focus on the season."
Walsh's greatest edge on the
competition lies in his positive
attitude, dedication and work
ethic.
"He really wants to be a good
football player," Green said. "If
there's one guy on the team who
shows ti e willingness to pay the
price, that brings a lot of intensi
ty and in the same sense enjoys
playing the game, that would be
Chris Walsh."
What does it take to be Stanford's
number-one target?
For Cardinal wide receiver Chris
Walsh, the answer to this question is
simple: hard work.
"I'm a firm believer that there's real
ly no substitute for hard work," Walsh
said. "Basically, the harder you work,
the luckier you get and also the better
you get, and I try to get better every
day."
After entering Stanford as a redshirt
freshman in 1987, Walsh did indeed
improve consistently throughout his
first four seasons on the Farm. This
year he has moved into the starting
wide receiver position and has estab
lished himself as one of the outstanding
receivers in college football.
The six-foot-one-inch, 185-pound
senior from Concord, Calif, is currently
the Pacific 10 Conference leader and is
third in the nation in both receptions
per game (7.2) and receiving yardage
per game (109.3).
Walsh's most recent spectacular per
formance was at the Los Angeles Coli
seum against USC, where he caught
nine passes for a career-high 174 yards
and two touchdowns. It was the first
two-touchdown game of his career, and
his 174 receiving yards is the fifth high
est single game performance in Stan
ford history.
His second touchdown came with
1:11 left to play, as Walsh connected
with quarterback Steve Stenstrom's
pass from 12 yards out. It was the
game-winning touchdown, and it was
one of the most exciting catches of
Walsh's career.
"It was pretty exciting catching that
second touchdown against USC and
beating those guys for the first time
since I've been here," Walsh said.
Receiver coach Brian Billick
attributes much of Walsh's success to
his "football speed".
"Chris really surprised a lot of people
at the USC game, outrunning those

guys," Billick said. "Chris has great
football speed. He would have a tough
time competing with those guys on a
track, but football is not a straight-line
race.
"It's a matter of cuts and turns. His
has the ability to take that hitch, turn
and literally outrun some of those ath
letes that have better speed."
Stenstrom, the new starting quarter
back, feels that Walsh's emerging tal
ents have been a key factor in the recent
success of the Cardinal offense.
"Chris has got really good quickness
on the ball," Stenstrom said. "His abili
ty to beat defenders has really helped
him out this year. He gets real good
releases from the line of scrimmage,
and he runs very precise routes."
"Steve relies a lot on Chris because
of his experience, things he's done, the
numbers he's putting up, the productiv
ity," Billick said. "What he means to the
offense is obviously a great deal."

receiver has only recently attracted
attention to his progress, Walsh regards
his development in college football as a
continual process of hard work and
determination.
