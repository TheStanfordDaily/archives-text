# Football vs. Oregon State
## 
### 
SATURDAY — Radio: KZSU (90.1 FM) with Pat Broun and Jeff Stollenwerck. 12:30 kickoff
at Stanford Stadium.
RECORDS — Stanford (1-2, 3-3 overall), Oregon State (0-3, 0-6 overall)
NOTES — With no completions last week against UCLA, OSU's five-foot-eight-inch fresh
man quarterback Mark Olford should not be much of a threat to the huge Cardinal
defense. The Beavers have lost eleven consecutive games and have not won on the road
for two years. Stanford, however, has reached .500 for the first time under head coach
Denny Green. Starting quarterback Steve Stenstrom also proved he could get the job
done in last week's impressive victory over USC.
