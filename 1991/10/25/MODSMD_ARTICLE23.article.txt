The Stanford women's volleyball team faces
not one, but two of its greatest challenges this
weekend. The No. 1 Cardinal faces Pacific 10 Con
ference foes Washington and No. 19 Washington
State this Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
While many people would argue that last week
end's road matches against traditional rivals USC
and UCLA were Stanford's most difficult contests,
coach Don Shaw feels that the Cardinal must
work to avoid a dangerous lapse of intensity after
its emotional sweep.
"We had a good weekend in Los Angeles, and
we're happy to be in the position it put us in, but
that's all ancient history now," Shaw said. "We're
trying to guard against a letdown this weekend."
Tonight Washington comes to town to face the
Cardinal juggernaut. The Huskies are currently
12-8 overall and 3-6 in the Pac-10. On Sept. 28
Stanford defeated Washington in Seattle in three
games, 15-11, 15-4, 16-14, led by junior Bev
Oden's 20 kills, 10 digs, seven blocks and .461 hit
ting percentage. The Washington player to watch
for is Dawn Austin, who leads the team with 246
kills and a .256 hitting percentage.
Stanford faces Washington State on Saturday
night in what will certainly be a greater challenge
for the Cardinal. The Lady Cougars are currently
fourth in the Pac-10 with a 19-6 overall record, 6-
3 in conference play. Three hitters on the squad
have over 300 kills, and Washington State has a
Pac-10 best .301 team hitting percentage. At their
last meeting, though, Stanford had one of its best
overall matches as they shut down the Cougars

THIS WEEKEND — Tonight: 7:30 p.m. vs. Washing
ton. Saturday: 7:30 p.m. vs. No. 19 Washington
State. Both games are at Burnham Pavilion. KZSU
(90.1 FM) will have live coverage with Rick Seidel
and Chris Crader.
NOTES — No. 1 Stanford is in fine shape for the
Northwest duo. Setter Carrie Feldman, who injured
her ankle last week, is expected to start Friday.
Although the Cardinal soundly defeated both
teams earlier in the season, the Cougars have not
lost a single game on the road.

15-4, 15-9, 15-5 while outhitting them .462 to
.078.
"Washington State is really strong," Shaw said.
"They haven't lost on the road yet. They're play
ing well and they'll be tough."
For the Cardinal, Shaw said that junior setter
Carrie Feldman, who injured her ankle last week
in practice and sat out the USC game last Friday,
should start for Stanford this weekend.
Stanford extended its record to 17-0 last week,
the best start in school history and the second
longest overall streak. The record is 20 consecu
tive wins by the 1988 team in the middle of the
season.
The Stanford crowd at UCLA was really loud
and supportive, and Shaw hopes to see more of the
same against Washington and Washington State.
"We'd like to get a good crowd out this weekend
to have some fun," Shaw said.
Both matches this weekend will be broadcast by
KZSU 90.1 FM. Rick Seidel will do play-by-play
and Chris Crader will do the color commentary.
