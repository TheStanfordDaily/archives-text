# Belmont stakes high for polo
## No.6 Stanford takes on the nation's toughest 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
The last time the Stanford
Water Polo team was at the Long
Beach Belmont Plaza Pool was
last year in the NCAA tourna
ment when the No. 2-ranked Car
dinal lost in the championship
game. This weekend in the annu
al 49ers Invitational Tourna
ment, Stanford will find itself in
the same exact pool, only this
time the situation has changed
just a little bit.
To start with, this year's team
has struggled so far to an 8-8
overall record. But even more
importantly, this year's team may
not even make it into the NCAA
championships.
Indeed, if the Cardinal is to
come back to Long Beach later
this year, the team needs to have
an incredibly impressive showing
this weekend in Long Beach
where the top 16 teams in the
country will be assembled.
With only five California teams
permitted to be in the national
tournament, the No. 6-ranked
Cardinal needs to come up with
some big wins over higher
ranked opponents if it does not
want to become only the second
Stanford team to fail to qualify
for NCAA's in the last 17 years.
Last weekend's win over then-

for us. We need to
win at least three
out of the four
games.'

be Saturday at 9 a.m. against No.
12 Air Force, the highest-ranked
team from outside of California.
The game figures to be an easy
victory for his team, but Detta
manti is still not going to take any
chances. "We'll play this game
like it's an NCAA tournament
game," he said. "Because if we
lose this one, we've really got no
hope."
If Stanford wins this game, the
next likely opponent will be No. 3
UCLA, the same team the Cardi
nal just barely lost to last Friday
by a score of 8-7. Despite the loss,
Dettamanti feels his team has a
great chance to upset UCLA.
"After the UCLA game, we
really felt that we could have and
should have won it, and I think
everyone now knows that we can
beat them," said Dettamanti.
Stanford will play two more
games on Sunday, and as Detta
manti said, "After this weekend,
we'll pretty much know what our
season is going to look like."
And they'll also know if they're
going to go back to Long Beach.

No. 6 USC was a huge step in the
right direction, but as coach Dante
Dettamanti said, "You can't get
too excited about one win. We still
have a long way to go."
Maybe so, but this weekend's
tournament will play an enor
mous role in determining Stan
ford's fate. As the team's leading
scorer, freshman Wolf Wigo, said,
"This is basically it for us. We
need to win at least three out of
the four games. Before last week
end, it didn't look too good for
this year, but now we know we
still have a chance to make
NCAA's."
The Cardinal's first game will
