# NCAA bid hangs on men's soccer roadtrip
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team travels to southern Califor
nia today, embarking on their
most crucial road trip of the 1991
season.
Unbeaten since a 4-1 loss to
Portland University Sept. 22, the
No. 29 Cardinal (9-2-4) is still in
the hunt for its first NCAA Tour
nament bid since 1978. Tonight,
they face No. 12 UCLA, before
traveling to San Diego State on
Sunday. These two games could
well determine their postseason
status.
"Every game looms larger as we
get towards the end of the season,"
said Stanford coach Colin Lin
dores. "This weekend, we will find
out a lot about our team."
The Bruins, currently ranked
third in the Division I West region
and No. 14 in the nation, defeated
Stanford 2-1 in overtime last sea
son en route to the 1990 NCAA

championship. UCLA will be the
eighth top 20 opponent that the
Cardinal has faced this year.
Like Stanford, the Bruins'
strength is a possession-oriented
attack, with an emphasis on back
ward control passing and solid
goalkeeping. "They like to play the
way we like to play," said Lindores.
"It'll be a great game."
While it would certainly be nice
to upset UCLA on the road, the
San Diego State game is more
essential to Cardinal playoff hopes.
The Aztecs are tied with Stanford
for sixth place in the West, and it is
extremely unlikely that more than
six western clubs will be chosen for
postseason action.
"San Diego is an important
encounter for us," Lindores said.
While UCLA is almost guaran
teed a playoff spot, I see San Diego
as a team where a (playoff) slot
could come down to between them
and us. I look at the San Diego
State game as more crucial than
UCLA."
