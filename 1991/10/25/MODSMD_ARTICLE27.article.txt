# Card heads for border, challenges SMU, TCU
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
Well, the Stanford women's soc
cer team's got a hankerin' for a cou
ple more wins, and this weekend,
they're a-headin' down to the Lone
Star State to try and rustle 'em up.
The Cardinal will square off
against Southern Methodist
tomorrow at 1 p.m. and Texas
Christian on Sunday in the TCU
tournament.
The SMU game will be the last
in a murderous stretch in which
the Cardinal has played nothing
but top 15 teams for six straight
games.
Although its record is a
mediocre 7-6, Southern Methodist
is ranked No. 13 in the nation as a
result of its hard-fought losses
against top-flight national compe
tition. It has played a schedule
comparable to Stanford's in diffi
culty, but instead of emerging vie

toriouß, SMU has a number of one
goal defeats to show for its efforts,
most notably against No. 1-ranked
North Carolina.
After the SMU game, Stanford
has a somewhat less challenging
opponent in host Texas Christian.
The Horned Frogs are 3-7-3 on the
season and will have considerable
difficulty containing the potent
Stanford attack.
Hopefully, the Cardinal will
explode out of its offensive slump.
Since a 5-0 thrashing of Duke, the
team has managed just six goals in
five games, three by sophomore
Sarah Rafanelli. Stanford has been
outshot by its opponents in the last
two games.
"I hope [the women's team] gets
some big goals this weekend," said
Andrew Goldberg, one of a growing
number of self-proclaimed No. 1
fans of the women's soccer team.
"But then again, everything's big
in Texas."
