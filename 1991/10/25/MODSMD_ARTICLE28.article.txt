### Tish Williams

end in the Stanford Intercollegiate women's golf
tournament on the Stanford Golf Course.
Five of the top six-rated-teams in the nation
will compete today, Saturday and Sunday on
Stanford's par 73 course.
The No. 1-ranked University of Arizona will
bring its astounding team to the Farm, led by
Annika Sorenstram, winner of last week's Wash
ington Intercollegiate.
San Jose State will come up hoping to avenge
its defeat in the Sun Devil Invitational two weeks
ago at the hands of the U of A.
San Jose State's Lisa Walton, who won the Sun
Devil tourney, will be going for the win, hoping to
fend off Sorenstram once again.
Stanford received a pre-season ranking of sixth
in the nation, behind UCLA and Tulsa. No. 3-
ranked Georgia is not participating in the Stan
ford Intercollegiate.
"Our course is one of the toughest in the coun
try. Other teams play our course a lot, but it's
always a challenge for them," said coach Tim

Baldwin.
The Stanford team will be looking to pull their
game together, surpass USC and stay in the big
money.
Stanford tied for second with USC at the Wash
ington Intercollegiate, but definitely has the
potential to leave USC behind this weekend and
concentrate on the top five teams.
"We have a strong veteran lineup, all five of
them can really hit the ball well," Baldwin said.
"Any of our five starters have a chance to win the
individual title."
After finishing seventh at the Lady Sun Devil
and tying for second in Seattle, golfmg on their
home course gives Stanford an opportunity to
prove themselves to the nation this weekend.
"They've all been practicing very hard, playing
very hard, and their games all look good to me,"
Baldwin said. "If it happens to be their week,
watch out.
"We'll have 18 terrific teams on our champi
onship golf course all the teams look forward to
coming here and playing. It's one of the favorite
courses (in the U.S.) because it's so beautiful and
tough."
