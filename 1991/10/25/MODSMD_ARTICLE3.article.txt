Lucius Barker, a Stanford
political science professor, was
recently elected president of the
American Political Science Associ
ation.
He is the second African-Amer

history of the association, which
has 13,000 members. He will take
over as president next year, and
oversee the APSA's activities,
which include the publication of

"We're trying to make the (politi

with the change in demograph

Barker said he is an advocate of
affirmative action, believing that
it is necessary "in order to
address serious imbalances and
inequities. "According to Barker,
many social evils have been per
petrated by official government

On this issue, he disagrees

"It seems to me," said Barker,
"that he, too, determined that
racism is still alive, and unfortu

Barker, who did his post-doc
torate work in law and political
science at Harvard Law School,
has specialized in the study of the
Supreme Court's role in the
American political system.
He teaches classes in judicial
politics and constitutional law,
conducted using the Socratic
method popular in law schools.
Barker joined the Stanford fac
ulty in July 1990. He has also
been a professor at Harvard and
Washington University in St.
Louis.
