# It's never too late for lofts
## 
### 
Now that the quarter has actually gotten under
way, it's about time to get your act together
and build a loft.
Not that you really need one or anything, but once
you get caught up in this sort of procrastination, the
tendency is to push it as far as it can go. So, this week
I thought I'd provide a complete, step-by-step, do-it
yourself guide for transforming your confining,
squalid, standard room into a confining, squalid, archi
tectural nightmare.
As it turns out, this is the perfect time to do this

since the Stanford Safety Inspectors
(Motto: It's never too late to turn
anal) have recently finished their
campus-wide loft inspection tour.
Yes, strange men with names like
Vince Lumpkin have been going
through your room, searching for
anything out of the ordinaiy, such as
crude spiral staircases winding up
through the newly-cut hole in the
ceiling. I can see them now, rooting
through the fridge in search of clev-

erly hidden earthquake hazards and thoughtfully
removing dangerous objects such as imported beer.
But if you're smart, you have waited until now to
try any home-improvement projects, so that you won't
have to pay these guys huge sums of money to have
your room ripped apart.
So, now that they're gone, the first thing you need
to do is to decide exactly what type of loft you are inter
ested in. As you may be aware, the University has set
down very specific rules concerning the permitted
dimensions of your loft. You should carefully rip those
rules into tiny pieces and feed them to the squirrels.
In terms of the actual design, my suggestion is to
have somewhere between six and nine support posts,
with a couple of crossbars thrown in so that the first
minor earthquake doesn't send your bed crashing
down in a twisted, mangled heap of splinters and nails,
an event that has been known to disrupt all but the
most intense sexual encounters.
Once you find some building materials, it's time for
the most dangerous part of loft-building: moving your
bed. Not that your bed frame is particularly heavy, but
by this time of year a huge number of various unmen
tionable objects have collected underneath it. Suddenly
exposing this organic mass to light can have catas
trophic effects, often resulting in a mini-nuclear explo
sion similar to the one that took place in the East Bay
last weekend.
During my last lofting experience, I discovered that
hammering isn't as easy at it looks. I'm sure the guys
at the hardware store must have gotten a pretty good
laugh out of selling me those hollow nails that bent
like wet noodles when I tried to hammer them in.
A piece of advice: Pad the underside of the loft with
some sort of flammable carpeting. I knew this girl once,
who, despite constant negative reinforcement, consis
tently clunked her head while moving about the room,
and now she can't say any words with an "S" in them.
Hopefully you will eventually create some sort of
dangerous structure lurking in the center of the room,
looking like an ME 101 project gone horribly awry.
And if, by some miracle, the loft stays up when you
let go of it, you can step back from your creation, let
out a big sigh of relief and start figuring out how in the
world you're ever going to get the door open again.
That's all there is to it. And don't wony yourself
about getting it apart at the end of the year. Your
friendly fire marshall will probably get there first.

Ken Wharton is rather upset that you can't run
through the sprinklers anymore without ending up
smelling like a sewage-treatment plant.
