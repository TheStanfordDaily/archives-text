# Grads can 'go green'
## New corps trains environmental activists 
### Carla Martin 
Being green just got easier.
Young people can now learn to
save the planet while earning a
paycheck â€” through a new orga
nization that trains college gradu
ates to become environmental
coordinators.
The 6-month-old Green Corps
will provide the environmental
movement with skilled organiz
ers, regional coordinator Steffanie
Clothier told a group of students
Wednesday at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center.
"By being able to provide
grassroots resources, then we
really could win" the battle to
save the environment, she said.
Forty-five college graduates
will be selected nationwide to
become the first group of activists
trained by Green Corps beginning
August 1992.
The program is designed to

provide students with skills for
mobilizing citizens, developing
legislative strategies, working
with the media, directing educa
tional campaigns and raising
funds, she said. After a year some
Green Corps graduates work as
trainers or, with the help of Green
Corps, find employment with an
environmental organization.
Green Corps will pay $12,500
for one year of training.
Clothier said that while class
room education makes up part of
the 40-60 hour work week, practi
cal training is also a significant
facet of the program. By working
on a variety of campaigns, stu
dents can compare different
strategies and techniques for
their effectiveness.
Students will work on different
campaigns depending on the
region they choose. Students will
dents can compare different
strategies and techniques for

Students will work on different
campaigns depending on the region
thev choose. Students will be able

to select from four regions: the
west, mid-west, south and north
east. Once the student selects a
region, he or she can choose from
three cities within that area.
Clothier said Green Corps has
received start-up funds from pri
vate organizations, but after
three years will earn money by
charging environmental groups
for consulting work.
