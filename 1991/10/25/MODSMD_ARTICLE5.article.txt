# Faculty grill Kennedy on budget decisions

Faculty grilled University President Donald
Kennedy on a wide array of budget issues dur
ing yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting — the
first since Tuesday's announcement of a
deficit-reduction plan.
Faculty did not ask Kennedy about the bud
get-reduction targets assigned to Stanford's
schools. Instead they focused their comments
on the so-called "central initiatives" and
encouraged the use of restricted funds to allevi
ate the operating-budget deficit.
After the meeting, Kennedy said he was not
surprised by the lack of questions on the actual
reduction targets because "everybody under
stands that the process by which the targets
were set was exhaustive."
Several faculty questioned the University
Cabinet's decision not to increase undergradu

ate enrollment, an idea suggested by the sen
ate's task force on revenue enhancement.
Kennedy said the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning had studied the
idea in detail and decided a large increase would
not be a fruitful way to alleviate the budget
deficit.
"Although there are some gains to be had
from a 4 to 5 percent increase in the student
body, none of us was confident that it would
justify the change in undergraduate student
life that it would bring about," he said.
Kennedy added that much of the increased
tuition revenue would be eaten up by financial
aid grants to the additional students and by the
extra cost of supporting a larger student body.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl questioned
the proposal that the income of non-custodial
parents be included in the evaluation of finan
cial need for children of divorced parents. She
said such a change would pose a
hardship For single parents and
for children who are estranged
from a parent. •
Financial Aids Director Robert
Huff said such cases aren't easy
for the financial aids office. "You
have to go almost case-by-case,
talk to the families and get into
some issues that aren't pleasant,"
he said.
Huff said the proposal is "just
an example of some of the things
that we could look at."
Kennedy said most of the
schools with which Stanford com
petes for undergraduates —
including Harvard, Dartmouth
and Brown — already include the
income of non-custodial parents
in determining financial need.
Kennedy also clarified the
ground rules under which Over
seas Studies will be expected to
cut $400,000 from its $3.2 million
budget — rules that may discour
age the closing of overseas cam
puses.
"The Overseas Studies pro
gram will not be permitted to
count as reductions students that
are simply sent away," he said.
The savings made by cutting a
campus "will be netted against
repatriation costs," he said.
Kennedy also responded to fac
ulty criticism about development
activities. Chemistry Prof. James
Collman and others expressed
concern over the Office of Devel
opment's use of unrestricted oper
ating funds to raise gifts that usu
ally produce restricted income.
"It's true that it costs eight or
nine cents (of operating budget

funds) to raise a dollar (of gifts),"
Kennedy said. He added that
methods of applying gifts to the
operating budget are "being
aggressively explored."
"The list of objectives of devel
opment now includes more oper
ating-budget relieving activities
than it once did," Kennedy said.
At the beginning of the meet
ing, Kennedy announced that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences will work closely with a spe
cial liaison team in selecting actu-

al deficit reductions because it has
a "special challenge and special
situation."
"It is a large school that is espe
cially central to many students,"
he explained. "It has a large bud
get but also a large number of
units that are each small."
But Kennedy said the schools
and administrative areas "will
have to go beyond the liaison
groups" and work with more stu
dents, faculty and staff. "We

haven't attempted to prescribe
the rules for everyone because
they all have different situa
tions," he said.
In response to questioning from
the ASSU Council of Presidents
member Beth Morgan, Kennedy
also said the Nominations Com
mission should be circumvented
for student appointments to com
mittees working on the budget.
"Nom Com may not have a firm
grasp on who is knowledgeable"
about a specific department or
administrative service, Kennedy
said.
The senate also accepted
reports from the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids and the Commit
tee on Graduate Studies.
The senate had an acrimonious
discussion over the decentraliza
tion of the administration of grad
uate studies, which was complet
ed under "repositioning" last
spring.
"This was one of the gravest
administrative mistakes in recent
years," said English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz. "The decentralization of
graduate studies has produced
administrative chaos."
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
added that he has "not heard one
faculty member stand up and say
that the decentralization of gradu
ate studies was a good thing, or
that it proved to be less expensive."
Kennedy said people "recog
nize aspects of the process that
have not been done well," adding
that "if it can be shown that this
would be better centralized, then
it should" be returned to its previ
ous form.
But he warned that faculty
members should distinguish
between transitional difficulties
and permanent problems.
