Faculty grilled University President Donald
Kennedy on a wide array of budget issues dur
ing yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting â€” the
first since Tuesday's announcement of a
deficit-reduction plan.
Faculty did not ask Kennedy about the bud
get-reduction targets assigned to Stanford's
schools. Instead they focused their comments
on the so-called "central initiatives" and
encouraged the use of restricted funds to allevi
ate the operating-budget deficit.
After the meeting, Kennedy said he was not
surprised by the lack of questions on the actual
reduction targets because "everybody under
stands that the process by which the targets
were set was exhaustive."
Several faculty questioned the University
Cabinet's decision not to increase undergradu

ate enrollment, an idea suggested by the sen
ate's task force on revenue enhancement.
Kennedy said the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Planning had studied the
idea in detail and decided a large increase would
not be a fruitful way to alleviate the budget
deficit.
"Although there are some gains to be had
from a 4 to 5 percent increase in the student
body, none of us was confident that it would
justify the change in undergraduate student
life that it would bring about," he said.
Kennedy added that much of the increased
tuition revenue would be eaten up by financial
aid grants to the additional students and by the
extra cost of supporting a larger student body.
Political Science Prof. Terry Karl questioned
the proposal that the income of non-custodial
parents be included in the evaluation of finan
cial need for children of divorced parents. She
