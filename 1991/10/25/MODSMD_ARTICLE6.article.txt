# Federal grant extends Hum Bio Jr. program

The innovative educational arm of the
Human Biology Program gained a little muscle
yesterday.
The National Institute of Health gave an
educational project headed by Human Biology
Prof. Craig Heller a projected $700,000 grant to
bolster a science curriculum for seventh- and
eighth-grade students.
The grant will be used by the Middle-Grades
Life Science Project to develop a multimedia
educational tool to accompany an already
established written curriculum.
The curriculum — which is already funded
by the National Science Foundation and the
Carnegie Corporation — is based on Stanford's
Human Biology Program, said Mary Kiely,

associate director of the educational project.
But how can college level biology be taught
to 13-year-olds? According to Kiely, the cur
riculum mimics the concept — but not the
complexities — of Stanford's ground-breaking
human biology core.
"Adolescents are very egocentric, so the best
way to teach them science is to teach them
about themselves," she said.
The grant will enable the project to make
more tools like the "Science For Living" inter
active video, which project members produced a
few years ago. The video has been used in the
schools along with the written curriculum.
Kiely said the video allows students to view
the beating of a living heart to illustrate the
risk of heart attack. She described one video-lab
in which the student "goes
through a kitchen and can touch
on any food and learn its choles
terol and fat content."
This interaction, according to
Kiely, "allows the student to
become more of a participant
rather than just sitting and
absorbing a teacher's lecture."
The multimedia projects are
not only tools for students, but
also for teachers, she said. Accom
panied by the written curriculum,
these projects "provide a number
of different tools that allow the
teacher to tailor the lesson toward
a student population with diverse
needs. Some students learn better
from writing and some from visu
al aides," Kiely said.
She cited a study by a Stanford
graduate student using the "Sci
ence For Living" video in Colum
bus, Ohio. The study showed

that, with the help of multimedia,
an average student can gain a bet
ter understanding of material
than an above-average student
using only written materials.
Kiely said the multimedia pro
jects' usefulness as powerful
teaching tools is what impressed
the National Institutes of Health
and encouraged the organization
to give a Science Education Part
nership Award to the middle
grades project so it could continue
producing multimedia software.
Like the human biology core,
the curriculum is based on the
study of human physiology,
health needs and the behavioral
sciences; however, students study
these areas in terms of adolescent
development. Students learn
about the effect of drugs on the
nervous system or the effects of
peer pressure.
According to Kiely, students
enjoy learning science in this
manner, because it is not only
about them specifically, but also
about the human race in general.

"There are a lot of ways to
teach about genes rather than
talk about Mendel and his flies,"
she said. "You can teach them
about sickle cell anemia or com
mon family traits. In this way,
they can enter from the human
side and then learn the basis for
these issues and relate to them."
Project leaders have not yet
determined what sort of multime
dia project the grant will go
toward. "Technology is exploding
in this field," said Kiely. When we
made our proposal there was no
way to tell what technology would
be available to us when the grant
[was] released."
The award was granted based
on the example of the "Science of
Living" video, which was pro
duced in connection with Aca
demic Information Resources.
The new project will be produced
in conjunction with an indepen
dent producer whose staff will
cover the technical side while
Kiely and her collaborators pro
duce the learning materials.
