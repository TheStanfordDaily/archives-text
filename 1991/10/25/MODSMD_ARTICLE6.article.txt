The innovative educational arm of the
Human Biology Program gained a little muscle
yesterday.
The National Institute of Health gave an
educational project headed by Human Biology
Prof. Craig Heller a projected $700,000 grant to
bolster a science curriculum for seventh- and
eighth-grade students.
The grant will be used by the Middle-Grades
Life Science Project to develop a multimedia
educational tool to accompany an already
established written curriculum.
The curriculum — which is already funded
by the National Science Foundation and the
Carnegie Corporation — is based on Stanford's
Human Biology Program, said Mary Kiely,

associate director of the educational project.
But how can college level biology be taught
to 13-year-olds? According to Kiely, the cur
riculum mimics the concept — but not the
complexities — of Stanford's ground-breaking
human biology core.
"Adolescents are very egocentric, so the best
way to teach them science is to teach them
about themselves," she said.
The grant will enable the project to make
more tools like the "Science For Living" inter
active video, which project members produced a
few years ago. The video has been used in the
schools along with the written curriculum.
Kiely said the video allows students to view
the beating of a living heart to illustrate the
risk of heart attack. She described one video-lab
