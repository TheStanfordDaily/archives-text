# Twenty years of Bridging troubled waters

Many Stanford students are
familiar with the Bridge's übiq
uitous yellow stickers in dorm
bathrooms that read, "Nobody
has problems at Stanford? Yeah,
right."
But few are familiar with the
Bridge itself.
The reason for this is that the
counselors provides a "very
silent service," said Bridge
adviser Dr. Vincent D'Andrea.
"It is hard to appreciate the
work that they do."
Tria Hagenah, archive coordi
nator for the Bridge, agreed that
it is "often overlooked," but
added that the counseling ser
vice "is one that is used a lot
more than you would expect."
This year marks the Bridge's
20th anniversary, making it the
oldest independent peer-coun
seling group in the country.
Taking its name from the
Simon and Garfunkel song
"Bridge Over Troubled Water,"
the Bridge was initially designed
to address the "rampant drug
use" on campus, and later
became "one of the first places
where gay and lesbian students
could get support and counsel
ing," D'Andrea said.
From the beginning the
Bridge was conceived as a stu
dent organization, D'Andrea
said, noting that it remains an
independent student group.
This status means the center
must meet all of its own expens
es, and the students decide their
own priorities.
Today, the Bridge's goal is "to
foster community and growth,"
D'Andrea said. Since its incep
tion two decades ago, the Bridge
has expanded its services to
include a 24-hour peer counsel
ing hotline and various support
groups such as Alcoholics Anony
mous, Overeaters Anonymous

and the Coming Out Rap Group.
Workshops on relationships,
peer-counseling techniques and
massage are also offered in-house
to any dorm that requests them.
The center's sole fund-raiser
is the annual Spring Faire, an
arts, crafts and food festival held
in White Plaza.
To qualify as Bridge volun
teers, students are required to
take Psychology 167 A, a quar
ter-long peer counseling class

taught by D'Andrea. The class is
also for those who just want to
"learn to listen better," he said.
Students who want to work
at the Bridge are also carefully
screened by D'Andrea and his
teaching assistants for sensitivi
ty and stability. They then work
with an experienced counselor
before becoming full counselors
themselves.
Forming the core of the
Bridge's team are five student

"live-ins," who reside in the
Bridge's small house between
Nathan Abbott Way and Campus
Drive. Assisting the live-ins are 17
coordinators and 30-50 counselors

calls to the Bridge understandably
picks up around Dead Week.
"We don't claim to be profes
sionals," but rather a temporary
crisis center, staffer Susan Inge
manson said.
According to David Hersh,
another Bridge counselor, "We
see ourselves as a temporary cri
sis service. People who are in situ

ations that require long-term
counseling are referred to outside
therapists and organizations."
Staffer Robin Roos called the
Bridge "an outlet for the commu
nity. We help people to help them
selves and sort out their feelings.
Sometimes it helps to talk to
someone who is just there to lis
ten."
"People at Stanford don't like
to admit that they have prob
lems," said counselor Jessica
Hamerman.
Murakawa noted that callers

are "sometimes a little uncom
fortable." However, Murakawa
stressed that "confidentiality is a
big thing with us. [The person's
identity] is extraneous to their
problem."
The Bridge is not all about
problems, though. For Hamer
man the best part of the job is
when "at the end of the counsel,
the person says thank-you."
Summing up the feelings of
many staffers, Hagenah said sim
ply, "It is a very rewarding thing...
to see the progress."
