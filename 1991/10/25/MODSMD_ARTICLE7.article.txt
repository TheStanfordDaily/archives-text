# Twenty years of Bridging troubled waters

Many Stanford students are
familiar with the Bridge's übiq
uitous yellow stickers in dorm
bathrooms that read, "Nobody
has problems at Stanford? Yeah,
right."
But few are familiar with the
Bridge itself.
The reason for this is that the
counselors provides a "very
silent service," said Bridge
adviser Dr. Vincent D'Andrea.
"It is hard to appreciate the
work that they do."
Tria Hagenah, archive coordi
nator for the Bridge, agreed that
it is "often overlooked," but
added that the counseling ser
vice "is one that is used a lot
more than you would expect."
This year marks the Bridge's
20th anniversary, making it the
oldest independent peer-coun
seling group in the country.
Taking its name from the
Simon and Garfunkel song
"Bridge Over Troubled Water,"
the Bridge was initially designed
to address the "rampant drug
use" on campus, and later
became "one of the first places
where gay and lesbian students
could get support and counsel
ing," D'Andrea said.
From the beginning the
Bridge was conceived as a stu
dent organization, D'Andrea
said, noting that it remains an
independent student group.
This status means the center
must meet all of its own expens
es, and the students decide their
own priorities.
Today, the Bridge's goal is "to
foster community and growth,"
D'Andrea said. Since its incep
tion two decades ago, the Bridge
has expanded its services to
include a 24-hour peer counsel
ing hotline and various support
groups such as Alcoholics Anony
mous, Overeaters Anonymous

and the Coming Out Rap Group.
Workshops on relationships,
peer-counseling techniques and
massage are also offered in-house
to any dorm that requests them.
The center's sole fund-raiser
is the annual Spring Faire, an
arts, crafts and food festival held
in White Plaza.
To qualify as Bridge volun
teers, students are required to
take Psychology 167 A, a quar
ter-long peer counseling class

taught by D'Andrea. The class is
also for those who just want to
"learn to listen better," he said.
Students who want to work
at the Bridge are also carefully
screened by D'Andrea and his
teaching assistants for sensitivi
ty and stability. They then work
with an experienced counselor
before becoming full counselors
themselves.
Forming the core of the
Bridge's team are five student

"live-ins," who reside in the
Bridge's small house between
Nathan Abbott Way and Campus
Drive. Assisting the live-ins are 17
coordinators and 30-50 counselors
autumn quarter, and 80-100 dur
ing winter and spring quarters.
About 10-11 calls come in each
day, "but that can vary a lot,"
staffer Dawnalyn Murakawa
said, adding that the number of

Bridge adviser Vincent D'Andrea says it's hard to appreciate the "silent service" the volunteer staff
does for the community. The Bridge, which just turned 20, is the oldest peer counseling service in
the country.
