Bush bashes Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush blast
ed Congress yesterday as a "privileged class of
rulers," above the laws it passes for others, and

makers' practice of freeing themselves from com
pliance with many laws "shatters public confi
dence in government."

Serbs attack despite truce

heavier attacks of the 4-month-old war.
European Community observers said federal
army and Croatian defense officials agreed to a
truce in the Dubrovnik region, to take effect at 5

about an hour past the truce deadline.
Hold your nose, vote for Edwards
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Former Gov. Edwin
Edwards, who beat a racketeering rap in office,
says the people may have to "hold their nose" to
vote for him, but they'll pick him over ex-
Klansman David Duke in the runoff for governor.
Edwards, a populist Democrat, and Duke, a
state representative running on the Republican
ticket without official GOP backing, were the top
finishers in Saturday's primary, squeezing out
moderate Republican Gov. Buddy Roemer.
