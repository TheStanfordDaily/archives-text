# This time let's keep the lead
## Card has tradition of letting it slip away 
### 
It happened.On a missed field
goal as the gun sounded. Last Sat
urday, Stanford beat USC. At the
Coliseum. In Los Angeles. 24-21.
The last time the Cardinal
broke the Trojans was back in
1975. Most of the players on this
year's squad were preschool
ers... kindergartners max. Their
passions were building Lego
fortresses and Matchbox cars, not
touchdown passes and quarter
back sacks. But that all would
change.
I grew up a die-hard UCLA
fan. As most UCLA fans do, I
adopted the motto: "My two
favorite teams are the Bruins and
whoever's playing USC." As you
can probably conclude, by this
motto Stanford was not on my
top ten list, engaging in losing
battle after losing battle against
the Men of Troy.
The Cardinal have since
replaced the Bruins as No.l in my
heart for almost a year now, but
the hatred of USC lingers. People
in Trojan land like to fancy them
selves as attending a comparable
school, "the Stanford of Southern
California." After all, it's private,
costs $20,000+ a year, and the
students are fairly well-to-do. But
there's a difference. People who
go to Stanford have intelligence.
Our band can play more than one
song. Our athletes graduate. Had
enough?
I say, leave the comparisons to
the gridiron. Until last week,
most Troy fans would have
agreed: "We may not measure up
academically, but at least we can
kick their behinds in football.

Settle it on the field. SAT scores?
So what. How 'bout stats?" For
sixteen years in a row, the Cardi
nal suffered, as USC would look
at Stanford as a given win en
route to several Rose Bowls. The
Trojans even picked the game
with Stanford as its homecoming
this season, no doubt expecting an
easy victory to please the alumni.
But this time the tide turned.
The Cardinal struck early, get
ting 10 quick points. The defense
played super in the opening half
— if it wasn't for one kickoff
return for a touchdown, it would
have been a halftime shutout. At
the end of three quarters, it was
Stanford 17, USC 7.
But then I saw a sign that I
dreaded. The TV cameras focused
on Albert Richardson, celebrat
ing, and in his joy he yelled "One
more quarter! Just one more
quarter!" For me, that was the
end. I knew that the celebrating
was premature, because if any
body can come from ahead to pull
out an unexpected loss, it's the
Cardinal. The reason? Stanford
always manages to leave time on
the clock after taking a lead.
A look at recent history:
1) 1990 opener. Stanford races
out to a 14-0 halftime lead

against Colorado, then sqanders
it in the third quarter for a 14-14
tie. Stanford takes the lead 17-14
on a John Hopkins field goal with
4:17 left, only to lose 21-17 as
Eric Bieniemy caps off a long Buf
falo drive when he plunges in
from the one yard line on fourth
down with twelve seonds left.
2) Game 2 of the 1990 season.
Stanford trails UCLA 7-0
through most of the first quarter,
but leads 14-7 at the half and 21-
7 midway through the third quar
ter. After trading scores, Stan
ford goes ahead 31-29 on a Hop
kins 49 yard boot with 1:14. But
Tommy Maddox marches the
Bruins 80 yards in 9 plays, to set
up Brad Daluiso's winning 21
yard kick with 0:01 left. UCLA
32, Stanford 31.
3) Game 5 of the 1990 season.
The miracle at South Bend
almost wasn't. The Cardinal went
ahead 36-31 on a 62 yard drive
which ended in Tommy Vardell's
fourth touchdown of the day. But
with 36 seconds still remaining,
Rick Mirer quickly moved the
Irish 40 yards in two plays. After
an incompletion on third down,
he fired a 23 yard pa«s intended
for tight end Derek Brown in the
end zone, but the ball was
dropped as time ran out and
Stanford escaped.
4) Game 2, 1991 season. Stan
ford leads Arizona 17-0, but the
defense collapses and the Wild
cats win 28-23.
So, watching the premature
sideline celebration taking place,

I expected that USC would come
back. And it happened. Reggie
Perry led the Trojans on two
fourth quarter drives to give SC
the lead 21-17. When Steve Sten
strom hit Chris Walsh for the
game winner in the end zone
with 1:11 left, it was far from
over. There was too much time
remaining. The Trojans almost
pulled it off, missing a game
tying field goal with no ticks left
on the clock.
Stanford held on, knocking
the Trojan horse off its rocker
(after Traveller had knocked
down a Dollie, no doubt in frus
tration). And it is only appropri
ate that it happened in this Cen
tennial season. After a decade
and a half of being on the short
end, Stanford harkened back to
the days of the Vow Boys of the
1930's, who vowed never to lose
to USC. With the victory, the
Cardinal have a legitimate
chance at a bowl game for the
first time since 1978. Now
wouldn't that be a birthday pre
sent.

David Schwartz is a sophomore
double-majoring in political
science and history. He expects the
Cardinal to explode against the
Beavers, leaving no doubt by
halftime as to the victor.
