# Gibbs tackles starting role
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff Writer 
Coy Gibbs has truly lived up to
his name.
He's coy, a shyness that origi
nates primarily in the fact that he
donned his cap and gown for high
school graduation just four
months ago.
Never mind that in 1990, his
only season at DeMatha Catholic
High School, the Vienna, Va.,
native had made enough of an
impact to attract college scouts
from around the nation.
"I'm just glad I got the opportu
nity to play right away at Stanford;
that's- why I'm here, to play foot
ball," Gibbs said in a modest tone.
Self-promotion isn't the proto
col for a true freshman on a big
time college football squad, but
the numbers amassed by this 6-
foot, 210-pound inside linebacker
speak for themselves. Gibbs has
started five of Stanford's six con
tests to date, and ranks sixth
among Cardinal defenders with
25 tackles (19 of them unassist
ed), including nine in the team's
24-21 upset of USC last week. He
has also forced a fumble and
solidified a Stanford defensive
front that has been plagued by
injuries for much of the season.
"The two things that stand out
about Coy Gibbs are his maturity
and his will," states Head Coach
Denny Green. "He started at the

bottom of the depth chart—like
all freshmen do—beat out a cou
ple of guys and then saw the other
guys ahead of him get injured."
Which brings us back to the
smooth manner in which Gibbs
handles all questions asked of
him. It is almost as if he were
used to the attention, like he had
grown up with it, or his father
was a player or a coach...
Wait a minute! .Gibbs! Isn't
Joe Gibbs the head coach of the
Washington Redskins?! Is Joe
Coy's father?! Could it be?!
The answer to all of the above
is yes. But the younger Gibbs
points out that in the Bay Area
home of the beloved 49ers—his
father's Redskins aren't always
the first topic of discussion.
Constant buzz about his father
would place undue pressure on
Coy to "live up to the family
name" (his uncle was an Ail-
American running back at Clem
son in 1940 and his brother plays
safety at William and Mary), an
onus he neither needs or wants
from outside of the Gibbs clan, let
alone from within.
"My dad doesn't push me; if I
have a question, I'll ask him, but
he lets my coaches take care of
me," said Coy.
Gibbs has found that his out
standing efforts thus far at Stan
ford have been facilitated by a laid
back, nothing-to-lose, everything
to-prove attitude exuded by Green.

"Everybody comes in the same,"
the realistic Gibbs said of the
weight placed on his last name in
considerations for playing time.
"You still have to earn the respect of
the other players and the coaches."
While Gibbs admits that play
ing pro football is "truly a dream"
because of his comparatively
diminutive stature, the possible
history major may use his father's
leadership to make a name for
himself in coaching or being an
agent for professional athletes.
Coy has also expressed an interest
in law school, but knows that a
decision like that may be made a
good while down the road.
For the time being, it's
straight ahead for Coy Gibbs, and
the task at hand is stopping the
deceptively strong option offense
of the Oregon State Beavers.
"Coy will have to show some
discipline against the run this
week, because one breakdown
could lead to a big play," said
Green, laying out his expectations
for one of his young superstars.
Is Gibbs up for the challenge?
"I feel I can get leverage on
people, and I have a sense for
where the ball is," the precocious
18-year-old responded.
If his "leverage" and "sense"
are as even nearly as true as his
name, then Coy Gibbs will give
Stanford's coaches and fans alike
absolutely no worries for a long
time to come.
