# Cardinal shoots for winning record
## Offense set to exploit ailing Beaver secondary 
### Scott Reiss 
It has been a long time coming.
It has been three years, in fact,
since this particular phenomenon
has occurred. But last week,
finally, a fired up and determined
Cardinal team made it reality:
Stanford evened its record at 3-3.
To the average football fan,
this may not seem like any huge
accomplishment. Three wins,
three losses, what's the big deal?
The big deal is that last Saturday,
on a warm Los Angeles evening,
Stanford shocked a massive USC
homecoming crowd by beating
the Trojans for the first time in
16 years. By doing so, the Cardi
nal evened its season record for
the first time since 1988, and
kept its post-season hopes alive.
"We're not talking Bowl yet,
we're just talking about getting
above .500," said linebacker Tom
Williams. "We're just going to
take it one game at a time, and if
we keep winning, the Bowl situa
tion will take care of itself."
Enter Oregon State, a team
which, by any reasonable stretch
of the imagination, Stanford
should beat. But this would not
simply be an insignificant victory
against a weaker opponent. A win
today would give the Cardinal a
winning record, and it would be
the next crucial step toward
coach Dennis Green's first win
ning season at Stanford.
Green's club will be going

against a Beaver squad which is
0-6 for the season, and 0-3 in Pac
10 play. In addition, OSU has lost
11 straight games, dating back to
last year, as well as 10 consecu
tive road games, a streak which
dates back to October of 1989.
Coach Jerry Pettibone, in his
first year with the team, has a
great deal of respect for a Cardi
nal team which is playing very
sound football.
"Stanford is an excellent team,
they have a lot of good athletes,"
said Pettibone. "[To beat Stan
ford], we will have to play a com
plete game, something we have
not been able to do this year."
Those injuries are most evi
dent in the defensive secondary,
where the Beavers will have only
six players with any practice
experience available for today's
game. Cornerback Randy Horton
is listed doubtful for today after
spraining his right knee last week
against UCLA, and safeties Brent
Huff, Paul Montgomery, and Earl
Zackery have already missed mul
tiple games due to injury.
Oregon State's makeshift sec
ondary will have to try to stop
Stanford quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, who has looked very
good in his two starts since
replacing incumbent fifth-year
senior Jason Palumbis. Sten
strom has thrown all four of
Stanford's touchdown passes
this season, including the game
winner against USC, when he

found Chris Walsh in the end
zone with just 1:11 remaining in
the' game.
While Stanford's air attack
had flourished in recent weeks,
Oregon State has relied mainly
on the quarterback option for
their offensive production. The
Beavers are totally committed to
the running game. Quarterback
Mark Olford threw only four
passes against UCLA last week,
completing none. He did, howev
er, run the ball 20 times for 87
yards.
Stanford leads the all-time
series with Oregon State 39-16-3,
and the Cardinal have not lost to
OSU at Stanford Stadium since
1968. In their last three meet
ings, however, Stanford is 1-1-1
against the Beavers. The tie came
in a pivotal game three years ago,
when Stanford had a 3-3 record
going into the game against OSU,
the same situation as today. But
Williams believes that history will
not repeat itself.
"This year I know it won't
happen because the attitude of
the team and the players is differ
ent," he said. "Every game on the
schedule we think we have a
chance to win."
It is an understatement to say
that the Stanford squad has a
chance to win today's game. They
should win. And if they do, they
will not only be able to say that
they are a winning team, but they
will finally have proven it.

Sophomore quarterback Steve Stenstrom has gone undefeated in
two starts since replacing Jason Palumbis. He is looking to continue
the winning streak this afternoon against Oregon State.
