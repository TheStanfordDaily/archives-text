# Gordon shows flashes of secondary brilliance

An animal that is preyed upon must be
slick, elusive, quick; it must use all of its
faculties to escape a pursuing predator. If
it is caught off guard it could be subject to
a bone-crushing, nerve-wrenching experi
ence.
So it is for a football team's wide receiv
er when he crosses into dangerous territo
ry on the sides of the field. If the quarter
back throws the ball high or late or even if
the receiver catches the ball he must juke,
dodge, or sidestep in order to escape the
spine-tingling punishment of the predator,
the cornerback.
Darrien Gordon, who was once prey for
opposing cornerbacks, has now become an
adroit predator, dishing out the kind of
pain that used to be reserved for him. Gor
don, No. 21, left corner for the Cardinal,
has assumed the role of predator so well

that Cardinal coach Denny Green has come
to call him a "natural" at the position.
It was not always this easy for Gordon.
Not starting until last year's Notre Dame
game (the fifth game of the season), Gor
don had to deal with the consequences of
playing on the opposite side of the field of
NFL-bound right corner, Kevin Scott.
According to defensive coordinator/
defensive secondary coach Willie Shaw,
"All last year the teams really picked on
Darrien's position, in hopes of throwing
away from Scott."
However, Gordon, who was playing his
first season as a collegiate cornerback as a
true sophomore, never gave up the battle
against inexperience and opposing offens
es. By the end of the California game, in
which he amassed 10 tackles (9 solo), he
had collected 42 tackles (31 unassisted and
11 assisted) on the year and had made the
transformation to a solid cornerback.

"Darrien Gordon showed a great deal of
improvement throughout the season and
in the final three games he played extreme
ly well," coach Green commented.
With the void left by Scott's departure
to the professional ranks, Gordon was
forced this season to take up some of the
slack for a depleted Cardinal secondary. He
has come through with Cardinal colors.
According to Willie Shaw, "Darrien Gor
don had a good spring and a good off-sea
son . He came back strong this fall and has
done a super job. In fact, he may even have
a chance to be one of the best cornerbacks
in the Pac-10 by next season. Considering
it was only two short years ago that Gor
don was a reserve wide receiver who did
not play a down, it is a testament to the
rare combination of desire and talent that
Gordon possesses."
Signs of this desire and talent have long
been evident. As a flanker in his senior sea

son at Shawnee High School in Shawnee,
Oklahoma, Darrien rushe'd for 834 yards
and three touchdowns on 104 carries. He
also recorded 29 receptions for 445 yards
and six TD's.
For his achievements Gordon was
named First Team All-State and District
Player of the Year and he was an Honor
able Mention All-America selection by USA
Today. According to Gordon, coming to
Stanford as a highly touted receiver did
not negatively affect his chances of becom
ing a solid cornerback. In fact, it probably
helped. "My experience as a receiver
helped me in a number of areas, especially
in being able to read pass routes," he said.
Gordon was cautious about underesti
mating the ailing 0-6 Oregon State
Beavers. "We cannot afford to take Oregon
State lightly. Our team has to play tough
because they are better than their record
indicates we have to play tough," he said.
