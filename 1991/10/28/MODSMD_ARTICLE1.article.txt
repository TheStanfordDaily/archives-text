						question of faith
## Diversity dominates Stanford's religious community

Question everything!
These words, written on a
bumper sticker of a parked car
within view of Memorial Church, echo a
common sentiment at Stanford — one
that may make it difficult for students to
maintain their religious beliefs.
When students first set foot on cam
pus, they are faced with hundreds of new
religious opportunities, but find them
selves without their parents or the spiri
tual leaders they had depended on to
guide their decisions in the past.
Confronted on a daily basis with fliers
and booths in White Plaza, newly inde
pendent students have to decide — often
for the first time — how big a role they
want religion to play in their Stanford
experience.
"The overriding ethos of the Universi
ty is to be critical," said Rabbi Ari Cartun
of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation.
With such a strong emphasis on doubting
everything, the acceptance of any reli
gious ideology is very hard, he said.
An unvoiced assumption that religion
is not an intellectual activity exists among
many students. Some agree with Karl
Marx that religion is "the opiate of the
masses."
Freshman Peter Gaffney, an atheist,
said that a religion excluding other reli
gions as not being the truth is an example
of "institutionalized prejudice."
But religion plays an important role in
the lives of many other students. "Given
the variety and range of [religiousj orga
nizations, religious life plays a significant
part of [Stanford students'] whole experi
ence," said Heather Dunn, who works in
the Office of Student Activities.
Stanford Associated Ministries alone
consists of more than 20 well-established
groups ranging from the Adventist Fel

lowship to the Catholic Community at
Stanford to the Islamic Society. Until the
Loma Prieta earthquake, Memorial
Church — an inter-denominational
church supported by the University —
functioned as an active religious center
for many groups.
Brooke Butler, coordinator of the Cam
pus Crusade for Christ, said many stu
dents are sufficiently "confident in them
selves to explore a new religion . . . that
they may not even agree with." Butler
added that students who are not willing to
discuss or even attend an event seem to be
afraid of challenging themselves.
Cartun said in his 17 years at Stanford
he has witnessed two kinds of approaches
to religion: "students trying to get to it
and students trying to get away from it."
Campus religious leaders agree that, in
general, students who commit themselves
to a religious organization during high
school seem to continue their involvement
throughout college. Those who were
always opposed to religion also continue
in their ways.
But a significant amount of students
come to Stanford on less solid ground;
they are curious and want to find out
more about religious practices. Cartun
said Jewish students often have questions
such as, "What will happen if I marry a
person who is not a Jew?"
Every year Cartun also witnesses the
reactions of Jewish students approached
by other religious organizations. A "com
bination of anger, confusion and Jewish
pride" seems to be the normal result of
such confrontations, he said.
"Anger because someone dared to
insult them by asking them to change to
another religion, confusion because they
lack actual knowledge about other reli
gions and Jewish pride because if after
