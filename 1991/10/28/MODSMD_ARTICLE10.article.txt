# Bush waives Israeli sanctions

WASHINGTON (AP) -
President George Bush
waived sanctions against
Israel despite a determination
by U.S. intelligence that a
government-backed Israeli
company recently exported
key ballistic missile compo
nents to South Africa, accord
ing to a published report.
The Washington Post cited
unidentified "administration
and diplomatic officials" as
the sources for the account in
yesterday's editions and said
it was unable to get the White
House or State Department to
react when the story was
being prepared last week.
White House spokesperson
Roman Popadiuk said Sat
urday evening he had "no
comment" on the story.
The Post quoted its sources
as saying the matter "is being
treated with extreme sensitiv
ity" inside the administration
and that the decision to waive
sanctions "was motivated in
part by concern that punish
ing Israel would undermine

its position" at the Middle
East peace conference opening
this week.
The account also cited its
"Israeli sources" as saying
the decision also considered
Israel's agreement last month
to pledge future adherence to
the Convention for the
Limitation of the Spread of
Missile Technology.
That pact, adopted in 1987,
is intended to prevent coun
tries that do not already have
missiles capable of carrying
nuclear warheads from devel
oping such weapons.
The paper said the missile
components at issue were
shipped within the past year
to the Armaments Corp. of
South Africa, which is also
government-affiliated, and is
known as Armscor.
A two-year suspension of
permission to export or
import products from U.S.
territory has been imposed on
Armscor in an action pub
lished Oct. 15 in the Federal
Register.
