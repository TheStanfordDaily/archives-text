## Musical magnificence 
### 
Music performing arts
at Stanford are simply
too valuable to sacrifice

JUDGMENT DAY IS UPON
us. Now that administrators
have set reduction targets for
schools and administrative areas,
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences has responded by putting
forth a short list of potential areas
for elimination or significant
reduction.
Tragically, music performing
arts is on that list of programs
being considered for the ax.
And what an easy target it is.
Musicians at Stanford are relative
ly low-profile, so those who fight
for music — or any arts program
— can be written off by adminis
trative heavies as "provincial," or
unmindful of the University's cen
tral mission.
And performance music should
play second-fiddle at research-ori
ented institutions, right? Wrong.
It is this notion that shows how
out of touch decision-makers are
with the centrality of music in the
Stanford experience. While they
have rightfully decided not to
make across-the-board budget cuts
that would breed general medi
ocrity, their recommendation that
music performing arts be reduced
or eliminated will accomplish
almost exactly that.
Each quarter, 800 to 1,000
musicians from all backgrounds
and all schools study privately or
perform in music groups. Many of
them chose Stanford because they
knew they could pursue their
musical and academic interests
here. Those who take private
lessons pay money above and
beyond room and board — bring
ing revenue back into the program.
Others who aren't participating
formally in the department chose
Stanford over other top universi
ties primarily because they knew
they did have such a choice.

Music is rare common ground in
an academic institution, whose
appeal reaches graduate and
undergraduate students. It tran
scends cultural and departmental
isolation, as well.
If we cut or eliminate the
already lean music department, we
will lose a broad cross-section of
students. There is no surer path to
mediocrity than losing their bril
liant minds to other universities.
Apparently music research is
not being considered for reduction
or elimination. Given the rhetoric
that Stanford is primarily a
research institution, this sounds
sensible. It isn't, however.
Music is fundamentally a per
formance art. To choose the study
of Mozart over the performance
would be to misunderstand grossly
the role of music in society. We
study Mozart because we want to
better comprehend the genius that
is heard in performance — and not
the converse.
And practically speaking, there
will be no students to participate
in music research or theory if
there is no outlet for performance.
It would be like studying chem
istry without having access to a
laboratory. Put simply, research
without performance would be like
a body without a soul.
Soulless existence is the curse of
modern society. Until now, Stan
ford managed to escape the curse.
With its orchestras, its chorale and
its chamber groups, Stanford has
soothed the savage breast of the
community and given students the
chance to express the despair and
joy that define human existence.
It is true that cuts must be
made. Music — particularly the
performance aspect — isn't fat
that can be trimmed. The loss
would affect every aspect of life
here, like a sickness invades the
human body.
Civilizations are judged as much
by their technological prowess as
they are by their artistic achieve
ment. A leaner, artless University
would be a brave new Stanford,
indeed.
