Stanford shouldn't settle for Harvard's lack of art

lAM WRITING THIS LETTER
because I am extremely concerned
about the possible consequences of
the impending budget cuts for the per
forming arts at Stanford.
My understanding is that the per
forming-arts program stands to bear the
brunt of the School of Humanities and
Sciences' "budget-chopping ax." The
school will soon have to make some very
painful decisions regarding ways to cut
8.6 percent of its operating budget, and
I'm sure it will be just like trying to fig
ure out what part of one's body should
be amputated.
My concern is that the school will
look upon student performance pro
grams as expendable fingernails instead
of the crucial arms that they are.

I have been in the Stanford Sympho
ny Orchestra for over six years now, and
I have been in the Stanford Percussion
Ensemble for three years. I have always
had friends who were heavily involved in
the choral programs.
For all of these years and in all of
these groups, I have seen so many fellow
biologists, engineers, philosophers,
French majors, psychology majors, etc.
get so much enjoyment and valuable
experience out of the student perform
ing-arts program at Stanford.
I have seen the rest of the campus
community reap the benefits of these
programs in the form of a culturally and
artistically stimulating environment. I
have also seen Stanford proudly present
itself to the outside world as a place

where students don't just learn about
the "three Rs," but also about social
issues, the values of public service, ath
letics and what many would consider to
be the best aspect of humanity — its
artistic creativity.
This was most recently and notably
demonstrated at the Centennial Cele
bration, where the side of Stanford that
was automatically shown off to the out
side world was that of the performing
arts.
There has been talk of the Harvard
model; that is, Harvard University
doesn't have an official performing arts
program — why should we? Putting
aside any questions about why Stan
ford feels compelled to emulate Har
vard at that level of comparison, I

would ask why so many students
decide to come to Stanford instead of
Harvard when Harvard has a 350-year
old impressive reputation and a great
deal of money.
My suggested answer would be that
Stanford has things that Harvard
doesn't have. By getting rid of those
things, Stanford loses.
I want to leave the reader with this
final thought. Stanford has always striv
en to be the very best in every endeavor.
It has always stood proudly and tall.
Consider that Stanford Institute of
Technology is SIT. What a sadly fitting
acronym that would be.
