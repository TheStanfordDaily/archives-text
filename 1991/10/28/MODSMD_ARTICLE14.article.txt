# Bathroom talk: Just one flush really is more than enough
## 
### 
Picture a man walking into a bath
room and approaching a urinal. He sees
that there is still some urine in the bowl
left by someone before him. So he flush
es the urinal only to urinate in it some
more. When he is finished, he flushes
the toilet again.
So why am I writing about something
so base? Because I find the behavior
described above as odious as the urine he
flushed away. Perhaps the man before
him was lazy, or maybe he was trying to
save a bit of water. But was it necessary
to use twice as much water as is needed?
It all goes down the same drain.
The whole idea behind urinals is that
they use less water than a toilet. Not
only was the man wasting water, he was
saying that only clean water is good
enough for him to urinate in. That's like
saying only new paper is good enough to

write on, or only the best food is good
enough to eat, or only a BMW is good
enough to drive. Why use more than you
really need?
