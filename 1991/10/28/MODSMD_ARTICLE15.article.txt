# Asbestos removal must be a result of health risk not fear
## 
### 
Out of context quotes have no place
in Daily news articles. At the Oct. 22
ASSU Senate meeting I argued that in
prioritizing asbestos removal, buildings
should be evaluated by level of risk to
residents rather than automatically giv
ing precedence to family residences.
First, a few quick facts about
asbestos:
• Only length of exposure, not age of
exposure, is relevant in assessing risk of
asbestosis. A baby and a 20-year-old
exposed for the same amount of time are

at equal risk;
• The risk posed by a building where
the ceiling seems intact can be higher
than that posed by a building where the
ceiling is crumbling. Exposure consists
of inhaling tiny particles, rather than
ingesting visible chunks;
• Not all asbestos is the same. Size
and shape of the particles matter more
than type of residence; and
• Exposed smokers face a relative risk
10 times higher than exposed non-smok
ers. Arguably, this places adults at
greater risk than children.
Instead of inquiring about my rea
soning and presenting the substance of
these arguments, The Daily chose to
quote an out of context "sound bite" in
order to make it seem like I don't care
about helpless children. Needless to
say, this could not be further from the
truth.
The Daily should be more thorough in
its investigations before reaching false
conclusions to support its sensationalis
ts purposes.
