# Gandhi championed the human condition, not animal rights
## 
### 
Jocelyn Lee is accredited with a pro
foundly absurd misquote in her letter to
The Daily (Oct. 24) titled "Students
don't have to become vegetarians to care
for animal rights." She claimed that
"Gandhi once said, 'The greatness of a
nation can be judged by the treatment of
its animals.'" However, what Gandhi
did say was, "The greatness of a nation
can be judged by the treatment of its
minorities." In conclusion, Lee wonders
how the United States would rate; with
this minor correction, we animatedly
share her concern.
