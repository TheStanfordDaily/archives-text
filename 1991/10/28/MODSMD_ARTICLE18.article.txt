## To live and die in L.A. 
### 
This weekend i met diondre.
I had roadtripped down to L.A. and
decided to stop at a record store.
He was standing outside wearing a
black leather hat and raincoat. He had
both ears double-pierced and his eyes
were hard, cold pieces of slate. He was a
little prototype of the hardened men in
"Boyz N the Hood" or "New Jack City."
"'Scuse me, lady. Would you like to
buy some candy and support the L.A.
Youth Development Center?" The words
came out like an obviously rehearsed
speech. His eyes were vacant and incog
nizant; he apparently thought I was
going to walk on by like the rest. He
looked surprised when I promised him
that I would come back later.
When I returned, he proceeded to
repeat his earlier sales pitch. I stopped
him and asked what the program really
did. He explained that the Center took
L.A. youth on trips, gave workshops and
basically made up programs to take up
time. The idea is that busy kids don't
have time to join gangs or sell drugs.
Looking at him took me back to this
summer. I lived in Washington, D.C.,
murder capital of the world. It made me
remember the great disparities I saw
between the high and mighty lawmakers I
worked for and the lost masses they so
easily ignored.
Everyone had a lovely degree from a
prestigious school and backgrounds that

were less than underprivileged. Everyday
they would drive into the District from
their nice homes in the safe suburbs.
When the day was done they'd climb into
their cars and leave the filth and poverty
behind.
What they left behind were places like
Florida or Georgia Avenue, where you
trip over the crack vials and where every
corner has a liquor store; where life is
cheap and death is even more inexpen
sive. The schools are full of despairing,
uninspired kids who cannot spell "gradu
ate," let alone accomplish the act. Fami
lies are dysfunctional, if existent.
Everything is locked up, barred in or
closed down. I went into a liquor store
with my friend Damien and the entire
cashier counter "was covered in bullet
proof plastic. I felt like I was in a zoo
where people and the animals are divided
by a barrier. "This is Florida Avenue,"
Damien laughed. "This is the real thing."
I did some community service with the
kids in D.C. and they all had eyes like Dion
dre: cold, unbelieving, hopeless.
I asked him how old he was. He was
15. Suddenly he wasn't just another
black teenager trying to find a way out of
the darkness. He was my 15 year old
brother, whose world is full of expecta
tions, goals and dreams. I wanted to take
him home, give him all the money I had,
or do some miraculous act that would
make his dream of going to USC or

UCLA a reality, not just a hollow dream.
I'm sure the L.A. Youth Development
Center is trying to do a good job. But I
know that as things stand Diondre will
never matriculate to UCLA or USC. He'll
find the Center's activities a waste of
time and join a gang or maybe sell drugs
to support and protect his family. He'll
die young and the toddler he leaves
behind will ten years later be standing
outside the record store, trying to make
money for an organization that's trying
to make up for his dysfunctional back
ground.
The record I bought was Heavy D and
the Boyz's "Peaceful Journey." The title
track is about those "especially on the
street level." It chronicles the hardness
and the sadness of those lost in the sys
tem, particularly the children. As I lis
tened to it, I realized Heavy D was talking
about Diondre.
So this column is a shout out to Dion
dre. The odds are against you, but I'm
praying for you. "You're on my mind.
And I wish you a peaceful journey. Broth
er, I hope you hear me. . . . Peace."
