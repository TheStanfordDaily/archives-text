# 6,000 trek in annual AIDS Walk
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Members of the Stanford community
literally took steps toward AIDS preven
tion yesterday as the University hosted
one route of the second annual AIDS
Walk.
More than 6,000 walkers represent
ing local businesses and charities partic
ipated in AIDS Walk '91, a 10-kilometer
trek held at three different Bay Area
locations to benefit AIDS projects in
seven counties, including Palo Alto's
Mayfield Community Clinic.
The diverse crowd participated in a
vigorous aerobic warm-up in Frost
Amphitheater and listened to welcom
ing remarks by Patricia Benavidez, the
event's director, before embarking on
the walk down Palm Drive.
"This walk is dedicated to all those
affected by AIDS .. . and most especial
ly to the young people who are stepping

forward more and more each day
because they recognize the impact AIDS
has and will continue to have on their
lives," she said.
Stanford's Haas Center for Public
Service was one sponsor of AIDS Walk,
which was underwritten by more than
20 regional corporations and businesses.
Among the Stanford students "step
ping forward" to fight AIDS were junior
Robin Ostrender and a team of her fellow
Trancos residents, who skipped brunch
to participate in the walk. All agreed the
experience was worth the sacrifice.
"College students have a tendency to
think they're immune to AIDS,"
Ostrender said. "But I'm aware of it,
and I found five other people in my
dorm who are aware of it and want to do
something about it."
Other students, such as freshman
Bill Faries, helped behind the scenes of
AIDS Walk '91. Faries volunteered to
register walkers during the Haas Cen

ter's recent Public Service Celebration.
"I didn't know it was going to be such
a big event," Faries said. "I'm taking
their money, signing them up, giving
them free condoms and T-shirts. It's
been a lot of work, but it's gone very
smoothly. I think everyone's really excit
ed about doing their part to fight AIDS."
But the tragedy of the cause was not
lost in all the excitement of the event.
Maggie McLoughlin, an employee of the
Graduate School of Business, had tears
in her eyes as she surveyed the colorful
crowd.
"I'm concerned for the people who
are living with this disease — and dying
with it," she said. "There doesn't seem
to be much I can do except give my time,
money and support. That's why I'm
here today."
