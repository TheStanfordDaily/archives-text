The victory was the third in a row for
Stanford and raised its record to 4-3, but
more importantly to head coach Denny
Green, evened the team's Pacific 10 Con
ference mark at 2-2.
"For us it's a whole new ball game,"
Green said. "We're in our Pac-10 schedule
and we're on a hot streak. It's up to us
now."
Saturday's victory marked the first
time the Cardinal has sported a winning
record since 1986, when it went to the
Gator Bowl. Included in the 21,416 faith
ful who braved the cold and rain to see the
Cardinal climb over the .500 mark was a
representative from the Freedom bowl.
For the first time since early in the season,
Stanford can legitimately consider playing
in the postseason, but the players are
quick to keep things in perspective.
"(The postseason is) important to us,
and we talk about it, but in talking about
it we say we still have to beat the next four
teams and take it one game at a time," said
linebacker Ron George. "We have the
vision, we just need to create the path."

Blazing the way for the Cardinal
against OSU was halflback Glyn Milburn.
Overshadowed earlier in the season by
backfield mate Tommy Vardell, Milburn
has played well in his last two games and
Saturday showed the style that made him
last season's NCAA all-purpose yards lead
er.
Coming off a strong showing last week
end against USC, the junior from Santa
Monica notched 319 all-purpose yards en
route to four touchdowns, marking the
first time all season that he has seen the
end zone. After the game Milburn admit
ted the touchdown monkey was now off
his back.
"It's a relief in that I don't have to
think about it," Milburn said. "I don't
think it was important that I needed to
score, but I wanted to score, and get it in
early. When you get it in early you get
greedy and want more and more."
Vardell put the first points on the board
when he plunged up the middle for his
30th career touchdown, tying him at
fourth on Stanford's all-time touchdown
list.
OSU starting quarterback Mark Olford
was injured on the Beavers' opening pos
session and was replaced by freshman
Sedrick Thomas, who fumbled his first
handoff, allowing Stanford's Dave Garnett
to recover and quickly get his team into
scoring position again.
Starting on the OSU 25-yard line, Stan
ford needed only two plays and eight sec
onds for quarterback Steve Stenstrom to
find Milburn on a screen pass for a 25-yard
touchdown. Up 14-0, Stanford made it 21-
0 after Thomas again fumbled on the
Beaver's first play of their possession.

With this win, Stanford tops the
.500 mark for the first time in
head coach Denny Green's
career at Stanford. The last time
the Cardinal reached this mark
was in 1986. Next weekend the
team takes on the Oregon Ducks
in Eugene.
Tom Williams' recovery led to
Milburn's second rushing touch
down of the day, a 2-yard pitch
left.
The Beavers' troubles contin
ued to mount on their next pos
session as they avoided fum
bling, but were forced to punt
from their own 14 and watched
as long snapper Chris Huot
sailed the ball over punter Tim
Kollas* hands out of the end
zone for a safety. The first quar
ter ended with Stanford up 23-0,
with fans no longer pondering
the question of who would win
the game, but rather wondering
if the Oregon State offense
would ever make it to the end
zone.
The crowd was not left hold
ing its breath. The Beaver's
option offense has not been very
successful passing (the team
was 0-for-4 last weekend against
UCLA), but the first time OSU
tried to go to the air against the
Cardinal they found the answer
to their scoring woes. Taking
Stanford's defense by surprise,
Thomas faked the handoff and
found Chad Paulson all alone on
the right side for the touch
down.
"The guys just read the
option and let (Paulson)
through," Garnett said. "They
did catch us by surprise."
Not that it mattered all that
much. The touchdown was the
Beavers' only moment of glory,
as the rest of the game belonged
to Milburn. In response to the
OSU touchdown pass, Milburn
produced one of his own, taking
a screen pass from Stenstrom
and going 92 yards for his third
score of the day. The play was
the second longest scoring pass
in Stanford history, and when it
was done Milburn was forced to
his knee for a short time of
reflection.
"I said 'thank you lord that I
made it here,"' Milburn said. "I
was tired after that. It's been
awhile since I've done some
thing like that at Stanford."
Milburn ended the day with
149 receiving yards on seven
catches, and got his fourth
touchdown later in the game on
a nifty 21-yard run, giving him
130 yards on the ground.
"He's just what I thought he
would be," said OSU head coach
Jerry Pettibone. "He is a talent
ed, gifted athlete. He is truly an
All-American. He really shined
today."
