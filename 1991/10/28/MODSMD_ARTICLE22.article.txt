The victory was the third in a row for
Stanford and raised its record to 4-3, but
more importantly to head coach Denny
Green, evened the team's Pacific 10 Con
ference mark at 2-2.
"For us it's a whole new ball game,"
Green said. "We're in our Pac-10 schedule
and we're on a hot streak. It's up to us
now."
Saturday's victory marked the first
time the Cardinal has sported a winning
record since 1986, when it went to the
Gator Bowl. Included in the 21,416 faith
ful who braved the cold and rain to see the
Cardinal climb over the .500 mark was a
representative from the Freedom bowl.
For the first time since early in the season,
Stanford can legitimately consider playing
in the postseason, but the players are
quick to keep things in perspective.
"(The postseason is) important to us,
and we talk about it, but in talking about
it we say we still have to beat the next four
teams and take it one game at a time," said
linebacker Ron George. "We have the
vision, we just need to create the path."

Blazing the way for the Cardinal
against OSU was halflback Glyn Milburn.
Overshadowed earlier in the season by
backfield mate Tommy Vardell, Milburn
has played well in his last two games and
Saturday showed the style that made him
last season's NCAA all-purpose yards lead
er.
Coming off a strong showing last week
end against USC, the junior from Santa
Monica notched 319 all-purpose yards en
route to four touchdowns, marking the
first time all season that he has seen the
end zone. After the game Milburn admit
ted the touchdown monkey was now off
his back.
"It's a relief in that I don't have to
think about it," Milburn said. "I don't
think it was important that I needed to
score, but I wanted to score, and get it in
early. When you get it in early you get
greedy and want more and more."
Vardell put the first points on the board
when he plunged up the middle for his
30th career touchdown, tying him at
fourth on Stanford's all-time touchdown
list.
OSU starting quarterback Mark Olford
was injured on the Beavers' opening pos
session and was replaced by freshman
Sedrick Thomas, who fumbled his first
handoff, allowing Stanford's Dave Garnett
to recover and quickly get his team into
scoring position again.
Starting on the OSU 25-yard line, Stan
ford needed only two plays and eight sec
onds for quarterback Steve Stenstrom to
find Milburn on a screen pass for a 25-yard
touchdown. Up 14-0, Stanford made it 21-
0 after Thomas again fumbled on the
Beaver's first play of their possession.
