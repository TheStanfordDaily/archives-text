# Defense destroys Beavs' fleeting hopes for upset
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Bone-crunching. Helmet-cracking.
Teeth-gritting. Football played in its
rawest form, fast-paced and aggressive.
This was the only way to describe the per
formance given by the Cardinal's defensive
the Oregon State Beavers 40-fo on Satur
day.
From the safety of the stands the game
looked like a well-rehearsed production.
Oregon State quarterback Sedrick Thomas
would pedal backwards and start looking
downfield for a receiver, only to fmd Cardi
nal defensive tackles Estevan Avila and
Tyrone Parker hurtling towards him full
throttle.
In desperation, he might attempt a lat
eral to his fullback, who would most likely
fumble the ball after a head-on collision
with Cardinal linebacker Ron George or
Dave Garnett.
It seemed effortless, as Stanford played
the option and consistently penetrated the

Beaver's wishbone formation. To say that
Oregon State's passing game was effective
ly shut down would be an understatement.
By the end of the game, Thomas had only
managed to complete two passes for 49
yards.
The story on the ground was much the
same, as the Beavers were held to under
,100 rusfring yards. To put icing on the
cake, Stanford's defense also scooped up
six balls from the turf, paving the way for
three Cardinal touchdowns.
There were some individual perfor
mances that stood out as well. Free safety
Seyon Albert racked up 10 tackles, two of
which resulted in yardage losses. George
had nine tackles, caused two fumbles, and
sacked Thomas for a loss of 15 yards in the
fourth quarter.
"I think any team that's excited just
wants to eat up that winning feeling,"
George explained with a smile. "We're
really hungry â€” we've been starving for a
while!"
