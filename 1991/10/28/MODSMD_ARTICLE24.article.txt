Although No. 13 Southern
Methodist University was
expected to provide the bigger
challenge to the Cardinal this
weekend, three Stanford goals
in the final 12 minutes official
ly broke the Cardinal out of its
offensive doldrums and made
the game a 5-0 laugher.
An unheralded Texas Chris
tian had dreams of an upset
that it kept alive until late in
the game, when a Stanford goal
secured the Cardinal's fourth
1-0 triumph in the past seven
games.
The teams in the tourna
ment were subject to terrible
field conditions brought about
by incessant rain. Fortunately,
Stanford's defensive play was
not adversely affected as the
Cardinal and goalkeeper Leslie
Garrard notched their second

and third successive shutouts.
Stanford has now held its oppo
nent scoreless in eight of its
last nine games.
In the Saturday opener, the
contest remained close until
late in the game. The only first
half scoring came with 29:45
gone in the game, when Kim
Petersen's third goal of the sea
son put Stanford up 1-0.
For the rest of the first half
and the opening minutes of the
second, no goals were scored.
However, after the game was
temporarily halted because of
lightning, the Cardinal picked
up the pace and began beating
Sothern Methodist goalkeeper
Rene Broussard with regulari
ty-
The game resumed with a
drop ball, and junior Julie
Foudy promptly scored an
unassisted goal to push the
Cardinal lead to two at 51:10.
At 78:48, Stanford began the
kind of offensive surge that had
deserted them over the past
several games. Sophomore
Sarah Rafanelli, who had pro
vided most of the team's offen
sive firepower during its offen
sive slump, scored off an assist
from freshman Andrea John
son to make the score 3-0.
Just under two and a half
minutes later, Rafanelli struck
again, beating Broussard to
make the score 4-0. With the
goal, Rafanelli moved ahead of
Foudy for the team scoring
lead. Each has scored 15 goals
on the season, and Rafanelli
had added seven assists to
Foudy's five.
The game's final tally came at
86:04, when Kristen Wair scored
the first goal of her collegiate
career on a free kick, yielding the
game's find score of 5-0.
The Stanford defense, by contrast,
hardly let a shot by. Garrard only had
to make three saves to record her
tenth shutout of the year.

After such a sound thrashing
against a nationally ranked oppo
nent, it boggled the mind to think
of how many goals the Cardinal
would be able to rack up against a
3-7-3 opponent.
However, the Horned Frogs gave
the Cardinal a run for its money in
Sunday's game, which could have
gone either way until under 11 min
utes remained in the game.
Captain Heather Mclntyre scored
on a long free kick at 79:23 to provide
all the offense the Cardinal needed.
