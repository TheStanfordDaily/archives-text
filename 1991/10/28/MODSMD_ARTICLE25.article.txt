volleyball team did it every which
way possible this weekend, using
powerful hitting, good blocking,
tough digging and strong serving
to run over Pacific 10 Conference

Cardinal defeats UW

Cardinal defeats WSU

15-8, 15-9, 15-3

foes Washington and No. 19
Washington State, extending its
unbeaten streak to 19 games.
The Cardinal defeated the
Huskies on Friday 15-7, 15-5, 15-
8, and then crushed the Cougars
15-8, 15-9, 15-3 on Saturday
night to go to 11-0 in Pac-10 play.
Washington came into Burn
ham Pavilion on Friday night
with a 12-8 overall record, 3-6 in
the conference, but they came
without their star player, hitter
Dawn Austin, who injured her
knee two weeks ago and is out for
the season. Austin had been lead
ing the team in kills and hitting
percentage.
Austin probably would not
have been able to help the hapless
Huskies too much. The Cardinal
simply played too well. Stanford
outhit Washington .270 to .073
and blocked one out of every 10
balls that the Huskies hit.
Senior Kristin Klein continued
her hot hitting streak, leading the
Cardinal with 13 kills and a .370
hitting percentage. Fellow senior
Amy Cooper hit .500 with six
kills, while junior Bev Oden

added seven kills and seven digs.
Stanford kept Washington off
balance with a mixed attack, hit
ting from everywhere on the
court and alternating between
thundering spikes and soft dinks.
Team members and coaches
were pleased that the team could
avoid mental letdowns after the
two impressive wins last week
end.
"I think the intensity was pret
ty good," Shaw said. "Washing
ton played pretty well in the first
game and that got us into it."
"Coming off such a big week
end, the last thing we want to do
is be upset now," Klein said. "It's
hard to keep your intensity up
especially once the game is going
because the pace is so slow, but
we did a pretty good job."
Everyone expected the tempo
of Saturday night's match with
No. 19 Washington State to be a
little quicker because the
Cougars had the top hitting per
centage in the conference at .301
while Stanford was second with
.269.
Everyone was wrong. Wash
ington State, coming off a five
game loss to California the night
before, never figured out a reply
to Stanford's crushing spikes as
the Cardinal hit at will and stifled
the Cougar attack. Stanford, led
by Oden's otherworldly .684 hit
ting percentage, hit .393 as a
team to Washington State's .125.
"We have a good idea of what
they're doing," Shaw said. "We
were real tuned in tonight."
While the Cardinal was able to
get one block for every nine
Cougar hits, Washington State
never could stop Oden as she sim
ply hit over the slow Cougar mid
dle block.
"[Washington State has] a lot
of trouble middle-blocking,"
Oden said. "We are able to hit
before the block even forms. I

think the timing was a lot better
tonight — Carrie was setting
great."
"Bev played really well," Klein
said. "We're setting her high and
she was hitting really hard

tonight."
Stanford put together big runs
in each game which put a Wash
ington State victory out of reach
