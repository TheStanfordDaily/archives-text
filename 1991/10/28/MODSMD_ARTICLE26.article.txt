# Bev balances everything

It is an old adage that "college is a les
son in time-management." Junior Bev
Oden is a living example of that every
day as she mixes academics, athletics
and student life.
First, there is the athletic side of
Oden. She is a starting middle-blocker
for the top-ranked volleyball team and

an acknowledged superstar. She was
selected the NCAA Player of the Year
last year for her outstanding play and
she is currently first on the team in
blocks and second in kills and digs. She
was also named the Honda Player of the
Year last year.
Despite her glorious success, volley
ball takes its toll. The huge chunks taken
out of each day for practice wreak havoc
with Oden's class schedule.
"We (the team) used to practice from
one to four and we couldn't take any
afternoon classes. It's real tough because
you usually have to take some classes in
the afternoon for your major," Oden
said.
Oden and her teammates have also
had to miss out on several events that
make Stanford college life special,
including freshman orientation because
they had a early-season road trip.
"We all moved in early, but no one was
in the dorm. We went off with our frosh
books and tried to find our roommates. .
. (All the other freshman) started togeth
er at one point, but I missed that point,"

Oden said.
"I like living in a dorm and coming
back from practice and being a student,"
Oden said. "I come back to my dorm and
they don't care what went on in this drill
or whatever. It's just nice to come back
here."
Another thing that has helped Oden
deal with the personal pressures of col
lege, and especially volleyball, is her
Christian faith. She and her family have
always gone to church, but this summer
she rededicated herself to her belief in
God and it has really been a big lift for
her.
"This year I don't feel like I'm alone
when I'm in a slump or something,"
Oden said. "I feel I have someone to go to.
.. . Before it was just me, and I didn't like
that."
From all of her talk one might think
that Oden had lost her enthusiasm for
the game she has been playing for so long.
Not so. She points out that after playing
for so long, she has learned to commit
large amounts of her time to volleyball.
Also, the fun aspects of the game over
shadow the sacrifices and tough times.
"When you get a win like UCLA (Stan
ford defeated their archrival Bruins in
L.A. last week), it's all worth it," Oden
said.
You might think that someone who is
in Oden's position would be aloof and
stuffy, filled by superstar-status. On the
contrary, Oden downplays her own abili
ties all the time.
"I have to work on my passing,
defense, right-side hitting, and, well, I
need to work on everything," she said.
After watching her play last Saturday
night against Washington State, one
might wonder if she has any weaknesses
in her play. Oden single-handedly dis
membered the Cougar defense, hitting
.684 for the match with 15 kills, seven
digs and six blocks.
After two frustrating years of coming
close but not quite getting to the NCAA
Championship, Oden is quietly confident
that this year Stanford can take it all.
"I really, really like this team," she
said. "We've been playing together really
well. I have a lot more confidence in this
teaip. .. . Last year we were such a dif
ferent team. This year we stick to our
guns."
Oden and her teammates will take
their No. 1 ranking and undefeated
record down south tomorrow night to
play San Jose State. If Stanford wins, it
will tie the record for the best start in
Stanford women's volleyball history at
20 wins.
