### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Rain, high winds and an ever-present chill
brought out the flaws in other teams' games in this
weekend's Stanford Intercollegiate women's golf
tournament, but No. 6 Stanford weathered the
storm to finish third, beating the nation's No. 4 and
No. 5 teams.

Stanford Intercollgiate

Cardinal

finishes third

Stanford was both helped and hurt by the weath
er, especially the rain on Saturday which caused the
cancellation of the tournament's second round.
"I think if we'd had another round we would've
had a good shot at winning," said Adele Moore, the
leading Cardinal golfer, who finished in a tie for
fourth overall.
While most teams choked in the second round of
the tournament held on Sunday, Stanford equaled
its 306 stroke effort from Friday to finish with a
tournament total of 612.
San Jose State won the tournament with 606
strokes with Arizona coming in second with 607.
Moore's 76 and 73 led Stanford, followed in
eighth by freshman Jamille Jose, who was golfing
individually. Had Jose's score counted for the team,
Stanford would have won, but Jose did not make
the top five in qualifiers earlier in the week.
"Jamille finishing eighth is typical of the way
she can play golf. In the future she will be a won
derful addition to our team," said coach Tim Bald
win.
Audrey Wooding shot a 72 on Friday leaving her
in second place going into Sunday's competition,
but faltered in the second round, scoring 81, good
for a final finish of 12th place.
Stephanie Davis finished in 20th place shooting
78 and 77. Melinda Daniels shot two rounds of 80,
good for 41st place. Amy Lawrence, competing as
an individual, finished close behind in 44th place
with a 79 and an 82.
Martha Richards had a disappointing opening
round of 86, but redeemed herself on Sunday,
shooting a 76 for 47th place.
"A real team effort was made by Martha
Richards to pick up where Audrey fell (on the sec
ond day). That's what makes a team good," Bald
win said.
Stanford's team poise was the key, with most of
the women having two even rounds. Other teams
lacked the consistency of the Cardinal, such as
UCLA whose 316 final day dropped them to sixth
place, after opening the tournament with 305
strokes.
"This is how we've been playing all year," Bald
win said. "In Phoenix and Seattle we showed that
we have a solid golf team.
"Jf we continue to play as we are playing now, we
have a definite chance to win NCAA's."
