# Long ride home from L.A. for defeated men's team
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team
emerged embittered, disappointed, and,
most importantly, winless from this week
end's crucial southern California road
trip, losing 3-0 to No. 14 UCLA Friday
night and tying No. 27 San Diego State 2-
2 yesterday.

From the start, the trip had an omi
nous feel for the Cardinal (9-3-5). After
last Tuesday's sloppy 2-1 victory over an
inexperienced San Jose State team, Stan
ford coach Colin Lindores stressed that
his squad must improve its play a level to
be effective against better competition.
"Soccer is a game of emotion," Lin
dores said. "Playoff teams are able to excel
when they play superior competition."
Stanford most certainly did not excel in
Los Angeles on Friday. The Bruins (12-3-
0) dominated every phase of the game,
allowing the Cardinal a season-low three
shots on goal, while efficiently capitalizing
on their own scoring opportunities, col
lecting their three tallies on only 10 shots.
While the UCLA loss was certainly dis
heartening, it was not entirely unexpect
ed. The Bruins were national champions
last year, and it was highly unlikely that a
Cardinal win would knock UCLA from its
playoff slot
The San Diego State game, however,
was a different story. The Aztecs (10-1-4)

came into their match against Stanford
tied with the Cardinal for sixth place in
the NCAA Division I West region. In the
eyes of Lindores and others, the two
squads were on a crash course in which
only one would emerge with an NCAA bid.
Yesterday's matchup was one of the
toughest and most frustrating for Stan
ford this season. After a scoreless first

half, the Cardinal's Lance Killian knocked
in his third goal of the season early in the
second period off assists from Ryan
Collins and Brandon Farley.
Stanford retained a slim 1-0 edge for
almost the entire second half. With just 30
seconds to play in regulation, an Aztec
goal sent the game into overtime. After
the two squads traded goals in the first

overtime period, the match ended in one
of the most bitter ties of the season for the
Cardinal.
The San Diego game brought back
memories of last season's matchup, when
Stanford's Jason Vanacour scored with 25
seconds left in regulation, only to see the
Aztecs tie the contest with nine ticks left
on the clock.
