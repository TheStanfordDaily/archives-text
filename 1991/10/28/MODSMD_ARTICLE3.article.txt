# Stanford not affected by speech-code ruling
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
A federal judge's decision earli
er this month that the University
of Wisconsin at Madison's speech
code is unconstitutional has rekin
dled the debate over a similar set
of regulations at Stanford.

The Wiscon
sin code was
challenged by the
American Civil
Liberties Union
on behalf of stu
dents charged
with its violation.
The code bar
red comments or
epithets regard-

ing a person's race, sex, religion,
sexual orientation or disability that
create a "hostile learning environ
ment" for the person at whom the
slurs are directed.
Stanford's own code, according
to Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, a
constitutional law specialist, "is
by nature very similar."
According to Assoc. General
Counsel Iris Brest, such a case
"does not directly affect us by virtue
of the fact that the First Amend
ment was written in terms of states.
The University, as a private institu
tion, does not come under direct
action of its constraints."
As a state institution, Wiscon
sin is bound by federal laws.
Although Stanford is not legally
obligated to adhere to the First
Amendment, the University has
adopted similar guidelines, said
Gunther. And because of Stan
ford's commitment to abide by the
same laws as public institutions, he
added, "the decision deserves care
ful study."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, the
principle author of Stanford's
speech code, felt the Stanford

code would not need to be altered
in the wake of the ruling. "Theirs
is substantially broader. Ours is
more defensible and more tightly
drafted," he said.
Brest said, "This ruling does not
mean anything to us. Just because
one federal court made this deci
sion does not necessarily mean

that we should
feel impelled to do
anything yet."
And Judicial
Affairs Officer
Sally Cole added,
"I have no reason
to believe that
our own interpre
tation is in jeop
ardy."

According to Stanford's June
1990 Interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard, "Speech or other
expression constitutes harassment
by personal vilification if it:
• is intended to insult or stig
matize an individual or a small
number of individuals on the
basis or their sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion or national and ethnic origin;
• is addressed directly to the
individual or individuals whom it
insults or stigmatizes; and
• makes use of insulting or
'fighting' words or non-verbal
symbols."
Wisconsin's speech code for
bade any comment, epithet or
other expressive behavior that:
• is discriminatory, directed at
an individual and lacks an intel
lectual basis;
• demeans the race, sex, religion,
etc. of that person or group; and
• creates an intimidating, hos
tile or demeaning environment.
The Board of Regents at Wis
consin asserted that their code fell
