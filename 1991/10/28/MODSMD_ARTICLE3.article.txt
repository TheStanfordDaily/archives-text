# Stanford not affected by speech-code ruling
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
A federal judge's decision earli
er this month that the University
of Wisconsin at Madison's speech
code is unconstitutional has rekin
dled the debate over a similar set
of regulations at Stanford.

The Wiscon
sin code was
challenged by the
American Civil
Liberties Union
on behalf of stu
dents charged
with its violation.
The code bar
red comments or
epithets regard-

ing a person's race, sex, religion,
sexual orientation or disability that
create a "hostile learning environ
ment" for the person at whom the
slurs are directed.
Stanford's own code, according
to Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, a
constitutional law specialist, "is
by nature very similar."
According to Assoc. General
Counsel Iris Brest, such a case
"does not directly affect us by virtue
of the fact that the First Amend
ment was written in terms of states.
The University, as a private institu
tion, does not come under direct
action of its constraints."
As a state institution, Wiscon
sin is bound by federal laws.
Although Stanford is not legally
obligated to adhere to the First
Amendment, the University has
adopted similar guidelines, said
Gunther. And because of Stan
ford's commitment to abide by the
same laws as public institutions, he
added, "the decision deserves care
ful study."
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, the
principle author of Stanford's
speech code, felt the Stanford

code would not need to be altered
in the wake of the ruling. "Theirs
is substantially broader. Ours is
more defensible and more tightly
drafted," he said.
Brest said, "This ruling does not
mean anything to us. Just because
one federal court made this deci
sion does not necessarily mean

that we should
feel impelled to do
anything yet."
And Judicial
Affairs Officer
Sally Cole added,
"I have no reason
to believe that
our own interpre
tation is in jeop
ardy."

According to Stanford's June
1990 Interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard, "Speech or other
expression constitutes harassment
by personal vilification if it:
• is intended to insult or stig
matize an individual or a small
number of individuals on the
basis or their sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion or national and ethnic origin;
• is addressed directly to the
individual or individuals whom it
insults or stigmatizes; and
• makes use of insulting or
'fighting' words or non-verbal
symbols."
Wisconsin's speech code for
bade any comment, epithet or
other expressive behavior that:
• is discriminatory, directed at
an individual and lacks an intel
lectual basis;
• demeans the race, sex, religion,
etc. of that person or group; and
• creates an intimidating, hos
tile or demeaning environment.
The Board of Regents at Wis
consin asserted that their code fell


Gunther


Grey
within the "fighting words" ratio
nale, a concept defined by the 1942
U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
Chaplinsky vs. New Hampshire.
In Chaplinsky, the Court ruled
that "fighting words," — "words
which by their very utterance
inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace" —
are not protected by the First
Amendment's guarantees of free

speech.
Stanford's speech code also
rests heavily upon this rationale.
In the Wisconsin opinion, how
ever, U.S. District Judge Robert
Warren stated that since Chaplin
sky, the Court "has limited the
fighting words definition so that it
now includes only its second half."
To qualify as "fighting words,"
the words must also "naturally
tend to provoke violent resent
ment . . . and be directed at the
person of the hearer."
The Wisconsin ruling "rejects a
good chunk of Grey's theories,"

said Law Prof. William Cohen.
"The decision knocks one of
the props out of the Stanford
code," added Gunther.
But according to Grey, "the fact
that theirs was struck down
doesn't mean that ours would be."
Cohen said this depends on
"whether or not the decision of
the federal court judge's opinion
will stand up."
Officials at Wisconsin have not
yet decided whether to appeal the
judge's ruling.
Wisconsin follows the Univer
sity of Michigan as the second

state institution whose speech
code has been struck down. The
code was enacted to address the
increasing number of incidents of
racial and discriminatory harass
ment on the Madison campus.
According to Gunther, Stan
ford's code "was never proposed
to address a specific action. It was
a wholly symbolic gesture
designed to show that the Univer
sity is sympathetic to the con
cerns of the 14th Amendment
regarding an equal opportunity
for education and freedom from
harassment."

The Board of Regents at Wis
consin asserted that their code fell

Grey
within the "fighting words" ratio
nale, a concept defined by the 1942
U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
Chaplinsky vs. New Hampshire.
In Chaplinsky, the Court ruled
that "fighting words," — "words
which by their very utterance
inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace" —
are not protected by the First
Amendment's guarantees of free

speech.
Stanford's speech code also
rests heavily upon this rationale.
In the Wisconsin opinion, how
ever, U.S. District Judge Robert
Warren stated that since Chaplin
sky, the Court "has limited the
fighting words definition so that it
now includes only its second half."
To qualify as "fighting words,"
the words must also "naturally
tend to provoke violent resent
ment . . . and be directed at the
person of the hearer."
The Wisconsin ruling "rejects a
good chunk of Grey's theories,"

said Law Prof. William Cohen.
"The decision knocks one of
the props out of the Stanford
code," added Gunther.
But according to Grey, "the fact
that theirs was struck down
doesn't mean that ours would be."
Cohen said this depends on
"whether or not the decision of
the federal court judge's opinion
will stand up."
Officials at Wisconsin have not
yet decided whether to appeal the
judge's ruling.
Wisconsin follows the Univer
sity of Michigan as the second

state institution whose speech
code has been struck down. The
code was enacted to address the
increasing number of incidents of
racial and discriminatory harass
ment on the Madison campus.
According to Gunther, Stan
ford's code "was never proposed
to address a specific action. It was
a wholly symbolic gesture
designed to show that the Univer
sity is sympathetic to the con
cerns of the 14th Amendment
regarding an equal opportunity
for education and freedom from
harassment."
