# RELIGION AT STANFORD
## Non-Christians search for their niche 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
When asked how it feels to be
Jewish at Stanford, freshman
Peri Friedman explained, "I'm
missing my religion a little bit
right now."
Her statement echoes the first
experiences of many of Stanford's
non-Christian students who have
searched to find a religious niche
in Stanford's array of communi
ties.
Senior Mohamad Ali added
that without the influence of par
ents and an established system at
home, "You have to seek out the
group yourself, if and when you
want to, and you grow up a little
in the process."
But with a schedule that is cen
tered around Christian holy days,
upholding another religious iden
tity — or a non-religious identity
— has not been an easy process
for many students. One senior
noted, "People who are Christian
don't really realize how Christian
the campus is."
Students in past years have
expressed frustration at the Uni
versity's scheduling of orientation
or the first day of classes on or

around Yom Kippur or Rosh
Hashanah. On these and other
holidays, Jewish students must
choose between celebrating and
going to class. But, "No one would
think of going to school on Christ
mas," said senior Missi Rubenzik.
Some groups such as the
Hindu community celebrate festi
vals on the nearest weekend to
the actual date. "It does feel
somewhat artificial to celebrate
on another day," senior Radha
Rangarahan said. "But I realize
that we are such a small minority
here that the University can't
address our situation."
Several Jewish students point
ed out that having a break around
Christmas, even though it is
called "Winter Break," has undu
ly increased the emphasis placed
on Hanukkah — which is tradi
tionally a small holiday — just
because of its proximity to Christ
mas.
One senior who is an atheist
said she would rather have a com
pletely secularized calendar, but
not at the expense of hurting peo
ple who are attached to the beliefs
behind the system.
Several Jewish students said it
was difficult to adjust to the fact

that most people at Stanford seem
to know little about Judaism. "In
high school, all my non-Jewish
friends came over for Jewish holi
days and knew what they all
meant," one senior explained.
"But when I was a freshman here
I felt like I needed to be 'Super-
Jew' and celebrate really loudly
just so people would know about"
Jewish holidays.
Other non-Christian students
also said they felt separate from
the general community but have
not responded the same way to
the unfamiliarity; instead, they
have found other students inter
ested in their beliefs and culture.
Coterminal student Lajeshwar
Singh said people do wonder
about his turban but are general
ly friendly and curious.
And many foreign students, in
turn, view the Christian tradi
tions they observe at Stanford as
an opportunity to learn more
about another culture. For them,
encountering a different faith is
only one aspect of adjusting to life
not only at a new school but also
in a new country.
"Certainly I miss celebrating
Hindu festivals on the scale that
we do at home, but there are so

many parts I miss about India,
and religion isn't necessarily the
most important one," Rangara
han said.
Often questions arise over
campus Christian traditions,
especially during the Christmas
season when the focus is often on
Christmas trees, carols and dorm
gift exchanges. Rubenzik objects
to having a Christmas tree in her
residence because that "makes it
not home."
Senior Sarah Bernstein noted
a Christmas tree wouldn't bother
her the way a nativity scene
would. And for many students,
Christmas trees only symbolize
the secularization of Christmas.
Like many non-Christian stu
dents, senior Quan Phung, a Bud
dhist, says he personally views
holiday time as an opportunity to
get together with family and
friends rather than a religious
occasion.
As a resident assistant in Alon
dra, though, Phung realizes that
when December rolls around, his
dormitory will confront issues
that run deeper than creating an
Equally Attractive, Non-Reli
giously Affiliated name for the
holiday gift exchange.
