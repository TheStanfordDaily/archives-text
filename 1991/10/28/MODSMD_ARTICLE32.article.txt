# Gregg brings the 'religious dimension' to multiculturalism
## 
### Josh Walker 
Robert Gregg thinks Stanford has
glossed over one very important "face"
of its multicultural community.
"If you have all kinds of conversa
tions, discussions and programs that
talk about ethnic background, ethnic
custom and all this stuff and do not take
in consideration the religious dimension
of a culture, I think there are real limits
to how far you're going to go, how deep
the conversation will ever get," he said.
Since the fall of 1987, Gregg has been
overseeing the religious aspects of the
University community as dean of the
chapel.
Gregg came to Stanford from Duke
University, where he had taught religious
history since 1974. He was ordained an
Episcopalian priest in 1968, but his posi
tion at Duke was purely academic.
As a historian, he developed an inter
est in religious interactions, which led
him to accept the Stanford position.
"It's possible that one of the things
that interested me in this job is that I
might be able to see the interaction
between religious groups, including the
consciously non-religious, in a modern,
specific setting at a historically interest
ing moment," Gregg explained.
He said Stanford's location added to
his decision because of "the richness of
the cultural and ethnic diversity that is
a bit mind-boggling to someone who
spent 15 years in the southeast United
States."

"I think one of the things that I've
found interesting and really challenging
to me [about California] is . . . that there
is a pretty widespread assumption that
religion is for the unthinking. I don't
understand that," Gregg said.
And the scope of his interests lead
directly into Gregg's vision of his job as
one that has two "specific but different
roles."
"The first focus of my work," he said,
"is to try to bring different communities
and persons of commitment — which
means both people of religious commit
ment and also people who are commit
ted to being a-religious — into some
kind of conversation which generates
the right kind of spark [of] understand
ing and hopefully tolerance."
The other aspect of his work deals
more specifically with his own beliefs.
"One of my jobs is to make sure that
I present a case for my crowd in its most
compelling and I hope most flexible and
welcome way to other points of view,"
Gregg said.
"Sometimes when I talk about this,
people say, 'Well, you want everyone to
convert to religion.' I'm not opposed to
that — I think some fairly good things
could happen to people if they embrace
beliefs in a smart and committed way . . .
— but that's not my point. My point is if
we're working toward some kind of
mutual understanding, you can't ignore
this dimension of culture."
According to Gregg, the controversy
surrounding the Stanford Band's depic

tion of religion during the Oct. 5 Stan
ford-Notre Dame game was one example
of the importance of this understanding.
Gregg said he has a certain amount of
tolerance for religious humor ("I like
Monty Python," he said.), but "what I
found interesting was that the people
that I've talked to really couldn't imag
ine why anyone would be bent out of
shape by someone attacking or ridicul
ing or making fun of their religious tra
dition.
"How could you not know that that
set of symbols would be important to a
bunch of people? It gets back to my sus
picion of a very high level of cluelessness
about religion and people's fairly fer
vent connection to their religious lives."
Gregg's position at Stanford is not
limited to religion, and one reason he
enjoys his work is that he still has a con
nection with the classroom. He teaches
courses in both the Religious Studies
and Classics Departments, including a
fall course on Greek and Roman reli
gious texts and a spring course about
the Gospel of Mark.
And Gregg has been balancing this
combination of academics and religion
his whole life.
"The set of Christian symbols, values
and questions and assumptions have
always been kind of orienting for me as
an intellectual," he explained. "Even
while I was growing up, intellectually I
had this baggage in a positive sense — I
had a suitcase, and I had something in
it."
