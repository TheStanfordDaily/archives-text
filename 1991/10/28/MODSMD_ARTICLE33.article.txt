# CIV students see the Bible in a new light

When a Cultures, Ideas and Values profes
sor picks apart the Bible as a literary work, stu
dents who for years have treasured the Bible as
the word of God often have a hard time adjust
ing to this fundamentally different perspective.
According to Classics Prof. Mark Edwards,
who lectures in the Humanities CIV track,
CIV professors chose the Bible as a common
text because it is the basis for the major West
ern religions. In lecture, though, he does not
place much emphasis on the Bible as a reli
gious text, but rather treats it as "writings of
a people in the ancient world, like ['The Epic
of) Gilgamesh.' "
He emphasized that he makes an effort to
"leave it completely open for people to accept
it as the revealed word of God" but noted, "It's
a good thing for students to see the Bible from
a non-religious point of view."
Not all CIV students agree. Some with
strong religious backgrounds said they feel
uncomfortable with this approach.

"It's a strange experience to have
[Edwards] dissect my faith that way, to see
him trivialize everything that I consider so
important," said freshman Judy Chi.
And freshman John Hebert objected to the
way Edwards portrayed the Bible as just
another creation myth. "I'm very religious,
and that sort of pissed me off," he said.
"It just depends on the style of the section
leader," freshman Yoon-Hee Cha said. "Some
times they try so hard to sound like they're
not preaching that they go so much in the
other direction and make the Bible sound like
just another book."
Other students said they feel uneasy
because they don't think their classmates
understand their religious point of view.
"I was put on the defensive because I'm
probably the only one in the class who really
believes in the Bible," freshman Justin Rock
wood said, noting that his comments "were
just shot down."
Some of the actively religious students,
though, say they like the approach.
"I went to a Catholic high school, and even

there we acknowledged the fact that the Old
Testament was a creation myth — a myth
with an important message in it, of course,"
freshman Jenny Beltran said.
And many students who do not hold strong
religious beliefs also agree with the professors'
teaching styles.
"I like that they teach the Bible as litera
ture — like a book someone has written — and
not as religion or even as history," said fresh
man John Borland.
