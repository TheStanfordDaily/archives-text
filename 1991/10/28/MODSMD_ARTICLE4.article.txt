# Disabled residents angry over limited accessibility

Editor's note: The following is the first of
two articles examining the issue of disabil
ity access to University buildings.
Disabled students Living in Kimball Hall
have no problem getting around on the first
floor. But the second floor is another matter.
Kimball, which opened this fall, and
Manzanita 11, which is under construction
and scheduled to open next fall, are
wheelchair-accessible on the first floor
only. In fact, no undergraduate residences
provide wheelchair accessibility beyond the
first floor.

Many disabled students living in Kim
ball resent the lack of accessibility to other
floors, particularly since the University
had the option of installing an elevator in
the new building.
"I feel a pretty big limitation," said fresh
man Eric Horn, a mobility-impaired Kim
ball resident. "Not being able to just pop by
and visit my friends makes a big difference."
According to New Residence Project
Coordinator Robin Hensley, first-floor
accessibility was a practical choice based on
the funding limitations for the construc
tion of the buildings. "Given the different
demands on the project and pro
ject budget, it was decided that
an elevator was not an afford
able option," she said.
But some believe an elevator
is a necessity, rather than an
option, for campus dormitories.
"If you don't have the money
to build the building with the ele
vator, than you don't have the
money to build the building,"
said Molly Sandperl, head of the
Disability Resource Center.
Adding an elevator to Manzani
ta II would cost an estimated
$150,000 to $200,000 and would
delay the opening of the dormitory.
According to some disabled
students, the lack of second
floor accessibility hinders their
ability to meet dormmates and
fully participate in dorm activi
ties, issues of particular rele
vance at a school that empha
sizes residential education.
"The dorm should have an ele
vator so that disabled students
can have a flavor of full residen
tial education," said senior Jeff
Lucas, a Kimball resident who is
mobility-impaired.
And sophomore Tony Wagner,
another disabled Kimball resi
dent, agreed. "Without an eleva
tor, there is a deficit of communi
ty feeling," he said, adding that
disabled students are "losing a lot
of the advantages of Kimball."
Because new residences, such
as Kimball and Manzanita 11, are
wheelchair-accessible only on
the first floor, University plan

ners included laundry, comput
er, seminar and lounge facilities
on the first floor of the buildings.
"A lot of thought and considera
tion went into making the build
ings accessible," said Hensley.
Automatic door openers, accessible

bathrooms and specially designed
furniture and rooms were all
included in the building plans.
An accessibility consultant
was also called in to look over the
plans for the two dormitories.
But some disabled students

don't think planners did enough.
"You're very limited in whom
you can visit. That's not the def
inition of accessibility," said
senior Michelle Kramer, a stu
dent with an arthritic condition
that limits her mobility.
