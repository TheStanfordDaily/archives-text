# Stanford gains $10 million if biography unpublished

Stanford stands to gain $10 million if
the Christian Science Church fails to pub
lish and distribute a controversial biogra
phy by 1993.
The biography — written approximately
40 years ago by the now deceased Bliss
Napp — is about church "discoverer and
founder Mary Baker Eddy," spokesperson
Gilbert Robinson said. Napp, whose father
was a student of Eddy's, was a teacher and
lecturer for the church.
Originally, the church refused to pub
lish the book because it refers to Eddy as a
deity, which many Christian Scientists
consider sacrilegious. Napp went ahead
and had it published privately but could
not sell it in Christian Science reading
rooms because they may only distribute
materials published by the Christian Sci
ence Publishing Society.
Napp's wife and sister both left large
endowments to the church in their wills,
but with certain conditions attached to
them. One endowment, worth $20 million,
requires that the Christian Science Pub
lishing Society publish Napp's book and
make it readily available in Christian Sci
ence reading rooms across the country.

If these conditions aren't met by 1993,
then the $20 million is to be divided equal
ly between Stanford University and the
Los Angeles County Museum. If the condi
tions are met before then, the Mother
Church in Boston receives the money. The
Mother Church is the international head
quarters for the Christian Science Church.
Robinson didn't say why Stanford was
selected as a recipient.
The second endowment, estimated to be
worth $70 million, has similar conditions,
but its "time limit" doesn't expire for many
years. Stanford may not necessarily be the
beneficiary of that endowment.
Meeting the conditions specified in the
wills is slightly complicated for the Mother
Church. Although Napp's biography has
recently been published by the Christian
Science Publishing Society, the Mother
Church does not have the authority to
insist that it be sold in all Christian Science
reading rooms.
Individual congregations decide demo
cratically which materials, of those made
available by the church, they would like to
distribute in their reading rooms.
Robinson said Napp's biography is being
sold in the vast majority of Christian Sci
ence reading rooms.
