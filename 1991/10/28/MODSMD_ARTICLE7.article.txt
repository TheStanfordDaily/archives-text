Daily wins kudos
The Stanford Daily has been named a regional Pacemaker by
the Associated Collegiate Press.
Twelve daily newspapers from four-year colleges were recog
nized nationwide for this honor. The Daily was selected, along
with the University of Southern California's Daily Trojan, as
winners for the west.
More than 50 colleges nationwide submitted entries into this
competition, which was judged by the managing editor and city
editor of the Delaware State News.
The awards ceremony will be held Saturday, at the Associated
Collegiate Press national convention in Denver, Colo. The win
ners of the national Pacemaker competition will be first
announced at that time.
Gas leak causes a stink
A minor natural gas leak was detected and repaired at the old
steam plant yesterday afternoon.
According to Capt. Bruce Hallberg of the Palo Alto Fire
Department, someone working in a nearby University building
called the department after detecting the odor from the gas leak.
When they arrived on the scene, firefighters could still smell
the gas, Hallberg said.
"We let our noses do the leading," said Hallberg, adding that
natural gas has a very pungent odor and can be detected in very
small quantities.
The leak was detected in the packing around the valve of a
supply line leading to the old steam plant, according to Hallberg.
The steam plant is located next to the cogeneration facility
between Via Ortega and Jordan Way on Campus Drive.
A service representative from Pacific Gas and Electric was
called in to repair the valve.
Stanford doctors ex her cyst
Surgeons at the Stanford Hospital removed a 303-pound ovar
ian cyst from a 34-year old woman last week.
Katherine O'Hanlan, the cancer surgeon who conducted the
surgery, believes the cyst to be the largest of its type in history.
"None of us could lift it," she said.
The growth was "a lot of little cysts growing together in one
three-foot diameter mass," said O'Hanlan. "It's like a water bal
loon that contains many other balloons," she said.
The patient, who is 5 feet 10 inches tall, now weighs 210
pounds. She is not married and was living with relatives "who
would cook for her and do other things," said O'Hanlan.
The cyst was first noticed 10 years ago, but "really grew dur
ing the last two years."
