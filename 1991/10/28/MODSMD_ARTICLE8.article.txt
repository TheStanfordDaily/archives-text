Barry goes directly to jail
WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Mayor
Marion Barry headed for a minimum-security
prison Saturday to begin a six-month sentence for
a misdemeanor cocaine conviction.
"I stand here mentally, physically, emotionally
and spiritually prepared to report to ... federal
prison," he said at a news conference at his home
before he left for the prison at Petersburg, Va. "God
has given me the strength and courage to carry on."
Barry, who continued to maintain he was
unfairly singled out for a jail sentence because he
was a leading black politician, was flanked by his
mother and nearly 100 supporters. He did not seek
re-election after the trial.

alliance capable of assuring a speedy transfer of
power to the people."
