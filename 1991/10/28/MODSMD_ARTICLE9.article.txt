# Israeli, Arab leaders await talks, disputes linger

### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — Israeli and Arab
leaders said yesterday they were eager to
begin historic Middle East peace talks, but
last-minute wrangling persisted over a mav
erick Palestinian delegate who openly stated
allegiance to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
The delegates also gave hints of flexibili
ty on key issues such as the future of Israeli
occupied territories, but no conces
sions were mentioned.
The conference, the first face-to-face
meeting between Israel and its Arab neigh
bors in more than 40 years, is set to open
Wednesday in the Spanish capital under
intense security.
"What we know is that without negotia
tions we will never have peace," said Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who will
lead his team. "Therefore, we are happy to
start negotiations."
In Syria — Israel's most implacable
enemy — President Hafez Assad said in a
televised interview, "We do not seek
destruction. Rather, we want a comprehen
sive and just peace."
Yet a dispute over PLO influence on the
conference lingered.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens
accused Palestinians of deliberately trying
"to scuttle the negotiations" after
Palestinian delegate Saeb Erekat claimed
last week that the Palestinian-Jordanian
team was representing the PLO.
But later, the lead Palestinian negotiator,
Haider Abdel-Shafi, said Erekat was not a
PLO official and termed his statements "a

little provocative." However, Abdel-Shafi
said he saw no need for Erekat's removal.
Arens said he was "glad to hear" Abdel-
Shafi's statement and thought the dispute
could be settled. Israel has refused to nego
tiate with the PLO, which it considers a ter
ror group.
In Madrid, anti-terrorist squads fanned
out, and sharpshooters took to the roof of
the ornate 18th-century Royal Palace,
where the conference will be held. Armored
personnel carriers staked positions around
the granite building.
Police were particularly concerned about
possible attacks by radical Palestinian fac
tions or Basque separatists who detonated
three car bombs in Madrid earlier this
month, killing an army officer.
Behind the scenes, organizers met with
the delegates to work out such details as
seating arrangements and the order of
speeches after President George Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev open the
conference as co-sponsors.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
he may come to Madrid if he is joined by
other Arab leaders.
Organizers planned for the direct talks to
begin following 2 % days of opening speech
es.
"There are going to be interruptions.
There are going to be glitches," said
Secretary of State James Baker in a tele
vised interview. "We should not go into this
conference thinking that this 2 l A to three
days is going to produce peace in the
Mideast."
