We all leave our legacy.
Sure, you could settle for bronzed baby
shoes...but we suspect you aspire to some
thing more profound.
Microsoft lets you do work with enduring
results. You'll see the impact of your efforts
right away on the shelves of computer stores
worldwide. You'll read about your products
in major industry publications. Hear about
them directly from users.
You'll accomplish monumental things in
a progressive environment thats expressly
tailored for rugged individualists. We're not
into suits or ties. Or regimented hours.
At Microsoft, we back you with every
thing we've got...and let you run with it.
If you're pursuing a Bachelor's, Master's
or PhD degree in Computer Science, Electri
cal Engineering, Math, Physics or a related
discipline, come talk with us at the Informa
tion Session.
Don't settle for the bronze when you can
go for the gold. Help us create the future of
personal computing. Isn't that what you were
born for?
We are an equal opportunity employer
and are working toward a more culturally
diverse workplace.
