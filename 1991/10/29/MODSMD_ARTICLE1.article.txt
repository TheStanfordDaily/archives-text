## Committee begins months-long process 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Stanford's ninth president will be identi
fied this spring by a 15-member committee
that will be chaired by Stanford trustee
John Lillie, University officials announced
yesterday.
The committee — selected by Board of
Trustees President James Gaither from
nominations made by the Faculty Senate,
University organizations and the ASSU —
includes six trustees, six faculty members,
an alumnus, a staff member and a student.
Faculty Senate Chair James Sheehan will
be vice chair of the committee. Former Dean
of Admission Jean Fetter will be the com
mittee's executive vice chair, planning day
to-day operations.
The committee met last night to develop
a timetable for the presidential search pro
cess and to decide on such preliminary ques
tions as whether to employ an outside
search agency. (See separate story, page 2.)
The Board has directed the committee to

decide on a candidate by June, but Lillie said
yesterday that his committee will set its
schedule in order to finish "earlier than that
— perhaps a couple of months earlier."
The committee will meet again Nov. 14
and continue to meet throughout winter
and spring.
Lillie said the committee will conduct the
search as "openly" as possible. However,
candidate names will be confidential.
"In order to attract the very best nomi
nees we have to assure them that their con
fidentiality will be protected," Lillie said.
The first stage of the process will involve
the development of criteria for evaluating
candidates, Gaither said yesterday. Lillie
added that that stage will be the most broad
ly consultative.
"We want to be accessible and encourage
input," he said.
"There will be extensive outreach with
the community," Gaither added.

received a few uj ; •>! itrd nomina

before you be an."
