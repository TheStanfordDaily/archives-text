Trustee and search committee member Peter
Bing was a member of the committee that chose Don
ald Kennedy as Stanford's eighth president in 1980.
The committee set mid-January as a deadline
for applications and nominations, Lillie said.
The committee will solicit nominations in a
series of advertisements. Committee members will
also request the advice of figures in higher educa
tion and government.
"We have access to people that will be able to do
a very good job developing candidates," Lillie said.
"Then we're going to get very quiet because
we're into the confidential part of the job," he added.
Although the Board of Trustees has directed the
committee to produce a choice by the end of spring
quarter, Lillie said the committee will "operate on
a faster schedule" that could be completed "a cou
ple of months earlier."
A subcommittee will develop procedures for
consulting the Stanford community as the com
mittee develops presidential selection criteria. The
subcommittee will report to the full committee at
its next meeting Nov. 14.
The committee will then conduct formal inter
views with University constituencies, Lillie said.
But he added that the process of internal consulta
tion will begin immediately.
"All the committee members are going to be
available to the community," he said.
