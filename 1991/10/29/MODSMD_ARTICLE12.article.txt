# Yeltsin proposes market economy to save Russia

MOSCOW (AP) - Russian
President Boris Yeltsin proposed yes
terday a painful one-year leap to a
market economy for Russia and said
the hardships consumers will suffer
would he better than the alternative of
eternal poverty.
Yeltsin invited the other 11 Soviet
republics to join his speedy reform
plan, which would free state-controlled
prices and privatize most businesses in
Russia. But he also said Russia was
prepared to act unilaterally.
He served notice that Russia would
form its own army and print its own
currency if other regions' increasingly
aggressive independence drives hurt
the largest and richest Soviet republic.
Yeltsin's timetable for economic
reform was the fastest and most

aggressive proposed by any level of gov
ernment in the Soviet Union, including
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Previous Kremlin plans to move to a
market economy have fallen short
because of half-hearted implementa
tion or the refusal of the entrenched
Communist bureaucracy to cooperate.
Yeltsin's blunt acknowledgement
that living standards will get worse
before they improve was the most can
did political admission of how tough it
will be to dismantle seven decades of
bureaucratic central planning.
"Today, in acute crisis conditions, it
will be impossible to implement
reforms painlessly," Yeltsin told the
Russian Congress of People's Deputies,
the republic's parliament.
"I call on all Russian citizens to

understand that a transition to market
prices, a difficult transition, a forced
transition, is a necessary measure,"
Yeltsin said. "It will be worse for every
body for about six months."
After that, he predicted, "the stabi
lization of our economy will begin by
autumn 1992 and the living standards
of the people will gradually improve."
Yeltsin urged that lawmakers give
him new executive powers to help him
carry out the reforms and proposed he
be given the additional title of prime
minister. The post has been vacant
since Ivan Silayev resigned to run the
national economy following the failed
August coup.
The offer was a tacit acknowledge
ment that Yeltsin has been unable to
end the infighting within his adminis

tration that has prevented it from car
rying out real reform.
It also represented a throwback to
previous heads of the Soviet Union
who endowed themselves with more
than one leadership post.
Yeltsin's reform plan, which must
be adopted by the Russian parliament,
includes lifting artificial government
controls on prices and wages by the end
of the year and privatizing half of
Russia's 10,000 small- and medium
size businesses within three months.
Beginning Friday, he said, Russia
will stop financing about 70 Soviet
ministries and other central institu
tions not specifically mentioned in an
economic community treaty signed by
Yeltsin and the leaders of seven other
republics earlier this month.
