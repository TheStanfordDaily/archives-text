# Democratic opposition to ex-Klansman Duke intensifies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats yesterday
predicted severe economic consequences for
Louisiana if Republican David Duke is elected gover
nor and said President Bush should declare him a
morally unacceptable choice for voters.
State and national party officials stopped short of
saying Bush should endorse former Democratic Gov.
Edwin Edwards, Duke's opponent in the Nov. 16
runoff. But they said Bush's statement Friday that
he could never support Duke did not go far enough.
"We don't think the president has made clear
what outcome he wants," said Paul Tully, political
director of the Democratic National Committee.
"He ought to make it clear that David Duke is not
a morally acceptable alternative," said Democratic
pollster Geoffrey Garin.
Garin said the race hinges on supporters of
Republican Gov. Buddy Roemer, who did not win a
slot in the runoff. Bush's words and actions could
influence their votes and bear on whether Duke is

elected, Garin said.
Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and Nazi
sympathizer, is a state legislator making his second
statewide run for office. In 1990, running as a
Republican repudiated by the national party, he
received 58 percent of the white vote in an unsuc
cessful challenge to Democratic Sen. Bennett
Johnston.
Garin said Duke would have to get at least 66 per
cent of white votes in order to win next month's
runoff, assuming a high black turnout going almost
entirely to Edwards.
He said his own post-election polling in 1990 and
Edwards' weaknesses as a candidate indicate "there
is enough available vote out there for David Duke"
to reach that threshold.
Edwards served three terms as governor during
which he beat a racketeering charge and developed a
reputation for womanizing and gambling. Louisiana
state Democratic Chairman Jim Brady on yesterday

depicted Edwards as an effective governor.
Brady also indicated Democrats would highlight
fears among business and community leaders that a
Duke victory could be a major economic blow to the
state.
"The people that are involved in the convention
industry, particularly in New Orleans, are horrified
at the prospect of what would happen," Brady said.
He said the boycotts of Arizona after then-Gov. Evan
Mecham rescinded the state's Martin Luther King
holiday would seem mild compared to the backlash
against a Duke win in Louisiana.
"People are not going to look on Louisiana as a
place to come and do their business or hold their
meetings," he said. '
Also yesterday, the head of the Republican
Governors Association, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, said Duke was "touching a nerve" with
his message but wouldn't get a warm welcome from
the GOP group.
