## Ban the big blaze 
### 
Good taste requires
that Stanford call off
the bonfire this year

STANFORD DOESN'T HAVE
a reputation for being the
classiest school in the nation.
In fact, Stanford students pride
themselves on their pervasive
irreverent attitude — an attitude
that gives the University its most
cherished distinction from its
stuffy, ivy-covered brethren.
Stanford's non-marching band,
its annual Halloween party on top
of Jane's and Leland's decaying
corpses — these are the things
that makes this place Stanford, the
very things that make Yalies cringe
as they intelligently debate the
pros and cons of taking the "No
Girls" sign off the Skull and Bones
clubhouse.
But, however irreverent Stan
ford may be, it is also able to rec
ognize that some things are in bad
taste. Building an enormous fire to
pump students up for a football
game against their UC-Berkeley
rivals — just four short weeks
after a devastating fire destroyed
some of that community — is in
bad taste.
Although a long-standing rival
ry can serve as a fun and impor
tant way to help bond a communi
ty, such a rivalry loses much of its
joy when taken to a cold-hearted
extreme.
Each year, some students take
the rivalry to such an extreme and
consequently damage the inher
ently friendly nature of the rivalry.
In the past, Stanford students
have rightfully complained about
this rivalry being taken too far by
some Berkeley students who had
spray-painted the Thinker,
attacked Stanford Band members
on the field or, ironically, pulled
Branner fire alarms.
Going ahead with this year's
bonfire would be a similar depar
ture from the friendly rivalry that

the two campuses have cherished
for many years.
Lighting a large fire in the mid
dle of Lake Lagunita would be an
unsympathetic, unsportsmanlike
slap in the face to the students and
other members of the Berkeley
community, many of whom lost
their housing in the fire.
Besides the damage done to
campus student housing, many
students come from the area and
have had the homes they grew up
in ruined by the tragedy.
In light of what has occurred,
possibly the worst fire in Califor
nia's history, it seems that spend
ing nearly $15,000 on a jubilant
conflagration is in bad taste.
Stanford students should still
head over to Lake Lag after Gai
eties and gather together before
the big event. They would still be
able to listen to Denny Green and
Bob Murphy and cheer the football
team to victory.
But this year, in a show of respect
for the tragedy that has occurred at
.our rival school, the Stanford com
munity should have some class and
not light the actual bonfire.
It may be a little colder out
there on the Lake, but the Stan
ford spirit inside of each and every
student will warm them up just as
well as any bonfire ever could.
The experience, although maybe
not as awe-inspiring as it has been
in years past, would still serve as a
rallying point for Big Game, and
the speeches and songs could still
be enjoyed by the students as they
congregate in the dry mud they call
a lake.
At the same time, not holding
the bonfire this year would make
the point to Berkeley students
that, although they are rivals,
Stanford respects the tragedy they
have so recently endured.
Let's save what money can still
be reclaimed for next year's bon
fire and show both the students of
Berkeley and Stanford that this is
only a rivalry, not an animosity.
Stanford students can afford to
show a little class.
After all, they got in.
