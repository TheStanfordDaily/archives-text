Superb music programs must be kept to draw students

NOW THAT DIFFICULT financial
times and budget cuts are upon
us, I want to express my outrage
and disappointment that musical perfor
mances have been given such a low pri
ority in funding.
Many people believe the performing
arts are a luxury and should be the first
thing to go when money gets tight, but in
my opinion music is just as important as
science and technology because we are
not simply creatures of the mind. As
humans, we are emotional beings as well.
I am a graduate student in the Depart
ment of Genetics, but I am also a violinist
and violist. When I applied for graduate
school, of course, my first concern was for
the scientific environment and research
opportunities at the institution.
But when it came down to making the

final decision between attending Stanford,
Caltech or Johns Hopkins, my attention
turned to my second concern — music.
I chose Stanford over the other schools
mainly because of the many opportunities
available to study and perform music.
Specifically, I was drawn by the presence
of the Stanford String Quartet and the
chance to study with then-first violinist
Andor Toth and violist Bernard Zaslav,
both great musicians and teachers.
Since arriving at Stanford, I have stud
ied privately with both Toth and Zaslav,
studied chamber music with Zaslav and
the current first violinist of the quartet,
Phillip Levy, and played in both the Sym
phony and Chamber Orchestras.
Music has always been a very impor
tant part of my life, and I believe that
the emotional release provided by music

is the only thing that keeps me sane
after spending 12 hours a day in the lab
oratory working toward my degree.
The Music Department not only
attracts students in music and other
fields to Stanford, but also serves to bol
ster Stanford's image locally and abroad,
which is important now more than ever.
The two Stanford Symphony Orches
tra tours to Asia and Central Europe
were very successful in raising the
school's image abroad.
But on a more local level, many Stan
ford student musicians go out into the
community and perform for people who
may not otherwise get a chance to hear
live music: We have played at many
churches, nursing homes and hospitals
— including the V.A. hospital and the
Children's Hospital.

Though not all of these performances
are officially sponsored by the Music
Department, they would not have taken
place without the encouragement and
inspiration of many people in the depart
ment to study and perform as much as
possible. So it is not just for the students
that music is so important; it is also for
the community that the performing arts
at Stanford should receive top priority.
As Stanford begins its second centu
ry, it should be striving to provide a
complete education for students and not
be content with being a technical train
ing ground for scientists and engineers. I
hope an emphasis on musical perfor
mance will remain a priority for many
years to come.
