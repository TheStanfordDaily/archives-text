# Two letters indicative of homophobic biases despite writers' claims
## 
### 
Two letters in the Oct. 17 Daily con
tained statements that were either
homophobic or heterosexual in nature,
and I would like the opportunity to
respond.
Melinda Prosser's letter addressed
the importance of supporting the family
as an "institution" to maintain morality.
While I agree with her statement that
there is "no reason to abandon the fami
ly structure altogether," I feel she goes
too far in stating that the gay/lesbian
movement and AIDS have "attacked"
the family.
Equal rights and protection from
unfair discrimination for gay men, les
bians, bisexuals and even heterosexuals
no more "attack" the notion of "family"
than equal rights and protection for

women or racial or ethnic minorities do.
AIDS attacks the institution of family
no differently than cancer does. If the
institution of family, as Prosser wants it,
is too weak to benefit from a rational,
equal treatment of all its members, then
her structure should give way to one
better suited to notions of equality and
mutual benefit.
Will Inboden's letter, in which he pro
fessed that he was not homophobic,
demonstrated the invisible nature of
heterosexism.
In an attempt to disguise his bias, he
claimed his objections to the extension of
Cowell health benefits to domestic part
ners "lie equally with the privileges
granted to heterosexual as well as homo
sexual 'domestic partners.' My inten
tions are simply to affirm the sanctity of
marriage."
fnboden does not go on, unfortunate
ly, to note that "the sanctity of mar
riage" is available only to those pairing
up with a member of the opposite sex.
Gay men and lesbians interested in
"the sanctity of marriage" of which

Inboden speaks are left out in the cold,
unable to ei\joy the privilege of "legally
binding, publicly declared affirmation of
a commitment to a life-long relation
ship," as he put it. While Inboden's
intentions may not be expressly homo
phobic, they are anti-gay.
