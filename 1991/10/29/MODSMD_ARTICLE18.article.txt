# Intermission article unfairly stereotypes murals at Stern Hall
## 
### 
In the Oct. 24 Intermission, a Food
Service dining guide was published. In
the review on the Stern Hall Dining
Facilities the reporters wrote, "Whether
it was the murals depicting scantly-clad
women and well-defined men ..." At the
end of that review is: "Suggested attire:
Shirt, shoes and BVDs required."

We are deeply offended by these
comments and see them as nothing
more than a continuing Daily insensi
tivity toward the community as a
whole, but in particular to ethnic
theme houses.
The reviews to some of the other din
ing facilities aren't much better except
for those places that the writers person
ally liked. Their humor was off if not
awful.
For those who have never seen the
murals in Casa Zapata, the implied
insinuation is that the wall painting√ü are
racy when in reality that one mural
deals with Mexican and American Indian
mythology of corn. They do not, at all,
emphasize sex or sex organs.
The suggested use of BVDs as attire
to visit Stern Hall Dining Facility is but
an ugly stereotypical implication about
the way our residents dress. We take
great pride in our house and our dining
hall service and demand an apology from
The Daily.
