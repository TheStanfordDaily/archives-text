# At end of 4 years, they'll have lost 30% of budget
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Budget cuts are nothing new to Libraries
and Information Resources.
After all, the area was cut by more than
15 percent during "repositioning" — the
recently-completed $22-million reduction in
administrative services.
Now, Libraries and Information
Resources is facing another round of painful
cuts from last week's deficit plan aimed at
reducing Stanford's operating budget by
$43 million.
By the fall of 1993, the vice-presidential
area will have sliced more than 30 percent
from its budget in four years.
"We reduced a lot of administrative lay
ers and simplified many of the procedures
during repositioning," said Frederick
Biedenweg, assistant vice president for
strategic planning and financial manage
ment. "We tried to minimize the impact on
our clientele.
"It is clear that we are not going to be
able to protect them during this round of
cuts. You will see real reductions in services,
and others are going to have to pick up the
burden," Biedenweg said.
Acquisitions and services faces a 7.5 per
cent cut in its operating budget, and infor
mation resources and parts of the libraries
classified as administrative areas must cut
13.5 percent.
Provost James Rosse characterized the
deficit-reduction targets as being "consis
tent with other programs," and administra

tors within information resources said they
were not surprised by last week's announce
ment.
"All of us understood the magnitude of
the problem and knew we would receive a
large target," said Catherine Gardner, direc
tor for finance and assistant director for
strategic planning.
Biedenweg and Gardner both said that no
decisions have been made on exactly what to
cut, but Biedenweg said they will do their
best to protect student services.
For example, computing services, includ
ing the Meyer and Tresidder computer clus
ters, are unlikely to face significant cuts,
Biedenweg said.
But he added that some faculty have
expressed opposition to the expense of net
working the campus computer system to
dormitory rooms — an opinion he called
"shortsighted." A private company has
already donated some of the equipment for
the project.
Services within the libraries already hurt
by repositioning may undergo further cuts.
For instance, repositioning lengthened the
time it takes a book to be reshelved by two
days.
But Biedenweg said he was not sure if
cuts would come from reshelving, cata
loging, check-out or something else.
"We will not make across-the-board cuts,"
Biedenweg said. Biedenweg declined to spec
ulate whether entire special collections
might be eliminated because the Faculty
Senate Committee on Libraries
has just begun a study of that idea.
In addition to two oversight
committees from the Faculty
Senate, students, faculty and
staff within both the libraries and
information resources sit on
existing committees that will con
sult on the changes.
Biedenweg said information
resources has not "completed the
job of consulting with our clien
tele."
Biedenweg said he will also
talk to the academic associate
deans in the four schools that rely
on the libraries — Humanities
and Sciences, Engineering, Earth
Sciences and Education.
But despite consultations,
painful cuts loom in the next two
years.
"Things are going to get worse
in some ways," Biedenweg said.
"We are just not yet sure what
those ways are."
