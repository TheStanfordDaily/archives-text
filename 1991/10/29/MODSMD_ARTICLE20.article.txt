## Pooh on Stanford 
### 
IT FINALLY HAPPENED. Multicultur
alism reached its logical end. Pooh, yes
Pooh bear, was admitted to Stanford.
How'd it happen? Well, one day Christo
pher Robin asked what Pooh would do if he
could do anything in the world.
"But I can, Christopher," Pooh replied.
"I can roll on my back, climb that tree or
take a nap in that cave over there."
"I know, Pooh. But what do you wish
you could do that you can't just do when
ever you want?"
"Hmm," said Pooh. "You mean any
thing?"
"Yes," Christopher nodded.
"Well, I guess I would get ajar of honey
that never got empty and never got stuck
on my head."
"So why don't you make one?" inquired
Christopher Robin.
"I don't know how," answered Pooh.
"You know that."
"They probably teach it at college,
Pooh."
"What's that?"
"It's school, Pooh."
"Then why don't they just call it that?"
"I don't know. Maybe they think 'col
lege' sounds better."
"Well, how do I go to school, or whatev
er they call it?"
"First you have to apply. Where do you
want to go?"
"Wherever they have the best jar-mak
ers, of course."

"I don't know where that is, but I've
heard of a couple of good places. There's
a place called Yale, but it's in a really dark
and boring place. There's Harvard, but
they're kind of snooty there, and they
take themselves very seriously. Hmm . . .
let's see. There's a place called Stanford."
"What's it like?" asked Pooh, starting
to become very interested at the thought
of his new pot of honey.
"I hear it's pretty nice. The people are
really smart, but they like to act like
they're not."
"That doesn't sound very smart to
me," said Pooh.
"Me neither, but that's what they do. And
they let you take almost anything you want.
You can even design your own mqjor."
"What's a m^jor?"
"Oh, don't worry, Pooh. Most people
there don't know that either."
"You'd feel right at home there â€”
they're not good at keeping track of num
bers either, Pooh. We'll have to make sure
that the jar-making department wasn't
hit too hard by their budget cuts .. . but
it's warm there."
"All right, I'll go," decided Pooh.
Evidently Pooh Bear's creativity
shone through in his honey-covered
application. Or Dean Jean just decided to
take a chance on this one.
But once Pooh bear got to Stanford he
was disillusioned, or, to be precise, he
wasn't happy.

When Pooh asked someone how to
make a perfect jar of honey, she asked
him what viscosity and thickness of
honey he planned to hold in it.
So he asked another person.
"What do you mean by 'perfect'?" the
stranger returned.
"You know, one that won't ever get
empty," Pooh replied, starting to get a lit
tle fed up by now.
"What do you mean by 'empty'?"
Pooh could see he was getting
nowhere. But he was determined.
So he stopped the next person and asked
him how to get to school. The new stranger
informed Pooh (with pride) that he was at
school, and not just any school, but Stanford.
"But I thought school was where all the
smart people went," Pooh replied. "If every
one is so smart around here, why doesn't
anybody know the answer to anything?"
"The answer to what?" the stranger
asked as he stared back at Pooh.
"That's exactly what I mean!" huffed
Pooh, and he quickly returned to his sim
ple world in the forest, where he lived
happily for who knows how long.
