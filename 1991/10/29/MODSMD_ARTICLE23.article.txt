## Willens, netters take on the best 
### Peter J. Blum Staff writer 
Even before Heather Willens
took the court Sunday in the
finals of the Riviera All-Ameri
can Tennis Tournament, the
Stanford women's tennis streak
had ended. For the first time
since 1987, the final was not
going to feature an "all-Stan
ford" duel.
Nonetheless, the eighth-seed
ed Willens was determined to join
the ranks of Tami Whitlinger and
Sandra Birch as champion, and
by the manner in which she had
dispatched her previous four
opponents, there was no reason
to think otherwise.
In the first round, she played
Susan Gilchrist of Texas, a long
and lanky serve and volleyer,
and won 7-5, 6-3.
Then she faced Susan So
merville, Duke's No. 2 player,
and, as Brennan said, "abso
lutely destroyed her," romping
to victory in a grand fashion, 6-
1, 6-2 in about 35 minutes.
Willens was thrust into the
quarterfinals pitting her
against California's Lisa
Albano, the nation's top-ranked
player.
"Lisa started to take over in
the second set, and I knew that
I needed to be more aggressive,"
Willens said.
Willens came out and began
to go for more winners. The
combination of her execution
and Albano's errors led to a 6-1
third- set thrashing.
"Lisa has the kind of game I
like, hard and flat, and she
didn't overpower me," Willens
said.
Willens was in the semifinals
for the second time in as many
years, and she followed up her
"biggest win" with a 6-2, 6-4
steamrolling of Tennessee's
Mandy Wilson to put her into
the finals.
But the tournament had
taken its toll on Willens, who
had played four singles and two
doubles matches in three, and
she fell in the finals to the high
est remaining seeded player,
Paloma Collantes of Mississip
pi, in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.
"I made this tournament my
goal, and although I fell one
match short, I have a good feel
ing about my performance,"
Willens said.
"Heather was about 75per
cent.... for the finals," Brennan
said. "Her feet were blistered
and she was sore. She would
have needed a bad match from
Collante to win, and Collante
had a great match."
"I didn't play a tournament
all summer, and the best way to
prepare for tournaments is to
play tournaments," Willens
said. "My body wasn't used to
that many matches, and it
didn't help playing doubles at
the same time."
Still wearied by her singles
final in the morning, Willens
teamed up Sunday afternoon

with partner Laxmi Poruri to
take on the second-seeded dou
bles team of Gilchrist and Vick
ie Paynter from Texas.
"In the beginning I tried to
help [Willensl out because I
knew she was tired, but she
picked up her energy level in
the second and third sets,"
Poruri said.
But Willens and Poruri lost a
break and found themselves at
the brink once again, this time
only a game away from elimina
tion, down 6-5. The two dug
deep and held serve, followed by
taking the tiebreaker 7-4.
After battling back to take
the second, the two continued
to roll, building a 4-2 lead in the
third and final set. But the
Texas team capitalized on some
costly Cardinal errors and took
over to win the last four games
en route to winning the final
Sunday night.
"We should've hammered
them in the last two games; we
were up 4-2 and we had it in our
hands," Poruri said. "We let it
slip away. If we had played a lit
tle more gutsy, we probably
would have won. We were just
not as intense as them in the
third set."
"I think that Laxmi and
Heather played terrifically,"
Brennan said. "I think that I've
found a doubles team with
these two." Last year Poruri
teamed with since-departed
Teri Whitlinger, and Willens
with Emma Woodhouse.
"Laxmi is playing much bet
ter than last year," Brennan
said.
Kristine Kurth, a sophomore
transfer from William and Mary
who made her debut in cardinal
and white, was ousted in the
second round by Cindy Gurney
of North Carolina, but not
before the Cardinal's seventh
seed still posted a convincing
third set win over Clemson's
Mindy Weiner, 6-7 (4-7), 6-1, 6-
1.
Although Kylie Johnson
found an early exit in the first
round, she sent a mighty shiver
down the back of fourth-seeded
Julie Exum of Duke before los
ing 7-6 (7-1), 5-7, 6-4.
"Kylie had a titanic match
with Julie," Brennan said. "For
our No. 6 player from last year
to lose 6-4 in the third to Exum
isn't too bad."
"It was a close match that
could've gone either way,"
Johnson said. "I was playing
more aggressively than she was,
but it came down to a couple of
mental and strategical errors."
For Johnson after winning
three qualifying matches and
taking Exum to three sets, her
performance gave her an added
boost of confidence after only
having practiced four days this
year due to back problems.
"I think that we did really
well in this tournament," Bren
nan said. "Almost all of the
players are Ail-Americans, so
no loss was a bad loss."
