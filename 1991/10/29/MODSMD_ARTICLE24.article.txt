# Polo reaches finals in 49er tourney
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Going into last weekend's 49er
Invitational Tournament in Long
Beach, the Stanford Water Polo
team knew it had to win at least
three out of four games to keep
the team's chances of making the
NCAA championships alive —
and after an inspired, all-around
team effort, the Cardinal has
returned to the north, as alive as
ever.
Despite falling in the champi
onship game late Sunday night to
defending national champion Cal
ifornia, No. 6 Stanford did exactly
what was needed, coming home
with impressive victories over the
two teams ranked No. 3 in the
nation, UC-Irvine and UCLA, by
respective scores of 11-6 and 8-7,
and a 10-4 win over No. 12 Air
Force in the opening game of the
tournament.
As freshman Wolf Wigo said,
"We pretty much accomplished
what we wanted to do. The whole
team's pretty excited and we
know it's all up to us now."
The team was playing so well
that the Cardinal almost even
pulled off a huge upset against
No. 1 California — who has lost
only one time all year — but it
was not to be as Cal prevailed by a
score of 14-11.
In fact, Stanford led 4-3 at
halftime and was only down by
one goal at the beginning of the
fourth and final period. But with
the Cardinal's top defensive play
er, senior Chris Smith, out of the
game after fouling out, the Gold
en Bear offense took over, scoring
four straight goals from the two
meter position to put the game
away. Stanford had held Cal's
United States Olympic Team
member Chris Humbert scoreless
in the first half, but Humbert
exploded in the second half and
wound up with five goals.
Despite the loss, coach Dante
Dettamanti was still encouraged
by his team's play. "We played
much better than the last time we
played them, and even when they
scored those four goals, we bat

tled right back. I think the guys
have finally figured out that they
can play and beat these teams."
Something else that must have
been encouraging to Detttamanti
was the play of junior Chip
Blankenhorn. A key member of
last year's team, Blankenhorn
had struggled so far this year, but
against Cal, he came through
with four goals to lead the team.
"Chip has finally decided that
he's gonna do something and is
not gonna to let us lose. He was
really struggling for the first
month and a half, and now he's
playing a lot more intensely and is
making the plays we need him to
make," Dettamanti said.

The most impressive victory of
the tournament — and likely of
the season — for the Cardinal was
the 11-6 win over Irvine. In an
earlier game at deGuerre Pool,
the Cardinal was destroyed by the
Anteaters, but this game was the
exact opposite as Stanford domi
nated throughout and cruised to
the victory. In fact, at halftime
the score was 8-2 in Stanford's
favor. Eight different players
scored for the Cardinal, with
Smith, Wigo, and JT Matarangas
leading the way with two goals
apiece.
"We've been waiting for this all
year long. Everything went well
for us, both offensively and defen

sively, and it was just a total team
effort," Dettamanti said.
Two weekends ago, Stanford
narrowly lost to UCLA by a score
of 8-7, but this time, the Cardinal
came out on top, beating its
Southern Californian foes by the
same exact score. The game was a
close affair for the entire match,
as one team would score and then
the other team would respond
with its own goal. With less than a
minute to play, Blankenhorn beat
UCLA's Ail-American goalkeeper
Dan Hackett with a lob shot to
give the Cardinal the dramatic
victory. Matarangas, Wigo, and
sophomore Antonio Busquets led
the Cardinal with two goals each.

"We accomplished what we wanted to do," said freshman Wolf Wigo. The triumphant No. 6-ranked
water polo team ousted No. 3 UC-lrvine and UCLA before falling in the finals to defending national
champion California.
