# The 						Daily — for students, by students
## 
### 
The really great thing about being a
journalist, or even a mere sports writ
er, is that it substantially improves
your sex life.
So if you're interested in becoming one,
here's a tip: make sure that your lead (a news
paper article's introduction) is titillating
enough to draw the reader into your story.
Preferably, you should do this while giving
some information about what is to follow.
This is an established rule of journalism,
whether you write forThe Stanford Daily or
The Wall Street Journal. And, besides, in a col
lege newspaper, where you are training your
self for professional journalism, it follows that
you should emulate the professionals as close
ly as possible.
Yet it seems that The Daily is constantly
wrestling with an identity crisis because of the
tension between its roles as a paper written
for students and as a paper written by stu
dents.
Here's an example of what I mean: A Cardi
nal team is faring poorly, and The Daily
reports the follies of the team, including some
analysis of the team's egregious performance.
The story takes an angle which seems to

almost dis that team.
The understandably upset coach harangues
the sports writer and complains, "This is sup
posed to be a student newspaper. We don't
need negative press."
Let me say, before you get any ideas, that
this example does not refer to any specific actu
al event. It never happened. But this kind of
thing has happened and does happen every now
and then. I would also add that this example is
rather oversimplified, but you get the idea.
Here is the dilemma: On the one hand, The
Daily is a community newspaper, and its
sports articles are biased toward the Cardinal,
just as, for example, The Chronicle is biased
toward the 49ers; on the other hand, The Daily

is a student newspaper, and as such, it is a
training ground for young journalists who
must learn, among other things, to write
objectively.
That's what I mean about The Daily's twin
roles.
But this polemic is not limited solely to the
sports department, either. For example, I
heard a lot of people complaining about The
Daily's decision to publish Stuart Thomas's
name and photograph in connection with the
alleged sexual assault incident.
Wouldn't a professional newspaper have
done that? Don't we see people arrested for
crimes on television news all the time — before
the suspect's trial has even been set?
When I mentioned these things to friends in
response to their complaints, many replied,
"Yeah, but The Daily is a student newspaper."
And yet, these same people complain about
The Daily's shortcomings as an accurate,
objective source of news.
But then, that is a small price to pay for the
fulfilling lifestyle of the journalist.
