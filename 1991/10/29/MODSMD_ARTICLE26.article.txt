# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Some athletes occasionally have incredi
bly spectacular performances that put them
in the history books. Others, the often
unsung heroes, demonstrate excellence day
in and day out, season after season, game
after game. Sarah Rafanelli and Alex
O'Brien are two such athletes.
Last year, as a freshman, Rafanelli was
the leading scorer for the women's soccer
team. This year, she also leads the team with

15 goals and seven assists. Almost a third of
the Cardinal's total goals this season have
been made by Rafanelli.
Throughout the team's minor slump a
few weeks ago Rafanelli was often the sole
scorer. She has tallied points in 12 of their 15
games.
In last weekend's sound thrashing of
Southern Methodist, she added two goals in
less than two-and-a-half minutes.

While Rafanelli has led her team to victo
ry for two seasons, O'Brien has been win
ning big points for four. His final season
with the Cardinal tennis team started with a
bang last weekend when he won the Volvo
Tennis Collegiate Championships, a national
preseason event, to effectively become the
No. 1-ranked player in the country.
This was especially impressive because he
has only been practicing for a few weeks, and
he's had heavy conditioning workouts as
well.
"His legs were tired," said coach Dick
Gould. "He competed well, though. What he
did with what he had to work with was out
standing."
HLs final match against Dave DiLucia of
Notre Dame was a nail-biter that ended 7-6, 7-6.
Being the top seed may have put added
pressure on O'Brien. "Winning is not easy to
do when you're the No. 1 seed," Gould said.
But O'Brien is not new to high-pressure
national tournaments. Beginning his fresh
man year, he has started for the Cardinal,
competing in — and winning — dozens of

crucial matches, including many at the
NCAA Championships.
"Alex has worked and worked and gotten
better and better," Gould said. "He's really
earned the respect he's finally getting. He's
always had to prove himself."
"He's gaining confidence in himself, and
his game in general has gone up several
steps. Day in and day out, there's no ques
tion I think he's the top guy in the nation."
