As colder weather sets in,
thoughts of sailing float out of
most people's imagination. How
ever, this weekend, Stanford
sailed through light fall winds
and lumpy seas en route to a third
place finish in the Pacific Coast
Sloop Championships near New
port Beach.
The regatta was hosted by UC-
Irvine and Orange Coast College,
who placed first and second,
respectively.
Sophomore skipper Scott Sell
ers and his crew, senior Paul
Brotherton and junior co-captain
Rusty Lhamon, adapted to unfa
miliar boats cal'ed Shields for the
competition, which are much
longer and heavier than the small
dinghies Stanford is used to sail
ing. Stanford finished with 19
points, just six behind Irvine.
Coach Blake Middleton, in his
sixth season, described Stan
ford's performance as both frus
trating and encouraging. In the
first three races, Stanford held
key positions at the first mark,
but finished in the middle of the
pack. Middleton attributed this to
"tactical control errors." These
errors had a deciding impact on
the outcome, as evidenced by the
narrow margin between first and

third place.
"We made some mistakes, but
we came out of it knowing we
have a good shot in the future.
We proved we were capable of
winning," Middleton said.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
sailors captured first, second and
fifth place finishes at the Frosh-
Soph Regatta, also hosted by
Irvine and Orange Coast College.
Freshman skipper Charles
Meade, along with his crew —
sophomore Katherine Chen —
breezed to a first place fmish, fol
lowed by sophomores Jeremy
Mclntyre (skipper) and Justin
Pollard (crew) in second and
freshmen Rolf Kaiser (skipper)
and Polly Brown (crew) in fifth.
The abundance of success
among underclassmen foreshad
ows the future of Stanford sail
ing. "We've got a young team,
which is a very good sign for the
future; it's clearly the deepest
team on the West Coast," Middle
ton said.
Two sailors, Matt Sanford and
Meade, head to Newport Harbor
on Saturday for the Pacific Coast
Singlehanded Eliminations and
Championship. Meade claimed
first in his division last weekend
at the Navy Fall Invitational,
marking the first time Stanford
has won a national title.
