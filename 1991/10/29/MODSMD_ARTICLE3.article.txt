## Scholar exposes Chinese prisons 
### Gus Heldt 
If a picture is worth a thousand words, Hongda
Wu has a lot to say about Chinese prisons.
From the opening slide of a "shrimp farm" com
plete with barbed wire and guard towers, Wu
showed how the Chinese government is violating
both U.S. import laws and human rights in a talk
yesterday at the Hoover Institution.
Wu, a Hoover visiting scholar who had himself been
in a prison labor camp for 19 years, recently returned
to China posing as a Chinese-American businessman,
along with a investigative team from "60 Minutes," to
uncover the widespread use of prison labor for the
manufacture of U.S.-bound goods.
The result was a chilling picture of the kind of
doublespeak that permeates China's trade relations
with the rest of the world.
Wu said there are 12 to 16 million prison inmates
in China, the majority of whom are in "labor re-edu
cation camps." Many of the inmates are political
prisoners.
Despite assurances to the U.S. government that
labor-camp products sire not made for export, one of
Wu's slides showed an official government export
license proudly displayed on the wall of one prison
office.
