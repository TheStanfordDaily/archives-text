## 'All texts have an agenda' Class studies Bible to learn about role of women in ancient times 
### Mara Mather Editorial staff 
Students in the class "Women in the Ancient
World" have to practice literary archaeology to learn
about women in biblical times.
That is because almost all the texts from that
period about women were written by men. Students
must search these texts to find nuggets of truths
about women's lives.
Women in the Bible, the central text of the
course, are either "bad" or "good," according to Reli
gious Studies Asst. Prof. Alice Bach, who teaches the
class. "There aren't any pictures of women who suc
ceed without men — except Judith, who is a widow
with no sex life," she added. "Those models are still
with us today."
According to Bach, "I assume all texts have an
agenda. [The Bible] is a patriarchal book."
Bach points out in the class that much of what is
thought to be in the Bible is not really in the text.
For example, she said, God does not curse women in
Genesis, but rather the earth and the serpent.
She added that everyone should have the oppor
tunity to examine closely the premises of the Bible.
"God has survived far worse than [the] rereading
[of] texts," she said, noting that despite the fact that
ministers are aware of the contradictions in the Bible,
they remain faithful. Therefore, she said, they should

understand that the general population can also
examine the text critically without losing their faith.
Bach does not, like some feminists, refer to God
as gender-neutral, "[the bible's authors] did, I'm
quite sure, think of God as male," she said.
Diana Akiyama, as associate dean of Memorial
Church and an ordained Protestant minister, strug
gles against the stereotypes Bach examines. Akiya
ma said that "the traditional theology that is taught
is very sexist," adding that it is a "great burden on
me for redefining and re-creating."
She said she feels that as a woman in the church
she can help reach out to other women. "There are a
large number of women not in the church who have a
very strong and deep hunger for faith in their lives,"
Akiyama said. "Many women who come in touch with
a woman theologian see the church no longer as a
place where they are abused and held down."
Akiyama added, "Ironically, I think (having)
women in the priesthood has made people struggle
with the humanity of the priest."
Currently, the students in "Women in the
Ancient World" are all female. "I don't want to just
preach to the converted," Bach said. "I hope to
rephrase my course so that men will take it. I want a
dialogue with the class."
However, Bach said, "I think that a community of
women is important. We make each other feel
strong."
