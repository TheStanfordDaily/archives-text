# New group explores women's spirituality
## 
### Mara Mather Editorial staff 
Senior Betsy Osgood hopes
the new discussion group she
has organized will help women
students understand a facet of
their lives that they often over
look in the daily hustle and
bustle â€” spirituality.
"For me, spirituality is an
awareness of energy or life
force," she said. "I don't think
I'm religious at all, but I'm very
spiritual."
The group, organized by
Osgood and Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiya
ma, had its first meeting last
Tuesday.
"My ideal is to make Stan
ford a more holistic place,"
Osgood said. "I've been frus
trated sometimes at Stanford
because I feel it's such a cere
bral place."
During last week's discus
sion, one of the main topics was
how. sexuality and spirituality
seem diametrically opposed to
one another in many religions
and how it might be possible to
reconcile those differences on a
personal level.
"In an hour, you can only
scratch the surface of a ques
tion like that," Osgood said.
The group is "a safe place to
talk about . .. things that you
can't (talk about) in classes or

in a mixed group of men and
women," she added.
Seven women attended the
discussion last week. "All the
women mentioned needing a
space to talk about these
issues," Osgood said.
Starting this discussion
group "was an idea that I had
for a while," she said, noting it
was a combination of Akiya
ma's initiative and hers that
got the group going.
"Diana really likes to focus
on feelings and stories, rather
than intellectualize the
issues," Osgood said.
Akiyama said there is not
generally a good understand
ing of what it means to be a
person of faith. For her it
means "a relationship with
God that is demanding and
compassionate at the same
time.
"It requires that I be in con
stant dialogue with what a per
son of faith should be," she
said. "Being a minister is
another layer on top of that."
She added, "There still are
people who have a hard time
seeing why women would want
to be a minister. It's been hard,
but probably not as hard (for
me) as for the women who
came before me."
The group meets in the
Women's Center every Tues
day.
