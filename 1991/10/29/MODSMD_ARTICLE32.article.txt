# 'Losing yourself in God and to God' Black Church provides outlet for students' faith
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Every Sunday evening, Elliot Program
Center fills with students shouting, dancing
and singing.
They're not having a house party —
they're exalting God in the African-Ameri
can tradition of worship in the Black Church
at Stanford, a non-denominational service
open to anyone.
Two years ago, Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Floyd Thompkins took part in long
meetings to discuss the spiritual needs of
black students.
Thompkins said there was a concern that
these students were feeling alienated in pre
dominantly white churches. He said he did
not believe this was due to the intentions of
white churchgoers; rather, differences in
"how one knows God and how one imagines
God interacting [and the] way God is per
ceived" may have led to these feelings.
"God is imagined and understood not only
as a personal reality but as a community
reality," Thompkins said. "If one is feeling
uncomfortable or disconnected from the
community, one finds oneself stopped some
how at the level of even connecting to God."

As a response, the Black Church was cre
ated to provide the kind of community and
worship style these students were missing.
The church is student-operated, and the reg
ular preachers are students, said Thomp
kins, who has no official role but acts as a
mentor.
Guest speakers and gospel choirs appear
every month, yet these events are not adver
tised because the church does not rely on
them to increase membership, Thompkins
said. "Numbers are not important. This is
about worship," he added.
In spite of the church's name, race is also
unimportant. "Black" stands for the African-
American roots of the worship, Thompkins
said. The focus is on the Holy Spirit with a
stronger emphasis on the importance of Jesus
than God, Thompkins added, noting that pre
dominantly white churches tend to focus on
God and are much more uncomfortable with
the Spirit.
Out of the focus on the Spirit comes a
sense of "losing yourself in God and to
God," Thompkins said. Adoration and
praise are shown via song, silence and
"dance. This is quite different rroin wmte
churches, which tend to focus on Bible study
as a method of hearing God, he said.
According to Thompkins, many people

from the Evangelical Christian community
and the Charismatic community are com
fortable with the worship style of the
Black Church, as well as black churches in
general. A number of non-black students
who are from these traditions frequent the
church, he said.
Thompkins sees this tradition as having
something special to offer to all people. He
said too many people at Stanford believe
multiculturalism can only be established
when there is no strong identity.
"The danger is having something called
'Black' Church and then being so accommodat
ing to every other condition that you lose the
essence of it,"he said.
"You cannot gather a community around
the ideal of multiculturalism alone. It is not
an ethic." Supporting the ideal for the
ideal's sake is not enough of a motivating
force, he said.
However, the fact remains that there are
all-black churches and there are all-white
churches regardless of the Christian ethic of
brotherhood. To this, Thompkins answers
Vnai, Liie Cnrisuan~community in the United
States today is, unfortunately, "an authen
tic expression of the segregation in Ameri
can society."
