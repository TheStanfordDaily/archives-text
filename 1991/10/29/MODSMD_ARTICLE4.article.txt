## Thompkins strives for religious openness

Floyd Thompkins wants students
to come out of their religious closets.
"By the time seniors come to me,
they have talked to their friends
about everything but religion, for
fear of bad reactions or being
labeled," said Thompkins, who is an
associate dean of Memorial Church.
"One of the things people can get
hurt about is religious sensibilities.
They closet themselves in a way that
isn't healthy and educated."
Thompkins has been encouraging
Stanford students to express their spir
ituality since he arrived here in 1988.
He earned his degrees from Bethany
College and Princeton Theological
Seminary. Thompkins said he wanted
to be a minister because "I believe
unabashedly in Jesus Christ. I eryoy
seeing people have the same experience
I do of being forgiven and loved."
However, Thompkins said that
part of his job at Stanford is to be
"Christian on the weekend and inter
faith all week." His many roles
encompass leading Memorial Church
worship — which includes perform-

Thompkins exercises his primary
responsibility, graduate student reli
gious life, in a variety of ways, including
meeting with all the graduate student
groups and working with the chaplain
cies that serve graduate students.
One of the special aspects of reli
gious life at Stanford is the sensitivi
ty to language and faith diversity,
which requires mediation between
religious groups and the administra
tion, Thompkins said. This accom
modation of diverse needs includes
involvement with both the victim and

the accused in sexual assault cases,
supporting both sides and working
toward redemption for the accused.
Thompkins' responsibilities
extend to the staff as well. He sees
"people in transition times with their
jobs, battered wives [and] staff who
have problems" discussing their diffi
culties with others in the University.
The purpose of all these activities
is to "affirm to the community that
Stanford takes religious life .. . seri
ously" and supports its growth, he
said. "You would be handicapped if
you left Stanford and didn't under
stand the basic ways religion
informs, especially with friends."
Thompkins said the main benefit
of his job has been interacting with
students. He describes them as "the
most amazing people in our society,"
because of their "changing growth."
"Cynicism develops in early child
hood or college, and if optimism lives,
it is nurtured here," he said.
Thompkins tries to be a model of
this optimism. His inspirational,
buoyant oratorical style — which is
