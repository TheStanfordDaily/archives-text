# Campus cottage succumbs to fire
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Fire struck again on the Stanford campus early
yesterday morning, this time almost completely
destroying a single-bedroom cottage behind the main
lot at 649 Alvarado Row. The blaze started near a
water heater.
No one was hurt, and firefighters prevented the
fire from spreading to the main house and other
homes in the neighborhood.
Capt. Bruce Hallburg and his crew responded
from Station 6 of the Palo Alto Fire Department.
After the fire that consumed the old Delta Tau Delta
house Oct. 11 and the Oakland blaze last week, this
marks the third time in a little more than two weeks
that the fire department has been called upon.
Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur, who owns the cot
tage where his sister-in-law was living, said the
remains of the house would need to be "totally torn
down and rebuilt."
According to Stanford Fire Marshal Ray Gamma,
Nur's sister-in-law, who wished to remain anony
mous, was in the shower at the time the fire began.
Gamma said that she noticed smoke above the water
heater while she was drying her hair and called the
fire department at 6:25 a.m.
Nur said that when he noticed the blaze, he ran
down and turned off the gas and power, while his
wife called the fire department
as well.
"Then I turned on the hose
and sprayed as much water as I
could on the main house," Nur
said. "By then, the fire depart
ment came and they did what
they could."
The firefighters did "an excel
lent job of getting lines in and con

taining the fire," Gamma said. "It
was a very fast response."
After investigating today,
Mark Pittinger of the Palo Alto
Fire Department and Gamma
concluded that combustibles
stored too close to the flue of the
water heater caused the fire.
Gamma said that although
the main Stanford campus was
at no risk, the buildings imme
diately adjacent to the cottage
"would have caught" if not for
the quick response of the fire
department.
