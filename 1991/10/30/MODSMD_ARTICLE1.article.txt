# Disabled housing options limited
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Shelby Morgan 
Editor's note: This is the second
of two articles examining the
issue of disability access to Uni
versity buildings.
To enter the lounge of El Centro
Chicano, most people can walk in
the front door. But a wheelchair
bound student must roll down a
steep loading ramp next to the
garbage cans behind the center.
Such an entrance seems the
rule, not the exception, in dorms
and campus community centers.
Although the University has
made attempts to turn this
around, administrators say bud
get constraints have slowed the
process considerably.
Housing limitations
The Draw, for instance, does
not present disabled students with
the same array of choices as their
classmates. Two Row houses, one
of the Suites, Escondido Village
and a few dormitories each con
tain two or three wheelchair
accessible rooms. No ethnic theme
dorms are wheelchair-accessible.
"Right now, I'd rather have
more possible places to live,
because there are not very many
options for me," said Adrianna
Duffy, a senior who is wheelchair
bound.
The University has attempted
to meet the needs of disabled stu
dents by assigning them housing
prior to the Draw. A disabled stu
dent can apply for a special
assignment along with a room
mate of his or her choice, accord
ing to Undergraduate Housing
Supervisor Barb Kline-Schoder.
But because the number of
accessible rooms is limited, dis
abled students end up "compet
ing against each other for . . .
spaces," according to Molly Sand
perl, director of the Disability
Resource Center.
According to Anne Porteus,
assistant director of Residential
Education, "Options are limited,
which is part of the University's
trouble."
"Solutions are going to be
gradual," she added.
Funding, solutions limited
One possible solution would be
to retrofit older buildings to make
them accessible. But according to
Dean of Students Michael Jackson,
financial constraints prevent the
University from building ramps
and elevators in old buildings.
Newly opened Kimball Hall
features first-floor accessibility,
but lacks an elevator to carry dis
abled students to the upper floors.
Cultural centers and theme
houses face similar shortcomings.
According to Frances Morales,
director of El Centro Chicano, the
University has not provided cru
cial funding. "If the University

would help out and make cultural
centers accessible, it would be a
benefit to everyone," she said.
Keith Archuleta, director of the
Black Community Services Cen
ter, said funding is a mtyor con
cern. "The University has not had
the money to make cultural cen
ters accessible," he said. "Now,
with the budget cuts, I am scared
the funds will never be available,"
he added.
Freshman Eric Horn, who is
disabled, said the lack of access to
cultural centers presents a barri
er to multicultural learning.
"It is pretty sad that the cultur
al centers aren't open and avail
able to all people, because it seems
to go against the very principle the
centers were set by," he said. "It
does not allow a certain group to
come in and be educated."
But the current budget crunch
makes increased accessibility
even more unlikely.
Jackson said, "Unfortunately,
there is no money to make (the
buildings) more accessible."
According to Porteus, accessi
bility "is not going to happen
overnight. It is a slow process."
