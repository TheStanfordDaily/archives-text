# Disabled housing options limited
##

Editor's note: This is the second
of two articles examining the
issue of disability access to Uni
versity buildings.
To enter the lounge of El Centro
Chicano, most people can walk in
the front door. But a wheelchair
bound student must roll down a
steep loading ramp next to the
garbage cans behind the center.
Such an entrance seems the
rule, not the exception, in dorms
and campus community centers.
Although the University has
made attempts to turn this
around, administrators say bud
get constraints have slowed the
process considerably.
Housing limitations
The Draw, for instance, does
not present disabled students with
the same array of choices as their
classmates. Two Row houses, one
of the Suites, Escondido Village
and a few dormitories each con
tain two or three wheelchair
accessible rooms. No ethnic theme
dorms are wheelchair-accessible.
"Right now, I'd rather have
more possible places to live,
because there are not very many
options for me," said Adrianna
Duffy, a senior who is wheelchair
bound.
The University has attempted
to meet the needs of disabled stu
dents by assigning them housing
prior to the Draw. A disabled stu
dent can apply for a special
assignment along with a room
mate of his or her choice, accord
ing to Undergraduate Housing
Supervisor Barb Kline-Schoder.
But because the number of
accessible rooms is limited, dis
abled students end up "compet
ing against each other for . . .
spaces," according to Molly Sand
perl, director of the Disability
