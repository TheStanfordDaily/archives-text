# Bloodshed tempers optimism for peace

MADRID, Spain (AP) â€”
Arabs and Israelis alike voiced
hopes yesterday for forging a
lasting accord, but new blood
shed stained the eve of historic
Middle East talks.
A bombing by the fundamen
talist group Hezbollah killed
three Israeli soldiers in south
ern Lebanon, and Israel
responded hours later by bomb
ing what it said was a Hezbollah
base in Nabatiyeh, eight miles
north of the Israeli border.
In Beirut, a rocket hit the
wall of the U.S. Embassy com
pound. There were no immedi
ate reports of injuries or serious
damage, but the incident was a
chilling reminder of the disas
trous truck-bomb attacks on the
embassy in 1983 and 1984 that
left 74 people dead, including 21
Americans, and 196 wounded.
Radical Shiite Muslim and
Palestinian groups have pro
mised to attack the United
States and others involved in
the Madrid peace conference
opening today, which they
oppose because it could lead to
Aj-ab recognition for Israel.
Underscoring fears that the

conference could be derailed,
Palestine Liberation Organ
ization chief Yasser Arafat
warned that "extremist" Arab
groups could threaten the gath
ering's chances for success.
But Arafat, in an interview
broadcast on German televi
sion, expressed broad support
for the Palestinian delegation
to the talks, and optimism
about the outcome of the talks.
The PLO was not formally
represented in Madrid because
Israel regards the PLO as a ter
rorist organization and refuses
to deal with it.
In statements in Madrid on
the eve of the talks, Palestin
ians struck a conciliatory
stance. Faisal Husseini, leader
of a group of advisers accompa
nying the Palestinian delega
tion, endorsed negotiations for
autonomy within the occupied
territories, as Israel has
demanded, rather than immedi
ate statehood.
In the occupied lands, there
were signs that some Palest
inians are worn down by the 4-
year-old uprising against Israeli
rule and would welcome peace.
