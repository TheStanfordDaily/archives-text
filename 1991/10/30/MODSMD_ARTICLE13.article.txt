## The
						quota quotient 
### 
Civil Rights Act tainted
by Bush's preying
on racial tensions

PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush
finally capitulated and
announced last week he
would sign the proposed Civil
Rights Act of 1991 in its current
form, abandoning his claim that
the legislation is a "quota bill."
Plaintiffs in employment-dis
crimination cases will soon go to
court better equipped to obtain
relief â€” in spite of Bush's detestable
manipulation of racial politics
throughout the legislative process.
When made into law, the Act will
make it easier for employees to
prove discrimination on the part of
their employers, increase the
amount of compensation available
to victims in those cases and estab
lish a new provision for victims of
sexual harassment to receive dam
ages.
Several 1989 Supreme Court
cases will be overturned, redeploy
ing weapons in the fight against
employers who discriminate on the
basis of race, a fight that had lost
much of its ammunition to the rul
ings of the Rehnquist court.
One of the cases the Act will
expunge, thankfully, is Antonio v.
Wards Cove. Discarding an 18-
year-old precedent, the Wards
Cove decision placed the burden of
proof exclusively on the employee
in discrimination cases brought
against an employer. According to
Wards Cove, an employee must
single out the hiring or promoting
practice that is discriminatory and
then either prove it is not related
to successful job performance or
devise a less discriminatory prac
tice the employer could use in its
place without greater expense.
In overturning Wards Cove, the
Act resurrects the former stan
dard, requiring the employer to
prove business necessity as soon as
the employee demonstrates the

hiring or promoting practices have
a discriminatory result.
The Act will set caps on the puni
tive damages that can be awarded
in both discrimination and harass
ment cases. Significantly, though,
Bush conceded in this area as he did
in several others, eventually agree
ing to caps suggested by Sen. John
Danforth. While lower than the
caps argued for by some congres
sional Democrats, they are substan
tially higher than those Bush ini
tially hoped for.
Indeed, Bush ended up giving in
on almost every point of contention
between him and Danforth when
Senate leaders finally reached an
agreement with the White House
last week. That Bush had the audac
ity to claim the legislation had been
sufficiently amended to his liking is
just another example of the abhor
rent manner in which Bush has
treated the bill.
Even on the heels of the Willie
Horton disgrace that plagued the
1988 election, Bush was in a
unique position to lead a national
push for civil rights. Had he cho
sen to do so, he could have been
the first president since Lyndon
Johnson in 1964 to address the
nation on television in support of
civil rights legislation.
Moreover, Bush could have
given such an address last summer
when both houses of Congress
passed the Civil Rights Act of
1990, which he instead vetoed,
branding it a "quota bill." But if
the 1990 Act and the current Act
as it existed this May were quota
bills, as Bush claimed, the current
version is still a quota bill.
Why didn't he just sign it in the
first place? By choosing instead to
cry "quota" Bush only exacerbated
the racial strife that of late has
threatened to impale so many
cities on a dagger of upheaval.
Bush's concession comes better
late than never. But the means he
chose to employ en route to that
end smack of a disregard for the
number and severity of discrimi
natory ills that still remain to be
remedied.
