New math curriculum offers much-needed change

The new way of teaching
calculus at Stanford, using the
Harvard Calculus Consortium
(HCC) curriculum, is definitely one of
the best things the math department
could have done to strengthen its under
graduate program.
All too often, Stanford students com
plain about the lack of a good math
course and instructor. But students, like
the ones quoted in the Oct. 16 Daily
("Not the same old calculus"), shouldn't
be whining anymore.
Prof. Brad Osgood is one of the best
teachers of undergraduate math on cam
pus. He strives to make the innovative
Math 41 course exciting and interesting.
He places concepts in proper perspective
and expresses them very clearly. He is not

trying to weed anyone out of the class or
deliberately make someone miserable.
What allows Osgood to take an inno
vative approach to calculus is the HCC
curriculum. It is like no other teaching
system. That's what makes it so good.
Probably in high school, or even calculus
courses pre-1990 at Stanford, most peo
ple learned from a calculus book that
was cumbersome to read, difficult to
understand and good only for problems
at the end of the chapter.
We don't learn calculus by doing this.
We learn merely how to plug and chug,
looking at examples and substituting
numbers. Somewhere along the way, like
the bright students we are, we see the pat
terns and think about the rules and then
decide we knew our calculus. Sure, we all

know our basic fundamentals, but we
don't have the full grasp of theories, ready
to apply them in higher mathematics.
Osgood, using the HCC curriculum,
seeks to change this. The text for the
course is well written, logical and easy to
understand. Students start out by learn
ing functions over again. Most won't see a
shred of "high-school calculus" until this
week. This is a good thing. Before we
learn calculus, we have to learn the basics.
Seeing how mathematics is involved
in everyday situations, we can finally
understand and appreciate it. We are
given a firm footing in the theory and
applications of math so that when we
encounter mathematics later, be it in
physics, economics or biology, we have a
better grasp what is going on.

Another big part of the course is the
use of the graphing calculator. Rote,
mindless memorization of graph shapes
is replaced by a flexible tool that we can
use to examine, analyze and adapt to dif
ferent situations. It allows us to see
math in action — the realistic applica
tion of the theory.
Math is not plugging and chugging,
memorizing formulas or drawing neatly
shaped integral squiggles on a piece of
paper. To everyone in Math 41 who
thinks that "this isn't math": This is
math. Just give the new way a fair
chance. Get the fundamental concepts
down, stick with the course and know
that you are finally learning math.
