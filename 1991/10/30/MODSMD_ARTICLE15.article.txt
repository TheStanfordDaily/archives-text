# New University policy unfair to couples unable to marry
## 
### 
Regarding the University's decision to
increase its contribution to two-party
and family-health insurance premiums
for married (i.e. heterosexual) employees
and to offset that increase by decreasing
the amount it contributes for single cov
erage:
• It is not clear to me why single
employees should be asked to help
defray health costs for employees who
have chosen to have families; and
• Will someone explain to me, a gay
employee involved in a long-term com
mitted relationship (I am not single!),
why I should help defray health costs for
someone else's family when the Univer
sity makes no provision for my own!?
Have health costs increased less for les
bian and gay employees and their fami
lies?
At a time when the University should

be providing benefits parity, it has
instead widened the disparity between
benefits provided to its heterosexual
employees with families and those pro
vided to its lesbian and gay employees
with families.
Finally, does the University really
value its heterosexual employees with
families more than it values its single
employees and its lesbian and gay
employees with families? I hope not, but
it seems so.
