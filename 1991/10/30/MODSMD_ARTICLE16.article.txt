# Gandhi animal rights quotation came from a reputable source
## 
### 
Just for the record, Mahatma Gandhi
was a champion of not only human
rights, but also animal rights. He was a
longtime ethical vegetarian and anti
vivisection ist. The allegation in a recent

letter by Anand Adiga and Subir Hira
(The Daily, Oct. 28) that my quotation
of Gandhi was "profoundly absurd" is
unsubstantiated.
I obtained the quote from several
sources, including "The Extended Circle: A
Dictionaiy of Humane Quotations," from
literature produced by the Animal Pro
tection Institute of America (whom I
contacted for confirmation) and from a
brochure produced by In Defense of Ani
mals.
Each of these sources lists the
original source as The Moral Basis
of Vegetarianism, an original
compilation of works by Gandhi. My
research and investigations support
the validity of the content of this quo
tation.
It is this type of flagrant behavior
that makes the animal-rights movement
seem flaky and irrational. The important
point is not whether Gandhi was a life
long vegetarian, but rather the (ab)use
of animals in today's society. Adiga and
Hira effectively drew the attention away
from animal rights and focused it on my
credibility.

May I make a suggestion? Next time
you destroy someone's credibility and
discount the issues, have sources to back
you up.
The issue remains: Animals are suf
fering, and we must act!
