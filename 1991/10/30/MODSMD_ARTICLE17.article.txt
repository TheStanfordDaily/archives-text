## 
### 
I applaud Coulter Richardson's let
ter to The Daily (Oct. 28) on redundant
toilet flushing. It really bowled me
over. I would like to embellish this
theme and suggest the following: Why
flush at all? This extravagance is clear
ly a drain on our society. Once per day
(or until the urinal overflows) is cer
tainly sufficient.
