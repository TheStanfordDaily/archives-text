## My lord, myself 
### 
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THIS
country seven years ago, I had a
Christian roommate. One day he
invited me to have dinner at his friend's
house. Being an 18-year-old newcomer,
lonely in a strange land, I naturally agreed.
The place was just a few blocks away.
The walls of the house were decorated with
frames of Bible quotations. The furniture
included a sofa, a coffee table and a few
chairs. In the corner, there was a big stack
of brochures, looking rather conspicuous.
There were about 10 people there. After
I was introduced to the host and hostess,
we all sat around a long dinner table. Then
they started to pray. That was the first
time I had ever witnessed anyone jpray.
I felt rather awkward. There was a
strange sense of quietude in the air as if the
entire universe had come to a stop and was
listening to one man saying words of
thanks. I didn't know what to do. I just kept
my mouth shut and my eyes on my nose.
After dinner, they gathered in the liv
ing room. Some sat on the sofa and some
on the carpet. Then they started to sing.
I was especially impressed by the
woman who played the guitar and led the
songs. She was wearing a brown sweater
and a white blouse with the top button fas
tened. She also had a long skirt «(vhich
hung all the way to her ankles. Her home
ly attire, however, could not cover up her
crystal bright eyes and her rosy cheeks
which lit up the room like a golden sunset.

As she played, her long brown hair
waved from side to side on her shoulders.
It was truly moving to watch the display of
such energy, joy and trust.
I became quite interested in those peo
ple. I started to attend their functions reg
ularly. Despite my non-participation, they
treated me just like one of their own.
Once, we went to what appeared to be a
regional gathering at their church. It real
ly wasn't much of a church. It had no podi
um, no pews, nor any stained glass.
Indeed, it could have been any auditorium.
There must have been 1,000 people there
that day. From the corner where I was sit
ting, I could barely see a piano and a man in
the middle of circles and circles of people.
Once again, they started with songs. It
was the most awesome showing of group
spirit I have ever seen. Some were shaking
their heads, and some closed their eyes,
pumping their fists. The volume of the
sound and level of their fervor must have
exceeded that of the red guards gathering
in Tiananmen Square, waiting to be
inspected by Chairman Mao.
I sat in my chair, trying to fold myself
into as small and invisible a position as
possible. I was overwhelmed. I thought in
any minute my body could be shattered by
the power of the sound.
Then came the sermon which had
something to do with harvest. As the ser
mon ended, individual members stood up
one after another, testifying their experi

ence as believers. Finally, it was time for
the newcomers to initiate themselves. Sev
eral people stood up. They unanimously
recalled the pain of their search and the
joy of their discovery.
The person who drove me there whis
pered into my ear, "Are you going to
stand?" "No," I replied. "Why not?" he
asked. I smiled at him awkwardly. "Have
you thought about things like why you are
here? Where are you going?" he contin
ued. I smiled again, keeping my sight firm
ly on my nose. "You are just a boy," he
gently patted my shoulder, "but you will
come around."
What could I have said? I was just an
18-year-old boy among 1,000 believers.
But there are times when I wish that I
were one of them; how convenient that
would be. I could finally attach a pre
ordained meaning to life.
I, too, am a weak person in need of
other people, but I must follow my own
calling. I dare not worship, nor to be wor
shipped. I expect nothing less than equali
ty. No matter how I gyrate in life's infer
no, I must be my own lord.
