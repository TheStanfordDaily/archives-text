Q. Do vampire bats really suck
• blood?
A .Vampire bats are sanguiv
• ores. They feed on the blood
of other animals and are not blood
suckers, but blood lappers. The
vampire bat inflicts a small V
shaped wound with its razor
sharp teeth. It then laps blood
from the wound using a specially
modified tongue.
Vampires bite in regions that
are rich in tiny blood vessels such
as fingers, toes, noses, ears and
the neck. Bat saliva contains anti
coagulants that keep the blood
flowing by preventing clotting
(scab formation). In 20 minutes a
vampire drains about two table
spoons of blood from its victim.
While a vampire bat cannot
turn you into a vampire, its bite
may have unpleasant complica
tions. In tropical areas of the New
World, vampire bats are an impor
tant agent in the spread of rabies.
Another danger from a vam
pire bite is prolonged bleeding.
The anticoagulant continues to
work long after the bat has ceased
feeding. Vampires bite a sleeping
victim carefully so as not to wake
the victim. Heavy sleepers,
beware!
Much lore is associated with
bats. Some people worry bats will
fly into their hair. Once upon a
time, people thought this caused
baldness. Most bats are insecti
vores, or insect eaters, and what
bat could resist the tempting vit
tles that lived in our predecessors'
hair? Maintain your excellent

hygiene, though, and you have lit
tle to fear.
Long ago, people thought bat
guano and vinegar cured tumors
and that burned bats and wine
promoted milk flow in nursing
mothers. Be thankful you didn't
live in the Dark Ages. I bet drink
ing bat feces or eating cremated
bats would make you forget the
vermin crawling in your hair.
Yuck!!
Nevertheless, sanguivores may
benefit humankind in the long
run. The anticoagulants in bat
saliva show some promise in the
treatment of heart attacks and
strokes.
Q,Are there any drugs that
• can turn one into a zombie?
A. I guess it depends on your
• definition of "zombie." I'll
assume you mean zombie in the
Haitian sense, not in the Ameri
can sense meaning oblivious,
zonked, narcotized, stupefied,
vegetative or the mixed drink.
In Haitian folklore, zombies
are the living dead. A man named
Clairvius Narcisse is the most

infamous Haitian Zombie. Nar
cisse's sister was present when he
died in 1962. Eighteen years later,
the sister claims to have met her
long-dead brother.
Narcisse claims that after his
burial, he was resurrected from
the grave and made a zombie by a
zombie-maker, or bokor. Narcisse
wandered around Haiti for 16
years until his second death.
Enter Wade Davis, an ethnob
otany (the study of plants used by
other cultures) student from Har
vard. Davis went down to Haiti to
see if he could obtain some zombie
powder. Zombie powder, prepared
by bokors, is used to make zom
bies. Each powder has an antidote.
Davis thought maybe the powder
contained chemicals that would be
useful to anesthesiologists.
Zombie powder contains every
thing but the kitchen sink, includ
ing spices, clay and pulverized
human remains. After analyzing
the potion, Davis claimed a com
pound in the powder, tetrodotox
in, was the magic stuff.
Tetrodotoxin is a poison found in
high concentrations in the
innards of pufferfish. These fish,
less the innards, are a delicacy in
Japan. However, this morsel is
not without risk — about 100
Japanese people per year die from
pufferfish poisoning.
Enter C. Kao, world authority
on tetrodotoxin. Kao doesn't buy
Davis' theory. Kao's lab analyzed
some of the samples and found
levels of tetrodotoxin that
couldn't hurt a mouse.
Davis' work has not received
much support. Most people feel
that there is no scientific evidence
that zombie powder can make
people into living dead. Enjoy a
spooky Halloween just the same!
Take your stake, your garlic, your
zombie antidote, and don't stray
by the Mausoleum alone!
