Fifty dwarfs in Ecuador and Israel may help
Stanford scientists answer fundamental questions
about human growth and have sparked inquiries
into the genetic link between these distant lands.
In April, Ron Rosenfeld, a pediatric endocrinolo
gist at the Medical Center received a $70,000, two
year grant from the March of Dimes to study Laron
dwarfism.
Twenty individuals in the mountains of Ecuador
and 30 more in Israel make up half the total number
of people affected by the growth defect in the world.
The rarity of the syndrome and the curious location
of Laron dwarfs make them interesting subjects.
"Whether the Israeli and Ecuadorian populations
are genetically related is still uncertain. Neverthe
less, both groups are characterized by fundamental
defects in the genetic regulation of the growth hor
mone receptor. Such abnormalities provide powerful
insights into the fundamental regulation of
growth," Rosenfeld said.
Aspects of Laron dwarfism
Laron dwarfs average 3 feet 7 inches tall and are
characterized by prominent foreheads, depressed
nasal bridges, short limbs in adults, blue scleras (the
usually white connective tissue in the eye) and limit
ed elbow extension.
"In essence," said Rosenfeld, "they appear to be
normal, bright alert people with a physical disability."
Laron dwarfs are primarily female. Rosenfeld and
his colleague Uta Francke, professor of genetics and
pediatrics, now speculate the genetic defect may pro
duce spontaneous abortions in males.
Most growth deficiencies are caused by bone
defects or a growth hormone deficiency. However,
Laron patients do not lack growth hormone. In some
cases, they have an abundance. The trouble is the
Laron dwarfs lack the necessary receptors in their
cell membranes to bind growth hormone.
Without the receptors, the body does not receive
the signal to manufacture insulin-like growth fac

tors (IGF-1), proteins necessary to stimulate the
growth of bones and cartilage.
A company in Geneva is now manufacturing syn
thetic IGF-1. In July, Rosenfeld will return to
Ecuador to bring six adult Laron patients back to the
United States for treatment with the new drug. He
will try to show that synthetic IGF-1 is safe and that
blood levels of the proteins can be artificially raised.
He hopes his work will help to unlock the secrets
of growth and provide insight and information for
other patients with Laron dwarfism and other
growth defects.
The genetic link
From an anthropological point of view, the Laron
patients are significant because they are clustered in
the mountains of Ecuador and in Israel. How did
people in such distant lands acquire the same
growth defect?
The clinical features of the two groups appear to
be identical, according to Rosenfeld. This offers evi
dence that the condition in each population stems
from a similar genetic defect.
"When we track what genetic defect is responsi
ble, we'll stand a good chance of tracing it and deter
mining if the condition is identical in the two
nations," he said.
Rosenfeld hypothesizes that the two populations
first converged when Jews accompanied the Con
quistadors to Ecuador in the 16th and 17th cen
turies. This is supported by the fact that the popula
tion in the southern Ecuadorian area of Loja is
almost entirely European, with little or no Indian
intermarriage.
Another possibility is that the genetic traits of the
Jews were transported to Ecuador by the Spaniards,
who had been cohabitants with the Jews. Jews with
the deficiency are Sephardic Jews from the Mediter
ranean. Intermarriage with Spaniards among these
Jews who lived in North Africa, and even Spain
itself, was not unknown during the Middle Ages.
Rosenfeld's findings should be available in about
one year.
