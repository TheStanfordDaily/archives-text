# Holograms to displace disks
## 3-D data storage can speed, expand computer memory 
### Andrew Neuschatz 
Researchers in Stanford's Department of Elec
trical Engineering have just about discovered how
many computer disks can dance on the head of a
pin.
A team of researchers studying computer data
storage is working on a way to store as many as 50
million bits of data — the contents of about seven
floppy disks — in a crystal rod one-eighth the size
of a pin.
The trick is the data are stored as holograms.
Most people know holograms as 3-D pictures,
like the dove£ and globes that hover inside credit
cards. The same technology that has been used for
years to store 3-D images is now being extended to
store pictures of computer information.
Since holograms are visual, a computer's bits

(its smallest units of information) must

be stored as a picture. To do this, a
small electrical grid about one

square inch — like a

tiny television
screen — dis
plays the bits
as a pattern
of dark and
light dots. A
laser beam <
is pointed

through this
display and into a

pinpoint-sized crys
tal where the picture
is to be stored. At the
same time, a second
beam, called

the refer
ence beam, is (
aimed at the

display from a dif
ferent angle.

To retrieve the information, the
reference beam alone is pointed at
the crystal, and an image of the bit
grid appears. Although the images
would mean nothing to a human
viewer, the computer can readily
convert them back into bits in its
memory.
The Stanford team, headed by
Professor Lambertus Hesselink,
recently discovered a substance for
the data holograms that allows
greater storage than ever before.
The material, strontium barium
niobate (SBN), "accepts multiple
images with reduced interference,"
according to Hesselink. In other
words, dozens of data holograms
can be saved in one crystal rod and
still be recalled separately.
Before SBN was used, data from
multiple images in a crystal would
blur together. Now the interference

is kept to a minimum, and 30 to 50 holograms can
be superimposed in a single rod.
For each hologram, a different phase, or partic
ular light pattern, of reference beam is used. Each
phase acts as a key to one page of the rod's mem
ory: To recall it, the key phase is pointed in, and
the page reappears.
The team has recorded holograms in squares
containing 250,000 bits and will soon attempt to
store one million bits, or 128,000 bytes, in a single
hologram. With up to 50 holograms, a rod might
store up to 6.4 megabytes of data. The rods can be
packed close together — thousands can fit in the
space taken by conventional hard disk.
One pair of lasers could read all the rods
stored in a single holographic storage unit. How
ever, no mechanical movement is necessary to
align the lasers. "There are no moving parts in

our current design," Hesselink said. Instead,
to steer the lasers toward a particular rod,

electromagnetic forces are used to bend the

lasers' paths.
Prof. Hesselink has

been collaborat-

ing on the pro
ject with grad
uate students
Jeff Wilde
and Muthu
Jeganathan,
as well as the

■s/ Microelectron
ics and Computer
Technology Corpora
tion of Austin, Tex.
Several other Ameri-

can and Japanese
. companies are
} also working on
holographic data
storage.

In addition to storing data in
extremely compact form, holographic
storage increases the speed at which
data can be recalled. Unlike conven
tional disk drives which store and
retrieve data one bit at a time, holo
graphic storage systems retrieve whole
pages of information at one time.
"The big advantage," says Hes
selink, "is that the transfer rate can be
one hundred or a thousand times
faster."
Although consumer products
that utilize holographic storage are at
least five years away, it is easy to fore
see the practical applications of such
technology. For example, computers
could store video much more easily if
they had the ability to store and retrieve
whole images at one time. A computer
with holographic storage could function
as a television, videocassette recorder
and compact-disc player, opening up
true multimedia computer use.
