## Johnson is not just another brick in the wall Soccer forward adds depth to offense and defense 
### Uri Attia Senior Staff Writer 
Why is the women's soccer
team so damn good this year?
One can point to a number of
reasons. There's the continued
improvement of the veteran play
ers. There's the added benefit of a
year's experience. There's the
brilliant defense and high-pres
sure offense.
But one reason that's cited
more than the rest is the surpris
ing contribution made by the
remarkable corps of freshmen on
the team. First-year players like
Melinda Minstrell, Jennifer
Stephan, Amanda Tyler, Kristen
Wair and Laura Wilkes, have had
an immediate impact on the
team's play.
But perhaps the most surpris
ing frosh contributor to the Cardi
nal's success this season is
Andrea Johnson. Johnson came
to the Farm with somewhat less
than grandiose expectations for
her first year in a Stanford uni
form.
"I just thought I might be help
the team off the bench or some
thing," Johnson said. "I just
wanted to play soccer — not nec
essarily in games."
Well, she's played in a slew of
games this season, missing only
one, and she's managed to be a
great help on the offensive end,
with five goals to her credit on the
year. Despite her offensive
prowess, the team's third-leading
scorer does not like to draw atten
tion to her ability to put the ball
in the opponents' net.

"I'd like to think that I'm a
team player," Johnson said.
"That's the most important."
Johnson prefers to discuss her
defensive role on the team.
"There's a defensive part of the
forward position that is often
overlooked," Johnson comment
ed. "When the other team's bring
ing the ball back, you've got to
pressure the ball and give the
midfielders time to recover and
play their defense."
This defensive-oriented frame
of mind has keyed much of the
Cardinal success this year. The
team has lived by the simple phi
losophy of "If they don't score,
they can't win" all season long —
denying its opponents a goal in all
but three of 15 games this season
— pushing Stanford to a 14-1
record.
When Johnson first arrived at
the Farm a few months ago, she
had no idea that she was going to
be an essential part of such a suc
cessful program.
"(During the team's 11-0 start)
I was thinking, 'God, how did I get
here?"' she recalled. "I had some

inkling of how good we were, but I
didn't expect to be (fighting for
the No. 1 seed in the West)."
Santa Clara is the team bat
tling Stanford for the No.l seed
and a first-round bye in the
NCAA Tournament. Although
the Broncos bested the Cardinal
in their only meeting, Stanford's
superior overall won-lost record
might earn them the top seed in
the West.
The Cardinal's hopes rose sig
nificantly, as Stanford was busy
crushing its two Texan foes over
the weekend, Santa Clara was los
ing to Portland.
Although the Cardinal heads into
the NCAA Tournament with its
defense operating at peak efficiency,
the lack of goalscoring in recent
games has been cause for some con
cern among Card soccer fans.
However, Johnson believes
that the close wins that have been
the norm recently are helping the
team far more than the 5-0
blowouts of old were.
"We've been playing a lot of
good teams," Johnson began,
"and we've got to accept that it's
OK to win games 1-0.
"These games have taught us a
lot . . . they've taught us patience
and also how to deal with close
games. Most of the games (in
NCAAs) will be those kind of close
games."
Before the team begins post
season play, it has two more oppo
nents to deal with. Before the reg
ular-season finale against North
ern Colorado Saturday, the team
must travel to the University of
San Francisco today to face the

Dons at 5:30 p.m.
Although USF is unranked,
Johnson nonetheless believes that
this game and the one to follow
are extremely important as
momentum-builders on the way
to the tournament.
"We've got to come out and

play like we have against all the
other teams," Johnson said. "We
have to put these teams away
solidly in preparation for the play
offs."
Johnson appears extremely
confident of her and her team's
ability to perform superbly. How

ever, assistant coach lan Sawyers
has found one glaring fault in
Johnson as a soccer player.
"He told me that I have to
work on my celebrating, that I'm
not good enough at it," she said.
Well, she should have many
occasions to improve on that.

one, and she's managed to be a
great help on the offensive end,
with five goals to her credit on the
year. Despite her offensive
prowess, the team's third-leading
scorer does not like to draw atten
tion to her ability to put the ball
in the opponents' net.

"I'd like to think that I'm a
team player," Johnson said.
"That's the most important."
Johnson prefers to discuss her
defensive role on the team.
"There's a defensive part of the
forward position that is often
overlooked," Johnson comment
ed. "When the other team's bring
ing the ball back, you've got to
pressure the ball and give the
midfielders time to recover and
play their defense."
This defensive-oriented frame
of mind has keyed much of the
Cardinal success this year. The
team has lived by the simple phi
losophy of "If they don't score,
they can't win" all season long —
denying its opponents a goal in all
but three of 15 games this season
— pushing Stanford to a 14-1
record.
When Johnson first arrived at
the Farm a few months ago, she
had no idea that she was going to
be an essential part of such a suc
cessful program.
"(During the team's 11-0 start)
I was thinking, 'God, how did I get
here?"' she recalled. "I had some

inkling of how good we were, but I
didn't expect to be (fighting for
the No. 1 seed in the West)."
Santa Clara is the team bat
tling Stanford for the No.l seed
and a first-round bye in the
NCAA Tournament. Although
the Broncos bested the Cardinal
in their only meeting, Stanford's
superior overall won-lost record
might earn them the top seed in
the West.
The Cardinal's hopes rose sig
nificantly, as Stanford was busy
crushing its two Texan foes over
the weekend, Santa Clara was los
ing to Portland.
Although the Cardinal heads into
the NCAA Tournament with its
defense operating at peak efficiency,
the lack of goalscoring in recent
games has been cause for some con
cern among Card soccer fans.
However, Johnson believes
that the close wins that have been
the norm recently are helping the
team far more than the 5-0
blowouts of old were.
"We've been playing a lot of
good teams," Johnson began,
"and we've got to accept that it's
OK to win games 1-0.
"These games have taught us a
lot . . . they've taught us patience
and also how to deal with close
games. Most of the games (in
NCAAs) will be those kind of close
games."
Before the team begins post
season play, it has two more oppo
nents to deal with. Before the reg
ular-season finale against North
ern Colorado Saturday, the team
must travel to the University of
San Francisco today to face the

Dons at 5:30 p.m.
Although USF is unranked,
Johnson nonetheless believes that
this game and the one to follow
are extremely important as
momentum-builders on the way
to the tournament.
"We've got to come out and

play like we have against all the
other teams," Johnson said. "We
have to put these teams away
solidly in preparation for the play
offs."
Johnson appears extremely
confident of her and her team's
ability to perform superbly. How

ever, assistant coach lan Sawyers
has found one glaring fault in
Johnson as a soccer player.
"He told me that I have to
work on my celebrating, that I'm
not good enough at it," she said.
Well, she should have many
occasions to improve on that.
