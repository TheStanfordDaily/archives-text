in the warm-ups before playing

be a long night.

Cardinal wins in three
15-3, 15-6, 15-13

While the No. 1 Cardinal
defeated the Spartans (7-11 over
all) in three games — 15-13, 15-6,
15-13 — the players did not per
form like the top-ranked team in
the nation.
"We just a hit a lot of balls out
and into the net. We were due for
a down game," coach Don Shaw
said.
The Cardinal hit an average
.223 for the match and held the
Spartans to only .144, but Stan
ford had more trouble from San
Jose State than they had
expected.
"We almost overlooked them,
which is a dangerous thing,"
junior Kristi Paaso said. "They
came out and played pretty well.
It gave us a nice jolt."
The Cardinal never could pull
away from the Spartans in the
first game, they had to come from
behind and hold off a rally to win.
San Jose State hung tough for a
while in the second game as well,
but Stanford wore the Spartans
down with clutch hitting from
senior Kristin Klein and junior
Bev Oden. Sophomore setter
Piper Hahn came off the bench for
junior Carrie Feldman when the
score was tied at six, and led the
team the rest of the way as Stan
ford held San Jose State scoreless

'We just a hit a lot
of balls out and
into the net. We
were due for a
down game.'
— coach Don Shaw

for the remainder of the game.
The third game was a dupli
cate of the first as Stanford
pulled ahead only to slip and let
the Spartans get close at 13-11
and 14-13 before winning the
match.
Stanford was pretty disap
pointed with its effort.
"We just came out so flat,"
sophomore hitter Heidi Eick said.
"We were all off tonight."
Although the Cardinal was
unhappy overall, there were
some bright spots for the team.
Klein hit .333 with 16 kills and
16 digs to lead the team, and
Oden added 13 kills, 8 digs, and a
.250 hitting percentage. Paaso
came off the bench in all three
games to post one of her best
matches this season, leading
Stanford in hitting with .353 and
eight spikes.
Shaw tried to be optimistic.
"When you can have a bad
night and win 3-0, I guess that's
good," he said.
Hahn, who had 25 assists and
five digs in running the offense,
agreed.
"It was a mid-season slump
and we just needed to get it out of
our system," she said.
Stanford hopes to be a little
more enthused when they face
Bay Area rival California on Fri
day night at Burn ham Pavilion.
"We definitely need to get
fired up for Cal," Hahn said.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily file
Amy Cooper and Jennifer Jackson combine on a block. Tuesday,
against the San Jose State Spartans, the Cardinal executed errati
cally on offense and defense. Stanford won in three games, main
ly due to the consistent hitting and digging of senior captain
Kristin Klein and junior Bev Oden.
