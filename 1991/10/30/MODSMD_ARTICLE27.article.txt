# Fine young cannibals enter dire straits
## Booters hope to chew up Don defense in clash with No.6 USF 
### Brian Egan Staff Writer 
"Hey, the ball's still in our hands. We can
make or break our season in the last three
games."
Senior midfielder Rhett Harty's words may
prove to be prophetic for the Stanford men's
soccer team. With NCAA Tournament bids
coming out in less than two weeks, the Cardi
nal (9-3-5) wraps up its regular season with a
contest today at the University of San Fran
cisco and home matches against San Diego
and California next week.
While all three remaining games are impor
tant for Stanford, it is USF that poses the
biggest threat for the Cardinal. The Dons (15-
2-0), ranked sixth in the country, are arguably
the strongest squad in the West. San Francis
co's current eight-game winning streak

includes a victory over then-No. 1 Santa Clara
Oct. 14, a loss which remains the only blemish
on the Broncos' record.
Although the Dons have four national
men's soccer championships to their name
already, they haven't won it all since 1980.
According to USF coach Steve Negoesco, the
team's national championship possibilities are
stronger this season than they have been in
recent years.
"We're doing pretty well lately, and we're
playing a lot better than we have in the past at
this point in the season," said the coach, cur
rently in his thirtieth year at San Francisco.
"Maybe it's time for us to win some games
that we normally would not win."
Negoesco, however, remains wary of the
Cardinal. "They're a little bit unpredictable, as
anyone around collegiate soccer would tell
you," he said. "They're a physically strong

club, and they're an excellent team for the lim
ited scholarships that they have to work with.
I've had guys who I'd have given a scholarship
go to Stanford and pay for their education."
Stanford, meanwhile, will play a familiar
role against USF — that of the underdog. San
Francisco is the ninth and final top-20 team
the Cardinal will face in 1991. "It should be a
very interesting game," said Stanford asst.
coach Greg Petersen. "[USF] has the home
field advantage, and that means a lot up there.
It will probably be foggy and cold, and they
have great fan support." .
In Harty's words, though, the Dons' high
ranking places Stanford in a favorable posi
tion. "[USF] is the top team in our region,"
the senior said. "We're supposed to lose to
them. We know that we can beat them, and
the way I see it, we have nothing to lose and
everything to gain in the situation."
