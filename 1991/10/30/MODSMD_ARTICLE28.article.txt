# Sign o' the times
## 
### 
I've got a baseball bat in my
closet, and sometimes I
take it out and swing it a
few times, just to feel its
weight. Then I sit down and
examine it, as I've done so
many times in the past. I can't
read the barrel's engraving,
which was worn away during
three summers' worth of after
noon ball games on the beach,
but I know what it once said:
Thurman Munson — N.Y.
Yankees.

I got the bat on Bat Day at
Yankee Stadium in 1978, and
it's one of my most prized pos
sessions.
Like most of my other
sports collectibles, the bat's
not in very goodcondition, and
consequently, it's not worth
much money, but that doesn't
bother me — I don't hold on to
it as an investment.
Just because the baseballs
that I have are scuffed and
moldy doesn't make them junk
to me.
When I grew up, collecting
was done for the love of the
game, not for the love of
money. We flipped our cards,
played catch with our authen
tic major league baseballs and
used our bats to improve our
swings. We didn't hide our col
lections away from human
hands in temperature con
trolled environments.
We didn't trade our col
lectibles if their market value
was falling. And we certainly
didn't buy autographs.
As a kid, when I got an
autograph at the ball
park, I had the player
sign my glove — in a very real
sense he was blessing it. Sure,
the autograph would fade in a
year or two, but I remembered
where it had been.
Today's collector would
never have a player sign his
glove, because a signature on a
card or a ball is worth more
money.
Today's kids read collecting
books chock full of numbers
and earning potential fore
casts as complicated as those
found in The Wall Street Jour
nal. They get their parents to
take them to card shows where
greedy ballplayers take $10
from these greedy brats and
give them an autograph in

return.
There is little human con
tact in these exchanges, since
they are simply business
transactions and any talking
between the two participants
would just slow down the pro
cess. Sometimes, to insure
maximum profits by avoiding
any conversation whatsoever,
the "stars" will sit and sign
behind a screen, invisible to
his indifferent clientele.
To me, both participants in
these exchanges are sell-outs.
The players are being paid
millions of dollars to play a
game for a living!
By buying tickets to games,
fans are indirectly paying play
ers' salaries. With this in
mind, is it unreasonable to
expect players to sign auto
graphs for free???
But the players aren't the
only ones at fault. If peo
ple exist who will pay
them for a signature, why
shouldn't they take the money
— sounds like good capitalistic
sense to me.
Most of the responsibility
for this problem lies with
today's collector, who through
unbridled greed has almost
ruined the relationship
between player and fan. And
by today's collector, I not only
mean people who spend thou
sands of dollars to accumulate
and maintain their balls, bats,
cards, and uniforms, but also
the three kids I saw at Candle
stick Park last spring, hanging
over the railing, dollars in
hand, waiting for a player to
walk by.
Indeed, anyone who would
pay for an autograph or throw
away a baseball card because it
isn't in mint condition or is
depreciating in value is part of
the problem.
Look, I didn't write this col
umn to sound superior. In
some people's eyes, I may be a
dinosaur, and we all know
what happened to them.
But I know that there are
people out there that share my
philosophy for collecting
sports memorabilia. For them
I have this advice:
When someone rags on
your collectibles and tells you
that they're worthless, don't
smile and take it — tell them
that they're wrong, and tell
them why. It's probably a
hopeless cause to try and
change their minds, but it's
better to argue with them then
to hit them over the head with
your "worthless" bat.
