# Editor raps 'prudish,' overly sensitive press
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
If you or someone you know
were raped, what would you
want the newspapers to print
the next morning? The details of
the assault? The alleged attack
er's name? The victim's name?
According to Geneva Over
holser, editor of the Des Moines
Register, your answer should be
"all of the above."
Overholser, who spoke last
night to a sometimes confronta
tional crowd in Kresge Auditorium,
gained national recognition last
year for her controversial decision
to print one rape victim's stoiy.
With the cooperation of the
woman, Nancy Ziegenmeyer,
reporter Jane Schorer wrote a
graphic five-part story detailing
what happened to Ziegenmeyer
from the morning of her assault
to the conviction of her assailant.
In her lecture, sponsored by
the John S. Knight Fellowships
for Professional Journalists,
Overholser argued that the tra
dition in the media of withhold
ing information out of "sensitiv
ity" prevents the public from
understanding issues by foster
ing a mistaken impression.
The resulting ignorance then
"keeps the public in the dark
and prevents change," she said.
"We suffer from a poverty of

civic discourse," Overholser said.
The media is "prudish" and
"has an overly large fear of
offending the public," according
to Overholser. She described a
"national orthodoxy" that
"forces us to listen to powerful
old white men in traditional
institutions and take what they
say as the truth."
Overholser said that in with
holding the names of rape vic
tims, the media single them out
and treat them differently from
other crime victims. The only
other victims whose names aren't
printed are juveniles, she said.
"And there's no accident in
the comparison," she added.
"You put victims in the position
of feeling that the norm is to not
identify them, that they should
lurk in the corner . . . and be
ashamed," Overholser explained.
"That contributes to stigma
tism," she said. "If the victim is
faceless, the crime is faceless."
Overholser said the media's
"national hypocrisy about sex"
extends to areas other than
rape, particularly AIDS and sex
ual harassment.
For example, she said, the most
"villainous" part about the Anita
Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings
was that the public was more out
raged at the graphic nature of the
hearings rather than at the act of
sexual harassment.
