# Elections reveal Polish discord
## Hoover visitors blame disillusionment with economy 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Like most Poles, visiting diplo
mats Boguslaw WLnid and Witold
Sobkow will not drink to the fact
that the Friends of Beer Party
gained three seats Sunday in
Poland's first free parliamentary
elections since 1947.
The diplomats, who are partici
pating in a 12-week training pro
gram at the Hoover Institution,
explained yesterday at the Bechtel
International Center how the elec
tion results reflect current eco
nomic and political problems in
their country.
Preliminary election results
indicate that 19 political parties
split the 460 parliamentary seats,
according to Winid.
Two parties closely associated
with the former Communist Party
came in second and third place to
take a combined 21 percent of the
vote. The strongest party, the

Democratic Union, won an unex
pectedly low 13 percent, and the
current prime minister's party
won only 7 percent of the vote.
Of the 27 million eligible voters,
only 42 percent cast ballots. And
according to Sobkow, the small
turn-out is a reflection of the eco
nomic situation.
"People are disillusioned, they
don't want to vote," he explained,
adding that Poles are impatient
for bigger, Western-size salaries.
The specter of mass unemploy
ment is one cause for widespread
worry in Poland. Sobkow ex
plained that the government is
currently grappling with the
touchy problem of privatizing
large factories, which would mean
laying off workers as owners
strive to increase profits.
However, small businesses are
prospering, he said. "The shops
look beautiful. . . . We've got
shops as you have at the Stanford
Shopping Center, we've got

Benetton. Of course, the prices
are enormous."
Sobkow added that people now
have a choice, in contrast to the
pre-1989 days, when all Polish
shops offered the same depressing
collection of government-spon
sored products.
He outlined the promising eco
nomic measures currently under
way. A new law on joint ventures
allows foreigners to invest an
unlimited amount of capital in
Polish firms, supplanting the pre
vious limit of $50,000. In addi
tion, Polish currency is now con
vertible on the world market.
"We're trying to find new ways,
including direct trade with the
Russian republics," said Sobkow.
Another result of complete inde
pendence from Soviet influence is
that Poles are now traveling all
over the world for new lessons.
And Poles are coming to Stan
ford instead of Moscow for their
diplomatic training.
