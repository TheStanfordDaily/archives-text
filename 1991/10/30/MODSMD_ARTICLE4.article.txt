# Selection of new VP near
## One candidate drops out of Student Resources race 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Decision-makers have now reached a final stage
in selecting the permanent vice president for stu
dent resources, one of the most powerful positions in
the University.
The new vice president will have jurisdiction over
a wide range of administrators and University func
tions, from judicial affairs to undergraduate admis
sions to health care.
A search committee for the permanent position is
reviewing evaluations of four remaining candidates
and will meet during the next two weeks to begin
discussing a final recommendation.
The search committee will submit its recommen
dation to Provost James Rosse, who will make the
final decision, according to Tina Kass, associate vice
president for planning and management.
Sally Mahoney, who is currently acting vice pres
ident of student resources, is among the candidates.
Each candidate for the position held an informal
meeting with students and faculty over the past
three weeks. One candidate, Maureen Anderson,
vice provost for student affairs at Washington State
University, dropped out of the running before her
scheduled meeting yesterday.
At each session, audience members received can
didate-evaluation sheets.
"If people turn in the sheets, they can make a big
difference," said senior Valerie Mih, the committee's
undergraduate representative.
The contenders
All four candidates described Stanford as a challenge
when explaining why they applied for the position.
The vice president of student resources oversees
the Dean of Students office, the Office of Residential
Education, Office of the Registrar, plus many other
areas and reports directly to the
Provost.
Mahoney spoke last Monday.
"I'm one of five candidates, and
the only insider proposing to take
on this responsibility," she began.
"Student Resources is for lead
ership in advocacy for students,"
she said. "It's large — it's respon
sible for $17 million in operating
budgets."
Mahoney said commitment to
need-blind admissions would be a
high priority. "You cannot pro
vide education or service to people
who aren't there," she said.
Referring to her 25 years of
experience at Stanford, Mahoney
stressed the need to prepare for
change. "We're all going to ride a
roller coaster together," she said.
"But it's fundamentally a good
system, so it will be a safe ride."
Stanley Levy, vice chancellor
for student affairs at the Univer
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Cham
paign, spoke Oct. 14.
"My priorities include Residen
tial Education, particularly at the
underclass level," he said. "And
the issues and programs and ser
vices that would maintain diversi
ty ... so you could continue with
the broad range of students that
you have here.
"Our responsibility is to help
people become something more
than what they were when they
entered," he added.
He described his management
style as "activist, participatory,
hands-on, involved. . . . Don't ask
Stan Levy for his opinion unless
you want it."
Student education outside of
the classroom was the main focus
of the meeting held by Mary
Edmonds, the vice president for
student affairs at Bowling Green
State University, on Oct. 10.
"Students spend at least two
thirds of their time out of the class
room," she said. "There needs to be
more out-of-classroom experiences
between them and the faculty....
When we have gotten faculty

involved with the students, they
find it a very rewarding experience."
Edmonds also addressed the
budget situation at Stanford. "It
is probably the worst of times, but
also the best of times," she said.
But, she continued, "I still want
to be here. It is a challenge,
because out of change can come a
lot of positive things."
Moses Turner, vice president of
student affairs at Michigan State
University, spoke Oct. 7. He
described himself as "a country
boy" who grew up in "a communi
ty where everyone cared about
each other," adding, "My sense of
community is what drives me
more than anything else."
A sense of community is also
part of Turner's administrative
style. "I'm a good manager," he
said. "Quick, snap judgements are
not part of my style — collabora
tion is."
Turner said he wants to "fill
the gap" between students and
faculty. "More and more, students
are missing the sense of wisdom
that the faculty can bring," he
said. "We have to focus on ways
that partnerships can be built."
