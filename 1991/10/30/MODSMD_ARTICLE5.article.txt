# Observers see glimmer of hope for Mideast peace

As the dream of a Middle East peace con
ference becomes reality today, area experts
agreed that the first step has been taken
toward resolution of the conflicts that have
caused turmoil in the region for five decades.
But many doubt the three-day meeting
of delegates from the United States, the
Soviet Union, Israel and the Arab nations
— to take place in Madrid — will produce a
lasting agreement on the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict.

This summer, a model peace treaty was
signed at Stanford by Israeli and Palestinian
representatives and sent to world leaders.
The document, "Framework for a Public
Peace Process," which calls for a two-state
solution to the region's problems, was drawn
up at a conference co-sponsored by the Stan
ford Center on Conflict and Negotiation and
the Palo Alto-based Beyond War Foundation.
One of the conference participants,
Mamdouh al-Aker, a surgeon from the
West Bank, will also represent the Pales
tinians in Madrid.
"The framework is an important model,"

said Judy Kramer of Beyond War. "It repre
sents the maximum that each side can get
and the minimum each will settle for." She
added, however, that it was unclear how
much the document will affect actual nego
tiations.
But Psychology Prof. Lee Ross, a
founder of the Stanford center, said the
framework does not represent a parallel sit
uation to the Madrid conference. Those who
participated in creating the framework, he
said, did not represent the government
hard-liners who will dominate the actual
conference.

The mere existence of the peace confer
ence may be seen as a success, Ross said,
because "no matter what happens, it is now
possible to negotiate because we have made
(negotiations) ordinary and taken away
some of the political risk involved."
Kramer said she is "very hopeful" about
the negotiations because "the region needs
to resolve the conflict ... in order to com
pete economically." And in a time of dra
matic political changes worldwide, the Mid
dle East conflict may be resolved more
quickly than experts have suggest
ed, Kramer said. "Just look at the
Berlin Wall and communism."
But not all members of the
Stanford community are as opti
mistic. "A tremendous amount of
effort has been put into the proce
dure, but almost no work on the
substance," said History Prof.
Joel Beinin.
"It's a first tiny step towards a
solution," said Ann Barhoum,
who is married to a Palestinian
and teaches a Stanford Workshop
on Political and Social Issues that
deals with Palestinian and Israeli
film and literature.
"Even if it doesn't fall apart
completely by the first week,
nothing miraculous is going to
happen," Barhoum predicted.
"It's going to be years of negotia
tion before anything comes to
pass."
Ross is also skeptical about an
agreement being reached in
Madrid, but said, "In the long

term, peace is inevitable." He pre
dicted that the talks will reach a
stalemate once each side has pre
sented its demands.
If a stalemate does occur,
Beinin predicted the United
States will have to take a more
active role. Such a deadlock, he
said, will test "the extent to which
the United States is willing to
engage in creative mediation."
Barhoum also emphasized the
United States' crucial role in
negotiations. "It remains to be
seen if the U.S. is really serious
about this," she said. "The key
really lies in the U.S.'s hands."
Eviatar Shafrir, an Israeli who
co-teaches the SWOPSI course
with Barhoum, said, "What we [in
the United States] are going to
hear is a lot of the Palestinians
and Israelis throwing mud at each
other. They can't let the outside
know what's going on for at least
a few months in order to protect
the negotiations."
Shafrir alluded to Israeli
author Amos Oz's perception of a
"Chekovian solution," and said,
"No one is going to be satisfied,
but everyone is going to be alive."
