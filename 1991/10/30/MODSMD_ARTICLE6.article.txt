# No place like home for co-op's residents
## Synergy community has found its niche 
### Matti Bunzl Staff writer 
Three moves in two years put a
strain on Synergy's unique ecosys
tem, but the co-operative is
rebounding â€” they're back to
brewing their own beer, growing
vegetables in the front yard and
baking bread at their new house at
634 Mayfield.
"Changing houses was trau
matic, but to come to a new house
was really community building,"
said senior Ethan Pride.
The original Synergy house,
located on the San Juan Hill, has
been empty since it was severely
damaged in the Loma Prieta
earthquake two years ago. "The
house had shifted off its founda
tions, so we had to move out,"
said Maggie Herrison, a senior
who lived in the original house.
Herrison said residents spent
two or three weeks without homes,
then rented several houses in Palo
Alto for the rest of the 1989-90
school year. But even though they
were dispersed all over Palo Alto
the residents tried to "stay togeth
er as a community," Herrison said.
Last year, Synergy was located
in the two Grove houses, Lasuen
and Mayfield. Graduate student
Eric Rose, last year's house man
ager, said the two separate houses
were far from ideal, since they
lacked a "common room and a

large enough kitchen."
Throughout last year, Synergy
residents hoped to return to their
original house, Hose said. "Howev
er, we had to think of alternatives
after the University decided to tear
down the old house last January."
Eventually, the University
administration offered Durand,
at 634 Mayfield, as Synergy's new
home, Rose said.
And this year's residents quick
ly restored Synergy's unique envi
ronment in the new location. "The
community here is unbelievably
supportive," senior Cecil Scheib
said.
"The community is really
diverse. It's especially important
that grads and undergrads can
live together," Rose said.
Synergy is a vegetarian co-op
and provides a choice between a
vegetarian and a vegan meal each
night. However, residents and eat
ing associates are also free to use
house funds to buy meat, Scheib
said.
"Synergy is very accepting of
alternative philosophies and
lifestyles," said Scheib, who as a
vegan refrains from eating meat
and all ot her animal products, such
as milk or cheese.
Food plays a central role in
Synergy, said Rose, adding that
"cooking and eating together real
