# Mideast conference opens today

### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — President Bush
and Mikhail Gorbachev urged Middle East
antagonists on the eve of a historic peace
conference to put aside ancient feuds and
"act responsibly with great understand
ing." Israel and Palestinians made last
minute declarations of good intentions.
A senior Palestinian official signaled
new flexibility yesterday, endorsing negoti
ations for autonomy within the occupied
territories, as Israel has demanded, rather
than immediate statehood.
And Israel said it would participate in
the talks despite attacks on its soldiers in
Lebanon and on settlers in the Israeli-occu
pied West Bank.
"Let's just open the conference and start
working," Gorbachev said at a joint news
conference with Bush at the Soviet
Embassy. Promised Bush: "We are here to
be a catalyst."
There was an air of suspense and antici
pation as the world awaited the first
Mideast peace conference in nearly two
decades and the first-ever direct, formal
negotiations among Israel and all her Arab
neighbors, including the Palestinians.
Bush and Gorbachev, co-sponsors of the
conference, will convene the meeting today.
The actual negotiations, if they stay on
track, could stretch into months or even
years.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
has offered the Arab nations peace after 43
years of conflict, but has ruled out relin
quishing territory. The Arabs are insisting
that they recover the West Bank, Gaza and
the Golan Heights, which Israel won in the
1967 six-day war.
Shamir has also offered limited self-rule
for Palestinians, who in a policy shift seem
to be edging away from demands of imme
diate statehood.

Shamir, arriving in Madrid, said Israel
would participate in the conference despite
attacks this week on its soldiers in Lebanon
and its settlers in the West Bank. Three
Israeli soldiers and two Jewish settlers
were killed.
"Some might have expected that in the
face of this terror Israel would not attend
the conference," Shamir said. "But despite
this violence, our quest for peace is unre
lenting."
In Beirut, meanwhile, a rocket fired
from a hillside blasted the wall of the U.S.
Embassy compound. There was no immedi
ate claim of responsibility. Iranian and
Arab radicals had promised to attack tar
gets of the United States and others
involved in the peace conference.
In Madrid, Faisal Husseini, leader of a
group of advisers accompanying the
Palestinian delegation, said the
Palestinians hoped to secure an agreement
for autonomy within Israeli-occupied terri
tories as a stepping stone to an independent
state. That state, he added, would later join
in a confederation with Jordan.
Israel rejects the idea of an independent
Palestinian state, but agrees to the idea of
Palestinian confederation with Jordan,
with whom the Palestinians are participat
ing in a joint delegation in Madrid.
Wary of terrorist threats, 12,000 police
officers and paramilitary civil guards were
deployed throughout the Spanish capital.
In other peace-conference develop
ments:
— Jordan's King Hussein predicted in
Amman, Jordan, that Israel would stop
building settlements in occupied lands once
the peace conference opens. Additional set
tlements would "threaten the (peace) pro
cess from the beginning," he told a London
based Arabic language newspaper.
