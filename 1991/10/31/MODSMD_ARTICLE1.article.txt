# Students complain of dorm intruders
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Members of four campus resi
dences have been disturbed by
intruders during the past few
weeks, including two who alleged
ly exposed themselves to students
in their rooms.
A female resident of the French
House was awakened in the mid
dle of the night Oct. 12 by an
intruder in her room. She said the
man told her that he was waiting
for her roommate, then undressed
in front of her.
In a similar incident at Grove-
Lasuen that same week, a male
student awoke to find a man
kneeling in front of him with his
shirt removed and his pants
pulled down to his ankles. The
intruder fled immediately.
Slavianskii Dom was repeated
ly visited by a young man who
posed as an acquaintance of sev
eral residents.
After several visits, during which
the intruder helped himself to food

in the house's kitchen and tried to
kiss a female student, residents
reported him to Stanford Police.
The intruder fled when the
Stanford Police arrived to investi
gate the complaints.
"We're sort of convinced that
he's not coming back," said resi
dent assistant Karin Gaisford.
About three weeks ago, Wilbur
Hall residents complained to police
about a balding, middle-aged man
loitering on all-female floors.
Diana Conklin, acting associ
ate dean for residential affairs,
issued a letter to all residents
explaining these events and warn
ing them to beware of strangers.
She said police did not believe
the incidents were related.
"It's fairly unusual to have four
disturbances all at once, but there
are always problems when people
leave their doors unlocked," she
said.
All four intruders are believed
to have entered the houses and
rooms through unlocked doors.
There have been no similar inci
dents since the original four were
reported to police.
But many campus residents are
still haunted by the intruders and
are taking precautions to ensure
their personal safety and security.
"It's kind of scary to think that
someone could just wander into
your room while you're asleep,"
said Dan Mandell, the RAin the
French House.
The incident there prompted
an emergency house meeting that
was attended by a representative
from Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services.
Gaisford also discussed securi
ty and other concerns with Sla
vianskii residents.
"We made it a community
issue, rather than an issue for

just a few women," Gaisford said.
"It wasn't a real fear for a lot of
people. They thought we were
being paranoid." â€¢
In order to prevent the intrud
ers from returning, campus resi
dents should report any suspi
cious visitors to their residence
staff and the police, Conklin said.
She also warns students, especial
ly those living on the ground
floors of their residences, to keep
their doors and windows locked.
"People in the outside world
keep their homes locked," she
said in the letter. "Stanford is no
safer than the outside world."
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said Stanford may be
even more vulnerable to distur
bances than the "outside world."
"This is in many ways a wide
open place and we want to main
tain a wide-open community,"
Jackson said. "But we need to be
cautious about people who don't
respect this community as much
as we do."
