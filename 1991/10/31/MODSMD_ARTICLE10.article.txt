# 'It's so heartbreaking'
## Researching AIDS in children 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
While other Stanford students are donning
condoms or marching in the streets, Julie Seavel
lo fights AIDS with her computer.
Seavello, a third-year medical student, is part
of a team of Stanford researchers helping to com
pile the Pediatric AIDS Surveillance Database, a
nationwide study of the treatment of AIDS in
children younger than 12.
"When I came here, I thought pediatric AIDS
would draw a lot of publicity, because it's so heart
breaking," Seavello says. "But it hasn't gotten the
attention it deserves because the caseload is so
small. It's only a few thousand, whereas the adult
caseload is hundreds of thousands."
But numbers aren't the only issue involved in
the three-year study, which is being sponsored by
the Centers for Disease Control and the National
Institutes of Health."
"As soon as you talk about pediatric AIDS, you
have to talk about the larger social conditions
affecting it, like drug abuse and unemployment,"
Seavello explains.
Most of Seavello's young patients were infect
ed by their HIV-positive parents. About one-half
of the children in the study are currently living in
foster homes.
Seavello said she is concerned about the way
doctors handle AIDS cases today.
"Right now, it's important that physicians
know that children with AIDS can live for quite a
long time," she says. "Their survival really
depends on good care and the support of their
families or foster families. That's why I'm here."
