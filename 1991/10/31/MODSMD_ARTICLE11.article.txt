Interest rates fall again
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve, following fresh signs of distress in the
U.S. economy, let a key interest rate fall yester
day in what many economists interpreted as a
signal the central bank had embarked on a new
round of credit easing.
The Fed allowed the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, to fall to
5 percent. Many analysts, but not all, saw the
development as a signal the central bank had
pushed its target range for this rate down from
its previous level of 5.25 percent in an effort to
stimulate economic activity.
EPA says air pollution worsening
WASHINGTON (AP) - Nearly 100 urban
areas have air pollution exceeding federal stan
dards, and many will need to take strong mea
sures such as using cleaner gasoline or controlling
industrial emissions to clean the air, the
Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday.
The EPA's identification of areas with the
worst air pollution gives notice to state and local
authorities who will have to impose new pollu
tion controls under the Clean Air Act.
Violence forces football forfeit
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Athletes and offi
cials at a suburban high school are forfeiting a
football game rather than take on an inner-city
rival at a stadium where they say gang violence
makes it too dangerous to play or watch.
On Monday, a 16-year-old student was shot as
he stood on a sidewalk outside city-run Jackie
Robinson Stadium, the playing field of adjacent
Dorsey High School in the Mid-City section. And on
Oct. 4, two students in the stands were wounded in
gang cross-fire during the final minutes of a game.
