# Peace talks open
## Arabs, Israelis begin negotiations 
### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — For
the first time in more than four
decades of bloodletting, Israel and
all its Arab foes sat down togeth
er, listening warily yesterday as
President Bush urged them to
forge a "territorial compromise."
Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev opened the
historic Middle East peace confer
ence over white-clothed tables in
Madrid's Royal Palace, then left
center stage to the participants.
There was some guarded opti
mism among the delegates about the
start of the peacemaking process.
But the opening session was
marked by a hard-line speech call
ing for full Israeli withdrawal
from war-won lands, including
east Jerusalem, by Amr Moussa,
foreign minister of Egypt, the only
Arab country which has made
peace with Israel.
There were also heated
exchanges between Israelis and
Arabs at televised news confer
ences and briefings.
The conference began against
the backdrop of threats of more
violence in the Middle East. In
Lebanon, thousands of Islamic
protesters demonstrated against
the talks, chanting "Death to
America, Death to Israel!" In
Iran, a hard-liner said all confer
ence delegates should be killed.
"Peace will only come as a result
of direct negotiations," Bush told
the delegates at the opening ses
sion, calling for territorial compro

mise as a means of finding peace.
But true to Middle East custom,
everyone present found different
meaning in that phrase.
Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa noted that
Bush had not used the phrase
land-for-peace, which encapsu
lates the Arab demand for the
return of the captured territory.
The new formulation worried
some Arabs because it seemed to
signal that the U.S. was backing
away from support for Israeli with
drawal. It was welcomed by Yossi
Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
who has contended that Israel ful
filled U.N. resolutions calling for a
return of territory when it
returned the Sinai Desert to Egypt.
But U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker, the architect of the
conference, said when asked to
interpret the new code words said
the speech did "not necessarily"
contain all elements of U.S. policy
— an ambiguity that may well be
purposeful.
Gorbachev — under whose
stewardship the Soviet Union
dropped its role as patron to hard
line Arab states — played a decid
edly secondary role.
Despite the chilly atmosphere,
the mere fact that the conference
was going into a second day was
something of a victory. The last
such face-to-face gathering, in
1973 in Geneva, broke up in acri
mony after a single day.
