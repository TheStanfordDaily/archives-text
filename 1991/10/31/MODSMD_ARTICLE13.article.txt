# Civil rights bill passed by wide Senate margin
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
overwhelmingly approved a major civil
rights bill yesterday that President Bush
has agreed to sign. It expands the rights
of sexual discrimination victims to sue
and negates a series of Supreme Court
rulings on job bias.
The bill now goes back to the House,
which has already approved a similar
measure. House Speaker Thomas Foley
said the House will take up the bill early
next week and predicted, "The House
will likely approve the Senate action."
The Senate approval, on a vote of 93-
5, came after three days of haggling over
a series of amendments. Senators
accepted changes that would apply the
bill's job protections, and those of other
anti-discrimination laws, to their
employees.
In addition, the Senate agreed to require
its own members to pay any judgments in
such cases out of their own pockets.
Senators voting "no" were Republicans
Dan Coats of Indiana, Robert Smith of
New Hampshire, Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho and
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming. Not voting
were Democrats Robert Kerrey of
Nebraska and Harris Wofford of
Pennsylvania.
The legislation has been in the works
for two years, since the Supreme Court
issued several rulings in 1989 that made
it more difficult for victims of job bias to
win lawsuits against their employers.
The bill had been stalled until a com

promise agreement last week by Senate
leaders of both parties and Bush.
That agreement laid to rest the politi
cally charged debate over hiring quotas,
which Bush had said earlier versions of
the bill would encourage.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
hailed the vote as "a resounding victory
for civil rights."
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
R-Kansas, who brought the administra
tion and Senate sponsors to the bargain
ing table last week, said the compromise
"is the only way out of the civil rights
quagmire, without producing quotas."
Democrats voiced complaints over the
bill's limits on the amount of damages
that can be awarded to victims of sexual
discrimination cases, although the bill
still represents a major expansion of their
rights. Kennedy said he would sponsor a
separate bill to remove those limits.
The agreement with Bush averted a
second threatened veto. A year ago, the
Senate sustained Bush's veto of a similar
bill by a single vote.
Before a final vote, the Senate
approved a bipartisan amendment apply
ing the job protections in the rights bill, as
well as those in the Civil Rights Act of
1964, age discrimination and disabled
rights laws to its own employees and to
most political appointees of the executive
branch.
It first accepted a modification to that
amendment requiring senators to pay
any judgments out of their own pocket.
