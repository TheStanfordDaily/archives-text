## The 						danger of peace 
### 
Threat of Khmer Rouge
overshadows hope for
democracy in Cambodia

The road to peace in
Cambodia has been a long,
tortuous journey as full of
pitfalls as the mine-ridden Cambo
dian landscape.
But last week in Paris, the quest
for a peaceful settlement may have
taken a step toward becoming a
reality; an agreement was finally
reached between the Vietnamese
backed government and the three
main Cambodian rebel factions.
Battle-weary Cambodia seems
ready to begin the arduous process
of healing its wounds of the past
two decades. Over 350,000 refugees
are to be repatriated to their home
land, rival armies are to be demobi
lized and elections are scheduled for
1993.
But beneath the much-vaunted
success of the peace talks lies a
deeply disturbing fact: The brutal
Khmer Rouge have been given a
powerful role in the new Cambodi
an government and a heightened
sense of legitimacy.
During its four-year reign of ter
ror in the 19705, the Khmer Rouge
were responsible for the deaths of
over one million people.
Pol Pot, the infamous former
Khmer leader, attempted to reor
ganize the country into a racially
pure, Marxist society. Although he
officially stepped down from power
in 1986, Pol Pot is widely believed
to remain firmly in control of the
rebel faction from a hideout in the
jungle of northern Thailand.
Given that the Khmer Rouge
have between 50,000 and 100,000
armed rebels, and that the peace
agreement permits them to contin
ue purchasing arms on the inter
national market, the accord seems
unlikely to accomplish its mission
of national healing and rebuilding.
A former rebel leader wearing a
three-piece suit in a government

office is a frightening prospect. If
any of the former barbaric leaders
is allowed to return to power, the
accord could prove tragic.
But given the political realities
of that Southeast Asian nation, it
is perhaps surprising that a settle
ment was reached at all. Any
agreement simply had to include
the powerful Khmer Rouge.
However, in allowing them to
maintain a high level of military
capability, the agreement's spon
sors committed an egregious error.
The primary burden of assuring
that nothing disastrous occurs
rests on the United Nations' ability
to put together an effective oversee
ing body.
According to the peace plan, the
United Nations will send thou
sands of officials to Cambodia
under the auspices of the U.N.
Transitional Authority. An esti
mated 20,000 to 30,000 U.N. sol
diers and administrators will be
needed to oversee the running of
the country through elections
scheduled for mid-1993.
In essence, the United Nations
will be running the country. This is
an unprecedented level of involve
ment for the organization and
could prove beyond its means.
The Khmer Rouge has already
been accused of forcibly repatriat
ing refugees within territory under
its control as well as intimidating
them in preparation for the upcom
ing elections. How the United
Nations handles such allegations
as well as the myriad other prob
lems involved in running a war
torn nation remains to be seen.
At long last, the international
community has committed itself to
solving Cambodia's problems.
While the proposed route to peace
proves to be an enormous gamble,
any odds at achieving peace are
better than the present state of
chronic civil war in Cambodia.
But the world will have to pay
careful attention to the evolution of
events there. After two decades of
constant civil strife, the Cambodian
people deserve the chance to rejoin
the body of peaceful nations.
