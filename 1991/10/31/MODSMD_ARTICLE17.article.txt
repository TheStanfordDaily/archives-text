The Daily provides missing gentle reminders from mom

I FIND IT EXTREMELY comforting to
know that everyday all I have to do is
tune in to The Daily's editorial section
in order to receive warm motherly advice.
Since I am so far from home, it is
next to impossible for me to receive tid
bits of cautionary advice and rhetoric
from my beloved mother before I ven
ture forth from the safe confines of my
dorm room.
The Daily's helpful and insightful
parental novellas have so far curtailed
my destructive use of alcohol and have
also proven to be far superior to any
bicycle safety film I have ever seen.
I have also been enlightened as to
how lucky I am to be at Stanford — I
could be stuck in some Third World uni-

I have also been enlightened as to how lucky I
am to be at Stanford...

versity where nightly I would have to
fight diseased, pus-oozing cockroaches
while sleeping on a cold, hard floor.
Recently, The Daily's editorial section
has also molded my conscience much
better than my own mother has.
Its suggestion of canceling the yearly
Big Game Bonfire "in a show of respect
for the tragedy that has occurred at our
rival school" has completely changed my
life; it has essentially acted as the guid

ing light (no pun intended) in my devel
opment of an honorable conscience.
I only wish that students who attend
UC-Berkeley had the motherly resource
that we have here at Stanford.
Perhaps if they did, they would never
even think of scheduling a bonfire of
their own. As the Oct. 29 San Francisco
Examiner reports, those cretins across
the Bay actually plan to hold a bonfire at
the Greek Theatre on Friday, Nov. 1 to

rally students for their football contest
against USC.
To think that they could do such a
thing! The scenario becomes even more
hideous when one thinks about the hor
rible fires that destroyed parts of Watts
years ago during the infamous riots.
I sincerely thank the higher powers
above The Daily's nurturing editorials,
for I would never want to ignorantly
provide an "unsympathetic, unsports
manlike slap in the face to the students
and other members of the Berkeley com
munity" by actually attending a Big
Game bonfire endorsed by Stanford.
