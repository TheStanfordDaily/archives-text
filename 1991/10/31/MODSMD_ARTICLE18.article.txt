# Childish bikers must pay more attention to bicycle safety rules
## 
### 
I have just read The Daily's editorial
"Renegade roadsters" and am glad the
police are enforcing the vehicle code for
cyclists; or maybe our two-wheeled ter
rors don't even know there are rules for
cyclists in the California Vehicle Code
book. I suspect not, as the editorial says
the police need to do a better job of pub
licizing the rules and consequences for
breaking them.
Two years ago there was a Bicycle
Safety Committee as part of the Uni
versity Committee on Parking and
Transportation (CPT) who did quite a
good job publicizing bicycle safety on
campus with regular ads in The Daily,
etc.
Last year it was decided to disband
the Bicycle Safety Committee as the
CPT had matters of greater urgency to
consider. However, after three very close
calls, reading about accidents in The

Daily and campus-wide observation of
these demon riders, I proposed to the
chair of the CPT that the safety commit
tee be reactivated and was asked to be
the chair.
After discussion with various mem
bers of the Police Department and Safe
ty Office, it was agreed that stronger
enforcement of the vehicle code was nec
essary, but that there wasn't sufficient
staff to make an all-out effort, and the
budget crisis prevented hiring more per
sonnel.
The students at this university like to
think of themselves as adults, but a lot
of them are still conducting themselves
like toddlers, totally ignoring the basic
road safety rules they were taught by
their parents.
Students, you have been released
from your parents' control — NOW it is
up to you to prove you are the adults
you think you are by regarding the
rights and safety of everyone in the
Stanford community and not foist the
responsibility onto the police.
