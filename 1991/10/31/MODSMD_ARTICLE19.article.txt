# Complaints about The Daily often based on confusion of purpose
## 
### 
I would like to encourage members of
the Stanford community, especially those
who feel that The Daily's Sports section is
not worth reading, to contemplate the
implications of the article on Oct. 29 titled
"The Daily — for students, by students."
The constant haranguing The Daily
receives from an irate student, a con
fused professor or a miffed resident fel
low, in my opinion, just goes to show
how unsure some people seem to be
about what they themselves are sup
posed to be doing at Stanford.
When they don't like the message The
Daily delivers, they stone the messenger.
The staffers of The Daily, although I dis
agree with their editorials from time to
time, seem to be more certain about
what their task should be — to help
improve the community.
Perhaps part of the conflict stems from
the fact that, in attempting to be disci-

plined and to maintain "professional dis
tance," The Daily is actually performing
its function in a highly competent manner.
I am well aware that Stanford is full
of students, faculty and administrators
who take themselves and their "work"
so seriously that they are unable to see
the forest from the trees. Often, the
result is an atmosphere of insecurity and
selfish intolerance.
For those readers who do not have
the ability to read between the lines, I
would suggest that they consider the
article in question as "The Daily — for
Stanford, by students."
