# Further reductions lower staff morale

Budget cuts from "reposition
ing" during the last two years have
led to increased tension in the work
place — stress that will probably be
even worse with the new round of
reductions, staff members say.
"People avoid asking 'How are
you doing?' because they know
there isn't going to be a positive
response," said Michael Miller,
chief librarian at Meyer Library.
Instead, he added, a more fre
quently asked question is "Are
you sleeping OK?"
Repositioning is the recently
completed $22-million reduction
in administrative services. New
cuts will follow from last week's
deficit plan aimed at reducing
Stanford's operating budget by
$43 million.
Frederick Biedenweg, assistant
vice president for strategic plan
ning and financial management,
said "Little things ... are now set
ting people off" that would not
normally do so.
The added tension is a result of
the uncertainty over the budget.
It is also a result of the extra work
people have to do when resources
are cut but services and expecta
tions are not.
For instance, in some branch

libraries, staff are continuing to
provide services — on their own
time — to faculty or graduate stu
dents, even though these func
tions have theoretically been cut.
"We do that all the time....
You get to know the grad students.
.. . You're not going to say 'We
don't do this anymore,' " said Jen
nifer Stringer, a staff member at
the Engineering library.
Biedenweg said, "It happens
because of people wanting to do a
good job."
The extra work has limited the
decrease in service quality from
previous budget cuts. But this
may change with the new round
of reductions. "We can't take
another cut of this size and con
tinue to provide the same ser
vice," said Ann Porteus, associate
director of Residential Education.
The repositioning cuts have led
some staff to feel they are over
worked.
In the Legal Office, attorneys are
often found working until 1 a.m. on
weekdays and frequently come in
on weekends, said Assoc. University
Counsel Robin Kennedy.
"Psychologically, I would say
we're numb. . . . It's hard to sus
