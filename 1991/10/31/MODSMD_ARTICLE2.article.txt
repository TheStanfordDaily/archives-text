# Further reductions lower staff morale

### Yaser Haddara 
Budget cuts from "reposition
ing" during the last two years have
led to increased tension in the work
place — stress that will probably be
even worse with the new round of
reductions, staff members say.
"People avoid asking 'How are
you doing?' because they know
there isn't going to be a positive
response," said Michael Miller,
chief librarian at Meyer Library.
Instead, he added, a more fre
quently asked question is "Are
you sleeping OK?"
Repositioning is the recently
completed $22-million reduction
in administrative services. New
cuts will follow from last week's
deficit plan aimed at reducing
Stanford's operating budget by
$43 million.
Frederick Biedenweg, assistant
vice president for strategic plan
ning and financial management,
said "Little things ... are now set
ting people off" that would not
normally do so.
The added tension is a result of
the uncertainty over the budget.
It is also a result of the extra work
people have to do when resources
are cut but services and expecta
tions are not.
For instance, in some branch

libraries, staff are continuing to
provide services — on their own
time — to faculty or graduate stu
dents, even though these func
tions have theoretically been cut.
"We do that all the time....
You get to know the grad students.
.. . You're not going to say 'We
don't do this anymore,' " said Jen
nifer Stringer, a staff member at
the Engineering library.
Biedenweg said, "It happens
because of people wanting to do a
good job."
The extra work has limited the
decrease in service quality from
previous budget cuts. But this
may change with the new round
of reductions. "We can't take
another cut of this size and con
tinue to provide the same ser
vice," said Ann Porteus, associate
director of Residential Education.
The repositioning cuts have led
some staff to feel they are over
worked.
In the Legal Office, attorneys are
often found working until 1 a.m. on
weekdays and frequently come in
on weekends, said Assoc. University
Counsel Robin Kennedy.
"Psychologically, I would say
we're numb. . . . It's hard to sus
tain the level of effort that we've
been putting in when we perceive
we're not highly valued," said
Kennedy, who is married to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
The Legal Office was targeted
for a 19.2 percent reduction in the
current round of cuts, and, in
total, will have been reduced by
over 30 percent.
The primary frustration, said
Porteus, is the prolonged uncer

tainty that is part of the decision
making process. "It's . . . going on
for so long; it's hard to keep
enthusiastic," she said.
Having two sets of reductions
back-to-back also makes it diffi
cult, Biedenweg said. "One gets
weary."
Another major concern of many
staff members is job security.
"Whether you're thinking of your
self or you're thinking of someone
you've been working with for ten
years, it doesn't make you feel
good," said Lois Sher, a staff mem
ber at the Engineering library.

Kennedy said, "You worry for
two reasons. The main reason is
that your colleagues are your
friends. You worry for them. It's
worrisome and frightening partic
ularly in a time of recession."
University employees are also
concerned with how work will be
redistributed.
"It's like an earthquake," said
Porteus. "You don't wake up
every morning and say 'Oh my
God! There could be an earth
quake today. [But] it's always at
the back of your mind."
Jenny Morgenstern, an office

assistant at Operations and Main
tenance, commented that the
cuts, and the sacrifices that come
with them, are all just part of the
job. "It's what the university has
to do," she said.
"Everybody is asked to do a little
bit more, and if you like your job and
you like where you work you should
be able to do that," she added.
"I am incredibly impressed by
how people have gone on," said
Porteus.
Nonetheless, "we cannot do
the same as what we've done
before," Miller said.
