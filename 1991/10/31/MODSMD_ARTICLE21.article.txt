## A
						bit of slivovitz 
### 
I WAS IN JERUSALEM THE FIRST
time I got drunk. Summer was ending
and I was 15 years old, traveling
around Israel with a bunch of American
high school students. In honor of our last
night in the country, my friend Josh pro
cured us a bottle of slivovitz.
Slivovitz is a Yugoslavian plum brandy,
something akin to a sweet, syrupy vodka.
It's 120 proof. Four of us put down a liter
bottle in half an hour.
1 had the time of my life for a while. I
hugged and kissed everybody, told very
funny jokes and danced 'til four.
Then the slivovitz lost some of its
charm. The room spun around much too
quickly. I became melancholy. I threw up.
I was amazed that one event could be
both so wonderful and horrible. My little
drinking episode was an eye-opener. That
entire summer trip was an eye-opener.
Until that summer I had known only
the wonderful aspects of Israel. Israel
was a land of glorious miracles — a
phoenix that rose from the ashes of the
holocaust. Here, Jews had ended 2,000
years of persecution by re-establishing
their homeland.
Israel was a beautiful land of majestic
deserts, wild metropolises, holy cities and
Mediterranean beaches. But most
impressive were the people. Everybody
was Jewish. The airline pilot was Jewish.
The baggage checker was Jewish; the taxi
drivers were Jewish.

The whole country seemed to be filled
with family members. I felt I had left one
home in America and discovered a second
in Israel.
But during my trip I saw another side
of Israel. This part was not filled with
beautiful tourist spots. It was filled with
scenes of Jews and Arabs at war with
each other.
In this part of Israel a young Israeli sol
dier told me, "God forbid my mother
should find out what I do those nights I'm
stationed on the Lebanese border." In this
part of Israel a Palestinian shepherd spat
at me when he discovered I was Jewish.
These were eye-opening parts of Israel.
They made the country seem like a
schizophrenic on slivovitz — the Jews got
drunk, and the Palestinians suffered the
hangover.
I was surprised to discover the exis
tence of this other Israel. At 15 years old,
I was just beginning to realize that such
dilemmas existed. I was just beginning to
grasp that situations could be simultane
ously so wonderful and so terrible.
This task of dilemma appreciation is the
first one facing Arabs, Palestinians and
Israelis as they meet this week in Madrid.
The central problem of the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict is that both peoples claim
the same territory as their homeland.
Yet for years these groups have
refused to admit or care that their own
national aspirations limit those of their

adversary. They also don't realize that
they destroy themselves by persecuting
each other. Like an unrepentant alco
holic, they see only the positive side of
their aspirations.
They refuse to acknowledge the hang
overs they suffer as a result of their
national habits. It is just and right that
they pursue their national goals, but it is
immoral to establish one's nation by
crushing another.
The Palestinians have spent the last 40
years trying to establish a state by driving
Israel into the sea. With the exception of
Egypt, the Arab nations have refused to
recognize Israel's right to exist. This must
stop. They must unequivocally accept
Israel, both in word and deed.
In turn, the Israelis must accept the
establishment of a Palestinian state on
the West Bank and Gaza. No national
vision of a Greater Israel justifies the
brutal occupation of an entire people.
Until the parties in Madrid open their
eyes to these realities, no peace will be
made. Perhaps they should open the con
ference with a bit of slivovitz.
