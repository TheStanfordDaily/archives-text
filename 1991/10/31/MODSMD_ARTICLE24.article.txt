## Steady Stolz ready to spook competition at Pac-10s Junior runner primed for home meet

jathlete is overshadowed by the sporting
prowess of a sibling. Unfortunately for

[invitational on Oct. 21, Stolz led all Stan
ford runners with a sixth-place finish. He
covered the 8,000-meter course in 27 min
'utes, 14.4 seconds.
' "I was very happy. The competition was
very stiff and I had no idea how I was going
to do there," Stolz said. "So it was very nice
)*unning with all these guys who were All-
Americans."
The team, as a whole, also ran well.
"Stanford finished fifth, two points behind
nationally-ranked Michigan State.
"(In Arizona) people were finally getting
it done. We have the potential to take sec
ond in that race," Stolz said. "It's just a
matter of five guys on any certain day run
ning the race of their lives." (A team's
score is the total of the places of the top five
competitors on the squad).
Stolz's philosophy on how to achieve the

ultimate race is simple — just run fast. "So
many sports are synthesized. You need a
ball or refs. Cross country comes down to
who can run the fastest. It's that simple,"
he explained. "[The cross country team
members] all say we run because we're not
good at anything else."
Though passionate about racing, Stolz's
first love is one of the "synthesized" sports
— soccer. He grew up playing the game,
before cross country training took prece
dence.
"[Soccer] is a great sport. It would be
fun to go out there and play and think
about being on the team, but I'd get
worked and I know it," Stolz said.

in running. "[Soccer] takes
endurance and coordination.
There's definitely skill involved,"
he said. "Soccer is more of a team
sport."
He is quick to emphasize,
though, that this year's cross
country squad is much tighter —
mainly due to the efforts of team
captain, Dave Scudamore.
"Dave's doing a really good job
with that. In the past it's always
been individuals and a little bit of
team," Stolz said. "We're finally
starting to do some bonding,
which is nice to see. I think that's
why we're starting to do better."
The Cardinal harriers will have
a chance to see just how improved

they are this weekend as they host
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships. Although the competi
tion offers nothing more tangible
than bragging rights — individu
als and teams qualify for NCAAs
at the District 8 meet — Stolz and
teammates are eager to gauge
their progress against top Pac-10
foes Arizona and Oregon.
"Dave and I have to be in the
lead pack and Fred (Carter) has
got to be right there with us. Then
we need another strong showing
from the fourth and fifth guys,"
Stolz said. "Bennie (Cravatt) is
running really well. He'll be there
and so will Derek (Bork). That's
what made me happiest about
Arizona — those two guys run
ning well."
Stolz realizes that, if he is to
run up to his potential in the next
couple of weeks, he has a few

things to work on. "I need to learn
to run more on my own. Right
now I rely a lot on my teammates.
I can't just take the lead in a race
and run,"he explained. "I'm used
to seeing Dave just ahead of me.
When I'm next to him, I know I'm
in good position. But, without
him, I don't know what I'm
doing."
While staying in the pack may
be Stolz's Achilles heel, he's well
aware of his strengths. "I'm not

very fast, but once I start run
ning, I can do it forever."
While his career won't last for
ever, Stolz has made some long
term goals. He wants to finish in
the top five at Pac-lOs and qualify
for NCAAs at District Bs. Then,
he'd like to be Ail-American.
But for now, Stolz is concentrat
ing on the meet at Stanford Golf
Course Saturday. "I love golf cours
es. They're so beautiful — and all
grass. Coming from Los Angeles,
all my high school courses were
concrete or pavement," he said.
The only time soon Stolz may
be pounding pavement is tonight,
trick-or-treating. "I was going to
be Liberace, but I forgot my cos
tume so I'll have to improvise. All
I know is it won't be as a runner,"
he said with a smile.
Saturday will be soon enough
to assume that role.

at the District 8 meet — Stolz and
teammates are eager to gauge
their progress against top Pac-10
foes Arizona and Oregon.
"Dave and I have to be in the
lead pack and Fred (Carter) has
got to be right there with us. Then
we need another strong showing
from the fourth and fifth guys,"
Stolz said. "Bennie (Cravatt) is
running really well. He'll be there
and so will Derek (Bork). That's
what made me happiest about
Arizona — those two guys run
ning well."
Stolz realizes that, if he is to
run up to his potential in the next
couple of weeks, he has a few

things to work on. "I need to learn
to run more on my own. Right
now I rely a lot on my teammates.
I can't just take the lead in a race
and run,"he explained. "I'm used
to seeing Dave just ahead of me.
When I'm next to him, I know I'm
in good position. But, without
him, I don't know what I'm
doing."
While staying in the pack may
be Stolz's Achilles heel, he's well
aware of his strengths. "I'm not

very fast, but once I start run
ning, I can do it forever."
While his career won't last for
ever, Stolz has made some long
term goals. He wants to finish in
the top five at Pac-lOs and qualify
for NCAAs at District Bs. Then,
he'd like to be Ail-American.
But for now, Stolz is concentrat
ing on the meet at Stanford Golf
Course Saturday. "I love golf cours
es. They're so beautiful — and all
grass. Coming from Los Angeles,
all my high school courses were
concrete or pavement," he said.
The only time soon Stolz may
be pounding pavement is tonight,
trick-or-treating. "I was going to
be Liberace, but I forgot my cos
tume so I'll have to improvise. All
I know is it won't be as a runner,"
he said with a smile.
Saturday will be soon enough
to assume that role.
1 It's not often that a top-notch collegiate
jathlete is overshadowed by the sporting
prowess of a sibling. Unfortunately for
Cardinal cross country runner Gary Stolz,
Jiis sister is a world champion.
Liz Stolz began the women's Ultimate
'team at UC-Santa Barbara as a freshman
,jand, in her senior year, the Gauchos won
.the national title. She went on to lead the
;J989 World Championship team in West
While this may be a lot to live up to,
'>Gary holds his own. In only his second year
gof collegiate competition, Stolz has proven
'iie can race with the best. In the Arizona
[invitational on Oct. 21, Stolz led all Stan
ford runners with a sixth-place finish. He
covered the 8,000-meter course in 27 min
'utes, 14.4 seconds.
' "I was very happy. The competition was
very stiff and I had no idea how I was going
to do there," Stolz said. "So it was very nice
)*unning with all these guys who were All-
Americans."
The team, as a whole, also ran well.
"Stanford finished fifth, two points behind
nationally-ranked Michigan State.
"(In Arizona) people were finally getting
it done. We have the potential to take sec
ond in that race," Stolz said. "It's just a
matter of five guys on any certain day run
ning the race of their lives." (A team's
score is the total of the places of the top five
competitors on the squad).
Stolz's philosophy on how to achieve the

ultimate race is simple — just run fast. "So
many sports are synthesized. You need a
ball or refs. Cross country comes down to
who can run the fastest. It's that simple,"
he explained. "[The cross country team
members] all say we run because we're not
good at anything else."
Though passionate about racing, Stolz's
first love is one of the "synthesized" sports
— soccer. He grew up playing the game,
before cross country training took prece
dence.
"[Soccer] is a great sport. It would be
fun to go out there and play and think
about being on the team, but I'd get
worked and I know it," Stolz said.
The characteristics Stolz enjoys most
about soccer are the traits he finds lacking

After sitting out the first two meets of the year due to a minor hamstring injury, Gary Stolz has regained racing form in time
for the Pac-10 Cross Country Championships.
in running. "[Soccer] takes
endurance and coordination.
There's definitely skill involved,"
he said. "Soccer is more of a team
sport."
He is quick to emphasize,
though, that this year's cross
country squad is much tighter —
mainly due to the efforts of team
captain, Dave Scudamore.
"Dave's doing a really good job
with that. In the past it's always
been individuals and a little bit of
team," Stolz said. "We're finally
starting to do some bonding,
which is nice to see. I think that's
why we're starting to do better."
