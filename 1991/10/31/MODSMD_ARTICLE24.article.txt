## Steady Stolz ready to spook competition at Pac-10s Junior runner primed for home meet 
### Gretchen Atwood Editorial staff 
1 It's not often that a top-notch collegiate
jathlete is overshadowed by the sporting
prowess of a sibling. Unfortunately for
Cardinal cross country runner Gary Stolz,
Jiis sister is a world champion.
Liz Stolz began the women's Ultimate
'team at UC-Santa Barbara as a freshman
,jand, in her senior year, the Gauchos won
.the national title. She went on to lead the
;J989 World Championship team in West
While this may be a lot to live up to,
'>Gary holds his own. In only his second year
gof collegiate competition, Stolz has proven
'iie can race with the best. In the Arizona
[invitational on Oct. 21, Stolz led all Stan
ford runners with a sixth-place finish. He
covered the 8,000-meter course in 27 min
'utes, 14.4 seconds.
' "I was very happy. The competition was
very stiff and I had no idea how I was going
to do there," Stolz said. "So it was very nice
)*unning with all these guys who were All-
Americans."
The team, as a whole, also ran well.
"Stanford finished fifth, two points behind
nationally-ranked Michigan State.
"(In Arizona) people were finally getting
it done. We have the potential to take sec
ond in that race," Stolz said. "It's just a
matter of five guys on any certain day run
ning the race of their lives." (A team's
score is the total of the places of the top five
competitors on the squad).
Stolz's philosophy on how to achieve the

ultimate race is simple — just run fast. "So
many sports are synthesized. You need a
ball or refs. Cross country comes down to
who can run the fastest. It's that simple,"
he explained. "[The cross country team
members] all say we run because we're not
good at anything else."
Though passionate about racing, Stolz's
first love is one of the "synthesized" sports
— soccer. He grew up playing the game,
before cross country training took prece
dence.
"[Soccer] is a great sport. It would be
fun to go out there and play and think
about being on the team, but I'd get
worked and I know it," Stolz said.
The characteristics Stolz enjoys most
about soccer are the traits he finds lacking
