' The defender abandons all
hope of stopping the small white
field hockey ball, and instead tries
desperately to get out of the way.
WHACK!
' The opposing goalkeeper can
only but watch as yet another ball
whizzes by at an absurd velocity.
What exactly is the origin of
the ball's high speed and short
lived travel? Or, rather, who?
They call her Ice.
, "Everyone on the team gets a
vegetable for a nickname. I'm Ice
berg Lettuce. Ice for short," said
sophomore forward Sara Hallock.
And, boy, can she ever ice the ball.
"I guess I've always hit hard,
ever since high school," Hallock
said. And this ball abuse has
translated into some high speed
results as well. Hallock leads a
team that is 9-3-1, a team that is
a cinch to win its second straight
Northern-Pacific Conference title,
and a team that will, for the sec
ond consecutive year, head east
ffcr the NCAA Tournament.
• Stanford may not know it, but
it has a dominant player on its
roster. On a team that is ranked
No. 20 nationally, Stanford field
hockey's Hallock may very possi
bly be among the country's best.
The Cardinal field hockey team
is a very tightly knit group, and
the team-oriented attitude trans
lates clearly onto the field. The
offense works together as a unit,
passing the ball effectively and

selflessly. Other players such as
junior assists leader Chris Trevi
no and senior captain Susan
Leckrone embody this team men
tality. But someone has to put the
ball into the goal, and that some
one has been Hallock — in a big
way.
"She is definitely the biggest
scorer we've had in a long time,"
said coach Sheryl Johnson. "Sara
is doing a great job for us."

Is she ever. "Ice" leads Stan
ford with 15 goals, and provides a
large portion of the Cardinal's
offensive punch. Stanford has
outscored its opponents 26 to 16
this season, and simple arith
metic shows how valuable Hal
lock's knack for scoring has been.
And she can absolutely nail the
ball.
"Sara is a very strong girl,"
Johnson said. "She is so effective.

She has such a good shot that the
defense can't react in time."
This knack was originally
found in high school where she
had 102 career goals, including 50
goals her senior year. (Those are
not typos.) And this knack could
very easily never have been dis
covered.
"Before high school, I had
never heard of [field hockey],"
Hallock said. "But I was looking
for something tj> play the season
before soccer, anda friend of mine
suggested I try field hockey. So I
did."
In her freshman year, after
half a season on the junior varsi
ty, Hallock was moved up to the
varsity team, where she quickly
asserted herself. Following her
sophomore year, Hallock started
thinking about the possibility of
playing field hockey "in college
somewhere."
But it gets better. After her
junior year, Hallock was invited
to the Olympic developmental C
camp. She was also chosen to be
on a San Diego select team that
travelled to Australia to play
national teams there. Then, after
returning from Down Under, she
played in the Junior Olympics.
Following her senior year, Hal
lock played on the U.S. develop
mental B-squad. And then she
matriculated.
Many schools, including Har
vard, Ohio, and Boston Universi
ty tried to woo Hallock their way,
but they didn't stand a chance.
"None of the schools offered the
academics [that Stanford didj.
And I wanted to stay in Califor
nia," Hallock, a human biology
major, said. "Actually, I always
wanted to go to Stanford."
And that's a good thing for
Stanford. In her ffreshman year
last year, Hallock led the Cardinal
in scoring with 11 goals in 15
games, and made the All-Nor-Pac
team. After the season she was
invited to play on the U.S. devel
opmental A-squad. Her game just
seems to keep improving every
year.
And that is also a good thing
for Stanford, who will be facing
some stiff competition very short
ly. They will most likey meet
either No. 7 Northwestern or No.
4 lowa at NCAAs, and will need
all the firepower they can get.

"We are looking forward to a
strong finish [to the regualar
season], but we need to make
sure we keep progressing, like
we have been all season," John
son said. "In order to do that,
Sara and everybody else will
have to be sure to take the next
step."
But they can be sure that
Hallock will be whacking away,
just as she's always done.
"I need to be sure and concen

have some real tough games
coming up," Hallock said.
And if she's going to be concen

Sophomore Sara Hallock walks tall and carries a big stick. The field
hockey forward has 15 goals this season and hopes to continue fir
ing away at opponents' defenses in the Nor-Pac finals
"We are looking forward to a
strong finish [to the regualar
season], but we need to make
sure we keep progressing, like
we have been all season," John
son said. "In order to do that,
Sara and everybody else will
have to be sure to take the next
step."
But they can be sure that
Hallock will be whacking away,
just as she's always done.
"I need to be sure and concen
trate on my play. We're gonna
have some real tough games
coming up," Hallock said.
And if she's going to be concen
trating to do even better, enemy
NCAA defenses look out.
i SMACK!
' The defender abandons all
hope of stopping the small white
field hockey ball, and instead tries
desperately to get out of the way.
WHACK!
' The opposing goalkeeper can
only but watch as yet another ball
whizzes by at an absurd velocity.
What exactly is the origin of
the ball's high speed and short
lived travel? Or, rather, who?
They call her Ice.
, "Everyone on the team gets a
vegetable for a nickname. I'm Ice
berg Lettuce. Ice for short," said
sophomore forward Sara Hallock.
And, boy, can she ever ice the ball.
"I guess I've always hit hard,
ever since high school," Hallock
said. And this ball abuse has
translated into some high speed
results as well. Hallock leads a
team that is 9-3-1, a team that is
a cinch to win its second straight
Northern-Pacific Conference title,
and a team that will, for the sec
ond consecutive year, head east
ffcr the NCAA Tournament.
• Stanford may not know it, but
it has a dominant player on its
roster. On a team that is ranked
No. 20 nationally, Stanford field
hockey's Hallock may very possi
bly be among the country's best.
The Cardinal field hockey team
is a very tightly knit group, and
the team-oriented attitude trans
lates clearly onto the field. The
offense works together as a unit,
passing the ball effectively and

selflessly. Other players such as
junior assists leader Chris Trevi
no and senior captain Susan
Leckrone embody this team men
tality. But someone has to put the
ball into the goal, and that some
one has been Hallock — in a big
way.
"She is definitely the biggest
scorer we've had in a long time,"
said coach Sheryl Johnson. "Sara
is doing a great job for us."

Is she ever. "Ice" leads Stan
ford with 15 goals, and provides a
large portion of the Cardinal's
offensive punch. Stanford has
outscored its opponents 26 to 16
this season, and simple arith
metic shows how valuable Hal
lock's knack for scoring has been.
And she can absolutely nail the
ball.
"Sara is a very strong girl,"
Johnson said. "She is so effective.

She has such a good shot that the
defense can't react in time."
This knack was originally
found in high school where she
had 102 career goals, including 50
goals her senior year. (Those are
not typos.) And this knack could
very easily never have been dis
covered.
"Before high school, I had
never heard of [field hockey],"
Hallock said. "But I was looking
for something tj> play the season
before soccer, anda friend of mine
suggested I try field hockey. So I
did."
In her freshman year, after
half a season on the junior varsi
ty, Hallock was moved up to the
varsity team, where she quickly
asserted herself. Following her
sophomore year, Hallock started
thinking about the possibility of
playing field hockey "in college
somewhere."
But it gets better. After her
junior year, Hallock was invited
to the Olympic developmental C
camp. She was also chosen to be
on a San Diego select team that
travelled to Australia to play
national teams there. Then, after
returning from Down Under, she
played in the Junior Olympics.
Following her senior year, Hal
lock played on the U.S. develop
mental B-squad. And then she
matriculated.
Many schools, including Har
vard, Ohio, and Boston Universi
ty tried to woo Hallock their way,
but they didn't stand a chance.
"None of the schools offered the
academics [that Stanford didj.
And I wanted to stay in Califor
nia," Hallock, a human biology
major, said. "Actually, I always
wanted to go to Stanford."
And that's a good thing for
Stanford. In her ffreshman year
last year, Hallock led the Cardinal
in scoring with 11 goals in 15
games, and made the All-Nor-Pac
team. After the season she was
invited to play on the U.S. devel
opmental A-squad. Her game just
seems to keep improving every
year.
And that is also a good thing
for Stanford, who will be facing
some stiff competition very short
ly. They will most likey meet
either No. 7 Northwestern or No.
4 lowa at NCAAs, and will need
all the firepower they can get.
