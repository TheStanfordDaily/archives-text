# Field hockey playoffs
## 
### 
TUESDAY — vs. California 3:30
p.m. at varsity field, behind intra
mural fields. This game is
dependent on a Bears loss to
Pacific this weekend.
NOTES — UOP plays Cal for the
right to face the Cardinal (9-3-1)
in the Nor-Pac conference finals.
If UOP wins, The Cardinal will
face the Tigers in the conference
final Nov. 9, here at 11:00 a.m.
Because Cal would need one
more game to be eligible for
postseason play, Stanford would
take on the Bears Tuesday at
3:30 p.m. If Cal beats UOP, the
Tuesday game would not be
necessary, and the Cardinal
would face the Bears in the con
ference final Nov. 9.
