# Bewitching hooters bury USF

### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
For a while in the second
half, the University of San
Francisco-Stanford soccer game
resembled a battle zone. By the
time the smoke cleared, howev
er, the Dons had absorbed all of
the serious wounds as the Cardi
nal emerged victorious by the
score of 4-0.
The first half went relatively
smoothly, with Stanford's
Denise Denney scoring the lone

Cardinal 4
Dons 0

goal of the period off an assist
from junior Jen Potok. The goal,
a brilliant shot from a mile
away, was one of the prettiest of
a season laden with picture-per
fect scores.
"Denise Denney . . . Wow!
What a goal," freshman fullback

Kristen Wair said. "She shot it
from about thirty yards out to
the far post. .. their goalkeeper
had no chance."
It was in the second half that
things got a little strange. After
the stadium lights went out and
delayed the game for over 10
minutes, a smoke bomb went ofT
in Negoesco Stadium, further
obstructing the Cardinal's
relentless pursuit of yet another
crushing victory.
When the game resumed, fresh
man Andrea Johnson scored the
first of two goals. The forward
now has seven goals on the sea
son, with two assists.
Denney then scored her sec
ond goal of the night off an assist
from sophomore Sarah Rafanelli.
The goal was Denney's fourth of
the season.
Johnson then put another ball
into the Don net to secure the vic
tory.
"Everything started coming
together after about 20 or 30
minutes," freshman fullback
Laura Wilkes said. "We put on
continuous pressure and it ended
up in some goals."
Although the contest was
never expected to be anything but
a one-sided Cardinal victory,
coach Berhane Andeberhan
wanted to make sure that the
playoff-bound Stanford team
would not treat the contest lack
adaisically.
"Berhane told us that we need-

Ed to concentrate on having an
airtight defense, as we would in
the playoffs," junior fullback
Leni Nonoshita said. "Winning
starts from defense."
It sure does with the 1991 Car
dinal team, which has now blanked
13 of 16 opponents and allowed a
scant four goals all season long.
The win over USF was the Cardi
nal's 15th of the season, equaling
the team high set last year.
Although the team is obvious
ly hitting on all cylinders and
more than ready to take on the
NCAA's best in the playoffs, the
team heads into its regular-sea
son finale still looking to improve
itself.
In the Northern Colorado
game. "We need to get the little
things that are wrong fixed,"
Wair said, and then went on to
discuss the team's need to
refrain from getting too far
ahead of itself. "The playoffs are
big time, but we still have one
more game before then," she
said.
That one more game will be
held Saturday at Harry Maloney
Field at 11:30 a.m.
