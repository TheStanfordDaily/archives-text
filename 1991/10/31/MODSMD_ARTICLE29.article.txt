Did someone say bowl
game?
Sherlock Homes notebook in
hand, I sneak stealthily
through the athletic depart
ment, searching for the source
of the bowl game rumors.
Stanford is 4-3, 2-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, and
looking to play in a bowl game,
any bowl game, even the
Poulan Weed-Eater Bowl in
Shreveport, La.

But asking about a Stanford
bowl bid is like asking Mario
Cuomo if he's running for Pres
ident. Coaches answer in gar
bled parables, or spit out clich
es they learned in Coaching
101: Cookie-Cutter Quotes.
"It's too early to talk about
bowls. We have to take things
one game at a time. You're
putting the cart before the
horse. Look before you leap.
That's the way the Mercedes-
Benz."
If you talk to players and
coaches on the Stanford foot
ball team, they'll tell you
they're thinking about every
thing except a bowl game. A
reporter can't get any straight
answers, even when he's mak
ing them up.
"Did you say bowling?"
Denny Green might respond.
"Nah, I don't have time for a
bowling league until the spring;
this darn football coaching
takes too much time."
I saunter past Green and
into the inner recesses of the
locker room, hoping to over
hear some bowl chatter.
"Did you see the new Flag
man and his four fantastic
Flagboy followers at the Ore
gon State game?" rambles one
linebacker. "Boy those guys
really were pumped for the
game. Do you think any of

them could punt for us?"
"Yeah, I'll say," responds
another. "And maybe we could
get Palumbis to twirl a baton
for them."
In another corner, players
are talking about their postsea
son aspirations. "I can't wait
until Big Game is done so I can
tune up my moped."
But these football players
are clever and won't reveal the
bowl game secrets. They must
be speaking in codes I can't
understand, using key words
like "sleep, I'm going home for
Christmas, Doogie Howzer is a
stud," and "Pass me the War
and Peace Cliffs Notes," to
stand for Aloha, Copper, Inde
pendence and Freedom Bowl.
Clearly, Stanford is pulling a
Ronald Reagan with this bowl
thing. Ignore it, and it just isn't
there. But I knew the bowl
rumors were not myth, so I
called the friendly folks at the
Freedom Bowl, who scouted
Stanford's 40-10 tailgating of
Oregon State. Finally, my sus
picions were confirmed.
"Stanford is high on our list
of teams," agreed Freedom
Bowl representative Rob Hal
vaks. "Of course, the game that
we will be looking at very close
ly is against UCLA."
The Freedom Bowl, played
in Anaheim on Monday, Dec.
30, is the most likely postsea
son destination for Stanford,
although the Aloha and Copper
Bowls are possible. Stanford
must win three of its final four
games to receive a bid, which
can go out as soon as Nov. 17.
"Stanford hasn't been to a
bowl game in a number of years
and has strong Southern Cali
fornia alumni support," contin
ued Halvaks, whose bowl con
tributes up to $850,000 to the
competing teams. "Certainly it
would be a step up for their pro
gram. We don't want the Free
dom Bowl to be just a consola
tion game for someone."
"We're looking for one
school to be a California Pac-10
team, and the other a runner
up from the WAC (Western
Athletic Conference) or the Big
8," he said.

Cousins
Although no one at Stanford
likes to talk about it, Stanford still
has a good shot at a bowl game.
Stanford plays its two toughest
opponents at home; Oregon is crip
pled by injuries, and the Cardinal
crushed Washington State 31-13
last year.
Stanford must take things one
game at a time and score more points
than the other team. But Denny's
right even if he won't say it: we're
going bowling.

Nat Cousins flunked calculus,
but to him scoring bowling seems
pretty simple.
