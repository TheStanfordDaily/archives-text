# Responding to the threat of AIDS
## Campus groups try to stop spread of deadly disease 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Twenty-six Stanford students are carrying
the AIDS virus and you may be one of them.
Although the initial furor over AIDS may
have subsided, the epidemic continues to spread
— including at Stanford. According to a recent
nationwide study sponsored by the American
College Health Association, one in 500 college
students is HIV-positive — and that number is
steadily increasing. HIV, the human immuno
deficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS.
But through prevention, counseling and
treatment, several campus groups are working
to counteract the nation's deadly trend.
According to Harvey Weinstein, director of
Cowell Student Health Center, the University
has made "a solid commitment to providing
overall service for HIV-positive students."
Students who are HIV-positive or those
who have full cases of acquired immune defi
ciency syndrome can receive support from a
number of University sources, including Cow
ell, Counseling and Psychological Services,
AIDS peer counseling groups and Ye Olde
Safer Sex Shoppe.
Cowell, in addition to primary care and
counseling, offers free, confidential HIV test
ing to Stanford students. Because all Cowell
services require verification of enrollment, the
test is not completely anonymous. But accord
ing to Weinstein, the test results are not
included in students' medical records — in
fact, they are destroyed.
As part of their "solid commitment," Wein
stein said, Cowell's staff receives periodic training
in AIDS awareness, and the center recently
increased health insurance coverage by $2,000
per student to include primary care costs for HIV.
In November, the Stanford AIDS task force
will meet to finalize a comprehensive plan for
AIDS education and treatment on campus.
The task force consists of a "broad spectrum"
of representatives from the faculty, staff and
student body, according to Virginia Gonzalez,"
who will co-chair the task force with John Dor
man, director of public relations at Cowell.
Gonzalez is currently an interim consultant
for Cowell's Health Promotion Program,
which coordinates classes in sexual health as

well as areas including alcohol
management. Unlike its clinical
counterpart, the program is
responsible for disease prevention,
rather than treatment.

"What we're trying to do
is prevent treatment," she
explained. "We're not only
training students to protect
themselves, but also giving
them opportunities to edu
cate their peers."
AIDS education is key
Gonzalez, Weinstein and
CAPS Director Alejandro
Martinez agree that the
best form of AIDS preven
tion is AIDS education.
"Each year, Stanford
gets thousands of new stu
dents, and each year we
need to make sure that
those students have at least
the basic information about
AIDS and HIV," Martinez
said. "We need to encourage
students to take proactive
approaches to protecting
themselves — not from sex
or intimacy, but from
AIDS."
According to Weinstein,
Cowell is currently treating
"a handful" of HIV-positive

students. Because many students
go off-campus for HIV testing and
treatment, the precise number of
students with AIDS is uncertain,
but it is estimated that the statis
tics roughly parallel national aver
ages.
Martinez, who counsels HlV
positive students at Stanford,
cited adequate insurance, secure
housing and academic flexibility
as the major needs of students liv
ing with HIV — needs which the
University administration has
actively sought to fulfill. But Mar
tinez said the most important
need is sensitivity.
"We can't isolate individuals

out of fear and ignorance," he
said. "People with AIDS are mem
bers of our community and will
continue to be members of our
community."
Advocating condom use
Since 1986, Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe has been Stanford's unof

ficial condom capital, marketing a
vast and colorful array of con
doms and lubricants to students
of all shapes, sizes and sexes.
But, "We're really not concerned
with contraception," said sopho
more Rachel Maddow, who has
worked at the ASSU-sponsored
Shoppe since last year. "We don't
sell sponges or diaphragms
or pills. We're basically here
to educate people on how to
prevent HIV. Any other
byproducts are just that —
byproducts."
Shoppe Personnel Coor
dinator Lucas Romero, a
senior, said, "We are specif
ically focused on stopping
the spread of AIDS."
"We are trying to teach
people not to be coerced —
to have the freedom to say,
'I want to use a condom,' "
Romero said.
Although the Safer Sex
Shoppe refers its cus
tomers to Cowell for clini
cal and psychological ser
vices, it offers informal
pre-test counseling and
information on anonymous
HIV testing and AIDS pre
vention.
"Ours is a more peer
centered environment,"
Maddow said. "We offer
information on AIDS and
HIV, but we also talk about
sex a lot."

Cuts may take toll
Student-sponsored services
like the Safer Sex Shoppe may
become more valuable resources
as impending budget cuts force
streamlining of Cowell's services,
which include the Health Promo
tion Program, the Contraceptive
Information Center and Counsel
ing and Psychological Services.
Gonzalez hopes the task force
will address these budget issues,
as well as finalize plans for a pre-
HIV test peer-counseling pro
gram, to be sponsored by Project
S.A.V.E. a training course for
AIDS-education volunteers.

"This is where the spirit of vol
unteerism is going to have to raise
its head," Gonzalez said. "Stu
dents may not be willing to do
things for no money and no cred
it. We may have to pull on some
altruistic heartstrings."
Although the projected peer
counseling program will require
extra space and qualified staffers,
it is expected to fill a critical void
in Stanford's AIDS awareness
services, as well as take referrals

from the Safer Sex Shoppe, CAPS
and The Bridge.
Cowell currently refers stu
dents to CAPS for professional,
one-on-one counseling regarding
HIV. According to Martinez, HIV
counseling is "free and absolutely
confidential, as is any counseling
we do at CAPS."
CAPS also offers advice on
stress management, sexuality and
overcoming depression, which
Martinez sees as an avenue to

AIDS awareness.
"A lot of people come in with
concerns about intimacy and sex
uality, and those are good oppor
tunities to talk to them about
HIV," he said. "But students will
often come to us with questions
about HIV after they've engaged
in behavior that concerns them.
I'm glad they're able to come in
and talk about it, but we really
need to see them before they take
that risk."

doms and lubricants to students

But, "We're really not concerned
with contraception," said sopho
more Rachel Maddow, who has
worked at the ASSU-sponsored
Shoppe since last year. "We don't
sell sponges or diaphragms
or pills. We're basically here
to educate people on how to
prevent HIV. Any other
byproducts are just that —
byproducts."
Shoppe Personnel Coor
dinator Lucas Romero, a
senior, said, "We are specif
ically focused on stopping
the spread of AIDS."
"We are trying to teach
people not to be coerced —
to have the freedom to say,
'I want to use a condom,' "
Romero said.
Although the Safer Sex
Shoppe refers its cus
tomers to Cowell for clini
cal and psychological ser
vices, it offers informal
pre-test counseling and
information on anonymous
HIV testing and AIDS pre
vention.
"Ours is a more peer
centered environment,"
Maddow said. "We offer
information on AIDS and
HIV, but we also talk about
sex a lot."

Cuts may take toll
Student-sponsored services
like the Safer Sex Shoppe may
become more valuable resources
as impending budget cuts force
streamlining of Cowell's services,
which include the Health Promo
tion Program, the Contraceptive
Information Center and Counsel
ing and Psychological Services.
Gonzalez hopes the task force
will address these budget issues,
as well as finalize plans for a pre-
HIV test peer-counseling pro
gram, to be sponsored by Project
S.A.V.E. a training course for
AIDS-education volunteers.

"This is where the spirit of vol
unteerism is going to have to raise
its head," Gonzalez said. "Stu
dents may not be willing to do
things for no money and no cred
it. We may have to pull on some
altruistic heartstrings."
Although the projected peer
counseling program will require
extra space and qualified staffers,
it is expected to fill a critical void
in Stanford's AIDS awareness
services, as well as take referrals

from the Safer Sex Shoppe, CAPS
and The Bridge.
Cowell currently refers stu
dents to CAPS for professional,
one-on-one counseling regarding
HIV. According to Martinez, HIV
counseling is "free and absolutely
confidential, as is any counseling
we do at CAPS."
CAPS also offers advice on
stress management, sexuality and
overcoming depression, which
Martinez sees as an avenue to

AIDS awareness.
"A lot of people come in with
concerns about intimacy and sex
uality, and those are good oppor
tunities to talk to them about
HIV," he said. "But students will
often come to us with questions
about HIV after they've engaged
in behavior that concerns them.
I'm glad they're able to come in
and talk about it, but we really
need to see them before they take
that risk."
Twenty-six Stanford students are carrying
the AIDS virus and you may be one of them.
Although the initial furor over AIDS may
have subsided, the epidemic continues to spread
— including at Stanford. According to a recent
nationwide study sponsored by the American
College Health Association, one in 500 college
students is HIV-positive — and that number is
steadily increasing. HIV, the human immuno
deficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS.
But through prevention, counseling and
treatment, several campus groups are working
to counteract the nation's deadly trend.
According to Harvey Weinstein, director of
Cowell Student Health Center, the University
has made "a solid commitment to providing
overall service for HIV-positive students."
Students who are HIV-positive or those
who have full cases of acquired immune defi
ciency syndrome can receive support from a
number of University sources, including Cow
ell, Counseling and Psychological Services,
AIDS peer counseling groups and Ye Olde
Safer Sex Shoppe.
Cowell, in addition to primary care and
counseling, offers free, confidential HIV test
ing to Stanford students. Because all Cowell
services require verification of enrollment, the
test is not completely anonymous. But accord
ing to Weinstein, the test results are not
included in students' medical records — in
fact, they are destroyed.
As part of their "solid commitment," Wein
stein said, Cowell's staff receives periodic training
in AIDS awareness, and the center recently
increased health insurance coverage by $2,000
per student to include primary care costs for HIV.
In November, the Stanford AIDS task force
will meet to finalize a comprehensive plan for
AIDS education and treatment on campus.
The task force consists of a "broad spectrum"
of representatives from the faculty, staff and
student body, according to Virginia Gonzalez,"
who will co-chair the task force with John Dor
man, director of public relations at Cowell.
Gonzalez is currently an interim consultant
for Cowell's Health Promotion Program,
which coordinates classes in sexual health as

well as areas including alcohol
management. Unlike its clinical
counterpart, the program is
responsible for disease prevention,
rather than treatment.

"What we're trying to do
is prevent treatment," she
explained. "We're not only
training students to protect
themselves, but also giving
them opportunities to edu
cate their peers."
AIDS education is key
Gonzalez, Weinstein and
CAPS Director Alejandro
Martinez agree that the
best form of AIDS preven
tion is AIDS education.
"Each year, Stanford
gets thousands of new stu
dents, and each year we
need to make sure that
those students have at least
the basic information about
AIDS and HIV," Martinez
said. "We need to encourage
students to take proactive
approaches to protecting
themselves — not from sex
or intimacy, but from
AIDS."
According to Weinstein,
Cowell is currently treating
"a handful" of HIV-positive

students. Because many students
go off-campus for HIV testing and
treatment, the precise number of
students with AIDS is uncertain,
but it is estimated that the statis
tics roughly parallel national aver
ages.
Martinez, who counsels HlV
positive students at Stanford,
cited adequate insurance, secure
housing and academic flexibility
as the major needs of students liv
ing with HIV — needs which the
University administration has
actively sought to fulfill. But Mar
tinez said the most important
need is sensitivity.
"We can't isolate individuals

out of fear and ignorance," he
said. "People with AIDS are mem
bers of our community and will
continue to be members of our
community."
Advocating condom use

Shoppe has been Stanford's unof

ficial condom capital, marketing a
vast and colorful array of con
doms and lubricants to students
of all shapes, sizes and sexes.
