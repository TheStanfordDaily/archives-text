# Responding to the threat of AIDS
## Campus groups try to stop spread of deadly disease 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Twenty-six Stanford students are carrying
the AIDS virus and you may be one of them.
Although the initial furor over AIDS may
have subsided, the epidemic continues to spread
— including at Stanford. According to a recent
nationwide study sponsored by the American
College Health Association, one in 500 college
students is HIV-positive — and that number is
steadily increasing. HIV, the human immuno
deficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS.
But through prevention, counseling and
treatment, several campus groups are working
to counteract the nation's deadly trend.
According to Harvey Weinstein, director of
Cowell Student Health Center, the University
has made "a solid commitment to providing
overall service for HIV-positive students."
Students who are HIV-positive or those
who have full cases of acquired immune defi
ciency syndrome can receive support from a
number of University sources, including Cow
ell, Counseling and Psychological Services,
AIDS peer counseling groups and Ye Olde
Safer Sex Shoppe.
Cowell, in addition to primary care and
counseling, offers free, confidential HIV test
ing to Stanford students. Because all Cowell
services require verification of enrollment, the
test is not completely anonymous. But accord
ing to Weinstein, the test results are not
included in students' medical records — in
fact, they are destroyed.
As part of their "solid commitment," Wein
stein said, Cowell's staff receives periodic training
in AIDS awareness, and the center recently
increased health insurance coverage by $2,000
per student to include primary care costs for HIV.
In November, the Stanford AIDS task force
will meet to finalize a comprehensive plan for
AIDS education and treatment on campus.
The task force consists of a "broad spectrum"
of representatives from the faculty, staff and
student body, according to Virginia Gonzalez,"
who will co-chair the task force with John Dor
man, director of public relations at Cowell.
Gonzalez is currently an interim consultant
for Cowell's Health Promotion Program,
which coordinates classes in sexual health as

to teach people not to be coerced — to have the freedom to say, 'I want to use a con
dom,' " Romero said.
