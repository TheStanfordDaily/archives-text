# Dons and stadium self-destruct

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
On a strange, cold Mischief Night at Negoesco
Stadium, the Stanford men's soccer team pulled a
few tricks of their own en route to a huge 3-2 victo
ry over the University of San Francisco.
The game was highlighted by a malfunction in
the USF sprinkler system late in the second half
which halted play for nearly an hour. The men were
not the only ones affected by unusual conditions on
the night: the women's game immediately preceding
the men's contest had been victimized by both
smoke bombs and a shutdown of the stadium's
lighting system.
After being plagued by bad luck in last weekend's
loss to UCLA and tie at San Diego State, Stanford's

fortunes changed for the better against USF.
Although the Cardinal dominated the action in the
first half, keeping the ball on the Dons' side of the
field for almost the entire period, its misleading 3-0
halftime lead was padded by two unusual scores.
Midway through the period, Stanford forward
Lance Killian drilled a shot from the left side of the
net. The ball deflected off lunging USF goalie Scott
Thompson, and onto the foot of
Cardinal midfielder Ricky Goad,
who connected for his second
goal of the season.
Stanford scored another
"fluke" goal in similar fashion.
With six minutes remaining in
the first half, the squad lined up
for a free kick from the left side
of the field. Midfielder Randy
Mann drilled his kick towards
the mouth of the goal, and as the
ball bounced around the goal
line, it deflected off of a Don and
into the net.
The Cardinal's only conven
tional score was sandwiched in
between its two deflection goals.

Freshman Ryan Collins drove
uncontested into the penalty box,
forcing Thompson to commit.
The Stanford forward quickly
crossed to Killian, who tapped in
a score from close range.
With his fourth goal of the sea
son, Killian continued his recent
resurgence. The junior forward
has rebounded from a sluggish
early season showing to tally
three goals in his last five games.
USF fought back in the second
half. Twelve minutes into the
period, the Dons' Staale Soeybe
(one of the club's four Norwegian
players) turned and passed to
teammate Todd Iverson, who
brought the score to 3-1 with a
pretty shot from 15 yards.
Minutes after the 50-minute
sprinkler delay, the Dons pulled
to within one. Angelo Sablo took

a cross pass from Zach Taylor
and booted it into the right side
of the goal with less than 12 min
utes remaining in the game. But
that was as close as USF would
get. At 10:30 p.m., three hours
after the match's scheduled
starting time, the final gun
sounded.
The win over the sixth-ranked
Dons (15-3) is without a doubt
the biggest of the season for the
Cardinal (10-3-5) thus far. It is
also one of the most opportune.
Next week, NCAA Tournament
at-large selections will be made,
an honor that Stanford has not
received since 1978.
While the No. 30 Cardinal has
been on the tournament bubble for
almost the entire season, last
night's victory might be enough to
push the club into the event.
