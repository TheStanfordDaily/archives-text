# Kimball residents seek to forge a tradition of their own

Mahal." "Palace." "Hotel."
Envious students who didn't
have the luck to draw into Kim
ball Hall have a variety of nick
names for the new dormitory. But
to Kimball's 199 residents it has
grown into something more than
Stanford's "four-star" dormitory.
A sense of excitement and
pride permeates the pristine halls
as residents strive to create their
own style and traditions. "Our
theme is The New Dorm," sopho
more John Gaus said. "We want
to be leading (other dormitories)
in conservation of water, intra
murals and recycling."
Kimball was officially dedicat
ed in a ceremony this week.
Unlike other four-class dormi
tories, Kimball "houses as much
energy in its upperclass as in its
frosh residents," said Claudine
Gay, a second-floor resident assis
tant. "That's unusual."
"We're hoping to go camping
and hiking, maybe in the Sierras
and Yosemite within the next
month," Gay said. "The residents
are interested in hiking, skiing
and action trips."
Other residents see a different
trend in the halls of Kimball. "I
see a music tradition," said Albert
Liu, a sophomore whose room
mate drew 71 in last spring's

Draw. At least four a cappella
groups are represented in Kim
ball, and residents say they want
to do a dorm musical this quarter.
"There are so many musicians
in this dorm, it's amazing,"
screamed freshman Robin Jones,
standing next to the dorm's baby
grand piano as dormmate Dylan
Pollard crooned Elton John's
"The Greatest Discovery."
Perhaps the Friday night
movies at Kimball will be the dor
mitory's claim to fame. The
movies, shown every Friday
night, are called "Friday Night
Soup."
"There's a thought-provoking
film first symbolizing the meat in
the soup, then an artsy film sym
bolizing the potatoes in the soup
and lastly there is a light film
symbolizing dessert," junior
Robby Mockler said. "Winnie the
Pooh" was dessert one week, he
added.
Kimball also has several new
accessibility features for disabled
students. For instance, the doors
to each room have handles as
opposed to door knobs, and the
showers are equipped with seats.
In addition, to allow increased
wheel-chair mobility in and out of
rooms, the doorways are wider
than the traditional dorm door
way. The first-floor lounges, along
with the computer cluster, are

also more spacious than normal.
However, many disabled stu
dents who live in Kimball are
angry that they don't have access
to the second and third floors.
University administrators have
said they considered installing an
elevator but decided the estimat
ed $150,000 to $200,000 cost was
not affordable, and added that the
installation would have delayed
the opening of the dormitory.
Color and exterior design are the
only two aspects of this three-story,
sandstone, stuccoed dorm that

resemble other campus residences.
Unlike most older dorms, each
floor in Kimball is equipped with
large lounges, a living room, a
recycling room and a storage room.
The first floor contains a seminar
room, a piano room and a separate
dining hall that can be trans
formed into a performance center.
In addition, rooms are equipped
with new modular furniture, wood
framed windows and white walls.
Are the new residents of Kim
ball snobbish about their dorm?
"It's like 'We got in,' only on a

higher level," boasted sophomore
Risa Shapiro, who drew 119.
Liu said friends who did not get
into Kimball "act like it's a crime
to live in Kimball. Just because
we drew better doesn't mean they
have to be bitter."
Liu did express concerned that
fellow students living in the trailers
had to pay the same amount of
money for housing as Kimball resi
dents. He said he believes that the
housing system should be changed.
Residents deny reports of ants
in the new dormitory, and several

worried that their dortn was
receiving a bad rap. "I heard that
there are ants on the third floor,
but we (on the first floor) haven't
experienced them yet," Liu said.
Third floor residents categorically
denied that there were any ants
on their floor.
For sophomore Veronica de la
Cruz, Kimball "is not as lively as
Zapata (her old residence), but
the rooms are a lot newer."
Exactly what the new dorm
tradition will be is not yet known;
however, according to Liu, "We're
Mahal." "Palace." "Hotel."
