# 'Shantytown' vs. 'hotel': Jealousy lives
## 
### Matti Bunzl Staff Writer 
That green-eyed monster is getting to the
students confined to Wilbur Hall and the
creaky trailers in Manzanita Park.
Everyone has heard about Kimball Hall's
luxury: the gourmet food, the great rooms,
the spacious study lounges. And the stu
dents in less posh dormitories are jealous of
the "hotel" on the other side of the street.
Sophomore Allen Dannen, a resident of Ce
dro, bemoaned his luck in drawing into Wilbur.
"Comparing Wilbur to Kimball is like com
paring sweaty underwear to a tuxedo," he said.

John Chow, another Cedro resident,
shares these sentiments. "Kimball gets you
bitter," he said, adding, "It's kind of unfair
to place Kimball right on the other side of
the street from Wilbur."
Chow, a sophomore, said he went over to
Kimball to find out how great it really was.
"Their freaking bathroom stalls are bigger
than my roam," he said. Chow said he was
also perplexed by Kimball's "exquisitely
carved furniture."
Sophomore Jeff Wozniak, a resident of Man
zanita, said he isn't thrilled with his living situ
ation either. "Places like Manzanita shouldn't
exist," he said. "It's like a shantytown."

Instead of building new dorms like Kim-.
ball, he said, "improvements need to be
made in other dorms." Wozniak said he
objects to "giving a select group of people so
many advantages."
Sophomore Allison Axtell said Kimball
was her first choice in the draw. Now a resi
dent of Manzanita, she said she misses the
"dorm experience."
"The trailers are really anti-social," she
said, "We are so separated."
At first, Axtell said, she was really envi
ous of the Kimball residents. "But when I
heard about the ants in Kimball — I was
really happy."
