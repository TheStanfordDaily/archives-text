						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Don't Go Europe 
### 
DON'T GO! DON'T GO TO Europe! Stay at
home! It's just a bunch of old churches sur
rounded by gawking Americans anyway. And
the residents? Stuck-up has-beens who don't matter
in the world anymore. How can you tell? Just ask one
of them: "You're a peon?"
And they'll say, "Why yes, I am." Either that or
they'll ignore you because you're speaking the lan
guage of barbarians.
But if you do go, don't hitchhike.
For one, you'll never make it over there that way.
For two, hitching in Europe is a nasty experience.

For three, was the final score, in games, of the World
Series.
In the United States, hitchhiking is a much sim
pler process. You find a nice highway, stick out your
thumb, get in the first car that stops and wind up
mangled and battered in a backwoods ditch three
states over. Simple.
In America, if you hitchhike, you're either crazy or
stupid. If you pick up hitchhikers, you're either crazy
or stupid. If either person is crazy, the ride gets
aborted at the first deserted stretch of highway. So
the only time hitchhiking actually might work is
when two stupid people ride with each other, in
which case they'll probably get lost or forget where
they were going anyway.
Hitchhiking is most popular in the Midwest. Go
figure.
But in Europe, hitchhiking is a whole ritual. First,
you gotta look good. No one's gonna pick you up if
you look crazy â€” unless, of course, there's a really
lost Midwesterner tooling around your area. Entirely
possible, but who wants to ride across Europe in a
beat-up Chevy pick-up truck?
Second, the hand signals are more complex. In
America, it's a relatively easy system: Hold up your
thumb as a car approaches, and your middle finger as
it recedes. But in Poland, for example, you stick out
your entire hand like you're trying to give the car a
high five. (One encounters a disproportionate num
ber of hitchhikers with broken arms in Poland.) In
Romania, you wave a pack of Marlboro's. In
Yugoslavia, you shoot the windshield.
But in subdued, efficient Germany, you just hold
out a cute little piece of cardboard with the initial of
the city you want to get to. Quaint.
One afternoon last spring, I was in romantic
Frankfurt, Germany, and needed to get across the
country to Berlin in time to sleep through class early
the nejrt morning.
I had 14 hours, no money and the side from an old
cardboard box of broken applesauce jars I'd picked
out of a dumpster. I had the itch to hitch, honey.
I knew hitching in Europe was a delicate opera
tion. And when it comes to delicate operations, I'm
all thumbs. Thus I thought I'd be a phenomenal
hitchhiker.
But my big mistake was the cardboard sign.
Instead of just writing a black "B" like any other
motor-moocher would, I tried to compose a minor
novel on my piece of cardboard: "BERLIN: or as far
as possible." I spent half an hour on that sign, care
fully measuring out the spaces between letters, fill-
