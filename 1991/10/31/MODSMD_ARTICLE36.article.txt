# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Don't Go Europe 
### 
DON'T GO! DON'T GO TO Europe! Stay at
home! It's just a bunch of old churches sur
rounded by gawking Americans anyway. And
the residents? Stuck-up has-beens who don't matter
in the world anymore. How can you tell? Just ask one
of them: "You're a peon?"
And they'll say, "Why yes, I am." Either that or
they'll ignore you because you're speaking the lan
guage of barbarians.
But if you do go, don't hitchhike.
For one, you'll never make it over there that way.
For two, hitching in Europe is a nasty experience.

For three, was the final score, in games, of the World
Series.
In the United States, hitchhiking is a much sim
pler process. You find a nice highway, stick out your
thumb, get in the first car that stops and wind up
mangled and battered in a backwoods ditch three
states over. Simple.
In America, if you hitchhike, you're either crazy or
stupid. If you pick up hitchhikers, you're either crazy
or stupid. If either person is crazy, the ride gets
aborted at the first deserted stretch of highway. So
the only time hitchhiking actually might work is
when two stupid people ride with each other, in
which case they'll probably get lost or forget where
they were going anyway.
Hitchhiking is most popular in the Midwest. Go
figure.
But in Europe, hitchhiking is a whole ritual. First,
you gotta look good. No one's gonna pick you up if
you look crazy — unless, of course, there's a really
lost Midwesterner tooling around your area. Entirely
possible, but who wants to ride across Europe in a
beat-up Chevy pick-up truck?
Second, the hand signals are more complex. In
America, it's a relatively easy system: Hold up your
thumb as a car approaches, and your middle finger as
it recedes. But in Poland, for example, you stick out
your entire hand like you're trying to give the car a
high five. (One encounters a disproportionate num
ber of hitchhikers with broken arms in Poland.) In
Romania, you wave a pack of Marlboro's. In
Yugoslavia, you shoot the windshield.
But in subdued, efficient Germany, you just hold
out a cute little piece of cardboard with the initial of
the city you want to get to. Quaint.
One afternoon last spring, I was in romantic
Frankfurt, Germany, and needed to get across the
country to Berlin in time to sleep through class early
the nejrt morning.
I had 14 hours, no money and the side from an old
cardboard box of broken applesauce jars I'd picked
out of a dumpster. I had the itch to hitch, honey.
I knew hitching in Europe was a delicate opera
tion. And when it comes to delicate operations, I'm
all thumbs. Thus I thought I'd be a phenomenal
hitchhiker.
But my big mistake was the cardboard sign.
Instead of just writing a black "B" like any other
motor-moocher would, I tried to compose a minor
novel on my piece of cardboard: "BERLIN: or as far
as possible." I spent half an hour on that sign, care
fully measuring out the spaces between letters, fill-

ing in penciled outlines with calli
graphic flourishes, licking the old
applesauce off my magic marker.
But in the end, thanks to my
immense German skills, I wrote
something like, "BERLIN: or how
far so possible" on the cardboard.
It means as little in their lan
guage as it does in ours. But I was
clueless. Me and my stupid sign
walked down to the highway
entrance and started our work.
This was it. I was really hitch
hiking, completely violating
everything my mother had ever
told me about strange cars and
free candy. I hadn't felt this rebel
lious since I'd danced to Twisted
Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take
It" back in ninth grade. I was on
the road with a backpack, just like
Bill Bixby at the end of an Incred
ible Hulk show, except no one was
whistling that silly little dirge in
my ear.
(Jeez, did that last paragraph
seem like Joel Stein's writing or
what? Damn, that scares me.
Soon I'll be talking about my
masculinity and codpieces and
how much I don't need those
women who dumped me anyway.)
I stood out there for two hours,
holding up my stupid sign for
every passing supremacist Ger
man to laugh at. They all twisted
up their faces as they went; I
scoffed, assuming it was because
they couldn't believe the sight of
such a rebellious, Dylanesque
dude as me actually hitchhiking
on their Autobahn; really it was
because they couldn't figure out
what the hell my sign said.
They probably thought I was
from the Midwest.
Finally, a beat-up van pulled
over to let me in. I ran up, opened
the passenger door and froze as
some huge, wild-gray-haired, 50-
year-old woman sized me up with
big, vulture-like eyes. Oh, jeez, I
thought. Large Marge. I'm get
ting a ride with a Pee-Wee Her
man character.
Even worse, before I'd even
gotten in, she snapped at me in
German, "You shouldn't hitch
hike. It's dangerous." Great.
She's my mom, too. I almost
replied, "Well, you shouldn't pick
up hitchhikers. It's just as dan
gerous." But that strategy struck
me as pretty stupid, since there
was always the chance she'd
agree with me and tell me to get
out.
She told me she was going to
some podunk town in Eastern
Germany and handed me a map
of Austria so I could locate it. This
clever little brain teaser kept me
occupied for a good 20 minutes.
Then we started to chat. Or,
she started to chat. I pretended to
listen.
In its pure form, German is
bad enough already. Besides the
fact that it sounds as beautiful as
a chain saw cutting through a
backed-up septic tank and you
need to dry yourself off with a
towel whenever anyone speaks it
to your face, the language has this
annoying habit of throwing most
of its verbs to the end of the sen
tence, so that even if you're
speaking it correctly, you still

come out sounding like an over
dubbed Yoda.
After a month's immersion in
this language, though, I'd gotten
pretty good at holding conversa
tions without understanding a
single word the other person was
saying. I'd just ask them to repeat
themselves and then listen to the
tone.
If it sounded like a fact, I said:
"Hm, that's interesting." If it
sounded like an opinion: "Yes, I
believe that also." If it seemed
they were pointing something out
to me: "Yes, I see. Very beauti
ful." And when I had absolutely
no clue whatsoever: "Yes, I
understand." Problem being,
usually they were asking me
questions. A typical moment dur
ing the ride:
"Damn, there's traffic up
ahead."
"Excuse me?"
"Traffic jam in front of us."
"Ah, yes, I see. Very beauti
ful."
"... So, where in the States
are you from?"
"Excuse me?"
"Where are you from?"
"Hm. That's interesting."
"Where?"
"Oh . . . Berlin. But just take
me how far so possible."
"No, where in the United
States do you come from?"
"Yes, that is good. Very good."
"What?"
"Yes, I understand. (Half
minute pause as I finally realize
she was asking me something)
Oh, excuse me. Connecticut."
"Ah, the East Coast! You seem
more like a Mid westerner."
"Yes, I believe that also. Very
much."
Only the fact that she under
stood my German about as well as
I understood hers saved me from
complete embarrassment.
And so the trip continued for
hours, with her talking and me
making meaningless little grunts
in between. As we crossed the for
mer East German border, she
noted that the pollution in the old
GDR is so bad, one can actually
smell the exact point at which one
enters the East. All I said was
"Yes, I understand," having
crossed down into New Jersey a
number of times.
After that, every few towns or
so, the lady pulled over at a house,
took a cardboard box out of the
back of the van, waddled up to the
front door, left the box there and
rolled herself back. Strange. I was
pretty sure those boxes didn't just
contain jars of applesauce and
was dying to ask her what she was
delivering, but I was afraid she'd
already told me. So it remains a
mystery.
Three hours and two more
rides later, I made it back to
Berlin. Just before going to bed, I
took one last look at my sign and
noticed the two-foot long gram
matical error I'd been waving at
cars all day. I'm moving to Indi
ana after I graduate.
Moral of the story, folks?
Hitchhiking was a grew-thumb
experience. Next time you've got
the itch to hitch — scratch it.

Chris Harris thinks this is one of
the worst columns he's ever writ
ten. Must have been that Stein
like part in the middle that did it.
