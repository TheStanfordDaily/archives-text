# Creepy, spooky — THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Covering six acres, connected by miles of
halls and passageways, the 160-room Winch
ester House was occupied by a single woman
and inhabited by no one but the ghosts she
built it for.
To those who question the power of the
supernatural, this sprawling mansion in San
Jose is a reminder of the shadowy forces that
can compel the human will.
Sarah Winchester, heiress to the Winch
ester rifle fortune, began building this man
sion shortly after her husband died.
A spiritual medium had told her that
William — manufacturer of the rifle that
"won the West" — had been killed by the
ghosts of the rifle's victims, mostly American
Indians and outlaws.
According to the medium, the 28-year-old
Sarah Winchester — wealthy, pretty and
alone — was next on their hit list.
She could escape their wrath, the medium
said, by building a house for the spirits — so
long as the sound of hammers rang, Sarah
Winchester would be unmolested.
So she moved to California and bought
hundreds of acres of land in what would

become Silicon Valley.
Construction began in 1884. It
continued 24 hours a day every
day for 38 years — ending when
she was found dead in one of the
mansion's 40 bedrooms.
What happened in the interim
was the creation of a monument
to human fear, physical testimo
ny to the terror that ghosts — or,
at least, the belief in ghosts —
can instill.
Sarah Winchester, following
what she claimed were the plans
given her at nightly seances,
ordered architects to follow what
must have seemed perplexing
and irrational designs.
Among other things, her direc
tions called for:
• Doors that open onto solid
walls or 30-foot drops;
• Blind chimneys that stop
just short of the ceiling;
• Posts installed upside down;
and
• A series of secret passages,
spy holes and one-way doors.
Imposed everywhere is the
number 13. There are chande
liers with 13 lights, rooms with
13 windows, windows with 13
panes.
And throughout the house is
every example of elegance and
craftsmanship that money could
buy in turn-of-the-century Amer
ica — intricate ornamental wood
work, elaborate hardwood floors
and a beautiful Tiffany stained
glass window that's on an interi
or wall and receives no sunlight
at all.
The spirits, apparently, would
have it no other way.
Considered a kind, if demand
ing, employer, Winchester was
willing to pay employees hand
somely — provided they wouldn't
talk to outsiders about her pro
ject and didn't mind working on
holidays.
Her sense of privacy was pro
found. When one construction
worker happened to see her face
unveiled, he was terminated on
the spot — with a year's sever
ance pay.
What strikes the visitor is the
confused loneliness of this
sophisticated and generous
woman, who gave lavishly to
charity and tolerated no ques
tions from her architects.
But the visitor to the Winch
ester Mystery House is assault
ed by another omnipresent fact
— capitalism at its most aggres
sive.
Mansion tours terminate at
Sarah's Gift Shoppe, a bustling

enterprise that offers everything
from rock music posters to birth
day cards.
Sarah's video game arcade —
in a renovated storage shed — is
a few yards away.
Constructing a home for
ghosts from another world,
Winchester likely didn't realize
that these capitalists would be
the mansion's haunts.
But the Winchester Mystery
House, Inc. has mastered the art
of profiting from human curiosi
ty, right down to the informa
tional literature in which they
spell "mysterious" with a capital
"M."
They've made a freak show of
human fear here in San Jose,
and, freaky though it is, there's
something sad about the lack of
dignity afforded this charitable if
eccentric woman.
Strolling through the garden,
visitors are greeted by tape
recorded voices that claim to be
the faithful but perplexed
employees of "The Lady."
A disembodied voice claiming
to be Tommy Nishawara, Winch
ester's head gardener, exclaims
in broken English, "Missus
Winchestuh love her gardens."
Another voice points out that
the crescent-shaped hedge he
used to trim points toward the
bedroom where Winchester died.
"Coincidence? Maybe," he
reflects, then reminds visitors to
stop by the gift shop on their way
out.
Predictably, Halloween is a big
time around here. Tour guides
will give flashlight tours of the
mansion tonight and conduct
trick-or-treaters through the gar
den.
Tour director Linda Paulsen
said the disembodied garden voic
es will be turned off — replaced
by eerie music.
Winchester employees tell
plenty of stories about strange
sightings, footsteps, slamming
doors and spontaneously break
ing windows.
Not surprisingly, the manage
ment seems to encourage the sto
ries. They publish a pamphlet
called "Strange experiences at
the Winchester Mystery House."
One can't help wondering how
Sarah Winchester — a woman so
private, she didn't answer the
door when visited by Theodore
Roosevelt — would feel as these
visitors trespass the chambers of
her lonely mind.
Sarah Winchester's ghost may
indeed walk these halls.
But it is as likely troubled by
spirits present as by the visions
that tormented her in life. Such,
indeed, are the phantoms we
have created.
