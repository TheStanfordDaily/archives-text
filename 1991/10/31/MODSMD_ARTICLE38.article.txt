# Orchestra's zany Halloween concert tonight
## 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Howling ghouls, cackling
witches and squeaky doors aren't
the only sounds of Halloween —
even goblins with bats in their
belfries know about Stanford
Symphony Orchestra's annual
light-hearted Halloween concert.
The concert, at 9 tonight in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, promises
to be full of tricks as well as
treats.
The program will feature Con
certo Competition winner Alfred
Lee on piano. Appropriately for
Halloween, Lee will be perform
ing Liszt's "Danse Macabre."
Strauss' "Overture from Die Fle
dermaus," Ravel's "Bolero" and
de Falla's "Ritual Fire Dance" are
also scheduled. But don't be sur
prised if some mysterious selec
tions also appear on the program.
The audience costume contest
is always one of the highlights of
the evening. Concert-goers are

encouraged to dress up in their
most outrageous drag, and during
the program an informal contest
is held to judge the best costume.
The winner receives the opportu
nity to conduct the finale of the
concert, Sousa's "Stars and
Stripes Forever." Last year a
male student dressed as Wonder
Woman won the contest.
But while the audience is only
encouraged to come in costume,
the musicians are required to
dress up. The costumes add to the
fun of the evening — last year, for
instance, the cellos went as bats
and in 1989, the violas dressed up
to make a pumpkin patch. The
conductor is also in costume.
According to Melissa Mcßride,
assistant conductor of the Orches
tra and principle conductor of the
Halloween concert, this is the
Orchestra's third annual black
and-orange show. The tradition
was started by former Orchestra
director Peter Jafle, a visiting con
ductor from Pomona College. The

concert is one of the Orches
tra's main fund-raising
pvpnts

CVCUWI.
This concert is the
Orchestra's first since it
returned from a success
ful tour of Eastern Europe
this summer. The three
week goodwill tour includ
ed concerts in Vienna,
Budapest, Prague, Leipzig
and Berlin.
Mcßride was recently
appointed director of
music for the El Camino
Youth Symphony. In
addition, she was named
one of the winners of this
summer's International
Competition and Work
shop for Conductors
held in Zlin, Czechoslo
vakia. This award enti
tles her to return to

Europe in February to conduct
two concerts in Poland.

Tickets for tonight's concert are

$5 for students. They can be pur
chased at Tresidder Ticket Office
or at the door. Call 3-4317 for
more information.
