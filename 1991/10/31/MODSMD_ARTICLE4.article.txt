# CODE brings budget-cut crisis to dorms
## 
### Adam Stein 
Students spoke with administrators about
the ongoing budget cuts in a series of eight
budget presentations this week, organized by
the Committee on Democracy in Education.
The committee, a recently revived student
organization that encourages student input in
campus issues, brought administrators and
faculty involved in the budget process to resi
dences in a series of programs, the first of
which was Monday and the last of which is
tonight.

"Because the ASSU open forums on the
budget had a limited draw, we thought that
the faculty and administrators should go to
the dorms," said senior Valerie Mih, a com
mittee member. "We're trying to raise aware
ness so that students can take a more active
role in the process."
Administrators and faculty aren't the only
ones doing the talking during the presenta
tions, Mih said. They "have learned a lot about
what students' priorities are."
Each presentation has drawn approximate
ly twenty students.

Junior Tad Glauthier attended a discussion
in Roble last night led by Special Assistant to the
Provost Ted Mitchell and Humanities and Sci
ences Dean Ewart Thomas. "I didn't feel this
was so much a forum for me to learn as it was for
me to get heard," Glauthier said. "The speakers
were very friendly and receptive," he added.
According to freshman Josh Maisel, "I
came to find out how I'd be directly affected by
the budget cuts." Maisel said he was
impressed with "how the speakers didn't try
to avoid any questions. They were
very frank. ..."
In addition to the seminars,
the committee is considering
organizing a survey on the budget
cuts. The survey will be distribut
ed through mailboxes to the
approximately 13,000 undergrad
uate and graduate students with
campus addresses.
Currently, said Mih, student par
ticipation is restricted to input by
isolated individuals, by writing let
ters or by serving on a committee.
The survey, she said, would assess
student priorities on a wider scale.
Although deficit-reduction tar
gets have already been assigned to
general areas, students can still

have a significant impact on the
process, she said. "The specific
items that will be cut haven't been
decided yet, and students have an
opportunity to voice their prefer
ences. A few years down the line,
Stanford will be a very different
place."
The committee was originally
formed in 1989 as an ASSU task
force. According to senior Hilary
Skillings, a committee member,
the group's purpose was to inform
students about important issues
and supplement limited official
channels for participation.
The organization was dormant
last spring, but a small group of
students re-registered it this fall
due to concern about budget cuts.
Skillings said the committee
led dorm discussions during the
debate over a change in Stan
ford's distribution requirements

A student says this
was his chance to be
heard.

and worked to reinstate funding
in the teaching assistant program
because members felt cuts would
harm the quality of education at
Stanford.
Skillings expressed uncertain
ty about the future of the com
mittee, but said the budget cuts
would keep the organization busy
most of this year.
She added, "I think (the com
mittee) was good in the past, and
it would be great if people could
become involved in various issues
through the ASSU. ... For now
we'll focus on the budget cuts,
and we'll see if people want to
continue the program later."
