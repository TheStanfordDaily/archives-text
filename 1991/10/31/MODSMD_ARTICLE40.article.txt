## 'Twenty-one' just isn't 'sex, lies and videotape' 
### Mike Curry 
What was the biggest letdown
in "Lethal Weapon 2?"
That's right, it was when that
blonde knockout drowned.
Well that blonde, Patsy Ken
sit, is back in the new film
"Twenty-one," and this time for
two whole hours.
Producers Morgan Mason
and John Hardy, who also co
produced "sex, lies and video
tape" attempt in their new film
to repeat the successful "video
tape" formula: low budget, hot
leading actress and shocking
dialogue that revolves around
sex.
Unfortunately this time their
cards don't add up to 21 or even
a measly 16; this film is a bust.
But what the heck, Kensit
looks hot doesn't she?
The saucy actress' perfor
mance as Katie, a 21-year-old,
coming-of-age woman is erratic.
This is mainly due to Don
Boyd's inconsistent screenplay
that centers the plot (if there is
one) in a framework of annoying
monologues in which Katie
reveals to the camera tidbits
about her lovers Jack and
Bobby, her parents and her
friends.
Interspersed between Katie's
monologues are flashbacks to
her life in London before she
moved and became an English
woman in New York.
Although the monologues
attempt to shock the audience
(in one she's busy on the com
mode), they aren't very clever or

very entertaining.
But who really cares anyway,
because at least Kensit's seduc
tive British accent is captivat
ing, right?
One of Katie's insights is that
"your parents are as (messed)
up and weird as everyone else."
Another is her realization that
you've "only got one life, so
you'd better work out some way
of enjoying it."
Wow.
On the other hand, "Twenty
one" does have its moments.
The film's most touching and
hilarious scenes involve Katie
and her car-salesman father.
When Katie pulls a con job on
one of her father's customers
and then pretends to be her
father's mistress at a restaurant
when they celebrate the sale,
Kensit's performance is witty
and charming.
The spunky and talented
female performer deserved a
script with more scenes like
those with her father. Kensit,
who just signed a three-picture
contract with Disney, will hope
fully find better opportunities to
put her energy on the screen.
Because it is such a weakly
written film, most of you should
avoid "Twenty-one," which will
probably be available in video
next Tuesday.
But for some of you, you
might still want to pay the $6 to
see Kensit in that white, see
through lace dress.

Curry's Quick Score: Twenty
one minus 19 (out of five).
