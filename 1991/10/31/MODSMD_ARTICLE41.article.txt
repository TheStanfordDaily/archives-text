# Scary movies may garner dates
## 
### Michael Green 
We've come a long way from
"The Swamp-man Meets the Oat
Thing." Movies that once scared
the popcorn out of our parents as
they smooched in the back seat,
ducking out of the view of the
other drive-in patrons, are now
no more than mere comedies or
classics. Some are still loved; oth
ers have been forgotten and
replaced.
Whatever that internal self
torture device is that makes us
pay good money to sit at the edge
of our seats, jumping at the
slightest sound, hoping that the
screaming actress will turn
around in time to spot the furry
hand reaching for her innocent
neck, it is prevalent enough to
bring us cheering into movie the
aters and to make us crawl back
in again, begging for a sequel. So
it has been since the first Muck
man crawled out of the swamp
and mutilated his first hapless
victim.
The following movies are at
the top of Stanford's horror and
suspense flicks list. If you haven't
seen any or all of them yet —
grab your big fuzzy blanket and a
tub of popcorn and get to Block
buster A.S.A.P.
"An American Werewolf in
London"
Two American travelers find
their vacation through England"
mildly interrupted as one of them
is hacked to shreds by a werewolf
and the other is transformed into
one. Comedy is woven into the
plot as the survivor is frequently
visited by his decomposing, un
dead in-limbo friend, who pleads
with him to commit suicide so
that all of the werewolf victims
can finally die right; and let's not
forget the convenient love affair
with the hospital nurse who
brings him into her home.
Human-to-beast transforma
tions are entrancing. Directed by
John Landis.

"The Birds"
You can always count on
Hitchcock to bring a spark to your
average, uneventful day. This
1963 thriller will be at the top of
thriller lists for eternity. Amid
the beginning stages of Rod Tay
lor and Tippi Hendren's shaky
relationship, the local winged
creatures get new ideas about din
ing out. The result is an unex
plainable onslaught that leaves
you wondering whether you
should really feed the pigeons.
"Bride of Frankenstein"
In 1935 Henry Frankenstein
decided the only way to keep his
little toy from bothering waitress
es in bars was to design an Equal
ly Attractive, Non-Alive Girl
friend (EANAG) for him. An
ancient classic that will continue
to affect women's hairstyles for
centuries.
"Carrie"
A great reminder not to pick on
that really quiet girl in your histo
ry class. Show this one to your
mom if you think she's being
overprotective. Sissy Spacek
teaches her classmates a lesson in
courtesy because no one would
pitch in for her prom dress clean
ing bill. Directed by Brian De
Palma, based on Stephen King's
twisted imagination.
"Christine"
Ask Dad if you can borrow his
'58 Plymouth Fury for your hot
date. Stephen King and John Car
penter team up and create a car
that makes Glen Close's Alex in
"Fatal Attraction" seem like
puppy love on the jealousy scale.
Possessed and streamlined, this
automotive monster kind of
makes you want to take the bus
home.
"Creature From the Black
Lagoon"
Hey! People might have actual
ly been scared by this in 1954. A

science expedition in the Amazon
encounters minor technical diffi
culties as an out of place Fish-guy
starts stealing everyone's Zag
nuts.
"Dracula" (1931)
The original and the best.
Though simplistic by modern
standards, you can't help but be
enthralled at Bela Lugosi's rendi
tion of the world's greatest hickey
master.
"The Exorcist"
What could be more fun than
watching a young, sweet and
innocent little girl (Linda Blair)
be possessed by the devil and

freak everyone out with nifty
party tricks? "The Exorcist" is
renowned as the most riveting
Grand Master of all Horror Films
and holds on to that title despite
the lousy sequels.
"Frankenstein" (1931)
Classic character. Classic trau
ma. Classic version. Boris Karloff,
as the monster, brilliantly sensi
tizes the audience to the plight of
the average bolted, resuscitated,
tall, dead guy.
"Friday the 13th"
Come to Camp Crystal Lake —
paddle canoes, play tennis and


Joe Beltran — Daily
watch your counselor get turned
into tomorrow's lunch. Fun if
you're into slasher stuff. See the
original and toss the 90,210
sequels out the window.
"Halloween"
Poor Michael Meyers is placed
in the psycho ward. Resentful of
this, he escapes and terrorizes
his whole family in his own
unique inhuman style. Doesn't
this guy ever die? Stick with the
original for an intense unholy
experience; the fourth isn't too
bad either.
"Hellraiser"
Clive Barker gets a little
pissed off because he can't solve
his Rubik's Cube. Effects and
make-up more than make up for
the convoluted plot, which
entails a man's face becoming a
pincushion and a skinless girl
friend. Hellhound: Hellraiser II
is also worth seeing.
"Misery"
Nobody ever said it has to be
an oldie to be a goodie. This
twisted masterpiece combined
the efforts of Stephen King, Rob
Reiner, James Caan and Kathy
Bates to produce a suspenseful
psycho-thriller telling the tale of
an author who is nursed back to
pain by his number-one fan.
Bates takes the fan club idea a bit
far in this hobbling experience
that had million of viewers grab
bing their ankles.
"Night of the Living Dead"
Total cheeseball flick that has
earned its status as a cult film. It
is your basic the-dead-come
back-to-life-and-try-to-kill-all-of-
the-living-because-they're-all-
ticked-that-they-don't-have-a-
tan movie.
"A Nightmare on Elm
Street"
Welcome to the wonderful,
one-non-sequined-glove world of
Freddy Kruger, a marvelous man
who doesn't effect you until you
attempt to go to sleep that night.
Child murderers do tend to be
resentful when you burn them
alive. The sequels are mildly
admirable and comedic, but only
the original boosted stock value
for No-Doze.

"The Omen"
Mephistopheles decides his
vacation time has expired and
comes back to earth in the form
of little boy Damien. Possessed
by the devil, Damien slashes his
way into your heart. Not so much
gory as it is eerie. Watch out for
crows and dogs.
"Poltergeist"
Craig T. Nelson and Joßeth
Williams experience a kidnap
ping — 80s style. The spirits are
peeved that someone built a
house on their graveyard and
vent their frustration on a steak,
as they try babysitting
Goldilocks. This film renewed
people's fear of ghosts and spir
its. Remember . . . don't go into
the light.
"Psycho"
Won't Mother ever get the
hint? Hitchcock dazzles again as
he perpetuates the whole psy
chotic killer motif. Anthony
Perkins is excellent in his immor
tal role as Norman Bates, a
schizophrenic motel owner
whose Oedipal Complex is a bit
askew. The shower scene scares
as many today as it did in 1960.
Hire a bodyguard before you
check into Motel Six.
"The Shining"
Any movie starring Jack
Nicholson as an insane caretaker
is bound to alter the moisture
level of your underwear. See Jack
type. See Jack run. See Jack
whack people with an ax. Admit
tedly, anyone who is stuck with
Shelly Duvall for an isolated win
ter in Colorado deserves a break.
The book, by Stephen King, gives
far more detail into the nature of
his reincarnation and his son's
psychic abilities, but how can you
say "No" to that cute fuzzy face
poking through the bathroom
door.
"The Texas Chainsaw Mas
sacre"
Cannibalism is glorified as
several young adults find them
selves invited for dinner. "The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre" gives
birth to Leatherface, a character
who adds powertools to the
dimension of flesh carving on
screen. Tobe Hooper, director of
this cult classic, revolutionized
the horror film industry by
depicting a real-life mass mur
der. Evidence that cult following
usually stems from low-budget.
