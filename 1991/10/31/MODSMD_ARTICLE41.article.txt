# Scary movies may garner dates
## 
### Michael Green 
We've come a long way from
"The Swamp-man Meets the Oat
Thing." Movies that once scared
the popcorn out of our parents as
they smooched in the back seat,
ducking out of the view of the
other drive-in patrons, are now
no more than mere comedies or
classics. Some are still loved; oth
ers have been forgotten and
replaced.
Whatever that internal self
torture device is that makes us
pay good money to sit at the edge
of our seats, jumping at the
slightest sound, hoping that the
screaming actress will turn
around in time to spot the furry
hand reaching for her innocent
neck, it is prevalent enough to
bring us cheering into movie the
aters and to make us crawl back
in again, begging for a sequel. So
it has been since the first Muck
man crawled out of the swamp
and mutilated his first hapless
victim.
The following movies are at
the top of Stanford's horror and
suspense flicks list. If you haven't
seen any or all of them yet —
grab your big fuzzy blanket and a
tub of popcorn and get to Block
buster A.S.A.P.
"An American Werewolf in
London"
Two American travelers find
their vacation through England"
mildly interrupted as one of them
is hacked to shreds by a werewolf
and the other is transformed into
one. Comedy is woven into the
plot as the survivor is frequently
visited by his decomposing, un
dead in-limbo friend, who pleads
with him to commit suicide so
that all of the werewolf victims
can finally die right; and let's not
forget the convenient love affair
with the hospital nurse who
brings him into her home.
Human-to-beast transforma
tions are entrancing. Directed by
John Landis.

"The Birds"
You can always count on
Hitchcock to bring a spark to your
average, uneventful day. This
1963 thriller will be at the top of
thriller lists for eternity. Amid
the beginning stages of Rod Tay
lor and Tippi Hendren's shaky
relationship, the local winged
creatures get new ideas about din
ing out. The result is an unex
plainable onslaught that leaves
you wondering whether you
should really feed the pigeons.
"Bride of Frankenstein"
In 1935 Henry Frankenstein
decided the only way to keep his
little toy from bothering waitress
es in bars was to design an Equal
ly Attractive, Non-Alive Girl
friend (EANAG) for him. An
ancient classic that will continue
to affect women's hairstyles for
centuries.
"Carrie"
A great reminder not to pick on
that really quiet girl in your histo
ry class. Show this one to your
mom if you think she's being
overprotective. Sissy Spacek
teaches her classmates a lesson in
courtesy because no one would
pitch in for her prom dress clean
ing bill. Directed by Brian De
Palma, based on Stephen King's
twisted imagination.
"Christine"
Ask Dad if you can borrow his
'58 Plymouth Fury for your hot
date. Stephen King and John Car
penter team up and create a car
that makes Glen Close's Alex in
"Fatal Attraction" seem like
puppy love on the jealousy scale.
Possessed and streamlined, this
automotive monster kind of
makes you want to take the bus
home.
"Creature From the Black
Lagoon"
Hey! People might have actual
ly been scared by this in 1954. A

science expedition in the Amazon
encounters minor technical diffi
culties as an out of place Fish-guy
starts stealing everyone's Zag
nuts.
"Dracula" (1931)
The original and the best.
Though simplistic by modern
standards, you can't help but be
enthralled at Bela Lugosi's rendi
tion of the world's greatest hickey
master.
"The Exorcist"
What could be more fun than
watching a young, sweet and
innocent little girl (Linda Blair)
be possessed by the devil and

freak everyone out with nifty
party tricks? "The Exorcist" is
renowned as the most riveting
Grand Master of all Horror Films
and holds on to that title despite
the lousy sequels.
"Frankenstein" (1931)
Classic character. Classic trau
ma. Classic version. Boris Karloff,
as the monster, brilliantly sensi
tizes the audience to the plight of
the average bolted, resuscitated,
tall, dead guy.
"Friday the 13th"
Come to Camp Crystal Lake —
