# 'Dogfight' best left for the dogs Storyline is trite, predictable and boring

### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
My girlfriend fell asleep about
a half hour into "Dogfight," and I
let her sleep for the remainder of
the film. She was better off catch
ing up on her rest.
The movie is just flat. It is as
steadily and monotonously unin
teresting as driving down one of
those perfectly straight Midwest
ern roads in the middle of the
night. You have to shake your
head and twist in your seat to pay
attention or even stay awake.
"Dogfight," starring River
Phoenix and Lili Taylor, tells the
tale of a group of Marines who
have a "dogfight" on their last
night in San Francisco before
they ship out for Vietnam; they
all put $50 into a pool and whoev
er can bring back the ugliest date
wins.
But Rose (Taylor), Birdlace's
(Phoenix) date, accidentally dis

covers the subterfuge. She scolds
him and then storms away, hurt.
But he quickly wins her back with
hollow apologies, and they wan
der around the city for the rest of
the night. Of course, they fall in
love, and screen writer Bob Com
fort tries to represent their whirl
wind night as an entire relation
ship packed into one powerful
evening.
However, under the direction of
Nancy Savoca, nothing comes out
strong in this movie; the acting is
mechanical, the scenes devoid of
emotion and the characters are
fashioned from cardboard.
From the opening flashback
scene, "Dogfight" starts with no
purpose and just keeps on going.
Within 15 minutes, the remotely
interesting parts of the film are
killed, and then it trudges along
while the audience sits and won
ders why. Thankfully, it is a mere
90 minutes long.
The storyline is utterly pre

dictable. I don't even feel bad
telling you the ending. The couple
reunites after the war, and every
thing is instantly peachy keen.
After all the other flatness in the
movie, I found myself markedly
disinterested. What should have
been the emotional peak of the
film wasn't nearly as moving as
when they turned the lights on
and I knew the damn thing was
finally over.
The thematic content of the
movie trips equally as hard. The
film tries to present some social
commentary on war, beauty stan
dards, treatment of women and
love. Nope. Like everything else
about this movie, its "themes"
failed to rouse me. If the viewer
just doesn't care about the char
acters, the most important mes
sage in the world just isn't going
to connect.
For $7, go see River Phoenix's
other movie, "My Own Private
Idaho." I hear it's pretty good.
