## Rock returns to roots 
### 
SOONER OR LATER ALL
musicians return to their
roots, and for some the jour
ney is more intriguing than the
destination.
For instance, the road to John
Mellencamp's latest release,
"Whenever We Wanted," has led
the Hoosier to AC/DC country,
which apparently is exactly where
he wanted to go.

After releasing the dour "Big
Daddy" in 1989, Mellencamp
voiced his displeasure with life,
music and touring and turned
instead to painting and film-mak
ing. But he vowed that his next
record would be harder and
rougher — like AC/DC. He didn't
miss by much.
"Whenever We Wanted" is
simple, angry and hard. Mellen
camp abandons the fiddles and
social introspection of his several
previous albums and returns to
the harder-edged sounds of his
"American Fool" period. Having
just turned 40 and gotten
divorced, his lyrics ooze mid-life
crisis.
The album's first side is jar
ring with one metallic riff after
another, but the second side is
more even-tempered. The title
song and bluesy "Last Chance" as
well as the Stones-esque "They're
So Tough" balance new and old
Mellencamp deliciously and
embody the best of this uneven
and surprising new album.
On "Storyville," Robbie Rob-
ertson returns to his roots by
attempting to capture the flavor
and mystery of New Orleans,
where he spent part of his child
hood. Though subtly spiced with
the city's atmospheric musical
gumbo, Robertson's new album
reaps its rewards from an evoca
tive and moving song cycle.
Loosely structured around a
familiar story; boy meets girl, boy
loses girl, etc., "Storyville" ulti
mately revolves around its char
acters' spiritual awakenings.
Individually, the songs echo
Robertson's self-titled debut,
with "Hold Back the Dawn" and
"Day of Reckoning" sounding like

"Broken Arrow" and "Some
where Down on Crazy River,"
respectively. I sense a mini-series
here.
John Lee Hooker doesn't need
to return to his roots. He is his
roots. On "Mr. Lucky" the 71-
year-old bluesman has once again
assembled a group of his most fer
vent admirers for a collection of
duets. Though not as strong as
his Grammy Award-winning
"The Healer" album from 1989,
his latest release still has its share
of world-class collaborations.
The album's focal point is
undoubtedly Hooker's sultry duet
with Van Morrison entitled "I
Cover the Waterfront" — presto,
instant classic. "Crawlin'
Kingsnake" with Keith Richards
and "Mr. Lucky" with Robert
Cray are solid, but "Backstab
bers" with guitar legend Albert
Collins, and "Susie" with Johnny
Winter are simply screamin'.
One man who helped define
the early '80s Los Angeles roots
rock scene is Dave Alvin. Along
with X, Alvin and his band The
Blasters helped create a hybrid of
punk, blues and rockabilly. Now
on a small, independent label
(Hightone Records in nearby
Oakland) Alvin has released
"Blue Blvd," an outstanding
album of modest, unadorned
blues.
Alternating jaunty numbers
like "Haley's Comet" and "Wanda
and Duane" with a sparse, bare
bones songs like "Why Did She
Stay With Him" and "Plastic
Rose," Alvin is reminiscent of
John Hiatt in both his songwrit
ing and vocal delivery. His cynical
lyrics and sometimes growling
vocal delivery are especially effec
tive on "Andersonville," a haunt
ing story of a Civil War soldier.
On a final roots note, though
the movie was little more than a
long-form music video, the sound
track to "The Commitments"
aptly represents the best 48 min
utes of the movie. The soundtrack
doesn't feature live performances
like the movie and the credits are
unclear as to who's playing the
instruments, but the music is no
less spirited .
Andrew Strong, 17, the lead
singer in the movie, only sings six
of the soundtrack's 14 songs, yet
he easily steals the show. His
deep, throaty voice is perfectly
suited to sing Memphis soul from
the Stax/Volt era, and he takes
"Try a Little Tenderness" and
"Take Me To the River" and
makes them his own.
