# Bridge concert is a great bargain

The good folks at Supply &
Demand, Inc. done messed up.
Advance tickets for Saturday's
fifth annual Bridge School Bene
fit are only $12.50 for lawn seat
ing. Isn't the idea of a benefit con
cert to raise money?
Opened shortly after the 1987
concert, The Bridge School
"serves kids who have severe
speech impairments and are phys
ically handicapped," according to
Program Director Jillian King.
Neil Young, whose 12-year-old
son Ben is one of the students
enrolled at the school, has orga
nized the annual fund-raising
concerts, at which he and other
musicians perform. His wife
Peggy is the president of the
school's board of directors.
King said the school's aim is to
enable its students to make the
transition from the program into
the public school system. This
fall, one girl became the first to
make that transition, entering a
San Francisco middle school.
"She has her own portable
communications system," King
said, explaining that the students
in the program are taught to use a
computer to bridge the gap
between their ability to under
stand and their inability to com
municate.
Twelve students between 4 and
14 years of age are currently
enrolled in the school, which is
located in Hillsboro.
Artists who have joined Young
on stage in past years include Bob
Dylan, Tom Petty, Edie Brickell,
Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne
and Crosby, Stills & Nash.
Here's a look at what you can
expect from this year's perform

ers:
• Neil Young — a fixture in the
upper echelon of rock performers
whether jamming with his Crazy
Horse buddies or playing his
acoustic material on his own.
If past form holds, after show
ing a slide show that describes
The Bridge School to the tune of
"I am a Child" and "Teach Your
Children," Young, sporting a gui
tar, a harmonica and a pain
drenched face, will begin the con
cert with about a 40-minute set
that mixes songs both old and
new to the contentment of every
spectator worth his or her ticket
stub.
Then, after the other perform
ers have had their chance, Young
will likely return to jam for a final
20 minutes or so. These finales
have been superb the last two years
with Young reuniting with CSN in
1989 and performing a fantastic
version of "Down by the River"
with Elvis Costello last year.
• Tracy Chapman — it's been
two years since her last album;
she'll likely unveil new material.
She also performed in 1989 —
what a voice!
• John Lee Hooker — a blues
dinosaur who never died. At 70-
plus years old, he rocked Memori
al Auditorium last spring. Even
as old as he is, he still exudes
more emotion than most of
today's stars.
• Nils Lofgren — who knows
what to expect? Best known for
his work in the E Street Band,
he's a gifted guitarist who played
with Young in the early '70s, but
like Sammy Hagar who per
formed in 1989, he probably
hasn't played an acoustic guitar
since he was 6 years old. In the
acoustic-only Bridge setting, he'll
have to scrap. Hagar pulled it off

with enjoyable if not inspired
playing; Lofgren should do the
same.
• Don Henley, Willie Nelson
and anybody else who shows up
— Henley may be number two in
the billing for the show, but he's

nothing special in concert.
As for Nelson, with whom
Young joined to help organize the
Farm Aid concert series,
shouldn't he be playing for profit,
or is he hoping the I.R.S. will give
him a charity exemption?
