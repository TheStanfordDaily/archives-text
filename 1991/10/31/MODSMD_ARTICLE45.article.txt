# Live album pales in comparison to concert

Here's a good rule for buying a
live album: If you were there,
don't buy it.
Either because of the drugs
you were on or because the open
ing band was so bad that even a
Boz-Scaggs-meets-the-Bee-Gees
in-a-disco-duel set would have
sounded great, chances are that if
you remember the show fondly
enough to consider purchasing a
recording of it, you'll be disap
pointed if you do.
Unfortunately, an acoustic
recording, no matter how digital,
is limited to the audio part of the
program. So, that great set you
picture so vividly in your mind
isn't there when you buy the com
pact disc. And even the best
stereo can't recreate the feeling,
smell and sight of thousands of
screaming people standing right
next to you.
A case in point is "Weld," a
two-hour, fully digital, two-com
pact-disc recording of Neil Young
& Crazy Horse's 1990-91 tour.
The songs average more than
seven minutes in length, filled
with jams like only guys named
Billy, Ralph, Frank and Neil can
create. And Young and his ratio
nalized-garage-band buddies
sound great on classic tracks like 4
"Cinnamon Girl," "Powderfin
ger" and "Cortez the Killer."
But for someone who saw the
strain in Young's face as he
ripped his solos out of his guitar

and recalls the oversized micro
phone with the yellow ribbon tied
around it that connected the Gulf
war which was in the fore of lis
teners' minds at the time to
Young's chilling rendition of Bob
Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind,"
the CD cannot possibly do justice
to the genuine article.
On the other hand, for those
unable to make it to last winter's
tour (or those unwilling to endure
Sonic Youth's opening disgrace)
"Weld" offers the second-best
(after "Live Rust") live recording
of Young and Crazy Horse avail
able on CD. Of course, it's only
the second such recording avail
able. . . .
The trouble with "Weld" is
that, with the exception of
"Blowin' in the Wind," its songs
don't offer anything new. Yes, it
contains four tracks from the
1990 album "Ragged Glory," and
you could set up an S.A.T.-like
relation, arguing "Weld" is to
"Ragged Glory" as "Live Rust"
was to "Rust Never Sleeps."
Except that "Ragged Glory" was
no "Rust Never Sleeps," and live
versions of its songs don't unveil
any great hidden treasures.
As for the older songs on
"Weld," most appeared on "Live
Rust," so "Weld" is little more
than a Crazy Horse reunion gig.
*The performers have aged fairly
well, as was evident in concert.
But like most reunion gigs, no
matter how successful, "Weld" is
