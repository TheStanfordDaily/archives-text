# Eros and Thanatos intertwine at Mausoleum party
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
"I was a Mafioso. My date was an angel in a
white dress. So of course the dancing wasn't all it
could have been.
"But when I caught sight of Repressed Sexuali
ty, whose crimson negligee trickled from the folds
of a cape she'd obviously commandeered from
Drac, I was spellbound. She said her name was
Jungfreuda. Adjusting my uzi in its holster, I said,
'Lido Libido. We're gonna get along just fine.' "Those
were the words of a normal, well-adjusted senior
describing how he first met his girlfriend of two
years.
It has to be true that sex and death are the same
thing. Otherwise there's no way we'd keep making
the Mausoleum migration like so many guano-pro
ducing toe-hangers. And sure as bats and love are
blind, it'll happen again tonight.
At its best, the traditional Halloween desecra
tion of our esteemed founders' burial place is a dose
of death and disguise potent enough to turn any
insufferable goody-goody into a bubbling cauldron
of desire.
To begin with, nothing on campus matches the
majesty of the Mausoleum itself, since not even the
Rodin Sculpture Garden has sphinxes, knockers
and sphinxes with knockers. Then there's the
party stuff, which will include a disc jockey, colored

lights and a video screen this year.
But it is the partygoers' attitudes and costumes
that really make or break the annual Halloween
event. Jennifer Steele, one of the senior class pres
idents organizing tonight's party, said, "It's
always fun to see who's wearing what." She espe
cially remembered one year when three guys
dressed as Macintoshes with gutted monitors on
their heads.
You have to get into it, though, or there's no
point in going. If there isn't enough adrenaline
(or maybe alcohol) in your bloodstream to make
up for the inevitable discomfort of an autumn
outdoor party, it won't be fun. In the words of
one sophomore, last year's gala was "dumb.
There was a guy with a (live) snake and people in
dumb costumes. It was cold and dark and too far
to walk."
It'll be cold and dark and far to walk this year
too, but it's still the only night when you can unlid
the Lido Libido in you with very little risk. After
all, you're in character.
Clueless persons of fresh who still don't know
where the Mausoleum is will find the Halloween
hoe-down a learning experience in more ways than
one.
The party starts at 9 p.m. Wear a costume.
There's a pre-party at 8 p.m. for seniors only (in
place of senior pub night) at the Band Shak, a
spooky enough haunt any day of the year.

No matter where you go or what you wear this Halloween, everybody thinks tongues are a real riot.
