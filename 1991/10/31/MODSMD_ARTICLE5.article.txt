# It's goblins, ghouls and gizzards, oh my!

From tied-towel capes to
oversized high-heels, children
love to play dress-up. But when
the treats are on the line for Hal
loween, Escondido Elementary
School first and second graders
get serious about the question
"What makes a good costume?"
The fright factor played into
many answers. First grade twins
Danielle and Nicole Ellison shout
ed in unison, "A witch! A witch!"
As an alternative to terror, second
grader Inbal Netzer said that one
need only look to the disgusting.
She said, "The idea of a spider is
that it is yucky. I hate it. It makes
you go eeyooou."
Some students concerned
themselves with ease of assem
bly. First grader Wee-Tin Kao
said with a shrug, "Just slippers,
a long flower dress, and a crown
— that's all you need to be a
princess."
Covering all the bases, Sophie
Kaplan flexed her first grade

a pumpkin good is that it lights,"
she said definitively. "What makes
a ballerina good is that it's pretty.
What makes a clown good is that
it's funny. There."
Focusing on classic Halloween
attire, first grade fashion consul
tant Justine Wool pointed out the
subtle aspects of the mask. She
remarked thoughtfully, "I like
masks because I like the idea of
the nose — the way it pokes out.
And the colors. I like the way they

go together."
While most students preferred
to respond in specific terms, sec
ond-grader Danny Carter-Nelson
offered a more abstract explana
tion. "What makes a good cos
tume? Something that's home
made," he said. "Something made
by someone in your family and
not a machine. I mean, you could
use a little sewing machine, but
not some machine that makes
thousands of costumes a day."
Ryan Jones, a second grader,
wise beyond his years, summed
up, "You don't have to dress up.
You can still go trick or treating.
The point of Halloween is just to
have fun."
