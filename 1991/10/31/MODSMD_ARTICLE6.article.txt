# Deferring admission offers opportunities

Not every student is ready to
jump right into college life at Stan
ford after four years of high school.
Instead, some decide to travel or
work for a year before starting
school, including the 17 students in
the class of 1995 who decided to
defer their Stanford admission after
being accepted in the spring of 1990.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions usually grants re
quests for deferred admissions
because "the experiences that (the
students) have had can add to the
interesting background they bring
to the campus," said Assoc. Dean
of Admissions Bill Tingley.
Incoming students who want
to take a year off typically contact
the admissions office when oppor
tunities for travel or work develop
during the spring of their senior
year of high school, Tingley said.
Freshman Todd Dickson stayed
in the Soviet Union for just over a
year before coming to Stanford.
He attended a university for two
semesters and focused on learning

Russian and studying history.
Dickson is now considering major
ing in history.
Dickson said his overseas
study was different from his pre
vious American education in that
there were many more lecture
hours and that he had to study
from books on reserve at the
library. There were no resources
available to produce many text
books, he said.
"It opened me to an entirely
different world and a completely
different economic situation,"
Dickson said.
Freshman Andrew Snekvik
decided to defer his admission last
year when he traveled by train,
biked, hiked and skied his way
from Portugal to Norway, Paris,
Germany and Holland. He was
able to stay with friends at most
of his stops, but he was on his
own in Paris and Germany.
While in Europe, Snekvik said
he found that the United States is
not generally admired by Euro
peans. "(They) don't think Amer
ica is too hot," he said. He also
marveled at the widespread use of
English throughout the countries
he visited.
Snekvik said he thinks the
practical experience he got while
away from his family was benefi
cial. He said he would like to
spend two quarters in Paris and
one in Leningrad sometime in the
future.
Freshman Astrida Seja chose
to spend a year at a Latvian
school in Germany. She said she
felt it was a good period of transi
tion between high school and col
lege.
Seja said she was happy to

know she already had a place at
college secured before taking off
for Europe. "I was glad I had it all
taken care of."
Freshman Yvonne Gingras
went to school in Spain on a
Rotary International Scholar
ship she received in her senior
year. Gingras said she found it
very unlike the United States'
educational system and because
of her experience, Gingras said
she is now less focused on
grades. They seem to frustrate
and preoccupy Stanford stu
dents, she said.
Stanford allows incoming
students a year off on the condi
tion that the year is spent in a
constructive way or if time is
requested for medical or per
sonal reasons, according to Tin
gley.
