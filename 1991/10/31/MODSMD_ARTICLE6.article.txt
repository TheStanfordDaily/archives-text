# Deferring admission offers opportunities

Not every student is ready to
jump right into college life at Stan
ford after four years of high school.
Instead, some decide to travel or
work for a year before starting
school, including the 17 students in
the class of 1995 who decided to
defer their Stanford admission after
being accepted in the spring of 1990.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions usually grants re
quests for deferred admissions
because "the experiences that (the
students) have had can add to the
interesting background they bring
to the campus," said Assoc. Dean
of Admissions Bill Tingley.
Incoming students who want
to take a year off typically contact
the admissions office when oppor
tunities for travel or work develop
during the spring of their senior
year of high school, Tingley said.
Freshman Todd Dickson stayed
in the Soviet Union for just over a
year before coming to Stanford.
He attended a university for two
semesters and focused on learning

Russian and studying history.
Dickson is now considering major
ing in history.
Dickson said his overseas
study was different from his pre
vious American education in that
there were many more lecture
hours and that he had to study
from books on reserve at the
library. There were no resources
available to produce many text
books, he said.
"It opened me to an entirely
different world and a completely
different economic situation,"
Dickson said.
Freshman Andrew Snekvik
decided to defer his admission last
year when he traveled by train,
biked, hiked and skied his way
from Portugal to Norway, Paris,
Germany and Holland. He was
able to stay with friends at most
of his stops, but he was on his
own in Paris and Germany.
While in Europe, Snekvik said
he found that the United States is
not generally admired by Euro
