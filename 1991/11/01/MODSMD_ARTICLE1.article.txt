# Locking doors for sweeter dreams
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Stanford is literally becoming
harder to get into — as students
respond to recent visits by four
separate intruders in campus resi
dences. Many students have decid
ed that the key to campus security
is simply locking their doors.
A letter released Tuesday by
the Office of Residential Affairs
advised residence staff members
of the incidents, which were
reported by residents of Wilbur,
Slavianskii Dom, the French
House and Grove-Lasuen.
The letter urged campus resi
dents to keep their doors and win
dows locked, especially at night,
and to report suspicious visitors
to their residence staffs and the
police.
Copies of the letter have been
posted in several dorms, and
many students are already
responding to its plea for
enhanced security precautions.
"We're installing emergency
lights in our house, so there have
been a lot of strange workmen
walking around," said Karen Ho,
a resident assistant in Okada.
"Students keep coming to me to
report them."
But in some residences, security
practices remain as relaxed as ever.
While most students are aware of
the recent intrusions, many doors
continue to go unlocked at night.
"I don't think people are par
ticularly concerned, and that's
why I'm worried," said Patricia
Nabti, a resident fellow in Arroyo.
"People always think it's going to
happen to somebody else."
Arroyo was among the first
dorms to be visited by an intrud
er during the past three weeks. A
middle-aged man who had earlier
been seen wandering around the
Wilbur complex was found hiding
in a female student's room.
Although residents have been
reminded to lock their doors at
night, Nabti doesn't expect that

many will change their ways.
"Locked doors create a differ
ent atmosphere in the dorm,"
she said. "Students aren't willing
to give up that community feel
ing."
According to Karin Gaisford,
the RAin Slavianskii Dom, "just
having the front door locked isn't
enough."
"We're pretty much targets for
anyone who's deranged," Gais
ford said.
Slavianskii Dom was repeated
ly visited by a male intruder.
