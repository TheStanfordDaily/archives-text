# Day two of Mideast talks marked by dispute
## 
### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — Arab dele
gates spurned an invitation yesterday
from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to go to Israel to negotiate,
dramatizing a growing dispute over
where the Mideast peace conference is
heading.
In their first exchanges on the floor
of the historic conference, Arab and
Israeli leaders traded recriminations
and clung to familiar positions. The
Arabs demanded all the land they lost
in the 1967 war. Israel demanded
recognition before it would even con
sider yielding territory.
Although the day was devoted to
formal speeches, the atmosphere was
more confrontational than in
Wednesday's opening session. Shamir
called it a "garden of thorns."
The Arabs argued that peace was
conditional on Israeli willingness to
give up the captured territories.
"Every inch," insisted Syria's foreign
minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
Shamir said "The issue is not terri
tory but our existence."
"We appeal to you to renounce the
'jihad' (holy war) against Israel," he
said.
But the speeches also carried ele
ments of the conciliatory language the
world was hoping to hear from this
unprecedented gathering of Israelis,
Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians,
Lebanese and Egyptians.

"Blessed are the peacemakers,"
said Jordanian Foreign Minister
Kamel Abu-Jaber. "We are willing to
live side by side on the land," said
Haidar Abdul-Shafi, representing the
Palestinians. Shamir began his speech
with a simple "Shalom."

'Several days ago I said the conference will not be
a rose garden, but today it was a whole garden of
thorns.'
— Yitzhak Shamir

Although the Arab and Israeli dele
gation heads did not applaud each
other's speeches, yesterday's session
was a milestone. It marked the first
time Palestinians and Israelis have
addressed each other in a formal nego
tiating format.-
But while the conference itself kept
to the format scripted by its architect,
Secretary of State James Baker, ques
tions arose over how it will develop
when the ceremonies end and the real
face-to-face bargaining begins.
In inviting the Arabs to start nego
tiations in Israel and rotate them to
the Arab states, Shamir was in effect
challenging them to prove they recog
nize Israel.
"There is no better way to make
peace than to talk in each other's

home. Avoiding such talks is a denial
of the purpose of the negotiations," he
said.
The Arabs want to talk on neutral
ground, at least until Israel proves
willing to consider their demand for
territorial concessions, Palestinian

rights and an end to building Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories.
"The momentum in Madrid is good,
the spirit in Madrid is good, why don't
we keep it here?" said Jordan's foreign
minister, Kamel Abu Jaber. He said an
argument over venue posed a "danger
of disrupting the whole momentum of
the conference."
The first round of face-to-face nego
tiations is to begin in Madrid on
Sunday, Israeli officials said. But it
will deal only with procedural matters.
Still in question is where the substan
tive bilateral talks will take place.
Seated in the chandeliered Hall of
Columns of the Spanish royal palace,
Arabs and Jews listened in silence as
each delegate used his allotted speak
ing time to deliver his history of the

Arab-Israeli conflict and his vision of
peace.
Their fundamental differences were
evident, even in their reading of histo
ry-
Shamir saw Israel as the victim of
sustained Arab "boycott, blockade,
terrorism and outright war."
Syria's al-Sharaa said that but for
Israel, "millions of Arabs —
Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese —
would not have been uprooted from
their homes." Jordan's Abu Jaber said
"the Palestinians and Jordan have
paid the price" of the Nazi Holocaust
that drove the Jews to seek new homes
in Palestine.
Abu Jaber conceded that "most
Arabs, out of a sense of outrage and
feelings of injustice and betrayal, have
refused since 1947 to contemplate
accommodation.''
But "if this conference does any
thing it must end Israel's self-righ
teous attitude to live by its own rules
alone," the Jordanian said. To back
Jordan's cause, King Hussein
appeared via live TV hookup from
Amman — the second Middle East
leader to show up, albeit electronically,
at the conference.
Afterward, Shamir commented on
Israel radio: "Several days ago I said
the conference will not be a rose gar
den, but today it was a whole garden of
thorns."
