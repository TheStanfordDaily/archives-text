## Why report on rape? 
### 
About a month ago, The
Daily published a series of
articles about a 17-year-old
who reported she was raped in
Casa Zapata. In the series we pub
lished the name and photograph of
the suspect as soon as he was
charged with the crime. We also
printed selected graphic details of
the event as they had been
described in a police report.
And we were widely lambasted
by members of the community.
Many said we shouldn't have
printed the story at all, or we
should have waited until the case
was closed and the dust had set
tled. Others criticized us for print
ing the accused man's name and
not the victim's. We were also
attacked for printing " sensational -
istic" details of the alleged event.
On all counts, I stand by The
Daily's coverage.
Covering important events is
our job. Our persistence may frus
trate those on the other end of the
telephone, yet relentless pursuit of
the truth is our central mission.
We printed Stuart Thomas'
name because he is over 18 and his
name became part of the public
record when he was formally
charged — not because we had
decided he was guilty. That is for
the court to determine. We also
printed his name and photograph
to prevent rumor from stigmatizing
every male resident of Casa Zapata.
The Daily's coverage of the Casa
Zapata incident brought the
alleged rape into the spotlight of
discussion using details that mag
nify the issue's complexity.
We did not print the woman's
name because she is a minor. Many
have asked rightly whether we
would have printed her name if
she were over 18. Traditionally,
newspapers have not.
But that may be changing. Last
year, The Des Moines Register
published the name and story of a
rape victim who had asked to be
identified. The series won a
Pulitzer Prize for public service.
It was a prize well-awarded.
Newspapers should print the

names of adult rape victims. It is
too easy for us to deny that rape
happens when we don't see the
human element — how a woman's
life has been forever changed by
the experience.
Statistically, an undergraduate
woman is sexually coerced every
other day on this campus. But
because the vast majority of rapes
goes unreported, the statistic
doesn't mean much. As a society
we are squeamish about sex, so we
choose not to believe — or we
blame — the women who step for
ward. Thus, few rapes are report
ed, and the crime continues.
Unlike victims of many crimes,
rape victims are often accused of
"asking for it." Their sexual histo
ries as well as the clothing they wore
at the time of the attack are wrong
ly viewed as relevant during the
trial, which is often the only aspect
of the story newspapers report.
Imagine asking someone whose
watch had been stolen why he was
wearing such an appealing time
piece, or why he was walking down
a particular street.
We would never subject the vic
tim of a robbery to this sort of
irrelevant scrutiny. Sex is such an
uncomfortable topic that we would
rather blame the person who
brought it to light — the victim.
Concealing a rape victim's name is
just another way of blaming her.
By "protecting" her, society
wrongfully treats her like damaged
goods. Similarly, the morally out
raged who choose to blame The
Daily — or any newspaper — for
printing the facts compound the
woman's grief by treating the
details as if they are shameful.
Victims of rape aren't statistics.
They are human beings. But
because newspapers haven't tradi
tionally published their stories, we
know them only as numbers.
What is horrible about rape is
not that it is publicized, but that it
happens. If we shy away from
reporting rape, we deny that it
happens. And in denying rape, we
perpetuate it.
