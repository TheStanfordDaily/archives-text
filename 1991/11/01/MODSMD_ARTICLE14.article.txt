Statutory rape charge sends improper message

Last month the new york
Times Magazine (Oct. 6) featured
an article about Catherine MacKin
non, the nationally-renowned feminist
legal scholar, now a tenured law professor
at the University of Michigan. The article
recounts the history of MacKinnon's rise
to prominence in a society marred by the
daily realities of sexual discrimination
and violence and in a legal world that
continues to reject many facets of femi
nist legal work as essentially unjustifiable
or unworthy of aggressive pursuit.
The challenges facing MacKinnon are
disturbing, particularly in light of the
legal backlash that is seeming to emerge
against feminist approaches of various
kinds. In a personal sense, it was equally
disturbing to consider MacKinnon's
struggle in light of the "alleged" sexual
assault here at Stanford. Currently, the
male student who was arrested is being
tried not for forcible rape, but for

Rape.. .is stilt 'defined and adjudicated from the maie
standpoint while it remains only an injury from
women's point of view.'

"unlawful sex with a minor" or statuto
ry rape — a crime that can result in a
maximum penalty of one year in jail or
prison.
While many of the details of the Zapa
ta case have admittedly not been re
leased, I cannot help but express my
concern that the charges being leveled
against Stuart Thomas may in fact be
disregarding part of the picture — the
part experienced by the woman. Specifi
cally, did the woman report the rape
because it was performed offensively
against her will and against her person,
or did she report it because she is 17

years old and feels she is too young to
have engaged in sexual activity?
In legal speak, doesn't statutory rape
in effect forgive the perpetrator of a
great deal of moral responsibility by sug
gesting that if the woman had been one
year older, she would have no justifiable
claim against him? Do members of the
Stanford community view the alleged
rape as a crime only because Thomas
should have paid more respect to the
legal age determination of 18 years for
sexual intercourse, or because the
woman may have experienced physical,
emotional or psychological injury?

As MacKinnon has pointed out fre
quently in her career, the crime of rape in
current legal thinking is still "defined and
adjudicated from the male standpoint
while it remains only an injury from
women's point of view." In other words,
rape laws still seem to hold that the man
possessed some sort of "criminal intent."
Otherwise, it supposes, rape cannot quali
tatively be distinguished from legal sex.
MacKinnon's work is an ongoing tes
tament to the progress being made for
feminist law and for women at large in
this country. It is my hope that the
charges ultimately brought against
Thomas will be just, both for him and
for the woman who has accused him of
rape. In this vein, I hope it will be a jus
tice that considers not only his frame of
mind, as the perpetrator, but also her
frame of mind, as the victim.
