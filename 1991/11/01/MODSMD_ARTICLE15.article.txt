# Drama crucial in academic world
## 
### 
If the ad hoc planning group for the
School of Humanities and Sciences pur
sues the course it is currently consider
ing, the 8 percent cut required of the
school will be gouged with disproportion
ate brutality from the arts. The Depart
ment of Drama, despite a top-10 national
ranking for both its graduate and under
graduate programs, will be terminated.
Why is this happening?
It is happening because of a misunder
standing about the status and role of the
arts in the academic environment. The arts
apparently are regarded by members of the
ad hoc planning group as "soft" disciplines
that are not "central" to the University.
At Stanford this is simply not true.
The graduate program in drama, for
instance, combines practical theater train

ing with rigorous theoretical and scholarly
work. This unique combination has given
Stanford Ph.D.s an unrivaled success rate
in employment and publication. Anyone
attending a major theater conference can
attest that the academic discipline of
drama nationwide is dominated by indi
viduals with doctorates from Stanford.
Furthermore, the emphasis on perfor
mance means that the research work of
drama graduate students is shared direct
ly with the University community. Drama
Department productions, like works of art
and musical performances, are public
expressions of the study, research and
training our department provides. They
are also frequently points of interaction
for students from many different disci
plines throughout the University.
Can a world-class university kill a
department that not only leads its aca
demic field but also publicly involves
itself in the intellectual and cultural life
of the whole community? Unless stu-

dents who recognize the value of the arts
can effect a change in present attitudes,
the answer will soon be a shocking yes.
