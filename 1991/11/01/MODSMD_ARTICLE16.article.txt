# Mutant Tresidder birds a beautiful sight
## 
### 
What is it that makes the birds outside
the Coffee House look as if they nested on
a nuclear reactor? Where I come from birds
have ordinary limbs. Of the birds playing
there about half of them have mutated
legs. One bird has only one leg. Another
has his toes bunched together in a tumor
ous mass. This variety of legs and limps is
beautiful in a place characterized by unifor
mity. Imagine how beautiful we would look
if we were all sick and deformed.
