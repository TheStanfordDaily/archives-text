## Ronald Hilton Hoover towering above the Quad 
### 
THE TWO SYMBOLS OF Stanford
are Hoover Tower and the Stadi
um. The Tower is a streamlined
version of the tower of Salamanca Uni
versity, the Stadium modern version of
the Roman Colosseum.
The Tower recently celebrated its 50th
birthday with dignified ceremonies in the
great university tradition. The Stadium
was the venue of the mcgor celebrations
of the University's centennial anniver
sary, reminiscent of a show at the Roman
arena.
The football games recall the mock
battles in the Colosseum. There was
reportedly a proposal that the Centennial
be celebrated by throwing Christians to
the lions. It was dropped not for any con
cern about the former, but because of
protests that lions were an endangered
species. So a compromise was reached:
hoopla, featuring at its nadir a condom
on a banana, proclaimed to be the symbol
of where the world is going.
Stanford's gratitude to its founders
was expressed in allusions to robber
barons. A little theater was provided by a
couple representing the Stanfords in a
carriage, but the imposing bronze family
group, once the centerpiece of Memorial
Quad, remains in storage, despite
demands that it be restored to a dignified
place.
The Centennial ended with a rowdy
demonstration against Gov. Pete Wilson

by "Queers," as they proclaimed them
selves. Wilson, a liberal Republican
detested by the right, was a major speak
er at the Tower celebration, where he was
given a courteous reception.
The comparison is obvious and odious.
I have inhabited both the Quad and the
Tower, which properly looks down on the
former as a refuge for fools and louts, a
minority which intimidates the sensible
mtgority of Quad people.
For years some of us have been
protesting against the decline of the spir
it of reasonable discourse, which should
be the hallmark of a university and which
is characteristic of Hoover Institution.
This has nothing to do with ideology.
We protest also against the decline of
once dignified commencement exercises
into political rallies and against a Centen
nial Celebration more appropriate for Las
Vegas than for a university. Newsweek
magazine recently said that Stanford,
once the Harvard, was now the UNLV of
the Pacific.
Which brings us to an important issue:
the selection of Stanford's next president
and, implicitly, its administration. It has
been announced that the opinions of
members of the Academic Council and of
students will be sought. This insidious
remark means that Hoover scholars will
not have a say. This is serious because,
while the University's reputation has
been tarnished, that of Hoover has risen,

as when the name Johns Hopkins imme
diately brings to mind its distinguished
School of Medicine.
When I made the original proposal for
the Faculty Senate, it never occurred to
me that Hoover scholars would be
excluded. I protested without avail
against this nasty discrimination, and I
protest again. Hoover fellows should be
members of both the Academic Council
and the senate.
In an earlier article I argued for the
replacement of the imperial presidency
with a collegiate system in which the
presidency rotates, as in European uni
versities. However, if Stanford must have
an imperial presidency, I would suggest
an emperor with his academic clothes on.
My nominee is the Librarian of Congress
James Billington, who, although a histo
rian, has the humility that befits a schol
ar.
Remember St. Paul's praise of famous
men: "Even though you speak (like some
professors) with the tongues of men and
of angels, and have not charity ..."
Neither the Stanfords nor the Hoovers
had tongues of angels, but they had char
ity, and we Stanfordites are the benefi
ciaries of their legacy. We should be
grateful to them.

Ronald Hilton, emeritus professor of
humanities, is a visiting scholar at
Hoover Institution.
