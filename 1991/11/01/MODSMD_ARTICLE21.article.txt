## Sticks 'n' stones may break his bones But Estevan Avila won't stop playing 
### Laurie Wackier Staff writer 
When Estevan Avila banged up his
hand in football practice on Wednesday,
Coach Dennis Green probably wasn't
too concerned. Even when the X-rays
showed a cracked bone in his thumb,
Green probably didn't start thinking
about reserve linemen. After all, Avila,
a six-foot-three-inch, 285-pound junior,
has come back from worse things than a
cracked thumb.
Knee surgery was enough to keep the
defensive tackle out — but not for long.
After suffering tears to the tendons in
his knee in the first half of the Arizona
game, Avila underwent orthoscopic
surgery. Doctors told him that he would
be on crutches for about six days. Avila
had his own ideas. Just four days after
surgery, he was walking; four days after
that, he donned his jersey for the Notre
Dame game.
"There was no reason to wait around
any longer," Avila said, adding that his
knee doesn't hinder his play at all now.
Although Avila downplays his quick
return to competition, Green was
impressed with his resiliency: "He's
playing really well. He showed true guts,
coming back on the field so soon after
surgery."
Green characterized Avila as a physi
cal player who "adds intensity because
he is so goal-oriented." This marks
Avila's second year as a starter at left
tackle: last year he amassed 39 total
tackles, including two games with six
tackles each. He has already recorded 26
tackles in six games this season.
A native of Sebastopol, California, a
small town in wine country, Avila chose
Stanford over Washington and Califor
nia. Avila said, "even in high school, I
knew Stanford was better than Cal —
and they haven't beaten me yet." In his
freshman year, the game against Cal
resulted in a tie. Last year, Avila's first
as a starter, Stanford was victorious in
Big Game.
According to Green, Avila will play a

role in Saturday's contest against
Oregon. The Ducks, who have lost three
quarterbacks to injuries, will have to
depend on their running game. That
means contending with Avila and the
rest of the defensive line.
Stanford has something to prove in
Oregon, where they suffered a 31-0 loss
last year. "They were a good team last

year, and we overlooked them. They're
still good, but this year, we're looking
right straight at them," Avila said of the
upcoming game.
The Cardinal will also be looking for
its fourth consecutive win. A victory in
Eugene would improve their record to 5-

Junior defensive lineman Estevan Aviia doesn't let anything stop him. Despite
knee surgery and a recent thumb injury, he has tallied 26 tackles in six games
this season.
3 overall and 3-2 in the Pac-10.
All of a sudden, the prospect of a
bowl game is not so remote.
"We all had a pre-season goal
of attending a bowl game," Avila

said. "Now it's back in the pic
ture. Our motto this year is to
take it all one step at a time."
For Estevan Avila, the first
step will be to stop Oregon's run
ning game and harass their young
quarterback. He'll have to take
that step with a cast on his hand.
But that won't stop him.
