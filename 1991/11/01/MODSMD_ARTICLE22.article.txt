# Card soccer's stompin'
## Men meet San Diego, shoot for tourney bid 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
What is the No. 30 Cardinal (10-3-5)
so psyched about? Not their match
against San Diego this weekend. Stan
ford's win over San Francisco on
Wednesday brought the team another
step closer to receiving one of the NCAA
Tournament bids.
This is not college basketball — we're
not talking about a mammoth, no-invi
tation-necessaiy March Madness type of
competition. The NCAA Soccer Tourna
ment is an elite 24-team event where
non-conference teams like Stanford (the
Pacific-10 does not have a soccer confer
ence) must vie for a small handful of at
large regional bids. Although it fielded
some excellent soccer teams in the early
eighties, the Cardinal has not advanced
to the tournament since 1978.
Lindores refused to let himself get
carried away by the thrill of the USF vic
tory. "We played well, but as coach, I've
got to look at the flaws in the game," he
said. "I can't afford to get so exuberant
about wins — that's the players'job."
The season, in effect, comes down to
Stanford's two remaining regular sea
son contests — home matches against
San Diego this Sunday and California on
Wednesday.
After a solid 1990 season, San Diego
has struggled this year, compiling a 6-9-
0 record to date. Nevertheless, the
Toreros have not been the victim of a
blowout to date, as Lindores was quick

to point out. "While they're not as good
as they were last year, all of their games
this season have been tight," he said.
In fact, the Toreros have given almost
every top Western team that they've
faced a run for the money, upsetting
Washington 2-1 and losing to UCLA and
San Diego State by slim 2-0 and 1-0 mar
gins, respectively.
"We £dl know that they're a pretty
good team," said Mann. "They've strug
gled a bit this year, but they're not going
to be a walkover." Lindores agreed with
Mann: "Although they're lacking some
thing this year, with a good game, they
could beat us."
