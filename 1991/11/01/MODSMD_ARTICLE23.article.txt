# Women aim to break record on Saturday

### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The women's team will cap off what
has certainly been the greatest season in
the history of Stanford soccer this Sat
urday as it looks to crush Northern Col
orado at Maloney Field.
The 15-1 Cardinal enters the game
after inexplicably having dropped a spot
to No. 7 in the national rankings despite
having reeled off four straight shutouts.
The Cardinal is expected to have an
easy time of things against Northern
Colorado. The Bears have posted a 4-4-2
record this season and are led offensive
ly by Kelli Hursh, who has four goals
and one assist on the season.
Should the Cardinal down the Bears this
weekend, they will eclipse the team record
for victories, set by the 1990 team that fin
ished the season 15-3-1. A 16-1 record
would make it extremely difficult for the
NCAA to deny Stanford a No. 1 seed.
"(Head coach) Berhane (Andeberhan)
told us to concentrate on playing this
game as if it were a playoff game," full
back Kerry "Yellow Card" Stivaletti
said. "We have to concentrate on
defense. . .It's important that we play
well together."
