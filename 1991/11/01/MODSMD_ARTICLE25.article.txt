# Men seek revenge against long-time foes

Each dual meet makes only a numerical
splash on the record of the Stanford men's
swimming team, but in terms of psychologi
cal importance, this weekend's meet against
defending NCAA champion Texas is a tidal
wave.
"Texas has won four years in a row. It's
our turn. It's time for us to move back up to
the top," said head coach Skip Kenney.
Co-captain Jeff Rouse will lead the Cardi
nal's indisputably impressive lineup. Rouse
currently holds the world record in the 100-

meter backstroke, set in a relay during this
summer's Pan Pacific Games.
Rouse won the 100 and 200 backstrokes
at the Pan Pacific games, as well as winning
last year's 100-yard competition at the
NCAA Championships.
Stanford will be depending upon its fresh
man swimmers and its freestylers, however,
to secure the win.
Freestyle is the most important stroke in
dual meets, since the freestyle events out
number the stroke events. In order to beat
the Longhorns, Stanford must excel in the
freestyle, an event that is not historically
their best.

Freestylers Erik Maurer, Stanford
record-holder in the 50 free, and Bill Schell
are the Cardinal's best bet to combat the
freestyle domination of Texas.
"Freestyle is where our recruiting
strength rests. We have quality freestylers in
the freshman class. The freshmen are still
trying to adjust to Stanford, but so are
Texas' frosh. The freshman class of one of
the two teams is going to win this meet,"
Kenney said.
Frosh Clay Tippins and Dan Kanner will get
a chance to show their potential in only their
second dual meet at Stanford, as they look to
help the Cardinal in the freestyle events.
