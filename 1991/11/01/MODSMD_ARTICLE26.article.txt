## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming team
obviously likes challenges. For the first dual
meet of the season, the Cardinal will take on
the Texas Longhorns in what would be bet
ter suited as a season's ending showdown
rather than a season opener.
For the past two years, Stanford has fin
ished second to the Lady Longhorns at
NCAAs. Will the Cardinal finally be able to
beat them this year?
Well, it is a tad early to be looking ahead to
NCAAs, however, tomorrow will be a good
opportunity to see some established Stanford

greats and to watch the debuts of some
future hopefuls.
Well, let's start with probably the best
woman swimmer in the country. Summer
Sanders returns for her sophomore season
with tons to offer. All she did last year in her
first year of collegiate swimming was win
three NCAA titles, all in NCAA record time,
and garner Swimmer of the Year honors.
Then we have junior Janel Jorgensen who
is ranked eighth in the world in 100 butter
fly. Junior Lori Heisick is also world-ranked,
in both the 100 and 200 breaststroke. For
her summer vacation, sophomore diver
Eileen Richetelli won a gold medal in plat
form diving at the Pan American Games.

Jenny Thompson, Maiy Ellen Blanchard,
and Julie Kole will be heading the newly
arrived frosh force. Thompson is world
ranked in 50 freestyle (sixth), 100 free (sev
enth), and 200 free (13th). Blanchard is sev
enth in the world in 200 individual medly,
and eighth in the nation in 200 breast. Kole
is 20th in the world in 400 free.
