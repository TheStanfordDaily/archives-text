Stanford's men's tennis team
kicks off its fall season tomorrow
in the regional qualifiers of the
Rolex Invitational Tennis Tour
nament held at St. Mary's College
in Moraga.
Coach Dick Gould is sending
eight players with the notable
exception of senior All-American
Alex O'Brien, who received an
automatic invitation to the actual
tournament and, as a result, does
not have to compete in the quali
fying rounds.
Senior Jason Yee, the Cardi
nal's other All-American, leads
juniors Roman Sydorak and Ken
Pedroza and the sophomore
nucleus of the team, Michael
Flanagan, Vimal Patel, Chris
Cocotos, Robert Devins and Billy
Wright.
"These tournaments are always
a good indication of how thing√ü are
going," Yee said. "We're working
on little bits of our games now that
we won't have time to later on in
the season."

Gould will be trying out a few
doubles combinations this
weekend: Patel and Cocotos will
team up, as will Flanagan and
Devins. Yee and Wright will also
play together to "give Jason
some doubles practice, since he
would ordinarily be playing
with Alex."
The Rolex Regionals will be
the first tournament of the fall
season for virtually the entire
team with the exception of
O'Brien, Yee and Flanagan, who
competed two weeks ago in the
Volvo Tennis Collegiate Champi
onships in Dallas, Texas.
The No. 3 Cardinal has a
mayor challenge ahead of itself
after the decisions of Jonathan
Stark and Jared Palmer to turn
professional in July. Palmer won
the NCAA singles championship
last season and the two were
ranked as the top doubles team
for much of the season.
"Being ranked third is a little
high for us at this point in the
season," Gould said. "We have to
prove that we belong there and it
will be a tough challenge.
