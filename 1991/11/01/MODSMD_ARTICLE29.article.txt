# Defending NCAA champs are back
## Card hosts NorCals 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
The women's tennis team
will play host to the Rolex
Northern California Women's
Tennis Championships today
through Monday at Stanford
Tennia Stadium. The field will
include the top 64 players from
twelve Northwestern schools,
including nationally-ranked
representatives from Califor
nia, Pacific, Nevada-Reno, and
Washington.
The six-time defending
NCAA champion Cardinal has
more than its fair share of talent
in the draw. Seeded No. 1 in the
tournament is sophomore All-
American Kristine Kurth.
Freshman Kim Shasby will
make her debut for Stanford as
the No. 2 seed, followed by
sophomore Ail-American Laxmi
Poruri and senior Kylie Johnson
at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively.

Kurth and Shasby will pair
up as the top-seeded doubles
team, while Johnson and
sophomore Emma Woodhouse
are the third-seeded tandem.
Since it is very early in the
year, the tournament will give
the players a look at the compe
tition and a chance to evaluate
where they stand in compari
son to it. Although it is an indi
vidual tournament, the fact
that eight Stanford players will
be competing adds a team ele
ment to it as well.
"It's another tournament
that enlightens you to who's
around," Johnson said.
The support of the home
crowd could also play a big role
in the players' performances.
Action will run all day today
and begin at 9 a.m. Saturday
and 10 a.m. Sunday. The sin
gles and doubles finals will
begin at 1 p.m. Monday. Admis
sion is free.
