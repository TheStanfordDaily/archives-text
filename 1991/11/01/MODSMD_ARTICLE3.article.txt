# Peace group looks at military research

### Annie Decker 
After eight months of quiet fol
lowing the Persian Gulf war, sev
eral campus activists have tried to
rekindle a debate on the relation
ship between Stanford and the
U.S. military.
According to a leaflet distribut
ed this week by Students for Peace,
a group founded last year to oppose
the war, "positive alternatives"
should be considered to combat the
strong "relationship between
academia and military interests."
The group attacked what it said
was an over-emphasis on military
research in universities.
But several faculty members
say relatively little of Stanford's
current research is specifically
geared for the military.
Until about 20 years ago, the
University received government

contracts for specific military
purposes. During the Vietnam
War, however, Stanford imple
mented a rule that no future
research could be classified.
As a result, government re
search now is primarily for the
"support of graduate education
and the advancement of knowl
edge," said Joseph Jezukewicz,
director of the Electrical Engi
neering Research Administration.
But technical research can lead
to incidental military uses, said
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center.
"The basic goal of the re
searcher is to deepen the basic
understanding of nature, yet
most research inevitably spins off
into the practical sector," he said.
For example, seemingly innocu
ous research led eventually to the
development of nuclear weapons
and military radars, Drell said.
In the Department of Materials
Science and Engineering, one area
of government-funded research
focuses on the use of high-temper
ature materials in gas-turbine
engines. Both the government and
civilian companies could apply
such knowledge, said department
chair William Nix.
.According to Students for
Peace, which has a core member
ship of about five people, govern
ment should redistribute funds
designated for military research
to meet "our most critical human
and environmental needs."
"Stanford has zero control
over the distribution of funding,"
said member Gabe Kahn, a
senior. "Our basic criticism is of

the government."
The group's position is that the
"availability of (government) fund
ing can be an incentive for students
to focus their work on areas of
interest to the military even if they
would rather devote their time and
energy to other projects."
David Barnett, chair of the
Applied Mechanics Division of
Mechanical Engineering, said he
does not believe that the school or
the government have strong con
trol over the content of the
research. "It all comes down to
the individual investigator. The
researchers range from conserva
tive to liberal, but I have not yet
met anyone who wants to work
for the military."
"Professors above all else want
to find out the fundamentals of
engineering and science. They
want to answer questions," he said.
"Most cannot have the foresight
to predict what their research will
affect," he said. "Yet [professors]
have high ethical consciences.
They want to do the 'right thing."'
