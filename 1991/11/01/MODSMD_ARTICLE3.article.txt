# Peace group looks at military research

After eight months of quiet fol
lowing the Persian Gulf war, sev
eral campus activists have tried to
rekindle a debate on the relation
ship between Stanford and the
U.S. military.
According to a leaflet distribut
ed this week by Students for Peace,
a group founded last year to oppose
the war, "positive alternatives"
should be considered to combat the
strong "relationship between
academia and military interests."
The group attacked what it said
was an over-emphasis on military
research in universities.
But several faculty members
say relatively little of Stanford's
current research is specifically
geared for the military.
Until about 20 years ago, the
University received government

contracts for specific military
purposes. During the Vietnam
War, however, Stanford imple
mented a rule that no future
research could be classified.
As a result, government re
search now is primarily for the
"support of graduate education
and the advancement of knowl
edge," said Joseph Jezukewicz,
director of the Electrical Engi
neering Research Administration.
But technical research can lead
to incidental military uses, said
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center.
"The basic goal of the re
searcher is to deepen the basic
understanding of nature, yet
most research inevitably spins off
into the practical sector," he said.
