# Card, Bear spikers star in Bay rivalry
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
California's spikers aren't
exactly the Minnesota Twins of
volleyball, but Stanford coach
Don Shaw is treating them as if
they were. The No. 1 Cardinal
faces the Golden Bears tonight at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion, and
Shaw is not underestimating
Cal's abilities at all.
"The more I watch them on
film, the better they look," Shaw
said.
The Golden Bears were picked
to finish ninth in the Pacific 10
Conference this year after finish
ing last in 1990, but they have
turned their program around
remarkably. After a slow start,
they have definitely become the
surprise team of the season. Cal
is currently fourth in the Pac-10
with a 7-4 conference record, and
is one of the few teams that have
won a game from Stanford this
season. The Cardinal defeated the
Bears 15-3, 15-3, 15-17, 15-11 on
Sept. 25 at Cal.

"I'd say they're one of the most
improved teams in the country,"
Shaw said.
So contrary to past years,
Stanford will not be able to sleep
walk through this Big Game
match against the Bears. Cal is
led by sophomore setter Sienna
Curci, who was Pac-10 Women's
Volleyball Co-Player of the Week
last week, and senior hitter Mor
gan Cecil, who leads the team in
kills and is second in digs and
blocks. Curci led the Bears to a
sweep last week of Washington
and Washington State, finishing
off the Cougars in the decisive
fifth game with two jump serve
aces.
Stanford is coming off a fairly
flat performance against San Jose
State last Tuesday night and
plans to pick up the intensity
against its Bay Area rival. Shaw
said that after seeing films of
Tuesday's match, he felt that the
Cardinal did not play too badly
against the Spartans, but he
expected the team to raise its level
of performance considerably
against the Bears.
"If we come out like [we did
against San Jose State], we're
definitely in trouble," Shaw said.
Despite the pressure of
midterms and a midweek game,
Shaw said that practices have
been good and the players have
kept their intensity level high.

On the medical front for Stan
ford, doctors are 90 percent sure
that junior Laurie Sawin has a
broken nose, but Shaw said he
expected her to practice yesterday
and hopefully play tonight.
The match will be broadcast
live by KZSU-90.1 FM with Rick
Seidel on the play-by-play and
Chris Crader on color. During the
match, the volleyball which Stan
ford graduate Tamy Jernigan
took with her on the space shuttle
Columbia will be presented back
to Stanford in a special ceremony.
