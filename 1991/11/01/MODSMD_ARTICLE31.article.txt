# Water polo to sink 'SC
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Today at 3 p.m. at deGuerre
Pool, the men's water polo team
will face its first obstacle to secure
an NCAA Championship berth in
the form of No. 7 USC, another
team also on the brink of elimina
tion from postseason play.
After its best performance of
the year last weekend, the Cardi
nal has put itself back in the
running to qualify for NCAAs.
This week, the team received
some more good news, as the lat
est coaches' poll has moved the
Cardinal up to No. 4 in the
nation.
Only five teams from Califor
nia can be invited to the champi
onships — in other words, the top
five teams in the country — so it
seems that Stanford is right
where it wants to be. But here
comes the bad news.
"The coaches' poll really
doesn't count as far as the NCAA
is concerned," coach Dante Detta
manti explained. "The NCAA
uses its own criterion to deter
mine who are the top teams, and
if you go by how they see it, we
are now in a solid sixth position."
The team right ahead of Stan
ford is Long Beach State, but

according to Dettamanti, his team
is only worried about its own
games. "We just need to take care
of ourselves and win our games.
If we lose a key game, then it real
ly doesn't matter if Long Beach
loses, because we'll still be behind
them."
It was the game against USC
when Stanford turned its season
around with a 6-4 upset of the
Trojans, and Dettamanti expects
an equally tight game this time
around. "It should be a very close
game," he said. "Only this time, I
expect it'll be a lot higher scoring.
We have to play really good
defense like we did last time,
because they're a very explosive
offensive team."
In the earlier win, Jack Bowen
started in goal for the Cardinal,
but on a hunch, Dettamanti
replaced him with former starter
Larry Bercutt in the second half.
The move paid off as Bercutt
played perhaps his best game of
the year and shut out the Trojans.
In fact, Bercutt has continued
to excel in the goal. As Detta
manti said, "Ever since the USC
game, he's been playing the way
he's capable of playing."
And so has the whole Stanford
team, as winning big games has
become a bit of a habit.
