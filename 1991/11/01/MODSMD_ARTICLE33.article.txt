Dear Bug Me,
What happens to a fly if it gets stuck in your car
and you let it out 100 miles from its original locale?
â€” Anxious animal-lover
Last summer I took a trip from my home to an
amusement park that was about 100 miles away. On
the way to the park I noticed a fly in the car, but for
got to let him out when I got there. After a wonder
fully hot and sunny day at the park, I came back to
find the fly upside down on my dash.
So, the effect of a 100-mile location change on a
fly seems plain: death. Hence, if you discover a fly
in your car during a long trip, the only humane
action is clear: Drive back home and set the little
fella free.
Stanford's Ward Watt, professor of biological
sciences, however, claims the fly would most likely
just go about its business completely unaware of its
transportation. Since flies are essentially non-ter
ritorial, solitary critters, there is nothing inherent
ly better or worse about one location or another.
Bonus Fun Fact: If you put a live fly in your
freezer, it will enter a frozen state of suspended ani
mation. Then, if you let it thaw out, even weeks
later, it will be as good as new. No kidding.
