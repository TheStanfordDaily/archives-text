# Cruising in a cranky car can be a nightmare
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
I never really wanted a car.
To me, car owners at Stanford were
just lazy people with extra cash, stu
dents who actually drove to Flicks and
who had people constantly schmooz
ing them to get a ride to Safeway.
No, I didn't need one of those envi
ronmentally harmful, gas-guzzling
death-traps on wheels. I didn't even
enjoy driving very much, probably due
to a traumatic experience I had back in
second grade when I tried to discover
exactly what would happen if I rode
my Big Wheel at top speed over a 10-
foot embankment.
And of course, I figured the chance of
my parents giving me a car was about the
same as that of Dean Jean going on to
become a go-go dancer. But then again, I
didn't take my sister into account.
Yes, my 16-year-old sister, the same
sister who once detonated a live ham
ster in our microwave, somehow
brainwashed my parents into buying
her a convertible last summer, despite
the fact that the majority of her driv
ing experience had been in bumper
cars at Great America.
Not that I am bitter. Certainly not
as bitter as when my freshman room-

mate melted down my
collection of Pez dis
pensers. No, this time
my parents decided
they couldn't be com
pletely unfair, and so
I ended up with our
12-year-old, 40-ton
family station wagon.
Suddenly, I had
wheels. Sure, these

particular wheels had approximately
the same turning radius as the Space
Shuttle, but somehow that seemed
unimportant. My mind reeled with the
possibilities. I could roadtrip to Los
Angeles every weekend. Celebrating
my birthday at Chuck E. Cheese's no
longer seemed a remote fantasy. And
best of all, I might even be able to visit
my friends over in Sterling Quad.
But first, I had to get the family
truckster over the Rockies.
I actually considered having the car
airlifted, but in the end I decided it
would be better to have a good, old
fashioned, cross-country road trip. So,
my roommate and I piled our stuff in
the back, took off across the plains and
after several long, hard days of driv
ing, finally broke down in Wyoming.
Now, those of you who have actual
ly been to this fun and exciting state

know that it is just about the most
deserted place in North America, with
the possible exception of Cubberley
Library. Fortunately, we happened to
be in the vicinity of trained gas station
attendants, who were well versed in
the little-known "hammer" technique
for repairing broken-down automo
biles.
This technique, which I swear I am
not making up, consists of crawling
under the car with a hammer and then
very carefully banging the hell out of
everything in sight.
My roommate and I were skeptical
at first, but to our amazement, the car
actually started on the first try, and
soon we were moving right along.
And before I knew it, we were on
the fabulous west coast, where I dis
covered that having the car wasn't so
great after all. For example, the wagon
can't quite make a U-turn on Campus
Drive, and even El Camino can be dif
ficult if there are cars parked in the far
lane.
Plus, I discovered that owning a car
can be very expensive. Besides spend
ing a bunch on insurance, you buy
tons of gas, get a couple of parking
tickets, finally give in and buy a per
mit, then get some more tickets for
parking in the wrong lot, then get even

more tickets when you can't move
your car because it won't start and
finally spend $15 on an emergency
hammer.
And that's not even counting the
upkeep. My car has gotten to the point
where it needs an oil change about
every 30 miles, and every time I have it
done the friendly mechanics tell me
that some obscure but nonetheless
vital part of my car needs to be
replaced.
"Yeah, this loose fella here is a bro
ken fly spurtergratchet," they tell me
in a knowledgeable tone of voice. "Ya
probably want to get this fixed, unless
you want to fibulate your transfluxer,
which will probably cause your engine
to caulerseizure."
I nod and smile, pretending to know
what they are talking about, and usu
ally end up handing over a significant
amount of cash. •
But regardless, it's great to have a
car, even if it is a pain in the butt. It's
given me a whole new level of freedom,
sort of like taking something pass/no
clue. And don't even bother asking me
for a ride to Safeway. The keys are
behind the front left tire.

Ken Wharton is an undeclared senior and
is allergic to most kinds of vegetables.

Library. Fortunately, we happened to
be in the vicinity of trained gas station
attendants, who were well versed in
the little-known "hammer" technique
for repairing broken-down automo
biles.
This technique, which I swear I am
not making up, consists of crawling
under the car with a hammer and then
very carefully banging the hell out of
everything in sight.
My roommate and I were skeptical
at first, but to our amazement, the car
actually started on the first try, and
soon we were moving right along.
And before I knew it, we were on
the fabulous west coast, where I dis
covered that having the car wasn't so
great after all. For example, the wagon
can't quite make a U-turn on Campus
Drive, and even El Camino can be dif
ficult if there are cars parked in the far
lane.
Plus, I discovered that owning a car
can be very expensive. Besides spend
ing a bunch on insurance, you buy
tons of gas, get a couple of parking
tickets, finally give in and buy a per
mit, then get some more tickets for
parking in the wrong lot, then get even

more tickets when you can't move
your car because it won't start and
finally spend $15 on an emergency
hammer.
And that's not even counting the
upkeep. My car has gotten to the point
where it needs an oil change about
every 30 miles, and every time I have it
done the friendly mechanics tell me
that some obscure but nonetheless
vital part of my car needs to be
replaced.
"Yeah, this loose fella here is a bro
ken fly spurtergratchet," they tell me
in a knowledgeable tone of voice. "Ya
probably want to get this fixed, unless
you want to fibulate your transfluxer,
which will probably cause your engine
to caulerseizure."
I nod and smile, pretending to know
what they are talking about, and usu
ally end up handing over a significant
amount of cash. •
But regardless, it's great to have a
car, even if it is a pain in the butt. It's
given me a whole new level of freedom,
sort of like taking something pass/no
clue. And don't even bother asking me
for a ride to Safeway. The keys are
behind the front left tire.
