# Reach out Saturday
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
A week-long program designed
to give about 1,000 students a taste
of public service will have its finale
Saturday when more than 60 Stan
ford groups volunteer locally.
The eighth annual "Reach Out
Today," sponsored by the Stanford
Volunteer Network and the Haas
Center for Public Service, started
with an AIDS Walk last Sunday.
"We are hoping [volunteers)
will be interested in making a
long-term commitment to public
service," said Erron Al-Amin,
chair of the Volunteer Network.
"As Stanford students we should
be doing more for the communi
ties around us."

Al-Amin said Saturday's volun
teer activities, organized by resi
dences and campus groups, will
include between 600 and 1,200 stu
dents.
For example, Twain House resi
dents will participate in a voter-reg
istration drive among homeless and
low-income families with a hunger
and homelessness action group.
Kimball Hall will be involved
in a mural painting, and Robin
son house residents will plant
trees with inner-city youth at a
high school in East Oakland.
Al-Amin said this year's educa
tional programs about issues rang
ing from homelessness to the envi
ronment should make students
think about "the larger issues"
behind the service they do.
