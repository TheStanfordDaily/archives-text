# Cabinet sends new sex assault rules back for revision
## 
### Miranda Doyle Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
The University Cabinet re
turned a new sexual assault policy
to its authors yesterday for clarifi
cation, promising approval after
changes are made in the definition
of assault and stipulations on the
role of alcohol are narrowed.
Under the most recent draft of
the policy, "Sexual assault by
force or coercion, including coer
cion through the use of alcohol, is
absolutely unacceptable at Stan
ford University." Violators are
subject to "maximum institution
al sanctions" in addition to any
outside prosecution.
According to Sally Mahoney,
acting vice president for student
resources, the Cabinet "asked us
to clarify the language and we'll
do that" before bringing it back.
"I thought the matters were
minor."

She declined to say whether
the policy would be brought back
for review at the next Cabinet
meeting two weeks from now.
But Mahoney said, "Now we
just have to figure out what we
have to do to clean this up and get
it out. We intend to work with all
deliberate speed."
The University Cabinet and
Operations Council — the two
branches of the President's office
that review University-wide poli
cies — also reaffirmed their com
mitment to Stanford's current
policy on sexual harassment.
Mahoney and Vice President of
Human Resources Barbara But
terfield brought the new rules
before the Cabinet.
The Cabinet and Council also
endorsed an ongoing staff effort
to clarify the procedures for
reporting and handling incidents
of sexual harassment and assault.
Once the revisions in language
are made, the policy will be
brought back before the Cabinet,
and if endorsed, will be forwarded
to University President Donald
Kennedy. Officials expect that he
will approve the policy and
attempt to link it to the current
sexual harassment policy through
a broad, overarching statement.
The sexual assault policy,
which applies to all members of
the Stanford community, was
prompted by a state law — passed
in January — requiring colleges
to implement assault policies and
adopt written procedures insur
ing that sexual assault victims
receive appropriate treatment
and information.

Law School Prof. Robert Weis
berg said that while the policy
does not completely mirror laws
outlined in the California penal
code, "it is roughly consistent
with criminal laws."
However, Stanford's policy
"probably coyers a somewhat
wider range of conduct, is easier
to prove and aggregates a wide
variety of criminal-type rules
under a single policy," he said.
Several aspects of the policy
came under scrutiny of the Cabi
net yesterday, including its defini
tion of sexual assault and pas
sages pertaining to the role of
alcohol in sexual assault.
According to the policy, sexual
assault "includes, but is not limit
ed to, rape, forced sodomy, forced
oral copulation, rape by a foreign
object, sexual battery, or threat of
sexual assault."
Weisberg said the vaguest term

in the definition is "sexual bat
tery," because "it could include
any physical conduct of a forcible
nature." If a person fondles or
tries to hug someone who does not
want to be touched, he added, it
could be considered sexual battery.
Under the policy, sexual assault
involving "coercion through the
use of alcohol" is unacceptable — a
reference that is at the center of
some of the proposed changes, said
Gaiy Ernst, dean of the School of
Earth Sciences.
"It has to be clear that the use
of alcohol had to be a device to
further the assault" and that it is
not acceptable to "use alcohol as a
weapon," Ernst said.
Weisberg said if a woman
becomes intoxicated of her own
volition, and a man knowingly
exploits her condition to gain her
apparent consent, "that may well
be sexual assault under" the pro
posed policy.
But under California law,
there would probably not be a
conviction unless "the woman is
virtually unconscious.
"I don't think that degree of
intoxication would be necessary
to prove sexual assault" under the

new policy, he said.
Weisberg added that a case
where one person coerces another
into drinking and then has inter
course with her when she is
unable to resist would also be con
sidered sexual assault.
Also, the inclusion of "the
threat of sexual assault" under
the definition of sexual assault
could include a verbal threat, but
there would be "proof problems,"
Weisberg said. It is "not impossi
ble" that a verbal threat would be
considered a violation of the poli
cy.
Ernst said the policy "wasn't
discussed very long" in the Cabi
net meeting yesterday because
the wording was not clear enough.
"It was very general," he said.
"It had to be made a little more spe
cific, specific enough so that you
can decide if it was sexual assault."
University efforts to develop a
comprehensive policy were fueled
by demands from the Sexual
Assault Task Force.
What remains to be developed
now are the specific procedures by
which incidents of sexual miscon
duct are to be reported and han
dled.
