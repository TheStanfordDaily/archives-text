# Cabinet sends new sex assault rules back for revision
## 
### Miranda Doyle Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
The University Cabinet re
turned a new sexual assault policy
to its authors yesterday for clarifi
cation, promising approval after
changes are made in the definition
of assault and stipulations on the
role of alcohol are narrowed.
Under the most recent draft of
the policy, "Sexual assault by
force or coercion, including coer
cion through the use of alcohol, is
absolutely unacceptable at Stan
ford University." Violators are
subject to "maximum institution
al sanctions" in addition to any
outside prosecution.
According to Sally Mahoney,
acting vice president for student
resources, the Cabinet "asked us
to clarify the language and we'll
do that" before bringing it back.
"I thought the matters were
minor."

She declined to say whether
the policy would be brought back
for review at the next Cabinet
meeting two weeks from now.
But Mahoney said, "Now we
just have to figure out what we
have to do to clean this up and get
it out. We intend to work with all
deliberate speed."
The University Cabinet and
Operations Council — the two
branches of the President's office
that review University-wide poli
cies — also reaffirmed their com
mitment to Stanford's current
policy on sexual harassment.
Mahoney and Vice President of
Human Resources Barbara But
terfield brought the new rules
before the Cabinet.
The Cabinet and Council also
endorsed an ongoing staff effort
to clarify the procedures for
reporting and handling incidents
of sexual harassment and assault.
