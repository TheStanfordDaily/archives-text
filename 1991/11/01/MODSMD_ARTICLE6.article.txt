# Assault, harassment policies to be distinct
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Last January, the Sexual
Assault Task Force recommended
that "the University develop and
adopt a formal written policy" on
unacceptable sexual conduct,
which would recognize that
"there is a range of sexual con
duct that is unacceptable in the
Stanford community."
Soon after the recommenda
tions were released, University offi
cials began writing a preliminary
draft of a sexual conduct policy.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole and Legal Counsel Susan
Hoerger drafted several versions
of the broad-based policy over the
months that followed, and most
officials involved with the process
expected the policy to be institut
ed by the end of Fall quarter.
According to Cole, however,
the development of such a broad
policy was taking a long time, and
the University needed to imple
ment a policy on sexual assault
more quickly, due to a state law
