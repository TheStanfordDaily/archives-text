# Assault, harassment policies to be distinct
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Last January, the Sexual
Assault Task Force recommended
that "the University develop and
adopt a formal written policy" on
unacceptable sexual conduct,
which would recognize that
"there is a range of sexual con
duct that is unacceptable in the
Stanford community."
Soon after the recommenda
tions were released, University offi
cials began writing a preliminary
draft of a sexual conduct policy.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole and Legal Counsel Susan
Hoerger drafted several versions
of the broad-based policy over the
months that followed, and most
officials involved with the process
expected the policy to be institut
ed by the end of Fall quarter.
According to Cole, however,
the development of such a broad
policy was taking a long time, and
the University needed to imple
ment a policy on sexual assault
more quickly, due to a state law
— passed in January — that
required such a statement.
So a policy on sexual assault
was brought before the Opera
tions Council and Cabinet this
week. The policy is distinct from
the University Policy on Sexual
Harassment that has existed
since 1987 because of a federal
law. Over the next few months, a
comprehensive package on unac
ceptable sexual conduct will be
devised by several staff members
that unifies both policies.
"What I envision is a set of doc
uments — which we are describ

ing as a package — that will
include a single overarching state
ment on the topic of unacceptable
sexual conduct in the University
setting, describing why it is unac
ceptable and defining what we are
talking about," Cole said.
Cole said the package will also
include distinct policies on sexual
harassment and sexual assault, as
well as a catalog of resources and
procedures for people who feel
they have been sexually harassed
or assaulted.
Protocol set up in this package
will describe mechanisms by which
individuals can file complaints of
sexual assault and sexual harass
ment. The procedures may include
specific protocols for different
units of the University, such as the

Medical Center and the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
According to Sally Mahoney,
technical and legal reasons
require separation of the policies.
"The two policies have to be
seen together, because they are
complements," she said. But'they
have to address different issues
differently, particularly in respect
to external obligations, "which
include policy requirements by
federal and state law."
In addition, the policies address
different types of offenses, accord
ing to Doug Dupen, who works in
Human Resources. Harassment is
a civil offense that is governed by
federal law and civil codes.
Assault, however, is a criminal
offense and is governed by crimi

nal laws, he said.
Mahoney said that separating
the two policies will not detract
from the message they send to the
community. The two are "related,
linked, complementary," she said.
"And the two policies together
will address the full continuum"
of unacceptable behavior.
Susan Epstein, the sexual
assault prevention education
coordinator, said the impact of
the policies will depend on how
they are communicated to the
community. She said she did not
know that there were to be two
distinct policies rather than one,
broad-based one.
"Philosophically, in a lot of
ways it would have been nice if
there was one policy," she said.
