# Celebrating life on 'Day of the Dead'

"The Mexican is the only one
who makes death come alive."
— Angel Zamarripa
El Dia de los Muertos — which
Ls being celebrated by Stanford's
Chicano/Latino community today
— is a time when "Mexicans look
at death in the face and laugh at

it," said recent graduate Martin
Gonzalez.
"Death isn't seen as something
to be scared of," he added. "It's
the beginning of another life."
Many Chicano/Latino stu
dents will celebrate "The Day of
the Dead" through laughter,
music and reverence.
El Dia de los Muertos stems
from the ancient Aztec-Indian

custom of celebrating death as a
natural part of life. Although
mourning and grief existed in
the Aztec culture, festivities and
humor were used as coping
mechanisms.
Mocking death provided com
fort, whereas fear and dread of
death did not. "Given the histo
ry of the Mexican people, oppres
sion and death were a real part

of their lives," Casa Zapata Res
ident Assistant Monica Gonza
lez said. "They dealt with death
by making light of it."
"To me, it is the most inter
esting holiday for Mexicans,"
said recent graduate Anita De
Lucio. "It is an example of how
two cultures — Spanish Catholi
cism and indigenous Aztec civi
lization — came together."
Typical ways of celebrating
include dressing up and dancing
in skeleton costumes, buying
pan de muerto (bread in the
shape of a dead person) or
preparing skull-shaped candy.
El Dia de los Muertos is also
the occasion to pay respect to
deceased loved ones. "I remem
ber cleaning off the graves of my
relatives," said junior Lorena
Montenegro, who lived in Duran
go, Mexico when she was young.

to buy flowers with my grand
mother in Chihuahua, Mexico"
and then "paying tribute to my
dead relatives."
Alma Medina, co-chair of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, described the vari
ety of traditions throughout
Mexico. "Many people celebrate
(the holiday) privately, building
altars in their homes," while
others engage in public festivi
ties that are "expensive and
elaborate," she said.
Altars have been constructed
at Rains, Casa Zapata, the Roble
dance studio and El Centro Chi
cano. Students can decorate the
altars with pictures or names of
their deceased family and
friends.

and adorning them with candles,
food, flowers, momentos and pic
tures of the deceased. "My grand
mother liked walnuts and Diet
Coke, so I bought those and will
put them on the altar I made," De
Lucio said.
She also described the Marigold
flower as a popular ornament
because it "symbolized the Aztec
goddess of death — the aroma
reminded them (the Aztec Indi
ans) of the smell of death."
"The scents of the flowers and
the food are to attract the souls of
the dead — to guide them home,"
said Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro.

Many people eat and drink at
the tombs as if they are, indeed,
sharing a meal with the souls of
the dead. The time for remem
brance is set apart from the rest
of the festivities; masses are often
held to honor those who have
passed away.
The celebrations of El Dia de
los Muertos will be open to the
public. Organizers said people
who traditionally pay their
respects to deceased friends or
family in private are encouraged
to join together with other mem
bers of the Stanford community.
Several students said the Day
of the Dead is a central facet of
Chicano/Latino life. De Lucio
expressed a common feeling in
the
community with an old quota
tion: "How a culture reacts to
death reveals how it looks at life."
