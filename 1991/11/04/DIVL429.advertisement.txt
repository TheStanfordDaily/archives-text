ASSU NEWS
WHAT IS THE ASSU?
Stanford student government is composed of four separate units:
executive, legislative, administrative, and financial.
This issue will spotlight the financial office.
The financial office runs under the direction of Michael Risch (5-1461),
the student Financial Manager. His staff includes four student assis
tants, a small permanent accounting staff, as well as the managers and
staffs of the ASSU business projects.
The financial unit runs business projects, maintains ASSU accounts,
and provides banking services for all registered student groups. The
University contributes $150,000 annually to the ASSU for this last
service, one which the University would have to provide if theASSU
didn't. Aside from this operation, the ASSU is wholly self-supporting.
The ASSU supports itself mainly through the success of its businesses:
Sunday Flicks, Lecture Notes, Shirt Shak, Type & Design, Ad Agency,
Linen Service, Beat the Bookstore, Airport Shuttle and its new business,
Friday Classic Flicks.
The financial manager, the assistants, and the business project manag
ers are selected annually in the winter and spring and confirmed by the
Senate. These positions, though perhaps not the most glamorous, pay
real money: the Financial Manager earns $12,000 per year; project
managers can earn large bonuses.
This year's innovations in the financial branch include Friday Classics,
computerized fee refunds, and new budgeting procedures which
simplify accounting and reduce student fees.
If you are intested in working for the financial branch, stop by the ASSU
and talk to a few of the business managers.

GUILTY?
'l'ic!\ a tPrez
The Axe WANTED
Last year, out of concern for sexual assualt
survivors, the University charged its judicial
policy committee, the Committee of 15 (C-15),
with revising the burden of proof in student
conduct cases. The committee, chaired by law
professor Deborah Rhode, proposed changing the
burden of proof from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to "clear and convinicng evidence," to
encourage complaintants to come forward. The
report also includes provisions for the University
to subpoena witnesses under threat of suspension
and shield laws which prevent a complainant's
sexual history from being inappropriately used in
a hearing.
These changes are anything but simple. First of
all, they directly violate Section IV, 2.9 of the
ASSU Constitution which explidty requires
University processes to hold students "innocent
until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."
University administrators have encouraged the
Senate to put "substance" over "process."
The changes would apply not only to sexual
assault cases, but to all judicial cases. For this
reason, if the changes are fully adopted, plagia
rism and cheating convictions could be based
soley on rircumstantial evidence. In fact, Profes
sor Rhode was quoted in last week's Stanford
Review as saying that only a sixty-five to ninety
percent chance of guilt is required for a convic
tion under this standard.
Because of their concerns, COP members Beth
Morgan and John Overdeck have introduced a
bill rejecting many of the changes set forth by C
15. See it fought out at the Senate tomorrow at 7
pm in Law School 190.
University President Donald Kennedy resigned his
post this summer, effective August 1992. While the
Board of Trustees has the ultimate responsibility for
selecting the next president, an ad hoc committee
made up of six trustees, six faculty, one alumna,
one staff member, and one student will interview
the candidates and make a recommendation to the
Trustees.
The one student chosen is Kasi Allen Fuller, a grad
student in educationwho recieved her BA in math
history in 1986. She is also the Resident Fellow in
Manzanita. In order to give her a better idea of
what you think are important Presidental qualities,
we have placed a box in the ASSU where you can
drop off suggestions. Tell us what characteristics
you think are vital for Stanford's next president.
Despite concerted efforts by the COP and Senate
Chair Kevin Warsh, the Trustees decided to place
only one student on the ad hoc committee. We're
still hoping to have finalists to meet with a diverse
group of students. We feel that at least 10 or 15
students are necessary to jit a reasonable cross
section of opinions. This process was followed in
1980 when President Kennedy was selected. Good
sense mandates that it happen again.

On Oct. 22, the University told us just where it
would give us the Axe — a $43 million budget axe
that is. The University was split into 22 budgetary
units, including the seven schools and eleven Vice
President areas. Each school will take between a
7% and 9% cut. The VP area cuts ranged from
9.5% to 20%. All programs are on the chopping
block- Residential Education, libraries, Informa
tion Resources, interdepartmental programs, and
the performing arts.
The COP held two town meetings on October 3
and 7 in Cubberley Aud. Influential University
administrators including President Kennedy,
Dean Thomas of Humanities and Sciences, Dean
Spence of the GSB, Associate Dean Kruger of
Engineering, and Professor Pat Jones of Biology
were on hand to answer questions and listen to
students' opinions.
In order to get more student input, the COP
successfully fought for several student positions
on influential University budgetary committees,
both at the unit and advisory levels. Don't let
these valuable openings go to waste. Applications
are available in the ASSU and are due TODAY!!
These dedsions will affect the mission and opera
tion of Stanford for many years to come. Make
your voice heard!
