Opportunities through Volunteers in Asia
Near the end of my freshman year I realized, even
though I was taking great courses, there was an
education I wasn't getting., one that could only be
found outside the classroom. A year later I was
teaching English in a government health department
office in Bali. It was one of the best moves I ever made.

I intended to pursue a medical degree when I re
turned from Asia, so I applied for deferred admission.
Basically, you'd be crazy not to take time off before
medical school. The time and opportunities to do
things like VIA just don't exist once you begin.
--Jay Crary, Stanford Medical School Student (China 1987)
I hope to gain more intimate knowledge of a
country and its people. I hope to gain teaching
skills, and experience that will be an asset as
I look for future work in an international
field. And I hope to grow personally.
