# Film students zoom in on directing

Stanford may not be Holly
wood, but for some student
filmmakers the Documentary
Film Program in the Communi
cation Department is one of the
best training grounds in the
country.
Almost every year, a stu
dent in the Documentary Film
Program wins either a Student
Academy Award or an Emmy
Award, according to Sue Mar
coux, who received a master's
degree in communication in
April.
Marcoux won a Student
Academy Award for her thesis
documentary "Twinsburg,
Ohio: Some Kind Of Weird
Twin Thing." Her film aired
on PBS in the "Point of View"
series of independent docu
mentaries in June.
While other film schools
usually teach various filming
techniques and genres, the
Stanford program particularly
focuses on the art of making
documentaries, Marcoux said.
As a result, students have
more time to get their hands
on all the technical facets of
the production.
"Unlike other film schools,
where you're assigned only one
role, here you do everything,"
she said. "You have room to
develop your own vision."

Graduate student Philippe Roques said he believes that the Documentary Film Program is one pro
gram "where people can express themselves freely." He is currently finishing his thesis documen
tary on the "Radical Faeries," a gay community on the West Coast.
Describing the advantages of
the program, third-year graduate
student Philippe Roques noted it
is "a program where people can
express themselves freely. You
can address any topic you want."
Roques is currently finishing a
thesis documentary on the "Radical
Faeries," a gay community on the
West Coast that affirms its own cul
ture by living close to nature.
During the first year of the
program, students get acquainted
with video and 16-millimeter
equipment, learn how to make
documentaries and gain experi
ence with all the technical intrica
cies behind them.
In the second year, students
are left to their own devices: They

have to produce a 15- to 30-
minute thesis documentary. "It's
up to you to find support, to
develop a network of relations,"
Marcoux said.
Marcoux's documentary focus
sed on the world of twins. Because
she had a twin sister whom she
had not seen for years, the subject
of the film touched on her person
al experience.
The film depicts "the struggle
to be an individual in the twin
system," she explained.
Roques said he chose the "Rad
ical Faeries" for his ethnographic
documentary because he believes
gays are underrepresented in
films and on television.
Unlike Marcoux, who utilized a
crew of five current and former
students in the program, Roques
went through the shooting pro
cess all alone, a task that was
often physically difficult. "I had to

schlepp the material through the
woods," he noted.
The greatest challenge Roques
encountered in filming the
Faeries was establishing contacts
in their community. "I had to do a
lot of work getting to know people
and gaining people's trust, so that
I would have access to really spe
cial moments," he said.
Roques said he learned a lot
from observing and sharing
moments with marginal people
like the Radical Faeries. He
explained, "It is very important for
people to find their own path, and
that's what the Faeries are about."
He chose a flexible structure
for his documentary, adding that
"often, it's the things that you're
not planning for, that just happen
on their own, that turn out to be
the most beautiful and the most
interesting (scenes), because they
occur organically."
