# Film students zoom in on directing

Stanford may not be Holly
wood, but for some student
filmmakers the Documentary
Film Program in the Communi
cation Department is one of the
best training grounds in the
country.
Almost every year, a stu
dent in the Documentary Film
Program wins either a Student
Academy Award or an Emmy
Award, according to Sue Mar
coux, who received a master's
degree in communication in
April.
Marcoux won a Student
Academy Award for her thesis
documentary "Twinsburg,
Ohio: Some Kind Of Weird
Twin Thing." Her film aired
on PBS in the "Point of View"
series of independent docu
mentaries in June.
While other film schools
usually teach various filming
techniques and genres, the
Stanford program particularly
focuses on the art of making
documentaries, Marcoux said.
As a result, students have
more time to get their hands
on all the technical facets of
the production.
"Unlike other film schools,
where you're assigned only one
role, here you do everything,"
she said. "You have room to
develop your own vision."

Graduate student Philippe Roques said he believes that the Documentary Film Program is one pro
gram "where people can express themselves freely." He is currently finishing his thesis documen
tary on the "Radical Faeries," a gay community on the West Coast.
