Roe challenge moves up
HONOLULU (AP) — Guam's anti-abortion
law, ruled unconstitutional soon after it went
into effect 18 months ago, moves a step closer
this week to challenging the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals begins
hearings today on the Pacific island's law, which
would virtually ban abortions there. But regard
less of the outcome, its decision is bound for the
nation's highest court, lawyers on both sides say.
The Guam law, which was in effect for four
days before an injunction blocked it on March
23, 1990, made a felony the performing of virtu
ally all abortions, except those to preserve a
mother's health or life. The law also made it a
misdemeanor to have an abortion or to ask or
advise a woman to have one.
Jackson won't run in '92
WASHINGTON (AP) - Jesse Jackson
announced Saturday he would not run for pres
ident in 1992, but vowed to make sure those
who do compete pay attention to the needs and
concerns of forgotten Americans.
"I stand here today to get the nation's atten
tion," Jackson told cheering supporters who
gathered outside a housing project to hear his
announcement.
"Here is where government rhetoric and liv
ing reality have collided and the wreckage is a
body of people," he said. "I focus here because
this is the urban crisis personified, the epitome
of national neglect."
He expressed discontent with both major
political parties and declared: "I will not seek
the nomination for the Democratic Party."
Mrs. Thomas praises God
NEW YORK (AP) — Virginia Thomas says
God and Christian music helped her and her
husband, Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas, through the stormy end of Thomas'
confirmation hearings.
Mrs. Thomas also said Anita Hill, whose
claim of sexual harassment jeopardized
Thomas' nomination, made her allegations
because she was in love with Thomas "and
never got what she wanted."
"It was spiritual warfare," Mrs. Thomas said
in the Nov. 11 People magazine. "Good versus
evil... we shut the kitchen blinds and turned on
Christian praise music to survive the worst days."
