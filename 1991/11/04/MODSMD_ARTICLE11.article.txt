# Mideast conference progresses smoothly
## Israelis sit down with Palestinians, Syrians for unprecedented talks Palestinians earn respect 
### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) —
Israelis and Palestinians held
"good, businesslike" direct talks
yesterday — their first ever —
and pledged to try to move on to
substantive issues such as
Palestinian autonomy within a
few days.
In another milestone, hard
line Syria overcame hesitations
and opened its one-on-one meet
ing with Israel late last night —
the first talks between the arch
foes in 43 years. A Lebanese dele
gation also held separate talks
with Israel.
"I think it was a good begin
ning," said U.S. Secretary of
State James Baker, who engi
neered the peace conference with
eight Middle East shuttles this
year. He said the United States
would remain deeply involved
and fully engaged in the process.
"We intend to stay ... as fully
engaged as we can and for as long
as we think the parties are seri
ous about peace. And for the
moment I think they are seri
ous."
Following their nearly five
hour session, the Israelis and a
joint Palestinian-Jordanian dele
gation displayed an amiable spir
it, in contrast to a week of con
frontational speeches and snubs
during last week's ceremonial
opening phase of the historic
Madrid talks.
Still to be settled is where the
substantive negotiations will be
held. In a joint statement, the
two sides said they would consult
about when and where to hold
substantive talks, "which it is
hoped will take place soon."
The Palestinians later said
that during the meeting they had
demanded a freeze on Israeli set
tlements in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza strip.
Israel has so far refused to
freeze the settlement-building.
Baker, speaking of the site and

timing of future meetings, said:
"This is an open question." But
he called the Israeli-Palestinian
meeting a "breakthrough."
He said he had no reason to
expect a walkout by Syria or any
of the other parties.
"If that were going to be the
case, I think we would have seen
it by now," Baker said.
Syria, balking at Israel's insis
tence on shifting the negotiations
to the Middle East, hesitated
before attending the procedural
session with Israel yesterday.
Baker said the United States
and the Soviet Union might step
in and make the venue decision in
the event of a long delay. U.S.
officials said privately Wash
ington was a possible choice.
After the Israeli-Palestinian
talks, the participants shook
hands for photographers, and
the chief Israeli delegate,
Eliakim Rubinstein, referred to
his Arab counterparts as "my
friends here." At one point he
answered a question both in
Arabic, with the word
"Inshallah," and in Hebrew,
with the words "Mirtzeh
Hashem" — both meaning "God
willing."
The participants mingled in
the hallways outside the meeting
room during breaks, drinking cof
fee together and chatting, Israeli
delegates said. And Palestinian
Elias Freij, the mayor of
Bethlehem, said. "There were
many light moments," including
a few jokes.
As if to underscore the high
stakes, however, Palestine
Liberation Organization chief
Yasser Arafat said in Tunis: "If
the negotiations do not lead to a
positive outcome, we will contin
ue the jihad," or holy war. He
added that the intefadeh, the
Palestinian uprising against
Israeli rule in the occupied lands,
would "go on, wave after wave."

However, Bassam Abu Sharif,
political adviser to Arafat, called
the agreement to hold further
talks "good news" and expressed
hope they would be in Washington
or Moscow.
Rubinstein said consultations
would continue "in the coming
days" about the site of further
talks and indicated the Israelis
were prepared to stay in Madrid
longer to sort out the matter.
Previously, the Israelis had said
they would leave Madrid after
yesterday's talks.
Israel wants to shift the talks
to the Middle East, thereby gain
ing a measure of Arab recogni
tion with the holding of some of
the talks in Israel. Syria and
Lebanon are resisting and trying
to keep the negotiations in
Madrid so as to give the confer
ence an international flavor and
to enhance the possibility of out
side influence.
The disagreement over the
site — a highly charged symbolic
issue — had threatened to scut
tle the direct talks altogether.
Baker, in an aside while tap
ing an NBC interview, said: "It's
incredible what they can argue
about."

MADRID, Spain (AP) — Palestinian nego
tiators presented a realistic and moderate case
at the Middle East peace conference that gave
their beleaguered people more status than
ever before on the international diplomatic
stage.
The composition of the Palestinian delega
tion — and its conciliatory statements at the
conference — contributed to what many par
ticipants described as a public-relations coup.
The team included U.S.-educated university
lecturers, political scientists, businessmen and
former prisoners — in sharp contrast with the
Palestinians' terrorist image of the 19705.
In Western dress, they sat opposite the
Israelis, although part of a Jordanian-
Palestinian delegation at Israel's insistence.
Just before the conference opened
Wednesday, members of the Palestinian dele
gation were granted a meeting with President
Bush.
Tahseen Beshir, former Egyptian govern
ment spokesman and political analyst, said the
Palestinians "have managed to give a human
face to the Arab position, refuting the Israeli
extremism of (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak)
Shamir without being caught in [Shamir's
attemptl to engage them with the past instead of
facing the future. They were very successful."
A speech by Haidar Abdul-Shafi, a physician
from the occupied Gaza Strip, dropped
demands for immediate statehood and said
Palestinians would agree to a transitional peri
od of self-rule.
He urged Israelis to agree to live side-by-side
with a Palestinian state they hope to establish
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Although a Palestinian state remains a
dream, the delegates apparently managed to
establish their plight as the core of the Middle
East conflict.
"We told our story. No people in this centu
ry were as misinformed about and discriminat
ed against as the Palestinians," said Saeb
Erekat, a Palestinian delegate.
"After all these years of trying to undermine
us, trying to discredit us, trying to make us
look [like] the unwanted of the earth, we were
able to face Shamir face-to-face and tell him,
'You have failed,' " Erekat said.
But Israel also allowed the Palestinians
some latitude in an effort to keep the confer
ence from collapsing.
