Speech code prevents
necessary exchange of
ideas between students

The death-knell may be
tolling for the latest inter
pretation of Stanford's Fun
damental Standard.
When a similar code at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin fell just a few
weeks ago, many rightly questioned
the appropriateness of Stanford's in
terpretation, which condemns epithet
based discriminatory harassment.
This speech code must be aban
doned.
According to the Fundamental
Standard, "students are expected
to show both within and without
the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor
and the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens."
The penalty for not adhering to
the principles of the Fundamental
Standard is simple: The offending
student or students can be re
moved from the University.
The speech code goes further,
however, attempting to protect
individuals from personal attacks
intended to insult or stigmatize
them based on their sex, nationali
ty, ethnicity, race, handicap, reli
gion or sexual orientation.
Protection of those who are dis
criminated against verbally is a
noble aim. But the problems that
arise from attempting to do this
far outweigh any possible benefits.
In an attempt by the University
to protect individuals, the princi
ples of open debate were sacrificed.
Already, the code has had a chill
ing effect on speech. Although the
interpretation is narrow, many stu
dents are now more worried about
what they say and more closely
guard the expression of their ideas,
whether those ideas would actually
violate the new speech code or not.
Further, the interpretation does
not allow students to make their
own choices about public discus

sion. Instead, administrators take
it upon themselves to act paternal
istically and decide what students
can or cannot say.
The Fundamental Standard has
always limited speech at the point
of infringing the rights of others. If
one student acts maliciously toward
another, the Fundamental Stan
dard can still protect the abused
student by punishing the other.
Rather than offering true protec
tion — the open exchange of ideas by
intelligent community members —
the speech code builds a false sense
of security that cannot be achieved
through speech-policing alone.
The code also forces the Univer
sity to take on the role of defender
and arbiter, rather than empower
ing the community as a whole to
defend one another. Hate speech
should certainly be condemned,
but the most powerful condemna
tion should come from the stu
dents, and not University officials.
No code should attempt to define
the point of condemnation, howev
er. This point of definition is always
hazy, and leads to the unfortunate
perception that once-safeguarded
speech is no longer protected.
If hate does exist between stu
dents, forcing its suppression
attacks only the symptom and not
the true cause of the problem.
It is far better to expose hateful
ideas to the scrutiny of public dis
cussion where they have a chance
to be resolved than to let them fes
ter and poison the world around us
or be expressed more virulently
down the line.
Only by allowing students to
deal with issues directly and per
haps confrontationally can these
important topics be broached. The
free exchange of ideas, however
uncomfortable, is the lifeblood of
any university. It is frightening
that members of this community
would fear such exchange.
The chilling effect of the new
Fundamental Standard interpreta
tion is unacceptable on a campus
dedicated to the free exchange of
ideas and committed to all-encom
passing community discussion.
