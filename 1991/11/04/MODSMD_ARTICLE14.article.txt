## We're all part of history 
### 
IT IS POLITICALLY AND intellectu
ally unwise for us to attack the tradi
tion, customs and values which
attracted immigrants to our shores in the
first place."
— Prof. Kennell Jackson
In the beginning there were the
Greeks. They had it out with the
Romans, who in turn became the big kids
on the block. Between the two of them
they taught the rest of the world all that
is true of politics, ethics, drama, law and
life in general.
The English modified these nifty ideas
a bit and threw in a little Shakespeare.
They passed it all on to the American
colonists who decided democracy and a
free market were God's gifts to men.
Throw in a couple of wars and some neat
inventions and there you have history. At
least, history the way it is taught in our
public schools.
And then you get to Stanford. Sudden
ly there's noise from the heretofore silent
peanut galleries of our society. African-
Americans, Hispanics and Asians all
point out how their contributions to
world history have been ignored.
They say this fabric we call America has
more black, brown, red and yellow thread
than we care to admit. People are told that
the foundation they've been building on
for the past 18 years is a false, hollow shell
that they must now build over.

What everyone seems to overlook is
the fact that at this point it's really too
late. People's conceptions of themselves
and the world around them have already
been molded and set. It's scary and
threatening for the average white stu
dent to be told that all he knows is wrong.
It's also frustrating and angering for
the minority student who realizes how
much he doesn't know about himself.
Both sides get caught in an impasse that
could have been avoided if our schools
taught history and not his story.
As I look back on my own education I
realize how little I learned about me in
the countless history classes I took. I had
two images of blackness: the natives
standing in mile-high grass with the
rings through their noses and the poor
black people losing their lives in the civil
rights movement.
When Black History Month came
around, the majority of the students, the
black ones included, did their projects on
one of the two Michaels — Jordan or
Jackson, that is. I never heard of the
plethora of black inventors, scientists,
philosophers and others who helped build
this nation.
As I look back on the zeal I had for
learning, I feel cheated that none of that
energy was ever directed towards the his
torical contributions of my own people.
I had never met a person from Greece
or Rome, but I respected them. I appreci

ated them. I understood the liberties
attained in my own life and my fine sense
of "culture" to be my English heritage.
And I respected my white classmates as
direct products of these societies.
What my classmates saw of me and my
people was drastically different. They
saw someone who helped create and
maintain the agricultural society of the
Old South. They were sympathetic of
someone who historically had ended up
with the short end of the stick.
But they didn't respect me as a mem
ber of a group who at any time had con
tributed to the intellectual evolution of
man. That wasn't the historical image
they had been given of black people. In
the end, we all lost.
I must say that I agree with Prof.
Jackson's quote which tries to deal with
this dilemma about how to modify histo
ry. It is politically and intellectually
unwise to attack the traditions, values
and customs that lured settlers to our
shore. It is probably because we forgot
about freedom and fairness in the first
place that we have this problem at all.
