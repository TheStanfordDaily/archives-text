Administration could save Stanford by saving watts

NO ONE ON THIS CAMPUS IS
happy with the proposed budget
cuts. Students, faculty and staff
are almost universally nervous and
angry with the inevitability of cuts in
their departments.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect
of the cuts is the helplessness everyone
feels in the face of the huge budget crisis
we are facing.
No one seems to be offering any alter
natives, as if cutting departments and
services is the only route to take. Not a
great way to start off our second centu
ry, is it?
That is why I feel compelled to ask
the following question: Have the budget
committees given serious thought to cut
ting energy consumption, rather than
budgets, as a means of reaching our eco
nomic goals? Currently, the university

spends $14 million a year on energy, of
which about $8 million is for electricity.
Cutting costs by using efficient, envi
ronmentally friendly technology such as
compact fluorescent light bulbs, motion
sensors that automatically turn off
lights in unoccupied offices, and new
efficient electronic ballasts in light fix
tures, would have manifold advantages
for Stanford.
First, these technologies would drasti
cally cut our energy consumption, espe
cially in the "peak" working hours. This
would not only be a great service to our
environment, but it would set Stanford
as the standard for environmentally sen
sitive universities.
Second, even a 10 percent reduction
in energy consumption would also save
the university around $1.4 million dol
lars every year. And we could certainly

do better than a 10 percent reduction.
By comparison, cutting the drama
department would save less than $1 mil
lion. Thus, if the budget committees
would plan these savings into their pro
posals, services and possibly whole
departments could be saved.
Third, and arguably most important,
using this alternative would show that
Stanford is not willing to take a negative
path and compromise itself, but rather
that we are ready to use this time of
change in a positive manner; that we are
strong enough, creative enough and
brave enough to make a real commit
ment to our next century.
Obviously, there would be a substan
tial initial cost to this project. Nonethe
less, I see this cost not as another eco
nomic burden, but as a perfect opportu
nity to invest in our future. The best

source of funding for this project would
be the endowment.
Currently, we take pride if invest
ments from the endowment give a return
of 15 percent. Now consider that a com
pact fluorescent light bulb used for four
hours a day in place of a regular incan
descent bulb yields a 40 percent return
on the investment in energy savings.
Clearly, energy efficiency is not only a
sane alternative to our short-term eco
nomic troubles, it is the most sensible path
for Stanford to take into our next centuiy.
Now is the time for every member of
the faculty, staff and student body to tell
the University that we do have an
option, an option that will bring Stanford
to greatness for the next hundred years.
