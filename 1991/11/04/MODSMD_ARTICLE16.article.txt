# Computer virus found at The New York Times by President Kennedy
## 
### 
The following letter, written on Oct. 25,
1991, was published in yesterday's edi
tions of The New York Times.
I write to warn you that there is a
computer virus loose at The New York
Times; I know you will want to learn
how it works.
The virus looks for a news article con
taining the word "Stanford." It then
searches the rest of the text to deter
mine further whether or not the article
has a generally negative cast. If it reach
es that determination, it attaches ver
sions of the following text to the article:
"... is an additional embarrassment
for Stanford, which already faces the
loss of millions of dollars in Federal
money for improperly using research-

related money to buy items like furni
ture and flowers for the home of its
president, Donald Kennedy, who recent
ly announced his retirement at the end
of the current academic year."
The most recent instance came in
connection with an Oct. 23 news article
about a physician at Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital at Stanford who
turned out after his death to have been
married to three women.
The viral recognition program is
apparently so subtle that it immediately
detected in this report the relationship
between polygamy and Federal indirect
cost reimbursement policy, and added
the above quoted passage to the article.
More severe tests, however, are wait
ing in the wings. Can the virus work in
the sports section? Will we see, in a mat
ter of weeks, this addition to a report on
a Stanford-UCLA football game:
"The last-minute failure of Stanford's
'prevent' defense against the passing of
UCLA's Maddox was yet another excru
ciating embarrassment for Donald

Kennedy and his accountants, whose
'prevent' defense had earlier allowed
Stanford to charge flowers and furniture
for the president's residence...
I can hardly wait.
Donald Kennedy
University President
