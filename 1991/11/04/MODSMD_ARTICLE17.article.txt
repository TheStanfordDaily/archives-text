# Presidential search at Stanford not up to par with Berkeley, others
## 
### 
As the person who was the Chairman
of the Board of Regents of the University
of California in 1982-83, when David
Gardner was selected as president, I was
very disappointed to read in The Daily
(Oct. 29) that Stanford is not using the
presidential-selection approach of its two
mcuor peer institutions, Harvard Univer
sity and the University of California.
Rather, it is using the method of other

institutions like the University of South
ern California.
For the U.C. search, Dean Watkins, a
Stanford Ph.D. in electrical engineering
and a former Stanford trustee, was
chairman. Other Regents on the com
mittee included three UCLA graduates,
three Stanford graduates and myself.
We had a Faculty Advisory Commit
tee, a Staff Advisory Committee, a Stu
dent Advisory Committee and an Alum
ni Advisory Committee. The member
ship on all these committees was select
ed by each group.
The search began in October and by
mid-March David Gardner was an
nounced as the new president, effective
June 30,1983 or as soon as he could leave
his presidency at the University of Utah
and establish his presidency in California
In the seven years that he has been
president, David Gardner, with the co
operation and help of the Regents, has
already vastly improved the U.C. system.
