Justice not served for
Palestine in other
wise accurate column
A round of applause to Daniel Rosen
for his column of Oct. 31. It is refreshing
to read positive mention of the establish
ment of an independent Palestinian
state immediately following denuncia
tion of the Arab boycott of Israel.
Although I fully agree with the main
thrust of Rosen's Oct. 31 column, I must
take issue with some of his statements.
When Rosen accuses the conflict's two
chief protagonists of participating in a
mutually destructive war, his subsequent
arguments imply that the Palestinians
and Israelis participate on equal footing.
The fact is that in this situation, said
protagonists are the occupier and the
occupied. The national aspirations of
each cannot be reduced to the common
denominator of mutual persecution. The
Israelis possess statehood and hence
wield the right to preserve Israeli
national security.

Palestinians living on their native land
fall under jurisdiction of their adversary,
who has the right to thwart any and all
Palestinian activity perceived as political.
When Rosen states that "the Pales
tinians have spent the last 40 years try
ing to establish a state by driving Israel
into the sea," he unearths and embel
lishes an outdated rhetorical rallying-cry
that has long fed fears and misconcep
tions of Palestinian aims.
This statement completely dismisses
the legitimacy of any Palestinian
response to their own dispossession.
Furthermore, I know from my experi
ence this summer living with West Bank
and Gaza Palestinians that whether or
not this overused generalization was ever
true, it is now worthless and inaccurate.
Like Rosen, I am convinced that the
most promising solution to this perenni
al problem is a two-state solution. The
Madrid conference is unprecedented in
that the Palestinians at last are in some
way represented and the Israeli govern
ment is, however reluctantly, speaking
with these representatives.
Maybe we can look forward to the
outcome of this next installation in the

Middle East peace saga as having more
than just cosmetic value. We don't need
another Camp David.

California statutory
rape law unprotective,
unintelligible, useless
California "statutory rape" is ran
dom, pernicious, silly and has little to do
with insuring that people do not have
sex without their informed consent or
protecting children from adults.
California law bans most college sopho
more men, and men only, from having sex
with most college freshmen women.
To wit: "§ 261.5 Unlawful sexual
intercourse with female under age 18.
Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of
sexual intercourse accomplished with a
female not the wife of a perpetrator,
where the female is under the age of 18
years." Sensible, this is not.
In New York, where the law actually

tries to protect children from adults,
things are done differently. "§ 130.25
Rape in the third degree. A person is
guilty of rape in the third degree when:
"1. He or she engages in sexual inter
course with another person to whom the
actor is not married who is incapable of con
sent by reason of some factor other than
being less than seventeen years old, or:
"2. Being 21 years old or more, he or
she engages in sexual intercourse with
another person to whom the actor is not
married less than seventeen years old."
Makes more sense to me.

Administration needs
to include faculty in
all academic decisions
In the spring, I expressed in this pub
lication the (forlorn, alas) hope that
Stanford administration would take
suitable actions without amplifying.
Regrettably, however, there is a con

tinued reliance on the large corps of
administrative officials for official state
ments that ought to be expressed by the
principals of the University alone; specif
ically, quotes of a Senior Associate
Provost about the justification for the
administrative use of the word reposi
tioning are extraneous.
The faculty has, by tradition, a promi
nent and established role in the process
of making appointments to the instruc
tional staff.
Now that the governing staff consti
tutes the muscle of the University, why
should the nature and number of
appointments thereto be kept from fac
ulty vote or scrutiny?
I heartily concur with the statement
of the President and the Provost (on
October 22) that "we can better afford
reductions of service in many vice-presi
dential areas than we can afford reduc
tion of academic programs."
This surely means that a smaller
administrative staff will suffice. What
assurance is there of such an eventuality
in the very near future?
