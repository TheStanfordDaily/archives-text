# Meyer merge possible due to budget cuts

Seeking to slash $3.1 million from their bud
get, administrators in Library and Information
Resources are considering plans to shrink and
reorganize resources and services â€” and possi
bly merge Meyer with other libraries.
Five task forces are looking at specific areas
of the library system and wili submit recom

mendations for changes to the directors of the
libraries by Jan. 17.
Library officials say the cutbacks could
mean significant layoffs and related reduc
tions in services. According to Meyer Librari
an Michael Miller, restructuring could radical
ly change the library's nature.
"Meyer would still function as a library," he
said. "But its purpose would be different. The
purpose now ... is to support undergraduate

education through the collections ... and the
reference services that prepare students to do
research in the libraries. That's the part that's
in danger."
Miller said it would be difficult to maintain
current services. "The only way to save money
is to cut staff," he said. "We are trying to
develop scenarios that would provide a differ-
ent configuration of services. .. .
It's hard to say now, but most
likely there will be less service."
If Meyer were merged with
other libraries, "Meyer the build
ing will still remain a library
source and space," Miller said.
"Books will be on the shelves, but
it may be a different set of books.
However, certain things, like
the audio-visual facilities, would
probably remain in Meyer because
"it is hard to imagine where they
might be moved to," Miller added.
Other colleges have set the
precedent for merging libraries,

said Karen Nagy, the director of
Meyer and the research libraries.
"At some colleges, having sepa
rate graduate and undergraduate
[libraries] hasn't worked out well,
and the undergraduate libraries
have been removed.
"We've made no decisions yet,
though," Nagy said, adding that
the task group met for the first
time Thursday.
Tony Angiletta, the head of ref
erence at Green Library and
another member of the task
groups, said, "We are not set to
close down Meyer. It won't be nec
essary, as long as we are able to
deliver the goods and services the
students and faculty need and still
meet the budget requirements."
Pieces of the Meyer adminis

tration could be relocated to other
libraries, Nagy said. "However, it
would be more reorganizing of the
resources than taking anything
away," she added.
"Support for undergraduates
is a real priority," Nagy said.
Some students were dismayed
that Meyer may no longer be a
primarily undergraduate library.
"Meyer is great as a general
library," said sophomore Linh
Trinh. "It has great variety. The
other libraries are so specialized,
and it would be a pain to have to
go from one to the other."
Most students had no special
attachment to Meyer, though.
"Basically, I would just go to
another library, like Green," said
senior Jeff Lifur.
