# Club formed for Arab students

In a society where the word
"Arab" is often followed by the word
"terrorist," junior Dina Hamdy
says, "It's enough to make you want
to deny your Arab heritage."
So Hamdy helped to form a new
student group, the Organization of
Arab-American Students In Stan
ford (OASIS), to try "to provide an
environment where one can feel
proud of one's roots," she said.
According to sophomore Tariq
Bujsaim, another member of the
group, "Considering the growing
importance of public figures of
Arab descent (in U.S. affairs) and
the importance of the political sit
uation in the Middle East in world
politics ... we felt that increased
awareness of Arab culture can
only be a benefit to the Stanford
community."
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, White House Chief of Staff

John Sununu and famed disc jockey
Casey Kasem are just a few exam
ples of prominent U.S. citizens of
Arab descent, Bujsaim added.
He said the idea for the organi
zation arose in spring quarter last
year. It is intended to "present a
forum for discussion for anyone
interested in discussing Middle
East issues or Arab-American
issues" and to "bring together
Arab-Americans in a social frame
work," he said.
Bujsaim, junior Rabea Ataya
and sophomore Nawwar Kasrawi
came up with the idea for the
organization. Together with
Hamdy, junior Steve Ramirez and
senior Taj Rahi, they were co
signers of a draft constitution.
The constitution was present
ed to the ASSU, which last week
approved funding for the organi
zation's operation this quarter.
Previous attempts to establish a
similar organization had failed

because "it is difficult for an individ
ual to find out who the Arab stu
dents are on campus," Bujsaim said.
But once Bujsaim found Ataya
and Kasrawi, together they knew
enough people to found OASIS.
Senior Diane Carpenter, a mem
ber of the organization, said she
knows of no other group that pro
vides the same function to the
Stanford community.
Ataya and Bujsaim emphasized
the organization is open to any
one interested in issues related to
Arab-Americans or to the Arab
world, regardless of ancestry.
Several members of OASIS are
not of Arab descent. Ataya said
some of them are interested in the
culture because they have friends
who are Arab-American, while
others are studying Middle East
affairs or are interested in the
region's politics and culture.
