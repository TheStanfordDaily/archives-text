## Card defense bludgeons Ducks Football edges closer to bowl bid with 33-13 victory 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team is keeping the
dream alive, and this time it has the defense to
thank for it. In game that had no real offen
sive standouts, the 5-3 Cardinal used a
swarming defensive front to manhandle the
Oregon Ducks in Eugene 33-13 for its fourth
win in a row.

Cardinal 33
Ducks 13

Due to a rash of injuries, Oregon was
forced to start redshirt freshman Kyle Crow
ston at quarterback, a weakness the Cardinal
felt no pity in exploiting. With outside
linebacker Ron George leading the way,
Stanford's defense pressured Crowston into
bad hand-offs and hasty decisions like an
intentional grounding when the Ducks were
passing from their own end zone. The result
ing safety put Stanford up 9-0 just before the
end of the first quarter, and pumped up
George, whose presence had forced the play.
The safety was followed with a 40-yard
Aaron Mills field goal that put the Cardinal
up 12-0, but poor punting by Stanford gave
the Ducks favorable field position, and they
made use of it with two field goals by Gregg
McCallum to pull within 12-6. In front of
41,949 screaming homecoming fans, Oregon
was hoping for the famous Stanford second
half fold, but it never came.
In a situation where past Cardinal teams

may have crumbled, the 1991 model rose to
the occasion. Making sure the Ducks didn't
start conjuring up illusions of victory, Stan
ford got the ball back on its next possession
and on third-and-three broke the game open
with a 54-yard touchdown pass from Sten
strom to Jon Pinkney.
In a play that was designed to go to half
back Glyn Milburn in the flat, Stenstrom
read the defense keying on his star running
back and instead threw to an open Pinkney
running a corner route. Pinkney first shook
off cornerback Herman O'Berry, and safety
Chad Conta with a good inside move, and
then it was off to the races. Oregon's Eric
Castle appeared to catch Pinkney near the
goal line, but the senior dove at the three and
extended the ball over the plane of the goal
line as he was pushed out of bounds.
The Ducks protested the call, but to no
avail. The fans were silenced and the Cardi
nal was once again in control 19-6 after
Mills' extra point.
Not to be excluded from the festivities, the
Stanford defense continued its domination of
the Duck offense on the very next Oregon
possession. After fumbling the first snap,
Crowston made a pitch behind running back
Shawn Burwell, with the resulting fumble
gathered up at the nine by George and run
into the end zone for a nice show, but no
score. Recovered fumbles can't be advanced.
Oregon had been playing all day with two
tight ends, but still could not find a way to
stop the rushing George.
The Cardinal offense made good use of the
chance the defense had given it, as Tommy
Vardell went in for the teams' third touch
down of the day, four plays later. Aaron
Mills' conversion made it 26-6, and in the

space of four minutes the Cardinal had
turned a slim six-point lead into a twenty
point clobbering.
Stanford's final score came with 1:23 left
in the game when Stenstrom found Chris
Walsh for a four-yard touchdown pass. It was
Stenstrom's third touchdown pass of the day
and Walsh's second, the duo having connect
ed for the Cardinal's initial score in the first
quarter. Stenstrom finished the day going
12-for-22 for 147 yards.
Stanford's attention now shifts to next
weekend when the UCLA Bruins come to
town. Currently ranked 23rd by the Associ
ated Press, UCLA crushed Washington State
44-3 Saturday to go to 6-2 on the season. As
far as the Cardinal is concerned, the problem
with the Bruins lies in the arm of quarter
back Tommy Maddox, whose passing ability
single handedly beat Stanford in the last
minute of last year's game. Beating UCLA is
crucial to Cardinal bowl hopes, and this game
might again come down to the play of the
Stanford defense.
Stanford will have to climb that mountain
if it hopes to get to the promise land of the
postseason bowl.
Card notes
Coy Gibbs had the day of his young career, net
ting a team high 11 tackles, eight unassisted. Four
of those tackles came from behind the line of
scrimmage for a total of 12 lost Oregon yards. Ore
gon's star running back Shawn Burwell, who had
been averaging 91.8 yards a game, was held to only
11 yards on 13 carries. In the last four games,
opponents have averaged only 70.8 yards rushing
and 205.8 yards of total offense against the Cardi
nal. Oregon got 47 and 192.


Rajiv Chandrasekaran — Daily file
Known as an all-purpose back, Glyn Milburn proved Saturday that
he is effective in other ways. Against the Ducks Milburn was used
as a decoy — resulting in a 54-yard touchdown from Steve Sten
strom to Jon Pinkney.
