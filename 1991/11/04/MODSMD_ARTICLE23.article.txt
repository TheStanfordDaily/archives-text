The unstoppable women's soccer team ended
its regular season with a bang Saturday after
noon, smashing Northern Colorado by the score
of 3-0.
The No. 7 Cardinal finished the regular sea
son with a 16-1 mark, breaking a school record
for victories and shutouts in the process, as
Leslie Garrard and Chris Massell teamed up in
goal to post the team's 14th blanking of the sea
son.
Although coach Berhane Andeberhan did
not believe the team played at its peak level, he
was nonetheless satisfied with his squad's play
in the final game before the NCAA tournament.
"It took us awhile to get into our game," he
said, "but we played quite well and I feel we can
play even better than that.
"Coaches are weird people," Andeberhan
continued. "We would like our teams to play at
a perfect level every game, but it's human
nature to play at the level of your opponents.
We played a good game, scored some good goals,
and did the things we practiced reasonably
well."
The Cardinal jumped on the scoreboard
early, as Sarah Rafanelli scored her team
record 16th goal of the season off an assist from
Julie Foudy just 3:02 into the game.
Freshman Jennifer Stephan scored her first
collegiate goal 19 minutes into the game as she
put in a loose ball to put Stanford up by a pair.
In the second half, senior Elizabeth
Joneschild scored her first goal of the year with
just four minutes remaining in her regular-sea
son college career. Freshman Melinda Minstrell
got the assist.
The Northern Colorado Bears were shut
down completely by the Stanford defense. They
had only one serious chance to score, when a
hard shot from the side of the Cardinal net was
deflected by a diving Massell.
The Cardinal saluted its five seniors, Keiry
Stivaletti, captain Heather Mclntyre, Denise
Denney, Joneschild, and Kim Petersen with a
ceremony after the game.
The Cardinal team eagerly awaits the seed
ings for the NCAA tournament. Stanford, Col
orado College, and Santa Clara are three of the
favorites for NCAA bids.
Stanford has to be considered a favorite for
the No. 1 seed in the West as the other Western
contender's records pale in comparison to Stan
ford's near-perfect record over 17 games. The
Cardinal's only loss was to No. 5 Santa Clara,
