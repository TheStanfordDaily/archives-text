# Spikers win, bagel Bears in third
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
The California women's vol
leyball team came to Maples
Pavilion Friday with hopes of
upsetting No. 1 Stanford. They
left with nothing. Literally.
The Cardinal blanked the
Bears in the final game to cap off
an impressive three-game sweep,

15-6, 15-10, 15-10

winning 15-6, 15-10, 15-0 to set a
new school record for consecutive
wins in a season at 21. Stanford
dismantled the hapless Bears in
just over an hour.
In the flawless third game,
junior Kathy Jurgens served the
first nine points as the Cardinal
exploited California mistakes and
made several outstanding defen
sive plays to keep the Bears from
putting anything together.
"They weren't passing well,
and [our serving] just threw their
rhythm off," Jurgens said.
Buoyed by the stellar play of
sophomore Heidi Eick and fresh
man Anne Wicks, the Cardinal
ran its offense to near perfection,
blocking, digging, and hitting like
a volleyball machine. California
could only watch as Stanford hit a
stunning .722 with no hitting
errors for the final game.
"When we take them out of
their offense, we're going to do
well because we're bigger and
physically stronger," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said.
The shut-out game, a rarity in
collegiate volleyball, was the per
fect ending to a match in which
Stanford held the Bears to a .000
hitting percentage with 21 errors.
Morgan Cecil led California in
hitting with a .160 percentage.
The Cardinal hit .375 as a team,
overpowering California in every
aspect of the game.
"I felt like we knew them back
wards and forwards," sophomore
Heidi Eick said. "We were ready
for whatever they did."
Eick had one of her best games

so far as a Cardinal, coming off
the bench for senior Nicole Apple
man in games two and three to
tally five kills, five blocks, and a
.500 hitting percentage.
"Heidi did a great job," Shaw
said. "She did everything we
asked her to do."
Another young Cardinal play
er, Wicks, had a super day as well,
hitting 1.000 while punishing the
Maples floor with three tremen
dous spikes in game three.
"I feel like I've been connect
ing better in practice, and Carrie
was setting really well," she said.
Stanford didn't look too
impressive at first, though.
"At the very beginning [of the
match], we were a little tenta
tive," Shaw said. "[The team]
responded and served real tough."
Did they ever. After California
jumped to a 6-2 lead in game one,
Shaw called a timeout. The strat
egy worked, because the Cardinal
went back onto the court and
reeled off 13 consecutive points,
the final 12 from the powerful
serves of senior Jennifer Jackson.
Jackson shook off a miniature
slump to come out strong against
the Bears, hitting .333 with five
kills and seven digs. Senior Kristin
Klein had another ho-hum day,
scoring 11 kills on .529 hitting
with seven digs and four blocks.
California had come into the
match on a roll, playing well and
ranked fourth in the Pacific 10
Conference, and the Golden
Bears had taken game three from
the Cardinal on Sept. 24 in Berke
ley. No one thought that Califor
nia was a walkover team.
"Don made it clear (in prac
tice) that we should take Cal seri
ously," Eick said.
"We weren't going to let up in
the third game because of what
happened last time," junior setter
Carrie Feldman said.
With such a convincing victory
over a good Bear team, the top
ranked Stanford Cardinal, 21-0
overall, might now be called the
greatest women's volleyball team
in Stanford history, but coach
Shaw is not willing to go quite
that far yet.
"I'd say it's one of the most
fun teams to coach," he said with
a smile.
