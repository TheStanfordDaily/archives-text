# Men's soccer squeaks by San Diego, hopes for NCAA berth
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
Call it thrilling, call it sloppy — call it
whatever you want. The Stanford men's
Boccer team squeaked by San Diego yes
terday at Maloney Field, 1-0, continuing
its season-long tradition of keeping every
contest close into the final seconds.
"What can I say? We don't do it the
easy way," said Stanford coach Colin Lin
dores.
"I'm breathless ... Our kids make it
exciting every time out there," said Car
dinal asst. coach Greg Petersen. "Some
times we look absolutely clueless."
"They were a tough team even with

their bad record (6-11-0)," said Cardinal
goalie Kyle Krpata. "At least we won."
Krpata summed it up best: a win is
still a win. Stanford has a lot of those this
year, emerging victorious for the
eleventh time in its last 16 games in
defeating a dangerous and underrated
Torero squad.
Stanford (11-3-5) dominated the
match statistically, amassing an enor
mous 16-4 shots on goal advantage and
virtually eliminating all San Diego scor
ing threats in the process.
The game was a complete team effort
on the Cardinal's part. "There was no
real standout today," Petersen said. "It
was a solid effort all around." Indeed, a

summary of the game's highlights sounds
much like a reading of the Stanford ros
ter itself. In the first half, Jim Talluto's
shot of 25 yards was saved high, Jason
Vanacour's attempt from a similar dis
tance sailed just right, Lance Killian
drilled another shot right from about 15
yards ... and the two teams entered the
locker room scoreless.
The second half was similar to the first
period. Vanacour's free kick from the top
of the penalty box was high. Rhett Harty
was stopped about ten yards short of the
goal on a brilliant breakaway opportuni
ty. Harty, Killian, and Ryan Collins all
came close to scoring on a Talluto corner
kick.

The play that did work for the Cardi
nal was one with which Cardinal soccer
fans are very familiar by now. Senior full
back Brandon Farley tossed one of his
tremendous 40-50 yard throw-ins to the
mouth of the goal, where Harty followed
with his fifth score of the season.
Lindores, while feeling uncomfortable
with the unorthodox throw-in play, has
been nevertheless satisfied with its
results. "As a soccer purist, it's not a
thing I like to do," the coach said. "But on
the practical side, it's all part of the job,
and it works."
With under 15 seconds remaining in
the game, the Toreros drove to the Stan
ford penalty box, but shots from USD for

wards Doug Berry and Steve Shipley fell
short, and the Cardinal came a step clos
er to receiving an elusive NCAA tourna
ment bid.
Ranked No. 6 in the West, Stanford is
fighting for its first NCAA berth since
1978. While it seems logical that the Car
dinal will be invited to the event if the
NCAA Selection Committee picks its
usual six western teams, there is room
for doubt in any sort of arbitrary selec
tion process. Cardinal coaches remained
unsure of their team's postseason status.
"It's all going to be interesting,"
Petersen said. How fitting for the Stan
ford squad, a most unpredictable and
interesting team.
