# Resurgent water polo crushes Trojans
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Although the Stanford water polo team has strug
gled throughout much of this season, the team is
doing anything but struggling right now. Friday
afternoon at deGuerre Pool, the No. 4 Cardinal com
pletely dominated No. 7 USC and came away with a
12-6 win.
USC had beaten Stanford earlier this year, but
this time the game was never really in contention as
the Cardinal displayed great offense and defense to
turn the game into a rout.
As Freshman Wolf Wigo said, "They (the Trojans)
really didn't play too bad, but we just played great,

made our shots, and controlled the game."
Did they ever. After Cardinal freshman Frank
Schneider scored the first goal of the game on a
breakaway after a steal by Antonio Busquets, the
Trojans responded with a goal to tie the game with
four minutes left in the first quarter.
But that was the last time USC would be any
where near Stanford, as two quick goals for Stanford

from Chip Blankenhorn and Brian demons put the
Cardinal in control with a 3-1 lead, demons' goal
was quite a crowd pleaser and seemed to signify the
whole day for Stanford, as he completely faked out
his defender and lofted a nice lob shot over the goal
keeper for the goal.
After another USC score, it was Busquets' turn to
excite the crowd, as he hid under the water and stole
the ball from a surprised Trojan player. The steal led
to a breakaway for Wigo who was fouled on the play
and then converted the ensuing penalty shot to give
his team a 4-2 lead.
In the second quarter, it was more of the same, as
Stanford's offense — which had really struggled for
much of the year — exploded for four more goals to
open up an 8-4 lead at halftime.
In the second half, sophomore goalkeeper Larry
Bercutt took over the game and continually thwarted
Trojan scoring opportunities. "Larry's playing really
well for us now, and when he plays well, that really
helps the team and gives us a big lift," Wigo said.
USC's last gasp may have come with five minutes
left in the fourth quarter when they failed to capital
ize on a two-man advantage and Clemons quickly put
another in the net to give the Cardinal the unreach
able lead of 10-4.
Bercutt's play — and the whole defense's perfor
mance — was so good that the Trojans did not score
in the second half until a goal by Robert Gifford with
only four minutes left in the game.
Wigo and Blankenhorn both scored three goals to
lead the Cardinal attack, while Clemons, Schneider,
and Busquets contributed two goals apiece. The Car
dinal is now 12-9 on the year.
After putting themselves back in contention for the
NCAA tournament two weekends ago in the 49er Invi
tational Tournament, this weekend's performance has
demonstrated that Stanford has indeed found the form
that will hopefully get the team invited to the tourna
ment. As Wigo summed it up, "We've been playing pret
ty well in workouts and we just kept up the momentum
against USC and came away with a great win."
Stanford's next game will be Saturday morning
at 10:30 a.m. against No. 5 UCLA, one of the
teams the Cardinal needs to beat to get into
NCAAs, and if Stanford keeps on playing like it
has lately, those early season memories of strug
gling should be long forgotten.
