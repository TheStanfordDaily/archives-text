The Northern California
Rolex Regional tournament
was transformed into the All-
Cardinal Championships this
weekend at Stanford Tennis
Stadium. Stanford players gar
nered all four of the spots in the
semifinals of the singles draw,
setting up the final match today
between teammates Kylie
Johnson and Laxmi Poruri.
Johnson, a senior, reached
the finals by defeating sopho
more Kristine Kurth 6-4, 6-7,
7-5. Kurth, the tournament's
top seed, commended her team
mate's play.
"Kylie was serving really
well, and I had problems with
my return," she said. "In the
third set she played very
aggressively; she took balls on
the rise and hit into the cor
ners. It seemed like she was in
control of the match, and I felt
like I was on the defensive a
lot."
On the other side of the draw,
No. 3 Poruri defeated No. 2 fresh
man Kim Shasby 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.
Coach Frank Brennan did
not consider either win a large
upset. "The tennis was good in
both matches," he said. "They
were tough three-setters that
could've gone either way.
Sometimes when two team
mates play each other, emo
tions are difficult. They don't
know how fired up they should
get."

For the most part, the rest of
the Cardinal contingent breezed
through the competition until
they hit one of their own. Fresh
man Amy Chiminello did not
drop a set before losing to Kurth
7-5, 7-6 (9-7) in the quarterfi
nals. Junior Mario Carruth was
eliminated by Johnson in the
same round 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), and
sophomore Emma Woodhouse
fell to Poruri 6-3, 6-1.
"This is the best showing
we've ever had," Brennan said.
"I wanted the freshmen to get a
chance to play, and I think it's
really a success that they got to
play as many matches as they
did. The semifinalists and final
ists were just icing on the
cake."
In doubles action, the third
seeded team of Woodhouse and
Johnson overcame the second
seeded California team of Jen
nifer Poulos and Sarah May
nard 1-6, 6-2, 6-0 to advance to
the finals. They will meet the
California tandem of Valerie
Poulos and Lisa Parks.
