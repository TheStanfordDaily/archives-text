# Rare film stolen from Meyer
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Students often complain that
the best years of their lives are
lost in Meyer Library. Now, a rare
16-millimeter print of the 1946
film "The Best Years of Our
Lives" — valued at $1,875 — has
been reported missing from the
library's media center.
"Frankly, I'm a little surprised
that anyone would want to take
it," said Michael Gray, an employ
ee of the media center. "It's not
the kind of thing you could view
in your living room, unless you
had a really great living room."
The missing print — consisting
of three 16-millimeter reels
housed in a 12-pound mailing
case — disappeared from Meyer's

second-floor return shelf between
June 28 and July 1. Library
employees have been searching
for it ever since.
If the print is not found or
returned in the next 30 days, library
funds will be used to replace it.
"We're hoping that if someone
'borrowed' it, they will return it to
Meyer as soon as possible," said Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
According to Gray, the film
had originally been borrowed
from Syracuse University for an
annual summer film series spon
sored by the History Department.
The print was returned to the
media center on June 28. When it
was discovered missing on July 1,
library employees assumed the
print had been mailed back.
"We figured everything was fine

until we got a call from Syracuse a
month later," Gray said. After an
exhaustive search of Meyer and
numerous calls to Syracuse and
United Parcel Service, library
employees concluded that the print
had been stolen. Gray reported the
theft to Stanford Police last week.
"Every once in a while we'll
have a videotape turn up missing,
but never a 16-millimeter print,"
Gray said.
Although stealing either a
videotape or a rare print is a mis
demeanor, Meyer officials do not
plan to press charges if the print is
returned.
"We'd be thrilled just to get the
print back," Gray said.
A videotape version of "The
Best Years of Our Lives" is still
available in the media center.
