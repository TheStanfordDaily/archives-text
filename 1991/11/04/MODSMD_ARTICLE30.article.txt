The sun was shining, and the fans turned
out in droves. The water polo players were
yelling out subtly obdcene cheers and taunts.
And the Stanford women's swimming team
beat Texas 174-126 in what could possibly
have been the dual meet of the season.
For the past two seasons, Texas has beaten
Stanford at the NCAAs. But could this be the
year? Has the Card broken the Texan Hex?
Well, if this dual meet was any indication, the
ladies of deGuerre have a great shot.
Summer Sanders led the way with three
individual wins. The All-American sophomore
finished first in the 100- and 200-meter but
terfly, and the 400 Individual Medley. And she
finished all three with times that qualified her
for the NCAA meet in March despite the fact
that this was Stanford's first meet of the sea
son.
Sanders also teamed up with freshman

Jenny Thompson and juniors Lea Loveless
and Lori Heisick to lead off the meet with a
win in the 400 IM, also in NCAA qualifying
time.
Great wins were also scored by Loveless in
the 100 and 200 backstroke. In both events
Loveless finished comfortably ahead of the
pack.
Another outstanding performance was that
sophomore Eileen Richetelli, who won the
three-meter diving event with a score of
278.85, almost 20 points ahead of second-place
finisher, senior Melisa Kuller.
Particularly noteworthy was the perfor
mance of the freshmen on the team.
"I'm pleased with [the Freshmen's] versa
tility. They make a great addition to the
team," said coach Richard Quick. Thompson,
Mary Ellen Blanchard and Julie Kole all fared
well.
Thompson not only swam the anchor
freestyle leg of the 400 IM, but also won the
50- and 100-meter freestyle and anchored the

400 free relay. Her time in the 100 free, a
scorching 56.65 seconds, was good enough to
qualify for the NCAAs.
Blanchard accompanied Thompson on the
winning 400 free team and also got a third in
the 200 free, a fifth in the 50 free and a fourth
in the 100 free. Kole was Stanford's best dis
tances capturing thirds in the 800 and 400
free.
And the freshman list continues. Fourth
place finishes in the 100-meter and 200-meter
breaststroke and 400 IM by Kendra Thayer
and fourth place finishes in the 100 and 200
fly by Becky Crowe show the excellence of this
year's entering class.
"I am very pleased with this team's depth.
Every stroke we were seeing someone else
come up with great swims," said Quick.
As the meet ended, anyone could tell that
the Lady Longhorns were already thinking
about the future.
"Nice meet Stanford. See you in March,"
the team yelled.
