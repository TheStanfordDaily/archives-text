## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Minus top-gun Alex O'Brien, the Stanford
men's tennis team showed why it is perenni
ally considered one of the deepest squads in
the country, dominating the early rounds of
the Rolex Northern California Collegiate
Tennis Championships at Saint Mary's Col
lege this weekend.
The Cardinal boasts four of the remaining
eight singles quarterfinalists and two of the
eight doubles teams.
Top-seeded Michael Flanagan has yet to
lose more than three games in a set as he
rolled into the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2
trouncing of California's Dan Hiddleson.
Flanagan, who reached the semifinals of the
Volvo Collegiate Championships earlier this
fall, has continued to impress coach Dick
Gould and asst coach John Whitlinger.

"Michael is hitting the ball harder, playing
smarter and setting up points better,"
Whitlinger said. "Sometimes the hardest
matches are the ones against guys you're sup
posed to beat, but Michael hasn't let up for a
second yet."
Second-seeded Jason Yee did not have as
easy a time. After dominating the first set, the
Cardinal senior was forced to save two match
points before downing San Jose State's Derek
Del Rosario 6-0, 3-6, 7-5 in yesterday's fourth
round. "Jason is working on some aspects of
his game, which is tough to do during the mid
dle of a tournament. Under the circum
stances, he's played really well," Whitlinger
said.
Not to be outdone by his older teammate,
sophomore Vimal Patel rallied from a 5-1, 40-
love deficit in the third set to edge Washing
ton's Knute Lund 3-6, 6-4, 7-6. In the fourth
round, Patel met teammate Roman Sydorak

who was forced to retire at 5-5 in the first set
because of a sprained tinkle.
The fourth quarterfinalist, sophomore
Robert Devins, blasted past seventh-seeded
Brendan Coupe of San Jose State, 7-6, 4-6, 6-
2. "Robert is one of our most talented play
ers," Whitlinger said. "And he's playing the
way we need our sophomores to play. The
work we've done so far seems to be paying
off."
Eighth-seeded Chris Cocotus, who has
been practicing extremely well this fall, was
eliminated in the fourth round yesterday as
was sophomore Billy Wright who lost a tight
third-round match.
The quarterflnalists will play at 8 a.m.
today. The doubles combinations of Cocotus
and Patel and Flanagan and Devins also will
compete today. Flanagan and Devins have lost
only two games en route to today's quarterfi
nal appearance.
