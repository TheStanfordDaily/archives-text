Stanford played host to the Pacific 10 Con
ference men's and women's Cross Country
Championships at the Stanford Golf Course
Saturday. The men's team, led by Gary Stolz's
fourth-place finish, came in fifth overall, while
the women placed sixth.
The men faced stiff competition in their
8,000-meter course run. Four Pac-10 teams,
Oregon, Arizona, Washington and Washing
ton State, are all ranked in the top 25. In the
end No. 10 Arizona upset No. 2 Oregon to take
the title.
"Though we had hoped to place higher, we
all ran well and are not ashamed of our fin
ish," Stolz said. "The Pac-10 is a very tough

conference this year."
Individually, Oregon's Colin Dal ton, the
league's top returning finisher, clocked in at a
winning time of 23:36. Arizona's Martin
Keino and Arizona State's Todd Lewis placed
second and third, respectively.
Stanford junior Gary Stolz took an impres
sive fourth place at a time of 24:02. Other
Stanford finishers include Dave Scudamore
(13th place) and Fred Carter (18th place).
As for the women's 5,000 meter competi
tion, fourth-ranked Oregon cruised to the
team title with a sweep of the first three fin
ishes. The Ducks were paced by Lisa
Karnopp's time of 16:48, Lucy Nusrala's
16:54 and Nicole Woodward's 17:03.
Oregon's final total of 38 points easily sur

passed Arizona's 58 and Washington's 75. The
Cardinal women came in sixth overall with a
total of 150 points. Jeannie Rothman was
Stanford's highest finisher in 19th place with
a time of 18:01.
The teams' next contest will be the NCAA
District 8 Championships at Woodward Park
in Fresno, where teams and individuals will
battle for berths in the NCAA Championships.
Stolz's recent performances indicate that
he is in good shape to qualify as an individual.
Also, the men's team appears to be a dark
horse contender to make the NCAAs.
Stolz adds, "Most of the teams at Regionals
will be from the Pac-10, so we now know
who's out there. I think we have a good shot to
qualify."
