# Golf takes on top teams in UCLA tourney
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team travels this weekend to
Palm Springs, hoping to get a lit
tle sun, and put all doubts about
the talented squad's potential to
rest.
Playing Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday in the UCLA Inter
collegiate, Stanford will go head
to-head with the best teams in
the nation.
San Jose State, ranked No. 2
in the nation, and winner of last
week's Stanford Intercollegiate
will be going down to southern
California, as well as the strong
Oklahoma State and Arizona
State teams.

This will be the Cardinal's
first tournament in which the
top-ranked Arizona team will
not be participating.
Stanford tees off daily at 7:30
a.m. on the Desert Dunes Golf
Course, a new course that is sup
posedly one of the best golf
courses in Palm Springs.
"The field is strong, but Ari
zona is not coming, so this
should be a good test for us,"
said coach Tim Baldwin.
Stanford is coming off a
promising performance as the
host of last week's Stanford
Intercollegiate. The Cardinal
finished third in a tough field of
top 10-ranked teams.
Sixth-ranked Stanford defeat
ed both No. 4 UCLA and No. 5

Tulsa.
The Cardinal had only two
rounds in which to perform, due
to the rain of last weekend, and
with the extra round could well
have had a shot at first place.
Qualifying to play this week
through last week's tourney
were Adele Moore, Audrey
Wooding, Stephanie Davis,
Melinda Daniels, and freshman
Jamille Jose.
Jose came into her own last
week, having the second best
Cardinal score with 77 and 73,
good for eighth place individual
ly, among the nation's best.
"We've got a good lineup
going down there. We started to
play some good golf at our tour
nament and the girls have prac

ticed well all week," Baldwin
said.
After last week's rain and
wind, the sunny skies of Palm
Springs should be a welcomed
sight for Stanford. Hopefully,
the weather will not be a repeat
of last year's tourney, where the
golfmg competition was caught
in a sandstorm.
"If we catch some good weath
er down there were going to play
some really good golf," Baldwin
said.
The Stanford linksters have
shown a constant improvement
in their three tournaments this
season, and good conditions in
Palm Springs should give them
the opportunity to put the fin
ishing touches on their games.
