Washington D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon had
prepared a speech for her Friday appearance at Kres
ge Auditorium, but her daughter wanted nothing of it.
Drew, a Stanford senior, urged her mother not to
lecture the audience of more than 150, but to speak
from her heart.
And urging the crowd to "embrace that spirit of
'yes I can, yes I will,' " Dixon put away her notes.
Dixon, Washington's first black, female mayor,
reflected on her campaign and how important young
adults were in her race to be mayor.
"Everybody that I paid left me, and the people
who stood with me were the young people of the city.
... I was the only 'old* person in the campaign.
"The campaign manager was 29; the field organiz
er was 27; my [ftind-raiser] was Drew. She was 19."
A former treasurer of the Democratic party,
Dixon also spoke of her concern that the young peo
ple of America are being forced to compensate for
the mistakes of earlier generations.

"In this last decade, we've walked away from so
many time-honored values ... the result of which we're
paying the price for today. And the group that is paying
the price most passionately are our young people."
Dixon spoke of the drug trade and the deteriora
tion of the educational system locally and nationally.
"Not surprisingly, we can see . . . the younger
generation emulating, not what we [say] we believe,
but rather what we practice."
According to Dixon, voicelessness is preventing youth
and minorities from achieving the success they deserve.
"Those of us who are African-Americans must
always see that America is where we have our stake.
Nobody who believes in this country has been more
faithful to the American dream than we have," she said.
Mayor Dixon's determination to influence young
people, especially minorities, to succeed comes from
her view that their personal gains will ultimately
benefit all of society.
"We have given so much to America for so long.
We have made the down payment," she said. "The
mortgage is paid up; this is our home.
