# ASSU set to reject change in judicial charter standard
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
"Beyond a reasonable doubt"
should remain the standard for
determining guilt in University
judicial proceedings, the ASSU
Administration and Rules Com
mittee said last week.
The committee voted 3-1 on
Thursday night to send a bill to the
full senate rejecting the Committee
of 15's proposal to make "clear and
convincing evidence" the Universi
ty's new standard of proof.
"We got the sense that many,
many senators were opposed to
sections of [the Committee of 15's
report]," said ASSU Senate Chair
Kevin Warsh. "The large parts of
the C-15 report failed as it went
through the Administration and
Rules Committee."
The Committee of 15 is a facul
ty, student and staff committee
empowered to suggest amend

ments to the Legislative and Judi
cial Charter. In order for the char
ter to be amended, the C-15's pro
posals have to be ratified by the
ASSU Senate, the University Aca
demic Council and the president.
The Committee of 15's propos
als were considered by the rules
committee in their four sections,
which cover rights of victims,
cooperation of student witnesses,
cooperation of the accused and
the standard of proof.
The rules committee then pro
posed changes to or rejected each
of the four major sections and sent
bills concerning each section to
the full senate for action at tomor
row night's meeting, Warsh said.
Committee of 15 Chair Debo
rah Rhode said the proposed sen
ate bill was a step in the wrong
direction. "I obviously am disap
pointed by this and disagree with
it substantively," she said.
Rhode said under either stan
dard "the same sorts of evidence"
are considered for proof of guilt, the
difference in the standards being
the amount of certainty required.
The "generally accepted fig
ures" for certainty of guilt are 90
to 99 percent under a "beyond a
reasonable doubt" standard and
65 to 90 percent under a "clear
and convincing evidence" stan
dard, Rhode said.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck, co-author of the
bill opposing the proposal, said he
felt such a change would lead to the
punishment of innocent people.
"Right off they're conceding
that 10 to 35 percent of the people
they convict are innocent," he
said of the "clear and convincing"
standard. "I don't necessarily see
the need, in these borderline
cases, to risk punishing 30 per
cent of the innocent people."
Rules committee member Raphe
Beck, a senior, cast the only dis
senting vote.
"It's a dangerous change because
it opens the way for innocent people
to be convicted of charges more eas
ily," Beck said. But it is "clear the
system we have here isn't just,"
especially in dealing with cases of

sexual assault, he said.
If any changes to the judicial
charter are made, they will have
to be consistent with the ASSU
Constitution, Warsh noted. The
ASSU Constitution currently con
. tains the reasonable doubt stan
dard and could not be amended
until the spring elections, he said.
Warsh said, however, that he
feared the University might
change the standard regardless of
the ASSU Constitution. "Univer
sity officials have said we should
disregard our constitution for a
while, pass this and then fix the
constitution," he said. "We don't
think necessarily that it should be
done for the sake of expediency."
Overdeck said the University
might try to impose such a change
in violation of the ASSU Consti
tution. "The University has vio
lated its trust with the students
before," he said. Overdeck said if
the changes are made without
ASSU cooperation "the students
are in a position where they have
to fight the University.
"The most extreme case is that
the ASSU might see within its
purview to provide support to stu
dents found guilty under the new
standard," Overdeck said. "At
that point we have to decide
whether we want to take the Uni
versity to court."
Overdeck said, however, that
he hopes events never reach that
point.
