# New health benefits called unfair by some
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Some faculty and staff mem
bers say they are outraged over
the University's decision to raise
health insurance rates for non
union, single employees while low
ering rates for married employees
and those with families.
Anthropology Asst. Prof. Carol
Delaney termed the new struc
ture "unfair," saying "Stanford
hires individuals, not families."
She added, "The inequities
between family benefits and sin
gle benefits are becoming very
pronounced."

Before the change, health
insurance was free for single
employees, who could choose
from several variably priced
plans. But under the new system,
single employees will pay $25 to
$31 per month.
By contrast, the change will
lower rates for couples by up to
$40 a month, and families may
save as much as $80 per month. A
family is defined as an employee
plus two or more dependents.
Union employees will not be
affected by the change because
the United Stanford Workers
decided against the new rate
structure when signing their con
tract this year.
Single, union employees will
continue to have free cov-

erage, and families will
still pay between $189
and $242 per month.
Couples will continue to
be charged between $93
and $133 each month,
more than non-union
employees under the new
structure.
As a single person,
Delaney said she has
found it "extremely hard
to make it at Stanford"
with only one income.
She added that single
employees with only one
income receive fewer

benefits than married employees,
who generally have two incomes.
Barbara Butterfield, vice presi
dent of Human Resources, said
there were two main reasons for
the change in rates, which will go
into effect next April.
The first reason, she said, was
to create "cost-conscious con
sumership" of the benefits, forc
ing single employees to be more
selective when choosing a health
plan. The second reason she gave
was creating competition between
plans to improve their quality and
reduce their prices.
Butterfield said many married
employees are covered under both

Stanford's plan and a spouse's
plan. That becomes costly if the
married employees use their
spouse's plan rather than Stan
ford's, because the University is
covering an expense that has
already been paid once.
Butterfield expects those "dou
ble enrollments" to decrease now

that married insurance rates have
been decreased.
Those rates have been reduced,
she said, because her office
expects the "decrease in cost from
competition and the decrease in
double enrollment" to make their
plans less expensive.
"The motives for this action
were a good design for the
future," Butterfield said, "not a
bias against a certain lifestyle."
The decision has been particu
larly upsetting to gay, lesbian and
bisexual employees, who are sin
gle with respect to the University
benefits because their relation
ships are not legally recognized.

Thomas Holt, assistant librari
an at Green Library, criticized the
disparity in how much the Uni
versity spends on married
employee benefits compared to
single benefits. He said married
employees receive several benefits
— such as tuition discounts for
spouses — that single employees

cannot receive.
"The University owes
it to employees to cover
them before families,"
he said. "It shouldn't
discriminate against sin
gle or gay, lesbian or
bisexual employees. It's
unfair to ask single
employees to defray
costs of married employ
ee benefits."
But Butterfield said,
"It has nothing to do
with a desire to subsi
dize. It has to do with
everybody being a cost
conscious shopper."

She recognized that employees
who have same-sex or opposite
sex domestic partners who aren't
covered elsewhere are hit the
hardest by the change and said
her office is beginning to work on
resolving that issue.
Holt proposed a "cafeteria
style" benefits program, where
each employee would "pick and
choose benefits up to a certain
limit" and pay only for those that
they want.
Alice Bach, assistant professor
of religious studies, agreed with
Holt's suggestion, adding she
found the system of benefits itself
"inequitable."
