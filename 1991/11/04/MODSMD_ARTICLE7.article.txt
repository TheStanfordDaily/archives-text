# Students reach out Saturday
## 
### Julia Sobrevilla 
Nearly 1,000 Stanford stu
dents spent Saturday planting
acorns, reading stories, cleaning
out homeless shelters and tak
ing care of disabled children.
The eighth annual "Reach
Out Today" program channeled
the energies of some 60 Stan
ford organizations into dozens
of community service projects
throughout the Bay Area.
But for one 3-year-old, cap
tivated by the tale of "Pig Pig
and the Magic Photo Album,"
the project didn't go any far
ther than sophomore volun
teer Steven Heckler, who read
him the story.
"I wouldn't like a pig in my
birthday cake because it snores
at me," said Daniel, listening to
the stories read by volunteers
from Alpha Phi Omega at the
Palo Alto Children's Library.
Andrew, 5, gave senior
Charles Hokanson a big hug
when he left the library.
Hokanson helped him find
books on dinosaurs, then read
them to him.
Not far away, 10 volunteers
from Loro in Florence Moore
Hall were taking care of chil
dren from the Santa Clara
Crippled Children's Society.
Kumi, 9, pushed a wheel
chair, laughing in the sunshine,
while Matthew enjoyed himself
watching freshman Selvi Bata
subraman jumping the rope he
was holding. The children are

mentally and physically disabled Matthew cannot
walk and can barely talk; Kumi is mentally retarded.
Flo Mo volunteers chose the project because
they wanted to work one-on-one with kids. But
the volunteers were surprised at how impaired
the kids were, said Batasubraman, who was in
charge of the project. "We all expected them to be
more advanced," she said.
The event was organized and sponsored by the
Stanford Volunteer Network.
Network organizers matched residences,
sororities and fraternities hoping to volunteer
with projects ranging from planting trees in the
Oakland neighborhoods destroyed by fire to
cleaning homeless shelters in San Jose.
Megan Swezey, assistant director of the Haas
Public Service Center, described this year's pro
gram as the best in its eight-year history and said
students' attitudes toward community service
have changed in that time.
A decade ago, she said, students saw the pro
gram — and the social issues with which it is con
cerned — as a one-day event. "They now care about
learning about the issues" and want to "learn how
the organizations work" to help, she said.
"Reach Out Today" organizers held this year's
program in conjunction with a national event
called "Into the Streets," a national college com
munity service program.
Organizers spent much of the last few months
coming up with project ideas, recruiting volun
teers and fending off minor organizational prob
lems.
