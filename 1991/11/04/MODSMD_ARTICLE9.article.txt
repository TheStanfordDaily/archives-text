# Fears, apathy create 'Slump'
## 
### Alain Dalva 
After an exciting freshman
year filled with warm welcomes
and new friends, some students
enter a hibernation phase — the
infamous sophomore slump.
"Friends from your freshman
dorm have scattered away, you
worry about declaring a major, you
try to build new relationships
again," junior Jeff Jakubiak said. "I
grew so much intellectually as well
as emotionally during my freshman
year, and in sophomore year it just
ended," he added, describing his
sophomore year as a "great void."
Senior Tty Rahi recalled even
more tragic moments. "I just want
ed to drop out, I had no motivation
to work," she said. "I didn't care. I
was just happy being depressed."

Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, said he finds two recurring
patterns in the sophomore slump.
One of them, "the need to make
difficult decisions about the
future," haunts many sophomores
who have to declare a major and
who do not feel ready, he said.
Most sophomores experience
the other pattern, an "existential
loneliness," because they have just
lost the community that shaped
their freshman year, he added.
Both Rahi and Jakubiak agreed
the loss of their freshman commu
nity was the main cause of their
slump. They both confronted a
social vacuum when sophomore
year swept away the tight and sup
portive social network their fresh
man dorm had created, they said.

Jakubiak stressed the impor
tance of academic decisions. To
ease a slump partly caused by aca
demic uncertainties, "declaring a
m£yor and putting directions in
your life do help," he said.
Martinez sees the sophomore
slump as part of a developmental
process. "In freshman year, stu
dents receive a lot of support which
they do need," he noted. "Then,
during sophomore year, they need
to develop a sense of self-efficacy."
He stressed that people should
"give themselves more opportuni
ties, make room for mistakes in
order to grow from that experience."
He deplored an intolerance for
making mistakes at Stanford,
explaining mistakes are part of
the process that will lead students
out of the slump.
