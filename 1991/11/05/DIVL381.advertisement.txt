Individual initiative has always
played a major role in
Schlumberger's growth and
technological leadership. Today,
Schlumherger employs 53,000
people in 97 countries with annual
revenues in excess of $5 billion.
Schlumherger is comprised of two
main business groups: oilfield
services, which offers a complete
range of energy exploration and
recovery services; and
Measurement and Systems which
produces everything from utility
meters to CAD/CAM systems.
The Schlumherger Companies
value individual initiative.
If you'd rather lead than follow,

along with taking responsibility for
the work you direct, contact us
today. We'll give you the support,
training and opportunity you need
to meet the challenge.
