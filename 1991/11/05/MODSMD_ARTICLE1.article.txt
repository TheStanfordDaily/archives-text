# Severe cuts threaten music performance programs

### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Many faculty and students in
the music department are lament
ing a recent decision that perfor
mance programs, rather than the
department in general, will be tar
geted for budget cuts.
The decision could be the
requiem for Stanford's popular
Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.)
program, department officials said
yesterday.
"It's a really unfortunate deci

Harrison. "We should be taking a
look at the whole program instead of
focusing on (cutting) the thing that
makes us most attractive to stu

Humanities and Sciences Asst.
Dean Carolyn Lougee said the
decision was made by an ad hoc
humanities planning group, whijch
has studied budget alternatives in
humanities programs since March.
The music department is on
the committee's "A" list of pro
grams which are subject to light
budget reduction but not deep
cuts. Music performance, howev
er, is on the "B" list â€” programs
that are subject to severe reduc
tion and possible elimination.
Music Dept. Chair Karol Berger
said the the performance program
will be targeted for cuts by necessi
ty rather than choice. He said
expenses in the department's

other programs consist almost
entirely of tenured faculty, who
cannot be fired.
"We have really little choice as
to where to look for possible
cuts," he said.
However, some members of the
department, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, said Berger
has barely supported the perform
ing arts during his five-year
tenure at Stanford.
"His position has been that the
performing arts don't have a place
at a research university," said one
faculty member.
Berger's approach has compro
mised the position of the perform-
