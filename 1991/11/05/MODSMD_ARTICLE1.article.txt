# Severe cuts threaten music performance programs
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Many faculty and students in
the music department are lament
ing a recent decision that perfor
mance programs, rather than the
department in general, will be tar
geted for budget cuts.
The decision could be the
requiem for Stanford's popular
Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.)
program, department officials said
yesterday.
"It's a really unfortunate deci
sion," said Senior Lecturer Stephen
Harrison. "We should be taking a
look at the whole program instead of
focusing on (cutting) the thing that
makes us most attractive to stu

dents."
Humanities and Sciences Asst.
Dean Carolyn Lougee said the
decision was made by an ad hoc
humanities planning group, whijch
has studied budget alternatives in
humanities programs since March.
The music department is on
the committee's "A" list of pro
grams which are subject to light
budget reduction but not deep
cuts. Music performance, howev
er, is on the "B" list — programs
that are subject to severe reduc
tion and possible elimination.
Music Dept. Chair Karol Berger
said the the performance program
will be targeted for cuts by necessi
ty rather than choice. He said
expenses in the department's

other programs consist almost
entirely of tenured faculty, who
cannot be fired.
"We have really little choice as
to where to look for possible
cuts," he said.
However, some members of the
department, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, said Berger
has barely supported the perform
ing arts during his five-year
tenure at Stanford.
"His position has been that the
performing arts don't have a place
at a research university," said one
faculty member.
Berger's approach has compro
mised the position of the perform-
another faculty member said.
"It's no surprise that humanities
and sciences decided to make the
cuts in the performance pro
gram."
Graduate student Michael
Rosewall, who has spearheaded
the grass-roots "Save the arts at
Stanford" movement, said stu
dents fear Berger will not be an
advocate for them. "We are afraid
that he will not support the
D.M A. program or performance,"
he said.
Berger defended his commit
ment to the performance pro
gram. "I think that I am on record
as a very strong advocate of per
formance at the undergraduate

level," he said.
On the graduate level, he
added, "We should have those
programs which are absolutely
top-notch or have a very good
chance of becoming extremely
good within a short period of
time. The programs that are not
as strong should probably not be
supported as strongly."
Berger would not say whether
he feels the D.M.A. program fits
that criterion.
Music Prof. George Houle said
the 29-year-old program, which
combines the study of music theo
ry and history with practice and
performance, is extremely suc
cessful and has been emulated by
other universities.
In recent years the University
of Indiana, Cornell, Case-Western
Reserve and Duke Universities
have developed programs mod

eled after Stanford's, he said.
About 90 percent of students
offered admission to the program
accept, Houle said. "An awful lot
of our graduates have gone on to
top positions at other institutions
and in performing," he added.
Houle said six of the 15 stu
dents now pursuing Ph. D.sin
musicology initially came to Stan
ford as D.MA candidates.
The large number of
untenured faculty and lecturers
"leaves us extremely vulnerable
to people who look around for
easy ways to cut money," said
Houle.
"It's shortsighted because
we've assembled a magnificent
group of people in performance,"
he said. Having non-tenured lec
turers "costs us a lot less than if
we had to hire professorial peo
ple."
