# Haitian students long for democracy at home

### Rob Axelrod 
When Haiti's first demo
cratically elected president was
deposed in the Nov. 30 coup,
some Haitian students at Stan
ford say they witnessed an all
too-familiar scene: The deposi
tion of a Haitian leader on the
whim of the military.
"It's so frustrating," said
junior Paul Namphy. "I have
all these plans for Haiti, and
every time, the military won't
even give democracy a chance."
Namphy said the generals
in the military may not have
felt secure with now-deposed
president Jean-Bertrand Aris
tide because he was not a mili
tary man. Their reaction, as
has often been the case in
Haiti, was a swift usurpation
of the president's powers.
"The military is full of vain,
self-righteous people," said
graduate student Milliardaire
Syverain, secretary of the
Stanford Haitian-American
Students' Association. "Aris
tide also wanted to tax Haitian
big business. They had never
done that before â€” who knows
how much they owed? Some

businesses may have paid for
the coup themselves."
Both Namphy and Syverain
applaud the recent decision by
the Organization of American
States to impose an embargo
on Haiti, but while Syverain
believes the embargo is the
only way to purge the military
from Haiti, Namphy is more
reserved in his judgement.
"The people are devastat
ed," he said, adding that he is
not sure they can live through
more suffering.
Syverain acknowledged the
suffering, but said, "The mass
es have always suffered. This
time, the elite class will [also!'
feel the pinch of the embargo."
"Haiti is a very proud coun
try," said Namphy. "We were
the first free black republic in
the world, but now, we need
help. We are appealing to Stan
ford University, President
Donald Kennedy, the
Caribbean Student Associa
tion, the Black Student Union,
to support Aristide and Haiti's
quest for democracy. . . . We
must mobilize support now, or
we will become a forgotten
group of people."
