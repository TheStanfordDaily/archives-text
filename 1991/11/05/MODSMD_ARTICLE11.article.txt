# Also on tonight's agenda

Tonight's ASSU Senate meet
ing will focus on judicial charter
tions of process,
along with the elimination of the
Fundamental Standard inter
pretation banning some discrim
inatory speech.
The senate will consider a bill
rejecting the proposed judicial
charter change from "beyond a
reasonable doubt" to "clear and
convincing evidence," a less
strenuous standard of proof.
The change was recom
mended by the Committee of
15, a faculty, student and staff
committee empowered to sug
gest amendments to the Leg
islative and Judicial Charter.
The senate is also scheduled
to debate three other Commit
tee of 15 recommendations,
including one on the coopera

tion of witnesses and suspects
in Stanford judicial cases.
The bill approved by the
ASSU Administration and Rules
Committee opposes the recom
mendation, saying that among
other problems the change
would force people to cooperate
even when their testimony could
be used against them later in a
criminal or civil case.
The committee also proposed
changes to the Committee of 15
recommendations outlining the
rights of the complainant, citing
vagueness and the possibility
that a charge could be brought
against someone by an anony
mous complainant
Another bill would change
the spring elections process by
eliminating spending limits
and the runoff election for the
Council of Presidents.
