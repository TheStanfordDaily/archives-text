Millions strike in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -
Millions of blacks went on strike yesterday as
anti-apartheid groups shut down large parts of
the economy in a bid to force the white govern
ment to share power. At least 19 people were
killed in strike violence.
The massive strike, which was to continue
today, was officially called to protest a new tax. But
it was widely seen as a power struggle between the
government and black opposition groups.
Court to judge racial exclusion
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court
said yesterday it will consider barring criminal
defendants from using race as the basis for
excluding potential jurors from their trials.
The court, which already has outlawed race
based exclusions made by prosecutors, said it
will study an appeal in which Georgia prosecu
tors say such racial bias is unlawful no matter
who practices it.
Feds may lower rates again
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve, frustrated so far in efforts to jump
start a weak economy, will decide today to lower
interest rates once again, many private
economists predicted.
However, opinion was divided on the ques
tion of whether a new round of rate cuts will be
enough to avoid a double-dip recession.
