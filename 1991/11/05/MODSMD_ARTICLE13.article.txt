# First round of Mideast talks ends
## Arabs, Israelis reach few agreements but promise more direct meetings 
### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — Arabs and
Israelis went home yesterday with
mixed feelings of frustration and
anticipation after an intense foray into
the realm of peace. Israel and Syria
were mired in recriminations, but
promised to meet again.
Few concrete achievements result
ed from last week's three-day Middle
East conference and the three sets of
direct Israeli-Arab talks that ended
early yesterday with a bitter Israeli-
Syrian session.
But the talks smashed a 43-year
taboo on direct Israeli-Arab talks, set
ting in motion a process of face-to-face
negotiations to resolve one of the most
intractable regional conflicts in the
world.
The United States and Soviet
Union sponsored the talks, and
President Bush's assessment was:
"We have a long way to go and inter
ruptions will probably occur, but
hopes are bright."
The brightest are for negotiations
between Israel and the 1.7 million
Palestinians living under its military
rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The dimmest are for a thaw between
Israel and Syria, the region's strongest
military powers, and most bitter foes.
"I would like to express our regret
for leaving this city without having

tangible results," said Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
In a reminder of how relentless the
conflict is, hard-line Israelis inaugu
rated a new Jewish settlement in the
Golan Heights just hours after the
talks ended. Syria's main demand is
for the return of the Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast
war.
There were also reports that Israeli
troops shelled the positions of radical
Muslim guerrillas in Lebanon.
In the Iranian capital of Tehran,
Shiite Muslim demonstrators burned
American and Israeli flags and an effi
gy of Uncle Sam outside the former
U.S. Embassy compound to mark its
takeover 13 years ago by Iranian radi
cals. •
The late-night talks in Madrid were
the first-ever direct discussion
between Israel and Syria and they last
ed five hours. But the enemies failed to
move even an inch from their posi
tions, or even shake hands. Even cof
fee breaks were taken in separate
rooms.
Syria refused an Israeli request to
establish direct contacts to arrange the
site for the next round of talks, sched
uled Later this month.
Nonetheless, both agreed to meet
again — if the United States comes up

with an acceptable location. Officials
on both sides said Washington or other
sites in North America were possible.
An Israeli spokesperson said yester
day that Israel would still prefer that
the talks be held alternately in Israel
and Syria, or along their border. But
Syria remained just as adamantly in
favor of a neutral site and accused
Israel of being intransigent.
According to both sides, it was a dia
logue of the deaf.
Israel's delegates "talked about
everything except the land that the
Israelis occupied and have been occu
pying for the last 24 years. That is the
Golan Heights," al-Sharaa said.
The Israelis countered that Syria's
demand for Israeli concessions domi
nated the meeting. "If they keep up
their . . . demands, there will not be
any progress," said Israeli spokesper
son Yossi Olmert.
Syria stuck to its long-held position
that Israel must give up lands cap
tured in 1967 from the Syrians, the
Jordanians and the Egyptians, before
anything else was discussed.
Israel repeatedly insisted territorial
concessions were unrelated to its goal
— a peace treaty with Syria.
Syria reiterated its refusal to attend
regional talks that are to begin in
about three weeks among the coun

tries of the region to debate issues
such as arms control and water
resources.
Jordan, clearly pleased with its part
in the talks, said it would attend the
regional discussions.
During nearly five hours of talks on
Sunday, Israel and a joint Jordanian-
Palestinian delegation agreed on a
two-track approach — Israel will nego
tiate separately with the Jordanians
and the Palestinians.
