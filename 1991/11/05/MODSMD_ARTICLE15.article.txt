Visibility a necessary
attribute of our next
University President

AT MOST UNIVERSITIES,
students see the president
twice: at orientation and at
graduation. The president remains
a mysterious bureaucrat — sur
rounded by aides and secretaries,
encased in red tape and wrapped in
a veil of secrecy.
But for the last 12 years at Stan
ford, the man in Building 10 has
been an extremely visible presence
on campus.
As it embarks on the process of
selecting the next Stanford presi
dent, the Presidential Search
Committee must make it a top pri
ority to choose someone who is
willing and understands how to
interact with students as well as
current president Donald Kennedy
has.
People may disagree about
Kennedy's merits as a financial
overseer, about his role in the
changeover from Western Culture
to Cultures, Ideas and Values or
about his push for a renewed
emphasis on undergraduate teach
ing over research. But it's hard to
deny that he's been very open with
students.
It is unrealistic to expect a uni
versity president to be completely
forthcoming about every issue.
But Kennedy, to an impressive
degree, has made himself available
to students and has treated them
as an important part of the Uni
versity.
For example, students who can
keep up with Kennedy are invited

to join him in a twice-weekly jog up
to the Dish, a time in which he'll
discuss his views on various issues.
And after the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, he let a group of
homeless students stay in Hoover
House.
Kennedy is often seen at dorm
talks and dinners. Each year a
small group of freshmen learn that
their academic adviser is the presi
dent — an honor few students at
other universities can claim.
In addition to contact on a per
sonal level, Kennedy has kept stu
dents informed about important
University decisions. Students
need to feel that the next president
realizes their stake in crucial Uni
versity issues.
The president's attitudes set the
standard for all University officials.
Now that Kennedy is on the way
out, there is already a noticeable
trend toward aloofness among some
administrators. This trend must be
stopped by the appointment of a
straightforward successor.
Stanford students may have
taken Kennedy's openness for
granted and now believe that any
one the search committee chooses
will follow Kennedy's suit.
While students deserve a presi
dent who is open, there is no guar
antee that Stanford's next presi
dent will aim for the same level of
student-administration glasnost.
Surely, a president's style of
interaction will differ from person
to person; "willingness to talk with
students while jogging to the Dish"
should not be a job specification.
But the next president must
treat students as a vital part of the
University and realize they cannot
be kept in the dark about high
level decisions that will irrevocably
shape their Stanford experience.
