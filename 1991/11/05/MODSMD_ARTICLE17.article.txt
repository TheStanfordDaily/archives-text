## In defense of a male CEO 
### 
WE HAD JUST LISTENED TO the
chief executive officer of a huge
corporation discuss the absence of
women in upper-level corporate positions.
He told us he'd recently given a senior
financial position to a woman who was
not fully qualified. In essence, he'd asked
his personnel office to recommend the
most qualified woman — he hadn't even
considered men.
Clearly, he admitted, she was not com
pletely ready for the job, and she had a
difficult time because of it. But this male
CEO noted she had been successful at her
new position.
I was surprised by the reaction of my
female friends in the class. They were dis
turbed by this man's "protective,"
"patronizing" and "paternalistic" atti
tude toward women, and by the fact that
he had hired a "token" woman.
I tried to understand.
If I were a woman and I got a job part
ly because of my gender, I would feel
indignant. But I probably wouldn't pass
up the chance to prove my ability, and I
certainly wouldn't be angry at the man
who offered me the job.
I would be upset that such action is
necessary. Historically, women have been
denied access to many segments of the
workplace.
But that's not this man's fault. He's
trying to accelerate a change in this situ
ation. If he waited to promote women

who had reached those upper levels and
been sufficiently experienced, it would be
at least another generation before we saw
any appreciable change.
He cannot change history. But he can
affect the present and the future. He prob
ably believes such hirings and promotions
are an inevitable, albeit unpalatable, path
toward the quickest dismantling of gender
imbalances in the workplace. Likely, he
views them as a temporary means toward
changing the status quo — the same status
quo that has enforced the barriers keeping
women from gaining necessary experience.
We should recognize that this man is
doing what he can to weaken those barri
ers: He is giving women a chance to suc
ceed despite their lack of previous experi
ence. This does not reflect an attitude that
women are intellectually inferior to men.
In fact, if anything, it reflects the opposite.
Indeed, this man has faith in women's
intelligence and their ability to succeed
despite their lack of experience. Enough so
that he will promote women to very
important positions — ones for which they
might not be fully qualified — because he
believes that women are capable of over
coming such disadvantages, and he wants
to give them a chance to prove it.
I'm not advocating tokenism.
But I do think that people who clamor for
the rapid elimination of inequities yet simul
taneously decry such "tokenism" must rec
ognize the paradox. Often these people ben

efit from such preferences, and they should
admit that such partiality might be neces
sary to accomplish their desires.
They have to acknowledge that the
rest of the world is not like Stanford,
where men's and women's intellects are
assumed to be equal.
They have to remember that the best
way to convince men that women are
indeed capable is for women to attain
positions and succeed alongside their
male counterparts. They have to acknowl
edge that one of the few ways they can get
into these positions in a hurry is through
such "token" promotions.
Obviously, that doesn't mean they like
it. But they have to remember that
although this CEO might be a symbol of
a power structure that has denied women
opportunities, by initiating change he is
in fact leading the charge against perpet
uation of an unequal environment.
Thus it seems ironic that those who
were offended by his story were women.
For, although being upset by reality's
message seems justified, being angry at
its messenger does not.
