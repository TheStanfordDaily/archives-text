Police, government waste too much time on petty rules

THIS UNIVERSITY, STATE AND
entire country are being swamped
by ridiculous regulations, applied
with no common sense, and an absence
of reasonable behavior by the agencies of
government who are supposed to be
serving us.
Cycling and parking on Stanford cam
pus are great examples. With a popula
tion of 20,000, many of whom cycle
daily, fewer than 100 accidents a year is
probably less than one might expect.
You must remember we could prevent
all accidents by having cyclists preceded
by men with red flags, or even by ban
ning them altogether.
The serious point here is that as a
society we make trade-offs between effi
ciency and safety. Everyone knows stop
ping completely at every stop sign (and
there are far too many of them in Cali
fornia and Stanford) may prevent a

small number of accidents every year
(although probably only a handful).
However, it also causes cyclists to
waste far more time and costs them far
more energy than if they roll slowly
through the junctions with the minimal
risk this entails. Most cyclists apparently
would prefer to take that risk, as evi
denced by the fact that they generally
don't come to a halt at stop signs.
The cyclists are making an informed
judgment by balancing the risks vs. the
rewards of their actions. Stopping and
fining those who do this is clearly apply
ing a ridiculous regulation with no use
of common sense.
Next is the issue of the absence of
reasonable behavior by the police. News
circulates very well through the Stan
ford community. It would not have been
hard for the police to inform the commu
nity that there was going to be a crack-

down on cyclists, without making unnec
essary scapegoats of an unlucky few.
Similarly, if the police didn't want
people to park on the median of Campus
Drive during the Mausoleum party on
Halloween, they could have put up signs
at the spot or announced it via public
address at the party itself.
Instead, officers were sent between
11:30 p.m. and midnight to give parking
tickets to the 30 or 40 cars parked there.
Even if this valuable piece of "land
scaped property" needed protecting at
such an hour, why wasn't this made
known before, considering that (as an
officer on duty told me) "we know people
historically have always parked here for
this event"?
Who is directing these actions? Can
someone explain what their benefit is to
the community? Or is this just another
hidden tax that can't be voted on?

On my way home last night I was
passed by an East Palo Alto police car
speeding to an incident. In East Palo
Alto, children and grandmothers are at
risk from drive-by shootings and gang
related violence.
Fiscal problems there have recently
caused cutbacKS in police levels in an
area that has far more serious crime
than Stanford. Three miles away the
most important use of highly-trained
police manpower seems to be to harass
cyclists and write out ridiculous parking
tickets.
Currently, the role of all levels of gov
ernment seems to be the creation of
petty regulations and the harassment of
citizens, while ignoring the deep and
serious problems in American society.
