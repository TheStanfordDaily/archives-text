# Papp's words apply to importance of keeping arts alive at Stanford
## 
### 
Joseph Papp died last week. He was
halfway through his latest project,
putting on stage all of Shakespeare's
work. In a National Public Radio piece
memorializing him, the station ran a
recent interview, and Papp spoke about
the importance of theater to the written
work. Theater, he said, is a living art,
and understanding drama as literature
is inextricably tied to its performance.
Papp's words are particularly perti
nent to something that many may not
realize is happening at Stanford. In light
of the necessary budget cutbacks, the
administration is reviewing the perform
ing arts (music and drama) and the stu
dio art programs and may entirely
remove them from the curriculum.

Both the small size and perceived
value of these departments' contribution
to the University will be considered by
the administration.
There is something poignant about
the mix of Papp's words with the news
that Stanford may eliminate these pro
grams. The performing and studio arts
are not merely some expendable
appendage of the humanities that can be
discarded without diminishing the value
of the whole discipline.
Even to consider this move implies a
restricted and simplistic idea of the place
that performance and art play in the
humanities. These departments are inte
gral to the overall quality of the humani
ties program.
If Stanford wants to become a special
ized school like MIT, then the choice to
eliminate these programs perhaps makes
sense. However, if Stanford wants to
retain its reputation as a great liberal
arts university, then this review is
unthinkable.

That one of the foremost universities
in the country may move its humanities
program into the margin of its academic
curriculum creates doubts about Stan
ford's commitment to liberal arts educa
tion.
