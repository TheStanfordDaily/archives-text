# Senate revives Standard debate
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
An ASSU committee is urging
the repeal of the Fundamental
Standard interpretation banning
some discriminatory speech, re
opening a two-year-old debate on
speech restrictions at Stanford.
The Administration and Rules
committee has sent a bill advocat
ing that the interpretation be
dropped to the full ASSU Senate
for debate at tonight's meeting.
The interpretation of the
Standard, written by Law Prof.
Thomas Grey, forbids speech
"intended to insult or stigmatize
an individual ... on the basis of
their sex, race, color, handicap,
religion, sexual orientation, or
national and ethnic origin."
Two years ago, the senate
ended months of heated debate
by voting to accept the new inter
pretation. But the ASSU decided
to take another look at it follow
ing a recent federal case overrul
ing a similar speech standard at
the University of Wisconsin, said
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck, co-author of the
ASSU bill.
The standard will not neces
sarily be re-examined even if the
full senate passes the bill tonight,
Overdeck said. "I believe that our
statements would come with no
authority," he said.
According to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter, any change
in the Fundamental Standard
interpretation would have to be
proposed by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, a body com
posed of six Academic Council
members, five students and the
Dean of Students.
According to Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole, "any member of
the community can present an
agenda for the SCLC to consider."
However, Cole said, it is ultimately
up to the SCLC to decide whether
to propose changes or not.
"The senate does not have the
authority to order the SCLC to do
something," graduate senator
Douglas Bone said.
Overdeck, however, said he
believes it is important to recon
sider the speech code.
"I think it's dawning on people
again to what extent [the Grey
interpretation] is a severe limita
tion on free speech," Overdeck
said. "I don't feel confident
enough in the University to place
in their hands the ability to
restrict constitutional rights."
But Grey said the Wisconsin
ruling does not directly apply to
Stanford â€” because unlike
Wisconsin, Stanford is a private
institution. "The First Amend
ment doesn't apply to Stanford,
directly at least," he said. "The
Constitution only applies to the
government."
Bone, however, said that
although Stanford may not be
required to abide by the same rules
as public universities, the ASSU
Senate approved the Grey inter
pretation with the understanding
that "Stanford should abide by the
First Amendment in its activities.
"There wasn't a definitive
statement that this standard was
good regardless of the provisions
of the Constitution," he said. "I
don't think that Stanford should
take away rights that are avail
able to other students elsewhere."
Grey said he did not see the
need for Stanford to imitate pub
lic universities. "I can see some
one saying Stanford should have
the same standards as a state uni
versity, but I disagree," he said.
In addition, Grey said, the Wis
consin code was much broader

than Stanford's. "They had some
fairly loose terminology," he said.
"I wouldn't have been in favor of
[the Wisconsin code] myself."
Grey pointed out that the Wis
consin ruling was on the federal
district court level, and might not
carry as much importance as a
Supreme Court ruling would.
"It's a ruling by one of the thou
sand or so federal district judges
in this country in a different dis
trict" from Stanford, he said.
If the Supreme Court were to
rule on the Wisconsin code, the Uni
versity might have to re-examine its
own speech standards, Grey said.
However, he said he would likely
support the current interpretation
even if the Supreme Court were to
rule against the Wisconsin code.
Bone, however, said the Wis
consin ruling simply piqued the
senate's interest in the Grey
interpretation.
"These questions were there
before. Now they're just magni
fied a bit," he said.
