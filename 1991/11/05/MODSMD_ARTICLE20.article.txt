Reading Ronald Hilton's viewpoint in
the Nov. 1 Daily sickened me. It remind
ed me of how a minority of Hoover
scholars seem to believe that their lofty
altitude above the University gives their
views a special Tightness that others
don't have.

What Hilton seems to have forgotten
is that in the "great university tradi
tion" he describes, everyone belongs to a
community of equals. No one should
proclaim that his or her opinion is infal
lible.
There is just as much chance for an
emeritus professor in Hoover to be
"wrong" as there is for a lowly freshman
in Stern Hall to be "right."
I, too, believe there are things wrong
with the University. I, too, believe that
Hoover may have been unfairly excluded
from the presidential selection process.
However, if Hilton has been unfairly
excluded, let him be heard as part of the
community, and let him admit that he,
too, may be wrong in his opinions.
As a member of the refuge of "fools
and louts" Hilton calls the Quad, let me
say that just because one takes an eleva
tor to work every morning, one does not
leave foolish attitudes on the ground.
