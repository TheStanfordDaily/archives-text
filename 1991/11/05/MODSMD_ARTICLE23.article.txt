house then teamed up to win the doubles
title 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 over California's Valerie
Poulos and Lisa Parks.
Poruri, the tournament's third seed,
appeared to be in control of the singles
match from the beginning. Her first break
came in the fourth game of the first set,
putting her up 3-1. She continued playing
aggressive tennis, painting the baseline
with her groundstrokes and charging the
net.
"I was very relaxed out there — I just
went with the flow," Poruri said. "I felt
like I was hitting all my shots, and when I
made a mistake I knew what I had to do to
correct it."
Poruri did not make many mistakes, as
she finished out the first set with another
break of service. Although Johnson tried
to mix up her shots, Poruri was able to run
them down and come up with a response,

often a blistering cross-court passing shot.
The second set got off to a rocky start,
with Johnson double-faulting the second
game away and Poruri returning the favor
in the third. Johnson was broken three
more times before Poruri closed out the
match with a cross-court forehand that
whizzed by her opponent at the net.
"Both of us were tired from the past few
days (of playing tennis), but I think I was
able to use that to my advantage," Poruri
said. "This match was a real confidence
builder for me."
After only a few minutes of rest, John
son took the court again with Woodhouse
to meet Cal's tandem. The first set went
back and forth, with the Cardinal pair win
ning three straight games to go up 5-4 and
then losing three straight.
Following a strong second set, the Stan
ford team again appeared to be in trouble
at 1-3 in the third. Powerful serving by
both players brought the score to 3-4, set
ting up a pivotal eighth game.
At 30-30 Poulos double faulted, and a
backhand volley punched cross-court by
Woodhouse on the next point evened
things at 4-4. The next game saw Wood
house and Johnson claw their way back
from 0-40. After five deuces and four Cal
advantages, the Cardinal took the game
behind two big serves by Johnson and set
up the victory.
With their wins, Poruri, Johnson and
Woodhouse automatically qualify for the
Rolex National Indoors, which will be held
in Minneapolis Feb. 6-9.
