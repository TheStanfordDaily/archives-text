# Trial by fire for hoopsters

### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
And you thought the football team had a
tough schedule.
Two years after Stanford's women's basket
ball team blew out almost every one of its oppo
nents on the way to a national championship,
the 1991-92 edition of the Cardinal finds itself
left with only one of the mtyor players in that
title team, and confronted by one of the most rig
orous schedules in the team's history.
After the graduation of Trisha Stevens and
Sonja Henning and the medical release status of
last season's leading scorer Julie Zeilstra, Stan
ford has acquired quite the youthful look. With
Martha Richards concentrating on her golf
game, the Cardinal's roster shows only one
senior, Ann Adkins.
Adkins will have plenty of opportunities to be
a team mentor, as the squad can boast five fresh
men that make up one of the nation's top two
recruiting classes.
This young but talented group will warm
themselves up for the season Saturday against
the Australian All-Stars. But that's about the
only warm competition they'll get this year. The
first official game of the season is at Georgia, a
top-10 team who will be looking for big-time
revenge from a Cardinal squad which upset
them twice last year, including in the NCAA
West Regional finals.
Heck, skip the frying pan; let's pop 'em
straight into the fire!
"It's gon' be hot," said coach Tara Van-
Derveer with a wry smile. "But this team has the
ability and cohesiveness to survive the fire."
And the fire will be hot. The Pacific 10 Con
ference is improving vastly every year, and this
season Stanford will face the top western teams
outside of the conference as well: UNLV, Long
Beach State and Santa Clara. In addition, the
Cardinal will continue its series with defending
national champion Tennessee.
The winner of that contest has
gone on to claim the national
title for the past three years.
VanDerveer extolled the
virtues of a challenging schedule,
pointing out that playing bad
teams can make you fall into bad
habits. "We must outwork [oppo
nents!. About the only team in
the top-10 that we don't play is
Virginia," she said.
Refering to the team's young
talent, VanDerveer said, "In
some respects it's like we're
entering the season with a nice
savings account, just no checking
account. [Facing our schedule] a
lot of other teams might go
bankrupt."
She makes it quite clear that
she has complete confidence in
her squad. When asked about pos
sible contenders for the Pac-10
title this season, she replied, "Us."
VanDerveer knows better
than anyone that if the Cardinal
is to win the Pac-10 and possibly
go to its third straight Final
Four, it will need big contribu
tions from its freshmen. The
only experienced center on the
roster is junior Val Whiting. And
the loss of floor general Henning
creates a huge hole at the point
guard position.
But the freshmen are more
than ready to help out. 6-foot-5
Anita Kaplan can spell Whiting
and even add some height to the
lineup. 6-foot-3 Rachel Hemmer
could also fill in at the center
position, although she will prob
ably play a lot of power forward.
Meanwhile, two freshmen
from the Bay Area are able to
take the point. 5-foot-8 Kate
Paye, led her Menlo School team
to three straight California Divi
sion 5 state titles. 5-foot-9 Tanda
Rucker led Berkeley High to the
California Division 1 state cham
pionship last year.
Then there is Bobbie Kelsey, a
5-foot-ll Georgia native whom
VanDerveer calls "as competitive
as Jennifer Azzi, as big as Katy
Steding and as quick as Sonja
Henning." Unfortunately, Kelsey
— who will most likely play small
forward — is one of two injured
players who may not be able to
compete until January. The
other is junior Angela Taylor.
The one thing that is sure to
remain the same is the Cardi
nal's style of play, which has gar
nered them success on the court
and admiration from the fans.
Said VanDerveer, "We're gonna
run."
