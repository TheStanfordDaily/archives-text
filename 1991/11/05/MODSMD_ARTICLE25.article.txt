# Booters face off against Broncos in NCAAs
## Stanford hosts first round 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
We're No. 2?
Although there is little doubt
in the Cardinal women's soccer
team's mind as to who should be
the top seed in the NCAA's
Western region, Stanford will
have to settle for the second spot
as they will host No. 3 seed
Santa Clara this Sunday.
The top seed in the West will
be Colorado College, who some
how managed to sneak by the
Cardinal in the rankings despite
suffering two losses on the sea
son to Stanford's one.
Stanford will have a golden
opportunity to take revenge on
the Santa Clara team that dealt
it its lone defeat.
"I think we were a lot more
emotionally charged for the first
game, and it worked against us,"
captain Heather Mclntyre said.
"Now, we know that we've got to
just do it, and we'll play a lot bet
ter."
Although Stanford has trailed
10-5 Santa Clara in the national
rankings all season long, the
Broncos have stumbled through
the last part of the season with
three straight losses and, save
the Stanford game, have not
played extremely well all season.
In fact, it took both what
coach Berhane Andeberhan
termed an off-game for the Car
dinal and what one Bronco called
"the best game (Santa Clara) has
played all season" for the Bron
cos to beat Stanford in a close
game.
Stanford will have to face the

Broncos without Julie Foudy,
who is currently playing for the
national team. Luckily for the
Cardinal, Foudy, whom many
consider to be the top women's
soccer player in the nation, is
not even the team's leading scor
er.
That honor goes to sopho
more Sarah Rafanelli, who has
set school records for goals (16)
and points (40) this season.
Rafanelli and the rest of the Car
dinal offense will be counted on
to pick up the slack created by
Foudy's departure.
Fortunately, the Cardinal's
defensive unit remains intact
and powerful as ever. Led by
Mclntyre and goalkeeper Leslie
Garrard, the defense has allowed
only four goals all season long.
The team's defense has
shown dramatic improvement
over last season with the addi
tion of freshmen Kristen Wair
and Melinda Minstrell to the
starting lineup. Fullbacks Kerry
Stivaletti, Laura Wilkes and
Anita Koshy have also been
instrumental in helping the
team register 14 shutouts in
only 17 games.
Garrard has blanked Card
opponents 10 times in the sea
son's final 11 contests to give her
13 on the season, a school record.
Neither she nor the team's three
other keepers, Wendy Kevan,
Chris Massell and Jennifer
Poehler, have allowed a goal
since the last Santa Clara contest
two and a half weeks ago.
In short, the Stanford defense
is hot, red hot, and is looking to

team.
Colorado College will face the
winner of the Card-Bronco con
test, and the team that emerges

from these three will go to the
Final Four.
The other three No. 1 seeds are
20-0 North Carolina, 13-4-1 Vir
ginia (who lost to Stanford 2-0 on
Oct. 14), and 15-2 Wisconsin. The
Cardinal and the Tar Heels are
the only two teams in the tourna
ment with fewer than two losses
on the season.
