At this time last year, the
Stanford men's crew team found
itself challenged by a young team
and a new coach. Consequently,

Cardinal wins
Newport regatta

last fall's racing season was less
than spectacular.
This year, with a strong senior
class and a confident coaching
staff, the varsity crew has placed
first in its last two regattas.
In last weekend's Newport
regatta, the Cardinal won the
5,000-meter race in 15 minutes
38 seconds. California placed sec
ond in 15:52.
The varsity team led from the
gun and never felt pressured, as
it rowed against the clock as
much as the competition. Stan
ford won by 15 seconds.
"The key to Sunday's victory
was a solid rhythm that allowed
us to keep the boat quick and
light throughout the race," said
varsity stroke Mark Berwick.
The win at Newport was

another step in a successful start
to the 1991-92 campaign. In the
season-opener against Cornell,
Stanford was barely edged by the
Big Red.
Over the 3,000-meter course,
the Cardinal posted a time of
9:02. The team was only five sec
onds behind Cornell, a squad that
placed fourth in the national
championship regatta last year.
In the recent Head of the
American regatta, the varsity
crew finished first over the
3,000-meter course, in 17:09.
Last year the Cardinal squad
placed third to UC-Santa Bar
bara. The varsity shell was later
disqualified for missing a buoy.
The junior varsity placed third.
The UC-Davis alumni shell
finished with a time of 18:10.
UC-Santa Barbara clocked
18:17, placing that squad right
behind the Cardinal junior varsi
ty crew.
"I am quite satisfied with the
way the fall racing season is
going. It is encouraging to see
both boats doing well," said var
sity coxswain Quinn Bolton.
"The past is working for us
now," coach Wieslaw Kujda
said, emphasizing the impor
tance of "seeing the smiles in
the boats after they pass the fin
ish lines."
