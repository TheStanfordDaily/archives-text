# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While many athletes suffer sophomore
slumps, the second-year jinx is certainly not
a universal experience. Although it's still
early in the tennis season, Laxmi Poruri
and Michael Flanagan have proven their
sophomore campaigns are anything but dis
appointing. Both made the finals of the
Rolex Northern California qualifying tour
naments, earning them Athlete of the Week
honors.

Poruri steamrolled through the 64-play
er singles draw, losing just one set en route
to the title. On the way, the third seed had
to swim through a sea of Cardinal red as she
faced teammates in the last three matches.
In the quarterfinals, Poruri played
sophomore Emma Woodhouse and won in
straight sets, 6-3, 6-1. No. 2-seed freshman
Kim Shasby was her next competitor. Shas
by — a top recruit and former Missouri Val
ley standout in the junior ranks — pushed
Poruri to three sets 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.
That proved to be Poruri's closest match
as she beat senior Ky lie Johnson in the final
6-2, 6-2. This is the third year in a row
Stanford has produced the tournament
winner. (Teri Whitlinger won it in 1989 and
1990).
By winning, Poruri clinches a spot in the
Rolex National Indoors in February, joining
teammate Heather Willens, who qualified
by finishing second in the All-American
Championships.
While Poruri was slashing through the
singles draw of the women's tourney,
Michael Flanagan forged a path to the dou
bles final in the men's Rolex Regionals.
The seventh-seeded tandem of Flanagan
and Robert Devens upset both the No. 4 and
No. 2 doubles teams. They beat Fresno
State's duo of Jackson and Noel in the semi
finals 6-2, 6-4. That match sets up an all-
Cardinal final. Flanagan and Devens face

top-seeded Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel
today.
Flanagan did not fare as well in singles,
losing to Washington's Chet Crile in the
semifinals. Flanagan, however, has
already proven himself a top singles
threat in collegiate tennis. Several weeks
ago, he reached the semifinals of the Volvo
Championships, one leg of the collegiate
Grand Slam.
