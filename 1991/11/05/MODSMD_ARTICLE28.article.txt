# Card netters see red at Rolex Regionals

After losing two of its top players to the
professional tour this summer, the Stan
ford men's tennis team had some question
marks heading into the 1991-92 season.
Some of the questions were answered yes
terday in the Rolex Northern California
Men's Collegiate Tennis Championships at
Saint Mary's College in Moraga, Calif.
Although Stanford will not be represent
ed in today's singles final, four of the eight
quarterfinalists and two of yesterday's
semifinalists wore cardinal. Today's dou
bles final at 11:30 a.m. will be an all-Stan
ford affair.
Sophomore Michael Flanagan continued
his winning ways until he ran into a heady
backboard named Chet Crile of Washington
in the semifinals. In the quarterfinals,
Flanagan, the No. 1 seed, disposed of Cali
fornia's Tommy Phanco, the No. 5 seed, 7-
5, 6-3. But Crile outrallied Flanagan in the
semifinals, 6-2, 6-3.
Despite the loss, Flanagan seems to be
making a strong argument for his filling
the No. 2 or No. 3 singles spot this year,
behind senior Alex O'Brien, the top-ranked
player in the country. "We have some big
question marks at the No. 2 and No. 3 spot
(in singles)," coach Dick Gould said. "With
his results so far, Michael's making a pret
ty convincing case that he should be in one
of those spots."
Sophomore Robert Devens reached his
second Norcal semifinals in as many years.
In the quarterfinal, Devens, the No. 11
seed, powered his way past teammate
Vimal Patel, the No. 3 seed, 6-4, 6-1. Fres
no State's Greg Anderson, who according
to several observers has been playing the
entire tournament like he's from another
planet, was too much for Devens in the
semifinals. Anderson won the match 6-4, 6-
1.
Gould was not at all disappointed.
"Robert is working points a lot better this
year. He's more patient," Gould said. "His
first serve is more consistent, and he's
more comfortable with the serve and volley.
We're expecting big things from him."
Senior Jason Yee, the No. 2 seed, also
was forced to meet the alien Anderson and

fell 6-1, 6-3 in the quarterfinals. Gould was
pleased with his performance. "Jason had a
good tournament. He's working on a few
things, as are all the guys, and this tourna
ment gave him a chance to put some of
those things into practice. He's only going
to get better," Gould said.
Stanford dominated yesterday's doubles
action. The top-seeded duo of Chris Cocotos
and Patel pounded Knute Lund and Crile of
Washington 6-2, 6-2 in the quarters. After
losing a tight first set, the Stanford team
then reached the finals with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4
win over Fresno State's Koitka and
Sachau.
"Chris and Vimal had a problem holding
serve last year. But their serves have
improved," Gould said. "It's allowing them
to move better at net. Overall, they're feel
ing more comfortable with each other."
Flanagan and Devens beat two tough
teams to reach the finals. In the quarterfi
nals, they edged the fourth-seeded duo of
Coupe and Del Rosario of San Jose State, 3-
6, 6-2, 6-4. In the semis, the Stanford com
bination crushed Jackson and Noel, the No.
2 seed from Fresno State, 6-2, 6-4. Accord
ing to Gould, Flanagan and Devens simply
controlled the match.
The winner of today's final will receive
an automatic bid into the national version
of this tournament, the Rolex Indoors, later
this year. Of more importance to Stanford,
however, is the question of who is going to
fill the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles spots during
the year.
"We're trying to figure out who belongs
in those spots," Gould said. "These four
guys are trying to prove that they do."
