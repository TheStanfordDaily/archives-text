# Students, faculty organize to defend arts
## 
### Connie Lo Julia Sobrevilla 
Trying to block University
budget cuts from possibly elimi
nating their disciplines at
Stanford, students and faculty in
the performing arts, photography
and others have mobilized to tell
administrators why those areas
are important to the University.
They hope to get their mes
sage across through a letter
writing campaign, petitions and
a Thursday, noon rally in White

Plaza.
Students from vulnerable
programs also formed the Ad
Hoc Student Arts Committee, a
grass-roots student group.
Many students in the music
and drama departments, as well
as the photography program of
the art department, are writing
letters and circulating petitions.
Faculty in these programs are
taking action as well.
According to graduate stu
dent Alan Baker, a member of
the ad hoc committee, students

have already gathered an esti
mated 1,500 to 2,000 signatures
and 300 letters.
Students have also organized
a rally, called "Art for Art's
Sake," to garner support for the
areas targeted for cuts by the
School of Humanities and
Sciences.
The event is sponsored by
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
and the ad hoc committee.
Students will be gathering
signatures, as well as videotaping
personalized messages to the deans
and the decision-making task
forces of Humanities and Sciences.
At the same time, groups
including the Stanford Band, a
capella groups, Ballet Folkorico
and the Stanford Savoyards will
perform.
Baker said he hopes the rally
will champion the larger cause of
all the vulnerable areas in the arts
and show the administrators the
public support behind performing
arts.
Many in these departments
expressed fear of budget cuts.
"This is an already lean opera
tion," said music administrator
Melinda McGee. "There's no
excess here that I can see."
Asst. Drama Prof. Maurice
Rehm said drama is the "only aca
demic department in the humani
ties that has been singled out."
The department has three
tenured professors, making it an
"easy target," he said.
"You can buy these people off
and save a lot of money," he
added.
The budget crisis is creating
bonds among the people in the
Drama Department, according to
Claire Kelm, a department spokes
person.

"The department's case had
been made as good as it could be,"
said Lance Miller, a third year
Ph.D. student.
Miller said that the Universi
ty's decision to target the drama
department "bespeaks (the) old
prejudice against the arts, espe
cially theater."
Michael Rosewall, a member of
the ad hoc committee, said too few
departments seemed to be taking
the brunt of the school's cuts.
He said that because those
areas are small, they do not have
someone to speak for them and so
have become easy targets for bud
get cuts.
"When budgets get tight, arts
get the short stick," Rosewall
said.
Stanford is jeopardizing its
ability to provide a well-rounded
liberal arts education, Rosewall
said.
Both he and Baker said they
worried that cutting from per
forming arts will discourage many
student applicants to Stanford.
Another arts program that
faces possible cuts is the photog
raphy program, which consists of
only two faculty, both senior lec
turers. There are no tenured fac
ulty.
Senior lecturer Laura Volker
ding said, "I think that may be
why it has been targeted. . . . We
were vulnerable."
Volkerding has sent out letters
appealing to alumni from the pro

'This is an already
lean operation.
There's no excess
here that I can see.'

gram as well as to museum cura
tors from all over the country to
help save the photography pro
gram.
Music Dept. Chair Karol Berg
er said of budget cuts, "I hate
them. [They] will force us to make
difficult choices."
He said music is central to
what any university should be
about and added that budget cuts
were the most important issue on
the minds of people in his depart
ment.
The music faculty has met and
will continue to meet to discuss
possible scenarios resulting from
cuts and to develop a plan to
counter the possibilities.
The performing activities are
exactly what draw students to the
arts, according to Alan Baker. He
emphasized the value of the prac
tical study and performance
opportunities available to stu
dents.
"Taking performing arts away
is tantamount to taking a physi
cist's lab away," Baker said.
