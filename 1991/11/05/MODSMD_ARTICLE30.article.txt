# Sands through the hourglass
## Lady linksters confounded by difficult dunes 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Disguised as an easy tourna
ment, the UCLA Desert Classic
surprised many teams, including
the Stanford women's golf team,
with its difficulty.
Masked under the sunny, 85-
degree weather of Palm Springs,
the tournament is played on the
extremely challenging Desert
Dunes Golf Course.
The women's team managed to
adjust to the course's difficulty in
Monday's opening round, scoring
a 302, while the men's team, com
peting simultaneously, was one
stroke behind the women, scoring
a 303.
The Cardinal women's team
score was good for fourth place,
one stroke behind third-place
UCLA.
"We had a good contribution
from all areas of the team. ...
Our goal is definitely to beat USC
and UCLA — we even feel we can

catch San Jose State," said coach
Tim Baldwin.
Senior Audrey Wooding shot a
73, putting her in sixth place indi
vidually. Coming off a bad last
day of play in last weekend's
Stanford Intercollegiate, Wooding
bounced back on Monday to golf
at her usual high caliber.
Melinda Daniels pulled her
game together as well, shooting a
74, good for seventh place.
Daniels was mildly disappointed
after last weekend's solid 80-80
performance, but has refocused in
the last week of practice.
After coming in eighth individ
ually last week, freshman Jamille
Jose finished the first day in 18th,
shooting a 76. Jose has shown the
potential to be a great asset for
the Cardinal.
Adele Moore, usually Stan
ford's leading golfer, faltered on
the first day with a 79, leaving her
in 36th place.
Moore's poise under pressure
and three years of experience will

likely enable her to improve in the
next two days of play and put her
back in her normal top-10 position.
In a typical showing of the Car
dinal's depth, Wooding filled
Moore's spot, and keeping Stan
ford in the top four in team stand
ings.
Senior Stephanie Davis, Stan
ford's fifth golfer, shot an 80,
putting her in 39th place.
"If we would've gotten a nor
mal-type performance out of
Adele and Stephanie, both of
whom are perfectly capable of
shooting 74 or 75, we'd have had a
297. But that's just an if," Bald
win said.
San Jose State, ranked second
in the nation, leads the tourna
ment with 294 strokes, followed
by USC with 298.
Stanford beat both USC and
UCLA last week on the Stanford
Golf Course, and definitely has
the potential to surpass the two
Southern California powers in the
next two rounds of golf.
