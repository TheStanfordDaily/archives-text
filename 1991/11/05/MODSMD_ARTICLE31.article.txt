## Puckish players slash foes

While slicing across a slab of
frigid ice may not be an experi
ence many Stanford students
would relish, the Cardinal ice
hockey team is savoring its
recent success.
Stanford is 8-2 on the young
season and has recently beaten
San Jose State, Oregon and Cal
Tech. Contributions from a
variety of players have keyed
the winning streak.
"We've been getting scoring
from a lot of players who may
have been in the background
last year. The scoring has really
balanced the team out," said
sophomore Cory Sammons.
In the 8-0 shutout of Ore

gon, six different Cardinal
skaters tallied goals, with Dave
Shapiro and Sammons notch
ing two scores apiece. Eric
Haug, Brian Gaines, Robert
Holtzapple and Jenko Hwong
added goals.
"That was typical of our sea
son. We scored one goal in the
first period, and within five
minutes of the second period
we scored three goals," Sam
mons said. "Once we'd gone
through our scoring spurt, we
were fine."
The Cardinal scored a similar
win against the Spartans, notch
ing four goals in a five-minute
span in the second period. Sam
mons scored three times and
Hwong twice to lead the team to
an 11-3 victory.

The line of Hwong at left
wing, Sammons at right and
freshman Luke Winters at cen
ter leads the team in scoring.
But Sammons insists the entire
squad gets credit for the strong
start.
"We have four solid lines,
and everybody's doing their
jobs — that's why we're doing
so well," he said.
Stanford competes in the
Pacific Collegiate Hockey Asso
ciation. The squad hosts divi
sion rival California, Friday at
7 p.m. at the Golden Gate Ice
Arena in Redwood City. The
division round-robin playoffs
aren't until March, giving the
team plenty of upcoming head
to-head contests with Pacific
Collegiate opponents UCLA,
USC and Pepperdine.
