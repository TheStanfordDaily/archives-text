# Exiled leader asks for U.S. support

### W. Scott McCormack Editorial staff 
In a soft-spoken but heart-felt speech,
Win Sein, prime minister of the demo
cratically-elected but exiled government
of Burma, called on the United States to
help in the struggle to free the Burmese
people from brutal dictatorship.
"People in this country don't know
what is happening in Burma because
here you have a tradition of democra
cy and human rights. In Burma we
have no human rights," Win said.
Leaders of the Burmese govern
ment-in-exile, based at the Thai-Burma
border, are traveling through the

United States seeking to garner support
for the fledgling struggle to restore
democracy in Burma, now officially
called Myanmar.
Sponsored by the Palo Alto-based
human rights group Humanitas, Win,
along with the exiled Finance Minister
U Win Ko, delivered his plea last night
to a small group of activists in the
home of Law Prof. Kenneth Scott.
"Please help our people; they are suf
fering. They are being arrested arbitrar
ily for any political activity," he said.
Burma has recently been the sub
ject of international attention after
the Nobel Committee awarded the
1991 peace prize to Daw Aung San

Suu Kyi, a Burmese dissident under
house arrest since 1988.
In the wake of elections held in May
1990 in which opposition parties won
82 percent of the vote, the ruling State
Law and Order Restoration Council
(SLORC) as the Burmese ruling gov
ernment is officially titled, discredited
the results and systematically
detained, tortured and killed more
than 70 members of parliament and
thousands of their supporters, accord

eight members of parliament who
managed to flee Burma.
"In terms of human rights,
there is no country in the world
that is worse," said Jane Jerome
of Amnesty International. "Near
ly a half million people have been
forcibly relocated to malaria-rid
den swamps and many have been
forced to work as porters in areas

covered with (land) mines."
Win called on Americans to
pressure businesses not to invest
in Burma and Congress to impose
economic sanctions and an arms
embargo on Burma.
Many U.S. companies, such as
Exxon and Pepsi, are actively doing
business with the Burmese military
junta, according to Leslie McKim of
the Burma Project based in Marin
County. "Business activity is defi
nitely increasing," she said.
Win expressed confidence that
the Burmese military dictatorship

"won't last long." He cited the des
perate economic state of the countiy
and the potential for division within
the army, in addition to pressure
from the international community,
as contributing factors to its eventu
al downfall. "The regime has its
own problems," he said.
"We expect things to change
within two years," said Richard
Myint, head of the Committee for
the Restoration of Democracy in
Burma. "We are doing anything
and everything we can" to bring
that about, he added.
