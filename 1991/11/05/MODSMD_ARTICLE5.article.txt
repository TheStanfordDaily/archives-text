The four representatives on a student committee
charged with evaluating the candidates for vice pres

recommendations of the committee, adding that

Students' Office at the request of the vice-presiden

The students were supposed to spend one hour
interviewing each of the candidates.
"All the candidates were very strong, but that
was just a given," said sophomore Rolanda Gains, a
student committee member. "What is most impor-
