### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
The four representatives on a student committee
charged with evaluating the candidates for vice pres
ident of student resources plan to recommend Mary
Edmonds, the vice president for student affairs at
Bowling Green State University, for the position.
Edmonds is "a strong woman and a strong
administrator," said junior Benny Sandoval, a
member of the student committee and a Council of
Presidents member. "She's been through budget
cuts at Bowling Green and also organized the whole
student resources offices there. She has the right
experience."
Acting Vice President for Student Resources and
former Registrar Sally Mahoney is also a candidate
for the influential position, which oversees
University functions ranging from judicial affairs to
health care.
But Sandoval said the committee chose not to rec
ommend Mahoney, who has 25 years of experience
at Stanford, saying "Stanford needs fresh blood."
Freshman Edna Yahil, who is also on the com
mittee, echoed Sandoval's thoughts about Mahoney.
"The consensus of the group is that she hasn't
been very effective. She's caught up in Stanford
bureaucracy already. What we liked about
Edmonds is that she can deal with the bureaucracy
but not necessarily be a part of it," she said.
Mahoney said she had no comment about the
recommendations of the committee, adding that
she had thought the evaluations would be confiden
tial and that she had only met with two of the stu
dents from the committee.
The student committee will give its evaluations
to the vice president search committee, which is
made up of various administrators and faculty
members and is charied by Provost James Rosse,
who will make the final decision.
The four students were chosen by the Dean of
Students' Office at the request of the vice-presiden
tial search committee, according to Senior Valerie
Mih, the undergraduate on the search committee.
The students were supposed to spend one hour
interviewing each of the candidates.
"All the candidates were very strong, but that
was just a given," said sophomore Rolanda Gains, a
student committee member. "What is most impor-
tant is who would be the best at
Stanford, and the other candi
dates weren't as appropriate."
Edmonds "was the only candi
date that we interviewed who got
us talking amongst ourselves,"
said Sandoval. "It wasn't just a
formal question-and-answer
interview. She listened to our con
cerns and was approachable and
personable."

David Miyahara, the graduate
student representative on the
vice-presidential search commit
tee, said that the student commit
tee's evaluations will be influence
their recommendation to Rosse.
"However, Rosse will be the one
making the bottom-line, final
decision," he said.
Rosse said that the recommen
dations of the committees would
have "some influence" on his
decision. "I'm sure I'll hear a fair
amount from them," he said.
"Hopefully, I'll make the decision
within a week."
