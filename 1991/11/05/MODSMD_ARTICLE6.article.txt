# Reagan library dedicated, recalling Stanford dispute

Four years after withdrawing from its
proposed site at Stanford under pressure
from faculty, the Ronald Reagan Pres
idential Library found a friendlier environ
ment in the hills of Southern California.
In the company of five other presidents
and such Hollywood celebrities as Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Reagan reigned yester
day at the official dedication of his library,
according to the Associated Press.
Situated on a 153,000 square-foot plot of
land northwest of L.A., the four-story
library possesses over 6 million pages of
White House documents, as well as two
movie theaters, a gift shop and Reagan's
future tomb, the Associated Press said.
The library was originally slated to be
built in the foothills overlooking Stanford.
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation
withdrew its proposal on April 23,1987.
Foundation members W. Glenn Camp
bell, former director of the Hoover
Institution, and Martin Anderson, a senior

fellow at Hoover, were attending the dedi
cation ceremony today and were unavail
able for comment.
Campbell had been a driving force for
the project, saying the library would give
Stanford reason to "boast" of a "Reagan
connection."
Concerns of faculty and students
opposed to the proposed site ranged from
political to intellectual to environmental.
The original proposal was "a total disas
ter," an "ill-conceived plan," said Samuel
Brain, a research associate at the Stanford
Medical Center who had been involved in
the drive to block the library.
"Reagan was not seen as an intellectual
in any way," said Brain, who further said
that a Reagan Library would have
"detracted from the intellectual reputa
tion of the University."
In addition, he said, there was a great
deal of concern over the environmental
impact on "the last piece of open space on
campus." "[l] would have hated to
see the beauty of the Dish
destroyed."
Some Stanford faculty had a
mixed outlook on the affair. Eco
nomics Professor and Nobel Laure
ate Kenneth Arrow said, "A presi
dent is part of history." The value
of research materials related to a
president "has nothing to do with a
moral judgement," he added.
Ultimately, Arrow suggested,
the main problem with the propos

al had been the difficulty of pur
chasing enough land to also include
a conservative "policy center."
Foundation members wanted
to build a conservative think-tank
near the library, but could not
find enough non-University land
to build it on.
Arrow said concerns over
noise, crowding and other forms
of environmental impact had
played a major role in faculty
opposition. "I was struck by the
number of conservative faculty
living nearby the Foothills who
were opposed to it,"he said,
adding that "property price was
the major concern."
