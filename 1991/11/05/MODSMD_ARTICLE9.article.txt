# Talley breaks through dating dilemmas
## 
### Alain Dalva 
Dating, flirting and seduction
are Jerry Talley's favorite sub
jects.
Describing his perception of the
dating situation at Stanford, Talley
— a licensed therapist and faculty
member in the sociology depart
ment until 1985 — said, "Some
students often plan relationships
like extracurricular activities,
changing them every quarter."
Facing a substantial workload
and an "academic calendar that is
not forgiving," people often do not
find time to explore relationships,
he said.
Talley has regularly been lec
turing Human Biology Program
courses and participating in six to
10 dormitory talks every quarter,
so he has been able to discuss
Stanford's infamous dating dearth
with students all around campus.
He said many students often
want to postpone serious long
term relationships until quieter
times after college.
However, he said, "If people
want to be in relationships, if they
feel ready to do that at this time in
their lives. .. they should learn to
do it in the midst of complex and
demanding schedules, because
that's how they're going to be
doing it for the rest of their lives."
During Talley's lectures, most
students acknowledging their
desire to date also complain about
the lack of romantic opportunities
on campus and the apparent
shortage of people feeling the
same way. For Talley, however,
"this is not a crisis in opportunity
or resources, this is a crisis in pro
cedure or will."
Typical gender roles often cre
ate ambiguous situations when it
comes to dating and flirting, he
said, adding that men have been
educated to be aggressive while
women have been taught to be
sexually submissive.
Strange beliefs consequently
spring from the sexist biases people

have nurtured since childhood. Tal
ley said he has found that "there is
an interesting belief among some
young males that somehow women
are kind of asexual, and [that men]
have to do something extraordinary
(such as get women drunk) to make
things happen."
Sexist beliefs may also mislead

women in the course of dating. On
one hand, women often tend to
assume that "the male's only inter
est is sexual," forgetting that he
also has complex needs that he may
hide because of social pressure.
On the other hand, while
women may see men as "forceful
and powerful," they will be afraid

to hurt their feelings. Talley said,
There is no reason why any
woman should give up her com
fort or her values or her interests
to avoid bruising his supposedly
fragile ego."
During a lecture to a psycholo
gy class spring quarter, Talley
outlined four points of flirting eti
quette that are intended to spare
sour misunderstandings in both
developing and mature relation
ships. "Good" flirting:
• invites without being demand
ing;
• progresses through a series of
invitations, reactions, counter offers,
more reactions and so on;
• leaves the other person feel
ing comfortable and compliment
ed; and
• stops when ambiguities need
to be clarified.
To make relationships last,
Talley emphasized the diversity of
active experiences a couple must
share, from having serious talks
to having fun. "It's not enough to
just be together. . . . You need to
stop and ask yourself periodically:
What is it that we haven't had
time to do? And go do that."
On picking the ideal partner, Tal
ley said he doesn't think "it's espe
cially relevant how somebody looks.
"It doesn't follow that because
they dress great and look good
that they're also wonderful
lovers. A good sense of humor and
knowing how to hug would be
more valuable in bed than looking
good in a short skirt."
Talley stressed that "part of
the dilemma" in dating is defini
tional. People indeed overempha
size candle-lit occasions as the
essence of dating, while forgetting
the simple moments of everyday
life that actually forge a solid rela
tionship, he said.
"In reality, relationships are
built more on those afternoon
talks and studying together and
running around the lake than
they are on those special romantic
evenings."
