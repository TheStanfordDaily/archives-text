# ASSU hints support of amendment

The ASSU Senate last night rejected a bill
that would have opposed a University com
mittee proposal to reduce the standard of
proof required in student misconduct cases.
After a three-hour debate, the senate voted
7-13 against a measure that supported the
current "beyond reasonable doubt" standard.
The bill was written in response to a Commit
tee of 15 recommendation that the standard
be reduced to "clear and convincing evidence."
The committee is a group of faculty and
students that proposes amendments to Stan
ford's Judicial Charter. The senate has not yet
voted on the committee's proposal.
Speaking in the open forum portion of the
meeting, committee chair Deborah Rhode,
author of the proposal to change the stan
dards, said the proposal came in response to
statistics that showed only one-third of sexual
assault cases at Stanford were reported.
Rhode said the committee found that "some
problems stem from the unreasonably high
burden of proof' required by the Legislative
and Judicial Charter. "On balance, we thought
we would be best served by changing the bur
den of proof," she said.
Rhode said that according to a survey of
judges, the amount of certainty of guilt need
ed for a conviction is "about 90 to 100 percent
certainty for beyond a reasonable doubt ana
in the 70 to 90 percent range for
clear and convincing evidence."
Some senators said they found
the plethora of percentages and
statistics irrelevant. Council of
Presidents member John Overdeck
said, "Numbers are fine, but what
does it really mean — a 10 to 35
percent standard. All I've found in
these proposals tonight is a lot of
bizarre statistical impotence."
However, Overdeck, who co
authored the rejected senate bill,
said the senate ought to overturn
the standard-changing proposal.
"I take it for granted that the
ASSU will not pass the proposed
changes to the standard of proof,
because it is unconstitutional."
Currently, the ASSU constitu
tion contains the reasonable
doubt standard. No amendments
to the constitution can be made
until the spring elections.
Overdeck said he saw no reason
to change standards because "the
standard of clear and convincing is
not an objective standard." In
addition, Overdeck said he feared
the change would lead to innocent
students being found guilty.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg dis
agreed. "I think the chance of an
erroneous conviction under this
new standard would rise from

zero to something imperceptibly
above zero," he said.
Weisberg said the contention
that a clear and convincing evi
dence standard is subjective while
a reasonable doubt standard is
objective is "at best meaningless,
but more likely categorically
false."
"Somebody can be sentenced to
death in the U.S., under a beyond a
reasonable doubt standard, on only
circumstantial evidence," he said.
The Senate spent two hours
debating a confusing amendment
proposed by undergraduate sena
tor Jason Snyder that deleted
portions of the bill and
would have changed the standard
to clear and convincing evidence
in cases of sexual assault only.
For all other student misconduct
violations, the standard would
remain as beyond a reasonable
doubt. The Snyder Amendment
failed by a 7-11-2 vote.
The amendment spurred much
debate, particularly over the issue
of student input on the changes.
"We definitely need to send this
back to committee," said under
graduate senator Pamay Bassey.

"The problem is not with the
recommendation but rather with
the lack of student input. We need
to get students to read the pro
posal with, perhaps, polls or an
open forum along with it."
Rhode said she thought having
two standards for different types
of cases was a bad idea. "From
looking at lots and lots of student
disciplinary codes, none of them
opt for differential standards,"
she said. "Students charged with
[sexual assault] crimes deserve no
less than anybody else."
Undergraduate Senator Sylvia
Ferroni said the Snyder Amend
ment would not solve the prob
lem. "This whole amendment
seems to be getting rid of the
symptoms but not curing the dis
ease, the disease being rape and
sexual assault," she said. "We
need to figure out where we draw
the line. What can we say, 'OK,
now it's rape'?"
In addition, Rhode said, asking
the Committee on 15 to go back to
the drawing board would be frus
trating. "The thought of sending
this back to the Committee of 15
fills me with fear and loathing."
