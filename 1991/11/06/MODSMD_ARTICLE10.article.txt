# Thornburgh falls to underdog Wofford
## Call for national health care sways voters 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -
Appointed Sen. Harris Wofford
won a dramatic come-from
behind victory yesterday over for
mer Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to become the first
Pennsylvania Democrat elected to
the U.S. Senate since 1962.
With 67 percent of the 9,428
precincts reporting, Wofford led
with 1,175,361, or 58 percent, to
Thornburgh's 853,757 votes, or
42 percent.
A number of GOP areas still
had not reported. But Wofford,
who once trailed by as much as 40
points in pre-election polls, guar
anteed his victory by running sur
prisingly well in traditionally
Republican areas.
"I think I was just lucky to be
the messenger of a message that
was there," Wofford said in a tele
phone interview from his hotel
room.
"People want action from
Washington to help working fam
ilies. This was time for action. I
want to go down as an agent of
action and change."
Gov. Robert P. Casey, who

appointed Wofford interim sena
tor earlier this year, said
Wofford's performance was "a
victory for his message.
"We need national health care
in this country, tax breaks for
middle-income people of this
country that have been victimized
by 10 years of Reagan-Bush."
The contest pitted a former
Bush administration cabinet mem
ber, the Republican Thornburgh,
against the lesser known Wofford.
Thornburgh, governor from
1979 to 1987, cast his ballot in
Pittsburgh. Wofford, interim sen
ator since May, voted near his
home in Bryn Mawr, a
Philadelphia suburb.
Wofford had been given little
chance at the outset. But his
campaign climbed steadily in
public opinion polls as he coupled
a call for national health care
with an appeal to middle class
voters.
As winner of the special elec
tion, he will serve the remaining
three years of the term of
Republican John Heinz, who died
in an April plane crash.
