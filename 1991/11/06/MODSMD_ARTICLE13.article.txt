## Democratic malaise 
### 
The Democrats seem to
be sowing the seeds of
a presidential defeat

IT IS TIME FOR THE Demo
crats to become politicians like
the Republicans.
The nation has been sliding
dangerously toward a one-party
system — at the expense of quality
debate and innovative solutions
that come from it.
If the Democrats care about the
United States as much as they do
their own political aspirations,
they need to mount an effective
opposition and present a viable
alternative for voters. They need
to take a stand against the weak
aspects of the current administra
tion.
Despite continued economic
malaise, for example, President
Bush remains one the country's
most popular presidents in history.
But that does not mean the
Democrats should continue to hide
in the shadow of Bush's popularity
or in their overstuffed chairs on
Capitol Hill.
Rather, they need to seize the
offensive from the Republicans
and exploit Republican weakness
es in order to show their agenda,
whatever that may be.
It is critical for the integrity and
maintenance of democracy that a
country have at least two distinct
political parties that do not avoid
taking a stand.
We certainly don't need to go
as far as Poland, whose 40-odd
parties represent even the
National Beer Drinkers. But
most democracies in the world
consist of parliamentary systems
that struggle constantly for dis
tinct identity and produce more
representative, proactive leader
ship.
Aside from a brief flirtation
with a three-party system in the
1800s, the United States has
firmly clung to the two-parties

model. And because of this it is
essential that the Democrats not
shirk away from their responsibil
ities as the opposition to the sta
tus quo.
They are months behind where
they were four years ago. No one
wants to challenge a seemingly
invincible Bush. Jesse Jackson, a
constant and powerful force in the
last two races, has decided to stay
out and provide political commen
tary for television instead. New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo is mired in
indecision.
Whatever happened to A 1 Gore?
Or Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley?
While politicians like these are
sitting on the sidelines, the Repub
lican's campaign war chest is
growing.
This adds insult to the injury of
the holier-than-thou tone among
Democrats in recent national cam
paigns.
During the 1988 presidential
campaign, for instance, Michael
Dukakis' campaign adviser
blocked several television ads of
the Willy Horton ilk. Democrats
would not stoop so low, she
argued.
Dukakis also took the honest
road on the question of whether
the country needed new taxes
while Bush gave speeches saying
new taxes would not be needed,
which, of course, they were. The
Democrats must hold Bush
accountable for this.
Bush used citizens' fears of vio
lent crime and financial insecurity
to carry him through his election
three years ago. And he is certain
to do it again.
The Democrats must drop the
foolish notion that a national
election is the mechanism to
change the country. One four
year term can have more impact
on American quality of life than a
respectfully-run campaign ever
could.
The Democrats need to reassert
their party's ambitions for the
presidency and set forth an inno
vative agenda. Our nation's demo
cratic tradition demands it.
