## The 						story of a Chinaman

I am here today because my country is
weak and my family is poor.

ON THE WALL NEXT TO the loan
desk of the physics library, there is
a picture of a stern-looking China
man. His name was Chung-kuei Chang.
He was officially the night watchman of
the Varian Physics building.
Chang was born to a poor farming
family in northern China in 1895. From
the start, Chang was quite fond of school
and earned great marks that ensured him
a spot at Beijing University. At Beijing,
Chang excelled again and presumably
obtained every academic honor that the
university had to offer.
In 1937, Chang came here on a China
Foundation research scholarship, leaving
behind a wife and four children. While he
kept in close touch with them through
letters, he would never again have the
opportunity to see them.
At Stanford, he first studied electrical
engineering, then in 1941 he switched to
physics. Chang never completed his
Ph.D. He once said he wasn't interested
in studying for the mere sake of a degree.
Nevertheless, he was offered academic
positions at Stanford numerous times.
He turned them all down. What he did for
the next 30 years besides reading jour
nals remains a mystery.

Chang lived at the Chinese Club on
campus until 1971 when it was torn
down to make room for the Law School.
Making sure he had a place to stay, the
University made Chang the night watch
man of the Varian building.
Chang occupied three rooms in Vari
an. He slept in a tiny room that was just
big enough for a bunk bed. A converted
darkroom served as his kitchen, where he
also kept stacks of journals and reprints.
Chang was a true scholar. He never
stopped learning, even while preparing
his food.
Chang was very interested in theoreti
cal physics. He would often stop a profes
sor in the hallway to talk about the latest
article he had read. Many times he would
say, "Those articles are just crazy, just
crazy."
It was rumored that Chang had his
own theory of physics. But he apparently
felt it wasn't worthy to be written down,
so no one really knew what it was.
Looking at his picture in the physics
library with those severe eyes, those
slightly obtruding lips and small old-fash
ioned glasses, I cannot help feeling a
sense of closeness to him. How Chinese of
him to make the supreme sacrifice of
leaving his family behind in search of
knowledge. How Chinese of him to retain
his frugal ways in a foreign country.
One day after working late, baffled
and tired, I headed back to my dormitory.

As I was walking somehow I thought
about Chang. It was a cloudy night, but I
could clearly see him. Like a fleeting
shadow, Chang flew over me, clutching
his ornamental teapot.
"Oh, the ghost of Chang, are you
there? Three generations later I have fol
lowed your footsteps to America."
I followed into the building. "How have
you spent all those years? Have you ever
dreamed of seeing your village again —
those oxen pulling the plough, those
farmers gathered under a tree shadow,
talking and smoking pipes, and those boys
and girls holding your legs and riding on
your feet? Have you ever anticipated the
day that you are home again, when you
can rub the black soil in your hands, let
ting the moist sink into your skin?"
I could hear no response, just flashes
of images. Chang was born in the country
of northern China. He grew up during
the tumultuous years of war and conflict
and acquired his knowledge at Stanford,
a temple of Western learning. Perma
nently fixed in a temporary situation, he
died at the age of 87.
