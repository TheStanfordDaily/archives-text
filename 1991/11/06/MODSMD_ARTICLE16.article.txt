The arts provide crucial educational balance for all

AS A JUNIOR MAJORING IN
urban studies and art history and
a member of the Ram's Head
board of directors, I am writing because
the University budget cuts being consid
ered threaten me.
My main concern is the proposal to
cut drastically, if not eliminate, the aca
demic departments in the performing
arts. While I am not a drama, music-per
formance or studio-art major, I and
countless other non-majors would have a
completely different Stanford experience
if such changes occur.
I came to Stanford because I would be
able to continue my involvement in the
ater and I would be able to continue
studying piano. I know I am not the only
student here who chose Stanford

because she could continue to pursue
her interest in the arts without mqjoring
in those departments.
The arts are being targeted because
they are supposedly not "central to the
mission of the University." This is
ridiculous. One of Stanford's main goals
is to be both a truly multicultural and
world university. Without the arts, these
goals are unattainable. Music, art and
drama are central to culture.
The various art departments are the
most international on campus. With the
Symphony Orchestra performing in
Eastern Europe and the Drama Depart
ment producing Chekhov, it is hard to
explain how the Drama and Music
Departments are not part of the Univer
sity's "mission."

Students will be affected in many ways
if performing arts are heavily cut. Elimi
nation of the Drama Department effec
tively eliminates Ram's Head, an organi
zation integral to student life and dedicat
ed to involving anyone who is interested
regardless of previous experience.
Elimination of the Drama Department
also effectively eliminates Asian Ameri
can Theater Project, Black Performing
Arts and student improvisation groups.
All these groups, while not a part of the
the department, depend on drama for
guidance and advice during production.
Elimination of music performance
effectively eliminates all student music
groups: the Symphony Orchestra, Cham
ber Orchestra, University Singers,
Chamber Chorale and a cappella groups,

to name a few.
Elimination of studio art will affect
student publications that showcase stu
dent art and photography and will affect
majors such as mechanical engineering,
urban studies and civil engineering, not
to mention art history. Cutting the aca
demic departments in the performing
arts will not have localized consequences;
it will affect the quality of student life.
Stanford is supposedly making cuts to
lead it into its next 100 years. However,
eliminating the performing arts at Stan
ford eliminates part of history. Not
everyone wants to study the history of
art, music or drama; there are many stu
dents who want to make it.
