# Printing victim's name without consent makes rape stigma even worse
## 
### 
The"From the Editor" column in the
Nov. 1 Daily states unequivocally that
"newspapers should print the names of
adult rape victims." The editor also
laments that rapes are underreported.
She fails to see that this would be
exacerbated if news organizations such
as The Daily printed rape survivor's
names without their consent. She does
not acknowledge the personal pain sur
vivors who choose to report may experi
ence when their names are revealed.
Rapes are grossly underreported in
this country; the FBI estimates only one
in 10 is reported to law enforcement offi
cials, and this may be conservative. Many
survivors hesitate to report because of
the shame and guilt they feel about an
assault. The knowledge that their names
will appear in the local newspaper the
next morning only deters them further.
I agree with the editor that rape sur

vivors are unfairly blamed and stigma
tized more than other crime victims, and
that this must change. I also agree that
keeping rape survivors' names out of the
newspaper intensifies and reinforces the
stigma that they bear.
However, I do not agree that the solu
tion is to print their names without their
consent. While in theory this may help
solve a societal problem, it does so at great
expense to individuals who have already
been sufficiently traumatized. We need to
work to change society's perceptions of
rape survivors in other ways before news
papers can freely print survivors' names.
One way we can do this is to encour
age survivors to be brave, to speak out.
If even a few survivors do this, it will
help increase public awareness of the
problem. We do not have to know every
survivor's name to understand what
rape means. Choosing to admit publicly
one has been raped means making one
self vulnerable to blame, scorn and
shame. Survivors should not have this
choice made for them.
