# Students violated University's trust in search process
## 
### 
I cannot recall having read a story in
The Daily with greater dismay than the
one under yesterday's headline: "Mahoney
not VP choice of student panel."
Let me begin by clarifying some back
ground facts about the search for this
position. The search committee is chaired
by Provost James Rosse, to whom the
Vice President for Student Resources
reports. It has two student members.
As the committee went about its work
it sought wider student involvement, and
— through the Dean of Students office
— assembled a group of four students
who were asked to interview each candi
date and then communicate their views
to the committee. (In fact, not all candi
dates were interviewed by each student.)
It has been well understood by all
other students who have served on
search committees that strict rules of
confidentiality must prevail. In this case

that requirement should have been espe
cially obvious, since one of the candi
dates was a well-respected colleague
inside Stanford.
Premature revelations such as these,
before there has even been an opportu
nity for action by the committee, are
damaging in several ways.
First, they may prove embarrassing to
outside candidates who have made the
usual assumptions about confidentiality.
Second, they may raise (or lower) expecta
tions about the outcome before the deci
sion-makers have had a chance to decide.
And third, they may hurt staff morale. In
this last respect the comments about Sally
Mahoney were damaging, although less so
than if they had not also been silly.
The search process for this position has
been severely compromised by this failure.
There will also be a longer-range effect:
Stanford, which has been notably open
about student participation in such deci
sions, is likely to become much more cau
tious about it in the future. That would be
a shame, because it has served us well.
