# Office loses 5 Macs to thief
## 
### Annie Decker 
Five Macintosh computers valued at about
$12,000 were snatched this week from the Planning
Department at 855 Serra.
Although the computers — two Mac lis and three Mac
LCs — were probably stolen Saturday night, they were
not discovered missing until early Monday morning.
No arrests have been made in connection with
the crime.
According to Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer, the theft could have been prevented
since "a number of devices to aid people in securing
their computers are now available."
Earlier this fall the police department urged 855
Serra and other buildings on campus to use protec
tive devices to protect valuable equipment. "We
don't know why they didn't," Niemeyer said.
The Special Services Unit, a division of the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety, periodically pub
lishes an updated pamphlet on security options for
office equipment, according to Dan Smith, manager
of the unit.
Some suggested devices include plate-based secu
rity devices that bolt the computer to a desk, intru-
sion alarms and fiberoptic cable
alarms, and engraving equipment.
The best protection, accord
ing to Smith, is a combination of
the adhesive mat-plate locking
system and one of the alarm sys
tems.
Despite the incident over the
weekend, computer theft this
year is "dramatically off what is
has been," Niemeyer said. In the
years past, "we were consistently
losing 40-50 computers a year,
which translates into $200,000 to
$250,000 in costs."
He attributed a substantial
degree of the recent drop-off in
computer thefts to the arrest and
jailing a few years ago of a man
who was running an internation
al computer-theft ring.
Smith said the theft raised to
16 the number of stolen comput
ers this year, which have a total
value of $53,000.
The Special Service Unit rec
ommends that departments reg
ister with their office. If a regis
tered computer insured by the
Stanford Department of Risk
Management is stolen, the insur
ance company does not charge
the standard $1000 deductible.
The planning department will
have to pay this amount.
