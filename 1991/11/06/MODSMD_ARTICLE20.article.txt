exactly does "all nat

giues these zero-calo
rie drinks their fla
vor?
A. Regarding the
• natural flavor
ing in these drinks,
federal law provides a
very clear-cut defini
tion: For a flavor to

be natural it must originate as a plant or ani
mal, not as a chemical synthesized in a lab.
For example, the same components that give
real lemons their flavor impart the "twist of
lemon" flavor common in these drinks. These
lemon oils are found in sacs scattered irregularly
just below the colored portion of the peel. Begin
ning with 1,000 pounds of lemon peel, flavor
chemists purify a pound of highly concentrated
lemon flavor. The flavor doesn't add any calories
because there is so little of it in each drink.
Some flavors, such as strawberry, are more
difficult to purify from natural sources. This is
why many strawberry yummies are artificially
flavored. Artificial strawberry flavor is a cock
tail of 49 different chemicals, some of which are
not found in the natural world.
Flavoring technology gives us many unique
tastes. Each can of Coca-Cola gets its special
taste from a couple of drops of coca leaf extract.
Coca leaves are about 1 percent cocaine, so the
flavor must be de-cocainized during preparation!
Alas, the flavoring may be the only authentic
part of your "all-natural mineral water." Many
sparkling waters are* nothing more than tap
water with carbonation or minerals added. Per
rier claims to pump naturally carbonated min
eral water, but even Perrier removes the less
healthy minerals before bottling.
. Another word of wisdom: Don't confuse
sparkling water with "sparkling water drinks."
These latter sodas disguised as mineral water
have added sugar to make them taste better
than their zero-calorie counterparts. You won't
find the calorie content on the label, but each
has about 100 calories.
Eiyoy your mineral water. Heed the warning
on the bottle. It would be a shame to see
promising college careers ruined by a forcefully
ejecting cap or an exploding bottle.
