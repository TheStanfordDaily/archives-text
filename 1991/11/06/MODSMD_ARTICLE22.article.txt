## Let's go bowling! UCLA game â€” spare or gutter ball? 
### 
While other Stanford
students may be spend
ing this week relaxing
after midterms, the Cardinal
football players are experienc
ing the tensest week of their
careers. Saturday's game against
UCLA, you see, is the biggest
game that Stanford has had in at
least five years, because it repre
sents a tremendous opportunity
for the program.

A win on Saturday would
likely propel the Cardinal to a
bowl game, where it has not
been since 1986. And like it or
not, Denny Green and his play
ers realize that in order to get
national respect for Stanford
football, bowl bids are a must.
How appropriate it is that
standing between the Cardinal
and its goal for the year is
UCLA, a team that Stanford
wants to resemble: a clean,
highly respected and nationally
recognized program that until
recently has made a habit of
playing in the postseason.
Although they have not been
bowling in the last two seasons,
the Bruins made postseason
appearances for eight straight
years (1981-88), winning an
incredible seven in a row.
Terry Donahue and his team
have reloaded and will give the
Cardinal all that it can handle . .
. and possibly more. Quarter
back Tommy Maddox has a can
non on his shoulder and his
favorite target, Sean LaChapelle,
could catch a nuclear missile in
flight. In addition, running back
Kevin Williams is finally show
ing signs of becoming the devas
tating ground gainer that every
one thought he would be.
UCLA's defensive front seven
has been stuffing the run all
year, and speedy Carlton Gray
leads the secondary.
Saturday's game will no
doubt be a hard-fought, close
contest decided in the fourth
quarter, just as the last two
have been. Two years ago the
Cardinal pulled out a 17-14 win
on the Farm, and last year

UCLA scored the decisive points
in their 32-31 victory on a two
point conversion after Stanford
blocked an extra point.
Close games are often deter
mined by which team wants it
more, and the Cardinal has
much more at stake in this
year's contest. The Bruins, who
are currently 6-2, will probably
make a bowl even if they lose on
Saturday, partially because
they are who they are. A loss for
5-3 Stanford, on the other
hand, would be devastating to
the team's bowl hopes.
The best the Cardinal can
hope for if it loses on Saturday
would be a conditional bid,
probably from the Freedom
Bowl. The catch is that the bid
would require beating first
Washington State and then the
No. 7-ranked California Golden
Bears, who are not only
extremely good, but also are
thirsting for revenge of last
year's last-second loss.
The question needs to be
asked: so what if Stanford
doesn't go to a bowl? Indeed, at
times I wonder if the Cardinal
really wants to start down the
path toward becoming a big
time football program. Are the
possible risks of decreased
scholarship, steroid use and
recruiting scandals worth tak
ing? Can Stanford, with its
lofty academic standards, com
pete year in and year out for
recruits with the powers of col
lege football?
Both Denny Green and new
athletic director Ted Leland
seem to think so, and they
would be in a position to know.
One of Leland's main objectives
for the Athletics Department is
a rededication to Stanford foot
ball, which he refers to as "the
engine that drives the train." In
Leland's view, a successful foot
ball team can garner revenues
that will virtually support all
the other Cardinal teams, and
thus Stanford should strive to
be a force in college football.
Saturday's game is the best
chance that the Cardinal has
had in five years to do just that.
Green, Leland and the team
want to take full advantage of
this tremendous opportunity.

Noah Blake is really, really bad
at frisbee golf but at least he
didn't lose his disc in some
shrubbery like his incredibly tal
ented roommate, Sean May, did.
