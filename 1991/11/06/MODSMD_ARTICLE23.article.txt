# No Mr. Nice Guy, Mann does the job

Randy Mann was born to be a
soccer player, and not in the
American sense of the word.
"Randy can knock with anyone,"
said Stanford assistant coach
Greg Petersen. "He has an inter

national player's mentality."
Indeed, Mann's background
could come straight off of an Ital
ian sports page. Soccer was
always his true love.
"I had a goal in my backyard,
and me and my friends would play
soccer for three or fours hours at
a time," the junior midfielder

said. "I'm from Southern Califor
nia, and it would just be a sauna
out there, but we'd keep playing
until we killed ourselves."
Mann also played baseball
until high school, when ". .. it got
a little boring just standing
around out there all of the time."
Aside from a stint as a football

placekicker his senior season,
Mann devoted himself to school
and area, and state soccer teams
in his high school years. His con
centration on soccer soon paid off
— in his four years at Riverside
High, Mann was named an Ail-
American and participated on the
United States Under-20 National
Team.
Why would a star like Mann
choose a school such as Stanford
over colleges with higher rated
soccer programs? "I knew Rhett
[Harty, Stanford midfielder], and
he was going here, too. It pretty
much came down to academics for
me, though."
For Mann and the rest of the
soccer class of 1993, life on The
Farm was not immediately the
paradise that it was cracked up to
be. An inexperienced Cardinal
squad struggled to an 8-11-2
record in 1989. "I had a good
time, but as a team, we went
through a lot of hard times,"
Mann said. "The good thing was
that a lot of the freshmen on that
team became real good friends."
A good thing it certainly was.
Two years later, the Stanford soc
cer program has risen to the point
that, with an 11-3-5 record and a
No. 25 national ranking, and is
earning serious consideration for
an NCAA Tournament berth.
Those former freshmen, now
juniors, include Mann, goalie
Kyle Krpata, Lance Killian Jason
Vanacour, — a solid team in
itself.
This year has been Mann's
most impressive at Stanford yet.
After spending last season play
ing sweeper for the Cardinal,
Mann is now starting at a mid
fielder position.
And while his numbers (two
goals, four assists), are solid, his
play has been simply outstanding.
"Randy Mann is one of the better
college players," coach Colin Lin
dores said. "He 'has an excellent
tactical understanding of the
game, and he is a well-disciplined
player."
Petersen agreed. "Not only is
Randy one of the best in the coun
try, but he has street smarts,
too."
Street smarts — the term
sounds rough and almost shady.
What exactly does it mean?
Petersen continued. "He's one
of our team's true personalities —

Junior midfielder Randy Mann has tallied his fair share of yellow and red cards over the years, yet he
is one of the Cardinal squad's finest. Along with helping the team capture an NCAA tournament bid, he
is trying to secure a spot on the Olympic team.
