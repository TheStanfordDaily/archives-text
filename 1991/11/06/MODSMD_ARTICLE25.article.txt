# Hoops debut tonight, Keefe still injured

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
It's tough to build a pyramid
when the foundation collapses
right at the start.
Preseason Ail-American Adam
Keefe — the indomitable building
block for the Stanford men's bas
ketball team — missed the first
two weeks of practice because of,
and is still hampered with, a
bruised calf.
So, the enormous construction
job coach Mike Montgomery must
direct — building a winner with
only one returning starter and a
horde of eager youngsters — has
gotten off to a precariously slow
start.
"It's significant," Montgomery
said. "Everything we do in prac
tice is just not as good without
Adam. He raises the intensity
level, he plays so hard. We're
behind, but we'll catch up."
Keefe was kicked in the calf by
teammate Jason Weaver in a
pick-up game Oct. 11, just four
days before the start of practice.
Either Weaver was wearing steel
toed shoes or the new Nikes come
with spurs, because Keefe's
bruise just won't go away. Keefe
returned to practice Saturday on
a limited basis, and Monday was
his first full day back on the job.
"He's a little frustrated with
the progress," Montgomery said.
"When he gets fatigued, it cramps
up, and it just hasn't gone away.
Fortunately, it is one of those
injuries that when it goes away

won't recur or affect him."
With Keefe watching practice,
Weaver and junior Paul Garrett
have filled his spot inside. But
without Stanford's biggest
weapon in the lineup, it is hard to
simulate the real game strategy of
pounding the ball inside to Keefe
for a dunk.
When Keefe does return to full
strength and conditioning, he will
once again be the sturdy founda
tion of an inexperienced team.
"If you don't focus on Adam,
he's going to kill you," Mont
gomery said. "But at the same
time, if you drop an extra man on
him, that will make the rest of the
team better."
The 6-foot-9 Keefe will start
this season at power forward, a
position he played his freshman
and sophomore seasons, allowing
skinny 6-11 sophomore Jim Mor
gan to play center.
Weaver and Garrett will come
off the bench, while 6-6 sopho
more Brent Williams (4.1 points
per game last year) will start at
small forward.
In the back court, junior Mar
cus Lollie will start at point
guard, with juniors Peter Dukes
and Kenny Hicks at the off-guard
position. At 6-4, Hicks may also
replace Williams in a quicker
three-guard alignment.
Freshman guard David Har
bour and 6-7 guard-forward Andy
Poppink have impressed Mont
gomery with their aggressive
play, and should get a chance to
contribute off the bench.


Al Green — Daily file
Mike Morris and the rest of the Cardinal will suit up tonight for an exhi
bition match against High Five America. The team will have to do with
out much help from Adam Keefe, who has an injured calf muscle.
