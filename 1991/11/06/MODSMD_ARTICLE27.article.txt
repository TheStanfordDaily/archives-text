# Stanford clinches win over Stanford
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
In today's world of graphite
rackets and 120-mile-per-hour
serves, many argue that much
of the beauty of tennis has been
lost. Today's conventional wis
dom consists of power, not
strategy — brawn over brains
— or so it would seem.
Robert Devens and Michael
Flanagan put a kink in that con
ventional wisdom yesterday,
coming back from a disastrous
first set to beat teammates
Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel
1-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the doubles final
of the Rolex Norcal Tennis
Championships at Saint Mary's
College in Moraga, Calif.
Devens and Flanagan's
secret: both stay back on the
return of serve, a Stanford-Dick
Gould trademark. The tradi
tional approach for today's top
doubles teams is comprised of
one person staying back,
returning serve from the base
line, the other up at the service
line, hoping to pick off a poorly
hit first volley. It wasn't work
ing for Devens and Flanagan.
Cocotos and Patel were poach
ing and handing the player at
the service line lunch in the
form of a tennis ball. Time to
change tactics. Time to both
stay back. It worked.
"They definitely overpow
ered us in the first set," Devens
said. "Then we decided to both
stay back on the return of
serve. It gave them a new look,
and it gave us a chance to put m
"We definitely played an
intelligent match. That was the
difference in the end," Flana
gan said.
In the singles final, Fresno

State's Greg Anderson beat
Washington's Chet Crile 6-3,6-4.
Cocotos and Patel, who
played No. 3 doubles for much
of last year, seemed unbeatable
in the first set.
"They played a great first
set. They returned well. They
served well. They were moving
well. It didn't seem like there
was much Flanagan and
Devens could do," asst. coach
John Whitlinger said.
"We were hot, and they start
ed a little cold," Cocotos said.
"Then they changed strategies
and made us a hit a few more
balls. That's when things
changed (for the worse)."
With the new strategy in
place, Devens and Flanagan
jumped out to a 5-3 lead. But
Cocotos and Patel broke serve,
giving Cocotos a chance to serve
and even the second set at 5-5.
After two service-return win
ners, however, Devens and
Flanagan were looking much bet
ter. They won the game at love.
"They never let us into that
game," Cocotos said.
Devens and Flanagan
entered the third set on a roll.
Cocotos and Patel were a little
flat, especially on the return of
serve. The result was a 6-2
third-set victory for Devens and
Flangan and their first tourna
ment victory as a team.
Was there any added incen
tive for the team of Devens and
Flanagan? "Coach Whitlinger
promised to take me to a Min
nesota North Stars game if we
won the tournament. (The win
ners receive a trip to the Rolex
National Indoors in Minneapo
lis.) That definitely had some
thing to do with the win,"
Devens said.
