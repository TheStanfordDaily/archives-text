# Student role in searches questioned
## Kennedy: Comments on Mahoney 'foolish' 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Serious questions have been raised
about student participation in Univer
sity appointment searches after mem
bers of a student committee gave confi
dential evaluations to The Daily, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy said.
The students said they did not know
their conclusions should be kept secret.
Kennedy was responding to the
comments made this week by mem
bers of the student committee in the
search for a vice president for student
resources. The students spoke openly

about their evaluations of the candi
dates, breaking the standard Universi
ty practice of keeping such informa
tion confidential.
The students said they intended to
recommend Mary Edmonds, the vice
president for student affairs at Bowl
ing Green University, for the position
— not Acting Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney. One
member also criticized Mahoney's job
performance.
"This is the first time I can remem
ber that we've had a breach of securi
ty," Kennedy said. "It was patently
foolish to speak out. ... It has dam

aged the search process seriously.
"I have been severely disappointed.
This has done serious harm to what
has been a strong model of student
involvement in these kind of searches.
No other university gives such a
strong, broad role to student involve

ment, and it's a shame that this has
happened," he continued.
"They were not supposed to talk
about the qualifications of the candi
dates," Kennedy said. "Somebody who
has been around as long as [student
committee member BennyJ Sandoval
should have known better. The most
damaging thing possible is premature
evaluations of the candidates."
Sandoval is a member of the Coun
cil of Presidents.
The four-member student commit
tee was selected by the dean of students
office at the request of the vice-presi
dential search committee, according to


'This is the
first...
breach of
security.'
