# Student role in searches questioned
## Kennedy: Comments on Mahoney 'foolish' 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Serious questions have been raised
about student participation in Univer
sity appointment searches after mem
bers of a student committee gave confi
dential evaluations to The Daily, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy said.
The students said they did not know
their conclusions should be kept secret.
Kennedy was responding to the
comments made this week by mem
bers of the student committee in the
search for a vice president for student
resources. The students spoke openly

about their evaluations of the candi
dates, breaking the standard Universi
ty practice of keeping such informa
tion confidential.
The students said they intended to
recommend Mary Edmonds, the vice
president for student affairs at Bowl
ing Green University, for the position
— not Acting Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney. One
member also criticized Mahoney's job
performance.
"This is the first time I can remem
ber that we've had a breach of securi
ty," Kennedy said. "It was patently
foolish to speak out. ... It has dam

aged the search process seriously.
"I have been severely disappointed.
This has done serious harm to what
has been a strong model of student
involvement in these kind of searches.
No other university gives such a
strong, broad role to student involve

ment, and it's a shame that this has
happened," he continued.
"They were not supposed to talk
about the qualifications of the candi
dates," Kennedy said. "Somebody who
has been around as long as [student
committee member BennyJ Sandoval
should have known better. The most
damaging thing possible is premature
evaluations of the candidates."
Sandoval is a member of the Coun
cil of Presidents.
The four-member student commit
tee was selected by the dean of students
office at the request of the vice-presi
dential search committee, according to


'This is the
first...
breach of
security.'
— Donald
Kennedy
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son. The student committee will
give its evaluations to the search
committee, which is chaired by
Provost James Rosse.
The search committee is made
up of various administrators and
faculty members, plus two stu
dents.
But the student committee
members said they were unclear
about what they were allowed to
say. According to member Rolan
da Gains, Valerie Mih, the under
graduate representative on the
vice presidential search commit
tee, "said that we could give our
own individual opinions about the
candidates."
Two of the student committee
members — Sandoval and fresh
man Edna Yahil — both said they
never received any indication that
the process was confidential.
University officials could not
point to any explicit directions
about confidentiality given to
the student committee mem
bers. "It's a rule of thumb," said
Jackson.
Despite the "unfortunate com
ments," Jackson said he still has
"strong faith in student involve
ment." He said he would not rec
ommend taking the students out

of the search process, and he
hoped the students on the presi
dential search committee would
not be affected.
Rosse, who will make the final
decision on who becomes vice
president, declined to comment
until the decision is made, saying
only that he thought that "the
article and the comments of the
students were inappropriate."
Kennedy said he was dismayed
by the "tactless and damaging
comments about a valued and very
respected senior member of the
Stanford community," Mahoney,
and added that "this looks like an
effort to put premature pressure
on the search committee."
But Tina Kass, associate vice
president for planning and man
agement, said the search commit
tee will proceed as planned,
despite the publicity. "I don't
think this means anything for the
search committee," she said.
"The committee has a process
[already] in place, and it will just
continue working through that."
An effort was made to appoint
a diverse group of students to the
committee. The Office of the Dean
of Students asked certain Stan
ford groups — the Women's Cen
ter, the Council of Presidents and
the African-American and Latino
communities — to recommend
individuals who they felt could
represent their interests in the
search for the new vice president.
