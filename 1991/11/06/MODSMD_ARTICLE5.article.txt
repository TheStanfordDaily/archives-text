# Freshman dorms may be hit in cuts
## Res Ed staff reductions considered 
### Chris Brazell Steve McCarroll Staff writers 
Reassessing priorities in the
wake of a half-million dollar
deficit-reduction target, Residen
tial Education officials are consid
ering reducing residence staffs,
relocating theme houses and
eliminating all-freshman dorms.
"Everything is on the table,"
said Asst. Director of Residential
Education Anne Porteus. "Any
where we spend money is being
considered."
Residential Education, Gradu
ate Residences and the Housing
Center have been assigned a col
lective reduction target of 15 per
cent. Supton estimated that Res
Ed will receive a cut of about
$500,000 in the current
$3,365,000 residential education
budget.
In a memo sent to residence
staffs describing budget-cutting
alternatives, Res Ed officials said
the central goal of the current
budget-cutting should be to pre
serve student contact with faculty
Resident Fellows.
The memo outlined the follow
ing potential reductions:
• The number of resident assis
tants may be reduced. The memo
suggests changing the current
RA-to-student ratio from one for
30 students to one for 45.
• RF positions may be consoli
dated or eliminated. Sterling
Quad, for example, might have
only one RF instead of four, Resi
dential Education Director Alice
Supton said yesterday. Apart
ment-like residences such as Mir
rielees might not have an RF
instead of having one.
• All-freshman dorms may be
eliminated; freshmen would be
distributed among the campus'
four-class residences. "This idea

isn't budget-driven, so much as
coming from the desire to maxi
mize student contact with Aca
demic Council faculty," Supton
said.
Supton said it's difficult to get
faculty to be RFs in all-freshman
dorms, and that going to a system
of four-class dorms would
enhance student-faculty contact.
Currently, many of the RFs in
freshman dorms are staff, not fac
ulty members.
However, a number of RAs
criticized that alternative yester
day."I think that's going back
wards," Gavilan RA Dana Rabois
said. "The all-frosh dorms are a
very valuable experience."
• Theme dorms such as Sla
vianskii Dom and the French
House may be moved from the
Row to Governor's Corner.
The Row buildings currently
housing the theme dorms could
become standard upper-class resi
dences, without RFs. Supton esti
mated that might save $15,000 in
each residence.
• Res Ed may make cuts in the
salaries of RAs, who currently
make between $4000 and $5000 a
year. Salaries for residential com
puter coordinators and ethnic
theme assistant positions might
be eliminated, according to the
memo.
Several RAs expressed concern
that such a move would limit the
applicant pool for residence staff
positions. "The amount of value
you get out of the relatively small
salaries of the student staff is
invaluable," former RA Jay Hey
man said.
Supton emphasized that no
decisions have yet been made. She
said Res Ed will hold weekly bud
get-planning meetings at which
"anyone who wants to do the
work can become a member of the
budget ignore advisory group."
