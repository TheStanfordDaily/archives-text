## ANC leader discusses group's struggle for constitution 
### Johnny Sun 
Describing himself in an opening
anecdote as a "wide-eyed young
man," Secretary General of the
African National Congress Cyril
Ramaphosa gave a wide-reaching
speech yesterday on the ANC's pro
posed constitution for South Africa.
A visiting scholar at Stanford
this week, Ramaphosa spoke to a
receptive audience of about 200
people in Kresge Auditorium. He
is the ANC's second-in-command
under Nelson Mandela and heads
the team involved in constitution
al negotiations with the South
African government.
ANC activities are directed
toward the elimination of domina
tion of man by man, Ramaphosa
said. "We have emerged victori
ous" because the government rec
ognized that negotiation was the
only alternative, he said.
"We have dragged them to the
negotiating table — screaming
and kicking," he said.

Referring to the government's
methods of drafting the constitu
tion, Ramaphosa said, "It is
inconceivable that an undemo
cratic process can produce a
democratic result."
The ruling National Party
used the South African Law Com
mission to draft its version of the
constitution, but the results were
not released to the public,
Ramaphosa said. "Why can't they
come out and say, This is what
we stand for'?" he asked.
"The ANC some time ago put
forth its draft bill of rights," the
only group to have done so, he said.
The objectives of the ANC's con
stitution include reunifying people
on the basis of a common citizen
ship and patriotism; enshrining
basic human rights and ensuring
these rights are defined and
enforceable; providing for non-dis
crimination, equal protection and
affirmative action and "creating
mechanisms to effect social and
economic transformation."

Ramaphosa criticized Presi
dent F.W. de Klerk's constitution
al proposals, saying they were
designed to protect and preserve
the privileges of white people. It is
a "democracy gone mad," he said.
The constitution drafted by the
ANC proposes a parliamentary
system and a multi-party system
guaranteeing regular elections.
Under this constitution, the party
that wins the election has the
right to lead the government and
the parties that lose have the
right to opposition.
De Klerk's proposals include
elections, but disperse power
among five state presidents, a set
up that would virtually paralyze
the elected government, accord
ing to Ramaphosa. He said this
"represents another white South
African version of democracy,"
adding that he hopes this kind of
democracy "finds its way into the
dust bins of history."
