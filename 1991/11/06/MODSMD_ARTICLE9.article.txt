the precincts reporting, Jordan, who vowed
to remove the homeless from city streets, had
35.7 percent of the vote. Agnos, who is seek
ing a second four-year term and led pre-elec
tion opinion polls, had 24.9 percent.

Term limits, euthanasia trail
SEATTLE (AP) — A proposal to slap the
nation's toughest term limits on Washington
state politicians was trailing with nearly a
third of returns tallied last night.
The political futures of U.S. House
Speaker Tom Foley and many other veteran
state politicians were at stake in a contest
viewed as a barometer of voter anger at poli
tics as usual. It also was a critical test of a
budding national term-limit movement.
With 30 percent of the state's precincts
reporting, Initiative 553 was trailing with 47
percent of voters, or 194,729, in favor, and
53 percent, or 217,348, opposed.
A first-in-the-nation plan to legalize
doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally

ill was also trailing early.
Gates will head CIA
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate yes
terday confirmed Robert Gates as head of
the Central Intelligence Agency following a
six-month ordeal that laid bare painful dis
putes within the spy agency.
The vote was 64 to 31, a strong margin
despite the taint of the Iran-Contra affair
that dung to Gates through much of the
confirmation hearings and charges that he
tailored intelligence reports to suit the polit
ical views of Reagan administration higher*
ups.
"If you're going to find someone who's
never made a mistake, you've got to find
someone who's never made a decision," said
Intelligence Committee Chairman David
Boren, D-Okla., the most outspoken Gates
booster in the Senate.
But doubts lingered among many law
makers. "I have an uneasy feeling about Mr.
Gates, and I don't think we ought to have
that uneasy feeling about whoever heads the
CIA," said Sen. Paul Simon, D-111., who
voted against confirmation.
Publisher Maxwell found dead
MADRID, Spain (AP) — Robert Maxwell,
the flamboyant billionaire who built a global
publishing empire, was found dead yester
day in waters off the Canary Islands. He

reportedly fell from his 180-foot luxury
yacht.
The death of the 68-year-old publisher
ended the reign of a contentious press baron
who battled press unions, barked out orders
in one of eight languages and bullied editors
as he built a $2 billion media conglomerate.
The Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who
escaped the Holocaust and immigrated to
Britain in 1940, personally ran the empire.
His death has raised questions about the
future of his debt-burdened holdings, which
include New York's Daily News.
"He was larger than life," British
Conservative Party lawmaker Anthony
Beaumont-Dark said. "He was the Citizen
Kane of his time. If you wrote a film about
his life it would be rejected as unrealistic."
Israel bans demonstrations
JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli army
announced yesterday that Palestinian peace
demonstrations in the occupied territories
will not be permitted because they could
escalate into violent confrontations.
"We are not allowing any demonstra
tions," Chief of Staff Lt. Gen Ehud Barak
declared on a tour of the West Bank. "Many
demonstrations starting with olive branches
... quickly become very violent."
Participants have sometimes clashed with
Israeli troops or members of Muslim funda
mentalist and radical Palestinian groups
opposing the talks.
