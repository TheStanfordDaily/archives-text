Stop the Bulldozers!
Within days, possibly as soon as this Friday, November 8, the Stanford
Administration may demolish the beautiful and historic Synergy House,
formerly the Beta Chi Chapter of Sigma Nu.
The Committee for the Preservation of Historic Stanford has been working
for months to suggest alternatives to the demolition of this house and of
the Delta Tau Delta and Phi Psi houses.
Last month, in what could have become a major tragedy, the Delta Tau Delta
house burned to the ground. Stanford knew that this house was a fire
hazard yet allowed the house to stand for weeks with its sprinkler and
alarm systems disconnected, and ignored our Committee's offer to pay for
the trimming of high weeds. Although the fire was believed to be arson,
the investigation has been suspended.
The petition below has been circulated since before the Delta Tau Delta
House burned down. Its signers include current students, faculty, staff,
community residents, and alumni spanning four decades.
If you want to see Synergy House preserved, please call President Donald
Kennedy immediately at 723-2481, and let him know you want to see the
demolition deferred and alternatives explored. To help our campaign
please call 415-494-3006.
To the Stanford Administration and Board of Trustees:
Whereas the student residences on San Juan I Iill - Synergy, the Delt I louse, and Phi Psi -
are all beautiful and historic buildings; qnd
Whereas they can all be repaired for less cost and more quickly than creating new
student housing;
Whereas the decision to demolish them was reached without any input from students,
alums, or historic preservationists;
And whereas the alternatives to the demolition of the houses and their replacement with
faculty housing have not been fully explored;
We the undersigned join in the efforts of the Committee for the Preservation of 1 listoric
Stanford, and strongly urge the Stanford Administration to delay the demolition of the 1 lill
Houses for six months and to co-operatively explore the alternatives that would preserve
them for student housing.

Stop the Bulldozers!
Within days, possibly as soon as this Friday, November 8, the Stanford
Administration may demolish the beautiful and historic Synergy House,
formerly the Beta Chi Chapter of Sigma Nu.
The Committee for the Preservation of Historic Stanford has been working
for months to suggest alternatives to the demolition of this house and of
the Delta Tau Delta and Phi Psi houses.
Last month, in what could have become a major tragedy, the Delta Tau Delta
house burned to the ground. Stanford knew that this house was a fire
hazard yet allowed the house to stand for weeks with its sprinkler and
alarm systems disconnected, and ignored our Committee's offer to pay for
the trimming of high weeds. Although the fire was believed to be arson,
the investigation has been suspended.
The petition below has been circulated since before the Delta Tau Delta
House burned down. Its signers include current students, faculty, staff,
community residents, and alumni spanning four decades.
If you want to see Synergy House preserved, please call President Donald
Kennedy immediately at 723-2481, and let him know you want to see the
demolition deferred and alternatives explored. To help our campaign
please call 415-494-3006.
To the Stanford Administration and Board of Trustees:
Whereas the student residences on San Juan I Iill - Synergy, the Delt I louse, and Phi Psi -
are all beautiful and historic buildings; qnd
Whereas they can all be repaired for less cost and more quickly than creating new
student housing;
Whereas the decision to demolish them was reached without any input from students,
alums, or historic preservationists;
And whereas the alternatives to the demolition of the houses and their replacement with
faculty housing have not been fully explored;
We the undersigned join in the efforts of the Committee for the Preservation of 1 listoric
Stanford, and strongly urge the Stanford Administration to delay the demolition of the 1 lill
Houses for six months and to co-operatively explore the alternatives that would preserve
them for student housing.
