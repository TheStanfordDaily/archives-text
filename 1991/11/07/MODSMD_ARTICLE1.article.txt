# Students claim ignorance, defend remarks
## Publicity not bad, Sandoval says 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Students advising the official
search committee for a new vice
president for student resources
said yesterday that public com
ments made about the candidates
were the result of miscommunica
tion, not malice.
"We were just stating our rec
ommendations about the candi
dates," said junior Benny San
doval, a member of the four-stu
dent advisory committee.
"We weren't intending to do
anything against the administra
tion or cause problems," said San
doval, a Council of Presidents
member.
Freshman Edna Yahil, another
student committee member, said,
"There was never any indication
made to me that the process was
confidential."
Three students on the commit
tee told The Daily Monday that
the committee unanimously
planned to recommend Mary
Edmonds for the position.
Edmonds is vice president of stu
dent affairs at Bowling Green
State University in Ohio. Two of
the students also criticized Acting
Vice President for Student
Resources Sally Mahoney, anoth
er candidate for the position.
Sandoval said she did not see

why the opinions of the student
committee should be kept a
secret. "I think what we say as
students is important. I don't
think it's necessarily bad that this
is public," she said.
Several administrators, includ
ing University President Donald
Kennedy, have denounced the
students' decision to speak out,
calling it a "breach of security."
"It was patently foolish to
speak out. ... It has damaged the
search process seriously,"
Kennedy said.
"Somebody who has been
around as long as Sandoval should
have known better," he added.
Edmonds, reached yesterday in
Ohio, said she was not sure how to
respond to the students' public
comments and the controversy.
"My only proper response is that
I'm pleased to know I made a pos
itive impression," she said.
Assoc. Tresidder Director
Nancy Howe, who coordinated the
selection of the student committee
for the Office of the Dean of Stu
dents, said, "I assume that there
was some lack of clarity about the
student roles. I don't think they
would have said anything to the
newspaper if they had been more
clear about their roles.
"I don't know how this
occurred," Howe continued.
"My understanding was that
Valerie (Mih, the search com
mittee undergraduate represen
tative,) had met with them

ahead of time. Obviously, there
was some sort of miscommuni
cation."
Mih declined to comment
about the confidentiality issue.
Howe said she was not sure
who was at fault. "It's not clear to
me whether what they did is right
or wrong," she said. "But if you
could, try to imagine what it's like

to be IMahoney]. There's a lack of
understanding of the University
process and the sensitivity of the
issues."
Sandoval said, "I'm just upset
because we weren't told that [our
evaluations] were strictly confi
dential.
"We never intended this to be
front page news," she added.
