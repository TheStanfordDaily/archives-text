Landslides devastate Philippines
TACLOBAN, Philippines (AP) — Landslides
unleashed by a tropical storm roared down
mountains in the Philippines, sweeping scream
ing victims into the sea. More than 2,300 people
died, and another 1,500 were missing and pre
sumed dead, officials said yesterday.
The landslides hit the central islands of Leyte
and Negros on Tuesday, burying coastal shanty
towns under mud, debris and flood waters.
Court revisits school prayer
WASHINGTON (AP) — A new dispute over
school prayer left the Supreme Court grappling
with two questions yesterday: Should it allow
prayers at graduation and promotion ceremonies,
and how much would that lower the Constitu
tion's barrier to state-sponsored religion?
Lawyers for the Bush administration and
Providence, R. 1., school officials urged the court
to relax its 29-year ban on officially sponsored
worship in public schools to allow graduation
prayers by fashioning a more accommodating
interpretation of the Constitution's ban on "an
establishment of religion."
House blocks ban on counseling
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House voted
272-156 yesterday to block the Bush adminis
tration's ban on abortion counseling at federal
ly funded family planning clinics. But the mar
gin was well short of that needed to override
President Bush's threatened veto.
The House approved a $204 billion health,
education and labor spending bill that includes
language blocking for one year the administra
tion's ban on counseling.
Despite winning, abortion rights advocates
were disappointed they fell short of a two
thirds, or veto-proof, rmyority.
