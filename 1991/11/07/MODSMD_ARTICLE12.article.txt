# Interest rates lowered to avoid new recession
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve pushed a key interest rate to an 18-
year low yesterday in a fresh effort to jump
start the national economy and keep it
from sliding back into recession.
Major banks followed immediately with
a cut in their prime lending rates, lowering
the benchmark for many consumer and
business loans to a five-year low of 7.5 per
cent. However, analysts questioned
whether the moves would be enough.
President Bush said he was concerned
about slipping consumer confidence but
suggested hopefully that Americans "will
suddenly wake up," notice rates are down
and go out and buy cars and houses.
Private economists were far more pes
simistic as they surveyed a glut of weak
economic statistics showing rising unem
ployment and plummeting confidence.
The Federal Reserve announced that it
was slashing its discount rate, the interest
it charges to make direct loans to commer
cial banks, from 5 percent to 4.5 percent,
the lowest level since January 1973.
Later in the day, the central bank sig
naled that it was lowering its target for the
federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, by a quarter-point to
4.75 percent.
It marked the 13th time the Fed has
nudged the funds rate lower and the fifth
time it has cut the discount rate since the
recession began in July 1990.
But many analysts said they doubted
that the latest round of rate cuts would do
much to get jittery consumers spending
again, given the huge overhang of con
sumer debt from the 1980s and fears about

further job layoffs. Many economists said
they had revised their forecasts to increase
the chance of a double-dip recession.
"This is a very troubled economy," Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.,
said "There was some snapback in the
spring in manufacturing, housing and con
sumer spending, but all three areas look as
though they have run out of steam."
Bush, speaking to reporters at the White
House before leaving for a NATO meeting
in Rome, said that the results from Tues
day's elections showed that "when the
economy is slow, people are concerned.
They're hurting out there. They're con
cerned about their livelihood."
Michael Boskin, chairman of the presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, said
the administration believed the economy
will be doing better by the spring because of
the fall in interest rates, but he said the peri
od between now and then was uncertain.
"One has to form a judgment about what
all this negative news that has been hyped by
the media will do to consumer psychology,
consumer purchases and business invest
ment," Boskin said during an interview tele
vised by the U.S. Information Agency.
The president's economic advisers have
been sharply split on the question of
whether the administration should send to
Congress new tax cut proposals in an effort
to give the economy a shot in the arm.
Boskin has led a group that contends
new tax proposals aren't needed because
the recession is coming to an end and rev
enue lost in a tax cut will inflate a budget
deficit already projected to hit a record
$348 billion this year.
