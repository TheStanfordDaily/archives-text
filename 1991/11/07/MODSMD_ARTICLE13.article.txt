## Democrats hail Senate victory, Bush promises to fix economy 
### 
(AP) — Democrats savored
Sen. Harris Wofiford's smash
ing victory in Pennsylvania
Tuesday as evidence of increas
ing strength heading into the
1992 campaigns for the White
House and Congress. A chas
tened President Bush said
"we'll try even harder" to repair
the economy and expand health
insurance.
The sensitive issue of race
vied with pocketbook concerns
in postmortems on the off-year
elections. Bush hailed the sur
prise victory of Republican Kirk
Fordice in the Mississippi gov
ernor's race after a campaign
that stressed opposition to
racial quotas.
At the same time, the presi
dent sharply attacked Republi
can David Duke, the former Ku
Klux Klansman running in
next week's gubernatorial
runoff in Louisiana. Bush said
he'd vote for the Democrat in
the race if he had to choose.
Sponsors of term limitations
for members of Congress licked
their wounds after suffering a
surprising defeat in Wash
ington state, but vowed the
issue would re-emerge in a
dozen states or more next year.
"Mark another one up for
the ruling class of career politi

cians," Ann Best, executive
director of Citizens for Con
gressional Reform, said.
Seven-term Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., said, "I don't think
any of us should underestimate
the frustration and anger that
people feel."
The crosscurrents were
strong in elections that reached
from the U.S. Senate to county
supervisors.
While the term-limitation
measure failed in Washington,
incumbents were turned out of
office in striking numbers —
Gov. Ray Mabus in Mississippi
and Mayor Kathy Whitmire in
Houston among them.
House Speaker Tom Foley,
who rallied the opposition to
the term-limit measure in
Washington, said the results
showed voters aren't "blind,
raging, out of control" despite
their anger.
Anti-tax sentiment came
through loud and clear in New
Jersey, where Democrats lost
control of the legislature after
pushing through a large tax
increase in 1990.
Ronald Brown, chairman of
the Democratic National Com
mittee, said Tuesday's results
showed "Americans are ready
for change."
