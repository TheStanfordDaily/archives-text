All-freshman dorms
must survive budget
cuts before RFs, RAs

Every year, a new group
of freshmen faces the confus
ing and sometimes frighten
ing process of making its way in a
new, intimidating environment. But
these freshmen aren't alone â€” they
can share their anxieties with others
going through the very same trials.
The memorandum recently sent
out by the Office of Residential Edu
cation outlining possible Res Ed
budget cuts includes several solu
tions that would seriously under
mine the freshman experience.
While some of the same person
al support mechanisms are avail
able in four-class dorms, the Uni
versity should not eliminate the
opportunity for freshmen to live
together as their own community.
Separated from their families
and thrown together to deal with
the new responsibilities of college,
freshmen learn to lean on each
other for help and friendship. They
learn from each other's mistakes
and from strong bonds that often
last for the rest of their time here.
It doesn't make sense to give up
this kind of opportunity, especially
since very little money would be
saved by the move. In fact, Res Ed
Director Alice Supton has said the
idea "isn't budget-driven," but
instead comes from the desire to
give freshmen more contact with
faculty. Apparently it is difficult to
get faculty to serve as resident fel
lows for all-freshman dorms, and
as a result many freshman dorm
RFs are staff members.
Supton's statement implies con
tact with faculty is somehow more
valuable than contact with staff.
Staff RFs can provide just as much
guidance as faculty. And the ratio
of students to RFs is so large any
way that it is not worth sacrificing
the very real rewards of peer con
tact in all-freshman housing for

the exaggerated hope of increased
faculty-student interaction.
If cuts have to be made in residen
tial education, residences with fresh
men should be the last to be looked at.
The memo suggests the number
of resident assistants could be
decreased from a ratio of one RA to
each 30 students to one to 45.
Rather than cutting RAs across the
board, Res Ed should reduce or elim
inate those in upper-class housing.
Students who live in places like
the Suites, fraternities and co
operatives can plan their own
activities and don't need the same
support freshmen do. While fresh
man residences could lose a few
RAs without too many problems,
the ratio of students to RAs in
these dorms needs to remain low.
Reducing the number of RA
positions should also eliminate the
need to cut RA salaries. Salaries
must remain high enough to
attract diverse and highly-quali
fied applicants for the positions.
Before cutting freshman dorms
and their RAs, Res Ed should get rid
of RFs and RAs in upper-class
dorms. By the end of their freshman
year, many students have developed
their own contacts with faculty and
staff through classes and activities.
They can invite people to the dorm
for dinner or presentations without
having an RE
Another proposal in the Res Ed
memo is to move theme houses such
as Slavianskii Dom and the French
House from the Row to Governor's
Corner, making the Row Houses
into regular dorms without RFs.
This seems like quite a round
about way of eliminating RF posi
tions. Why not just cut the RF posi
tions in Governor's Cornerand non
theme Row Houses? The vacated
housing facilities could then be
filled by students. Anyhow, part of
the appeal of theme dorms is the
unique, old-fashioned homes they
are housed in.
While serious cuts do have to be
made in the Res Ed budget, all
freshmen dorms and support staff
for freshmen should be the last
components to go.
