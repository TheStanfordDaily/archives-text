£ CARLETT," THE SEQUEL to
Mitchell's civil war
has hit the bookstores. The
movie rights just sold for $8 million.
Roseanne Barr and Tom Arnold may star
in the miniseries. "Gone With The Wind"
mania is upon us.
I didn't want to miss any of the excite
ment, so I headed to the Stanford Theatre
this Saturday to watch Vivien Leigh and
Clark Gable duke it out for four hours.
It was quite the event. I have never seen
the Theatre so packed or look so radiant in
its 1930s splendor. The crowd was tingling
in anticipation of watching the greatest
movie of all time. Adults crowded the
aisles, and children bounced on their seats.
Always the good Stanford student, I
wanted to make this an educational as
well as a cultural experience. I told my
movie companions that we should choose
a serious question to ponder as we
watched Scarlett and Rhett and that we
could pass the time during intermission
discussing the topic. I proposed the ques
tion, "Is this a racist film?"
Clearly, I had never seen the movie
before. As the overture played we saw
scenes of the "Old South" and an intro
duction scrolled up the screen telling us
that we were about to watch a story of a
those lost golden years when masters
were masters and slaves were slaves.
The film was barely 30 seconds old when
I leaned over and said to my friend Solomon:

"Maybe we should choose a new question."
I have never seen a more patronizing
view of African-Americans. Except for
Mammy, every African-American in the
movie was portrayed as an unintelligent
child, almost like a pet. Prissy was the
stupid liar. Big Sam was the stupid giant.
The newly freed slaves were the stupid,
rhythm-filled vote-sellers.
I decided to ask a new question. "Why
doesn't anybody get up and indignantly
walk out of the theater?"
The answer was obvious: The movie is
great drama. The story is not really about
the Civil War or about slavery. The story
is about Scarlett. The loss of the Old
South is a metaphor for the loss of her
childhood and innocence. It is a personal
coming-of-age story, played against the
backdrop of a national one.
Admittedly, parts of the movie were
offensive. But there are thousands of
similar cases when we stay in our seats
through good drama because the offen
sive material is dated or weak or we sim
ply choose to ignore it.
How often is "The Merchant of
Venice" boycotted because of Shylock?
How many of us walk out of "Casablan
ca" when Ilsa tells Rick, "You'll have to
think for both of us?"
Which leads to a third question:
"Should we have left the theater?"
At first, I didn't know how to answer this
question. But then I imagined what I would

have done had the story been about Eva, a
young and determined Nazi struggling to
survive after World War 11. I can excuse a
little Shakespearean anti-Semitism, but to
trivialize the systematic persecution of Jews
would be to deny the holocaust.
Shakespeare's Shylock represents a
false and disgusting image of Jews. But
he remains an individual character, easi
ly ignored. The imaginary "Gone With
The Nazi Wind" portrays a false image of
Jewish history, thereby denying a people
its identity. Such films belong in history
departments to be interpreted, not in
movie theaters to be celebrated.
So I think we should have left the the
ater. "Gone With The Wind" isn't offen
sive because of its paternalistic portrayal of
African-Americans. A portrayal here and
there simply doesn't matter very much.
The movie is offensive because it
paints a rosy picture of slavery. Slavery
and its legacy of racism have been this
nation's crucible. They help define us as
Americans. As a symbol and as a reality
they are too important to be cast away for
a night's worth of good drama.
