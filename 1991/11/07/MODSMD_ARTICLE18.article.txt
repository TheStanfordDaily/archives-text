'Musicology without performance is language without speech'

IN A TIME OF CUTBACKS, WHY
should Stanford protect music?
Because we are a powerful antidote
to the image and narrowness of "Stan
ford Tech," because we help attract
some of the world's most talented fresh
men and because performance requires
high discipline of its givers — and offers
challenge and delight to its audience.
Our classroom teachers research,
publish and lead in scholarly work. Our
performers also "publish," doing so in
concert and in recital. They, too, are
adjudicated as to the originality of their
research, the reproducibility of their
means, the power and elegance of their
findings.
Indeed, unlike our colleagues in the
lab, performers must offer their experi

ments in public, subject to the scrutiny
of anyone who may happen by, regard
less of training.
Musicology without performance is
language without speech. Similarly, per
formance uninformed by rigorous intellec
tual inquiry is naive and ill-founded. Each
needs the other. To remove the one leaves
the other a cripple. We need both of these
partners — scholarship and musicianship
— for our enterprise to succeed.
For students, performance in music is
no frill. It is vital as life, creative as love.
For Stanford, the very traditions and
prerequisites of musicianship build —
profoundly — skills of application in
every other discipline. This is no frill. It
is of very great advantage when students
and their ensembles are auditioned,

built, coached and led by the first-class
professionals we have been able to bring
to Stanford.
As with all strong performers, they
are also historians, psychologists, techni
cians, multilingual and multi-talented.
More than 800 students participate in
our ensembles and learn from these pro
fessionals. They learn skills of leader
ship, collegiality and self-discipline. To
perform at the level we expect, our stu
dent-musicians must spend long and
lonely hours in the practice room, unre
warded and unrecognized.
This, of course, is in addition to the
hours they already spend in the study
hall doing problem sets, labs and every
thing else expected of them.
Of these 800, fewer than 60 are music

majors.
The rest are with us for love, deepen
ing the experience of the hundreds of
skills musicians bring to bear upon every
occasion.
The rest are becoming engineers, doc
tors, biologists, philosophers, designers,
mathematicians, legislators and
entrepreneurs.
They will take from our traditions in
music these great gifts of private will
and public reward, of creativity and its
expression, of the simple and astonish
ing truths of music, and apply them to
every human endeavor.
In this, we are all the richer. In this,
so is Stanford, every day.
