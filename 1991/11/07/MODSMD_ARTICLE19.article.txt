# Community has right to hear honest opinion of student committee
## 
### 
As one of the students who inter
viewed the final candidates for the posi
tion of vice president of student
resources, I wish to clarify the process
that took place.
The final candidates were publicly
announced, open forums were held and
written opinion was collected. Further
more, our student recommendations to
the search committee openly reflected
our opinion. If anyone would have come
up to us personally, including The Daily,
we would have kept our recommendation
no secret. We consider our evaluation
honest and important, not at all "silly."
I regret that the news was covered
with poor tact and that possible damage
to the finalists may result. However, I
also regret that student opinion cannot
be freely expressed, especially when
selecting our direct student representa

tive to the administration.
I am confident that our honest state
ments would not have become public if
we had been clearly advised not to make
them so. Students do not "leak out"
information about part of a process that
is understood to be confidential. Stu
dents do respect and understand the
importance of the University's standard
of confidentiality.
Now that student involvement is
actively being sought through commit
tees, such as the budget liaison groups
and the presidential search committee,
student roles should be explicitly
defined.
Often information is expected to be
kept private without this being stated.
Honesty and clarity are therefore cru
cial. As students we were honest in stat
ing our opinion. How can our role be
questioned if it was never defined?
This situation should be avoided from
now on, especially as the University
evaluates its own progress in the near
future.
