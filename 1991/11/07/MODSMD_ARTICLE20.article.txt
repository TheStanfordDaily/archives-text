# Student participation can be successful on search committees
## 
### 
Last year I served as a member of the
Dean of Students Consultative Group as
one of five students on the committee.
The group spent many hours poring
over resumes, reading cover letters,
interviewing candidates, hosting open
forums and discussing and debating the
issues that presented themselves.
Every step along the way, we talked
about the process. Confidentiality was
always stressed.
Stanford students have never been
ones for babysitting. Throughout my
undergraduate years here, I enjoyed the
responsibility I had that my peers at
other colleges and universities did not.
Therefore, there is some merit to
University President Donald Kennedy's
comment that student members of the
Vice Presidential Search committee
"should have known better," and Dean

of Students Michael Jackson's statement
that confidentiality is just "a rule of
thumb."
However, it should be incumbent upon
the chair of such a committee, in this case
Provost James Rosse, to stress the impor
tance of confidentiality to the members of
the student committee — especially those
less experienced — regardless of their age
or University affiliation.
Regardless, my point is not to find
fault. I am writing to express my concern
that this incident is now jeopardizing stu
dent participation on University search
committees. I felt is necessary to provide
at least one example in which it worked
very well to have student members.
Last year's Dean of Students Consul
tative Group, chaired — ironically — by
Sally Mahoney, was such an occasion.
I'm sure there are others. It is my hope
that this will be another of Stanford's
painful but educational experiences and
that — if we truly are a "family" — stu
dents will continue to have a strong and
influential voice in University searches.
