## Forza, Rafanelli! Explosive forward leads booters against Broncos 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
In three days, the Cardinal women's
soccer team will battle Santa Clara for
the right to one of the final eight spots
in the NCAA tournament.
Although both Stanford and the
Broncos boast excellent teams with
countless star players, no one will be
commanding the spotlight more than
Stanford forward Sarah Rafanelli.
The sophomore has been on a sea
son-long tear. In shattering the school
record for goals in a season with 16, she
has teamed with Julie Foudy to become
part of possibly the most feared scoring
tandem in the nation.
However, Foudy, who is in China
competing with the U.S. National
Team, will not be available for the Car
dinal-Bronco contest.
How will one of Stanford's Wonder
Twins fare without the other? Although
some fans may feel that Foudy's depar
ture may prove too great a loss, the team
remains confident that it can play with the
best in the country, even without Foudy.
As for the additional burden that
Rafanelli may have to shoulder offen
sively, she has taken her playoff role in
stride. "I don't feel any additional pres
sure," Rafanelli said. "Our team can do
well, even without her."
Indeed, the team's offensive unit has
not had much pressure placed on it. Allow
ing only four goals all season, one score
seems sufficient to win almost any game.
"Our team has been geared towards
defense," Rafanelli said. "We feel that if
we just play a possession game and shut
the other team down, we'll eventually
get a goal."
The team has entered each game
with that level of confidence, and it has
been reflected in the squad's play all

season. With 14 shutout victories and
only one loss through 17 games, the
Cardinal takes the field for each game
fully expecting to leave it 90 minutes
later with another victory.
Rafanelli has seen this dramatic
change in the team attitude from only a
season ago. "This year, we've got a lot
more confidence," Rafanelli said. "While
last year, we played each game hoping to
win, we go into games now expecting to."
Rafanelli went on to give reasons for
the Cardinal's improvement. "We've
added some key freshmen on defense,"
she said. "Melinda (Minstrell) and Kris
ten (Wair) have been leaders on the field."
Stanford will need all the team lead
ership that it can muster against Santa
Clara (10-5), who handed Stanford its
only loss of the season last month. It
took an extremely well-played game by
the Broncos and a sub-par performance
from the Cardinal for Santa Clara to
nose out Stanford, 2-1.
"A lot of us had off-games (against
the Broncos)," Rafanelli said. "Enough
of us had off-games that we just
couldn't find our rhythm."
Despite the fact that Santa Clara
ruined what was otherwise a perfect sea
son for the Cardinal, Rafanelli doesn't
believe revenge will be a factor in the con
test. "We're not thinking in terms of
revenge," Rafanelli said. "We're just out to
prove to ourselves that we can do better."

By beating the Broncos, the soccer
team will also do better than it did last
year, when the Cardinal lost in the first
round to UC-Santa Barbara.
While in 1990, the team was simply
happy to be at NCAAs, the Cardinal has
great expectations for the 1991 tourna
ment. "We've been playing each game
thinking, 'we have to win, we're going to
win, we expect to win,' " Rafanelli said.
Rafanelli herself is the product of a
small school in Piedmont, Calif., where
soccer was not a primary concern. She
played soccer for numerous club and
state teams before playing for the
under-19 national team.
Her fateful decision to come to the
Farm was not based on its excellent soccer
program. "I chose a place where I could be
happy without soccer," Rafanelli said,
then later added that several people ques
tioned that decision. But, she maintained,
"I've always loved Stanford. My dad and
sister went here, and I like being close to
home. And, of course, it's not the worst
school academically, either."
While Rafanelli may have been able to
be happy here without the soccer team,
the team might not be quite so happy
were it not for Rafanelli. In the 1991 sea
son, she has scored a point in all but
three of the Cardinal's games, and her
40 points on the season are a new school
single-season record.
And it's not over yet.

win, we go into games now expecting to."
Rafanelli went on to give reasons for
the Cardinal's improvement. "We've
added some key freshmen on defense,"
she said. "Melinda (Minstrell) and Kris
ten (Wair) have been leaders on the field."
Stanford will need all the team lead
ership that it can muster against Santa
Clara (10-5), who handed Stanford its
only loss of the season last month. It
took an extremely well-played game by
the Broncos and a sub-par performance
from the Cardinal for Santa Clara to
nose out Stanford, 2-1.
"A lot of us had off-games (against
the Broncos)," Rafanelli said. "Enough
of us had off-games that we just
couldn't find our rhythm."
Despite the fact that Santa Clara
ruined what was otherwise a perfect sea
son for the Cardinal, Rafanelli doesn't
believe revenge will be a factor in the con
test. "We're not thinking in terms of
revenge," Rafanelli said. "We're just out to
prove to ourselves that we can do better."

By beating the Broncos, the soccer
team will also do better than it did last
year, when the Cardinal lost in the first
round to UC-Santa Barbara.
While in 1990, the team was simply
happy to be at NCAAs, the Cardinal has
great expectations for the 1991 tourna
ment. "We've been playing each game
thinking, 'we have to win, we're going to
win, we expect to win,' " Rafanelli said.
Rafanelli herself is the product of a
small school in Piedmont, Calif., where
soccer was not a primary concern. She
played soccer for numerous club and
state teams before playing for the
under-19 national team.
Her fateful decision to come to the
Farm was not based on its excellent soccer
program. "I chose a place where I could be
happy without soccer," Rafanelli said,
then later added that several people ques
tioned that decision. But, she maintained,
"I've always loved Stanford. My dad and
sister went here, and I like being close to
home. And, of course, it's not the worst
school academically, either."
While Rafanelli may have been able to
be happy here without the soccer team,
the team might not be quite so happy
were it not for Rafanelli. In the 1991 sea
son, she has scored a point in all but
three of the Cardinal's games, and her
40 points on the season are a new school
single-season record.
And it's not over yet.
