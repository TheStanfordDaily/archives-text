# Card wins ugly over less-than-golden Bears
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
It was a Big Game that should
have been dubbed the Bad Game.
The men's soccer squads from
Stanford and California squared
off yesterday at Maloney Field in
a contest that resembled a hockey
match more than a soccer game.
And while the Cardinal (12-3-
5) emerged victorious by a 3-1
margin, the final score seemed
almost secondary to the bad taste
the match left in the mouths of
everyone involved.
"The refs really let the game
get out of control early, which
favored neither team," Bears
coach Bill Coupe said. "It was the
ugliest officiated game that we've
played in this year."
"It was definitely our ugliest
game of the season," Stanford
forward Ryan Collins said. "Cal
plays that way often, but we had
our share of hits, too."
The-match's tone was set early
in the first half, when Cardinal
midfielder Rhett Harty was
knocked out after suffering a bru
tal collision with Cal goalie Alec
Rosenberg 10 minutes into the
first half. Harty suffered a par
tially collapsed lung and was
rushed to Stanford Hospital. The
senior's injury could prove to be
costly if Stanford is selected Sun
day to the NCAA tournament.
The game didn't get any pretti
er. Stanford and Cal battled often,
amassing an unheard-of 37 team
fouls along with three yellow
cards and several near fistfights.
Despite their poor record, the
Bears (5-9-3) played the Cardinal
almost even for the entire match.
Stanford opened scoring midway
through the first period. Lance
Killian nailed a cross pass to full
back Brandon Farley, who one

touched the ball into the net for
his first goal of the year.
With under eight minutes to go
in the half, Jason Vanacour fol
lowed a Jim Talluto shot, drilling
the rebound into the left side of
the goal and giving the Cardinal a
2-0 lead at the half.
Only a minute into the second
period, Cal got on the board when
Justin Stockman converted on a
penalty kick, bringing the Bears
within one goal at 2-1.
Stanford maintained its slight
lead for almost the entire second
half, although Cal squandered sev
eral scoring opportunities. Indeed,
the Bears actually ended the game
with a 12-9 shots advantage.
With only three minutes to go
in the game, the Cardinal sealed
its win. Vanacour got free 30
yards from the goal, forcing
Rosenberg to commit to his shot.
Collins scooped up the rebound
on the right side, scoring his
ninth goal of the season from
about 20 yards.
Coupe was frustrated with the
Bears' effort. "This happens to us
every game. We weren't out
played — IStanford] figured out a
way to win, and we didn't."
Meanwhile, Stanford coaches
were anything but pleased with
their squad's performance in its
last regular-season game. "We
were very lucky today," asst. coach
Greg Petersen said. "If there is one
thing that we really have to
improve on, it is our mental game."
Despite the sour taste of yes
terday's game, the Cardinal
should qualify for the NCAA
tournament for the first time
since 1978. Stanford is currently
ranked fifth in the NCAA Divi
sion I Western poll, and the Selec
tion Committee picked five west
ern teams for the tournament last
year.
