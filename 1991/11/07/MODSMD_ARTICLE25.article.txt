# High Five America humbles men's hoops

### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Bashful Stanford showed up for its
basketball debutante ball last night at
Maples Pavilion, but despite the plead
ings of coach Mike Montgomery, the
inexperienced Cardinal refused to
dance.
High Five America waltzed a clumsy
three-step across the floor, inviting the
shy Cardinal to come out of the corner,
but Stanford refused to participate, los
ing 76-72.
There were a few winks from senior
forward Adam Keefe (14 points, six
rebounds, 26 minutes), a cute smile
from junior guard Kenny Hicks (16
points, five rebounds) and a warming
blush from freshmen David Harbour
and Andy Poppink (lots of hustle), but
despite the hopes of Montgomery and a
curious Maples crowd of 873, Stanford

never laced up its dancing shoes.
"I didn't think we were ready to play
a game yet, and we showed we were
not," said Montgomery, whose Nation
al Invitational Tournament champions
were more courageous their last time
on the floor. "I'm shocked by our per
formance, not by our losing."
Stanford turned the ball over 23
times and shot just nine-of-19 from the
free throw line, but the most disturb
ing aspect of the defeat was that except
for Keefe, nobody played with the
determination to win.
"I was disappointed with what went
on down the stretch," said Mont

gomery, who rotated 13 players
throughout the game. "Nobody want
ed to make a play. Nobody stepped up
and said 'I want to win the game.' We
didn't maintain our aggressiveness."
After Keefe left the game in a see
saw first half, Stanford's 22-21 lead
slipped to a 35-32 halftime deficit.
As soon as Keefe went to the bench
in the second half, High Five went on a
10-0 run to take its biggest lead of the
game, 61-50, with eight minutes left.
But Stanford showed its first sign of a
heartbeat in a 14-0 run, with troikas
from Hicks and Bobby Patton, an
offensive rebound and layup from
Hicks, and inside scores from Paul
Garrett and Brent Williams.
Leading 64-61 after a Jason Weaver
dunk, Stanford blushed at the face of
victory and lowered its debutante veil.
Sparked by 20 second-half points from
former New Mexico State guard Ken

Travis, High Five had no choice but to
take the win.
After Keefe missed a three-pointer,
High Five went ahead 74-66, then
sealed the victory with two free throws
from guard Earl Kelly.
"I don't like to lose, and I don't like
the fact that we lost the way we did,"
said Hicks, who led Stanford with 16
points, but had a team-high five
turnovers. "If we had played hard and
aggressive the whole game we
wouldn't have lost."
Maybe Stanford was unaccustomed
to the rough-and-tumble, no-gloves style
of the High Five men, who lost at Wash
ington State Tuesday night 95-81 and
didn't arrive at Stanford until 4 p.m.
Maybe too many people were watching.
But if Stanford doesn't get comfortable
on the floor by the regular season, oppo
nents will stop waltzing in Maples and
start doing a vicious slam dance.
