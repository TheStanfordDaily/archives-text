# Dreams about chainsaw bowl
## 
### 
You football fans have probably had
twinkie-induced dreams about Stanford play
ing in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day. You
lust for coconut-scented suntan lotion, foot
ball by the beach and the perfunctory Hawai
ian lei.
My dreams are different — twisted some
may say. All night I hear the growl of a chain
saw. In my football dreams, I'm rooting for an
invitation to the Poulan-Weed Eater Indepen
dence Bowl, played Dec. 29 in Shreveport, La.
To the winner goes the vaunted Poulan cham
pionship chainsaw.

If Stanford can beat UCLA and Washing
ton State, we may be headed for Honolulu,
but I think Denny Green has too much char
acter to accept an invitation to a teflon-coated
bowl like the Aloha. Like me, he's probably
dreaming of power lawn equipment.
Any bowl game played on astro-turf, with
bikini-clad hula dancers cavorting on the side
line and the surf beckoning outside is phony.
Football was meant to be played the John
Madden way: in miserable weather, on real
grass, in oozing mud, with blood-crazed fans
drooling for lots of defense. The cheerleaders
should wear wool skirts and ear muffs, the
players should have nothing on their minds
but pigskins and blocking schemes.
Representatives from numerous bowls will
be on hand for Saturday's UCLA game, but I
think we should sign an early deal with the
Weed Eater people. It's a bowl game dream
come true:
•Atmosphere. The Weed Eater Bowl is
played on natural grass (no dandelions, of
course) in Independence Stadium. The
mosquitoes and locusts knock down most
passes, so you have to run the ball.
•Blockbuster trade. In conjunction with the
game, we could make a three-way trade of
unwanted personnel. We send President Don
ald Kennedy to govern Louisiana, they ship
David Duke to play center for the Sacramento
Kings and we get wobbly-kneed giant Ralph
Sampson as our next president. Everybody
would be happy.
•The David. Duke halftime show. Our band
has been controversial before with shows
about things like spotted owls, but we've
never had this kind of opportunity for innova
tive social criticism. Of course, owls don't put
on a white sheet and start shooting at you in
response to the playing of "White (racist)
Punks on Dope."
The Band could have a field day with Mr.
Duke (no relation to Christian Laettner), who
may be elected Governor of Louisiana on Nov.
16. I'm sure he would get a good chuckle out
of field formations symbolizing the economic
embargo of Louisiana and the destruction of
the Republican Party.
