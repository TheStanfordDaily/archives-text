The weather was great and
the competition was fierce at the
UCLA Desert Classic, but the
Stanford men's and women's
golf teams faltered, each falling
short of expectations in this
week's tournament.
The women's team, just
didn't perform at their usual
level, finishing with a team score
of 917, good for eighth place.
After a disappointing second
round of golf, in which the team
total was 315 strokes, the women
were back on track on Wednes
day, ending with 300 strokes.
The third day total, howev
er, could not pull the Cardinal
back into the top-five.
Tuesday "was our worst out
ing of the year," said women's
coach Tim Baldwin, "I have no
explanation for it. . . . There
was a definite deterioration on
the back nine."

Audrey Wooding had two
great days of golf, but scored
an 81 in the second round. Her
73 and 71 on the other two
days were good enough to
obtain 16th place individually.
Adele Moore finished in 18th
place with a three-day tally of
79, 75 and 72. Jamille Jose fin
ished in 26th with 76, 78 and
76. Melinda Daniels hit 74, 81
and 81, good for 39th place.
The men came away with
fifth place after a slightly better
performance, with 894 strokes.
Notah Be gay was the highest
Cardinal finisher, tying for
ninth with a three-round total of
221. Begay started out on a bad
note with 78 on Monday, but
regained his composure for the
next two days, shooting 72 on
Tuesday and 71 on Wednesday.
Cardinal golfers Casey Mar
tin, Mike Milliken and Chris
tian Cevaer all finished with a
225 stroke total, tied for 19th
place.
