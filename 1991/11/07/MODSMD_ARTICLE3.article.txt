# $1 million pledged for Synergy
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
A national organization of student co-operative
groups offered yesterday to purchase and renovate
the earthquake-damaged Synergy house, two days
before its intended demolition by the University.
In a facsimile sent to University President Don
ald Kennedy yesterday afternoon, the North Amer
ican Students of Cooperation offered up to $1 mil
lion to restore the brown-shingled student resi
dence, which has been closed since the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
Stanford plans to demolish the building "as soon
as possible," University Counsel Susan Hoerger said
yesterday. Because of a legal complication unrelated
to yesterday's offer, University officials have agreed
not to demolish the building before Friday.
Administrators said the offer is not likely to be
accepted because it would require the University to
transfer ownership of Stanford property to an out
side organization.
"We have declined those kinds of offers in the
past," according to Acting Vice President for Stu
dent Resources Sally Mahoney. "It would represent
a serious departure of policy for us."
The University turned down a similar offer from
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity last year.
Although many residences were originally built and
owned by fraternities, sororities and co-operatives, the
University has bought back all but two — Sigma Chi
and Chi Theta Chi — during the past 50 years.
North American Students of Cooperation, based
in Ann Arbor, Mich., is an organization of more
than 50 campus co-operatives in the United States
and Canada.
Yesterday's letter, signed by the organization's
Executive Director Robert Cox, said the group
"could provide private financing
sources for this project which
would both preserve the structure
. . . and also save the University
from spending funds which would
better go toward other education
al purposes."
The organization preserved a
similar co-operative at UC-Davis
last year by arranging private
financing.
"Our initial look leads us to
believe that (Synergy) may be a
very strong investment," Cox said
yesterday.
Council of Presidents member
John Overdeck said the Universi

ty would be shortsighted not to
consider the offer. "We've seen
repeated interest" in saving the
house, he said. "I think that all
available pressure should be put
on the University to consider this
very seriously."
Stanford officials plan to build
revenue-generating faculty hous
ing on the site, then use the rev
enue to finance student housing
elsewhere on campus.
Opponents of the planned
demolition have contended the
turn-of-the-century fraternity
house is historically and architec
turally significant.
Synergy was designed by John
Bakewell and Arthur Brown, the
architects of Hoover Tower and
the San Francisco and Berkeley
City Halls.

University officials had origi
nally planned to demolish Syner
gy and the nearby Delta Tau
Delta fraternity house in August.
But members of the Committee
for the Preservation of Historic
Stanford successfully challenged
the University's demolition per
mit in court this summer.
The University has obtained
another demolition permit for Syn
ergy. The Delt house was consumed
in a three-alarm fire Oct. 11.
