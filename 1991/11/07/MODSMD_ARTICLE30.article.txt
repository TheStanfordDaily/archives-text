# Vanishing forests threaten essential balance of nature

"The forest is much more than
just the trees," environmental
activist Lou Gold told students in
Kresge Auditorium last night.
And all the other organisms
living there are "woven into a del
icate web of life," he said as he told
lively stories about ancient forests
to more than 150 students.
With the aid of colorful
slides, he explained the impor
tance of balance in an ecosystem
through the " 'pooper's princi
ple' of forest ecology."
The principle goes something
like this: The red-black vole, a
small mouse, eats truffles, which
are mushrooms that grow
underground. The vole's excre
ment contains a fungus that
attaches itself to the roots of
trees. The fungus collects nutri

ents from the soil for the tree
and in return receives sugars
and carbohydrates from the
tree's sap. Forests are intercon
nected environments, he said.
If people act fast and act
together there may still be a
chance to save the forests, Gold
said, suggesting that concerned
citizens write letters, call sena
tors, contribute funds and vol
unteer to aid local organizations.
The United States, Gold said,
has seen a rapid deterioration of
its forests over the past century:
• In 1900, only 1 percent of
the original forest had been cut
down;
• By the end of World War 11,
66 percent had been cut; and
• Today, more than 90 percent
of the original forests are gone.
Brazil, which is often criti
cized for allowing deforestation,
still retains more that 80 per-

cent of its forests, he said.
Another argument against
deforestation is the loss of life
forms with potential medicinal
applications. For example, one
type of tree in the Pacific
Northwest was recently found
to contain taxol, a potential cure
for some types of cancer.
Gold said he is not against
logging, but he wants to see it
done in an ecologically sound
fashion such as selection logging,
where only certain trees are cut.
A native of Chicago, Gold
obtained a graduate degree in
city politics.
A desire to escape city life
later led him to the Siskiyue
Mountain range in Oregon, he
explained. Once there, he quick
ly became an environmentalist
after he discovered that the
bountiful trees around him
would soon be chopped down.
