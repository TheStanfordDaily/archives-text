Never take the red-eye on Halloween.
I did, and the only plus in the whole experi
ence was being able to walk up and down the
aisles with a barf bag and say "trick or treat" to the
other passengers. Let's just say by the end of the
flight I had more dry roasted peanuts than any boy
could possibly dream of.

Consider: I was just sitting there, getting really
into this magazine article titled "Oregon: An Unex
plored Culture" when the pilot's voice swanked over
the public-address system.
"For the purpose of balancing this aircraft for
takeoff, it will be necessary to move at least 75 peo
ple behind row 29."
I thought he was kidding, pulling one of those
nutty Halloween gags they kept warning us about in
those dittos they handed out in elementary school.
But then I saw it transpire before my very eyes.
Mothers were separated from their children, wives
from their husbands, old women from their large
packages. And before I knew it, a steward asked me
to move to seat 32L.
I started making impassioned speeches about
Rosa Parks and the fact that if I moved, the fat guy
in 32A would make us fly too much to the left, but
the steward wouldn't listen. I wound up sitting next
to some 38-year-old woman who sold time-shares in
Fort Lauderdale. She was getting the vegetarian
meal.
Now, I should explain that planes don't usually
scare me. I mean, I still don't see how a piece of
metal weighing 210 tons can stay in the air, but
then again I don't understand those Calvin Klein
ads either â€” it's one of those things you just accept.
But the thought that my 168 pounds of live
weight could be crucial to the safety of the plane
reminded me a little too much of making sure the fat
kid sat in the middle of the canoe. I decided to ask
my Aero 280 professor about this as soon as I got
back.
Now, the reason I was taking a plane on All Hal
low's Eve wasn't just so I could catch the War
rant/Cinderella show at the Garden. No, I was flying
home for my sister's bat mitzvah.
In the life of any Jewish adolescent, a bar or bat
mitzvah is an extremely pivotal moment. It's kind of
a Semitic coming out party, only you have to do this
funny dance where they put you on a chair and lift
you over their heads until you feel like an Iranian
leader at his own funeral. Anyway, it's real impor
tant.
