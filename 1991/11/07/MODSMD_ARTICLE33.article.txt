# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Peanuts, adolescents and dancing Jews 
### 
Never take the red-eye on Halloween.
I did, and the only plus in the whole experi
ence was being able to walk up and down the
aisles with a barf bag and say "trick or treat" to the
other passengers. Let's just say by the end of the
flight I had more dry roasted peanuts than any boy
could possibly dream of.

Consider: I was just sitting there, getting really
into this magazine article titled "Oregon: An Unex
plored Culture" when the pilot's voice swanked over
the public-address system.
"For the purpose of balancing this aircraft for
takeoff, it will be necessary to move at least 75 peo
ple behind row 29."
I thought he was kidding, pulling one of those
nutty Halloween gags they kept warning us about in
those dittos they handed out in elementary school.
But then I saw it transpire before my very eyes.
Mothers were separated from their children, wives
from their husbands, old women from their large
packages. And before I knew it, a steward asked me
to move to seat 32L.
I started making impassioned speeches about
Rosa Parks and the fact that if I moved, the fat guy
in 32A would make us fly too much to the left, but
the steward wouldn't listen. I wound up sitting next
to some 38-year-old woman who sold time-shares in
Fort Lauderdale. She was getting the vegetarian
meal.
Now, I should explain that planes don't usually
scare me. I mean, I still don't see how a piece of
metal weighing 210 tons can stay in the air, but
then again I don't understand those Calvin Klein
ads either — it's one of those things you just accept.
But the thought that my 168 pounds of live
weight could be crucial to the safety of the plane
reminded me a little too much of making sure the fat
kid sat in the middle of the canoe. I decided to ask
my Aero 280 professor about this as soon as I got
back.
Now, the reason I was taking a plane on All Hal
low's Eve wasn't just so I could catch the War
rant/Cinderella show at the Garden. No, I was flying
home for my sister's bat mitzvah.
In the life of any Jewish adolescent, a bar or bat
mitzvah is an extremely pivotal moment. It's kind of
a Semitic coming out party, only you have to do this
funny dance where they put you on a chair and lift
you over their heads until you feel like an Iranian
leader at his own funeral. Anyway, it's real impor
tant.

The Tao to Nowhere
So I bought a suit at Saks, got a
haircut at Tony Lucco's and tried
to buy my sister a classy present
at the duty-free gift shop, but I
thought I heard my name called
for the white courtesy telephone,
and, well, you know how it is.
Anyway, I arrived at my quaint
New Jersey abode at 7 a.m. and
my grandmother was up, making
coffee. And before I could put my
bags down, she started telling me
stories about how the weight of
long hair causes premature bald
ing.
"You used to have such nice,
thick hair."
"Yeah, I know. And Milton
Berle used to have better guests
on."
"What? You talk too quickly."
But none of it mattered. This
was a bat mitzvah. Loosely trans
lated, bar or bat mitzvah means
"large party with relatives you've
never met." It is a happy occasion
at which your uncle gets sloshed,
leans against the Viennese table
and tells you things you never
wanted to know about your aunt.
So the morning of the bat mitz

vah I threw on my double-breast
ed suit and put a healthy dose of
gel in my hair. I looked hot, real
hot — even my mother was hit
ting on me, I looked so hot.
I went to the temple and lis
tened to my sister say a lot of
things in Hebrew about how we
actually did kill Christ and all,
and everyone wore those cute lit
tle beanie things specially made
with my sister's name printed on
the inside. But every time they
opened up the ark to get the
Torah, I had this weird urge to
turn my head away in case every
one's skin got melted down or
something.
Anyway, after about an hour
and a half, my sister did a little
speech about how wonderful it
felt finally to be a part of the Jew
ish community, gave Rabbi Can
ter and Cantor Rabinowitz a kiss
and sidestepped her way out of
God's sepulcher and into U.S.
Government bond heaven.
And as I sat at the party after
ward, listening to the band play
"Groove is in the Heart" and
"September Morn" so similarly
that I couldn't tell the difference,
I realized something.
I realized that even though
there was a 10-foot-by-20-foot,
cardboard-and-mylar sign above

my sister's head spelling out the
words "Lisa on Broadway," some
of my sister's 13-year-old friends
weren't that bad looking.
I also realized that even
though this was one of the tacki
er, more disgusting uses of money
I had ever been a part of, there
was something really nice about it
all.
And even though I may not
think all my family members are
the coolest or classiest people I've
ever met, and even if I'm not all
that close to all of them, there's
something kind of neat about the
fact that they're my family and
they'll always be there for me.
Gosh, I remember my sister
when we used to roll her up in
blankets and throw her down the
stairs. Now she wears dresses and
I can talk to her on the phone like
she was a real person or some
thing.
I will kill the first guy who
tries to date her.

Joel Stein wishes people would
stop opening their windows and
yelling "Egoiste! Egoiste!" so he
can finally get a decent night's
sleep. His column appears
biweekly, so his short-haired,
lame-witted alter-ego, Chris Har
ris, can vent his frustrations.
