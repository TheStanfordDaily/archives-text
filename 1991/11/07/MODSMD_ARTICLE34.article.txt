# Students try their hands at improvisational theater

Journey, if you will, into a new dimension of time

and energy". A dimension where ordinary people and

objects aren't what they seem; where mere observation is
implausible; where lunacy is a necessity; where the official
language is Gibberish.
Journey into the dimension of Spontaneous Generation.
However, don't bring anything more than an open mind.
For everything else, you just improvise.
Improvising is what Spontaneous Generation is all about.

A branch of Ram's Head Theatrical Soci-

ety, Spontaneous Generation
works toward understanding

and perfecting the skills of

improvisation.

"Our goal is to enjoy our-

selves and discover the

art of improv," said

Spontaneous Gen
eration director

Jason Dell, a sophomore. It is that
discovery and enjoyment that sets

Spontaneous Generation apart from any other

organization at Stanford.
According to junior Tad Glauthier, Spontaneous Generation is
"sipooramatical," a word he invented to mean: "It's super, great
and fun. You come and you laugh for two hours straight, and
hopefully you make other people in the group laugh It's a fun
sport."
Humor is one of the intents of Spontaneous Generation, which
was founded by a group of interested Ram's Head members last
year. Co-founder Karen Horwitz was involved with Ram's Head
as a freshman but thought there was a need for comedy, some
thing informal and "very spontaneous." So she started the group
with Ram's Head member and Gaieties director Raphe Beck.
Where did the name come from? According to Beck, "I don't
have a good story.... I've always wanted to be in a group with
that name." Thus, it was dubbed.
There are two key phrases used by Spontaneous Generation
that can best describe the group: "Let's play a game" and "Go
with it." Game playing is what each weekly meeting con-

sists of.
Games like the Incredible
Growing and Shrinking Machine,
Murder Endowment, Slide Show,
the Dubbing Game and Gibberish
Reunion involve miming, on
your-feet thinking and a quick
imagination. And we can't forget
a thorough knowledge of the lan
guage of Gibberish.
Gibberish is exactly what it
sounds like: talking using any
sounds except actual words. Gib
berish could best be put to use in
a translating game that is played
with three people.
Two of the three people speak
to each other in gibberish — but
neither of them can understand
each other. The third participant
tries to translate the conversation
for the others in the game and the
audience. All, of course, in gibber
ish.
Such a game presents interest
ing results. One person translated
"Ooga mooga moo ooga mooga"
as "My life and your life are inter
twined." Another told the story of
a farmer who irresponsibly let his
sheep wander on a road.

There are games that do allow
English to be spoken. The game
Yes!, for example, includes a per
son making a suggestion and the
group answering "Yes!" and
doing it. Similarly, a resounding
"Yes!" boomed throughout the
room as this reporter was sur
rounded, poked, picked up (while
sitting at a desk), prayed to and
made to play out the rest of the
game.
These gantes are not, of course,
without rules.
One of the major rules the
actors must follow is not to
"block."
"The easiest way to under
stand blocking is to never say no
to a question," Dell said. This
reflects the "go-with-it" attitude
of improvisation. Whatever hap
pens to arise in the situation that
you find yourself in, you have to
act on that and see where the
scene leads.
Humor is often the result,
whe the title of a haiku poem is
written by a group of people
adding one syllable a piece: "By
Incest Proud." Or when the final
portion of a letter is written one
word at a time: "In case I
haven't mentioned that my dog
has gonorrhea, I gave it to him.
With loving regards, your Con

gressman."
And how do Spontaneous Gen
eration members stay in line? The
bag. If an actor or an audience
member does something or asks
something rude or crude, he or
she must wear a paper bag and
must justify wearing it in whatev
er scene arises.
All of these games are played in
the name of improvisation, a topic
that Spontaneous Generation
members all enjoy in and of itself.
"Improv is having your pants
down in front of other people,"
Glauthier said. "It's allowing
yourself to be up on stage telling a
story . . . and really allowing
someone to give you an idea, and
you just accept it 100 percent and
go with it."
He went on to talk about
endowment, an improv term for
the audience or another actor giv
ing you a characteristic that, in
the name of not blocking, you
must accept.
He said someone could say to
you " 'Gee, Bob, I've noticed that
your mouth is taped shut.' You
have to take it and do what you
»
can.
"Improv is a funner way to
live," he added. "You can do it in a
lot of places besides here (Sponta
neous Generation)."

objects aren't what they seem; where mere observation is
implausible; where lunacy is a necessity; where the official

Journey, if you will, into a new dimension of time

and energy". A dimension where ordinary people and

objects aren't what they seem; where mere observation is
implausible; where lunacy is a necessity; where the official
language is Gibberish.
Journey into the dimension of Spontaneous Generation.
However, don't bring anything more than an open mind.
For everything else, you just improvise.
Improvising is what Spontaneous Generation is all about.

A branch of Ram's Head Theatrical Soci-

ety, Spontaneous Generation
works toward understanding

and perfecting the skills of

improvisation.

"Our goal is to enjoy our-

selves and discover the

art of improv," said

Spontaneous Gen
eration director

Jason Dell, a sophomore. It is that
discovery and enjoyment that sets

Spontaneous Generation apart from any other

organization at Stanford.
According to junior Tad Glauthier, Spontaneous Generation is
"sipooramatical," a word he invented to mean: "It's super, great
and fun. You come and you laugh for two hours straight, and
hopefully you make other people in the group laugh It's a fun
sport."
Humor is one of the intents of Spontaneous Generation, which
was founded by a group of interested Ram's Head members last
year. Co-founder Karen Horwitz was involved with Ram's Head
as a freshman but thought there was a need for comedy, some
thing informal and "very spontaneous." So she started the group
with Ram's Head member and Gaieties director Raphe Beck.
Where did the name come from? According to Beck, "I don't
have a good story.... I've always wanted to be in a group with
that name." Thus, it was dubbed.
There are two key phrases used by Spontaneous Generation
that can best describe the group: "Let's play a game" and "Go
with it." Game playing is what each weekly meeting con-

sists of.
Games like the Incredible
Growing and Shrinking Machine,
Murder Endowment, Slide Show,
the Dubbing Game and Gibberish
Reunion involve miming, on
your-feet thinking and a quick
imagination. And we can't forget
a thorough knowledge of the lan
guage of Gibberish.
Gibberish is exactly what it
sounds like: talking using any
sounds except actual words. Gib
berish could best be put to use in
a translating game that is played
with three people.
Two of the three people speak
to each other in gibberish — but
neither of them can understand
each other. The third participant
tries to translate the conversation
for the others in the game and the
audience. All, of course, in gibber
ish.
Such a game presents interest
ing results. One person translated
"Ooga mooga moo ooga mooga"
as "My life and your life are inter
twined." Another told the story of
a farmer who irresponsibly let his
sheep wander on a road.

There are games that do allow
English to be spoken. The game
Yes!, for example, includes a per
son making a suggestion and the
group answering "Yes!" and
doing it. Similarly, a resounding
"Yes!" boomed throughout the
room as this reporter was sur
rounded, poked, picked up (while
sitting at a desk), prayed to and
made to play out the rest of the
game.
These gantes are not, of course,
without rules.
One of the major rules the
actors must follow is not to
"block."
"The easiest way to under
stand blocking is to never say no
to a question," Dell said. This
reflects the "go-with-it" attitude
of improvisation. Whatever hap
pens to arise in the situation that
you find yourself in, you have to
act on that and see where the
scene leads.
Humor is often the result,
whe the title of a haiku poem is
written by a group of people
adding one syllable a piece: "By
Incest Proud." Or when the final
portion of a letter is written one
word at a time: "In case I
haven't mentioned that my dog
has gonorrhea, I gave it to him.
With loving regards, your Con

gressman."
And how do Spontaneous Gen
eration members stay in line? The
bag. If an actor or an audience
member does something or asks
something rude or crude, he or
she must wear a paper bag and
must justify wearing it in whatev
er scene arises.
All of these games are played in
the name of improvisation, a topic
that Spontaneous Generation
members all enjoy in and of itself.
"Improv is having your pants
down in front of other people,"
Glauthier said. "It's allowing
yourself to be up on stage telling a
story . . . and really allowing
someone to give you an idea, and
you just accept it 100 percent and
go with it."
He went on to talk about
endowment, an improv term for
the audience or another actor giv
ing you a characteristic that, in
the name of not blocking, you
must accept.
He said someone could say to
you " 'Gee, Bob, I've noticed that
your mouth is taped shut.' You
have to take it and do what you

can.
"Improv is a funner way to
live," he added. "You can do it in a
lot of places besides here (Sponta
