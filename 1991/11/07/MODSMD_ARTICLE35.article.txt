# Noon rally to include music, dance, drama

### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Worried that the looming
budget cuts will slice away the
performing arts at Stanford? Or
just in the mood for a great
show?
Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety is sponsoring a rally for the
performing arts to protest the
possible elimination of the per
forming arts at Stanford, but
mainly, drama graduate student
Lance Miller said, to put on a
good show. The rally will be
today at noon in White Plaza.
"The emphasis is on enter
tainment," Miller said, "not
rhetoric."
There will be about a 10-
minute section near the end
where departments and their
associated groups will be able to
speak their piece, Miller said,
adding it would be "brief."
Dance groups such as El Bal
let Folklorico de Stanford and

the Kuumba Dance Ensemble
will be performing along with all
six a cappella groups. Appear
ances will also be made by the
Big Game Gaieties cast, the
Stanford Improvisors, the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band and a com
bined choral singing group.
"Part of our purpose is to cel
ebrate what we do," Miller said.
"The other part is to call atten
tion to the threat of the cuts on
the performing arts."
The goal of gaining attention
and support "seems to be work
ing," Miller said. He cited media
interest in the upcoming event
from throughout the Bay Area.
The show kicks off at 11:55
a.m. when the Band leads a
parade up to White Plaza from
the circle between Hoover Tower
and Memorial Auditorium.
Anyone interested in partici
pating in the parade should meet
in that circle at 11:45, Miller said.
The Gaieties cast will begin

the rally with one of their pro
duction numbers and will be fol
lowed by one of the a cappella
groups. The remaining a cappella
performances will be spread out
between each of the other perfor
mances in order to allow the
other groups time to set up,
Miller said.
He warned, however, that the
schedule was not fully set and
that some changes may take
Ballet Folklorico, the Chi
cano/Latino dance group, and
Kuumba, the African dance
group, will then each perform a
separate dance number.
The Stanford Improvisors will
then do one of their theater
games. Normally, according to
Miller, they interact with the
audience, ask for a situation and
improvise from it. However, due
to time restrictions, the group
will play a game where they
improvise off each other.
Usually, Miller said, the group

is "very humorous."
Toward the end of the show, a
combined choral singing group
will perform the Stanford hymn.
Members from Stanford Savo
yards, the Stanford Chorale and
other voices from the Music
Department will combine to form
the group.
The Symphonic Band will
close the show with an "upbeat
number," Miller said.
Other groups will be present
along the sidelines, he added. A
group of art students will bring a
banner and pens so that people
"can write and draw their feel
ings about the cuts," Miller said.
Audience members are
encouraged to wear red ribbons
on their arms to show support for
the performing arts. Organizers
will try to provide ribbons at the
event, Miller said.
The master of ceremonies for
the event will be Rob Robinson,
the chair of the German Depart
ment.
