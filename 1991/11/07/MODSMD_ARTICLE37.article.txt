## Stanford graduate publishes stories 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
When Marianne Villanueva
penned a short story, "The Spe
cial Research Project," as part of
her 1983 application to Stanford's
graduate program in creative
writing, she never expected to see
her eight-page "kernel" in print.
But "The Special Research
Project" is now one of 11 works in
"Ginseng and Other Tales From
Manila," Villanueva's recent
anthology of stories inspired by
the people, politics and traditions
of her native Philippines.
Villanueva's "tales" borrow
their surreal elements and alle
gorical style from traditional Fil
ipino folklore. The anthology
includes a glossary of Tagalog
words, designed to make the tales
accessible to readers from all cul
tures.
"Most of the stories were origi
nally written for the other people
in the creative writing program,
who were all Americans," Vil
lanueva explains. "But I knew as I
was writing them that I was also
writing them for Filipinos, who
don't have as much access to
books."
A,cheaper edition of "Ginseng"
was recently published in Vil
lanueva's homeland to both
acclaim and criticism. Because
the author has spent the past 10
years in America, her "right to
write" about life in the Philip
pines has been the subject of
much controversy.

Though Villanueva expected
this controversy, she also resents
it.
"To me, my home is still the
Philippines," she says."The fact
that I'm here in America actually
enabled me to write about life
back home because the concept of
privacy is not as strong there. If I
was back home, I'd be writing
about people who lived next door
to me."
But Villanueva admits her
tales are not entirely autobio
graphical.
"Some of them are about
things I've experienced, but oth
ers are about things I've seen or
imagined," she says.
One of Villanueva's most fan
tastic tales, "Siko," was included
in"The Forbidden Stitch," a 1989
anthology of works by Asian-
American women. It was through
this anthology that the Filipina
author attracted the attention of
"Ginseng" publisher Calyx
Books.
"Calyx has a reputation for
being a feminist press, and I was
surprised that they decided to
publish me," Villanueva admits.
"Of course, I am a woman, and
my point of view is different from
a man's, but the primary thrust
of my writing has been to write
about my country."
Villanueva, who received her
master's in East Asian studies
from Stanford, is currently the
project coordinator for the Stan
ford East Asia Research National
Research Center.
