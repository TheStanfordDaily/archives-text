# Newer, better, PCer dictionary arrives

Students, beware.
The people at Random House have baited
their new college dictionary with such mouthy
morsels as "sniglet," "wannabe," "ditz," "doo
fus," "dweeb" and, above all, that great
twinkie of the decade, "political correctness."
Illin' to the max, dude! (That's all in there,
too. "Twinkie" isn't, thank God.)
In addition to the basic requirement of fit
ting into your backpack, the Random House
Webster's College Dictionary promises to
meet the collegiate criteria (or is it criterions?
The dictionary stays neutral like Switzerland
on that one) of comprehensiveness, timeliness
and the inclusion of helpful usage guidelines.
But folks — that ain't what it delivers.
We are allowed to say "ain't," by the way.
While Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictio
nary, vintage 1983, labels "ain't" as "substan
dard," Random House Webster's prefers to
call it "nonstandard" — Switzerland again.
This new dictionary, barely out of diapers
since its publication this May, is timid when it
comes to taking a stand. And sneaky.
Whatever its name suggests, the Random
House Webster's College Dictionary is not
published by Merriam-Webster's, the people
who put out Webster's Ninth. Random House
wants you to think it is, though: They shame
lessly copy the size, dust jacket and red-red
color of Webster's Ninth.
Noah Webster, America's number-one
word man, would have an underground con
niption fit if he knew that nowadays anyone
has the right to slap his name on a bundle of
words and call it a dictionary. The new Ran
dom House is no more "Webster's" than your
next CIV paper. But it's all legal.
It's true that this nefarious tome has 20,000
more entries and 200 more illustrations than
your old buddy Webster's Ninth. But it falls
short in its other claims, like timeliness.
Random House Webster's is so up-to-date
that it's already out-of-date. It describes a re
unified Germany, but not a de-unified Soviet
bloc. It lists David Souter, but not Clarence
Thomas.
It cannot be a dictionary of the '90s
because the decade has just begun. And any
dictionary truly designed for students would
take into account that we can't afford to buy a
new one every time a country the size of

ber-one word man, would have

Rhode Island changes its name. Leave this
year's facts to the almanac.
And leave this year's fads to GQ. Our kids
will have no more interest in our acid-washed
(included in Random House Webster's) jeans
than we have in our parents' Nehru collars
(not included). And, with any luck, J. Dan
forth Quayle (included) will soon sit next to
Schuyler Colfax (not included), collecting dust
on that shelf where they keep all the forgotten
veeps with funny names.
Eager to include all the useless information
it can, Random House Webster's cautions
expansively that a (wo)man runs the risk of
having his-her head bitten off if s/he uses the
masculine singular when heorshe could
instead express [her/himlself with some
ungrammatical, unpronounceable politically
correct alternative.
Speaking of wom(e/y]n, let's take a look at
a typically bloated definition. This comes from
the synonym note at the end of "female."
"FEMALE, FEMININE, EFFEMINATE
describe women (where's the "y," scribes and
pharisees, hypocrites?) and girls or whatever
is culturally attributed to them... . FEMININE
refers to qualities and behavior deemed . ..
appropriate to or ideally associated with women
and girls.
"In American and Western European cul
ture, these have traditionally included such
features as charm, gentleness and patience....
EFFEMINATE is most often applied deroga
torily to men or boys, suggesting they have
traits culturally regarded as appropriate to
women and girls rather than to men."
I am so happy I belong to this oppressed
minority group because I have the privilege,
unlike my privileged male counterparts, of
not being called sexist. So I can say in femi
nine honesty that this usage note sucks.

Dripping "culturally" all over a definition
like steak sauce on a rotten hunk of beef
would be ridiculous even if it didn't waste pre
cious space in this smaller-than-a-broiler dic
tionary. What is language if not cultural?
What is our culture if not American and West
ern European?
What are our brains for if not to distin
guish between what is "ideal" or "tradition
al," and what is actually true? Nobody but


Amey Mathews — Daily
Wonder Bread myn would be silly
enough to write such a wack (look
it up) definition, since they're the
only ones who believe what they

read in the first place.
But let's leave gender issues,
refined carbohydrates and red
meat aside. Physics majors will
have figured out by now that this
dictionary either defies some
basic principles of matter or isn't
telling us something.
Words, gassy as they seem at
times, can't be compressed with

out making us all go blind. When
you have more words, wordier
definitions and the same little
space, something has to give. In
this case, it's detailed, precise def
initions: Random House pays
more attention to the protocol of
words than to their meanings.
If empty statistics and empti
er PC fascists favor Random

House Webster's, common
sense says "dis!" (Random
House lists three definitions for
this word even though no one
seriously uses it.) What your
$20 is paying for, besides those
neat-o alphabet thumb-holes, is
"airkiss" to "zone out," with
paperback-quality definitions in
between.
