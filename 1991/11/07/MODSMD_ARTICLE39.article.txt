## 'Bathgate' lacks bite, but beats bowling 
### Mike Curry 
Bland. Boring. "Billy Bath
gate."
Based on the best-selling book
by E.L. Doctorow, "Bathgate" has
the blueprint for a commercial
blockbuster: a bonanza of big
name stars, a gangster tale and a
bright director, Robert Benton
("Superman," "Kramer vs.
Kramer").
Yet despite these blockbuster
building blocks in Benton's film,
"Bathgate" lacks bite.
Set in New York in the 19305,
"Bathgate" is built on the story of
a Bronx boy named Billy Bath
gate (Loren Dean) who breaks
into an Irish Mob built by Dutch
Schultz (Dustin Hoffman). Bath
gate becomes Schultz's appren
tice and as part of the bargain he
must protect his boss' bewitching
blonde beauty, Drew Preston
(Nicole Kidman).
The gifted Hoffman's perfor
mance as the the brooding and
sometimes brutal mob boss
Schultz is basically good, but it is

not going to bring him a third
golden Oscar for best actor.
On the opposite band of the
acting spectrum is Bruce Willis'
poor portrayal of Bo Weinburg,
one of Schultz's "boys" who
betrays him. In what is supposed
to be one of the film's strongest
scenes, Bruce fails to be believable
as the terrified Bo who is about to
be tossed off a tugboat with his
boots in a barrel of solidified
cement.
Basically "Bathgate" is a nice,
mind-numbing, popcorn-munch
ing movie in which neither the
story, the acting, the music, nor
the cinematography is exception
al.
When weighed with "Godfa
ther III," "Goodfellas,""The
Untouchables" and other recent
mob movies, "Bathgate" is blush
ingly below the rest and lacks the
suspense that these blockbusters
share.
Film buffs should wait for
"Bathgate" at Blockbuster.

Curry's Quick Score: "B-"

Playing tough-nosed Irish gangster Dutch Schultz, Dustin Hoffman
nearly loses his cigarette trying to say the line: "Yeah. Definitely
going to bury him at the bottom of the river."
