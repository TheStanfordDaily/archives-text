# Threatened programs muster support from profs, students

Although today's rally in White Plaza
will focus on the performing arts, other
less-visible programs are also on the
chopping block in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
Innovative Academic Courses,
Humanities Special Programs and the
programs in Design, Urban Studies and
Photography are also being considered
for significant reductions or elimination.
Although people within the school
emphasize that no permanent decisions
have been made, faculty and students are

working to show support for their pro
grams while speculating where cuts
might come from.
"As far as I am concerned, nothing has
been decided firmly," said Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Leonard Ortolano, director of
the Urban Studies Program. "We are in
the process of providing information to
the dean's office and encouraging alumni
and students to speak out."
At their quarterly lunch yesterday,
students majoring in urban studies dis
cussed how to respond to the targeting of
their department.
"We won't be doing rallies, and we
won't attract huge numbers of people,"

senior Sarah Bernstein said before the
meeting. "But we will have mobilization
from people within the major."
About 15 students supporting the
joint graduate design program also met
last night to plan a strategy for protesting
potential cuts in the Art Department por
tion of the program. The students are
considering possible ways of voicing their
opinions, including writing letters to the
dean's office.
Several members of the targeted
departments questioned the value of cut
ting their programs because they have
few costs.
"Relative to the $5-million target in

Humanities and Sciences, we are a very
small percent," said Mar go Horn, direc
tor of Innovative Academic Courses.
The program offers about 50 courses
per year at a cost of about $1,000 per
course, she said.
Art Prof. Matt Kahn, the only tenured
faculty member teaching design, said the
budget for design "is so miniscule that it is
an embarrassment. We are a finely honed
program that has no fat left to trim."
Kahn said there is a tenure-track fac
ulty position in design that has remained
unfilled and he fears design "will get pun
ished for that."
Because tenured faculty cannot be

fired, Kahn, 63, suggested that the Uni
versity might eliminate design and wait
for him to retire. Photography has no
tenured faculty.
Ortolano said the costs of the Urban
Studies Program make it a constant tar
get for reductions. Every time the pro
gram is reviewed, the Faculty Senate
questions the cost of outside lecturers
hired to teach in it, he added.
"But we feel that it is good to expose
undergraduates to professionals in urban
design and urban planning," Ortolano
said. "We hire the outside professionals
