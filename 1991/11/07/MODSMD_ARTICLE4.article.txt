# Threatened programs muster support from profs, students
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Although today's rally in White Plaza
will focus on the performing arts, other
less-visible programs are also on the
chopping block in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
Innovative Academic Courses,
Humanities Special Programs and the
programs in Design, Urban Studies and
Photography are also being considered
for significant reductions or elimination.
Although people within the school
emphasize that no permanent decisions
have been made, faculty and students are

working to show support for their pro
grams while speculating where cuts
might come from.
"As far as I am concerned, nothing has
been decided firmly," said Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Leonard Ortolano, director of
the Urban Studies Program. "We are in
the process of providing information to
the dean's office and encouraging alumni
and students to speak out."
At their quarterly lunch yesterday,
students majoring in urban studies dis
cussed how to respond to the targeting of
their department.
"We won't be doing rallies, and we
won't attract huge numbers of people,"

senior Sarah Bernstein said before the
meeting. "But we will have mobilization
from people within the major."
About 15 students supporting the
joint graduate design program also met
last night to plan a strategy for protesting
potential cuts in the Art Department por
tion of the program. The students are
considering possible ways of voicing their
opinions, including writing letters to the
dean's office.
Several members of the targeted
departments questioned the value of cut
ting their programs because they have
few costs.
"Relative to the $5-million target in

Humanities and Sciences, we are a very
small percent," said Mar go Horn, direc
tor of Innovative Academic Courses.
The program offers about 50 courses
per year at a cost of about $1,000 per
course, she said.
Art Prof. Matt Kahn, the only tenured
faculty member teaching design, said the
budget for design "is so miniscule that it is
an embarrassment. We are a finely honed
program that has no fat left to trim."
Kahn said there is a tenure-track fac
ulty position in design that has remained
unfilled and he fears design "will get pun
ished for that."
Because tenured faculty cannot be

fired, Kahn, 63, suggested that the Uni
versity might eliminate design and wait
for him to retire. Photography has no
tenured faculty.
Ortolano said the costs of the Urban
Studies Program make it a constant tar
get for reductions. Every time the pro
gram is reviewed, the Faculty Senate
questions the cost of outside lecturers
hired to teach in it, he added.
"But we feel that it is good to expose
undergraduates to professionals in urban
design and urban planning," Ortolano
said. "We hire the outside professionals
as enrichment.
"We could reorganize the pro
gram to be taught exclusively by
tenured Stanford faculty, but it
would be less hands-on," he added.
From a student perspective,
such a change would hurt the qual
ity of the program, Bernstein said.
"The lecturers are practicing
professionals in the area who are
very in touch with current issues
in the outside world. . . . The
tenured faculty do not have the
same level of experience," she said.
When Provost James Rosse
announced the budget-reduction
target for the schools last month,
he said he wished to avoid having
one school cut a program that is
essential to another school —
forcing the other school to replace
the program and increase costs.
But many faculty and students
in product design said the deci
sion by Humanities and Sciences
to target design will cause exactly
that problem.
The graduate program in
design is jointly run by the Art and
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ments. The departments offer sep
arate undergraduate degrees, but
graduate students can only enroll
in the joint program.
"It is a very unusual interdisci
plinary program," said Engineer
ing Prof. Rolf Faste, one of two
engineering professors involved
in the program. "It synthesizes
art and engineering in a very
unique way that many other

schools have tried to duplicate.
"But getting the art side has
always been a problem, and the
possibility of visual design being
eliminated in the Art Department
is very troubling," Faste added.
Without the strong art compo
nent, the program "would be a
very different beast."
Students in design agreed that
the nature of the program would
undergo significant changes if
Humanities and Sciences elimi
nates design.
"If you eliminated half of the
program, the program then
becomes pointless," said Peter
Mac Donald, a second-year gradu
ate student in design. "We might
as well just have an engineering
program."
Steve Holt, also a second-year
graduate student, said Stanford
was his only choice for graduate
work in product design because
its program integrated engineer
ing and art. With only engineer
ing, he "would have looked more
seriously overseas."
Faste said engineering would
be forced to "pick up the program
in some way, but that won't solve
it. Visual art has a point of view
that we cannot sustain within
engineering."
Several students in design said
there have been persistent rumors
that design will likely be eliminat
ed within the Art Department.
Humanities Special Programs,
which includes the undergradu
ate humanities honors programs
and a joint doctorate program, is
not likely to be eliminated,
according to chair Paul Robinson.
But the program may be forced

to make limited budget cuts,
Robinson said, adding that the
current system of "buy-outs"
would likely be abolished. The
program pays departments to
allow professors to teach a course
within the program instead of
their own department.
"It would require me to do
more arm-twisting and be more
charming" in convincing depart
ments to allow their professors to
teach within Humanities Special
Programs, Robinson said. "We
would be at the mercy of the good
will of other departments."
Robinson, however, remains

optimistic. "I could be wrong, but
I don't anticipate the program
being fundamentally changed,"
he said.
But English Prof. Herbert Lin
denberger, a member of the pro
gram's advisory committee, said
it "could be a real problem if you
don't have buy-outs because of
the shortage of faculty through
out the University.
"It is getting harder and hard
er to borrow people from their
home departments to teach in
something else because many of
the departments are so thin," Lin
denberger said.

and a joint doctorate program, is
not likely to be eliminated,
according to chair Paul Robinson.
But the program may be forced

to make limited budget cuts,
Robinson said, adding that the
current system of "buy-outs"
would likely be abolished. The
program pays departments to
allow professors to teach a course
within the program instead of
their own department.
"It would require me to do
more arm-twisting and be more
charming" in convincing depart
ments to allow their professors to
teach within Humanities Special
Programs, Robinson said. "We
would be at the mercy of the good
will of other departments."
Robinson, however, remains

optimistic. "I could be wrong, but
I don't anticipate the program
being fundamentally changed,"
he said.
But English Prof. Herbert Lin
denberger, a member of the pro
gram's advisory committee, said
it "could be a real problem if you
don't have buy-outs because of
the shortage of faculty through
out the University.
"It is getting harder and hard
er to borrow people from their
home departments to teach in
something else because many of
the departments are so thin," Lin
denberger said.

Fearful lest budget cuts dismantle their program, design students
gather in the design loft to devise a plan of action to keep the inter
disciplinary program intact.
Although today's rally in White Plaza
will focus on the performing arts, other
less-visible programs are also on the
chopping block in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
Innovative Academic Courses,
Humanities Special Programs and the
programs in Design, Urban Studies and
Photography are also being considered
for significant reductions or elimination.
Although people within the school
emphasize that no permanent decisions
have been made, faculty and students are

working to show support for their pro
grams while speculating where cuts
might come from.
"As far as I am concerned, nothing has
been decided firmly," said Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Leonard Ortolano, director of
the Urban Studies Program. "We are in
the process of providing information to
the dean's office and encouraging alumni
and students to speak out."
At their quarterly lunch yesterday,
students majoring in urban studies dis
cussed how to respond to the targeting of
their department.
"We won't be doing rallies, and we
won't attract huge numbers of people,"

senior Sarah Bernstein said before the
meeting. "But we will have mobilization
from people within the major."
About 15 students supporting the
joint graduate design program also met
last night to plan a strategy for protesting
potential cuts in the Art Department por
tion of the program. The students are
considering possible ways of voicing their
opinions, including writing letters to the
dean's office.
Several members of the targeted
departments questioned the value of cut
ting their programs because they have
few costs.
"Relative to the $5-million target in

Humanities and Sciences, we are a very
small percent," said Mar go Horn, direc
tor of Innovative Academic Courses.
The program offers about 50 courses
per year at a cost of about $1,000 per
course, she said.
Art Prof. Matt Kahn, the only tenured
faculty member teaching design, said the
budget for design "is so miniscule that it is
an embarrassment. We are a finely honed
program that has no fat left to trim."
Kahn said there is a tenure-track fac
ulty position in design that has remained
unfilled and he fears design "will get pun
ished for that."
Because tenured faculty cannot be

fired, Kahn, 63, suggested that the Uni
versity might eliminate design and wait
for him to retire. Photography has no
tenured faculty.
Ortolano said the costs of the Urban
Studies Program make it a constant tar
get for reductions. Every time the pro
gram is reviewed, the Faculty Senate
questions the cost of outside lecturers
hired to teach in it, he added.
"But we feel that it is good to expose
undergraduates to professionals in urban
design and urban planning," Ortolano
said. "We hire the outside professionals
as enrichment.
"We could reorganize the pro
gram to be taught exclusively by
tenured Stanford faculty, but it
would be less hands-on," he added.
From a student perspective,
such a change would hurt the qual
ity of the program, Bernstein said.
"The lecturers are practicing
professionals in the area who are
very in touch with current issues
in the outside world. . . . The
tenured faculty do not have the
same level of experience," she said.
When Provost James Rosse
announced the budget-reduction
target for the schools last month,
he said he wished to avoid having
one school cut a program that is
essential to another school —
forcing the other school to replace
the program and increase costs.
But many faculty and students
in product design said the deci
sion by Humanities and Sciences
to target design will cause exactly
that problem.
The graduate program in
design is jointly run by the Art and
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ments. The departments offer sep
arate undergraduate degrees, but
graduate students can only enroll
in the joint program.
"It is a very unusual interdisci
plinary program," said Engineer
ing Prof. Rolf Faste, one of two
engineering professors involved
in the program. "It synthesizes
art and engineering in a very
unique way that many other

schools have tried to duplicate.
"But getting the art side has
always been a problem, and the
possibility of visual design being
eliminated in the Art Department
is very troubling," Faste added.
Without the strong art compo
nent, the program "would be a
very different beast."
Students in design agreed that
the nature of the program would
undergo significant changes if
Humanities and Sciences elimi
nates design.
"If you eliminated half of the
program, the program then
becomes pointless," said Peter
Mac Donald, a second-year gradu
ate student in design. "We might
as well just have an engineering
program."
Steve Holt, also a second-year
graduate student, said Stanford
was his only choice for graduate
work in product design because
its program integrated engineer
ing and art. With only engineer
ing, he "would have looked more
seriously overseas."
Faste said engineering would
be forced to "pick up the program
in some way, but that won't solve
it. Visual art has a point of view
that we cannot sustain within
engineering."
Several students in design said
there have been persistent rumors
that design will likely be eliminat
ed within the Art Department.
Humanities Special Programs,
which includes the undergradu
ate humanities honors programs
and a joint doctorate program, is
not likely to be eliminated,
according to chair Paul Robinson.
