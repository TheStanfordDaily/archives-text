# 'Gone With the Wind' comes back to town
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
It's almost embarrassing to rave about a
film whose status as a classic has been con
firmed again and again for over 50 years.
But "Gone With the Wind," the 1939 mas
terpiece now playing at the Stanford Theatre,
deserves every ounce of praise it's gotten. Few
films have ever achieved this level of
grandeur and excellence, and quite frankly,
few films ever will.
While some may find it difficult to put
aside the ethical question of romanticizing a
society based on slavery, "Gone With the
Wind" offers richness and color at every level,
from its flamboyant characters to its lush cin
ematography to its sumptuous costuming.
The film depicts the crumbling of the
southern aristocracy during the Civil War by
focusing on the life of Scarlett O'Hara, one of

the most famous movie heroines. Vivien
Leigh's portrayal of the tempestuous south
ern belle deservedly earned her an Oscar, and
she somehow manages to bring complexity
and depth to what could have been a horribly
superficial character.
Clark Gable stars as Rhett Butler, the con
summate scoundrel who woos Scarlett, and
Hattie McDaniel's Mammy, the rock-solid
and loyal slave who runs the O'Hara house
hold, brings dignity to a film replete with
superficial black characters.
But most likely, the real star of "Gone
With the Wind" is the panoramic view of the
Old South. From luxurious landscapes of
Tara, the O'Hara family home, to the stun
ning depiction of the burning of Atlanta, the
cinematography defies belief — especially
when you remind yourself this film was
made in 1939, when color was a brand-new
technology.

Truly an epic, the film clocks in at well over
three hours, making it difficult to catch the
once-a-night screenings (with an added mati
nee on Saturday and Sunday). But finding the
time is well worth it.
Even if you've seen it on television or
videotape many times before, nothing com
pares to seeing Margaret Mitchell's tale of the
Old South in all of its full screen, Technicolor
glory — in a bona fide movie palace like the
Stanford Theatre, where the "mighty Wurl
itzer organ" plays every night before the film
and during intermission. It's a rare treat that
deserves not to be missed.

"Gone With the Wind"plays through Nov. 14
at the Stanford Theatre, 221 University Ave.,
Palo Alto. Showtimes are 7:30 nightly, with a
2 p.m. matinee on Saturday and Sunday.
Admission is $5. Call 324-3700 for more infor
mation.
