# Beverly Hills 90210 isn't all that dumb
## 
### Mathew Dresden 
It's tempting to have an opin
ion on a subject you know nothing
about if most people seem to con
cur with it. Did you actually have
to listen to an entire Andrew Dice
Clay routine before forming an
opinion about him? Probably not.
And just think: How much Wayne
Newton have you actually lis
tened to?
In keeping with that train of
thought, I am about to say some
thing that may be misunderstood
by many people, namely, that I
like to watch "Beverly Hills,
90210." A lot.
Those of you who have never
seen an episode are probably
turning away in disgust, and
quite frankly, I can't say I blame
you. If I had read the above words
last year at this time, I would
have stopped reading. But that's
exactly my point; I had never seen
it, but yet I held it in the lowest
regard. So if you're still with me,
hear me out.
I won't, in fact can't, say
"90210" is a good show because it
isn't. In fact, I can't really explain
its appeal. All I can say is that it's
bad, but it's good. If you watch
just one episode, then you'll know
what I mean. It's totally hypnotic.
For starters, the acting in
"90210" is quite good. Shannen
Doherty, who played Heather
Duke in "Heathers," and Jason
Priestley (Brenda and Brandon
Walsh, respectively) do a fine job
as the fraternal twins transplant
ed from Minnesota to the plush,
garish atmosphere of West Bever
ly Hills High School.
Jennie Garth (Kelly), Gabrielle
Carteris (Andrea) and lan Ziering
(Steve) are excellent in support
ing roles. Analyzing the perfor
mance of Luke Perry (Dylan) is a
little more difficult. Although
he's a decent actor (especially
excelling at raspy-whisper speak
ing and you-just-don't-under
stand-me expressions), he also
shows every one of his 25 years
and sticks out like a sore thumb
on a high-school campus.
Tori Spelling (as Donna) is
total luggage. There's no doubt in
my mind that if television produc
er Aaron Spelling weren't her
father, she'd be just another Los
Angeles debutante with a nose
job. We're talking Samsonite
here. Same goes for James Eck
house and Carol Potter (Mr. and
Mrs. Walsh). I guess there had to
be some authority figures on the
show.
But enough with the acting:
What really makes "90210"
is the writing. The episodes are so
predictable; the characters are so
petty; the situations are so . . .
high school. And that's what's so

great. To say you can see things
coming a mile away isn't enough:
you can see them light-years
away. You can see them coming
before you turn on the television.
But that's OK because plot
twists aren't why you watch this
show. You watch it for the charac
terizations: They're the backbone
of "90210," and they're what
makes the show so enjoyable. Bren
da is totally immature; Kelly is just
a bitch; Steve is just a self-centered
jerk; Brandon is the quintessential
"nice guy"; and so on.

I am about to say some
thing that may be misun
derstood by many peo
ple, namely, that I like to
watch "Beverly Hills,
90210." A lot.

But I don't mean to say that
they're one-sided characters,
because they're not. They're real;
that is, they really act like high
school students. And they're just
like the people I knew in high
school.
Although the characters are
good enough to induce watching
as often as possible, every once in
a while "90210" gives you some
thing extra — and I'm not even
talking about Luke Perry's ability
to cause a riot in a South Florida
shopping mall. One of the best
examples of this "something
extra' comes from one of last sea
son's episodes —the one dealing
with teenage motherhood.
On this particular episode,
Brandon was going out with a girl
(a senior in high school) who had
a baby named Joey. In one scene
about midway through the show,
Brandon had to baby-sit Joey.
So I was sitting there, watch
ing Brandon have the usual baby
mishaps ("Three Men and a
Baby"-ish diaper dysfunction,
etc.), while in the back of my
mind (I had recently bought Con
crete Blonde's "Bloodletting") I
was singing "Joey, baby. . . ."
Then, not five minutes later as
the scene returned to Brandon
and the baby, what came on as
background music but Concrete
Blonde's "Joey." I was going wild.
"Yes!" I cried and wildly pumped
my fist in the air. "Now this is
what television is all about."
But in the following scene, in
which Brenda and Kelly were
going sky-diving, the background
music was Chris Isaak's "Wicked
Game." From timely to totally
gratuitous in about 30 seconds.
You can't ask for much more than
that.

Then, not five minutes later as
the scene returned to Brandon
and the baby, what came on as
background music but Concrete
Blonde's "Joey." I was going wild.
"Yes!" I cried and wildly pumped
my fist in the air. "Now this is
what television is all about."
But in the following scene, in
which Brenda and Kelly were
going sky-diving, the background
music was Chris Isaak's "Wicked
Game." From timely to totally
gratuitous in about 30 seconds.
You can't ask for much more than
that.
It's tempting to have an opin
ion on a subject you know nothing
about if most people seem to con
cur with it. Did you actually have
to listen to an entire Andrew Dice
Clay routine before forming an
opinion about him? Probably not.
And just think: How much Wayne
Newton have you actually lis
tened to?
In keeping with that train of
thought, I am about to say some
thing that may be misunderstood
by many people, namely, that I
like to watch "Beverly Hills,
90210." A lot.
Those of you who have never
seen an episode are probably
turning away in disgust, and
quite frankly, I can't say I blame
you. If I had read the above words
last year at this time, I would
have stopped reading. But that's
exactly my point; I had never seen
it, but yet I held it in the lowest
regard. So if you're still with me,
hear me out.
I won't, in fact can't, say
"90210" is a good show because it
isn't. In fact, I can't really explain
its appeal. All I can say is that it's
bad, but it's good. If you watch
just one episode, then you'll know
what I mean. It's totally hypnotic.
For starters, the acting in
"90210" is quite good. Shannen
Doherty, who played Heather
Duke in "Heathers," and Jason
Priestley (Brenda and Brandon
Walsh, respectively) do a fine job
as the fraternal twins transplant
ed from Minnesota to the plush,
garish atmosphere of West Bever
ly Hills High School.
Jennie Garth (Kelly), Gabrielle
Carteris (Andrea) and lan Ziering
(Steve) are excellent in support
ing roles. Analyzing the perfor
mance of Luke Perry (Dylan) is a
little more difficult. Although
he's a decent actor (especially
excelling at raspy-whisper speak
ing and you-just-don't-under
stand-me expressions), he also
shows every one of his 25 years
and sticks out like a sore thumb
on a high-school campus.
Tori Spelling (as Donna) is
total luggage. There's no doubt in
my mind that if television produc
er Aaron Spelling weren't her
father, she'd be just another Los
Angeles debutante with a nose
job. We're talking Samsonite
here. Same goes for James Eck
house and Carol Potter (Mr. and
Mrs. Walsh). I guess there had to
be some authority figures on the
show.
But enough with the acting:
What really makes "90210"
is the writing. The episodes are so
predictable; the characters are so
petty; the situations are so . . .
high school. And that's what's so

great. To say you can see things
coming a mile away isn't enough:
you can see them light-years
away. You can see them coming
before you turn on the television.
But that's OK because plot
twists aren't why you watch this
show. You watch it for the charac
terizations: They're the backbone
of "90210," and they're what
makes the show so enjoyable. Bren
da is totally immature; Kelly is just
a bitch; Steve is just a self-centered
jerk; Brandon is the quintessential
"nice guy"; and so on.

I am about to say some
thing that may be misun
derstood by many peo
ple, namely, that I like to
watch "Beverly Hills,
90210." A lot.

But I don't mean to say that
they're one-sided characters,
because they're not. They're real;
that is, they really act like high
school students. And they're just
like the people I knew in high
school.
Although the characters are
good enough to induce watching
as often as possible, every once in
a while "90210" gives you some
thing extra — and I'm not even
talking about Luke Perry's ability
to cause a riot in a South Florida
shopping mall. One of the best
examples of this "something
extra' comes from one of last sea
son's episodes —the one dealing
with teenage motherhood.
On this particular episode,
Brandon was going out with a girl
(a senior in high school) who had
a baby named Joey. In one scene
about midway through the show,
Brandon had to baby-sit Joey.
So I was sitting there, watch
ing Brandon have the usual baby
mishaps ("Three Men and a
Baby"-ish diaper dysfunction,
etc.), while in the back of my
mind (I had recently bought Con
crete Blonde's "Bloodletting") I
was singing "Joey, baby. . . ."
Then, not five minutes later as
the scene returned to Brandon
and the baby, what came on as
background music but Concrete
Blonde's "Joey." I was going wild.
"Yes!" I cried and wildly pumped
my fist in the air. "Now this is
what television is all about."
But in the following scene, in
which Brenda and Kelly were
going sky-diving, the background
music was Chris Isaak's "Wicked
Game." From timely to totally
gratuitous in about 30 seconds.
You can't ask for much more than
that.
