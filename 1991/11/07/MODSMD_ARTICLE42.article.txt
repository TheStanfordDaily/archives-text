## Stepping down from a pretty high chair 
### 
I was standing on my chair on
the Oakland Coliseum infield
waiting for the Rolling Stones
to take the stage.
"Don't stand on you chair,
man," warned my friend.
"Why not?" I asked, knowing
full well that the little sign taped
to my chair told me not to.
"Because Bill will get you," he
said.

I looked out across the neat
rows of folding chairs and at the
50,000 people that filled the large
open-air stadium. Who cares if
I'm standing on the darn chair?
"HEY YOU, GET OFF THAT
CHAIR, NOW!
I looked sheepishly at the
pointed finger of Bill Graham and
his glowering stare, and I hastily
hopped down from my perch. He
turned and marched off, leaving
me feeling like a child caught
stealing candy.
That was Graham in his
essence: a man with overpowering
convictions, who cared deeply
about each individual show he pre
sented — from Live Aid on down
— and who felt no task was too
large or small for his attention.
It was this spirit that was cele
brated by 350,000 at the polo
fields in Golden Gate Park on
Sunday. A few musicians showed
up, too.
Billed as the "Laughter, Love
and Music" show, in memory of
Graham and two associates killed
in a helicopter crash Oct. 25, the
all-day, free concert was a fitting
tribute to a man whose contribu
tion to music was as great as that
of the musicians he booked.
Emerging from the Cypress
trees that surround the oval
shaped fields, I stopped, trans
fixed by the brightly-colored
clumps of balloons tethered high
above the concession tents and

the large purple banners that
flanked the stage with words
from a Grateful Dead song: "Fare
you well, fare you well, we love
you more than words can tell."
A blanket on the grass became
our raft, and we found ourselves
surrounded by the sea of diversity
that San Francisco boasts. Sitting
next to me was a little girl intent
ly reading about spiders from a
book with large color pictures. I
learned quite a bit.
The show started at 10:15 a.m.
with the Dirty Dozen and contin
ued as a succession of performers
each did two songs and were
quickly replaced.
Bobby McFerrin did his a cap
pella thing. Jackson Browne did
his somber piano thing. Joe Satri
ani did his instrumental guitar
thing, and Aaron Neville's sweet,
high-pitched voice did, as usual,
undescribable things.
Carlos San tana came on around
11:15, and his Latin rhythms and
gracefully fluid guitar playing
drifted over the sunshine
drenched crowds for an hour.
Dancing, where there was
room, was mandatory.
By 12:30 in the afternoon,
however, the heat and the drink
ing began to take its toll on the
crowd's enthusiasm.
Even Robin Williams, who
made a brief appearance about
this time, was subdued, though
his picture of Graham trying to
get Elvis on after Mozart in a
heavenly concert was a crowd
pleaser.
The Grateful Dead, cooler tem
peratures and dancing began at
2:30, and their 90-minute set,
which included four Credence
Clearwater Revival songs by John
Fogerty, became unforgettable
the minute a low-flying plane
began dropping thousands of car
nations as the crowd roared its
appreciation of the gesture.
Shortly afterward, while Joan
Baez closed the show with
"Amazing Grace" (doesn't she
know any other songs?) I gazed
upon a short, naked man stand
ing in the crowd. He was obvious
ly very stoned, looking wonder
ingly at a red carnation he held.
As the crowd gave Graham one
last ovation, the man looked up
with a bewildered gaze and start
ed clapping.
Somehow, this was a strange,
but fitting tribute.
