# In search of the lost digital chord

### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Searching for good music is not an easy
task. Not because there aren't enough music
stores in the area. There are plenty. The prob
lem arises when one attempts to define "good
music."
I decided to put the question to the profes
sionals.
The people at Tower Records, located at
2727 El Camino Real, will tell you good music
is what people request. According to this defi
nition, and their latest shipment of compact
discs, Guns 'n' Roses is one of the best groups
in existence today.
Somehow, I was not satisfied. Although
Tower has everything from rap to industrial
rock on CD or cassette, it was time to move on
in my quest.
The CD Warehouse, at 456 E. El Camino in
Sunnyvale, was an interesting alternative to
Tower. This store has used CDs as well as lis
tening stations where you can check out the
used disc you are considering buying. You can
even preview select new releases that change
every two weeks.
I thought for sure people here would know
the meaning of good music. Chris, the manag
er of the store, said good music consisted of a
particular selection of certain labels. I asked if
alternative music fit into this category. He
said "Yeah, if they sell."
Understanding this, I asked if they still
would be considered alternative if they sold.
"Not really," he answered. I decided to move
on.

The owner of the store said
worthwhile music definitely
did not include club music or
Barry Manilow.

CD World, at 477 University Avenue, a
smaller but much closer version of the CD
Warehouse, had a little bit more to say. This
store seemed a logical place to stop because of
its proximity to campus and its willingness to
cater to the student population; this store
buys used CDs and also offers $1 off of the
purchase of any CD priced $6.99 or higher
with the presentation of "The Campus Card."
Louis, the import buyer for CD World,
broke down the situation for me. Good music
is two things, he said: technical — "well played
and well recorded" — and emotional — "if it
hits you."
Louis also described junk: "pre-fabbed L.A.
rock," he said. Now, I finally had a clear picture
of "bad music." Unfortunately, "good music"
was still a little fuzzy, so I let my fingers do the
walking.
Chimera Books and Music, at 165 University
Avenue, advertises itself as the place to find
"worthwhile" music. I decided to equate
"worthwhile" with "good" and gave them a ring.
Walter Martin, the owner of the store, said
worthwhile music definitely did not include
club music or Barry Manilow. He said the
theme of his small shop is quality — not quan
tity. Most of the store's selection fits into the

categories of classical and jazz, but Martin
says he sells the classics in every category.
For musicians and musicologists, this place
is more than worth the visit. The store has
been open since 1970, and Martin said the
prices of long-playing records haven't gone up
since then. Compact discs are only $10.
Anything can be brought back within two
days for a full refund, Martin said. Also, if you
bring in a used CD, the store will give you $5
in cash or $7.50 in trade.
Only one problem remained. If I accepted
his definition of good music, only records cut
before 1970 would fall into this category. I
decided to try one last store.
Record Heaven, at 3779 El Camino, caught
my attention. Anything with such a divine
name had to harbor the truth I was seeking. I
called immediately.
Manager Steve Stav said good music was
"anything that lasts for more than 10 years."
Finally, I found a direct and exact answer that
seemed not to discriminate by genre or level of
marketability.
This store, which sells records of all types,
import posters, concert T-shirts, stereos, gui
tars, amplifiers, televisions, jewelry and more,
set me at ease. My heart was content.
After a long day of searching, the answer to
the original question became clear. In its own
way, each of these stores sells good music,
even the ones with the Barry Manilow.
Now all you have to do is walk into any one
of these stores and decide if you want to buy
mainstream artists, obscure artists, used CDs,
new discs, Europop, Swiss yodeling, heavy
metal, esoteric, street...
