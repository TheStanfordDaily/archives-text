# Dumping your discs
## 
### Alexander Wiesen 
Alternate things you can
do with a compact disc that is
just too boring to listen to:

• Use it as a coaster for hot
drinks, cold drinks, cup-o-noo
dles, etc.;
• Set it on the sidewalk under
neath the Empire State Building,
and claim it is a quarter dropped
from the top;
• Plug up the center, and use it
as an incredibly durable dental
dam;
• Sell it to someone who has a
NeXT computer, and claim it is
"some stupid Pentagon project or
something;"
• Toss it into someone's
garage near a tire, and

watch him try to fig
ure out what part of
the car it fits into;
• Toss it into the
air as a skeet-shoot
ing target;
• Hide it inside
a Big Mac, and |
offer it to someone

who just had recon
structive dental surgery;
• Play frisbee;
• Use it as a safe alternative to
ninja stars;

• Glue 500 of them
together, and use them to
support buildings;
* See if you can trade 100
of them for Manhattan

island, claiming "They're big
ger, prettier and shinier than
those old trinkets";
• Place two long sticks
through two of them, and use
them as ski poles;
• Lie, and claim it is a differ
ent, much better CD

that you "just don't
want to ruin by listen
ing to too much;
• Glue it to the tip of
a doorknob as a real
pain in the butt;
• Clog a UC-Berkeley
toilet with it;

• Use it as a Christmas tree
ornament or an expert-level dart
board;
• Fill two with sugary filling,
and sell them as musical Oreos;
• Trade it to Soviets for a chess
set;
• Lock it to your bicycle to dis
courage theft; or
• Sell it to tourists as part of
Mickey's brain from "It's a
Small, Small World."
