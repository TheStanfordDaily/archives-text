## New program director to pursue disabled access 
### Linda Friedlieb 
John Asheim vividly remembers helping carry
a disabled student up the stairs of his dormitory
freshman year.
Now, as the new program director of the Dis
ability Resource Center, he hopes to persuade the
University to find other ways of making buildings
accessible.
Asheim, who graduated in June with a degree in
economics, said he hopes to use his position to
"pursue and investigate the possibilities of vertical
access" — something many of the disabled students
he talks to call their most important concern.
Reserved and articulate, Asheim has been
nearly blind since age 8, when he sustained optic
nerve damage as a result of a virus and lost his
vision almost overnight. But he doesn't believe his
disability gives him an advantage in understand
ing other disabled students' problems.
"Just because you are disabled, it doesn't mean
you are an authority on disability," he said. "I
think my disability does give me a different, but
not [necessarily] advantageous, insight into prob
lems one faces when one is disabled."
As program director, Asheim will be responsi
ble for interacting with disabled students —
including those with learning disabilities — and
coordinating resources at the center to meet their
needs. He said he hopes to continue to involve stu
dents in both the center's activities and plans.

Recent graduate John Asheim, who has been nearly blind since age
8, is the new program director of the Disability Resource Center
ford. It is risky for students to
associate themselves with disabil
ity by spending time at the center,
he said.
And the lack of disabled role
models also made it difficult for
Asheim to accept his disability.
"Mentors for disabled people are

few and far between, especially
here at Stanford," he said.
Asheim also wants to explore
ways to deal with invisible disabil
ities, such as blindness and learn
ing disabilities, because people
often believe the only real disabil
ities are those that can be seen.
"If you don't look disabled, you
are not going to be accommodated
like another student who appears
disabled," he said. People are "very
affected by social conditioning.

"I think a lot of times students
were afraid to approach me
because they were uncomfortable
with my disability," he said.
Students "were very worried
about making a mistake. IMy] dis
ability was just some mysterious
thing to be afraid of," he added.
Asheim said he plans to attend
law school in the future. He is
particularly interested in civil
rights law, especially as it per
tains to people with disabilities.
