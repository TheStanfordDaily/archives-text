# What's in a name?
## 'Your name here' more than meets the eye 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
Ever wondered what it would take to fol
low in the footsteps of Mr. Wilbur, Mrs.
Moore and Mr. Kimball?
Would you like freshman to pass a pala
tial stucco edifice and exclaim, "Dude! I
wished I lived in (your name here)
Hall instead of Kimball!"?
If the answers to one or more of these
questions is yes, your thinking may be a bit
sophomoric. But, fear not. By the time you
are a senior (citizen) and have enough
money to pay for a building, your priorities
may have matured.
According to Elizabeth Sloan, the direc
tor of communications at the Office of
Development, "The naming recognition is a
byproduct — it is not generally the thing
that makes the donor step forward in the
first place."
Bill Kimball, for example, raised over
$15 million for a residence out of his "love
for the institution," Sloan said, not just to
get his name on a building. The projected
goal for the new dormitory was a mere $7
million, and the leftovers from his collection
will fund Manzanita 11, a dormitory cur
rently under construction.
But donors whose urge for an eponymous
edifice runs deeper than their pockets
shouldn't worry — there are "naming oppor
tunities" at relatively low levels, Sloan said.
The best buy in personalization at Stan
ford is probably the book fund. A mere
$10,000 — the minimum price tag for
establishing a fund — can purchase small

"From the private collection of' stickers for
the front covers of several hundred library
books. The seals are often festooned with
such niceties as 16th-century woodcarvings
and photos of loved ones.
Just as the donors of building don't
select furniture, nameplate benefactors
don't select individual books, but rather
general areas of interest.
Those who give $100,000 to the Univer
sity by February can get their names
stamped on a small ceramic tile on the back
of a bench in front of Green Library.
This may not upstage Cecil Green's
billing, but as Sloan says, the University
doesn't "typically do a lot of physical recog
nition — unless there's a naming opportu
nity on campus."
According to Sloan, those donors who
have given more than $100,000 during
Stanford's first 100 years will be memorial
ized on the benches, which will be posi
tioned outside the library on a peaceful plot
to be christened "Centennial Green" on
February 10, 1992.
(Notice the sequence of events: The donor
does not pay for a bench, but rather selflessly
hands over the money and is then, if the oppor
tunity arises, awarded a spot on a bench.)
A donation to the rebuilding of Memorial
Church will buy one of two forms of memo
rialization within the heavenly structure.
Benefactor's names will either appear on a
large plaque or on the back of a pew,
depending on an upcoming decision.
And a golden opportunity may be on the
horizon for donors who want a lit
tle more than a bench in their
memory. If a proposed new athlet
ic building gets off the books and
on to the ground, donors may have
the chance to put their names on,
among other things, a football
suite — for a tidy $1 million.
Not all that money would go
into the construction of the suite,

however. According to Sloan,
donors may soon have to "endow"
projects, which means some of
their gift would be invested and
the interest used for future
upkeep. Requiring donors to
"endow" a building — an idea pro
posed recently in light of budget
difficulties — would alleviate
future maintenance costs.
As donor aspirations ascend to
heavenly heights — such as paying
for church repairs — they usually
overlook such down-to-earth
things as funding upkeep and

maintenance. And when it comes
to raising money for such dark
horse causes, the job of fund-rais
ing turns into "a real art," she says.
Although it is difficult to gen
eralize about donors, Sloan said
all of them share a desire to see
Stanford grow. Their satisfaction
derives from a feeling that "they
are having impact in moving
Stanford forward," according to
Sloan, not from seeing their
names gloriously emblazoned on
books, plates, plaques, buildings,
suites and church pews.
