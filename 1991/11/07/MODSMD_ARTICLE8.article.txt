# Hospital remains on 'cutting edge'

In 1961, the first kidney
transplant on the West Coast
was performed in the Stanford
Hospital by Dr. Roy Cohn, now
a retired surgeon. Thirty years
later, the hospital is finalizing
plans for a groundbreaking
new Multi-Organ Transplant
Center.
The new center, which will
probably host its first opera
tion in the next two weeks, will
provide a forum for the latest
techniques in kidney, pancreas
and liver transplants. Stanford
is already acclaimed as a leader
in heart and heart-lung trans
plants.
The transplant center is
staffed by a new team of
experts recruited from around
the country. "The most excit
ing aspect of this center is the
combination of research and
clinical facilities," said Dr.
Donald Dafoe, associate profes
sor of surgery and head of the
center, who left his post as
chair of the surgery depart
ment at the University of
Pennsylvania to come here.
"This does not mean that
we will be using patients for
research — this means that we
shall be able to analyze their
problems in a research envi
ronment and then take our
results back into the clinical
arena to improve treatment
and patient care," Dafoe said
"Stanford's immunology
program is a world-class pro

gram, and since immunology
and transplant procedures are
closely linked, Stanford seems
to be the right place for this
program" said Dr. Edward J.
Alfrey, an assistant professor
of surgery on the center's staff
who was Dafoe's colleague in
Pennsylvania.
"Although Stanford pio
neered several breakthroughs
in cardiac and cardiac-lung
transplants, it has started
rather late in the kidney, liver
and pancreas transplants
area," Dafoe added. But the
program is growing. About 30
kidney, 10 liver and five pan
creas transplants are sched
uled to be performed in the
next year.
"With this number doubling
in the years to come, a lot of
Bay Area patients will stand to
benefit" said Dr. Dafoe.
"It's really touching to see a
recipient after the transplant
— it's as if they received a new
life again," said Jane Wasker
witz, the chief donor coordina
tor for the center, who came
here from the University of
Michigan.
"This is true not only for
the liver and kidney recipients,
but also for diabetics with pan
creas transplants who finally
have the opportunity of doing
away with their insulin tablets
and injections," she said.
The center will not receive a
new building, but Surgery
Ward 2C in the hospital is
being completely renovated to
house the unit.
