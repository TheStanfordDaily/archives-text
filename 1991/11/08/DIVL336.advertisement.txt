A
GREAT WAY
TO START
YOUR
CAREER
You know the value of education.
Now, put it to work and advance your
career at the same time.
As a VISTA volunteer you will help
people in communities all over the
United States. You could train tutors
for literacy programs, you might
manage a program to help the
homeless. Maybe you will organize
projects to rehabilitate abandoned
houses or even develop educational
programs to combat substance abuse.
VISTA volunteers serve all over
America, building better
communities, one block at a time.
Helping VISTA to help people is a
great way to start your career. You
will not only gain managerial and
organizational experience, but also
get hands-on planning experience not
available in an entry-level job. A year
of VISTA responsibility and
experience in your resume will earn
the respect of prospective employers.
The benefits don't stop there. As a
VISTA volunteer, you may qualify
for deferment of your student loan, or
a partial cancellation of a National
Direct Student Loan. VISTA also
provides a living allowance based on
the community in which you serve.
There is also a readjustment
allowance at the end of your service.

representative today!

All are welcome at an information
session from 6-Bpm Stanford Univ.
Tresidder, Cypress South.
