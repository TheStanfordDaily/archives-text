The drive to be the best.
Ten years, hundreds of aceolades and
millions of sales dollars later, the people
of Quantum still aren't satisfied. Because
to us, being the best means more than
consistently outdoing the competition
with our innovative disk drive products.
It's also an inner drive—one that
compels us to continually top our own
personal bests.
That kind of drive is responsible for the
industry's first drive on a card, the first 1"
profile 3-1/2" drive, and now a family of
high-speed 2-1/2" drives. And 10
consecutive quarters of sales growth.
Are you driven?
We take only thebest —and we return the
favor. We offer a generous compensation
and benefits package as well as a
superior work environment in our new
facility, just off Highway 237 in Milpitas.
If you work smart, hard and fast—like
us —and are pursuing an MBA, we'd
like to meet you.
