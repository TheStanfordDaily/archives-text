# Performing to save the arts
## Students show support at White Plaza rally 
### Connie Lo Julia Sobrevilla Staff writers 
Amid buoyant singing and dancing, more than
600 people crowded White Plaza yesterday dur
ing a rally in support of the visual and perform
ing art programs facing possible budget cuts.
"There is a sad misconception that these
groups will somehow survive at Stanford with
out departments," junior Adam Tobin said in a
speech to the crowd. "But student groups will
shrivel up; student artists will have no one to
teach them how to get better; prospective stu
dents who want to pursue arts won't come to
Stanford."
Twelve groups performed, including Kuum
ba, six a cappella groups and the Stanford
Improvisers.
Lance Miller, a graduate student in drama,
gave the keynote speech at the rally. Miller is the
artistic director of Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety and a member of the Ad Hoc Student Com
mittee for the Arts.
"What we have done is write letters, circulate
petitions, call the press, our alums, our col
leagues — gosh, even our parents," he said.
"What we can do is celebrate the arts."
Celebrate the arts is just what some specta
tors did, singing along with many of the per
forming groups and breaking into impromptu
dances as music by the Stanford Symphonic
Band closed the rally.
During the rally, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Ewart Thomas and Assoc. Dean Car
olyn Lougee were presented with a book of sig
natures, letters and petitions.
"I was pleased to be part of a campus with

The atmosphere at the "Art for Art's Sake" rally in White Plaza was a combination of both outrage against proposed
budget cuts and a joyous celebration of the arts.

such creative talent," said
Thomas. "I found it a very positive
experience, a lot of wit and humor
and drama, appropriately so."
Kuumba dancer Tanya Leake
said the rally's purpose was to
"get people aware that arts are on
the chopping block." Kuumba is a
part of the Black Performing Arts
program, a possible target for
budget cuts.
Students videotaped about 50
personal appeals to the deans at
the rally, according to graduate
student Karen Bauer, who video
taped the messages.
"Making art is work," said
Elizabeth Hutchkinson, a first
year graduate student in Art His
tory. "Make no mistake about it.
Art is not a luxury."
Rob Robinson, chair of the
German Studies Department and
a Roble Hall resident fellow, said
the loss of the visual and per
forming arts at Stanford would
result in "travesty, boredom and
brain atrophy."
Possible cuts would result in
"creative malnutrition" among
students, said Scott Saul, editor
of the Soviet American Journal
Montage. He added, "Once you
start cutting [the arts], the envi
ronment for creative expression
is going to shrivel up."
Several students expressed
concern that cutting visual and
performing arts would result in
Stanford's loss of prestige as a top
liberal arts university.
Freshman Stephanie Morgan
also said that possible art pro
gram cuts would make her con
sider leaving Stanford. "Art was
one of the reasons I came here,
and if they cut it I'm not sure I'd
be happy here."
According to Thomas, "An
event like today's rally will proba
bly have an effect, but [decisions
haven't] been made yet."
"What I heard today is that
arts are very important to stu
dents and to prospective stu
dents," said Lougee. "The mes
sage has not been lost on us."
