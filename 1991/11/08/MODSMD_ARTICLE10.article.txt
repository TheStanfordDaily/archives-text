INGLE WOOD, Calif. (AP) - Magic
Johnson, one of the greatest basketball
players ever, shocked the sports world
yesterday with the announcement that
he is HIV-positive and is retiring from
basketball immediately.
"It can happen to anybody â€” even
me, Magic Johnson," Johnson said,
making the announcement himself at
a news conference televised nationally
and attended by old teammates, doc
tors and NBA commissioner David
Stern.
In 12 sparkling seasons, Johnson
and his trademark smile helped turn a
struggling NBA into the biggest sports
success story of the 1980s. With Magic
running the fast break, Los Angeles
Lakers games were "Showtime." LA
won five NBA championships, and
Magic was the league's MVP three
times.
Johnson got the news Wednesday
that the human immuno-deficiency
virus, which causes AIDS, had turned
up in routine tests for a life insurance
policy.
"This is one of those things you

think can't happen to you, but it can,"
he said. "Sometimes you're a little
naive about it and think it can never
happen to you. You think it can hap
pen to only other people. But it has
happened, and I'm going to deal with
it, and life goes on."
Neither he nor his doctors said how
or when he contracted the virus, but
Johnson said it shows that gays aren't
the only people who are infected and is
a lesson to everyone to practice safe
sex.
While both he and his doctors
stressed that he does not have AIDS, a
disease of the immune system for
which there is no known cure, the
announcement left fans, friends and
fellow players stunned and tearful.
Los Angeles Lakers general manag
er Jerry West was near tears at the
news conference, and Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar cried when he heard the news.
Pat Riley, Johnson's former coach
with the Lakers and now coach of the
New York Knicks, led his players, the
Orlando Magic and the crowd at
Madison Square Garden in a prayer

before their game last night.
"This [is] a huge shock for us,"
West said. "It's devastating for us
from an emotional standpoint and a
personal standpoint."
"It is not a very happy moment in
any of our lives," Abdul-Jabbar said.
"I'm happy to see he has a positive
outlook. When I saw him, he tried to be
positive as he could. He was smiling as
usual. I just told him I'd be there for
him. I want to offer him friendship."
Hundreds of people ventured to the
Forum in Inglewood for the news con
ference, and people cried openly in the
streets of Los Angeles.
For Magic, though, the smile was
still there, just faintly dimmed, as he
told the most difficult news conference
of his life that he would become a
spokesman for AIDS groups and pro
mote safe sex among youngsters.
"I plan on going on living for a long
time, and I guess now I can enjoy some
of the other sides of living," Johnson
said. "It's another challenge, another
chapter in my life. You're back is
against the wall. I think you just have

to come out swinging. I'm swinging."
Lakers team physician Dr. Michael
Mellman stressed that Johnson does
not have AIDS and is leaving the game
now because the physical stress of pro
basketball could aid the onset of the
disease.
Johnson had not played for the
Lakers this season. He missed the first
three games, complaining of weakness
and dehydration, which doctors said is
not related to his HIV-positive status.
"His spirit is strong. He is alive, but
not very well right now. We do not
want to eulogize him," Riley said. "We
want to give him all the support and
love we can. I'm sure all the people
around him and love him feel worse
than he does."
"I plan to go on, living on,"
Johnson said. "I plan to be with the
Lakers and the league," he said.
Johnson, from Lansing, Mich., was
married in his home state on Sept. 14
to longtime girlfriend Cookie Kelly,
who he said tested negative for the
AIDS virus. He has a son, Andre, who
lives in Lansing.
