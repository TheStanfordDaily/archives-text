## Mideast peace train 
### 
The time for peace in
war-torn Middle East
has never been better

Reality has set in
among the players of the
Middle East. Deep-seated
mistrust and hatred continue to
plague all sides involved in the
Madrid peace talks.
Syria's hard-line stance holds
fast while Israel refuses even to
discuss the idea of withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, an area
that it seized from Syria during
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
On Monday, Israel opened a new
settlement for Soviet immigrants in
the area, and continues frenzied
construction there as well as in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The Israelis and Arabs still have
not settled on a site for the next
phase of the talks. The former are
demanding that negotiations alter
nate between Israeli and Arab
cities, while the Arabs wish them
to remain in Madrid.
Nevertheless, the past week has
produced monumental results,
both tangible and intangible.
Despite the charged polemics
each side lobbed at the other, no
one left the room. U.S. Secretary of
State James Baker has done an
admirable job in pressuring all
sides to keep the process going.
And no team wants to be held
responsible for scuttling the nego
tiations.
That Syria, Jordan, Lebanon,
the Palestinians and Israel sat
together at the same table on
mutual terms demonstrates
implicit recognition of each other's
right to exist.
The entire power dynamic in
the region has been dramatically
altered. The death knell of the cold
war has left many Arab regimes
scrambling for benefactors; Israel
is no longer seen as the United
States' sole concern.
Syria no longer plays the com

manding role it once did and
appears to have toned down its
entrenched stance slightly by
admitting that "the Israelis as a
people desire peace." With all sides
locked into the proverbial peace
cage and the United States acting
like the global police force, perhaps
Syria realizes it cannot afford to
break out.
That a non-Palestine Liberation
Organization negotiating team
acceptable to both Israel and the
PLO was assembled is testament
to the dramatic changes that
brought everyone together.
Parts of the 1978 Camp David
accords were never realized because
the Palestinians could not accept
the terms for negotiating with
Israel. They refused to be repre
sented by anyone but the PLO.
They feared that interim self-rule
would preclude future discussion of
independence, and they insisted
that the fate of East Jerusalem be
on the table. Thirteen years later,
the Palestinians have set aside
these long-standing conditions.
On Tuesday, in the first elec
tions in the occupied Gaza Strip
since 1964, moderates favoring
peace talks won with a command
ing majority. Perhaps the years of
violence and blood-letting have
finally worn down their defenses.
Perhaps the prospect of lasting
peace and independence, however
slim, is simply too great to resist.
No one knows if any peace
agreements will arise from future
phases of last week's discussions.
Any accord could take years to
hammer out. Issues such as
whether Israel will ever consider
withdrawal from the occupied ter
ritories and Golan Heights, and
whether Jordan would even accept
an independent Palestinian state
remain seemingly insurmountable
obstacles and could well derail the
process.
But the rusty wheels of the
peace train, stalled for more than
10 years, have once again begun to
roll into uncharted territory. And
no one can tell how far it will go
until it runs out of steam.
