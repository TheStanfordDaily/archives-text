New benefits discriminate against single employees

WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS
our dismay over the introduc
tion of employee contributions
for single insurance coverage.
At first we were told the rate for sin
gle coverage would be raised because it
would be more equitable if these employ
ees helped to cover the increase in family
coverage. But while singles will have to
incur this increased expense, family pay
ments for two of the plans will actually
go down, and family payments for Blue
Shield and Healthnet will be less than
half the new charges for individual cov
erage.
We cannot accept this as "equitable."
Already the benefits package favors fam
ilies.
Employees with two or more depen
dents may save $680 in the first year,
while single-coverage employees may

lose $312. This creates a take-home pay
difference of nearly $1,000. It is hard to
understand how anyone could consider
this reasonable. Married employees have
choices in planning their benefits when
both spouses are employed; other
employees do not.
Unmarried employees are also strug
gling to live in this area on one salary
and are paying considerably higher
income taxes. For many of them this will
mean salary increases will not meet
inflation.
We could relate many personal stories
of cost-conscious decisions made by fac
ulty and staff. To be told that we have
been irresponsible in these decisions is
simply insulting.
During the "reorganization" several
years ago, a group was brought together
to assure that cuts in one area would not

adversely impact the workload of anoth
er area of the campus. Then the academ
ic departments were told they would
have to absorb the functions of the grad
uate student offices.
Today we are told decisions will not
be made unfairly, without involvement
of faculty and staff, and yet this reduc
tion of the take-home pay of one seg
ment of employees comes down without
apparent involvement or preparation.
This gives us little comfort that employ
ees will indeed be included this time
around.
We work at Stanford because we
believe in the University. We could
accept the news that we can no longer
get something for nothing and that
everyone will have to accept increased
costs. We would have accepted this for
the good of the University. But for our

rates to go up and others' rates to go
down is just not acceptable.
Still, involvement is essential if Stan
ford is to address the current budget
problems successfully. Faculty and staff
morale is a key factor in involvement,
and a decision like the one on health
benefits is highly destructive of that
morale — to the employees adversely
affected because of its perceived unfair
ness and to the employee community as
a whole because of its divisiveness.
Considered in this light rather than
in purely financial terms, it is surely a
more costly decision than Stanford can
afford! We are willing to meet the Uni
versity half way, but we didn't expect to
have to do it on our knees.
