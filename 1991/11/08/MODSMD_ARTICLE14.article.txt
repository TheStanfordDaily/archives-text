# Stanford Tech looms as a horrifying possibility for all
## 
### 
I STRONGLY URGE MEMBERS of
the Stanford community to speak out
against the closure of the Drama
Department or any part of the perform
ing arts program at Stanford.
Stanford was not founded to be a
technical school like MIT or Caltech. If
the Drama, Music and Creative Writing
Departments are cut, what will be next?
Ten years from now, will Stanford be
primarily a school for math and science
with a few token humanities depart
ments?
The Stanford community prides itself
on diversity and multiculturalism, but
how can Stanford consider itself diverse
if it willingly cuts a superb performing
arts program? The performing arts con
tribute to the education of all students
regardless of their msyor.
Although I am a biology major, I have

taken several classes in the Drama
Department and have learned a great
deal. If Stanford wants to be a world
class university, it is important that it
provides students with a truly liberal
education and an opportunity to become
knowledgeable in the arts as well as the
sciences.
The loss of the Drama Department
would also severely affect student per
forming-art groups such as Ram's Head
and a cappella singing groups. As the
producer of 1991 Big Game Gaieties, I
know Ram's Head could not exist with
out the support of the Drama Depart
ment.
Although most of our 400 members
are not drama majors, we all have
learned a great deal from the professors
and graduate students in the depart
ment. Performance classes in subjects

like stage management, scenic design
and make-up design are particularly
important.
My fellow students and I have also
gained a great deal from working and
watching the actual plays the Drama
Department produces each year. If the
department is closed, Big Game Gai
eties, a 100-year-old tradition, will be
very difficult to produce. It would be
very sad to mark the beginning of Stan
ford's second century with the end of
performing arts.
I understand that some cuts need to
be made to solve the budget crisis, but
the administration plans to solve the
budget crisis by destroying the perform
ing arts departments and leaving the
rest untouched.
The administration seems to believe
that drama and music are less impor-

tant than other departments in thi
School of Humanities and Sciences.
This is simply not true. Drama and
music are a critical part of a Stanford
education. All departments in Humani
ties and Sciences should receive equal
budget cuts before any department is
closed.
I urge everyone to speak out against
the proposal to cut the performing arts.
If Stanford wishes to remain the diverse,
high caliber university that it is today, it
must keep and support its Drama
Department. If you care about the
future of Stanford University, please
write to the administration and Board of
Trustees today because DRAMA MAT
TERS!
