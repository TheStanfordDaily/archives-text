## Kennell Jackson The 						invaluable frosh house experience 
### 
THE YEAR IS 2016, AND Stanford
is celebrating its 125 th anniversary
with the usual swarm of alumni on
campus.
One alumnus to another: "Were you
here when they had all-frosh houses?"
"No, but I lived in Otero when it was a
four-class house; and we heard stories
about its greatness as a frosh dorm —
heroic tales about Mathies."
First alumnus: "I wasn't here either
when there were frosh houses. But have
you noticed how these old frosh house
people are stealing the show? Old geezers
too, but irrepressible."
"Yeah, I feel a little out-done by them. Oh,
here comes another of their processions."
Procession passes, several hundred
strong, with huge banners reading
"Frosh Houses = Paradise Forever,"
"Still Mad about Madera," "Frosh Hous
es Do It With Naivete" and "Bring Back
Frosh Houses."
I am not just exercising my feeble
skills at futuristic imagination. I am try
ing to introduce you to a proposal that is
rapidly making its way around the Uni
versity — a proposal to get rid of the all
frosh houses. This idea is buried in an
otherwise dry document, penned by
Office of Residential Education Assoc.
Dean Alice Supton, on "Budget Issues."
I know it is hard for some frosh-dorm
loyalists to take this notion on a hang
loose Friday. In fact, I have been letting

out James Brown shrieks every since I saw
it."I feel bad." The document suggests
somehow frosh dorms have just not mea
sured up. Up to what is not clear. Now, the
document does not come right out and say
it. Yet, you do not have to be a rocket sci
entist to get the message. "I f-e-e-1 BAD."
According to Supton, frosh dorms
have been unable to attract faculty mem
bers to be resident fellows. Four-class
and three-class dorms have done better
at this. By dissolving the frosh houses
and scattering the frosh among upper
class students, Res Ed could expose more
frosh to more faculty. From this simple
change, a bounty of good things would
flow: strengthened advising, more faculty
resources to the houses through faculty
RFs and fewer behavior problems.
After I got through my James Brown
spins, splits and screams, I became
depressed by the Supton proposal. I felt like
frosh houses had been hit by a phantom
Mac Truck of vintage stereotypes.
Just a few correctives. Frosh houses in
the 1980s were the center of many educa
tional innovations and pioneering strate
gies aimed at supporting students aca
demically: critical thinking seminars in
Otero, academic coordinator programs in
Florence Moore and RF Sue Harvey's
frosh writing instruction in Larkin.
It is true that many frosh RFs have
not been faculty, but lecturers in things
like Cultures, Ideas and Values. But, year

after year, they have produced stellar
houses, winning four of the University's
coveted Dinkelspiel awards for "service to
undergraduate education."
On any night, one can travel the cir
cuit of frosh houses and find all kinds of
interactions with faculty, such as the
Nov. 18 faculty dinner upcoming
at Donner. For speakers, you cannot beat
"Branner Presents."
In short, frosh houses have been doing
the work that this report says only facul
ty RFs can do. Moreover, Res Ed knows
this — knows what we have accom
plished because of its annual (and expen
sive!) evaluations of each house.
We could make a terrible turn as a uni
versity if we rushed to close this option,
desired by 64 percent of each class for
more than a decade. We should worry
long and hard over this. In addition to the
myriad other changes we are asking stu
dents to absorb next year, 3rd floor, Old
Union, is proposing to rip out a more fun
damental and successful institution, the
venerable frosh dorm.
My counter-proposal: Trumpet frosh
house achievements, study their future
needs, propose improvements and recruit
energetically some daring faculty to be
frosh RFs. Updated, these house have
21st-century longevity.
