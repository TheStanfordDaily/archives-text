# Drafting of sexual assault policy criticized
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
As Stanford's new sexual assault policy
awaits revision, some staff members are ques
tioning its accuracy and the inclusiveness of
the drafting process.
The two-page policy includes a definition of
sexual assault, possible University actions
against offenders and a list of resources for
victims.
But some resources listed in the final draft
are erroneous. For example, the list includes
Stanford University Hospital as a resource.
But according to sexual assault prevention
and education coordinator Susan Epstein, the
only hospital in the county with a specially
trained sexual assault unit is Valley Medical
Center, which was omitted.
Epstein also said the HELP Center and
Ombudsperson — both on the list — do not
have any resources for sexual assault.
The Cowell Sexual Assault Response Team
was also not included on the list. "We are

trained to look at the whole person, and we can
respond beautifully," coordinator Gail Prichard
said. "I don't know why we were left out."
A final draft of the policy is needed for the
University to comply with a state law, passed
in January, requiring all universities to imple
ment a sexual assault policy.
A task force worked on recommendations
over the summer. The final draft was written
by Doug Dupen, deputy director of employee
relations in human resources services and
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. Dupen said
he and Cole have recommended that a more
detailed list of resources available to victims
be included.
The original intention was for the policy to
address unacceptable sexual conduct, accord
ing to Cole, but two weeks ago the authors
decided to draft a separate sexual assault poli
cy. She said that they will eventually re-exam
ine the 1987 sexual harassment policy, and
then make a separate overarching statement
for all sexual misconduct.
"I understand that the sexual assault policy

was needed immediately to meet state law and
that a policy on unacceptable sexual conduct
would take longer to approve," Epstein said.
"I strongly urge that one policy on unac
ceptable sexual conduct be written and adopt
ed," she added.
Epstein expressed "disappointment" at the
policy, but said that she was not "personally
upset" about not having a central role. "A lot
of informed people were not consulted," she
explained. "I would have liked to have seen a
better policy, regardless of who was involved."
The authors of the policy will be "including
in the revision efforts everyone who has
input," Cole said.
Prichard said, "I don't feel chagrined [that
I wasn't more involved], but if I were asked to
go to a committee meeting, I'd say, 'Sure.' The
staff is being judicious and doesn't want to
overtax us as resources."
The University Cabinet sent the policy back
for revision at an Oct. 31 meeting. A staff meet
ing involving the policy's authors and the task
force will take place today to discuss changes.
