## Slippery Garnett aims to rock Bruins 
### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
The Stanford and UCLA football teams have two
things in common: a four-game winning streak and
a steadily improving defense.
When the two teams meet at Stanford Stadium
tomorrow, one of the winning streaks will be broken
while one of the defenses will prove more effective
than the other.
Outside linebacker and defensive captain Dave
Garnett has contributed to the strength of the Car
dinal defensive line this season and will play a key
role in tomorrow's showdown.
"Dave's job is going to be really challenging
because he's gonna have to be involved in covering
backs, dropping the zones and making our checks,"
said head coach Denny Green. "He's gonna really
have his work cut out for him."
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound junior from Naperville,
Illinois has started in 24 games. In the 1990 season,
he was chosen Honorable Mention All-Pacific-10-
Conference and was fifth in the Pac-10 with 12 tack
les-for-loss.
This season Garnett's performance continues to
improve. He has recorded 28 unassisted tackles and
39 total tackles. Following the game at USC where
Stanford won 24-21, Garnett was named the Nation
al Car Rental Pac-10 Player of the Week.
"He's the caller for the defense," said linebacker
coach Dave Tipton. "He makes an awful lot of the
checks so he really has to play a 'head's up' game,
and Dave handles all that very well." Although he
plays a key role on the defensive line, Garnett is
often overshadowed by outside linebacker Ron
George. George is currently leading the Cardinal
defense with 51 tackles.
"So much has always been said about Ron George
and Ron is playing some really good football," Green
said. "But Garnett's the other part of what we call
the G-men."
"Ron and I are good buddies," Garnett said. "We
work together. There are some parts where I'm bet
ter than him and some parts where he's better than
me. I think it really helps our whole defense system
to have us both on the outside, doing what we can
do."
Freshman inside linebacker Coy Gibbs finds that
the greatest contrast between Garnett and George
lies in their personalities.
"Ron's a crazy man, he likes to yell a lot," Gibbs
said. "Dave just kinda gets the job done, he does it
calmly, more so than Ron. It's great to have them
both."
Both Green and Tipton agree that Garnett and
George have very different playing styles which end
up complimenting each other.
"Ron is very aggressive, very physical, very
strong. David is what we like to call a snake. He's
more of a snake, he wiggles. When all is said and
done, they both accomplish the same thing," Tipton
said.
"Ron is a little bit stronger at the point of attack,"
Green said. "Dave is a little more slippery, he doesn't

overpower guys as much. He has the ability to hit a
guy, slide away and still make plays. Both of them
are equally outstanding."
Garnett describes George as being a "bull-rush-go
after-them" guy, whereas Garnett is more of a "drop
cover" guy. Therefore, when one of the outside
linebackers has to drop, it is usually Garnett, and
George is the one who pressures the quarterback.
"We have to get to the quarterback a lot this
week," "They (UCLA) play a lot of shotgun and it's
hard to get to a guy like that." Garnett said. "Ron
George and Dave Garnett have to have career days."
Tipton agrees.

"We need to be able to rush the passer very well
and be able to make plays," Garnett said.
Garnett has set his sights on doing his job Satur
day and helping the Cardinal win its last few games.
He also hopes to build up his strength, speed and
weight, as well as improve his pass-rush. Tipton
describes Garnett as having become a "much more
complete player" since his arrival on the Farm.
"Dave started for us as a freshman and each year
he's made a significant improvement," Green said.
As a political science major aspiring to go to law
school, Garnett feels no regrets about his choice to
go to Stanford.
