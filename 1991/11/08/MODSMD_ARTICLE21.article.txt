## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal women swim
mers, coming off of a sound
thrashing of the defending
national champion Texas Long
horns in their first meet of the
season, square off against UC-
Santa Barbara this afternoon at
deGuerre Pool.
Santa Barbara is not expected
to give Stanford much of a chal
lenge, as by beating Texas, the
Cardinal has established itself as
the early-season favorite to win
the NCAA title in March. Stan
ford has been runner-up to the
Longhorns in each of the past
two seasons.
The early-season showdown
between swimming's No. 1 and
No. 2 teams saw several Stan
ford swimmers already in fme
mid-season form. Ail-American
Summer Sanders won three
events — the 100- and 200-
meter butterfly and the 400 indi

vidual medley — all in NCAA
qualifying time.
Freshman Jenny Thompson
also excelled, winning both the
50 and 100 freestyle as well as
swimming on two winning
relay teams.
Eileen Richetelli, who has
established herself as one of the
top divers in the country,
although she's only a sopho
more, won the three-meter com
petition and finished second in
the one-meter event.
The Gauchos, who are 0-2 in
dual meets this season after
losses to both UCLA and USC,
were on the short end of a 178-
75 contest against Stanford last
season, and will try to better that
today.
Their greatest scoring threats
come in the form of Courtney
Lowe, who won the 200 fly
against UCLA, and Stacey St.
Martin, who won both the 200
and 500 freestyles against USC.
The fireworks start at 1 p.m.
