# Water polo in do-or-die tilts
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
While Stanford's football game Saturday
against UCLA may be a bit more publicized, the
water polo game between the same two schools
at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow at deGuerre Fool, is
every bit as important for the Cardinal.
As sophomore Antonio Busquets said, "It's
basically a make or break situation for us. We
have to win the game if we're going to have a
chance of making NCAAs."
With five games left in the regular season,
the Stanford water polo team is still unsure if it
will be invited to the national tournament that
only one Cardinal team in the last 17 years has
not qualified for. After several big wins over
top-ranked opponents, the Cardinal (12-9) has
moved up to No. 4 in the nation, but because of
the team's early season struggles, Stanford still
needs the victory over the No. 3 Bruins (16-6) to
have a shot at going to NCAAs.
Five teams from California will make the
tournament, and right now, Stanford is battling
with Long Beach State for the final spot. Earli
er this week the 49ers lost a key game to fifth
ranked UC-Irvine, which gives Stanford and
Long Beach almost identical records against
top-ranked teams — the determining factor for
who gets invited to the tournament.
UCLA is one of those top teams, so a victory
over the Bruins would do wonders for the Car
dinal. As Coach Dante Dettamanti said, "A win
over UCIoA and another loss by Long Beach
would really put us in a great position."
But before Stanford squares off against
UCLA, the Cardinal will have to get by No. 8
Pacific (9-7) in a 3 p.m. game today at deGuerre.
Pacific has already knocked off No. 2 Pepper
dine this year.
The UCLA game, however, is the match
everyone is pointing towards. The teams have
already met three times this year, and after
UCLA easily won the first game, the last two
meetings have been decided by one goal, with
Stanford coming out on top in the latest game.
As junior Chip Blankenhorn commented, "It
always seems to be a close game between us
two, and it's just going to come down to whoev
er plays the best when it matters."
If the Cardinal is to prevail, the offense have
to find a way to beat the Bruins' All-American
goalkeeper Dan Hackett. "We're going to have
to figure out how to score on Hackett, but I
think it's possible," Dettamanti said. "Our
offense has been playing really well, and we've
just got to put the ball in the net when we get
the chances."
After all, as Blankenhorn summed it up,
"This is it for us. It's do or it's die."
