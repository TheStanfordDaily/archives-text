# Big Mac relishes Bronco rematch

### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
Heather Mclntyre's college
soccer career is almost over.
With only the NCAA tourna
ment ahead of her, the senior full
back looks at the next four games
with only one wish â€” to win them
all.
"It's all I could ask out of the
season," Mclntyre said of a tour
nament victory. "The team
means so much to me ... this
would be the greatest."
The thought of a national title
was one of the furthest things
from Mclntyre's mind when she
made the decision to come to
Stanford four years ago. The
team had just gone 4-11-4, and it
looked as though soccer was going
to become a mere hobby for her.
"I wasn't expecting anything
out of soccer when I came here,"
Mclntyre said. "I was just plan
ning to concentrate on academics.
We had Jen Rowland (former
scoring leader for the Cardinal)
and Denise (Denney), who were
great players, but the program as
a whole wasn't why I came here."
Fortunately, the Stanford soc
cer program has improved at a
blistering rate. The Cardinal
enters the NCAA tournament
Sunday with the second-best
record in the country. With a 16 -
1 record, Stanford women's soc
cer bears almost no resemblance
to the team that Mclntyre
thought she was joining in 1988.
"We used to be more of a fight
ing, scrappy team, but now we

play pretty," she said.
Pretty amazing, anyway. Stan
ford sports one of the finest team
defenses in the country, allowing
a miserly four goals in 1991.
Much of this success can be
attributed to Mclntyre.
"Defense starts from the for
wards," Mclntyre said. "If they do
their job, it makes ours that much
easier."
Mclntyre went on to praise
goalkeeper Leslie Garrard for the
job she has done. "She had huge
shoes to fill," Mclntyre said,
referring to the departure of for
mer keeper Elise Edwards. "She's
done an excellent job. Every time
we need her, even though it
hasn't been that often, she's been
there."
She also points to head coach

Berhane Andeberhan and asst.
coach lan Sawyers as reasons for
the team's outstanding success.
"Lan has made a huge differ
ence on the team emotionally,"
Mclntyre said. "He's made us
work our butts off and taught us
to believe in ourselves ... he
could easily have his own college
team."
"And Berhane ... he's the best
coach I've ever had. The fact that he
was going to be the coach was a big
reason why I came (to Stanford)."
While Mclntyre spends a lot of
time doling out compliments, her
abilities on the soccer field force
her to be on the receiving end of
praise as well.
"Heather's one of the best
sweepers to work with," said
freshman fullback Kristen Wair.
"She really knows what she's
talking about. .. she's got a lot of
experience. Playing in college is a
lot different than even playing in
regionals or nationals, so as a
freshman, it's great to have some
one like Heather to sort things
out for you."
"I could talk forever about
Heather," Andeberhan said of his
star sweeper. "In many ways, she
doesn't get the credit that she
deserves, because if she does her
job perfectly, nothing happens.
"A sweeper's first duty is to be
the commander of the defense.
She coordinates the entire team
defensively, starting with the for
wards," Andeberhan said. "She
also has to back up all of the full
backs, pick up any unmarked
players, and deal with any disas

ters that may happen. Plus, she's
the initiator of most of our
attacks.
"She has superior skills and
composure . . . she's one of the
most refined soccer players that I
have worked with, as well as
being a wonderful, generous,
calm person who really helps the
team off the field."
Success seems to follow Mcln
tyre wherever she goes. She came
to the Farm after having played
on a club team, the Soccerettes,
for 10 years. The team, which also
featured Stanford's Julie Foudy,
won the Norway Cup in a presti
gious European tournament in
1984 and was the Under-16
National Champion in 1986.
Mclntyre and the rest of the
team look toward Sunday's game
against Santa Clara with relish.
"We all wanted to play them
again," Mclntyre said (The Bron
cos beat the Cardinal earlier this
year, 2-1). "Whether we admitted
it to ourselves or not, I think
we're all happy that we didn't get
a bye and that we'll have another
chance to play them."
Although the team will be
weakened by the absence of
Foudy, Mclntyre and the team
are ready to crush Santa Clara,
without their high-scoring mid
fielder.
Foudy and North Carolina for
ward Kristine Lilly are the only
two players missing the NCAAs.
Both will be in China competing
for the national team.
Stanford faces Santa Clara 2
p.m. Sunday at Maloney Field .
