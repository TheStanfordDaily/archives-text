# Card host Gauchos in Pac-10 warm-up

When you're as good as the Stanford men's
swimming team, a challenge is hard to come
by-
The UC-Santa Barbara swim team com
petes today against the Cardinal at deGuerre
Fool, starting at 1 p.m.
"This is a tune-up for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, so we'll try not to put
swimmers in the same events as (against)
Texas," said coach Skip Kenney.
In order to add a little difficulty to the
meet, Stanford will be concentrating mainly
on its own swimmers, with swimmers trying
to earn slots on the Cardinal's Pac-10 Cham

pionship squad â€” or to improve in their sec
ondary events.
Last week, the Cardinal annihilated Texas,
dominating all stroke as well as freestyle
events.
Kenney wants to avoid any loss of momen
tum due to the comparison of last week's spec
tacular times to the results of today's more
low-key competition.
"After the Texas meet we have tremendous
momentum going into Pac-10's," Kenney said.
The UCSB meet was tacked on after the
Arizona and Arizona State teams cancelled
their dual meets with Stanford, due to this
season's rushed schedule. UCSB picked a bad
time to come to the Farm.
"We are really, really hot (right now).

Texas was the greatest dual meet we've ever
had," Kenney said.
For Stanford's top swimmers, today's meet
will be a chance to concentrate on races that
aren't their specialties. World-record holder
JefT Rouse will be concentrating on the Indi
vidual Medley instead of the 100 and 200
backstroke in which he dominates.
This meet is the last chance for the swim
mers to win spots on Stanford's Pac-10 team.
A few spots are still up for grabs, and swim
mers performing well today could earn a place
on the Cardinal's conference squad.
"We need to be swimming faster and faster.
Two or three people have to come around to be
able to make the NCAA cut at Pac-10's," Ken
ney said.
