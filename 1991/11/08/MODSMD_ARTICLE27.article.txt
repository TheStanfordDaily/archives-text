# Does dorm food grow?
## 
### 
Being a trained writer, i am
always looking for what we in the
business call "article fodder." This
usually consists of examining some unno
ticed habit of today's society, such as how
freshmen attempt to use the same bath
room stall all year long, and proclaiming it a
"trend."
And when I've read The Daily lately, my
special columnist instincts have started to
pick up a certain pattern taking shape
around here.
Call me cra2y, but when I see people

debating about how often to flush the uri
nals, vegetarians complaining that we
shouldn't call this place "the Farm" and
hundreds of people actually being offended
by the Band, I think it's fairly obvious what's
going on: People who write to The Daily have
hefty tumors growing in their skulls.
Yes, it's pretty easy to see the new trend
developing here. And it's not only going on
at Stanford; it's happening all over the
country. You all know what I'm talking
about — a giant epidemic of strange objects
growing inside human bodies.
No doubt you are all reminded of the
recently reported 303-pound cyst that was
removed from a woman at Stanford Hospi
tal. This is not normal. An object of this
size simply should not be turning up inside
of living people. I mean, after the operation
there was a significant danger that the
now-210-pound woman might have been
tossed in the disposal bin while the giant,
self-sufficient cyst was sent home with her
husband and kids.
And you'd think she would have noticed
it a bit sooner. Most people in this situation
might say to themselves, "Funny, but the
last time I got into bed it didn't snap in half
quite so easily." Makes you wonder. But for
those of you who are concerned, she is
doing quite well and has reported that she
is "breathing much easier."
Now, I might let this slide by as an iso
lated incident if I hadn't lived off of Uni
versity Food Service for two consecutive

years. Yes, many of you are familiar with
the type of "foodstuffs" that I willingly
introduced to my digestive tract and know
there is no possible way that an appetite
can disappear that quickly unless of course
the food was quickly reproducing in your
stomach.
I was always very worried about this
sort of thing as a kid, ever since my uncle
told me that the watermelon seeds I swal
lowed would start to grow inside of me. I
always expected to go to the doctor one year
and have him say, "Ken, I'm sorry, but you
have something we physicians refer to as
'fruit in the intestines.' " As you can imag
ine, dorm food didn't exactly ease that par
ticular fear.
But it was the experience of the
cyst/woman, combined with watching
"Alien" after a Wilbur dinner, that con
vinced me that I'd stumbled onto a new,
noteworthy trend. Little did I know that
my premed drawmate was about to find the
final piece of information that confirmed
my suspicions of this dangerous epidemic: a
disease known as elephantiasis.
Yes, I know most of you will think that I
am making this up, but there is in fact such
a medical condition that I read about in the
"Review of Medical Physiology," a book
available at our very own New-And-
Improved-But-Still-Overpriced Stanford
Bookstore. And on page 540, it gives a grip
ping account of — and I swear this is a
direct quote — "the man with elephantiasis
whose scrotum was so edematous that-he
had to place it in a wheelbarrow and wheel
it along with him when he walked."
Now while most of you female readers
are still puzzling over the word "edema
tous," you guys out there are most likely
hunched over protectively and muttering
"the horror. . . the horror." No male on the
planet wants to imagine living in that con
dition, especially after the neighbors fig
ured out that it wasn't a makeshift baby
carriage that he was pushing around.
But, in a far-too-late attempt to keep this arti
cle tasteful, I'll leave it at that, and won't even
speculate as to why he might have wanted to
take the family jewels for a walk. In fact, I've
probably blown this whole interior growth thing
way out of proportion, so I apologize if the con
tent of this article has made you feel a little
queasy. But it's probably just your breakfast,
anyway.

nental drift.
