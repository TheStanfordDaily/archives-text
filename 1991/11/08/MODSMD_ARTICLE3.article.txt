# Judicial amendments debated by Fac Senate

### Howard Libit Steve McCarroll Senior staff writers 
The Faculty Senate debated significant
changes to the University Legislative and
Judicial Charter, but ended yesterday's
meeting without a decision because too
few members remained for a vote.
The amendments, proposed by the
Committee of 15, include reducing the
burden of proof in University judicial cases
from "beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence," requiring
witnesses to cooperate in investigations
and establishing rights for people who file
complaints. (See separate story.)
Members of the senate spent more than
90 minutes debating the proposals before
adjourning because a quorum of senators
was no longer present.
Although several faculty raised ques
tions about the amendments, no members
said they would vote against them.
Two senate members expressed reser
vations about the "clear and convincing
evidence" standard but said they still sup
port the changes.
Law Profs. Deborah Rhode and Robert
Weisberg presented the amendments and
raised and answered potential objections
to the changes. Rhode and Weisberg are
members of both the senate and the Com
mittee of 15.
The student representatives to the sen
ate — Council of Presidents member Beth
Morgan and ASSU Senate Chair Kevin
Warsh — were the two most vocal oppo
nents of the amendments.
Changes to the judicial charter require
approval from the Faculty Senate, ASSU
Senate and University President Donald

Kennedy. At its meeting Tuesday evening,
the ASSU Senate rejected a bill opposing
the amendments but has not yet taken any
official stand.
Failing to maintain a quorum "can be
expected with such a complicated issue and
lengthy debate," said History Prof. James
Sheehan after the meeting. "It is frustrat
ing that we didn't get all the way to a vote,
but we will do it" as the first action item at
the Nov. 21 meeting.
In other senate business, sev
eral members criticized the Uni
versity's decision to require sin
gle staff and faculty to pay premi
ums for University health insur
ance while lowering the premi
ums for those with families.
"People are hired as single
employees — not as married cou
ples or families," said English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz
But Kennedy argued that the
change is "essential" to correct a sit
uation "where the choice among
plans is not cost-conscious." He
added that many people covered as
being single are actually part of fam
ilies and may be "double-covered."
The previous plan, according
to Kennedy, was "too generous"
for single staff and faculty, and
uncompetitive with other univer
sities' plans in regard to employ
ees with families.
Rebholz and History Prof.
Peter Stansky argued that such a
change should not be made until
the Faculty Senate has consid
ered extension of such health
benefits to domestic partners.
