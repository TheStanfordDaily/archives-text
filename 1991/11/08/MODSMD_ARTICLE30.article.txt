# Cuts in SLAC's future
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Federal budget cuts could cost
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center more than 200 employees,
according to Bill Kirk, assistant to
the center's director.
A possible 10-percent cut was
discussed in Washington, D.C. last
month, Kirk said. SLAC Director
Burton Richter announced the pro
posed cuts to employees Wednes
day, confirming rumors that had
been circulating.
SLAC would be one of three
high-energy physics laboratories
funded by the Department of Ener
gy to be affected by cuts, which are
intended to help balance the federal
budget.

"I'm sure people are quite wor
ried about it, but there is nothing
we can do now," Kirk said. "We
have to just wait it out."
Employees at the center will not
know if the proposed cuts will be
made until President Bush submits
the federal budget to Congress in
January or early February. If
made, cuts would go into effect next
October.
Kirk said he believes Richter
and others will be lobbying in
Washington over the next few
months to discourage the cuts,
which, including inflation, could
total 14 to 15 percent of the cen
ter's budget.
SLAC has about 1,350 employ
ees and $140 million in funding
this year.
