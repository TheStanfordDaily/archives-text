# Guilt standards perplex many
## 
### Holly Hacker Editorial staff 
The difference between "beyond a
reasonable doubt" and "clear and
convincing evidence" has many mem
bers of the Stanford community con
fused.
Currently, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter requires that a stu
dent's guilt be proven "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" in misconduct cases
ranging from sexual assault to viola
tions of the Honor Code or Funda
mental Standard.
But the Committee of 15, the body
comprised of six faculty, three staff
and six students that proposes
changes to the charter, wants to lower
the standard so that the Stanford
Judicial Council needs only "clear
and convincing evidence" of guilt
to convict a student.
Three standards of proof are
typically used in legal proceedings.
"Preponderance of evidence" is
used in most civil cases and
requires that "one story is more
true than another," according to
Law Prof. Miguel Mendez.
The "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard is used in all crim
inal cases, he explained. Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode said it "implies
that you cannot possibly have a
doubt" that the charges are true.
The intermediate standard,
"clear and convincing evidence,"
means evidence "is explicit and
unequivocal as to leave no sub
stantial doubt" of a person's guilt,
Rhode said.
"Very serious decisions are
made on clear and convincing evi
dence," Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock said. Cases decided with this
standard include those involving
deportation and child custody.
Rhode quantified the three levels
of proof, saying that "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" requires a 90 to 100
percent certainty of guilt; "prepon
derance of evidence," more than 50
percent; and "clear and convincing
evidence," 70 to 90 percent.
The committee's proposal must
be approved by the ASSU Senate,
Faculty Senate and University

President Donald
Kennedy.
At Tuesday's
ASSU Senate
meeting, Council
of Presidents
member John
Overdeck said the
clear and convinc
ing standard
would punish a

substantial percentage of innocent
students.
But Rhode attacked Overdeck's
logic, saying a 70 percent certain
ty of guilt "doesn't mean that 30
percent of people will be unjustly
convicted. We're talking levels of
certainty, not how many people
are innocent."
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole said that if she thought stu
dents would be wrongfully con
victed, she would not support the
committee's proposal.
The committee released its pro
posal in August, after Kennedy
asked it to consider the Sexual
Assault Task Force's recommenda
tion that the charter be amended.
The Task Force suggested that
the charter list rights of sexual
assault victims as well as require
cooperation of witnesses and the
defendant during the investiga
tion.
Rhode said it "quickly became
clear" that "some of the problems
were not unique to sexual assault
cases."
Cole said there is an "enor
mous gap" between the high level
of proof now needed and Stan
ford's ability to gather evidence.
