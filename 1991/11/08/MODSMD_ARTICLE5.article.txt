# Health plan draws fire
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Uproar over the recent changes in
employee benefits is continuing around cam
pus as concerned faculty and staff respond
by circulating letters of support and creating
a new organization to handle the issue.
According to Andrew Lisac, assistant
dean of summer session and continuing
studies, an organization called Stanford
Employees for Equity formed Wednesday
evening as "an overarching coalition of
support" for employees affected or con
cerned by the change.

The organization formed after two
weeks of controversy marked by a steady
stream of letters of protest in campus
newspapers. Last Friday's town meeting
with University administrators, meant to
address budget cuts, became a forum for
questions and criticism about the change.
About 175 people attended the meeting.
The University announced recently
that in March it will begin contributing
less to the health insurance costs of single
employees and will pass the difference
along to them. Previously, single employ-
ees did not contribute to their
health insurance, while married
employees had to pay for the cost
of their dependents.
Barbara Butterfield, vice presi
dent for human resources, defend
ed the decision, saying the change
would discourage single employ
ees from having double coverage
and encourage them to choose
programs more carefully.
Ed Haertel, associate professor in
the School of Education and a mem
ber of the employee organization,
said the group's initial goals are "to
establish a presence around these
issues and make sure the adminis
tration knows we're serious."
Haertel said the group's initial
goal is to obtain the facts, figures
and philosophy behind the decision.
The new organization also out
lined some possible courses of
action, he said. The pros and cons
of considering the unionization of
non-exempt employees were ten
tatively mentioned, along with
the possibility of obtaining out
side legal help.
Letters of support have been
circulating among faculty and

staff, Lisac said, adding that they
garnered "a couple hundred sig
natures in one day."
In response to the calls for
change in the benefits program,
Butterfield said the University was
moving towards a "flexible benefits,
or cafeteria-style program" where
employees would be allotted an
amount they could spend on bene
fits, and would then pick and
choose from a menu of possibilities.
However, implementation will
take a couple of years because the
financial system of the University
needs "aggressive work and sub
stantial changes, which will get
priority," Butterfield said.
Janet Wright, an administra
tive assistant in the Geology
Dept., said that waiting several
years for the plan to be intro
duced was "too long."
"A lot more people (are) upset
about this than they think,"
Wright said, referring to adminis
trators. "I haven't felt as strongly
about an issue in a while."
For some gay, lesbian and
bisexual employees, the decision
is particularly upsetting. A senate
study initiated last spring on the
issue of giving benefits to same
sex domestic partners hasn't been
produced, according to Haertel.
The broader context of the
absence of domestic partner rights
for faculty and staff "puts a differ
ent spin on it for us because of the
benefits that we have no access
to," Haertel said.
Butterfield said that the issue
of domestic partner rights for fac
ulty and staff was "emphatically
not tabled."
"I understand the concerns,
and there is an active committee
that I have asked to take the issue
seriously, to get facts together
and take action," she said.
