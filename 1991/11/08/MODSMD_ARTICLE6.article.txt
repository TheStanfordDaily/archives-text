# Break-in occurs at Shak
## Who would want the Band's old disco tree? 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
From Catholics to spotted owls, the
Stanford Band has made plenty of enemies.
But who would want to steal their clothes?
"We really hope it wasn't anyone on
this campus," said Band manager Jesse
Dorogusker. "If it was, we're bound to find
out, and we're going to be pissed."
Twenty red jackets and two Tree cos
tumes — including last year's "disco tree"
— were among items stolen from the Band
Shak Wednesday night. The jackets cost
$171 each and the Trees $500.

Although this year's Tree was not taken,
Stanford Band mascot Peter Huyck said his
costume had been "messed with." Several
instruments lying around the Shak were left
untouched, and an engraved wooden plaque
was the only other item reported missing.
"There's so much stuff in here, we
might never know everything that was
taken," Dorogusker said.
Band members arrived at the Shak yes
terday to find the main entrance and
equipment room unlocked. Although Stan
ford Police found no signs of forced entry,
two interior doors were damaged,
including the entrance to drum
major Eric Selvik's office, which
had been ransacked.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, Shak van
dalism isn't unusual, "especially
at this time of year."
But neither the police nor
band members are pointing fin
gers just yet.
"As far as I know, the Cal band
is out of town this week, plus it's
a little early for Big Game festivi
ties," Dorogusker said. "We usu
ally get along with the UCLA
band, but that's not to say we
don't have enemies."
