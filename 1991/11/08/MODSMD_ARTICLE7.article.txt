# Co-op offer rejected Synergy demolition to proceed
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Synergy house will likely be
demolished this morning after
University administrators yes
terday rejected a last-minute
proposal to save it.
The University turned down
the North American Students
for Cooperation's Wednesday
offer to purchase and renovate
the earthquake-damaged build
ing because it involved a long
term lease on University land
and the sale of the building,
University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Sen
ate yesterday.
"We think that we have

given every opportunity for pro
posals to come forth," he said.
In a brief interview follow
ing the meeting, he added,
"This is exactly the kind of
1 lth-hour delay tactic that we
were expecting."
An agreement by the Uni
versity not to demolish the
building, extending from a legal
complication unrelated to the
national co-operative organiza
tion's offer, expired at mid
night last night.
Kennedy and other Univer
sity officials said the Universi
ty will carry out the demolition
as soon as possible.
At the senate meeting, History
Prof. Peter Stansky and Council of
Presidents member Beth Morgan
challenged the University's decision
to proceed with the demolition.
"I think that an absolute posi
tion" against the sale of Universi
ty property to outside parties "is
being put forward in order to jus
tify the decision" to demolish the

houses, Stansky said.
"It is foolish not to continue to
investigate this possibility," he
added.
Stanford has pursued a policy
against third-party ownership of
University property since 1960,
buying back fraternity and co
operative houses that had been
built and owned by private groups.
The University plans to build
revenue-generating faculty hous
ing on the site, then use the rev
enue to develop more student
housing elsewhere on campus.
