House OKs civil rights bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ending two years of

"The struggle to enact civil rights legislation in
1991 has engaged us for a very long time," he said.
Five Democrats joined 33 Republicans in vot
ing against the civil rights bill. Supporting the
bill were 252 Democrats, 128 Republicans and
the one independent.
Quayle Outraged' at Trudeau
EL TORO, Calif. (AP) — Vice President Dan
Quayle yesterday accused "Doonesbuiy" cre
ator Garry Trudeau of having a personal
vendetta against him and said he is furious that
the cartoon strip is repeating allegations that he
used drugs.
"I don't mind a good political fight," Quayle
said. "But this is just totally absurd. It's wrong. It's
false. And I'm not surprised, but I am outraged."
