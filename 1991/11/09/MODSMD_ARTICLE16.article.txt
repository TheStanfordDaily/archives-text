## Sophomore QB Maddox leads Bruin offense 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
A year ago, in a game against
Stanford, UCLA found the
future. It lay in the capable arm
of a freshman from Bedford,
Texas. For in the third quarter of
that game against the Cardinal, a
young relief pitcher came out of
the bullpen to erase a 14 point
deficit and direct the Bruins to a
narrow one-point victory.
From then on it was history.
Tommy Maddox established him
self as the field general for
UCLA.
After passing for 244 yards
and two touchdowns in one half
of work against Stanford, Mad
dox threw for 353 yards in his
first full game at the helm
against nationally-ranked Michi
gan, and he continued to domi
nate opposing defenses for the
rest of the season, including a
school-record 409 yard effort
against crosstown rival USC. He
finished the year leading the
Pacific 10 Conference in total
offense and was second in passing
efficiency, and he racked up a
total of 2,682 yards in the air.
Maddox was named a 1990 first
team Freshman Ail-American,
was one of ten finalists for the
Davey O'Brien National Quarter
back Award, and received many
post-season accolades. Not bad
for a newcomer.
A very composed young man,
Maddox has had to face the chal
lenge of producing equal or better
numbers in his sophomore sea
son. But the fact that he was suc
cessful last year doesn't make
him feel that there is an extra
burden upon him.
"I think it popped the expecta

tions up a little bit, but I don't
think it put any added pressure
on me," he said. "I looked at last
year and thought that I could
improve upon it and do some
things better. I think I've accom
plished that. The pressure's
always going to be there when
you play quarterback at a major
university, and that's something
I enjoy and am happy to face up
to."
Maddox has been impressive
in UCLA's first eight games this
year. He is currently leading the
Pac-10 and is 18th nationally in
total offense (235.6 yards), and
ranks eleventh nationally and
second in the Pac-10 with a 149.6
passing efficiency. So far he has
passed for 1,889 yards on the sea
son, and this week has the poten
tial to become only the second
player in Bruin history to pass
for over 2,000 yards in two differ
ent seasons (now-Dallas Cowboy
quarterback Troy Aikman did it
in 1987 and 1988).
Since he made such great
progress in so little time, the
comparisons began early last
year, as Maddox was scrutinized
in respect to past Bruin signal
callers such as Aikman and Tom
Ramsey. But Maddox took it in
stride.
"It's tough because when you
first come out everybody's com
paring you to them and hoping
you live up to their expectations,
but it is also a great honor," said
Maddox. "When I go out on the
field, I can't worry about that. I
just have to go out there, play as
hard as I can, and hope that
everything works out.
Everything did in the past, for
Maddox is no stranger to success.
In his senior year at L.D. Bedford

High School in Hurst, Texas,
team captain Maddox passed for
2,601 yards and 18 touchdowns
and ran for an additional 400
yards, earning him first-team All-
State honors, District and Area
most valuable player awards, and
first-team prep All-America hon
ors from Parade and Super Prep
magazines. He averaged nearly a
triple-double in basketball with
35.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and
8.0 assists per game. Additional
ly, he went 7-1 as a baseball
pitcher and batted a strong .415.
Maddox is both the all-time pass
er in football and all-time scorer
in basketball in his high school's
history.
After such a solid high school
career, Maddox had scouts in his
home state drooling. So why did
he travel all the way out to Cali
fornia to play college football?
"When I was coming out, most of
the teams in Texas were either
running the ball or on proba
tion," Maddox said. "At the time,
I had to look elsewhere and
UCLA gave me the best opportu
nity."
That opportunity surfaced on
Sept. 15, 1990, when Maddox
replaced a struggling Jim Bonds
in the second half of UCLA's Pac
-10 opener against Stanford at the
Rose Bowl. He entrenched him
self in UCLA's quarterback slot
for the remainder of his career in
Westwood when he led the Bru
ins on a nine-play, 80-yard drive
with 1:14 left after John Hopkins
had kicked a field goal to put
Stanford ahead 31-29. But Mad
dox marched UCLA down the
field, and Brad Deluiso kicked a
21-yard field goal with 0:01 on

the clock to give UCLA a thrilling
32-31 comeback victory. Today,
Maddox faces his first victim again.
"I am excited. I have fond mem
ories of that game—that's when I
got my start," he commented.
"Stanford is a better team this
year, and they always play us
tough. It should be a good game."
Much of the time, Maddox oper
ates out of the shotgun in Homer
Smith's aerial offense. Hence his
nickname—Tommy 'Gun.' The
'Gun' has been firing bullets to his
talented receivers, especially his
favorite target, split end Sean
LaChapelle, who has caught 11 of
Maddox's 15 touchdown passes.
"I've been really blessed," he
remarked. I've been surrounded
by some really good receivers. I'm
lucky because some quarterbacks
don't have that advantage, and
I've always been able to throw to
anybody with confidence.
UCLA coach Terry Donahue is
very pleased to have Maddox as
the leader of the Bruin offense.
"He has a field presence about
him that is very, very important
in the quarterback position."
Stanford coach Dennis Green
said that UCLA's use of the shot
gun attests to Maddox's ability.
"(The shotgun) says the team
has a guy who can get rid of the
ball quickly. He's a talented play
er and is definitely one of the
best guys in the country."
Maddox's outstanding skill at
the quarterback position, as well
as his promising future, should
lead to a very lucrative profession
al career. But right now, Maddox
is a student-athlete, and unlike
many schools, he is concerned
about his classwork as well.
"It's always tough (to balance
school and football) during the
season . . . [but] right now
they're (academics) going really
well," he said. "I would love to
get a degree one day and hopeful
ly I will, and that's definitely one
of the goals in my fife."
Despite his personal success last
year, Maddox is happier this year
because the team is winning. "Even
though I was having some good
games last year, the team was losing
and it kind of takes away from
that," Maddox observed. "This year,
even when you have just an average
day, you win the game and feel 10
times better than going out and
breaking records and losing. It's just
a totally different feeling and one
that's much more enjoyable.
Tommy 'Gun's' chamber is
loaded, with many more oppo
nents left to throw smoke by. And
as far as he's concerned, UCLA is
a gold-plated holster. "I love it,"
he said. "I couldn't ask for any
thing better. I'm playing with a
great bunch of guys, I'm just a
sophomore and starting at a great
university like UCLA, and playing
the position I love to play."

the leader of the Bruin offense.
"He has a field presence about
him that is very, very important
in the quarterback position."
Stanford coach Dennis Green
said that UCLA's use of the shot
gun attests to Maddox's ability.
"(The shotgun) says the team
has a guy who can get rid of the
ball quickly. He's a talented play
er and is definitely one of the
best guys in the country."
Maddox's outstanding skill at
the quarterback position, as well
as his promising future, should
lead to a very lucrative profession
al career. But right now, Maddox
is a student-athlete, and unlike
many schools, he is concerned
about his classwork as well.
"It's always tough (to balance
school and football) during the
season . . . [but] right now
they're (academics) going really
well," he said. "I would love to
get a degree one day and hopeful
ly I will, and that's definitely one
of the goals in my fife."
Despite his personal success last
year, Maddox is happier this year
because the team is winning. "Even
though I was having some good
games last year, the team was losing
and it kind of takes away from
that," Maddox observed. "This year,
even when you have just an average
day, you win the game and feel 10
times better than going out and
breaking records and losing. It's just
a totally different feeling and one
that's much more enjoyable.
Tommy 'Gun's' chamber is
loaded, with many more oppo
nents left to throw smoke by. And
as far as he's concerned, UCLA is
a gold-plated holster. "I love it,"
he said. "I couldn't ask for any
thing better. I'm playing with a
great bunch of guys, I'm just a
sophomore and starting at a great
university like UCLA, and playing
the position I love to play."
A year ago, in a game against
Stanford, UCLA found the
future. It lay in the capable arm
of a freshman from Bedford,
Texas. For in the third quarter of
that game against the Cardinal, a
young relief pitcher came out of
the bullpen to erase a 14 point
deficit and direct the Bruins to a
narrow one-point victory.
From then on it was history.
Tommy Maddox established him
self as the field general for
UCLA.
After passing for 244 yards
and two touchdowns in one half
of work against Stanford, Mad
dox threw for 353 yards in his
first full game at the helm
against nationally-ranked Michi
gan, and he continued to domi
nate opposing defenses for the
rest of the season, including a
school-record 409 yard effort
against crosstown rival USC. He
finished the year leading the
Pacific 10 Conference in total
offense and was second in passing
efficiency, and he racked up a
total of 2,682 yards in the air.
Maddox was named a 1990 first
team Freshman Ail-American,
was one of ten finalists for the
Davey O'Brien National Quarter
back Award, and received many
post-season accolades. Not bad
for a newcomer.
A very composed young man,
Maddox has had to face the chal
lenge of producing equal or better
numbers in his sophomore sea
son. But the fact that he was suc
cessful last year doesn't make
him feel that there is an extra
burden upon him.
"I think it popped the expecta

tions up a little bit, but I don't
think it put any added pressure
on me," he said. "I looked at last
year and thought that I could
improve upon it and do some
things better. I think I've accom
plished that. The pressure's
always going to be there when
you play quarterback at a major
university, and that's something
I enjoy and am happy to face up
to."
Maddox has been impressive
in UCLA's first eight games this
year. He is currently leading the
Pac-10 and is 18th nationally in
total offense (235.6 yards), and
ranks eleventh nationally and
second in the Pac-10 with a 149.6
passing efficiency. So far he has
passed for 1,889 yards on the sea
son, and this week has the poten
tial to become only the second
player in Bruin history to pass
for over 2,000 yards in two differ
ent seasons (now-Dallas Cowboy
quarterback Troy Aikman did it
in 1987 and 1988).
Since he made such great
progress in so little time, the
comparisons began early last
year, as Maddox was scrutinized
in respect to past Bruin signal
callers such as Aikman and Tom
Ramsey. But Maddox took it in
stride.
"It's tough because when you
first come out everybody's com
paring you to them and hoping
you live up to their expectations,
but it is also a great honor," said
Maddox. "When I go out on the
field, I can't worry about that. I
just have to go out there, play as
hard as I can, and hope that
everything works out.
Everything did in the past, for
Maddox is no stranger to success.
In his senior year at L.D. Bedford

High School in Hurst, Texas,
team captain Maddox passed for
2,601 yards and 18 touchdowns
and ran for an additional 400
yards, earning him first-team All-
State honors, District and Area
most valuable player awards, and
first-team prep All-America hon
ors from Parade and Super Prep
magazines. He averaged nearly a
triple-double in basketball with
35.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and
8.0 assists per game. Additional
ly, he went 7-1 as a baseball
pitcher and batted a strong .415.
Maddox is both the all-time pass
er in football and all-time scorer
in basketball in his high school's
history.
After such a solid high school
career, Maddox had scouts in his
home state drooling. So why did
he travel all the way out to Cali
fornia to play college football?
"When I was coming out, most of
the teams in Texas were either
running the ball or on proba
tion," Maddox said. "At the time,
I had to look elsewhere and
UCLA gave me the best opportu
nity."
That opportunity surfaced on
Sept. 15, 1990, when Maddox
replaced a struggling Jim Bonds
in the second half of UCLA's Pac
-10 opener against Stanford at the
Rose Bowl. He entrenched him
self in UCLA's quarterback slot
for the remainder of his career in
Westwood when he led the Bru
ins on a nine-play, 80-yard drive
with 1:14 left after John Hopkins
had kicked a field goal to put
Stanford ahead 31-29. But Mad
dox marched UCLA down the
field, and Brad Deluiso kicked a
21-yard field goal with 0:01 on

Much of the time, Maddox oper

nickname—Tommy 'Gun.' The
'Gun' has been firing bullets to his
talented receivers, especially his
favorite target, split end Sean
LaChapelle, who has caught 11 of
Maddox's 15 touchdown passes.
"I've been really blessed," he
remarked. I've been surrounded
by some really good receivers. I'm

don't have that advantage, and
I've always been able to throw to
anybody with confidence.
