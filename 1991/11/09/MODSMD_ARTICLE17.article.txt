# It's not Big Game, but it's the biggest since '86
## 
### 
Denny Green has never
stalked the sidelines in a more
important game. No Cardinal
player has donned a jersey in a
contest with as much signifi
cance. No fan in the Stanford stu
dent section has been treated to a
pigskin affair as meaningful as
today's match-up with UCLA.
Indeed, this is far and away the
Cardinal's biggest game in five
years.
Granted, Stanford has pulled
off a few big upsets in the past half
decade. Nobody's discounting the
Miracle in South Bend. Nor have
we forgotten that Stanford has lost
just one Big Game in the last seven
seasons. But upsets and Axes con
sidered, let's face it: since its Gator
Bowl season of 'B6 the Cardinal
has failed to make a true impact on
the college football world:
All that could change today.
Whether coach Green or any
one else will admit it, this game
could be an incredible turning
point for a once-proud football
program that has spent five long
seasons in the doldrums. Not only
does Stanford have the opportu
nity to clinch only its second win
ning record in eleven years, but a
win today could signify a "new

beginning" for Cardinal foot
ball—a beginning which promises
to give birth to an era of bowl
games, prized recruiting classes,
All-American candidates, and
national rankings (not to mention
a few extra TV bucks).
Outside of clinching a winning
record, let's look at a few other
tangibles Stanford could achieve
by outscoring the Bruins:
• Its first season sweep of USC
and UCLA in 20 years. Not since
the days of Jim Plunkett and Don
Bunce has the Cardinal downed
both of its Southern Californian
rivals in the same year. Knocking
off interstate rivals always has a
positive, if subtle, effect on recruit
ing. And making a habit sweeping
the Trojans and Bruins wouldn't
be a bad idea—more often than not
the Run for the Roses has to pass
through Smog City.

•Its first bowl appearance in
five years, and only its second
since 1978. Assuming (as most
Pac-10 watchers do) that Stan
ford beats Washington State next
Saturday, a win today would
assure the Cardinal of a berth in
Anaheim's Freedom Bowl. Sure
we wouldn't be playing in a cool
city like Tuscon and we wouldn't
get a Weed Eater if we won, but
then again Anaheim takes a day
off for MLK and it doesn't it have
a neo-Nazi facelift running for
office. A Freedom Bowl appear
ance would give Stanford alumni
and a majority of students a legit
imate chance to watch the Cardi
nal in post-season action, some
thing that hasn't happened since
the '72 Rose Bowl, and something
that would certainly boost lagging
local support.
•Its first national ranking since
1986. Stanford, which has
received an increasing number of
votes in major polls as its winning
streak continued, would jump into
the top 25 with a victory over
22nd-ranked UCLA. You say
rankings don't mean anything?
Try telling that to Bruce Snyder
and his Golden Bears, whose sud
den, rapid ascension into the top

ten made them national media
darlings and helped instill in them
a confidence level no one could
have fathomed six weeks ago.
So the Cardinal can clinch a
winning season, a post-season
bid, and a national ranking with a
win today. All three have eluded
the team for half a decade, but
does that make today's game one
on which this program's future
could hinge? If you consider the
implications of a Stanford loss,
the answer is a resounding "yes."
A loss today would also deal a
huge blow to Cardinal bowl
hopes—Stanford would have to
beat WSU. then handle the
mighty Bears, who may be one of
the top five teams in the country
by November 23. Even with two
wins Stanford would have to hope
the Freedom Bowl doesn't get
anxious and offer its bids before
the Big Game.
Failing to beat UCLA would
leave the Cardinal with virtually no
hope of achieving a top-25 slot this
season. It would leave them staring
a mediocre 6-5 season in the face,
and even this winning record would
be a tad "tainted" by the NCAA's
decision not to count games against
Division I-AA teams (Cornell) in

post-season consideration. The
vaunted four-game winning streak,
during which the Cardinal has per
formed so brilliantly, might be dis
regarded as a couple of wins over
pathetic Cornell and Oregon State
teams, plus victories over an injury
decimated Oregon squad and the
worst USC team in a decade.
Maybe Cardinal fans know bet
ter, maybe even if we lose today and
finish 6-5 we'll know that we could
have played better or that we were
"the best 6-5 team in the country."
But maybe that's not good enough
for this program anymore.
In just three years, Green has
built a Stanford team that has
the talent to finish seasons
nationally-ranked, to finish sea
sons with a bowl appearance, to
finish seasons 9-3. Today they
have the opportunity to firmly
establish themselves as that kind
team. Let's hope they don't sell
themselves short.

Kevin Jeffery is still mourning the
tragedy that struck down one of
our nation's true heroes. Here's
hoping that Magic can enrich as
many lives in his new role of HIV
spokesperson as he did as the
goodwill ambassador of basketball.
