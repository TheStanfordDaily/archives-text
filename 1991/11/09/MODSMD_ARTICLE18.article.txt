# Transfer tight end makes transition
## 
### Peter Marks 
Ryan Wetnight, Cardinal tight
end, is not just a big man on cam
pus, he is a new man on campus.
The junior transferred to Stan
ford in January.
Wetnight captured the atten
tion of the Cardinal football pro
gram as a freshman at Fresno City
College when he caught twenty
five passes for 456 yards.
He improved those numbers as
a sophomore, snagging forty two
tosses for 787 yards. Wetnight's
performance earned him first
team JC Ail-American honors,
and he was named offensive
MVP of the Dairy Bowl.
Several Division I schools
recruited Wetnight after his spec
tacular season. A trip to the Farm,
however, convinced him to attend
Stanford.
A recipient of the Academic
Athlete of the Year award in high
school, Wetnight chose Stanford
largely because of its scholastic
reputation.
A desire to play in the Pacific-10
conference further persuaded him.
And, as with any Stanford student,
the sunshine helped finalize the
decision of this native Californian.
Wetnight's transition from
Fresno City to Stanford proved
tough in all respects.
Since he enrolled in January,
he did not enjoy the benefit of
going through orientation. Thus,
Wetnight was forced to learn his
way around campus through day
to-day experience.
Placed in Lagunita, Wetnight
encountered a more diversified
and more academically-oriented
student body than at Fresno City.
"It's a whole different world, a lot
tougher," he said.

In addition to confronting new
academic and social pressures,
Wetnight faced the athletic
demands that accompanied his
jump from JuCo level of play to
Division I.
"The first couple of weeks, it was
kind of intimidating, going to the
weight room with guys who I'd
seen playing on TV," Wetnight said.
Despite his initial anxiety,
Wetnight entered spring practice
knowing that he had a shot at
winning the starting tight end
position. Turner Baur continued
to rehabiliate a blown knee and
his replacement, Paul Nicker,
shifted to linebacker.
Moreover, the Cardinal coach
es were looking for a pass-receiver
type of tight end like Wetnight.
Baur, Nickel and third-stringer
Tony Cline were considered bet
ter blockers than receivers.
Wetnight did not disappoint.
He impressed Denny Green and
the other coaches and earned the
starting spot.
"Ryan is a quick, explosive
tight end who has the ability to
run with the ball after he catches
it," said Green. "He has tremen
dous hands and runs pass pat
terns extremely well."
The transfer shone against
Washington, his first Pac-10
game, with three catches. He
caught five more tosses against
Arizona, giving him a total of sev
enty four yards in two games.
"It's the same game, just at a
faster speed," said Wetnight. "I
think I picked up the offense pret
ty quick and fit in well with it."
"He's still making that transi
tion from JC up to the next level,
but the basics are there," said
receivers coach Brian Billick. "He
just needs to fine tune a little."

Junior tight end Ryan Wetnight has been effective in his backup
role. He is averaging just under 9 yards per catch.
