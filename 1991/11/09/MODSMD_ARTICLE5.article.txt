# Card seeks fifth straight
## Defense faces stiff test in Maddox 
### David Schwartz Editorial staff 
Bowl game. Think bowl game.
That's what Stanford and
UCLA are playing for today.
For Stanford, the win will
solidify the team's chances of
making its first bowl appearance
since 1986. UCLA, already hav
ing met the six victory require
ment to play in a bowl game, is
trying to move up from its No.
22 spot in the rankings with the
hope of playing in one of the
more elite bowls.
These teams have a lot in com
mon: Four straight wins, two at
home and two on the road; a
sophomore quarterback leading
the offense, with a senior as the
backup; and the hunger and
desire for victory.
Stanford (5-3, 3-2) enters
today's contest having won four
in a row, the longest Cardinal
winning streak since the 1986
squad opened the year with four
wins. Last Saturday, the Cardinal
traveled to Eugene, Ore., to man
handle the Oregon Ducks 33-13.
Steve Stenstrom paved the way

for Stanford on offense, complet
ing 12 of 22 passes for 147 yards
and three touchdowns, including
a 54-yarder to Jon Pinckney.
Senior Chris Walsh, ninth in the
nation in receiving yards per
game, caught Stenstrom's other
two TD passes. Glym Milburn
and Tommy Vardell each provid
ed consistent performances, tally
ing 70 and 43 yards on the day
respectively.
But the real story thus far for
the Cardinal has been the superb
play of the defense. The defense
held Oregon to only 47 yards
rushing and 172 yards total
offense in the victory last week.
Ranked second in the Pacific 10
Conference and 22nd in the
nation, the Cardinal defense has
asserted itself as a force to be
reckoned with. The man heading
the charge is outside linebacker
Ron George who is leading the
Stanford team with 51 tackles.
Last week, he had five unassisted
tackles, three tackles for a loss,
one quarterback sack and one
forced fumble. "Ron George is
playing some amazing football,"
said head coach Dennis Green.

UCLA coach Terry Donahue
added, "He is an extremely
impressive football player."
UCLA (6-2, 4-1) comes to the
Farm after thrashing the Wash
ington State Cougars 44-3 at the
Rose Bowl a week ago. The Bru
ins have lit up the scoreboard the
past four weeks, scoring 54, 44,
21, and 44 points in their victo
ries over Arizona, Oregon State,
Arizona State, and WSU. In last
week's victory, the Bruins
amassed 598 yards in total
offense and a school record 37
first downs. Sophomore quarter
back sensation Tommy Maddox
threw for 268 yards, completing
17 of 29 passes. Junior running
back Kevin Williams ran for 112
yards and three touchdowns, fill
ing in nicely for senior Shawn
Wills, who has missed UCLA's
last two games with a bruised
knee.
Offensively for the Bruins, the
biggest weapon to have emerged
this year is junior split end Sean
LaChapelle, who has established
himself as one of the premier

The Stanford defense hope to do a lot of celebrating today. If it can
shut down Tommy Maddox and the explosive Bruin offense, the
Cardinal could secure a Bowl bid.
receivers in the nation. He has
scored 11 touchdowns so far this
season, erasing the UCLA single
season school record of 10, and is
closing in on the Pac-10 season
record of 14. He leads the Pac-10
and is third nationally with an
average of 6.8 receptions per
game, and ranks seventh in the
country in receiving yards (97.9).
In the words of UCLA coach
-Terry Donahue, he is "a differ
ence maker, and there are not
many of them around."
Dennis Green recognizes the
versitility of the UCLA offense
and has many ideas to counter
the Bruin attack. "We're going
to show different looks. [The
Bruins] keep two backs in the
backfield and three receivers, so
we don't want to be blitzing too
much," Green said. "We need to
whip some blocks."
Senior strong safety Matt
Darby anchors a strong Bruin
defense, which is ranked second
in the Pac-10 in both rushing
and passing efficiency, and third
overall. Darby, a four-year
starter and pre-season All-Ameri
ca, leads the team with 56 tack
les, and is a candidate for the Jim
Thorpe Award, which is present
ed to the nation's top defensive
back. Junior Carlton Gray is tied
for the conference lead in inter
ceptions and is third nationally in
that category.
Donahue expects his Bruin
defense to have a tough task
ahead of them today in stopping
the Cardinal. "[Stanford is] a
team that is extremely physical
on the offensive line... [and] a
team that has real offensive
explosiveness," he said.
