# Walsh finds place among Pac-10 elite

What a difference three years
can make.
In 1988, with less than two min
utes left and Stanford trailing USC
16-7, a young wide receiver named
Chris Walsh and then quarterback
Steve Smith didn't connect on a
crucial "Cowboy," or corner route.
USC went on to triumph 24-20.
Three weeks ago, Walsh did con
nect with quarterback Steve Sten
strom on the same "Cowboy" play, a
12-yard toss into the end zone that
put the Cardinal up 24-21 and ended
15 years of frustration.
Yet the bizarre parallels
between the 1988 and 1991 USC
games don't stop there.
Three years ago Walsh collided
with USC safety Mark Carrier and
was knocked unconscious on a
read-seam play late in the first half
of his first collegiate game. He
dropped the ball.
In '9l, Walsh collided with anoth
er USC defensive back on the same
read-seam play late in the first half,
and suffered another mild concus
sion. This time he held on.
Despite the concussion, Walsh
returned in the second half to tally
102 of 174 career-high receiving
yards and catch the decisive touch
down. The 6-foot-l, 185-pound
Walsh takes it all in stride.
"I don't think about getting
crunched. Either way you're going
to get hit so you might as well catch
the ball," he said.
And Walsh has been catching
the pigskin. And catching. And
catching. He is second in the Pac-10
and seventh in the nation in recep

tions per game (6.3) and ranks
ninth in the country in receiving
yardage per game (91.4). A favorite
target, his 50 receptions for 731
yards in eight games puts him with
in reach of several Stanford receiv
ing records as well.
"He's so quick on the field. He
finds the holes and catches any
thing you put near him. He makes
you look good," said quarterback
Stenstrom.
Walsh credits his impressive
numbers to intense training and
preparation.
His pre-game locker room ritu
als prepare him as well. First,
Walsh flips through the playbook
for one final check. Then he
stretches out and breaks a sweat
before even hitting the field.
"I have to be flexible and loose
out there...l'm ready to play before
kickoff," Walsh said.
After playing catch with the
quarterback to warm up his hands,
he opens the Bible and prays,
Walsh says.
"It's the center of my life.
Everything else revolves around
it," Walsh said.
Once on the field, he pours the
same energy into reading defenses
and running his routes.
"I have to make sure I'm in the
right spot at the right time. The
quarterback throws expecting me to
be there. If I don't make the play,
its an incomplete pass, or worse, an
interception," Walsh said.
Walsh was nearly always in the
right spot at his alma mater, Ygna
cio Valley High School. Under the
careful eye of coach Kent Robie,
Walsh thrived at wide receiver as

well as free safety.
Evidently Robie's strategies paid
off: Ygnacio Valley went 9-3
Walsh's senior year, won its league
and earned a #3 ranking in North
ern California. Before graduating,
Walsh caught 157 passes for 2,340
yards and 24 TDs in three years.
The next logical step was college
ball, and the decision to come to Palo
Alto was easy for Walsh. Heavily
recruited, Walsh explained that
Stanford's proximity to Concord,
style of offense, and Pac-10 member
ship convinced him to enroll

"I wanted to stay close to home
... I wanted my parents to be
there for the games," Walsh said.
He redshirted his first year then
exploded for 480 yards receiving his
first season. But he "was nervous"
after sitting out a year of competition.
"Everything has to be more pre
cise [in college.] The routes have to be
sharper, can't cut any corners. You
can't drift out there," Walsh said.
Though Walsh continued to
improve, most passes were aimed at
All-American Ed McCaffrey, who
collected 917 yards receiving last

season before heading to the NFL.
But Walsh didn't mind waiting.
"I can't control whether or not
the quarter back will look my way.
I knew I'd get my chance after Ed
left," Walsh added.
And now that Walsh has taken
the receiving mantle from McCaf
frey, he's getting his share of atten
tion from NFL scouts too.
'We have scouts out there every
practice, every game. It's not good
to think about the future too much
because it takes away from what
I'm trying to do today," Walsh said.
