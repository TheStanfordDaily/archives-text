# Today's game – featuring student-athletes
## 
### 
Be thankful for what you are watching
today. The two teams on the field, Stanford
and UCLA, are model programs which have
to our knowledge avoided the vices pervad
ing college football in the present day.
On the grass of Stanford Stadium this
afternoon stand student-athletes, many on
scholarship. But that scholarship money is
the only money they are receiving from
outside sources. Stanford and UCLA are
outstanding academic institutions that
happen to have winning football teams,
not places which have pigskin powers that
also happen to offer classes.
"So what?" you say. "I'm watching
smart kids playing football. Leave me
alone and let me watch the game."
But you are the fortunate fan. Your
team hasn't been ridiculed with illegal pay
ments, greed, or bad attitudes. Let me
watch the game you say. Ah, if it were only
that simple.
Let me tell you about what you're not

seeing today. Eric Ramsey, a former defen
sive back at Auburn University, has recent
ly revealed that he has tapes of conversa
tions that occurred between himself and
alumni boosters offering him cash and
other enticements, violating NCAA rules.
What is interesting is that Ramsey probably
would not have said anything about those
tapes if he had not been cut by the NFL's
Kansas City Chiefs. With a six figure con
tract, why would Ramsey have needed to
reveal anything about the little "perks" he
received while playing for the Tigers. "

But now, with the hopes of a pro career
dashed, something that Ramsey had
focused the past four years of his life aim
ing for, Ramsey needed some form of
recourse to make up for that lost income.
He can't get a regular, non-sports related
job because Auburn failed to provide him
with what universities are supposed to
provide—an education. Oh sure, he
learned one thing: to take money when it is
offered to you. And on that lesson, this
time Ramsey is the lecturer of the class.
What was his opportunity cost for play
ing out his heart for Auburn only to fall
short of his dream while not learning any
sciece, or humanitites, or arts that could
get him a job in the working world. Zero.
Because of the Auburn Lesson to take
as much as you can, Ramsey is just fine.
He is releasing the tapes slowly to The
Birmingham News, and is being paid a
tidy sum for doing so. Auburn coach Pat
Dye is complaining that these allegations

are ruining his program. But it is pro
grams like Dye's and those at many other
schools, which are ruing the youth which
they are claiming to help. Players are seen
as mere marketing tools to bring in money
from alumni (in the form of official dona
tions to the athletic department), ticket
sales, television networks and bowl games.
Is it any wonder that Ramsey is trying
to make money by exposing the entity
which made money on him and then dis
carded him for the new meat? Ramsey's
greed gets rewarded while Auburn's greed
gets punished. Greed is taking over much
of college athletics, and it was only a matter
of time before the players got in on the act.
Under the table payments have been a
problem for years in college sports. Alumni
are eager to support their teams and some
times may break the rules. But at least at
UCLA (whose basketball team was put on
