# Today's game – featuring student-athletes
## 
### 
Be thankful for what you are watching
today. The two teams on the field, Stanford
and UCLA, are model programs which have
to our knowledge avoided the vices pervad
ing college football in the present day.
On the grass of Stanford Stadium this
afternoon stand student-athletes, many on
scholarship. But that scholarship money is
the only money they are receiving from
outside sources. Stanford and UCLA are
outstanding academic institutions that
happen to have winning football teams,
not places which have pigskin powers that
also happen to offer classes.
"So what?" you say. "I'm watching
smart kids playing football. Leave me
alone and let me watch the game."
But you are the fortunate fan. Your
team hasn't been ridiculed with illegal pay
ments, greed, or bad attitudes. Let me
watch the game you say. Ah, if it were only
that simple.
Let me tell you about what you're not

seeing today. Eric Ramsey, a former defen
sive back at Auburn University, has recent
ly revealed that he has tapes of conversa
tions that occurred between himself and
alumni boosters offering him cash and
other enticements, violating NCAA rules.
What is interesting is that Ramsey probably
would not have said anything about those
tapes if he had not been cut by the NFL's
Kansas City Chiefs. With a six figure con
tract, why would Ramsey have needed to
reveal anything about the little "perks" he
received while playing for the Tigers. "

But now, with the hopes of a pro career
dashed, something that Ramsey had
focused the past four years of his life aim
ing for, Ramsey needed some form of
recourse to make up for that lost income.
He can't get a regular, non-sports related
job because Auburn failed to provide him
with what universities are supposed to
provide—an education. Oh sure, he
learned one thing: to take money when it is
offered to you. And on that lesson, this
time Ramsey is the lecturer of the class.
What was his opportunity cost for play
ing out his heart for Auburn only to fall
short of his dream while not learning any
sciece, or humanitites, or arts that could
get him a job in the working world. Zero.
Because of the Auburn Lesson to take
as much as you can, Ramsey is just fine.
He is releasing the tapes slowly to The
Birmingham News, and is being paid a
tidy sum for doing so. Auburn coach Pat
Dye is complaining that these allegations

are ruining his program. But it is pro
grams like Dye's and those at many other
schools, which are ruing the youth which
they are claiming to help. Players are seen
as mere marketing tools to bring in money
from alumni (in the form of official dona
tions to the athletic department), ticket
sales, television networks and bowl games.
Is it any wonder that Ramsey is trying
to make money by exposing the entity
which made money on him and then dis
carded him for the new meat? Ramsey's
greed gets rewarded while Auburn's greed
gets punished. Greed is taking over much
of college athletics, and it was only a matter
of time before the players got in on the act.
Under the table payments have been a
problem for years in college sports. Alumni
are eager to support their teams and some
times may break the rules. But at least at
UCLA (whose basketball team was put on

probation in the early 80's due to
the loose wallet of booster Sam
Gilbert), and at Stanford (should
it ever occur), athletes are not
devastated to the point where
they feel they have no purpose at
the school. Sure they are disap
pointed that their performance in
their sport is limited, but the
other half of the equation, the
academic half, still exists and
thrives for them.
Greed is extending even to the
best programs. Notre Dame had
the highest graduation rate for
football players of any school in
the country last year. More than
90% of the Irish gridders got
their diplomas, meaning that
they had other options besides
professional football. But the
Irish also signed an exclusive
television contract with NBC for
all of its home games for the next
four years. This contract is going
to bring in millions of dollars to
the athletic coffers. Whatever
happened to the notion of college
kids putting on pads and going at
it for the pride of their school?
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
saying that Stanford and UCLA
don't accept television money.
They do and should. But there is
a difference between being
approached by a network and it
asking to televise a game, as
opposed to a school selling its
games to the highest bidder.
Stanford and UCLA are rela
tively devoid of greed and illegal
payments. But they also have
something else, an intangible, an
intangible which speaks of the
quality of people that attend the
schools—class.
Recently, our neighbors across
the bay, the California Golden
Bears, pummeled the USC Tro
jans 52-30. Cal was extremely
proud after the game. There is
nothing wrong with that, for
most teams would take pleasure
in defeating a traditionally
strong team. But there is some
thing wrong with what the Cal
players and staff said after the
game: "Their program is in disar
ray"; "They didn't come to play"
and other more pointed com
ments. It is one thing to beat a
team on the field and play hard,
but that agression should remain
on the field.
Yes, this time USC was out
matched, but that is no excuse to
rub their noses in it. Part of
sports is the ability to be able to
deal with outcomes once the
games are completed and that
means to be gracious in victory as
well as defeat. It would have been
fine for the Bear players to think
what they said and have been
more diplomatic in their
remarks. Sportsmanship is just
as important as competition
itself.
So today, when economics
major Glyn Milburn returns a
punt for the Cardinal, or sociolo
gy major Sean LaChapelle catch
es a pass for the Bruins, be con
tent in knowing that they have
educations to fall back on if a pro
career doesn't work out. Players
at these schools are student-ath
letes, not athletes (oh, and if you
want, take some classes while
you're here).
Pay attention to the com
ments made in the post-game
interviews and notice the
demeanor of the athletes. Rest
well with the knowledge that
Stanford and UCLA athletes are
not wired with tape recorders out
of greed to make money, for they
know that their instituions care
about them as people, not merely
as box office enticements.
Now you can watch the game.

David Schwartz, a diehard Laker
fan, wants to express his utmost
sorrow about the illness that has
befallen Magic Johnson. The
world has lost a great sportsman,
but the kind, giving person is still
thriving. Magic, fight on, for now
more than ever,."it's winning
time."
