# UCLA/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Tommy "Gun" Maddox, the
Pac-10 leader in total offense,
directs a potent, efficient passing
attack against Ron George and
the Cardinal defense, ranked
second in the Pac-10. If George,
team leader with five sacks and
15 tackles for a loss, and fellow
"G-man" Dave Garnett can
apply consistent pressure, it will
be another long day for the oppo
sition quarterback. If not, Mad
dox might pick the Stanford sec
ondary apart.

Arguably the top receiver in
the Pac-10, Sean LaChapelle is
steadily marching towards the
Pac-10 single-season touchdown
reception record of 14. But
LaChapelle won't have an easy
time against Darrien Gordon
and the Cardinal secondary, who
have allowed the fewest total
passing yards in the Pac-10 and
only nine passing touchdowns all
season.

Returning from a sprained
ankle two weeks ago, Kevin
Williams is averaging more than
100 yards per game on the
ground and leads a the other half
of UCLA's balanced offensive
attack. Coy Gibbs, a true fresh
men, was last week's Pac-10
defensive player of the week after
a dominating performance
against Oregon with 11 tackles
four for a loss. But Gibbs and the
Stanford defense, which has
yielded only 150 rushing yards
per game, will have a tough
assignment in stopping Williams.

Pre-season All-American
Matt Darby leads UCLA with 56
tackles and is a front-runner for
the Jim Thorpe award, present
ed to the nation's top defensive
back. With two interceptions and
three sacks this season, Darby
often roves throughout the field,
creating havoc for opposing
quarterbacks. Steve Stenstrom
is the first Stanford quarterback
since 1952 to win his first four
starts. Stenstrom is ranked third
in the Pac-10, having thrown for
nine touchdowns and only three
interceptions.

Carlton Gray's six intercep
tions are third-best in the
nation, and he leads the Pac-10's
second-ranked passing defense.
Gray usually lines up against the
opposition's top receiver in man
to-man coverage, and that's
exactly what he will do this week
as he tries to shut down Chris
Walsh. Averaging more than 90
receiving yards per game, Walsh
is ranked seventh in the nation
in average receptions, and he
looks to be Stenstrom's prime
target again today.

Equally horrendous, but
choose your danger. The San
Diego Freeway is a parking lot
where smog and exhaust fumes
are sucked into your air vents.
You might see some Hollywood
types, but don't look too closely
and keep your bulletproof win
dows up, for the guy on your left
might open fire. The 880 locally
can cause you to idle for long peri
ods of time, but steer clear of the
bridges. The last place you want to
be is on one of these ancient struc
tures when the next massive
tremblor hits. Now that's down
shifting.
