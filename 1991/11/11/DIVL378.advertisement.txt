To the millions who admired them and
courted their favor, Henry and Clare Boothe
Luce were two of the most influential
figures of their times. He was the publisher
of Time, Life, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated,
a man befriended by popes and presidents.
She was one of the most important women
in the Republican Party. Together they
seemed invincible, a couple whose
professional success was matched only by
their personal happiness. Yet the image of
contentment they so carefully cultivated
was not what it seemed.

Henry and Clare is the poignant story
of their extraordinary triumphs and
deep sorrows. Cast against some of
the great historical moments of the
century, it is a portrait of two
individuals who could influence,
even control, world events â€” but not
their own private impulses.
