BY STARING AT HAND!
F
Stop by ArtCarved's display to relive your
college memories and receive a special aiscount.
A shy college student is believed to be the first
animal husbandry major to have discovered a
past life by staring at their hand.
"Actually, you need an Art Carved college
ring. With it, I can remember all the way back
to my freshman year. In the future, 1 hope to
relive more pleasant experiences," said the
agrarian senior.
This ring was custom-designed to tell the
animal husbandry major's personal story. Like
all finely crafted Art Carved rings it comes with
a lifetime guarantee.
"I'd really like to relive my last physics final.
It would sure help my average if I could do that
over again." So far the ring has proved ineffective
in improving past life perfomiance.
