A Different School of Thought
"Before I worked at Saturn, I was an intern at another company.
In that situation, students were pretty much brought in and given busy
work. Work, that if students didn't do it, wouldn't have been done
anyway.
"There was not much responsibility but a lot of animosity
between the new younger engineers and the older veterans. They really
didn't help you much.
"Here it's totally opposite. I go to product development team
meetings. I sit in there and people turn and look at me and say, 'What
do you think?"
'There is a ton of stuff that I'm doing that is important. Maybe
not today, maybe not tomorrow, but some time in the future, maybe â€”
my ideas could be actually implemented on the car. I could go to a
Saturn retail facility and say, 'See that right there? I helped do that.'
"Day before yesterday, I had to drive a Saturn from the proving
grounds, which is about 45 minutes west of where we are located in
Troy, Michigan. As I'm driving down the highway, people are speeding
up and slowing down to get next to the car to look at it.
'There's so much interest. And to
get in on the ground floor of a company
that's sparking that kind of interest is an
opportunity I could not let go by."
