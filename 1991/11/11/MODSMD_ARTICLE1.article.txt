# One giant leap...
## Card bounds closer to bowl bid with win over UCLA 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer Amy Howard Staff writer 
After Stanford's convincing
27-10 victory over UCLA on
Saturday, Cardinal outside
linebacker Ron George sat in
the locker room and decided it
was time to put into words
what he and his defensive
mates had been doing the last
few games.
"We are making a huge state
ment," the junior said. "The
Cardinal defense is no joke."
Then he broke into a short
rap that seemed to say it all.
"Too legit," the defensive
star sang, "too legit to quit."
After what Stanford did to
the Bruins, calling the Cardi
nal legitimate is more than
fair. Stanford's fifth straight
win improved the team's
record to 6-3 (4-2 in the Pacific
10 Conference), ensuring its
first winning season since
1986 and garnering the Cardi
nal a No. 22 ranking in this
week's Associated Press poll.

terback nicknamed "Gun," but an
elaborate Cardinal defensive
scheme helped him to misfire.
The Bruins had been winning
all season with Tommy Maddox
throwing to his favorite receiver
Sean LaChapell, and Stanford
defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
made sure that his defense
adjusted to eliminate that threat.
Focusing on LaChapell and
aggressively attacking the Bruin
offense, Stanford forced Maddox
to spend most of the game trying
to go for the long pass. Yet the
balls fell, and so did the Bruins.
"We didn't give him a chance
to be on (his game)," Shaw said.
"It was the schemes we played.
We played an NFL-style game, we
played different coverages, we
played zones, we blitzed; he's only
a sophomore, he'd never seen
anything like that before."
While Maddox was having his
problems, Stanford quarterback
Steve Stenstrom was having a
field day. Like Maddox, Sten
strom found his primary receiver
Chris Walsh covered most of the
day, but lucky for the Cardinal,
flanker Jon Pinckney more than
picked up the slack.
After struggling for most of the
season to get open, Pinckney
came up with big catch after big
catch, providing the offensive
spark Stanford needed. The
senior ended the day with five

catches for 159 yards, 66 of them
coming on a touchdown pass that
might have been the turning
point of the game.
After taking a 14-3 first-half
lead on the strength of Tommy
Vardell and Chris Walsh touch
downs, the Cardinal watched as
the Bruin offense woke up and
used its first possession of the sec
ond half to march 75 yards on 11
plays for a Kevin Williams touch
down that cut the lead to 14-10.
Yet as has been the Stanford
way of late, the Cardinal rose to
the occasion. Stanford started its
next drive on its own 28, and after
Vardell went up the middle for six
yards, Stenstrom went deep for
six points.
On second and four, Stenstrom
found Pinckney streaking down

the left side and decided to go for
it all. UCLA cornerback Carlton
Gray was matching Pinckney
stride for stride and found the ball
headed right for him. Both men
went up for the ball, but it was
Pinckney's fingers that grabbed
the pigskin. The surprised Bruin
defender was then knocked down
by pursuing teammate Othello
Henderson, and Pinckney waltzed
in the end zone for the score.
"Gray played it real well,"
Pinckney said. "It was just one of
those things. Somebody was going
to come down with it, and I did."
The pass was the third TD toss of
the day for Stenstrom, capping a
performance that saw him com
plete 14 of 23 passes for 261 yards
and throw one interception. On a
day where the Cardinal running

game only produced 113 yards
(109 coming from Vardell), the
Stanford air attack arguably had
one of its best days of the season.
"We really opened it up,"
Pinckney said. "The (UCLA)
defense had to worry about stop
ping Tommy (Vardell). They had
to worry about stopping Glyn
(Milburn); I knew that sooner or
later I'd get open on the deep
routes."
Up 21-10, the Stanford defense
took over the game and made sure
UCLA would score no more. The
Bruins got the ball back and had
no gain on first down and a loss of
seven on second down. Then Mad
dox threw an interception to end
UCLA's offensive threat. Again
Stanford made good on its chance
— with a 25-yard Aaron Mills

field goal — to make it 24-10 in
favor of the Cardinal.
Down two touchdowns, but
with more than a quarter left to
play, the Bruins drove 67 yards to
the Stanford 14 and looked to cut
the Cardinal lead in half, but
Stanford's defense would not
budge. Blitzing inside linebacker
Tom Williams pressured Maddox
to rush his pass, forcing a fumble.
Williams recovered the ball,
but UCLA never recovered its
composure. The closest the Bru
ins came to scoring thereafter was
a missed 45-yard field goal try on
its next possession. Mills would
connect on a 22-yarder in the mid
dle of the fourth quarter to end
the scoring at 27-10 in Stanford's
favor.
"I was surprised we held them

to only 10 points with Maddox
and LaChapell," Vardell said. "I
was really impressed with our
defense — they definitely showed
(their talent) today."
The Cardinal now must shift
its attention up north. Washing
ton State has a good quarterback
and an offense that has been pil
ing up points all season. The
Stanford defense will once again
be put to the test, but at least now
its legitimacy is no longer in
doubt.
Card Notes
Stanford has not beaten both USC
and UCLA in the same season since
1971. The last time California and
Stanford beat both southern Califor
nian teams in the same year was
1941.

In the Cardinal's 27-10 drubbing of the Bruins,
there were many spectacular individual perfor
mances by the familiar big players. Quarterback
Steve Stenstrom chalked up his fifth win in his fifth
start. Fullback Tommy Vardell rushed for over 100
yards and a touchdown. Outside linebacker Ron
George sent Tommy Maddox packing.
And senior flanker Jon Pinckney made the big
plays at the crucial moments, including a 66-yard
touchdown reception that broke the game open.
Now for those of you scratching your heads and
wondering how you've managed to miss the big
Pinckney story, do not be alarmed. This is the first
chapter of it this season. And although it has taken
him a little while to write it, he did so in a big way on
Saturday.
The scenario was this: With 10:19 left in the third
quarter, UCLA had just scored a touchdown on a 9-
yard run by Kevin Williams to bring the Bruins to
within four points of the Cardinal. On second down
and four, Stenstrom looked to the left side of the
field and found Pinckney. Under heavy coverage by
cornerback Carlton Gray, Pinckney came down with
the ball, faked a little, and sprinted into the end zone
for the 66-yard touchdown.
This gave Stanford a huge psychological boost,
pushing the score to 21-10. And Pinckney wasn't fin
ished yet. With 8:00 left in the game, he beat out
Gray once again for a 42-yard reception that set up a
22-yard field goal by Aaron Mills. By the end of the
night, he had made five grabs for 159 yards. Every
catch he made resulted in a first down. In short, he
was red hot.
Wide receiver Chris Walsh praised his teammate's
efforts. "They were going man-to-man and shading

the guy over on me and Jon was
getting one-on-one to the post,"
he said. "He had a great game,
going up and battling over people
and catching the ball."
Walsh has been such a domi
nant force, with an average of 91
receiving yards per game and 780
yards on the season, that it has
been easy to overlook Pinckney
running his patterns downfield.

Pinckney began the season
with a strong performance
against the Washington Huskies,
making six receptions for 63
yards. Then came a six-game dry
spell, during which he caught the
ball only four times for 56 yards.
The tide began to turn a week ago
versus Oregon, and it now
appears that he is riding in on the
wave of the Cardinal's success.
"It was rough in the beginning
of the season," Pinckney said. "I
just kept on playing and hanging
in there, and now things are
starting to come my way."
