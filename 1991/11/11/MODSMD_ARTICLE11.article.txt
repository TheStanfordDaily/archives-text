## Lip service 
### 
The University should
maintain student input
in selection processes

FEW ENVIED ACTING Vice
President of Student Re
sources Sally Mahoney last
week, who discovered on the front
page of The Daily that she was not
the choice of the students inter
viewing candidates for the position
she temporarily holds.
University President Donald
Kennedy called the revelation a
"breach of security" and hinted
that student involvement in
University decisions may be
severely curtailed because of the
"patently foolish" behavior of
students.
Kennedy may be rightfully
upset at the outcome of events, but
his assessment of blame is partial
ly incorrect and his threat to limit
student participation on Universi
ty committees is improper.
There are occasions where
secrecy is important in University
deliberations and this search may
have been one of them. Not every
decision calls for public assess
ment; judgments are subjective,
issues are sensitive and public
opinion is not necessarily in
formed.
In an employment search, the
candidates themselves may expect
or demand secrecy as a prerequi
site for consideration. If a commit
tee agrees beforehand that deliber
ation requires confidentiality, that
decision should be respected by
committee members, even those
who disagree with the final result,
unless there is a gross miscarriage
of process.
However, stipulating that confi
dentiality may be important does
not establish it as an ironclad rule.
The four student members who
interviewed candidates have stated
publicly that they did not know the
administration expected their con
clusions to remain secret. Confi

dentiality was not explicitly called
for and apparently was not direct
ly implied.
Kennedy has responded that the
students "should have known bet
ter." Granted, the students' deci
sions to speak did not demonstrate
good judgment. The publicity,
however, did inform the communi
ty something it had a right to
know: who students thought was
the best for the job.
Furthermore, to demand blan
ket confidentiality may reduce stu
dent input to only lip-service. Who
would know what students
thought unless they were allowed
to make it public?
If the University envisions that
students have any role larger than
silent witnesses legitimizing deci
sions that are handed down from
above, it must expect they will
develop their own opinions and
express them.
Last week's revelation revealed
a fault in the process. Require
ments for confidentiality, or any
other aspect of University deci
sion-making, ought to be made
explicit if they are important.
It is unfair for President
Kennedy to suggest that students'
roles in University committees
might be curtailed because of last
week's incident. It sends a harm
ful message to members of Stan
ford who wonder what direction
its new president will take, when
chosen.
Taken at face value, Kennedy's
comments imply that student
involvement in campus decisions is
a privilege, not a right. However,
given his own promotion of stu
dent involvement during his years
at Stanford, Kennedy seems to
believe that student participation
in major campus decisions is both
effective and just.
Now that the search for a new
president is underway, it should be
made clear that student participa
tion ought to have a stronger foun
dation than the noblesse oblige of
the President. In his actions, if not
in his words, we hope Kennedy
reaffirms this commitment.
