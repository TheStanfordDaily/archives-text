'Gone With the Wind 9 highlights human condition

WHEN POLITICAL correctness
makes us avert our eyes from a
very real and troubling page of
our past, it has gone too far. Daniel
Rosen's column on Nov. 7 chastised us
for not walking out of "Gone With the
Wind" to protest its "rosy picture of
slavery." What did he expect?
To understand the movie, one must
first understand its author, Margaret
Mitchell, a Southerner reared on sto
ries of the "glorious" Old South. She
wove characters from her own life into
the book. Yet, with a wealth of first-

hand stories from which she could
have written her novel, she spent
years in research to guarantee the his
torical accuracy of every detail. Our
problem with her work is that it was
not a story of slaves, it was a story of
slave-owners. Today, the latter are far
harder to empathize with than the for
mer.
Every perception in the story is the
perception of a Southerner from the Old
South. Though repugnant (I hope) to
most of us, it is not "offensive." It is an
accurate representation of how planta

tion owners viewed the world — as
racists who saw little wrong with the
institution of slavery. Their view of slav
ery was rosy, so the view we get through
the eyes of Scarlett is equally rosy. If we
walked away from learning about the
ugly side of history, we would know very
little history.
This movie should not be condemned
for being "good drama." It should be
lauded. It takes a people who many of us
find reprehensible and makes them
human. If we can love and identify with
Scarlett and Melanie, we suddenly real

ize that the world is not as simple as it
seems.
The tragedy of war happens because
we dehumanize our enemies. Convincing
ourselves of their worthlessness is the
only way we can justify such purposeful
and brutal destruction. But, give those
people a face, laugh and cry with them,
then maybe, no matter how vehemently
we disagree with their beliefs, we will be
more willing to find other solutions than
war. What could be more "good"?
