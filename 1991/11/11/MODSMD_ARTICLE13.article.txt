# Stigma of rape remains too high to report name of victim without consent
## 
### 
I thought the letter from the editor in
The Daily (Nov. 1) was well-written and
showed a great deal of thought on the
matter of reporting on rape; however, I
must disagree with one point. The names
of adult rape survivors should be run in
the newspaper only with the consent of
the survivor.
While I agree that concealing the name
of the rape survivor adds to the stigma
surrounding this crime and that only by
reporting these names will this stigma be
overcome, I also feel that, as long as this
stigma exists, the survivor's feelings
must be considered above any societal
benefits from reporting her name. Rape is
a terrible ordeal for anyone to survive
and printing the survivor's name without
her consent will only add to her anguish
and make her recovery more difficult.
It is my deepest desire that The Daily
staff need never suffer over whether to
print the name of a rape survivor, but,
should that need ever arise, I hope they
will keep this in mind.
