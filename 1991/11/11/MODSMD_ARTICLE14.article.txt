# Middle East panel discussion violated the sanctity of the Sabbath
## 
### 
In light of the spirit of the talks them
selves, it is a shame that the Lutheran
Campus Ministry and the Organization
of Arab American Students held a panel
discussion about the Middle East peace
conference at 7 p.m. on a Friday night
(Nov. 8), when Jewish members of the
community are celebrating the Sabbath.
