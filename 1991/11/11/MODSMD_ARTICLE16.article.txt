# University action at ASSU Senate meeting smacked of arrogance
## 
### 
The discussion on the proposed
Committee of 15 amendments to the
Judicial Charter at the Nov. 5 ASSU
Senate meeting involved one of the
most egregious attempts by the
administration to push its agenda on
students we have ever seen. Adminis
tration officials who attended the
meeting, upon finding that the Senate
was not entirely amenable to the pro
posed changes, told us that the Senate

was making an "uninformed" decision.
We suspect that had the Senate been
in favor of the proposed amendments,
they would have urged us to show our
support for it, as they did at the senate
meeting just two weeks before. To sug
gest that ASSU senators, who are elected
officials of the student body, are not in a
position to pass judgment on these pro
posed charges is patronizing and insult
ing to the senate and the student body.
