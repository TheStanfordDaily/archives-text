## The 						power of Magic 
### 
Last Thursday was a perfect
day. I was nearly finished with all of
my work for the week and I had
already made plans for the weekend. The
sun was shining, the sky was blue and I
finally had a financial aid package. Life
was looking like a good thing.
And then a guy on the radio said that
Magic Johnson had tested HIV positive.
Along with the rest of America, I was
shocked. Magic is a part of that class of
beings who cease to be human and cross
into immortality. Magic is one of those
people you just know. It was impossible to
believe that what I was hearing was true.
Even harder to fathom was the
amount of ignorance that came to the
surface. The disc jockey opened the mike
and let Bay Area residents say what was
on their minds and in their hearts. Most
people spoke of Magic in the past tense,
as if he was already dead, eulogized and
buried. They said they couldn't believe
Magic had AIDS. One man came out and
said that he was hurt because he didn't
know "Magic was like that," meaning
gay. The local and national news, mostly
through man-on-the-street interviews,
had much of the same feel.
Magic does not have AIDS. He has test
ed positive for the HIV virus, meaning
that he is producing antibodies to the HIV
antigen in his body. He could get very sick
and develop full-blown AIDS at any time.
But he could also live another decade or

more, raising his child and leading a
healthy, happy and productive life.
More importantly, the truth that
Magic has the HIV virus does not equal
the lie that Magic must be gay. America
does not like to talk about AIDS because
we see it as a "them" disease. It happens
to "them," the "undesirables" of our
community, the gays and the drug users.
Gay sex and intravenous drug use are not
exactly staples of polite conversation, so
we shy away from this disease that is a
product of "deviant" types of behavior.
When we hear that someone has AIDS,
we lump them into that nasty "them"
category.
If we can't put them into that group we
paint a picture of them as martyrs unjust
ly felled to a disease that belongs to
"them." We put the Kimberly Bergalises
of the world, the people that don't deserve
this, forth as examples of how these unde
sirables are bringing us down. We won't
allow our kids to play with kids who have
the disease. We treat infected people in
professions that have nothing to do with
intimate contact like the plague. We won't
educate ourselves, but we'll spread the
lies and hate like wildfire.
The main reason we do this is fear. As
long as AIDS is a "them" disease and we
don't fit the criteria that belong to
"them," we are safe. It doesn't matter
that we have unsafe heterosexual sex. It
doesn't matter that we choose our part

ners indiscriminately, neither providing
nor procuring relevant details about sex
ual pasts. It doesn't matter that we avoid
the doctors, passing this and other dis
eases along for unknown lengths of time.
We are young, we are heterosexual, we
are immortal — we "do the right thing"
and we are not "them."
Perhaps the only good that will come
out of this tragedy is that Magic will be
able to use his influence to teach the
facts. Money has already been donated to
whatever foundation or organization he
chooses to create or support. Magic has
admitted that he got the disease by
"messing around with too many girls."
This admission and his efforts will teach
people that HIV can infect "normal" peo
ple having sex in "normal" ways.
A guest on "Nightline" the other night
said he felt that Magic would become a
pariah in a short while. If he is right and
we don't educate, research and under
stand more about the disease, then more
beautiful days will be interrupted by such
announcements about people like Magic,
if not our ourselves.
