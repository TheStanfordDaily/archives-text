# Planting helps save Foothills
## 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
For the eighth year in a row, Stanford students
and local residents are helping to give the Foothills
above Stanford a new lease on life.
Under the direction of a local ecology organiza
tion, oak trees and wild grasses are being planted in
an attempt to reverse decades of vegetative decline
caused by grazing and drought. This year's plantings
are part of the ongoing effort to reforest the area.
In 1983, the organization Magic Inc. was called
in by Stanford's Planning Office to organize the
planting effort after a survey showed that many old
trees were dying and few young ones were growing
in their place. Tree cover had diminished by almost
30 percent from its 1928 level.
Valley oak, blue oak and coast live oak trees, the
three varieties of oak trees native to the area, are
being planted this year, according to Magic's Carl
Wittenberg. In addition, native grass known as Cal
ifornia bunch grass is being sown to cover the slopes
of the hills. The grass that now covers most of the
hills is not native but was introduced from Europe.
The decline of the oaks can be attributed to two
main sources: cattle grazing and drought conditions.
Cattle, which graze in the Foothills during the
winter, eat most of the young seedlings they can
find. "This has blocked almost all regeneration over
the past 50 years," Wittenberg said.
Drought, too has taken its toll on the trees. Most
of the aging trees have been stressed by the heat
and the drop in ground water caused by Stanford's
use of well water. Moreover, in times of drought,
acorn production drops to very low levels, thereby
decreasing regeneration rates.
"Acorn production this year has been abysmal in
the Palo Alto vicinity," according to Wittenberg.
Some people speculate smog may also be affect
ing the trees, Wittenberg said, but this has not been
conclusively established yet.
To help ensure the success of the program, Stan
ford has barred grazing on several hundred acres of
land. Eventually, the whole area may be fenced off
for an extended period in order to allow the region
to return to its former state.
Stanford provides the materials and subsidizes
Magic's efforts to organize volun
teers and provide care to the
seedlings. Groups of local Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts, workers
from nearby firms and high-school
students have all pitched in to
replant the area.
This year, several campus
groups are also involved in the
effort. On Nov. 2, several dormi
tories planted trees as part of
"Reach Out Today," a program
designed to channel the energies
of Stanford students into various
community-service projects
throughout the Bay Area. And
this Saturday, students and
alumni brought together by Stan
ford Student Alumni Network
(STAN) will be planting.
According to sophomore Lau
rie Kinsey, director of public ser
vice for STAN, "It's a great way
for alumni who can't give to Stan
ford monetarily to give some
thing back, and our effort will
allow students to meet and work
with alumni in a meaningful way.
"This project is just one way
we're trying to bring alumni and
students together through public
service."
Since 1984, 2,600 trees have
been planted under the direction
of Magic.
"Over the years, we've learned to
plant smaller numbers (of trees) and
devote more attention to maintain
ing them," Wittenberg said. "Ten
times as much labor is necessary to
keep a tree alive in drought condi
tions than in normal conditions."
