Native Americans: Let the truth of our people be heard

I am writing to express my displeasure
with The Daily's coverage of Native Amer
ican issues and concerns on this campus. I
am going to draw several generalizations
from the coverage afforded Natives in an
Oct. 15 article entitled "Native Americans
pan Columbus Day" to show just what a
lousy job The Daily is doing.
First, the reporter failed to quote
accurately the students interviewed.
There has always been a balancing test
in the minds of Native students when
The Daily calls: "Should I really put
forth the effort to make this reporter
understand and have my perspective
voiced to the campus?" vs. "Is it really
worthwhile to give the Daily another
chance to misrepresent me?" Every time
The Daily calls, students emphasize that
their tribe be included with their name.
In Indian country, a person's tribe

comes first. Obviously this is just too
damn much for The Daily to handle.
Secondly, everyone interviewed for that
particular article stressed the tie between
speaking out against Columbus and the
dire need for a Native American Studies
Department. We should not have the sole
burden of educating this campus on our
perspectives, cultures and customs. Sure,
there is an occasional class offered every
year, but this is not enough. Yo Stanford,
what kind of diversity are you opting for?
Yo Daily, listen to what we are saying!
There are a lot of Native Americans
who return to their communities with
the intention of bettering the living con
ditions for their people. The various
departments and schools on this campus
have not been responsive to our needs. If
Natives are going to be part of this cam
pus, then let our histories, political sys-

tems, economic schemes, philosophies
and contributions be included in the aca
demic realm. It is not enough to only
remember us when we are against a
ludicrous myth like that of Columbus.
Finally, I was deeply offended by sev
eral remarks in the article. We were not
"mourning the loss of our cultures." Our
cultures are enduring and will continue
until the end of this world. We mourn
the loss of different tribes and the deci
mation of our population. We mourn the
destruction of these lands, the wingeds,
four-leggeds, fish and the oppression of
Natives and Africans.
Not just anybody would come here
and do what Columbus did, as History
Prof. Steve Ozment said. Maybe just any
European male would, but nobody from
an Indigenous Nation would do that to
another people. Columbus came and

demanded gold. If an individual didn't
fulfill the demand, he ordered his men to
cut off that individual's hands and feet.
Columbus was responsible for slow
cooking indigenous leaders and using green
wood to prolong the pain. No one from my
Nation would ever do this. Every student
on this campus should be able to study the
truth of Columbus. He was the catalyst for
the African-American slave trade. Teach
the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it
is. As students at an elite institution of
higher education, we deserve the truth.
Furthermore, technology and
progress are no excuse or even a worth
while mission for what was done and is
still being done in North and South
America, unlike what Ozment said. We
are appalled at the European suicide
mission labeled "progress."
Do the Europeans so hate everything

in this world that they must ravage the
life-sustaining earth, pollute the life
force of water, slaughter our four
leggeds and cloud the air with toxins? As
Europe became more of a wasteland and
inequalities more intolerable, these peo
ple came to my land and called it the
"new world" and "virgin land," and
claimed "manifest destiny."
If The Daily had covered this topic
correctly or had been doing articles over
a wide expanse of time, I wouldn't have
had to correct all of these issues. I sin
cerely hope that The Daily is able to
incorporate these constructive criticisms
in their future articles concerning the
Native community.
