## Hockey wins Nor Pac title 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Stanford simply dominated in every sport on
Saturday, and the Cardinal women's field hock
ey team was not to be outdone. But for them, it
was simply a matter of continuing a trend that
has been going on all season. The squad proved
that it is truly the best in the West as it beat the
University of the Pacific 2-0 in the Northern

Pacific Conference Championship game.
No. 20 Stanford dominated in just about
every aspect. The game was characterized by
what has become a trademark of the Cardinal
hockey squad: hustle. The sheer aggressiveness
and never-say-die attitudes of the players simply
overwhelmed the Tigers. The result? Stanford
outshot Pacific 30 to 8.
The first goal was scored by Tina Syer at 9:30
into the second half on a gorgeous lob shot over
the Pacific goalkeeper who had ventured out a
tad too far. The second score came at 27:13 on a
typically thunderous whack by Sara Hallock,
who shot it in from an almost impossible angle.
But it wasn't all offense. The numbers also
show the strength of Stanford's defense, led by
senior midfielder Susan Leckrone and senior
goalkeeper Kristina Vidal. The precision passing
and selfless team play — another Cardinal trade
mark — kept the ball moving and the Pacific
players swinging at air. And this type of intensi
ty kept up all the way until the final whistle was
blown.
"We played hard all the way until the end,"
said coach Sheryl Johnson. "It was a good win to
finish on."
Stanford had already clinched the NorPac
title by virtue of a stellar 6-1 conference record,
but did not overlook the Tigers. Using such tac
tics as playing for milkshakes in practice scrim
mages seemed to really pay off, as Pacific became
just one more routine win.
"We had to come out and play hard," said cap
tain Michele Beynet. "We had to prove that we
are the best in the West."
And did they ever prove that. Stanford will be
the only team from the West at NCAAs next
week. They will meet either lowa or Northwest
ern (to be announced today) in the first round —
both teams ranked in the top 10 nationally. It
should be a very tough match for the Cardinal,
but Johnson feels that they are up to the task.
"All of the players have been getting better
with each game, improving a step at a time," said
Johnson. "We are right where we want to be."
