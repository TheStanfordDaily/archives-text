## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
No matter how hard the Stanford
men's swimming team tries to give
other teams a chance, it doesn't work.
The amazing Cardinal squad just
keeps winning, regardless of who's
swimming which events.
The Cardinal destroyed UC-Santa
Barbara's swimmers last Friday at
deGuerre, winning in a 155.5 to 81.5
blowout, even though they were trying
to give the Gauchos a fighting chance.
With the Pacific 10 Championships
coming up in two weeks, and the Stan
ford squad out to it's best start since
1987, head coach Skip Kenney likes
what he sees.

"I don't see any other teams that
can beat us at Pac-10s. Our relays our
super. We look for a couples of Ameri
can records, and definitely NCAA
qualifying time standards," Kenney
said.

Jeff Rouse didn't even compete in the
individual backstroke events against
Santa Barbara, instead winning the
50-yard freestyle in 21.00. Kevin Hen

derson came in third in 21.81.
"Jeff is a great athlete. Even if it's
not his specialty, he's always going to
swim fast," Kenney said.
None of Stanford's major swim
mers swam their normal events,
instead concentrating on non-specialty
events, and the relays, Stanford's real
strength, featured different swimmers
than in the usual line-up.
Sprinter Erik Maurer went the dis
tance in the 200 free to win in 1:39.20,
with freshman Clay Tippins coming in
second with 1:40.31. John deGroot fin
ished third in the Cardinal sweep with
1:42.11.
Tippins also led a sweep in the 100
butterfly, winning in 50.81. Eddie
Parenti came in second in 51.00 fol

lowed by Bill Schell with 51.65.
"Our freshman class looked really
good today. They've started to learn
how to relax in an easier-type meet, but
also perform very well," Kenney said.
Without Rouse, Trip Zedlitz took
command in the 100 back, winning in
51.36, with breaststroker Tyler May
field finishing fourth.
Both Stanford's medley and
freestyle relays won, although the free
relay competed unofficially, trying to
counteract the lopsided meet.
Stanford's diving program over
powered UCSB as well, with junior
Mark Kraus winning both the one
meter and three-meter diving events,
with 268.50 and 213.95 points, in the
respective competitions.
