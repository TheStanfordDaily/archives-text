ty in overtime, 2-1. The victory
put the team in a field of only
eight teams still alive in the
NCAA tournament.
Junior Jen Potok scored both
goals for Stanford, who will play
Colorado College for a spot in the
Final Four. The Julie Foudy-less
Cardinal won its first NCAA
tournament game in team histo
ry, overshadowing its 2-1 loss to
the Broncos earlier this season in
the process.
The opening moments of the
game featured scoring chances by
each team, but the contest
remained scoreless for the
game's first half-hour.
Santa Clara finally broke the
deadlock at 29:10 of the half,
when goalkeeper Leslie Garrard
was pinned underneath a Bron
co player and a slow bouncing
ball was knocked into the Stan
ford net by the Broncos' Bar

bara Riddle.
The teams played the rest of
the period evenly and the Cardi
nal entered the intermission
down by a goal.
In the second half, however,
Stanford proved why it has the
second-best record in the coun
try, firmly controlling the period
and the ensuing half-hour over
time. The team's only lapse came
in the game's 61st minute, when
Santa Clara's Kristi Devert
found herself on a breakaway
after a Stanford corner kick.
However, Devert's shot
toward an open Cardinal net
sailed wide, and the game
remained 1-0.
After applying consistent pres
sure throughout the half, the
Cardinal finally knotted the score
as Potok trapped a Heather
Mclntyre free kick and put it
away.
By the time Potok had evened
the game at one, all of the game's
momentum belonged to Stan
ford. The rest of regulation was
marked by a flurry of Stanford
scoring chances as they relent
lessly attacked the Broncos' reel
ing defense.
The Cardinal finally went
ahead to stay on a brilliant play
by freshman Andrea Johnson.
She raced down the sideline to
flag down the ball, dribbled
around two defenders and then
