ty in overtime, 2-1. The victory
put the team in a field of only
eight teams still alive in the
NCAA tournament.
Junior Jen Potok scored both
goals for Stanford, who will play
Colorado College for a spot in the
Final Four. The Julie Foudy-less
Cardinal won its first NCAA
tournament game in team histo
ry, overshadowing its 2-1 loss to
the Broncos earlier this season in
the process.
The opening moments of the
game featured scoring chances by
each team, but the contest
remained scoreless for the
game's first half-hour.
Santa Clara finally broke the
deadlock at 29:10 of the half,
when goalkeeper Leslie Garrard
was pinned underneath a Bron
co player and a slow bouncing
ball was knocked into the Stan
ford net by the Broncos' Bar

bara Riddle.
The teams played the rest of
the period evenly and the Cardi
nal entered the intermission
down by a goal.
In the second half, however,
Stanford proved why it has the
second-best record in the coun
try, firmly controlling the period
and the ensuing half-hour over
time. The team's only lapse came
in the game's 61st minute, when
Santa Clara's Kristi Devert
found herself on a breakaway
after a Stanford corner kick.
However, Devert's shot
toward an open Cardinal net
sailed wide, and the game
remained 1-0.
After applying consistent pres
sure throughout the half, the
Cardinal finally knotted the score
as Potok trapped a Heather
Mclntyre free kick and put it
away.
By the time Potok had evened
the game at one, all of the game's
momentum belonged to Stan
ford. The rest of regulation was
marked by a flurry of Stanford
scoring chances as they relent
lessly attacked the Broncos' reel
ing defense.
The Cardinal finally went
ahead to stay on a brilliant play
by freshman Andrea Johnson.
She raced down the sideline to
flag down the ball, dribbled
around two defenders and then

fired a brilliant cross to Potok
and a wide-open net. Bronco
keeper Sue Wall never had a
chance as Stanford went ahead at
3:48 of the first overtime and
never looked back.
"We showed a lot of guts,"
sophomore Sarah Rafanelli said
of the come-from-behind victory.
"We played the first half evenly.
Somebody had to pick it up in the
second half."
Fortunately, it was Stanford,
who outshot the Broncos 19-10
on the strength of the team's sec
ond-half heroics.
The Cardinal upped its record
to 17-1 and will probably have to

play Colorado College on the road
next weekend. If weather condi
tions in Colorado make their field
unsuitable for playing, the game
will be held here.
Yesterday's contest was an
extremely physical one, with 46
fouls and three yellow cards.
However, what might have been
the game's best tackle took place
off the field, not on it.
After Riddle's first-half goal, a
man carrying a huge Santa Clara
banner raced by the Stanford sec
tion of Harry Maloney field. On
his way back, Wade Colwell, a
player on the Cardinal men's
team, tripped up the flagboy and
sent him flailing to the grass,
much to the delight of the Stan
ford crowd.
He never came back. And nei
ther did the Broncos.
