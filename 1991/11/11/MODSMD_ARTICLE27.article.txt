Women's basketball: In
an exhibition game, Stanford
defeated the visiting South
Australian All-Stars on Satur
day night, 98-71.
Junior Chris MacMurdo
scored a career-high 22 points,
fully twice her previous high.
She also grabbed nine rebounds.
Coach Tar a VanDerveer sub
stituted liberally, and the Stan
ford fans got their first glimpse
of the talented Cardinal fresh
men, one of whom was especial
ly impressive: power forward
Rachel Hemmer, who poured in
17 points to go along with nine
rebounds.
The 6-foot-3-inch Hemmer
put Stanford ahead for good on
a check-this-out play. She had
the ball at the top of the key,

and the Aussies left her shot
open, figuring she didn't have
the range. Hemmer promptly
knocked down the three.
Women's swimming: The
Cardinal trounced the UC-
Santa Barbara Gauchos 162-88
at deGuerre Pool.
A Cardinal swimmer or diver
finished first in every event but
one in the lopsided victory.
Mary Ellen Blanchard set a pool
record in the 200 individual
medley with a time of 2:01.87.
Freshman Jenny Thompson
qualified for NCAAs in the free.
Thompson said. "I think we'll
be really great in March."
The Cardinal pushed its
dual-meet record to 2-0, having
beaten defending national
champion Texas on Nov. 2.
