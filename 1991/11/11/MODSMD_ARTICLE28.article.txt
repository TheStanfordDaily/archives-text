Senior Kristin Klein didn't become the all-time
Stanford career kill leader this weekend, but that is
the only minus amongst numerous plusses for the
No. 1 Cardinal after sweeping Pacific 10 Conference
foes Oregon and Oregon State on the road.
Stanford, now 23-0 overall and 14-0 in the confer
ence, stomped the Ducks on Friday night, 15-4, 15-5,
15-7, and then went on to crush the Beavers 15-9, 15-
3, 15-1 on Saturday. Klein, who needed only 30 kills
to tie Kim Oden for the kill record at 1751, tallied 15
kills against Oregon but only 12 the next night at
Oregon State, coming up just three kills short of the
record.
The Cardinal dominated the Ducks from the
opening serve to the final point as Stanford scored
the first six points of each game in the match.
Klein continued to overwhelm opponents with
her outstanding play, contributing 16 digs and a
.448 hitting percentage. And she wasn't even the
team leader in hitting Friday night. That honor
belongs to fellow senior Amy Cooper, who slammed
down 8 kills with only 2 errors for a stellar .462 per
centage.
Junior Bev Oden had 14 digs and 9 kills and fresh
man Denise Rotert played all three games in place of
injured junior Laurie Sawin, a defensive specialist.
The Cardinal hit .333 as a team, holding the Ducks to
a pitiful .108 overall with no Oregon player tallying
more than 9 kills.
Stanford head coach Don Shaw used a good por
tion of his bench in the victory as junior Kristi Paaso,
sophomore Piper Hahn and freshman Anne Wicks all
saw action in the third game.
The next night Stanford had a little trouble get
ting out of the starting blocks, allowing hapless Ore
gon State to remain in game one for a little while
before putting them away. The Cardinal hit only .153
as a team with 7 errors in the first game.
Stanford then steamrolled the Beavers in the sec
ond and third games.
