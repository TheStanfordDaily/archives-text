Although the football game may not
have been as close as was expected, Satur
day morning's water polo match between
Stanford and UCLA, was as exciting and
close as anyone could have hoped for. The
No. 4 Cardinal did exactly what it needed
to do and emerged with a thrilling 8-7 vic
tory over the No. 3 Bruins.
As junior Chip Blankenhorn said, "We
had to win this game, and we just did it. It
was a great win for our team and it was a
great team effort, and that's why we won."
Stanford needed this win in order to
keep its NCAA tournament hopes alive,
yet even if the Cardinal — whose record
is now 13-9 — eventually do not make
NCAAs, coach Dante Dettamanti is still
proud of his team's performance. "This
game proves to us and to everyone that
we deserve an NCAA bid, and it's too bad
that the NCAA doesn't take into account
how you're playing at the end of the year.
"This shows us that we have finally
arrived as a team," Dettamanti contin
ued. "If you can win the tough games,
especially in the last minutes when it's
all on the line . . . that really shows you
what you're made of."
In front of a packed deGuerre Pool,
UCLA scored the first two goals of the
game, but Stanford fought back with three
straight goals to take the lead, and at half
time, the score was all tied up at three.
In the second half, Blankenhorn got
the lead back for the Cardinal with a
quick goal on the six-on-five advantage,

but once again the Bruins responded with
a goal of their own to even up the score.
With less than two minutes left in the
third quarter, sophomore Antonio Bus
quets thrilled the crowd with a sidearm
shot into the right hand corner of the
net, and the Cardinal was back in front.
But not for long, as a four-meter
penalty shot by UCLA only 14 seconds
later tied up the game again. Then, in
what potentially could have been the
Cardinal's downfall, Stanford failed to
capitalize on a two-man advantage as
freshman Frank Schneider's shot was
stopped by a crowd of Bruins in the goal.
And to make matters worse, the Bru
ins retook the lead with six minutes left
in the game on a great shot by Gary
O'Brien on the six-on-five advantage.
The Cardinal proceeded by failing to
capitalize on two of its own six-on-five
chances, but then Schneider drew a four
meter penalty and fellow freshman Wolf
Wigo converted the opportunity and tied
the game back up at six.
With three minutes left, the momen
tum swung back to Stanford's side, as
goalkeeper Larry Bercutt blocked an out
side shot by the Bruins on a six-on-five
and threw a long pass on the counter
attack to a wide-open Blankenhorn who
rifled the ball into the net.
