## Cause of death not yet known, suicide possible 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
The body of junior Daniel Lichstein was
found on the floor of his room in Toyon
Hall by his roommate Roger Cornwall
around 1 p.m. Saturday.
Toyon Resident Fellow James Fox said
the police are not yet sure of the cause of
death. "It might have been a suicide, but
they are not sure," he said.
According to Fox, a bottle of pills was
also found near Lichstein, who had been
drinking Friday night. The investigators
"thought it could be an overdose of pills,
but they weren't sure," he said. "Even if it
was an overdose, we don't know if it is sui
cide because it might not have been inten
tional."
The Stanford police officers investigat
ing the case were unavailable for comment.
Norm Sanders, the field investigator from
the coroner's office, said, "Suicide is a possi
bility. He did leave a note." However, Sanders
would not characterize the note or its con-

tents, saying more details
would be in the report he
will file tomorrow.
Sanders said the cause
of death will not be deter
mined by the coroner's
office for another four to
six weeks. "We've done an
autopsy," he said. "But
the death certificate will
say that the cause of death

is still pending because the toxicology
report is not done yet."
The toxicology report will determine the
cause of death by examining stomach con
tent and blood and liver samples. Accord
ing to Sanders, such tests are normal pro
cedure in situations where there are no
signs of physical harm. According to Fox,
the police "don't think it was a homicide."
The approximate time of death has not
been established. According to Toyon Resi
dent Assistant Glen Tripp, the last time


Lichstein
anyone saw Lichstein was 3:30
a.m. Saturday.
Toyon Resident Fellow Mar
garet Fox said Lichstein had
taken some students out to the
symphony on Friday evening. "By
all reports he seemed happy," she
said.
Tripp, who saw Lichstein
around midnight, agreed that his
behavior was not out of the ordi
nary. "Nothing he was doing that
night led us to believe there was
anything to be suspicious of or

worry about," he said.
Toyon residents said Lichstein
had been drinking Friday night.
But according to Margaret Fox,
"He didn't seem really drunk."
Hope Flannery, another Toyon
RA, said she thought Lichstein
was "not very intoxicated."
Lichstein, who was 20, was
majoring in computer science and
had recently resigned as manager
of El Tigre, one of the Toyon eat
ing clubs. According to Tripp, he
was also "very athletic and cycled
competitively and was interested
in philosophy and poetry."
Lichstein's parents were noti
fied on Saturday and flew in from
New York yesterday.

Toyon residents, with Assoc.
Dean of the Chapel Diana Akiya
ma, will be holding a memorial
service for Lichstein at 8 p.m.
Thursday in the Toyon lounge.
