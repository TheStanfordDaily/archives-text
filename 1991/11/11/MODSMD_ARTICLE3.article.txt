The body of junior Daniel Lichstein was
found on the floor of his room in Toyon
Hall by his roommate Roger Cornwall
around 1 p.m. Saturday.
Toyon Resident Fellow James Fox said
the police are not yet sure of the cause of
death. "It might have been a suicide, but
they are not sure," he said.
According to Fox, a bottle of pills was
also found near Lichstein, who had been
drinking Friday night. The investigators
"thought it could be an overdose of pills,
but they weren't sure," he said. "Even if it
was an overdose, we don't know if it is sui
cide because it might not have been inten
tional."
The Stanford police officers investigat
ing the case were unavailable for comment.
Norm Sanders, the field investigator from
the coroner's office, said, "Suicide is a possi
bility. He did leave a note." However, Sanders
would not characterize the note or its con-

tents, saying more details
would be in the report he
will file tomorrow.
Sanders said the cause
of death will not be deter
mined by the coroner's
office for another four to
six weeks. "We've done an
autopsy," he said. "But
the death certificate will
say that the cause of death

is still pending because the toxicology
report is not done yet."
The toxicology report will determine the
cause of death by examining stomach con
tent and blood and liver samples. Accord
ing to Sanders, such tests are normal pro
cedure in situations where there are no
signs of physical harm. According to Fox,
the police "don't think it was a homicide."
The approximate time of death has not
been established. According to Toyon Resi
dent Assistant Glen Tripp, the last time
