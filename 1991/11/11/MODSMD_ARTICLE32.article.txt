# Floral arrangement class blossoms in EAST House

Ingredients: backyard weeds,
junkyard wire, pinecones, net
ting and maybe a loaf of French
bread. Directions: "Listen with
your hearts to understand the
nature of the medium," then stir
in creativity and let sit for less
than four hours.
Result: an exquisite piece of
art whose roots go back to sixth
century Japan.
Culinary magic? No, just ike
bana, a type of floral arrange
ment that now graces the dining
room and terrace of EAST House.
"Head chefs" Miyoko Kobaya
shi, Asako Sato and Kumi
Kikuchi of the Sogetsu school in
Japan enlightened EAST House
residents with a week-long class
last month. The "chefs" — with
the help of residents — created
more than 30 ikebana arrange
ments that are still on display at
the residence.
"I was very impressed by the
students because even though
studying ikebana was new to them,
they took an active role in learn
ing," said Kobayashi, the director
of the Sogetsu school. In the span
of four lessons students studied
the techniques of Japanese floral
arranging and designed their own
ikebana creations.
"They listened with their
hearts and used raw materials as
the medium to understanding,"
according to Kobayashi, who has
been practicing ikebana (pro

nounced 'eek-uh-bon-uh') for 50
years.
Senior Ryan Moos said he
learned to view everyday plants
and trees artistically. "I had a
certain kind of theme that I
wanted to project, a feeling I was
trying to express," he said,
adding that he was able to
express these feelings through
the ikebana.
"Usually students only use
their brains and have few oppor
tunities to use their hands,"
Kobayashi said. "I imagine this
kind of change must be relaxing."
Senior Eng Kian Toh agreed.
"Education nowadays is so non
tactile, much too abstract," he
said. "This class brought the
abstract to the hands, and you
can see your own creation. It's
not just flat pieces of paper."
Students "brought the
abstract to the hands" in aesthet
ic projects ranging from tabletop
arrangements of flowers, flying
disks, weeds and bread to gigan
tic outdoor ikebanas consisting of
pine-trees, netting, wire and
neighboring plants.
"There are no limitations,"
according to Kobayashi, who met
EAST House Resident Fellow Jim
Ketelaar in Japan 10 years ago.
"You can use any kind of material
and turn it into ikebana with your
own creativity and feelings."
While in Japan, Ketelaar
taught the three ikebana instruc
tors English, and they, in turn,
taught him the floral arranging

techniques. "They were very
excited about coming to Stanford
to teach this class rather than
just going to some touristy spots
in the area," Ketelaar, who per
sonally invited the three ikebana
experts to come teach at EAST
House, said.

"It's a very nice thing to teach
ikebana around the world,"
according to Kobayashi, whose
65-year-old school has branches
in Los Angeles and San Francis
co in addition to its headquarters
in Tokyo.
"We Japanese tell you about

ikebana, but these days flower
arrangement has become very pop
ular around the world, and differ
ent people can make their own,"
Kobayashi said. "Every 100 years
the style changes. I want to have
the longevity to see the future of an
international ikebana."
