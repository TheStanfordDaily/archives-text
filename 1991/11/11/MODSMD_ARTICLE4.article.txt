# Multicultural goals to be assessed by UCMI panel
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Stanford's progress in meeting its mul
ticultural goals over the past two years will
be assessed this week during the annual
visit of the University Committee on
Minority Issues review panel.
The panel is charged with measuring
the University's success in implementing
UCMI's March 1989 recommendations.
The 1991 panel will meet with students
and other community members over the
course of their three-day visit, conducting
interviews and fact-finding sessions on a
number of the topics addressed in the report.
The panel will also hold an "exit inter
view" open to the community at 3 p.m.
Wednesday in the Wattis Room of Little
field Management Center.

Created in response to pressure by the
Rainbow Agenda, a coalition of student
minority groups, UCMI was charged with
addressing the problems faced by minori
ties at Stanford.
The committee conducted an 18-month
examination and exhaustively documented
the problems of minority life among stu
dents, staff and faculty.
The 244-page report released by the
committee outlined steps the University
could take to improve the working and
learning environment for minorities on
campus and put forth 117 specific recom
mendations to help achieve these ends.
Some of the key recommendations
included:
• Instituting a new academic distribu-
tion requirement for the study of
U.S. minority groups;
• Hiring 30 new minority facul
ty members over the next 10 years;
• Targeting certain Asian
minority subgroups for admis
sions and financial aid;
• Funding more scholarships
and grants for minorities, which
would ease the burden of large
work-study allotments; and
• Doubling the number of
minority Ph.D. candidates within
the next eight years.

Last year, the 19-member review
panel — comprised of students,
alumni, staff and faculty members
as well as external experts on minor
ity issues — reported that the Uni
versity had given "insufficient or
inconsistent attention to the issues"
addressed in the UCMI report.
The 1990 panel praised Uni
versity officials for their attempts
to address the issues brought up
in the UCMI report, but said too
little action had been taken
toward creating and unifying a
culturally diverse community.
Members of the 1991 review
panel — from within the Stanford
community — include Diana
Akiyama, associate dean of Memo

rial Church; William Demmert,
visiting professor in the School of
Education; James Leckie, profes
sor of engineering; Robert Sutton,
associate professor of engineering;
Deborah Britt, representative from
the United Stanford Workers; Cliff
Wong, undergraduate; and Bacardi
Jackson, undergraduate.
Other members include Patricia
Fabiano, director of the Wellness
Program, Western Washington
University, and former director of
Stanford's Health Improvement
Program; Bernadine Chuck Fong,
Stanford Trustee and Foothill
Community College vice president
for instruction; and alumni William
Johnson and Lydia Kennard.
