# Synergy house bulldozed despite opposition
## 
### Adam Stein 
Only a few curious onlookers had
gathered when a lone steam shovel's
long arm easily punched through
Synergy's frail wood walls.
Despite several groups' intense
struggle to save the house, it was
demolished with little fanfare early
Friday morning. A single wrecking
crew reduced the 80-year-old struc
ture to rubble in about four hours.
"I'm very sad," said John Hack
mann, attorney for the Committee
for the Preservation of Historic Stan
ford. "It was a grand house, and it
was always very important to student
life. It fell victim to neglect."
Hackmann, who was a Synergy
resident assistant from 1978 to 1979,
cited a number of factors — including
earthquake damage, budget problems
and a shift in the University's priori
ties — that led to the demolition of
the house. He added, "In a different
time, it could have been saved."
The University's legal obligation
to leave the house standing expired
Thursday at midnight. Stanford was
unable to wreck the house earlier due
to complications in obtaining a demo
lition permit.
Because of concern that protesters
might try to interfere with the demo
lition, police officers patrolled the
area all Thursday night.
According to Hackmann, the fear
of a protest was groundless. "We're
committed to positive action. We're
very supportive of Stanford and
wouldn't want to do anything to
cause the University harm. We feel
we're a part of the family just having
our say," he said.
The wrecking crew arrived shortly
after 7 a.m. Friday. No protest
occurred, and the steam shovel's claw
slowly and steadily swiped away large
sections of the house until it finally
collapsed on itself.
The University's decision to wreck

the house as soon as it obtained legal
permission came as little surprise to the
Stanford community. "We suspected it
would happen," said senior Nicole Sein
feld, a member of the committee and an
eating associate at Synergy, which is
now located at Durand. "It was pretty
sad, but the house had to go."
The house, built in 1911, sus
tained severe earthquake damage
two years ago. Rather than renovate

it, the University decided to tear it
down to make room for revenue-gen
erating faculty housing.
The committee managed to post
pone a proposed August demolition
date, and last week the North Ameri
can Students of Cooperation made a
$1 million bid to buy the Synergy
house in a final attempt to save the
structure.
The University rejected the bid,

adhering to its policy against trans
ferring ownership of Stanford prop
erty to outside interests.
Hackmann criticized Stanford's
rush to destroy the house, saying
that nothing will be built on the site
for at least a year. "What was the
hurry? What's being buried in the
rubble? I think the University was
afraid of being stuck with a house on
their hands," he said.
