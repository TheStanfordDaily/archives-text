Unrest spreads to Russia
GROZNY, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Nationalists in the
secessionist enclave of Chechen-Ingush yesterday
forced the retreat of nearly 1,000 troops sent to
enforce emergency rule imposed by Russia.
The peaceful departure of the soldiers — a day
after they arrived — appeared to be a slap in the
face to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is
cracking down hard on his first separatist chal
lenge.
Gen. Dzhokar Dudayev, a former Soviet army
general who was sworn in Saturday as president
of the territory, has led the drive by dominant
nationalist Chechens to break from Russian con
trol. His mainly Muslim autonomous region of
1.3 million people declared itself independent a
week ago, saying it feared domination by the Rus
sian government.
Peace force arrives in Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Australian
soldiers in blue berets arrived yesterday in Cam
bodia, the first of a vast U.N. force that will try to
keep peace in the country wrecked by 13 years of
civil war.
In yet another sign of hope for the devastated
Southeast Asian land, U.S. diplomats were flying
to Phnom Penh today to restore relations severed
16 years ago. Japanese diplomats also arrived to
open a new embassy, four days ahead of the
arrival of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who will
lead an interim government.
Under a United Nations-brokered peace

accord signed last month, the government and
three guerrilla groups are to lead the country
toward democratic elections scheduled in
1993.
Palestinian negotiators return
JERICHO, Occupied West Bank (AP) — Pales
tinian peace negotiators came home to a jubilant
welcome yesterday, and their leader pledged to
switch from stones to olive branches in the fight
to end Israeli occupation.
In what appeared to be a direct appeal to
Israelis to trust the Palestinians' peaceful inten
tions, Faisal Husseini made his comments in
Hebrew on Israeli army radio and in a rare
appearance on Israeli television.
Heart disease test discovered
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — A blood fat mea
surement widely ignored by doctors could be an
important predictor of heart disease and diabetes
in patients with high cholesterol, researchers said
yesterday.
The fats, called triglycerides, have been widely
thought to have little effect on heart disease risk
unless they occurred at far higher than normal
levels in the blood, according to Antonio Gotto of
the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Studies presented yesterday in conjunction
with the American Heart Association's annual
meeting suggest that even mildly elevated triglyc
eride levels may be an important indicator of
heart disease risk, Gotto said.
