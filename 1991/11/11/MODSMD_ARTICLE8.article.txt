# Battles rage in Yugoslavia

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— The Serb-led Yugoslav army
and Croatian rebels battled street
to street yesterday for control of
Vukovar, a powerful symbol in
the civil war in which more than
1,700 people have died.
One day after the Serb-domi
nated Yugoslav leadership issued
a surprise call for U.N. peace
keepers in secessionist Croatia,
the army also rained more shells
on another stronghold in the
republic — the former tourist
center of Dubrovnik.
Croatian radio said four people

were killed in the shelling yester
day in the Adriatic port, but one
radio station in Dubrovnik put
the toll at 11. Reporters in the
city said some fearful residents
stood on their balconies and fired
automatic weapons or even pis
tols at the gunboats pounding the
port. Gunfire hit at least two
renowned hotels.
Following the Serb call for
peacekeepers on Saturday, a lead
ing Yugoslav army general, Niko
la Uzelac, told reporters yester
day that his Serb-dominated force
could leave the front in two or

three days if U.N. peacekeepers
arrived.
But U.N. officials said last
week the world body would not
send peacekeepers while the
European Community, which has
mediated at least 11 failed peace
efforts, was involved in trying to
stop the warfare.
Croatia has said it would accept
peacekeepers along its prewar
borders, not between present-day
Serb and Croatian lines as Serbia
suggests. Serbs control about one
third of Croatia after more than
four months of fighting.
