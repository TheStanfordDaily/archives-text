NEW ORLEANS (AP) -
David Duke denied yesterday that
he was ever a Nazi Party member
and again apologized for his past
intolerance as the campaign for
Louisiana governor moved into its
last week.
Duke, a renegade Republican,
and former three-term Gov.
Edwin Edwards, a Democrat,
sparred on NBC's "Meet The
Press." They spent most of their
20-minute segment disagreeing
and interrupting each other and
trying to shake off their pasts.

The side-by-side meeting in the
TV studio was the last scheduled
joint appearance by the two
before their runoff election Satur
day.
Duke, a state representative
who has been disowned by Presi
dent Bush and other GOP lead
ers, was grand wizard of the Ku
Klux Klan in the late 1970s and
was a Nazi sympathizer.
When quizzed about his quali
fications to lead Louisiana and
knowledge of the state, Duke
couldn't identify the top three

employers or the number of resi
dents who live below the poverty
line.
Host Garrick Utley asked Duke
about his past, holding up a front
page picture in Sunday's edition
of The New York Times showing
him wearing a Nazi arm band in
1969.
Duke, 41, said he was 19 at the
time, was frustrated and trying to
protest what he believed was the
wrong direction his country was
taking, but admitted that he
"didn't choose the right method."
