Churchill
A LIFE
By
MARTIN GILBERT
r -■/
V
One of Britain's most distinguished historians, Martin Gilbert
began work in 1962 with Randolph Churchill on the first two
volumes of the official biography of Sir Winston Churchill and,
following Randolph's death in 1968, was himself appointed
Official Biographer. During the twenty-five years spent on the
biography, which reached completion in 1988 with the eighth
volume, Mr. Gilbert also wrote many other books on modern
European history, including Auschwitz and the Allies, The
Holocaust, and The Second World War. He has also edited
thirteen volumes of Churchill documents. Of the eight-volume
official biography, the Times Literary Supplement said it "places
Mr. Gilbert in the first rank of contemporary historians," and The
New York Times Book Review hailed it as "a stupendous
achievement... of immense and permanent value."
