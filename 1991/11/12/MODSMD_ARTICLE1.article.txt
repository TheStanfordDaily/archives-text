## Switch to CIV left few lasting effects

Editor's Note: The conversion of the freshman
Western Culture requirement to Cultures, Ideas

debate over diversity in university curricula that
continues today.
This story examines how the switch has
affected the Great Works CIV track, which was

The course is called "Great Works," but every
one has a different idea of what a great work is.
That dilemma, which encapsulates the ongo
ing national debate over the perceived "Eurocen
tricity" of university curricula, is one that cannot

be resolved easily by the 370 fresh
men enrolled in the Great Works
track of Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues — or, for that matter, by any
one, instructors in the track say.
Instructor Cheryl Ross, the
track's coordinator, said she real
izes the problems of calling a
course "Great Works."
"The title of the course is posed
as a question," she said, adding
that the course does not claim to
teach the 30 greatest works of
humanity. "We try to find out
why certain books have become
'great works.' "
In 1988-89, after a fierce debate
that focused national attention on
Stanford's curriculum, the CIV
requirement — which emphasized
issues of race, class and gender
more than its predecessor West
ern Culture — was instituted.
Since then, "multiculturalism"
has become a buzzword at Stan
ford, and other universities have
been torn by similar debates
about diversity in their curricula.
After the switch at Stanford
three years ago, some of the seven
CIV tracks made significant addi
tions to their reading lists, but
others — including Great Works,
which was created as the model
for the Western Culture require

ment — have more or less main
tained the status quo.
A new track, "Europe and the
Americas," was also instituted. It
attempts to integrate non-West
ern ideas into the course more
fully, and has often been misin
terpreted as Stanford's new stan
dard for CIV.
Anthea Waleson, a Great Works
instructor, downplayed the impor
tance of the reading list, instead
emphasizing "methodology."
"The process of encountering
the books is more important than
the actual content of the works,"
she said, adding that the books
are merely used to make the stu
dents "learn how to think."
Great Works the prototype
Great Works was created as
the prototype for the Western
Culture requirement, said
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz,
who chaired Great Works from its
inception in 1980 until last year,
when Music Prof. George Houle
took over.
Rebholz said the original pur
pose of the course was to "examine
the values of the Western tradition
to gain an understanding of how we
come to hold the values we hold." In
a sense, it was designed as a "cul
tural psychoanalysis," he said.
Western Culture was modeled
after the University of Chicago's
acclaimed freshman course. At
the time of Stanford's switch,

most private institutions were
moving to strengthen their gener
al educational core.
Richard Lyman, University
president in 1980, said then that
the old system — which had no
Western Culture course and loos
er distribution requirements —
was like a "leaky sieve."
Religious Studies Prof. Van
Harvey, who lectures in Great
Works this year, noted the value
of the "common intellectual expe
rience of dealing with primary
texts."
CIV switch had little effect
According to Ross, Western
Culture's transformation to CIV
had little effect on the Great
Works curriculum. "We started to

implement materials from other
cultures, like the Koran or the
Epic of Gilgamesh, before the
change from Western Culture to
CIV occurred," she said.
Great Works tries to present a
"multicultural program which can
help students to develop a healthy
awareness of different cultures,"
Ross said. "We try to follow the
CIV legislation in good faith."
The CIV legislation, which was
adopted by the Faculty Senate on
March 31, 1988, mandates that
tracks must "give substantial
attention to the issues of race,
gender [and! class during each
academic quarter."
At least one imyor reading must
examine those issues "explicitly."
To meet the legislation's re
quirements, Waleson said that
Great Works tries "to give people
an overview on the Western tradi
tion, supplementing it with materi
al from other cultures."
Book list still 'traditional'
But Erin O'Connell, one of
three newly hired instructors in
the track, said there "could be
more multicultural content — the
ratio is certainly not half and half."
"Great Works is still heavily
slanted toward Western culture,"
O'Connell said, adding that "the
course is not as radical as I had
been led to believe. It has a very
traditional book list."
To compensate for that, she

said she focuses in her discussion
sections "particularly on questions
of race, class and gender, aside
from teaching the students about
critical inquiry." There is no pre
scribed checklist of topics that has
to be followed in class, Ross said.
The reading list of the course is
chosen by the instructors and the
Great Works chair, Ross said. "At
the end of each quarter, we have a
long discussion — from there we
get our impressions on what to
change," she said.
"We try to make changes grad
ually — not everything is up for
grabs," Ross said. "This is one of
the reasons the course hasn't
changed much over the years."
Still, many students who have
taken Great Works note the bene
fits of a more diverse curriculum.
"I learned a lot — it made me
more open to other cultures," said
senior Janet Coffey. "There are voic
es we never hear, and they should be
included in a course like this."
She said she especially liked
Great Works' inclusion of author
Toni Morrison's works in spring
quarter.
"Multiculturalism was my
favorite part of the course," said
sophomore Mike Brylawski. "My
parents never studied these books."
Cuts may endanger quality
Although the switch to CIV
gained attention for its far-reach
ing implications, instructors in

Great Works now are concerned
about another possible upheaval:
the impending budget cuts.
Instructors in the course are
especially concerned about the
possibility of graduate students —
who they say are insufficiently
prepared to handle teaching the
course — replacing instructors as
the course's section leaders.
Rebholz is vehement in his
opposition to that possibility. "It
would break my heart," he said. "I
would rather see Great Works
abandoned than being taught by
graduate students."
"I hope Great Works will contin
ue in its present form," Ross said.
As it is now, the application
process for the track's instructor
positions is very selective; this
year, 100 people applied for the
three openings available.
A Faculty Senate committee's
task force on undergraduate edu
cation has recommended cutting
the number of lecturers in CIV
tracks, instead using "qualified
and properly trained" graduate
students for some of the teaching
currently done by lecturers.
But Great Works instructors
say switching to graduate stu
dents would be particularly dam
aging to the track's seminar for
mat, which is unique to Great
Works. Unlike other tracks, stu
dents have four hours of discus
sion a week, supplemented with
only one hour of lecture.
