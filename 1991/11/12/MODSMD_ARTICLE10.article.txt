# U.N. AIDS report:
## Heterosexual activity causes most infections 
### 
GENEVA (AP) — Heterosexual sex has
caused the infection of 75 percent of people
with the AIDS virus worldwide, and the
infection is now rising in Western coun
tries, the World Health Organization said
yesterday.
The majority of the heterosexually
infected people are in the developing world,
particularly in Africa, and it still remains
only a small percentage of cases in North
America and Europe, the Geneva-based
agency said in an extensive report.
The U.N. group says up to 5,000 people
are infected each day around the world,
and officials fear an increase in pregnant
women infecting their babies.
Concern about heterosexual transmis
sion of the AIDS virus was heightened
after basketball star Magic Johnson
announced Thursday he had the HIV virus
and said he had no homosexual affairs.
In the United States, 3 percent of men
and 34 percent of woman contracted the
virus from a person of the opposite sex,
according to the Centers for Disease Con
trol in Atlanta.
"It is not easy to change sexual behav
ior, but hopefully with more people like
Magic Johnson coming out and talking
about their illness everyone will realize

they are at risk and take more care," said
Dr. Michael Merson, head of the U.N.
health agency's AIDS program.
Merson said tests of possible AIDS vac
cines are planned for Thailand, Uganda,
Rwanda and Brazil — nations with some
of the highest AIDS rates. The tests —
which will involve several thousand volun
teers — mark a departure from previous
approaches favoring early testing on ani
mals.
About a dozen potential vaccines to slow
or halt the onset on AIDS are being tested
in the United States and Europe, and sev
eral more may be available. The testing not
scheduled to begin for at least a year.
Merson, however, advised against hav
ing too much hope for the vaccines.
"The major point is that we're not going
to have a vaccine today and we're not going
to have a vaccine tomorrow," Merson said.
"We have to do everything we can to
inform the public now of the risks and the
need for safer sex."
WHO said heterosexual intercourse was
"overwhelmingly" responsible for the
spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa,
where an estimated 6 million people carry
the HIV virus and 900,000 babies have
been infected by their mothers.
