# Yeltsin defied
## State of emergency rejected

GROZNY, U.S.S.R. (AP) -
Separatists in the southern
Chechen-Ingush region fired
automatic weapons to celebrate
the Russian legislature's
refusal yesterday to approve
Boris Yeltsin's state of emer
gency in their Muslim enclave.
Gen. Dzhokar Dudayev, for
merly a bomber pilot in the
Soviet air force and now presi
dent of the Chechen-Ingush
region, had threatened terrorist
attacks on Moscow's nuclear
power stations and subways if
the decree was not repealed.
The 177-4 vote yesterday
against Yeltsin by the usually
pliant Russian lawmakers was
the first major show of no confi
dence in Yeltsin since his elec
tion in June as president of the
Russian Federation â€” a mosaic
of scores of restless ethnic
groups scattered among the
Russian majority.
The legislature's rebuff was
likely to damage Yeltsin's
authority, which was greatly
enhanced by his successful
opposition to hard-liners who

tried to oust Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev in August.
The vote was not binding, but
may force Yeltsin to withdraw
his decree.
Yeltsin did not attend the
debate and had no immediate
comment on the resolution,
which also called for negotia
tions toward a political solu
tion. Dudayev said he was
asked to take part in talks and
was prepared to do so.
Yeltsin's apparent indecision
in using force, the limited num
ber of troops he was able to
send to the region to enforce his
decree and the failure of his
representatives to carry out an
order to arrest Dudayev showed
his government to be weak in
areas not dominated by ethnic
Russians.
Dudayev said the Russian
vote represented a " victory for
democracy and truth." There
was no sign of compromise
from the Chechen-Ingush lead
ers on their Nov. 2 indepen
dence declaration from the Rus
sian Federation.
