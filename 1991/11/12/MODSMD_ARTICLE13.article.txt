AIDS prevention has
great hopes with role
model Magic Johnson

BY COURAGEOUSLY step
ping forth to share his per
sonal tragedy with the
world, basketball superstar Earvin
"Magic" Johnson has the potential
to become America's most valu
able player in fighting AIDS.
Americans this week face cogni
tive dissonance on a grand scale:
Either Johnson isn't the person
they imagined him to be, or AIDS
wasn't the disease they assumed it
was. Thousands of lives depend on
which belief America chooses.
For the past decade an army of
activists, educators, researchers
and people living with HIV disease
have tried their best to stem its
deadly spread and find a cure. But
there has been a deadly vacuum of
national leadership throughout the
Reagan and Bush administrations.
Network television still refuses
to carry advertisements mention
ing the word "condom" for fear of
offending viewers. Cities ban clean
needle exchange programs on the
grounds they will encourage drug
use, and limit sex education claim
ing it encourages promiscuity.
Although more than one million
Americans carry HIV and may per
ish from it, it is too often seen as
something that affects "others" —
others being gays, bisexuals, drug
users, poor people or any other
group we exclude ourselves from.
America sorely needs a leader
who can unify the country to fight
AIDS. Can the man who could play
any role on the basketball court
step up to play this part?
Johnson can accomplish much.
A tremendously gifted athlete,
wealthy and powerful, he has been
the definition of American mas
culinity. But as he can attest, there
is nothing manly about risky sex.
Johnson is an example that peo
ple living with HIV can be healthy,

productive, loved and respected.
He serves as an emblem that HIV
and AIDS affect good people whom
we care about.
And, while Johnson is a symbol
to all, he can play an especially cru
cial role in the African-American
community, which has not
received AIDS education or thera
pies commensurate with its needs.
AIDS is now the leading cause of
death among young black women
in Newark, N.J. and New York City.
This unabated suffering has been
accompanied by virtual silence by
the majority of African-American
political and religious leaders, with
notable exceptions like Maxine
Waters and Jesse Jackson.
The crucial question is whether
America will welcome Johnson's
message. The impact of last week's
announcement could last 10 years
— or it could dissipate in two
weeks. Those who are uneducated
about AIDS should take this
chance to inform themselves.
Those who understand the disease
should use this as a chance to
inform their friends.
While the cure for AIDS is
unknown, the methods of prevent
ing HIV transmission are common
knowledge. There is virtually no
reason for anyone to become newly
infected with HIV Transmission
occurs with the exchange of body
fluids, in particular, blood, semen
and vaginal fluids. Means of preven
tion include using condoms, practic
ing abstinence, being tested for HIY
and limiting one's sexual partners
to those who play by the same rules.
Johnson is not the first person to
wonder, "Why me?" Sadly, he won't
be the last. Viruses play no favorites.
But just as he made unprece
dented contributions to basketball,
Johnson has now made a tremen
dous contribution to society —
through his calm, statesmanlike
announcement of his determina
tion to fight the disease. The sud
den knowledge that every child's
hero carries the AIDS virus offers
America a singular chance to reori
ent its attitude toward the disease.
Let's hope we don't waste it.
