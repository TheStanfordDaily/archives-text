## Another dreaded '-ism' 
### 
Extremism, not familiar
with it, you say? Yes you are. It's
feeling that your position or view
point is so correct that you can't be
swayed by what anyone says. It's letting
other people voice their opinions (but not
listening to them) so that you can then
proselytize your own view.
It's being convinced that someone associ
ated with something that makes you
uncomfortable doesn't have anything valu
able to say and that you certainly don't have
anything to learn from him/her.
Most minority groups probably feel this
is a description of how they've been treated
by majorities. But adopting the same atti
tude doesn't seem like the most productive
way to effect change. I've seen this attitude
in most of the minority groups on campus,
from the right-wingers to the left, but it
makes little sense.
As an extremist, you have to assume
that others have the same mindset. If
they're as obstinate as you, how can you
hope to affect them? If everyone believes
that other people should be open to influ
ence but that they themselves shouldn't,
how will we get anywhere?
I have no problem with strong beliefs,
feelings or convictions.
It's just that I laugh when hearing the
words, "I think you're a great person, but I
can't fully respect you because of your ide
ology." Believe it or not — I couldn't — I've
heard that from both a religious person

and an environmentalist on this campus.
I feel sorry for them because they don't
know what they are missing — not just in
me, but in all the other people they write
off for various reasons. They don't believe
that just because a person disagrees with
you on one issue, that person isn't neces
sarily wrong about everything else.
Granted, some issues are more signifi
cant than others. But disagreement on
even those issues does not warrant blan
ket suppression of communication.
Example: David Duke. Make no bones
about it, I hate the guy. I hate his past and
everything it stands for. But when I hap
pened upon a protest rally at his speech in
Boston last spring break, I perked up. I
knew I wanted to find out for myself who
this guy was and make my own conclu
sions. So rather than protest, I finagled
my way in to hear him.
Well, the protesters drowned him out.
(Sounds familiar). But what I did manage
to hear was very interesting. I heard him
dodging the fact that he is an outright
racist by discussing relevant political
issues like busing, the drug problem,
homelessness and unemployment.
I witnessed his ability to make people
forget that he had been a Klansman by
arguing contemporary political issues
instead. I began to see how he might have
made it this far, and it scared me.
After considering his remarks and
challenging my own beliefs, I still dis

agreed with his conclusions about causes
and remedies. And I was insulted. But I
was glad I forced myself to listen rather
than to turn away and refuse to hear.
The only way to effectively oppose
such opinions is by understanding where
they come from and conveying that
understanding to others. You can't do
that if you don't hear those opinions, or if
you refuse to listen when you do.
Even David Duke realized that noth
ing is accomplished when everybody talks
but nobody listens. He had listened to
what Louisiana voters wanted and then
talked about it enough to make them for
get everything else. I was sad to see him
abusing that reality.
But I often encounter that environ
ment on this campus as well: Everyone is
so busy trying to convince other people
that they become incapable of consider
ing the weaknesses of their own beliefs
and unable to learn from other people's
knowledge and experience.
It's too bad because we have a lot to
learn, and in the end we are all both the
teachers and the students.
