## Higher rates cannot make employees cost-conscious 
### 
THE UNIVERSITY'S DECISION
to raise insurance rates for single,
non-union employees and to lower
rates for non-single employees clearly
and unfairly discriminates against these
single employees. I find the reasons
offered, as stated in the Nov. 4 Daily,
poorly reasoned, transparently false and
definitely insulting.
Does Barbara Butterfield, vice presi
dent of human resources, think that by
charging single people $25 to $31 per
month for health insurance, they will
become cost-conscious of the benefits
offered?
I don't believe for a second that the $6

difference between the highest and low
est amount single people will be paying is
going to have any significant effect on
which health plan a single person selects.
Also, if single people are urged to be
cost-conscious (by taking more money out
of their paychecks), shouldn't married
people and people with families be urged
to be cost-conscious by the same means?
Butterfield wants the health plans to
improve their quality and to reduce their
prices. Does anyone really expect any
health plan to reduce their prices? At
best, the rate of increase may go down
but, without a reduction of coverage, the
prices are not going to go down.

Anyway, charging single, non-union
employees more for their coverage is not
going to cause the various health plans
to offer more for less. I am sure married
people and people with families would
like to have higher quality medical cover
age, too; so why not charge them more?
I don't understand what would cause
increased cost to Stanford if a University
employee used his or her spouse's health
plan. What cost does Stanford incur if an
employee uses a spouse's plan instead of
Stanford's? If anything, for an employee
not to use the University's plan should
help to hold down the cost to Stanford
and to the employee.

The motives for this action may be a
good design for the financial future of
the University. The reduction of the
number of health plans combined with a
reduction of services, an increase in co
payments and an increase in the cost to
a specific group of employees all add up
to money saved by Stanford.
I find that single employees have been
unfairly chosen to bear the brunt of this
cost-cutting measure, and the reasons
offered just don't stand up to reason. I
urge the Stanford administration to
reconsider this unjust action.
