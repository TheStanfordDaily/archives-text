# Dance brings needed balance of expression among art, academics
## 
### 
It is by now well-known that the arts
programs at Stanford are seriously
threatened. In particular, dance here is
in danger of being disassembled as part
of the budget-cutting process.
We feel this would be a mistake, hav
ing serious effects for us and for the
school as a whole. The arts play too
great a role in our lives to be removed
from an institution as dedicated to
"breadth of learning" as this university
claims to be. Our class is an example of
this important aspect of Stanford.
Some of us have devoted years to
dance and wish, as do the linguists,
writers, scientists, other athletes, etc.,
to continue our training. Many of us
pay the amount of money that we do to
Stanford on the understanding that
this training will continue to be part of
our education, as outside classes are
very costly. For some, this is the first
opportunity to sample the our creative
side.

But most important is the balance
that dance brings to our lives. A wholly
intellectual environment is not a fulfill
ing one. The Ballet II class provides
exercise in concentration, an outlet for
stress and a forum for exploring and
expressing the ideas that we learn both
in the classroom and in daily life. All of
these benefits, in turn, enhance our abil
ity to return to our academic work with
attention, energy and heart.
Many of the students taking classes
in dance are exploring a new side of
themselves. Many have never done any
thing other than academics. This is a
tragedy.
Stanford claims to value integration
and diversity in education. You can't
have integration without a format that
can bring ideas together, and diversity is
meaningless without expression. Dance,
like the other arts, has traditionally
served to fill these functions.
Stanford is also developing a reputa
tion for turning out technically flawless
graduates at the expense of their person
ality and spirit. Don't justify it. We pride
ourselves on our uniqueness. The West
already has a Caltech. Let's not become
another.
