# Headline misrenders true feelings of author on department cutting
## 
### 
I feel compelled to correct The Daily's
gross misinterpretation of my Oct. 24
letter. The affixed headline "Liberal Arts
programs should go if they used
research monies" couldn't be farther
from the content of my letter. I resent
being portrayed by this headline as a
crass scientist who cares only about his
research dollars when in fact I care
deeply about the arts and humanities.
The point is that there should be no
connection between research funds and lib
eral arts departments. Consequentially, lib
eral arts departments should not be cut
when the University loses research monies!
If the overhead is used for supporting
research, then those support services and
the administration that oversees them
should be reduced, not the Drama and
Music Departments. If the University has
been lying to us and using overhead funds
improperly, then they should just admit
it, and new solutions can be worked out.
In the future, I hope The Daily will

read its letters more carefully â€” most of
us "techies" love the humanities as
much as you do.
