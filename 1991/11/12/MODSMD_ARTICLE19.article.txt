# Accused deserves full protection in Stanford judicial system trials
## 
### 
As someone who was active in student
government and the anti-war movement at
Stanford in the late 1960s and early 19705, I
am troubled by the move by University
President Donald Kennedy and the Com
mittee of 15 to lessen the protections for the
accused in the University's judicial system.
The University's judicial system is a
prosecutorial system in which the insti
tution faces the lone accused individual
and the judicial system should grant full
protection to the accused. I strongly
oppose ending the "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard. I urge the ASSU Sen
ate and the Faculty Senate to vote down
the Committee of 15's proposal.
