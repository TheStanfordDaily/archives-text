# Molestation alleged at campus day-care center
## Police investigating claim against teacher 
### Lesley Edwards 
Stanford Police are investigating an Oct.
31 allegation of child molestation involving
a teacher and a student at the Children's
Center of the Stanford Community.
Captain Raoul Niemeyer said that police
are investigating "possible improprieties"
at the center, which is located at 695 Pam
pas Lane near the intramural fields. The
center is a cooperative nursery school and
day-care facility for infants to 5-year-olds.
In a letter sent to parents Nov. 1, Cen
ter Director Nancy Golden said, "The fam

ily [of the alleged victim] continues to
express full confidence in the center, and
the child continues to attend."
Last night, Golden refused to answer any
questions about the alleged molestation.
In a second letter dated Nov. 8, Golden
informed parents that the investigation
has not been completed as she had hoped.
"Unfortunately, I was told yesterday
that the investigation will not be concluded
until the end of next week at the earliest.
"At the conclusion we shall hold an open
discussion about the situation to
which all parents are welcome,"
the letter continued.
Golden has asked parents and
teachers not to discuss the allega
tion. "Obviously it is not appro
priate to discuss this with teach
ers or other adults while at the
Center," the Nov. 1 letter said.
One father who wished to
remain anonymous said he was
surprised parents have not been
told about the details of the alle
gation. "You would think there

would be a meeting" sooner, he
said.
He said that he didn't know if
the alleged molestation happened
to a child in his daughter's class.
She is 1 year old.
If the alleged molestation was
"in my daughter's room, I'd like
to know about it,"he said.
As a cooperative, the center
combines the day-care efforts of
both parents and teachers. Chil
dren are always in the presence of
several parents or teachers, the
parent said.
"I don't see how anyone would
have the chance," he said. "There
are always parents or teachers
around."
