## Spikers get Carried away Vocal setter leads Cardinal against Bruins, Trojans 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Carrie Feldman, junior setter on the
No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball
team, is so laid-back her teammates
have nicknamed her "Rasta."
Talking to her off the court, you get
the impression that nothing can ruffle
her feathers. She sits back in her chair,
wearing sweats and casually talking
about anything that pops to mind. You
might be surprised, but it's an image
she's trying to shed when she's on the
court.
"I think I'm very competitive,
though everyone always says how laid
back I am," Feldman said.
This year she is beginning to show
her competitive spirit on the court in
concrete ways.
"I think I've definitely become more
of a leader," she said. "Players have
even told me they think I've been talk
ing a lot more, taking more control."
As the setter, Feldman controls the
team's offense, choosing what plays to
run and whom to set the ball to. That in
itself may seem quite a task, but she
also tries to be aware of other things
happening on the court, especially what
is going on with the other team. These
added responsibilities help her, she
said.
"It definitely gets me more in the
game, too, if I'm concentrating on
everything and not just setting," Feld
man said. "Concentrating on the other
blockers, their defense, who's playing
well. It definitely keeps my mind in the
game."
Feldman also tries to be vocal to
combat what she sees as the team's
overall quietness.
"If Bev and Coop stuff a block, we
just sit there and say, 'Yeah, that's the
way it should be,"' Feldman said. "Most
teams [would be] jumping in the air and
screaming. We just kind of take it for
granted.
"We have to learn how to get more
excited. That's hard for us because a lot
of our personalities aren't 'rah, rah!"'
Feldman's laid-back attitude is an
asset for her in other aspects of the

game, however. She is able to put mis
takes behind her quickly.
"I definitely don't let [bad] plays
bother me," Feldman said. "I don't just
sit there and dwell on bad plays because
I think it affects the way people play. . .
. Who cares? You just can't worry about
it because before you know it the next
serve's coming right at you."
Feldman has not always been so con
fident. Her freshman year, she took
over the starting setter role when
senior Lara Asper had a back injury.
She was forced to quickly adjust to the
collegiate game and learn Stanford's
offense, an admittedly difficult task.
Although she performed fairly well, the
Cardinal finished 18-12 and tied for
ninth place in the NCAA tournament,
its worst finish in years.
"Thinking about that . . . season
brings back lots of bad memories,"
Feldman said. "My mind was just bom
barded with information. ... I wanted
to play with the starters and I thought
I could, but then once it really hap
pened and I was out there in a game, I
thought, 'Wow, you definitely need a
year to prepare and learn from the
starting setter.' It's a whole different
game than high school."
Since then, Feldman has constantly
improved her game, and Stanford's for
tunes have improved with her. In 1990
the Cardinal went 27-4 and finished
fifth in the NCAA tournament.
"It's amazing to compare freshman
year to this year, and how much fun
we're having and how everyone works
together as a unit instead of six talent
ed individuals," Feldman said.
The transformation has not taken
place overnight.
"I saw [a change in the team] more
towards the end last year," she said.
"Even though we lost to UCLA, we
were realizing that we were definitely
coming together .... We are all juniors
and seniors, and we've been playing
together for a while. We've been
through a lot together. It's definitely
made us more of a team. It's been a lot
of fun."
In addition to becoming more vocal,
Feldman feels more comfortable with

her overall game. She attributes part of
her improvement to the tutelage of new
assistant coach Wendy Humphreys.
Humphreys, who was the starting set
ter at Stanford from 1984-87, Pac-10
Player of the Year in 1987, and then
played internationally, is constantly
helping Feldman get better.
"I've been learning so much from
[Wendy]," Feldman said. "Sometimes
I'm just like, 'Wow, why didn't I think
of that?'. . . . She just has lots of knowl
edge. She definitely pushes me too. She
yells at me if I don't have my hands up.
I definitely listen to everything she has
to say."
One huge improvement Feldman
has made is in her blocking game.
Although she doesn't feel confident yet,
she hopes to show off her improved
blocking skills Friday against UCLA's
powerful hitters.
"If I stuffed Natalie (Williams, the
Bruins' star spiker), I'd be doing flips
out there," Feldman said.
The UCLA match this Friday night
is probably the most important match
for Feldman and her Stanford team
mates this season because of its confer
ence race implications.
"It's going to be huge," Feldman
said. "Once we get over that hump,
we'll have a big sigh of relief. That's
pretty much the Pac-10 right there. We
don't want a tie for first place — we
want a solo win. It's going to come
down to the UCLA and SC matches."
Stanford hosts the UCLA Bruins
Friday night at 7:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion and then the USC Trojans Sat
urday, also at Maples at 7:30 p.m.
Thinking about the future is diffi
cult with the Bruins looming Friday,
but Feldman admits that volleyball is
still on her agenda, even after college.
She plans to play in Europe.
"My boyfriend's moving to Italy next
year because he's a professional cyclist
on [a Motorola-sponsored racing
team]," she said. "He thinks I'd like
Europe. He was considering looking
into club teams in Italy because it's
pretty big over there. I don't want to
just stop after senior year .... I've put
too much of my time into it."

Things are looking up for junior setter Carrie Feldman. After a rocky freshman year,
she has become the catalyst of a high-octane Cardinal offense. Feldman and the rest
of the Stanford squad have their sights set on So. Cal foes Friday and Saturday.
