## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The word has come. The No. 20 Stanford
field hockey team will face fifth-ranked lowa
Thursday afternoon in lowa City in the first
round of the NCAA Championships.
The match will not only be Stanford's most
important game of the season â€” it will also be
something of a grudge match. lowa pounded
the Cardinal out of the first round last year,
7-1.
But the Hawkeyes may be facing a better
team this year. The Cardinal has outscored
their opponents 16-6 in their last 7 games,
going 6-1 during that stretch. To top it off,
Stanford finished league play with a sound
beating of Pacific Saturday in the Northern
Pacific Conference title game.
"We all feel really good about where we are,"
said senior captain Susan Leckrone. "We need
ed to finish strong, and we did."
Finished, that is, with league play. Today
the Cardinal squad will head East for the real
finish, and try to show those teams that Stan
ford is more than just the best in the West.
