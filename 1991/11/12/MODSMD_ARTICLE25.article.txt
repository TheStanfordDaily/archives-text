C 6 O TANFORD VS. NEBRASKA
in bowl." "Red Machine Top-
Troy, 21-7." "Rose-
Bowling Cards Wallop Huskies."
These are the headlines of the 1941
Stanford Daily. Almost every week the
editorial cartoons depict a giant red
hot-rod driven by a caricature of a
Native American bearing down on
Bears, Trojans, Broncos, etc.
Could we be seeing similar head
lines in the future?
Back then, of course, Stanford's
teams used the moniker "the Indi
ans." But the color was cardinal and
the football team was dubbed "the Big
Red Machine." Stanford had played
football for about half a century by
that time, most of it pretty good. The
Indians had fielded legendary teams
and legendary players, and could boast
a number of Rose Bowl victories (and
losses).
One of those losses pitted Pop
Warner's Stanford team against
Knute Rockne's Notre Dame squad.
The Fighting Irish had perhaps their
most famous group of players ever, the

Four Horsemen. But on the other side,
the Indians had the man whom most
experts consider the greatest football
player in history, Ernie Nevers. On
that day Nevers scored all of the Indi
ans' points, despite playing on two
sprained ankles.
Stanford's reign as a football power
lasted 90 years. The John Elway-quar
terbacked teams of the early 80's were
the last of the really good ones. Even
by then the team was far from the
level of the 1970 team, which could
boast Jim Plunkett, the Thunder
Chickens and a Rose Bowl victory.
What caused this slide is not impor
tant. What is important is that Stan

ford is winning again — winning like it
hasn't won in a long, long time.
Lately we've been reading a lot of
dates in the sports pages: 1975, the
last time Stanford won five games in a
row; 1941, the last time both Califor
nia and Stanford swept both UCLA
and USC. The phrase "power shift"
has been thrown about.
Are we, indeed, witnessing a power
shift?
Maybe. Heisman Trophy candidate
Russel White has single-handedly
turned around California's program.
Stanford's Denny Green has been
signing top recruits annually since his
arrival, and has improved his team's
record every year.
Meanwhile, UCLA is having an
off year compared to what it is
used to, and USC is stinking
up the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Bay Area schools are kicking
butt this year.
But that's about all you can say.
Just because the Bay Area schools are
seeing success they haven't seen in a

while, and the Southern California
schools are not, doesn't necessarily
mean that a power shift is occuring.
After all, even Stanford's latest highly
touted recruiting class was outranked
by three Pac-10 teams: Washington,
UCLA and USC.
We need to see success year after
year before we can make any judge
ments about power shifts. And even if
the Bay Area schools continue to do
well, it is unlikely that their So. Cal.
rivals will weaken very much.
Perhaps the most promising indi
cation of an improvement in the Car
dinal's future strength is the attitude
on the team. Since Green first arrived
on the Farm he has been teaching his
players about the long tradition of
great football here. One gets the
sense that his message is getting
through.
Perhaps the '80s were a deviation
from the norm of Cardinal football.
After 90 years of greatness and 10 of
mediocrity, perhaps Green really is
leading Stanford into its next "Centu
ry of Excellence."
