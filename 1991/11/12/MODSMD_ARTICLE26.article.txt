# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
For many Cardinal teams this year, "P"
stands for postseason. For two members of
winning squads, "P" also means Player of
the Week. Jon Pinckney and Jen Potok
garner this week's honors after leading
offensive charges that kept postseason
dreams alive for football and women's soc
cer, respectively.
The Cardinal gridders increased their
chances for a bowl bid by beating the Bru

ins Saturday, 27-10. Pinckney stole the
spotlight with five catches for 159 yards
against the Bruins.
Sixty-six of those yards came on a touch
down pass early in the second half. UCLA
had just scored on a 75-yard drive to pull
close at 14-10. After a running play to
Tommy Vardell, quarterback Steve Sten
strom went deep to Pinckney. Both Pinck
ney and UCLA cornerback Carlton Gray
leapt for the ball, but Pinckney came down
with it. He took the ball in for the score
after Carlton was knocked down by pursu
ing teammate Othello Henderson.
With less than eight minutes left in
the game, a 22-yard Aaron Mills field
goal iced the game for the Cardinal,
putting the team up, 27-10. Pinckney
made the key play on that drive, snaring
a 42-yard pass to get Stanford near field
goal range.
Getting in range of the goal was Jen
Potok's specialty Sunday. Tallying both
Cardinal scores, she led the Stanford
women's soccer team to a 2-1 win over
Santa Clara, the Cardinal's first NCAA
tournament victory ever.
Potok's first goal was a short, angled
shot coming off a Heather Mclntyre free
kick. That knotted the contest at 1-1. The
junior midfielder's second score came in
the waning moments of the first half of a
30-minute double-overtime period.
Freshman forward Andrea Johnson took

a deep pass near the right sideline, beat two
Bronco defenders, and fired the ball across
the mouth of the goal to Potok at the far
post. With the goalie committed, Potok
angled the ball in the net.
Potok is tied for second on the team in
game-winning goals, with three.
Sunday's win earns Stanford a visit to
Colorado College for a quarterfinal match
in the NCAA Championships.
