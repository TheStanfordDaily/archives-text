# Men's soccer gets bid

### Brian Egan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team capped off a surprising regu
lar season Sunday night by
receiving a bid to the NCAA
Championships Sunday night,
the club's first since 1978.
Only two years ago, an inex
perienced Cardinal squad str
uggled to an unimpressive 8-11-
2 record, one of the worst in the
history of the program. That
1989 team featured an
unheard-of 11 freshman. Now
juniors, these veterans form the
nucleus of the current Cardinal
team.
"It feels great," said Jim Tallu
to, one of the 11. "It's something
we've been waiting for for three
years, and something that Stan
ford has wanted for 13 years."
The Cardinal (12-3-5) wrapped
up one of the most successful
regular seasons in the history
of the program Wednesday with
a 3-1 win over California.
Despite facing one of the tough
est schedules in school history
(eight of the team's 20 regular
season opponents qualified for
the NCAA tournament) Stan
ford emerged with a .725 win
ning percentage, its second
best mark ever. In addition, the
club set a new school record by
losing only three contests.

Stanford began its season with
ties over current No. 1 Virginia
and No. 2 St. Louis, and hasn't
looked back since, piecing togeth
er two three-game winning
streaks and a midseason eight
game unbeaten streak. While the
club's NCAA possibilities were
tenuous right up to the selection
process, Stanford greatly bol
stered its credibility with a 3-2
win over the sixth-ranked San
Francisco Oct. 30.
As the seventh seed in the
seven-team West bracket, Stan
ford will be challenged early and
often in the playoffs. Its first
opponent, third-ranked Santa
Clara, is arguably the strongest
team in the region, sporting a 16-
1-1 record along with a four-game
winning streak.
This is not to say that the Car
dinal will make an early tourna
ment exit. Oct. 18, Stanford bat
tled to a physical 1-1 tie over the
then-No. 1 Broncos. Indeed, the
Cardinal's 1-3-2 record against
other West bracket teams is mis
leading: In the six games, only
UCLA clearly outplayed Stan
ford.
Friday night, the Cardinal will
get it's second chance at Santa
Clara, facing the Broncos in Buck
Shaw Stadium at 7:30 p.m.
"Santa Clara ... was one of
our tie games that I felt we could
have won," Talluto said.
