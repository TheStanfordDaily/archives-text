## Toyon residents shocked by apparent suicide 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Two days after junior Daniel Lichstein's
apparent suicide, Toyon residents are
mourning the loss of their dormmate.
Toyon Resident Fellow James Fox said
residents were shocked by Lichstein's
death. "There's been plenty of crying, and
a lot of small groups talking about it,"he
said. "There have been some friends who
have been really broken up about it."
"Many people have been confused. [A]
lot of people have been upset," said Resi
dent Assistant Glen Tripp. "Some people
are upset because they knew Dan. Other
people are upset because someone died."
Lichstein, who irayored in computer sci
ence, died in his second-floor room early Sat
urday. The body was found Saturday around
1 p.m. by Roger Cornwall, Lichstein's room
mate. Fox said a bottle of pills had been
found on the floor next to Lichstein.
Norm Sanders, a field investigator for
the coroner's office, said a note had been
found in the room.
The Toyon Times, a dorm newsletter
that came out yesterday, said the note
indicated Lichstein "had been contemplat
ing this action for some time."
According to RA Hope Flannery, Lich
stein's parents "have been here all week
end," and Cornwall's mother flew in from
Alaska today. Lichstein's room has been
locked since Saturday, she said.
Fox sought to reassure students who may
want to blame themselves for Lichstein's

action. "It really wasn't something that had
its roots in interactions in the last week,"
Fox said. "The roots go deeper than that."
Those who knew Lichstein remembered
him fondly yesterday."He was very friend
ly. He was concerned with other students'
well-being and interested in their lives,"
Tripp said.
Tripp remembered seeing Lichstein at a
dorm campfire on Wednesday. Lichstein
"seemed happy," Tripp said. "Dan stayed
for a couple hours in a small group, singing
songs with a guitar player."
"I think he was a very complex person,"
Fox said. "He was very bright. In a university
of bright people, he stands out."
Fox said there were many chances for
students to talk with each other, residence
staff and counselors about Lichstein's
death. "We have had almost non-stop
groups of one kind or another," he said.
"We've been visiting students' rooms who
we knew were taking it hard."
Fox said many Stanford support person
nel were at a meeting in Toyon Saturday to
help students cope with Lichstein's death,
including Vice President of Student
Resources Sally Mahoney, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, Associate Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiyama and
Counseling and Psychological Services per
sonnel.
According to Alejandro Martinez, director
of CAPS, there is no standard reaction to
loss. "There are just a tremendous number
of feelings people have, and some
times they are contradictory feel
ings," he said. "Sometimes, our
own feelings get stirred up, our
own sense of alienation."
Martinez said people mourn
differently. "There isn't any one
feeling that people have. They
really start from different
places," he said. "Sometimes peo
ple feel numb, or they don't feel
anything about it.
"All of us in this community
have been affected by this death,"

Martinez said. "The most impor
tant part is to talk, to share those
feelings."
Toyon plans a memorial ser
vice Thursday night at 8 p.m.
