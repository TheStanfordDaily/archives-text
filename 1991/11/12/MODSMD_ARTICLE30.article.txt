# Chemical cleanup mired in negotiations
## 
### Joelle Linder 
Toxic waste cleanup, with an estimated
$5 million bill, has been a point of con
tention between Stanford and former Stan
ford Research Park tenant Aydin Corp. for
nearly a decade.
The University and Aydin filed suits
against each other in federal court in August,
but as negotiations continue, both sides say
they are trying to avoid meeting in court.
In early 1979, the California Department
of Health Services discovered high concentra
tions of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs,
in the soil and groundwater beneath Stanford
property at 3180 Hanover Street in Palo Alto.
Aydin operated an electronics manufac
turing facility on Stanford land.
PCBs are widely used as coolant for electri
cal equipment. According to Molly McGowan,
an environmental-protection specialist in the
EPA's toxics division, the agency banned the
use of PCBs in 1979 because they are highly
toxic and are a probable cause of cancer.
According to reports by the Department of
Health Services, the contamination was caused
by the manufacturing of PCB transformers by

Aydin and companies that preceded it.
Aydin has submitted several cleanup feasi
bility reports to the EPA, but according to Uni
versity Counsel Lee Thompson, Aydin's plans
for the toxic cleanup only scrape the surface.
In the lawsuit filed against Aydin, the Uni
versity objects to "a remedy that allows chem
icals to remain in the soil and in contact with
the groundwater" beneath the property.
Thompson said remaining PCB contami
nation will result in land-use restrictions
that will limit the types of businesses allowed
to use the property in the future. The Uni
versity wants the toxic chemicals beneath
the property more thoroughly cleaned up.
Thompson said Aydin's latest feasibility
report recommends excavation and cleanup
of the top five feet of soil. But he said a thor
ough job would mean an excavation of the
soil to depths of 45 feet below the surface or
more. According to the University's suit,
PCB concentrations on the surface are as
high as 7,000 parts per million.
McGowan said meeting EPA standards
for a public area where people work would
mean excavating the contaminated soil —
digging up the affected land and disposing it

— and bringing levels of concentration down
to 10 parts per million. Even in a restricted
area, "one that would have to be fenced off,"
soil levels of concentration would have to be
brought down to 25 ppm.
Aydin's counter-suit seeks compensation
for part of the cleanup costs.
Depending on the method and extent of
the soil cleanup, the entire process can
become very costly, according to McGowan.
Because of the high costs involved, Thomp
son said there's "always room to reach a res
olution of disputes."
Aydin Corp. Attorney David Loder
agreed. "We're looking for a mutually
acceptable remedy and resolution to the
problem to avoid further litigation," he said.
Loder said the main issue in any compro
mise on the cleanup will be "who pays for
what, and how much."
So far, estimates for soil cleanup range from
$2 million to $5 million. Aydin said it wants to
share the cost with the University since they
believe Stanford, as the property's owner, is
partly liable for its own land.
For now, according to the attorneys on
both sides, negotiations will continue.
