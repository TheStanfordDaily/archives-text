# Some profs support lowered proof level
## Accusers lose too many cases, they say

It is "defeating" and "frustrat
ing" when professors face problems
convicting students they believe
have cheated, said Sara MacGilvra,
the academic secretary for the
Department of Mathematics.
In her four years in the depart
ment, MacGilvra said that a
handful of students have been
charged with violating the Honor
Code. But none has been convict
ed, even when professors believed
they had "very, very strong evi
dence" of cheating.
MacGilvra is one of several fac
ulty and staff members who say
they are frustrated with difficulties
in prosecuting Honor Code viola
tions and have looked to a recent
proposal to reduce guilt require
ments as a way out of the problem.
The Committee of 15, a faculty,
student and staff committee which
proposes changes to Stanford's
Judicial Charter, has suggested
changing the burden of proof from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence."
The proposal was inspired by the
recommendations of the Sexual As
sault Task Force, but would apply
to all student misconduct cases.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole told the ASSU Senate last
week that professors, particularly
those in mathematics and comput
er science, have found it difficult to
convict students who deny having
cheated, creating a "high, high

level of cynicism about the effec
tiveness of the disciplinary process
for Honor Code violations."
The "beyond a reasonable
doubt" standard is used in crimi
nal proceedings and requires that
a judge or juror have no rational
doubt that the charges filed
against a defendant are true,
while "clear and convincing evi
dence" demands that evidence be
"explicit and unequivocal as to
leave no substantial doubt" that
the charges are accurate, accord
ing to committee chair and Law
Prof. Deborah Rhode.
"Ninety-nine percent of the
time, it's our words against a stu
dent's," MacGilvra said, adding
that sometimes students who
report seeing another student
cheat get "cold feet" when asked
to testify before Cole.
When a student denies charges
under the reasonable doubt stan
dard, a "doubt is already cast,"
she said.
"This new way would be a
more fair way" for the other stu
dents in a class, MacGilvra said of
the proposed change.
Twenty Honor Code violation
charges were filed in the 1990-91
school year, according to Cole. In
18 cases, students were punished
after admitting their guilt. The
other two students have also said
they are guilty, but their cases are
still pending.
Cole said that during the nine
