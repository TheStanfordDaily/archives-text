# Fraternity may face discipline for wild party
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
The University is considering disciplinary
action against the Theta Xi fraternity in the
wake of a raucous party Saturday that Stan
ford Police shut down in response to several
complaints ranging from public drunkenness
to petty theft.
Residents of Slavianskii Dom, which is
located next door to the fraternity house,
called the police after two bicycles were
allegedly stolen from Slavianskii and thrown
from the third floor of the Theta Xi house by
drunken fraternity alumni.
Police arrived at the Theta Xi house at

10:45 p.m. to find party-goers serving alcohol
to minors and urinating off second and third
floor balconies, according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"There were hundreds of alcohol-related
problems," said Niemeyer. Police closed the
party shortly before midnight without making
any arrests.
According to senior Michael Reeve, the res
ident assistant in Theta Xi, "the party itself
was not out of control, other than being very
crowded." Reeve defended his fraternity's con
trol of the party, blaming the alcohol-related
problems on visiting members of the UCLA
chapter of Theta Xi.
"We were very conscious of not letting any

one leave the house with alcohol from the
party," he said.
Police returned to the Theta Xi house at 2
a.m. in response to complaints from Slavian
skii residents about eggs being thrown from
the fraternity house. Although police found
"telltale evidence" of egg-throwing both in and
around the Theta Xi house, no arrests were
made.
But Reeve said his fraternity was also van
dalized "by a couple of eggs from Slavianskii
Dom, though I personally don't know who
started it," Reeve said.
According to Jehanne Gheith, the resident
fellow in Slavianskii, the fraterni
ty members were "very responsi
ble" in cleaning up the eggs and
repairing the bikes, which were
damaged.
Police reported the incidents to
the Office of Student Affairs, but
no disciplinary action has been
taken — yet.
"I cannot underscore how dis
appointed I am to hear of another
party getting out of hand at the

Taxi house," said Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson. "They
literally just came off probation,
and now we're once again wasting
time on this particular matter at
this particular house."
The fraternity was suspended
following a fight at a party in
February.
Jackson said he has asked the
fraternity to submit a "full and
complete and truthful report" of
Saturday's incidents to the Inter
fraternity Judicial Board and
expects the board to recommend
disciplinary action within one
week.
