Cambodia, U.S. restore ties
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) - U.S.
diplomats returned yesterday to Cambodia's
capital after a 16-year absence as part of an
international effort to maintain a cease-fire in
a devastating civil war and bring free elec
tions.
Cambodians are particularly hopeful the
arrival of American diplomats and U.N. peace
keeping troops will prevent the return to power
of the murderous Khmer Rouge communist
guerrillas.
The Khmer Rouge says it has abandoned the
radical policies under which hundreds of thou
sands of Cambodians were killed during its
reign of terror to transform society in the
19705.
But Western analysts say it has hidden
troops and arms in the jungles for a possible
attempt to seize power if it does not win elec
tions called for in a U.N.-sponsored peace
treaty.
Heart disease treatment found
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — For the first time,
a medical treatment has been shown to stop the
development of congestive heart failure, a dis
covery that could benefit 1 million Americans,
according to a major study released yesterday.
Researchers found that a variety of drugs
called ACE inhibitors can prevent — at least
temporarily — the start of heart failure symp
toms in people with damaged hearts.
