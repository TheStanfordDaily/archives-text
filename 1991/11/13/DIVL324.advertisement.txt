CSPP
Shaping A New Generation of Business Leaders
"I had a psychology degree from California State University, Northridge
and had worked in mortgage banking. This program combined my interests
in psychology and business in a very applied manner."
Steve Blackman facilitates organizational change, mergers and restructuring
in his position as an Organizational Consultant at Hughes Aircraft. His
work as both a research assistant at CSPP-Los Angeles' Organizational
Development Center and as a third year intern at a consulting firm honed
his interviewing, surveying, data collection and analysis skills. He has
written six training manuals for the National Management Association on
how to lead work groups and manage change.
The curriculum at CSPP-Los Angeles exposes Blackman to the latest
developments in organizational theory and practice, and this is cruical as he
examines job security in his disserttion.
Blackman is a fourth year student in the Organizational PhD program at
the California School of Professional Psychology, Los Angeles, a program
that develops professionals who are helping organizations respond to
complex problems in today's changing world.
CSPP offers PhD programs in Organizational and Industrial Psychology
