Holiday Phenomenon!
COLLEGE STUDENT
EMITS HOLIDAY GLOW
DY TOUCHING
SHIHIHG OBJECT!
The student who startled the campus by emitting
a holiday glow is still undecided about a mini
series. "If I do it, I want to work with Meryl and
Kevin, but I don't think my experience, while
very memorable, is that big a deal," said the
modest junior.
It all started when an Art Carved ring was
chosen from a large selection of men's and
women's finely crafted gold rings. The ring
with its lifetime guarantee was a holiday gift.
After wearing it, the student began to emit a
holiday glow.
"My Art Carved ring has a lot of memories for
me. I'm just lucky I have parents who ask me
what I want and then give it to me." When last
seen the celebrity junior was still glowing.
