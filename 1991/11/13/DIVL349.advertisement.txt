KEPLER'S PRESENTS
Wednesday, November 13, Bpm
Susan Faludi, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
and reporter for the Wall Street Journal will
discuss BACKLASH: THE UNDECLARED WAR
AGAINST AMERICAN WOMEN. "Susan Faludi
uses her dazzling investigative powers to zap the
smug detractors of feminism, the hypocrites,
backsliders, and antifeminists of all sexes and
persuasions. The result is a rich and juicy read,
informed by powerful logic and moral clarity"
— Barbara Ehrenreich
