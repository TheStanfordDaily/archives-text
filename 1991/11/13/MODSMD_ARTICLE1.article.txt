# Taxi case will go before new Judicial Board
## 
### Scott Handleman Staff writer 
A newly constituted peer review board will inves
tigate the allegations of misbehavior by the Theta
Xi fraternity at a party Saturday night.
A six-member executive committee of the new
Judicial Board — formed this quarter by the
Interfraternity and Intersorority Councils — will
evaluate evidence of wrongdoing and report its find
ings to Dean of Students Michael Jackson.
Jackson will decide later whether to implement
the board's recommendations.
At Saturday's party, drunken alumni allegedly
stole two bicycles and threw them from the third
floor of the Theta Xi house. Police found party
goers serving alcohol to minors and urinating off
second and third floor balconies, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Taxi members will submit a written report
detailing their version of what happened at their
party to the committee next week.

The new Judicial Board replaces
the Interfraternity Judicial Board,
which was composed entirely of
fraternity members and had only a
limited advisory role. The old
group did not "treat matters as
fairly and as thoroughly as we
would have liked," Jackson said.
Interfraternity Council Vice
President Chris Flanagan said the
new 11-member Judicial Board will
"bring in disparate views, Greek

and non-Greek, which will keep everyone abreast of
different perspectives." However, he said the new
board is "not formally recognized yet" because
organizers are still "fine-tuning the specifics."
Membership of the new board and its executive
committee has not yet been determined. The execu
tive committee will probably include Flanagan,
Intersorority Council Vice President Amy Meizensal
and Asst. Director of Tresidder Union Nanci Howe,
as well as an additional IFC member, ISC member
and staff member who have yet to be appointed.
Howe said the executive committee will review
alleged infractions of University policy by fraterni
ties and sororities, and the full Judicial Board will
be consulted only in serious cases of misbehavior.
"The best kind of approach in disciplinary issues is
peer review," Howe said. "It's the fraternities and
sororities that want the peer review."
Adriana Duffy, ISC president, endorsed the cre
ation of the new committee as a "really positive
step" that imparts the fraternities and sororities
with "greater credibility" in dealing with their own
problems.
Howe said the Judicial Board will eliminate poor
communication among fraternity and sorority
members, non-members and administrators by
putting "all the people in the same room at the
same time."
She added that Jackson "will have final review
and say" over discipline within the Greek system,
but stressed that "greater decentralization and
more local accountability" is the goal of the new
judicial process.
The committee derives its authority from
Jackson, who asked it this week to evaluate
whether facts are "sufficient to warrant some kind
of sanction" against Theta Xi.
