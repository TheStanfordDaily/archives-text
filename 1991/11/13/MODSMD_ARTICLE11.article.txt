David Duke's candidacy
highlights deep-rooted
racial fear and hatred

IF DAVID DUKE IS ELECTED
governor of Louisiana this Sat
urday, it will mean that 70 per
cent of white voters in Louisiana
endorse a former Nazi and grand
wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
In a country obsessed with the
minor sexual and ethical peccadil
loes of political candidates, it is
astonishing that a man who believes
the Holocaust didn't occur and who
is an avowed white supremacist
may soon become a governor.
Besides changing his appearance
through cosmetic surgery, Duke
claims to have changed his beliefs.
In his current incarnation as a
mainstream conservative Republi
can, Duke does not want to dwell
on his past.
But his willingness to indulge in
racial stereotypes and scapegoating
shows he is, if nothing else, consis
tent; he simply substitutes the
phrase "welfare recipients" for
"blacks." Thus, the "welfare sys
tem," which accounts for only 2 per
cent of Louisiana's budget, is blamed
for crime, unemployment and gener
al decline in Christian values.
Some observers account for
Duke's appeal by pointing to
Louisiana's chronic economic prob
lems that spawn frustration and
increase competition for resources.
Many Duke supporters like that he
is a demagogue and an extremist;
they may vote "to send the strongest
message possible" to a government
perceived as uncaring and out-of
touch with their concerns.
But this cannot be a complete
explanation. Whatever message is
being transmitted through votes
for Duke is addressed to minori
ties, especially black Americans.
Moreover, Duke's supporters span
all economic classes. And while
poverty certainly incubates intoler
ance, it alone doesn't create it.

Duke's candidacy is the latest
and most severe example of a
national willingness to play fast
and loose with racial tensions.
Throughout the 1980s, countless
public figures have broken an
unspoken public compact not to
indulge America's darkest side —
its racial fears and cleavages.
George Bush's 1988 presidential
campaign was aided immeasurably
by stoking the fires of racial fear
through his Willie Horton commer
cials. Words and phrases like
"quota" and "welfare queen" may
be essentially meaningless, but
they are politically powerful.
One Republican activist in
Louisiana has concluded that the
times have caught up with Duke.
Rather than being a freakish aber
ration, his candidacy may be a sign
of things to come.
What should the rest of the
country do? First off, Bush, who
frequently endorses candidates and
raises funds for them, should urge
voters to elect Duke's opponent,
Edwin Edwards. If the majority of
Louisiana voters choose Duke, the
nation should let those voters
know their dismay by avoiding eco
nomic interaction with the state,
taking conventions and sporting
events elsewhere.
Such an approach, however, is
inadequate by itself. There needs to
be a national recommitment to
improving race relations instead of
a habit of using them for personal
and political gain. And there must
be an effort to change the environ
ment of economic frustration that
hosts intolerance so easily.
One way to begin addressing
this situation is to revitalize gov
ernment programs like VISTA
(Volunteers in Service to America),
which serve as a kind of domestic
Peace Corps to encourage poverty
relief and community building.
Both Republicans and Democrats
need to understand that as eco
nomic woes mount, angry people
look for easy targets.
Louisiana is not just electing its
governor. It is pointing to the direction
in which America may be heading.
