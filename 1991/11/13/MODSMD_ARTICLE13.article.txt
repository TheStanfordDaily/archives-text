## The
						danger of stagnation 
### 
SOMETIMES I THINK the Japanese
are the only intelligent creatures on
the face of this planet.
I went to what was called an open high
school in Shanghai, China. This was the
school with the prettiest building and the
best equipment; therefore, if any foreign
visitors wanted to see a high school in
Shanghai, this was the place to see.
Every day, there was a morning exer
cise. We all neatly lined up in rows and
columns, waving our arms and kicking
our legs to the tune of some music. Our
foreign visitors were invariably curious
about our morning ritual. So the West
erners pulled out their camcorders and
flashed their cameras; the Japanese, on
the other hand, often lined up next to us
imitating our waves and kicks and gener
ally made fools out of themselves.
I remember these events so vividly
because at the time, our history class hap
pened to be covering Japan's Meiji
reform. That was when I realized why the
Chinese and Japanese started out in sim
ilar cultural and technological conditions
and ended up on such different paths.
The sentiment that makes Japan so
strong is exactly the same sentiment that
leads them to follow our morning exercises,
while what makes China so weak is exactly
what prevents us from showing people
what a real Chinese high school looks like.
The people of Japan possess a great
quality of humility. They are always learn

ing and absorbing. They learned when they
were behind the West during the 19th cen
tury, and they learn when they are ahead as
during my high school morning exercises.
So under the slogan of "Western Tech
nology and Japanese Spirit," the Japanese
were able to learn quickly what they
deemed superior elements of Western civ
ilization, adapted them to their own cul
ture and developed their own industry. In
fact, Japan adapted so quickly that it soon
joined Western forces, conquering, divid
ing and exploiting the still poor and back
ward China at the turn of the century.
China took a very different approach to
Western technology. We Chinese insisted
upon our Confucian tradition. Those who
dared to open their eyes and look outward
were looked upon with suspicion. Western
ers were often called "eagle-mouthed and
cat-eyed creatures," while Western technol
ogy was called the craft of barbarians. To
the traditionalist, anything outside of
China was where criminals were exiled. So
whatever came from outside of China must
be backward.
We Chinese failed to break away from
our cultural burden, refused to admit
that we had long been surpassed, that it
was time for us to be humble and to
learn. This is exactly why contemporary
Chinese history is a history of being beat
en up and exploited.
In many ways, the Chinese and the
American are a lot alike; both seem so

proud of their traditions and so sure of
their own superiority.
Just last week I visited a recreated
dwelling of a Native American tribe. I
witnessed the performance of their
dances and rituals. Seeing the village
made me realize that the continued exis
tence of a civilization is not inevitable.
As Western civilization rolls on, many
nations continue to face the question that
Japan faced during the 19th century. To
preserve one's own culture, one must let
die what is obsolete, as Japan was able to
do and China was not. So today, Japan is
enjoying unprecedented power and pros
perity, while China is still suffering from
her own arrogance.
During my seven years in this country,
the majority of the people I have met fall
into two categories, those who are inter
ested in "saving" me and those who are
not interested in me. Now that in many
ways Japan is exceeding her teachers in
many ways, will the tourists of the future
perhaps have a chance to visit a recreated
General Motors assembly plant and wit
ness the performance of Rock 'n' Roll?
