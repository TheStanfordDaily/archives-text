Comparison between <Stanford Tech 9 and MIT unfair

I READ RACHAEL HARRALSON'S
letter to The Daily (Nov. 8) with inter
est. As an MIT alumna, I am dis
tressed that my alma mater is seen here
as a symbol for a one-sided experience
unlike Stanford's "truly liberal educa
tion." Apparently just the mention of MIT
sends images of countless engineer drones
into the minds of Stanford students. My
question is: Who are the drones?
By definition, a liberal arts education
promotes knowledge — the pursuit of
knowledge for its own sake. The termi
nology implies knowledge in the major
disciplines without emphasizing a rift
between the arts and the sciences. A
biology major who has taken a handful

of drama courses has not necessarily
attained a liberal education.
Ideally, students with a liberal arts
education are instilled with an interest
in and appreciation for the talent and
achievement in all disciplines. The stu
dent achieves a depth and breadth of
experience without intellectual
parochialism. There is no reason why
English and history should be consid
ered more alike than music and math.
MIT is more than "a school for math
and science with a few token humanities
departments." A premier institution in
science and engineering, it has top-notch
programs in economics, linguistics, archi
tecture and music. Every department is

notable with the ostensible exception of
literature, history and foreign languages.
It would be a mistake for MiT to dif
fuse its curriculum by adding more
humanities departments if the support
and students don't exist just as the envi
ronment at Stanford is not amenable to
the development of a "Stanford Tech."
The strength and uniqueness of Stan
ford stem from its diversity and the cal
iber of its graduate programs.
To meet the needs of students wishing
to concentrate in any of its top disciplines,
a program comparable to MlT's is difficult
to fmd. The curriculum is rigorous and
the opportunities exceptional. In addition,
all students are required to take physics,

math, chemistry, physical education and
eight semesters of humanities classes.
The technical programs are unmatched,
and MIT students must take more non
science classes than scientists at Stanford.
Stanford was founded to support a
curriculum strong in many diverse sub
jects, while MIT was established to offer
a rigorous science curriculum with a
breadth of other academic areas avail
able. Both places offer the possibility, not
the guarantee, of a liberal arts education.
A drama major who can only discuss the
ater is as lackluster as an engineer only
capable of discussing integrated circuits.
