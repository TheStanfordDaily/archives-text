In her column, "The Power of Magic"
(Nov 11), Tamala Edwards reiterated a dis
turbing element that has punctuated much
of the rhetoric surrounding Magic Johnson.
One could conclude that HIV is now a social
ly acceptable heterosexual cause celebre sim
ply because it has struck one of her heroes.
For those of us, however, whose
friends, lovers and relatives have been
struggling with this nightmare for a
much longer time — some as long as 10
years — we wonder why it takes a media
event to shake this nation out of its
moral and spiritual torpor.
We grieve for Magic and his family,
friends and fans; we also applaud the dig
nity and courage of his public announce
ment, and we welcome the leadership he is
already displaying in his efforts to height
en awareness of this dreadful illness.
But please spare our heroes and hero
ines, those who have already suffered
more than their share of misfortune, the
indignity that is inflicted when their brave

efforts to live on in the face of death are
obscured by the plight of one famous man
