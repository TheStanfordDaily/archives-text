# Watch out: Post office squirrels purloin tasty parcels sent by Mom
## 
### 
Stanford students aren't the only ones
who are reaping the benefits of care pack
ages from Moms this year on campus.
Here is an excerpt from an actual
photocopied form letter on the remains
of a parcel in my post office box. "To
Postal Customer: Recently, the local
squirrel population has taken to attack a
select number of parcels at this post
office. Your parcel happens to be one
that these squirrels broke into and con
sumed some of its contents."
Oh, yeah sure. Squirrels. What will
these guys think up next? But let's say for
a minute that squirrels did eat my cookies.
Then what is the Postal Service doing leav
ing my parcel out under the tree? Or what
are the squirrels doing in the post office?
I have to laugh at the final sentence of

my parcel's obituary: "We apologize for this
act of nature beyond our control." Chuckle,
chuckle. Munch, munch.
