# Momentum from 'Save the arts' rally must keep going to achieve its goal
## 
### 
Those of us involved in the Ad Hoc
Student Committee for the Arts at Stan
ford would like to thank the hundreds of
people who took part in last Thursday's
rally, Art for Art's Sake, including
Deans Ewart Thomas and Carolyn
Lougee. Prof. Rob Robinson merits par
ticular thanks for serving as master of
ceremonies, as does Ben Evans, who
introduced the student speakers and
who, to correct The Daily's report of the
event, uttered the memorable line about
"travesty, boredom and brain atrophy."
Heartfelt thanks also to every speaker
and every performance group, who
demonstrated both the talent and diver
sity of the arts community.
We urge all those whose blood was

stirred by the rally to keep writing and lob
bying administrative ears about what the
ails mean. Keep the momentum going!
We done good, but it ain't over yet.

Committee for the Arts at Stanford
