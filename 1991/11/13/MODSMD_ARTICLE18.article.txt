# Mideast panel timing inadvertently excluded campus religious groups
## 
### 
We, the members of the Organization
of Arab-American Students in Stanford
(OASIS), would like to extend our apolo
gies to the Jewish and Muslim commu
nities at Stanford for the scheduling of
the Nov. 8 Middle East peace panel co
sponsored by our organization. We now
appreciate that the time, 7 p.m. on Fri
day, was in conflict with both the Jewish
celebration of the Sabbath and Friday
Jelsa held by the Islamic Society.
It was not our intention to exclude
any group within the Stanford commu
nity from the event. We will attempt to
avoid this problem in the future.
