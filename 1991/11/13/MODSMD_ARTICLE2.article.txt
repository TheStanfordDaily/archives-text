# Monitoring missed meetings
## Bill would penalize often-absent ASSU senators 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Even notes from their mothers won't
help ASSU senators who miss three or more
meetings, if a proposed bill to revise senate
attendance policies passes next week.
Currently, senators are penalized if they
miss three senate or committee meetings
within three months without excuses. The
new bill, however, would only allow three
unexcused absences over the course of a year
before penalties are leveled against a senator.
Graduate senator Robert Lodenkamper,
the bill's author, said he wrote the bill in
response to poor attendance records from
last year's senate and committee meetings.
"Last year, attendance records were kept
very poorly, especially in committee meet
ings," he said. "The committee attendance
records were unavailable, and someone could
attend 50 percent of the meetings without
any action being taken" against them.
Out of 40 voting and non-voting sena
tors, 19 missed at least one senate or com
mittee meeting this year without an excuse.
No data was available on the average atten
dance rate at meetings, according to Senate
Chair Kevin Warsh.
"It's not that hard to excuse an
absence," Lodenkamper said. "All you have
to do is call the deputy chair or the chair

and explain that you have a test or some
personal commitment or something."
But Warsh said most senators do not
take the time to excuse their absences when
they miss a meeting. There are far more
unexcused absences than excused, he said.
"Attendance has not been that big of a
problem this year," Warsh added. "We have
had problems with maybe two or three sen
ators, but other than that attendance is
quite good."
Senators who miss three meetings are
"displaced," which means they move to the
end of the voting line. Senators say this is sig
nificant because a majority might be reached
before a particular senator could vote.
If the first-ranked undergraduate sena
tor was displaced, for example, that senator
would then drop to the 20th voting place.
"Basically, what this means is that
everyone is bumped up a notch as far as vot
ing goes," Warsh explained.
Voting privileges are only held by 20 of
the 40 senators, and those 20 vote in the
order they are ranked. Ranking is initially
determined by the number of votes a sena
tor receives in the spring elections, with the
first-ranked position held by the senator
who receives the most votes.
Two senators have been displaced already
this year. James Yoon and Alva
Taylor, both graduate senators,
are now ranked last and second to
last due to absences.
Under current senate rules,
senators are suspended after four
unexcused absences. After five
they are expelled. During suspen
sion, the senator can attend
meetings but cannot vote. Sus
pension is repealed when the sen
ator goes to four senate or com
mittee meetings.
The proposed bill would retain
the same penalties if a senator
misses four or five meetings
throughout the year.
Warsh said he does not believe
that the bill will be controversial
on the floor. "The main purpose
for this bill is to make senators a
little bit more leery of their
attendance and perhaps make
them become a little more
involved."
Warsh said a student could
easily be elected to the office of
senator and not ever attend a
meeting. "In that case," he said,
"the person would be expelled as
a voting member, but may still be
regarded as a non-voting mem
ber" of the senate.
