# Monitoring missed meetings
## Bill would penalize often-absent ASSU senators 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Even notes from their mothers won't
help ASSU senators who miss three or more
meetings, if a proposed bill to revise senate
attendance policies passes next week.
Currently, senators are penalized if they
miss three senate or committee meetings
within three months without excuses. The
new bill, however, would only allow three
unexcused absences over the course of a year
before penalties are leveled against a senator.
Graduate senator Robert Lodenkamper,
the bill's author, said he wrote the bill in
response to poor attendance records from
last year's senate and committee meetings.
"Last year, attendance records were kept
very poorly, especially in committee meet
ings," he said. "The committee attendance
records were unavailable, and someone could
attend 50 percent of the meetings without
any action being taken" against them.
Out of 40 voting and non-voting sena
tors, 19 missed at least one senate or com
mittee meeting this year without an excuse.
No data was available on the average atten
dance rate at meetings, according to Senate
Chair Kevin Warsh.
"It's not that hard to excuse an
absence," Lodenkamper said. "All you have
to do is call the deputy chair or the chair

and explain that you have a test or some
personal commitment or something."
But Warsh said most senators do not
take the time to excuse their absences when
they miss a meeting. There are far more
unexcused absences than excused, he said.
"Attendance has not been that big of a
problem this year," Warsh added. "We have
had problems with maybe two or three sen
ators, but other than that attendance is
quite good."
Senators who miss three meetings are
"displaced," which means they move to the
end of the voting line. Senators say this is sig
nificant because a majority might be reached
before a particular senator could vote.
If the first-ranked undergraduate sena
tor was displaced, for example, that senator
would then drop to the 20th voting place.
"Basically, what this means is that
everyone is bumped up a notch as far as vot
ing goes," Warsh explained.
Voting privileges are only held by 20 of
the 40 senators, and those 20 vote in the
order they are ranked. Ranking is initially
determined by the number of votes a sena
tor receives in the spring elections, with the
first-ranked position held by the senator
who receives the most votes.
