## Researchers receive patent for isolated human stem cells New technique may advance AIDS, cancer therapy 
### Joanne Adams 
The recent discovery of a technique that can isolate
relatively pure human stem cells may lead to improved
therapy for bone marrow transplant candidates, AIDS
patients and cancer victims.
The technique for purifying the cells, which are the
"mothers" of all cells in the human blood system, was
recently patented by Irving Weissman, professor of
pathology and cancer biology, and his fellow
researchers at SyStemix Inc. in Palo Alto.
Human hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells
are unique because they have the capacity for self
renewal. In addition, they are multipotential; that is,
they give rise to all the different blood cell types,
including red blood cells, platelets and the white blood
cells of the immune system.
In the human body, approximately one out of every
2,000 bone marrow cells is a stem cell. However,
Weissman and his colleagues have succeeded in gener
ating highly concentrated preparations of the cells.
"We know we have a self-renewing multipotential pop
ulation," SyStemix scientist Bruno Peault said, refer
ring to the researchers' recent accomplishment.
Of particular significance to bone marrow trans
plant recipients, these cells — unlike the preparation
of cells currently used in bone marrow transplants —
are incapable of producing graft-versus-host disease.
Graft-versus-host disease occurs when transplanted
cells recognize the host as foreign and mount an
immune response.
Because the new preparation of cells does not
include the specific white blood cells that cause the dis
ease, recipients of these cells do not run the risk of
developing graft-versus-host disease.
Plans are already in the works for clinical trials to
test the potential of these stem cells to reconstitute all
the hematopoietic cells of cancer patients whose bone
marrow has been impaired or destroyed by radiation
treatment.
The techniques developed to identify and isolate
human hematopoietic stem cells were based on the
researchers' previous work with the stem cells of mice.
Weissman explained that neither computer modeling
nor test-tube experiments can accurately reflect true
stem cell activity, so the cells had to be studied in
intact organisms.
Because human beings cannot be used as experi
mental models, mice with "human" immune systems
were developed to study the cells. These genetically
immunodeficient mice were used as hosts for human
immune system cells.
Because such mice are not capable of rejecting the
human cells, they provide a useful model for the study
of human physiology and pathology. These mouse
models were used by the researchers in long-term
assays to verify that the cells they had purified were
indeed authentic stem cells.
Unlike many other types of cells, stem cells are not
easily identifiable. A two-step process is used to identi
fy them. First, mature, differentiated cells are
removed from a mass of cells. And second, cells that

posses certain proteins on their surface that are char
acteristic of stem cells are selected.
The isolation of putative stem cells is confirmed by
testing their ability to give rise to all types of blood
cells and by demonstrating that a limited number of
cells are capable of fully reconstituting the immunod
eficient mice with all blood cell types.
Weissman emphasized the cells should be referred
to as "candidate" stem cells. Peault added, "100-per
cent proof (that the isolated cells are stem cells) will
come from clinical trials. [But] so far, every test has
turned out on the good side."
With "candidate" human stem cells in hand, plans
are being formulated for clinical trials to be headed by
Karl Blume and Robert Nagrin, bone marrow trans
plant physicians at the Medical Center.
The go-ahead for these clinical trails, however, is
conditional upon a successful scale-up development by
SyStemics, "which may take several months," accord
ing to Blume. This will require "going from sorting a
few thousand cells (needed) to conduct experiments in
the lab, to the millions more for humans," Peault said.
In addition, "We need to make absolutely certain
that the preparations are toxin-free," Weissman said.
It is important that no contaminations are introduced
in the process of harvesting the cells or handling sam
ples, in order to ensure safety for recipients. Blume
said a minimum of 2,000,000 purified human stem
cells will be needed for each transplant.
The current clinical protocol calls for the prepara
tion of purified stem cells from patients with leukemia
or lymphomas and the storing of the stem cells frozen
for one week, during which time the patients will
undergo radiation treatment. The purified stem cells
will then be re-implanted in the respective patients.
Weissman said that, as a precautionary measure,
one half of a patient's bone marrow extract will be
purified for stem cells and the other will simply be
saved, unprocessed, as a back-up. This way, should the
stem cell transplant not work for a given patient, doc
tors will be able to re-introduce the patient's entire
complement of bone marrow cells.
Blume said the researchers hope eventually to extend
these studies to patients with brain or breast tumors.
In addition to transplanting human stem cells to re
populate a patient's compromised or destroyed
immune system, the enticing potential exists to use
these cells as targets for gene therapy. It is possible the
genetically immunodeficient mouse can serve as a
small animal model system for the study of diseases
caused by human retroviruses, such as HIV.
According to Weissman, "The primary goal of peo
ple at the company is to put a gene (in the stem cells)
that will prevent HIV infection."
Blume also noted, "We would ultimately like to
treat such diseases as sickle cell anemia or tha
lassemias by genetic means."
Many researchers are working on introducing
genes into stem cells and have achieved some success.
Blume believes, "There is no doubt that we will wit
ness (this technology) in the remaining years of this
century."
