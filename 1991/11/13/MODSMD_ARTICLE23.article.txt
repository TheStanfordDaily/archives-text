# Patent precedes paper, raises questions, eyebrows

The news that Irving Weiss
man and his colleagues had suc
cessfully isolated human stem
cells came to light in a most
unusual way: the issuing of a
patent. Usually, most scientific
achievements are first published
in scientific journals before they
are patented.
While this departure from stan
dard scientific procedure is being
criticized by some, Weissman
explains it as a simple misunder
standing. Weissman said he and
his colleagues did not realize that
scholarly journals' prohibition on
publishing previously published
material extended to patents.
According to Weissman, one
week before the patent was issued
the researchers were informed of

this and scurried to submit their
findings to a journal before the
patent was made public. An arti
cle detailing their work was writ
ten, submitted and reviewed
within the week and will appear
in "Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science."
SyStemix's patent covers the
procedure for isolating the human
stem cells as well as the cells
themselves. Burt Roland, patent
attorney for SyStemix, said that
patenting the cell itself means the
company owns the rights to any of
its applications as well.
Anita Kirkpatrick, a San Diego
patent attorney, commented, "If
it's the cell itself that's patented,
that's the strongest patent you
can get." She explained that,
while it is prohibited by law to
patent a product of nature, it is

possible to do so if the product
itself has "never been available in
a purified, usable form."
Contrary to what has been sug
gested in previous reports, there
is no conflict between the Univer
sity and SyStemics over patent
rights to the human stem cell.
However, Weissman indicated
the need for academic settings to
become more "aggressive" in fil
ing patents for discoveries made
by the faculty in order to help
shorten the lag time between the
moment a discovery is made and
the point at which patients bene
fit from it. He pointed out there
wasn't a single patented product
on the market that came from a
university; by the same token,
every single patented product has
its origins in an academic labora
tory.
