# Bug ventures to outer space, answers sticky questions

### Melanie Barnett Staff writer 
To the best of my knowledge there has been
no child in space. I would like to learn
about being weightless, and I'd like to get
away from my mother's cooking.

Q. What would happen if someone were
• transported to the vacuum of outer
space without a space suit? My roommate
says the person's eyes would violently pop
out of their sockets and his veins would
erupt, gushing blood into space. I doubt it
would be that gory. So, what's the story?
A .You may want to reconsider space as
• an option to escape University Food
Service. Space is not without risk, and the
consequences of getting caught in a vacu
um are most severe.
The old adage, "Nature abhors a vacu

um," is true. When an item at positive pres
sure, such as your body, enters the zero
pressure of a vacuum, there is a strong drive
for the two pressures to equalize. In space,
there's a lot of zero pressure to equalize
with your measly body.
If you are suddenly exposed to a vacu
um, you will only have five to 10 seconds of
consciousness in which to save yourself.
During this time you may experience:
• Paralysis followed by convulsions;
• Vaporization of your body fluids,
known as ebullism. Ebullism may cause
your body to swell to two times its original
size. This swelling will probably cause eye
bulging. It is doubtful that your eyes
would pop out of their sockets;
• Lung rupture from ebullism;
• Rapid evaporation of water from your
lungs, which will cool the nose and mouth
to near freezing temperatures; and
• Cessation of blood circulation. Blood
may even boil during vaporization, but it is
unlikely that much blood would gush into

space.
If by some miracle you are recom
pressed to a tolerable pressure within 60
seconds you might survive. (But you'll be
in less than perfect condition!)
While a bug such as myself would also
vaporize in space, there are organisms that
can survive a vacuum. Some bacteria can
survive a vacuum for at least five years. I
suppose being a thinking, feeling, complex
organism has its drawbacks.
. What is the sticky stuff we lick on
Vy .envelopes and stamps? Is it com
pletely harmless?
A .You will be happy to know that aged
• horses are not sold to glue factories.
Most of the adhesives used today are
either purified from plant sources or are
man-made.
The main types of water-soluble glues
that make envelope flaps and postage
stamps sticky come from plants. The glues

stick when slobber from your tongue turns
the glue into a gummy paste. Pressed onto
paper, the gum forms a tight seal.
Dried sap from acacia trees, known as
gum arabic, is the stickum on U.S. postage
stamps. This versatile chemical also pre
vents sugar crystallization in candy, makes
marshmallows more chewy, stablLzes foam
in beer, keeps ice cream creamy and
cements make-up to your face. Life just
wouldn't be the same without this dried
gunk from an African tree.
Gum arabic is considered very safe
because it is not digested by the human
stomach. I pity the people who had to
determine that the gum passes straight
through human bowels unchanged. Go
ahead — lick jillions of stamps — you will
not gain any weight.
