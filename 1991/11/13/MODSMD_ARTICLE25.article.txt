## Pullman wheatfields before Hawaiian beaches 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
As Stanford football head coach
Denny Green stood and faced the media
following his team's victory last Satur
day, John Wilbur, the Aloha Bowl repre
sentative covering the game, went
behind Green and put a lai around his
neck. One would think this show of post
season support would be appreciated for
a program that was 3-8 two years ago,
but Green would have none of it.
Ripping off the plastic necklace as
soon as he felt it touch his skin, the stone
faced coach made clear it wasn't bowl
time yet.
"No, no," Green said, "It's too early

for that."
Green and the rest of the Cardinal
have made it a habit to take things one
game at a time, but that does not mean
that other people have been ignoring the
fact that the Cardinal could be going to
its first bowl since the 1986 edition went
to the Gator Bowl. Stanford (6-3) needs
to win at least one of its last two games to
get the minimum six Division I-A victo
ries necessary for a post-season bid, and
that win should come this Saturday in
Pullman, Wash, when the Cardinal faces
Washington State. If the Cougars should
fall, a 7-3 Stanford football team could be
in very good shape when bowl selections
come out Nov. 17.
"They are a very marketable team,"

said Freedom Bowl's Don Anderson after
the UCLA game. "If they qualify (against
WSU) they should have more than one
offer."
The Freedom Bowl has been with the
Cardinal every step of their winning
streak, and many say that come Dec. 30,
Stanford will be down in Anaheim play
ing the Western Athletic Conference
runner-up, either San Diego State or
Brigham Young University. Yet just
because the Freedom was the first bowl
to be in the Cardinal camp does not
mean that they would be a lock if Stan
ford does qualify. The Independence,
Copper, and John Hancock Bowls have
also shown interest, as well as the slight
ly more prestigious Aloha Bowl.

"My report will will say that Stanford
is a wide open football team; as good a
team as Stanford has had in the '80's,"
Wilbur said after last Saturday's game.
"They are a very well coached, hard play
ing football team."
Wilbur, a Stanford football alum from
the 1960'5, admitted that he would per
sonally be happy to see the Cardinal in
Maui come Christmas Day, and that
could be to Stanford's benefit when bids
come out. As it is, the Aloha Bowl could
give the Cardinal a bid contingent on a
win over California in the Annual Big
Game Nov. 23. Wilbur admitted that the
picture is still hazy.
"Tradition is that there is a west team
and an east team," said Wilbur while
na.~>«ng UCLA, Stanford, and Oklahoma
as the western teams being considered.
"The Pacific is a great TV market,"
continued Wilbur, alluding to the popu
larity of the Pacific 10 Conference, "and
Stanford has proven it can beat any team
it plays."
Yet the fact that the Cardinal is still
one game away from an extended season
cannot be ignored. Pullman is a cold,
inhospitable place to play, and Washing
ton State has the No.l passing offense
in the Pac-10. Stanford proved against
UCLA that its passing defense could rise
to the occasion, but it still remains the
Cardinal's biggest weakness. Next
weekend's game is far from a lock, and
Stanford's coaching staff knows it.
"I don't think we'll be overconfident,
but we won't back down from being con
fident," Green said during a press confer
ence yesterday. "We don't worry about
who is favored, we take every game seri
ously."
Green has implanted the "one-game
at-a-time" mentality into his players, and
all refuse to publicly speculate beyond
WSU. Yet strong safety Albert Richard
son admits that it is an issue that cannot
be ignored.
"You go home and read 'bowl game' in
the papers and think about it, but you
have to remember that the main thing is
Washington State," Richardson said. "I'd
be lying if I didn't say I think about it. I
just hope things go well."
If they do, Green might let that lai
stay around his neck next time.
