Tan, well-muscled and with the wind in their
hair, the Stanford windsurfing team, founded two
years ago, is now an official club sport and is looking
for new members.
"We want to change the group's focus from com
petitive to an all-inclusive team focus and to encour
age as many people as possible to join," team captain
Anne Blanche Adams said.
In the past, the team has sponsored several regat
tas in the San Francisco Bay, with participants com
ing from all over the west coast, including Oregon
and Washington. This year, they plan to expand
their activities to include recreational windsurfing
and teaching a spring class for intermediate wind
surfers.
"We're trying to stay in tune with the current
trends in the sport and to encourage more people to
join," said senior Ted Huang, who founded the
team. Huang will be spending the next two quarters
training for the national Olympic tryouts in May.
The newest trend is sailing "course slaloms," a
combination of two events, the traditional triangu
lar course and a challenging figure-eight course.
The club is hoping to set up such a course slalom for
intercollegiate racing in the spring.
For those who are just getting started, however,
there are classes offered at all levels. To get a taste
of what competition is like, the club hopes to put on
weekend races for students in these classes.
The club is open to all new members. Anyone
who is interested can call Adams (497-6421) or the
club manager, Bennett Wiburn (497-2182).
