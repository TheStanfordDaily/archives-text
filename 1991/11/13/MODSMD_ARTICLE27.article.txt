# Hockey pucks Cal 13-0, faces USC
## 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The Big Game jokes started a little
early this year. The Stanford-California
rivalry annually provides both humor
and competition, but last weekend the
ice hockey version was mostly humor.
In the first of a four game series to
determine who will claim "The Skate,"
Stanford's 13-0 victory gave notice
that they are serious about not parting
with the trophy they won last year
while improving the team to 9-2 on the
season.
"This puts the monkey right on
their back," said Stanford head coach
Ernie Farrari. "In past years we have
been able to play and beat Cal by trying
hard to stop them and hope for the
occasional goal to win the game. This
season the roles have been completely
reversed, and they will be hard pressed
to challenge us."
Defense was one thing Stanford did
not have to worry about last friday.
With a four goal, three assist perfor
mance from Cory Sammons and both
goal and assist hat tricks from Luke
Winters, the Cardinal was able to out
shoot their bay area rivals 61-18. In
front of a loud, almost capacity crowd
of 300 plus, Stanford managed to pace
itself well by scoring four goals each in
the first and second periods, before

putting in five in the third. Eight dif
ferent players scored as Stanford
enjoyed its highest scoring game of the
young season.
"I was happy with our offensive pro
duction," Fararri said. "We didn't get
many power play chances, but still
were able to score when we were five
on-five. They had difficulty shutting
down our first three lines, which could
bode well for us in the future.
"We attacked their defense. Putting
pressure on their defense produced
errant passes and kept them from
working their offense."
The win improved the Cardinal to 5-
1 in the Pacific Collegiate Hockey
Association, good for second place in
the league behind 5-0-1 USC. The Tro
jans travel north this weekend for a
crucial two game series that could dic
tate the course of the season to come.
"This (series with USC) could estab
lish leadership for the PCHA for the
rest of the season," Ferrari said. "If a
team can sweep this series, it could put
good distance between the rest of the
pack."
The Trojans came into the game
undefeated, but did suffer a tie to Cali
fornia Technical, a team Stanford
handily beat twice this season.
Through six league games the Trojans
and the Cardinal are both averaging
6.3 goals a game, an unusually high

average that could see the twine of the
goals receiving more than their fair
share of abuse this weekend. As a
result, Stanford will be concentrating
on stopping USC's high powered
attack.
"This week's practices we will be
concentrating very heavily on the
defensive side of the game," Fararri
said. "We will implement a new
forecheck and concentrate on
backchecking."
Defense could be the difference this
weekend, an area where the Cardinal
may hold a slight edge. Stanford uses
three goalies in a rotational system,
and their combined goals against aver
age is a miniscule 1.2.
Game times this weekend are 7 p.m.
Friday night and 1 p.m. Saturday
afternoon. Both games will be played
at Golden Gate Ice arena in Redwood
Shores.
Card notes
Probably the most amusing part of the
evening occurred after most of the fans had
left. Former Tree Gil Blank accepted a $70
bet to strip naked and climb on the Zam
boni machine that was cleaning the ice
after the game had concluded. Blank got
tangled in the netting over the plexiglass
that protects the crowd, but managed to
slip his way to the Zamboni and into the
Dare Hall of Fame.
