# Alum rallied gay Soviets
## 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
While the coup by hard-line conserva
tives and the splintering of the country
dominated this summer's headlines, the
Soviet people also witnessed widespread
condom distributions and the first gay
rights demonstration in their history.
Stanford graduate Tom Boellstorff,
who will speak tonight in Annenberg
Auditorium, played a key role in these
events.
Supported by a Haas Public Service
Summer Fellowship, the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center and his
own funds, Boellstorff spent three
months in Russia this summer as a rep
resentative of the International Gay and
Lesbian Human Rights Commission.
Boellstorff said the summer had a
dramatic impact on him.
"It was very difficult, thankless and
back-breaking," he said. "But very
important and personally satisfying. It

gave me perspective and made me grow.
And BoellstorfFs efforts — from help
ing organize the first Soviet gay-rights
protest to producing and distributing
fliers for Russian President Boris Yeltsin
during the three-day coup — had a dra
matic impact on Soviet gays and lesbians.
The trip began last spring for
BoeilstorfT, when he learned he would be
able to visit the Soviet Union as a repre
sentative of the human rights commission.
He began studying Russian, applying for
visas and making other preparations.
In mid-July, he left for the Soviet
Union, where he and his fellow repre
sentatives planned to hold two five-day
conferences on gay, lesbian and bisexual
issues, first in St. Petersburg, and then
in Moscow. Although most representa
tives were there for just two weeks,
Boellstorff stayed for three months to
work on his own.
Boellstorff said the conferences were

"really amazing" experiences.
"They had strong emotional
tones. The people who attended
had never met Westerners, much
less gay Westerners. For them,"
he said, "it was powerful to meet
people who weren't afraid."
Forums on topics such as gay
health, self-defense and student
activism highlighted the events,
but the real crowd-pleaser, Boell
storff said, was the film festival
that accompanied the conference.
Six "gay-oriented" films were
shown with Russian translation,
Boellstorff said.
"The Moscow film festival had
a huge attendance," he said. "It
was the fifth largest gay film fes
tival in the world."
People from all over the Soviet
Union came to Moscow and St.
Petersburg for the conferences,
according to Boellstorff.
"Siberia, Byelorussia, all over...
They found out by word-of-mouth
and came," he said.
Vocal and visible
During the representatives'
week in Moscow, Boellstorff
helped stage the gay-rights
protest, which was held in front of
the Bolshoi Theater, "a tradition
al cruising area for gay men," he
said.
"For the most part, it was
about 100 Westerners," he said.
"Very few Russians. It was before
the coup, and the KGB still had a
lot of power. It was risky for them
— they were leery of being pho
tographed."
The protesters were demon
strating against a Russian law
that outlaws sodomy, Boellstorff
said.
"There are parallel laws in
other republics," he said. "We
were asking for the repeal of that,
and trying to call attention to the
AIDS crisis."
The group also distributed con
doms in front of the city halls in
Moscow and St. Petersburg,
events that Boellstorff said drew
even larger crowds.
"We brought over 40,000 con
doms," he said. "We distributed
most of them to people on the
streets, and gave the rest to gay
rights organizations to hand out
among their people."

Boellstorff said the confer
ences were "a huge time" for
Soviet gays. "It had big reverber
ations. If 200 Martians came to
the U.S. tomorrow and had a con
ference, it would feel the same to
us. It was that unheard of in the
U.S.S.R."
The press received the events
well, he said. A photograph of him
kissing another man received
"widespread publicity," and he
described the media attention as
"relatively good, and not afraid."
There was some homophobic
backlash, however. Boellstorff
cited a gay-bashing incident that
took place after one of the films.
In addition, Boellstorff said
work crews paved over the area in
front of the building where the
conference was being held, as
"scheduled maintenance." They
then tried to rope off the building
and prevent the conference from
continuing.
"We had a 'ribbon-cutting' cer
emony," Boellstorff said, smiling.
"It sort of ticked them off, but
there were no organized respons
es after that."
'Sobering' sites
Boellstorff and the other rep
resentatives, including promi
nent gays like Harry Hay, the
founding father of the gay-rights
movement, and Svend Robinson
of the Canadian Parliament,
spent some time traveling to
other locations in Moscow, such
as a gay beach.
They also visited the AIDS
ward in the city, "a scary, sober
ing place," Boellstorff said.
"The conditions were very
primitive," he said. "It was a
dark, abandoned and dirty build
ing; cats were wandering
around."
Once people are diagnosed
with AIDS, they are sent to live in
the ward, Boellstorff said, "even
children."
"The patients are very isolat
ed. Often, they're disowned by
their families. The doctors and
nurses won't touch them. There's
very little medicine, and many of
them just have to live in the
ward."
Although Boellstorff did not
go, other representatives visited a
prison where gays are held under
other pretenses. Gay prisoners
are kept in the "depraved" ward
to protect them from the other
prisoners, he said.
