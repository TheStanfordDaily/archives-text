# Recruiting still strong at CPPC
## 
### Alain Dalva 
In the job desert caused by
the recession, the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
makes Stanford look like a
recruiting oasis.
The number of corporate
recruiters offering job listings
and interviews has plummeted
at most colleges since 1989. But
the CPPC welcomed more
recruiters last year than the
year before, according to Rachel
Hahn, recruiting coordinator.
Although Hahn had no statistics
for this year, she estimated the
number to be holding steady.
In 1990, 515 employers
recruited students at the CPPC,
an increase from the 480 employ
ers who recruited in 1989.
The CPPC could not provide
an annual percentage of stu
dents who obtain jobs through
on-campus recruiting. "Our
reporting system is faulty,"
according to Virginia Mak, com
munication specialist and
career counselor at the CPPC.
She explained the center's
statistics are not accurate
because most students do not
report back on the outcome of
their job search.

Without these statistics it is
difficult to judge how the reces
sion affects Stanford students
looking for jobs.
Hahn acknowledged that com
panies offer fewer positions
because of the sagging job mar
ket. But many recruiters are still
visiting Stanford because "they
like Stanford students," she said.
A slightly less jingoistic expla
nation is that the California
economy is not as bad as the
economy in the northeast United
States where many of Stanford's
competitors are located.
Recruiting at California col
leges may have been less affected
by the recession than that at oth
ers schools in the northeast,
according to Jerry Houser, direc
tor of the career center at the
University of Southern Califor
nia. He did not perceive any sig
nificant drop in the number of on
campus recruiters at his school.
The recession has led to a
decrease in the number of
recruiters visiting some other
prestigious universities. Judy
Murraw, recruiting coordinator
of Harvard University's career
center, pointed to a 20-percent
drop in the number of on-cam
pus recruiters last year. "Local

companies were especially badly
hit by the recession," she said.
The number of recruiters
who visited Brown University
has dropped by almost one
third in the past year, falling
from 261 to 144, according to a
representative of the school's
career planning service.
And at Princeton University,
there has been a drop in
recruiters for technical jobs
according to William Toner,
manager of on-campus recruit
ing. He suggested, however,
that "things might be rebound
ing for spring."
Mak said she thinks job mar
ket opportunities for Stanford
students have never really
shrunk. She said the media's
pessimistic views of the job mar
ket has shaped students' per
ceptions and expectations, lead
ing them to believe the reces
sion was shutting off opportuni
ties to them.
Senior Joe Arzac said he
believes there is neither a short
age of jobs nor a surplus of job
seekers. He nonetheless warned
that this might change next
quarter "when everyone really
starts panicking about getting a
job."
