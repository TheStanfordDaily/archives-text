# Athletics budget not helped much by football wins

Even a winning football team
can't bring the Department of
Athletics out of the red, or so it
seems.
Despite increased television
revenues and a possible bowl
appearance, money generated by
the football team has been less
than expected, and won't make
much of a dent in the depart
ments $2.1 million deficit.
TV coverage, an apparent
money-maker, may have actually
lowered revenue by decreasing
ticket sales. According to Asst.
Athletic Director Karen Bennett,
"In the Notre Dame game, the
loss of gate sales was significantly
greater than the TV revenue.
"When a home game is tele
vised we tend to lose game-day
sales. What's very nice is to have
an away game televised."
Senior Assoc. Athletic Director
Alan Cummings said, "At a pre

liminary look, TV revenue will
simply offset the loss of gate rev
enue. Attendance at several
games hasn't met projections."
Cummings said the department
had budgeted a target of $1 mil
lion for TV revenue. The value
was a ballpark figure, though,
because networks don't have to
pick up games until 12 or six days
before kickofT. The dual deadlines
give networks a chance to base
their decision on the most recent
rankings.
With one nationally-televised
game on ABC, two regionally
aired ABC contests and four
games carried by national cable
companies, the projected figure is
now $1.4 million.
That, however, isn't expected
to be enough to offset the drop in
ticket sales.
"The 1989 (home) game
against Notre Dame was essen
tially a sell-out," Cummings said.
