# Athletics budget not helped much by football wins

Even a winning football team
can't bring the Department of
Athletics out of the red, or so it
seems.
Despite increased television
revenues and a possible bowl
appearance, money generated by
the football team has been less
than expected, and won't make
much of a dent in the depart
ments $2.1 million deficit.
TV coverage, an apparent
money-maker, may have actually
lowered revenue by decreasing
ticket sales. According to Asst.
Athletic Director Karen Bennett,
"In the Notre Dame game, the
loss of gate sales was significantly
greater than the TV revenue.
"When a home game is tele
vised we tend to lose game-day
sales. What's very nice is to have
an away game televised."
Senior Assoc. Athletic Director
Alan Cummings said, "At a pre

liminary look, TV revenue will
simply offset the loss of gate rev
enue. Attendance at several
games hasn't met projections."
Cummings said the department
had budgeted a target of $1 mil
lion for TV revenue. The value
was a ballpark figure, though,
because networks don't have to
pick up games until 12 or six days
before kickofT. The dual deadlines
give networks a chance to base
their decision on the most recent
rankings.
With one nationally-televised
game on ABC, two regionally
aired ABC contests and four
games carried by national cable
companies, the projected figure is
now $1.4 million.
That, however, isn't expected
to be enough to offset the drop in
ticket sales.
"The 1989 (home) game
against Notre Dame was essen
tially a sell-out," Cummings said.
"We were disappointed (this
year) because we weren't any
where near a sell-out." The Notre
Dame game was scheduled to be
televised on ESPN before tickets
were sold out.
According to Cummings, a
more profitable situation is to have
television coverage announced
after a game sells out.

'Football can gener
ate a profit. No other
sport can. Their
incomes just don't
cover their operating
costs.'

That is the case for Big Game,
which was sold out before ABC
announced it would televise the
game nationwide.
Cummings estimated Big
Game will generate roughly
$300,000 for the Department of
Athletics. The exact amount
won't be known until the end of
the season when total TV revenue
will be divided among Pacific 10
Conference schools.
Under the Pac-10 revenue
sharing system, every conference
team benefits from the success of
other Pac-10 squads. "The com
peting teams get the most, but
it's split," said Sports Informa
tion Director Gary Migdol.
Stanford gets four units for
the California contest, a national
ly televised conference game. For
the Colorado game, Stanford only
received one unit because the
game was a regionally aired, non
conference contest.
At the end of the season, the
value of the Pac-10 network con
tract is divided by the total num
ber of units in the conference to
get a dollar amount per unit. If
two Pac-10 teams face each other,
competing squads can expect
about 32 percent of the television
revenues, while the eight other
conference teams take close to 4.5
percent apiece.
The Pac-10's primary televi
sion contract with ABC is worth
$7.25 million. If a game is not
picked up by that network, Prime
Network may choose to air it. The
Prime Network contract is worth
$5 million. A regionally televised
Pac-10 game on Prime Network
is worth around $90,000 to each
competing team, Cummings said.
Although play
ing in a bowl game may bring
income, there is no guaranteed
profit there either. If the Cardinal
went to the John Hancock Bowl,
for example, Stanford would get
$1 million. This may or may not
cover expenses.
"You have to take into account
travel, hotel expenses, per diem,
etc. We have to buy tickets if sales
aren't high enough," Bennett
said. "How much we make from a
bowl appearance totally depends
on where we go."
The department doesn't
expect other sports to turn prof
its. Although six Cardinal teams
will probably compete in NCAA
tournaments, they are not
expected to make money.
"Football can generate a prof
it. No other sport can. Their
incomes just don't cover their
operating costs," Migdol said.
