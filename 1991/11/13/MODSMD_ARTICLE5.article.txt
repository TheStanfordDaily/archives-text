# Parents say center is safe for children
## Some nervous about molestation claim 
### Julie Cantor Editorial staff 
Despite an Oct. 31 allegation
that a teacher molested one of the
children, several parents say they
are confident that their kids
receive excellent care at the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community.
Kingston Chan, an engineer at
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, said he "feels safe" leav
ing his child at the center.
The center is a cooperative,
meaning parents and teachers
work together to supervise,
encourage and help the children.
Parents take an active role in the
structure of the center's program.
Chan said he feels comfortable
because the cooperative nature of
the center allows him to "see
what goes on inside."
The center has had a positive
reputation throughout its 21-year
history.
One mother who wished to
remain anonymous said, "It's the
best center I've found all along

the Peninsula."
The ongoing police investigation
of the molestation allegations has
left some parents with mixed feel
ings.
Gilberto Camasquero, a second
year student at the Graduate School
of Business who leaves his child at
the center, said, "I don't like [the
allegations! at all. I want things
taken to the full extent of the law."
Although Camasquero said
molestation charges may occur at
any day-care center, the uncer
tainty of the situation still made
him "nervous."
However, parents' feelings cover
the full spectrum. Noriko Kanda,
the spouse of a visiting scholar,
said, "Things are OK so far."
Center Director Nancy Golden's
Nov. 1 letter to parents explaining
the situation helped to reduce con
cerns, a few parents said.
There are 220 children, from
infants to 5-year-olds, enrolled at
the center.
Police are expected to finish
their investigation into the allega
tion by the end of next week.
