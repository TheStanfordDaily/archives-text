Drug may help AIDS patients
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (AP) -
The maker of the AIDS-fighting medication AZT
yesterday announced the development of an
experimental drug to combat pneumonia, a lead
ing cause of death among patients afflicted with
AIDS.
Burroughs Wellcome Co. said the Food and
Drug Administration has authorized wider doc
tor-aided use of the drug, now called 566, for the
treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
(PCP) in people with AIDS.
The company said the medicine should be avail
able by 1992.
PCP, an infection that usually remains dor
mant in the lungs but becomes active when the
immune system weakens, affects more than 80
percent of people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome during the course of the disease, doctors
said.
Haitian students arrested
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Police armed
with automatic weapons stormed a university
auditorium yesterday and arrested about 80 stu
dents who were protesting the ouster of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, witnesses said.
The students were herded into a corner of the
auditorium and at at least four were beaten, the
witnesses said.
About 10 Haitian journalists covering the
protest also were detained. Most were quickly
released but three of them, including a reporter for

the Voice of America's Creole service, were taken
away by police.
Unemployment bill likely
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bush administration
officials and top House Republicans said yesterday
that they had all but reached a pact with House
Democrats on a $5.1 billion bill providing up to 20
weeks of extra benefits for the long-term unem
ployed.
The agreement, which the House could vote on
as early as tomorrow, would begin to defuse the
four-month political battle between Congress and
President Bush over unemployment benefits.
Democrats have tried to turn Bush's opposition
to the measure into a major campaign issue, argu
ing that it shows he cares little about domestic
woes and the nation's 8.6 million jobless people.
Bush has killed two earlier benefit bills since last
August, arguing that the extra benefits were
unneeded or too expensive.
More U.S. bases abroad to close
BERLIN (AP) — Another 71 U.S. military
installations will either be closed or partially closed
as part of the massive reduction of American
troops in Europe, the U.S. European Command
said yesterday.
The new closings bring to 381 the number of
U.S. military bases in Europe affected by the
reductions that began in January 1990, an overall
cut of more than 25 percent, the command said in
a statement.
