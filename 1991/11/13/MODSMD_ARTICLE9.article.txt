# Czechoslovakia may be headed toward political disintegration

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) —
Parliamentary leaders from the Czech and Slovak
republics failed yesterday to agree on how to share
power, increasing the possibility that the country is
headed for a political breakup.
"There seem to be fundamental differences
between us on fundamental issues," Dagmar
Buresova, speaker of the Czech parliament, told a
news conference after two days of unsuccessful
talks.
Czech and Slovak officials have tried repeatedly
to agree on a new federal structure since the over
throw of Communist rule in 1989.
The latest failure is likely to boost separatist sen
timent in Slovakia, the country's poorer eastern
third, which has been hardest hit by radical eco
nomic reforms pushed by the federal government in
Prague.
Unemployment in Slovakia has been running at
levels above 10 percent.
"We must admit that the failure to reach agree
ment today will increase the pressure to adopt a
Slovak constitution in the Slovak parliament," said
Ivan Carnogursky, Slovak parliamentary vice chair
man.
Czech and federal leaders have supported a
cohesive federation under common institutions,
but Slovak politicians favor a looser confedera
tion that could allow eventual Slovak indepen
dence.
In an 88-point draft treaty that would serve as
a basis for a federal constitution, there is dis
agreement on 22 points. The problems center on

'A fundamental threat to the
entire economic reform and the
whole democratic transformation
of the country is imminent.'

Slovakia's economic hardship resulting from the
country's push to a market economy.
The disagreements mask long antagonisms by
the Slovaks, who have felt dominated by the Czechs
since Czechoslovakia's founding as a nation after
World War I.
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, the federal gov
ernment's chief economic strategist, warned in a
newspaper interview published Tuesday that politi
cal instability was threatening reform.
"A fundamental threat to the entire economic
reform and the whole democratic transformation of
the country is imminent," he told the Lidove
Noviny daily.
The Slovak parliament was expected to resume
discussions Wednesday in Bratislava, the Slovak
capital, on a proposal for a declaration of sovereign
ty. Though largely symbolic, it would be considered
the first step toward a loose confederation.
The federal parliament in Prague also was
expected to meet Wednesday to discuss a nation
wide referendum on Czechoslovakia's future, a
proposal Slovak deputies have blocked in the
past.
