HELP SAVE SELF DEFENSE FOR WOMEN!
An Open Letter to the Stanford Community
Issues in Self Defense for Women (SWOPSI 174 A) is in danger of
being eliminated as early as next quarter. As part of its effort to reduce
costs, the University is considering cutting the entire SWOPSI program.
We, the instructors of SWOPSI 174A,are deeply concerned by this. Rape
is a serious problem on the Stanford campus. At least one in four women
will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime. Thousands of women in the
Stanford community have been assaulted, and violence against women
effects everyone.
We believe that self defense training is an important part of breaking
the cycle of violence against women. SWOPSI 174 A has enriched the
Stanford community and has heightened awareness of sexual assault and
violence against women. Not only has this class been important and
transformative for the women who have taken it, but it has also been the
source, through action projects, of much of the sexual assault education
for the community at large. Action projects have included Take Back the
Night marches, dorm workshops, fraternity and sorority outreach,
speak-outs, and a variety of other projects that have succeeded in raising
awareness.
We are calling on you, the members of the Stanford community, to
make your voices heard. If you or someone close to you has taken this
class and found it valuable OR if you are one of the many women still
waiting to take this class OR if you believe that working to end sexual
assault should be a priority of this university, now is the time to speak
out. Every voice is needed.
Here is how you can help:
1. Write a personal letter expressing your views to Ewart Thomas,
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences. A letter in your
own words is most powerful.
2. If you prefer, sign and send in the form letter provided to the right.
We have left some space for you to add some words of your own if
you wish.
3. Pass out copies of this ad and encourage your friends to write
letters.
4. Circulate petitions requesting that funding be maintained for this
program.
DECISIONS ARE ALREADY BEING MADE ABOUT
NEXT QUARTER.
PLEASE SEND YOUR LETTERS NOW!
Dear Dean Thomas:
I support self defense for women at Stanford and the SWOPSI
program. I believe that sexual assault is a serious problem and that
SWOPSI 174 A is an important part of the university's response to
that problem.
DO NOT CUT FUNDING FOR THIS VITAL PROGRAM!
