# Progress may be hindered by cuts
## Committee concerned with future of multiculturalism 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University Committee on
Minority Issues gave Stanford a
positive progress report yesterday
but expressed concerns about the
potential impact of budget cuts on
recent improvements.
Stanford continues to be a
national leader in multicultural
ism, but must address many
issues, such as the role of diversi
ty in academics and accountabili
ty for minority hiring, said the
committee, which is composed of
staff, faculty, students and out
side experts on minority issues.
The panel announced its pre
liminary findings yesterday at an
"exit interview" at the end of a
two-day follow-up examination of
Stanford. A written evaluation
will probably be completed by late
December.
"In the 18 months since our
last visit, Stanford's standard of
excellence and leadership has
been tested by events both inter

nal and external," said interim
chair Blandina Cardenas Ram
irez, who is director of the Office
of Minority Concerns at the
Washington, D.C.-based Ameri
can Council on Education.
But the University "has set the
standard for higher education's
response to multiculturalism . ..
and that legacy will outlive the
memory of every adversity it faces
today," she added
A major concern of the review
panel was the impact of the Uni
versity's budget crisis on recent
progress made in multicultural
issues.
"The vice-presidential and
staff side of the house appears to
be floundering ... in light of the
budget crisis," Ramirez said. "We
are very concerned that the bud
get crisis may serve to mask"
inequities in minority hiring.
Staff morale, accountability
and multiculturalism in the class
room were among the other issues
the review panel said must be
addressed by the University.

"Staff morale is significantly
lower" than the last visit, said
Diana Akiyama, associate dean of
Memorial Church. "There has
been a loss of momentum, enthu
siasm and confidence in the insti

tution."
Akiyama said a persistent per
ception of pay inequities by black
and Latino staff must be studied

mittee on Minority Issues, delivers the University's progress report.
The committee suggested improvements in areas such as the role
of diversity in academics.
and "put to rest or redressed."
In addition, there is "little evi
dence of real accountability in the
review of plans," said Linguistics
Prof. Gregory Guy. He urged the
implementation of mechanisms to
compare a school's plans for
achieving diversity with its
record.
The panel's report on the devel
opment of multiculturalism in
academics was mixed. Bacardi
Jackson, an undergraduate repre
sentative on the committee, point
ed to the passage of the ethnicity
and gender distribution require

ments and strengthening of Cul
ture, Ideas and Values as evidence
of Stanford's steps toward multi
culturalism in the classroom.
But Clifton Poodry, dean of nat
ural sciences at UC-Santa Cruz,
said the academic core at Stanford
"remains a monolith outside the
activity of multiculturalism."
Both Jackson and Poodry said
they were concerned that classes
devoted to multicultural issues
might to be likely candidates for
budget cuts.
The committee was created in
1988 and charged with examin
ing the concerns of Stanford's
communities of color. It issued a
244-page report outlining 117
specific recommendations in
March 1989.

This week's meetings marked
the second examination by the
panel.
The committee listed several
other general priorities that still
need further attention, including:
• "Strategic inclusion" of
minorities in decision-making
forums,
• Appointment of minority per
sons to top leadership positions,
• Establishment of a process to
address diversity with respect to
disabilities and gender, and
• Maintenance of UCMI, and
the creation of an additional
review process.
"If you can appreciate how
much you have here and how far
ahead you are conceptually and in
terms of action, you can grab it

and use it as a force against the
limitations you may face,"
Ramirez said.
She added that Stanford
should "see the glass as half-full
rather than half-empty."
The Office of Multicultural
Development — created after the
1989 recommendations — was sin
gled out for praise by Ramirez and
other members of the review panel.
Sharon Parker, director of the
office, said the report was "won
derful" because it gave an "evalu
ation of the core issues."
"They said they were impressed
by what has happened here in the
18 months" since the creation of
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, Parker said. "But there is
no way that the agenda is done."
