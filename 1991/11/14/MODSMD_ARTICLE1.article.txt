# Progress may be hindered by cuts
## Committee concerned with future of multiculturalism 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The University Committee on
Minority Issues gave Stanford a
positive progress report yesterday
but expressed concerns about the
potential impact of budget cuts on
recent improvements.
Stanford continues to be a
national leader in multicultural
ism, but must address many
issues, such as the role of diversi
ty in academics and accountabili
ty for minority hiring, said the
committee, which is composed of
staff, faculty, students and out
side experts on minority issues.
The panel announced its pre
liminary findings yesterday at an
"exit interview" at the end of a
two-day follow-up examination of
Stanford. A written evaluation
will probably be completed by late
December.
"In the 18 months since our
last visit, Stanford's standard of
excellence and leadership has
been tested by events both inter

nal and external," said interim
chair Blandina Cardenas Ram
irez, who is director of the Office
of Minority Concerns at the
Washington, D.C.-based Ameri
can Council on Education.
But the University "has set the
standard for higher education's
response to multiculturalism . ..
and that legacy will outlive the
memory of every adversity it faces
today," she added
A major concern of the review
panel was the impact of the Uni
versity's budget crisis on recent
progress made in multicultural
issues.
"The vice-presidential and
staff side of the house appears to
be floundering ... in light of the
budget crisis," Ramirez said. "We
are very concerned that the bud
get crisis may serve to mask"
inequities in minority hiring.
Staff morale, accountability
and multiculturalism in the class
room were among the other issues
the review panel said must be
addressed by the University.

"Staff morale is significantly
lower" than the last visit, said
Diana Akiyama, associate dean of
Memorial Church. "There has
been a loss of momentum, enthu
siasm and confidence in the insti

tution."
Akiyama said a persistent per
ception of pay inequities by black
and Latino staff must be studied
