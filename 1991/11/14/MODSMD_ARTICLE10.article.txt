50 killed in East Timor
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — The Indonesian
army acknowledged yesterday that at least 50 peo
ple were killed during a pro-independence demon
stration in East Timor. A Timorese spokesman
said nationalists would retaliate.
The United States, Australia, Portugal, the
European Community and the United Nations
condemned the use of deadly force in the oil-rich
former Portuguese colony.
Portugal's defense minister, Fernando
Nogueira, called the shootings "an ignoble act." A
government statement condemned "brutality
committed by the Indonesian armed forces against
a defenseless civilian crowd."
Portugal gave up East Timor, the eastern half
of Timor island, in 1975 after three centuries of
rule. Indonesia then launched a bloody invasion
and annexed the island, whose occupants are
mostly Christians, in contrast to mostly Muslim
Indonesia.
Pentagon funds won't help USSR
WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders in
Congress yesterday abandoned a proposal to use
Pentagon funds to help stabilize the Soviet Union.
The plan, which two weeks ago seemed headed
for congressional approval, was scuttled by a sud
den surge of anti-foreign aid sentiment on Capitol
Hill, even though the proposal included no direct
financial aid to the Soviets.
The decision came as top State Department
officials prepared for three days of talks next week

with a senior Soviet delegation seeking new ideas
for helping the Soviet Union through its economic
and political crisis.
Breast implants found unsafe
GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) - A Food and
Drug Administration advisory committee conclud
ed overwhelmingly yesterday that safety data
gathered by Dow Corning fails to show the compa
ny's silicone-gel breast implants are safe.
The panel was to consider and recommend to
the FDA on Thursday whether the implants
should be allowed to remain on the market while
more safety studies are conducted and under what
conditions.
Committee members expressed concerns
about the lack of information on how long the
implants will last before deteriorating or ruptur
ing, whether the implants are associated with
cancer or immune disorders and whether they
interfere with mammograms in detecting breast
tumors.
