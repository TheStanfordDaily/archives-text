# Edwards leads Duke as Saturday election nears
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A
voter survey completed three days
ago gives former Gov. Edwin
Edwards the lead in Louisiana's
governor's race, even when the
"hidden vote" for state Rep.
David Duke is factored in, a poll
ster said yesterday.
Fifty-two percent of the respon
dents to the poll said they would
vote for Edwards, while only 26
percent said they would vote for
Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan lead
er and Nazi sympathizer. Twenty
two percent were undecided.
But pollsters generally agree
that many Duke supporters won't
express their preference. When
University of New Orleans politi
cal researcher Susan Howell
adjusted the poll data to account
for that, the figures showed
Edwards with 46 percent, Duke
with 40 percent and 14 percent
undecided.
"Even after the adjustment,
Edwards by six points," Howell
said. "Basically, all the methods
came to the same conclusion. As of
November 10, Edwards leads the
race."
The UNO poll was conducted

Nov. 6-10 by telephone. Howell said
701 registered voters were contact
ed and the poll has a margin for
error of plus or minus 3.6 percent.
Howell said she adjusted poll
results by measuring responses to
questions about Duke. Those who
answered yes when asked if Duke
was "inspiring" or if Duke "really
cares for me" were counted among
Duke supporters.
The election is Saturday.
Release of the poll came a day
after the candidates exchanged
charges of race baiting in a last
ditch ploy to win votes.
"That's like the skunk calling
the peacock ugly. That's unreal,"
Edwards said Tuesday after Duke
accused his campaign of planning
"dirty tricks" — including bring
ing in bogus Klansmen — to try to
stir up racial strife.
Edwards, a Democrat who has
served three terms as governor,
has concentrated his final days of
the campaign in largely black New
Orleans. About 27 percent of the
state's 2.2 million voters are black.
At a rally of about 700 people
in Lake Charles, Duke charged
that a liberal media in concert

with Edwards were stirring racial
hatred. He complained that news
papers have run pictures of noos
es and stories about lynchings.
"They are trying to fan racial
flames and produce a bloc vote for
a particular candidate," Duke
said.
Duke, a former KKK grand wiz
ard who has espoused Nazi beliefs,
said he is under attack by "ultra
liberals" throughout the nation.
Speaking in Columbia, Mo.,
former President Jimmy Carter
said Louisiana will be "a state liv
ing in disgrace, justifiably so," if
Duke wins.
"I think if the people of
Louisiana choose Duke, there is
going to be a tremendous world
wide aversion to Louisiana,"
Carter told reporters.
Duke called such warnings —
and suggestions by Edwards that
a Duke victory would drive busi
nesses out of Louisiana — a "kind
of economic intimidation."
Speaking to 1,500 at a rally in
New Orleans, Edwards predicted
his own victory and said the elec
tion would be a springboard for
the state's economy.
