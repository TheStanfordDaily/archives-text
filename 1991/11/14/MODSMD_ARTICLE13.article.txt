## Shame on Fac Sen 
### 
Senators had better
fulfill responsibility
and attend meetings

NOBODY LIKES A meeting.
But then again, nobody
likes anybody who shirks
his or her responsibilities.
To that end, the members of the
Faculty Senate who skipped out on
last week's meeting, during which
the senators were scheduled to
vote on the Committee of 15's pro
posal to lower the Judicial Char
ter's burden of proof, should be
ashamed of themselves.
During the meeting, senators
discussed the committee's propos
al, which would make it easier to
prove student misconduct. They
weren't able to vote, however,
because one senator walked out,
breaking the quorum.
While it is true the meeting ran
overtime, it is the responsibility of
senators first to come, and then to
remain until issues are resolved.
The presence or absence of one
person should not have defined the
length of debate.
Moreover, it is shameful that
Law Profs. Deborah Rhode and
Robert Weisberg, both members of
the Committee of 15, would try to
ease the passage of their proposals
with a contrived, Oxford Union
style debate. Although Weisberg
promised to remain "lawyerly," it
is hard to take seriously debate
between members of the chorus.
One would hope the senators
understand their responsibility to
scrutinize such tactics and to ques
tion the reliability of people who
would use them.
One would also hope that the
faculty cares enough about the
issue to attend the meeting and
come to some conclusion when the
senate meets next week. Despite
what committee chair Rhode has
said, lowering the burden of proof
does have the potential to affect
student life at Stanford drastically.

It is not plausible that the
chance of convicting innocent stu
dents would not increase if the
probability of convicting the guilty
increased, as Rhode said. Consider
the obvious equation: If more peo
ple are convicted of wrongdoing,
the chances of miscarried justice
also increase.
A hundred wrong acquittals is not
worth one wrong conviction, regard
less of what Rhode said at the Facul
ty Senate meeting. She claimed stu
dents are victimized by their peers
who cheat. This is true. This victim
ization would be just as widespread,
however, with the greater possibility
that wrongly accused students could
be convicted.
Moreover, the burden of proof
must remain high because of the
power imbalance between stu
dents and professors. When con
viction can be made based on a stu
dent's word against a professor's,
the balance of power is already in
favor of the professor. It is not
"peculiar," as Rhode said, that stu
dents are afforded a higher burden
of proof than professors, given this
inequity of credibility.
Cheating isn't the only offense a
student can commit. Students can
be punished for protests, too. Right
now, it is difficult to punish stu
dents for such activity. If the bur
den of proof is lowered, that may
no longer be the case. Free speech
may not survive the one-two blow
of this proposal and the Funda
mental Standard interpretation.
However admirable the commit
tee's true intent is — to build con
fidence in Stanford's judicial sys
tem — the solution is inappropri
ate.
Require witnesses to come
forth, as the committee has sug
gested. But don't throw out due
process in order to improve the
conviction rate, and don't blame
inadequacies in information-gath
ering on the standard of proof.
Perhaps, when this issue comes
to a vote at the senate meeting a
week from today, enough senators
will come so that thoughtful debate
— and a quorum — can be achieved.
