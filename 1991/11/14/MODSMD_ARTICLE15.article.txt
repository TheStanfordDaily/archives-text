David duke has no election
office in New Orleans. African-
Americans comprise a majority of
the population in the city, and Orleans
parish of which it is a part, and Duke does
little campaigning here. He keeps his
headquarters in neighboring Jefferson
parish, in the town of Metairie.
Last Sunday, I took a cab from New
Orleans to Metairie and watched the
neighborhoods change from the poor
black sections of Orleans parish to the
middle class white suburbs of Jefferson.
The driver's accent and the blocks of run
down wooden houses fronted by long
porches were uniquely southern. The
pattern of economic segregation was not.
Duke's headquarters are in a tidy and quiet
residential neighborhood, and I was greeted by
Howie Farrell, Duke's campaign manager.
Farrell is a tall, cordial, straight-talk
ing man in his mid-40s. He sported a
white and blue "Duke for Governor"
baseball cap and an excited look of antici
pation. He was eager to talk about Duke
and about himself.
Farrell grew up in Jefferson parish and
has been politically active since he returned
from a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1967. He
didn't like the changes that had taken place
during his three years in Vietnam.
"I felt I had lost the country I loved,"
he said. "I believed in patriotism and the
red, white and blue and that America is
always right. But when I came back home

all I saw was civil disobedience and riot
ing and burning."
He joined the New Orleans Police
Department and began monitoring the
activities of various political groups like the
Students for Democratic Society, the Black
Panthers and the Weather Underground.
He also watched the Ku Klux Klan.
Farrell claims the first time he went to
monitor a KKK rally led by Duke, "within
15 minutes it became clear to us that we
didn't need to monitor them. Duke wasn't
advocating violent overthrow of the gov
ernment. He was talking against violence.
He was telling the Klan to take off their
masks and work within the system."
Farrell began speaking with Duke and
discovered they shared many political
views. Like Duke, Farrell believes, "that
people tend to gravitate to their own
race." He argues that government should
just let people be.
However, government, he told me, has
done just the opposite. It has created a
vast system of reverse discrimination, in
which white communities are fractured
by forced busing and the economy is crip
pled by welfare and affirmative action
systems which reward irresponsibility
and ignore merit.
"Americans need more freedoms and
less government," Farrell said, "and white
people are tired of guilt complexes. Blacks
say they are proud to be black; we should
be able to say we are proud to be white.

"We need to give people more choice in
their lives," he continued, "If someone
wants to sell their house to a white per
son, or doesn't want to serve blacks in
their store, they should be allowed."
Farrell reserved his strongest attack
for welfare policy. He said Louisiana's
economic ruin was largely a result of
wasting money on a bureaucracy that
pays single black mothers to stay in
poverty and give birth to more children.
Duke wants to abolish the system that,
he claims, breeds a growing population of
urban poor. "A program of birth-rate
control is one of our long-term goals,"
Farrell said.
The land of Jefferson and Orleans
parishes is smooth and low. No natural
boundaries separate one section from
another. But the black and white com
munities are so separated there might
just as well be high walls and gates
between them.
In fits and starts, America has tried to
open up gates of opportunity and equali
ty for all its citizens. This Saturday,
David Duke will try to lock them shut.
