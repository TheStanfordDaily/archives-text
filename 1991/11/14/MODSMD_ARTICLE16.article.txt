## Political correctness still a threat to free thinking 
### 
AFTER INTERVIEWS WITH stu
dents in the Bay Area, the San
Francisco Chronicle concluded on
Oct. 30 that free expression has been
gravely set back, as even "liberal educa
tors concede," on local college campuses.
A group that calls itself Teachers for
a Democratic Culture has undertaken to
discredit this finding. In a recent col
umn, George Will takes them on and
documents flagrant abuses in the name
of "political correctness" across America,
including the case of Prof. Alan Gribben,
who was literally hounded off a Texas
campus for daring to disapprove of a
politicized Freshman English course.
Will had previously written that the
battle for openness on our campuses is
more crucial for our survival than the
struggle symbolized by the Berlin Wall.

What about Stanford: Aren't we
immune to that sort of crude behavior?
Our officials tell us everything is hunky
dory, that our Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues curriculum didn't eliminate any
thing essential to the study of Western
culture, despite the clear mandate to
slant it toward the well-known "victims"
and expose the guilt of the white males.
Our local students have sometimes
pierced through this obvious fraud, and
several have spoken out against the bla
tant politicization of the program. The
fact that many of the leading culture
critics of our time, often liberal, have
attacked anti-Western multiculturalism
should make the ideological fanatics
pause a bit in their crusade, but that
would imply a willingness to listen to
reason not characteristic of fanatics of

the "politically correct" stripe.
I am not talking in abstractions:
There are professors here who will not
speak to others who have voted their
consciences in tenure cases where the
candidate was "minority." If you do not
think the way they do, ideologically, your
chance of getting, say, into the Humani
ties Center is virtually nil; you will be all
but deprived of students even if you are
the world's expert in a subject — I am
speaking of perhaps a half-dozen major
figures who have suffered in that way.
Here is one of my favorite examples:
A "minority" graduate student came
into a certain department, and the other
students quickly advised him not to take
any course with Prof. X, whom they
deemed "incorrect."
But the new student liked X's writ-

ings, decided to take courses with him,
became a loyal supporter and friend, and
informed him what the others had done.
X told this story to a journalist who
made a column out of it. The result was
that the boycott against the professor,
the world's authority in his important
field, became complete and he decided on
early retirement.
This is an absolutely true account
that, if not quite as dramatic as
Gribben's, nevertheless gives some
inkling of what the price of independent
thinking — mild conservatism in the case
of X — has been at Stanford since 1968.
A university which is dominated by
this kind of intolerance is quite obvious
ly destroying itself intellectually.
