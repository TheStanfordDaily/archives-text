# Picture of Spaniards should not represent all European cultures
## 
### 
I have been saddened to learn of the
decimation of the indigenous peoples of
the Americas in history classes here at
Stanford. Yet the letter by Angelique
Jackson disturbed me deeply. Jackson
claims that "nobody from an Indigenous
Nation would do [the things Columbus
did] to another people."
The Aztecs were a fierce tribe whose
expansionist regime dominated central
Mexico. The rulers demanded tribute
from the commoners, as Columbus
demanded gold from the Arawaks. Aztecs
accepted slaves as tribute from conquered
tribes, like Columbus who enslaved the
Arawaks and took them to Spain.
The Aztecs also held mass human
sacrifice ceremonies, killing as many as
10,000 people at a time. Sometimes the
conquered people's flesh was served at

victory banquets in a stew, like Colum
bus' "slow-cooking" of indigenous lead
ers, as mentioned in Jackson's letter.
Despite the actions of the Aztecs, I
would never suggest that the Aztecs rep
resented all the diverse tribes of the
Americas, or that all were responsible
for the oppression and bloodshed. How
then, can Jackson suggest that one
man's actions can represent a continent
of people as varied in background and
heritage as Europeans are?
Jackson insists that Stanford stu
dents "deserve the truth." I agree. But
the truth is not so simple that a single
historical figure can be a scapegoat for
centuries of incompetent, abusive poli
cies by the Spanish crown and its impe
rialistic brethren.
To lump all people of European
descent into a group who .. hate
everything in this world ..." due to the
actions of the same imperialist govern
ment is unfair. Unfounded generaliza
tions such as these are exactly what
cause students to feel defensive and
afraid to speak their minds.

Unless we can base our opinions on
objective, factual information about each
other, multiculturalism will never be
realized.
