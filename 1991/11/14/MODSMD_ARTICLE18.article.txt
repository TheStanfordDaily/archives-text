# Record of recruitment shows Berger believes in saving Stanford art
## 
### 
The Daily's article of Nov. 5, 1991
("Severe cuts threaten music perfor
mance programs") quotes "some mem
bers of the [Musicl Department, who
spoke on condition of anonymity," as
saying: "Music Department Chair
Karol Berger has barely supported the
performing arts during his five-year
tenure at Stanford," and "his position
has been that the performing arts don't
have a place at a research university."
Your readers will be relieved to hear

that these opinions are quite inaccurate.
Three of the very best performers we
have in the department have been
recruited with my active participation in
the last two years alone: the musicolo
gist Laurence Dreyfus, who is a world
class viola da gamba player; the conduc
tor Robert Black, who is among the most
highly regarded interpreters of contem
porary music in this country; and the
young pianist Frederick Weldy, who is
pursuing a very active international
career as a soloist and accompanist.
This record is a sufficient testimony to
my belief that a great research university
must find a place for performing artists of
truly superior caliber and that our stu
dents, undergraduate and graduate,
majors and non-majors, should have the
opportunity of being instructed by the
first-rate musicians we have in the depart
ment. I am convinced that performance
should continue to be an important com
ponent of the music program at Stanford,
and I remain confident that it will.
Karol Berger
Music Department Chair
