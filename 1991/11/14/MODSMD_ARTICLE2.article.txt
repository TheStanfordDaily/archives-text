# Confidence in day-care remains high

### Julia Sobrevilla Staff Writer 
No parents have withdrawn their children
from the Children's Center of the Stanford
Community after a recent allegation that a
teacher molested a child, a University admin
istrator said yesterday.
"Parents continue to express their confi
dence" in the center, said Kathleen Ritchie,
director of child and family services for the
University. She added that although she has
received calls from people wanting to talk
about the alleged molestation, none of them
have been complaints.
The allegation was made Oct. 31. The Stan
ford Police hope to end the investigation by
Friday, although it may be delayed, Capt.

Raoul Niemeyer said.
Interviews started last week, but the inves
tigating officer had to leave for three days and
will return today to continue with the investi
gation, Niemeyer added.
Ritchie said the parents who called wanted
general information on how the day-care cen
ters at Stanford work and how safe they are.
"We have done important things to make
the center safe and high quality," Ritchie said.
These things include the center's openness
and the well-trained staff, she added.
People are always around, making it diffi
cult for any improprieties to take place,
Ritchie said.
"It is hard to imagine anything would have
gone wrong," said Joanne Ferguson, a
research assistant at the Stanford Center for

the Study of Youth Development. Ferguson
has a child who attends the day-care center.
The Children's Center of the Stanford
Community is one of two day-care centers on
the Stanford campus that are independent of
the University, according to Ritchie.
The center is a cooperative, meaning par
ents and teachers work together to supervise,
encourage and help the children. Parents take
an active role in the structure of the center's
program.
Many parents say the cooperative nature of
the center makes them feel comfortable
despite the allegation. Kingston Chan, an
engineer at Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, said he feels safe having his children at the
center. He can "see what goes on inside" any
time he wants, said Chan.
