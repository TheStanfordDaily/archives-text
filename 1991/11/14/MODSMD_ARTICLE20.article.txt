## Noah Blake When practicing safe sex is just not enough 
### 
Magic Johnson told the world last week
that anyone, no matter how famous or
familiar, can contract the AIDS virus.
But no one needed to tell me — my
father is HIV-positive.
Don't pity people who have the virus
or their families — just learn something
from their pain, and wake up to this huge
problem. Don't bury your head in the
sand as too many have done for too long.
Trust me, you can't afford to.
For too long AIDS has been thought of
as a gay disease, and most heterosexuals
haven't really seriously thought that
they could get it. Johnson admitted last
week that he thought he was untouch
able. It really should be no surprise that
so many people, young and old, have
shared that mind-set for so long.
This may be because our parents
couldn't — or wouldn't — answer all of
our questions about sex. The most acces
sible source of information was televi
sion, which churned out some pretty
unrealistic pictures of sexuality.

Instead of the condom commercials we
needed to see, we got beer commercials
with half-clothed women. I remember
seeing a commercial starring Johnson
cavorting with a few such women. It
seems so ironic now.
Johnson's story is just what we need to
wake up to the dangers that confront us.
Because of his accomplishments on the
court, nearly everyone knows who Magic
is, and most admire him tremendously. He
is a hero to people of all races and all socioe
conomic groups and is the perfect person to
build awareness of a problem that affects
everyday people like my father.
Johnson's announcement was a huge
story for a few days, and AIDS hotlines
helped thousands and thousands of
callers requesting information. But the
media machine will move on when it
finds another big story to cover, and mis
information about what constitutes
responsible sexual behavior will continue
to spew forth in commercials, billboards,
movies and TV shows.

When that happens you may or may
not be able to put all this AIDS stuff in
the back of your mind and not think
about it. I won't be able to.
When I hug my father and the irra
tional fear pops into my mind that I could
get it, I fight the virus.
When my father forgets my birthday
and I don't tell him how hurt I feel
because I worry that upsetting him could
impact how long he lives, I fight the virus.
When I don't pick up the phone and
call my father because I'm afraid to hear
that he's gotten worse, I fight the virus.
I have to keep fighting the urge to turn
my father into a saint, just because he's
HIV-positive. He's still the same egocen
tric, unemotional guy that has never
understood what I'm about and has never
really tried that hard to understand — his
condition doesn't really change that.
But he's the only father I'll ever have,
and he may not be around for much
longer. Consequently I really want to let
him believe that he's been a great father

even when he hasn't.
It's so hard for me to tell my real feel
ings to someone who doesn't seem to
have any. When my father told me last
Christmas that he had contracted the
virus, he spoke in a very matter-of-fact
tone. He didn't even cry.
As I sat in the passenger seat of his car
with my mouth hanging open, he asked if
there were any paintings in the house
that I wanted left to me in his will.
The people who get this virus are not
cardboard cutouts; they're good and bad,
just like everybody else. It's not fair to treat
them with kid gloves — we owe them hon
esty, not flattery, in their last years of life.
But I live in constant fear of contribut
ing to my father's death by telling him once
again how I really feel. Before I left for col
lege and long before I knew of his illness, I
laid out all my feelings of hate. Instead of
the impassioned reply I was yearning for, I
received a five-page, logical argument
about why my feelings were irrational.
Now, I don't know how to approach

my father. My dilemma will only grow if
his health should falter.
But I know that no matter what, I will
be the best father I can be. I will give my
kids whatever they need and try to be
aware of the pressures that they have to
deal with. This is my top priority in life.
My father took three years to tell me
that he was HIV-positive. You may very
well know someone who has the virus
and isn't telling you.
Practicing safe sex is not enough; you
have to tell the people you care about to
be safe as well. Just because you don't get
the AIDS virus doesn't mean that it
won't touch your life.
I know.

When I don't pick up the phone and
call my father because I'm afraid to hear
that he's gotten worse, I fight the virus.
I have to keep fighting the urge to turn
my father into a saint, just because he's
HIV-positive. He's still the same egocen
tric, unemotional guy that has never
understood what I'm about and has never
really tried that hard to understand — his
condition doesn't really change that.
But he's the only father I'll ever have,
and he may not be around for much
longer. Consequently I really want to let
him believe that he's been a great father

even when he hasn't.
It's so hard for me to tell my real feel
ings to someone who doesn't seem to
have any. When my father told me last
Christmas that he had contracted the
virus, he spoke in a very matter-of-fact
tone. He didn't even cry.
As I sat in the passenger seat of his car
with my mouth hanging open, he asked if
there were any paintings in the house
that I wanted left to me in his will.
The people who get this virus are not
cardboard cutouts; they're good and bad,
just like everybody else. It's not fair to treat
them with kid gloves — we owe them hon
esty, not flattery, in their last years of life.
But I live in constant fear of contribut
ing to my father's death by telling him once
again how I really feel. Before I left for col
lege and long before I knew of his illness, I
laid out all my feelings of hate. Instead of
the impassioned reply I was yearning for, I
received a five-page, logical argument
about why my feelings were irrational.
Now, I don't know how to approach

my father. My dilemma will only grow if
his health should falter.
But I know that no matter what, I will
be the best father I can be. I will give my
kids whatever they need and try to be
aware of the pressures that they have to
deal with. This is my top priority in life.
My father took three years to tell me
that he was HIV-positive. You may very
well know someone who has the virus
and isn't telling you.
Practicing safe sex is not enough; you
have to tell the people you care about to
be safe as well. Just because you don't get
the AIDS virus doesn't mean that it
won't touch your life.
I know.
