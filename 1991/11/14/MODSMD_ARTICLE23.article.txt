## Passionate Puerto Rican makes a big splash Surprising Busquets is among water polo's scoring leaders 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
That sophomore Antonio Busquets
has developed into one of the best play
ers on the Stanford water polo team is a
bit surprising, but it is even more sur
prising that he is even at Stanford.
As coach Dante Dettamanti said,
"His coming here was really kind of an
afterthought. He wasn't one of our top
recruits, and I didn't really know what
to expect of him."
In fact, as Busquets himself said, "I
was planning on going to North Caroli
na and being on the swim team there,
and I really didn't decide to come here
until pretty late."
Dettamanti and the rest of the Cardi
nal are now pretty thankful he did make
that decision, as this 19-year-old from
Ponce, Puerto Rico, has become one of
the most important and talented players
for the Cardinal.
"He's just a real super kid. He has
good speed, exceptional quickness, and
most importantly, he just plays with all
out intensity. He plays with passion, and
to me, that's the most exciting thing to
watch in a water polo match," Detta
manti said.
This incredible intensity and passion
for the game are what everyone seems to
notice about Busquets.
"He's got this amazing will to win
and the will to put the ball in the net. If
he wants to put the ball in, he's going to
do it," said sophomore teammate Brian
demons.
Indeed, as Dettamanti jokingly stat
ed, "Antonio's theory is basically that if
you shoot the ball as hard as you can,
you can knock both the goalkeeper and
the ball into the net."
While this attitude is still typical of
his play, Busquets has also learned the
importance of using finesse when it is
needed.
This combination seems to have been
working quite well for him, as he has
quickly become Stanford's second lead
ing scorer this year with 27 goals.

'I just love the way he
plays. If the rest of the
team is smart, they'll
see that he is what we
want in a player.'
— Dante Dettamanti

In fact, in the last four games — all
must-win situations — Busquets has
scored ten times.
When the Cardinal faced USC in
early Nov., Busquets rang up two scores.
Against Pacific Nov. 8 he led all Car
dinal scorers with three goals. Stanford
won the game by a score of 11-9.
In the Cardinal's monumental 8-7
win over third-ranked UCLA Saturday,
Busquets tallied two goals.
At 5-foot-10,175 pounds, Busquets is
one of the Cardinal's smallest players,
but, as he explained, size has really
never been a problem for him.
"It's kind of strange, but in the water
I really don't notice any difference. If we
get out of the pool, I'm a lot smaller than
most of the guys, but in the water, it's
almost all the same."
One difference between Busquets and
his teammates that he has had to deal
with is the fact that he grew up in Puer
to Rico. And while the language differ
ence has not been much of a problem for
him — Spanish is his first language —
adjusting to the different style of water
polo played in America was necessary
for Busquets.
Defense is not stressed as much in
Puerto Rico, and when he arrived at Stan
ford, Busquets was forced to concentrate
especially on this aspect of the game.
"The big deal down there lin Puerto
Rico] is scoring, so he had to learn how
to play defense," Dettamanti said. "It
took him a while, but now he has
learned and has really improved that
aspect of his game."

Busquets has improved so much that
this summer he played and started for
his country's national team in the Pan-
American Games in Cuba, an experience
that really made an impact on Busquets.
"I got to play against all the other
national teams and all their great play
ers, and that was really impressive. I
think I learned a lot from playing with
these older and bigger guys, and it
showed me what I needed to do to play
at that level," he said.
This was hardly Busquets' first inter
national experience, however. Besides
participating in the swimming competi
tion at five Central American Games
where he won numerous gold, silver,
and bronze medals, Busquets also com
peted for Puerto Rico's water polo team
in the Junior World Championships last
summer.
The coach of that team is none other
than former Stanford great Jaime Velez,
an All-American in 1983-1985.
Many comparisons have been made
between Busquets and his Puerto Rican
predecessor. Like Busquets, Velez is a
small guy who came to Stanford a bit
unknown.
"They're really different players,"
Dettamanti said. "Where Jaime was all
finesse, Antonio is more strength and
pure power." Nevertheless, he
added,"The thing they do share is the
love to shoot and score."
One other factor that has helped Bus
quets become the player he is now, is
that he is left-handed.
"Being left-handed really makes a dif
ference in water polo, because it gives
you a much better angle in certain situ
ations," Busquets said. "If I wasn't a
lefty, I probably wouldn't be a starter on
our team."
His coach might disagree with that
self-assessment, however.
"I just love the way he plays. If the
rest of the team is smart, they'll see that
he is what we want in a player," Detta
manti said.
Not too bad for someone who used to
be a mere afterthought.

want in a player.'
— Dante Dettamanti

In fact, in the last four games — all
must-win situations — Busquets has
scored ten times.
When the Cardinal faced USC in
early Nov., Busquets rang up two scores.
Against Pacific Nov. 8 he led all Car
dinal scorers with three goals. Stanford
won the game by a score of 11-9.
In the Cardinal's monumental 8-7
win over third-ranked UCLA Saturday,
Busquets tallied two goals.
At 5-foot-10,175 pounds, Busquets is
one of the Cardinal's smallest players,
but, as he explained, size has really
never been a problem for him.
"It's kind of strange, but in the water
I really don't notice any difference. If we
get out of the pool, I'm a lot smaller than
most of the guys, but in the water, it's
almost all the same."
One difference between Busquets and
his teammates that he has had to deal
with is the fact that he grew up in Puer
to Rico. And while the language differ
ence has not been much of a problem for
him — Spanish is his first language —
adjusting to the different style of water
polo played in America was necessary
for Busquets.
Defense is not stressed as much in
Puerto Rico, and when he arrived at Stan
ford, Busquets was forced to concentrate
especially on this aspect of the game.
"The big deal down there lin Puerto
Rico] is scoring, so he had to learn how
to play defense," Dettamanti said. "It
took him a while, but now he has
learned and has really improved that
aspect of his game."

Busquets has improved so much that
this summer he played and started for
his country's national team in the Pan-
American Games in Cuba, an experience
that really made an impact on Busquets.
"I got to play against all the other
national teams and all their great play
ers, and that was really impressive. I
think I learned a lot from playing with
these older and bigger guys, and it
showed me what I needed to do to play
at that level," he said.
This was hardly Busquets' first inter
national experience, however. Besides
participating in the swimming competi
tion at five Central American Games
where he won numerous gold, silver,
and bronze medals, Busquets also com
peted for Puerto Rico's water polo team
in the Junior World Championships last
summer.
The coach of that team is none other
than former Stanford great Jaime Velez,
an All-American in 1983-1985.
Many comparisons have been made
between Busquets and his Puerto Rican
predecessor. Like Busquets, Velez is a
small guy who came to Stanford a bit
unknown.
"They're really different players,"
Dettamanti said. "Where Jaime was all
finesse, Antonio is more strength and
pure power." Nevertheless, he
added,"The thing they do share is the
love to shoot and score."
One other factor that has helped Bus
quets become the player he is now, is
that he is left-handed.
"Being left-handed really makes a dif
ference in water polo, because it gives
you a much better angle in certain situ
ations," Busquets said. "If I wasn't a
lefty, I probably wouldn't be a starter on
our team."
His coach might disagree with that
self-assessment, however.
"I just love the way he plays. If the
rest of the team is smart, they'll see that
he is what we want in a player," Detta
manti said.
Not too bad for someone who used to
be a mere afterthought.

Hard-throwing Antonio Busquets is second on the water polo team in scoring, with 27
goals. The southpaw has helped lead the No. 4 Cardinal toward a NCAA tournament bid.
That sophomore Antonio Busquets
has developed into one of the best play
ers on the Stanford water polo team is a
bit surprising, but it is even more sur
prising that he is even at Stanford.
As coach Dante Dettamanti said,
"His coming here was really kind of an
afterthought. He wasn't one of our top
recruits, and I didn't really know what
to expect of him."
In fact, as Busquets himself said, "I
was planning on going to North Caroli
na and being on the swim team there,
and I really didn't decide to come here
until pretty late."
Dettamanti and the rest of the Cardi
nal are now pretty thankful he did make
that decision, as this 19-year-old from
Ponce, Puerto Rico, has become one of
the most important and talented players
for the Cardinal.
"He's just a real super kid. He has
good speed, exceptional quickness, and
most importantly, he just plays with all
out intensity. He plays with passion, and
to me, that's the most exciting thing to
watch in a water polo match," Detta
manti said.
This incredible intensity and passion
for the game are what everyone seems to
notice about Busquets.
"He's got this amazing will to win
and the will to put the ball in the net. If
he wants to put the ball in, he's going to
do it," said sophomore teammate Brian
demons.
Indeed, as Dettamanti jokingly stat
ed, "Antonio's theory is basically that if
you shoot the ball as hard as you can,
you can knock both the goalkeeper and
the ball into the net."
While this attitude is still typical of
his play, Busquets has also learned the
importance of using finesse when it is
needed.
This combination seems to have been
working quite well for him, as he has
quickly become Stanford's second lead
ing scorer this year with 27 goals.

plays. If the rest of the
team is smart, they'll
