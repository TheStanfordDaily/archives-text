# Youth directs women's crew

They're big. They're strong. And they're
tougher than ever. This year the Stanford
women's crew will be attracting plenty of
attention with their determination and hard
work. Under the guidance of new varsity
head coach Wendy Davis, the women's novice
team coach last year, the squad looks promis
ing.
The varsity women have already shown
some of their toughness in Sacramento Oct.
26, where both boats finished in the top seven.
They proved themselves again two weeks ago
in Newport Beach where, despite a head-on
accident with another crew in the warm-up,
they managed to finish in second place.
"We're off to a good start," said captain
Bonnie Baker, "and the team seems strong
and enthusiastic." Baker, who won a silver
medal in the Pan-American Games this sum
mer, is currently trying out for a spot on the
U.S. Olympic Team.
Despite the possible loss of Baker, there are
five women who will be returning from over
seas next quarter, and as sophomore Sarah
Morse said, "They will bring the team more
maturity."
Facing its first race this weekend, the
novice crew should have little to fear. The
squad has an exceptional average team height
of 5-foot-8 and extraordinary depth. "I'm so
happy, I can't stand it," said novice coach
Christie May.
The Stanford crew is hosting its last fall
regatta Nov. 16 on a new, three-mile course in
San Mateo.
