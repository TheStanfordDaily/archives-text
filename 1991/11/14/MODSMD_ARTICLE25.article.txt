# Ruggers take Arizona desert by storm
## 
### Trevor Brown 
After finishing last season ranked as one of the
top five teams in the nation, the Stanford rugby
team had high hopes for its preseason play this fall.
All started well with a 48-0 lambasting of the
University of San Francisco two weeks ago. The
Cardinal ruggers dominated play with scores from
both backs and forwards. The team traveled Nov. 7-
8 to Tucson, Ariz., for the 17th annual Michelob-
Continental Rugby Classic, hoping to repeat this
textbook performance. But it was not to be the case.
Competition was sparse with only 12 collegiate
sides. Things looked good for the ruggers since two
of the perennial favorites, Long Beach State and Air
Force, were absent. The door was wide open for a
Cardinal conquest.
Stanford received a forfeit victory over USC in
the first round, as the USC squad spent its morning
stuck in Los Angeles International Airport due to
fog. Although little trouble was expected from the
Trojans, the ruggers were grateful for the rest.
"I went back to the hotel and fell asleep," said a
well-rested John Hamilton. In the second round,
Stanford cruised to victory over the New Mexico
State Red Hot Chili Peppers, who were not so hot as
they fell 52-0.
The Card reached the semifinals, a feat not
achieved in Stanford's three previous appearances
at the Classic. Stanford battled the Aztecs of San
Diego State in a hard-hitting ground war between
two intractable forward packs. The forwards' basic
goal was to gain control of the ball for the backs.
The Stanford forwards did just that and then tried
to move the ball themselves.
However, this was not the best course of action.
San Diego State's forwards are known for their
prowess in the set plays of scrums and line-outs, so
the Cardinal attack plan was geared towards keep
ing play alive with its potent backline. But Stanford

decided to do just the opposite,
playing most of the game in the
forwards.
Stanford held its own, but lost
9-6, its one try coming from sopho
more scrum half Kevin Linker.
The Cardinal left the field
dejected, but found itself in a posi
tion to redeem itself playing for
third place against a strong Col
orado State team the next day. In
a game characterizes by technical
errors, silly mistakes and penal
ties, Stanford did not rise to the
challenge, losing the match 21-13.
The Cardinal placed fourth, its

highest finish at the Classic, but
far below what was expected.
After the Classic, asst. coach
Rich Cortez had this to say, "We
were playing with relatively unexpe
rienced guys who hadn't played
with each other for very long. With
time will come experience, but this
weekend we came out flat."
Many players and observers
blamed the losses on poor officiat
ing. "Though the calls weren't
one-sided, the frequent stoppage
of play was a problem," said Stan
ford's hooker, Owen Williams.
Stanford has one of the most
potent offenses in the country
with speed in its backline and
mobility in its pack. When the
squad moves forward it can attack
effectively from the air or the

ground. This was proven in the
domination of both USF and New
Mexico State.
What has yet to be determined
is if Stanford will show up to play
defense when tested by hard-driv
ing teams like California and
Santa Clara.
Coach Franck Boivert said this
to his players at Monday's prac
tice: "We have the most technical
team in Stanford history, I'm
sure of that. What I'm not sure
about is if this team is going to
come out and play defense."
The Cardinal plays Nov. 16
against the Palo Alto XO's, a
men's club side. KickofT for the
first side is at 2 p.m. on the
lacrosse field. The second side
takes the field at 3:15 p.m.
