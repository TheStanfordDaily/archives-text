# Ruggers take Arizona desert by storm

### Trevor Brown 
After finishing last season ranked as one of the
top five teams in the nation, the Stanford rugby
team had high hopes for its preseason play this fall.
All started well with a 48-0 lambasting of the
University of San Francisco two weeks ago. The
Cardinal ruggers dominated play with scores from
both backs and forwards. The team traveled Nov. 7-
8 to Tucson, Ariz., for the 17th annual Michelob-
Continental Rugby Classic, hoping to repeat this
textbook performance. But it was not to be the case.
Competition was sparse with only 12 collegiate
sides. Things looked good for the ruggers since two
of the perennial favorites, Long Beach State and Air
Force, were absent. The door was wide open for a
Cardinal conquest.
Stanford received a forfeit victory over USC in
the first round, as the USC squad spent its morning
stuck in Los Angeles International Airport due to
fog. Although little trouble was expected from the
Trojans, the ruggers were grateful for the rest.
"I went back to the hotel and fell asleep," said a
well-rested John Hamilton. In the second round,
Stanford cruised to victory over the New Mexico
State Red Hot Chili Peppers, who were not so hot as
they fell 52-0.
The Card reached the semifinals, a feat not
achieved in Stanford's three previous appearances
at the Classic. Stanford battled the Aztecs of San
Diego State in a hard-hitting ground war between
two intractable forward packs. The forwards' basic
goal was to gain control of the ball for the backs.
The Stanford forwards did just that and then tried
to move the ball themselves.
However, this was not the best course of action.
San Diego State's forwards are known for their
prowess in the set plays of scrums and line-outs, so
the Cardinal attack plan was geared towards keep
ing play alive with its potent backline. But Stanford

last year ranked No. 3 in the nation.
