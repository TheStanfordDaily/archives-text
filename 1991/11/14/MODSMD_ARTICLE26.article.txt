# Ghost of Leland Jr. keys Cardinal sports domination
## 
### 
Saturday's phantasmagoric football
victory over UCLA makes me believe in
ghosts. Leland Jr. is back.
There must be some hyperkinetic,
extra-dimensional force protecting Stan
ford athletics. How else does one explain
Stanford's domination in every varsity
sport this fall? Overall, it's been the best
fall sports season in Stanford's history.
Stanford is ranked in the top 25 in
every fall varsity sport and the Cardinal
has a cumulative record of 81-19-5. If you
include sports like tennis and swimming
that continue through the year, you'll see
the fall is no fluke.
Bill Murray-issued ghostbusting gear
in hand, I've been slinking around cam
pus since Saturday's surreal 27-10
embalming of UCLA in the tomb of Stan
ford Stadium, searching for the ghost.
Finally, I caught the friendly ghost of
Leland Stanford Jr. for an interview.
Jane and Leland Stanford's son told
me he emerged from his mausoleum
grave because the university hired his

twisted alter ego, Ted Leland, as the ath
letic director. Leland Jr. can't return to
the grave until Stanford wins a Rose
Bowl. Hell might be a shorter stay, he
told me, but he's trying to keep active
helping Stanford athletics:
•Football (6-3, No. 22). With Leland's
help, the football team is having its best
year since 1986. Of course the ghost
remembers that in 1986 Stanford was 7-
2, had just beaten UCLA 28-23, and had
a Gator Bowl invitation, when 1-8 Cali
fornia clobbered the Cardinal 17-11.

He'll make the trip to Pullman Satur
day just to be safe, and already has his
$89 round-trip tickets booked to El Paso
on Southwest Airlines for the John Han
cock Bowl, Dec. 31.
Saturday against UCLA, Leland
played a key role. Every time Bruin quar
terback Tommy Maddox completed a
long bomb, sneaky Leland would knock
the ball away. In the second half, Leland
was at work when it looked like Maddox
fumbled the ball without being hit.
•Women's soccer (17-1, No. 5). On
Sunday at Maloney Field, Leland saved
the game for the Cardinal in the first
round of the NCAA playoffs. With
ninth-ranked Santa Clara leading 1-0 in
the second half, the Broncos' Kristi
Devert broke through the Stanford
defense. Goalie Leslie Garrard charged
and dove at the ball, but Devert deftly
dribbled around her, ending up 12 yards
in front of the left post with no one near
her.
Devert. Ball. No defenders. Open goal.

Who you gonna call?
Leland. Grabbing hold of Devert's
ponytail, the Cardinal ghost managed
to distract Santa Clara's leading scorer.
As Devert slapped at the pesky Leland
with her left hand, the ball caromed off
her right toe and missed the gaping
maw of the goal by three feet. Stanford
came back to win 2-1 in overtime and
plays at No. 2 Colorado College Satur
day.
•Men's soccer (12-3-5, No. 25). Leland
has guided the men's soccer team to its
first NCAA tournament appearance since
1978. The Cardinal play at Santa Clara
Friday night at 7:30 in a first-round
game.
•Field hockey (10-3, No. 20). The
Northern Pacific Conference champion
Cardinal play at lowa today in a first
round NCAA tournament game. Sopho
more forward Sara Hallock has been
phantasmagoric herself, scoring 15
goals.
•Women's volleyball (23-0, No. 1).

Leland hasn't needed to help the Cardi
nal spikers. Senior Kristin Klein and
junior Bev Oden have been gloom and
doom to all opponents, and Stanford is
destined for its first volleyball NCAA
Championship.
This weekend the Cardinal host UCLA
and USC with a chance to put the nails in
the coffin of the Pacific 10 Conference.
•Waterpolo (13-9, No. 4). Just when it •
appeared the aqua-flingers were drown-1
ing, Leland threw them a life-preserver.'
Thanks to an 8-7 victory over No. 3«
UCLA Saturday, the No. 4 Cardinal will"
haunt the NCAA tournament again.
•Cross country. Leland will spook the •
competition this weekend at the NCAA I
District-8 Championships as the Cardinal
men and women race for the Nov. 25 •
NCAA Championship.

sports astrology, and he foresees three
more football victories and a volleyball
championship.
