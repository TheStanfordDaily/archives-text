# Thomas to stand trial for charges
## Judge denies motion to reduce unlawful sex charge against senior 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
A Palo Alto Municipal Court
judge ordered senior Stuart
Thomas to stand trial for statutory
rape and rejected a defense motion
to reduce the charge from a felony
to a misdemeanor yesterday.

After nearly
two hours of often
tense testimony
at the preliminary
hearing, Judge
Rise Pichon said a
"strong suspicion
or probability to
find said defen
dant guilty" exists
and therefore a
trial is warranted.

In response to defense attor
ney Melvin de la Motte's motion,
Pichon said the felony charge was
justified because of the alleged
use of alcohol "to accomplish the
ends," the alleged continuation of
sexual activity after the woman's
repeated protests and the age dif
ference between the woman and
Thomas, who is 23.
Thomas, who has also been
charged with providing alcohol to
a minor in connection with an
alleged Sept. 22 sexual assault in
Stern Hall, will be arraigned Nov.
25 at Superior Court in San Jose,
where sex crimes are usually
prosecuted.
The woman's testimony
marked her first public appear
ance in connection with the inci
dent. A defense witness, Stanford
Police Detective Tim Frecceri,
apparently failed to receive his
subpoena.
De la Motte argued that
because Thomas has "never been
in trouble" and because the
woman has since turned 18, the
court should reduce the charge to
a misdemeanor.
He also said Thomas did not
know the woman's age.
During the proceedings the

woman testified she told Thomas
once that she was under 21 and
once that she was "17 and 5-foot-1."
A misdemeanor charge would
carry a maximum penalty of six
months in jail. The felony charge
carries a maximum sentence of 18
months. De la Motte can make
the motion again at any time.
Attorneys clash
The hearing's most confrontation
al moments came when de la Motte
cross-examined the woman about her
behavior during the incident. His
questions prompted repeated objec
tions from Linda Condron, a Santa
Clara County deputy district attor
ney.
During one line of questioning,
the district attorney repeatedly
objected that de la Motte was
attempting to establish the woman's
consent. The charge of unlawful sex
ual intercourse with a female minor
does not reflect whether or not sex
was consensual.
The judge sustained many of
Condron's objections. Three
among many questions asked by
de la Motte that the judge disal
lowed were whether the woman
had said anything to Thomas
"that was sexually suggestive;"
whether she had raised her arms
to help Thomas take her sweater
off; and whether, while Thomas
was kissing her breasts, she was
"softly scratching his back with
Iherl fingernails."
In response to Condron's
objections, de la Motte said he
was merely trying to "probe her
memory" and establish whether
her recollections were reliable.
The judge ruled that in the
course of testing the woman's
memory, de la Motte could not
ask various questions because
"consent is not an issue."
But the judge did allow de la
Motte to ask the woman, "Mr.
Thomas never threatened you or


Thomas
used force with you?" The woman
replied, "That is correct."
In one instance, de la Motte had
to rephrase at least seven times a
question about whether the size of
Thomas' penis prevented penetra
tion from occurring before the
question was allowed by the court.
During the exchange, Pichon told
both attorneys to "relax" and
maintain their professionalism.
The woman answered that pen
etration did occur. She said she
could tell by the pain, and that
there was no doubt in her mind.
De la Motte cross-examined
the woman about other aspects of
her behavior.
"Isn't it true that you took a
bandana out of your hair and tied
a blindfold around Mr. Thomas'
eyes?" de la Motte asked.
"That is incorrect," the woman
said. She said that she was wear
ing a scarf in her hair, that she did
not recall taking it off and that
she was wearing it when she left.
"Did you ever say that hard
alcohol makes you do silly or
crazy things?" de la Motte asked.
"Not to my recollection," the
woman replied.
The woman said that Thomas

attempted intercourse twice but
stopped after "I kept protesting."
He then asked her to "kiss his
penis," she added.
"Did he touch you when he told
you to do that?" Condron asked.
"He put my hand on his penis,"
the woman replied.
"What at that point did you
feel?" Condron said.
"Obligated," the woman re
sponded.
When Thomas ejaculated in
her mouth, the woman said, she
put on his bathrobe to go to the
bathroom.
She said, "I wanted to hurry
and ... rinse out my mouth."
Wearing his robe "seemed easier"
than putting on all her clothes,
she said when Condron asked why
she did not wear her own clothes.
The woman said no further
sexual activity occurred after she
returned from the bathroom, and
that she left Thomas' room soon
after.
She also said she first met
Thomas during Orientation in
front of Stern Hall and later
entered his room when she heard
music she liked, the Doors, play
ing on his stereo.
Thomas offered her beer sever
al times, she said. The third time
— when she was alone with him
— she accepted and drank half of
a beer.

After some conversation,
Thomas suggested they play a
game of cards — strip blackjack,
she said. When she refused, he
suggested an alternative game of
"drinking blackjack," where the
loser has to drink. They played
with peppermint schnapps, drink
ing from the bottle, according to
the woman.
The woman said she had eight
or nine drinks, then felt "very"
intoxicated, was sick to her stom
ach and had a headache.
De la Motte attempted to estab
lish that the amount of alcohol she
consumed was minimal, asking
how much Thomas had drunk.
"Two or three drinks," the
woman said. "I know it was con
siderably less than me because I
was losing the drinking game."
After the proceeding, de la
Motte said, "It would have been
helpful to have [Frecceri] introduce
the amount of alcohol involved,
which was not very much."
Frecceri is attending a class
out of the county that was
planned "six months ago," said
Supervising District Attorney
Margo Smith.
De la Motte told the judge he
was dissatisfied that his request
to subpoena Frecceri was not ful
filled. De la Motte did not ask for
a delay of the hearing.
Throughout her testimony, the

woman appeared composed and
spoke in even, firm tones. She had
a box of Kleenex with her at the
stand but did not use it.
She looked at Thomas during
some of her testimony. Thomas
sat quietly in a forest green suit.
During a 15-minute court
recess, the woman left the stand
and stood holding hands with two
friends. Other supporters includ
ed Casa Zapata Resident Fellow
Tony Burciaga and Gail Prichard,
director of the Cowell Sexual
Assault Response and Recovery
Team.
Prichard said the defense
strategy seemed to be to confuse
the woman. "On an emotional
level, it's maddening because it
seems his goal is to sidetrack
her," she said.
"She is not out of touch with
her feelings, and she is strong in
her ability to tell the truth,"
Prichard continued. "It is empow
ering to have your feelings back in
the process of healing, because
they tell you the truth."
De la Motte said, "At this
stage, they're interested in a very
limited issue. When it reaches
trial, most judges will allow you at
least to discuss the incident in
detail."
He said a defendant does not
normally take the stand at a pre
liminary examination.
