# Thomas to stand trial for charges
## Judge denies motion to reduce unlawful sex charge against senior 
### Minal Hajratwala Senior staff writer 
A Palo Alto Municipal Court
judge ordered senior Stuart
Thomas to stand trial for statutory
rape and rejected a defense motion
to reduce the charge from a felony
to a misdemeanor yesterday.

After nearly
two hours of often
tense testimony
at the preliminary
hearing, Judge
Rise Pichon said a
"strong suspicion
or probability to
find said defen
dant guilty" exists
and therefore a
trial is warranted.

In response to defense attor
ney Melvin de la Motte's motion,
Pichon said the felony charge was
justified because of the alleged
use of alcohol "to accomplish the
ends," the alleged continuation of
sexual activity after the woman's
repeated protests and the age dif
ference between the woman and
Thomas, who is 23.
Thomas, who has also been
charged with providing alcohol to
a minor in connection with an
alleged Sept. 22 sexual assault in
Stern Hall, will be arraigned Nov.
25 at Superior Court in San Jose,
where sex crimes are usually
prosecuted.
The woman's testimony
marked her first public appear
ance in connection with the inci
dent. A defense witness, Stanford
Police Detective Tim Frecceri,
apparently failed to receive his
subpoena.
De la Motte argued that
because Thomas has "never been
in trouble" and because the
woman has since turned 18, the
court should reduce the charge to
a misdemeanor.
He also said Thomas did not
know the woman's age.
During the proceedings the

woman testified she told Thomas
once that she was under 21 and
once that she was "17 and 5-foot-1."
A misdemeanor charge would
carry a maximum penalty of six
months in jail. The felony charge
carries a maximum sentence of 18
months. De la Motte can make
the motion again at any time.
Attorneys clash
The hearing's most confrontation
al moments came when de la Motte
cross-examined the woman about her
behavior during the incident. His
questions prompted repeated objec
tions from Linda Condron, a Santa
Clara County deputy district attor
ney.
During one line of questioning,
the district attorney repeatedly
objected that de la Motte was
attempting to establish the woman's
consent. The charge of unlawful sex
ual intercourse with a female minor
does not reflect whether or not sex
was consensual.
The judge sustained many of
Condron's objections. Three
among many questions asked by
de la Motte that the judge disal
lowed were whether the woman
had said anything to Thomas
"that was sexually suggestive;"
whether she had raised her arms
to help Thomas take her sweater
off; and whether, while Thomas
was kissing her breasts, she was
"softly scratching his back with
Iherl fingernails."
In response to Condron's
objections, de la Motte said he
was merely trying to "probe her
memory" and establish whether
her recollections were reliable.
The judge ruled that in the
course of testing the woman's
memory, de la Motte could not
ask various questions because
"consent is not an issue."
But the judge did allow de la
Motte to ask the woman, "Mr.
Thomas never threatened you or
