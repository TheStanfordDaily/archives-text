# 25 points of light
## Alum promises wacky reform 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
"Are people ready for a
fundamentally new approach
to politics?" asks Mark Bis
now, a candidate in the 1992
U.S. Senate race.
If so, Bisnow is ready for
them — with a 25-point plat
form that at times reads more
like a humor column than a
political agenda.
"I'll reject all endorse
ments. No one should care
what Willie Brown, Ronald
Reagan or Rob Lowe thinks of
me," reads one plank of the
Washington lawyer's un
orthodox platform.
Bisnow, who graduated
from Stanford in 1973,
believes he has come up
with a formula to restore
Americans' sagging faith in
Congress. He says people
currently look at Congress
men and say, "Screw you,
you're not doing anything
useful!"
Bisnow is clearly the dark
horse in a race of political
studs — and he is proud of it.
He soys his odds of win
ning the iace aqainst incum
bent John Seymour and for
mer San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein are one in
100,000.
But who needs popularity?
