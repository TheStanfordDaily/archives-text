## Alum promises wacky reform 
### Amy Gillett Staff writer 
"Are people ready for a
fundamentally new approach
to politics?" asks Mark Bis
now, a candidate in the 1992
U.S. Senate race.
If so, Bisnow is ready for
them — with a 25-point plat
form that at times reads more
like a humor column than a
political agenda.
"I'll reject all endorse
ments. No one should care
what Willie Brown, Ronald
Reagan or Rob Lowe thinks of
me," reads one plank of the
Washington lawyer's un
orthodox platform.
Bisnow, who graduated
from Stanford in 1973,
believes he has come up
with a formula to restore
Americans' sagging faith in
Congress. He says people
currently look at Congress
men and say, "Screw you,
you're not doing anything
useful!"
Bisnow is clearly the dark
horse in a race of political
studs — and he is proud of it.
He soys his odds of win
ning the iace aqainst incum
bent John Seymour and for
mer San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein are one in
100,000.
But who needs popularity?


Mimi Kuo— Daily
In his attempt to restore the sagging faith in Congress', Mark Bis
now uses humor and reality in his campaign for the 1992 U.S. Sen
ate.
Winning the election is not
even high on the Washington
lawyer's list of priorities. In his
platform, the affable candidate
pledges to pull out of the election
if a more credible candidate of
either party adopts his platform.
The staple ingredient in his
experimental, home-brew politi
cal concoction is rejection of
everything he holds responsible
for spoiling the political process.
Two-thirds of the planks in his
platform begin with "I won't."
Bisnow won't use pollsters, won't
have political advisers, "won't
accept speaking fees, free meals,
golfing trips or anything else of
value from any private interest."
In keeping with his campaign
promise — "I won't speak ill of
others, unless they say something
that would provoke even my
mother" — he calls his rival
politicians intelligent, passionate
and honest.
"What more could you want?"
he asks, then snaps, "You could
want a lot more — and they don't
have it!" He claims they are run
ning their campaigns in the same
old way — accepting donations,
then pretending the money does
not influence them.
Bisnow believes campaign con
tributions "should be sandpa
pered off the earth" because they
make politicians beholden to cer
tain constituent groups at the
expense of national interests,
which the candidate promises to
focus on if elected.
He vows he will not be bought
by constituent groups, and to
prove it, he will accept no cam
paign contributions over $50. "To
hell with you people who sell
yourselves like Procter & Gamble
sells soap!" proclaims Bisnow,
pointing downward as if to con
sign his political rivals to Dante's
lowest depths.
Bisnow has received about
$200 in donations so far from peo
ple who have read about him in
newspapers or heard him on
National Public Radio. This
places him several million dollars
behind many of his rivals. But
since Bisnow condemns TV
advertising as "expensive, sim
plistic and deceptive," he won't be

running up large campaign bills.
Bisnow prefers to spread his
message through newspaper
interviews, and the enthusiastic
candidate visited Stanford last
week as part of a three-day cam
paign tour of California.
Although a six-year senatorial
seat will also be vacant in 1992
with the retirement of Sen. Alan
Cranston, Bisnow prefers the
"short" seat, a 2-year stint made
possible by Gov. Pete Wilson's
abdication of his Senate seat last
year. Wilson appointed Seymour
to fill the vacancy until the 1992
election.
Bisnow is convinced the short
stint will ensure he maintains his
political integrity. "Power cor
rupts — even fine people like me,"
he explains in his platform. He
promises he will only serve the
two-year term and vows the Sen
ate position would represent the
end of his political career. "I am
totally and completely unquali
fied for any higher office," he
states, with a frankness that
makes him credible despite his
humor.
But his cohorts on Capitol Hill
are uncertain whether they
take him seriously. "A lot
of people in Congress think it's
preposterous — which I wear as a
badge of honor," says Bisnow.
Aside from the task of raising a
daunting 13,000 signatures dur
ing three months next summer —
required of all non-partisan can
didates trying to get on the ballot
— Bisnow will have the added
burden of convincing people that
some sense lies behind such bold
proclamations as, "I'm in favor of
a $l-a-gallon gasoline tax, using
the proceeds to cut the Social
Security payroll tax."
Despite some cynical respons
es, Bisnow remains convinced
that his message is one that needs
to be voiced. "If I raise a blip it
would be really neat," he con
cludes, in a voice gone hoarse
after a day of enthusiastically
putting forth his political ideas.

Despite some cynical respons
es, Bisnow remains convinced
that his message is one that needs
to be voiced. "If I raise a blip it
would be really neat," he con
cludes, in a voice gone hoarse
after a day of enthusiastically
putting forth his political ideas.
"Are people ready for a
fundamentally new approach
to politics?" asks Mark Bis
now, a candidate in the 1992
U.S. Senate race.
If so, Bisnow is ready for
them — with a 25-point plat
form that at times reads more
like a humor column than a
political agenda.
"I'll reject all endorse
ments. No one should care
what Willie Brown, Ronald
Reagan or Rob Lowe thinks of
me," reads one plank of the
Washington lawyer's un
orthodox platform.
Bisnow, who graduated
from Stanford in 1973,
believes he has come up
with a formula to restore
Americans' sagging faith in
Congress. He says people
currently look at Congress
men and say, "Screw you,
you're not doing anything
useful!"
Bisnow is clearly the dark
horse in a race of political
studs — and he is proud of it.
He soys his odds of win
ning the iace aqainst incum
bent John Seymour and for
mer San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein are one in
100,000.
But who needs popularity?


Mimi Kuo— Daily
In his attempt to restore the sagging faith in Congress', Mark Bis
now uses humor and reality in his campaign for the 1992 U.S. Sen
ate.
Winning the election is not
even high on the Washington
lawyer's list of priorities. In his
platform, the affable candidate
pledges to pull out of the election
if a more credible candidate of
either party adopts his platform.
The staple ingredient in his
experimental, home-brew politi
cal concoction is rejection of
everything he holds responsible
for spoiling the political process.
Two-thirds of the planks in his
platform begin with "I won't."
Bisnow won't use pollsters, won't
have political advisers, "won't
accept speaking fees, free meals,
golfing trips or anything else of
value from any private interest."
In keeping with his campaign
promise — "I won't speak ill of
others, unless they say something
that would provoke even my
mother" — he calls his rival
politicians intelligent, passionate
and honest.
"What more could you want?"
he asks, then snaps, "You could
want a lot more — and they don't
have it!" He claims they are run
ning their campaigns in the same
old way — accepting donations,
then pretending the money does
not influence them.
Bisnow believes campaign con
tributions "should be sandpa
pered off the earth" because they
make politicians beholden to cer
tain constituent groups at the
expense of national interests,
which the candidate promises to
focus on if elected.
He vows he will not be bought
by constituent groups, and to
prove it, he will accept no cam
paign contributions over $50. "To
hell with you people who sell
yourselves like Procter & Gamble
sells soap!" proclaims Bisnow,
pointing downward as if to con
sign his political rivals to Dante's
lowest depths.
Bisnow has received about
$200 in donations so far from peo
ple who have read about him in
newspapers or heard him on
National Public Radio. This
places him several million dollars
behind many of his rivals. But
since Bisnow condemns TV
advertising as "expensive, sim
plistic and deceptive," he won't be

running up large campaign bills.
Bisnow prefers to spread his
message through newspaper
interviews, and the enthusiastic
candidate visited Stanford last
week as part of a three-day cam
paign tour of California.
Although a six-year senatorial
seat will also be vacant in 1992
with the retirement of Sen. Alan
Cranston, Bisnow prefers the
"short" seat, a 2-year stint made
possible by Gov. Pete Wilson's
abdication of his Senate seat last
year. Wilson appointed Seymour
to fill the vacancy until the 1992
election.
Bisnow is convinced the short
stint will ensure he maintains his
political integrity. "Power cor
rupts — even fine people like me,"
he explains in his platform. He
promises he will only serve the
two-year term and vows the Sen
ate position would represent the
end of his political career. "I am
totally and completely unquali
fied for any higher office," he
states, with a frankness that
makes him credible despite his
humor.
But his cohorts on Capitol Hill
are uncertain whether they
take him seriously. "A lot
of people in Congress think it's
preposterous — which I wear as a
badge of honor," says Bisnow.
Aside from the task of raising a
daunting 13,000 signatures dur
ing three months next summer —
required of all non-partisan can
didates trying to get on the ballot
— Bisnow will have the added
burden of convincing people that
some sense lies behind such bold
proclamations as, "I'm in favor of
a $l-a-gallon gasoline tax, using
the proceeds to cut the Social
Security payroll tax."
Despite some cynical respons
es, Bisnow remains convinced
that his message is one that needs
to be voiced. "If I raise a blip it
would be really neat," he con
cludes, in a voice gone hoarse
after a day of enthusiastically
putting forth his political ideas.
