# Asbestos removal continues
## Some students leave residences, clothing for safety 
### Peter Marks 
A flaking ceiling greeted three graduate students
who moved into apartment 139 D in Escondido Vil
lage this fall, but the students had no idea their
room contained four times Stanford's maximum
level of asbestos.
After tests confirmed the problem on Oct. 25,
Peter St. Amour, James Aldrich-Moodie and Peter
Tsai agreed to move temporarily to a new apartment
as part of Stanford's continuing asbestos-removal
program.
Although asbestos is found in many campus
buildings, it has been an ongoing concern in Escon

dido — where it is found in the floor and in the stuc
coed, popcorn-like ceilings — after some apartments
were recently evacuated.
According to Marty Keller, manager of major pro
jects for Housing and Food Service, approximately
1,000 asbestos-related incidents were reported in
Escondido during the past two years.
Approximately 25-40 of the cases required some
form of clean-up, according to Keller. But he said
only about 1 percent of the cases involved asbestos
levels that exceeded Stanford's limit.
Asbestos is an invisible airborne fiber that can
build up in the lining of the lungs
and predispose a person to certain
types of cancer, according to
David Clarke, a clinical fellow at
the Stanford Hospital.
Around five years age, Stanford
launched a project to survey the pres
ence of asbestos in campus buildings,
take air samples and remove or con
tain the fiber when necessary.
The University's asbestos limit
is .01 fibers per cubic centimeter
of air — a standard followed by
many public elementary schools,
but far stricter than the federal
standard of .1 fibers set to protect
employees in the work area.
Apartment 139 D had an
asbestos level of .04 fibers per
cubic centimeter. The asbestos is
now being removed and contained.
One neighbor, Louis Dienes, was
angered that the University did not
notify residents living near the
apartment of the removal process.
But Keller said workers were
using a filter to prevent the
release of fibers into the air. "If
there was going to be a direct
impact (on the neighbors), we'd
notify them," he said.
The University has also
attempted to warn Escondido res
idents of the general problem
with asbestos, according to Keller.
Guidelines distributed in Septem
ber advised students to report any
ceiling punctures immediately.
Debate about Stanford's
asbestos-removal program was

renewed two months ago after a
ceiling segment, measuring
approximately 18 inches in diam
eter, fell into the crib of a baby
whose family lives in Escondido.
The Rawlins family was tem
porarily relocated the day after
the incident, which occurred
about midnight. The family's
humidifier had dampened the
ceiling of the child's room.
Although David Rawlins, a
graduate student in chemistry,
said the University promptly
removed the asbestos material and
repaired the ceiling, he expressed
disappointment in Stanford's han
dling of asbestos removal.
"There were two other times in
the past that portions of the ceil
ing had fallen," he said. "It
seemed that our unit was vacant
during the summer, and we feel it
should have been patched up."
After the incident, ASSU senator
Elizabeth Wahl, herself a resident of
Escondido and a mother, proposed a
bill recommending that priority in
housing relocation be given to fami
lies with children, which passed
with slight modifications.
"They're responding to asbestos
on a crisis level," Wahl said. "If the
ceiling collapses, they'll move in
and take care of it, but otherwise"
nothing happens.
But Keller contended that the
University is moving out of that
phase. "We've already begun to
move in as units become vacant or
if families go on vacation," he said.
Keller said Housing and Food
Service has requested funds from
the Board of Trustees to continue
to abate asbestos on their own ini

tiative rather than after people
request it.
The average cost of asbestos
removal is $10 per square foot.
"With about 700 square feet in an
Escondido Village unit, you're
talking about $7,000," said
Keller. "We've got about a million
square feet in [Escondido],
though not all" contain asbestos.
Recent budget cuts, Keller
said, should not affect the
asbestos removal program.
"There are some things that
need to be prioritized, and this
needs action," he said. "The
response to the proposal looks
very good."
In the meantime, however, the
relocated students have been
forced to cope with the loss of
clothes, bedding and other items.
These articles are considered
"soft," meaning the asbestos
fibers can embed themselves in
the fabrics. Once contaminated, it
is unclear whether they can be
adequately cleaned.
The University provided the
three graduate students with
money to replace their lost items
and buy food. In addition, the stu
dents' class materials and books,
as well as items like pots and
pans, have been cleaned.
"It's a big hassle, but the peo
ple (at Housing and Food Service)
have been really accommodat
ing," said St. Amour, one of the
three relocated students. "One
guy even lent us his stereo."
The Rawlins still await reim
bursement for the loss of personal
items totaling several thousand
dollars.
