# Concern about AIDS increases
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
One week after Magic John
son's announcement that he is
carrying the AIDS virus, Stan
ford's student health services are
feeling the effects of a nationwide
surge in AIDS awareness.
"We have had a lot of people
calling for HIV testing this week,"
said Dawn Gray, a medical service
assistant at Cowell Student Health
Center. "A lot of people want to
take the test as quickly as they
can. A lot of men are calling."
Gray estimated that half of the
calls to Cowell during the past
week have been about HIV test
ing, which the health center
offers free to Stanford students.
"Usually it's one out of 10 or
one out of 15," she said.
Business has increased at the
Contraceptive Information Center,
which offers students free condoms
and contraceptive counseling.
"On Wednesday we had eight

visitors," said senior Melissa Mar
shall, co-director of the student-run
organization. "On Thursday we had
20.1 wouldn't say-that's an all-time
high, but it's definitely on the upper
end of our scale."
The number of visitors reached
23 on Friday, but dropped to 12
Monday and 13 Tuesday. In addi
tion to seeking condoms, many
students have visited the center
for information on HIV testing
and AIDS prevention.
"People haven't really been
traumatized by this, but they're
getting their condoms and they're
asking questions," Marshall said.
"Because we're a contraceptive
center, it's not typical for us to get
a lot of questions about HIV test
ing, but we did last week."
Other students have sought
AIDS-prevention advice at Ye
Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
"People have been asking us a
lot more questions â€” anything
from what makes a good condom
to how to have fun with them,"

said Pat Dote, director of public
relations for the shop.
"We're even getting calls from
people off campus," he added.
Both the information center
and the Safer Sex Shoppe refer
students to Cowell's Counseling
and Psychological Services for
pre- and post-HIV test counsel
ing. CAPS Director Alejandro
Martinez said his department
hasn't had more AIDS-related
counseling requests.
"We're very busy right now,
but I'm not sure that it's specifi
cally related to HIV anxiety," he
said. "My guess is that people
would not be seeking counseling
yet, but information."
Cowell Director Harvey Wein
stein said, "There's a fair amount
of knowledge on campus, but even
though students have that knowl
edge, they don't necessarily put it
into practice."
"That discrepancy between
knowledge and action can be life
threatening," he said.
