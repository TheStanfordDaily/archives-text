The movement for freedom
and human rights is "a human
earthquake," said Jack Healey,
director of Amnesty International
U.S.A. at Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
"People are waking up to the
fact that they don't have to ask
for their rights; they can demand
their rights," he added.
He invited the small crowd of
about 50 to join the battle against
torture and human rights viola
tions. He asserted that these
could be removed by the end of
the century, "the way slavery was
removed."
"Can there be something more
important to do than that?" he
asked.
Healey also said Americans had
to demand that attention be given
to human rights in foreign policy
in the same way that it is expected
at home. He said the basis of the
U.S. Constitution is "protecting
everyone the same.... If it's so
good for us, why can't we say it
should apply to other people?"
"We are no longer free to be iso
lationists" because the world is now
"truly interdependent," he added.
Healey said that the top three
countries receiving U.S. foreign aid
— Israel, Egypt and Turkey — are
human rights violators, referring
to the treatment of the Palestini
ans in Israel, the Kurds in Turkey
and the Muslim Brothers in Egypt.
Amnesty International U.S.A. is
an organization of almost 400,000
volunteer members and "part of a
worldwide movement of people
that acts on the conviction that
governments must not deny indi
viduals their basic human rights,"
said Ralph Ermonian, director of
the ASSU Speakers' Bureau, in his
introduction of Healey.
Healey directed his speech to

young people, saying, "This is
your world."
"Half the world today is under
25 years old," he said. According to
Hilary Naylor, a member of the
board of directors of Amnesty
International U.S.A. who was in
the audience, student participation
"is by far the largest component of
Amnesty International U.S.A."
Naylor said Amnesty Interna
tional was started May 28, 1961 in
London, England, when a British

lawyer heard that two Portuguese
students had been arrested for
standing up in a cafe and toasting
freedom. He then wrote an article
in the London Observer asking
people to join him in writing let
ters trying to counter such human
rights violations.
Healey said it is hard to imag
ine that the organization has
achieved as much as it has.
But, he said, "we have a lot to
do."
