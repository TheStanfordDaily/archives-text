# Gay activist helps foil coup
## Alum gives time, service and computers to Soviets 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
This is the second of two arti
cles chronicling gay-rights
activist Tom Boellstorffs work in
the Soviet Union.

During the Soviet coup this
summer, 1991 graduate Tom
Boellstorff found himself in con
trol of one of the few free printing
presses in Moscow — two Macin
tosh computers and a laser print
er.
Boellstorff, who spoke last
night at Annenberg Auditorium,
went to the Soviet Union as a rep
resentative of the International
Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
Commission, and stayed for three
months to work with gay
activists.
In his time there, he ended up
creating fliers for Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin, helping orga
nize and train fledgling gay-rights
groups and educating Soviets
about AIDS.
He worked with Roman Kalin
in, the most prominent gay-rights
activist in the Soviet Union, and
other activists. Together, they set
up computer equipment that
Boellstorff donated to Soviet gay
and lesbian groups, using his new
apartment as an office.
His goal, Boellstorff said, was
to teach as many people as possi
ble to use the computers. Limited
technology and tight government
control made publishing a strug
gle for many small presses, like
Kalinin's gay newsletter, Tema,
he said.
The computers "allowed them
much better typesetting and
removed government control,"
Boellstorff added.
But even assembling people for
lessons proved to be a difficult
task, he said. Distrust was
widespread among all but the
closest friends and was augment
ed by fear that the computers
would be stolen.
"It's very different from here,"
he said. "You can't just get people

together; they don't trust each
other enough."
Waiting out the coup
In his first two weeks alone,
Boellstorff learned to find food,
negotiate his way around town
and make contacts in the commu
nity.
Then on Aug. 19, after he had
"just settled in,"the coup leaders
struck, imprisoning Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev in
Crimea.
In Moscow, police shut down
all non-government media. Coup
leaders announced that "illegal,
immoral elements" of society
would be considered "enemies,"
Boellstorff said, "which we took
to mean us."
At the Moscow AIDS ward,
Boellstorff said, "some bureau
crat" forced administrators to
compile a list of names of the
patients, gathering about 600
names.
"We were completely freaking
out," Boellstorff said. "We wor
ried that if there was a crack
down, we would become scape
goats. And Roman would be the
first to go, because he was the
most visible."
They decided that Kalinin
would stay by Boellstorffs side
"24 hours a day"in the hope that
BoellstorfFs status as an interna
tional observer would protect
Kalinin.
Freedom of the press
The next day, Boellstorff real
ized he and his friends had a huge
advantage in their laser printer:
They controlled one of only a few
working presses in Moscow.
"We took examples of Yeltsin's
fliers, typed them up and pro
duced them on paper we got from
a pro-democracy group," Boell
storff said. "Then we took them to
the Russian parliament where
'resistance central' was, and they
distributed them."
Over the course of the coup,
Boellstorff and his friends printed
four different fliers, putting the

name of Kalinin's gay newsletter
on them so people would know
where they originated.
In the weeks after the coup,
BoellstorfT said he saw his fliers
all over Moscow. "It was cool that
we could actually do something,"
he said.
After the coup collapsed, "Peo
ple were driving up and down the
street, honking their horns," he
said. "But Moscow had changed
little. People's faces were con
cerned, but shops were still open
and buses still ran."
Still, Boellstorff said Mus
covites were largely unaffected by
the coup. "One percent of the peo
ple were for the coup, one percent
against, and it was life as usual
for the other 98 percent," he said.
Spreading the word
For the next two months,
Boellstorff worked with AIDS
groups, helping them write letters
in English to get contacts and
funding as well as distributing
information on AIDS.
Toward the end of his stay, he
travelled to Latvia and Estonia.
He helped organize the first Lat
vian press conference on AIDS
and homosexuality, while in Esto
nia, he catalyzed the formation of
the first gay and lesbian organiza
tion, promising them a typewriter
if they were able to unify.
"It was a great feeling," he
said. "So much of my work was
intangible struggling. It was real
ly satisfying because they were
smaller countries and easier to
work in."
Boellstorff arrived back at
Stanford Oct. 19. He is following
up on his work in the Soviet
Union, trying to obtain a type
writer for the group in Estonia
and talking to people here to raise
awareness of Soviet gay issues.
He is also planning a trip to
Indonesia and Malaysia this
February with "the same ideas
and goals," he said.
"But I don't plan on doing this
for life," he added, laughing. "I
will go to grad school after this."

street, honking their horns," he
said. "But Moscow had changed
little. People's faces were con
cerned, but shops were still open
and buses still ran."
Still, Boellstorff said Mus
covites were largely unaffected by
the coup. "One percent of the peo
ple were for the coup, one percent
against, and it was life as usual
for the other 98 percent," he said.
Spreading the word
For the next two months,
Boellstorff worked with AIDS
groups, helping them write letters
in English to get contacts and
funding as well as distributing
information on AIDS.
Toward the end of his stay, he
travelled to Latvia and Estonia.
He helped organize the first Lat
vian press conference on AIDS
and homosexuality, while in Esto
nia, he catalyzed the formation of
the first gay and lesbian organiza
tion, promising them a typewriter
if they were able to unify.
"It was a great feeling," he
said. "So much of my work was
intangible struggling. It was real
ly satisfying because they were
smaller countries and easier to
work in."
Boellstorff arrived back at
Stanford Oct. 19. He is following
up on his work in the Soviet
Union, trying to obtain a type
writer for the group in Estonia
and talking to people here to raise
awareness of Soviet gay issues.
He is also planning a trip to
Indonesia and Malaysia this
February with "the same ideas
and goals," he said.
"But I don't plan on doing this
for life," he added, laughing. "I
will go to grad school after this."
This is the second of two arti
cles chronicling gay-rights
activist Tom Boellstorffs work in
the Soviet Union.

During the Soviet coup this
summer, 1991 graduate Tom
Boellstorff found himself in con
trol of one of the few free printing
presses in Moscow — two Macin
tosh computers and a laser print
er.
Boellstorff, who spoke last
night at Annenberg Auditorium,
went to the Soviet Union as a rep
resentative of the International
Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
Commission, and stayed for three
months to work with gay
activists.
In his time there, he ended up
creating fliers for Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin, helping orga
nize and train fledgling gay-rights
groups and educating Soviets
about AIDS.
He worked with Roman Kalin
in, the most prominent gay-rights
activist in the Soviet Union, and
other activists. Together, they set
up computer equipment that
Boellstorff donated to Soviet gay
and lesbian groups, using his new
apartment as an office.
His goal, Boellstorff said, was
to teach as many people as possi
ble to use the computers. Limited
technology and tight government
control made publishing a strug
gle for many small presses, like
Kalinin's gay newsletter, Tema,
he said.
The computers "allowed them
much better typesetting and
removed government control,"
Boellstorff added.
But even assembling people for
lessons proved to be a difficult
task, he said. Distrust was
widespread among all but the
closest friends and was augment
ed by fear that the computers
would be stolen.
"It's very different from here,"
he said. "You can't just get people

together; they don't trust each
other enough."
Waiting out the coup
In his first two weeks alone,
Boellstorff learned to find food,
negotiate his way around town
and make contacts in the commu
nity.
Then on Aug. 19, after he had
"just settled in,"the coup leaders
struck, imprisoning Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev in
Crimea.
In Moscow, police shut down
all non-government media. Coup
leaders announced that "illegal,
immoral elements" of society
would be considered "enemies,"
Boellstorff said, "which we took
to mean us."
At the Moscow AIDS ward,
Boellstorff said, "some bureau
crat" forced administrators to
compile a list of names of the
patients, gathering about 600
names.
"We were completely freaking
out," Boellstorff said. "We wor
ried that if there was a crack
down, we would become scape
goats. And Roman would be the
first to go, because he was the
most visible."
They decided that Kalinin
would stay by Boellstorffs side
"24 hours a day"in the hope that
BoellstorfFs status as an interna
tional observer would protect
Kalinin.
Freedom of the press
The next day, Boellstorff real
ized he and his friends had a huge
advantage in their laser printer:
They controlled one of only a few
working presses in Moscow.
"We took examples of Yeltsin's
fliers, typed them up and pro
duced them on paper we got from
a pro-democracy group," Boell
storff said. "Then we took them to
the Russian parliament where
'resistance central' was, and they
distributed them."
Over the course of the coup,
Boellstorff and his friends printed
four different fliers, putting the

name of Kalinin's gay newsletter
on them so people would know
where they originated.
In the weeks after the coup,
BoellstorfT said he saw his fliers
all over Moscow. "It was cool that
we could actually do something,"
he said.
After the coup collapsed, "Peo
ple were driving up and down the
street, honking their horns," he
said. "But Moscow had changed
little. People's faces were con
cerned, but shops were still open
and buses still ran."
Still, Boellstorff said Mus
covites were largely unaffected by
the coup. "One percent of the peo
ple were for the coup, one percent
against, and it was life as usual
for the other 98 percent," he said.
