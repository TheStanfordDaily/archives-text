The drive to be the best.
Ten years, hundreds of accolades and
millions of sales dollars later, the people
of Quantum still aren't satisfied. Because
to us, being the best means more than
consistently outdoing the competition
with our innovative disk drive products.
It's also an inner drive—one that com
pels us to continually top our own per
sonal bests.
That kind of drive is responsible for the
industry's first drive on a card, the first 1"
profile 3-1/2" drive, and now a family of
high-speed 2-1/2" drives. And 10 con
secutive quarters of sales growth.
Are you driven?
We take only the best—and we return the
favor. We offer a generous compensation
and benefits package as well as a supe
rior work environment in our new facil
ity, just off Highway 237 in Milpitas.
If you work smart, hard and fast—like
us—and are pursuing a degree in Engi
neering, we'd like to meet you.
