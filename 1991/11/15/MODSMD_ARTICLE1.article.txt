# 'This is nothing personal'
## Note indicates alcohol was a factor in death 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
According to an investigator's report released
yesterday, junior Daniel Lichstein indicated in an
unsigned note found in his room that he had been
considering suicide for some time.
The note said, "This is nothing special, this is
something I have wanted to do ever since I knew it
was an option, this is nothing personal."
On the other side, it read, "I am an alcoholic,
but I could not withdraw."
The note was found on a chair next to Lichstein,
according to the report by the field investigator
from the Santa Clara County Coroner's office.
The Stanford Police have not officially declared the
death a suicide. Their investigation is not yet closed.
According to Toyon Resident Fellow James Fox,
Lichstein's parents said the note indicated that
Lichstein didn't blame anyone for his decision. Lich
stein's parents could not be reached for comment.
Fox added that the parents may not have been
aware that Lichstein had a drinking problem
before they arrived Sunday.
Tyler Cozzens, the resident assistant on Lich
stein's floor, said he never noticed any signs of
alcoholism in Lichstein. "I don't think he drank
more often than other students," he said.
Fox said students told him that Lichstein
"didn't drink very frequently, but when he did, he
got out of control," and acted in ways that made
other students uncomfortable.
"I know that since childhood, he had also always
had an extraordinary sensitivity to some chemicals
— a hyper response to various normal medications
that most of us can take," he continued.
Fox also said Lichstein had been under proba
tion for an "event that occurred freshman year
that the University acted on." Fox said he believed
the incident was alcohol-related.
Last Friday night, Lichstein had taken some
students to the symphony and by all reports
seemed happy.
Then, according to the investigator's report, he
and "some other students were having a little party
where vodka and beer were consumed. I He] left the
party and proceeded to his room at or about 0300
hours in an obviously intoxicated state."
He was found on the floor of his room Saturday
afternoon around 1 p.m. by his roommate, Roger
Cornwall. The report said that Lichstein was hold
ing a half-empty bottle of ibuprofen tablets.
Three additional containers were found on Lich
stein's desk, including one empty bottle of prescribed
oxycodone and two containers of tetracycline.
The police said it appears that Lichstein died
because of something he ingested. However, they
will not be sure until the toxicology report is com
pleted, which will take another four to six weeks.
A memorial service for Lichstein was held last
night in Toyon Hall.
