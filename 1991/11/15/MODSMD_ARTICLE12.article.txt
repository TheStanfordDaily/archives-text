# Muslim leader in Russia retaliates against threats

GROZNY, U.S.S.R. (AP) - The leader of a break
away Muslim region in southern Russia banned the
export of all food and "nationalized" government
property yesterday after Russia's vice president
threatened an economic blockade.
"We take this blockade very seriously," said
Dzhokar Dudayev, leader of the Chechen-Ingush
Autonomous Region. "We know what the Russians
are capable of. It's a real threat to our existence."
Ethnic strife and demands for local sovereignty
brought violence elsewhere in the country. A police
man was killed in a gun battle in Moldavia, a prose
cutor was kidnapped in Azerbaijan, and students
seized a TV station in the Bashkir region of Russia,
according to Soviet news reports.
But Grozny, capital of the Chechen-Ingush republic,
remained the main center of attention.
In declaring independence on Nov. 2, Chechen-
Ingushetia became the first ethnic enclave within
Russia to challenge Boris Yeltsin's hold on the frag
ile federation, which includes 124 ethnic groups.
"We never asked to join Russia and we have been
fighting them for 300 years," Dudayev told The
Associated Press.
Yeltsin imposed a state of emergency in the
region a week ago, but the Russian legislature over
ruled him.
Dudayev, a former Soviet bomber pilot who still
wears his fatigues in public, was elected president of
the autonomous region on Oct. 27, but Russian offi
cials allege election fraud.
Yesterday, Russian Vice President Alexander

Rutskoi called for a referendum among Chechen-
Ingushetia's 1.3 million people to determine
whether they want to separate from Russia and
retain Dudayev as their leader.
If Dudayev refuses to hold and abide by the refer
endum, Russia may impose an economic embargo,
Rutskoi told foreign reporters in Moscow.
The Russian leadership's difficulty with Chechen-
Ingushetia is ironically similar to the difficulty Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev once had with
Yeltsin's Russian government and the with seces
sionist Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
Gorbachev imposed an economic embargo on
Lithuania last year, but had to formally recognize
the independence of all three Baltic states after the
abortive hard-line coup in Moscow last Aug. 18-21.
"The logic of the collapse of the Soviet Union is
now exerting itself on Russia," Andrei Fyodorov, an
adviser to Rutskoi, told reporters in Moscow.
A rift appeared in the Russian government's
approach to the strife. Yeltsin has advocated com
promise with most of the 16 so-called
"autonomous" republics spread across the huge
Russian Federation. But Rutskoi said yesterday he
opposes Yeltsin's policy of "giving out sovereignty"
to the ethnic regions.
The government should "not create separate
princedoms," Rutskoi said.
Dudayev banned the export of food, construction
supplies, military hardware and other goods. He
ordered "nationalization" of Russian government
property.
