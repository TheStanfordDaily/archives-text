## CIV debate revisited 
### 
Now that the storm of
past years has settled,
CIV deserves our praise

The past three years
have seen many changes in
the University's curriculum.
One of the most significant has been
the transition from Western Cul
ture to Cultures, Ideas and Values.
That CIV survived the initial
barrage of criticism that resulted
from its proposal is testament to
the University's commitment to
diversifying its curriculum. The
widespread, circus-like national
attention the change received bor
dered on paranoia as die-hard tradi
tionalists and other readers of Wall
Street Journal editorials imagined
fantastic scenarios of Shakespeare
being burned in Dante's inferno.
Obviously, this has not hap
pened. What has happened has
been a positive metamorphosis,
resulting in important changes in
freshman education.
Without detracting from the
beauty and power of Shakespeare's
words, CIV has broadened the fresh
man experience significantly by
incorporating non-Western greats as
well. The notion of "great works" is
itself subject to widely varying inter
pretation. The expansion of the CIV
curriculum acknowledges that the
West has never held a monopoly on
seminal thinking.
The advantages of broadening the
curriculum notwithstanding, CIV
appears also to have added to the
expectations of freshmen — expecta
tions that are unfortunately too
optimistic.
It is far too ambitious to think
that after this one-year course stu
dents will be well-versed in all the
"great works" of Western develop
ment and be able to analyze this
development critically through
comparison with other cultures.
Literature cannot be consumed
like a pot roast. Students must real
ize that as scholars, they cannot

purchase a pound or two of culture
and then ingest it. CIV must not
further the expectation of pack
aged, ready-to-digest concepts. It is
important that freshmen realize
they will not be able to comprehend
the "Cultures, Ideals and Values"
they are exposed to merely by going
to five hours of lectures and discus
sions each week.
CIV is a valuable introduction to
the basis of societies and should
encourage further study in these
areas. It provides valuable, but
necessarily limited, discussion of a
smattering of books representing
various portions of the evolution of
culture.
CIV does not, and could never,
provide a complete understanding
of cultures, comparative or not.
But it does open the doors to the
vast library of philosophy, history
and literature that have both
shaped and reflected cultural
developments.
Overall, CIV has been a very
positive influence for freshmen.
Like all parts of the University, it
must soon undergo re-evaluation
under the glint of the budget ax.
Nevertheless, it is crucial that the
diverse and expert faculty lectur
ers that are such an important
component of CIV not be supplant
ed by graduate students.
The fact that new students have
such immediate access to some of
the campus' top faculty through
their CIV courses is something that
must not be compromised. Gradu
ate students' abilities are not neces
sarily poor, but they are far less
proven than those of the excellent
faculty members CIV now has.
In addition to providing faculty
contact, CIV also serves to unify
freshmen. The study-groups,
intensive sections and dorm intel
lectual discussions that result
from ClV's dynamic, challenging
format have given a true boost to
campus life for freshmen.
In all, CIV has proven a positive
change for the University. But
freshmen must not be misled into
thinking they are getting some
thing they are not.
