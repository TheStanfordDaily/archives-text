## Melinda McGee The 						meaning of the embattled arts 
### 
WALKING ACROSS THE campus
at the end of the day I encoun
tered a student jumping rope to
zydeco, strains of Beethoven's Ninth
pouring out a dorm window and a Bach
guitar piece on the radio at my destina
tion in the Development Office.
These sounds are particularly
poignant to me because I am the admin
istrator of the Music Department and a
long-time arts activist. Once again I am
confronted with the arts being on the "B"
list. I came to Stanford three-and-a-half
years ago because I was impressed with
the philosophy of the Music Department
that strives to provide a unified music
education — a balance of theory, history
and performance.
Music is a language. One can "think
about" music, and one can "think in"
music; performing is "thinking in"
music, speaking the language. Without
performance one is mute, silenced — and
our audiences are made deaf by the
silence.
The beauty of the arts at Stanford is
that students who are talented in many
areas learn to speak in the language of
the arts. Here they receive that special
intellectual stimulation and creativity
that comes from solving problems unique
to the arts in that the body, the whole
brain and the spirit are engaged.
The challenges the arts present can be
found nowhere else and are important in

developing a well-rounded individual. I
speak from experience; beginning as a
math major, I also pursued dance, gradu
ated with a degree in English, then went
on for a master's degree in Dance.
It was no surprise to find that the arts
were targeted for cuts. When push comes
to shove the arts are always the first to go
— an unnecessary frill. When I went to
work at the National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA) 10 years ago, Ronald Reagan
had just become president and immediate
ly started a campaign to get rid of the NEA
as a "waste of the taxpayers' money."
The arts always seem to be attacked as
a "scapegoat" for other problems; like
"welfare queens," the arts are blamed as
a cause of the federal deficit. Artists are
taxpayers, too, and as a taxpayer I would
rather my money go to support the cul
tural life of this country than the military
complex.
Why is there always such railing about
government subsidizing the arts when we
as taxpayers subsidize the National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF) to the tune of
more than $2.5 billion in 1992? The NEA
will receive $176 million for 1992, less
than 7 percent of the NSF's taxpayer
subsidized budget.
If the arts are so costly, then why is
the budget for the equivalent of the U.S.
Ministry of Culture, the NEA, less than
the budget for the U.S. military bands?
The arts are under attack on every

front. Sen. Jesse Helms is trying to take
away our First Amendment right of free
expression by imposing censorship rules
on the NEA, so that only those works that
embrace the white, Christian, family ethic
of the "moral" minority would get funding.
Taking away financial support is a
form of censorship because only those
who can afford to pay for arts training
can participate in the arts — only the
privileged. This has already happened in
many of the nation's schools. Even in our
current financial crisis Stanford should
stand strong in support of the arts
because it is that support that elevates
Stanford above other institutions and
builds the well-rounded future leaders
our country so desperately needs.
The positive side of being targeted for
cuts is that new arts activists are being
born daily, and there's always room for
more!
Think about what music, dance,
drama, creative writing and the visual
arts mean to you, and join the ever
increasing ranks of arts activists — vote
for pro-arts candidates, let your congress
men and women know that you want
your tax dollars to support the arts.
Then, turn off your television and attend
a live performance. Support the arts; you
will be richer for it.
