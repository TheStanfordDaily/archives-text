A matter of justice: Do not alter the judicial charter

THE CURRENT DEBATE ON cam
pus concerning the possibility of
changing the burden of proof in stu
dent conduct cases has reminded me of
what I went through in the spring of 1970.
I was wrongfully accused of violating
the University Policy on Campus Disrup
tion as a result of someone incorrectly
"identifying" me from a photograph
taken of people inside the Old Student
Union on the night of April 23,1970.
Like the person in the photo, I had a
scraggly beard and wire-rimmed glasses.
It is important to remember that less
than a week after that particular sit-in,
U.S. troops invaded Cambodia, and the
Stanford campus erupted. Tear gas and

riot police were everywhere. Thousands
of dollars in damage was done to Univer
sity property. Dozens of students were
beaten by police. On other campuses stu
dents were killed.
Outraged alumni — and some faculty
members and staff — demanded that
any students involved be brought to jus
tice and expelled from the University.
Outraged taxpayers who knew they
would pay the cost of enforcing the state
of siege on the Stanford campus also
sought retribution.
It was in this atmosphere that I and
14 others were charged in connection
with a nonviolent sit-in that had taken
place before the riots. We were tried only

a few weeks later, and we were not opti
mistic about our chances.
Despite the hysteria on campus, we
were able to get a fair trial. All of the
charges were dismissed at the end of the
prosecution's case because the Stanford
Judicial Council "could not find beyond
a reasonable doubt" that any defendant
had remained in the building after
receiving notice, "if indeed notice was
received at all."
The burden of proof issue is not an
unimportant and abstract concept for
someone who has been wrongfully
accused. Proponents of changing the stan
dard to "clear and convincing evidence"
will probably argue that the outcome in

my case would have been the same.
The tragedy is that the likelihood of
such an injustice increases when the
alleged offense is most reprehensible and
where the ultimate sanction — expul
sion from the University community —
is most likely to be applied.
All I ask is that everyone on campus
think about what standard you would
want applied if you were accused of
something you didn't do. It is obvious to
me that lowering the standard of proof
will inevitably result in more innocent
people being accused and convicted.
Don't change it.
