# Story on alleged child molestation jeopardized crucial parental trust
## 
### 
I am writing to comment on the Nov.
12 Daily article regarding the allegations
of child molestation at the Children's
Center of the Stanford Community. I
was upset by the implications that dis
cussion is being thwarted and informa
tion is being needlessly withheld. The
opposite is true.
The director's first letter about the
incident was distributed to parents the
morning after the allegations were made.
In the letter, Nancy Golden, the director,
invited parents to call her at work or at
home to discuss their concerns.
The amount of information available
to parents is appropriate given the neces
sity to safeguard the integrity of the on
going investigation. Not disclosing the
details of the allegations also shows sensi
tivity to the family involved and a con
cern for the rights of the person accused.
The article included a quote from
Golden's letter that stated, "It is not

appropriate to discuss this with teachers
or other adults while at the Center."
That sentence was taken out of context!
When the paragraph is read in full it is
clear that this request was made to pro
tect the children in the center.
There is almost no way adults can
converse in the center without the possi
bility of being overheard by children.
Even without fully understanding what
is being said, the children would be dis
turbed by discussion about this sensitive
and emotional issue.
The lack of care in reporting the way
this incident is being handled by the cen
ter is very unfortunate because it has
real consequences. Child molestation is
every working parent's nightmare. Only
if parents have the highest degree of
trust in the people who care for our chil
dren can we be happy and comfortable
going to work each day.
Something awful might have hap
pened on Oct. 31. But if the article has
eroded confidence in the center The
Daily has done great harm to the par
ents, and as a result, the children there.
