# Kennedy must accept some blame for student error in search process
## 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy
was out of line in his rebuke of Benny San
doval for "leaking" information to the press.
It was unjust of him not to acknowl
edge the search committee's share of the
responsibility for the misunderstanding
and for the resulting damage to the
search process. It is relatively easy for
him to shoulder a comparatively power
less undergraduate with the blame.
When I was an undergraduate at the
University of New Mexico, I participated
as a voting member on the search commit
tee for the dean of Arts and Sciences.
There were more than 100 candidates, and
several of them were internal candidates,
which can be a very touchy situation.
At our first meeting, the absolute
confidentiality of all of the committee's
proceedings was made very clear by the
chair. The process went ahead normally
and successfully. 1 just can't believe that
an institution of Stanford's repute

would leave such an important detail to
chance, to tacit understanding, or to the
nebulous concept of unwritten rules.
That is simply ludicrous! How can a
committee expect an undergraduate who
is representing the interests of thou
sands of students to be aware of all of
the subtleties involved in a search pro
cess? Students have a right to learn how
to exercise power fairly and a right to
vote on those decisions.
Search committees have the responsi
bility to protect the search process and to
educate novices in the importance of pro
tocol. To assume these things happen by
osmosis is very misguided. Kennedy owes
these students an apology and should
accept the fair share of the blame.
