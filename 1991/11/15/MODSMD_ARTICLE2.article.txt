# Mourners remember humor, compassion

### Adam Stein Staff writer 
In a somber ceremony light
ened by occasional touches of
humor, more than 100 people
gathered in Toyon yesterday to
commemorate junior Daniel
Lichstein, whose death on Satur
day was an apparent suicide.
All who spoke expressed a
great sense of loss and confusion
over Lichstein's death. "When
someone dies tragically, those left
behind are left to ask the unan
swerable question, 'Why?' Dan's

death is difficult to comprehend,
to bear," said Diana Akiyama,
associate dean of the chapel.
Of the four students who spoke,
each spoke fondly of Lichstein's
sense of humor. Junior Victor Bar
clay, who was Lichstein's room
mate last year, described him as an
"integral part of his hall in Bran
ner" freshman year.
Barclay recalled in particular
Lichstein's talent for dressing in
outrageous costumes, whether
he was squeezing into a tight
miniskirt for a dorm talent show
or covering himself with only sus
penders, a pillow and a well
placed gas mask.
Chris Symank, who lived
across the hall from Lichstein
freshman year, also mentioned
Lichstein's compassion. "He
always did strike me as someone
who cared about other people,"
Symank said. "He made such an
impact in my life, he was so much
a part of my experience in Bran
ner."
After the service, Symank
added "I really think that Dan is

going to be missed, and I hope
that if anything is learned from
this it is that we should really be
thankful for our blessings .. . and
we should take care of each
other."
Toyon Resident Fellow James
Fox opened the service by
recounting Lichstein's interests,
accomplishments and final days.
"He was an accomplished pianist,
an avid cyclist and a poet," Fox
said. Lichstein's poetry expressed
his despondency, Fox said.
After the service, Fox said the
atmosphere in Toyon is returning
to normal. "After the initial shock
and a lot of tears over the week
end, I think things have settled
down," he said. "It's been a quiet
dorm for a week."
