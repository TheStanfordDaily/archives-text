## North vs. South: Card takes on USC, UCLA 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Huge. That's what this week
end is for the No. 1 Cardinal
women's volleyball team. Stan
ford plays No. 5 UCLA tonight
and No. 12 USC tomorrow night
at Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. in
the last two home matches of the
regular season, and it will certain
ly be a momentous two days for
the Cardinal in many ways.
First, if Stanford can defeat
both of their Pacific-10 Confer
ence foes, it will clinch the confer
ence title for only the second time
in school history, the first being
in 1987. The team will also extend
its amazing unbeaten streak to 25
games.
UCLA, whom the Cardinal
defeated in four games in Los
Angeles on Oct. 19, has made
some changes since the last meet
ing. Stanford coaches and players
expect former All-American
Natalie Williams, the Bruin kill
leader, to play much better this
time. Williams pounded 23 spikes
for UCLA last time but also had
20 errors.
"Williams is now. . .in a posi
tion she's much more comfortable
with," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said.
"We're expecting that. . .she'll
have a career night against us,"
junior setter Carrie Feldman said.
USC is looking impressive as
well. The Women of Troy are a
solid third place in the Pac-10 and
took the Cardinal to four games
in Los Angeles on Oct. 18. Led by
middle-blocker Stephanie Bodi
son and 6-foot-5-inch hitter Cica
Baccelli, USC will be a formidable
challenge for Stanford.
The Cardinal is coming off a
successful road trip to Oregon

and Oregon State last weekend
where Stanford mauled both con
ference opponents in three
games. Led by senior captain
Kristin Klein, who is leading the
team in hitting percentage, kills,
and digß, the Cardinal is primed
to clinch the Pac-10 title this
weekend.
Klein, who is only three short
of the school record for kills in a
career, will enter the record books
during the match against the
Bruins. Klein continues to make a
strong case for being named Pac
-10 and NCAA Player of the Year
this season with out-of-this-world
hitting and digging numbers.
Saturday night's contest will
be the last regular-season home
match for the team's seniors,
Klein, Amy Cooper, and Nicole
Appleman. The team has desig
nated Saturday night as Senior
Night and will be recognizing
these three athletes' contribu
tions to Stanford volleyball, assis
tant coach Denise Corlett said.
"These are players who have
been the core of the team for four
years," Shaw said. "It's going to
be tough to see them go."
The Cardinal hopes to make it
a happy send-off.

Cardinal this season.
