# Running men search for first ever NCAA bid

The competition may be regional,
but its outcome will be felt nationwide.
For the Cardinal men's cross coun
try team, the NCAA District-8 Cham
pionships this Saturday at Woodward
Park in Fresno, will be more than just
a chance to affirm its status as one of
the top 25 teams in the nation. This
meet will give the runners a chance to
accomplish something that has not
been done by Stanford since 1984:
qualify for the NCAA Championships
held on November 25.
Coach Scott Chisam, in his sixth
year at the helm of the men's squad,

has several reasons to feel good about
this year's edition, which includes
seniors Dave Scudamore, Fred Carter,
and Alex Accetta, juniors Ben Cravatt
and Todd Lewis, sophomore Gary
Stolz and freshman Brian McCaffrey.
Take, for instance, the Cardinal's
fifth place finish last week at the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships.
While Oregon and Arizona, who fin
ished first and second at that meet, are
widely regarded as the top teams in
District 8 and virtually guaranteed
holders of the district's two NCAA
bids, Stanford is one of four teams
ready to seize the at-large bid which
will probably go to the district's third
place finisher.

Chisam points out that the differ
ences in the point totals of Washington
and Washington State (the third and
fourth-place finishers at the Pac-10
meet) and the Card were small and
could easily be overcome by a healthier
Stanford team this week. The only
non-conference contender for the at
large berth figures is the University of
Portland.
The 10-kilometer length of Wood
ward's course is another asset for the
Cardinal this weekend. "We're better
as a 1 OK team than we are as an 8K
team," said Chisam. The Stanford golf
course, the site of the Pac-10 meet, is
shorter than most and therefore more
difficult for the Cardinal. If Stanford

does not place five runners under
25:00, Chisam's formula for a third
place team finish, the race could rapid
ly turn into a "mini-meet" in which
Stolz and Scudamore will battle for the
top three individual spots from non
qualifying teams.
The supporting cast will be well
suited to highlighting the exploits of
Stolz and Scudamore. "They won't be
separated by much at the beginning,"
Chisam said, "which should help Dave
Scudamore, who is a moment away
from a major breakthrough."
As the Cardinal awaits this impor
tant race, it knows that the same is
true of the entire team.
