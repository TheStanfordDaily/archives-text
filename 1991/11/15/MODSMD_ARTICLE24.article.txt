# Very young team runs for experience

Regarding the fountain of youth, their
cup runneth over. On Saturday, members
the Stanford women's cross country team
will race in the NCAA District-8 Champi
onships, without the squad's two most expe
rienced collegiate runners.
Junior co-captains Ashley Black and Jill
Shenkel quit the team earlier this season,
citing burnout as the main reason for their
decisions.

"I was just not happy with running,"
Shenkel said. "When, the night before a race,
you're trying to think up reasons for getting
psyched up â€” that's not good."
Shenkel added that her many injuries also
prompted her decision to quit, but "if I were
running great, would I still be running? No."
Black also said lack of motivation was why
she quit. "I was going through the motions and
wasn't competitive," she said. "Initially, [coach
Brooks Johnson] told me it was my obligation
to complete the season. But the next day at
practice you could tell my heart wasn't in it."

Johnson was not too surprised by their
decisions. "People downshift in intensity in
athletics all the time," he said. "What it
takes to compete at this level, they, were no
longer willing to give."
"I am going to miss them," said freshman
Jeannie Rothman, who explained that the
squad of freshmen and sophomores will need
some time to gel as a team. "Once we get
some experience we'll understand better
where everyone is coming from," she said.
This competition is the qualifying meet
for the NCAA Championships.
