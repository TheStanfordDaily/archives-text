# Soccer battles Broncos
## Card seeks first postseason win since 1962 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
"If there was one team that I was really
hoping to play in the tournament, it was
Santa Clara," said forward Jim Talluto. He
and the rest of the Stanford men's soccer
team take on the Broncos tonight at 7:30
P.M. in Buck Shaw Stadium for the second
time this season.
While motivation played a big part in
the Oct. 18 match — Santa Clara came in
as the top-ranked team in the nation —
this time around, the stakes are even high
er. The game is the first playoff battle for
the Cardinal in 13 years. The last time that
Stanford won a postseason game? Way
back in 1962.
Indeed, the very fact that the No. 25
Cardinal (12-3-5) advanced to the postsea
son is a huge step for their program. Would
a victory over the third-ranked Broncos
(16-1 -1) be asking too much? Not if the two
squads' previous contest serves as a prog
nosticator. In an extremely physical
match, Stanford handed Santa Clara its
only tie of the season, a 1-1 effort that was
as even as the score indicates.
In that game, the Cardinal proved itself
capable of handling the often tumultuous
atmosphere of Buck Shaw Stadium. The
field itself is run-down, as it is often used
for both football and soccer several times
in the same week. In addition, Bronco soc
cer fans pride themselves on their ability
to get under the skin of opposing teams.
Golie Kyle Krpata does not see either of

these problems playing a factor in
tonight's game. "I think that there's a
great atmosphere at their stadium, with so
many people there," the junior said. "Plus,
we get to sleep in our own beds tonight.
For an away game, it's not that bad."
The Broncos' msgor strength lies in
their ability to consistently keep the ball in
their opponent's half of the field. "(Santa
ClaraJ will use a direct, high-pressure
offensive attack," said Stanford assistant
coach Greg Petersen. "It's ugly and effec
tive collegiate soccer." Santa Clara goalie
Kevin Rueda has thrived despite his
team's offense-oriented attack, collecting
eight shutouts on the year and allowing an
average of only 0.75 goals per contest.
Stanford, also known for its offense,
will be without the services of one of it's
biggest weapons this weekend, midfielder
Rhett Harty. The senior suffered fractured
ribs and a punctured and collapsed lung in
a collision with California goalie Alec
Rosenberg during Stanford's 3-1 win over
the Bears Nov. 6.
While Harty's absence will undoubtedly
affect the Cardinal game plan, it should
not prove to be an insurmountable obsta
cle for the team. Harty himself still gives
his team a fighting chance against Santa
Clara. "We just have so many offensive
weapons," the co-captain said. "I'd like to
be out there, but I know that the team can
still win without me."
Indeed, at this point in the season, win
ning is the bottom line for the Cardinal
soccer team.
