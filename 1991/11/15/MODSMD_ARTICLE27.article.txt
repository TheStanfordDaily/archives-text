# Richardson's always there

### Michelle Ghert Staff writer 
Cardinal strong safety Albert Richardson
has a knack for being in the right place at the
right time.
In the second quarter of last Saturday's
game against UCLA, Richardson once again
found himself coming up with the big play. On
a fourth-and-one play on the Stanford four,
Richardson stopped UCLA's Shawn Wills and
prevented the Bruins from scoring. Ironically,
Richardson and Wills are both from Hanford,
California and are very close friends.
M I saw somebody coming over the pile and I
noticed it was Shawn," Richardson said. "I
didn't think about anything except that we
gotta stop them."
Richardson's performance earned him the
honor of being named this week's National
Defensive Player of the Week by The Sporting
News. The 6-foot, 200-pound senior who had
started in only 13 games prior to this season, was
credited with six tackles and one interception.
"Albert's playing tremendous football," head
coach Denny Green said. "He plays a really
physically demanding position at strong safety
and he does the job well. He's had a lot of expe
rience at playing with a high level of intensity."
Richardson's experience as a starter on the
field began in his sophomore season in the
Washington State game. As he prepares to once
again travel to Pullman, Wash., Richardson
reflects on that game two years ago.
"I ended up having a good game and I stayed
in the secondary after that," Richardson said. "I
was looking at it as a chance to show what I
could do."
Plagued by a series of nagging injuries dur
ing his junior season, Richardson spent much of
last winter and this summer working on bal
ancing his leg strength in order to prevent any
more injuries. So far this season, he has been
injury-free.
"This year's definitely been my healthiest
year," Richardson said. "I'm just glad that I'm
being given a chance to perform at 100 percent.
Richardson's 100-percent intensity on the field
is reflected in his attitude and team leadership.
"He's been a really big leader," junior free
safety Seyon Albert said. "He's a really great
motivator on the field and he's calm in pressure
situations."
"I'm one of the few fifth-year guys on the
team," Richardson said. "I know it's easier for
someone who's been around for a while to be a
little more vocal. That's just a part of getting
people up."
With Stanford at 6-3 on the season and with
a chance to play in a bowl game, Richardson and
the rest of the Cardinal squad plan to 'be up' for
tomorrow's game against Washington State.
"I would be lying if I said I hadn't thought
about [a bowl game]", Richardson said. "That's
been one of the goals I've had since I've been
here. But the main thing now is Washington
State."
