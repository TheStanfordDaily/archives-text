# Golf goin' to Carolina
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Every tournament that the
Stanford golfers have played this
year has been blessed with West
Coast sunshine and somewhat mild
weather, but that's all over now.
Golfing isn't all about sun
shine, sun visors, and getting a
tan while playing. This weekend,
for the Cardinal men's and
women's teams, it's about earn
ing the respect of the East Coast
powerhouses and dispelling some
speculation about Stanford.
The Stanford golf teams are
donning their turtlenecks this
weekend, leaving the sunny
haven of the West Coast and brav
ing the weather of the East to
play in the Golf World Palmetto
Dunes Classic, on Hilton Head
Island in South Carolina.
Last year neither team com
peted in this prestigious tourna
ment, to which Golf World maga
zine invites the top teams in the
nation. The women's team
declined the invitation and the
men's team failed to be invited.
This year both squads are look
ing to end the fall season on a
good note and to prove them
selves to their competition on the
East Coast.
The women's team usually
does not travel to Hilton Head,
due to the bad weather and the
abundance of stiff competition in
West Coast tournaments. This
year, however, women's coach
Tim Baldwin put the matter in
the players' hands, and they
decided to go.
"We didn't go last year and
there have been comments made
that we just stay on the West
Coast," Baldwin said.
This year the sixth-ranked
Cardinal will not only compete,
but it will also have a good shot at
winning the tourney. Of the top
-10 teams that were invited, No. 1
Arizona and No. 2 San Jose State
declined, leaving the door wide
open for a Stanford victory.
The competing golfers quali
fied in practice rounds last week

end, singling out five Stanford
golfers to make the trip. Senior
Audrey Wooding will lead the
Cardinal and along with Adele
Moore and Martha Richards will
bring a wealth of experience to
the tournament.
Stanford will compete for
the first time this season against
East Coast teams such as Duke,
Florida State, and Kentucky, as
well as Tulsa and UCLA.
The men's team, on the other
hand, is not usually invited, and
this weekend the team hopes to
prove that it deserves to be
ranked in the top 15.
"Going to Hilton Head is an
honor. We can't mess around in
golf at this level," said men's
coach Wally Goodwin. This is the
first time we've ever been in a
field of this nature. This is defi
nitely the toughest field we've
seen all year."
Goodwin is sticking with the
same five players he's relied on all
fall season, including sophomore
Notah Begay who will lead the
Cardinal, with Casey Martin,
Mike Milliken, Christian Cevaer
and Dave Rutkowski hoping to
keep up with Begay to push the
Cardinal into the top 10.
"Our performance rests on
how the number three, four and
five guys play," Goodwin said. "If
they can play as hard and
thoughtfully as they can, we'll be
in good shape."
The men should be challenged
by such perennial powers as Okla
homa, Oklahoma State, Georgia
Tech, and Clemson, as well as Ari
zona and Arizona State.
Both Stanford teams had dis
appointing performances in last
week's UCLA Intercollegiate in
Palm Springs. This weekend they
will have to deal with much
rougher weather as well as the
difficult Palmetto Dunes course,
which rates as a difficult to chal
lenging course.
"The (women's) team hopes to
redeem itself a little bit this week
end. After all, we're going all the
way across the country," Baldwin
said.
