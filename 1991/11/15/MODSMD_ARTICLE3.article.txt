# Other women allege coercion by Thomas
## Evidence may not be used in court 
### Miranda Doyle Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Two women who knew senior
Stuart Thomas told Stanford
Police last month that Thomas
plied them with alcohol in
attempting to have sex with them.
The women, who said they had
consensual relationships with
Thomas, approached the police
independently after seeing accounts
of Thomas' arrest in newspapers.
Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri filed the statements in a
supplementary report, but it is
not clear whether the accounts
will be admitted in Thomas' trial.
Law. Prof Robert Weisberg said
the usual standard in cases like this
is that "evidence of prior bad acts
by the defendant cannot be used."
But, he added, there are excep
tions to that "general rule." A
judge may allow evidence about a
defendant's history if it shows a
"particular, very distinct pattern
of behavior" that relates directly
to the case, he said.
One of the women, who gradu
ated from Stanford last year, told
Frecceri that she came forward
because she had concluded "that
the (alleged) statutory rape victim
had been manipulated by Thomas
just as she had."
Thomas is charged with unlaw
ful sexual intercourse with a

minor, a felony, and providing
alcohol to a minor in connection
with an alleged Sept. 22 sexual
assault in Stern Hall.
On Wednesday, a Palo Alto
Municipal Court judge ordered
Thomas to stand trial for the
charges.
His arraignment is scheduled
for Nov. 25, and Frecceri predict
ed the trial would be held in early
or mid-December.
Thomas' attorney, Melvin de la
Motte, said he had read about the
additional claims in a newspaper,
and concluded that they "will
have no bearing on the case."
"One of the woman's reports was
from years ago, and the other didn't
even concern the issues in the case,"
he said, adding that he doesn't
believe they will be used in court.
"If we have all kinds of sleazy
information about (the alleged
victim), we can't use that either,"
de la Motte said.
Weisberg said allowing testi
mony about Thomas' sexual his
tory would be "extremely discre
tionary by the judge â€” it's on the
line between permissible and
impermissible evidence."
Detective submits report
Frecceri filed the supplemen
tary report to the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office
Oct. 25, after two women came
forward with their information.
Frecceri received a phone call
from the Stanford graduate Oct.
17. The graduate said she attended
a party at Thomas' fraternity when
she was a freshman four years ago.
"Although she was only 18 years
01d... she was constantly provided
with alcohol," the report said.
"Thomas kept saying things like,
'Drink up, little one,' and offered
her praise when she would drink
the beer. The graduate explained
that she is only 5 feet 1 inch tall,
and at the time, only 110 lbs."
The woman in the Stern Hall
incident is also 5 feet 1 inch tall
approximately 110 lbs.
The recent graduate said she
had become intoxicated and
"agreed to Thomas' offer to go
upstairs to his room, where they
engaged in consensual sexual
intercourse, which the graduate
said would not have happened if
she had not been drunk," accord
ing to the report.

The woman said she dated
Thomas for about five weeks after
the party.
Once, she said in the report,
Thomas bragged about getting a
woman "drunk and high" and
having sex with her.
"The next day,"the report
said, the woman "called Thomas
up and accused him of raping her.
Thomas said that he denied her
rape accusation and told her that
'she wanted it.' "
The report said the woman told
Frecceri she had been victimized
and manipulated by Thomas. She
said their relationship "was con
sensual, but he . .. had probably
recognized that she was a naive
freshman and had often used
alcohol to coerce her into having
sex with him."
According to the report, the
woman said Thomas once tele
phoned her room and spoke to her
roommate. Thomas "made very
suggestive sexual comments" to
the roommate, saying "it would
be our secret."
The woman told Frecceri that
she would be willing to testify in
court about her relationship with
Thomas if his character becomes

an issue.
But de la Motte said the court
will not consider the history of
either party in the case.
He said he has "a wealth of
information that (the alleged vic
tim) was being sexually sugges
tive," but the court wouldn't
allow it because "the judge didn't
want to hear about [her] prior
relationships."
'He put me on the spot'
The second woman, an 18-
year-old sophomore at California
Polytechnic State University at
San Luis Obispo, talked to Frec
ceri Oct. 22. Thomas transferred
to Cal Poly-SLO after his sopho
more year.
The woman said in an inter
view with The Daily that she had
a relationship with Thomas dur
ing June and July. Thomas'
apartment was near hers.
Although Thomas never
assaulted her, the woman said,
"he always put me on the spot and
made me feel uncomfortable about
objecting to his touching me."
She said Thomas "has a way of
convincing you without forcing
you."

She added that she is 5 feet 1
inch, while Thomas is 6 foot 7.
The woman said she came for
ward because "I know how (the
alleged victim) must feel. I didn't
want him to get away with it."
She added that she noticed
similarities between her relation
ship with Thomas and the way he
reportedly acted with the alleged
victim. "He said to her, 'No one
has to know. It will be our secret.'

He said the same thing to me."
The woman said she had con
fided in Thomas, including talk
ing about how she had been raped
a few years ago and was scared to
be involved with anyone.
"I talked to him about the rape,"
she said. "He helped me through a
rough time. He told me not all guys
were like the guy that raped me."
The report said she was espe
cially hurt that "she had seen

Thomas (two weeks prior to the
alleged Stern Hall incident), and
that he told her that he loved her."
He often asked her and her
roommate to come over and drink
with him, the woman said.
Thomas worked part-time at
Laguna Liquors in San Luis Obispo
over the summer. "He was always
telling us to come over, he would
get us a case of beer,"the woman
said.
