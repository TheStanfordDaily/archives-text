# Other women allege coercion by Thomas
## Evidence may not be used in court 
### Miranda Doyle Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Two women who knew senior
Stuart Thomas told Stanford
Police last month that Thomas
plied them with alcohol in
attempting to have sex with them.
The women, who said they had
consensual relationships with
Thomas, approached the police
independently after seeing accounts
of Thomas' arrest in newspapers.
Stanford Police Detective Tim
Frecceri filed the statements in a
supplementary report, but it is
not clear whether the accounts
will be admitted in Thomas' trial.
Law. Prof Robert Weisberg said
the usual standard in cases like this
is that "evidence of prior bad acts
by the defendant cannot be used."
But, he added, there are excep
tions to that "general rule." A
judge may allow evidence about a
defendant's history if it shows a
"particular, very distinct pattern
of behavior" that relates directly
to the case, he said.
One of the women, who gradu
ated from Stanford last year, told
Frecceri that she came forward
because she had concluded "that
the (alleged) statutory rape victim
had been manipulated by Thomas
just as she had."
Thomas is charged with unlaw
ful sexual intercourse with a

minor, a felony, and providing
alcohol to a minor in connection
with an alleged Sept. 22 sexual
assault in Stern Hall.
On Wednesday, a Palo Alto
Municipal Court judge ordered
Thomas to stand trial for the
charges.
His arraignment is scheduled
for Nov. 25, and Frecceri predict
ed the trial would be held in early
or mid-December.
Thomas' attorney, Melvin de la
Motte, said he had read about the
additional claims in a newspaper,
and concluded that they "will
have no bearing on the case."
"One of the woman's reports was
from years ago, and the other didn't
even concern the issues in the case,"
he said, adding that he doesn't
believe they will be used in court.
"If we have all kinds of sleazy
information about (the alleged
victim), we can't use that either,"
de la Motte said.
Weisberg said allowing testi
mony about Thomas' sexual his
tory would be "extremely discre
tionary by the judge â€” it's on the
line between permissible and
impermissible evidence."
