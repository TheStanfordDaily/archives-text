# Gosh, I'm graduating
## 
### Ken Wharton Staff writer 
Like many other students who have been
around for four years, I happen to be a
senior. Hard to believe, really.
I mean it seems like just last week that I
was unpacking my UPS-labeled boxes,
meeting my new dormmates and going into
Meyer Library for the first time. Sure,
that's probably because it was last week, but
that's not my point.
My point is that our fun little stint as col
lege students goes by far too quickly, and for
us seniors it's getting to be the stage in our
lives when we say to ourselves, "Gosh, grad
uation is coming up, and I still haven't
taken windsurfing yet."
But everyone knows what seniors are
really worried about. If you've talked to any
of them lately, you've seen their pulses race
at any mention of "the real world." You've
seen their eyes widen in terror when you ask
them what they're doing next year. You've
seen them try to stab you with a fork when
you pressure them for an answer.
Of course, not all of us are hypersensitive
about our future. Some seniors actually
have their lives planned out in every detail
from graduation until the time when their
first child gets cut from the high-school soc
cer team. But the rest of us, being as clueless
as we are, generally fall under one of four
categories.
Perpetual students
This group includes anyone who loves
sitting through classes so much that they've
decided to go directly to graduate school.
At this point in the year they usually
have several applications lying around,
opened only so they could see how many
important people they are going to have to
beg for recommendations, even though the
only time that they've met any faculty was
when Prof. Miller woke them up five min
utes after class had ended.
Most of these people will probably end up
somewhere in lowa, studying constantly
and getting turned down for various
awards, until the strain becomes too much
for them to bear and they finally take a
semi-automatic weapon and blast the living
bejeezus out of those annoying mechanical
puppets at Chuck E. Cheese.
Job hunters
These sorry fools are under the impres

sion that somebody might actually want to
hire them, despite the fact that the only use
ful knowledge they have picked up at Stan
ford is how to minimize the foam-to-beer
ratio when using a keg.
But regardless, many of them sit anx
iously by the phone, waiting for that magic
call that will offer them the perfect, high
paying, stress-free, no-strings-attached
employment opportunity.
Of course, others of the more enterpris
ing nature actually go out and apply for jobs,
usually through some kind of interview pro
cess that never goes quite as they plan it.
IMPOSING RICH DUDE: Well, well, it
says here that your only job experience has
been selling candy bars for the Spanish Club
fund-raiser in high school.
SMILING SENIOR: Umm, I know, but...
uh ... I learn very fast, and I interact well
with people.
RICH DUDE: I see. Have you spoken
with our janitorial department?
Procrastinators
These are the people who absolutely
refuse to deal with reality, at least not as
long as they can keep getting six compact
discs for a penny and then pretend they've
moved to Canada.
Many of them claim they're going to take
"a year off," meaning they'll be hanging
around, bothering people who have legiti
mate lives until they finally reach the limit
on all 21 of their tenuously-acquired credit
cards.
Other students have a different method
of delaying the inevitable and manage to
stick around by cleverly failing a few strate
gically placed classes, such as CIV. Sudden
ly changing one's major to a completely
unrelated field is also very popular, and it's
rumored that one rich student has managed
to keep this up since 1949.
Those who can't count very well
There's usually not too much opportuni
ty for these morons, and most of them spend
the rest of their lives writing Dave Barry
esque humor columns for cheesy newspa
pers.
And there you have it. I hope this little
list has helped you lucky underclasspeople
to understand the sort of stressful decisions
that seniors are currently avoiding. But
don't worry about me. Nope, I got my life all
figured out; next week I'm applying to UC-
Santa Barbara as an incoming freshman.
