Senior Stuart Thomas may
graduate before the University
finishes investigating allega
tions of sexual assault.
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode,
although she did not mention
the Thomas case by name, said
in last week's Faculty Senate
meeting that no University pro
ceedings were underway in the
current situation where a stu
dent was charged with sexual

assault in the criminal court
system, according to the min
utes of the meeting.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole would not say whether the
University plans to prosecute
Thomas through its own judi
cial process. "We are looking at
the situation," she said.
Thomas has 176 units of cred
it, according to the Registrar's
Office. His lawyer, Melvin de la
Motte, said at the preliminary
hearing Wednesday that Thomas
plans to graduate at the end of

this quarter and go to law school.
But Cole said the University
"routinely places a degree on hold"
if there are unanswered questions
about possible misconduct
However, there is a statute of
limitations for charging a stu
dent with misconduct, Cole said.
It must be done by the end of
the academic quarter after the
quarter misconduct occurred.
In Thomas' case, the Univer
sity must charge him by the end
of winter quarter if they wish to
investigate the allegations.
