# University fights Feds, appeals rate reduction

### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford fought back in the indirect
cost war yesterday, appealing the govern
ment's abrupt $20-million cut in last
year's reimbursements.
The appeal, filed with the Armed Services
Board of Contract Appeals, requests that the
University be paid for what it claims its actu
al indirect costs were for 1990-91.
"We feel that the government, in reduc
ing our indirect-cost recovery rate last
year, is not paying us the money to which
we are entitled," said Senior University
Counsel Debra Zumwalt, who prepared
the appeal. "The University had tried to
negotiate with the Office of Naval
Research, but the negotiations were not
able to settle on a new rate."
Last April, in the wake of revelations about
the improper use of federal research funds,
the Office of Naval Research reduced the Uni
versity's provisional indirect-cost recovery
rate from 76 to 55.5 percent — a move that
cost Stanford more than $20 million and
magnified its operating budget deficit.
The Office of Naval Research also uni
laterally terminated close to 100 "memo
randa of understanding" that allowed the
University to be reimbursed at higher

indirect-cost recovery rates.
Indirect costs are the expenses associated
with federal research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such as a portion
of library, utility and administrative costs.
The University's indirect-cost recovery
rate continued to be negotiated until
August, when the government designated
the provisional rate of 55.5 percent to be
the fixed rate for 1990-91.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
estimated that the indirect-cost recovery
rate should be about 71 percent for last
year. The $20-million appeal does not
include the $2.3 million in inappropriate
charges the University withdrew last year.
"At issue are fundamental matters of
fairness — the government's obligation to
honor its agreements and to afford con
tractors just treatment in accordance with
law and regulation," Van Etten wrote in a
statement released yesterday.
But Paul Biddle, the on-campus negotia
tor for the Office of Naval Research, said the
University is "trying to achieve a precedent
to protect costs recovered during the 1980s."
Stanford and the federal government
have not yet completed final audits for
most of the 1980s, and Biddle has claimed
