# University fights Feds, appeals rate reduction
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford fought back in the indirect
cost war yesterday, appealing the govern
ment's abrupt $20-million cut in last
year's reimbursements.
The appeal, filed with the Armed Services
Board of Contract Appeals, requests that the
University be paid for what it claims its actu
al indirect costs were for 1990-91.
"We feel that the government, in reduc
ing our indirect-cost recovery rate last
year, is not paying us the money to which
we are entitled," said Senior University
Counsel Debra Zumwalt, who prepared
the appeal. "The University had tried to
negotiate with the Office of Naval
Research, but the negotiations were not
able to settle on a new rate."
Last April, in the wake of revelations about
the improper use of federal research funds,
the Office of Naval Research reduced the Uni
versity's provisional indirect-cost recovery
rate from 76 to 55.5 percent — a move that
cost Stanford more than $20 million and
magnified its operating budget deficit.
The Office of Naval Research also uni
laterally terminated close to 100 "memo
randa of understanding" that allowed the
University to be reimbursed at higher

indirect-cost recovery rates.
Indirect costs are the expenses associated
with federal research that cannot be attribut
ed to any particular project, such as a portion
of library, utility and administrative costs.
The University's indirect-cost recovery
rate continued to be negotiated until
August, when the government designated
the provisional rate of 55.5 percent to be
the fixed rate for 1990-91.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
estimated that the indirect-cost recovery
rate should be about 71 percent for last
year. The $20-million appeal does not
include the $2.3 million in inappropriate
charges the University withdrew last year.
"At issue are fundamental matters of
fairness — the government's obligation to
honor its agreements and to afford con
tractors just treatment in accordance with
law and regulation," Van Etten wrote in a
statement released yesterday.
But Paul Biddle, the on-campus negotia
tor for the Office of Naval Research, said the
University is "trying to achieve a precedent
to protect costs recovered during the 1980s."
Stanford and the federal government
have not yet completed final audits for
most of the 1980s, and Biddle has claimed
that when those reviews are com
pleted Stanford could lose approx
imately $200 million.
But in a separate interview,
Van Etten emphasized that this
appeal has "no relationship to
previous years." He added, how
ever, that a decision about last
year "would reflect on future
negotiations."
"I agree that the critical issue
is the validity of the [memoranda
of understanding], which is the
issue by which [Biddle] comes up
with the $200-million number,"
Van Etten said. "But the govern
ment has not canceled the memo
randa for the past decade, and he
is acting as if they have."
Van Etten said if the govern
ment "retroactively canceled"
memoranda from the 1980s, the
University would likely file an
additional appeal.
He added that the appeal "does
not suggest that we are not con
tinuing negotiations for the cur
rent year. This action relates only
to fiscal year 1991."
Even if Stanford were to win the
appeal, it would not fix the current
budget crisis because the change in
the indirect-cost recovery rate
would only decrease the reserves
spent to cover last year's deficit.
The University is seeking an
indirect-cost recovery rate of 72
percent for the current year, Van
Etten said. "If we can't negotiate
a rate, we would consider an
appeal. It depends on how the
negotiations progress."
But Biddle said this appeal
shows the University has lost
faith in negotiations as a way to
settle.
"It is evident that Stanford has
given up on resolving the issues
administratively based on their
merit. They believe they will find
more success with legal technical

ities," Biddle said.
Van Etten said it is "absolutely
false" to assert that the Universi
ty has abandoned negotiations.
"We have spent thousands of
hours and countless meetings try
ing to negotiate a settlement," he
said. "There is a very extensive
trail of letters, and all of these
efforts are why we waited so long
before resorting to this appeal."
Biddle also said the Universi
ty's decision "shows naivete with
regard to federal regulations. I
could never have wished for them
to do something so foolish."
Biddle said the University
would not actually recover any
funds after the government com
pleted its audit of the claimed
indirect costs because the memo
randa of understanding only
apply to predictions of expenses.
Van Etten declined to com
ment on Biddle's allegations last
night without first consulting;
University attorneys.
He said the appeal is an
attempt to have the case "viewed
by an impartial body independent
of political biases." The Armed
Services Board of Contract
Appeals is equivalent to a U.S.
District Court within an adminis
trative branch of government.
The University now has 30
days to file a formal, detailed com
plaint, and the government has a
month to respond. Both sides
then begin a "lengthy period of
discovery" that could take from
six months to two years, accord
ing to Paul Williams, chair of the
appeals board.
"In a case of this magnitude
with so many contracts, both
sides could spend a couple of
years fencing," he said. A hearing
similar to a trial will then be held
and decided by a panel of judges.
Williams said this type of case
is "not common" from universi
ties. "The normal circumstances
for cost-type contracts is for them
to be settled between the two par
ties," he said.
