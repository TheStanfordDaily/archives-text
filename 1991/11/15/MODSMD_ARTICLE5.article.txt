# Staff delivers ultimatum
## Employees demand retraction of benefits change 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Responding to the recent change in
employee heath-insurance benefits, Stan

organization requested that the Universi

of people upset, that it was a bad decision
and that they should rescind it."
He emphasized that the group, which he

said now includes at least 250 members,
preferred the more "peaceful methods."
However, if those measures don't work,
the group does have some "big guns" it could
pull out, Peacock said. He listed the possibil
ities of unionization, striking or seeking out
side legal help with organizations such as the
American Civil Liberties Union.
There was no official University response
yesterday because the letter was deliver**!

processed, according to a secretary in the
President's Office.
The controversy over health-insurance
benefits arose last month when the Uni
versity announced that single employees
will have to begin making monthly pay
ments on their health-insurance plans in
March 1992, because the University is
decreasing its contribution to the policies.
These changes are intended to trim
costs by reducing the number of employ

outside policy, such as their spouse's, and
also to encourage employees to choose
