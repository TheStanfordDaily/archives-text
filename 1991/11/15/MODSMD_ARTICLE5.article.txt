# Staff delivers ultimatum
## Employees demand retraction of benefits change 
### Paul Curthoys Staff writer 
Responding to the recent change in
employee heath-insurance benefits, Stan
ford Employees for Equity yesterday deliv
ered an ultimatum to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
A letter from the new faculty and staff
organization requested that the Universi
ty decide to delay the March 1992 imple
mentation of the benefits change by Nov.
22, or face "further action ... to gain con
sideration of our grievance."
According to Glenn Peacock, MedNet
Network Manager at the Medical School
and spokesperson for the employee group,
"further action" could entail a variety of
possibilities, such as holding protest ral
lies, flooding the benefits office with
paperwork or "more extreme" measures.
"We don't want to put the University in
a difficult position," Peacock said. "We
want them to recognize that there's a lot
of people upset, that it was a bad decision
and that they should rescind it."
He emphasized that the group, which he

said now includes at least 250 members,
preferred the more "peaceful methods."
However, if those measures don't work,
the group does have some "big guns" it could
pull out, Peacock said. He listed the possibil
ities of unionization, striking or seeking out
side legal help with organizations such as the
American Civil Liberties Union.
There was no official University response
yesterday because the letter was deliver**!
late in the afternoon, and had not yet been
processed, according to a secretary in the
President's Office.
The controversy over health-insurance
benefits arose last month when the Uni
versity announced that single employees
will have to begin making monthly pay
ments on their health-insurance plans in
March 1992, because the University is
decreasing its contribution to the policies.
These changes are intended to trim
costs by reducing the number of employ
ees who are double-covered under another
outside policy, such as their spouse's, and
also to encourage employees to choose
their health insurance programs
more carefully. According to the
University, the resulting competi
tion would increase the quality of
service and decrease costs.

Rates for married employees will
be lowered as part of the Universi
ty's anticipated overall decrease in
costs due to the changes.
Many employees have respond
ed angrily to the change, saying it
discriminates against single
employees. "In effect, it creates a
difference in compensation of as
much as $900 to $1,000 annually"

between single and married
employees, Peacock said.
A main goal of the group, he
said, is to gain access to the data
and rationale the University used
in reaching this decision, as well
as their motives for making the
change.
"I do feel we've been getting
the runaround," he said.

"If the University is really mov
ing towards a flexible benefits plan,
why is this change absolutely neces
sary now?" he asked. "They're
already in a bad position with
respect to staff morale and
finances. Why do they want to
throw out one more thing at•
employees after everything else?*
Their timing is very inappropriate."
