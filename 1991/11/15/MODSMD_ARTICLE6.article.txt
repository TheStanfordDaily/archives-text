# Little known Baha'i faith has endured
## 
### Anna Buchmann 
In early October 1912, the
arrival of a Persian religious
prophet in San Francisco seized
the attention of Bay Area newspa
pers and Stanford's first president.
"Abdul Baha Abbas Says
Object of Mission Is to Unify All
Creeds," read a headline in the
San Francisco Chronicle. The
article ended with an announce
ment of Abdul Baha's speech
that afternoon at Stanford.
Abdu'l-Baha's oratory on uni
versal peace, delivered at the
invitation of then-University
President David Starr Jordan,
marked Stanford's introduction
to the Baha'i faith.
Baha'i thus has "special
meaning" for Stanford, accord
ing to Tarry Mahony, a graduate
student in East Asian studies
and one of nine members of
Stanford's local Baha'i leader
ship known as the "Assembly."
Mahony said Abdu'l-Baha
"visited North America to try
and awaken people from blind
prejudice" and to say that "this
age must see the unity of the
human race."
Abdu'l-Baha was the eldest
son and appointed successor of
Baha'u'llah, the founder of the
Baha'i faith, Mahony said.
He said both men were
imprisoned and exiled during the
late 19th century because Islam
ic leaders feared the teachings of
the popular Baha'i religion —

which included, among other
things, a belief in the equality of
men and women. Abdu'l-Baha
was freed in 1908 by the Young
Turk Revolution, which over
threw the Ottoman Empire.
The Baha'i faith, Mahony
said, includes beliefs that all reli
gions come from the same

source and are therefore one;
that the human race is one race;
that men and women are equal;
and that science and religion
should coexist in harmony.
The faith is organized on local,
national and international levels,
Mahony said. There are about 25
Baha'is at Stanford, 100,000 in

the United States, and as many
as eight million worldwide. The
Baha'i International Community
has had consultative status at the
United Nations since 1948,
Mahony said.
