# Little known Baha'i faith has endured
## 
### Anna Buchmann 
In early October 1912, the
arrival of a Persian religious
prophet in San Francisco seized
the attention of Bay Area newspa
pers and Stanford's first president.
"Abdul Baha Abbas Says
Object of Mission Is to Unify All
Creeds," read a headline in the
San Francisco Chronicle. The
article ended with an announce
ment of Abdul Baha's speech
that afternoon at Stanford.
Abdu'l-Baha's oratory on uni
versal peace, delivered at the
invitation of then-University
President David Starr Jordan,
marked Stanford's introduction
to the Baha'i faith.
Baha'i thus has "special
meaning" for Stanford, accord
ing to Tarry Mahony, a graduate
student in East Asian studies
and one of nine members of
Stanford's local Baha'i leader
ship known as the "Assembly."
Mahony said Abdu'l-Baha
"visited North America to try
and awaken people from blind
prejudice" and to say that "this
age must see the unity of the
human race."
Abdu'l-Baha was the eldest
son and appointed successor of
Baha'u'llah, the founder of the
Baha'i faith, Mahony said.
He said both men were
imprisoned and exiled during the
late 19th century because Islam
ic leaders feared the teachings of
the popular Baha'i religion —

which included, among other
things, a belief in the equality of
men and women. Abdu'l-Baha
was freed in 1908 by the Young
Turk Revolution, which over
threw the Ottoman Empire.
The Baha'i faith, Mahony
said, includes beliefs that all reli
gions come from the same

source and are therefore one;
that the human race is one race;
that men and women are equal;
and that science and religion
should coexist in harmony.
The faith is organized on local,
national and international levels,
Mahony said. There are about 25
Baha'is at Stanford, 100,000 in

the United States, and as many
as eight million worldwide. The
Baha'i International Community
has had consultative status at the
United Nations since 1948,
Mahony said.

enrolled in 1923, and Jordan
offered her the president's office
as a meeting place for Baha'is,
Mahony said.
There is no Baha'i priesthood,
and there are only a few struc
tured Baha'i meetings, according
to Mahony. The Baha'i calendar
has 19 months of 19 days, and the
first day of each month is a
"feast," which involves communi
ty business, a social and devotion
from the writings of Baha'u'llah.
Stanford's Baha'is are diverse,
including students, staff and Bay
Area professionals. Those in
attendance at a Baha'i meeting
last week cited many different
reasons for joining the faith.
Mahony said the Baha'i ideal
of a "world in harmony in diversi
ty" was a powerful attraction.
And Louise Groger, an 84-
year-old San Francisco resident,
said her parents disapproved of
her black and Filipino friends
when she was a child, and the
Baha'i ideal of eliminating preju
dice attracted her. She became a
Baha'i in 1935.
The philosophy underlying the
Baha'i faith can be rhetorically
overwhelming. The topic of
Thursday's meeting, "Translat
ing Ideals into Reality," gave stu
dents a chance to question

Baha'is about the way they act on
principles of the faith.
One undergraduate was grap
pling with recent episodes of
racial tension at Santa Clara Uni
versity. He wanted to know how
Baha'is work to achieve the goal
of "racial harmony."
Staff member Deborah Bua
responded by describing the Insti
tute for Healing Racism, a Baha'i
program developed three years
ago by an East Coast journalism
professor who defined racism as a
disease.
Another Stanford freshman
was concerned that the Baha'i
faith did not respect the diversity
of different cultures, since its goal
is "human global unity."
Hamid Samandari, a doctoral
student, responded that the
Baha'i faith does not homogenize
different cultures. However, he
added, "Cultures are not fixed
things. They evolve over time."
Mahony emphasized that
Baha'is promote world unity pri
marily by modeling their own lives
and their communities on that
principle. For instance, Baha'i
elections for assembly positions
on the local, national and interna
tional levels involve no nomina
tions or electioneering. Rather,
leaders are selected by general bal
lot, and all Baha'is are eligible.
"Baha'is don't proselytize or
put pressure on people," Mahony
said. "All things are up to the
individual."

ic leaders feared the teachings of
the popular Baha'i religion —

which included, among other
things, a belief in the equality of
men and women. Abdu'l-Baha
was freed in 1908 by the Young
Turk Revolution, which over
threw the Ottoman Empire.
The Baha'i faith, Mahony
said, includes beliefs that all reli
gions come from the same

source and are therefore one;
that the human race is one race;
that men and women are equal;
and that science and religion
should coexist in harmony.
The faith is organized on local,
national and international levels,
Mahony said. There are about 25
Baha'is at Stanford, 100,000 in

the United States, and as many
as eight million worldwide. The
Baha'i International Community
has had consultative status at the
United Nations since 1948,
Mahony said.
Stanford's first Baha'i student

Graduate student Tarry Mahony is one of nine members of Stanford's Baha'i leadership known as
the "Assembly." One main goal of the Baha'is is to promote world unity.
enrolled in 1923, and Jordan
offered her the president's office
as a meeting place for Baha'is,
Mahony said.
There is no Baha'i priesthood,
and there are only a few struc
tured Baha'i meetings, according
to Mahony. The Baha'i calendar
has 19 months of 19 days, and the
first day of each month is a
"feast," which involves communi
ty business, a social and devotion
from the writings of Baha'u'llah.
Stanford's Baha'is are diverse,
including students, staff and Bay
Area professionals. Those in
attendance at a Baha'i meeting
last week cited many different
reasons for joining the faith.
Mahony said the Baha'i ideal
of a "world in harmony in diversi
ty" was a powerful attraction.
And Louise Groger, an 84-
year-old San Francisco resident,
said her parents disapproved of
her black and Filipino friends
when she was a child, and the
Baha'i ideal of eliminating preju
dice attracted her. She became a
Baha'i in 1935.
The philosophy underlying the
Baha'i faith can be rhetorically
overwhelming. The topic of
Thursday's meeting, "Translat
ing Ideals into Reality," gave stu
dents a chance to question

Baha'is about the way they act on
principles of the faith.
One undergraduate was grap
pling with recent episodes of
racial tension at Santa Clara Uni
versity. He wanted to know how
Baha'is work to achieve the goal
of "racial harmony."
Staff member Deborah Bua
responded by describing the Insti
tute for Healing Racism, a Baha'i
program developed three years
ago by an East Coast journalism
professor who defined racism as a
disease.
Another Stanford freshman
was concerned that the Baha'i
faith did not respect the diversity
of different cultures, since its goal
is "human global unity."
Hamid Samandari, a doctoral
student, responded that the
Baha'i faith does not homogenize
different cultures. However, he
added, "Cultures are not fixed
things. They evolve over time."
Mahony emphasized that
Baha'is promote world unity pri
marily by modeling their own lives
and their communities on that
principle. For instance, Baha'i
elections for assembly positions
on the local, national and interna
tional levels involve no nomina
tions or electioneering. Rather,
leaders are selected by general bal
lot, and all Baha'is are eligible.
"Baha'is don't proselytize or
put pressure on people," Mahony
said. "All things are up to the
individual."
