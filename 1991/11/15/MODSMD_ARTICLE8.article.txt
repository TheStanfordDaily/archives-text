Breast implants defended
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Food and Drug
Administration panel unanimously recommended
yesterday that silicone-gel breast implants remain
available to women despite finding that safety data
submitted by four manufacturers was inadequate.
The panel recommended that more safety data
on the devices be gathered.
Panel members expressed concern about the
lack of safety and durability data on the implants
but said they were equally concerned that denying
these devices to women could also have harmful
consequences.
Several panel members urged the FDA to mon
itor the use of the devices closely, to assure that
women who want them are informed of their risks
and to prod the industry to collect more data.
AIDS definition may change
ATLANTA (AP) — The number of U.S. AIDS
cases could nearly double under a federal proposal
yesterday that would expand the definition of the
disease to include 160,000 people infected but not
yet seriously ill.
The case count stands at 195,718, but 1 million
more Americans are believed to be infected with
HIV, the virus that causes the disease. Health offi
cials estimate 160,000 of those, many of whom
don't know they're infected, would fall under the
new definition.
AIDS activists said the expanded definition
would make more people qualify for disability pay
ments, but warned that more officially recognized

AIDS patients could mean a bigger battle for treat
ment resources.
The new definition would add patients who
aren't necessarily sick, but whose immune systems
are already under severe attack by the virus.
Buchanan to challenge Bush
WASHINGTON (AP) — Commentator Patrick
Buchanan plans to challenge President Bush next
year as a voice for disaffected conservatives,
friends and party activists said yesterday.
"He's serious," said longtime Republican opera
tive and Buchanan friend Edward Rollins. "He's
99 percent certain he's going to do it."
Rollins said Buchanan told him he expects to
make a final decision near the Thanksgiving holi
day.
Any Republican would have a hard time wrest
ing the nomination from Bush. But Buchanan
could stymie the White House's goal of focusing on
the fall general election while Democrats bloody
themselves in the primaries.
StarKist goes dolphin-free
NEW YORK (AP) — An environmental group
said yesterday it has enlisted StarKist Seafood Co.

tuna fishing and refit ships to protect dolphin.

of Approval" on its tuna cans for adhering to the
new standards, said Don White, president of
Earthtrust, a dolphin-protection group based in
Hawaii.
