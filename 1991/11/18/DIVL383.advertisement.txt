STANFORD EMPLOYEES FOR EQUITY
FORMED: November 6,1991
MEMBERSHIP:
All Stanford employees (staff and
faculty) concerned about Stanford
benefits, including single and
married employees, individual
health coverage employees, gay and
lesbian employees, retired
employees, employees with
dependents, employees worried
about future unexpected changes
in the benefits plan, employees
bothered by the divisiveness of the
benefits change announced
October 23, 1991; existing staff
organizations whose members vote
to support our efforts.
Principles:
1. to affirm the principle of equal
compensation (salary plus
benefits) for equal work.
2. to affirm the principle that
Stanford employees agree to
provide their work services to
the university in exchange for
specified salary and benefits,
and that changes-to this "social
contract" should only be made
with wide open community
discussion and consultation.
3. to affirm the principle that
employees, and not the
employer, arc best suited to
make economic decisions
affecting their own private lives,
and that employees should be
given appropriate choices to
tailor benefits to their own lives.
Goals:
1. WE urge that the administration
immediately halt the
implementation of the flawed
benefits plan announced
Octobcr 23rd, 1991; and that the
administration immediately
establish a diverse work group to
develop a more equitable short
term plan for 1992.
2. WE urge that the administration
immediately begin to develop, in
consultation with a diverse
group of employees, a long term
flexible benefits plan to be
placed into effect by November
of 1992, that would allow each
employee to tailor benefits to
meet her or his personal family
circumstances, including
children, spouses, and domestic
partners.
3. WE deplore the administration's
process for changes in benefits
and we request a far greater
level of community discussion
and consultation than was used
in this instance, as well as
making public the information
on which benefits changes arc
made. We request that any
future changes receive wide
discussion in community forums,
as well as consultation from the
staff and faculty organizations
(ethnic, gay and lesbian,
religious, disabled, work group,
professional, etc.)
4. WE request that the benefits
committee be substantially
restructured and made more
accountable to the community,
to more adequately meet the
benefits needs of Stanford
employees (staff and faculty).

Wednesday, November 20, 1991, 5:30 pm, Cypress Room, TVesidder Memorial Union
