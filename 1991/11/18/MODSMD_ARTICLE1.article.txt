# Compiled archives await space

Who was the first black stu
dent at Stanford? When was
Ujamaa established? What is
the traditional role that the
Black Student Union has
played within Stanford's black
community?
Answers to these questions
and others concerning black his
tory at Stanford are awaiting dis
covery in the Ujamaa Archives.
But the archives "are
presently in limbo," according
to recent graduate Louis
Jackson, who helped coordi
nate the archives in 1986.
An array of material docu
menting the history of the
black community at Stanford
sits unused in an Ujamaa clos
et. A small portion of the col
lection — including old year
books, black Stanford publica
tions and pictures of former
Ujamaa residents — is on dis
play in Ujamaa's large lounge.
The ultimate hope for the
archives is that they will be
"institutionalized into an
active collection where people
could easily access materials,"
Jackson, who was a theme
associate at Ujamaa in 1986,
said. The archives are also
supposed to serve as an exten
sion of the Black Cultural
Library, which can also be
found in Ujamaa.
Jackson said that a small
room in upstairs Ujamaa orig
inally was to be converted into
an archive study room where
people could read materials
and watch film clippings of
black events at Stanford.
However, this plan has been
indefinitely postponed for
financial reasons, he said.
As a TA, Jackson combed

anything historically related to
the Stanford black community.
The collection also details the
intriguing history of blacks at
Stanford. Jackson pointed out
some letters he had discovered in
the presidential files of the Uni

versity's archives. Dated 1969 —
the first year the BSU became a
significant force on campus —
these letters are from black stu
dents denouncing the BSU and
professing their steadfast alle
giance to Stanford.
Jackson said material such as
these letters is critical in compre
hending black history at Stanford
"because it not only reveals dis
sention within the black Stanford

community, it reveals how the
administration had the access to
material that the BSU didn't have
access to."
Sophomore Tahira Boyd, who
is heading a committee that will
work on the collection, said, "I
would like to make it comprehen
sive enough for the faculty and
students to eventually research
an African-American history at
Stanford."
