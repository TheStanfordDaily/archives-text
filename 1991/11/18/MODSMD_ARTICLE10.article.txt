Czech ruler wants more power
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — President
Vaclav Havel, frustrated by legislative bickering
paralyzing the country and threatening its
future, said yesterday he would seek new pow
ers including the possibility of ruling by decree.
The playwright and former dissident said in
a nationwide address that in some ways even
more was at stake for the country than during
the country's revolt against communism that
began two years ago yesterday.
"Today, the point is whether we will become a
civilized European democracy or a despised area
of incessant conflicts and disorders," he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As many as 60 mil
lion Americans could lose their charge cards and
the economy could return to recession if
Congress forces a reduction in credit card inter
est rates, bankers say.
"Something like this gets to every consumers'
pocketbook," according to Mark Riedy, presi
dent of the National Council of Community
Bankers. "Is it the straw that breaks the camel's
back and leads us back into another recession? If
it goes through, it certainly could be."
