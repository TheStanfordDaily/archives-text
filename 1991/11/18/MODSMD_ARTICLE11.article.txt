# Baker's visit to China results in U.S. gains

Secretary of State James Baker yesterday touted an
arms control agreement and progress on human
rights and trade as "clear gains" justifying his con
troversial three-day visit to China.
But Baker acknowledged the gains fell short of
U.S. goals.
"I did not come here expecting a dramatic break
through," Baker said after a five-hour session with
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. "The gulf is too wide
to accomplish that in one trip."
And he conceded that the steps China agreed to
take may not satisfy congressional critics who ques
tioned why the Bush administration dropped a ban
on high-level contacts with Beijing without first
receiving major concessions.
Baker was the highest-ranking U.S. official to
visit China since the bloody 1989 crackdown in
Tiananmen Square that set back Sino-American
relations.
"I'll let the Congress speak for itself," he said
when asked at a news conference in Beijing if he

thought he had accomplished enough to blunt a
drive to strip China of its most-favored-nation trade
status.
President Bush opposes the congressional move.
The Chinese did not agree to release any political
prisoners, and Baker acknowledged he wished he
had won "more progress on human rights."
He said he considered China's pledge to join the
international Missile Technology Control Regime
and thus to stop selling medium-range missiles to
other nations his most important accomplishment
during 18 hours of discussions with Chinese lead
ers.
China has sold medium-range missiles to Syria
and Pakistan.
In return, the United States agreed to lift sanc
tions imposed against two Chinese firms accused of
transferring missile technology to Pakistan.
Baker said the Chinese also gave an accounting of
the status of some 800 political prisoners and agreed
to make it easier for people to emigrate.
The Beijing leadership pledged to join the

Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by the end of the
year and promised positive steps toward protecting
intellectual property including published materials,
sound recordings, computer software and patents â€”
items the Chinese regularly pirate.
"What we have here represents gains, clear
gains, I think, in the fields of proliferation and trade
that are the basis now for solving some of the diffi
cult problems in those areas," Baker said.
Asked if the Chinese had agreed to release any
political prisoners, Baker replied, "Well, I don't
know. Let's see what happens. I don't have any
thing to report to you tonight. We would like to see
that, of course."
He said the Chinese did agree that "any person
against whom no criminal procedures were pending
would be allowed to leave after completing the usual
formalities."
Baker noted that last spring the United States
gave the Chinese a list of some 800 political prison
ers and asked for information about them and for
their release.
