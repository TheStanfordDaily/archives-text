# U.S. Congressman gathers evidence:
## Salvadoran officers plotted murder of priests 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Salvadoran minister of defense and
other top generals attended the
1989 meeting at which military offi
cers decided to murder six Jesuit
priests, according to confidential
sources cited yesterday by a U.S.
lawmaker.
Rep. John Joseph Moakley, D-
Mass., chairman of a special task force
of House Democrats that has investi
gated the killings, released a six-page
statement laying out what he called
"direct and circumstantial evidence"
that the priests were murdered on

orders from top Salvadoran comman
ders.
The slayings of the Jesuits, their
housekeeper and her daughter at the
Central American University of San
Salvador on Nov. 16, 1989 stirred an
international outcry and led to a cut
off of U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
Moakley said the task force got its
information from confidential sources
inside El Salvador, including the
Salvadoran military and "other non
classified sources."
He laid out this scenario for the
killings:

"According to these sources, the
decision to murder the Jesuits was
made at a small meeting of officers
held at the Salvadoran Military School
on the afternoon prior to the murders
(Nov. 15, 1989).
"Among those present were Col.
(Guillermo Alfredo) Benavides, com
mander of the military school; Gen.
Juan Rafael Bustillo, then head of
the Salvadoran Air Force (now
assigned to the Salvadoran Embassy
in Israel); Gen. Emilio Ponce, then
chief of staff and now minister of
defense; Gen. Orlando Zepeda,

deputy minister of defense; and Col.
Elena Fuentes, commander of the
First Brigade.
"Reportedly, the initiative for the
murders came from Gen. Bustillo,
while the reactions of the others
ranged from support to reluctant
acceptance to silence."
Moakley said the task force
sources included "an allegedly eye
witness account of the meeting by an
individual known to have been pre
sent at the military school that after
noon" and confirmation by a second
person that the officers were there.
