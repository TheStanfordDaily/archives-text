Students must not be
silenced by Stanford's
illusions of no stress

LAST WEEKEND, A member
of the Stanford community
took his own life. Although
such a loss always comes as an
abrupt and terrifying shock to any
group, it seems even more startling
when juxtaposed against the palm
trees and rolling foothills of the
Stanford campus.
More than 100 people gathered at
a memorial service held for Daniel
Lichstein on Thursday, several of
whom recalled colorful anecdotes
and touching moments about the
junior. They spoke about the black
miniskirt he wore for a Branner tal
ent show and the strategically placed
gas mask he wore as a costume for
his freshman exotic erotic ball.
Dan Lichstein wasn't a fringe
member of the Stanford communi
ty. No, he wasn't the quarterback
of the football team or a member of
the Council of Presidents, but he
was someone you were likely to
run into at a party or peg with a
paper ball at Flicks.
In his suicide note, Lichstein
referred to himself as an alcoholic.
Not many of his friends, if any,
knew this. His roommates and
friends who spoke at the memorial
service were only able to recall the
exuberance, the happiness, of his
character. Not one person there
seemed to have much of a clue as to
the depth of his personal trauma.
The happy-go-lucky life of a
Stanford student, hopping from
intramural game to fraternity
party, was shattered last weekend.
The facade of a stressless paradise
was put on temporary suspension.
For a couple of days, everyone
seemed shocked into the realiza
tion that there is real pain here at
Stanford, and for one person, that
pain became too much.
The Stanford environment, where
pain and stress are often masked,

can be a tough place to admit diffi
culty or failure. When no one else is
admitting their plights and personal
problems, it may be too difficult to
open up about one's own pain.
It is almost too easy to hide the
pain from oneself, to deceive one
self into the Stanford stereotype of
a well-rounded young man or
woman on the easy road to a two
car garage and a swimming pool in
the backyard.
It's an almost inescapable stereo
type, thrown upon all Stanford stu
dents since the day they opened
their acceptance letter. After all,
how could this young man, who had
everything going for him — friends,
family, a packed resume and an
almost-completed Stanford degree
in computer science — how could
he take his own life?
The Stanford community must
be willing to shed at least a part of
this stereotype. No one here can
live up to that mold. There will be
times when people here feel as if
they have failed, or feel lonely or
hopeless.
Stanford can no longer afford to
uphold an unrealistic ideal. Instead,
the atmosphere must be shifted to
one that allows imperfections and
encourages its members to share
and accept those realities.
Most Stanford students don't
face the kind of trauma Lichstein
experienced last weekend, and for
an unknowable number of week
ends before that. But most stu
dents here do have problems and
fears, and too many of them are
afraid to show them, afraid that by
showing them they will have in
some way failed, and that they are
the only ones who have felt this.
The tragedy would be to view
this incident in isolation, to walk
away thinking the problems that
Lichstein faced were totally for
eign to the rest of the community.
The reality is that Stanford can
be a tough place sometimes, a lone
ly place, and unless the people on
this campus begin to recognize each
other's problems, and be less afraid
to admit their own, it cannot help
but continue to be so.
