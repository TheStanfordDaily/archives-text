## The 						master of deceit 
### 
YOU JUST GOTTA GIVE David Duke
a hand. You don't have to like, respect
or believe the man, but you have to
give him a hand. Anyone who can get plas
tic surgeiy and a chemical peel done not
only to his face but also to his past and
come as close as he did to getting away with
it â€” well, that's not just whistling Dixie.
Duke, a former Nazi and Klan leader,
managed to get into the hearts of a sub
stantial amount of Louisiana voters by
exchanging his blatant racist, anti-Semitic
rhetoric for more low-key anti-govern
ment fare. He said big government, in the
form of welfare "causing crime, causing
poverty, causing drugs, destroying the
very basis of our lives," is the problem.
Duke got away from the polemical and
into the practical. He looked at the average
white Louisiana voter and said Wake up.'
The reason you don't have money and Amer
ica is going to hell is welfare and all these
social programs that put you, the white
American, at a disadvantage. He played on
the historical racial tension between blacks
and whites. He used social ignorance and
made it an us-against-them fight.
And as a disgruntled, economically
repressed people are prone to do, Louisiana
whites cheered at the prospect of a scape
goat. It didn't matter that the deliverer of
the this scapegoat had an illustrious past as
a member of numerous hate organizations.
He identified with them and he was going
to raise the sun and the moon if need be to

make their lives better.
He legitimized everything ugly they
kept hidden within and gave it the new
name of social reform. He validated the
things they said over a bottle of liquor
after work about why their paychecks
were getting smaller and how they
missed the good old days. He confirmed
the bitter feelings they had toward soci
ety as righteous and deserved hatred.
And the saddest part is that David Duke
may have a point. Our welfare system is
obviously wrecked and out of control. It
doesn't serve well the people it was created
for and it isn't moving anyone closer to self
sufficiency. It's abused and badly adminis
tered. It creates a trap, mentally, emotion
ally and physically, that very few people
have the means to escape from. Those that
utilize the system are just as victimized as
those that condemn the system.
But nobody has the guts to say that the
system needs to reform and make the neces
sary changes. Like the society that allowed
the emperor to walk around naked as they
admired his new clothes, we accept the detri
mental social programs as untouchable bas
tions of our nation. We leave it up to people
who have nothing to lose, like Duke, to say
what we know and admit. But in the process,
they twist it into their own interpretation,
for their own ends.
The message out of Louisiana is that
vultures like Duke are prepared to appeal
to the decay within our society and use it.

They are attracted to the stench of igno
rance and hate and will thrive upon it.
Duke may be the most visible and sophis
ticated of his ilk, but he is not alone. He is
only one of many quacks waiting to offer
his snake oil for America's wounds. And
when people's pocketbooks are thin and
they feel disjointed from from the sys
tem, they are going to look at the scape
goats offered to them like golden calves.
Louisiana overwhelmingly defeated
Duke in favor of a less than reputable
opponent, Edwin Edwards. In his victory
speech Edwards said, "Louisiana became
the first to turn back the merchant of hate,
the master of deceit.... Tonight is the first
night of our journey to decency, to honesty,
to fairness, to justice, to respect. ..."
But if real leaders don't emerge to
chart a positive social and economic path
that all Americans can ascend upon,
Louisiana and the rest of the Union will
face a short journey. Rebuffed merchants
of hate and masters of deceit rarely turn
back for long, as Mr. Duke's role model, a
social-misfit German painter named
Adolf, can attest to.
