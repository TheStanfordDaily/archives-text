## Altering doubt standard will not aid assault victims 
### 
I READ WITH INTEREST THE pro
posed changes to the Stanford Judi
cial Charter. However, from my per
spective as a trial lawyer, as well as a
former Stanford student, a former mem
ber of the Stanford Judicial Council and
a former federal criminal prosecutor, the
conclusion that it reaches regarding the
burden of proof is wrong.
The debate thus far seems to have
focused on the pros and cons of the bur
den of proof — whether to retain the
current standard of proof beyond a rea
sonable doubt or to adopt a lesser stan
dard of proof by clear and convincing
evidence. The report urges the adoption
of the clear and convincing evidence
standard on the grounds that it is neces
sary to improve the conviction rate in
sexual assault cases.
The report's conclusion that changing
the burden of proof will result in a suc
cessful conviction in such cases is mis
taken. The proposed change in the bur
den of proof will not change the result in
such cases.

The answer lies in an understanding
of the meaning of burden or proof. The
case discussed in the report is the classic
"swearing contest" case, where there are
only two witnesses, one on each side,
and both equally believable.
In that case, under any burden of proof
standard, the Judicial Council would have
to find in favor of the accused student and
against the complainant. Why? Because to
prove a charge under either burden of
proof, the complainant must have more
than evenly balanced evidence. The differ
ence between the two burdens of proof is
simply how much more.
So changing the burden of proof to
clear and convincing evidence will never
change the result, so long as the evi
dence remains evenly balanced.
The way to accomplish a changed
result is to gather more and better evi
dence in sexual assault cases. As the
Rhode report admits, Stanford does not
have the necessary enforcement tools to
do so. However, California law-enforce
ment officials have legal powers far

beyond those available to Stanford, such
as the right to subpoena witnesses, to
conduct reasonable searches and
seizures and to threaten contempt or
perjury prosecutions. In addition, law
enforcement has at its disposal many
new and advanced technologies that can
make the difference in a close case.
Each one of these enforcement tools
may result in evidence that would con
vert a "swearing match" into a provable
case. The facts lead me to conclude not
that Stanford should change the burden
of proof for student cases, but rather
that Stanford is ill-equipped to prosecute
sexual assault cases.
The expressed purpose of the pro
posed changes is not to change the
results in particular cases, but instead to
improve the confidence in the Stanford
judicial system. In other words, the pro
posed changes are merely cosmetic. By
the time the victim realizes the deficien
cies of the Stanford system, the opportu
nity for obtaining and analyzing critical
physical evidence may have disappeared.

Instead of providing an effective
response, Stanford will be depriving sex
ual assault victims of their opportunity
for an effective criminal prosecution.
Far better for Stanford to show its
commitment to the victims by counsel
ing them, assisting them in reporting it
to the police, encouraging the police to
investigate fiilly and promptly, and sup
porting the victims throughout any
investigation and prosecution.
Far better for Stanford to make a
public commitment that anyone convict
ed of a sexual assault offense will be
automatically expelled. That would be a
real commitment and would send a mes
sage to victims far stronger than any
"perception of fairness."
If Stanford students are committing
crimes on campus, they should not be let
off with penalties like delaying gradua
tion — they should be prosecuted and
sent to jail. And only the District. Attor
ney can do that, not Stanford.
