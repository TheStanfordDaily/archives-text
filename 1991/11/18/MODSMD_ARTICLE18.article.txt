# Axe should be seen as sign of school spirit, not racism
## 
### 
Recently, the Stanford Athletic Market
ing Department had the brilliant idea of
distributing cardboard axes at Big Game
for Stanford fans to wave around while
yelling the traditional anti-Cal "axe cheer."
This initiative, sponsored by a large
corporation and given support by the
Department of Athletics, would have gen
erated much needed school spirit at Big
; Game. Unfortunately, it was vetoed by
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jackson
with the pretext that it was "offensive to
the Native American community."
What does the Axe, the long-time
symbol of rivalry between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley, have to do with Native
Amencan culture? Perhaps Jackson was
thinking of the recent World Series,

where decidedly un-PC fans painted
their faces, put feathers in their hair,
waved tomahawks and chanted.
However, we are not the Stanford
Braves, nor the Stanford Indians. The
idea behind the Axe is that with it, we
can chop down Cal's defenses, and in
doing so, win yet another Big Game —
and the Bears, in turn, share the same
philosophy with respect to us.
I do not see where the issue of racism
intrudes, since we are not pretending to be
an ethnic group, nor are we imitating one,
but rather are trying to cheer our team to
victory over Cal. We won't be signing war
chants, but yelling "give 'em the Axe!"
As a student who spent much of my
time at Stanford striving for the ideas

and ideals that compromise multicultur
alism, I am very saddened by Jackson's
routine abuse of the concept.
In misinterpreting ideas such as the
marketing department's, and in justify
ing his veto by making a needless associ
ation with another ethnic group, Jack
son is working against those who care
about promoting unity within diversity.
If the Axe had anything to do with
Native Americans, it would have been
banned, and rightfully so, when the
name "Indian" was.
I encourage all students and alumni
who read this to manufacture their own
Axes (not Tomahawks) and to bring
them to Big Game to support our
deserving football team. What little

school spirit Stanford has should not be
sacrificed for those who get so lost in
their rhetoric that they lose touch with
the goal of education, friendships and
athletic programs that transcend cultur
al boundaries.
