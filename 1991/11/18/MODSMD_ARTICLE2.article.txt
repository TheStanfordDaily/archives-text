# Appeal rekindles debate over indirect-cost dispute
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford and Paul Biddle are at it again.
Last week's indirect-cost appeal
renewed the verbal battles between
University officials and the outspoken
Biddle, the on-campus negotiator for the
Office of Naval Research.
Biddle reasserted that the University
overcharged the government by perhaps as
much as $500 million over the past decade,
and administrators attacked both Biddle's
credibility and his allegations.
Meanwhile, officials in Washington,
D.C., said Stanford's appeal to the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals would
not affect current negotiations. They also
promised to investigate Biddle's claims but
would not comment on their validity.

In Thursday's appeal, Stanford asked
the government to compensate the
University for its actual indirect costs for
1990-91 instead of at the 55.5-percent rate
made permanent in August.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
said Stanford's actual indirect-cost rate for
last year should have been about 71 per
cent and that reimbursement at a rate of
55.5 percent has resulted in a loss of more
than $20 million.
Norm Hanson, spokesman for the Office
of Naval Research in Washington, D.C.,
said Stanford's appeal "will not affect cur
rent negotiations. ... All they are doing is
suing to recover money they claim they
should have been paid last year."
