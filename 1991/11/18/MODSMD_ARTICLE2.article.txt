# Appeal rekindles debate over indirect-cost dispute
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford and Paul Biddle are at it again.
Last week's indirect-cost appeal
renewed the verbal battles between
University officials and the outspoken
Biddle, the on-campus negotiator for the
Office of Naval Research.
Biddle reasserted that the University
overcharged the government by perhaps as
much as $500 million over the past decade,
and administrators attacked both Biddle's
credibility and his allegations.
Meanwhile, officials in Washington,
D.C., said Stanford's appeal to the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals would
not affect current negotiations. They also
promised to investigate Biddle's claims but
would not comment on their validity.

In Thursday's appeal, Stanford asked
the government to compensate the
University for its actual indirect costs for
1990-91 instead of at the 55.5-percent rate
made permanent in August.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
said Stanford's actual indirect-cost rate for
last year should have been about 71 per
cent and that reimbursement at a rate of
55.5 percent has resulted in a loss of more
than $20 million.
Norm Hanson, spokesman for the Office
of Naval Research in Washington, D.C.,
said Stanford's appeal "will not affect cur
rent negotiations. ... All they are doing is
suing to recover money they claim they
should have been paid last year."
The House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations will also remain
unaffected by the appeal, according
to a subcommittee staff member.
The subcommittee — chaired
by the powerful Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. — previously sched
uled a hearing to update the indi
rect-cost controversy for Dec. 12,
and Stanford's appeal will not
change the hearing.
Scheduled to testify are repre
sentatives from various govern
ment agencies responsible for
indirect costs, and Stanford "will
come up" but will not be the main
focus as it was in the hearing last
March, the staff member said.
Biddle, whose original allega
tions that the University had
overcharged the government by
as much as $200 million in indi
rect costs over the past decade
prompted the subcommittee
investigations, increased his esti
mate several weeks ago to about
$500 million.
The original $200-million esti
mate was based upon Biddle's
belief that "cozy" memoranda of
understanding signed between
the University and the govern
ment were invalid. These MOUs
formed the basis for reimburse
ment of Stanford's indirect costs
during the 1980s.
Last April, the government
canceled nearly to 100 MOUs in
setting the University's indirect
cost recovery rate at 55.5 percent.
Biddle claims the MOUs should
be retroactively canceled for the
last 10 years, potentially requir
ing Stanford to forfeit almost
$200 million in previously recov
ered indirect costs.
Biddle said last week the Uni
versity's appeal was an attempt to
set a precedent and preserve the
MOUs for the 1980s.
Van Etten said there is "no cor
roboration of the the $200-million
figure" and that the University
has "no way of knowing where the
numbers are coming from."
The Office of Naval Research
has "only canceled the MOUs
from the beginning of the Univer
sity's fiscal year 1991 and the
future," Hanson said. "The gov
ernment is looking at the merit of
retroactive cancellation of the
MOUs, but I won't speculate as to
what might happen," he added.
Biddle's other claims revolve

around tuition remission and
equipment.
Tuition remission — the reim
bursement of a portion of the tuition
for graduate students involved in
government research through the
staff benefits pool — was the only
MOU not canceled last April.
The Office of Naval Research
extended the practice to tuition
remission through this year until a
study of the Office of Management
and Budget could be completed.
But Biddle alleges that the
practice should be revoked
because reimbursement through
the staff benefits pool is compen
sation and should be subject to
taxes. The approximately $180
million of staff benefits that apply
to tuition remission should be
returned to the government,
according to Biddle.
Van Etten defended the prac
tice because it is followed by four
other private research universi

ties. "I do not understand what
[Biddle's] concerns are when the
head of his own agency has put in
writing that the practice can con
tinue," he said.
The final $100-million allega
tion involves the transfer of own
ership of laboratory equipment
purchased with research grants
from the government to the Uni
versity.
Biddle claims the University
should pay sales tax on the equip
ment and that other universities
nationwide should have access to
the equipment.
But Van Etten said the practice
of transferring ownership is a part
of the "normal research process. I
know of no university that sends
its equipment back to the govern
ment or to another university.
Van Etten said that Biddle's
$480-million allegation "probably
exceeds what the government has
paid us over the last 10 years.

much as $500 million over the past decade,
and administrators attacked both Biddle's
credibility and his allegations.
Meanwhile, officials in Washington,
D.C., said Stanford's appeal to the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals would
not affect current negotiations. They also
promised to investigate Biddle's claims but
would not comment on their validity.

In Thursday's appeal, Stanford asked
the government to compensate the
University for its actual indirect costs for
1990-91 instead of at the 55.5-percent rate
made permanent in August.
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
said Stanford's actual indirect-cost rate for
last year should have been about 71 per
cent and that reimbursement at a rate of
55.5 percent has resulted in a loss of more
than $20 million.
Norm Hanson, spokesman for the Office
of Naval Research in Washington, D.C.,
said Stanford's appeal "will not affect cur
rent negotiations. ... All they are doing is
suing to recover money they claim they
should have been paid last year."
The House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations will also remain
unaffected by the appeal, according
to a subcommittee staff member.
The subcommittee — chaired
by the powerful Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich. — previously sched
uled a hearing to update the indi
rect-cost controversy for Dec. 12,
and Stanford's appeal will not
change the hearing.
Scheduled to testify are repre
sentatives from various govern
ment agencies responsible for
indirect costs, and Stanford "will
come up" but will not be the main
focus as it was in the hearing last
March, the staff member said.
Biddle, whose original allega
tions that the University had
overcharged the government by
as much as $200 million in indi
rect costs over the past decade
prompted the subcommittee
investigations, increased his esti
mate several weeks ago to about
$500 million.
The original $200-million esti
mate was based upon Biddle's
belief that "cozy" memoranda of
understanding signed between
the University and the govern
ment were invalid. These MOUs
formed the basis for reimburse
ment of Stanford's indirect costs
during the 1980s.
Last April, the government
canceled nearly to 100 MOUs in
setting the University's indirect
cost recovery rate at 55.5 percent.
Biddle claims the MOUs should
be retroactively canceled for the
last 10 years, potentially requir
ing Stanford to forfeit almost
$200 million in previously recov
ered indirect costs.
Biddle said last week the Uni
versity's appeal was an attempt to
set a precedent and preserve the
MOUs for the 1980s.
Van Etten said there is "no cor
roboration of the the $200-million
figure" and that the University
has "no way of knowing where the
numbers are coming from."
The Office of Naval Research
has "only canceled the MOUs
from the beginning of the Univer
sity's fiscal year 1991 and the
future," Hanson said. "The gov
ernment is looking at the merit of
retroactive cancellation of the
MOUs, but I won't speculate as to
what might happen," he added.
Biddle's other claims revolve

around tuition remission and
equipment.
Tuition remission — the reim
bursement of a portion of the tuition
for graduate students involved in
government research through the
staff benefits pool — was the only
MOU not canceled last April.
The Office of Naval Research
extended the practice to tuition
remission through this year until a
study of the Office of Management
and Budget could be completed.
But Biddle alleges that the
practice should be revoked
because reimbursement through
the staff benefits pool is compen
sation and should be subject to
taxes. The approximately $180
million of staff benefits that apply
to tuition remission should be
returned to the government,
according to Biddle.
Van Etten defended the prac
tice because it is followed by four
other private research universi

ties. "I do not understand what
[Biddle's] concerns are when the
head of his own agency has put in
writing that the practice can con
tinue," he said.
The final $100-million allega
tion involves the transfer of own
ership of laboratory equipment
purchased with research grants
from the government to the Uni
versity.
Biddle claims the University
should pay sales tax on the equip
ment and that other universities
nationwide should have access to
the equipment.
But Van Etten said the practice
of transferring ownership is a part
of the "normal research process. I
know of no university that sends
its equipment back to the govern
ment or to another university.
Van Etten said that Biddle's
$480-million allegation "probably
exceeds what the government has
paid us over the last 10 years.
