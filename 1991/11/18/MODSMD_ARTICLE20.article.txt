ASSU must recommit
to AIDS prevention by
funding CIC program
As described in the Nov. 14 article
"Concern about AIDS increases," Magic
Johnson's recent announcement that he
has contracted the HIV virus has created
increased concern about the HIV virus
and AIDS.
Although AIDS had reached epidemic
proportions long before Johnson's infec
tion with the virus, we hope that John
son's announcement and the ensuing
media coverage will adequately heighten
public awareness of the urgency of AIDS
education and prevention.
The Contraceptive Information Cen
ter's recent experience with the ASSU's
discretionary funding process indicated
that promoting AIDS awareness and
prevention of HIV transmission may not
be a sufficiently high priority on the
Stanford campus.
The ASSU typically provides the Con
traceptive Information Center with
approximately $800 per quarter for con

dom purchases alone. This quarter, that
amount was drastically reduced to $300.
Condoms are the best method, besides
abstinence, of preventing transmission
of the HIV virus.
The center gives approximately 5,000
free condoms per quarter to Stanford stu
dents. By giving free condoms to center vis
itors, we are providing an effective means
for students to prevent HIV transmission.
The ASSU's decision to reduce the
funding necessary to provide such a crucial
service sends a strong message to the Stan
ford community that members are not
committed to promoting AIDS prevention.

Financial aid in bind
due to planned budget
cuts in student grants
As we all know, Stanford faces a bud
get shortfall of $43 million. Recent ral
lies and public forums and letters to The
Daily have expressed growing concerns

over where the budget ax will fall.
This admirable display of community
concern must be deepened and strength
ened in the difficult months to come.
We, the members of the Financial Aid
Advocacy Office, write to express a grow
ing sense of alarm over proposed cuts in
the financial aid programs which keep
many of us in school.
Stanford proposed to cut the Financial
Aid Office budget by $2.5 million. These
cuts could lead to a 10 percent overall
reduction of University grants to under
graduates. University President Donald
Kennedy and Provost James Rosse also
propose including the income of non-cus
todial parents of students when deter
mining financial need. Stanford sources
represent about 40 percent of total stu
dent-aid budget, and 63 percent of stu
dents rely to some extent on these funds.
As much as we students may want to
deny the somewhat daunting responsi
bility of organizing a campaign to pro
tect our interests, it is imperative that
we convey the disastrous effects cutting
financial aid would have on the diversity
of the student body and ultimately on
the legitimacy of the University itself.
If Stanford decides to cut 10 percent

of the grants and includes the income of
non-custodial parents of students when
determining financial need, any true
commitment to economic diversity will
be threatened.

Is discussion of books
in CIV valuable if
content gets ignored?
I remember Western Culture. Great
Works, I read, is much the same. Four
hours a week you sit around with eigh
teen other freshman and you talk about
a book. A grown-up is paid to supervise
and take roll. Some of you have even
read the book.
The grown-up is not an expert on
every book you read. Most grown-ups
are rather sanguine about their igno
rance. "The process of encountering the
books is more important than the actual
content of the books," said one, adding
that the books are merely used to make
the students "learn how to think."
After some time, though, I began to

wonder, have the grown-ups really learned
how to think, or have they just learned how
to keep a discussion going for two hours?
In fact, it's so tough that grown-ups
sometimes even give up and look for a gen
der issue instead. How's this: "A woman is
a misbegotten man," writes Thomas.
There, that should keep them talking for
awhile. Don't know a whole lot about Islam
either? Don't worry, it works there, too.
Just do a "close reading" of the pas
sage on clitoral circumcision; it's sure to
get a rise out of someone. So we affirm
the dignity of those guy chauvinists back
then. And isn't it amazing how they ever
found anything to talk about before they
invented gender issues?
Have we really learned how to think, or
have we just learned the appropriate
responses to racism, sexism, homophobia
and religion? Does that really take three
whole quarters? Is "the process of encoun
tering the books" really "more important
than the actual content of the works"?
If so, then why the fuss about diversi
ty? Is there anything worth thinking
about? Or is Great Works just a glorified
encounter group left over from the '70s?
