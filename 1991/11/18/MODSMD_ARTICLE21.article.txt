for the first time since its 1986
appearance in the Gator Bowl.
Following weeks of anticipation
and rampant speculation, the
official announcement was made
yesterday at noon: Stanford will
face defending co-national cham
pion Georgia Tech in the Aloha
Bowl on December 25.
As the Cardinal notched its
sixth consecutive victory, there
was a sense of history in the mak
ing. Finally, Stanford (7-3 overall
and 5-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) is showing signs of the bril
liance that has marked its foot
ball past.
Coach Denny Green has a
good sense of the tradition his
team is following. In the mid
1930's, the Cardinal was known
as the Vow Boys, because a pact
to never lose to USC was made
and kept. In 1940 it was the Wow
Boys, led by the legendary
Frankie Albert, who introduced
the T-formation to football and

beat Nebraska 21-13 in the Rose
Bowl.
In 1991, the team has been
dubbed the Now Boys. "The atti
tude is that now is our time,"
senior wide receiver Chris Walsh
explained. "We have all of the
talent at every position, and now
is the time for us to show what
we can do."
Green agreed. "We made up
our minds that 1991 was going to
be the year that we re-established
and came up with our own style
of Stanford football. We call it
big-time football, Stanford
style."
It took the Cardinal a little
time to get into the big-time
groove on Saturday, however.
Stanford's first possession of the
game ended in a sack of sopho
more quarterback Steve Sten
strom, and the second drive of
the game came to a halt when a
Stanford fumble on the Cougars'
7-yard line was recovered and
converted into 7 points eight
plays later.
The quarter ended with Wash
ington State ahead 7-0 and the
Cardinal looking as cold as the
41-degree air. Almost immediate
ly, however, the momentum
began to swing the other way.
An 80-yard drive was sus
tained on the fuel of two third
down conversions by senior full
back Tommy Vardell and strong
running by junior Glyn Milburn.
The effort culminated in a 9-yard
toss by Stenstrom to Milburn,
