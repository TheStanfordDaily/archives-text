for the first time since its 1986
appearance in the Gator Bowl.
Following weeks of anticipation
and rampant speculation, the
official announcement was made
yesterday at noon: Stanford will
face defending co-national cham
pion Georgia Tech in the Aloha
Bowl on December 25.
As the Cardinal notched its
sixth consecutive victory, there
was a sense of history in the mak
ing. Finally, Stanford (7-3 overall
and 5-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) is showing signs of the bril
liance that has marked its foot
ball past.
Coach Denny Green has a
good sense of the tradition his
team is following. In the mid
1930's, the Cardinal was known
as the Vow Boys, because a pact
to never lose to USC was made
and kept. In 1940 it was the Wow
Boys, led by the legendary
Frankie Albert, who introduced
the T-formation to football and

beat Nebraska 21-13 in the Rose
Bowl.
In 1991, the team has been
dubbed the Now Boys. "The atti
tude is that now is our time,"
senior wide receiver Chris Walsh
explained. "We have all of the
talent at every position, and now
is the time for us to show what
we can do."
Green agreed. "We made up
our minds that 1991 was going to
be the year that we re-established
and came up with our own style
of Stanford football. We call it
big-time football, Stanford
style."
It took the Cardinal a little
time to get into the big-time
groove on Saturday, however.
Stanford's first possession of the
game ended in a sack of sopho
more quarterback Steve Sten
strom, and the second drive of
the game came to a halt when a
Stanford fumble on the Cougars'
7-yard line was recovered and
converted into 7 points eight
plays later.
The quarter ended with Wash
ington State ahead 7-0 and the
Cardinal looking as cold as the
41-degree air. Almost immediate
ly, however, the momentum
began to swing the other way.
An 80-yard drive was sus
tained on the fuel of two third
down conversions by senior full
back Tommy Vardell and strong
running by junior Glyn Milburn.
The effort culminated in a 9-yard
toss by Stenstrom to Milburn,

who glided into the end zone
untouched.
The Cardinal then embarked
on a scoring frenzy that racked up
28 points in the next 8:27 of the
game. Senior defensive tackle
Estevan Avila began the
turnaround with 10:00 left in the
half by sacking Cougar quarter
back Drew Bledsoe on his own 24-
yard line for a loss of 9, giving the
Cardinal excellent field position
on its next possession.
Starting from the Cougars' 45,
Stenstrom threw deep for Jon
Pinckney, but saw the ball land in
the outstretched hands of Cougar
cornerback Michael Wright
instead. As Washington State
took over at their own 8-yard line,
it was up to the Cardinal defense
to make something happen once
again.
This time it was junior free
safety Seyon Albert who came up
with the play, knocking the ball
away from Bledsoe and diving on
it in the end zone to put the Car
dinal up 14-7.
Just two downs later, Cougar
running back Shaumbe Wright-
Fair was stripped of the ball by
sophomore nose guard Jason
Fisk. Albert Richardson, last
week's National Defensive Player
of the Week, recovered the fum
ble. Four plays and 64 yards later,
Vardell went over the top from
the 1 for the touchdown, pushing
the score to 21-7.
On Washington State's next
attempt to piece together a drive
junior cornerback Darrien Gor
don picked a misdirected Bledsoe

pass out of the air on the Cougars'
42-yard line and ran it back all
the way for yet another Cardinal
touchdown. The final score of the
quarter came off a 14-yard run by
Milburn with 2:26 left.
The Cardinal entered the lock
er room at the half with a com
fortable 35-7 lead. In less than
one quarter, a tense game had
turned into a rout, and not even a
biting 20 m p h wind could chill
the Cardinal's performance.
"If we didn't win today, we
knew that what we'd done so far
wouldn't mean much," Albert
said. "It's good to know that we
could come through when it
counted."
Offensively, Vardell was
impressive with 22 carries, 140
total yards, and two touchdowns.
The latter earned him the Stan
ford records for the most touch
downs and the most points scored
in one season, with 17 and 102,
respectively.
"Tommy's the heart and soul
of our team," Milburn said. "He
does so many things both with
and without the ball that you
can't help but just step back in
awe. I know when he gets the ball,
things are going to happen."
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom
also stretched his career record to
6-0, completing 15 of 17 passes
for 188 yards and two touch
downs. Stenstrom is currently
ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10 for
pass efficiency.
"For the past four years I've
been sitting at home (watching
the bowl games), and saying 'We
should be there,' or 'We could
beat that team,'" Richardson
said. "Now we finally have our
chance."
ALOHA!
