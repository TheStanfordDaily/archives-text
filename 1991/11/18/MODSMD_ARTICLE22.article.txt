# Harriers run well at district champs

Call it a case of having your
hands tied behind your back.
The Cardinal men's cross
country team, $ftgr placing a
strong fifth in Saturday's
NCAA District-8 Champi
onships and vaulting into the
top 20, will probably find itself
sitting at home when the 24-
team NCAA Championship
meet takes place on November
25.
Stanford, who needed a
third-place finish in the 15-
team meet to clinch at least an
at-large berth in the NCAA
final, wound up with 129
points, well behind Arizona's
58, Washington's 65, and
Washington State's 94.
"There will be teams that
we have beaten this season
that will be champions of other
districts," Chisam said, "but
we have nothing to complain
about — we ran our best race
and we got beaten fair and
square."
Indeed, Stanford's top five
runners all earned personal
bests on Saturday, with sopho
more Gary Stolz leading the

pack with a tenth-place finish
and a 30:52 mark over the 10K
course at Fresno's Woodward
Park.
"In the West, you've got to
be better than good and we
knew that going in, but we had
an excellent season and most
of the team, including Stolz,
will be back," Chisam said.
In the 5,000-meter
Women's District-8 Champi
onships, also held at Wood
ward Park, the Cardinal placed
eighth among 17 teams pre
sent with 234 points, well
behind NCAA qualifiers Ore
gon (56 points) and Arizona
(60). Paced by sophomore
Sarah Truitt, who ran a 33rd
place 18:15, and freshman
Angie Inge (18:23), the young
Stanford squad provided hope
for 1992 and beyond.
"All seven women were run
ning in their first District 8
meet," said Chisam, "This
puts them in an excellent posi
tion to work toward an NCAA
berth next year."
Unfortunately for both Car
dinal cross-country squads,
next year is all that remains
after a breakthrough 1991
campaign.
