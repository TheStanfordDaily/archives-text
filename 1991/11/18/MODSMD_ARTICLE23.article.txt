It seems that this past week
was not meant to be a kind one for
the Cardinal's postseason. As one
of the three Stanford sports teams
that competed and lost in NCAAs

Cardinal 0
Hawkeyes 5

in the past five days, the No. 20
field hockey team fell to No. 4
Iowa 5-0 last Thursday in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal faced a tough
task in taking on Iowa. The
Hawkeyes were 16-1-1 coming
into the match, and could smell a
possible national championship.
The Card, on the other hand,
while head and shoulders above
any other team west of the Missis
sippi, is continuing on its quest to
be considered among the elite in
field hockey. Every season that
passes shows Stanford more able
to compete with the Marylands,
with the James Madisons, and
with the Iowas.
But this year found the Cardi
nal squad against a very good
Iowa team. Hawkeyes Jamie

Rofrano (two goals and three
assists), Heather Bryant (two
goals), Lisa Sweeney (one goal
and two assists), led lowa to the
win. Overall, Stanford was out
shot 24-6, and lowa had 10 penal
ty corners to Stanford's four. The
five goals against Stanford were
more than any team had scored
on the Cardinal this season.
"We played them tough.
[lowa's] coach was really worried
at the beginning, but they
remained very intense the entire
game," said sophomore forward
Sara Hallock, who had five of
Stanford's six shots on goal.
"We'll get them next year."
But the end of this year's sea
son sees the departure of some
great players. Seniors Erin
Mc√üride, Lara Filson, Laura
Romeu, Kristina Puryear, Susan
Leckrone, Kristina Vidal, and
Michele Beynet can surely all be
proud of a successful season and
the continuation of what is hope
fully becoming a Stanford tradi
tion in this, the second straight
year of a No. 1 Northern Pacific
Conference finish and NCAA
qualification for Stanford, and the
fifth in seven years.
And next year, with the return
of such players as Hallock, Tina
Syer, Gina Bianchini, and phe
nom Chris Trevino, Stanford no
doubt has great things in store.
