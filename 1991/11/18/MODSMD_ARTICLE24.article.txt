# Card loses triple-overtime heartbreaker

### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
"They're a great team, and we had to play
a hell of a game to beat them. I don't think
it can get any tougher than this."
This is what Annie Hull, who abruptly
ended the Cardinal women's soccer season
on Saturday by scoring the lone goal in Col
orado College's 1-0, triple-overtime victory
over Stanford, had to say about/the Tiger-
Cardinal match. ~ T "
The No. 2 Tigers finally broke a scoreless
deadlock with No. 5 Stanford with 5:08
remaining in the third overtime period as
Hull put the ball in from point-blank range
after a scramble in front of the Cardinal
goal. The goal ended the first women's sud
den-death match in NCAA history.
"It was a cross from the right side," Hull
recalled after the game. "It hit a Stanford
player. . .Traci Holbrook was on the right
side of the goal, and I was on the left. Traci
deflected it off her toe and it came right to

me. (Card keeper Leslie Garrard) had gone
out towards Traci and she couldn't get back
in time."
The terrible playing conditions couldn't
have helped Garrard on the play, as snow that
fell throughout the weekend left the field wet
and slippery.
"It's unfortunate that the game had to be
played under these conditions," Tiger goal
keeper Kris Zeits said. "I feel that the game
would have been a lot different if we had
played the game on grass."
It seemed as though neither team would
ever permit itself to lose, as remarkable play
in goal by Garrard and Zeits kept the game
going for over two hours.
The subfreezing temperatures failed to

numb the Cardinal attack, as Stanford
endured the cold and snow to outshoot the
Tigers 21-16. Unfortunately, Zeits, who
had 11 saves on the afternoon, had a
career day in goal despite what she felt
were particularly harsh conditions for
goalkeepers.
"It was a tough game because of the con
ditions, especially for the keepers," Zeits
said. "The ball seemed to pick up speed as it
hit the ground, and the ball was very hard to
hold on to.*
Both goalkeepers rose to the occasion,
however, as 36 shots by both teams were
turned away until Hull's.
"It was a game we'll remember for a long
time, and not only because of the conditions,"
Hull said. "Stanford kept up with us, even
with the altitude, so you have to give them
credit."
Stanford's loss put their final season
record at 17-2. The Tigers, also 17-2, will go
on to play the University of Wisconsin at an
undetermined site next weekend.
