# Broncos take Card out of NCAAs in two overtimes
## 
### Brian Egan Staff writer 
When it was all over, when the mob of
Santa Clara fans charged the field after the
Broncos' 2-1 sudden death victory over
Stanford in the first round of the NCAA
Men's Soccer Tournament, the several
hundred frozen Cardinal fans gathered at
Buck Shaw Stadium stood together in
stunned silence.

Then, slowly at first, a smattering of cheers
and applause rang out from the Stanford
faithful, not merely for the effort put forth by
the Cardinal that night, but as acknowledge
ment of an exciting season as well.
Santa Clara (17-1-1), who came in
ranked second in one poll and sixth in the
other, had a lot to prove after suffering a 1-
1 tie to an unranked Cardinal team on Oct.
18. If they proved anything last night, it
was that Stanford (12-4-5) has elevated
itself to the ranks of the elite Western soc
cer powers.
The game was a completely different con
test than the one played by these schools
last month. While that first match was a
hectic, topsy-turvy game characterized by
constant downfield movement, the story of
this weekend's game was ball control.
"I thought that both sides played much
better the second time around," said Cardi
nal forward Jim Talluto. "Both teams
played with a lot more composure [on Fri
day 1."
This composure made itself felt through
out the entire 90 minutes of regulation.
Thanks to solid defense on both sides, nei
ther Stanford nor Santa Clara could man
age more than a few real scoring threats in
regulation, none of which were converted.
Neither team came close to scoring in
the first of two 15-minute overtime periods,
either. However, things began to open up in
the second overtime.
With less than six minutes remaining on
the clock, forward Ryan Collins broke free

for what seemed to be a definite Stanford
goal. The freshman was grabbed and pulled
down by Bronco fullback Cameron Rast
just outside of the penalty box.
On the ensuing direct kick, Talluto
drilled a perfect shot, bending it around a
wall of Santa Clara defenders and into the
upper right corner of the net. With 5:46
remaining, the Cardinal had the lead and a
tremendous surge of momentum.
Unfortunately, there is a huge difference
between getting a lead and holding a lead.
After going scoreless for almost two hours,
the Broncos tied the game less than a
minute after Stanford scored its first goal.
Forward Matt Arya placed a direct kick from
the far left side of the field into the mouth of
the Stanford goal and Alberto Cruz booted
the ball into the right corner of the net.
"It's pretty much been the story of our
season," said Stanford midfielder Randy
Mann. "We haven't been able to hold onto
our leads."
While the second overtime ended in a 1-
1 deadlock, the game seemed to be in the
hands of Santa Clara. The Cardinal did not
mount a serious scoring threat after the
game-tying goal. Three minutes into the
second and final sudden death overtime
period, 137 minutes into the game, the
Broncos' Trevor Kelly dribbled through the
Stanford defense, setting up teammate
Craig Hampton with an unobstructed shot
from about 10 yards out. Hampton blasted
the ball into the net and the partisan crowd
of over 3,000 fans spilled onto the field.
Was Stanford disappointed by the loss?
Of course. Does it signal the death of Cardi
nal men's soccer? Far from it. "We have
nothing to be ashamed of," Talluto said.
"We held the No. 2 team in the country
scoreless for 115 minutes . . .1 thought that
we played real well."
If anything, the loss will serve as a warn
ing signal for Western teams next season.
Six of Stanford's top seven scorers, and ten
starters overall, are underclassmen. "We've
already started talking about next season,"
Talluto said. "We've got to work hard in the
offseason, but our goal next year is to be the
number one team in the West."
A year ago, such talk would have been
considered a joke. After their exciting and
impressive 1991 season, however, no one is
laughing at the Cardinal anymore.
