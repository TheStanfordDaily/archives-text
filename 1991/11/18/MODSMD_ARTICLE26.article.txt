Cardinal 7-13
Tigers 6, Bulldogs 9

Saturday in Stockton, the Cardinal squeaked
past of Pacific by a score of 7-6, and yesterday
afternoon Stanford cruised past Fresno State 13-9.
After several tough and emotional weekends,
the Cardinal finally got a chance to relax a little
over the weekend, but the team almost relaxed a
little too much. As coach Dante Dettamanti said,
"this was kind of a break for our team, and every
one seemed to take one."
Against Pacific, Stanford almost saw its tour
nament hopes end, but sophomore Brian demons'
goal on a 6-on-5 advantage with four minutes left
in the game kept the Cardinal's dreams alive.
The winning play was set up during a time-out,
and it had Frank Schneider, one of the inside post
players, go in motion and toward the outside.
When the defender followed him, Clemons was left
wide open for the shot, and he converted.
Goalkeeper Larry Bercutt was a key reason
Pacific could not score, as he thwarted several close
chances down the stretch.
As Dettamanti said, "Bercutt really kept us in
the game. He played a great game and stopped just
about everything. They took some good shots, but
he just stopped them."
Against Fresno State yesterday, seven different
Cardinal players scored, and the team had rela
tively little trouble defeating the Bulldogs. At the
end of the first quarter, the score was tied at four,
but after that, Stanford took over.
With about 20 seconds left in the game, the Car
dinal was up 13-7, before Fresno scored to make
the game seem a bit closer than it was. Sophomore
Antonio Busquets and Schneider each had three
goals to lead the team, while Chip Blankenhorn
and Fresno native Chris Wallin contributed two
apiece.
