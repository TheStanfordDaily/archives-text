In their last meet of the sea
*-Bon, the Stanford men's and
vwomen's golf teams produced
<Bome surprising results, sending
• a message to the national compe
tition that the Cardinal is a force
I; to be reckoned with in collegiate
J; golf.
•' Senior Adele Moore won her
; first tournament of the year,
£ eclipsing the top-notch field at the
Golf World Collegiate as well as
overcoming the inclement weath
'• er conditions and one of the diffi
, cult championship courses of
> Hilton Head, South Carolina.
The Stanford women placed
• .'two competitors in the top five
/ individual final standings, with
Audrey Wooding coming in fifth
; *for the Cardinal, amidst a tough
> field of top-ranked teams.
;" It was the men, however, who
pulled off a miracle this weekend,
; finally capitalizing on the talents
of the four scoring players to not
only sneak into the top 10, but to
finish sixth as a team overall.
;» Christian Cevaer had an out
" standing tournament, playing up
to his potential and finishing in
.third place overall to lead Stan
ford.
"Christian appeared two weeks
ago to get back to really making
solid contact with the ball. This
weekend he re-established him
self. He's back on his game," said
men's coach Wally Goodwin.
Goodwin was hoping for a top
ten finish by the Cardinal, and
the men gave him one, with a few
- places to spare.
"I'm really tickled ... to go
back there, to play with the best
teams and to do so well is
thrilling," Goodwin said.
The men's team started
strong, ending the first round of
competition in eighth place. Both
Notah Begay and Cevaer placed in
the top five, with Begay shooting
68, leaving him in a tie for second,
and Cevaer in a tie for fourth with
69 strokes.
The Cardinal moved up on the
; second day, finishing in sixth,
- with Begay leading Stanford in
fourth after shooting 72.
T Begay faltered on the last day
r> however, shooting a 78. Cevaer
; • shot a7l on the final day to keep
:.-him in the high standings.

"Notah's a little bit of a gam
bler, and I like that, but the wind
caught up to him (on the last
day)," Goodwin said.
The women's team started off
strong in the first round of com
petition, ending the day in fourth
place. Moore finished on Friday in
second place after shooting an
even par 72, with Wooding shoot
ing 76, good for 10th place.
The remaining three players
would hold the key to the Cardi
nal's success in the team stand
ings, as Moore and Wooding con
sistently stayed in the top ten.
In the first round, freshman
Jamille Jose placed third for
Stanford, shooting a 79 which put
her in 26th place. Freshman Amy
Lawrence shot an 82 for 39th
place, with Martha Richards close
behind in 43rd place shooting 83.
Unfortunately, the crucial
three players faltered on the sec
ond day of the tourney, as the
Cardinal slipped to seventh place,
with a 317 team total as com
pared to the first day's 309.
"We're not getting any produc
tivity out of our two players or
Martha," Baldwin said after the
disappointing second round," it's
really important for them to come
through. They will in the future."
Both Moore and Wooding shot
77's in the second round, putting
them in fifth and 14th place indi
vidually as the Cardinal dropped a
few notches in the competition.
Fortunately, the Cardinal
rebounded on the third day, end
ing up in fifth place overall.
Moore turned in a fabulous
round of golf to lead Stanford,
shooting a 73 under wet and
windy conditions. Moore edged
out Sofi Eriksson of Tulsa by one
stroke for the individual title.
Wooding also excelled in the
last round, shooting 74, vaulting
her back into the top 10, at fifth.
Both Wooding and Moore made
the all-tournament team.
"Adele and Audrey were fabu
lous. This was a primo tourna
ment. Those two are right on
track for being first-team Ail-
Americans," Baldwin said.
Jose shot a 79, with Lawrence
and Richards both shooting 82's
to finish up the fall season.
"I expect to see a productive
second half of the season from
Jamille, Amy, and Martha," Bald
win said optimistically.
