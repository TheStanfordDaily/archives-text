## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Now there can be no question.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team erased any doubts
about the legitimacy of its No. 1
ranking this weekend as it
stomped UCLA and USC at
Maples Pavilion and clinched the
Pacific 10 Conference title for
the first time since 1987.

Women's volleyball

Cardinal over Bruins
15-2, 15-1, 9-15, 15-8
Cardinal over Trojans
15-11, 15 8, 15-3

The Cardinal hammered the
No. 5 Bruins, 15-2, 15-1, 9-15,
15-8 on Friday night and went
on to defeat the No. 12 Trojans
15-11, 15-8, 15-13 on Saturday
to win the Pac-10 title for only
the second time in school histo
ry. Stanford is now 25-0, 16-0 in
the Pac-10.
Before a record-setting crowd
of 7,253 screaming fans Stan
ford slaughtered UCLA, the
defending national champions.
The Cardinal used sensational
serving to take the Bruins com
pletely out of their offense for
games one and two. Stanford
dominated in every aspect of the
match, and despite a letdown in
the third game, the Cardinal
showed that it is clearly the bet
ter team.
"We were doing everything
right," senior hitter Nicole
Appleman said.
"Everybody just did their
job," coach Don Shaw said.
In the first two games the
Bruins couldn't do much of any
thing. Stanford jumped all over
UCLA from the very start and
never let up. The Cardinal was
blocking and digging almost
every ball that the Lady Bruins
sent over, then firing blistering
spikes back across the net that
UCLA couldn't handle.
In game two Stanford almost
achieved the unthinkable —
bageling the mighty Bruins. At

7-0 UCLA got a sideout on an
Elaine Youngs' kill and threat
ened to end the shutout, but
then the Cardinal showed why it
is No. 1. The Bruins dug a Jen
nifer Jackson spike and set their
go-to hitter, Natalie Williams.
Williams pounded the ball, but
Kristin Klein made a diving,
spectacular dig that she had no
business corralling, sending the
ball to setter Carrie Feldman.
Feldman promptly quick-set Bev
Oden for an earth-shaking,
thunderous kill that brought the
entire crowd to its feet chanting,
"Bagel! Bagel!"
No matter what great play the
Bruins could make, the Stanford
players had an answer. Junior
Laurie Sawin (sporting a red and
white face-mask to protect her
broken nose, artwork courtesy of
Kristi Paaso), Klein and Oden all
made amazing defensive plays to
keep the ball alive, and the pow
erful Stanford hitters did the
rest.
"[UCLA] got some good
swings, but we wouldn't let them
put it down," Jackson said.
The Bruins avoided the
shutout with a Youngs kill and
came out a different team in
game three as Williams and
Youngs got on track and the Car
dinal's passing broke down
somewhat.
"In the third game they were
just doing anything they could to
win," Feldman said.
But Stanford came back in
game four and crushed UCLA to
win the match.
"We came in and won the
fourth game playing the way we
should have played in the third,"
Sawin said.
The Cardinal players were
playing like gangbusters, as
Klein had another 19 kills to
become Stanford's all-time kill
leader. She also had a team-high
20 digs. Oden added 17 kills, and
senior Amy Cooper pounded
down 12 kills, had 7 blocks, and
had a .458 hitting percentage.
Throughout the match the
near-capacity crowd hollered
and screamed themselves
hoarse, and the players appreci
ated the support.

Cardinal demolished a supposedly deadly duo of Southern Cali
fornia teams this weekend.
"[We had] such the homecourt
advantage," Appleman said. "The
crowd was amazing. It helped to
keep the momentum going."
Coach Shaw feared a letdown
against USC the next night after
such an emotional victory, and he
was right. Stanford came out flat
and never could shake the pesky
Trojans. Both teams played well
in streaks, but the Cardinal made
the plays and came out on top to
secure the Pac-10 title.
Stanford was happy to win, but

everyone seemed frustrated with
their level of play.
"We were just a step slow,"
Shaw said. "USC did a good job —
they made us look bad in some
places. We just weren't quite
doing it."
"We all came out wanting to
win," Feldman said. "I think we
expected them to make the mis
takes, but they made us work for
it. Give them credit. Their
defense was good."
Appleman, Klein, and Cooper
played their last regular-season
home match Saturday night. The
Cardinal travels to Arizona next
weekend to finish out the confer
ence season.

home match Saturday night. The
Cardinal travels to Arizona next
weekend to finish out the confer
ence season.
Now there can be no question.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team erased any doubts
about the legitimacy of its No. 1
ranking this weekend as it
stomped UCLA and USC at
Maples Pavilion and clinched the
Pacific 10 Conference title for
the first time since 1987.

Cardinal over Bruins
15-2, 15-1, 9-15, 15-8
Cardinal over Trojans
15-11, 15 8, 15-3

The Cardinal hammered the
No. 5 Bruins, 15-2, 15-1, 9-15,
15-8 on Friday night and went
on to defeat the No. 12 Trojans
15-11, 15-8, 15-13 on Saturday
to win the Pac-10 title for only
the second time in school histo
ry. Stanford is now 25-0, 16-0 in
the Pac-10.
Before a record-setting crowd
of 7,253 screaming fans Stan
ford slaughtered UCLA, the
defending national champions.
The Cardinal used sensational
serving to take the Bruins com
pletely out of their offense for
games one and two. Stanford
dominated in every aspect of the
match, and despite a letdown in
the third game, the Cardinal
showed that it is clearly the bet
ter team.
"We were doing everything
right," senior hitter Nicole
Appleman said.
"Everybody just did their
job," coach Don Shaw said.
In the first two games the
Bruins couldn't do much of any
thing. Stanford jumped all over
UCLA from the very start and
never let up. The Cardinal was
blocking and digging almost
every ball that the Lady Bruins
sent over, then firing blistering
spikes back across the net that
UCLA couldn't handle.
In game two Stanford almost
achieved the unthinkable —
bageling the mighty Bruins. At

7-0 UCLA got a sideout on an
Elaine Youngs' kill and threat
ened to end the shutout, but
then the Cardinal showed why it
is No. 1. The Bruins dug a Jen
nifer Jackson spike and set their
go-to hitter, Natalie Williams.
Williams pounded the ball, but
Kristin Klein made a diving,
spectacular dig that she had no
business corralling, sending the
ball to setter Carrie Feldman.
Feldman promptly quick-set Bev
Oden for an earth-shaking,
thunderous kill that brought the
entire crowd to its feet chanting,
"Bagel! Bagel!"
No matter what great play the
Bruins could make, the Stanford
players had an answer. Junior
Laurie Sawin (sporting a red and
white face-mask to protect her
broken nose, artwork courtesy of
Kristi Paaso), Klein and Oden all
made amazing defensive plays to
keep the ball alive, and the pow
erful Stanford hitters did the
rest.
"[UCLA] got some good
swings, but we wouldn't let them
put it down," Jackson said.
The Bruins avoided the
shutout with a Youngs kill and
came out a different team in
game three as Williams and
Youngs got on track and the Car
dinal's passing broke down
somewhat.
"In the third game they were
just doing anything they could to
win," Feldman said.
But Stanford came back in
game four and crushed UCLA to
win the match.
"We came in and won the
fourth game playing the way we
should have played in the third,"
Sawin said.
The Cardinal players were
playing like gangbusters, as
Klein had another 19 kills to
become Stanford's all-time kill
leader. She also had a team-high
20 digs. Oden added 17 kills, and
senior Amy Cooper pounded
down 12 kills, had 7 blocks, and
had a .458 hitting percentage.
Throughout the match the
near-capacity crowd hollered
and screamed themselves
hoarse, and the players appreci
ated the support.

Bev Oden spikes one down the throat of an unlucky defender. The
Cardinal demolished a supposedly deadly duo of Southern Cali
fornia teams this weekend.
"[We had] such the homecourt
advantage," Appleman said. "The
crowd was amazing. It helped to
keep the momentum going."
Coach Shaw feared a letdown
against USC the next night after
such an emotional victory, and he
was right. Stanford came out flat
and never could shake the pesky
Trojans. Both teams played well
in streaks, but the Cardinal made
the plays and came out on top to
secure the Pac-10 title.
Stanford was happy to win, but

everyone seemed frustrated with
their level of play.
"We were just a step slow,"
Shaw said. "USC did a good job —
they made us look bad in some
places. We just weren't quite
doing it."
"We all came out wanting to
win," Feldman said. "I think we
expected them to make the mis
takes, but they made us work for
it. Give them credit. Their
defense was good."
Appleman, Klein, and Cooper
played their last regular-season
home match Saturday night. The
Cardinal travels to Arizona next
weekend to finish out the confer
ence season.
