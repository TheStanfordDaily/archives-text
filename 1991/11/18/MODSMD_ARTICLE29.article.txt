Visions of what is to come appeared on the
floor of Maples Pavilion Saturday afternoon.
Although still ironing out the early-season
mistakes and fallacies of youth, the Stanford
basketball team showed a lot of promise in
its 86-75 exhibition game victory over
Brandt Hagen Germany.

After exchanging gifts in a gesture of
goodwill, the teams remained tied for much
of the opening twenty minutes, trading bas
ket after basket. Aside from the stars of each
team, Stanford's Adam Keefe and Brandt
Hagen's Keith "Mister" Jennings, it was
simply the case of sloppy basketball on the
Maples Pavilion hardwood. Keefe scored 17
points and grabbed 10 rebounds for a first
half double-double. Meanwhile, Jennings
scorched the nets for 15 points on 6-for-7
shooting, including 3-for-3 from three-point
range.
The deadlock in the first half was broken
with a 6-0 Stanford run just before the half.
A tip-in by Brent Williams was followed by
jumpers from guard Kenny Hicks and Keefe.
Then, to seal the momentum swing, Hicks
swatted a shot by Michael Brenken at the
buzzer, and the Cardinal went into the lock
er room up 41-35.
Stanford gradually increased its lead after
the intermission, opening the game up to an
18-point margin. A bright spot for the Cardi
nal was the play of reserve forward Paul Gar
rett, who replaced starter Jim Morgan, giving
the Cardinal a quicker squad on the floor.
"Paul has good skills. (He) passes it pret
ty well, and he's going to have a fine year and
do a good job for us," Montgomery said.
Brandt Hagen started eating away at the
Cardinal's lead with four and a half minutes
to play after Adam Fielder sank a three point
er and was fouled after the shot by Williams.
He made both ends of the ensuing one-and
one to cap off a five-point play. But Stanford
responded, with Keefe throwing an alley-oop
pass to Williams, who slammed it home.
Brandt Hagen then installed a full-court
press, which the Cardinal broke easily. After
crossing halfcourt, Brandt went into a trap
ping zone and got burned by it. Williams cut
through two defenders in mid air to sky for a
lay-in to extend the lead to double-figures,
and the Cardinal never looked back, winning
by 11.
