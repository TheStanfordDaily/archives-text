# Jewish Studies Program thrives despite obstacles
## 
### David Bianco Senior staff writer 
In the past two years, the Program in
Jewish Studies at Stanford has grown from
three professors to eight. More courses in
Jewish history, culture and religion are
being offered than ever before at Stanford.
Yet no undergraduates have declared
majors in Jewish studies, nor have any cho
sen to participate in its year-old honors
program. And the eight professors are
working with only 10 Jewish studies grad
uate students.
In a year when other interdisciplinary
programs are facing cuts and even elimina
tion, why has Jewish Studies come out of
nowhere to become what its director says is
already one of the finest such programs in

the country?
For one thing, several professors said
they ieel the new program fills a void that
has existed at Stanford for a long time.
"Jewish studies was never represented very
well at this university and elsewhere," accord
ing to Religious Studies Asst. Prof. Howard
Eilberg-Schwartz, who teaches ancient
Judaism and the anthropology of religion.
History Visiting Prof. Steven Zipperstein,
who serves as the program's director, said
that in the past there has been a
"widespread impression that Stanford
wasn't a great place for Jews â€” that the
number (admitted) was held in check.
"I think the University wanted to end all
that in a very big way, and it did."
