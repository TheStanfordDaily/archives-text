# Jewish Studies Program thrives despite obstacles
## 
### David Bianco Senior staff writer 
In the past two years, the Program in
Jewish Studies at Stanford has grown from
three professors to eight. More courses in
Jewish history, culture and religion are
being offered than ever before at Stanford.
Yet no undergraduates have declared
majors in Jewish studies, nor have any cho
sen to participate in its year-old honors
program. And the eight professors are
working with only 10 Jewish studies grad
uate students.
In a year when other interdisciplinary
programs are facing cuts and even elimina
tion, why has Jewish Studies come out of
nowhere to become what its director says is
already one of the finest such programs in

the country?
For one thing, several professors said
they ieel the new program fills a void that
has existed at Stanford for a long time.
"Jewish studies was never represented very
well at this university and elsewhere," accord
ing to Religious Studies Asst. Prof. Howard
Eilberg-Schwartz, who teaches ancient
Judaism and the anthropology of religion.
History Visiting Prof. Steven Zipperstein,
who serves as the program's director, said
that in the past there has been a
"widespread impression that Stanford
wasn't a great place for Jews — that the
number (admitted) was held in check.
"I think the University wanted to end all
that in a very big way, and it did."
Stanford expanded what in the
early 1980s were just a few cours
es into the now-burgeoning pro
gram by targeting the Jewish
community to raise money.
And raise money it did, as it
created several professorships, an
endowed lecture series and an
endowed curatorship to work
with the newly acquired Salo
Baron library, which Zipperstein
called "the best private Judaica
collection in the U.S."
He said the money was raised
from "a whole collection of alumni,
faculty and other extraordinarily
devoted locals who pitched in and
provided the program with as firm
footing as one could ever imagine."
Stanford is now trying to raise
$2 million for five graduate fellow
ships, according to Victoria Robin
son from the Development Office,
who has worked with the Jewish
Studies Program to raise money.
More graduate students "are

really the next critical step in
putting together a Jewish studies
program of national stature,"
Robinson said. "Stanford cannot
accept [another] graduate student
into this program until the money
is in place."
Zipperstein said he has already
heard from more than 30 potential
graduate students interested in
coming to Stanford next year. Since
Stanford already has 10 Jewish
studies graduate students and since
no more than five or six positions
are likely to be created next year,
competition should be fierce. "We're
likely to be able to choose from the
veiy best," Zipperstein said.
Several professors defended
the program's growth in a time of
budget cuts.
"Jewish Studies' growth is not
at the expense of anyone else
since the money is coming from
private donations," Eilberg-
Schwartz said.
"The vast amount of what was
spent by Jewish studies has been
raised by Jewish studies," Zipper
stein said.
Still, Zipperstein said fund

raising ability should not be a fac
tor in determining which pro
grams are cut. "Our program is
superior because of very good
appointments, not because of
fund-raising," he said.
History Prof. Jack Rakove said
there was some question about
the "fit between the identity of
Stanford and the intellectual
thrust of the program.... One
does not think of the Stanford
ambience as a campus that has a
strong Jewish character even if it
has a lot of Jews here in the same
way that one would think of
Columbia or the University of
Chicago or even Harvard."
But Rakove, who is Jewish,
said it was too early to judge the
program's fitness at Stanford. He
also said that having Jewish his
tory scholars was crucial to his
department.
The new professors are not
exclusively scholars in Judaism,
according to Zipperstein, who spe
cializes in both Jewish and Rus
sian history. History Assoc. Prof.
Aron Rodrigue is an expert in
Ottoman History as well as

Sephardic and French Jewry.
In the last year or so, Jewish
Studies has created both an under
graduate individually designed
mqjor and an honors program that
includes an honors research paper,
according to program administra
tor Hava Megiddo. But no stu
dents have taken advantage of
either program yet.
Still, she said, approximately
45 students are currently taking
Eilberg-Schwartz's Introduction
to Judaism, and about 20 students
are taking Beginning Hebrew —
"more than ever before."
Zipperstein also pointed out
that several graduate students in
other fields have taken advantage
of the new professors' specialties
to include Jewish studies in their
own graduate work. For example,
Zipperstein said he is currently
working with a number of Ameri
can history students interested in
American Jewish history.
Rakove suggested enrollment
in Jewish studies courses may
grow as its professors' reputa
tions spread. "Stanford students
are cautious," he said.
