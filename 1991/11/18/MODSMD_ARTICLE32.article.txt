# Big Game cheer 'axed'

The infamous Atlanta Braves
Tomahawk Chop almost hacked
into Stanford's multicultural
roots last week.
The Department of Athletics'
marketing team withdrew a pro
posal for a giveaway of 40,000
cardboard axes, which would have
been used for the Big Game "axe"
cheer, when administrators and
team directors realized the pro
motion could be offensive to
Native Americans.
They feared the cheer would
resemble the Tomahawk Chop,
which was used by many Braves'
fans at this year's World Series
and which drew protest from
Native Americans groups.
According to Jim Brungard, who
heads the marketing team, its
members came up with the idea to
make "a great and enthusiastic
cheer for the game."
However, the plan never got
off the drawing board. When
Brungard saw students doing the
Tomahawk Chop at the Nov. 9
Stanford-UCLA football game, he
realized there might be a problem
with his ax idea.
"We didn't want them (the stu
dents) to do the Tomahawk
cheer," he said, "and when they
started doing it on their own at
the UCLA game, we decided not

to go ahead with the promotion.'*
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son, who was consulted before the
decision was made, agreed.
"At some point in the UCLA
game folks started doing the
Tomahawk chant and that made
made me very upset," he said. "If
we gave out thousands of axes
they would start doing the chant
and doing the chop and that
would be extremely insulting to
American Indians."
Jackson and Brungard were
correct to take the UCLA game as
a sign that some people may be
offended by the promotion, accord
ing to Angelique Jackson, a Sisse
ton-Wahpeton Dakota Indian.
"We are not a mascot," she said.
"It's dehumanizing to think of us
in the same way you think of bull
dogs. ... In my heart, it hurts."
Jackson also noted the back
ward step Stanford would take by
bringing in the chop. "We've got
ten a lot of credit for getting rid of
the Indian mascot, and to bring
this sort of thing back is against
the multicultural tradition that
we have established," he said.
Bill Bray, a Muscogee Indian,
said he was pleasantly surprised
when he heard about the decision.
"It's one of the most thoughtful
things I've heard of lately," he
said. "It's a tribute to Stanford
that they showed that sort of con
sideration."

thriving program in the face of budget cuts: "Our program is superi
or because of very good appointmetns, not because of fund-raising."
