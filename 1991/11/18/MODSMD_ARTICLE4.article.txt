# Sigma Chi party decor draws fire marshal's ire
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Residents of the Sigma Chi fraternity
house were evacuated Saturday night after
their "Robin Hood" party decorations were
declared a fire hazard by Stanford Fire
Marshal Ray Gamma.
"They basically tried to turn their house
into Sherwood Forest," according to Dean
of Students Michael Jackson, who was
called to the scene at midnight by Stanford
Police. "It was just one big mess."
According to Assoc. Dean of Residential
Affairs Diana Conklin, who inspected the
house yesterday, the decorations were "elab
orate and creative and absolutely lethal.
"I've never seen anything like it," she
said. "We're still sort of speechless." The
offending decorations included tree branch
es, bales of hay and an indoor slide and
maze that obstructed exits, smoke alarms
and fire extinguishers.
According to Gamma, the fire hazards
were noticed by first-aid units who visited the
house after an entertainer hired by the frater
nity was injured in a fall from the slide. The

38-year-old woman was taken to Stanford
Hospital and released later that night.
Firefighters who responded to a false
alarm at the house early Saturday morning
did not notice any fire code violations,
Gamma said.
"At that time the hazardous conditions
did not exist because they were still in the
process of constructing the decorations,"
he added.
Fraternity members were officially read
mitted to the house yesterday evening after
removing the hazardous decorations.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Hilary
Karp, no criminal charges have been filed
against the Sigma Chis yet.
"We will be recommending charges to
the district attorney's office later this
week, based on the fire marshal's final
report," Karp said.
The University has asked the fraternity
to submit a complete report of the incident
to the Dean's office. Sigma Chi President
John Arrillaga refused to comment on the
matter yesterday.
"Given the fires that took place
at Berkeley and San Jose State
last year, it worries me that stu
dents would put themselves and
their friends at risk in this way,"

Jackson said.
Jackson also expressed concern
that other student groups will
attempt to emulate the Sigma
Chis' elaborate party preparations.
"This party was a disaster wait
ing to happen," Jackson said. "If
other students think they can dec
orate their houses like this for par
ties, then they should think twice."
