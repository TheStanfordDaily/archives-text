# Football says 'Aloha' to Hawaii, Yellow Jackets

### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
Stanford football won't be home for
Christmas, and they like it that way.
Crediting the players who made it all
possible, Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland announced yesterday that the
Cardinal accepted a bid to play defending
co-national champion Georgia Tech in the
Aloha Bowl on Dec. 25.
"We had a number of options about which
bowl to play in, but the number-one criteria
was the chance to reward the players for the
tremendous job they have done," Leland
said. "Honolulu was attractive; Georgia Tech
was attractive. We based the decision on
what was most rewarding for our team."
Among the other bowls that expressed
interest in Stanford, now ranked No. 21 in

this week's Associated Press poll, were the
Freedom, Copper and John Hancock Bowls.
The Freedom Bowl was considered the
Aloha Bowl's top contender due to its Dec.
30 playing date and the fact that, because it
is played in Anaheim, more Stanford stu
dents and alumni would have been able to
attend the game. In the end, however, it was
the sun and surf of Hawaii that won out.
"It is a player's bowl, no doubt about it,"
Stanford head coach Denny Green said. "If
you are not playing in a [New Year's Day]
bowl, I don't think there are many players
in the country that wouldn't choose the
Aloha bowl. When you talk about going to
Hawaii, a lot of our players are from all
over the country and haven't been there."
Though the Aloha pays out $650,000 to
each participant, the Cardinal's
extended season will not be a
financial windfall. Stanford is
responsible for its own trans
portation and living costs, and
according to Leland, the payout
might not be enough. Despite all
the hoopla surrounding the bowl
bid, Stanford could lose money by
playing in the game.
"We will receive from the bowl
$650,000, but it will take us
$650,000 to get the team over
there, to get all the administra
tors over there and to keep our
students in hotels here after final
exams are over and the dorms
close," Leland said.
"I have received budgets from
other schools who have gone to
these bowls, and it is pretty close
as to whether you break even or
not. We have received a clear
mandate from the University that
we can't lose money on this. This
is not a financial bonanza for us
directly, but indirectly it is a big
step forward for us."
Leland and Green later cited
bowl games as major recruiting
tools for both the football pro

gram and the University, but
according to Leland the experi
ence also enhances the communi
ty at large.
"Stanford has forgotten how
much fun it is winning at foot
ball," Leland said. "Going to this
bowl game helps people under
stand how fun being successful
can be."
The players are certainly
enjoying the experience. For fifth
year seniors like Tommy Vardell,
this is the first time that Stanford
has had big-time success on the
football field.
"The first four years we have
been setting the table, and now it
is time to eat," Vardell said.
"Nothing has been given to us;
nothing has been free. For fifth
year seniors, it has taken five
years to do it."
For many on the Stanford foot
ball team this bowl bid is payback
for the hard work they have put
in all season. The Cardinal will be
crossing the Pacific this holiday
season, and they could not be hap
pier.
"Of all the places that we could
go, what could be better than
Hawaii?" linebacker Ron George
said. "Christmas will be real spe
cial for us; this is the best present
we could ask for."
