A new course cross-listed in the
Graduate School of Business and the
Department of Mechanical Engineering
has students building can crushers and
then marketing them.
It is the first course to be jointly
offered in the Business School and the
School of Engineering, according to
David Beach, a professor of mechanical
engineering who is one of the course's
three instructors.

"The course is an experiment trying
to blend two different cultures," Beach
said, noting that "group dynamics of
people with different professional back
grounds foster a productive tension."
The course, called Integrated Design,
Manufacturing and Marketability, teach
es "cross-functional cooperation," accord
ing to Business School Prof. William
Lovejoy, another instructor of the class.
The 20 students in the class were
matched up in groups of four, with each
group containing two M.B.A. candidates
and two master's students in mechani

cal engineering, Lovejoy said.
The requirements of the course are
rigorous. Initially, students will conduct
market research on can crushers to find
the product attributes most valued by
the consumers, Lovejoy said.
Armed with this knowledge, they will
design and manufacture a prototype can
crusher as efficiently as possible, while
still maintaining the quality standards
necessary for it to be successful on the
market, he said.

Blending engineering with business, Dan Adams works intently on a logo. The course, Integrated Design, Manufacturing
and Marketability, requires students to design, create and market can crushers.
