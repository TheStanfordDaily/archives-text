# Course combines business, engineering

A new course cross-listed in the
Graduate School of Business and the
Department of Mechanical Engineering
has students building can crushers and
then marketing them.
It is the first course to be jointly
offered in the Business School and the
School of Engineering, according to
David Beach, a professor of mechanical
engineering who is one of the course's
three instructors.

"The course is an experiment trying
to blend two different cultures," Beach
said, noting that "group dynamics of
people with different professional back
grounds foster a productive tension."
The course, called Integrated Design,
Manufacturing and Marketability, teach
es "cross-functional cooperation," accord
ing to Business School Prof. William
Lovejoy, another instructor of the class.
The 20 students in the class were
matched up in groups of four, with each
group containing two M.B.A. candidates
and two master's students in mechani

cal engineering, Lovejoy said.
The requirements of the course are
rigorous. Initially, students will conduct
market research on can crushers to find
the product attributes most valued by
the consumers, Lovejoy said.
Armed with this knowledge, they will
design and manufacture a prototype can
crusher as efficiently as possible, while
still maintaining the quality standards
necessary for it to be successful on the
market, he said.

and Marketability, requires students to design, create and market can crushers.
Meanwhile, the data gained in
the market research will be used
to simulate a market on the com
puter, Lovejoy said. Using the
attributes of the manufactured
can crushers and their projected
prices, the groups will compete for
grades against each other on the
"simulated market by which the
products will be judged," he said.
"I think this is the first time it
has been done anywhere," Love
joy said, adding, "I don't know
another course where the compe
tition is on profit."
According to Lovejoy, student
interest in the new course was
very high. "It was over-sub
scribed," he said. Both business

and engineering students were
enthusiastic about being exposed
to the other side of a business,
Lovejoy said.
"Every student [will have] an
experience on the other person's
turf," he said, noting that all stu
dents have to complete assign
ments on the engineering as well
as the business side.
According to Ulrike Easton, an
M.B.A. candidate, "The course
simulates the real world. You can
watch the entire life cycle of a
product."
John Barto, another engineering
student, said "Competition among
groups is fun — it's more like reali
ty." But there is a downside to it, he
said, noting that each group in the
class refrains from sharing their
knowledge with the others. Just like
in real life, they fear assisting their
competitors, he said.
