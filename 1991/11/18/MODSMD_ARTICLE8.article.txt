# Rapper: New 'teacher' needed
## 
### Cheo Coker 
As a hip-hop artist, KRS-ONE
calls things exactly as he sees
them. Public speaker KRS-ONE
is much the same.
Among issues he covered in his
speech to a packed Kresge Audito
rium Friday night was the U.S.
economy and its ills: "I'll break
down the United States' econom
ic system in five seconds: capital
ism, pimps and hoes — period.
You're either selling or being
sold," he said.
KRS-ONE, whose real name is
Kris Parker, was received warmly
by the racially diverse, though
largely African-American, audi
ence.
Parker, also known as "the
teacher," spoke about his latest
project, Human Education
Against Lies (HEAL) and his
forthcoming book, "Civilization
vs. Technology." Parker was fea
tured at the closing symposium of
Omega Psi Phi fraternity's Eighth
Annual Achievement Week.
In the past the messages of
Parker's rap songs and social
directives have been aimed more
directly toward a black audience.
HEAL's mission, however, is to
diminish ignorance within all
communities, regardless of eth
nicity or creed.
"Before you are a race, religion
or an occupation, you are a
human being," Parker said.
Parker said the manipulation
of organized religion and educa
tion are at the root of society's
misdirection. He waved the pock
et Oxford Dictionary and the King
James Bible, calling them sym
bols of the religious and educa
tional systems and using them as
references during his discussion.
In his opinion, both books and
the systems they represent, in

their misuse, work against com
mon sense. HEAL's co-founder
Zizwe, a professor at UC-River
side, introduced Parker, saying,
"The real killer disease is not A-I-
D-S but C-S-D-S — Common
Sense Deficiency Syndrome."
Parker agreed, saying educa
tion, in its present form, misleads
rather than enlightens. "Com
mon sense rules all other five
senses," he said. "You get your
degrees — excuse me, receipts —
in memory, not intellect."

Comparing the audience to
"Memorex tapes," Parker said that
memory and intellect differ. Unlike
memory, he said, "Intellect asks
questions, seeks to know more."
At another point, Parker held
up controversial groups like 2 Live
Crew and N.W.A (Niggas with
Attitude) as products of a mis
guided education system. Rather
than censor such artists, he said,
we should question their teachers.
"Who taught them to respect sex
and violence?" he asked.
