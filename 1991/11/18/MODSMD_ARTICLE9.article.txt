Stanford's latest indirect
cost appeal is the beginning of
a process usually pursued by
major defense-industry con
tractors that is likely to last at
least 18 months.
The University filed an
appeal Thursday with the
Armed Services Board of Con
tract Appeals requesting pay
ment for actual indirect costs
for 1990-91.
"There aren't that many
appeals from universities,"
according to one judge from the
board of appeals. "Usually, con
tracts between the military and
universities are dispute-free or
are settled on the local level.
"But like any other contrac
tor, universities have the right
to appeal decisions by the con
tracting officer,"he said.
Stanford is appealing the
August decision by the Office
of Naval Research to fix the
provisional indirect-cost recov

The University originally
requested a rate of 78 percent,
and Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten estimates the
University should receive
reimbursement for a rate of

approximately 71 percent.
The difference in recovery
rates between 71 and 55.5 per
cent cost Stanford more than
$20 million for last year. The
appeal does not apply to ongo

rect-cost rate for the current
fiscal year or future years.
Thursday's action consisted
of only three pages filed with
the Armed Services Board of
Contract Appeals declaring
that Stanford intends to appeal
the decision.
A more extensive complaint
must be submitted within 30
days, according to Paul Williams,
chair of the board of appeals.
The Office of Naval Research
will then have 30 days to file an
answer and respond to each
allegation made in the Univer
sity's complaint.
"But a time extension for
either or both sides is not
unusual" in these type of
cases, Williams said.
The process then enters a
discovery stage in which both
sides request copies of docu
ments, define their factual and
legal positions and take deposi
tions. There is no time limit on
discovery, and it can often be
