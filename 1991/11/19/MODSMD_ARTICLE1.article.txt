# It was 20 years ago today
## Violent protest, radical thought marked Stanford campus of 1971 
### Mas Harntha Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of a two
part series examining the atmosphere on
the Stanford campus 20 years ago.

When student protesters occupied
University President Donald Kennedy's
office two years ago, that was big news.
But 20 years ago, for former University
President Richard Lyman, that would
have been just another working day.
Things were different, to say the least,
at Stanford in 1971. As the Vietnam War
galvanized the student movement here
and at other colleges, protests were the
norm. Students, disenchanted with the
usual processes, took to more radical
measures to make their views heard.
"The '60s seemed to last a little longer at
Stanford than at other places," said Rich
Jarovslovsky, Class of '75, now the Wash

ington political editor at the Wall Street
Journal. "There were more people involved
in the movement at Berkeley, but there
was a more extreme brand of protest at
Stanford — more vocal and more radical."
It was a movement that regularly
attempted to work outside the main
stream to force change. Unlike the stu
dents two years ago — who occupied
Kennedy's office as a last resort to push
for a more multicultural curriculum —
most students in 1971 considered such
radical protest part of the game.
That year saw some of the most dramat
ic events in Stanford history. In what The
Daily called "probably the most frightful
night this campus has ever seen," two stu
dents were shot by an unknown assailant
during the widespread protests that fol
lowed the U.S. invasion of Laos in 1971.

on Feb. 8,1971. "What started as a peaceful sit-in usually became
violent," said Richard Lyman, Stanford's president during the
19705. Above: A little more than a week later, on Feb. 16,
protesters march down University Avenue in Palo Alto.
Stanford Hospital between Palo Alto
police and demonstrators left 13 police
officers and more than two dozen
protestors injured.
Four days later the police raided The
Daily's office searching for photographs
of the protesters. It was the first time in
the nation's history that a newspaper
had been forced to submit to such a
search, but a 1978 Supreme Court deci
sion, Zurcher vs. Stanford Daily, upheld
the police's rights.
On April 23, Lyman's office in Building
10 was bombed. No one was injured, but it
was just one of several attacks on the presi
dent's office and home.
And Sept. 28 marked the beginning
of the hearing against English Assoc.
Prof. Bruce Franklin, a radical Maoist
and the founder of two student groups
advocating armed violence to speed the
overthrow of "imperialism."
Franklin — charged with inciting vio
lence and disrupting the speech of Henry
Cabot Lodge, the former ambassador to
South Vietnam — became the only
tenured professor Stanford has ever
fired.
But those were just the major inci
dents — at Stanford in 1971, occupied
buildings, disrupted classes, shattered
windows and protest marches were a
common sight.
"Stanford was strange then," said
Hoover Institution Visiting Fellow
Williamson Evers, Class of '72. "You
could go out at nighttime and there
would be policemen with jumpsuits and
bullet-proof vests and tear-gas grenades
all over the place. You couldn't study at
Meyer because of all the tear gas leaking
in from outside."

'It was easy for people to
go out and raise hell if they
masked themselves under
a noble cause.'

During one rally Jarovslovsky remem
bers particularly well, 70 police officers
arrested more than 200 protestors who
had blocked El Camino Real.
"The police came in buses, and it was a
fairly confusing charge," he said. "People
were getting clubbed left and right. It was
scary — one of the most vivid memories I
have of my four years at Stanford."
Paul Seaver, a history professor, said:
"The environment at certain points got
very chaotic. . . . The tactics of the police
were very frightening, especially when
they came in helicopters and were tear
gassing people."
'Support your local pig'
Like most other college campuses in
the early 19705, Stanford was liberal. In
general, most students were at least
sympathetic toward the anti-war move
ment, if not actually involved in the
protests.
"Let's just say that Richard Nixon was
not very popular on campus," said

Jonathan Dedmon, Class of '72. "Young
Americans for Freedom — the main
stream Republican group on campus —
was basically a fringe movement at the
time."
According to Lyman, liberalism at
Stanford began to flourish in the 1960s
and early 19705. "In the 19505," he said,
"straw polls taken by The Daily showed
that most students voted Republican.
Then in the 1960s and after, the trend
was toward the liberals."
The anti-war movement was split
between those who supported a non-vio
lent form of protest and those who want
ed a "revolution" of the type preached by
Franklin.
The vast majority of students at
Stanford could be considered part of the
first group, although the radical
activists got most of the attention from
the media and from politicians like
Nixon and then-California Gov. Ronald
Reagan, who attacked the unrest at col
lege campuses.
Myra Gilfix, Class of '73, was like
many students at that time — although
she wasn't heavily involved in the
protests, she was sympathetic to them.
"I was only on the fringes of the
protest movement, but I was pretty anti
police," Gilfix said. "I even had a piggy
bank in my window that said 'Support
your local pig,' to mock the police."
But she emphasized that "the stu
dents were pretty much under control."
In fact, the Underground Guide to Col
leges that year called Stanford students
"rational revolutionaries."
Gilfix remembered that when Reagan
gave a speech at UC-Berkeley, he berated
the protest movement and called the stu
dents there "rabble-rousers."
"A professor friend of mine tried to tell

'Stanford was strange
then. You could go out at
nighttime and there would
be policemen ... and tear
gas grenades all over the
place.'

him that it just wasn't true," Gilfix said,
"but he wouldn't listen to her."
Protests 'made life difficult'
Most professors, although sympathet
ic to the protestors' liberal politics, dis
liked the disruption they caused.
"It made life pretty difficult," Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said. "Most
faculty members were against the Viet
nam War, but many wanted the protests
to go away because they were so disrup
tive."
He noted that "all the giant plate glass
windows in Hoover Tower were broken
out. They were replaced twice, and then
they just put plywood in."
The Hoover Institution was a favorite
target of protestors because of its conser
vative bent, but other buildings on cam
pus got similar treatment.
And, according to Lyman, there were

at least half a dozen arson incidents. Part
of Encina Hall was burned and is still
vacant today, he said.
Lyman, who was University President
from 1970 to 1980, said it was very diffi
cult to maintain order. "I never imagined
I would be in that kind of situation," he
said. "What started as a peaceful sit-in
usually became violent. I was always the
bad guy who had to call the police when
things became unpleasant."
English Prof. Martin Evans recalls
that he was afraid his classes would be
disrupted, a tactic often used by students
in an effort to close down the University.
"The students would come in and try
to take over the mike and persuade the
class to go on strike," Evans said. "It was
a nightmare. It was the only time in my
years at Stanford that I considered get
ting another job."
But Dedmon, who covered the protests
and the Franklin hearings as a Daily
reporter, said, "The acts of violence,"
although mostly detrimental, did have
some tangible value — they did get the
news and focus attention on what was
happening."
But others said that when the nation
did focus on the protests, the issues that
motivated the protestors were obscured
by the violence — and their motives were
not always so idealistic.
"People are very sentimental and nos
talgic about the '605," Lyman said. "But
they forget there was a strong anti-intel
lectual movement — ego-raising mas
querading as idealism. It was easy for peo
ple to go out and raise hell if they masked
themselves under a noble cause."

In tomorrow's story: a detailed look at the
Franklin hearings and a comparison of
students then and now.

fairly confusing charge," he said. "People
were getting clubbed left and right. It was
scary — one of the most vivid memories I
have of my four years at Stanford."
Paul Seaver, a history professor, said:
"The environment at certain points got
very chaotic. . . . The tactics of the police
were very frightening, especially when
they came in helicopters and were tear
gassing people."
'Support your local pig'
Like most other college campuses in
the early 19705, Stanford was liberal. In
general, most students were at least
sympathetic toward the anti-war move
ment, if not actually involved in the
protests.
"Let's just say that Richard Nixon was
not very popular on campus," said

Jonathan Dedmon, Class of '72. "Young
Americans for Freedom — the main
stream Republican group on campus —
was basically a fringe movement at the
time."
According to Lyman, liberalism at
Stanford began to flourish in the 1960s
and early 19705. "In the 19505," he said,
"straw polls taken by The Daily showed
that most students voted Republican.
Then in the 1960s and after, the trend
was toward the liberals."
The anti-war movement was split
between those who supported a non-vio
lent form of protest and those who want
ed a "revolution" of the type preached by
Franklin.
The vast majority of students at
Stanford could be considered part of the
first group, although the radical
activists got most of the attention from
the media and from politicians like
Nixon and then-California Gov. Ronald
Reagan, who attacked the unrest at col
lege campuses.
Myra Gilfix, Class of '73, was like
many students at that time — although
she wasn't heavily involved in the
protests, she was sympathetic to them.
"I was only on the fringes of the
protest movement, but I was pretty anti
police," Gilfix said. "I even had a piggy
bank in my window that said 'Support
your local pig,' to mock the police."
But she emphasized that "the stu
dents were pretty much under control."
In fact, the Underground Guide to Col
leges that year called Stanford students
"rational revolutionaries."
Gilfix remembered that when Reagan
gave a speech at UC-Berkeley, he berated
the protest movement and called the stu
dents there "rabble-rousers."
"A professor friend of mine tried to tell

'Stanford was strange
then. You could go out at
nighttime and there would
be policemen ... and tear
gas grenades all over the
place.'

him that it just wasn't true," Gilfix said,
"but he wouldn't listen to her."
Protests 'made life difficult'
Most professors, although sympathet
ic to the protestors' liberal politics, dis
liked the disruption they caused.
"It made life pretty difficult," Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said. "Most
faculty members were against the Viet
nam War, but many wanted the protests
to go away because they were so disrup
tive."
He noted that "all the giant plate glass
windows in Hoover Tower were broken
out. They were replaced twice, and then
they just put plywood in."
The Hoover Institution was a favorite
target of protestors because of its conser
vative bent, but other buildings on cam
pus got similar treatment.
And, according to Lyman, there were

at least half a dozen arson incidents. Part
of Encina Hall was burned and is still
vacant today, he said.
Lyman, who was University President
from 1970 to 1980, said it was very diffi
cult to maintain order. "I never imagined
I would be in that kind of situation," he
said. "What started as a peaceful sit-in
usually became violent. I was always the
bad guy who had to call the police when
things became unpleasant."
English Prof. Martin Evans recalls
that he was afraid his classes would be
disrupted, a tactic often used by students
in an effort to close down the University.
"The students would come in and try
to take over the mike and persuade the
class to go on strike," Evans said. "It was
a nightmare. It was the only time in my
years at Stanford that I considered get
ting another job."
But Dedmon, who covered the protests
and the Franklin hearings as a Daily
reporter, said, "The acts of violence,"
although mostly detrimental, did have
some tangible value — they did get the
news and focus attention on what was
happening."
But others said that when the nation
did focus on the protests, the issues that
motivated the protestors were obscured
by the violence — and their motives were
not always so idealistic.
"People are very sentimental and nos
talgic about the '605," Lyman said. "But
they forget there was a strong anti-intel
lectual movement — ego-raising mas
querading as idealism. It was easy for peo
ple to go out and raise hell if they masked
themselves under a noble cause."

Franklin hearings and a comparison of

Editor's note: This is the first of a two
part series examining the atmosphere on
the Stanford campus 20 years ago.

When student protesters occupied
University President Donald Kennedy's
office two years ago, that was big news.
But 20 years ago, for former University
President Richard Lyman, that would
have been just another working day.
Things were different, to say the least,
at Stanford in 1971. As the Vietnam War
galvanized the student movement here
and at other colleges, protests were the
norm. Students, disenchanted with the
usual processes, took to more radical
measures to make their views heard.
"The '60s seemed to last a little longer at
Stanford than at other places," said Rich
Jarovslovsky, Class of '75, now the Wash

ington political editor at the Wall Street
Journal. "There were more people involved
in the movement at Berkeley, but there
was a more extreme brand of protest at
Stanford — more vocal and more radical."
It was a movement that regularly
attempted to work outside the main
stream to force change. Unlike the stu
dents two years ago — who occupied
Kennedy's office as a last resort to push
for a more multicultural curriculum —
most students in 1971 considered such
radical protest part of the game.
That year saw some of the most dramat
ic events in Stanford history. In what The
Daily called "probably the most frightful
night this campus has ever seen," two stu
dents were shot by an unknown assailant
during the widespread protests that fol
lowed the U.S. invasion of Laos in 1971.
On April 8, a violent confrontation at

Top right: A rally protesting the U.S. invasion of Laos turns ugly
on Feb. 8,1971. "What started as a peaceful sit-in usually became
violent," said Richard Lyman, Stanford's president during the
19705. Above: A little more than a week later, on Feb. 16,
protesters march down University Avenue in Palo Alto.
Stanford Hospital between Palo Alto
police and demonstrators left 13 police
officers and more than two dozen
protestors injured.
Four days later the police raided The
Daily's office searching for photographs
of the protesters. It was the first time in
the nation's history that a newspaper
had been forced to submit to such a
search, but a 1978 Supreme Court deci
sion, Zurcher vs. Stanford Daily, upheld
the police's rights.
On April 23, Lyman's office in Building
10 was bombed. No one was injured, but it
was just one of several attacks on the presi
dent's office and home.
And Sept. 28 marked the beginning
of the hearing against English Assoc.
Prof. Bruce Franklin, a radical Maoist
and the founder of two student groups
advocating armed violence to speed the
overthrow of "imperialism."
Franklin — charged with inciting vio
lence and disrupting the speech of Henry
Cabot Lodge, the former ambassador to
South Vietnam — became the only
tenured professor Stanford has ever
fired.
But those were just the major inci
dents — at Stanford in 1971, occupied
buildings, disrupted classes, shattered
windows and protest marches were a
common sight.
"Stanford was strange then," said
Hoover Institution Visiting Fellow
Williamson Evers, Class of '72. "You
could go out at nighttime and there
would be policemen with jumpsuits and
bullet-proof vests and tear-gas grenades
all over the place. You couldn't study at
Meyer because of all the tear gas leaking
in from outside."

'It was easy for people to
go out and raise hell if they
masked themselves under
a noble cause.'

During one rally Jarovslovsky remem
bers particularly well, 70 police officers
arrested more than 200 protestors who
had blocked El Camino Real.
"The police came in buses, and it was a
fairly confusing charge," he said. "People
were getting clubbed left and right. It was

a nightmare. It was the only time in my
years at Stanford that I considered get
ting another job."
But Dedmon, who covered the protests
and the Franklin hearings as a Daily
reporter, said, "The acts of violence,"
although mostly detrimental, did have
some tangible value — they did get the
news and focus attention on what was
happening."
But others said that when the nation
did focus on the protests, the issues that
motivated the protestors were obscured
by the violence — and their motives were
not always so idealistic.
"People are very sentimental and nos
talgic about the '605," Lyman said. "But
they forget there was a strong anti-intel
lectual movement — ego-raising mas
querading as idealism. It was easy for peo
ple to go out and raise hell if they masked
themselves under a noble cause."

In tomorrow's story: a detailed look at the
Franklin hearings and a comparison of
students then and now.
