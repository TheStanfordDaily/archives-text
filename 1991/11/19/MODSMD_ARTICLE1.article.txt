Editor's note: This is the first of a two
part series examining the atmosphere on
the Stanford campus 20 years ago.

When student protesters occupied
University President Donald Kennedy's
office two years ago, that was big news.
But 20 years ago, for former University
President Richard Lyman, that would
have been just another working day.
Things were different, to say the least,
at Stanford in 1971. As the Vietnam War
galvanized the student movement here
and at other colleges, protests were the
norm. Students, disenchanted with the
usual processes, took to more radical
measures to make their views heard.
"The '60s seemed to last a little longer at
Stanford than at other places," said Rich
Jarovslovsky, Class of '75, now the Wash

ington political editor at the Wall Street
Journal. "There were more people involved
in the movement at Berkeley, but there
was a more extreme brand of protest at
Stanford — more vocal and more radical."
It was a movement that regularly
attempted to work outside the main
stream to force change. Unlike the stu
dents two years ago — who occupied
Kennedy's office as a last resort to push
for a more multicultural curriculum —
most students in 1971 considered such
radical protest part of the game.
That year saw some of the most dramat
ic events in Stanford history. In what The
Daily called "probably the most frightful
night this campus has ever seen," two stu
dents were shot by an unknown assailant
during the widespread protests that fol
lowed the U.S. invasion of Laos in 1971.

violent," said Richard Lyman, Stanford's president during the
