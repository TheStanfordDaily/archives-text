Market rises after Friday's drop
NEW YORK (AP) — The stock market
brushed aside fears of another Black Monday
with a 30-point rise in the Dow Jones average.
Investors stayed calm despite lingering doubts
about the nation's ailing economy.
Lessons learned from past crashes and word
from Washington that a controversial credit-card
measure would likely die helped the Dow recover
about one-quarter of Friday's 120-point plunge.
House approves military spending
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House yester
day approved a $291-billion military spending
bill for 1992 that would speed up troop cuts and
reject President Bush's request for four new B
-2 stealth bombers.
The Senate is expected later this week to
approve the measure, which would limit spend
ing on nuclear weapons programs, and Bush's
signature seems likely.
Status of whales questioned
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government
yesterday proposed removing the California
gray whale from the list of endangered species,
citing a surprising population recovery.
The California gray whale, which has been on
the list since its inception under the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, would become
the first marine creature to be removed from its
protections.
