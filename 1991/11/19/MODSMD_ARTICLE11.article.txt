# Two hostages freed
## Remaining Americans may be released

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Shiite Muslim
kidnappers freed British hostage Terry
Waite and American Thomas Sutherland
yesterday, and Waite said the remaining
three Americans held hostage in Lebanon
would be released by month's end.
"Terry Waite and I are very happy to
have received our first gulps of Lebanon
and Syrian fresh air but we have to wait to
tomorrow to meet the sunshine," said a
joyous Sutherland on his arrival from
Beirut.
Their release by the group Islamic
Jihad, or Holy War, was a dramatic
advance toward ending the hostage ordeal.
The United Nations has been leading
diplomatic efforts to gain freedom for
Western hostages in Lebanon in exchange
for the release of Arab detainees held by
Israel — a condition demanded by the kid
nappers.
Sutherland and Waite had been consid
ered key hostages, partly because of the
length of time they had been held. Their
release raised speculation that the Israelis
may have made a commitment to free
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, their most valu
able Shiite prisoner.
Waite said at a news conference that his
captors told him before they set him free
that American hostages Joseph Ciccipio
and Alann Steen would be released within
the next five days and Terry Anderson by
the end of the month.

He said he did not know when the three
remaining hostages — two Germans and
an Italian — would be released. But U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said all should be freed by Christmas.
Waite and Sutherland were in high spir
its and were quite talkative.
They indicated they had been chained to
a wall day and night for most of their cap
tivity and that they depended on each
other for comfort and company.
Waite said one captor came to tell them
yesterday afternoon they would be
released. "He also said to me, 'We apologize
for having captured you.' They recognize
now that this was the wrong thing to do,
that holding hostages achieves no useful,
constructive purpose."
Sutherland said he and the others were
"humbled" by learning over the past few
months of the support the hostages had
worldwide.
Of Anderson, the longest-held hostage,
Sutherland said: "He's a man who should
have never been kidnapped," adding that
Anderson had just been doing his job as a
journalist.
Sutherland's daughter Joan watched
her father's news conference on an airport
television in Portland, Ore., then boarded a
plane to reunite with him.
"He looks wonderful!" she shrieked.
"He looks just like he did before. I just
can't believe how good he looks."
