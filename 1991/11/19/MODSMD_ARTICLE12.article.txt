BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) â€” The commander of
Croat fighters huddling in the
ruins of Vukovar ordered his
men to end their three-month
fight against besieging federal
troops yesterday, Yugoslavia's
Tanjug news agency said.
Yugoslav soldiers who fought
their way into the eastern
Croatian city on Sunday fired
their guns into the air in cele
bration. Weary residents
crawled out of shelters by the
hundreds, some for the first
time in months.
However, a reliable Croatian
Defense Ministry source said
the Croats had not surrendered
and were still in contact with
the Zagreb headquarters.
There was no immediate
comment from federal army
commanders about the reported
surrender of Vukovar, which
had become an important psy
chological prize for both sides.
Croatian Health Minister
Andrija Hebrang, who took part
in talks with the army in the

Croatian capital Zagreb, said,
"We do not have any assur
ances" regarding the safety of
those left in Vukovar.
At the talks, Army and
Croatian officials reached agree
ment on evacuating 700 wound
ed from Vukovar's hospital,
Hebrang said.
In Belgrade, meanwhile,
Serbia's president endorsed the
sending of U.N. peacekeepers to
war-torn Yugoslavia.
Fighting continued in other
parts of Croatia as the warring
sides ignored the 13th cease-fire
agreement of the nearly 5-
month-old war.
AP reporter Dusan Stojanovic
said from Vukovar that there was
only sporadic small-arms fire in
the Danube River town on the
border with Serbia, though the
Croatian Defense Ministry
source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said fighting was con
tinuing.
Stojanovic said no building in
the town escaped damage from
the near relentless shelling.
