THE ASSU SENATE IS con
sidering a bill that would
tighten its attendance require
ments. It's about time. Given the
senate's poor attendance record,
such a move should have come much
sooner.
Unfortunately, the current pro
posal is inadequate and will not
mandate the necessary reforms.
The bill, as it currently stands,
would penalize senators who have
three or more unexcused absences
from senate or committee meet
ings over the course of the year.
This is little improvement over
the current and thoroughly inef
fective system that suspends sena
tors after four unexcused absences
and expels them after five.
There are 20 undergraduate and
20 graduate senators all ranked in
order of number of votes received
in last year's spring election. Only
the top 10 in each group have vot
ing rights. The new proposal would
move senators who have three
unexcused absences to the back of
the senate order, essentially strip
ping voting senators of their vote.
The top non-voting senator would
then move into a voting seat.
Several problems exist with this
solution to the ASSU's longstand
ing attendance problems. First,
the criteria are too lenient. Sena
tors should not be missing meet
ings without legitimate excuses.
Second, the difference between a
legitimate and an illegitimate
excuse is not codified.
The senate chair should not be
in charge of determining the valid
ity of senators' excuses. With no
criteria to guide the chair, the
threat of abuse of power is too
great to allow.
The senate needs a strong bill th at
would obligate its members to attend
meetings. Two changes are essential.

First, senators should be allowed
only one unexcused absence. Sena
tors put a lot of time into being
elected. They should be expected to
put a similar amount of time into
the job once they get it. If they can't
put in the necessary effort, they
should be removed. Two senate and
two committee meetings per month
is not too much to ask.
Second, set criteria defining the
difference between excused and
unexcused absences needs to be
adopted. Only a few excuses should
qualify as legitimate: an exam at
the time of the meeting, personal
illness or family emergency.
The meetings are scheduled far
enough in advance that the sena
tors should be able to work their
schedules around them. If they
can't achieve this simple task, they
shouldn't be senators.
The senate isn't taken seriously
by many students on this campus.
Poor attendance is one of the rea
sons. A student government that
controls assets totalling $1.3 mil
lion has a lot of power that it could
use to help the campus as well as
to build its own legitimacy.
But no government can gain its
constituents' confidence until it has
members who are serious about
their jobs. A senate that needs as
many non-voting members as vot
ing members to ensure a quorum is
not confidence-inspiring.
Senators who care about the
senate and who believe it is more
than a mock legislative experience
must transform their group. They
have to bring people together who
can fully utilize the ASSU's
resources.
Given the fact that senators do
not usually run for re-election, some
thing has to make them accountable
for attending their meetings. One
would hope that a sense of commit
ment and responsibility on the sena
tors' part would suffice, but given
the senate's track record, it's appar
ent that the commitment isn't
always strong enough.
The senate must strengthen the
attendance-requirement proposal,
pass it and abide by it.
