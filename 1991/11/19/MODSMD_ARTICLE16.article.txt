## My guide to the new PC 
### 
This political correctness
thing is getting a bit out of hand. I
can hardly manage to keep up — I
mean, I can hardly "personage" to keep up.
I read an article in U.S. News and
World Report which told of a feminist
professor who now teaches an "ovular,"
as opposed to a seminar, apparently
because of the latter word's roots in male
fluids. The article acknowledged that
with this mentality, students in such a
class would be taking "herstory" or
"his'n'herstory" rather than history.
Most of you probably wouldn't have
made the seminar connection, unless you
had a "seminar" in Hoover Tower (in
which case the phallic thing would be on
your mind anyway, right?). So, for the
PC-clueless out there (isn't ignorance
bliss?), I present my own projections for
strict new PC guidelines.
First, get rid of all of those other
"sem" words like seminary and seminal.
Heck, while we're at it, better get rid of
semi-conductors, semi-circles, semi-pre
cious gems and semantics, which is what
we're dealing with here, after all.
And we had better replace tests with
the gender-neutral "examinations." No
longer will our legal system operate
under a penal code, but instead it will
enforce a "gender-neutral punishment
system."
We can't stop there. Just as history
might now become "herstory," out goes

hysterectomies, histograms and, I'm sorry
to say, Hispanic, which will now become
"any-gender person of Spanish descent."
But let's be fair. Time to nix those
female-dominated elements of our vocab
ulary as well. Hermaphrodite now
becomes . . . well, I'm not quite sure
about that one; it's already gender-neu
tral. But Ziermits will now be known as
"any-sex persons who prefer to be alone."
We'll no longer drink herha\ tea; rather
we'll consume "gender-neutral liquid dis
tillation from the flavorings of vegeta
tion-oriented organisms."
No longer will we complain only of
Aernias, because they affect men as well
as women. We'll never view Hercules in
the same way again. And you had better
get ready to buy some new PC-approved
comic books, folks. Because Superman
and Superu;oman will now become "per
sons of unusual strength who have cho
sen to orient themselves on different
ends of the gender and sexual-preference
spectrums."
But that's OK because they won't
have to deal with criminals who black
mail anymore. Now, Robin will proclaim,
"Holy PC-violators, Bat Person! They're
trying to 'person of color with a penis' the
mayor into giving them $1 million!" But
that's alright, too, because Batman will
no longer be Robin's mentor, but rather
his "gender-neutral person of greater
experience and knowledge."

No profession will escape PC's claws.
All gynecologists will become "gal-necolo
gists," as is more fitting for their duties.
No longer will they attend fund-raising
balls at the hospital, but rather "gala
events of a gender-neutral nature in
which socializing is encouraged."
Geography will never be the same
either. It looks like we'll have to wipe
Manchuria off the map. But no longer
will "Asian-Americans" suffer the racist
term "Oriental." The PC people have
been gracious enough to let Asian-Amer
icans know about this affront, which is
kind considering no Asian-American I've
ever asked knew that s/he was being
offended all these years.
But there must be a purpose in all of
this because there are simply too many
coincidences. It's absi/rd — I mean, "ab
madam-ed." For example, I doubt the
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, a.k.a. NAACP, will have
any choice but to change its name to the
National Association for the Advancement
of People-of-Color, which, coincidentally,
is NAA-PC. How appropriate.
