## Focus on altering behavior of Israelis wrongly placed 
### 
IN HER NOV. 4 LETTER ("Justice
not served ...") Diane Carpenter
expresses doubts that the Palestini
ans ever wanted to throw the Israelis
into the sea and states that living with
Palestinians this summer has taught her
that this "overused generalization" is
now "inaccurate and worthless."
Has Carpenter then never read the
still-unamended Palestinian National
Covenant, which in Article 15 calls for
. . liquidation of the Zionist Presence"?
Is it possible that a history major spe
cializing in this area is not aware of the
drift of statements like Ahmed Shukairy's,
then president of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and author of the booklet
"Liberation — Not Negotiation": "[After
our victory] the European nations will be
allowed in to pick up survivors, but there
will not be many" (1964).
How about Jordan's King Hussein's

"Kill the Jews wherever you find them.
Kill them with your hands, with your
nails and with your teeth" (1967)?
Forty years of mortal threats cannot
be undone instantly. That the hooligans
picked up olive branches instead of rocks
recently does not impress me.
Greece and Turkey exchanged mil
lions of people in 1923, as did India and
Pakistan in 1948. But despite the added
bonus of getting rid of their more than
800,000 disliked Jews, the Arab nations
refrained from settling their 630,000
brethren from Palestine, spending bil
lions upon billions on arms instead for
their vain attempts to have the Holy
Land revert to its pre-Zionist stupor.
At a fraction of that cost they might
have created a decent living for the
Palestinians and given them a home. But
it is still not too late for a solution that
might, once and for all, prove that our

preconceived notions about Arabs being
warlike and uncompromising are wrong.
It is a mystery to me why so many peo
ple whom one otherwise supposes to be
committed to democracy and human rights
sympathize with the intolerant and imperi
alist Arab world.
From the hypocritical condemnation
of Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" to
the many Arab editions of the Protocols
of Zion, probably for sale at mosques all
over the world; from the plight of the
non-Moslems in Southern Sudan to the
barren fate of Iraq's Kurds; and from
the 30,000 killed in Hafez al-Assad's
Hama massacre to Syria's occupation of
Lebanon that caused the flight of half its
Christian population, it looks like the
Arab peoples and their minorities are in
need of a lot of liberation.
Why is it Israel that is so often sin
gled out for criticism, and why should

the mott decent state in the Middle East
be the first to rectify its ways?
Justice would be better served if all
good people looking for a cause focused
their attention on Indonesian colonial
ism in East Timor and Western New
Guinea. Indonesia occupied East Timor
on the eve of its independence from Por
tugal in 1975; more than 100,000 (out of
700,000) have died there since then for
President Suharto's dream of empire.
And in one of the biggest U.N. mis
takes yet, Western New Guinea in 1963
was denied independence and handed
over to an Indonesia invoking anti-colo
nialism instead. Now its resources are
squandered, its profits flowing else
where, and the land stolen in a resettle
ment plan far outdoing anything possi
bly planned for the West Bank.
