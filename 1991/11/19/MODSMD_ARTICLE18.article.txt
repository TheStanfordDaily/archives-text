# ASSU must stop being political in decisions about funding SCAAN
## 
### 
Though the ASSU Program Board
approved 95 percent of the Stanford
Central America Action Network's
(SCAAN) funding request, the ASSU
Appropriations Committee cut our fund
ing to a meagre 10 percent of our origi
nal request. Budget cuts of this magni
tude were not carried out uniformly
across the spectrum of campus student
organizations. We demand an explana
tion for this capricious move.
SCAAN's fee request is primarily
intended to sponsor educational pro
grams, including speakers from the
African National Congress, Guatemala,
Cuba and El Salvador. There is an
emerging sentiment in the ASSU
demanding that students limit their
attention to "on-campus" issues only.

If this viewpoint is valid, then why
have international figures such as the
Soviet and Mexican presidents appeared
on campus? The speakers we invite to
this campus are involved in the struggle
for human rights and better conditions
of living in various parts of the world.
We see this drastic action as part of a
trend implicitly set by the appropria
tions committee that effectively silences
the voices of those campus groups that
are perceived as being "political." Tar
geting certain groups to the exclusion of
others is in itself a "political" act. We
fear that this problem goes beyond petty
inter-party squabbles to the more pro
found issue of free speech on campus.
Selective funding allows representa
tion of only a narrow range of voices,
which has the effect of consolidating a
certain set of political beliefs. SCAAN
hopes that our student leaders will rec
ognize the value of a diversity of student
opinion.
