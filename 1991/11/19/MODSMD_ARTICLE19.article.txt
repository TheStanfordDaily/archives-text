# C-15 threatens to warp Grey interpretation of Stanford speech code
## 
### 
The following statement was
endorsed by Law Profs. Gerald Gunther
and William Cohen.
In Section IX of the Stanford Univer
sity Student Conduct Policies, Law Prof.
Thomas Grey defends the purpose and
scope of the newest interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard.
In response to the question: Why is
intent to insult or stigmatize required?
Grey states:
"Student members of groups subject
to pervasive discrimination may be
injured by unintended insulting or stig
matizing remarks as well as by those
made with the requisite intent. In addi
tion, the intent requirement makes
enforcement of the prohibition of discrim
inatory harassment more difficult, partic

ularly since proof beyond a reasonable
doubt is required to establish charges of
Fundamental Standard violations."
Indeed, the highly-contested Grey
interpretation of the Fundamental Stan
dard received final acceptance in 1990 at
least in part because this "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" standard existed for cam
pus adjudicatory proceedings.
Thus, Grey and his allies argued that
although more charges potentially could
be filed against students who did not
conform to the University speech code,
justice would be preserved since the Uni
versity would be obligated to prove that
the student's behavior qualified as "dis
criminatory harassment" with the
"intent to insult or stigmatize a small
number of individuals" under the stan
dard of "beyond a reasonable doubt."
Therefore, many feel that the lessen
ing of this standard to "clear and con
vincing evidence" would subvert reliance
on the Grey interpretation.
