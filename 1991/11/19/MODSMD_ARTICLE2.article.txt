# Senators to consider new bill on 'proof'

Another bill rejecting a lower standard of proof in
University judicial cases will go before the ASSU
Senate tonight, two weeks after a similar bill failed.
The new bill is more succinct and better address
es concerns of senators and students, according to
graduate senator Doug Bone, the bill's author.
It rejects the proposal — submitted by the Com
mittee of 15, the only body that can propose amend
ments to the University's judicial charter — to
reduce the current level of proof needed to convict
students in misconduct cases from "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" to "clear and convincing evidence."
If the senate does not approve the change, it can
not be put into effect even if it is passed by the fac
ulty senate and endorsed by University President
Donald Kennedy.
Bone said the new bill is a "kinder, gentler" one.
It calls the proposed change "unwarranted and
unconstitutional" rather than "irresponsible," a
phrase used in the first bill, which failed 13-7 at the
last senate meeting.
At the meeting, some senators refused to reject
the change because they thought more student
input was needed, felt the bill was poorly written or
wanted to see the standard of proof lowered only for
sexual assault cases.
The new bill argues that the proposal violates the
ASSU Constitution, which grants an accused student
the right "to be considered innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt" in misconduct
cases. These cases include sexual assault and viola
tions of the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard.
No amendments can be made to the constitution
until the spring elections.
Since the first bill rejecting this change failed to
pass, senators said they have received more feed
back from students, many of whom do not support
the "clear and convincing" standard, Bone said.
Graduate senator Neil Crellin concurred, saying
his discussions with students have shown that "they
wish this (current) standard to be retained."
But undergraduate senator Lisa Demsky said she
favors the clear and convincing standard, although
she would like to see it used only in cases of sexual
misconduct.
"I don't think you can prove acquaintance rape
'beyond a reasonable doubt' unless you have wit
nesses," Demsky said, noting that the nuyority of
