## Speedy rowers win first race 
### Jobe Agodonuts 
Stanford men's and women's crew teams had
another successful weekend, combining to win five
gold medals at the Stanford Fall Regatta held here
on Saturday.
The varsity men, who split their first eight
man team into two four-man boats, swept the
event. One four won with a time of 14:28 over the
winding three-mile course, while the Cardinal's
other boat cruised in at 14:38, good for second
place.
The varsity men's eight-man race was left to
the JV boat, which rose to the occasion, fighting
Santa Clara around the turns to eke out a victory
in 13:19, two seconds ahead of the Broncos' crew.
Looking at the results, Coach Wieslaw Kujda com
mented, "I am pleased by the success of the JV
eight in the varsity event. This kind of perfor
mance will prepare them for varsity caliber racing
in the future."
The women also swept the varsity races. In the
varsity four race, Stanford defeated Cal by five sec
onds, winning in 16:37, while the varsity eight fin
ished a comfortable 13 seconds ahead of Cal's
crew.
"I am happy that we beat Cal in the fall, since
they start training so much earlier than we do,"
said women's coach Wendy Davis.
The freshman and novice rowers performed
well in their collegiate racing debut. The men's
frosh eights finished first and second in their race,
with times of 14:16 and 15:18, respectively. Cal
squeaked by with the win in the women's novice
eight race, but Stanford boats finished second and
third, in 17:52 and 17:53.
The outlook for the spring season is quite
promising. A strong group of seniors leads the
team, supported by a talented core of underclass
men on both the women's and men's teams.
The quality of rowing has improved a great deal
due to workouts in small-boats. This type of boat
encourages development of technical skills. In
addition, physical development is improving at a
rapid pace under the strict training regimen imple
mented by Coach Kujda, a former Polish National
Team oarsman.
Winter training will continue with high-intensi
ty endurance work and begin to develop the car
diovascular base necessary for two- thousand
meter racing. Dual meets begin in March. The
season is highlighted by the San Diego Crew Clas
sic, Potomac Invitational and Pacific Coast Cham
pionships.
