# Wrestlers challenge San Francisco State
## Experience fills ranks of Card's '91-'92 squad in fall opener 
### Larry Liu 
The Stanford University wrestling
team will open its season tonight at the
Farm with a dual meet against San
Francisco State. Finishing with a
strong showing at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships last year, the
Cardinal has much to look forward to
in 1991-1992.
Stanford capped off a solid season
in 91 by sending three wrestlers,
Steve Buddie, Steve Yarbrough, and
Matt Topham, to the NCAA Champi
onships. Though Buddie and
Yarbrough, both Pac-10 champions
who graduated last spring, will be
sorely missed, seniors Topham and
Mark Graham have stepped in as co
captains to lead this year's team.
Experience will definitely be an
asset for Stanford. Many returning
faces can be seen on this year's squad.
In fact, all of the starters for tomor
row's meet come from last year's team.
Lance Johnson, sth in the Pac-lOs, Jay
Jackson and Dave Sacks spearhead a
depth-filled lightweight contingency
against San Francisco State.
"The lightweights are pretty
tough," said head coach Chris Horpel,
who is entering his 13th season. "We
recruited some of the nation's top
lightweight juniors, but the veterans
have held on to their spots."
The team, which has been training
since the beginning of the year, seems
more than ready to take on San Fran
cisco State. Utilizing challenge match
es to keep the starters on their toes, the
Cardinal looks sharp and mentally pre
pared.
Horpel adds, "Emotion plays an
important role in the matches. It's
hard to duplicate during practices the

level of intensity fthe wrestlers! face in
a real match, but [the wrestlers] are
ready. .. We are technically superior to
[San Francisco State] and should come
out on top."
Since Stanford wrestling is a 100
percent self-supporting organiza
tion, it lacks the university funding
that other top-notch wrestling pro
grams receive. What the team lacks
in funds can easily be made up in fan
support.
Horpel stresses, "One way to help
the wrestling program is for the stu
dents to come watch the matches and
find out how interesting real

wrestling is. What we do is different
from professional wrestling, and we
need to remove the stigma that pro
wrestling has formed."

Matches will begin at 7 P.M. at
Burnham Pavilion in the Ford Cen
ter. Admission is free to all students
with their SUIDs.
