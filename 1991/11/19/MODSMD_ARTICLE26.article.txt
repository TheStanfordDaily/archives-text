Bowls, bowls, bowls. Bowls, bowls,
bowls, bowls, bowls, bowls. Bowls,
bowls, bowls, bowls, bowls, bowls.
Bowls, bowls, bowls, bowls.
Ever notice how if you say a word
enough times all the meaning drains out
of it? I just said "bowls" 19 times — the
exact number of college football postsea
son bowls that there are — and that word
seemed to dissolve into oblivion.
Kinda like how the bowls themselves
have been cheapened.
But it's not just because of their pro
liferation. God knows, I'm not going to
criticize that aspect of the bowl system
this year, since the Cardinal has grabbed
a spot in one of the many bowls that exist
today.
No, this has to do with something
much more fundamental than that. This
has to do with that dark, primal force at
work deep in the human psyche: greed.
I've been watching a lot of the specula
tion and maneuvering that has gone on
with respect to the placing of teams in
bowls, and frankly, I'm disgusted. I have
noticed two things in particular that
bother me about the system. One is the
effect of the involvement of television.
The other is corporate sponsorship.

The latter began in the early 80s with
the changing of the Sugar Bowl — one of
the original four bowls — to the USF&G
Sugar Bowl Classic. It became a trend
that swept the bowl system and culmi
nated with the recent creation of the
Blockbuster Bowl.
Corporate sponsorship has its advan
tages, of course. It helps keep the bowls
afloat, and it increases the payout to each
participating school. But it is so blatantly
a financial investment by the companies,
designed only to increase their own
wealth, that it makes me sick.
Sure, they are helping out the compet
ing schools and their corresponding con
ferences, but it is the way that they are
doing it that bothers me. Instead of, say,
supporting the lesser powers of the

NCAA directly, they are helping to per
petuate the state of imbalance in college
football's power structure while getting
easy national exposure.
That does increase the incentive for
other schools to reach bowls, but the fact
is that, even with 19 bowls, there is not
always room at the top, especially when
the top is so solidly entrenched.
Of course, some teams do manage to
break into the top. Two prime examples
this year are Stanford and California.
They are also excellent examples of how
the involvement of television has messed
up the bowl system.
In Stanford's case, the Cardinal was
looking at a Freedom Bowl appearance in
Anaheim. The Freedom Bowl people first
became interested when the Card was a
deceptive 1-3. They were psyched on us.
Our coaches and athletic department
warmed to them.
But their dream died when ABC
stepped in and persuaded the Aloha Bowl
to invite Stanford. So that's what hap
pened. What ABC says goes.
Mostly, that move was good for Stan
ford, as the Cardinal will be playing in a
more prestigious bowl against a better
opponent (in a more pleasant environ-

ment), and will receive more money.
A big network interfered with Cal's
bowl destiny as well, but unfortunately
for the Golden Bears it was for the worse.
Two things happened that pushed Cal
into a less prestigious bowl than it
deserves. First, the officials of the Sugar
Bowl, where the Bears should be playing,
decided that they would rather have
Notre Dame than Cal, despite the fact
that Cal was No. 6 and Notre Dame was
No. 12 when they decided on this.
Why? Because the Fighting Irish have
a Name, and because they will probably
garner better ratings (and thus more
money) for the Sugar Bowl.
This is absolutely criminal.
It gets even worse, because the Sugar
Bowl extended its invitation to Notre
Dame before the Irish's shellacking by

then-No. 8 Penn State. The Lions were
the next logical choice after Cal.
If the NCAA hadn't passed the "mini
mum six Division IA wins" rule, the Irish
would probably go to a major bowl every
year, regardless of record.
In any case, Cal's next bowl choice was
the Fiesta Bowl, which wanted the Bears.
No problems, right? Not so.
Since the Pacific 10 Conference bars
its members from playing in a bowl at the
same time as the Rose Bowl (to maximize
the Rose Bowl's ratings and profits), Cal
could not play in the Fiesta unless that
bowl changed its starting time. The Fies
ta folks said, "Sure, if it's okay with
NBC." NBC said, "Nope." The Bears
said, "Citrus Bowl, here we come!"
I don't know; maybe I shouldn't bitch
so much. Maybe I'm inflexibly conserva
tive and it's simply a matter of accepting
the new order. Bowls are not what they
used to be. They are not what I'd like
them to be. They are simply money-mak
ing machines.

dinal and white tie around his head and
screaming his vocal cords into shreds at
