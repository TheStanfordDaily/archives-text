With all the NCAA competitions and big
events last weekend it is hard to single out
only two. Yet there were two, two unexpect
ed performances, which deserve extra
recognition. Adele Moore chalked up her
first individual collegiate victory amidst the
chilly rain and wind of South Carolina.
Meanwhile, free safety Seyon Albert tack
led, created turnovers and even scored a
touchdown on a frosty Saturday afternoon

in Pullman, Wash.
At Hilton Head, S.C., Moore beat out
extremely stiff competition to win the Golf
World Collegiate. "The course had really
intimidating holes," Moore said. The senior
shot 72 and 77 on the first two days before
launching a major comeback on the final day
of competition. Starting six shots behind the
leader, she teed off on the difficult back nine
holes while the leader, Sofi Eriksson of
Tulsa, started on the easier front nine.
The wind picked up dramatically as
Moore headed out for the easier half of the
course. "I talked to people in the clubhouse
and they said I had a shot so I just kept on
plugging," Moore said. Despite worsening
conditions, Moore managed to shoot a 73.
She defeated Eriksson by one shot. "When
you are coming from behind there is less
pressure
"I've had a good fall season and this is a
very confident way to finish off," Moore said.
Head coach Tim Baldwin was also pleased
with Moore's performance. "Adele . . . was
fabulous. This was a primo tournament."
❖
The fall season may be coming to a close
for the golfers but for the football team, the
best is yet to come. Saturday afternoon
Seyon Albert gave Cardinal fans a taste of
what they can expect at Big Game and at
the Aloha Bowl.
In the second quarter, the 5-foot-11-
inch, 195-pound junior nailed Cougar quar
terback Drew Bledsoe, causing a sensation

al fumble in the end zone. He immediately
dove on the loose ball for a Stanford touch
down, putting the score at 14-7.
Albert also tallied eight unassisted tack
les against Washington State. With 59 tack
les already this season, Albert is about to
become the first non-linebacker to lead the
Cardinal in tackles since 1982. Last year as
starting free safety, the Phoenix native fin
ished second on the team with 79.
