# Cal sports gold axes all week in Berkeley

BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -
Around the neck of each member
of the California Golden Bears
football team hangs a golden
medallion in the shape of an ax.
"It's a little inspirational
thought," Cal quarterback Mike
Pawlawski said. "Everywhere I
go I'm going to be carrying the ax
with me. That's my mission this
week â€” to get the Axe back."
The Axe is the ceremonial
prize awarded to the winner of
the Big Game between Cal and
Stanford that remains in the vic
torious school's possession until
the teams play the following
year. The rivalry between Cal
and Stanford will resume for the
94th time on Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium.
Retrieving the Axe for Cal for
the first time since 1986 has
forced the Bears to throw their
No. 6 ranking and their invita
tion to the Florida Citrus Bowl
into the background of their
most successful season in 41
years.
California coach Bruce Snyder
and his coaching staff gave each
of the Bears the golden reminder
after the Bears beat Arizona
State 25-6 last week.
"It's just something symbolic,

something for the week," Snyder
said at his weekly news confer
ence.
For the first time in 40 years,
the Big Game will be played
between two nationally ranked
football teams. The Bears (9-1, 6-
1 Pac-10) are No. 6, while Stan
ford (7-3, 5-2 Pac-10) is ranked
No. 21 in the nation.
It's the first time in 13 years
that both teams come into a Big
Game with winning records.
For the first time, ABC-TV
will televise the game on a
national basis.
"Our team is really good in big
games," Pawlawski said. "And
this is the Big Game. Not just a
big game, but the Big Game."
The Bears have taken two dif
ferent attitudes into their two
biggest games so far this season.
Going into their game against
Washington, which they lost 24-
17, the Bears were keyed up.
Going into a game against
Southern Cal, which they won
52-30, the Bears were more care
free.
"We play our best football
when, it's not cavalier, but when
we're worry-free. When we're
worry-free we're a pretty damn
good football team."
