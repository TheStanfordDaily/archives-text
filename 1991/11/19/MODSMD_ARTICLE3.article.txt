# Two races for the presidency
## Stanford, UC may have to compete for top candidates

A Big Game of presidential proportions may have
begun Thursday when University of California Pres
ident David Gardner announced that he will step
down next fall.
Stanford and the University of California system
will now conduct presidential searches in the same
year, creating the possibility that the institutions
will court — and compete for — the same prospects.
"There is a limited pool of candidates for top aca
demic positions," said Association of American Uni
versities President Robert Rosenzweig. "There are
likely to be the same names considered at both places."
Gardner announced that he will resign Oct. 1,
1992, just weeks after Stanford President Donald
Kennedy has said he will step down. Gardner cited
personal reasons for his resignation.
Gardner has been president of the UC system,
whose nine campuses include UC-Berkeley and
UCLA, since 1983.
"I think it's clear that top candidates will be on

both places' lists," said Jean Fetter, executive vice
chair of Stanford's search committee.
The Stanford and UC presidencies are very differ

hands-on role, Rosenzweig said, requiring him or her
to deal with faculty and alumni on a daily basis.
The UC president deals primarily with the governor
and state and federal legislators. He or she does not run
a specific campus, and is responsible only for those
areas in which the campuses have a common policy.
But ultimately the search committees will seek
similar candidates, Rosenzweig said, looking at high
profile leaders of higher education who have political
savvy and public-relations skills.
"A lot of the talents desirable in the two positions
are interchangeable," Rosenzweig said.
Gardner, for example, was president of the Uni
versity of Utah before taking the helm of the UC sys
tem. Kennedy, with extensive experience in both
government and academia, would have been an
attractive candidate at a public university system as
