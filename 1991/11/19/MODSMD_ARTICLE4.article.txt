# Day-care investigation continues
## Probe has uncovered no evidence of child molestation 
### Lesley Edwards Staff writer 
The investigation of an alleged
child molestation incident at the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community — originally expected
to conclude last week — may con
tinue for "several weeks," Stan
ford Police Sgt. Del Bandy said in
an open letter sent to parents Fri
day.
"So far, our investigation indi
cates that a criminal molestation
did not [occur]," the letter said.
"However, there are several
avenues of investigation that we
wish to pursue before making a
final determination."
The allegation of molestation

involving a child and a teacher was
made on Oct. 31. The Children's
Center is a cooperative run by par
ents and teachers providing day
care services to 220 children rang
ing from infants to 5-year-olds.
"Based on a child's complaint
and corroborating non-verbal
behavior, the parents became con
cerned that there was a possibility
that the child had been molest
ed," the letter said.
"The responses of the 1 alleged)
victim in this case were valid and
there are some very real reasons
for concern," Bandy said yesterday.
It is possible that the child's
complaint was caused by a "mis
understanding of innocent behav
ior or miscommunication" on

behalf of the teacher who is under
investigation, the letter stated.
The teacher has been "placed
on administrative leave, as a mat
ter of standard procedure," the let
ter said. The alleged victim, how
ever, continues to attend the cen
ter, Director Nancy Golden said in
an earlier letter sent to parents.
Thus far, the investigation has
included a medical examination of
the alleged victim and interviews
of the people involved. Bandy
would not say what further mea
sures are going to be taken.
The letter said that if it is
found that there was no molesta
tion, police "will still continue to
determine what caused the child's
complaint."
