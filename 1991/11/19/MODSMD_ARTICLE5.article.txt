# Stanford study released
## Exploring life on the streets

When he grows up, one
homeless 12-year-old says,
"I'll do nothing, just sit
around, if I have a place to sit
around, if I'm not dead."
An 11-year-old girl dreams
of becoming a "lawyer, doctor
or engineer" but expects that
she will be "a bus driver" when
she grows up.
Despite this frustration,
homeless children are more
Likely to be compassionate than
hardened, because — according
to a Stanford study released
yesterday — "their hardships
seemed to give them a higher
level of compassion for human
suffering."
That was one of many con
clusions of the Stanford Center
for the Study of Families, Chil
dren and Youth, which con
ducted an exhaustive two-year
study in Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties.
The study was prompted by
a request from the Santa Clara
County Help House, the
Homeless Coalition and the
San Mateo County Hunger and
Homeless Action Coalition. It
was led by Sociology Prof. San
ford Dornbusch and partly
sponsored by the Walter S.
Johnson Foundation. Nine
related studies explored the
causes and effects of homeless

adolescents.

implications," said Dornbusch,
who led a group of seven faculty
members and 35 students in con
ducting the study.
The report determined that
families become homeless because
they have no outside relatives or
because living conditions are over
crowded when they live with their
relatives.
The studies found that nearly
90 percent of school-age homeless
are enrolled in school. Still, they
must overcome daunting obsta
cles including frequent changes in
schools and lack of transporta
tion.
One five-year-old walked alone
to a public transit bus stop every
morning, wearing a $13 bus pass
on a string around his neck. To
get to his second grade class, a
seven-year-old had to ride three
buses each morning.
According to the report, home
less children who live in "inappro
priate places" such as garages and
parks are more likely to suffer

chronic and acute illness.
Fatalistic attitudes Explaining
his failure to practice safe sex, one
asked, "Why would I worry about
dying from AIDS in the future
when I don't know if I'm going to
survive until tomorrow?"
The report criticized govern
ment and private action on behalf
of the homeless on several counts.
Among the criticisms:
• Access to subsidized housing
and other social support is limited
and arbitrary.
• Bureaucratic barriers and
poor organization deprive the
homeless of standard-quality
health care.
• Homeless teens stay away
from shelters because their par
ents, even if neglectful or abusive,
can obtain custody over them if
they seek social support.
Georgia Travis, the chair of the
Children's Committee for the
Help House the Homeless Coali
tion of Santa Clara County, added
that the project "shows how a dis
tinguished university and a con
cerned community" can jointly
overcome problems such as home
lessness, which she called a "daily
rebuke to every American."
