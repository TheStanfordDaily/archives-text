# Bonfire's pollution potential examined

Thursday's Big Game bonfire
has sparked a controversy over
the fire's pollution potential.
Mary Rozenberg, founder
and president of a Los Altos
organization called Burning
Issues, opposes Stanford's
upcoming bonfire in Lake
Lagunita's dry bed because she
says burning wood is too much
of a pollutant.
But Axe Committee chair
man Tim Yee doesn't believe
that the Bonfire will hurt the
environment or local residents.
"It's engineered for a clean,
fast burn," Yee said. The Axe
Committee coordinates the Big
Game rally and the bonfire.
Rozenberg said Burning
Issues was founded in January
to eliminate the use of wood as
a source of heat or fuel. The
group has 300 to 400 members,
she said.
"In view of today's environ
mental problems, the bonfire is
totally inappropriate," Rozen
berg said.
According to Yee, 3,500 to
4,000 wooden pallets measuring
approximately four feet by four
feet will burn for about an hour

during the bonfire. He said the
pallets are used because they
are made of dry, clean wood that
will burn fast and hot, not slow
and smoky like the logs com
monly used in fireplaces.
Yee emphasized that the
committee has even had to
refuse offers of wood from
other companies, such as
roofers, because their wood
contains contaminants.
Stanford Hospital lung spe
cialist Dr. Andrew Newman
warned that "wood burning is
a major source of air pollution"
and "any open fire will cause
air pollution."
However, Jon Erickson, a
staff member and adviser to
the Axe Committee, argued
that the air would only carry
the emissions for about a mile
south, over Stanford land
rather than a residential area.
According to a spokesperson
from the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District, no com
plaints have been filed in
recent years because of the
bonfire. She added that the
bonfire is not illegal and would
only be a problem if the district
received five complaints or
more.
