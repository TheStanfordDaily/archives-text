## Produce prices expected to skyrocket 
### Julia Sobrevilla Staff writer 
Those little white bugs that
have descended on California
have managed to take a bite out of
the produce supply on campus.
Price hikes in lettuce and other
produce may send Food Service
shopping for alternatives, and the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest may
need to look for a new mascot.
Already at Tresidder, costs
have increased. According to Bon
Appetit manager Mary Clark, the
whitefly is "absolutely driving
prices sky-high."
The price of a case of iceberg
lettuce has gone up from $15 to
$25 in the past two weeks, accord
ing to Robert Shaw, purchasing
manager of Stanford University
Food Services. Twenty-four heads
come in a case.
So far, Bon Appetit, which
manages Tresidder food services,
has not raised consumer prices,
but that is still a possibility.
Broccoli, carrots and cauliflow
er have been hit especially hard
by the bug. as have iceberg and
romaine lettuce, according to

Larry Haker. Haker is the sales
manager for Royal Fresh Foods
Inc., Food Service's main veg
etable supplier.
Iceberg has been the lettuce of
choice at Stanford. This is likely to
change if the whitefly plague keeps
spreading. Alternative choices are
greenleaf and romaine lettuce,
said Food Service Purchasing
Manager Robert Shaw, although
romaine is also a victim of the fly.
Debbie Kelly, manager of the
Toyon Eating Clubs, said the eat
ing clubs do not expect to be
greatly affected by the shortage
since they don't buy as many
fresh vegetables as other food ser
vice providers, opting instead for
frozen ones.
As the whitefly problem contin
ues, packed, canned or frozen veg
etables may be on the horizon for
more herbivores, who are a grow
ing population in the community.
In the past 15 years, Stanford's
intake of vegetables has increased
about 15 percent, according to
Shaw, who said, "vegetables are
being consumed more and more.
This year the consumption has
increased compared to last year's."
