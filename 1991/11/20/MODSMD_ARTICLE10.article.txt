# Refugees turned away
## Rangel accuses Bush administration of racism

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The
United States yesterday forced home 300
Haitians who fled in small boats after a mil
itary coup. But as Haitians kept fleeing, a
U.S. judge ordered the government to stop
the repatriation.
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter had picked up
the 300 Haitians after the Sept. 30 coup and
detained them aboard while the Bush
administration weighed what steps to take.
On Monday, it moved to return them to the
impoverished Caribbean country.
About 20 policemen looked on while
immigration officials processed the return
ing Haitians, who had risked their lives to
flee, many in frail vessels. Red Cross offi
cials said they would examine the refugees
and give them $10 each before they rejoined
their families.
The Haitians filled a green-ceilinged wel
coming area at the industrial docks. Many
sat listlessly, arms folded on their knees,
and others lined up for officials at tables.
One man on line wore a shirt that said
"Tahiti."
Outside, Red Cross workers helped one
refugee to an ambulance.
Said one refugee, who spoke on condition
of anonymity: "I've tried to leave before.
Every time I do, they catch me. I'm not
going to try again."
In Washington, State Department
Deputy Spokesperson Richard Boucher said
the refugees continued leaving Haiti despite
the U.S. decision Monday to return them.
The Coast Guard has picked up a total of
2,160 since the coup, he said.
Hours after the first group were
returned, U.S. District Judge Donald L.
Graham in Miami temporarily halted the
repatriation until another hearing Monday.

The Haitian Refugee Center in Miami
had challenged the repatriation, saying the
government failed to grant the refugees
their rights.
Haitians by the droves, many fearing
repression, have been fleeing after
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, their
first democratically elected president, was
toppled by the military. Many were
retrieved by Coast Guard cutters stationed
not far from Haiti's coast.
Nearly 500 are in U.S. custody at
Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and the rest are
aboard Coast Guard cutters. Venezuela,
Belize, Honduras and Trinidad and Tobago
had offered to take in at least 550 of the
Haitians, and U.S. officials said those held
at Guantanamo Bay will be sent to those
countries first.
After failing to persuade countries in the
area to provide shelter for more Haitians,
the State Department announced in
Washington that most of the Haitians were
being sent home, effective immediately.
The State Department says it believes
the refugees are fleeing Haiti for economic
reasons, not because they fear political per
secution. But members of Congress and
human rights officials have harshly criti
cized Washington, which itself sharply criti
cized Britain for forcibly repatriating
Vietnamese who had fled to Hong Kong.
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., accused the
Bush administration of racism, saying
Washington would have never turned back
fleeing Europeans.
Thousands of Haitians fled their country
in the years prior to the coup, during which
Haiti was usually under cruel military rule.
The United States usually did not recognize
the earlier boat people as political refugees.
