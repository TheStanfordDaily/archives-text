NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -
A flu outbreak is keeping so
many students and teachers in
bed that city schools were
closed yesterday through end of
the week.
School officials said this is
the first time the entire system
has closed because of illness.
Metro Health Director
Fredia Wadley said closing
schools, where nearly one
fourth of the system's 67,400
students were absent Monday,
will provide enough time for the
Type A Beijing flu to abate.
"It had all last weekend to
cool off, and that wasn't

enough," Wadley said Monday.
"By having this much ill
ness reported on Monday, we
saw the chances of it getting
higher during the week
extremely good, almost defi
nite," she said.
Nashville officials said that
absentee rates of 25 percent —
some schools reported more
than 40 percent absent — is the
normal trigger for giving
thought to shutting down the
school system.
Students suffering from
Type A Beijing flu are affected
by high fever, vomiting and
general aches and pains.
