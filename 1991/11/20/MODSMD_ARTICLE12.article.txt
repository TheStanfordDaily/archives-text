LOS ANGELES (AP) - A
study seems to link childhood
leukemia to power lines, hair dry
ers and black-and-white televi
sions.
Sponsored by the electric utili
ty industry, the five-year, $1.7
million study is the most compre
hensive yet conducted on the pos
sible but unproven health risks of
electromagnetic fields, or EMFs
— invisible force fields generated
by power lines, appliances and
everything electrical.
But the findings are somewhat
contradictory. The study found
that children who live close to
high-current power lines may

have twice the normal one-in
-20,000 chance of getting
leukemia. Yet actual 24-hour
measurements of EMFs in chil
dren's homes suggested only a
weak link between leukemia and
magnetic fields and no link
between the cancer and electric
fields.
"The current study adds some
support to the hypothesis that
electromagnetic fields increase
childhood leukemia risk, but it
doesn't resolve the controversy,"
said Dr. John Peters, a co-author
of the report and occupational
health director at the University
of Southern California.
