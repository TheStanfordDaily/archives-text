One student's activism
highlights the impact
of community service

WHEN COMMUNIST HARD
liners took over the Soviet
Union this summer, most
Americans watched in shock as
events unfolded on their living room
television sets. But Tom Boellstorff,
who graduated from Stanford in
June, watched the takeover from
inside the fractured country.
The primary mission of his jour
ney was to organize the Soviet
Union's first gay-rights groups
and to promote AIDS education,
but Boellstorff ended up making
other significant contributions
during his three-month stay.
During the coup, his two Macin
toshes and laser printer became
one of the few free presses in the
divided nation. Rather than hiding
underground, he put his computer
and his ideals to work for the Rus
sian resistance and published fliers
under the name of a gay newsletter.
Boellstorff's story is a com
pelling example of what one person
with courage and conviction can
do. He took something important
to him — gay rights and AIDS edu
cation — and set out to teach oth
ers in an area where fear and igno
rance prevail.
It is also an example of the way in
which Stanford touches the world.
In addition to his own funds,
Boellstorff was supported by a
Haas Public Service Summer Fel
lowship and the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center. In a
very direct way, Stanford made the
world a better place.
This is the primary reason the
University should think twice

about significantly reducing the
funding for the public service cen
ter. Currently, Haas pays for about
one-third of its operating costs
with foundation money; the rest
comes from the University.
Ultimately, the University
wants the center to be self-suffi
cient. This desire is understand
able, especially given the grim
financial climate.
But this desire is short-sighted.
The whole country is in a recession.
Public service and philanthropy are
among the first things to go when
people tighten their belts. To
reduce funding for the Haas Center
would be a typical, but tragic,
response to the current shortage.
In doing this, the University
would be saying that public service
like the sort Boellstorff performed
for the world, doesn't matter.
A better response than slashing
might be to look more closely at the
projects that cost money. If they
have the potential to make as great
an impact as Boellstorffs gay
rights efforts in the Soviet Union,
funding should be available.
If the projects are narrower in
scope, or cost a significant amount
of money for less significant con
tributions, other funding should
be sought. The students involved
could raise their own money
through a variety of activities, as
has been successfully demonstrat
ed by Greek-system philanthropy.
If cuts to public service must be
made, this principle of impact
should be kept in mind.
For Stanford to lose its broad
vision — service through educa
tion and education through service
— for the sake of dollars, much
more than programs and services
would be lost.
To close our eyes to others
would be to close our eyes to the
world.
