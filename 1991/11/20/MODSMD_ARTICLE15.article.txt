Coverage of student's death ignored human element

ON FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE
class I picked up The Daily hoping
to find a nice article about the
memorial service for Daniel Lichstein
that took place the preceding night.
Instead, I was confronted by the head
line, " 'This is nothing personal': Note
indicates alcohol as factor in death."
Obviously, this was not a simple
reflection on the death of a Stanford stu
dent, but an opportunity to point out the
evils of alcoholism.
I have no objection to the presenta
tion of alcohol as a factor in his suicide,
but the alcohol aspect of the article
seemed to go beyond the mere statement
of facts into the sensational. The article
on alcohol was featured in full length on
the front page before the memorial ser
vice article that briefly described friends'
thoughts and memories of Lichstein.
Alcohol and its effects have appeared
in other Stanford news (e.g. Stuart
Thomas, Theta Xi) and are serious

issues, but a student's death should not
be used as a tool to further emphasize
this point. Alcohol is a piece in the com
plexity of Lichstein's apparent suicide
but not the whole picture.
The headline presented a one-sided
view of Lichstein as an alcoholic and
overshadowed other qualities of the
man, such as his humor and compas
sion. Better coverage of the memorial
service would have provided a much
more balanced and accurate portrayal of
Lichstein as a person.
As journalists, Daily reporters have a
right to fulfill their duties to clarify and
promote understanding of events. But to
try to simplify Lichstein's death into
something understandable by focusing
on alcohol and alcoholism only succeeds
in trivializing his death.
Alcohol seems The Daily's attempt to
find an easy answer to a very complex
question. Searching for answers is some
thing many of Lichstein's friends and

families will go through, but it is not
something that should be hashed out in
the pages of The Daily.
Besides my personal offense to the
treatment of the alcohol issue, I also
found The Daily's actions as journalists
offensive. The Daily spoke to Prof. James
Fox, resident fellow of Toyon, but it seems
that many standard journalistic operating
procedures were not followed. The state
ment, "Lichstein's parents could not be
reached for comment," should have read:
"no attempt was made to reach Lich
stein's parents for comment."
I was upset by the lack of confidentiali
ty that seemed apparent in Fox's disclo
sure of personal and private information
about Dan in such a public manner. But
later I learned that the series of quota
tions from Fox were not offered state
ments, rather confirmations or denials of
his knowledge to posed questions. He was
not aware of the alcohol "side" of the note
until he was interviewed by the reporter.

When speaking with the writer, he con
firmed he had heard of the Branner inci
dent, but disclaimed any direct knowledge
of the details, referring The Daily to the
dean of students for such information.
At first I was apprehensive about how
The Daily was going to cariy the story of
Lichstein's death, but I soon found by
misgivings appeased by the initial cover
age, which was sensitive and fair. But
adherence to codes of fairness and ethics
as journalists should not be disregarded
in the face of a deadline or an opportuni
ty to "sell" a story.
The answers to Lichstein's death can
not be gleamed from misleading inter
views, beer bottles or pills. Even his clos
est friends are far from knowing all the
answers, so it is certainly not the role of
an impersonal, intrusive publication to
try to speculate on matters that no one
can begin to understand.
