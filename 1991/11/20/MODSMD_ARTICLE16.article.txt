# CIV encourages crucial re-examination of Western values
## 
### 
The Nov. 12 article about the Pro
gram in Cultures, Ideas and Values and
the Great Works track not only misrep
resented my comments but also misrep
resented the place of Great Works in the
CIV Program.
To write that the much-contested
switch to the CIV program "left few last
ing effects" is, in my opinion, totally
inaccurate.
First of all, while I did say that the
Great Works track could still incorpo
rate more non-Western authors into its
curriculum, I also went on at length and
in considerable detail to argue that it is
highly appropriate that the Great Works
track focuses primarily on the tradition
al canon of Western "classics."
The very title of the track itself
implies the choice of readings, and what

It is appropriate that Great Works studies 'Great Works'
including the implications of the quotation marks.

is new about the pedagogical approach to
teaching this canon is the way in which
we study it, the way in which traditional
Western values are called into question,
critiqued and decentered.
As a classicist I believe that close
study of such formative texts is one of
the most effective methods of coming to
understand Western ideas and values,
for only then can we critique them
knowledgeably and see their influence in
the modern world.
While, as a scholar of Greek and
Latin, I believe that "Great Works" have
much merit, it is also true that racism,

classism and sexism have their earliest
and strongest expression in much of
canonical Western literature, as well as
canonical non-Western literature.
Because the course title "Great
Works" is an age-old curriculum, it is
academically responsible to address the
traditional assumptions about what
makes a classic. We can do that best by
looking to these classics and the history
of their reception.
There are seven other tracks in the
CIV program in which to exercise the
CIV legislation. It is appropriate that
Great Works studies "Great Works"

including the implications of the quota
tion marks.
That is to say, we do not necessarily
concede that they are in fact great, but
that historically, they have been consid
ered great by the academy.
I also wish to add that while I am
quoted as saying that "the course is not
as radical as I had been led to believe,"
my statement in its entirety was that
the CIV program is not as radical as I
had been led to believe by the media cov
erage that this program has received.
The media tends to rely to excess
upon conflict and exaggeration to get the
reader's attention, and I regret that
some of my comments have been misun
derstood or only partially quoted.
