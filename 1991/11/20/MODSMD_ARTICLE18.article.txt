COURAGE AND HEROISM ARE
two words that have been used
quite frequently since Magic John
son's announcement of his HIV infection.
The world was instantly plunged into
shock and disbelief.
Newscasters once again put on their
sincere yet solemn faces; "I am so proud
that he is dedicating his life to the fight
against AIDS; I am so proud that he is still
thinking of others at a moment like this."
Everyone started to sing praise of the
Magic man: "Oh, what a special and mar
velous human being." Even President
Bush joined the crowd and invited Magic to
serve on the National Committee on AIDS.
I, like the rest of America, am saddened.
I sure will miss those on-court marvels.
But one question seems to creep up persis
tently. I try very hard to suppress it. Each
time I tell myself, "Have you no heart?
How dare you ask a question like this?"
But It just won't go away.
What qualifications does Johnson
have to be the spokesman for the fight
against AIDS, let alone serve on the
National Committee?
A famed basketball star — who lived
the life of a playboy and who didn't know
better than to get infected by the HIV
virus in the first place — has suddenly
dedicated his life to educate the all-igno
rant Joe Public. Thus, he has joined the
ranks of the recovered alcoholics who
now educate the public on alcoholism and

the former drug abusers who now teach
us to "Just say no."
The situation is all too familiar. Infection
and addiction are are their only qualifications.
It is hoped that with the signing of a
high profile individual like Johnson, the
fight against AIDS may get a big boost. It
indeed appears to be that way. After all,
everyone loves Magic.
We all marvel at the skills of this 6-foot
9-inch guard, who could dribble, score,
rebound and pass like no one before. So
with a bright star like Magic shining behind
the fight against AIDS, we should all be
able to see better than ever. Every wrinkle
and hair should be enlarged. The only ques
tion that remains is whether we can find
the issues that tag along with the flash.
The doubts about Johnson's qualifica
tions as an AIDS educator may well be
unfounded. Magic probably will do a
great job talking about AIDS; after all, he
has sold shoes quite well. He has exactly
the same qualification for both jobs.
I imagine from now on we will be see
ing Magic in AIDS-prevention commer
cials in addition to his shoe commercials.
We will be getting a lot of information
about AIDS from his commercials, just
like those "just say no" commercials. I
have learned to fry an egg. Will I learn to
make sausage this time?
However, what is sadder is not the
message lost, but the message transmit
ted. The style of presentation has become

far more important than the substance.
Without scare-tactic commercials, the
anti-drug campaign would never be
heard. Without shining stars like John
son, the AIDS issue will never be seen.
The campaign of "ignorance educa
tion" seems to be succeeding. Whether in
business or in politics, the most impor
tant substance has become image. It is
the commercials that a company airs and
the packaging that it designs and the
flags that a politician waves that deter
mine the success or failure of a company
or someone's candidacy.
However, the saddest of all is that the
public is letting the "ignorance educa
tion" succeed. We have thrown in the
towel and conceded defeat. We are weak
and helpless. Faced with such a mass of
lights and flashes, how can we not direct
our eyes and minds to follow?
But for Joe Public, to be infected by
ignorance is almost as deadly as being
infected by HIV. We need protection for
our minds as well.
