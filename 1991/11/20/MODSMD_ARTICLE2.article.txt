# Long fight for Native American Studies
## Search for professor continues; students hope for full program 
### Doug Miro Staff writer 
The University is attempting, slowly but
surely, to fill in the hole many Native Ameri
can students find when they open their copy of
Courses and Degrees.
The search for a tenure-track professor in
Native American Studies has narrowed, and
plans are underway, though not definite, to
secure funding for the position.
There are no tenured Native American pro
fessors at Stanford, and few courses in Native
American studies are offered. But many stu
dents, encouraged by progress made toward
securing a tenure track professor, hope for the
eventual development of an entire academic
program in Native American studies.
Last vear, Ewart Thomas, dean of the

School of Humanities and Sciences, formed a
committee to solicit candidates for a tenure
track Native American Studies professor.
According to committee chair Albert Gelpi,
an English professor, the seven candidates for
the position must now submit letters of recom
mendation and a sample of their academic writ
ing. Given the necessary funding Gelpi said, the
professor shoidd be in place by next September.
Native Americans on campus have pressed
for a tenure-track professor for about 20
years, according to Bill Bray, a Muscogee Indi
an and the graduate student representative on
the committee. "Since they first started bring
ing students here, it has been a priority with
in the community."
Despite community pressure, the search
did not begin until last year, according to
Sharon Parker, director of the Office of Multi

cultural Development.
"Historically there has not been the atten
tion paid to the issue because there have not
been that many Native American students on
campus," she said. "But for the last three
years there has been a critical body of Native
American students showing a strong demand
for Native American offerings and Native
American faculty."
Native Americans emphasize that a tenure
track professor is critical to their community
both as an academic resource and as a symbol of
the University's commitment to their culture.
Bray said, "A tenured professor symbolizes
the bedrock of the University, and you know
you're only peripheral to the University if your
professor is not funded by the endowment."
