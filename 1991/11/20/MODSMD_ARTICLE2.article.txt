# Long fight for Native American Studies
## Search for professor continues; students hope for full program 
### Doug Miro Staff writer 
The University is attempting, slowly but
surely, to fill in the hole many Native Ameri
can students find when they open their copy of
Courses and Degrees.
The search for a tenure-track professor in
Native American Studies has narrowed, and
plans are underway, though not definite, to
secure funding for the position.
There are no tenured Native American pro
fessors at Stanford, and few courses in Native
American studies are offered. But many stu
dents, encouraged by progress made toward
securing a tenure track professor, hope for the
eventual development of an entire academic
program in Native American studies.
Last vear, Ewart Thomas, dean of the

School of Humanities and Sciences, formed a
committee to solicit candidates for a tenure
track Native American Studies professor.
According to committee chair Albert Gelpi,
an English professor, the seven candidates for
the position must now submit letters of recom
mendation and a sample of their academic writ
ing. Given the necessary funding Gelpi said, the
professor shoidd be in place by next September.
Native Americans on campus have pressed
for a tenure-track professor for about 20
years, according to Bill Bray, a Muscogee Indi
an and the graduate student representative on
the committee. "Since they first started bring
ing students here, it has been a priority with
in the community."
Despite community pressure, the search
did not begin until last year, according to
Sharon Parker, director of the Office of Multi

cultural Development.
"Historically there has not been the atten
tion paid to the issue because there have not
been that many Native American students on
campus," she said. "But for the last three
years there has been a critical body of Native
American students showing a strong demand
for Native American offerings and Native
American faculty."
Native Americans emphasize that a tenure
track professor is critical to their community
both as an academic resource and as a symbol of
the University's commitment to their culture.
Bray said, "A tenured professor symbolizes
the bedrock of the University, and you know
you're only peripheral to the University if your
professor is not funded by the endowment."
Stanford currently has neither a
tenured professor in Native Ameri
can Studies nor a tenured Native
American professor. Anthropology
Lecturer Sharon Nelson-Barber is
Stanford's only regular Native
American instructor.
A Native American heritage is
not a qualification for the new
position, Gelpi said, but the pro
fessor will be expected to "work in
and with the programs of the
Native American community."
Commitment questioned
Many Native American stu
dents said Stanford needs not just
a professor but an entire Native
American Studies Program. "If
the agenda at Stanford were truly
multicultural, we would have a
Native American Studies Pro
gram," Bray said.
Phil Gover, a Choctaw-Pawnee
Indian, agreed, adding that Native
American faculty would also ease
the culture shock for Native
American students. "A Native
American studies department
makes you feel more at home
because you have some faculty
saying, 'We're here and we've
been able to do it and retain our
culture, you can do it and retain
your culture.' " he said.
Many students cited the large
Native American programs of
other schools, such as Dart
mouth, the University of New
Mexico and UC-Berkeley, as proof
that Stanford lags behind.
Bray, who received a minor in

Native American studies at Dart
mouth, said, "It says something
substantial about Stanford priori
ties that Dartmouth has had its pro
gram for 15 years or more."
Stanford's population of 135
Native American students is second
only to Dartmouth's among small,
private schools. But the University
is a long way away from attaining a
full-scale Native American studies
program like Berkeley's, which is
now entering its 21st year.
At Stanford, Native American
classes taught this year include a
history seminar on Native Ameri
cans in the 20th century, an
English class on Native American
folklore and an anthropology class
on Indians of North America.
Two years ago, a program
through the Linguistics Depart
ment offered Navajo, but the
course was eliminated due to bud
get cuts and low student interest.
A Native American Studies
Program would help the vast
majority of Native American stu
dents who plan to help their com
munities when they leave Stan
ford, students said.
Angelique Jackson, a Sisseton-
Wahpeton Dakota Indian, said
she needs "classes that pertain to
my background, my reservation
and my tribal government so that
I can go back and work in my trib
al government."
Without these classes, she said
she feels "as if I'm doing time to get
a piece of paper instead of learning
something relevant to my life."
A program could also provide
support to the graduate schools.
At the Law School, for example,
there are no classes in Native
American law.

Colin Hampson, a Winnebego
Chippewa Indian and second-year
law student who plans to go back
and work with his tribal govern
ment, said, "You come back (to
your community) more foreign
than when you left because you
haven't learned about what your
people are doing."
Many Native American students
said a program could also reduce the
burden they feel to educate other
students about their cultures.
"Coming to a place like Stan
ford, you would expect there to be
some kind of common under
standing," Jackson said. "But
without a studies program, there
is really not (a common under
standing) and that leads to an iso
lation and a burden for us to teach
the community."
While no plans are in the works
for a full Native American studies
program, Gelpi said, "Everybody
is hopeful. ..."
Gelpi added that final approval
of the professorship would be left
to the individual department in
which the professor will work.
Funding procedure uncertain
Because the Native American
community has been requesting a
professor for many years, some
students are worried that no
appointment will be made. Indeed,
funding for the appointment is on
shaky ground, especially in light of
recent budget cuts.
Susan Stephens, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences,
said, "Humanities and Sciences is
committed to completing this
search, and we don't want the
budget cuts to hinder it."
The funding issue is clouded by

the fact that the School of
Humanities and Sciences has not
yet requested the funding for the
professorship from Provost
James Rosse, who must approve
the appropriation.
Stephens said the request has
not yet been made because the
committee has not selected a candi
date. According to Stephens, the
provost "never commits to a job in
the abstract. He would much
rather commit to a certain person."
Originally, half the billet for the
professor was to be paid by the Uni
versity Affirmative Action Fund
and the other half by the individu
al department that appoints the
professor. However, because the
Affirmative Action Fund is being
revised by Rosse, it is unclear
whether this will be the case.
Kathy Gillam, assistant provost
for faculty affairs, explained that the
provost used to give grants on a case
by-case basis. The provost would
receive a request to fund a faculty
appointment from a school, review
the request and, if it is passed, pro
vide the billet from Stanford's cen
tral operating budget.
However, under the new sys
tem, the provost would allot each
school a grant that could be used
in an affirmative action context,
Gillam said.
According to Stephens, this
new funding system makes fund
ing for the professorship very
hazy. "Because we don't know the
details of the new set-up, we don't
know how that dovetails with an
appointment," she said.
Nevertheless, Stephens said,"l
would be very surprised if the
provost does not give us some
funds."

dents, encouraged by progress made toward
securing a tenure track professor, hope for the
eventual development of an entire academic
program in Native American studies.
Last vear, Ewart Thomas, dean of the

School of Humanities and Sciences, formed a
committee to solicit candidates for a tenure
track Native American Studies professor.
According to committee chair Albert Gelpi,
an English professor, the seven candidates for
the position must now submit letters of recom
mendation and a sample of their academic writ
ing. Given the necessary funding Gelpi said, the
professor shoidd be in place by next September.
Native Americans on campus have pressed
for a tenure-track professor for about 20
years, according to Bill Bray, a Muscogee Indi
an and the graduate student representative on
the committee. "Since they first started bring
ing students here, it has been a priority with
in the community."
Despite community pressure, the search
did not begin until last year, according to
Sharon Parker, director of the Office of Multi

cultural Development.
"Historically there has not been the atten
tion paid to the issue because there have not
been that many Native American students on
campus," she said. "But for the last three
years there has been a critical body of Native
American students showing a strong demand
for Native American offerings and Native
American faculty."
Native Americans emphasize that a tenure
track professor is critical to their community
both as an academic resource and as a symbol of
the University's commitment to their culture.
Bray said, "A tenured professor symbolizes
the bedrock of the University, and you know
you're only peripheral to the University if your
professor is not funded by the endowment."
Stanford currently has neither a
tenured professor in Native Ameri
can Studies nor a tenured Native
American professor. Anthropology
Lecturer Sharon Nelson-Barber is
Stanford's only regular Native
American instructor.
A Native American heritage is
not a qualification for the new
position, Gelpi said, but the pro
fessor will be expected to "work in
and with the programs of the
Native American community."
Commitment questioned
Many Native American stu
dents said Stanford needs not just
a professor but an entire Native
American Studies Program. "If
the agenda at Stanford were truly
multicultural, we would have a
Native American Studies Pro
gram," Bray said.
Phil Gover, a Choctaw-Pawnee
Indian, agreed, adding that Native
American faculty would also ease
the culture shock for Native
American students. "A Native
American studies department
makes you feel more at home
because you have some faculty
saying, 'We're here and we've
been able to do it and retain our
culture, you can do it and retain
your culture.' " he said.
Many students cited the large
Native American programs of
other schools, such as Dart
mouth, the University of New
Mexico and UC-Berkeley, as proof
that Stanford lags behind.
Bray, who received a minor in

Native American studies at Dart
mouth, said, "It says something
substantial about Stanford priori
ties that Dartmouth has had its pro
gram for 15 years or more."
Stanford's population of 135
Native American students is second
only to Dartmouth's among small,
private schools. But the University
is a long way away from attaining a
full-scale Native American studies
program like Berkeley's, which is
now entering its 21st year.
At Stanford, Native American
classes taught this year include a
history seminar on Native Ameri
cans in the 20th century, an
English class on Native American
folklore and an anthropology class
on Indians of North America.
Two years ago, a program
through the Linguistics Depart
ment offered Navajo, but the
course was eliminated due to bud
get cuts and low student interest.
A Native American Studies
Program would help the vast
majority of Native American stu
dents who plan to help their com
munities when they leave Stan
ford, students said.
Angelique Jackson, a Sisseton-
Wahpeton Dakota Indian, said
she needs "classes that pertain to
my background, my reservation
and my tribal government so that
I can go back and work in my trib
al government."
Without these classes, she said
she feels "as if I'm doing time to get
a piece of paper instead of learning
something relevant to my life."
A program could also provide
support to the graduate schools.
At the Law School, for example,
there are no classes in Native
American law.

Colin Hampson, a Winnebego
Chippewa Indian and second-year
law student who plans to go back
and work with his tribal govern
ment, said, "You come back (to
your community) more foreign
than when you left because you
haven't learned about what your
people are doing."
Many Native American students
said a program could also reduce the
burden they feel to educate other
students about their cultures.
"Coming to a place like Stan
ford, you would expect there to be
some kind of common under
standing," Jackson said. "But
without a studies program, there
is really not (a common under
standing) and that leads to an iso
lation and a burden for us to teach
the community."
While no plans are in the works
for a full Native American studies
program, Gelpi said, "Everybody
is hopeful. ..."
Gelpi added that final approval
of the professorship would be left
to the individual department in
which the professor will work.
Funding procedure uncertain
Because the Native American
community has been requesting a
professor for many years, some
students are worried that no
appointment will be made. Indeed,
funding for the appointment is on
shaky ground, especially in light of
recent budget cuts.
Susan Stephens, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences,
said, "Humanities and Sciences is
committed to completing this
search, and we don't want the
budget cuts to hinder it."
The funding issue is clouded by

the fact that the School of
Humanities and Sciences has not
yet requested the funding for the
professorship from Provost
James Rosse, who must approve
the appropriation.
Stephens said the request has
not yet been made because the
committee has not selected a candi
date. According to Stephens, the
provost "never commits to a job in
the abstract. He would much
rather commit to a certain person."
Originally, half the billet for the
professor was to be paid by the Uni
versity Affirmative Action Fund
and the other half by the individu
al department that appoints the
professor. However, because the
Affirmative Action Fund is being
revised by Rosse, it is unclear
whether this will be the case.
Kathy Gillam, assistant provost
for faculty affairs, explained that the
provost used to give grants on a case
by-case basis. The provost would
receive a request to fund a faculty
appointment from a school, review
the request and, if it is passed, pro
vide the billet from Stanford's cen
tral operating budget.
However, under the new sys
tem, the provost would allot each
school a grant that could be used
in an affirmative action context,
Gillam said.
According to Stephens, this
new funding system makes fund
ing for the professorship very
hazy. "Because we don't know the
details of the new set-up, we don't
know how that dovetails with an
appointment," she said.
Nevertheless, Stephens said,"l
would be very surprised if the
provost does not give us some
funds."
The University is attempting, slowly but
surely, to fill in the hole many Native Ameri
can students find when they open their copy of
Courses and Degrees.
The search for a tenure-track professor in
Native American Studies has narrowed, and
plans are underway, though not definite, to
secure funding for the position.

fessors at Stanford, and few courses in Native
