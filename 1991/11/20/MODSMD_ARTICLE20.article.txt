Elimination of Doctorate
of Musical Arts would
prove short-sighted
It has been brought to my attention
that the Music Department at Stanford
is thinking of cutting its Doctor of Musi
cal Arts (D.M.A.) program because of the
impending budget cuts. As a Stanford
alumna, I am writing to oppose such a
cut.
I received a D.M.A. in early music
performance practice in 1979. What
drew me to the Music Department at
Stanford was its philosophy that to
understand music fully you cannot sepa
rate analysis from performance.
Historically, very few musicians were
solely performers or scholars. The best
known musicians pursued many activi
ties: They composed, they wrote essays
on instruments and style, they studied
and translated theoretical works, they
built instruments and they taught — not
only music, but often Latin, mathemat
ics and other subjects. They were musi
cians in the most complete sense.

Stanford's D.M.A. program in perfor
mance practice is one of the few in
North America that has made a point of
integrating performance with research
and scholarly work. It has produced
well-rounded musicians who have a
thorough and integrated understanding
of their craft.
Dozens of these D.M.A. graduates
have gone on to hold jobs in academic
institutions all over the country. As
D.M.A.s they have the knowledge and
means to teach music history, theory
and performance practice, to direct the
Early Music Ensemble and to teach and
perform on their instruments.
Many have produced recordings and
won awards. Many others have gone on
to publish books that have often grown
out of their D.M A. projects, with publish
ing houses such as Indiana University
Press and Cambridge University Press.
The D.M.A. program is a unique com
ponent of the Music Department at
Stanford, one that could be further
strengthened and refined and continue
to educate "complete" musicians. The
best music-making is one that reflects a
synthesis of scholarship and perfor-

mance skills, and the Music Department
at Stanford is in a unique position to
offer that synthesis.
To cut the D.M.A. program to accom
modate budget cuts would be extremely
short-sighted and an unwise decision.

Are budget woes so grave
that the University can't
even afford a typewriter?
Yesterday I went to Meyer Library to
type an application and was startled to
learn that all the typewriters have been
removed from the library. When I
inquired as to where I might have access
to a typewriter, I was told that because
of budget cuts, none of the libraries pro
vides typewriters for student use.
I find it hard to believe that the main
tenance cost of a few typewriters can be
so prohibitively expensive. Considering
that Stanford has a student body of
more than 13,000 people, it is incompre-

hensible that not a single typewriter is
available for student use.
Stanford provides hundreds of com
puters for student use (to its credit), but
there are some things that have to be
done on typewriters, like filling out
applications or forms. How can Stanford
afford so many computers yet not have
the resources for a few typewriters?
If the University is in such dire eco
nomic straits that it cannot provide a
few typewriters for student use, then
our problems are much more serious
than they initially appeared.

Let me comment briefly on the cur
rent Committee of 15 proposal to amend
the Judicial Charter. I was the chair of
the Committee of 15 in 1967-68 when
the Judicial Charter was drafted, then

chair of the Student Conduct Legislative
Council in 1969-70 and a member of the
SCLC during 1970-71. My comments are
derived from those experiences.
First, charges that serious misdeeds
were done necessitate serious protections
for the accused. That is why the Judicial
Charter requires — and should require
— proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Second, the District Attorney's office
can deal with a crime like rape better
than the University can. The criminal
justice system has better forensic tools
and skills. It can subpoena witnesses,
and it can impose jail terms.
