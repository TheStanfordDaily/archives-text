## Heisman hopes on hold Though injured, Milburn helps team to bowl bid 
### T.C. Hall Senior staff writer 
It was not supposed to be like this. If everything
had gone according to plan, preseason Ail-American
halfback Glyn Milburn would be anticipating a call
from the Downtown Athletic Club of New York ask
ing him to sit in a suit and wait for his name to be
called as the winner of the Heisman trophy. He
would once again be the best all-purpose football
player in the country.
The scenario was perfect. The season has not
been.
Sidelined with a knee injury in the second game of
the season against Arizona, Milburn's body and sea
son were forced to slow down. Milburn kept on play
ing, but had to watch as Tommy Vardell became the
backfield star. He watched again as Ozzie Grenardo
found glory returning kick-offs, and a return game
that used to be a one-man show suddenly had two
stars. Everything was supposed to be so perfect, but
nothing went according to plan.
"It's been an up and down season," Milburn said.
"Getting injured in the second game of the year kind of
put me off track. It has been a rebuilding kind of year;
I'm back to where I started from. Every week I'm play
ing better and getting my mind back on the game."
For Milburn, success is a relative word. Though
the junior from Santa Monica has not lived up to all
the preseason hype, he has certainly not fallen off
the face of collegiate football. Going into Big Game,
Milburn is third in the Pacific 10 Conference and
14th nationally in all-purpose running with an aver
age of 138.30 yards a game. He is also second in the
Pac-10 in punt returns, and 10th in receptions. It is
not like last year when he averaged 222 yards a game
in all-purpose running to lead the country, but Stan
ford is more than happy with what he is giving.
"Glyn Milburn is doing a lot of special things for
us this year with his receiving and returning," said
Cardinal head coach Denny Green. "He has played
well and had a solid year, not the kind of season he
had last year, but if you are not healthy all year then
that's the way things come out."
People expect a lot from Milburn. The focus of the
Stanford offense last year, he provided fans with
breathtaking runs and big gain after big gain. The
great runs still come, but not as often as many
thought they would.

"When Glyn breaks a 35-yard return people go
'Ohhh'; they expect him to break the long run every
time," backfield mate Tommy Vardell said. "Expec
tations for Glyn are ridiculous, both for himself and
from other people. He's done a great job this year, I
watch what he does and keep shaking my head. I still
can't believe some of the things he does."
Milburn's exploits of a year ago caught the college
football world by storm, and led to a wave of media
attention. Following his Pac-10 record 379 all-pur
pose yards in last year's Big Game, Milburn was
named to the all-conference team and became every
body's 1991 Ail-American. Stanford was supposed to
be good, and Milburn was to lead them. There was
even talk about the Heisman, an award that had not
been seen on the Farm since Jim Plunkett won it in
1970. With the attention came pressure.
"All the Heisman talk, the Ail-American talk; I let
it get to me the first couple of games," Milburn said. "I
wasn't performing to my standards, and I was getting
down on myself — I was giving in to the pressure."
Early in the season Milburn was not doing well,
and the team wasn't, either. After an 0-2 start, the
Cardinal upset Colorado, but then was clobbered by
Notre Dame 42-26. It was a big loss, and a turning
point for Milburn.
"After the Notre Dame loss I cleared my mind of
everything," Milburn said. "I decided I had to play
the best I could play. There was no more pressure or
anything, I was right back to where I started last
year when no one knew me."
Blank mind and all, Milburn went back to work,
and the success started to come. In the Oregon State
game Milburn scored three times, including a 92
yard touchdown reception. Going into Big Game,
Milburn is still a player to be feared.
"He is a great talent," said California head coach
Bruce Snyder. "You hold your breath when Glyn has
the ball because you know he can go the distance."
In the multi-faceted Stanford offense, Milburn is
a useful weapon. He has been instrumental in the
Cardinal's 7-3 record and invitation to the Aloha
bowl. After arriving in a year when Stanford went 3-
8, this season has turned out to be a very satisfying
experience after all.
"It has really been a thrill to experience the tran
sition the team has gone through," Milburn said.
"To arrive at a low point and see gradual and steady
progress has been great."


Al Green — Daily file
Though Glyn Milburn has had to battle injuries and the pressures of stardom this season, he is still
posting impressive numbers. He is currently third in the Pac-10 in all-purpose yardage. Milburn and the
rest of the football team are preparing for Saturday's Big Game showdown with Cal.
