Well, its Big Game Week
once again, and I'll be
answering the questions
you have sent in about this won
derful time of the year. So let's
get started.
Q: Wasn't there once a Bearial on
Monday of Big Game Week, in
which a stuffed teddy bear was
impaled on top of the Claw foun
tain?
A: Yes, that used to be done, but
we got a few calls from angry ani
mal rights activists who com
plained about the cruel imagery
of the tradition. In order to avoid
offending them we stopped the
Bearial.
Q: I heard that there used to be a
show called Gaieties which poked
fun at virtually everyone in the
Stanford community. Did this
really happen?
A: It really did, but we found that
Gaieties dragged down school
morale by pointing out Stanford's
flaws. In addition, certain groups,
like fraternities and sororities
were discriminated against in the
show — while Gaieties had Greek
jokes or scenes every year, some
dorms, especially Flo Mo, were
rarely mentioned. And there was
so much profanity used! Gaieties
just couldn't be a part of Stan
ford's future, no matter how long
it had reared its ugly head in
Stanford's past.
Q: What in the world was the Sin
goff?
A: Oh, singing groups from Stan
ford and Cal used to get together
and entertain a crowd of people
from both schools. Of course, that
was back when we had singing
groups at Stanford, before we cut
the performing arts and talented
people in drama and music
stopped coming here.
Q: How about the Axe and the
Axe Yell? My dad told me some
thing about them.
A: Yes, we used to have those
things, but no longer. Environ
mentalists protested that Stan
ford should not have an axe head
— which was used to destroy
poor, helpless trees and ruin our
planet — as a symbol of the rival
ry with Cal. Furthermore, even
though the axe was not a toma
hawk and was not a Native-Amer
ican symbol, a few idiots were
using it like it was one. For these
two reasons we axed the Axe. As
for the yell, people who had
ancestors decapitated in the
French Revolution wrote letters
expressing angst over the "right
in the neck" line of the cheer. So,
that had to go too.
Q: Now what about this bonfire

thing?
A: That whole affair was kind of
strange. Some random person
called us and told us that wood
burning stoves were dangerous to
the environment. We then asked
some professors, who told us that
the temperature of the bonfire
and the way it was built made it
far less damaging then normal
fireplace burning. But we listened
to the first person anyway.
There was also the issue of

being insensitive to those who
had lost their homes in the Oak
land Hills fire. We didn't really
care that Cal had had bonfires for
the USC game and Big Game that
year, both of which took place
after the Oakland disaster. Nor
did we worry that the bonfire had
been a tradition for almost 100
years and had the the sole pur
pose of raising Stanford spirit,
not attacking Cal. We just banned
the big blaze.
Q: Didn't we used to have a dif
ferent nickname?
A: Yes, we were called the "Cardi
nal", but complaints from both
religious groups and furious
artists who said that our school
color was actually vermilion
forced us to drop "Cardinal". We
looked around, but we couldn't
find a nickname that didn't
offend anybody, so we finally
decided on what we call ourselves
now — the Stanford Stanfords.
But we might have to drop "Stan
ford" — we're still getting com
plaints.
Q: What the heck is LSJUMB?
A: That was a bunch of trouble
makers who ran around campus
masquerading as musicians.
They were always exposing them
selves and offending alumni with
their humor, which was always in
poor taste. They had to go. The
wonderful band we have now,
with its high-stepping drum
major, precise formations and
sharp military uniforms, is so
much better than the bunch of
hooligans we used to have.
Q: Wasn't there once a football
game on Saturday of Big Game
Week?
A: Yes, but football was such a
violent sport, and all that compe-
