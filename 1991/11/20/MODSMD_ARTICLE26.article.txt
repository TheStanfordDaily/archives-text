# Keefe and Co. anticipate hoops season
## 
### Nat Cousins Senoir staff writer 
The 1991-92 men's basketball season
opens Friday with the rallying cry, "Get the
ball to the open Keefe."
Keefe, a preseason All-American, could be
playing in the NBA, but thankfully for Stan
ford he's still lacing his sneakers on the
Farm.
"Keefe is a nice starting point," coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He can get as many
points as the defense will allow. He's our
security blanket — capable of getting 30
points every night."
Keefe and the Cardinal tip off the regular
season Friday at 6 p.m. against Loyola Col
lege (Baltimore) in the first round of the
Apple Invitational. The winner will play Rice
or Pacific Saturday at 8 p.m.
Keefe averaged 21.5 points and 9.5
rebounds per game last year, leading Stan
ford to a 20-13 record and the National Invi
tational Tournament title. In the Pacific 10
Conference, the Cardinal finished in a five
way tie for fifth with an 8-10 mark.
But the other four starters who helped
Stanford defeat Oklahoma 78-72 in the NIT
final are gone. Keefe will be accompanied by
young, inexperienced players who need to
grow into the job — quickly.
Stanford is ranked No. 42 in the Associat
ed Press preseason poll, but the Pac-10
coaches and most polls have predicted an
eighth place league finish for the Cardinal. A
preseason prospectus for the Cardinal:
•King Keefe returns. The prospects for the
season would be a little different, to say the
least, if Stanford's noble power forward had
ventured forth to the NBA.
Keefe will be double-teamed, triple
teamed, boxed, battered and bitten by oppo
nents. Nothing new for him.
"That's not the fun part of the game —
getting the snot beat out of you," Keefe said.
"It comes with the territory inside. If you
want to score 20 points, you have to take a
licking and keep on ticking."
Although Keefe was slowed by a presea
son calf injury, he is stronger and faster than
last year and will be aided by his summer
Pan Am game experience.
When Keefe gets the ball on the blocks, he
is unstoppable. Stanford's game plan will be
to get Keefe open and get him the ball. The
victories and a fifth consecutive postseason
berth will follow.


Sophomore forward Brent Williams drives for the basket in the Cardinal's most recent
exhibition game. The inexperienced Stanford squad hopes to have the answers to many
early-season questions this weekend as the hoopsters host the Apple Invitational.
