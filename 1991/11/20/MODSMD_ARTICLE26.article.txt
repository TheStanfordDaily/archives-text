# Keefe and Co. anticipate hoops season
## 
### Nat Cousins Senoir staff writer 
The 1991-92 men's basketball season
opens Friday with the rallying cry, "Get the
ball to the open Keefe."
Keefe, a preseason All-American, could be
playing in the NBA, but thankfully for Stan
ford he's still lacing his sneakers on the
Farm.
"Keefe is a nice starting point," coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He can get as many
points as the defense will allow. He's our
security blanket — capable of getting 30
points every night."
Keefe and the Cardinal tip off the regular
season Friday at 6 p.m. against Loyola Col
lege (Baltimore) in the first round of the
Apple Invitational. The winner will play Rice
or Pacific Saturday at 8 p.m.
Keefe averaged 21.5 points and 9.5
rebounds per game last year, leading Stan
ford to a 20-13 record and the National Invi
tational Tournament title. In the Pacific 10
Conference, the Cardinal finished in a five
way tie for fifth with an 8-10 mark.
But the other four starters who helped
Stanford defeat Oklahoma 78-72 in the NIT
final are gone. Keefe will be accompanied by
young, inexperienced players who need to
grow into the job — quickly.
Stanford is ranked No. 42 in the Associat
ed Press preseason poll, but the Pac-10
coaches and most polls have predicted an
eighth place league finish for the Cardinal. A
preseason prospectus for the Cardinal:
•King Keefe returns. The prospects for the
season would be a little different, to say the
least, if Stanford's noble power forward had
ventured forth to the NBA.
Keefe will be double-teamed, triple
teamed, boxed, battered and bitten by oppo
nents. Nothing new for him.
"That's not the fun part of the game —
getting the snot beat out of you," Keefe said.
"It comes with the territory inside. If you
want to score 20 points, you have to take a
licking and keep on ticking."
Although Keefe was slowed by a presea
son calf injury, he is stronger and faster than
last year and will be aided by his summer
Pan Am game experience.
When Keefe gets the ball on the blocks, he
is unstoppable. Stanford's game plan will be
to get Keefe open and get him the ball. The
victories and a fifth consecutive postseason
berth will follow.


Sophomore forward Brent Williams drives for the basket in the Cardinal's most recent
exhibition game. The inexperienced Stanford squad hopes to have the answers to many
early-season questions this weekend as the hoopsters host the Apple Invitational.
•Frontcourt. Sophomore center
Jim Morgan will be carrying a lot
of weight on his slender shoulders.
Injured for much of last season,
the 6-foot-ll pivotman will be
counted on to take pressure off
Keefe inside.
"He's going to have to produce.
It's time. This is what he came
here for," Montgomery said. "He'll
find himself under a little closer
scrutiny (from Montgomery) this
year.
"Jim is only a problem because
he's a nice kid. He's a kid every
mother would love. But we need to
get a few mothers not to like him.
He needs to get a demeanor on the
floor — knock somebody down —
be more aggressive."
Talented 6-6 sophomore swing
man Brent Williams, who will

start at the other forward position,
will also need to assert himself.
"He could be a great player, but he
never has been yet," Montgomery
said.
Savvy 6-9 junior Paul Garrett,
6-7 road warrior Jason Weaver
and versatile 6-7 freshman Andy
Poppink will come off the bench.
•Backcourt. Quick and slick
junior Marcus Lollie will start at
point guard and be counted on to
run the team. Lollie was a steady
contributor last year, averaging
4.3 points and 3.6 assists per game
as he played in a three-guard rota
tion with John Patrick and Kenny
Am man n.
Although he is shooting just
38.7 percent from the floor for his
career, Lollie will be counted on to
execute the offense, push the ball
up the floor and keep the team
composed. He'll need to improve
his 66.7 percent free throw shoot
ing and avoid erratic stretches.
Peter Dukes, a 6-5 junior, will

start at shooting guard and pop
the trey, his specialty.
"Dukes will be a key for us — he
can really shoot the ball," Mont
gomery said. "He's always been
injured, but at times he's been one
of our best players."
Explosive Kenny Hicks will be
the third part of the guard rota
tion. Hicks, who scored a game
high 16 points in Stanford's first
exhibition, has high-octane scoring
skills, but needs to be more consis
tent. Montgomery may use him in
a three-guard alignment at times.
•The schedule. Stanford has
mixed challenging and patsy oppo
nents in the non-conference sched
ule in preparation for a rugged
Pac-10 race which includes Ari
zona and UCLA, both ranked in
the top 10 nationally.
"You try to protect yourself
early," Montgomery said. "(Ideal
ly) I might not want so much com
petition at the beginning of the
season."

Consecutive games against Col
orado, Santa Clara and Virginia
will force Stanford to play to its
potential early. A back-to-back jam
session against Southern Utah
and Cal-State Northridge in Jan
uary should give Stanford momen
tum heading into the Pac-10
schedule.
However, the most important
game of the season for basketball
historians is a Dec. 27 showdown
with Siena, which knocked third
seed Stanford out of the first round
of the NCAA tournament in 1989.
•The court. Sparked by the Mir
acles of Maples, inspiring upsets of
national power Arizona in 1988
and 1989, Maples Pavilion has
been a palace of pain the past four
seasons. With a bouncing floor,
psycho students on the sideline
and the non-color-coordinated
band on the baseline, Stanford has
recorded a 60-13 mark the past
four years.
However, drawing big crowds

— especially students — in the
early season may be a chore for the
NIT champions. The Apple Invita
tional competes with Big Game
festivities, Colorado comes to town
during Thanksgiving break and
Santa Clara and Virginia play
Stanford during winter vacation.
•Intangibles. Stanford will miss
energizing forward Andrew Vla
hov. Vlahov was a tenacious take
charge player who dove on the
floor, commanded teammates and
opponents alike and never backed
down.
"We have people as physical and
people who know the game just as
well (as Vlahov), but no one with
the combination of the two," Keefe
said.
•The coach. Montgomery enters
his sixth year at Stanford with a
record of 100-57 on the Farm. In
13 years as a head coach, he has
never had a losing season and
Stanford has reached the postsea
son the past four years in a row.
