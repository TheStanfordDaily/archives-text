While the men's basketball team prepares
for the start of the 1991-92 season, coach
Mike Montgomery is busy building for future
seasons at the same time.
Montgomery announced Tuesday that
two high school seniors have signed national
letters of intent to attend Stanford. Darren
Allaway, a 6-foot-8, 225-pound forward from
Hopkinsville, Ky., and Dion Cross, a 6-2,
170-pound guard from Little Rock, Ark., will

join the Cardinal next season.
"We wanted guys who could come in and
play â€” not have to wait three years," Mont
gomery said. "We feel like it was a very good
year."
Allaway has lived most of his life in Lon
don, but since moving to Kentucky two years
ago, has led his University Heights Academy
team to two Class A state championships. As
a junior he averaged 9.3 points and 8.2
rebounds per game.
"Allaway is a big, strong, physical kid with
a frame to get a lot stronger," Montgomery

said. "He looks intimidating, can mix it up
inside and run the floor too. He's the big guy
we wanted."
Cross averaged 13 points, four
rebounds and three assists last year for a
Parkview High School team that has had
all five starters sign letters of intent to
Division I schools. Cross, who plays both
guard spots, shot 59 percent from the
floor and 82 percent from the free throw
line as a junior.
"Cross has great range and is a big time
talent," Montgomery said.
