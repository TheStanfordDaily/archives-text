# Card Grapplers skin Gators
## Wrestling team opens season with home victory 
### Larry Liu Staff writer 
In its first meet of the year, the Stanford
wrestling team powered its way to a 29-16
victory over San Francisco State last night
at Burnham Pavilion.
The Cardinal dominated from the start
and never relinquished its lead. Led by
strong performances in the lightweight
division, Stanford jumped out to a 20-0
advantage. Phil Nowick(llB pounds) and
Jay Jackson(l34) took down their oppo
nents in technical falls by scores of 18-3
and 15-0 respectively. Lance Johnson( 142)
also helped with a major decision over the
Gators' James Jeunelot while Dave Now
ick(l26) won by forfeit.
"Like we expected, the lightweights
were tough," said head coach Chris Horpel.
"They performed really well."
Co-captains Matt Topham and Mark
Graham sealed the Cardinal victory with
wins in the 167- and 190-pound weight
divisions. Topham won his bout by a score
of 14-9 and was never threatened during
the match. Graham finished things off on a
positive note, coming up with two near pins
in the second period and recording the only
pin of the entire meet late in the third peri
od.
The match was scored by giving points
for the outcome of each individual match. A
pin or forfeit is worth six points, and a tech
nical fall(when a wrestler scores a 15 point

advantage over his opponent) yields five
points. A major decision — winning by
eight to 14 points — scores four points, and
a decision — winning by one to seven
points — three points. Matches that end in
a draw are worth two points for each team.
Horpel was generally pleased with the
team's overall performance. "Our people
definitely had the right attitude, giving
their maximum effort. We could have
slowed them down better in the begin
ning, but lour wrestlers'] attitudes were
excellent. In my book, that means every
thing."
With the first meet jitters out of the
way, the team can now focus more on its
actual match strategy. Horpel hopes the
wrestlers can use momentum to more suc
cessfully perform their techniques. Along
with skill and an iron-tough will, this
ingredient will help make a more complete
wrestler.
The team will now prepare for its next
dual meet against UC-Davis. Stanford's
last meeting against them (in the 1990-91
season) resulted in a 38-7 victory, but
Davis poses to be a tougher challenge for
Stanford this year. Its younger wrestlers
have done well in previous tournaments
and will test the Cardinal veterans. But
Horpel feels confident that, with a little
fine-tuning, the Cardinal should emerge
victorious from the encounter.
Davis and Stanford will face off Friday
at 7:30 p.m. The meet will be held at Davis.
