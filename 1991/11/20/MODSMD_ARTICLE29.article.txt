## AIDS drug study draws criticism 
### Kimberly Chrisman Staff writer 
Is AIDS money being squan
dered at Stanford?
A poster put up around cam
pus by the San Francisco
branch of the AIDS Coalition
To Unleash Power (ACT UP)
urges students to voice their
opposition to an upcoming
study at the Medical Center,
calling it unnecessary and
unethical.
The study will be sponsored
by the AIDS Chemical Trial
Group (ACTG), a branch of the
National Institutes of Health
and a primary recipient of fed
eral AIDS research funding.
The two-year study, scheduled
to begin in January, will test
the combined effectiveness of
three drugs — AZT, ddl and
ddC — on HIV-positive subjects
who have not developed AIDS.
According to the poster,
these drugs are "extremely
toxic" and "already understood
to be only fairly effective
against HIV." The poster criti
cizes the ACTG for spending
money on approved drugs of
questionable efficacy instead of
researching promising experi
mental therapies that could
benefit people with full-blown
AIDS as well.
But David Katzenstein, co
chair of the study and assistant
professor of medicine and infec

tious diseases at the Medical
School, defends his research as
a necessary step toward AIDS
prevention in asymptomatic
patients — HIV-positive
patients who have not yet
developed AIDS symptoms.
"The presumption among
people with HIV is that two
drugs may be better than one,
but that's an untested hypothe
sis," he said. "The question is,
which drug therapy is the best?"
AZT has already been proven
to alter the progress of AIDS in
asymptomatic patients, and
combination therapy is com
mon among those who can
afford it. Katzenstein hopes that
by proving the efficacy of combi
nation therapy, the ACTG study
will give indigent patients access
to multiple drugs.
The test is the ACTG's
largest to date, monitoring
21,000 subjects at a cost of
$6,000 per patient per year —
approximately the cost of one
year's worth of drugs and treat
ment for HIV. Even with the
pharmaceutical companies
donating the drugs, the test
will consume $12 million of the
group's yearly budget of $60
million.
"Their budget is going down,
but the number of people with
AIDS is increasing," ACT UP
member Jason Hey man said.
"We're trying to make sure
that this money is not wasted."
