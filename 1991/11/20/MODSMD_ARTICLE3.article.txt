# Lost: Requests for ASSU refunds
## 
### Carla Martin 
Approximately 500 student
requests for ASSU fee refunds
were lost from the computers in
Meyer library last week due to a
lack of communication between
Meyer staff and the ASSU.
The snafu occurred when net
work administrators at Meyer
deleted the data from their file
server, believing the information
had already been compiled by
ASSU officials.
Amy Tzon, the computer man
ager at Meyer and Tresidder,
attributed the problem to a lack of
communication and coordination.
"We were never communicated
with," she said. "We were asked to
set up the program, but we were
never told it was finished."
Tzon said she found out
through advertisements in The
Daily that the deadline for
requesting fee refunds had
passed, so she purged the file
servers containing the ASSU data
to make room for course servers.
