# Lost: Requests for ASSU refunds
## 
### Carla Martin 
Approximately 500 student
requests for ASSU fee refunds
were lost from the computers in
Meyer library last week due to a
lack of communication between
Meyer staff and the ASSU.
The snafu occurred when net
work administrators at Meyer
deleted the data from their file
server, believing the information
had already been compiled by
ASSU officials.
Amy Tzon, the computer man
ager at Meyer and Tresidder,
attributed the problem to a lack of
communication and coordination.
"We were never communicated
with," she said. "We were asked to
set up the program, but we were
never told it was finished."
Tzon said she found out
through advertisements in The
Daily that the deadline for
requesting fee refunds had
passed, so she purged the file
servers containing the ASSU data
to make room for course servers.
Later she received a call from
ASSU financial manager Michael
Risch requesting the files con
taining students' names, identifi
cation numbers and fee-refund
requests, but they were already
deleted.
Risch, who was responsible for
computerizing the fee-refund pro
gram, agreed that the incident
was caused by a lack of communi
cation. "There wasn't really an
understanding between us â€” that
was the main problem," Risch
said.
"The only understanding was
that we would use [their server]
and then compile the data at the
end. I didn't even tell them an
ending date," he said.
The ASSU is now asking stu
dents who entered their fee
requests at Meyer to re-enter the
information at the ASSU busi
ness offices by Friday.
Council of Presidents member
Beth Morgan said the ASSU is
depending on ads in The Daily to
notify those who originally
requested a fee refund at Meyer
but still have not reapplied at the
ASSU office.
Risch said the computers
will work efficiently next quar
ter. This fall, the data that was
entered at Meyer was stored on
the Meyer computers, Risch
said. But next quarter Risch
plans to have the fee-request
information stored at the ASSU
office, which should reduce the
risk of another such error.

Students will be able to make
computerized fee requests from
Meyer or Tresidder computers
which will be connected directly
to the ASSU via SUNet, the
campus-wide computer net
work.
"Rather than going to I Meyer
or Tresidder] and using their
servers, students would be going
there and using our server,"
Risch said.
Risch said he is working on a
system that will allow the ASSU
to continue using Meyer and
Tresidder computer facilities,
while taking the administrative
burden off the Meyer and Tresid
der staff.
"We don't want to overburden
them," Risch said. "Apparently
that happened this quarter."
The computerized fee-refund
program requests students'
names and ID numbers. By using
the program, students can peruse
a list of organizations that
received money from ASSU fees
and decide which ones they do not
want to fund.
The ASSU will then reimburse
the student for the portion of the
quarterly fee the group would
have received.
This was the first year applica
tions could be processed on com
puters. In past years, students
filled out applications by hand,
and a cashier at the ASSU dis
persed the money.
Morgan said computers were
introduced this year to make sort
ing information easier, and to
allow the ASSU to mail checks to
students, rather than checking
IDs as students come to claim
their refunds.
