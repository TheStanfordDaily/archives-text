, When I am infatuated with a
KY • woman, 1 find it much harder
to form a mental image of her face
than of the faces of other people 1
know. I once discussed this phe
nomenon with a male friend of mine,
who admitted that the same thing
happens to him. Are we both
mutants, or does this happen to most
people?
A. Remembering and recognizing
• faces is a complex process that
most people take for granted. Your
brain probably has special "circuit
ry" for remembering faces. In other
words, your brain doesn't distin
guish faces the same way it tells an
apple from an orange or a tree from
a dog.

The right side or hemisphere of your brain is supe
rior to the left side when it comes to perceiving and
recognizing faces. The right side is also best at inter
preting facial emotion. The right hemisphere controls
the left side of your body, so it's no surprise that the
left half of the face is more emotionally expressive
than the right half.
The left hemisphere can remember faces but does
so in a different way. In fact, the left brain is better at
remembering famous faces.
There is much more to remembering a face than
evoking a picture-perfect image. The police sketch
artist wants a picture-perfect image. He wants details
of identifying features such as face shape, hairline,
nose and chin.
However, in social interactions, humans spend
much more time looking at each other's mouths and
eyes in order to gather non-verbal clues. That is, peo
ple look at what a face is doing, not just at its struc
ture. So, can a good witness describe the perpetrator's
mouth and eyes accurately? Not necessarily. Many
people have trouble remembering the eye color of
even a close friend!
Why this problem? One answer may be in the qual
ity of the memory. Memories are oflen much more
subjective — more than just pictures. When you try
to "picture" a loved one's face, your "image" may be
one of feelings and non-visual memories.

Try this simple experi
ment. Try to form a mental pic
ture of an extremely embarrass
ing or an extremely romantic
memory. I bet you'll be unable to
recall a simple, clear image.
Another answer may be
that extreme arousal interferes
with recall. Crime victims are less
able to recall details of an inci
dent. The more upsetting the
incident, the more trouble a per
son has remembering details.
This doesn't mean a victim for
gets. Quite the contrary — the
event is often impossible to for
get. The memories are simply
non-pictoral.
Remember a situation in
which you were extremely ner
vous, for example, speaking in
front of a large group. Afterward
you may have felt that you were
out of touch during your speech.
You may have had difficulty pic
turing the audience, even

though you were staring right at them. Your anxiety
during the speech interferes with later memory
retrieval.
I mentioned before that the left brain can take
over for the right brain in recognizing faces. Some
unlucky people are afflicted with a rare disorder
called prosopagnosia. This defect is rare because spe
cific injury must occur to both hemispheres of the
brain.
Prosopagnosiacs have normal perception abilities
but defective processing or recall. They are unable to
recognize their own faces or faces of loved ones. They
can distinguish between a car and a hearse but cannot
recognize their own car. They can tell a bird from a
dog but cannot recognize their own pet dog in a group
of dogs.
I don't think you are a mutant or a prosopagnosi
ac. Maybe the woman of your dreams makes you too
aroused to be able to remember details of her face.
Perhaps your memory of her is more subjective. Does
thinking about her bring on memories of torment,
desire, lust, lovesickness, ecstasy, delirium, prurience
and passion?
Rest assured — you're probably not the only one
that suffers these sorts of memory lapses. On a cam
pus full of raging hormones, there's bound to be oth
ers afflicted with this problem. Good luck with your
love interest, and may she have the same difficulty
picturing your face!
