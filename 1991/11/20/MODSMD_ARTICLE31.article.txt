# Discovery may lead to diarrhea vaccine

A recent finding about the behavior of a
diarrhea-causing bacterium may lead to
improved treatment and prevention of diar
rhea, a leading cause of death among chil
dren in developing nations.
An estimated 4.6 million children and 1
million adults die annually from diseases
associated with diarrhea. Most of these
fatalities are in Third-World countries.
Previous research has shown that one
type of diarrhea-causing bacterium,
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, attacks
the mucous membranes of the intestine in
large groups. However, these bacteria,
when growing in other environments such
as contaminated water, grow as individual,
isolated organisms.
Stanford scientists have recently learned
that the way in which these bacteria behave
and grow is a result of their ability to mon
itor changes in their environment.
Dr. Gary Schoolnik, associate professor
of medicine, and his colleagues discovered
that when these E. coli "realize" they are in
a host, they react by sending out hundreds
of long, thin filaments called pili that inter
twine to form rope-like structures.
Bundles of these filaments from sepa
rate bacteria bind not only to the intestine
but also to other bacteria, forming three
dimensional meshworks in which the bacte
ria become embedded. These "squadrons"
of bacteria then become tethered to the
mucous membrane cells that line the intes
tine.
Bacteria "realize" that they are in a host
by sensing changes in such environmental
conditions as sodium chloride levels, acidi
ty and oxygen availability, according to
Schoolnik. A change in environment causes
these cells to start sending out pili and
binding to each other.
Schoolnik thinks this response must
have developed through the process of nat
ural selection; that is, the bacteria devel

oped this ability to bind together and
attack a host because that ability increased
the organisms' chances for survival.
"We believe that their capacity to use
these filaments to form a tight-knit com
munity of organisms may give the bacteria
a tremendous survival advantage when liv
ing on mucous membranes â€” which for the
bacteria are an inherently hostile environ
ment," Schoolnik said.
Although it has been known for nearly
40 years that this particular type of E. coli
causes diarrhea in humans, the bacteria's
differential behavior based on the envi
ronment had never before been studied.
The bacteria's ability to form meshworks
by binding to one another is a new discov
ery.
Although there are many diarrhea-caus
ing organisms, enteropathogenic E. coli are
responsible for a significant portion of diar
rhea-related deaths. Schoolnik estimates
that between 500,000 and 1 million deaths
a year can be attributed to enteropathogenic
E. coli. For unknown reasons, these bacteria
are more prevalent in urban areas than in
rural areas.
Schoolnik, his colleagues Alice Sik Yue
Ho and Jorge Giron, and scientists else
where are now working to understand how
the bundles of bacteria actually work to
cause the diarrhea.
Preliminary investigation suggests that
as a bacterial colony grows, bacterial genes
produce proteins that interact with the
intestinal cells. These proteins apparently
cause the cells to change their shape and
lose their absorptive abilities. The bundles
of filaments may facilitate this process by
promoting the tight attachment of the bac
terial colony to the intestinal cells.
'This change in the architecture of the
cell may be the step that alters the cell's
function and leads to the diarrheal dis
ease," according to Schoolnik.
Understanding the formation of these
bundles and how these bacteria affect the
intestinal cells' absorptive abilities may

lead to the formation of a vaccine against
this diarrheal agent.
"We're engaged in an effort to pluck out
the genes from the organism that alter the
function of the intestinal cell while leaving
those genes that encode the filaments,"
Schoolnik said. "This would create a living,
attenuated strain that would form colonies
and then attach to the small intestine, but
would do so in an innocent and harmless
way."
Because a host's immune response is
triggered in part by the presence of the fil
aments, the researchers are working to
genetically engineer a strain in which genes
that code for pili formation are very active
but other genes that code for disease-caus
ing proteins are inactive.
This new "crippled" strain could be used
as a vaccine, because it would stimulate a
strong immune response within the intes
tine, "where the real contest between the
host and the parasite occurs," Schoolnik
said.
"It's a deliberate enterprise in genetic
engineering," he said.
Clinical trials of an engineered strain are
not too far off, according to Schoolnik.
Human trials will be conducted at Stan
ford, and Schoolnik himself intends to
ingest the engineered strain to see if it
serves as an effective vaccine.
According to Schoolnik, developing a
vaccine for diarrhea caused by entero
pathogenic E. coli is, for the time being, a
more practical approach than trying to pro
vide everyone in Third-World countries
with clean water. Contaminated water is
one of the main ways that diarrhea-causing
organisms are transmitted.
According to Schoolnik, "80 percent of
the world's population lives in developing
countries. Creating a 'Palo Alto' environ
ment in these places is not easy; it requires
a huge economic infrastructure. Unfortu
nately, providing clean water and adequate
health care to the Third World is decades
away."
