# Stanford gears up for Smokeout
## 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
That will be one of the messages tomorrow at the
American Cancer Society's 15th annual "Great
American Smokeout," a one-day event designed to
encourage people to stop smoking. Smokers are
encouraged to give up the habit for the day in the
hope that they will quit permanently.
This year, for the first time, the Health Improve
ment Program and Cowell Student Health Center
are coordinating an effort to help members of the
Stanford community give up smoking. At Stanford,
it is estimated that about 15 percent of the faculty
and 10 percent of students smoke.
The American Cancer Society reports that about
25 percent of people quit permanently after quitting
for the one-day Smokeout. Because most people
attempt to quit smoking eight to 10 times before
they succeed, the annual Smokeout serves as a reg
ular reminder to try to stop smoking.
Some of the scheduled events and available fea
tures include:
• A free smoking cessation program titled "Living
Without Smoking." This six-session class will be

held Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-6:30 p.m. in
room 146 of Meyer Library. To register, call Lora
Maloof at 725-4406;
• Free "Quit Kits." These kits, available to any
smoker who wants to try to quit for the day, include
quitting tips, materials, postcards and stickers.
They also include treats such as drinks, food, gum,
mints, cinnamon sticks and peanuts to serve as sub
stitutes for cigarettes; and
• Free "Adopt-A-Smoker Kits." These kits are for
friends of smokers and include "adoption papers,"
tips on helping friends to quit, quitting tips and gum
to give to friends who are trying to quit.
Everyone who participates will be entered into a
raffle for prizes including T-shirts and gift certificates.
All of the programs will take a light-hearted
approach to quitting.
"We're not taking a highly intensive approach,"
according to Maloof, a health educator at the Center
of Research and Disease Prevention's Health
Improvement Program. "No black lungs will be
shown in any of the materials. We're not out to scare
people; we're just trying to help them."
Kits are available at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, the Office of Student Activities in Tresidder
Union and 1000 Welch Road.
