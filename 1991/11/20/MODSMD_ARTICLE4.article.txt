# Senate rejects 'proof' revision
## 
### Andy Dworkin Katie Mauro Staff writers 
The ASSU Senate last night
passed a bill ensuring that "beyond
a reasonable doubt" will remain
the burden of proof used in Uni
versity judicial proceedings.
After two hours of debate, the
senate voted 12-8 to accept gradu
ate senator Doug Bone's bill,
which states "the proposed
changes to the Stanford Legisla
tive and Judicial Charter . . . are
unconstitutional and unwarrant
ed and hereby rejected."
The bill blocks a proposal by
the Committee of 15 to change
the burden of proof from the cur
rent "beyond a reasonable doubt"
standard to a new "clear and con
vincing evidence" standard.

The Committee of 15 is a faculty,
staff and student committee which
is the only body authorized to pro
pose Judicial Charter amendments.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said the Judicial Charter "clearly
states" that ASSU Senate approval
is needed for any amendments.
"In some sense, we're back to
square one," she said. Cole did not
know if the committee would
attempt to draft new changes or
abandon attempts to amend the
charter.
In discussion before the vote,
Bone urged the senate to pass his
bill. "What we're talking about
here is a change to some of the
fundamental judicial rights stu
dents have been granted," he said.
"The very rights that the C-15
change would usurp are the ones
the students fought so hard for 20
years ago."
But Deborah Rhode, author of
the Committee's proposals, said
the proposed change in the bur
den of proof "grew out of con
cerns expressed by the students."
Speaking in the open forum
portion of the meeting, Rhode
urged the senate to reject Bone's
bill and said students should
"think about the people who
aren't accused but are abused by
the current system" and avoid the
"visceral, knee-jerk reaction of
students to always think of them
selves as the person accused."
Bone's bill was his second
attempt to block a change in the
burden of proof. His first bill was
voted down two weeks ago in a
heated late-night senate meeting.
Undergraduate senator Jason
Hyatt said two major changes
from Bone's original proposal led
him to support the bill.
First, Hyatt said, "the harsh
language has been taken out." In
addition, Hyatt pointed to a letter
signed by six student members of
the Committee of 15 encouraging
the senate to return the burden
changing proposal "for further
discussion and revision."

Think about the peo
ple who ... are
abused by the cur
rent system.'
— Deborah Rode

Rhode pointed out that last
year, the Committee of 15 had
unanimously passed the proposal
to reduce the burden of proof.
The students who wrote the letter
are new to the committee this
year, she said.
As in the debate two weeks
ago, much time was spent
attempting to amend the bill.
The senate spent a half hour
debating an eventually unsuc
cessful amendment to hold a spe
cial election on the issue winter
quarter. The amendment, pro
posed by graduate senator Eliza
beth Wahl and undergraduate
senator Ron Brown, failed by an
12-8 vote.
Graduate senator Casey Coop
er then successfully proposed an
amendment to the bill which
passed. It states, "Although the
ASSU Senate is keenly aware of
the problems associated with
prosecuting sexual assault cases
with the Judicial Affairs Office,
insufficient evidence has been
advanced to justify C-15's recom
mendation to lower the burden of
proof."
