# Tuition remission policy is reviewed
## Serious consequences if agreement is cut 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The scope of Stanford's indi
rect-cost controversy has recently
expanded, threatening the status
of perhaps as many as one-third of
all graduate students at Stanford.
When the federal government
reduced Stanford's indirect-cost
recovery rate to 55.5 percent and
terminated close to 100 financial
agreements with the University
last April, one so-called "memo
randum of understanding" was
left untouched — the one secur
ing tuition remission.
Tuition remission is the partial
reimbursement of the tuition of
graduate students involved in
government-sponsored research.
The University collects the funds
through the staff-benefits pool,
which includes all costs related to
staff involved in research.
Stanford, MIT, Columbia and
Caltech are the only universities
that continue to use tuition
remission. Most other universi
ties either charge students'
tuition as a direct cost of individ

ual research projects, or in the
case of many public universities
with lower tuition, charge little, if
any, to the government.
Tuition remission has recently
come under fire from various gov
ernment agencies — including the
Office of Naval Research, repre
sented at Stanford by its outspoken
on-campus regulator Paul Biddle.
For now, the practice contin
ues. Rear Adm. William Miller,
the head of naval research, guar
anteed the University in writing
that it would be allowed at least
through this fiscal year.
Norm Hanson, a spokesman for
the Office of Naval Research, said
the federal Office of Management
and Budget has been commissioned
to "review and clarify the rules" on
tuition remission. "Until that is
done, the universities can continue
to use" the practice, he said.
Because tuition remission "has
not yet been addressed," it will be
"a minimum of two years" before
any changes would be implement
ed, Hanson added.
A spokesman for OMB declined
to comment on the current review
of tuition remission, but Phil
Rogers, a spokesman for the
Defense Contract Audit Agency,
said his agency is conducting a
"benefits review" of tuition remis
sion for OMB.
"Under the (existing federal
indirect) cost guidelines, tuition
remission may possibly be consid
ered a cost that is not reim
bursable," Rogers said. He
refused to comment further and
said Biddle is the person "most
knowledgeable" about the prac
tice.
University officials defended
tuition remission as both cost
effective and essential to graduate
education and warned that chang
ing the reimbursement method

would likely have drastic conse
quences.
Dean of Research Bob Byer
said a study by MIT estimated the
university would lose about 25
percent of its graduate students if
the practice of tuition remission
were ended, and Stanford faculty
have predicted a similar outcome
here.
If tuition remission is ended, it
is likely Stanford would be forced
to add the tuition of graduate stu
dents to the direct cost of a
research grant or pay for stu
dents' tuition itself.
Because graduate-student
tuition is more costly than post
doctoral salaries, "the University .
. . would be forced to reduce the
number of graduate students and
change the way research is being
done here," Byer said.
"The number of post-doctoral
researchers would increase . . .
and Stanford would become a
post-graduate institution."

Byer also pre
dicted that a
change would
"add one more
barrier to the flex
ibility that stu
dents now enjoy"
to shift from one
research project
to another.
"Once you tie

graduate students to a specific
project by making their tuition a
part of the direct grant, there is a
reluctance to allow them to
change projects," Byer said.
But Biddle has recently come
forward with claims that the prac
tice of tuition remission is "some
what unacceptable."
"The tuition for doctoral candi
dates is paid for by taxpayers'
money, whatever that tuition is,"
Biddle said, adding that because
the University claims graduate
student tuition as a staff benefit,
it becomes similar to salaries.

"And if you are
going to call it
compensation,
then the Univer
sity should be
withholding the
required taxes,"
he said.
Stanford should
either return the
tuition recovered

through the staff benefits pool for
the last 10 years, or the graduate
students whose tuition was paid
through this practice should be sub
ject to taxes and penalties, Biddle
said.
"Will Stanford pay back the
money or will it force the students
to pay taxes?" Biddle said. "Will it
protect its own self-interests or
protect its own students?"
Biddle estimated that about 25
percent of the entire staff-bene
fits pool would be refunded if
tuition remission were retroac
tively canceled for the last 10

years — a cost of approximately
$180 million.
Biddle was quick to point out
that these were his "own views"
on tuition remission, and spokes
men for the three relevant gov
ernment agencies declined to con
firm or comment on his allega
tions.
But Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten said tuition
remission "is a practice followed
by a number of other schools . . .
that has been approved by the
OMB and Adm. Miller.
"I do not understand what
IBiddle's] concerns are when the
head of his own agency has put in
writing that the practice can con
tinue," Van Etten said.
Van Etten added that he has
"no way of knowing where Bid
die's numbers are coming from"
because he has "seen nothing in
writing from any government offi
cial." Van Etten has estimated
that changing the practice of

tuition remission might cost the
University up to $12 million for
this fiscal year.
Van Etten and Byer also
acknowledge that Stanford would
probably become less competitive
in seeking research grants if
tuition were included in the direct
cost, because most other universi
ties either have lower tuition or
use fewer graduate students in
research.
Although both Van Etten and
University President Donald
Kennedy have said repeatedly
that they believe tuition remis
sion will continue, Byer was a bit
more pessimistic.
"I think that it is a 50-50 chance
that tuition remission will
change," Byer said. "We have to
work really hard to build up sup
port and convince the faculty and
deans to write letters explaining
the importance of tuition remis
sion to graduate-student education
and research."
