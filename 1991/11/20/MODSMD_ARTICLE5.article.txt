# Tuition remission policy is reviewed
## Serious consequences if agreement is cut 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The scope of Stanford's indi
rect-cost controversy has recently
expanded, threatening the status
of perhaps as many as one-third of
all graduate students at Stanford.
When the federal government
reduced Stanford's indirect-cost
recovery rate to 55.5 percent and
terminated close to 100 financial
agreements with the University
last April, one so-called "memo
randum of understanding" was
left untouched — the one secur
ing tuition remission.
Tuition remission is the partial
reimbursement of the tuition of
graduate students involved in
government-sponsored research.
The University collects the funds
through the staff-benefits pool,
which includes all costs related to
staff involved in research.
Stanford, MIT, Columbia and
Caltech are the only universities
that continue to use tuition
remission. Most other universi
ties either charge students'
tuition as a direct cost of individ

ual research projects, or in the
case of many public universities
with lower tuition, charge little, if
any, to the government.
Tuition remission has recently
come under fire from various gov
ernment agencies — including the
Office of Naval Research, repre
sented at Stanford by its outspoken
on-campus regulator Paul Biddle.
For now, the practice contin
ues. Rear Adm. William Miller,
the head of naval research, guar
anteed the University in writing
that it would be allowed at least
through this fiscal year.
Norm Hanson, a spokesman for
the Office of Naval Research, said
the federal Office of Management
and Budget has been commissioned
to "review and clarify the rules" on
tuition remission. "Until that is
done, the universities can continue
to use" the practice, he said.
Because tuition remission "has
not yet been addressed," it will be
"a minimum of two years" before
any changes would be implement
ed, Hanson added.
