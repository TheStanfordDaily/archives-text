# Political radicalism of '71 gone, but legacy remains
## Activism now manifested in other ways

Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond of a two-part series examin
ing the atmosphere on the Stan
ford campus 20 years ago.

When Jonathon Dedmon, a
Stanford junior in 1971, took a
course called "Melville and Marx,"
he knew he was in for something
different.
Taught by Bruce Franklin, a
Maoist English professor who
later became the only tenured
professor Stanford has ever fired,
the course was an unlikely mix of
whales and the working class.
One of teaching assistants for
the class was also Maoist, Ded
mon said, and "when the part of
the course about T.S. Eliot came
up, he just said, 'Eliot is irrele
vant to the working class' and
talked about something else."
It was indicative of the atmo
sphere on the Stanford campus in
1971 — demonstrations and sit
ins were nothing unusual, leftist
groups dominated the political
scene and even some traditionally
staid academics got involved in

"the movement."
According to Dedmon, the fac
ulty on the whole were left of
center and anti-war, although
"there weren't too many Marxist
types" like Franklin.
Franklin was the founder of

two student groups — the Penin
sula Red Guards and the Revolu
tionary Union — that advocated
the use of armed violence to speed
the overt hrow of "imperialism."
Richard Lyman, who was
University President from 1970

to 1980, suspended Franklin
with pay Feb. 13, 1971 and asked
for his dismissal, pending the
decision of a seven-member fac
ulty advisory board.
Lyman's decision was based
on two incidents. On Jan. 11,

I'm glad it's all over.
Many of us still carry
scars from that peri
od .... Things have
definitely changed
greatly for the better.'
