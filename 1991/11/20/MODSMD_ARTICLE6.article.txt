# Political radicalism of '71 gone, but legacy remains
## Activism now manifested in other ways

Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond of a two-part series examin
ing the atmosphere on the Stan
ford campus 20 years ago.

When Jonathon Dedmon, a
Stanford junior in 1971, took a
course called "Melville and Marx,"
he knew he was in for something
different.
Taught by Bruce Franklin, a
Maoist English professor who
later became the only tenured
professor Stanford has ever fired,
the course was an unlikely mix of
whales and the working class.
One of teaching assistants for
the class was also Maoist, Ded
mon said, and "when the part of
the course about T.S. Eliot came
up, he just said, 'Eliot is irrele
vant to the working class' and
talked about something else."
It was indicative of the atmo
sphere on the Stanford campus in
1971 — demonstrations and sit
ins were nothing unusual, leftist
groups dominated the political
scene and even some traditionally
staid academics got involved in

"the movement."
According to Dedmon, the fac
ulty on the whole were left of
center and anti-war, although
"there weren't too many Marxist
types" like Franklin.
Franklin was the founder of

two student groups — the Penin
sula Red Guards and the Revolu
tionary Union — that advocated
the use of armed violence to speed
the overt hrow of "imperialism."
Richard Lyman, who was
University President from 1970

to 1980, suspended Franklin
with pay Feb. 13, 1971 and asked
for his dismissal, pending the
decision of a seven-member fac
ulty advisory board.
Lyman's decision was based
on two incidents. On Jan. 11,

I'm glad it's all over.
Many of us still carry
scars from that peri
od .... Things have
definitely changed
greatly for the better.'

protesters to seize a campus
building.
The University charged him
with inciting violence, failing to
disperse from a disturbance and
disrupting campus activities.
Hearings highlight split
The six-week Franklin hear
ings that began on Sept. 28, 1971
riveted the campus. Broadcast on
KZSU, the hearings highlighted
the split between the radical and
mainstream liberal groups.
Several of the faculty, though
sympathetic to the protests in gen
eral, disapproved of Franklin's tac
tics and argued that he should be
fired. Others wanted to protect his
right to free speech or supported
Franklin's views.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who
arrived at Stanford in the early
19605, said he thought Franklin
and the more radical students were
misled by the "kind of loony roman
ticism" of the protest movement.
"They didn't understand the
politics and were doing things too
dangerous for themselves and
everybody else," he said. "They had
a house down the road and were
smuggling guns in. That seemed a
little strange considering they were
protesting a war."
Franklin and those on the far
left who advocated violence,
Seaver added, "changed the whole
tenor of the protests, and made it
very difficult for those students
committed to non-violent protest."

In the end, the advisory board
voted 5-2 to fire Franklin. Donald
Kennedy, then a biology professor
and the board's chair, and Religion
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown were
the two dissenters, arguing that
Franklin should instead have been
suspended.
The decision to fire Franklin
was unpopular with students and

the most exciting peri
od at Stanford intel
lectually. A lively mind
about the war translat
ed into lively minds
about other issues.'

some faculty members. More than
400 people marched in protest the
day after it was announced.
Dedmon, along with many
other students, considered the
decision a betrayal.
"When push came to shove,"
he said, "a lot of the faculty who
considered themselves liberals

came down against freedom of
speech and showed that they
wouldn't tolerate radically differ
ent ideas."
Teaching gets experimental
While radicalism like Franklin's
was unacceptable to many profes
sors, faculty members did do a
great deal of experimenting with
their teaching, incorporating some
of the issues raised by the student
movement.
"In my 30 years, it was the most
exciting period at Stanford intel
lectually," English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz said. "A lively mind about
the war translated into lively
minds about other issues."
"People changed the nature of
their courses," Rebholz added.
"For example, in my Shakespeare
class, instead of teaching
"Twelfth Night," I would teach
"Henry V," which deals with war
and why wars are fought."
Faculty in 1971 also became
involved in the debate over the
emerging drug culture. An Oct. 18
symposium — which included
Kennedy, along with three other
panelists — discussed drug solu
tions, problems and positive devel
opments.
David Smith, director of the
Haight-Ashbury Free Medical
Clinic, said then that the legaliza
tion of marijuana, "the new social
drug of the current generation,"
would happen in the near future.
And Kennedy's lecture focused
on the possibility of electrical inter
vention in the brain to produce a

state of "instant Zen." Brain-wave
control techniques, he said at the
symposium, could be used to create
mystical and contemplative states.
Campus 'changed beyond belief
By 1972, most of the protests
were dying down. "I remember
going overseas to teach at Flo
rence for six months around
1971-72," said English Prof. Mar
tin Evans. "When I came back,
the whole atmosphere on campus
had changed, and become more
like it was back in 1963."
Since 1971, some professors
said, Stanford has become much
more politically apathetic — but
at the same time, in becoming
more diverse, has experienced a
remarkable change of its own.
"In general," Rebholz said,
"it's hard to generate a conversa
tion on politics [nowl, because
people just aren't aware. It's a
striking difference."
Twenty years ago, Rebholz
said, "People were talking about

all kinds of political issues — not
like the awful conversations that
people have today, when people
are trying to find things to talk
about. There was always some
thing to talk about then."
But the tumultuous 1960s and
early 1970s have influenced Stan
ford's evolving character. The val
ues that sparked political protests
then are now manifested in other
ways — through increased public
service work and efforts to recruit
more minority students.
"The campus has changed
beyond belief," Seaver said.
"When I first came in 1964, the
campus was lily white. There
were hardly any minority stu
dents — everyone was so Anglo-
Saxon and blond. It seemed like a
terribly frivolous party-going
school, not the 'Harvard of the
West' that it was made out to be."
Students today, he said, are
"much more serious" and have
learned how to get their views
across better. "When they want to

organize, (they] already know
how to do it," Seaver said. "Back
in the '60s, they didn't know how
and it was a much slower process."
Hoover Institution Visiting
Fellow Williamson Evers, who
graduated from Stanford in 1972,
said the current political apathy
does not necessarily reflect badly
on students — just changing cir
cumstances.
The Persian Gulf War was
nothing like Vietnam, despite all
of the comparisons, and students
today are not subject to a draft,
Evers said. "It's not any better or
worse today, just different," he
said. "Students today are still
very bright and interesting."
The change in students' atti
tudes can be seen through the
way opinions in The Daily are
written, Evers said. "The regular
opinions columnists today write
more about their personal lives,
while the columnists 20 years ago
wrote in an argumentative, poli
cy-oriented way," he said.
And, according to Evans, stu
dents today "still do have a politi
cal consciousness. They just act
out their beliefs in less disruptive
ways, more civil ways."
'I'm glad its all over'
For the most part, although
they say the late 1960s and early
1970s were an exciting period,
people who were here at that time
don't want to relive it.
"I'm glad it's all over," Evans
said. "Many of us still carry scars
from that period. Many of the fac
ulty really questioned whether
the University could continue to
operate. Things have definitely
changed greatly for the better."
Dedmon said he has "mostly
good memories of that time," but
he regrets that the student move
ment didn't go as far as he and
others would have liked.
"It's really sort of a sad thing
to acknowledge now," he said.
"We thought we were changing
the world — and then Ronald
Reagan became governor and
then president."
Lyman never imagined when
he took the job as Stanford's pres
ident that he would be forced to
deal with violent upheaval. "It
was unpleasant and very diffi
cult," he said. "I'm glad the Uni
versity survived all of it."
