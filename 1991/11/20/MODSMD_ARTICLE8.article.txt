Workers block SLAC delivery
A confrontation between union workers at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
two truck drivers replacing striking employ
ees of Liquid Carbonics Corp. prevented a
delivery at the center yesterday afternoon.
"It was a show of support for our broth
ers and sisters who are struggling to get a
decent contract," United Stanford Workers
field representative Ruben Serna said.
The standoff began at 12:30 p.m. when
the truck driver and his assistant attempted
to deliver 10 canisters of compressed gas to
the center's General Services Building.
They were confronted by Serna and two
other USW representatives. "I told them
that SLAC employees were unionized and
intended to support" the local teamsters'
strike against Liquid Carbonics, Serna said.
About two dozen SLAC employees and a
handful of supervisors gathered at the
scene. Several workers called the truck driv
er and his assistant "scabs," Serna said.
Police from the San Mateo County Sher
iffs office arrived at 1 p.m. The officers deter
mined that the delivery truck did not bear the
placards required to carry flammable materi
als and had other safety violations.
The drivers called officials at Liquid Car
bonics, then left without making the delivery.
Technician Lon Warneke, a USW steward,
said requiring workers to unload the truck
would have violated safety procedures for the
unloading of hazardous materials. Blocks had

not been placed under the wheels and ground
wires had not been connected to prevent the
truck from tipping, Warneke said.
Supervisor Jerald Belk, the SLAC manag
er in charge of the building, could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Several SLAC employees said yesterday
they expect further confrontation over Liq
uid Carbonics deliveries. The company has
another delivery scheduled Thursday.

MEChA fasts to protest Apple
MEChA members joined students from
12 Northern California campuses Friday in
a demonstration of support for the "Justice
for Janitors" campaign aimed against Apple
Computer.
The campaign is organized by a labor
union which is critical of working conditions
at Shine Building Maintenance Inc., the jan
itorial company Apple contracts.
Local 1877, a chapter of the Service
Employees' International Union and the
Cleaning Up Silicon Valley Coalition orga
nized the ongoing protest, which includes a
boycott of Apple products.
Union President Mike Garcia led a seven
day hunger strike and today will pass the
fast to others. Union spokesperson Lisa
Tweten said various people will continue the
fast for about a month.
Fifteen members of Stanford MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group, joined the fast for

24 hours on Friday to demonstrate solidarity
between labor and student groups. Eight of
these students also joined picketers in front of
Apple offices in Cupertino Friday.
According to union members, problems at
Shine include low wages, lack of health ben
efits, dangerous working conditions and sex
ual harassment.
Tweten said the protesters want to con
vince Apple to hire a contractor that would
provide workers with medical benefits, a safe
working environment and higher wages.
But some students expressed concern that
demonstrators are protesting Apple rather
than the offending contractor. Senior Art San
doval, president of the Society of Chicano and
Latino Engineers and Scientists, pointed out
that Apple supports groups like the Apple His
panic Association, which formed a year ago.
Because Apple contracts to a lot of ven
dors, Sandoval said, "it would be hard to
check into every one."
A spokeswoman for Apple said the com
pany has sought to create a good environ
ment for its employees and expects the same
from its vendors. Although Apple is "under
standably concerned by the allegations," she
said, the conflict lies between the union and
the contractor.
The union specifically targeted Apple in
part because of the company's reputation as
a progressive employer, which Tweten said
may be true for white-collar workers but not
for staff at all levels of employment.
