announced yesterday, giving an immediate boost
to his long-time friend Mikhail Gorbachev's
struggle to revive Kremlin authority.
The reappointment of Shevardnadze, who
helped end the Cold War but then quit as foreign
minister last December, warning of dictatorship
in the Kremlin, drew immediate praise from
President Bush and other Western leaders.
Kerrey's private joke blasted
WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic presi
dential candidate Bob Kerrey today apologized
for repeating an off-color joke about lesbians in
a quiet conversation that apparently was picked
up by a C-SPAN microphone.
"During a private conversation at a roast last
weekend there were a lot of inappropriate jokes
being told and repeated. I made a mistake in
repeating one I shouldn't have," the Nebraska
senator said in a statement. "If it offended any
one, I apologize."
Kerrey was talking with fellow candidate
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton before making pub
lic remarks Friday at a roast in New Hampshire
featuring five of the six major Democratic can
didates.
Bush says he hurts, too
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush said
yesterday that he must try to do a better job in
conveying to the American people that "I hurt
when other people are hurting."
He said that while "the fundamentals are
there" for an economic recovery, "Many people
still feel the pinch of an economy that isn't growing
as it should.... The economy remains sluggish."
