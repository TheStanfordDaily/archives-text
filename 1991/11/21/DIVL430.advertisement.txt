GREIL MARCUS
columnist on music, books, and
films for Rolling Stone, Artforum,
and The Village Voice, and
author of Lipstick Traces and
Mystery Train will discuss Dead
Elvis: A Chronicle of a Cultural
Obsession. "This is a book
about wt)at Elvis Presley has
been up to in the last fourteen
years," Marcus writes; "a small
history of something much too
big for one body or face. Elvis
Presley made history; this is a
book about how, when he
died, many people found
themselves caught up in the
adventure or remaking his his
tory, which is to say their own."
