"Are there gay brains
and, if so, what
does it matter?
In a study published in August, Dr. LcVay contends
that the size of a cell cluster in the hypothalamus of the
brain determines sexual orientation. His work has been
widely discussed and written about in U. S. News &
World Report, Newsweek, Time, Nature, Science, and
The New York Times. If later studies confirm LeVay's
work some fear anatomical differences could be used to
label homosexuality a disease.
