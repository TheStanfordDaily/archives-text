HANDSOME HORSE FONDLY REMEMBERED
Editor's Note: Tracker has been with the equestrian
team for over four years. The
club's top horse suffered kid
ney failure last spring and
was finally put to sleep
in October.
As a club sport,
the team receives
minimal funding.
The recent budget
cuts have severely
hurt the program.
Therefore, the team
has set up a memorial
fund for Tracker. The
proceeds will go to the
maintenance of the five remaining horses
and the club in general.
"The budget cuts will kill our team,"
said Jennings about the future of the
sport.
Donations may be sent to:
Tracker Memorial Fund

P.O. Box 11274
Stanford, CA 94309
