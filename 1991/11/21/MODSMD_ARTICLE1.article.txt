# Look out Congress, Biddle is on his way
## The 						Navy regulator wants to go to Washington 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Sen. Paul Biddle? It just might happen.
The on-campus negotiator for the Office
of Naval Research said yesterday that he is
contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate or
House of Representatives.
Biddle may run against Sen. John Sey
mour in the Republican primary race for
the two-year seat created when Gov. Pete
Wilson resigned last year. He said he is also
considering a campaign for the seat of Rep.
Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, in the 11th
Congressional District.
"I will finish my job at Stanford .. . and
stay here as long as I feel that there is a
need for a Paul Biddle," he said in a brief
interview yesterday."I haven't given seri
ous thought to leaving Stanford, but since
March 1990 there have been many other
opportunities."
If Biddle officially declares he is seeking
public office, he would be forced to resign
his auditor position because of the Hatch
Act — a law that bars federal employees
from campaigning for public office.
The Office of Naval Research did not
have any comment yesterday on Biddle's
potential plans, according to Lianie Young,
deputy director of public affairs. "No one
has had a chance to read the news, and I
have no idea whether he has created a con
flict of interest," she said.
The University had "no opinion" on
whether Biddle's most recent action was a

new conflict of interest,
said Larry Horton, associ
ate vice president for pub
lic affairs.
"Our position has been
stated clearly and crisply,
and it has not changed,"
Horton said. "He is in a
very clear conflict of inter
est now and has been since
filing the qui tam suit.

"He is an active litigant against the Uni
versity and cannot be impartial," he added.
Biddle filed a qui tam suit in September
charging the University with defrauding
the government on indirect costs. If he
were to win the suit, Biddle could receive
30 percent of the damages, University
administrators have said.
Because a qui tam suit is kept under seal
for 60 days to allow the Justice Depart
ment time to join, neither Biddle nor the
Office of Naval Research are allowed to
comment on or even acknowledge that the
suit exists.
Biddle has suggested the University has
overcharged the government by as much as
$500 million. Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten has said there is "no corrobora
tion" for this figure and said the Universi
ty has "yet to see a document from any gov
ernment official" with these allegations.
Yesterday, Biddle also said he might
found a nonprofit foundation to uncover


Biddle
government waste.
"There is a real need to help the
taxpayer, and there is no Ralph
Nader-type organization," Biddle
said. "The little people — who are
80 to 85 percent of us — cannot
afford to focus quantitative skills
on things like public utilities.
"The public needs someone to
look at things from an accountant's
standpoint... because that is how
people think and live," he added.

"Someone should be there to figure
out the cost and the benefits."
Biddle said he has been consid
ering a foundation for about three
years and has "found strong sup
port" from people familiar with
his work.
Among Biddle's strongest con
gressional supporters is Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chair of the pow
erful House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.
Dingell's subcommittee inves
tigated Biddle's allegations about
Stanford's indirect costs and held
a congressional hearing on the
practices last spring.
