# Work policies for int'l students change
## 
### Deborah Cooper 
Recent changes in immigration
and labor law will make it more dif
ficult for international students to
gain work experience in the United
States during their vacations.
"It's going to put [them] all
through a lot of hassles," said
Rolando Villalobos, an adviser at
Bechtel International Center.
The new law affects the 1,440
international students who hold
F-l visas, about two-thirds of the
international student population
at Stanford. An F-l visa allows
foreigners to study full-time in
the United States but not to
immigrate or seek work.
Until the new laws took effect
Oct. 1, international students
could apply for what was called
pre-completion practical training,
which let them work off campus
in areas related to their field of
study during vacations after one
year of school.
International students could

also work off-campus if they
demonstrated financial need.
The new rules largely eliminate
these options. In their place, the
government has started a pilot pro
p-am that allows students to get a
job off campus after nine months of
study. However, the employer
must attest that it has advertised a
position for 60 days before offering
it to a non-citizen.
On-campus work and unpaid
internships are still permitted
under the new regulations.
These changes mean "a double
hit on international students" said
I-Center Director John Pearson.
I-Center advisers are planning
to meet with school administra
tors throughout the coming
weeks to discuss the changes.
There are also workshops today
and tomorrow at the center for
students affected by the change.
Employers may find the 60-day
advertisement rule "too much of a
pain," said Jonathan Aitken, an
industrial engineering student

from Canada who is planning to go
home for summer work experience.
Many Bay Area employers are
not yet aware of the regulation
changes and how they may affect
their summer hiring. A recruiter
at SRI International said practices
there might have to change,
because the laboratories usually do
not advertise summer posts until
late May, if they advertise at all.
"It's outrageous," said Yovaf
Tamir, who came from Israel to
start Stanford's MBA program
this September. Most people
believe "working adds value to the
what you learn in the classroom,"
Tamir said. He said he also feels
working students contribute to
the U.S. economy.
If work experience is a required
part of the department curricu
lum, as in Geophysics or Educa
tion, foreign students will be
exempt from the new regulations.
A separate regulation change
will simplify the procedure for stu
dents on F-l visas who want to get

practical training after graduat
ing. They can now get authoriza
tion to work for one 12-month
block, instead of having to apply
for two separate six-month blocks.
But until the new system gets
underway, some students may be
caught in bureaucratic delay and
confusion. "I was planning to
start work (for AT&T) next
week," said Inderpal Mumick, a
doctoral student in Engineering
from India.
He is now anticipating an extra
two- or three-month wait for
papers to be processed at the San
Jose office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. "They'll
keep the job open, but I'll have to
borrow money," he said.
Amol Kirtikar, a master's stu
dent in materials science, is finaliz
ing a job offer for January. He
thought December would be an
"ideal time" to travel home to India.
But now, he said, he is worried
about traveling because his papers
are currently being processed.
