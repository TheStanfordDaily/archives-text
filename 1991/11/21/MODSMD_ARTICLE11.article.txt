# Proposal for multi-faith center revived
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Campus religious leaders are reviving an
old proposal to build a multi-faith center to
alleviate space problems and allow some
groups to avoid Memorial Church's Chris
tian environment.
The center would ideally be "a building or
complex that provided space for worship and
meeting, with some office space and appro
priate kitchen space," said Dean of Memori
al Church Robert Gregg.
He said the center would have to be funded
privately and that he would most likely "be
charged with organizing a campaign to find
donors."
Stanford would allow the project only if it
were organized without any University
funding, said John Hughes, vice president
for Planning and Management. If enough
money could be raised to cover all expenses,
including maintenance, "then the program
might be feasible."
Gregg said the project is not a new idea but
one that was set aside after the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake so that attention could be
focused on repairing Memorial Church.
"Stanford is long overdue in providing

proper support and encouragement to reli
gious communities other than the Christian
groups who use Memorial Church," he said.
Memorial Church and the current reli
gious offices in Old Union and other build
ings do not provide each religion with suffi
cient space for prayer and meetings, wor
shippers say.
"There is not enough room for everyone to
sit down" during prayers in the Islamic Soci
ety's office, said Mohammed Islamraja, presi
dent of the society. The most important thing
is "to have a place that would be big enough
to accommodate all the people," he added.
Some religious groups feel that the Chris
tian environment of Memorial Church is
itself a problem.
Alan Wallace, a Buddhist and a doctoral
student in religious studies, said that
"Memorial Church is an emphatically Chris
tian building" and it is hard for other reli
gious groups to worship there.
Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun agreed that there
is a need for a non-denominational worship
area where each religion can bring in its own
symbols.
Leaders of the religious communities also
said the site for the center would be an
important consideration.

"If it is too far away, it would be sending
the wrong message about the importance of
religion," said Cartun.
Islamraja said a center should be near
Stanford's main campus because Muslims
pray five times each day and need to be able to
easily reach the center during lunch hours.
The new building would also put a wide
variety of religious groups together under
one roof.
According to Reverend Herb Schmidt of
the Lutheran Campus Ministries, it would
provide "an environment for people of many
different religious faiths to meet each other
in an informal setting."
The center "would be a very good idea â€”
especially for religious interaction," said
freshman Melanie Lamka. "Right now a lot
of people react negatively to other faiths
because they do not understand them."
The increased interaction would be a
means of teaching people more about other
religions, Islamraja said. "People will at
least learn something about each other's
religion, which will increase tolerance."
Ivy Ali-Salaam, an Islamic freshman, said
she thinks a center would make people more
aware about religion. "There are too many
people who just don't believe in anything."
