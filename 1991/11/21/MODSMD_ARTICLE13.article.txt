# Senate reprimands Cranston
## Compromise avoids censure from full senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate Ethics Committee repri
manded former assistant Demo
cratic leader Alan Cranston yester
day for "improper and repugnant"
dealings with Charles Keating,
wrapping up a tumultuous two
year investigation growing out of
the savings and loan scandal.
After committee members pre
sented their report on behalf of the
full Senate, Cranston took the floor
to accept the action "with deep
remorse in my heart." But he then
spent nearly an hour — in an unre
pentant and contentious mood —
denying he was guilty of many of
the committee's accusations.
The Senate, in an unprece
dented action, took no vote on the
report that accused the California
Democrat of "an impermissible
pattern of conduct in which fund
raising and official activities were
substantially linked."
In past cases, the Senate has
taken a censure vote after such
highly critical findings have been
presented by the ethics panel.
The decision not to take that
step this time marked a compro
mise between the view of the com
mittee's Republicans, who
favored censure, and Democrats

who sought a lesser rebuke. The
committee found Cranston violat
ed no law or Senate rule.
Cranston's remarks enraged
committee Vice Chairman War
ren Rudman, R-N.H., who told
colleagues the Californian's state
ment was "arrogant, unrepentant
and a smear on this institution."
The committee said it found
"extenuating circumstances exist"
in Cranston's case, noting his poor
health and intention to retire.
While accepting its reprimand,
Cranston — who is 77, ill with
cancer and leaving the Senate
next year after 24 years — made
clear he would have fought a
tougher sanction.
Cranston was among the
"Keating Five" senators who
received $1.3 million in political
donations from Keating and asso
ciates while intervening with thrift
regulators on behalf of the owner's
Lincoln Savings and Loan. More
than $900,000 went to Cranston's
campaigns and causes.
The committee said the linkage
in Cranston's case deserved
severe punishment. The panel
last February ended its case
against the four other senators
with ties to Keating, finding that

they used bad judgment but that
the links between the contribu
tions and intervention were not
as strong.
The Senate chamber was virtu
ally full to hear Rudman and out
going ethics chairman Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., present the panel's
findings. Then Cranston began,
with a pat of encouragement from
his new attorney — Harvard Law
School professor Alan Der
showitz. The senator fumbled
with his hand-held microphone
for a moment, and then spoke in a
forceful voice.
Glancing up from his speech to
stare at his colleagues, Cranston
said his fund-raising efforts and
the easy access he granted to con
stituents such as Keating were no
different than the behavior of
other senators.
"So let me ask: Since I have
been singled out for a reprimand
on access today, who among you
can be sure you will not be singled
out for a reprimand on access
tomorrow? Here, but for the grace
of God, stand you.
"There is only one way out:
Get money out of politics. Enact
public financing, and enact it
