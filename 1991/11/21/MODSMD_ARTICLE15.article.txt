## ASSU votes important 
### 
ASSU SENATORS HAVE been
busy little bees lately. Consid
er Tuesday's senate meeting:
The senate passed two very
important bills: one rejecting the
proposal to change the Judicial
Charter's standard of proof from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence"
and another opposing the "fight
ing words" interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Both these actions demonstrate
the positive potential the Senatecan
exercise as an influential decision
making body when it's not spending
hours debating whether parliamen
tary procedure allows it to debate.
The rejection of the Judicial
Charter amendment — which would
have threatened basic student rights
— was right on the mark.
The University wanted to
replace a standard derived from
criminal cases with one associated
with civil suits. With the Universi
ty acting as both accuser and arbi
trator, the higher standard must
be kept to maintain the integrity of

the judicial process.
Senators acknowledged their
awareness of the problems associated
with prosecuting sexual assault cases,
but voted 12-8 to accept a bill oppos
ing the proposal. Since the senate's
approval is required for Judicial Char
ter amendments to pass, the tougher
standard of proof will remain.
Although the bill opposing the
"fighting words" amendment does
not necessitate legal change, it too
is important because it defends
basic First Amendment rights.
Hate speech is abhorrent — but
freedom of expression must be
maintained in a university.
The ASSU's actions on these
two bills send the University a
"clear and convincing" message:
Listen to what students are saying
about these issues.
The University needs to recon
vince students that their interests
are taken into consideration. An
important start would be to take
note of the ASSU's recent deci
sions and to respect student opin
ion with according concern.
