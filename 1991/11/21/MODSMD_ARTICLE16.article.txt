# Rubber morality in U.S.
## 
### 
Finally the silence has
been broken. In the wake of
the publicity surrounding
Magic Johnson's announcement
that he has the AIDS virus, Fox
Television Network last week began
airing condom advertisements.
Given the overwhelming danger
created by sexually transmitted
diseases and the proven effective
ness of condoms, it is a sad reflec
tion on today's society that it took
the infection of a national sports
hero to prompt broadcasts of what
long ago should have been in the
public domain.
Even with the tremendous
advancements in birth control over
the last few decades, contraceptives
have been routinely banned from
advertisement on television.
The Fox condom ads refer to con
doms as a means of preventing
AIDS only, not as a means of birth
control. What is it that the net

works fear? Is this nation so
trapped in its Victorian mentality
that Fox will actually lose viewers
or advertisers if it allows ads that
mention birth control to run?
It is a sad state indeed if the
nation cannot realize that hiding
behind outdated morality will
never cure society's ills.
Until last week, no major net
work dared to air condom ads. Sev
eral local affiliates have broken
free from this choke, but Fox is the
first of the "big four" to do so. And
now CBS, ABC and NBC have all
publicly stated that they are also
considering changing their policies.
Despite the mixed message of
the commercials, the decision by
Fox is a commendable one — one
that is long overdue.
If nothing else, Johnson's reve
lation will leave a powerful legacy
on the American television audi
ence. May the trend continue.
