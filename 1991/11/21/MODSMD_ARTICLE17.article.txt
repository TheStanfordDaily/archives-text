Intellectual practicality given in SWOPSI classes vital

I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE
proposal to cut the SWOPSI pro
gram. I am especially concerned
because this includes SWOPSI 174 A,
Issues in Self-Defense for Women. I took
this class last spring, and I regard it as
the most important and valuable class
that I have taken at Stanford.
I don't suppose that you've experi
enced the following feelings: being afraid
to walk alone in the dark, even in a
"safe" neighborhood; being afraid when
a man sits next to you on the bus or sub
way; being afraid when a male acquain
tance touches you and leers. These fears
are a normal part of every woman's life;
it is crucial that they become aftnormal.
You may say that these are merely
personal affairs, and it is not the role of
the University to address them. You
may say that the University concerns
itself with intellectual pursuits, and that
in this era of budget cuts, it is even more

important to focus on these endeavors
and to trim the fat off creative and
"extracurricular" programs. That is
wrong.
Learning to defend yourself and
becoming more confident of your person
al safety is essential to the pursuit of
academic learning. Knowing self-defense
techniques gives one the freedom to go
to the library at night, to spend more
time studying rather than seeking coun
seling for sexual assault and to concen
trate better on "intellectual" issues
rather than being distracted by perpetu
al fear and anxiety.
But I am not merely saying that self
defense instruction is necessary in order
to concentrate on more "important"
things. On the contrary, issues concern
ing sexual assault and violence against
women are an integral part of intellectu
al learning. Sexual assault does not
appear in a vacuum — it is created and

promoted by a whole network of social
forces that teaches men that women
exist for their pleasure and domination.
Learning about these kinds of social
phenomena opens one's mind up to a
different, analytic was of thinking; one
starts to question the apparent face of
things and ask about underlying factors,
to ask critically about cause and effects,
to understand the interaction of ideology
and practice.
SWOPSI 174 A is titled "Issues in
Self-Defense for Women" for a com
pelling reason: The class aims not only
to teach individual women to physically
defend themselves, but also to educate
and provoke debate among them.
It is also important to remember that
Stanford is not an ivory tower, that it is
not isolated from and immune to "real
life." I believe that a University cannot
and should not exist by teaching knowl
edge for the sake of knowledge. Knowl-

edge derives its worth from its potential
for practical application — what good is
knowledge if you can't change the world
with it?
The SWOPSI classes in general, and
Issues in Self Defense especially, are
some of the most advanced examples of
this commitment to practicality at Stan
ford. I have taken no other classes at
Stanford that rival the blend of theory
and practice I found in SWOPSI 174 A.
Issues concerning sexual assault are
not "extracurricular"; they are not luxu
ries. If Stanford is to offer a well-round
ed liberal education, if Stanford is to
provide an academically and personally
stimulating, free-thinking environment
and if Stanford cares at all for the reali
ties of the lives of every woman and
man, classes like SWOPSI 174 A must be
preserved.
