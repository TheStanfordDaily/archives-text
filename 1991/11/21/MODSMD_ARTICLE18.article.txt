# University must heed word of workers, try to attain fair workplace
## 
### 
There has been a recent uproar over
the shifting of health care costs for non-
United Stanford Workers employees.
Stanford's stated intent is to provide
relief for those with dependents while
having those with no dependents pick up
some of their load of insurance premi
ums. It is obvious from the furor of com
plaints that the University didn't pull
the wool over too many people's eyes.
The University's real intent is to get
employees as a whole to pay more toward
their health insurance premiums.
During recent contract negotiations for
health care costs the USW held on to the
previous cost-sharing plan with a small
increase in University contributions. This
was done despite the University's bargain

ing team's attempts to use every obnox
ious trick in the book to get the USW
membership to pay similar costs to what
non-union people are now paying. The
result? By keeping the previous formula
USW's membership saves $33,120 per
year as an entity. (This is based on the
enrollment of each USW worker in April
1991).
What would the rest of the Universi
ty's employees save if they had a chance
to negotiate their health care costs?
In the past, all benefits won by the
USW in contract negotiations have been
passed on to unrepresented employees.
Today, the University cites financial
hardship as they seek to contain costs,
but the USW's membership still gets
step increases due them before the
March pay freeze ends while non-USW
employees don't. How sincere is all this
belt tightening?
As those on the bottom see themselves
taking on larger workloads, there seems
to be featherbedding going on at the top.

Hopefully, 1992 will bring upon us a year
where Stanford will cease to be run by
lawyers, management consultants and
employee relations representatives and
have real involvement among those who
make up the Stanford community.
