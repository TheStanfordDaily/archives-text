## Full of Christmas cheer 
### 
I HAVE NEVER LIKED CHRISTMAS,
and every year the Christmas season,
like nighttime in winter, seems to
grow longer and longer.
People used to have the decency to keep
their holiday cheer in check until Santa
Claus came riding along at the end of the
Macy's Day parade. Now Christmas begins
in late October with the March of the Mail
Order Catalogs.
But it is not the commercialization of
Christmas that brings out the Scrooge in
me. I don't like Christmas because I am Jew
ish, and each December people try to make
me celebrate a holiday that's not mine.
My first Christmas memory is of the
fourth grade when my teacher made me sit
in the school hallway after I refused to join
the class in drawing pictures of Santa and
the reindeer. She tried to appease me by say
ing I didn't have to draw Santa, that a non
denominational snowman would be fine.
But I was no fool. I knew a class Christ
mas project when I saw one, and out in the
hall I went.
In retrospect, I am sure the teacher
meant well. And chances are if I hadn't
thrown a temper tantrum over the event
she wouldn't have given me the boot. But
my fourth-grade instincts were good, and
my decision not to draw Santa was the
right one. Why in the world should I, a
Jew, have to celebrate a Christian holiday?
I have heard the response to this question
thousands of times. "You should celebrate

because it is not a Christian holiday; it is a
secular holiday. Christmas is simply a beau
tiful time of good cheer — a time when we all
try to act a bit more like we think we should.
How can you be grumpy about that?"
Part of that argument is true. Christ
mas is like a month- long Sabbath — a time
when people try to live as if heaven reigned
on earth. It takes an incredible amount of
energy to remain grumpy through that. By
New Years, I am an exhausted wreck.
But the other part is not true. Christ
mas remains a religious holiday in spite of
the people who don't go to midnight mass,
in spite of the commercialization and in
spite of the Jews with Christmas trees. As
my sister, Sonia, says, "Merry Christmas
means to me, Happy Jesus' Birthday."
I could never celebrate, as a full partic
ipant, the religious ceremonies of anoth
er people. When my friends or colleagues
or teachers ask me to celebrate Christ
mas they are really asking me to deny my
Judaism and join the Christian world.
I know they don't mean it that way —
that they just want me to share in their
joy. When I voice my discomfort at their
invitations, they try to listen to me, but I
don't speak loudly enough, and their
hearing usually ain't so great anyway.
The result is they send me Christmas
cards that read "Happy Holidays" and
ask me how many presents I got for
Hanukkah, as if that were the Hebrew
word for Christmas. But I have no more

desire to celebrate a substitute Christ
mas than I do a real one.
It is not easy to maintain a Jewish
identity in a benevolent Christian soci
ety, especially one that is willing to
assimilate Jews. At times this task
demands that Jews separate themselves
from the activities of the larger commu
nity. We could not remain Jews if we
made Christmas, the commemoration of
Christianity's birth, our holiday, too.
But that doesn't mean I can't be a
guest at my Christian friends' celebra
tions. I don't plan to play such the
Scrooge this year — I have mellowed
since my days as a fourth-grade radical. I
am slowly learning to maintain my iden
tity and my good cheer through the
entire month of December.
This year I will be back home in Vir
ginia on the 25th so I can go over to my
friend Mary's house for Christmas din
ner. Mary's family has known me since
the fourth grade, and they understand
that while I cannot be a participant in
their holiday, I take great pleasure and
honor in being a guest at their house, cel
ebrating their joy.
