## Rugby seeks old Card excellence 
### Trevor Brown 
In 1906 a certain Big Game was played between
Stanford and California in Berkeley. Stanford won
a defensive battle 9-6. However, this game was not
on the gridiron, but on the pitch, a rugby field.
Because the two presidents of Stanford and Cal
ifornia thought football to be too violent, the two
teams battled for the axe by playing rugby. Almost
90 years later Stanford continues to play rugby.
Historically, Stanford has been dominant on the
rugby field. The Cardinal team provided most of the
players and the coach for the United States'
Olympic teams of 1920 and 1924, winning golds in
both years.
The Card ruggers have also dominated domesti
cally, winning a record eight national champi
onships in an 11-year span during the 1960's and
'70s. However, in 1977 Stanford rugby lost its var
sity status due to lack of interest and funding, and
became a club sport. Since then the eminence of the
rugby team has declined.
But the time is ripe for change. The past three
years Stanford has steadily clawed its way back into
the ranks of national rugby powers, finishing third
in the nation last year.
The Cardinal, coached by Franck Boivert, is
looking forward to continuing its winning ways
with an improvement again this year. "Our goal is
to make the playoffs one more time and we've got
the personnel to do it," Boivert said.
But what is this game of rugby? A sport foreign to
most Americans, rugby finds its roots in England
where it began as an anything-goes, unofficiated
grudge match between neighboring villages. Now gov
erned by rules, rugby is one of the most popular sports
in the world and arguably one of the most demanding.
"Nothing can really compare to the excitement
and fast-paced action of the game, and the exhaus
tion and exhilaration after the game," said four
year player Jason Bucha.
"It's the complete sport," Boivert said. "It has all
the athletic qualities you can imagine." A rugger
must be fit, fast, and strong. He (or she) must be
able to pass, catch, tackle, kick, run, jump and most
importantly think.
"I'm always using my head," player John Hamil
ton said.
As in most sports the goal of rugby is to move
forward with the ball and score. Scoring is broken
into tries, placing the ball in the try zone, for four
points, and kicking the ball through the uprights
for two or three points, depending on the situation.
Each side, or team, is composed of 15 players
grouped into two basic positions — eight forwards
and six backs. The one player who fits into neither
classification is the scrumhalf. Similar to a football
quarterback, he is the team's field general.
The goal of the forwards is to win and then
secure the ball for the backs, whose job it is to move
forward with the ball.
Progressing the ball forward is done in three
ways: kicking, running or passing. There is one stip
ulation, however. If a ball is passed to another play
er it must travel backwards. Granted, this does not
sound like forward progression, but the hope is that
the ball is passed to someone who is moving forward.
The basic progression is as follows: Play begins
typically with the two sets of forwards fighting for
the bal. The forwards then give the ball to the
scrumhalf who calls the play.
Many Americans conceive of rugby as a sport in
which the aim is to injure the opponent. But to the
rugby player it is game embodied by teamwork and
responsibility.
Boivert, who grew up with rugby in his native
country of France, agrees. "Rugby is a collective game
of combat where friendship, camaraderie and courage
are essential values," he said. "The people who are
attracted to rugby are very generous people."
The Cardinal rugby spirit is certainly one of
camaraderie, but they still like to win. Ed Stevens,
captain of the first side, had this to say: "I think the
most important thing in any sport is to have fun,
but winning is the most fun."
The bulk of Stanford's season is in the winter
when it goes up against other California sides like
Santa Clara and Chico State. The season culmi
nates in the spring with the Pacific Coast Playoffs
and the Rugby Federation Union Final Four.
Owen Williams, club president, hopes to be at
both of these events battling for the Cardinal. "I'm
confident that we'll finish first or second in the
Pacific Coast, but it will take courage to make it to
the Final Four."

The Cardinal rugby spirit is certainly one of
camaraderie, but they still like to win. Ed Stevens,
captain of the first side, had this to say: "I think the
most important thing in any sport is to have fun,
but winning is the most fun."
The bulk of Stanford's season is in the winter
when it goes up against other California sides like
Santa Clara and Chico State. The season culmi
nates in the spring with the Pacific Coast Playoffs
and the Rugby Federation Union Final Four.
Owen Williams, club president, hopes to be at
both of these events battling for the Cardinal. "I'm
confident that we'll finish first or second in the
Pacific Coast, but it will take courage to make it to
the Final Four."
The Stanford ruggers of today take on the Stan
ford ruggers of yesterday Nov. 24 at 1 p.m. in the
Alumni Game held on the intramural fields.
