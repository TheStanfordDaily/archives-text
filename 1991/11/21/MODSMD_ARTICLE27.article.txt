# Volleyball's mission: Take desert by storm
## 
### George Malone Staff writer 
Milestones continue to fall
like dominoes for the No. 1
Stanford women's volleyball
team. The Cardinal travels to
Arizona this weekend with a
chance to go undefeated in con
ference play for the first time in
school history.
Friday the undefeated Cardi
nal, 25-0 overall and 16-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, faces a
hurting Arizona State squad.
The Lady Sun Devils (13-9 over
all, 7-9 conference) have faltered
of late, dropping matches to
both Washington and Washing
ton State last weekend to virtu
ally ruin their chances of mak
ing the NCAA Tournament. The
teams last met on Sept. 21 at
Burnham Pavilion when Stan
ford won in four games.
The best and the worst in the
Pac-10 will meet Saturday night
in Tucson. Stanford plays the
lowly Lady Wildcats, who are 4-
22 overall and 0-16 in confer
ence play. While the Cardinal
will be seeking to complete its
first undefeated trip through
the Pac-10, Arizona will be try
ing to avoid becoming the first
team to go winless in the confer
ence since Oregon State did in
1987.
After Stanford's emotional,
convincing wins last weekend
against UCLA and USC, head
coach Don Shaw knows his team
will have a letdown this weekend.
"I don't expect us to be razor
sharp," Shaw said. "But there is
no reason for us to slack off. We
want an undefeated conference
record — we want to win every
match we play."
A win over Arizona State
would give Shaw his 200 th
career win at Stanford. Right
now Shaw is 199-44 in eight sea

sons with the Cardinal.
Senior Kristin Klein could
conceivably become the Pac-10
all-time career kill leader this
weekend. She currently has
,1782 kills, putting her in third
place behind two former Califor
nia hitters. Lisa Arce has 1806
and Tiffany Rochelle has 1814.
Klein was named the Pac-10
Player of the Week this week for
her performances against UCLA
and USC last weekend. She had
34 kills and 30 digs in the two
matches. This is her second time
to be so named this year. Klein
is the leading candidate to be
named Pac-10 Player of the
Year and is also a strong con
tender for NCAA Player of the
Year.
"I think Kristin's a legiti
mate contender [for NCAA
Player of the Year]," Shaw said.
"Considering our season and
how instrumental she's been,
she has to be right up there."
Looming right behind the
Arizona schools are the team's
two matches against No. 4
Hawaii in Hawaii over Thanks
giving. The Cardinal will return
from its Arizona road trip and
only have one day of practice to
prepare for the Rainbows.
"It'll be a tough match and a
good test for us," Shaw said.
"Hawaii is always tough there.
They're a very good team, with a
couple of really physically
strong players."
Looking down the volleyball
road, the pairings for the NCAA
Tournament will be announced
on Dec. 1. Stanford will host a
first-round match on Friday,
Dec. 6 at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal will probably (barring
any bizarre decisions by the
NCAA Committees) host the
West Regionals Thursday and
Friday, Dec. 12 and 13, also at
Maples.
