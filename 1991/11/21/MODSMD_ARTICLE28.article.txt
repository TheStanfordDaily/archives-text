# Epidemic of trash talk breaks out in Bay Area
## 
### 
I was shocked to hear from behe
moth Stanford tackle Bob Whitfield
that this year's Big Game will not be
decided on the field, but by pre-game
trash talking.
If the Axe is awarded for obnoxious
pre-game trash talk, Stanford and Cal
are both high scorers. The No. 6 Bears
are one point favorites for the football
game, but No. 21 Stanford has an early
lead in the more important pre-game
potshot contest. However, there is still
time for last-minute heroics of chest
beating and name calling.
"They're 9-1, but we're going to
bust them up. They're not good enough
to beat Stanford," said Whitfield, an
exhilarating break dancer and run
blocker, but not a brilliant diplomat.
When asked to rate Cal wide receiv
er Brian Treggs, who ranks sixth in
the Pacific 10 Conference in receiving
yards with 40 catches for 611 yards,
Whitfield wittily replied, "He sucks."
Of course, Whitfield's comments
must be taken in context. Whitfield is
the team jester, and he and Treggs
both played prep football in Southern
California, so he's just poking fun.
But Whitfield's track record with pre
game rhetoric is horrific. The last time he
opened his double-Big-Mac-sized mouth
was before Stanford's season-opening
42-7 munching by No. 2 Washington.
Whitfield boldly and blindly predict
ed a 60 point victory (not in the locker

room to teammates, mind you, but to
reporters who sent quick word to Seat
tle). To make matters worse, Stanford
came on the field accompanied by a rap
music soundtrack, with Whitfield lead
ing a dance-and-point session meant to
intimidate the Huskies.
Bad idea Bob. I just hope his Treggs
assessment isn't 95 points off like his
Washington prediction.
Whitfield has been just one of many
players from both schools talking big
before Big Game. There is just some
thing about putting a microphone in
front of someone's mouth that makes
them say silly things.
Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski has
been saying all week that he "hates Stan
ford," going on and on about how we are a
rich private school financed with "daddy's
money." His idol is Jim McMahon.
Treggs himself is no angel. He said
this week that he plans to "embarrass"
Stanford, and that the Cardinal
doesn't have a man in the secondary
who can cover him. At last year's Big

Game he kept pointing at the Stanford
bench when he made catches and
when it looked like Cal was going to
win 25-24, he raced over to the Stan
ford side for a private taunt session.
Of course, a better way to silence a jerk
like Treggs is not to tell him he sucks, but
to stop him from catching any passes.
To be honest, there are many play
ers who have had nothing but positive
things to say about Big Game. Players
like linebacker Dave Garnett and full
back Tommy Vardell have talked about
what a great college rivalry the Big
Game is, how fun it is that both schools
are going to bowl games, and how they
have respect for the other school.
There are two strategies for talking
to the press before a contest, whether
it be chess, football or Operation
Desert Storm.
The first, utilized most effectively
by coach Lou Holtz of Notre Dame and
former Cal, Stanford and San Francis
co 49er guru Bill Walsh, is to flatter
the other team. It's the same kind of
stuff you heard from the Pentagon
about the Iraqi Republican Guard.
"Oregon State has such a great
offense, I have no idea how we are
going to stop them," Holtz would sniv
el before playing the 0-10 Beavers.
"They are the hardest hitting team in
the nation and they just don't know
how to quit. They've been the most
improved team every week this year,

and I ain just terrified they're going to
put all the pieces together against us
this week. They are just a few bad
breaks away from a major bowl game."
The second strategy, utilized less effec
tively by Whitfield and others, is to intim
idate the other team with a pre-game ver
bal barrage. Saddam Hussein tried this
ploy ineffectively earlier in the year.
Pre-game trash talk is fine when
you can back it up. It generates fan
interest, you might actually believe
what you say and sometimes the other
team might get scared.
More often, your words get posted
on the opponent's locker room wall,
motivating them to crush you. This
happened against Washington.
I'm sure the Stanford defensive backs
really appreciate Whitfield's words of
wisdom about Treggs. If Treggs scores
two touchdowns, they must suck even
worse than he does. But Whitfield will
deserve some of the blame.
Fortunately, in a game as emotional
as Big Game, pre-game trash talking
doesn't matter too much because both
teams already have plenty of motivation.
When game time comes, both teams
will forget the crap and play the game.
Lets just hope we're not eating Whit
field's words when the game is done.

Nat Cousins is a senior, reminding
you that Cal sucks, we got in, and
Stanford will win 24-20.
