# Top-ranked swimmers face off against tough teams in Texas
## 
### Uri Attia Senior staff writer 
The undefeated and top
ranked Stanford women's swim
ming team will travel to Austin
this weekend to swim in the Uni
versity of Texas Invitational meet
today, tomorrow and Saturday.
The Cardinal is 2-0, coming off
dual-meet victories over both the
then-No. 1 Texas Longhorns and
the Santa Barbara Gauchos, and
will try to solidify its position as
the frontrunner for the NCAA
title as it squares off against some
of the nation's best.
Leading the Stanford team, as
usual, will be Summer Sanders,
who many consider to be the best
female swimmer in the country;
Mary Ellen Blanchard, who set a
deGuerre pool record last week
against Santa Barbara in the 200
individual medley; and freshman
Jenny Thompson, who qualified
for NCAA's in the 50 free-style
while missing a deGuerre record
by a scant one-hundredth of a sec
ond.

The performances by the Car
dinal swimmers over the season's
first few meets suggest a team
that is already in late-season form
rather than one that still has four
months to prepare for the NCAA
Championships.
It is apparent that this team is
intent on capturing the national
title that has been just outside of
the Cardinal's grasp in each of the
past two years.
The Lady Longhorns won the
championship in both 1990 and
1991; however, the Cardinal
shows no signs of being ready to
allow that to happen again. In the
team's season-opening dual meet,
the razor-sharp Stanford swim
mers throttled a seemingly
unprepared Texas team.
With another few weeks of
training under their belts, the
Longhorns are expected to pose a
stiffer challenge this time around.
The Texas Invitational will give
Stanford another chance to see
how well it matches up with the
two-time winner and the rest of
the best in the nation.

Sophomore sensation Summer Sanders won the 200-yard fly against Texas earlier this season at home. If all goes well, she will repeat that
performance today in Austin at the University of Texas Invitational. Sanders and the rest of the No. 1-ranked Cardinal will compete against
the Lady Longhorns as well as other top teams.
