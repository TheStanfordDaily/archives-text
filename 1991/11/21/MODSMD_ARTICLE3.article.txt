# Searching for ground to stand on
## Committee on Black Performing Arts called refuge for many 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
When Alex d'Arbeloff walked out
after seeing one of the sold-out shows
of "The Colored Museum" last year,
she was shocked.
After three years at Stanford, the
senior majoring in drama thought she
had seen all of the talented actors at
Stanford â€” but she was wrong.
"The Colored Museum" starred a
dozen black actors with little campus
wide exposure.
"That was the first time I had seen
most of those performers," she said.
"That to me was appalling."
D'Arbeloff said she had not known
how many accomplished black actors
there were at Stanford.
The play was sponsored by the
Committee on Black Performing Arts,
one of a short list of academic pro
grams that are in danger of being
sliced from Stanford's budget.

On November 25, several planning
groups will suggest what cuts should
be made in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. They will present their
recommendations to Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Ewart Thomas and
the school's central planning commit
tee.
Faculty and students involved in
the program say that without the
CBPA, Stanford will not have aca
demic and performance opportunities
for students studying black culture in
fields ranging from anthropology to
history to English.
The CBPA was born from the tur
moil of the late '60s as a response to
calls for more ethnic studies programs
on campus. By 1972, the committee
had evolved from a student group into
an official program under the direc
torship of a tenured professor, with
its own funding through Humanities
and Sciences.
Sherifa Edoga, a senior in Modern

Thought and Literature, said path
ways for artistic and intellectual
expression for black students have not
been open in the traditional depart
ments of English, anthropology, his
tory or drama. "Really, the primary
supporter of those efforts, whether
that be of classes, individual study or
performance projects, has been the
CBPA," she said.
Lost performance opportunities
If the program is cut, people
involved with the CBPA say perfor
mance opportunities will be lost.
Ramond Carver, a senior in drama,
said of the CBPA, "For a person of
color, [the committee] offers more of
an opportunity to do the kinds of
things one wants to do."
Carver said students can find at
the CBPA what white students find in
the Drama department and Ram's
