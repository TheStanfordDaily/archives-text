# Searching for ground to stand on
## Committee on Black Performing Arts called refuge for many 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
When Alex d'Arbeloff walked out
after seeing one of the sold-out shows
of "The Colored Museum" last year,
she was shocked.
After three years at Stanford, the
senior majoring in drama thought she
had seen all of the talented actors at
Stanford — but she was wrong.
"The Colored Museum" starred a
dozen black actors with little campus
wide exposure.
"That was the first time I had seen
most of those performers," she said.
"That to me was appalling."
D'Arbeloff said she had not known
how many accomplished black actors
there were at Stanford.
The play was sponsored by the
Committee on Black Performing Arts,
one of a short list of academic pro
grams that are in danger of being
sliced from Stanford's budget.

On November 25, several planning
groups will suggest what cuts should
be made in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. They will present their
recommendations to Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Ewart Thomas and
the school's central planning commit
tee.
Faculty and students involved in
the program say that without the
CBPA, Stanford will not have aca
demic and performance opportunities
for students studying black culture in
fields ranging from anthropology to
history to English.
The CBPA was born from the tur
moil of the late '60s as a response to
calls for more ethnic studies programs
on campus. By 1972, the committee
had evolved from a student group into
an official program under the direc
torship of a tenured professor, with
its own funding through Humanities
and Sciences.
Sherifa Edoga, a senior in Modern

Thought and Literature, said path
ways for artistic and intellectual
expression for black students have not
been open in the traditional depart
ments of English, anthropology, his
tory or drama. "Really, the primary
supporter of those efforts, whether
that be of classes, individual study or
performance projects, has been the
CBPA," she said.
Lost performance opportunities
If the program is cut, people
involved with the CBPA say perfor
mance opportunities will be lost.
Ramond Carver, a senior in drama,
said of the CBPA, "For a person of
color, [the committee] offers more of
an opportunity to do the kinds of
things one wants to do."
Carver said students can find at
the CBPA what white students find in
the Drama department and Ram's
Head — namely, leading roles.
But Carver said the drama
department "has come a long
way" in terms of including stu
dents of color in productions.
Last year two of the leading
women's roles in Macbeth were
played by black women. Some
people said felt that casting deci
sion was a political statement, but
the director did not acknowledge
that, said Carver.
Nevertheless, Carver said, the
CBPA provides students of color
who plan to enter fields such as
acting and dance much-needed
experience.
"A lot of times you can't get
that through ordinary channels,"
he said.
D'Arbeloff said she hoped that
members of the Humanities and
Sciences committee making the
final cutting decisions could have
seen "The Colored Museum"
because it "was moving and it was
important and it was education
al." As a white student, she said,
she believes it is important that
the CBPA continues to exist to
support performances that
encourage dialogue and can edu
cate non-minority students.
Edoga said, "I think the fact
that every single performance
sold out says a lot about what has
been missing on this campus,
what the CBPA has been provid
• _ J J
ing.
The CBPA has produced dance
productions and was a source of
organizational and technical sup
port for students who formed the
musical group The Seven Princi
ples.
Most recently, the committee
produced a retrospective of their
work called the Centennial Cafe
during Centennial week. At the
performance, "there weren't
enough seats for everybody to sit
down," Carver said.
Academic importance
Losing the CBPA would also
have an academic impact, faculty

and students said.
Dance lecturer Halifu
Osumare said the CBPA has sig
nificantly contributed to the field
of dance and theater both region
ally and nationally. One such
example of this was the Katherine
Dunham residency in 1989.
"Scholars from all over the
country came to deliver papers on
her contributions to modern
dance and dance anthropology,"
said Osumare. "That is going to
be published soon by the Smithso
nian."
In 1988, the CBPA convened
the first statewide black theater
conference in over ten years, said
Osumare. The conference attract
ed department heads from all over
California. "Many people formed
coalitions and new kinds of initia
tives came out of that convening,"
Osumare added.
"We've done that kind of recog
nizable academic contribution to
the whole field of black studies in

relationship to the arts,"
Osumare said. "That is why it is
particularly disheartening to us,
after all these successes, to be on
that list (of programs that could
be eliminated)."
Budget concerns
Humanities and Sciences has
three ad hoc groups that will pre
sent budget-reduction plans to a
central planning group for the
school. Assisted by a liaison team
from the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Priorities,
these ad hoc groups will submit
their recommendations on Monday.
Committee Director Harry
Elam presented a defense to the
ad hoc committee for the humani
ties Nov. 8.
"We are a very cost-effective
program," Elam said. This year's
budget was $70,000. All but
$14,000 of this covered salaries,
not including benefits, Elam said.
According to Elam, the CBPA

has always raised money from
outside sources to cover costs.
"Our budget has risen so little,"
he said.
The CBPA is only one of a list
of programs and departments in
Humanities and Sciences which
may be closed or receive large
reductions. Other programs that
may be deeply cut include the
drama department, Innovative
Academic Courses and the pro
grams in music performing arts,
design, photography and urban
studies.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee said that
the needed cuts will force serious
program reductions. "Some
things are going to close. Others
will take cuts from 3 percent to 50
percent," she said.
Humanities and Sciences must
reduce its annual budget by $5
million, which is about 8.6 per
cent of its current general-funds
budget. These cuts will be made

with the intent of "preserving
those departments and programs
that have achieved excellence in
scholarship and teaching,"
according to an Oct. 28 memo to
faculty and lecturers from Lougee
and Thomas.
University President Donald
Kennedy, representatives from
the Faculty Senate and Provost
James Rosse have all said reduc
tions should be made selectively,
rather than across the board.
When asked about the CBPA in
particular, Lougee said it will be
cut "zero to 100 percent at this
point."
Importance of multiculturalism
Faculty members and students
said they thought cutting the
committee would show a lack of
commitment to multiculturalism.
"The fact that these are the
first in terms of Stanford's priori
ties for cuts says a lot about the
real political vision of the Univer
sity," Edoga said.
Edoga and Osumare were par
ticularly concerned that black stu
dents on campus would be turned
off by Stanford because the com
mittee is responsible for much of
what the University has to offer
in the form of ethnic studies and
cultural groups.
"We've contributed to state
ments Stanford can make about
diversity and multiculturalism,"
said Osumare. "If we are not 'cen
tral to the mission,' how is the
University going to keep the com
mitment it says it has to multicul
turalism?"
"Multiculturalism has to be
more than this melting pot into
which what is unique about us dis
appears," said Edoga. "If the
CBPA is gone, then we really don't
have that ground to stand on."
But Lougee disagreed that cuts
in CBPA would indicat a lack of
University commitment to multi
culturalism. "The school has com
mitted itself to those ideals. That
doesn't mean that things that
serve those ideals will be kept 100
percent," she said.
Assoc. Professor of Religious
Studies Arnold Eisen said "pro
grams which have fewer tenured

professors are more likely to be
cut." Eisen is a member of the
committee on the humanities that
will be recommending cuts to the
Humanities and Sciences central
planning group.
Eisen said that the CBPA is
"doing very important work." He
said if the program were cut "it
would be a blow to multicultural
ism.
Why people came here
Aki McKenzie, a junior in
mechanical engineering, voiced
his frustration at the budget-cut
ting process. McKenzie said he
chose Stanford over other schools
because of the strength of the
humanities program. If programs
like the committee are cut, "Stan
ford will have to admit it does not
have that edge any more," he
said.
Both Edoga and McKenzie said
they believed if the arts are cut,
this will have lasting effects on
the student body. "I don't think
anybody with more than one
track to his brain will be here once
the arts are gone," said Edoga.
Osumare said she polled her
students and two-thirds of them
said that if Stanford did not offer
programs in the arts in some sub
stantive way, they would not have
come.
"Stanford is going to seriously
have to think of this in terms of
shooting themselves in its own
foot," said Osumare. "Students
don't usually just have one
option, they have several."
Art and backwardness
McKenzie said that when
scholars study ancient societies,
they always point out the art
forms that mark the greatness of
their civilizations. "Art, drama,
music. All of that is core to who
we are," he said. "To denounce
the arts means that we're creat
ing a degenerate man."
Osumare said, "Any university
in the 1990s moving into the
twenty-first century (and) cutting
a major part of what has been
developed as humanities in an
academic curriculum is going
backwards."

The Committee on Black Performing Arts brought Katherine Dunham to Stanford as a scholar in residence
during 1989. Dunham is widely recognized as a major contributor to modern dance and dance anthropology.

of "The Colored Museum" last year,
she was shocked.

The Committee on Black Performing Arts brought Katherine Dunham to Stanford as a scholar in residence
during 1989. Dunham is widely recognized as a major contributor to modern dance and dance anthropology.
When Alex d'Arbeloff walked out
after seeing one of the sold-out shows
of "The Colored Museum" last year,
she was shocked.
After three years at Stanford, the
senior majoring in drama thought she
had seen all of the talented actors at
Stanford — but she was wrong.
"The Colored Museum" starred a
dozen black actors with little campus
wide exposure.
"That was the first time I had seen
most of those performers," she said.
"That to me was appalling."
D'Arbeloff said she had not known
how many accomplished black actors
there were at Stanford.
The play was sponsored by the
Committee on Black Performing Arts,
one of a short list of academic pro
grams that are in danger of being
sliced from Stanford's budget.

On November 25, several planning
groups will suggest what cuts should
be made in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. They will present their
recommendations to Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Ewart Thomas and
the school's central planning commit
tee.
Faculty and students involved in
the program say that without the
CBPA, Stanford will not have aca
demic and performance opportunities
for students studying black culture in
fields ranging from anthropology to
history to English.
The CBPA was born from the tur
moil of the late '60s as a response to
calls for more ethnic studies programs
on campus. By 1972, the committee
had evolved from a student group into
an official program under the direc
torship of a tenured professor, with
its own funding through Humanities
and Sciences.
Sherifa Edoga, a senior in Modern

Thought and Literature, said path
ways for artistic and intellectual
expression for black students have not
been open in the traditional depart
ments of English, anthropology, his
tory or drama. "Really, the primary
supporter of those efforts, whether
that be of classes, individual study or
performance projects, has been the
CBPA," she said.
Lost performance opportunities
If the program is cut, people
involved with the CBPA say perfor
mance opportunities will be lost.
Ramond Carver, a senior in drama,
said of the CBPA, "For a person of
color, [the committee] offers more of
an opportunity to do the kinds of
things one wants to do."
Carver said students can find at
the CBPA what white students find in
the Drama department and Ram's
Head — namely, leading roles.
But Carver said the drama
department "has come a long
way" in terms of including stu
dents of color in productions.
Last year two of the leading
women's roles in Macbeth were
played by black women. Some
people said felt that casting deci
sion was a political statement, but
the director did not acknowledge
that, said Carver.
Nevertheless, Carver said, the
CBPA provides students of color
who plan to enter fields such as
acting and dance much-needed
experience.
"A lot of times you can't get
that through ordinary channels,"
he said.
D'Arbeloff said she hoped that
members of the Humanities and
Sciences committee making the
final cutting decisions could have
seen "The Colored Museum"
because it "was moving and it was
important and it was education
al." As a white student, she said,
she believes it is important that
the CBPA continues to exist to
support performances that
encourage dialogue and can edu
cate non-minority students.
Edoga said, "I think the fact
that every single performance
sold out says a lot about what has
been missing on this campus,
what the CBPA has been provid
• _ J J
ing.
The CBPA has produced dance
productions and was a source of
organizational and technical sup
port for students who formed the
musical group The Seven Princi
ples.
Most recently, the committee
produced a retrospective of their
work called the Centennial Cafe
during Centennial week. At the
performance, "there weren't
enough seats for everybody to sit
down," Carver said.
Academic importance
Losing the CBPA would also
have an academic impact, faculty

and students said.
Dance lecturer Halifu
Osumare said the CBPA has sig
nificantly contributed to the field
of dance and theater both region
ally and nationally. One such
example of this was the Katherine
Dunham residency in 1989.
"Scholars from all over the
country came to deliver papers on
her contributions to modern
dance and dance anthropology,"
said Osumare. "That is going to
be published soon by the Smithso
nian."
In 1988, the CBPA convened
the first statewide black theater
conference in over ten years, said
Osumare. The conference attract
ed department heads from all over
California. "Many people formed
coalitions and new kinds of initia
tives came out of that convening,"
Osumare added.
"We've done that kind of recog
nizable academic contribution to
the whole field of black studies in

relationship to the arts,"
Osumare said. "That is why it is
particularly disheartening to us,
after all these successes, to be on
that list (of programs that could
be eliminated)."
Budget concerns
Humanities and Sciences has
three ad hoc groups that will pre
sent budget-reduction plans to a
central planning group for the
school. Assisted by a liaison team
from the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Priorities,
these ad hoc groups will submit
their recommendations on Monday.
Committee Director Harry
Elam presented a defense to the
ad hoc committee for the humani
ties Nov. 8.
"We are a very cost-effective
program," Elam said. This year's
budget was $70,000. All but
$14,000 of this covered salaries,
not including benefits, Elam said.
According to Elam, the CBPA

has always raised money from
outside sources to cover costs.
"Our budget has risen so little,"
he said.
The CBPA is only one of a list
of programs and departments in
Humanities and Sciences which
may be closed or receive large
reductions. Other programs that
may be deeply cut include the
drama department, Innovative
Academic Courses and the pro
grams in music performing arts,
design, photography and urban
studies.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee said that
the needed cuts will force serious
program reductions. "Some
things are going to close. Others
will take cuts from 3 percent to 50
percent," she said.
Humanities and Sciences must
reduce its annual budget by $5
million, which is about 8.6 per
cent of its current general-funds
budget. These cuts will be made

with the intent of "preserving
those departments and programs
that have achieved excellence in
scholarship and teaching,"
according to an Oct. 28 memo to
faculty and lecturers from Lougee
and Thomas.
University President Donald
Kennedy, representatives from
the Faculty Senate and Provost
James Rosse have all said reduc
tions should be made selectively,
rather than across the board.
When asked about the CBPA in
particular, Lougee said it will be
cut "zero to 100 percent at this
point."
Importance of multiculturalism
Faculty members and students
said they thought cutting the
committee would show a lack of
commitment to multiculturalism.
"The fact that these are the
first in terms of Stanford's priori
ties for cuts says a lot about the
real political vision of the Univer
sity," Edoga said.
Edoga and Osumare were par
ticularly concerned that black stu
dents on campus would be turned
off by Stanford because the com
mittee is responsible for much of
what the University has to offer
in the form of ethnic studies and
cultural groups.
"We've contributed to state
ments Stanford can make about
diversity and multiculturalism,"
said Osumare. "If we are not 'cen
tral to the mission,' how is the
University going to keep the com
mitment it says it has to multicul
turalism?"
"Multiculturalism has to be
more than this melting pot into
which what is unique about us dis
appears," said Edoga. "If the
CBPA is gone, then we really don't
have that ground to stand on."
But Lougee disagreed that cuts
in CBPA would indicat a lack of
University commitment to multi
culturalism. "The school has com
mitted itself to those ideals. That
doesn't mean that things that
serve those ideals will be kept 100
percent," she said.
Assoc. Professor of Religious
Studies Arnold Eisen said "pro
grams which have fewer tenured

professors are more likely to be
cut." Eisen is a member of the
committee on the humanities that
will be recommending cuts to the
Humanities and Sciences central
planning group.
Eisen said that the CBPA is
"doing very important work." He
said if the program were cut "it
would be a blow to multicultural
ism.
Why people came here
Aki McKenzie, a junior in
mechanical engineering, voiced
his frustration at the budget-cut
ting process. McKenzie said he
chose Stanford over other schools
because of the strength of the
humanities program. If programs
like the committee are cut, "Stan
ford will have to admit it does not
have that edge any more," he
said.
Both Edoga and McKenzie said
they believed if the arts are cut,
this will have lasting effects on
the student body. "I don't think
anybody with more than one
track to his brain will be here once
the arts are gone," said Edoga.
Osumare said she polled her
students and two-thirds of them
said that if Stanford did not offer
programs in the arts in some sub
stantive way, they would not have
come.
"Stanford is going to seriously
have to think of this in terms of
shooting themselves in its own
foot," said Osumare. "Students
don't usually just have one
option, they have several."
Art and backwardness
McKenzie said that when
scholars study ancient societies,
they always point out the art
forms that mark the greatness of
their civilizations. "Art, drama,
music. All of that is core to who
we are," he said. "To denounce
the arts means that we're creat
ing a degenerate man."
Osumare said, "Any university
in the 1990s moving into the
twenty-first century (and) cutting
a major part of what has been
developed as humanities in an

option, they have several."
Art and backwardness
McKenzie said that when
scholars study ancient societies,
they always point out the art
forms that mark the greatness of
their civilizations. "Art, drama,
music. All of that is core to who
we are," he said. "To denounce
the arts means that we're creat
ing a degenerate man."
Osumare said, "Any university
in the 1990s moving into the
twenty-first century (and) cutting
a major part of what has been
developed as humanities in an
academic curriculum is going
backwards."

The Committee on Black Performing Arts brought Katherine Dunham to Stanford as a scholar in residence
during 1989. Dunham is widely recognized as a major contributor to modern dance and dance anthropology.
When Alex d'Arbeloff walked out
after seeing one of the sold-out shows
of "The Colored Museum" last year,
she was shocked.
After three years at Stanford, the
senior majoring in drama thought she
had seen all of the talented actors at
Stanford — but she was wrong.
"The Colored Museum" starred a
dozen black actors with little campus
wide exposure.
"That was the first time I had seen
most of those performers," she said.
"That to me was appalling."
D'Arbeloff said she had not known
how many accomplished black actors
there were at Stanford.
The play was sponsored by the
Committee on Black Performing Arts,
one of a short list of academic pro
grams that are in danger of being
sliced from Stanford's budget.

On November 25, several planning
groups will suggest what cuts should
be made in the School of Humanities
and Sciences. They will present their
recommendations to Dean of Human
ities and Sciences Ewart Thomas and
the school's central planning commit
tee.
Faculty and students involved in
the program say that without the
CBPA, Stanford will not have aca
demic and performance opportunities
for students studying black culture in
fields ranging from anthropology to
history to English.
The CBPA was born from the tur
moil of the late '60s as a response to
calls for more ethnic studies programs
on campus. By 1972, the committee
had evolved from a student group into
an official program under the direc
torship of a tenured professor, with
its own funding through Humanities
and Sciences.
Sherifa Edoga, a senior in Modern

Thought and Literature, said path
ways for artistic and intellectual
expression for black students have not
been open in the traditional depart
ments of English, anthropology, his
tory or drama. "Really, the primary
supporter of those efforts, whether
that be of classes, individual study or
performance projects, has been the
CBPA," she said.
Lost performance opportunities
If the program is cut, people
involved with the CBPA say perfor
mance opportunities will be lost.
Ramond Carver, a senior in drama,
said of the CBPA, "For a person of
color, [the committee] offers more of
an opportunity to do the kinds of
things one wants to do."
Carver said students can find at
the CBPA what white students find in
the Drama department and Ram's
Head — namely, leading roles.
But Carver said the drama
department "has come a long
way" in terms of including stu
dents of color in productions.
Last year two of the leading
women's roles in Macbeth were
played by black women. Some
people said felt that casting deci
sion was a political statement, but
the director did not acknowledge
that, said Carver.
Nevertheless, Carver said, the
CBPA provides students of color
who plan to enter fields such as
acting and dance much-needed
experience.
"A lot of times you can't get
that through ordinary channels,"
he said.
D'Arbeloff said she hoped that
members of the Humanities and
Sciences committee making the
final cutting decisions could have
seen "The Colored Museum"
because it "was moving and it was
important and it was education
al." As a white student, she said,
she believes it is important that
the CBPA continues to exist to
support performances that
encourage dialogue and can edu
cate non-minority students.
Edoga said, "I think the fact
that every single performance
sold out says a lot about what has
been missing on this campus,
what the CBPA has been provid
• _ J J
ing.
The CBPA has produced dance
productions and was a source of
organizational and technical sup
port for students who formed the
musical group The Seven Princi
ples.
Most recently, the committee
produced a retrospective of their
work called the Centennial Cafe
during Centennial week. At the
performance, "there weren't
enough seats for everybody to sit
down," Carver said.
Academic importance
Losing the CBPA would also
have an academic impact, faculty

and students said.
Dance lecturer Halifu
Osumare said the CBPA has sig
nificantly contributed to the field
of dance and theater both region
ally and nationally. One such
example of this was the Katherine
Dunham residency in 1989.
"Scholars from all over the
country came to deliver papers on
her contributions to modern
dance and dance anthropology,"
said Osumare. "That is going to
be published soon by the Smithso
nian."
In 1988, the CBPA convened
the first statewide black theater
conference in over ten years, said
Osumare. The conference attract
ed department heads from all over
California. "Many people formed
coalitions and new kinds of initia
tives came out of that convening,"
Osumare added.
"We've done that kind of recog
nizable academic contribution to
the whole field of black studies in

relationship to the arts,"
Osumare said. "That is why it is
particularly disheartening to us,
after all these successes, to be on
that list (of programs that could
be eliminated)."
Budget concerns
Humanities and Sciences has
three ad hoc groups that will pre
sent budget-reduction plans to a
central planning group for the
school. Assisted by a liaison team
from the Cabinet Committee on
Budget and Strategic Priorities,
these ad hoc groups will submit
their recommendations on Monday.
Committee Director Harry
Elam presented a defense to the
ad hoc committee for the humani
ties Nov. 8.
"We are a very cost-effective
program," Elam said. This year's
budget was $70,000. All but
$14,000 of this covered salaries,
not including benefits, Elam said.
According to Elam, the CBPA

has always raised money from
outside sources to cover costs.
"Our budget has risen so little,"
he said.
The CBPA is only one of a list
of programs and departments in
Humanities and Sciences which
may be closed or receive large
reductions. Other programs that
may be deeply cut include the
drama department, Innovative
Academic Courses and the pro
grams in music performing arts,
design, photography and urban
studies.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee said that
the needed cuts will force serious
program reductions. "Some
things are going to close. Others
will take cuts from 3 percent to 50
percent," she said.
Humanities and Sciences must
reduce its annual budget by $5
million, which is about 8.6 per
cent of its current general-funds
budget. These cuts will be made

with the intent of "preserving
those departments and programs
that have achieved excellence in
scholarship and teaching,"
according to an Oct. 28 memo to
faculty and lecturers from Lougee
and Thomas.
University President Donald
Kennedy, representatives from
the Faculty Senate and Provost
James Rosse have all said reduc
tions should be made selectively,
rather than across the board.
When asked about the CBPA in
particular, Lougee said it will be
cut "zero to 100 percent at this
point."
Importance of multiculturalism
Faculty members and students
said they thought cutting the
committee would show a lack of
commitment to multiculturalism.
"The fact that these are the
first in terms of Stanford's priori
ties for cuts says a lot about the
real political vision of the Univer
sity," Edoga said.
Edoga and Osumare were par
ticularly concerned that black stu
dents on campus would be turned
off by Stanford because the com
mittee is responsible for much of
what the University has to offer
in the form of ethnic studies and
cultural groups.
"We've contributed to state
ments Stanford can make about
diversity and multiculturalism,"
said Osumare. "If we are not 'cen
tral to the mission,' how is the
University going to keep the com
mitment it says it has to multicul
turalism?"
"Multiculturalism has to be
more than this melting pot into
which what is unique about us dis
appears," said Edoga. "If the
CBPA is gone, then we really don't
have that ground to stand on."
But Lougee disagreed that cuts
in CBPA would indicat a lack of
University commitment to multi
culturalism. "The school has com
mitted itself to those ideals. That
doesn't mean that things that
serve those ideals will be kept 100
percent," she said.
Assoc. Professor of Religious
Studies Arnold Eisen said "pro
grams which have fewer tenured

professors are more likely to be
cut." Eisen is a member of the
committee on the humanities that
will be recommending cuts to the
Humanities and Sciences central
planning group.
Eisen said that the CBPA is
"doing very important work." He
said if the program were cut "it
would be a blow to multicultural
ism.
Why people came here
Aki McKenzie, a junior in
mechanical engineering, voiced
his frustration at the budget-cut
ting process. McKenzie said he
chose Stanford over other schools
because of the strength of the
humanities program. If programs
like the committee are cut, "Stan
ford will have to admit it does not
have that edge any more," he
said.
Both Edoga and McKenzie said
they believed if the arts are cut,
this will have lasting effects on
the student body. "I don't think
anybody with more than one
track to his brain will be here once
the arts are gone," said Edoga.
Osumare said she polled her
students and two-thirds of them
said that if Stanford did not offer
programs in the arts in some sub
stantive way, they would not have
come.
"Stanford is going to seriously
have to think of this in terms of
shooting themselves in its own
foot," said Osumare. "Students
don't usually just have one
option, they have several."
Art and backwardness
McKenzie said that when
scholars study ancient societies,
they always point out the art
forms that mark the greatness of
their civilizations. "Art, drama,
music. All of that is core to who
we are," he said. "To denounce
the arts means that we're creat
ing a degenerate man."
Osumare said, "Any university
in the 1990s moving into the
twenty-first century (and) cutting
a major part of what has been
developed as humanities in an
academic curriculum is going
backwards."
