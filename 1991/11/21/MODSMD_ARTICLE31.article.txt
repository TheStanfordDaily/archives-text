## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Fake barf, Red mice A 						brief genealogy of Big Game pranks 
### Anne Hoge Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first part of a one-part
article examining the wit and cunning of Stanford's
many merry pranksters.

Don't be surprised to find UC-Berkeley "Cal"
logos spray painted around campus or your favorite
Rodin sculpture defaced this week. Our cross-bay
felonious foes may even go so far as to paint the sky
a weenie shade of blue.
But also know that UC-Berkeley will experience a
much worse fate.
As usual, this year's Stanford students are being
heralded by Stanford students for their "brilliant and
cunning" Big Game practical jokes.
With Big Game week in full swing, both campuses
report increases in both practical joke activity and
security measures.
While it is unlikely Cal will regain the axe anytime
ever (it was taken from Tresidder to a "safe place"
last week by Stanford's Axe Committee), practical
jokes "may be viewed on the Berkeley campus free of
charge," according to undergraduate Israel
L'Heureux. L'Heureux of course swears he's been
home studying every night for the last five days.
John Erickson, Stanford's Bursar and Axe Com
mittee adviser, says, "If you're not running this story
until Thursday you can say by then that the 'S' and
'IT in the 'Welcome to South San Francisco â€” the
Industrial City' sign will be painted red."
"I also think," Erickson says, "that someone will
dump some salad oil on the letters 'C,' 'A' and 'L.' "
Matt Mealiffe, a biology major who has completed
his chemistry requirements, and Ricky Torres, a
material science major, explained this seemingly odd
phenomenon: "By applying the salad oil to the letters
'C,' 'A' and 'L,' the chemical potential of the paint
will be oxidized into a lower energy state. The result
ing flux will dissipate any foreign plasma introduced
into the stratified letters. Therefore, the weenies will
not succeed [in painting the letters blue]."
Beside painting the letters, past annual practical
jokes include spray painting various parts of campus
and the leafletting of the campuses with obscene

material.
Pat Broun, past head of the Axe Committee,
reminisces of pre-drought times when "every foun
tain at Cal miraculously had brilliant Cardinal red
water spraying out during Big Game Week."
While the red-fountain days are gone, Broun
guesses frequent theft attempts are still made

on the stuffed bear at the Cal student union.
Broun, who joined the Axe Committee ii
1988, "remembers hearing about the beai
being stolen" that year. However, he is quick
to add that he "can neither confirm nor deny
any involvement" with the incident,saying
only, "I hope the tradition continues."
Unforgettable pranks
Perhaps the most memorable jokes are
those that are not done every year.
"One of the most classic," says Erickson,
"is the remote control car with the smoke \
bomb attached to it."
Sources say a group from Branner had a
small remote control car placed on the
Berkeley field three years ago during Big
Game. When the Cal band began to play,
the perpetrators began driving the car
around the field with the bomb's smoke
trailing behind, screening the band from

the view of the crowd.
Broun also remembers the year
red and white mice were released
in a major library on the Berkeley
campus.
MealifTe and Torres once again
aid in explanation: "Having mice
running around the library may
have instilled some fright into
students studying there. In addi
tion, students bringing cheese
into the library may have experi
enced theft."
Broun also cites the classic
adornment of the Junipero Serra
statue on Highway 280, north of
Stanford.
"A few days before the game a
few years ago Junipero Serra was
found wearing a Stanford football
helmet," Broun says. "Talk about
the most beautiful freeway in the
country."
Weenie attempts
Even Cal has pulled a few
pranks of their own. The head of
the California Rally Commission,
Will Johnson, did not refuse to
comment.
Johnson recalls the "letter"
they posted around the Stanford
campus last year from University
President Donald Kennedy. The
letter, printed on Stanford letter
head, spoke of how the bonfire
was canceled due to unavoidable

conditions.
Though the flier only succeed
ed in delaying the bonfire for a
few hours, Johnson believes their
joke "really worked." Good one,
Will.
Editor's note: The San Fran
cisco Examiner fell for it, that
afternoon printing a story on the
fire's cancelation.
Johnson also says he wouldn't
be surprised if they "burn a Stan
ford Tree on top of their bonfire
this year."
However, Johnson stresses
that the Tree "would be one from
a few years ago if they end up
doing it." That past Tree costume
may very well be the one stolen
from the band shak several weeks
ago. Wake up, Capt. Niemeyer.
As for now, Stanford students
have taken the lead in the practi
cal joke wars with numerous
sightings of the Stanford "block
S" logo on the Cal campus, while
Berkeley spray-painters seem to
have failed to "plan ahead" in sev
eral of their endeavors.
Dangers and pitfalls
With their high joke-success
rate, Stanford pranksters report
many community members have
stigmatized them as omnipotent
and infallible, even god-like. How
ever, some Cardinal comedians
have run into problems.
Mark Alleman says the prob
lem he ran into was getting
caught. Alleman remembers
when his dorm made a cross-bay
trek to Berkeley. Alleman says he

knew he was in trouble when
dorm members showed up wear
ing all black. "Get real," he says,
"you're not supposed to dress up
like artists."
Alleman warns only experi
enced individuals should attempt
high-level jokes. "That was
dumb," he says of the dorm trip to
steal the lights which spell out
"Cal" on the Berkeley hills. "We
went with people that knew noth
ing about being stealth."
Other students also warn
jokesters about carefully choosing
their dress. Another group
descended on Berkeley during
their Big Game rally with one
individual wearing red.
The red jacket prompted one
Berkeley woman to become suspi
cious of what school the group
attended.
The woman became inquisi
tive, drilling the group on basic
Cal knowledge such as "What is
the size of the Weenie?"
Finally, one question stumped
the group. "Where is the library?"
"On campus," one member
replied.
"Walrus" Flores (his name was
changed to protect his identity)
advises this answer be used dur
ing interrogation in the event
your own group gets caught.
He said: "It can also double as
an answer for where the dormito
ries, academic buildings and book
store" are located in Berkeley.
The band's role
With the smell of roasting

wieners in the air, attention has
also turned toward the role of
Stanford's and Cal's bands.
Larry Jacobson, the trumpet
leader in the Cal band, says the
Stanford Band is always pulling
pranks. "It seems every perfor
mance they're performing for
themselves. They are a great
band to be in but not to watch."
However, Cal could just be
sour because they're jealous that
their band is neither fun to be in
nor watch.
E.J. Lux, a Stanford Band
representative, stresses, "We in
the band would never dream of
reducing this rivalry to the level
of practical jokes."
Some reports have, in fact,
linked the Stanford band with
joke-related activity. Erickson,
also a band member in the '60s,
remembers the time the Stan
ford band called and canceled all
of the Cal band's buses.
Erickson says Stanford found
the company Cal had chartered
and explained how they "told the
bus company they were sorry but
wouldn't be needing their ser
vices tomorrow.
"Here it was was an hour into
the game at the Stanford Stadi
um," says Erickson, "and there
was a big hole in the crowd
where their band was supposed
to be."
Notably, Erickson is quick to
concede that he could be mistak
en and that another band could
have been responsible for such
mischief.
