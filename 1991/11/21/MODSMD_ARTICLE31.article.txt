						brief genealogy of Big Game pranks 
### Anne Hoge Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first part of a one-part
article examining the wit and cunning of Stanford's
many merry pranksters.

Don't be surprised to find UC-Berkeley "Cal"
logos spray painted around campus or your favorite
Rodin sculpture defaced this week. Our cross-bay
felonious foes may even go so far as to paint the sky
a weenie shade of blue.
But also know that UC-Berkeley will experience a
much worse fate.
As usual, this year's Stanford students are being
heralded by Stanford students for their "brilliant and
cunning" Big Game practical jokes.
With Big Game week in full swing, both campuses
report increases in both practical joke activity and
security measures.
While it is unlikely Cal will regain the axe anytime
ever (it was taken from Tresidder to a "safe place"
last week by Stanford's Axe Committee), practical
jokes "may be viewed on the Berkeley campus free of
charge," according to undergraduate Israel
L'Heureux. L'Heureux of course swears he's been
home studying every night for the last five days.
John Erickson, Stanford's Bursar and Axe Com
mittee adviser, says, "If you're not running this story
until Thursday you can say by then that the 'S' and
'IT in the 'Welcome to South San Francisco â€” the
Industrial City' sign will be painted red."
"I also think," Erickson says, "that someone will
dump some salad oil on the letters 'C,' 'A' and 'L.' "
Matt Mealiffe, a biology major who has completed
his chemistry requirements, and Ricky Torres, a
material science major, explained this seemingly odd
phenomenon: "By applying the salad oil to the letters
'C,' 'A' and 'L,' the chemical potential of the paint
will be oxidized into a lower energy state. The result
ing flux will dissipate any foreign plasma introduced
into the stratified letters. Therefore, the weenies will
not succeed [in painting the letters blue]."
Beside painting the letters, past annual practical
jokes include spray painting various parts of campus
and the leafletting of the campuses with obscene

material.
Pat Broun, past head of the Axe Committee,
reminisces of pre-drought times when "every foun
tain at Cal miraculously had brilliant Cardinal red
water spraying out during Big Game Week."
While the red-fountain days are gone, Broun
guesses frequent theft attempts are still made

on the stuffed bear at the Cal student union.
Broun, who joined the Axe Committee ii
1988, "remembers hearing about the beai
being stolen" that year. However, he is quick
to add that he "can neither confirm nor deny
any involvement" with the incident,saying
only, "I hope the tradition continues."
Unforgettable pranks
Perhaps the most memorable jokes are
those that are not done every year.
"One of the most classic," says Erickson,
"is the remote control car with the smoke \
bomb attached to it."
Sources say a group from Branner had a
small remote control car placed on the
Berkeley field three years ago during Big
Game. When the Cal band began to play,
the perpetrators began driving the car
around the field with the bomb's smoke
trailing behind, screening the band from
