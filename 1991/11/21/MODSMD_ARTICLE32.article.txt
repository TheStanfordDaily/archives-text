Before I graduate, I'm going to go up to the
Fire house.
I USED TO SAY THAT every time we
passed the Fire Truck House. It was the
boldest thing I could say in front of my
freshman dormmates. Bolder than Colorado.
Bolder than Sinead O'Connor. Even bolder
than the vague insinuations I used to make
about "thanking" Dean Jean.
And just when I saw that queasy look ripple
across their faces I turned around, looked up
at the place where men dressed in red rubber
suits once ran around excitedly using the
word "flaming," and added:
"Yeah, and I won't walk out of there until I
find two bisexual women in high heels."
My buddies, relieved, slapped me on the
back, wished me luck and offered to buy me a
Saint Pauli's Girl. It was one of those moments
only Mickey Rourke or Robert Bly could have
appreciated.
Only, each time I mentioned my desire to
find these two women, it became less of a joke
and more and more of an obsession. The
women began to take on names and personali

ty
ties and these cute little matching outfits with
racing stripes down the side. By the end of the
quarter they were as real to me as SnufTulupa
gus was to Big Bird, only more svelte.
So this year, when I saw an ad for the
"Dare to Wear" dance put on by the Gay, Les
bian and Bisexual community, I didn't want
to blow my chance, if you know what I mean.
I snuck out of my dorm at 10 p.m., giving
my dormmates some masculine excuse about
changing my oil, but avoiding all specifics.
Following the little pink upside-down trian
gles to the dance like some cross-dressing
Dorothy on ether, I started to get nervous.
What if people thought I was one of them, that
I was, you know, a little light in my docksiders?
I tried to calm myself down by repeating
over and over again "Circle, circle/ Dot, dot/
Now I've got the cooties shot."
But my conscience knew better, quietly,
hauntingly reminding me: Everyone knows
you can't give yourself the cootie shot.
Anyway, gay men wouldn't be attracted to
me. I had this timelessly heterosexual, manly
quality that anyone could spot from a mile
away. Almost Achaean. Or Trojan. Anyway it

was definitely straight.
I walked into the dance. On the right was a
bowl of condoms. On the left was a bowl of
dental dams. I pretended I knew what they
were. They looked kind of like those things the
dentist used to keep your tongue out of his
way while he put on your braces. Only these
were purple. And made of corrugated iron.
Anyway I walked inside, asked for an EANAB
