Before I graduate, I'm going to go up to the
Fire house.
I USED TO SAY THAT every time we
passed the Fire Truck House. It was the
boldest thing I could say in front of my
freshman dormmates. Bolder than Colorado.
Bolder than Sinead O'Connor. Even bolder
than the vague insinuations I used to make
about "thanking" Dean Jean.
And just when I saw that queasy look ripple
across their faces I turned around, looked up
at the place where men dressed in red rubber
suits once ran around excitedly using the
word "flaming," and added:
"Yeah, and I won't walk out of there until I
find two bisexual women in high heels."
My buddies, relieved, slapped me on the
back, wished me luck and offered to buy me a
Saint Pauli's Girl. It was one of those moments
only Mickey Rourke or Robert Bly could have
appreciated.
Only, each time I mentioned my desire to
find these two women, it became less of a joke
and more and more of an obsession. The
women began to take on names and personali

ty
ties and these cute little matching outfits with
racing stripes down the side. By the end of the
quarter they were as real to me as SnufTulupa
gus was to Big Bird, only more svelte.
So this year, when I saw an ad for the
"Dare to Wear" dance put on by the Gay, Les
bian and Bisexual community, I didn't want
to blow my chance, if you know what I mean.
I snuck out of my dorm at 10 p.m., giving
my dormmates some masculine excuse about
changing my oil, but avoiding all specifics.
Following the little pink upside-down trian
gles to the dance like some cross-dressing
Dorothy on ether, I started to get nervous.
What if people thought I was one of them, that
I was, you know, a little light in my docksiders?
I tried to calm myself down by repeating
over and over again "Circle, circle/ Dot, dot/
Now I've got the cooties shot."
But my conscience knew better, quietly,
hauntingly reminding me: Everyone knows
you can't give yourself the cootie shot.
Anyway, gay men wouldn't be attracted to
me. I had this timelessly heterosexual, manly
quality that anyone could spot from a mile
away. Almost Achaean. Or Trojan. Anyway it

was definitely straight.
I walked into the dance. On the right was a
bowl of condoms. On the left was a bowl of
dental dams. I pretended I knew what they
were. They looked kind of like those things the
dentist used to keep your tongue out of his
way while he put on your braces. Only these
were purple. And made of corrugated iron.
Anyway I walked inside, asked for an EANAB



Joel Stein
Narcissus on Prozac
and tried to refrain from asking the
guy next to me if he'd mind if I
"pushed in his stool."
Leaning against the wall with
one hand in my pocket and one on
my Dr. Pepper, I started to look
around.
None of the women looked like
I planned. They weren't wearing
tight leather miniskirts and lick
ing each other's earlobes as I had
pictured.
But they didn't look like Marti
na Navratilova either. They were
just average looking Stanford
women, wearing long, baggy
sweatshirts and jeans. I couldn't
seem to picture them giggling and
looking up at me, calling me
"Beast Master."
There were people there from
my freshmen dorm and my
English classes. There were even

people there who didn't look like
they were gay.
Right then I was overcome by
this awful image of people walk
ing around campus, saying to
each other in hushed tones, "Did
you hear? Joel Stein is gay."
I started to panic. I walked up
to people, randomly introducing
myself and my sexual orientation.
"Hi. I'm Joel. I'm heterosexu
al."
But they weren't interested in
my hang-ups. They just wanted to
dance and have a good time and
maybe make some funny faces
with those dental dam things.
So I started to calm down. I
even went out and danced with a
female friend of mine. I felt OK
about the whole thing. It almost
felt normal. Only every so often
I'd notice that men were dancing
with men and women with
women, like some sort of Hassidic
version of Huggie Bear.
But, hey, I could accept it.
After all, I was comfortable with
my sexuality. I was a straight

member who wasn't intimidated
by the non-straight community.
It didn't matter what anyone
thought, I was all right. I even
started to Vogue. Until I noticed
everyone staring at me. It was
then that I left the dance floor,
realizing the one main thing that
separated me from my new gay,
lesbian and bisexual friends.
I danced like a straight white
male, using my neck instead of
my hips.
I went home that night, happi
er and more enlightened. I may
not have found the two women of
my dreams that night, but some
how it almost didn't matter.
And late at night, alone
beneath my covers, I called myself
"Beast Master."
Let your body move to the
music.

Joel Stein, until recently, thought
those little white flies were just
his dandruff. His column appears
here biweekly so that pesky Harris
kid can try to get himself heat up

felt normal. Only every so often
I'd notice that men were dancing
with men and women with
women, like some sort of Hassidic
version of Huggie Bear.
But, hey, I could accept it.
After all, I was comfortable with
my sexuality. I was a straight

member who wasn't intimidated
by the non-straight community.
It didn't matter what anyone
thought, I was all right. I even
started to Vogue. Until I noticed
everyone staring at me. It was
then that I left the dance floor,
realizing the one main thing that
separated me from my new gay,
lesbian and bisexual friends.
I danced like a straight white
male, using my neck instead of
my hips.
I went home that night, happi
er and more enlightened. I may
not have found the two women of
my dreams that night, but some
how it almost didn't matter.
And late at night, alone
beneath my covers, I called myself
"Beast Master."

Before I graduate, I'm going to go up to the
Fire house.
I USED TO SAY THAT every time we
passed the Fire Truck House. It was the
boldest thing I could say in front of my
freshman dormmates. Bolder than Colorado.
Bolder than Sinead O'Connor. Even bolder
than the vague insinuations I used to make
about "thanking" Dean Jean.
And just when I saw that queasy look ripple
across their faces I turned around, looked up
at the place where men dressed in red rubber
suits once ran around excitedly using the
word "flaming," and added:
"Yeah, and I won't walk out of there until I
find two bisexual women in high heels."
My buddies, relieved, slapped me on the
back, wished me luck and offered to buy me a
Saint Pauli's Girl. It was one of those moments
only Mickey Rourke or Robert Bly could have
appreciated.
Only, each time I mentioned my desire to
find these two women, it became less of a joke
and more and more of an obsession. The
women began to take on names and personali

ty
ties and these cute little matching outfits with
racing stripes down the side. By the end of the
quarter they were as real to me as SnufTulupa
gus was to Big Bird, only more svelte.
So this year, when I saw an ad for the
"Dare to Wear" dance put on by the Gay, Les
bian and Bisexual community, I didn't want
to blow my chance, if you know what I mean.
I snuck out of my dorm at 10 p.m., giving
my dormmates some masculine excuse about
changing my oil, but avoiding all specifics.
Following the little pink upside-down trian
gles to the dance like some cross-dressing
Dorothy on ether, I started to get nervous.
What if people thought I was one of them, that
I was, you know, a little light in my docksiders?
I tried to calm myself down by repeating
over and over again "Circle, circle/ Dot, dot/
Now I've got the cooties shot."
But my conscience knew better, quietly,
hauntingly reminding me: Everyone knows
you can't give yourself the cootie shot.
Anyway, gay men wouldn't be attracted to
me. I had this timelessly heterosexual, manly
quality that anyone could spot from a mile
away. Almost Achaean. Or Trojan. Anyway it

was definitely straight.
I walked into the dance. On the right was a
bowl of condoms. On the left was a bowl of
dental dams. I pretended I knew what they
were. They looked kind of like those things the
dentist used to keep your tongue out of his
way while he put on your braces. Only these
were purple. And made of corrugated iron.
Anyway I walked inside, asked for an EANAB



Joel Stein
Narcissus on Prozac
and tried to refrain from asking the
guy next to me if he'd mind if I
"pushed in his stool."
Leaning against the wall with
one hand in my pocket and one on
my Dr. Pepper, I started to look
around.
None of the women looked like
I planned. They weren't wearing
tight leather miniskirts and lick
ing each other's earlobes as I had
pictured.
But they didn't look like Marti
na Navratilova either. They were
just average looking Stanford
women, wearing long, baggy
sweatshirts and jeans. I couldn't
seem to picture them giggling and
looking up at me, calling me
"Beast Master."
There were people there from
my freshmen dorm and my
English classes. There were even

people there who didn't look like
they were gay.
Right then I was overcome by
this awful image of people walk
ing around campus, saying to
each other in hushed tones, "Did
you hear? Joel Stein is gay."
I started to panic. I walked up
to people, randomly introducing
myself and my sexual orientation.
"Hi. I'm Joel. I'm heterosexu
al."
But they weren't interested in
my hang-ups. They just wanted to
dance and have a good time and
maybe make some funny faces
with those dental dam things.
So I started to calm down. I
even went out and danced with a
female friend of mine. I felt OK
about the whole thing. It almost
felt normal. Only every so often
I'd notice that men were dancing
with men and women with
women, like some sort of Hassidic
version of Huggie Bear.
