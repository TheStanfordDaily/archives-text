## Tribute albums die through staleness 
### 
It scares me to think in 10
years I may be reviewing
"Sickly Sweet — A Tribute to
Wilson Phillips."
Already there is "Time
Between — A Tribute to the
Byrds"; "The Bridge — A Tribute
to Neil Young"; "Shangri-La — A
Tribute to the Kinks"; "If Six
were Nine" (Jimi Hendrix);
"Stoned" (Rolling Stones); and
"The Song Retains the Name"
(Led Zeppelin), to name a few.
For the most part these "trib
ute" albums — a collection of
artists covering the revered songs
of a longtime pop/rock icon — are

on smaller, independent labels,
use little-known bands and are
apparently quite profitable.
Now, the major labels have
gotten a hold of the idea.
"Two Rooms — Celebrating
The Songs of Elton John &
Bernie Taupin" is the perfect
example of a "high-profile pro
ject." The emphasis is on the
names of its performers, not the
quality of its performances.
"Deadicated," an album of
Grateful Dead covers released
earlier this year, was the first
major label tribute project. "Two
Rooms" is the second, and with
"Deadicated," it suggests a trend
toward stale interpretations.
The names on the marquee are
impressive: Eric Clapton, Sting,
The Who, Phil Collins, Sinead
O'Connor, Wilson Phillips and
George Michael. It is a let-down
when two-thirds of the album's
contributors miss the whole
point of covering someone else's
music.
The point is this: Elton John's
version of "Your Song" is already
indelibly etched in millions of peo
ple's minds, so Rod Stewart can't
simply remake the recorded song.
Instead, he must interpret the
written melody and lyrics, adapt
his style to that interpretation
and make the song his own.
He missed the point.
Not that Stewart's perfor
mance was a total disaster — only
The Who's "Saturday Night's
Alright (For Fighting)" and The
Beach Boys' "Crocodile Rock"
could be considered that — it is

just that he, like most of the per
formers, showed a complete lack
of originality.
Tina Turner ("The Bitch is
Back") and Joe Cocker ("Sorry
Seems to be the Hardest Word"),
both of whom have built careers
on covering songs like "Proud
Mary" or "She Came in Through
the Bathroom Window," deliver
credible but lifeless versions that
shadow the original.
To their credit, Wilson Phillips
("Daniel"), Jon Bon Jovi
("Levon") and Kate Bush ("Rock
et Man") blend their individual
styles with the original and dis
tinguish themselves admirably in
the process.
But these songs are the excep
tions on the album, not the rules.
Part of the problem lies in the
song selection. Of the album's 16
songs, 12 are culled from Elton
John's three greatest hits pack
ages. What is being celebrated
here: the written song or the
recorded hit?
Is it the case, as many critics
have claimed, that pop/rock songs
are essentially too formulaic for
original interpretations? Possi
bly, but then many blues and jazz
standards survive today because
simple song structures lend them
selves easily to improvisation.
In fact, blues and jazz abso
lutely depend on outside interpre
tation to revitalize and perpetu
ate the legacy of deceased musi
cians. Look at what the Rolling
Stones and Eric Clapton did for
Robert Johnson, or what Miles
Davis did for John Coltrane or
Charlie Parker.
Sting, who in the past has
recorded inspired renditions of
Gershwin and Hendrix songs,
understands that covering some
one else's song involves taking
chances. Sting's jazzy interpreta
tion of the lesser-known "Come
Down in Time" is the album's
only truly original cover.
"Two Rooms" isn't terrible,
just uninteresting, and with its
emphasis on an all-star marquee
instead of all-star performances,
this album doesn't bode well for
the slew of tribute albums that
are likely to come.
Certainly, it is much easier for
an unknown band to cover a
famous song, because no one is
familiar with their style and
therefore the expectations are
lower than for an Eric Clapton or
a Phil Collins.
Let's hope corporate head
quarters realizes this — especially
before the scheduled Bob Marley
tribute is released.
