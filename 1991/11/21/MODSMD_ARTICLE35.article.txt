# Vaughan collection unearths treasures

Aug. 26, 1990: After dazzling a
Wisconsin audience, jamming
with two other guitar greats —
Eric Clapton and Robert Cray —
Stevie Ray Vaughan died in a
helicopter crash.
Suddenly, the world was
stripped of one of its most talent
ed musicians — a guitarist who
had already helped to bring the
blues back into the mainstream
of rock 'n' roll and who stood
poised to elevate his art as only a
select group of innovators are
ever able to do.
Fortunately, Vaughan left
behind more than a trace of his
work. In addition to the albums
he released while alive, Vaughan
recorded numerous outtakes at
each of his recording sessions. A
selection of 10 such recordings
compiled by his brother Jimmy
was released this month on the
album "The Sky is Crying."
For listeners who don't own
any of Vaughan's work, this
album is not the place to start.
Many of its songs are unfinished
work, offering hints of the late
guitarist's brilliance but crying
out for extra touches that could
have only come in a recording
session designed specifically for
this album.
On the other hand, for fans
already entranced by Vaughan's
skill, "The Sky is Crying" deliv
ers several essential tracks as
well as a moving reminder of

Vaughan's personal tragedy.
Having spent most of his early
career stoned or drunk or both,
Vaughan finally decided in 1987
that he needed to clean up his
life. Checking into an Atlanta
hospital's drug and alcohol reha
bilitation program, he did just
that, beating his addictions for
good.
A rejuvenated Vaughan then
jumped on the express train to
superstardom, performing live
with guitar greats from Jeff Beck
to Albert Collins and in 1989
releasing the Grammy Award
winning album "In Step," whose
songs included the gripping
"Tightrope," which recounted
his rehabilitation, and the blues
instrumental masterpiece "Riv
iera Paradise."
And then as fast he had
turned his life around, it ended.
By now, radio-listeners have
heard the song "The Sky is Cry
ing," a stirring rendition of the
Elmore James blues song that
laments, as blues tracks so often
do, a downturn in a relationship.
Taken as just that, the song is
filled with impassioned vocals
and inspired guitar playing remi
niscent of many of the blues
greats of the past who influenced
Vaughan.
But the song takes on added
significance because of its ironic
title. When he recorded this ver
sion of the song in 1985, Vaugh
an of course couldn't have known
