## Bill Cosby reminds you of your Dad 
### Sarah Morisseau Editorial staff 
I expected too much from Bill
Cosby in his newest book
"Childhood" — I expected him
to be both profound and wildly
funny. But Cosby is not Robert
Fulghum. And Cosby is not
Dave Barry.
Bill Cosby is like your father,
telling stories about the good ol'
days "when Nintendo was just a
town near Rome" and kids had
real fun, playing games like
buck-buck and putting dead
mice on the trolley tracks for a
biology lesson.
That is Cosby's style: a real
istic look at something we've all
been through at some time or
another — childhood. Cosby's
anecdotes about after-school
detention, table manners (or
lack thereof), garbage-can bas
ketball and falling in love are
true-to-life, whether they are
his memories from the 1940s or
stories about his children in the
'80s. He intertwines tales from
his younger years with the sto
ries of his children's adven
tures, all the while kindly
laughing at that era called
childhood.
"Childhood" is currently
number nine on The New York
Times Bestseller List for Non
fiction — and for good reason.

Although Cosby isn't as funny
on paper as he is in his many
stand-up comedy acts, in "Child
hood" he does succeed in relat
ing his memories in a way that
takes the reader back several
years with a smile.
It may not be the gut-wrench
ing laughter you get from Barry
or the deep introspection of Ful
ghum, but that's not Cosby's
style. Cosby is a down-to-earth
comedian who pokes fun at what
it is to be human — and "Child
hood" is an enjoyable and
humorous trip down memory
lane.
Die-hard Cosby fans will defi
nitely want to buy the book, but
for those of you who get enough
of Cosby from his weekly TV
show, here's one of the better
excerpts from "Childhood":
"Sign this test, Dad," said my
youngest daughter one evening,
her left hand casually draped
across the top two inches of the
front page.
"May I see the mark first?" I
replied.
"It's not important. You and
Mom always say it's learning,
not marks, that counts."
"Right, and I'd like to learn
about your mark."
"Trust me, I got one. "
"I appreciate your sharing
that with me. And now I'd like
to see it."

"You mean you'll only sign
for a high one? I thought you
were an equal-opportunity
father."
"Is it lower than a D?"
"Dad, you have to remember
that a mark is merely the teach
er's opinion."
"Is it lower than an F? Have
you gotten the world's first G?"
"The thing is, she should
have marked this test on a
curve."
"I don't care if she should
have marked it on a ramp. If you
don't move your hand, 1 don't
move mine."
Slowly, she lifted her hand to
reveal a bright, red D.
"But this doesn't mean what
you think," she said.
"Oh," I said, "it stands for
delightful?"
"No, it's a high D."
"Good. You '11 have no trouble
getting into a barber college.
Tell me, did you study for this
test "
"Oh, absolutely. I really did."
"Then how could you have
gotten a D?"
"Because I studied the wrong
things. But Dad, isn't it better to
study the wrong things than not
to study the right ones'?"
And one of the wrong things
to study is a child, for only a
child can make you think that F
is her teacher's initial.

Years of consuming too much Jello causes Bill Cosby's facial muscles to fail him at key moments, but
it doesn't seem to upset the kids any.
