This Doonesbury — good God. He speaks for a
bunch of Brie-tasting, Chardonnay-sipping elitists!
— George Bush
Whether you consider yourself an elitist, a yup- j
pie, a social-issues advocate or an environmentalist,
you only need be a Doonesbury fan to like Garry (
Trudeau's latest publication. Just in time for the
holidays, you can spend money and feel good doing i
it. ]
It's "The Great Doonesbury Sellout" catalog for 1
the fall season. The Doonesbury Company, located (
in Sausalito, Calif., describes the merchandise as 1
"eclectic," and rightly so. I
Open the pages and you'll find the Doonesbury
attitude throughout as Trudeau describes the latest j
fashions from the Club Scud Collection and Boopsie £

Dune Wear. Or perhaps you would prefer the "Real
Time Timepiece" which features David Duke on the
face and "Swiss-like Japanese movement."
Look for the designer swizzle sticks made of qual
ity plastic that "will snap crisply for emphasis dur
ing a late-night difference of opinion," collector pins,
T-shirts, a stamp collection, a yo-yo and for the press
groupie the "most convincing set of false" White
House and other official press IDs with your picture
on them.
But wait! There's more to this than just money,
money, money. All of the creator's royalties and a
portion of the Doonesbury Company and the Uni
versal Press Syndicate profits will be donated to four
charitable organizations: Trees for the Future, Asia
Watch, the Coalition for the Homeless and the Cen
ter for Plant Conservation.
Trudeau's idea was to "explore the medium of
products based on the comic strip with the idea of
generating money for organizations and causes he

supports," according to Doonesbury Company Pres
ident Richard Shell.
After mailing out 250,000 copies of the catalog,
Shell says the public response has been "absolutely
phenomenal." He said the company has been getting
a lot of comments from customers, saying they sup
port the charitable organizations and appreciate
that the groups are getting money from the sales.
Shell said the amount of money that will go to the
organizations can't yet be estimated, but judging by
the positive public response so far, the outlook is
positive. The company has received more than
10,000 calls for catalogs, and orders are pouring in.
For Dave Deppner, founder of Trees for the
Future, this means good news. His organization
works with 43 developing countries to begin envi
ronmentally beneficial self-help programs.
Deppner began Trees for the Future more than
20 years ago after serving in the Peace Corps. He
said he sees his world-wide organization as a "cata
lyst." He explained that "the more places you can be,
the more people will join" since the organization is
made up overwhelmingly of volunteers.
Trudeau and the company wanted groups like
Trees for the Future with small administrative over

head expenses in order to ensure that money will go
to those that need it most.
Currently, the group helps people to plant about
400,000 trees per month in an effort to offset the
loss of trees due to human activity, Deppner said. He
added that one tree removes about 50 pounds of car
bon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
"We want to try to plant 10 times as much,"
Deppner said. He added he hopes the catalog money
will enable training and technical units to stay in the
field where they can reach this goal.
Deppner said, "Garry's been a good friend of our
