This Doonesbury — good God. He speaks for a
bunch of Brie-tasting, Chardonnay-sipping elitists!
— George Bush
Whether you consider yourself an elitist, a yup- j
pie, a social-issues advocate or an environmentalist,
you only need be a Doonesbury fan to like Garry (
Trudeau's latest publication. Just in time for the
holidays, you can spend money and feel good doing i
it. ]
It's "The Great Doonesbury Sellout" catalog for 1
the fall season. The Doonesbury Company, located (
in Sausalito, Calif., describes the merchandise as 1
"eclectic," and rightly so. I
Open the pages and you'll find the Doonesbury
attitude throughout as Trudeau describes the latest j
fashions from the Club Scud Collection and Boopsie £

Dune Wear. Or perhaps you would prefer the "Real
Time Timepiece" which features David Duke on the
face and "Swiss-like Japanese movement."
Look for the designer swizzle sticks made of qual
ity plastic that "will snap crisply for emphasis dur
ing a late-night difference of opinion," collector pins,
T-shirts, a stamp collection, a yo-yo and for the press
groupie the "most convincing set of false" White
House and other official press IDs with your picture
on them.
But wait! There's more to this than just money,
money, money. All of the creator's royalties and a
portion of the Doonesbury Company and the Uni
versal Press Syndicate profits will be donated to four
charitable organizations: Trees for the Future, Asia
Watch, the Coalition for the Homeless and the Cen
ter for Plant Conservation.
Trudeau's idea was to "explore the medium of
products based on the comic strip with the idea of
generating money for organizations and causes he

supports," according to Doonesbury Company Pres
ident Richard Shell.
After mailing out 250,000 copies of the catalog,
Shell says the public response has been "absolutely
phenomenal." He said the company has been getting
a lot of comments from customers, saying they sup
port the charitable organizations and appreciate
that the groups are getting money from the sales.
Shell said the amount of money that will go to the
organizations can't yet be estimated, but judging by
the positive public response so far, the outlook is
positive. The company has received more than
10,000 calls for catalogs, and orders are pouring in.
For Dave Deppner, founder of Trees for the
Future, this means good news. His organization
works with 43 developing countries to begin envi
ronmentally beneficial self-help programs.
Deppner began Trees for the Future more than
20 years ago after serving in the Peace Corps. He
said he sees his world-wide organization as a "cata
lyst." He explained that "the more places you can be,
the more people will join" since the organization is
made up overwhelmingly of volunteers.
Trudeau and the company wanted groups like
Trees for the Future with small administrative over

head expenses in order to ensure that money will go
to those that need it most.
Currently, the group helps people to plant about
400,000 trees per month in an effort to offset the
loss of trees due to human activity, Deppner said. He
added that one tree removes about 50 pounds of car
bon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
"We want to try to plant 10 times as much,"
Deppner said. He added he hopes the catalog money
will enable training and technical units to stay in the
field where they can reach this goal.
Deppner said, "Garry's been a good friend of our

organization for years."
Shell said Trudeau has sup
ported and worked with many
charitable groups over the years.
"The homeless problem in this
country is a problem that Garry is
very interested in and does a lot of
work on, both in New York as well
as in the rest of the country."
Trudeau has worked with the
Coalition for the Homeless for the
past five years, Mary Brosnahan,
the group's executive director,
said.
According to Brosnahan,
Trudeau has volunteered his time
for the "Grand Central Program"

which feeds 800 people per night,
helped to buy the group a van,
designed invitations for fund
raisers and sold cartoon originals
to raise money for the Coalition.
Any catalog money the group
may receive will help support on
going programs to help the home
less problem plaguing the coun
try, Brosnahan said.
Money donated to Asia Watch
will enable the group to allocate
more funds to Burma, Executive
Director Sidney Jones said,
explaining that half of its money
is already directed to China.
Asia Watch is a nonpartisan
organization that monitors
human rights from Afghanistan
to Burma to China.
. Even though Asia Watch and
the other groups said they don't

know how much money they will
be receiving, Jones summed up
the overall feeling when she said,
"We're delighted to be part of the
whole thing."
The spring/summer catalog,
which will be coming out in April
or May, will include more
women's products, Shell said. He
explained that one of the young
daughters of the people in catalog
production pointed out that the
catalog was "a little heavy on the
boys' stuff," so they will be devel
oping more women's products
based on the female characters in
the strip.

will enable the group to allocate
more funds to Burma, Executive
Director Sidney Jones said,
explaining that half of its money
is already directed to China.
Asia Watch is a nonpartisan
organization that monitors
human rights from Afghanistan
to Burma to China.

the other groups said they don't

know how much money they will
be receiving, Jones summed up
the overall feeling when she said,
"We're delighted to be part of the
whole thing."
The spring/summer catalog,
which will be coming out in April
or May, will include more
women's products, Shell said. He
explained that one of the young
daughters of the people in catalog
production pointed out that the
catalog was "a little heavy on the
boys' stuff," so they will be devel
oping more women's products
based on the female characters in
the strip.

This Doonesbury — good God. He speaks for a
bunch of Brie-tasting, Chardonnay-sipping elitists!
— George Bush
Whether you consider yourself an elitist, a yup- j
pie, a social-issues advocate or an environmentalist,
you only need be a Doonesbury fan to like Garry (
Trudeau's latest publication. Just in time for the
holidays, you can spend money and feel good doing i
it. ]
It's "The Great Doonesbury Sellout" catalog for 1
the fall season. The Doonesbury Company, located (
in Sausalito, Calif., describes the merchandise as 1
"eclectic," and rightly so. I
Open the pages and you'll find the Doonesbury
attitude throughout as Trudeau describes the latest j
fashions from the Club Scud Collection and Boopsie £

Dune Wear. Or perhaps you would prefer the "Real
Time Timepiece" which features David Duke on the
face and "Swiss-like Japanese movement."
Look for the designer swizzle sticks made of qual
ity plastic that "will snap crisply for emphasis dur
ing a late-night difference of opinion," collector pins,
T-shirts, a stamp collection, a yo-yo and for the press
groupie the "most convincing set of false" White
House and other official press IDs with your picture
on them.
But wait! There's more to this than just money,
money, money. All of the creator's royalties and a
portion of the Doonesbury Company and the Uni
versal Press Syndicate profits will be donated to four
charitable organizations: Trees for the Future, Asia
Watch, the Coalition for the Homeless and the Cen
ter for Plant Conservation.
Trudeau's idea was to "explore the medium of
products based on the comic strip with the idea of
generating money for organizations and causes he

supports," according to Doonesbury Company Pres
ident Richard Shell.
After mailing out 250,000 copies of the catalog,
Shell says the public response has been "absolutely
phenomenal." He said the company has been getting
a lot of comments from customers, saying they sup
port the charitable organizations and appreciate
that the groups are getting money from the sales.
Shell said the amount of money that will go to the
organizations can't yet be estimated, but judging by
the positive public response so far, the outlook is
positive. The company has received more than
10,000 calls for catalogs, and orders are pouring in.
For Dave Deppner, founder of Trees for the
Future, this means good news. His organization
works with 43 developing countries to begin envi
ronmentally beneficial self-help programs.
Deppner began Trees for the Future more than
20 years ago after serving in the Peace Corps. He
said he sees his world-wide organization as a "cata
lyst." He explained that "the more places you can be,
the more people will join" since the organization is
made up overwhelmingly of volunteers.
Trudeau and the company wanted groups like
Trees for the Future with small administrative over

head expenses in order to ensure that money will go
to those that need it most.
Currently, the group helps people to plant about
400,000 trees per month in an effort to offset the
loss of trees due to human activity, Deppner said. He
added that one tree removes about 50 pounds of car
bon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
"We want to try to plant 10 times as much,"
Deppner said. He added he hopes the catalog money
will enable training and technical units to stay in the
field where they can reach this goal.
Deppner said, "Garry's been a good friend of our

organization for years."
Shell said Trudeau has sup
ported and worked with many
charitable groups over the years.
"The homeless problem in this
country is a problem that Garry is
very interested in and does a lot of
work on, both in New York as well
as in the rest of the country."
Trudeau has worked with the
Coalition for the Homeless for the
past five years, Mary Brosnahan,
the group's executive director,
said.
According to Brosnahan,
Trudeau has volunteered his time
for the "Grand Central Program"

which feeds 800 people per night,
helped to buy the group a van,
designed invitations for fund
raisers and sold cartoon originals
to raise money for the Coalition.
Any catalog money the group
may receive will help support on
going programs to help the home
less problem plaguing the coun
try, Brosnahan said.

will enable the group to allocate
more funds to Burma, Executive
