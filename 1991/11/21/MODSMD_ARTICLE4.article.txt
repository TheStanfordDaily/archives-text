# 250 campus cats keep group busy
## 
### Jason Montiel 
The sun has just risen over the roof of History
Corner to brighten the cool courtyard where a
woman in a black sweatshirt is coaxing an orange
and white cat out of the bushes.
"Come on, Pumpkin," she says. The cat, lured by
a pile of dry cat food, comes out to begin eating.
This is how staff member Mutsuko Davis begins
each day at Stanford. She comes to the courtyard
behind the president's office to feed and water Pump
kin and another jet-black cat she has named Spot.
Davis, who has worked at Green Library as a
library specialist for the past 23 years, has been tak
ing care of homeless animals for the past three years.
Davis is one of many members of the Stanford
Cat Network, a volunteer group that came together
three years ago when the University was considering
killing the hundreds of cats roaming the campus.
Today, almost 20 volunteers feed and look out for
the more than 250 cats living at Stanford.
"Every time I think about them, I know they are
waiting," said Davis, explaining why she cares for
the cats. "So I come each day. It gives me strength.
"I'm doing a very small part," she said. "A lot of
people devote time to the animals."
Volunteers provide for campus cats seven days a
week, according to Carole Hyde, a secretary at the
Center for International Security and Arms Control
and editor of the network's newsletter.
The network is administered
and funded in part by the Palo
Alto Humane Society and through
donations from nearly 600
newsletter subscribers, Hyde said.
The story of the network's con
cern for campus cats can be
traced back to early 1989, when
the University considered drastic
measures to curb a cat population
explosion.
At the time, the University
estimated that there were
between 1,000 and 1,500 feral —
or wild — cats on campus, creat
ing a possible health hazard. The
proposed solution involved
rounding the animals up and tak
ing them to the Santa Clara
County animal shelter, where
most would have been killed.
This is when people who had
long taken care of the cats came
together to fight for feline rights.
"We worked out a compromise
with the University, where we
would be the caretakers of the
cats," Hyde said. "The cats would
be given legal residence if they
were spayed or neutered and vac
cinated and cared for."
The agreement allowed for 250
cats to remain on campus, said
Carole Miller, who works at the
Electrical Engineering Research
Administration and also helped
negotiate the solution.
Since that time, complaints
about cats around campus have
been referred directly to the net
work, Miller said, adding that the
University has been cooperative.
"This whole program has real
ly developed into a full-fledged
animal welfare group," Miller
said. "But most of it is up to us
through our own fund-raising
efforts."
Feeding and caring for the cats
is expensive, with many network
members paying out of their own
pockets, Miller said. Some volun
teers buy feed for as many as 60
cats, spending up to $100 a
month.
Hyde said that with the help of
the Palo Alto Humane Society,
discounts from local veterinari
ans and outside donations, the
network has sterilized several
hundred cats over the past three
years.
Today there are fewer new kit-

cats that have not
been spayed or
neutered.'

tens and no diseased cats on cam
pus, said Hildegard Taleghani, a
manager at the Office of Develop
ment and a member of the net
work. She uses humane traps —
wire cages baited with food inside
— to catch cats so they can be
added to the network's registry
and cared for.
"We have gotten down to the
point where there are only pockets
of cats that have not been spayed
or neutered," Taleghani said. "We
have made great progress, since
the population is under control."
Homes have been found for
many tame cats, while many feral
cats have been re-released to live
on campus.
Feeding the cats is a rewarding
experience, according to network
member Elizabeth Trice, a sopho
more who cares for up to five cats
each day on Sterling Quad.
"We're not encouraging ani
mals to live on campus," Trice
said. "We're just making sure the
ones on campus aren't sick and
diseased."
The abandonment of animals
on campus has created a need for
the network, she added.
"The reality is that domestic
animals don't survive well when
expected to hunt for their own
food," Trice said. "It's sad that
people think [abandonment! is a
way to get rid of animals."
For this reason, Taleghani is
forced to keep a constant lookout
for new cats. "It's an involvement
that is hard to get away from,"
Taleghani said. "We want to
make sure that all the animals
here are taken care of."

waiting," said Davis, explaining why she cares for
the cats. "So I come each day. It gives me strength.
"I'm doing a very small part," she said. "A lot of
people devote time to the animals."
Volunteers provide for campus cats seven days a
week, according to Carole Hyde, a secretary at the
Center for International Security and Arms Control
and editor of the network's newsletter.
The network is administered
and funded in part by the Palo
Alto Humane Society and through
donations from nearly 600
newsletter subscribers, Hyde said.
The story of the network's con
cern for campus cats can be
traced back to early 1989, when
the University considered drastic
measures to curb a cat population
explosion.
At the time, the University
estimated that there were
between 1,000 and 1,500 feral —
or wild — cats on campus, creat
ing a possible health hazard. The
proposed solution involved
rounding the animals up and tak
ing them to the Santa Clara
County animal shelter, where
most would have been killed.
This is when people who had
long taken care of the cats came
together to fight for feline rights.
"We worked out a compromise
with the University, where we
would be the caretakers of the
cats," Hyde said. "The cats would
be given legal residence if they
were spayed or neutered and vac
cinated and cared for."
The agreement allowed for 250
cats to remain on campus, said
Carole Miller, who works at the
Electrical Engineering Research
Administration and also helped
negotiate the solution.
Since that time, complaints
about cats around campus have
been referred directly to the net
work, Miller said, adding that the
University has been cooperative.
"This whole program has real
ly developed into a full-fledged
animal welfare group," Miller
said. "But most of it is up to us
through our own fund-raising
efforts."
Feeding and caring for the cats
is expensive, with many network
members paying out of their own
pockets, Miller said. Some volun
teers buy feed for as many as 60
cats, spending up to $100 a
month.
Hyde said that with the help of
the Palo Alto Humane Society,
discounts from local veterinari
ans and outside donations, the
network has sterilized several
hundred cats over the past three
years.
Today there are fewer new kit-

tens and no diseased cats on cam
pus, said Hildegard Taleghani, a
manager at the Office of Develop
ment and a member of the net
work. She uses humane traps —
wire cages baited with food inside
— to catch cats so they can be
added to the network's registry
and cared for.
"We have gotten down to the
point where there are only pockets
of cats that have not been spayed
or neutered," Taleghani said. "We
have made great progress, since
the population is under control."
Homes have been found for
many tame cats, while many feral
cats have been re-released to live
on campus.
Feeding the cats is a rewarding
experience, according to network
member Elizabeth Trice, a sopho
more who cares for up to five cats
each day on Sterling Quad.
"We're not encouraging ani
mals to live on campus," Trice
said. "We're just making sure the
ones on campus aren't sick and
diseased."
The abandonment of animals
on campus has created a need for
the network, she added.
"The reality is that domestic
animals don't survive well when
expected to hunt for their own
food," Trice said. "It's sad that
people think [abandonment! is a
way to get rid of animals."
For this reason, Taleghani is
forced to keep a constant lookout
for new cats. "It's an involvement
that is hard to get away from,"
Taleghani said. "We want to
make sure that all the animals
here are taken care of."
