# 250 campus cats keep group busy

The sun has just risen over the roof of History
Corner to brighten the cool courtyard where a
woman in a black sweatshirt is coaxing an orange
and white cat out of the bushes.
"Come on, Pumpkin," she says. The cat, lured by
a pile of dry cat food, comes out to begin eating.
This is how staff member Mutsuko Davis begins
each day at Stanford. She comes to the courtyard
behind the president's office to feed and water Pump
kin and another jet-black cat she has named Spot.
Davis, who has worked at Green Library as a
library specialist for the past 23 years, has been tak
ing care of homeless animals for the past three years.
Davis is one of many members of the Stanford
Cat Network, a volunteer group that came together
three years ago when the University was considering
killing the hundreds of cats roaming the campus.
Today, almost 20 volunteers feed and look out for
the more than 250 cats living at Stanford.
"Every time I think about them, I know they are
waiting," said Davis, explaining why she cares for
the cats. "So I come each day. It gives me strength.
"I'm doing a very small part," she said. "A lot of
people devote time to the animals."
Volunteers provide for campus cats seven days a
week, according to Carole Hyde, a secretary at the
Center for International Security and Arms Control
and editor of the network's newsletter.
