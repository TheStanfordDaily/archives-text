# Scorsese's remake of 'Cape Fear' packs quite a bite
## 
### Mike Curry 
Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.
Although Martin Scorsese would prob
ably prefer to agonize over bloodied New
York Italians, his latest film, "Cape
Fear," a remake of the 1962 original,
compels comparisons to the great direc
tor of suspense. Like "Fatal Attraction"
and "Silence of the Lambs," "Fear" is a
gripping psychological thriller — but
with the addition of Hitchcock's depth.
A thinking person's horror flick,
"Fear" contains the numerous Biblical,
musical and literary references (Niet
zsche, Thomas Wolfe) that were staples
in Hitchcock's best films. In fact, if you
kept yourself from falling asleep in Sun
day school and CIV sections, you may
even understand all the tattoos on Max
Cady's (Robert De Niro) back.
Slyly, Scorsese alludes to the master of

suspense's favorite devices and trade
marks. Besides the winning Hitchcockian
mix of horror and humor, "Fear"
includes handcuffs, mirrors, window
shots, Catholic themes of sin and punish
ment and one hard-to-miss reference to
"Psycho." The film's final Hitchcock flair
is a haunting new adaptation of Bernard
Herman's ("Psycho," "North by North
west") original 1962 "Cape Fear" score.
Just as Hitchcock relied on great
actors like Jimmy Stewart and Gary
Grant, Scorsese anchored "Cape Fear"
with one of Hollywood's most gifted per
formers. As usual, De Niro is De Niro. In
fact, he's almost too good; we like his
deranged character, Cady, too much.
"Fear's" plot centers on Cady, a
recently released ex-con who has spent
the last 14 years in prison. Cady is seek
ing what he believes to be divine revenge
on his defense attorney, Sam Bowden

(Nick Nolte). Putting an evil twist on the
I'm-on-a-Mission-from-God school of
thought, Cady is a wounded predatory
animal hungering to punish Bowden for
suppressing evidence that may have
exonerated him.
We don't cheer for Cady, but with De
Niro delivering lines like "I could go to
California and teach earthquake pre
paredness," we laugh and empathize with
him.
Surrounding De Niro are many other
fine performances. Nolte's portrayal of
Bowden is excellent, as is Jessica Lange's
performance as Bowden's wife, Leigh.
Showing new talent is Juliette Lewis,
who convincingly plays Bowden's gawky
and confused 15-year-old daughter,
Danielle.
Cameo appearances from members of
the original "Cape Fear" cast (Gregory
Peck, Robert Mitchum) are kind of fun,

but then again, all of their performances
lately seem to be cameos.
Having fun seems to be Scorsese's
main vision with his version of "Cape
Fear." Although "Fear" is sometimes
shocking and literally "packs a bite,"
Scorsese reminds the audience with con
stantly moving cinematography and spe
cial negative shots that they are only
watching a film. Proving that everyone's
a deconstructionist these days, the direc
tor even allows De Niro to actually walk
into the camera in an early scene.
And it's hard not to be dragged into
Scorsese's fun house. In one frenetic rac
quetball sequence, you want to strap on
goggles. And in the final climactic storm
sequence, you want to buckle on a rain
coat.
Ironically, Steven Spielberg and De
Niro had to work hard to convince Scors
ese to take on "Fear" since the latter has

a strong distaste for remakes. Yet consid
ering he never really wanted to make it,
Scorsese has skillfully remolded a stock
film about good and evil into a powerful
and suspenseful masterpiece about our
susceptibility to sin and our ability to
escape from it.
Scorsese has recently been whining
(somewhat legitimately) in film maga
zines and interviews that he and his films
("Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull", "Good Fe
llas") have been unfairly snubbed at the
Oscars. Although he shouldn't escape
this year's ceremony without some sort
of award, Scorsese should take comfort in
the fact that a short, fat, but brilliant
director with a lisping British accent
never won a little golden paperweight,
either.
