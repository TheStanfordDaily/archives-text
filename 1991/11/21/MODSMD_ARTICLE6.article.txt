# 'Moot point' proof issue still on Fac Sen agenda
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Although discussion of the proposed
change in the burden of proof is still on
tonight's Faculty Senate agenda, Universi
ty officials say they see no way the change
could occur.
Tonight's discussion comes in the wake
of Tuesday's ASSU Senate vote which
rejected a proposal to lower the burden of
proof used in student misconduct cases
from "beyond a reasonable doubt" to "clear
and convincing evidence."
The proposal was made by the Commit
tee of 15, a faculty, staff and student com
mittee with the power to suggest amend
ments to the University's Legislative and
Judicial Charter.
According to the judicial charter, any
proposed amendments have to be passed by
the ASSU Senate and Faculty Senate and
signed by the University president before
they can go into effect.
"I can't predict what the senate is going

to do, but I can say with certainty that [the
changel will remain on the agenda," said
Faculty Senate Chair James Sheehan.
University President Donald Kennedy,
however, said the question of changing the
burden of proof is now a "moot point"
because of the ASSU Senate's rejection of
the proposal.
Judicial affairs officer Sally Cole said
she was disappointed by the ASSU's action.
"I think it was a disservice to students,"
she said.
Cole said she felt the senate had an
"unfortunately narrow perspective to only
see the rights of the students accused of
misconduct" and not the rights of the per
son making the claim. "It concerns me that
the student vote does not recognize any
rights other than those of the accused stu
dent," she said.
But Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck said he believes the ASSU's con
cern with the rights of the accused was jus-
tified. He said he worried that the
change would have made it too easy
for the University to convict stu
dents.
"I think the senate and the stu
dent body don't trust the Universi
ty with that kind of power," he said.
ASSU Senate Chair Kevin Warsh

said he thought the debates over the
proposal were valuable. "All stu
dents now have a better perspective
of what their rights are," he said.
In addition to the bill opposing a
change in burden of proof, the
ASSU Senate Tuesday passed three
other bills dealing with other Com
mittee of 15 recommendations.
One bill blocked a proposal to
require any student who has infor
mation relevant to a complaint to
cooperate with the University

investigation. Proposed punish
ments for failure to cooperate with
investigators included "the with
holding of registration privileges,
transcripts, diplomas and degrees."
A second bill rejected several pro
posed new rights for students who
initiate complaints because of
"vague" and "indiscriminate" phras
ing. Among the changes rejected
were "the right to make a confiden
tial report," around which Warsh
said most of the discussion centered.

The senate did, however, sup
port the Committee of 15's recom
mendation to allow complainants
"to have a person of their choice
accompany them throughout the
adjudicative process" providing
that person does not participate,
Warsh said. The senate amended
the proposal, however, to allow
legal counsel to participate actively.
The third bill supported a com
mittee recommendation to ban
"evidence of sexual history of per

sons initiating complaints . . .
unless a hearing officer at the fact
finding hearing makes a specific
finding of relevance."
Because they were supported by
the ASSU Senate, the amendments
dealing with evidence of sexual his
tory and accompaniment of the
complainant may go into effect if
they are passed by the Faculty Sen
ate and approved by Kennedy.
In addition to bills dealing with
the Committee of 15's recommen

dations, the ASSU passed a bill say
ing "the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council should reconsider the
Grey Interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard." The Grey Inter
pretation is a speech code allowing
students to be prosecuted for "dis
criminatory harassment," includ
ing speech "intended to insult or
stigmatize an individual or small
group of individuals."
The initial vote on the bill was a
10-10 tie. Warsh then broke the tie.
