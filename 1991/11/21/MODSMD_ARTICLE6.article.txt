# 'Moot point' proof issue still on Fac Sen agenda

Although discussion of the proposed
change in the burden of proof is still on
tonight's Faculty Senate agenda, Universi

the student vote does not recognize any
rights other than those of the accused stu
dent," she said.
But Council of Presidents member John
Overdeck said he believes the ASSU's con
