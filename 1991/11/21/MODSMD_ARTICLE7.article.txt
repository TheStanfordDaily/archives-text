# Athletic life will change with cuts
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
More than 125 students questioned Athletic
Director Ted Leland last night about the implica
tions of budget cuts in physical education and recre
ational athletics.
The Department of Athletics faces a $700,000 reduc
tion in its $3.6 million subsidy from the University as
part of Stanford's $43 million budget crisis.
To make the reductions, the University has elim
inated its $300,000 support of varsitv-level athletics
and cut 12 percent — $400,000 — from education
and recreational programs.
Leland said his department has already discussed
many proposals to meet the $400,000 target. Among
the preliminary cuts currently under consideration are:
• Closing Encina Gym and making Roble Gym the
only recreational facility,
• Reducing the dance subsidy by at least $40,000,
• Cutting the student golf-round subsidy by
$25,000, or $5 per round,
• Substantially reducing open recreational hours,
• Shrinking the physical education subsidy, or
charging for selected classes,
• Reducing the club sports subsidy, and
• Eliminating the martial arts subsidy.
The Athletics Department is also studying open
ing another golf course to generate more revenue,
but construction could not begin for at least four
