THE SISTINE CHAPEL
The recent restoration
of Michelangelo's Sis
tine Chapel ceiling ILj — —
frescoes has aston- Ik
ished the world. Cen- £1
turies of vamish and (I ■jpOk,
grime were painstak- '
ingly removed, and i ! I
the brilliantly colored, !jI ' ZH
powerfully modeled J LAM
figures were revealed j j WJptM
in all their original XnHta
radiance. Now, in two I | I
magnificent volumes, ! j IrjJ
we see Michelangelo's . y i,
creation in all its splen- " N .
dor, in 600 full-color pho
tographs taken from the restorers'
scaffolds. Panoramas re-create the
overarching grandeur of each bay of
the ceiling. Nearly life-size closeups
(many in gatefolds)
illuminate the intrica
cies of Michelangelo's
_ working methods and
technique, and the
sheer painterly beauty
of the images them
selves. The iconogra
phy of the fresco cycle
is explained by the art
historian Frederick
juSHTf Hartt, and Michelange
lo's practices and the
- history of the ceiling are
discussed by the head
of the restoration team,
Gianluigi Colalucci.
A stunning and sumptuous objet de
luxe —magnificently produced—that
will stand unequaled in its presentation
of this unique monument of Western art.
