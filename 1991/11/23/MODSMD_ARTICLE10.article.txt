# 'Can we take a picture?' The Axe legend lives on
## 
### Mike McDonough 
So, you're anxiously awaiting the start
of the 94th Stanford-California Big Game,
and you're wondering to yourself, "What's
so special about a 100-year old axe, and
why the heck would two football teams
want to beat each other to a pulp on the
football field over it?"
Not just any axe. The Axe. The Stanford
Axe. And, though other axes throughout
history may have seen more actual wood
chopping, it is safe to say that no other axe
has traveled quite as extensively, seen as
many sights, or turned up in as many
places as the Stanford Axe.

Weenies covet it. Freshmen marvel at it.
For years it has been the symbol of the
rivalry between Stanford and that other
school across the bay the University of
California at Berkeley.

And the story of the Axe is the tale of
that rivalry, the story of how much that
other school has always wanted that which
belongs to Stanford....
The story begins in 1896, after the
fierce rivalry between the schools from
opposite sides of the bay had already
begun. Stanford yell leaders Will Irwin and
Chris Bradley composed a new cheer for
the home team. The chant's chorus, "Give
'em the axe, the axe, the axe!" garnered it
the title of the "Axe Yell," and it inspired
Stanford to victory over the Golden Bears
in many sports (it took California seven
Big Games before it won its first).
Three years later, during a three-game
baseball series with Cal, yell leader Billy
Erb felt that a visual display was needed to
excite the Stanford crowd for the Axe Yell,
so he purchased a broadaxe with a fifteen
inch blade and used it to decapitate a

stuffed blue and gold bear at that
evening's bonfire.
The display was so loved by the faithful
of the Farm that it was re-enacted the next
day April 15, 1899 at the game in San
Francisco. Unfortunately, California took
both the game and the series that day.
After the game, the yell leaders felt that
maybe the Axe was a symbol of bad luck
and should be left behind. Before they
could decide, however, a group of Cal fans
angered by the Axe display during the
game pounced on the group and ran away
with the Axe.
For thirty-one years, the Axe remained
locked in a Berkeley bank vault and was
brought out at the annual Springtime
Rally to taunt Stanford.
But on April 3, 1930, a group of 21
freshmen from Sequoia Hall answered the
call of destiny, and decided that the time

had come for justice to be done. Posing as
sports reporters, they followed the Axe's
journey from the Springtime Rally back to
the bank where California's Grand Custo
dian of the Axe Norm Horner would seal it
up for another year.
As Horner stepped from his car with the
Axe, the "cameramen" stepped forward,
announcing, "We want to take a picture of
the Axe." As flashbulbs went off, the Stan
ford men grabbed the Axe and made off
through the San Francisco streets. With
the help of a few strategically-placed tear
gas bombs, the Axe made it out of the
hands of its Berkeley captors and back to
Stanford.
When the group arrived at Stanford,
news of the Axe's return traveled through
every dorm on campus. Despite the late
ness of the hour, an impromptu
rally quickly snowballed as Stan
ford students rejoiced over the
return of the Axe to its rightful
home. The group earned the
nickname "The Immortal Twen
ty-One" for their exploits, and
three years later the student gov
ernments of the two schools
signed an agreement making the
Axe the prize of the annual Big
Game.
Since those times, the Axe has
remained the legitimate trophy of
Big Game, although this hasn't
stopped students from both
schools from stealing it from time
to time. Stanford not only leads
California in Big Game victories
(45-37-11) but also in Axe-steal
ings (4-3).
Most recently, Stanford went
up 4-3 when the "Infamous
Three" called the UC-Berkeley
Rally Committee (guardians of
the Axe) claiming to be California
football coach Mike White and
asked that the Axe be brought to
Ming's for the Northern Califor
nia Football Writers' weekly
meeting (Why? All together now.
. .. "We want to take a picture!")

The Axe was returned in time
for Stanford to win it anyway in

the Big Game, 26-17, and it just
goes to show you how much they
learn at California in 43 years!
The game today will represent
the 94th meeting of Stanford and
California in the Big Game,and
the 55th awarding of the Axe to
the victorious team. Currently,
the Axe is enjoying an extended
stay on the Farm today will
mark the 1,463 rd consecutive day
the Axe has remained at Stan
ford, and Stanford fans hope to
increase that number to 1,829
days by the time Big Game 1992
is played at Berkeley.
The Stanford class of 1991 was
the first class since 1967 to hold
the Axe for its entire four-year
stay at Stanford, and the class of
1992 is ready to be next.
Whether the two teams are
battling to stay out of the Pac-10
cellar (as they were during my
freshman year) or nationally
ranked and playing on national
TV for the number-two spot in
the league (as they are during my
junior year), Big Game will
always be for the Axe.
Ask any football player from
either school, and they'll tell you
how much this particular garden
tool means to them, and how they
would trade all the wins of the
season for a victory against the
school from across the bay, Big
Game glory and possession of the
fabled Stanford Axe.

with the Axe.
For thirty-one years, the Axe remained
locked in a Berkeley bank vault and was
brought out at the annual Springtime
Rally to taunt Stanford.
But on April 3, 1930, a group of 21
freshmen from Sequoia Hall answered the
call of destiny, and decided that the time

had come for justice to be done. Posing as
sports reporters, they followed the Axe's
journey from the Springtime Rally back to
the bank where California's Grand Custo
dian of the Axe Norm Horner would seal it
up for another year.
As Horner stepped from his car with the
Axe, the "cameramen" stepped forward,
announcing, "We want to take a picture of
the Axe." As flashbulbs went off, the Stan
ford men grabbed the Axe and made off
through the San Francisco streets. With
the help of a few strategically-placed tear
gas bombs, the Axe made it out of the
hands of its Berkeley captors and back to
Stanford.
When the group arrived at Stanford,
news of the Axe's return traveled through
every dorm on campus. Despite the late
ness of the hour, an impromptu
rally quickly snowballed as Stan
ford students rejoiced over the
return of the Axe to its rightful
home. The group earned the
nickname "The Immortal Twen
ty-One" for their exploits, and
three years later the student gov
ernments of the two schools
signed an agreement making the
Axe the prize of the annual Big
Game.
Since those times, the Axe has
remained the legitimate trophy of
Big Game, although this hasn't
stopped students from both
schools from stealing it from time
to time. Stanford not only leads
California in Big Game victories
(45-37-11) but also in Axe-steal
ings (4-3).
Most recently, Stanford went
up 4-3 when the "Infamous
Three" called the UC-Berkeley
Rally Committee (guardians of
the Axe) claiming to be California
football coach Mike White and
asked that the Axe be brought to
Ming's for the Northern Califor
nia Football Writers' weekly
meeting (Why? All together now.
. .. "We want to take a picture!")

The Axe was returned in time
for Stanford to win it anyway in

the Big Game, 26-17, and it just
goes to show you how much they
learn at California in 43 years!
The game today will represent
the 94th meeting of Stanford and
California in the Big Game,and
the 55th awarding of the Axe to
the victorious team. Currently,
the Axe is enjoying an extended
stay on the Farm today will
mark the 1,463 rd consecutive day
the Axe has remained at Stan
ford, and Stanford fans hope to
increase that number to 1,829
days by the time Big Game 1992
is played at Berkeley.
The Stanford class of 1991 was
the first class since 1967 to hold
the Axe for its entire four-year
stay at Stanford, and the class of
1992 is ready to be next.
Whether the two teams are
battling to stay out of the Pac-10
cellar (as they were during my
freshman year) or nationally
ranked and playing on national
TV for the number-two spot in
the league (as they are during my
junior year), Big Game will
always be for the Axe.
Ask any football player from
either school, and they'll tell you
how much this particular garden
tool means to them, and how they
would trade all the wins of the
season for a victory against the
school from across the bay, Big
Game glory and possession of the
fabled Stanford Axe.
So, you're anxiously awaiting the start
of the 94th Stanford-California Big Game,
and you're wondering to yourself, "What's
so special about a 100-year old axe, and
why the heck would two football teams
want to beat each other to a pulp on the
football field over it?"
Not just any axe. The Axe. The Stanford
Axe. And, though other axes throughout
history may have seen more actual wood
chopping, it is safe to say that no other axe
has traveled quite as extensively, seen as
many sights, or turned up in as many
places as the Stanford Axe.

Weenies covet it. Freshmen marvel at it.
For years it has been the symbol of the
rivalry between Stanford and that other
school across the bay the University of
California at Berkeley.

And the story of the Axe is the tale of
that rivalry, the story of how much that
other school has always wanted that which
belongs to Stanford....
The story begins in 1896, after the
fierce rivalry between the schools from
opposite sides of the bay had already
begun. Stanford yell leaders Will Irwin and
Chris Bradley composed a new cheer for
the home team. The chant's chorus, "Give
'em the axe, the axe, the axe!" garnered it
the title of the "Axe Yell," and it inspired
Stanford to victory over the Golden Bears
in many sports (it took California seven
Big Games before it won its first).
Three years later, during a three-game
baseball series with Cal, yell leader Billy
Erb felt that a visual display was needed to
excite the Stanford crowd for the Axe Yell,
so he purchased a broadaxe with a fifteen
inch blade and used it to decapitate a

stuffed blue and gold bear at that
evening's bonfire.
The display was so loved by the faithful
of the Farm that it was re-enacted the next
day April 15, 1899 at the game in San
Francisco. Unfortunately, California took
both the game and the series that day.
After the game, the yell leaders felt that
maybe the Axe was a symbol of bad luck
and should be left behind. Before they
could decide, however, a group of Cal fans
angered by the Axe display during the
game pounced on the group and ran away
with the Axe.
For thirty-one years, the Axe remained
locked in a Berkeley bank vault and was
brought out at the annual Springtime
