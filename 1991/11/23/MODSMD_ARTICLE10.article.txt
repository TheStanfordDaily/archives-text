# 'Can we take a picture?' The Axe legend lives on
## 
### Mike McDonough 
So, you're anxiously awaiting the start
of the 94th Stanford-California Big Game,
and you're wondering to yourself, "What's
so special about a 100-year old axe, and
why the heck would two football teams
want to beat each other to a pulp on the
football field over it?"
Not just any axe. The Axe. The Stanford
Axe. And, though other axes throughout
history may have seen more actual wood
chopping, it is safe to say that no other axe
has traveled quite as extensively, seen as
many sights, or turned up in as many
places as the Stanford Axe.

Weenies covet it. Freshmen marvel at it.
For years it has been the symbol of the
rivalry between Stanford and that other
school across the bay the University of
California at Berkeley.

And the story of the Axe is the tale of
that rivalry, the story of how much that
other school has always wanted that which
belongs to Stanford....
The story begins in 1896, after the
fierce rivalry between the schools from
opposite sides of the bay had already
begun. Stanford yell leaders Will Irwin and
Chris Bradley composed a new cheer for
the home team. The chant's chorus, "Give
'em the axe, the axe, the axe!" garnered it
the title of the "Axe Yell," and it inspired
Stanford to victory over the Golden Bears
in many sports (it took California seven
Big Games before it won its first).
Three years later, during a three-game
baseball series with Cal, yell leader Billy
Erb felt that a visual display was needed to
excite the Stanford crowd for the Axe Yell,
so he purchased a broadaxe with a fifteen
inch blade and used it to decapitate a

stuffed blue and gold bear at that
evening's bonfire.
The display was so loved by the faithful
of the Farm that it was re-enacted the next
day April 15, 1899 at the game in San
Francisco. Unfortunately, California took
both the game and the series that day.
After the game, the yell leaders felt that
maybe the Axe was a symbol of bad luck
and should be left behind. Before they
could decide, however, a group of Cal fans
angered by the Axe display during the
game pounced on the group and ran away
with the Axe.
For thirty-one years, the Axe remained
locked in a Berkeley bank vault and was
brought out at the annual Springtime
Rally to taunt Stanford.
But on April 3, 1930, a group of 21
freshmen from Sequoia Hall answered the
call of destiny, and decided that the time

had come for justice to be done. Posing as
sports reporters, they followed the Axe's
journey from the Springtime Rally back to
the bank where California's Grand Custo
dian of the Axe Norm Horner would seal it
up for another year.
As Horner stepped from his car with the
Axe, the "cameramen" stepped forward,
announcing, "We want to take a picture of
the Axe." As flashbulbs went off, the Stan
ford men grabbed the Axe and made off
through the San Francisco streets. With
the help of a few strategically-placed tear
gas bombs, the Axe made it out of the
hands of its Berkeley captors and back to
Stanford.
When the group arrived at Stanford,
news of the Axe's return traveled through
every dorm on campus. Despite the late
