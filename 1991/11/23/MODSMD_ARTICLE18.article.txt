# Milburn makes late surge
## Tailback battles injuries, expectations 
### Scott Reiss Staff writer 
Some have called him the best
back in Stanford history. He was
a pre-season All-American and a
legitimate Heisman Trophy can
didate. He also has a 3.0 grade
point average as a public policy
major.
And Glyn Milburn is a really
nice guy.
In today's world of collegiate
athletics where academics are so
often relegated to a secondary
role, Stanford's superstar run
ning back is also a star off the
field as a student as well as an
individual.
His football accomplishments
have been well documented. Mil
burn led the nation in all-purpose
yardage last season, finishing
with 2,222 total yards. He was a
first-team All-PAC-10 selection a
year ago. He is simply the type of
player who gives opposing coach
es nightmares.
"If there was one guy I wish
were out of the league, it would
be Glyn Milburn," remarked Cali
fornia coach Bruce Snyder.
With a professional football
career almost certainly looming
in his future, it would be easy for
Glyn Milburn to sit back and
coast through the remainder of
his academic career at Stanford.
But amidst all the hype, Milburn
still considers his education vital
ly important to his life a very
refreshing concept in a day and
time when million-dollar con
tracts for first-year professional
athletes are not uncommon.
"The smaller environment [of
Stanford] helps a student have
more of an identity at times.
Here, with a smaller campus, peo
ple are really able to find them
selves. . . . I've been able to see a
difference in coming to Stanford. I
am comfortable with just being
myself, being the silly guy that I
am a lot of the time," he said.
It is unfortunate, however,
that not everyone gets the oppor
tunity to see the non-football side
of Glyn Milburn; most people
know him only from what they
see on TV a great running
back with incredibly sweet moves.
Because of this, fans come to
expect a certain level of greatness
every time Milburn takes the

field. When his numbers during
the first half of this season were a
far cry from those expected of a
Heisman candidate, critics began
to wonder what the problem was.
"The first half of the season
[the Heisman talk] really did
affect me mentally," he said.
"When I didn't have the produc
tion numbers and the touch
downs, I felt the pressure to do

better, and I was more concerned
with the Heisman hype than
helping the team win football
games. That's when I had to step
back and do a self-check."
The other factor in Milburn's
relatively slow start was a
sprained knee suffered in week
two against Arizona. It was not,

Tailback Glyn Milburn rushes earlier this season against Oregon
State. Milburn will be looking to repeat his performance in last
year's Big Game, in which he amassed a Pac-10 record 379 all-purpose
yards.
