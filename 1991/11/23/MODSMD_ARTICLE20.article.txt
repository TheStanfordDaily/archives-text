# Big Bob Whitfield clears a path to greatness

Dominating, intimidating, and
powerful. Simply put, the man is
a force.
Standing a domineering 6-feet
7-inches tall and weighing a mas
sive 300 pounds, Stanford offen
sive tackle Bob Whitfield is some
one you do not want to make
angry. Especially on a football
field.
His imposing frame gives
defensive linemen the shivers.
Once Whitfield knocks them
down, only the defensive backs
and secondary remain to counter
the Cardinal's dangerous running
tandem of Tommy Vardell and
Glyn Milburn.

"They make your job a little
easier," Whifield said. "You
might not do a pretty good job on
a block, but they make something
out of nothing."
But most of the time, Whitfield
does more than a decent job, an
assertion demonstrated by the
fact that many experts consider
him to be the best offensive line
man in college football, period.
Coach Denny Green said, "I
think that Bob's playing better
football at left tackle than any
body in the country. I think he's
got a great chance of winning the
Outland Trophy, and he's proba
bly going to be a consensus Ail-
American. He's really playing
some dynamite football for us."
Indeed, he was listed as a first

team Ail-American in every pre
season college football publication
this year. Last year, he was one of
14 finalists, and the only sopho
more, for the Outland Trophy,
which is given to the nation's top
collegiate lineman. He was also
named firs-team All-Pacific 10
Conference after being named to
the second team in his freshman
season.
Despite the accolades, Whit
field is far from complacent. He
has started every game since he
arrived on the Farm in the fall of
1989. A hard worker, he is always
looking for ways to improve.
"F still have a lot to learn about
the sport," Whitfield said. "I'm
playing well at times, but I still
have to pick up my game from

time to time. I'm never really sat
isfied with how I play. I always
think that I can do better."

The junior from Carson, Calif.,
avoided the lure of Los Angeles
gangs to concentrate on school
and play football. He led Banning
High School to the Los Angeles
City Finals in 1988, was named
first team All-American by USA
Today, Street and Smith's and
Parade, and he earned the
Gatorade California state player
of the year award. He also was on
the honor roll.
Presently an engineering
major, he has adjusted to combin
ing the competitiveness of college
football with the rigors of a Stan

ford education. "It's kind of
tough (to balance), but you just
have to put the effort and time in
and you come out all right," he
said.
Whitfield attributed part of
his success to the strong relation
ship he has with Green.
"He's a great coach," he said..
"He's really helpful in a lot of the
things he does not just foot
ball."
The fondness is mutual for
Green: "He's one of the closest
players I've been associated with
in all my years. I know him real
well and get along with him real
well. He's got a good sense of
humor. He always plays hard,
but he likes to have a good time
at the same time, and that's real
ly important."
"There's a lot of aspects of col
lege football that I still have to
experience," Whitfield said.
"Being at Stanford for three years
we've played teams from all over
the country. Football is fun, but
that's just one part of college."
