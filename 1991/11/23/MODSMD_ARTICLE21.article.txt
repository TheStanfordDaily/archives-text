# Outside linebacker George gets in quarterbacks' faces
## 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
Three years ago outside line
backer Ron George wasn't even a
twinkle in the Cardinal's eye. The
Heidelberg, Germany, native
wasn't thinking about Stanford,
either. After all, the 209-lb athlete
had been accepted to the Air Force
Academy and was ready to become
a fighter pilot.
But all this changed after
George's first year at the Acade
my. Unhappy with "trying to be a
soldier, a football player, and a
student," George transferred to
Stanford in fall 1989.
Today George is the spark plug
that powers a much-improved
Cardinal defense. George has
started all 10 games at left out
side linebacker. He leads the Car
dinal in forced fumbles with four
and has recovered two more. He
is second on the team to safety
Seyon Albert in total tackles with
54 (36 unassisted), and he has
recorded eight sacks for minus-58
yards.
George's secret to tackling is
surprisingly simple: "Aim for the
numbers and put your head
through his chest."
That tackling method "works
every time," he said.
George said that as an outside
linebacker, he has several
responsibilities on defense.
"You have to cover backs run
ning the ball and try to stop the
320-lb offensive guard from
knocking you into the nickel
seats," he said.
But George's biggest problem
may be staying awake for such
bruising situations. While other
guys bang their heads against
lockers and rip apart Teddy bears
in the locker room before games,
George just falls asleep.

"In our stadium we have lock
er benches low enough where you
can stick your head inside the
locker where it's dark. I'm usual
ly in la-la-land for 20 minutes,"
George said.
George credits his impressive
numbers to his controlled
approach and calm demeanor.
"From the first snap it's a cold and
calculating game. I'm thinking
about my assignments and trying
to stop the offense. It's fun work,
but it's a precise science," he said.
George inherited such disci
pline from his father Robert, a 23-
year veteran Air Force major who
retired in 1984. Like most mili
tary families, the George family
moved often. Ron lived in Wash
ington, D.C. and Colorado Springs
before moving to Germany when
he was 8 years old.
While in Germany, where soc
cer is the number-one sport,
George competed year round
until he was a sophomore and
continued to play seasonally his
junior and senior years. He didn't
see action on the gridiron until he
was a senior.

"Football was just recreation,
something to do," George said.
But in one season, George
excelled. He tallied 72 tackles, six
sacks and two fumble recoveries
to earn All-Europe honors and a
ticket to the Air Force Academy.
George entered the Academy
one week after graduation and
was immediately thrust into rig
orous training a situation he
was not prepared for.
George transferred to Stanford
the following fall with his parents'
blessings, and he approached
head coach Denny Green.
"I came here as a pure stu
dent, not to play football. But
then I talked to Coach Green and
realized to be a part of the tradi
tion was the chance of a lifetime,"
George said.
A walk-on transfer, George
was forced to sit out the 1989
campaign due to NCAA rules. He
says this idle period was "far and
away the most difficult thing" he
experienced.
"You never get a chance to
play and show what you can do.
At times I thought to myself,
'maybe football wasn't for me,
maybe it wasn't the right thing to
do,' " George said.
George worked through this

initial self-doubt and switched
from defensive back to outside
linebacker the following Spring.
"I was rolling with the punch
es and just happy to be playing at
any position," he said.

Listed at the bottom of the
depth charts, George progressed
quickly under linebacker coach
David Tipton, who was one of the
"Thunder Chickens" of the 1971
Rose Bowl championship team.

"He sat me down and told me
what I had to do," George
explained. George assumed the
starting job after fifth-year senior
Chris Hawkins was injured and
debuted at Colorado in the first
game of the 1990 season.
"I was shaking in my boots. But
then I realized it's time to play
football, and I had a lot of fun out
there," George said.
He said his most rewarding
experience came in last year's Big
Game.
"I finally understood for the
first time the tradition of Stanford
football and the intense rivalry
[with California]," George said.
George figures to spearhead the
defensive attack on the Citrus-bowl
bound Bears today.
"They better prepare for war,"
he said.

soldier, a football player, and a
student," George transferred to
Stanford in fall 1989.
Today George is the spark plug
that powers a much-improved
Cardinal defense. George has
started all 10 games at left out
side linebacker. He leads the Car
dinal in forced fumbles with four
and has recovered two more. He
is second on the team to safety
Seyon Albert in total tackles with
54 (36 unassisted), and he has
recorded eight sacks for minus-58
yards.
George's secret to tackling is
surprisingly simple: "Aim for the
numbers and put your head
through his chest."
That tackling method "works
every time," he said.
George said that as an outside
linebacker, he has several
responsibilities on defense.
"You have to cover backs run
ning the ball and try to stop the
320-lb offensive guard from
knocking you into the nickel
seats," he said.
But George's biggest problem
may be staying awake for such
bruising situations. While other
guys bang their heads against
lockers and rip apart Teddy bears
in the locker room before games,
George just falls asleep.

"In our stadium we have lock
er benches low enough where you
can stick your head inside the
locker where it's dark. I'm usual
ly in la-la-land for 20 minutes,"
George said.
George credits his impressive
numbers to his controlled
approach and calm demeanor.
"From the first snap it's a cold and
calculating game. I'm thinking
about my assignments and trying
to stop the offense. It's fun work,
but it's a precise science," he said.
George inherited such disci
pline from his father Robert, a 23-
year veteran Air Force major who
retired in 1984. Like most mili
tary families, the George family
moved often. Ron lived in Wash
ington, D.C. and Colorado Springs
before moving to Germany when
he was 8 years old.
While in Germany, where soc
cer is the number-one sport,
George competed year round
until he was a sophomore and
continued to play seasonally his
junior and senior years. He didn't
see action on the gridiron until he
was a senior.

"Football was just recreation,
something to do," George said.
But in one season, George
excelled. He tallied 72 tackles, six
sacks and two fumble recoveries
to earn All-Europe honors and a
ticket to the Air Force Academy.
George entered the Academy
one week after graduation and
was immediately thrust into rig
orous training a situation he
was not prepared for.
George transferred to Stanford
the following fall with his parents'
blessings, and he approached
head coach Denny Green.
"I came here as a pure stu
dent, not to play football. But
then I talked to Coach Green and
realized to be a part of the tradi
tion was the chance of a lifetime,"
George said.
A walk-on transfer, George
was forced to sit out the 1989
campaign due to NCAA rules. He
says this idle period was "far and
away the most difficult thing" he
experienced.
"You never get a chance to
play and show what you can do.
At times I thought to myself,
'maybe football wasn't for me,
maybe it wasn't the right thing to
do,' " George said.
George worked through this

initial self-doubt and switched
from defensive back to outside
linebacker the following Spring.
"I was rolling with the punch
es and just happy to be playing at
any position," he said.

Listed at the bottom of the
depth charts, George progressed
quickly under linebacker coach
David Tipton, who was one of the
"Thunder Chickens" of the 1971
Rose Bowl championship team.

"He sat me down and told me
what I had to do," George
explained. George assumed the
starting job after fifth-year senior
Chris Hawkins was injured and
debuted at Colorado in the first
game of the 1990 season.
"I was shaking in my boots. But
then I realized it's time to play
football, and I had a lot of fun out
there," George said.
He said his most rewarding
experience came in last year's Big
Game.
"I finally understood for the
first time the tradition of Stanford
football and the intense rivalry
[with California]," George said.
George figures to spearhead the
defensive attack on the Citrus-bowl
bound Bears today.
"They better prepare for war,"
he said.
