# Snyder, Green: successful program builders
## 
### Kevin Jeffery 
Russell White will likely be
named first-team All-American.
Steve Stenstrom has yet to lose in
six collegiate starts. Brian Treggs
just became Cal's all-time leading
receiver. Tommy Vardell has
rushed for more touchdowns than
anyone in Stanford histoiy.
This season has seen incredible
individual performances on both
sides of the Bay, but the resur
gence of these once-lamentable
ball clubs was not an overnight
transformation brought on by a
few great players making a few
great plays.
Rather, the bowl bids, the
national rankings and the winning
records that we see before us are
the products of diligent, long-term
program building, and the credit
here lies not only with Bruce Sny
der and Denny Green but with the
administrations of both schools
for sticking with their coaches
through lean times.
Both Snyder and Green inherit
ed teams going nowhere. And when
a head coach takes the reins of such
a team, it's often more important
to value the establishment of a new
philosophy ahead of immediate
success in the won-lost column.
That often means bringing in

unfamiliar systems, which may
take a while for players to get used
to and have short-run ill effects. It
could also mean benching a proven
veteran in favor of a less talented
youngster who the new coach sim
ply feels is "his kind of player."
All this sounds fine and dandy
a little short-run loss for long
term prosperity until you con
sider that nine out of ten schools
probably aren't quite so patient
with their coaches. Sticking with a
coach through a couple of losing
seasons isn't so easy with money
toting alumni, who are fed up with
"rebuilding" and demand immedi
ate results.
"New philosophies" don't sell
tickets. "Teams in transition"
don't attract bowl bids or televi
sion contracts. More often than
not, coaches who don't produce
tangible improvement (read: wins)
right away aren't around to see
the rebuilding process through.
Neither Green nor Snyder used
the terms "transition" or "rebuild
ing" too often; certainly neither
proffered them as excuses when
their teams suffered losing records
in their first two or three seasons.
But quite clearly both were as
focused on implementing new

mentalities and new styles of play
as they were on winning games in
their program's nascent years.
"I think Coach Snyder has an
innate ability to see things in peo
ple that others can't. He recruits
players with big hearts, with
courage, with the desire to win. He
knows what (kind of team) he
wants, and he fills in the people
that give it to him. That's the way
you build a strong program," said
Cal quarterback Mike Pawlawski.
Snyder's method of program
building through selective,
insightful recruiting was not
without its early hard times. He
struggled with players he hadn't
personally brought to Cal, and Cal
didn't have a winning record until
his fourth season. The university,
nevertheless, stood with Snyder,
and now with a team full of play
ers indoctrinated with his aggres

sive, "courageous" style, he has
brought Cal to the promise land of
national prominence.

Green likewise had a different
recruiting philosophy than his
predecessor he was determined
to erase Stanford's image as a
purely finesse team. He demoted
players who had come to the Farm
via Jack Elway and whose work
ethic did not match his own, and,
similar to Snyder, Green and his
Cardinal struggled through a pair
of sub-.500 campaigns.
The decision to stand behind
coach Green was made a bit easier
by the fact that the changes he
was attempting to effect were visi
ble even in Cardinal defeats. Stan
ford was playing a different brand
of football: hard-nosed defense,
running the ball behind a bruising
offensive line; even those disap
pointed in Green's won-lost record
could not deny that something
was changing.

This season the elements of
Denny-ball seem to have fallen into
place, especially during the Cardi
nal's six-game win streak. Indeed,
Green has gone so far as to label
the 1991 club the "Now Boys,"
indicating that his troops have
completed the so-called transition

stage "Now" is their time.
"Stanford's always had some
good players, but now we view
ourselves in a different way. I
think we're a pretty good football
team. When I got here we weren't
a good football team. We used to
'talk that talk.' Now we can 'walk
that walk,' " commented colloqui
al coach Green.

It's been a treat for Bay Area
fans to observe the about-face per
formed simultaneously by Cal and
Stanford. It's early to speculate,
but it seems that both programs
built on solid foundations by
foresighted coaches will have
some staying power.
Certainly it's gratifying to see
that the patient trust both schools
placed with their coaches paid div
idends. And as Snyder says, it's
even more satisfying to know that
these two schools are breaking
down the widely-held perception
that winning football and academ
ic excellence are mutually exclu
sive within an institution.

Kevin Jeffery still misses the old
Flagboy. He wishes Flag-man
would go back to his rightful posi
tion amidst the other Cardinal
defensive linemen.
