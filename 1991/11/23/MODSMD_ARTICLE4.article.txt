# Battle of the Bay: bowl-bound Card, Bears fight for Axe
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Editorial staff 
Brent Musburger will probably
tell a first-ever national audience
that after decades of being mired
in mediocrity, this year's Big
Game will finally live up to its
billing.
But the truth is Big Game has
been Big for 99 years, and both
California and Stanford know
that a few extra wins on each side
won't make much difference by
the kickoff of the 94th Battle for
the Axe.
"I don't think (the team's
records) change the emotion of
the game. I can't believe this
game can be any more emotional
than the ones I've been through
already," said California coach
Bruce Snyder.
"Big Game takes on a new
dimension every time, regardless
of what the records of the team's
are," echoed his counterpart
Denny Green.
The Cardinal enter the regular
season finale at 7-3, ranked No.
21, and headed for an Aloha Bowl
match-up with Georgia Tech. The
9-1 Golden Bears are ranked No.
6 and will face Clemson in the
Florida Citrus Bowl on New
Year's Day.
Green has already said that he
doesn't think this year's game
will match the drama of 1990,
and who can blame him. By now
there are at least 250,000 people
who watched the Cardinal score
nine points in the final twelve
seconds to win 27-25.
Jason Palumbis quarterbacked
a 5 5-second Stanford touchdown
drive which brought the Cardinal
to within 25-24 with 19 seconds
remaining. Cal intercepted the
two-point conversion try, and
Berkeley fans imprudently

stormed the field, pretentiously
proclaiming victory . . . " Please
clear the field, the game is not
over " ... But they cost the Bears
15 yards, and an onside kick and
one roughing-the-passer penalty
later, John Hopkins kicked the
39-yard field goal that at long last
avenged The Play.
If Big Game 1991 isn't remem
bered for its dramatics, it will cer
tainly be remembered for a no
holds-barred, pre-game jawing
session. Players' quotes have
made headlines all week.
California wide receiver Brian
Treggs assumed his customary
role as trash-talk initiator imme
diately following the Bears' victo
ry over Arizona State last week,
badmouthing the Cardinal sec
ondary and declaring (as he has
virtually every week) that "no
one they have can cover me." He
also promised not to return
home, but to move to Palo Alto, if
the Bears failed to win for the
fifth consecutive year.
Bob Whitfield, Cardinal tackle,
was right there with a counter
punch: "They're 9-1, but we're
going to bust them up. They're not
good enough to beat Stanford." As
for Mr. Treggs? "He sucks."
But Golden Bear quarterback
Mike Pawlawski delivered what
was probably the week's lowest
blow, as he directed it not at the
Stanford football team, but at the
Farm as a whole. "I hate Stanford
and eveiything it stands for," he
taunted. And what exactly is does
it stand for? "Posh, uppity, arro
gance .. . their school's no better
than our's, they just spend all of
Daddy's money."
"Cal's a team that's never
been afraid to say what they
feel," Green understated. But, he
added, "I don't think there is any
thing wrong with that. Both

teams are going to come out and
play good, clean, hard football,
and this game is going to be
decided on the field."
There the Bears will have to
contend with the ground attack of
senior fullback Tommy Vardell,
who puts a bit of fear in Snyder.
"Vardell may be the best back
we've faced all year ... he has
great balance. We're going to
have to tackle him, not just knock
him down," he said.
Vardell, the Cardinal's career
rushing touchdown leader with
34, needs just 98 yards to become
only the fourth player in Stanford
history to rush for 1,000 yards. He
and explosive tailback Glyn Mil
burn present the Bears with some
defensive strategy dilemmas.
"Whenever you can run the
football, it slows down everybody

in terms of pass rush. Our rush
has been able to effectively take
quarterbacks out of games; I
don't know that we can do that
against Stanford," Snyder said.
The core of the Bear defense—
middle linebackers Mick Barsala
and Jerrott Willard—will have to
split their attention between the
backfield duo and the Pac-10's
leading passer, Steve Stenstrom.
Stenstrom, the nation's fifth
rated quarterback, is the first
Cardinal signal caller since
Frankie Albert to win his first six
starts.
California's offense, ranked
second in the conference in scor
ing, is led by 1,000-yard rusher
Russell White. White gained 177
on the ground in last year's big
game, but the Cardinal defense is
a much stronger unit than a year

ago, especially the run defense.
Inside linebacker Coy Gibbs and
defensive tackle Estevan Avila
have led the squad to a No. 23
national ranking in total yards
allowed.
Outside linebackers Dave Gar
nett and Ron George will attempt
to pressure Pawlawski as he
throws to wideouts Treggs and
Sean Dawkins. Both receivers are
among the conference's top ten in
receiving yards.
Despite the game's plethora of
stars at the skill position, Green
predicts this Big Game will be
decided in the trenches.
"This game will probably be
won up front. And when the
game is over I think it will be
clear which group of lineman was
able to dominate the line of
scrimmage," Green said.
Brent Musburger will probably
tell a first-ever national audience
that after decades of being mired
in mediocrity, this year's Big

remaining. Cal intercepted the
two-point conversion try, and
Berkeley fans imprudently

stormed the field, pretentiously
proclaiming victory . . . " Please
clear the field, the game is not
over " ... But they cost the Bears
15 yards, and an onside kick and
one roughing-the-passer penalty
later, John Hopkins kicked the
39-yard field goal that at long last
avenged The Play.
If Big Game 1991 isn't remem
bered for its dramatics, it will cer
tainly be remembered for a no
holds-barred, pre-game jawing
session. Players' quotes have
made headlines all week.
California wide receiver Brian
Treggs assumed his customary
role as trash-talk initiator imme
diately following the Bears' victo
ry over Arizona State last week,
badmouthing the Cardinal sec
ondary and declaring (as he has
virtually every week) that "no
one they have can cover me." He
also promised not to return
home, but to move to Palo Alto, if
the Bears failed to win for the
fifth consecutive year.
Bob Whitfield, Cardinal tackle,
was right there with a counter
punch: "They're 9-1, but we're
going to bust them up. They're not
good enough to beat Stanford." As
for Mr. Treggs? "He sucks."
But Golden Bear quarterback
Mike Pawlawski delivered what
was probably the week's lowest
blow, as he directed it not at the
Stanford football team, but at the
Farm as a whole. "I hate Stanford
and eveiything it stands for," he
taunted. And what exactly is does
it stand for? "Posh, uppity, arro
gance .. . their school's no better
than our's, they just spend all of
Daddy's money."
"Cal's a team that's never
been afraid to say what they
feel," Green understated. But, he
added, "I don't think there is any
thing wrong with that. Both

teams are going to come out and
play good, clean, hard football,
and this game is going to be
decided on the field."
There the Bears will have to
contend with the ground attack of
senior fullback Tommy Vardell,
who puts a bit of fear in Snyder.
"Vardell may be the best back
we've faced all year ... he has
great balance. We're going to
have to tackle him, not just knock
him down," he said.
Vardell, the Cardinal's career
rushing touchdown leader with
34, needs just 98 yards to become
only the fourth player in Stanford
history to rush for 1,000 yards. He
and explosive tailback Glyn Mil
burn present the Bears with some
defensive strategy dilemmas.
"Whenever you can run the
football, it slows down everybody

in terms of pass rush. Our rush
has been able to effectively take
quarterbacks out of games; I
don't know that we can do that
against Stanford," Snyder said.
The core of the Bear defense—
middle linebackers Mick Barsala
and Jerrott Willard—will have to
split their attention between the
backfield duo and the Pac-10's
leading passer, Steve Stenstrom.
Stenstrom, the nation's fifth
rated quarterback, is the first
Cardinal signal caller since
Frankie Albert to win his first six
starts.
California's offense, ranked
second in the conference in scor
ing, is led by 1,000-yard rusher
Russell White. White gained 177
on the ground in last year's big
game, but the Cardinal defense is
a much stronger unit than a year

ago, especially the run defense.
Inside linebacker Coy Gibbs and
defensive tackle Estevan Avila
have led the squad to a No. 23
national ranking in total yards
allowed.
Outside linebackers Dave Gar
nett and Ron George will attempt
to pressure Pawlawski as he
throws to wideouts Treggs and
Sean Dawkins. Both receivers are
among the conference's top ten in
receiving yards.
Despite the game's plethora of
stars at the skill position, Green
predicts this Big Game will be
decided in the trenches.
"This game will probably be
won up front. And when the
game is over I think it will be
clear which group of lineman was
able to dominate the line of
scrimmage," Green said.
Brent Musburger will probably
tell a first-ever national audience
that after decades of being mired
in mediocrity, this year's Big
Game will finally live up to its
billing.
But the truth is Big Game has
been Big for 99 years, and both
California and Stanford know
that a few extra wins on each side
won't make much difference by
the kickoff of the 94th Battle for
the Axe.
"I don't think (the team's
records) change the emotion of
the game. I can't believe this
game can be any more emotional
than the ones I've been through
already," said California coach
Bruce Snyder.
"Big Game takes on a new
dimension every time, regardless
of what the records of the team's
are," echoed his counterpart
Denny Green.
The Cardinal enter the regular
season finale at 7-3, ranked No.
21, and headed for an Aloha Bowl
match-up with Georgia Tech. The
9-1 Golden Bears are ranked No.
6 and will face Clemson in the
Florida Citrus Bowl on New
Year's Day.
Green has already said that he
doesn't think this year's game
will match the drama of 1990,
and who can blame him. By now
there are at least 250,000 people
who watched the Cardinal score
nine points in the final twelve
seconds to win 27-25.
Jason Palumbis quarterbacked
a 5 5-second Stanford touchdown
drive which brought the Cardinal
to within 25-24 with 19 seconds
remaining. Cal intercepted the
two-point conversion try, and
Berkeley fans imprudently

stormed the field, pretentiously
proclaiming victory . . . " Please
