# Seniors look to go out unbeaten in Big Games
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Big Game is always surround
ed by the hoopla and excitement
that go hand-in-hand with a tra
ditional rivalry. For the fifth-year
seniors on the Cardinal squad,
however, the game will take on
added significance as their last
chance to perform in front of a
home crowd.
Over the past five years, these
players have worked hard to help
bring the team to where it is today.
They arrived on the heels of the
Cardinal's 1986 Gator Bowl
appearance with high expectations.
The next four years, however, saw
the Cardinal consistently end the
season with a losing record.
Those players who weathered
the hard times have finally received
their payoff this year, as the
nationally-ranked Cardinal enjoys
a 7-3 overall record and is prepar
ing for a trip to the Aloha Bowl.
Each victory has been especially
sweet for the players who have also
witnessed the team's struggles.
"We came in as freshmen with
high expectations and had back
to-back losing seasons," fullback
Tommy Vardell said. "A lot of peo
ple dropped off the wagon at that
point. For the handful of fifth
year seniors who stuck it out, this
season's success has been a great
reward. We worked through some
really hard times, and there's a
strong bond amongst us."
Wide receiver Chris Walsh
agreed. "This season is very
meaningful for the fifth-year
seniors," he said. "Everyone has
really been working their tails off
all season because this is our last
chance to do anything for Stan
ford football."

The list of what these players
have accomplished during their
careers here is impressive. As a
tribute to their dedication to the
team, here is a summary of their
contributions:
"Touchdown Tommy" Vardell
has earned his nickname several
times over. The 6-3, 235-lb fullback
from El Cajon, California came to
Stanford virtually unknown, but
has since established himself as one
of the most powerful fullbacks in
the country.
He has also etched his name
into Stanford history by surpass
ing several school records. His 17
touchdowns and 102 points this
year are the largest ever amassed
in one season. He is second on the
Stanford career touchdown list
with 34, and he holds the Stan
ford record for career rushing
touchdowns.
This season he has 902 yards
rushing, with six 100-yard rush
ing games. Referred to as "the
heart and soul of the team" by
junior running back Glyn Mil
burn, Vardell is also a co-captain
of the squad.
"Tommy is a true All-American
and a true team leader," coach
Denny Green said. "He has devel
oped a lot (over the past five years).
When he first came here, very few
people had heard of him. Now he
has become one of the finest pure
fullbacks in the country."
When the ball is thrown rather
than handed off, a favorite target
is 6-1, 185-lb wide receiver Chris
Walsh. Walsh stepped in to fill
the shoes of first-team All-Ameri
can Ed McCaffrey this year, and
has proved himself up to the task.
This season alone, Walsh has
caught the ball 62 times for a
total of 894 yards, both figures

placing him sixth in Stanford's
single season record books.
Over the span of his career he
has 137 receptions, the eighth
highest number in Cardinal his
tory. Currently, Walsh is ranked
2nd in the Pacific-10 Conference
both in receptions per game
(6.20) and receiving yards per
game (89.40).
Walsh's counterpart, flanker
Jon Pinckney, is another fifth
year senior. He has been known
to make the big play when it
counts, including a pivotal 66-
yard touchdown reception against
UCLA two weeks ago.
This season, he has 22 recep
tions for 396 yards and four
touchdowns. During the 1989
season, his average of 19.0 yards
per reception and five touch
downs were team highs.
On the defensive side, 6-0, 200-
lb Albert Richardson has played
both cornerback and strong safety
for the Cardinal. This season he
has racked up 47 total tackles,
recovered four fumbles and inter
cepted the ball twice.
Last week against Washington
State, he recovered a fumble in
the second quarter that shifted
the momentum in favor of the
Cardinal at a critical juncture in
the game. Over his career he
hasl24 total tackles, 5 fumble
recoveries, 10 pass deflections
and 7 interceptions.
Quarterback Jason Palumbis
led the Cardinal during the 1990
season with a school-record com
pletion percentage of .686. He
completed 234-of-341 passes for
2,579 yards and 11 touchdowns.
He finished first in the Pacific-10
Conference in passing efficiency,
