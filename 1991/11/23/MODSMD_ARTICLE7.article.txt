# The 						scoop on 94th
## Big Game 
### David Schwartz 
Bears. Trees. Cardinal, White,
Blue, Gold. Axes. The fray by the
Bay. What does it all mean?
In this, the 94th meeting
between Stanford and California,
the world will finally know our
secret. Arguably, for the first
time ever, this game will be truly
Big.

Prior to today, aside from the
people in the Bay area, alumni of
both schools and avid Pac-10
football fans, the Big Game was
an unknown. Remarkably, few
know about the Bay Area trea
sure which dates back to 1892.
If you had asked someone in
Alabama if they knew about it,
they'd probably reply, "who's
playing?", and then when you
told them Stanford and Cal, they
would say, "Stanford and Cal?!?
Aren't those two schools in Cali
fornia somewhere? If the 'Tide
isn't playin', how can you call a
game big?"

As we sit watching the Cardi
nal and Bears duel it out, we will
not be alone. ABC will televise
the game to 92 percent of the
nation. And when Brent Mus
burger says "You are looking live
at Stanford Stadium, where
today Stanford and Cal will meet
in the Big Game," the rest of the
country will understand. Today's
Big Game is a Big Game. Consid
er:

• This is the first time ever
that both teams are bowl-bound.
Stanford will be playing Georgia
Tech in the Aloha Bowl, while
California will take on Clemson
in the Florida Citrus Bowl.
• This is the first time since
1979 that both teams enter the
game with winning records, and
the first time since 1968 that
both teams are ranked in the
same week.
• Both teams swept traditional
powers and southern California,
rivals USC and UCLA for the
first time since 1941.
This game must be pretty
important, because ABC bumped
the battle of Los Angeles (USC
UCLA) to cable to televise it.
However, since this game is on
national television for the first
time, we have to be careful to
make it a good one.
You see, for most of the coun
try, games like USC-UCLA, or
Texas-Texas A&M, or Alabama-
Auburn, are pretty easy to
understand. Bragging rights are
at stake, and that's what the
teams are playing for. Those
familiar with the Harvard-Yale
game know that the two "big
names" of the Ivy League meet
to engage in sixty minutes of
mediocre Division I-AA football
to come away with evidence in
arguments for intellectual brag
ging rights "bottom line: who
won in football?"
But at California and Stan
ford, things are a little bit more
sophisticated. When you pit the
top two academic institutions in
the Golden State and the west
coast, and two of the top fifteen
universities in the nation, that
also happen to be two of the top
25 football teams in the country
against each other, bragging
rights are not merely enough.
Stanford and California are
hybrids—places that can compete
with top competition on the field
as well as in U.S. News & World
Report. Stanford and California


I Schwartz on Sports
are unique institutions whose
rivalry has traits which need
explaining to the rest of the
nation. Allow me clarify the facts.
• A brief rundown on Califor
nia: California is located in
Berkeley, sight of many protests
in the 60's. Many of the
protesters still haven't left. You
can also refer to California as Cal,
UC, or UC-Berkeley you have
the power to choose. Its colors are
blue and gold. Its nickname is the
Golden Bears, though many pre
fer the unofficial yet shorter ver
sion —Weenies. Its mascot is
Oski, a stuffed bear-like creature
who is cute but overweight.

• A brief rundown on Stan
ford: Stanford is located in Palo
Alto, in the middle of Silicon Val
ley. Its colors are cardinal and
white. Its nickname is the Cardi
nal the color, not the bird. Its
mascot is a tree which is known
as The Tree.
• The Axe: There is more to
Big Game than just bragging
rights. There is something tangi
ble, something you can hold onto
for an entire year if you win. It is
called the Stanford Axe. The
schools used to steal each others'
axes until it was made the prize
of the gridiron battle. Instead of

stealing, the schools now use
football as a more civilized way of
settling the possession of the
prized carpentry tool.
That was pretty basic. Now, I
will field questions.
1) Question: East coasters who
read the New York Times or the
Wall Street Journal ask, "Aha!
Stanford. That's the place that
ripped off the government to buy
its President's yacht. Did you
give ABC any of our tax money to
televise your 'Big Game.'?"
Answer: No, ABC is actually pay
ing us. But if you'd like to send
any contributions, we'll take 'em.
2) Question: "What kind of
nickname is the Cardinal? Didn't
you guys use to be the Indians?
At least Cal has a nickname. How
do you root for a color?" Answer:
We are the Cardinal the color,
not the bird. We were the Indi
ans, but that wasn't PC so some
one suggested the Cardinal, just
like Harvard roots for the Crim
son, Syracuse roots for the
Orangemen, Cornell roots for the
Big Red, and Alabama roots for
the Crimson Tide. Those teams
seem to get along fine.
3) Question: "Cal's nickname
is the Bears, and their mascot is a
bear. If a color, not a bird (which
would make more sense), is your
nickname, why a tree?" Good
question. The answer is: You
can't put someone is a Cardinal
sheet and have him/her pace

around. The glorious tree symbol
izes the California redwoods. You
might think its lame, but we like
it! It has personality. It is unique.
And it is never out of style
because it changes its costume
every year.

4) Question: "What's your
fight song? Cal has a fight song. I
have a friend whose third cousin
once-removed goes to Stanford,
and he says you dance around to
some rock tune whenever you
score." Good question. The
answer is: He's right. We don't
have a fight song per se. But we
do have rhythm. Besides, how
many times do you want to hear
the same song over and over?
5) Question: "Why don't you
have a marching band? Cal has a
marching band." Good question.
The answer is: Our band would
get bored quickly if it had to stay
in straight lines all the time. This
way, they can make exciting polit
ical commentaries and witty
satires, and they can even try to
prevent a touchdown in the Big
Game.
All right, I've just about had
enough with the questions. I'll
allow, out of the kindness of my
heart, one last question.
6) "Who's going to win Big
Game?" Dumb question. The
answer is obvious.

Texas-Texas A&M, or Alabama-
Auburn, are pretty easy to
understand. Bragging rights are
at stake, and that's what the
teams are playing for. Those
familiar with the Harvard-Yale
game know that the two "big
names" of the Ivy League meet
to engage in sixty minutes of
mediocre Division I-AA football
to come away with evidence in
arguments for intellectual brag
ging rights "bottom line: who
won in football?"
But at California and Stan
ford, things are a little bit more
sophisticated. When you pit the
top two academic institutions in
the Golden State and the west
coast, and two of the top fifteen
universities in the nation, that
also happen to be two of the top
25 football teams in the country
against each other, bragging
rights are not merely enough.
Stanford and California are
hybrids—places that can compete
with top competition on the field
as well as in U.S. News & World
Report. Stanford and California


I Schwartz on Sports
are unique institutions whose
rivalry has traits which need
explaining to the rest of the
nation. Allow me clarify the facts.
• A brief rundown on Califor
nia: California is located in
Berkeley, sight of many protests
in the 60's. Many of the
protesters still haven't left. You
can also refer to California as Cal,
UC, or UC-Berkeley you have
the power to choose. Its colors are
blue and gold. Its nickname is the
Golden Bears, though many pre
fer the unofficial yet shorter ver
sion —Weenies. Its mascot is
Oski, a stuffed bear-like creature
who is cute but overweight.

• A brief rundown on Stan
ford: Stanford is located in Palo
Alto, in the middle of Silicon Val
ley. Its colors are cardinal and
white. Its nickname is the Cardi
nal the color, not the bird. Its
mascot is a tree which is known
as The Tree.
• The Axe: There is more to
Big Game than just bragging
rights. There is something tangi
ble, something you can hold onto
for an entire year if you win. It is
called the Stanford Axe. The
schools used to steal each others'
axes until it was made the prize
of the gridiron battle. Instead of

stealing, the schools now use
football as a more civilized way of
settling the possession of the
prized carpentry tool.
That was pretty basic. Now, I
will field questions.
1) Question: East coasters who
read the New York Times or the
Wall Street Journal ask, "Aha!
Stanford. That's the place that
ripped off the government to buy
its President's yacht. Did you
give ABC any of our tax money to
televise your 'Big Game.'?"
Answer: No, ABC is actually pay
ing us. But if you'd like to send
any contributions, we'll take 'em.
2) Question: "What kind of
nickname is the Cardinal? Didn't
you guys use to be the Indians?
At least Cal has a nickname. How
do you root for a color?" Answer:
We are the Cardinal the color,
not the bird. We were the Indi
ans, but that wasn't PC so some
one suggested the Cardinal, just
like Harvard roots for the Crim
son, Syracuse roots for the
Orangemen, Cornell roots for the
Big Red, and Alabama roots for
the Crimson Tide. Those teams
seem to get along fine.
3) Question: "Cal's nickname
is the Bears, and their mascot is a
bear. If a color, not a bird (which
would make more sense), is your
nickname, why a tree?" Good
question. The answer is: You
can't put someone is a Cardinal
sheet and have him/her pace

around. The glorious tree symbol
izes the California redwoods. You
might think its lame, but we like
it! It has personality. It is unique.
And it is never out of style
because it changes its costume
every year.

4) Question: "What's your
fight song? Cal has a fight song. I
have a friend whose third cousin
once-removed goes to Stanford,
and he says you dance around to
some rock tune whenever you
score." Good question. The
answer is: He's right. We don't
have a fight song per se. But we
do have rhythm. Besides, how
many times do you want to hear
the same song over and over?
5) Question: "Why don't you
have a marching band? Cal has a
marching band." Good question.
The answer is: Our band would
get bored quickly if it had to stay
in straight lines all the time. This
way, they can make exciting polit
ical commentaries and witty
satires, and they can even try to
prevent a touchdown in the Big
Game.
All right, I've just about had
enough with the questions. I'll
allow, out of the kindness of my
heart, one last question.
6) "Who's going to win Big
Game?" Dumb question. The
answer is obvious.

This is Schwartz. This is Schwartz
on Sports. Any Questions'?
Bears. Trees. Cardinal, White,
Blue, Gold. Axes. The fray by the
Bay. What does it all mean?
In this, the 94th meeting
between Stanford and California,
the world will finally know our
secret. Arguably, for the first
time ever, this game will be truly
Big.

Prior to today, aside from the
people in the Bay area, alumni of
both schools and avid Pac-10
football fans, the Big Game was
an unknown. Remarkably, few
know about the Bay Area trea
sure which dates back to 1892.
If you had asked someone in
Alabama if they knew about it,
they'd probably reply, "who's
playing?", and then when you
told them Stanford and Cal, they
would say, "Stanford and Cal?!?
Aren't those two schools in Cali
fornia somewhere? If the 'Tide
isn't playin', how can you call a
game big?"

As we sit watching the Cardi
nal and Bears duel it out, we will
not be alone. ABC will televise
the game to 92 percent of the
nation. And when Brent Mus
burger says "You are looking live
at Stanford Stadium, where
today Stanford and Cal will meet
in the Big Game," the rest of the
country will understand. Today's
Big Game is a Big Game. Consid
er:

• This is the first time ever
that both teams are bowl-bound.
Stanford will be playing Georgia
Tech in the Aloha Bowl, while
California will take on Clemson
in the Florida Citrus Bowl.
• This is the first time since
1979 that both teams enter the
game with winning records, and
the first time since 1968 that
both teams are ranked in the
same week.
• Both teams swept traditional
powers and southern California,
rivals USC and UCLA for the
first time since 1941.
This game must be pretty
important, because ABC bumped
the battle of Los Angeles (USC
UCLA) to cable to televise it.
However, since this game is on
national television for the first
time, we have to be careful to
make it a good one.
