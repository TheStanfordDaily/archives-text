# The
						scoop on 94th
## Big Game 
### David Schwartz 
Bears. Trees. Cardinal, White,
Blue, Gold. Axes. The fray by the
Bay. What does it all mean?
In this, the 94th meeting
between Stanford and California,
the world will finally know our
secret. Arguably, for the first
time ever, this game will be truly
Big.

Prior to today, aside from the
people in the Bay area, alumni of
both schools and avid Pac-10
football fans, the Big Game was
an unknown. Remarkably, few
know about the Bay Area trea
sure which dates back to 1892.
If you had asked someone in
Alabama if they knew about it,
they'd probably reply, "who's
playing?", and then when you
told them Stanford and Cal, they
would say, "Stanford and Cal?!?
Aren't those two schools in Cali
fornia somewhere? If the 'Tide
isn't playin', how can you call a
game big?"

As we sit watching the Cardi
nal and Bears duel it out, we will
not be alone. ABC will televise
the game to 92 percent of the
nation. And when Brent Mus
burger says "You are looking live
at Stanford Stadium, where
today Stanford and Cal will meet
in the Big Game," the rest of the
country will understand. Today's
Big Game is a Big Game. Consid
er:

• This is the first time ever
that both teams are bowl-bound.
Stanford will be playing Georgia
Tech in the Aloha Bowl, while
California will take on Clemson
in the Florida Citrus Bowl.
• This is the first time since
1979 that both teams enter the
game with winning records, and
the first time since 1968 that
both teams are ranked in the
same week.
• Both teams swept traditional
powers and southern California,
rivals USC and UCLA for the
first time since 1941.
This game must be pretty
important, because ABC bumped
the battle of Los Angeles (USC
UCLA) to cable to televise it.
However, since this game is on
national television for the first
time, we have to be careful to
make it a good one.
You see, for most of the coun
try, games like USC-UCLA, or
Texas-Texas A&M, or Alabama-
Auburn, are pretty easy to
understand. Bragging rights are
at stake, and that's what the
teams are playing for. Those
familiar with the Harvard-Yale
game know that the two "big
names" of the Ivy League meet
to engage in sixty minutes of
mediocre Division I-AA football
to come away with evidence in
arguments for intellectual brag
ging rights "bottom line: who
won in football?"
But at California and Stan
ford, things are a little bit more
sophisticated. When you pit the
top two academic institutions in
the Golden State and the west
coast, and two of the top fifteen
universities in the nation, that
also happen to be two of the top
25 football teams in the country
against each other, bragging
rights are not merely enough.
Stanford and California are
hybrids—places that can compete
with top competition on the field
as well as in U.S. News & World
Report. Stanford and California
