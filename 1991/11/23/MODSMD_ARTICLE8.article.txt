# California/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Looking for his first win
against the Cardinal, senior
quarterback Mike Pawlawski
directs the Pac-10's third-best
total offense. Pawlawski has
thrown for 18 touchdowns this
season, and is a finalist for the
nation's top quarterback
awards. But Dave Garnett and
fellow "G-man" Ron George look
to pressure Pawlawski into a few
interceptions and add to their
combined totals of 35 tackles for
a loss and 10 quarterback sacks.

Russell White leads the
vaunted California running
attack and is the leading rusher
in the Pac-10, averaging 108.8
yards per game. He has rushed
for more than 100 yards six
times this season and has
already topped 1000 yards for
the second year in a row. But
Estevan Avila and the Cardinal
rushing defense ranked third
in the Pac-10 will be gunning
to stop White. Avila leads the
defensive line with 42 total tack
les.

The California passing
offense will likely be dominated
by seniors today, as Pawlawski's
favorite target is senior wide
receiver Brian Treggs. Carrying
a streak of 34 consecutive games
with a reception, Treggs will
often line-up against Darrien
Gordon. Last week against
Washington State, Gordon
picked off his first pass of the
year and ran it back 42 yards for
a touchdown. Gordon also has
42 tackles on the season.

California's aggressive
defense often lines up eight men
on the line of scrimmage and
leaves free safety David Wilson
responsible for the deep cover
age. And Wilson has responded
to the pressure with four inter
ceptions and 63 tackles on the
year. Since being named the
starting quarterback, Steve
Stenstrom has led the Cardinal
to six consecutive wins and a
bowl appearance for the first
time since 1986. Enough said.

California's tough defense has
held opponents to fewer than
150 rushing yards per game, and
inside linebacker Jerrott Willard
leads the team with 68 tackles
12.5 for a loss. But "Touch
down" Tommy Vardell is looking
to add to his already-impressive
17 touchdowns on the season
and rush for another 100-yard
day. Vardell ranks third in the
Pac-10 with 90.2 yards per
game.

Stanford has held the axe for
five straight years and leads the
series with California 45-37-11.
