EVEN MORE OF EVERYTHING YOULL
EVER NEED TO SAY IN PERFECT LATIN
The recent
restoration of
Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel
ceiling frescoes has
astonished the
world. Centuries of
varnish and grime
were painstakingly
removed, and the
briliantly colored,
powerfully
modeled figures
were revealed in all
their original
radiance. Now, in
two magnificent
volumes, we see Michelangelo's
creation in all its splendor, in 600 full
color photograhs taken from the
restorers' scaffolds. Panoramas re
create the overarching grandeur of
each bay of the ceiling. Nearly life-size
closeups (many in gatefolds)
h
NEW from
Alfred A Knopt Publisher
illuminate the
intricacies of
Michelangelo's
working methods
and technique, and
the sheer painterly
beauty of the
images themselves.
The iconography of
the fresco cycle is
explained by the art
historian Frederick
Hartt, and
Michelangelo's
practices and the
history of the
ceiling are
discussed by the head of the
restoration team, Gianluigi
Colalucci.
A stunning and sumptuous objet de
luxe — magnificently produced —
that will stand unequaled in its
presentation of this unique
monument of Western art.
