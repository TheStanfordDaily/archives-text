# We've got the Axe
## Cardinal skins Bears, 38-21 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The mouths are shut, the
game is over and Stanford has
won.
Showing that pregame talk
does not mean anything come
game time, the Cardinal foot
ball team used a record-break
ing day from Tommy Vardell
and its trademark aggressive
defense to dominate the 94th
edition of Big Game 38-21 over
California.
"This is a great win for our
team because they played
hard," Stanford head coach
Denny Green said. "This was
by far the best and most phys
ical game we have played. It
was a significant game that we
had to play well in and we did."
California came into Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday full
of rhetoric. The Bears were the
sixth-ranked team in the coun
try. They were going to embar
rass the Cardinal and bring the
Axe back to Berkeley. They
even bought little ax necklaces
as motivation.
Cal can keep the jewelry.
Stanford is happy to have the
real thing.
"Emotions were running
high and Cal wanted to intimi
date us," inside linebacker
Tom Williams said. "But we
just wanted to come out and
earn respect and just hold our
tongues. We did our talking on
the field.
The win was the seventh in
a row for the Cardinal, giving
it a 6-2 Pacific 10 Conference
record (8-3 overall) and a tie
with the Bears for second in
the league.
"Being second in the Pac-10
means a lot to us," Green said.
"You can look at both records
and see 6-2, but you can see
that one starts with a 'C' and
one starts with an 'S' and you
know which one won between
