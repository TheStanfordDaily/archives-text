# We've got the Axe
## Cardinal skins Bears, 38-21 
### T. C. Hall Senior staff writer 
The mouths are shut, the
game is over and Stanford has
won.
Showing that pregame talk
does not mean anything come
game time, the Cardinal foot
ball team used a record-break
ing day from Tommy Vardell
and its trademark aggressive
defense to dominate the 94th
edition of Big Game 38-21 over
California.
"This is a great win for our
team because they played
hard," Stanford head coach
Denny Green said. "This was
by far the best and most phys
ical game we have played. It
was a significant game that we
had to play well in and we did."
California came into Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday full
of rhetoric. The Bears were the
sixth-ranked team in the coun
try. They were going to embar
rass the Cardinal and bring the
Axe back to Berkeley. They
even bought little ax necklaces
as motivation.
Cal can keep the jewelry.
Stanford is happy to have the
real thing.
"Emotions were running
high and Cal wanted to intimi
date us," inside linebacker
Tom Williams said. "But we
just wanted to come out and
earn respect and just hold our
tongues. We did our talking on
the field.
The win was the seventh in
a row for the Cardinal, giving
it a 6-2 Pacific 10 Conference
record (8-3 overall) and a tie
with the Bears for second in
the league.
"Being second in the Pac-10
means a lot to us," Green said.
"You can look at both records
and see 6-2, but you can see
that one starts with a 'C' and
one starts with an 'S' and you
know which one won between

the two."
And you can look back and see which school got
the Axe. The mounted symbol of the rivalry
between Stanford and Cal remains in Cardinal
hands. For fifth-year seniors like Vardell it is a
moment they relish because winning is all they
know against Cal. With Saturday's win, Stanford
extended its Big Game unbeaten streak to half a
decade.
"I've never lost the Axe — I'm unscathed,"
Vardell said. "It's a great feeling. I can carry it in
my pocket for the rest of my life."
In a series full of heroes, Vardell has made a
place for himself among the elite. The fullback
was the work horse of the day, running 39 times
for 182 yards and three touchdowns. When the
day was over, Vardell had become Stanford's sin
gle season rushing leader with 1,084 total yards.
"He had an unbelievable game; he tore them
apart," wide receiver Chris Walsh said. "He's a
man among boys. He loves the game and he just
went out there and took charge today."
As did the Cardinal defense. Cal came into the
game averaging 38.5 points a game, fifth best in
the country, but could only manage 21 against
Stanford. The Cardinal shut down Russell White
and the vaunted Cal running game, holding the
Bears to more than 100 yards under their season
average. Leading the way was Williams, who had a
team high 11 tackles with two for losses.
"Tom was just fired up today," outside
linebacker Dave Garnett said. "He was flying to
the ball everywhere and getting freed off blocks;
he really wanted to make a contribution to the
team."
After Vardell plunged in for a one yard touch
down early in the fourth quarter to build his
team's lead to 24-14, Stanford found itself ahead,
but not in charge. When the Bears took the ball
over with 11 minutes left in the game, it still
seemed like anyone's game to win.
As had been the case earlier, the Bears started
to move, but this time they were stopped quickly.
Facing second and 26 on his own 26-yard line after

a holding penalty, Pawlawski looked for a receiver
and found Darrien Gordon instead. The Stanford
cornerback intercepted the ball at the Cal 39 and
took it back to the 31. In a game driven by emo
tion, the momentum belonged to the Cardinal.
"I saw him looking toward me all the way,"
Gordon said. "I made a good break to the ball, and
he basically threw it right to me."
Not ones to waste a good chance, Stanford kept
the ball on the ground and let Vardell and half
back Glyn Milburn get to the four-yard line. Faced
with third and goal, Green decided not to go with
Vardell. Instead tight end Ryan Wetnight made a
diving catch in the right corner of the end zone for
the touchdown and the 31-14 lead.
With only 5:56 left in the game, it appeared
Stanford had finally taken control, but in Big
Game anything can happen, and for a moment it
seemed it would. Using a no-huddle offense, the
Bears drove 73 yards in only 1:08, scoring on an 8-
yard pass from Pawlawski to Dawkins. It was a
10-point ball game again with 4:48 left in the
game, plenty of time for surprises.
Yet there were none.
Needing a long, time-consuming drive, the Car
dinal provided just that. Starting at its 44, Stan
ford survived third-and-five, and third-and-nine
plays to march to the Cal's 18. Then, with a bit of
poetic justice, Vardell went off left tackle for his
last carry of the day, a 13-yard touchdown run
that put the Cardinal up 38-21.
"We just kept executing the same offense, and
there was not much they could do," Stanford
quarterback Steve Stenstrom said. "We just kept
our composure and let our pads do the talking."
Composure was something that the Bears
seemed to lack Saturday. Cal was called for 11
penalties resulting in a loss of 140 yards, many of
them in critical situations.
"I think that personal fouls are stupid foot
ball," Cal head coach Bruce Synder said. "If you
eliminate some of those 15-yard penalties, I see
this as a three-point game."
But those are just words, and the now No. 17
Cardinal has no use for them. Stanford has the win.
