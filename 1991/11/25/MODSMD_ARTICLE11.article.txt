The victory over Cal
highlights Stanford's
devotion to excellence

STANFORD'S BIG GAME tri
umph Saturday wonderfully
capped off the football team's
regular season — a season in which
the Cardinal steadily improved
with each passing week.
It was all too easy to criticize the
football program that in the sea
son's first two contests suffered a
humiliating blowout against Wash
ington and a demoralizing loss at
Arizona.
Even after watching an impres
sive victory against defending co
national champion Colorado, fans
could lament the next week's loss
to Notre Dame, a thumping hardly
mitigated by the devouring of
lightweight Cornell.
But in the throes of a losing sea
son and — Cornell notwithstand
ing — a schedule only a masochist
could love, Coach Denny Green
was building a winner.
Just ask USC, whom the Cardi
nal defeated in Los Angeles for the
first time in 16 years. Or ask
UCLA, who fell prey to a vicious
defense, on that day led by the
tackling of linebacker Ron George.
Or better yet, just ask Brian
Treggs, California's trash-talking
wide receiver who said he'd move
to Palo Alto if his team lost Big
Game. Anybody looking to sublet a
room?
And then there's Golden Bears
quarterback Mike Pawlawski, who
earlier in the week said Stanford
stands for "posh, uppity arro
gance" and that, as a school, it's
"no better than ours; they just
spend all of Daddy's money."
While covering the game, ABC's
Brent Musburger repeated Pawl
awski's comments only to let them
stand on their own and at another
point in the game expressed shock
at the use of the word "ain't" in a
Stanford student's sign. Choosing

to play on stereotypes, Musburger
implied that a public school was
more deserving of a football victo
ry than the elitists at Stanford.
Much more compelling than
such nonsensical comparisons,
though, would have been a look at
the NCAA-anomaly of the Stan
ford student-athlete in money
making sports. No university in
the nation can match Stanford's
combination of uncompromising
academic excellence and athletic
prowess.
In the end, of course, the trash
talkers got their just desserts — so
while Treggs and Pawlawski feel
sorry for themselves, the Cardinal
can celebrate knowing they not
only outplayed, but also outclassed
California in ensuring the Stanford
Axe would remain where it belongs
for the fifth consecutive year.
Unlike two weeks ago when
Stanford showed a disappointing
lack of sportsmanship with UCLA,
this weekend the Cardinal let their
playing do the talking and left the
taunting to those so inclined in the
crowd.
It was California, not Stanford,
whose wide receiver Sean Dawkins
lowered touchdown celebrations to
an all-time nadir, gallivanting for
the last 10 yards of his post-recep
tion run to the end zone.
And it was California, not the
Cardinal, who racked up an unbe
lievable 140 yards in penalties,
including five personal fouls for 75
of those yards. To his credit, Green
evidently talked to his players at
some point in the last two weeks
and told them to infuse a little
more sportsmanship into their act.
This season has been a mar
velous achievement for the foot
ball team. At a time in which the
University has been incessantly
under attack, the welcome relief of
football triumphs has unified the
community from Donald Kennedy
on down; for such magnificent
moments and for the fulfilling of
the words of the prophet — Beat
Cal — we give thanks.
Good luck and have fun in
Hawaii.
