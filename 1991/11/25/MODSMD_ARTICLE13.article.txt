## Bridge over troubled water 
### 
This weekend my mother is going to
the funeral of one of her favorite
aunts. For years I have heard her
talk about the fabulous Aunt Mae, whom
I only knew as an elderly, sickly lady.
Aunt Mae never held the same fasci
nation for me — elderly aunts who chew
tobacco and always want to kiss you
rarely excite little kids.
But when Mom told me that Aunt Mae
had passed away, I felt a strange absence. In
one sense, Aunt Mae was the kind old aunt
who called me "Baby" because she forgot
my name, yet always remembered my birth
day. But in another sense she represents a
past that created my hopes for a ftiture.
Born in rural Blakely, Georgia, she
had very little "book learning" or formal
education. She only learned the values of
common sense, hard work and belief in
God. She married early and lived with
her husband on a farm in what most of us
would describe as a nondescript life.
My mother spent many a summer on
this farm, learning lessons she couldn't
get from books. She talks about the little
5-foot-2-inch, 115-pound woman who ran
that farm with the strength and bril
liance of someone five times her size and
thrice as much education.
She talks about the lady that single
handedly tended crops, herded livestock
and chopped wood along with her "wom
anly" duties. My mother speaks with love
about the childless woman who opened

her home to her little busybody niece and
loved and raised her as if she had given
birth to her. She recounts gratefully the
poor woman who still managed to send
her a little something whenever she could
to make the rough times a little smoother.
When I remember Aunt Mae I can't help
but realize she was only one more link in
the chain of women in my family who bent
their backs as a bridge so that the next gen
eration could cross over to a better life.
My great-great grandmother Rachel, a
slave woman, married her daughter Mary
Lou, the product of a slave rape, to my
great-grandfather at the tender age of 14
in hopes that he would be able to take her
far away and protect her. Grandma Mary
Lou, in turn, did all that she could to give
my grandmother, Aunt Mae and their sib
lings everything possible to protect and
prepare them for the harsh road ahead.
Grandma, Aunt Mae and the rest of
her sisters did all they could for my moth
er, who was the first in the family to go to
college. And my mother, in turn, did her
part, from her struggles in the civil rights
movement to her decision to put her own
academic and professional ambitions on
hold in order to dedicate herself to raising
me and my siblings.
As I look at my own world in its imper
fection, I often get frustrated and angry
with the inequities and unfairness that I
see. I stay confused over what my role
should be, how I can continue to move

forward in progression when all around
me I see so much regression.
Sometimes I even wonder if its worth
while for me to bring more black women
and men into a world that is more likely
to mistreat and hate them, should it take
time to notice them at all.
But then when I think about my mother
and those that came before her, I recognize
that life for them has been no crystal stair.
Times were harder and the future looked
even more uncertain and impossible. Yet
they never complained about what they
didn't have or couldn't do because that
would have taken too much energy away
from accomplishing whatever they could.
Should I not continue in their tradi
tion, be it through my own children or
others, I will have stopped construction
on the only road to a better day.
And it would seem as if the passing of a
little old Georgia woman, whom I never
really got to know, would barely ripple the
surface, let alone leave a void. Yet, when I
look at my mother and then look at
myself, I know the reason I feel this vacan
cy at all is because it's my turn to fill it.
