ASSU ignored justice in rejecting C-15 amendment

lam deeply concerned about the ASSU
Senate's vote to reject the Committee
of 15's recommendations to change
the Judicial Charter to "clear and con
vincing evidence" from "beyond a reason
able doubt."
Those who voted to resist the change
claimed that it could not aid prosecu
tions of sexual assault and that it was
supposedly the University's attempt to
gain control over the students and strip
them of their rights. Both of these con
clusions are erroneous.
In order for a protection of student
rights to mean anything, there must be
some way to prosecute infringements of
these rights.
With a "beyond a reasonable doubt"

standard, it is impossible without direct
witnesses to establish that a sexual
assault occured. In reference to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole's statements, if
an accused person simply denies the act,
regardless of any corroborating evidence
presented by the complainant, including
physical evidence, then there will be a
reasonable doubt.
Thus, the only way to convict a sexual
assault is for the accused to confess to
the act. What results is the placement of
the power to establish guilt only in the
hands of the accused.
Since there is no possibility of a con
viction without a confession, the process
would actually deter survivors from
reporting. I would certainly discourage

any survivor from facing the frustration
of reporting through Stanford channels
given the current burden of proof.
Some ASSU senators claim that our
rights as students would be usurped by
changing the burden of proof. In reality,
the right to justice in sexual assault cases
is still not guaranteed by retaining the sta
tus quo of "beyond a reasonable doubt."
The senators ignored the history of
how these recommendations came about
and the effect they would have. Further
more, much of the information they relied
upon, such as the speculation that up to
30 percent of innocent students would be
convicted falsely under the changed bur
den of proof, was simply inaccurate.
The senators say that sexual assault

is bad, yet they do not allow changes to
combat and prosecute it.
Although 3,000 students signed the
petition to change the Judicial Charter,
the senators instead chose to base their
decision upon inaccurate information,
their own select "constituencies" and
their personal, knee-jerk reactions.
Ideally, the burden of proof will be
changed. If it is not, then perhaps the
Judicial Charter should exclude sexual
assault as a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard because it will be a mean
ingless, unenforceable rule.
Potential assailants will have nothing
to worry about here at Stanford.
