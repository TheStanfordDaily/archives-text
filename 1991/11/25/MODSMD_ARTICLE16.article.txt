# The 						riches of performing arts prove invaluable to town-gown relations
## 
### 
On Nov. 17 1 went to a free concert at
the Mormon Church in south Palo Alto,
and heard the Stanford Chamber
Orchestra, the Stanford Chorus under
Dr. William Ramsay's direction and four
wonderful soloists make a joyous sound!
As we listened to the magnificent
Mozart Mass in C-minor, the overflow
crowd was transported to a realm
beyond budget crunches, salary cuts,
messy research cost accounting and all
other nasty realities.
As a staff member for over 33 years
and a Palo Alto resident for the same

number of years, I thought for once
town and gown were really together; it
was truly fine.
After the glow of the concert I remem
bered about the threatened end to all the
performing arts at Stanford and I felt an
overwhelming sadness. Imagine: no more
music, no more plays, no more dance, no
more paintings! We can live without all
those things, I suppose, but how impov
erished we would all be.
It is just these riches that has kept us
at Stanford and in Palo Alto. I want
them to continue for my children and
grandchildren, please!
