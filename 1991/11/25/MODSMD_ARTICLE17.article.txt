# Another postal pan: Soviet mail system shames Stanford's
## 
### 
I recently received a package from
San Diego with "Priority Mail" stamped
all over it. It was post marked Oct. 24.1
received it nine days later, full of bro-

ken, stale Halloween cookies. This is not
priority service!
In fact, every piece of mail I have
received from southern California has
taken at least a week to reach me.
I recently spent four months in the
Soviet Union where mail took six weeks
to get to me from Los Angeles, if it got to
me at all. As far as I know, St. Peters
burg is at least six times as far away
from southern California as Stanford is.
Does this mean that our post office has
the same efficiency as the Soviet postal
service?
Or is it even worse, since my mail to
the Soviet Union was passing through
international borders and probably being
read by the CIA, KGB or both? Why? I
don't want to hear that the post office is
understaffed, because in four years they
could have hired a couple of extra work
ers.
Heck, I would have volunteered to
sort mail and stuff it into boxes! Will
somebody please explain why the post
office is so slow? And even better, would
someone do something about it?
